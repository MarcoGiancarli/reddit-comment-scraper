buffy,3e2pvd,SPacific,72,Wed Jul 22 00:05:26 2015 UTC,Wait...are you saying there's some sort of connection between Ben and Glory?
buffy,3e2pvd,marsbar3,15,Tue Jul 21 15:01:31 2015 UTC,This...is going to be worth it.  <THWACK>  OWWWWW!

buffy,3e2pvd,sacjmc,28,Tue Jul 21 20:55:34 2015 UTC,Hold on - are you saying that Ben and Glory are working together?
buffy,3e2pvd,marsbar3,19,Tue Jul 21 18:05:05 2015 UTC,I suspect Ben may be subletting from Glory.
buffy,3e2pvd,Wihwez,25,Tue Jul 21 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"This gets explained later. I'm almost certain that it is explained in the next episode.   Also, in the episode where Dawn sees Ben change into Glory. You can see her confusion when she tries to explain what happened to Buffy and the gang. Like she forgot how Glory got there and what happened to Ben."
buffy,3e2pvd,monkeymosh88,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"Don't want to spoil anything but it does get explained, you could re watch that episode to refresh on exactly what Dawn said after seeing Ben change to Glory."
buffy,3e2pvd,Beloit,11,Tue Jul 21 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"OP asked not to spoil, though. And that... really spoils it. I think ""just keep watching"" would have sufficed."
buffy,3e2pvd,venom8599,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno. It's pretty obvious something like that was happening if you pay attention earlier. Dawn doesn't know where Ben went during the hospital confrontation with Glory, and rationalizes it as he must've left before it happened.  It's not like it was something they never touched on."
buffy,3e2pvd,Beloit,10,Tue Jul 21 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"That's like telling a new watcher ""Angel is a vampire, duh"" after they've only seen two episodes because the hints are there and they should just have connected the dots. It's foreshadowing that might be super obvious in hindsight but clearly OP didn't get there yet. It's just rude because OP's fist sentence is literally asking not to spoil anything past ""Spiral""."
buffy,3e2pvd,ShushImAtWork,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I understand missing things, but this was seriously overlooked by OP. Further, why message asking what happened if you're not going to continue on to the next episode as the transformation from Ben to Glory happens late in the episode?"
buffy,3e2pvd,BadEgo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:06 2015 UTC,It's obvious that Dawn immediately forgets when she sees the transformation. It's not a spoiler to point out something that happened earlier that the viewer didn't remember.

Started an Internet radio station at my university. It is against the law to play the same song three times in a row. Hell, the are rules restricting the number of songs that can be played from the same record within an hour.  Whoever is in charge probably realized this and scrapped the DJ."

buffy,3e1cjl,barre_chord_reality,2,Tue Jul 21 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think most of the instances you described happened before Willow drained Rack of his magicks. Prior to that, she was feeding off of her own rage, which was angry but not necessarily evil. IMO she became more evil after absorbing Rack's energy, and her choices became much more villainous. That's why Giles saves the day at the end by letting her feed off of his good magicks, therefore allowing Xander to  access her inner humanity.  (Yellow crayon, tear)"
buffy,3e1cjl,BlackMoonWolf3113,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"One thing about Dark Willow which was left unclear was how much of her viciousness was due to outside influence from the magic, and how much was just Willow letting her darker impulses out because of her anger and depression. It does make some sense that Rack's power could have 'corrupted' her, but it's hard to say since the ""rules"" of Buffyverse magic are so relatively vague."

Keep tallies of trends, like how many times Xander is shown drinking juice, or how many times Giles gets knocked down. If you wanted to, keep a kill count running for everyone.  Watch for hints of a development earlier than you noticed on the first watch-through. For example, try to pinpoint the earliest hints that Willow and Tara are involved with each other or try to identify the events that tell the viewers that Buffy and Angel's relationship is doomed.  Any observations that you think are interesting, write down as you watch. For example, last watch-through I noticed how apparently the school curriculum covers Othello years 2 and 4. Also, I found it very interesting that for a campy 90s teen drama, all the educators at Sunnydale are shown to be nothing but completely competent in their jobs, if not excellent at them. I thought that was a cool decision from the writers."

When they were dating someone else, I got jealous. Even though we'd never been together. I still got jealous and upset. Even though I'd never asked them out. And if I had gotten attention from my crush? Even if I was dating someone else, even if they were dating someone else? If it was someone I'd had a crush on for most of my life? Yeah, I would totally do what Willow did. I would react the same way.    I'm now in my 30s, and of course, this behavior seem irrational and stupid. But when your emotions are all teenager-hormonal? Yeah, you make stupid decisions and make plenty of wrong choices. It's easy to see what a bad choice it is from a distance. When you're in it, though, you don't think logically."

If you add to that the fact that Cordelia got Xander when Willow long wanted him without success, it makes sense that she is not very considerate."

Some characters liked Angel and didn't like Spike - that's just how it is with people, and in real life too. People just really don't like being proved wrong about things. In this case, it's about their opinions of Angel and Spike."
buffy,3dxav6,Markatansky,31,Mon Jul 20 10:22:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. Dawn has a great quote that goes something like ""what's so great about a soul? Angel had a soul when he left Buffy, Xander had a soul when he left Anya""... That's just the gist. I don't remember the whole thing.   Plenty of ensouled people do pretty cruddy things.  Plus, as squishy as Spike might be on the inside, he's not like ""nice""."

The only time you can kill Glory is when she is Ben, but he is an innocent person so that brings up the question of if its still okay to kill him or not."
buffy,3dxav6,LunchpaiI,7,Mon Jul 20 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"He summoned the Queller. Ben, he in himself, was a murderer."
buffy,3dxav6,DaddyCatALSO,6,Mon Jul 20 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Ben had to die, there was just no way around it.   That doesn't make Giles any less of a killer. Plus, it's alluded to that Giles did some bad things as Ripper before even series 1 of Buffy, so... yeah."
buffy,3dxav6,Markatansky,5,Mon Jul 20 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think he was innocent. He was down with killing Dawn, after all."
buffy,3dxav6,mickey5499,3,Mon Jul 20 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"It was him or Dawn though, anyone in his position would rather kill Dawn than kill yourself I think.  Also, they could have just stalled him if he ever tried to, since the time that the Key is actually useful was very short.  The show, in my opinion, tries to make it a point that it's never okay to kill humans.  Even after what Warren did, the scoobies still didn't think it was right to kill him; they wanted him to go through legal channels, same with Jonathon and Andrew.  And even Willow, though Warren killed Tara, felt guilty about it for the rest of the series.    I think it's worth bringing up that Giles seemingly never felt anything after killing Ben.  The circumstances called for it.  Let Glory live, and she would find a way to raise hell and probably be out for blood against all the Scoobies since they foiled her plan.  It's one of the only human deaths in the series I found justified.  I definitely thought Warren needed justice after killing Tara, but he was fully human, unlike Ben.  However, since The First comes back in S7, it's quite possibly that if Warren lived, he would have been its tool somehow.  I suppose this is going super off-topic from the OP now, lol... woops"
buffy,3dxav6,LunchpaiI,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"It was him or Dawn though, anyone in his position would rather kill Dawn than kill yourself I think.   Really? I'm not sure most people would murder a teenage girl to save themselves. I certainly hope not..."

If it can't, take care of the justice yourself. It's not a strict demon vs. human issue. Human courts could have dealt with Warren, but not with Ben."
buffy,3dxav6,pober,2,Tue Jul 21 20:04:26 2015 UTC,Exactly!   Does Anya have a soul?
buffy,3dxav6,DeenotheDino,7,Mon Jul 20 11:03:31 2015 UTC,Who even knows? I think it's assumed she does but who actually knows
buffy,3dxav6,Markatansky,6,Mon Jul 20 11:08:19 2015 UTC,Maybe the bunnies know. Maybe that's what they need good eyesight for anyway.
buffy,3dxav6,DeenotheDino,3,Mon Jul 20 11:15:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Anya was a human who became a demon, and when she was turned into a not-demon she was returned to the state she was in when she got her demon powers.  Given that he powers came from her necklace, it is possible that she was always human and had a mantle of power from D'Hoffryn.  Further, we know that a vampire is made when a lesser demon takes over a soulless body which makes a blending of the human it was and the demon inside.  Anya even says she wielded the power of the Wish, not had but wielded, and the fact that D'Hoffryn was able to offer her those powers back (and later offers them to Willow) it's interesting to think that maybe Anya was never without a soul."
buffy,3dxav6,kaggzz,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"And when Anya gets her powers back and kills those frat boys, she feels so horrible, she was willing to die to undo it.  I think that shows she had a soul.  She probably had one when she was a deamon before, but maybe she had forgotten what it was like to be human."
buffy,3dxav6,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Mon Jul 20 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible at remembering names and things. But in the episode when Anya goes head to head against Buffy because of that big spider demon. Anya asks T'hoffran to fix it, and he says the price is the life and soul of a vengeance demon."
buffy,3dxav6,DeenotheDino,16,Mon Jul 20 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"What bugs me is how Buffy acted so cold and distrustful of Spike even when she knew his soul was restored in season 7. YET, she trusted Angel when his soul was restored even after he killed Jenny Calendar, stalked, manipulated and fought Buffy, tried to have her friends killed, tortured Giles almost to death and tried to destroy the world (and even then Spike helped Buffy, even though it was for selfish reasons).   Buffy was a lot more idealistic when she was in high school."
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,12,Mon Jul 20 12:30:48 2015 UTC,"That, &, she never blamed Angel for Angelus' actions.  Spike did get the raw end of the deal though.  He tried to be good without a soul, as where Angelus would never ever do that."
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,5,Mon Jul 20 15:15:55 2015 UTC,Although . . . the difference between Angel and Angelus was pretty huge.  There didn't seem to be much different about Spike once he got a soul.
buffy,3dxav6,howispellit,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"Other than some of his choices changing because of the intense guilt of having a soul, how  was Angelus different for the first few years after he got a soul?"
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,4,Mon Jul 20 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Well . . . I guess i'm thinking about how the Angel we know in Buffy is pretty different then the Angelus that appears in season 2. Meanwhile, if you want to compare Spike from season 5 of Angel to Spike from season 4 onward of Buffy ,there isn't that much difference."
buffy,3dxav6,howispellit,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"There are many examples of ""Angel"" acting  like ""Angelus"" while having a soul.  A good part of Angel season two explores how dark Angel can be while he still has one.  In Angel s1 ""Eternity"" he feels like he doesn't have a soul anymore, and thinks he is free to act accordingly.  Angel, when he is dealing with having a soul, withdraws into himself to a degree because of the guilt. That is how he tends to deal with stress.  This is how we are introduced to Angel, and when he loses his soul he finally feels free to indulge in all the behavior that he felt drawn to as a vampire, but resisted because of the mental pain it causes when he has a soul.   Angel:  “I need to apologize to both of you.”   Wesley:  “There is really no need.”   Cordy:  “Uh, hello?”   Wesley:  “It was the drugs, couldn’t be helped.  Things were said, it’s true, but - I think it best if we simply put it behind us (gets up) – move on.”   Angel:  “Thank you.”   Wesley leaving:  “You walk a fine line Angel. - I don’t envy you.”       Jenny:  He's not Angel anymore. Are you?  Angel:  Wrong. I am Angel. At last!   There is an element of choice with what he reveals about himself to the people around him.   Cordy: Right now. It's time for you to get all vampy - grr! - Kate needs you.  Angel: I don't want to. You both withdraw when I go vamp. I feel you judge me.      Faith: What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.  Angel: Second best.   He will often speak with Spike in ways he doesn't feel free to with other people, because of their similar histories.   ANGEL: I didn't make you, Spike. I just opened up the door...  and let the real you out.    ANGEL: I couldn't take my eyes off them. I was only in it for the evil. It was everything to me. It was art. The destruction of a human being. I would've considered Dana a masterpiece.   What we see after he loses his soul in season 2 is him recommitting himself to his former (evil) lifestyle with great enthusiasm. Enthusiasm he did not have before because of the stress he feels when he has a soul."
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,30,Mon Jul 20 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:  First of, Angelus did love Buffy. In a early episode as Angelus he actually says ''To kill her, you have to love her'' about Buffy, so clearly he loves her even in his demonic state, but he HATES Buffy for it cause he doesn't want to feel this 'love' for her, which is very clear in 'I only have eyes for you' after they kissed and Angelus is washing himself and goes ''UGH! SHE MADE ME FEEL!''.  Secondly, Spike does get a lot of shit, but that's how his character is. Spike is the bad boy that actually has a very kind and loving heart, but he was also a soulless demon that had killed for several decades. Angel has not since he stopped when he lost his soul, which I believe to be like 70 years or so before he meet Buffy?  So you have a vampire with a soul that tries to avoid people for several decades, proving that they WANT to change, and this other guy that just got done killing victims and then goes ''I HEART BUFFY! FOR REALZ! No joke!'' - and I think that's why it's just more difficult for Buffy to trust Spike the same way she trusted and loved Angel.   Angel and Spike never liked each other, so that they go at it in the final season of Angel is just perfect in my opinion, cause they both still both love Buffy a lot and kinda hate each other for it."
buffy,3dxav6,3lvy,10,Mon Jul 20 08:48:03 2015 UTC,agreed on most of this right here...especially agree on that last part...they NEVER got along...why would it be any different in angel...especially when it goes back to the real reason angel hated spike in the first place...he's stealing his spotlight...lol
buffy,3dxav6,predaboy,2,Mon Jul 20 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"Angel was very whiney, so I agree! You could clearly see that he was jealous, and theres even an episode or more where Angel starts questioning if he even needs to be there anymore. This is kinda why I don't like Angel, cause he's very immature for a 240' something year old guy."
buffy,3dxav6,3lvy,13,Tue Jul 21 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"It may have to do with how scoobies got to know them first: Angel as an ally, Spike as an enemy."
buffy,3dxav6,IraninaGenius,12,Mon Jul 20 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"This is actually super important. Angel establishes himself as an ally before doing anything too destructive/distrustful, and then re-establishes trust.  Spike establishes himself as a monster, then continually proves he's a shaky ally at best, before ""turning over a new leaf"" and still having issues with insanity and murdering."
buffy,3dxav6,cakebatter,3,Mon Jul 20 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"This was exactly what I thought. And there was also a large distrust after he came back from the hell dimension. It took awhile for the gang to get back to a place of trust, but even then it was at arm's length."
buffy,3dxav6,Tesatire,12,Mon Jul 20 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"Reminder that Angel had to regain trust from everybody in Season 3 as well. And Xander always had disliked Angel, even with a soul."

I actually thought that Buffy was awfully quick to trust Spike again in season 7, all things considered.   But doesn't that just show how much of a more humane person Spike is as a demon compared to Angelus?   Not exactly. It might be true the Spike isn't as ""pure evil"" as Angelus is (that's what the Judge says in season 2, anyway) but he also has the chip holding him back. Without that the difference between them probably would never have gotten as noticeable as it did.  But anyway, as other people have pointed out: a lot of it probably has to do with first impressions. Once people form an opinion about someone, it's really hard to get them to change their minds. Like if you know someone who was a raging alcoholic, and causing a lot of destruction in their own lives and those of their friends, it can be hard to trust them even if they're sincerely trying to be sober. Now replace ""alcoholic"" with ""homicidal vampire"", and you can see why it was so difficult for the Scoobies to trust Spike even after he got his soul back.  Likewise with Angel, Buffy first gets to know him as an ally and boyfriend, and even thought their relationship wasn't exactly normal or ""good"" it was still better than the fucked-up thing that she and Spike get into. And of course she's also younger, more naive, etc.   Another annoying thing about Spikes constant criticism is how even on the last season of the spinoff ""Angel"" Spike was still getting shit from Angel   Because Angel and Spike have always had that kind of relationship. Even before Angel got his soul, their personalities clashed, and they kept on clashing after Spike got his back (the ""cavemen vs. astronauts"" discussion is a perfect illustration of this.) And of course, there was the added layer of jealousy about Buffy. If they had gotten along too well in Angel S05 it wouldn't have been believable."
buffy,3dxav6,MercuryChaos,11,Mon Jul 20 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"If you’re interested I once wrote a few posts about this topic but here’s my TL;DR two cents:    Buffy  (or anyone) is not obligated to forgive her attacker/abuser just because they’ve changed.  Buffy (or anyone) is allowed to forgive attacker/abuser if she chooses to.  People didn’t necessarily trust Angel.  Xander in particular didn’t trust Angel any more than he trusted Spike.  Pre-soul Spike never did a single selfless act. Every good deed he did was for his own selfish reasons, including not giving up Dawn to Glory.  You could make all kinds of philosophical arguments about the nature of good deeds in all people, but let’s just take this for what it’s worth.  With-a-soul Spike was literally crazy and also killed.  He wasn’t just some normal dude all of sudden.  Finally, Spikes re-ensoulment was very different from Angel’s.  Angel/Angelus are very different creatures.  Souless Spike and ensouled Spike exist on much more of a continuum.  It’s probably a lot easier to keep seeing ensouled Spike as his old self, than it is to see puppy-dog face Angel as sneering, evil Angelus."
buffy,3dxav6,cakebatter,5,Mon Jul 20 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"Angel/Angelus are very different creatures.    Angel's personality does not change as much as most people seem to think when he loses his soul.   There are many times when Angel being happy looks the same as ""Angelus"" being happy.  Angelus does not lose his penchant for being dramatic when he has his soul.  The way Angel likes to make entrances, the way he almost killed himself in Buffy s3, how he acted in ""Angel"" after Buffy thought he bit her mother, all very melodramatic.  Angel's initial infatuation with Buffy is similar to past behavior patterns while he was soulless.  What changes is how destructive these patterns and tendencies become to the people around him."
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,3,Mon Jul 20 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about how they're not totally different.  I talk about that a bit in the posts I linked to, how essentially a vampire is just an evil version of your ensouled self.  But there are enough differences that Angel feels very different from Angelus.  Obviously this is pretty subjective but that's my read and that's the sense I get from a lot of other fans too."
buffy,3dxav6,cakebatter,4,Mon Jul 20 14:48:53 2015 UTC,A factor in that viewpoint might be that we don't get to see Angelus doing everyday stuff like we do with Spike when he is soulless.
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:21 2015 UTC,"Pre-soul Spike never did a single selfless act.   I would argue a lot of what he did for Drusilla was selfless and done from love for her, not just for himself.    Spikes re-ensoulment was very different from Angel’s.   He actively got re-souled. I would think that would actually be more honorable than getting cursed into it.  That said, points 1 and 2 are actually super important and I agree wholeheartedly."
buffy,3dxav6,elkanor,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you check out my blog posts on it, I make that exact argument about Spike's re-ensoulment and how it was an active choice instead of a curse.  As for his love for Dru, I think it's pretty tricky territory.  Spike once explains to Buffy that love should burn and hurt and consume, which is totally what happened with him and Dru, but which is also not a great model for a healthy relationship.  It's tough to say, but I think a lot of his actions for Dru came from a self-serving place, a big argument for which I would point to his jealousy/possessiveness/inclination to ""reclaim"" her, etc.  Definitely up for debate and I think when you start to examine selflessness on border philosophical level you could say he's not necessarily less selfless than humans, but I'm inclined to believe he is."
buffy,3dxav6,cakebatter,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else says keep in mind that we're seeing ensouled Angel and ensouled Spike at very different times in their re-ensoulment.  Angel takes almost a hundred years (1898 to 1996) to come to terms with who he is with a soul and decide to do something good with his life.  Even after his second ensoulment, he's spent untold periods of time in a hell dimension, with a soul, before we see him again (and even then everyone's pretty upset about it, esp. Giles).  The Spike we see with a soul is in the immediate aftermath of getting a soul for the first time.  He's crazy with grief, and also just crazy, and being manipulated by the First.  He's just flat out unstable.  Even if the Scoobies were able to separate Spike-with-a-soul from Vampire Spike, Spike-with-a-soul has proven to be dangerous and untrustworthy."
buffy,3dxav6,CJGibson,16,Mon Jul 20 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"I've always hated the rape scene.  & not for what most people hate it for.  Okay so just hear me out.. It just didn't ever fit in my mind.  When Buffy & Spike first have sex, they're in the middle of fighting each other & bring down an entire building with their love making.  Their relationship was always extremely rough.  So in the bathroom scene, Spike is being aggressive, as they normally are, but she had just gone through something & it was not welcomed at the time.  When he sees that it's serious he immediately backs off.  & IIRC, he goes & gets his soul directly after that episode.  I don't know, I know she was feeling vulnerable & attacked after that, but to call Spike an attempted rapist from here on out just seemed a little fucked up.  Please don't kill me guys."
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,7,Mon Jul 20 15:09:31 2015 UTC,He doesn't back off until he's kicked across a room. Not truly a voluntary stopping.
buffy,3dxav6,DaddyCatALSO,9,Mon Jul 20 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"Only because he doesn't realize they aren't doing their normal song & dance.  Once he sees the look on her face, he realizes what was actually happening & stops.  If he was truly intent on raping her, he wouldn't have stopped, left town, & went to find himself a soul.  He would have kept at it.  It was a misunderstanding, imo"
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,5,Mon Jul 20 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Plus, it pisses me off to no end that Xander went around being a douchebag about it. What makes Xander think he's any better than Spike? DOES EVERYONE FORGET THAT XANDER TRIED TO RAPE BUFFY TOO? It was in season 1 episode 6, ""The Pack."" To be fair, Xander was under the influence of evil hyena magic. However, Xander and Buffy had done absolutely NOTHING even remotely sexual, so he had no reason to believe that ""she wanted it."" And once the spell wears off, what does he do? He pretends that he doesn't remember doing it at all because he's too much of a coward to admit that he almost raped Buffy. Meanwhile, Spike (soulless vampire demon with a constant desire for blood and violence, a condition that I would say is at least comparable to the hyena-magic) realizes that he almost raped Buffy, feels disgusted with himself, admits it, makes no excuses for himself, and goes to get his soul that very night. As far as he knew, he was acting within the boundaries of their incredibly fucked up relationship and he didn't realize that she actually meant ""no."" But once he realized, everything stopped immediately. Meanwhile, Hyena-Xander knew that she actually meant ""no,"" and just didn't give a fuck. But Xander goes and makes Spike into a huge jerk for it."

buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:51 2015 UTC,Thank you! n-n
buffy,3dxav6,luckyluna,11,Tue Jul 21 22:58:10 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.   Their relationship was always extremely rough.   There is a big, big difference between "" being rough"" and raping someone. You can have consensual rough sex. Admittedly, Buffy and Spike do push the boundaries of consent way more than is healthy (see: the scene in the Bronze, the episode where Buffy's invisible) but the scene in ""Seeing Red"" is pretty clear-cut. Buffy has ended the relationship at this point, she tells him to leave, and Spike doesn't listen. And the way he acts in that scene isn't even particularly rough or violent (compared to how they act in other scenes, anyway) which IMO made it all the more disturbing. He's not trying to hurt her or start a fight with her, he just disregards her when she tell him to stop - and there's a word for people who do that.   When he sees that it's serious he immediately backs off.   He backs off because she physically pushes him away. It's true that he doesn't try again, and immediately tries to atone for it, but none of that changes the fact of what he did.  I think Spike is one of the most interesting characters in this series, and he's definitely my favorite, and it really bothers me when I see people try to downplay the seriousness of this scene because (among other things) it's really important for his character development. For most of the series Spike's had the chip and his feelings for Buffy serving as a substitute for empathy and a conscience, and this scene is the first time when he recognizes that those aren't good enough - and he's able to realize it because what he almost did was so awful, and to someone he actually cares about."
buffy,3dxav6,MercuryChaos,7,Mon Jul 20 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong (& I very well might be), doesn't she end things with him on a constant basis?  From what I remember watching that scene, & I am admittedly rusty on it, I remember thinking that Spike didn't believe her in ""yeah yeah, we're always 'over'"" kind of way.  Don't get me wrong, no means no, one hundred percent of the time, but I feel like Spike is so used to hearing her say no & mean yes (scene at the Bronze).  So, to me, it isn't unreasonable to think that he wasn't trying to rape her, just didn't understand the seriousness of the situation until it was far too late.    Now, I'm not saying that Buffy didn't feel violated or vulnerable or anything like that, I'm saying she felt all those things & that's what snapped Spike into realizing what was happening.  IIRC, doesn't he even say ""I didn't mean to"" before running off?  I am not trying to downplay that scene one bit.  I agree that it's important that he see that he's capable of hurting her on a deeper level, I just still don't think he was trying to flat out rape her."
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,3,Mon Jul 20 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"So, to me, it isn't unreasonable to think that he wasn't trying to rape her   I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying that it's only attempted rape and if someone goes in with no intention of stopping no matter what happens? Do they have to be thinking ""I'm going to rape them""?  What would have to happen before you'd consider it to be attempted rape?   And yes, I'm pretty sure Buffy did try to end things with him multiple times, but that doesn't change my view. In a healthy relationship, if one person seems ambivalent about things, it doesn't mean the other per gets to assume they mean ""yes"" — it means they back off and give the ambivalent person some space to figure out what they want. Obviously that's not what Spike does, and that's not really surprising since he's still soulless and basically out for his own interests. But the fact that it's hard for him to act any way other than selfish at this point doesn't change the fact that he is acting that way. And likewise, his motivations and whatever else was going on in his head doesn't change the fact that the thing he almost does to Buffy in that scene is rape her. If he thought it was something else before she kicked him across the room (but still after she said no) it shows us that he's still severely lacking in the moral compass and self-awareness departments, but it doesn't change what he was doing.   I'm also taking into consideration all the stuff that's happened in the Buffy comics, but I don't know if you read those and don't want to spoil anything for you."
buffy,3dxav6,MercuryChaos,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the comics yet.  I started this comment several times over before I figured out where I wanted to go with it.  I decided that, I wanted to do full disclosure.  I've been a part of both ends, I'm a victim, & I enjoy rough sex.  There, I said it.  So with that said, I'll call it rape when I fucking see rapist tendencies.  For me to call it rape, I'll need to see a lot more than some foreplay gone wrong.  I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks & have had a friend call me crying her eyes out because she had to run ten blocks to escape her best friend's boyfriend from sexually attacking her.  I've also heard of more subtle molestation situations.  Having a sister who worked with battered women, I've heard every end of the spectrum.  So, again, I say, I completely understand where we are supposed to feel for Buffy, for her in that situation, but Spike is not a rapist, nor a potential rapist.  Period.  I will say again, no means no, & I never, ever, said she deserved it in any way.  This entire thread is about how Spike gets the raw end, & he perceived the situation very poorly, but he is not, & never will be, a rapist in my mind."
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on every front, but in the heat of the moment if Buffy didn't or worse, couldn't kick him off, I do think he would've kept going. I guess it's different because he knows how powerful she is but if she was a little more hurt and he didn't stop, it would've been unconsensual sex. It sucks because it could've gone either way if for whatever Spike wanted to end it but Buffy still wanted her crutch. I guess it's just an example of how important communication and a ""safe word"" is in a relationship like this."
buffy,3dxav6,The_Ripper42,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"=( I never thought about the 'what if' in this situation, but I think you're right, he would have kept going.  I'd like to think at some point he would have realized, he would have eventually realized that this wasn't what she wanted & this isn't play time... I just don't think that Spike would have followed through, however long it had taken him to figure it out.  Thank goodness it never got past where it was"
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,7,Tue Jul 21 18:31:35 2015 UTC,I feel the same exact way. I think he gets too much hate for it. Even injured I think she could take Spike but either way they were always extremely rough with each other and she just wasn't into it at the time. I mean she basically was raping Spike when she was invisible if he wasn't into it and tried to push her off would she have gotten the hate that he did? I highly doubt it.
buffy,3dxav6,Samariumcupcakes,7,Mon Jul 20 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Even when I was showing the series to my fiance, when that scene came on he was like ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME."" I reply ""THANK YOU.""  I'm so glad I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I've always been too afraid to speak up about it because I thought people would jump down my throat"
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"I've always felt the exact same way.    Spike and Buffy always had extremely volatile relations.  Watching that scene I feel like he's going about things the way they always would.    When she does finally push him away he sees she wasn't feeling the same way.  But I don't think, given their history and the way she always treated him, there was a way for him to think this was any different than any other time.  When he sees how she felt about it he rightfully freaks the hell out but I don't believe that was his intention or that there was a way for him to know what she was thinking until she pushed him away.  Up until then it was business as usual."
buffy,3dxav6,WilliamMcCarty,3,Tue Jul 21 06:33:43 2015 UTC,Exactly! He has no soul so the conscious isn't really there.. but he REALIZED how wrong he was. And Angelus didn't give 2 craps about how he treated Buffy lol

buffy,3dxav6,linktm,4,Mon Jul 20 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed it's because of the whole sexual assault thing. Which when compared to Angel starts becoming a whole thing of ""What's more evil, rape or murder?"" debate. At the end of the day, all soulless creatures can't be blamed for their actions in the Buffy world. They don't have a soul, and they're not in full control of their actions usually. The fact Spike was able to overcome that lack of control and make a decision to regain his soul should speak volumes about the kind of person he is, which is why I assume Buffy trusted him so quickly in Season 7."
buffy,3dxav6,bgo2000,3,Mon Jul 20 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to say a larger theme to the whole Spike character is just the themes of what is ""good"" and what is ""bad"" in the Buffyverse, and again... it's a part of what makes this show brilliant. With Angel, we believe to learn some standby truths: With a soul, he is inherently ""good"" and wishes to redeem himself by being a champion to right his wrongdoings and earn his spot with higher beings. Without a soul, he is out and out gleefully evil and enjoys doing the stuff that make us shudder and cringe at night. With a soul, he basically is a prisoner of his own guilt. He seeks love from Buffy to validate this need for atonement, and she gives it.   On the other hand, we have Spike, who has no soul but continually makes decisions that aren't always considered inherently ""bad."" He seems to get off on the violence and the wrongs, but if you look a little deeper, you find out he's a guy who has sought out love and acceptance for all of his existence. From his mother; from Angel and Drusilla; from Buffy. With Angel, he wanted acceptance so much that he would go through hoops to prove his worthiness ... killing and slaying slayers along the way.  So, we have this sort of idea: Soul = ""good"" and No Soul = ""bad."" But just because someone is inherently ""bad,"" does that mean they always always make bad, chaotic decisions? Nope. Just because someone is ""good"" and even a hero or champion, does that mean they always make the ""right and good"" choices in life?  Buffy herself sets out on a path of self destruction. We do that sometimes, us people, whether we have a soul or not. There is this seed, this one thing that may drive us for years. We seek out to satisfy that need, and make subconscious decisions in order to attain it. Sometimes to the detriment of ourselves.   You can look at these characters and see it in all of them. There's not a one-size-fits-all formula for any of it.  But yeah, to me ... Spike's quest for redemption almost seems more legit because he sought it out himself. Angel was forced to have his soul back and saddled with guilt in order to seek redemption."
buffy,3dxav6,eadon_rayne,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, I'd like to call attention to their human lives (what little we see of them in the shows). Liam was a drunkard and wastrel who spent all his time gambling and whoring away his family's money (and would steal from them when he ran out). William was a gentle poet who loved his mother (maybe a little too much). Liam became Angelus because Darla offered him the opportunity to be a predator and the power that came with that. William turned to Dru because she was pretty and damaged and he wanted to take care of her. He didn't really know what he was getting into until it had been done."

Yeah, he does some redeeming things, with soul and without. But he's still sort of a dick to everyone regardless.

buffy,3dxav6,Arancaytar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"Angel had the Jekyll/Hyde thing going, so he wasn't really considered responsible for what Angelus did.

(Personally, I think the latter approach was better - more complex -, and an example of how the series matured.)"
buffy,3dxav6,calgil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:50 2015 UTC,I don't think it took too long for Buffy to trust him after he was resouled. She had his chip removed.

He tells people what they need to hear and it works! I think he just lacks a filter, Angel is just more of a ""Think before you speak"" kind of guy and that worked for him too. Angel was more level headed and understanding, and Spike would kind of go nuts easily. Spike was just all around an interesting dude!"
buffy,3dxav6,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"This is late and everyone's made some great points but I thought I'd add my two cents. I think the difference between the two is their relationships with the demons inside them. Think about it. Liam the man was very stubborn and headstrong and he got a demon to match that personality. Angelus the demon wanted nothing to do with humanity so he pushed Liam out of the way to become the biggest bad in all the land. When Angel gets his soul back he is so terrified by Angelus that he forces himself away from humanity to prevent his demons from hurting others. The Angel that we know and love has figured out how to be a force of good and in doing so separates his name from the demon within him. Angel hates Angelus and Angelus detests Angel and we can see they both do everything they can to get away from each other. Spike has a much more codependent relationship with his demon. Liam the man is fairly passive and his demon matches that description. The demon allows the man to exist which is why he still has warm feelings towards his mother and love for the woman in his life. When Angelus teaches him how to be evil the man allows the demon to do his thing and be a force of evil. When the demon is neutered with the chip, after some struggle the man takes center stage again with everything that happens in season 5-6. The ""sort-of-almost"" rape scene was the demon trying to solve the man's problems ending disastourously. When Spike gets his soul (after going a little crazy) he recognizes that the demon is still inside him and he's okay with that and wields that to his advantage. The man and the demon are both present on a spectrum which is why he doesn't bother changing his name. Angel and Angelus are a dichotomy because they choose to distance themselves while Spike is an even blend between his personalities because he embraces both sides of himself. (Sorry if this is poorly worded or repetitive, just trying to add my perspective)"
buffy,3dxav6,thefunkygorilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"This is definitely one of the better arguments I've seen here. Makes more sense to me now. So basically each demon (we can assume are from hell) have their own personality that plays a part. Is this why Darla and Dru are very different? I mean I saw Darla as a human on Angel and she was very similar to demon Darla, Dru seems to just be crazy, not sure if she was as a human though, I don't think they explained that."
buffy,3dxav6,Zaiya53,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"So basically each demon (we can assume are from hell) have their own personality that plays a part.   A vampire is not a separate entity from the human they were before they were made into a vampire.They become a demon as part of the transformation, and the essence of the original sire infects and transforms all the descendants, similar to slayers.   The soul is stripped away as part of the transformation process.     Says Whedon, also from March 2001, ""A soul is the thing that separates a human from a demon. It's the thing that points you north instead of south, that makes your instinct to do good instead of to do bad."" ""Therefore a vampire can feel love. They can have all the whims and quandaries of a normal person, if they're a vampire or a demon, but their basic instinct is to create chaos and evil and destruction, instead of love and bonding and nurturing and stuff. That's the basic difference."" ""A lot of demons, like Spike, for example, are not that different from a lot of people we know. It's not cut-and-dried. He is capable of great love, but great love is usually a very selfish thing, but he's trying.""       Dru seems to just be crazy, not sure if she was as a human though, I don't think they explained that.       Darla:  ""What is she doing here? I thought you killed her.""   Angelus:  ""No.  Just her family.""   (He pushes Darla down on the floor and rolls on top of her.)   Dru (scooting back towards the wall):  ""Eyes like arrows - like-like needles.""   Angelus:  ""This one's special.  I have big plans for her.""  (He leans down to kiss Darla.)   Dru:  ""Snake in the woodshed.  Snake in the woodshed.  Snake in the woodshed!  Snake in the woodshed!""   (Darla rolls them over so she's now on top.)   Darla:  ""So are we going to kill her during, or after?""   Angelus sits up, startling her:  ""Neither.  We turn her into one of us. - Killing is so merciful at the end, isn't it?  The pain has ended.""   Darla:  ""But to make her one of us?  She's a lunatic.""   Angelus:  ""Eternal torment.  (Grabs a hold of Darla's arms and rolls them so he is back on top with her under him on the floor)  Am I learning?""   (Angelus starts to kiss Darla while Dru first laughs then cries.)        Angel:  I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire.  (turns back, but doesn't make eye contact) Drusilla was the worst. She  was... an obsession of mine. She was pure and sweet and chaste...  Buffy:  And you made her a vampire.  Angel:  First I made her insane. (looks at her) Killed everybody she  loved.

buffy,3dzuu9,TiffanyRing,6,Mon Jul 20 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's kinda a dead horse trying to essentially ""shit on"" the Twilight verse at this point. It's evident of how poorly executed the franchise was from the fact that nobody is talking about Twilight any-more. Ironically though, it seems to be the people who hate Twilight who are keeping the verse alive at this point, which is kinda weird hehe.   But onto the post.    Buffy is the strong independent lady, Bella is a damsel in distress.   Well.. Bella isn't so much a damsel in distress as she is a complete suicide lunatic. Buffy has to put herself in danger to protect the world. She makes every effort to actually protect those who aren't involved in the verse (which sometimes does backfire). Bella puts herself in danger because... I have no reason why. What's worse about Bella's character is that she always goes on about protecting people, yet has no concept she's not only putting them in danger, but if she were to die, she would be causing them a whole load of pain as well.   I think Buffy would not get along with Bella at all on any level. Bella is a self proclaimed introvert, who has no real ties to society at all. Whereas Buffy likes pop-culture and engaging in the normal things in life. Buffy sees normality as a gift and Bella sees it as a curse.    And I think Angel would kick Edwards ass. Sure Edward was able to run super fast and was strong but let's face it Spike or Angel/Angelus and even Willow (using her dark magic) would blow these losers out of the water!   Angel beating Edward? No idea really. But surely, yes :)  But here's the thing though...   Buffy is not a love story, Twilight is. The core elements of the two stories are completely different. And while Twilight (especially the movies) are very poor, it's kinda unfair to compare them, even if Buffy is superior in every facet. The movies show a lot of things that aren't in the books, because obviously, the books are all from Bella's POV (well, aside from the Jacob POV in is it Breaking Dawn???). They've only added in that action to fulfil the needs/wants of the fans. Buffy is really a story about coming of age and everything that entails.   I wish Joss Whedon made an updated Buffy movie, Twilight would look like pansy shit.   Buffy doesn't work in movie format, established by the Buffy movie made in 1992. Buffy is all about long revolving character arcs and on-going themes that are not suitable for movie. Even if Joss has been able to produce the film the way he wanted (which he wasn't able to), it still wouldn't work nearly as well in that format, as state by Joss himself.   I'll read/watch practically anything that involves Vampires. I started watching Buffy when I was 6 and it's been my favourite sub genre of Scifi ever since. So obviously, a massively mainstream story about Vampires, I did read Twilight. And while it does contain some absolutely shocking writing and also really horrifying social commentary (the books bleed Mormon values), let's just leave Twilight to die off and remained worried about the inevitable reboot that will surely be made in the next couple of decades   Sorry, I just don't have much opinion or thought on actual possibilities of cross-verse. What is wrong with Twilight and what Buffy does right? I have lots of opinions on :)"
buffy,3dzuu9,coolbeaNs92,3,Tue Jul 21 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"I was only thinking about Twilight when I was looking for the Buffy comics and one thing led to another and soon I was on some fanfiction about buffy vs twilight. It took me forever to get through all the Twilight movies when I watched them in the past .. and it was painful, something I will not do again maybe ever. I've never watched vampire diaries or anything to compare Buffy to in pop culture in a while.. maybe because I like the way vampires are portrayed in Buffy, to have them any different kind of ruins it for me haha"
buffy,3dzuu9,coolbeaNs92,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"I can get that for sure, and I feel the same. The books are better to be honest than the films, but still really really bad. The only thing I kind of enjoyed about them is that Edward is actually quiet the troll in the books, which can in parts be quiet funny.   Vampire Diaries is okay. I only managed to get to the second season before giving up and realising it wasn't for me. It wasn't terrible, I even enjoyed some parts, but not really my thing."

Yes, I'm that immature :)    I reserve the right to call out any books, movies and television shows for plot holes, misogyny and general stupidity.   One of the Twilighters? actually whined at me, ""How would you like it if someone made fun of something you like?"" My response (laughing internally) ""I was a 20 y.o. in the late nineties who hid the fact she watched Buffy to her friends/some family for almost 15 years. Guess why? If you're going to be a fan of something, fly your freak flag. But, expect some backlash. While they have no right to personally insult you, they have every right to voice their opinion about the thing you're a fan of.""   I think Spike and Angel would have killed Edward if given the chance. I would love to see Cordelia call out Bella for being a victim. I read the first two books and then I got worried my nose was going to crinkle permanently in disgust and gave up. I was all excited about the setting, now I just wish F.B.I. Agent Dale Cooper would have showed up and called out the Cullens for their lame cover story.  I used to be a big fan of all vampires, starting with Anne Rice. Then along came Buffy. I have tried to get into other vampire shows, movies and books over the years. I can't bring myself to do it anymore unless they were something I liked in high school (Anne Rice, Dracula mmmm Gary Oldman, Dark Shadows and The Lost Boys). Maybe I have become too cynical, or maybe vampires have been gutted to make them acceptable to the teenage masses.   I blame Joss for my cynicism, I can't stand vampire shows/books that take themselves too seriously. I demand an occasional joke or two. What is his quote? ""Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough, but then, for the love of God, tell a joke."" I agree with this completely and now demand it out of most of my shows.  I will continue to beat the Twilight horse until it is a bloody puddle. Then, I'll beat it some more.

When Buffy figures out Ampatas secret dead guy in her trunk, if she had a cell phone she could have called Xander and Willow like, don't trust Ampata! Instead of having to run all the way to the bronze, which gave the mummy girl enough time to mack on Jonathan and a little on Xander."

buffy,3dr2mr,DaddyCatALSO,2,Mon Jul 20 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"That would be bisexuality, whether the woman is with a man or not."
buffy,3dr2mr,longarmofmylaw,9,Sat Jul 18 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"Willow's sexuality, when you really look into it, is a bit of a tricky subject.  Firstly, you are right about the time period playing a part. The whole homosexual relationship was progressive already - with Joss fighting (and winning) to get the network to allow Willow and Tara to kiss onscreen. (And then struggling with where do you put it, how do you handle it appropriately without oversexualizing it, or making it a big thing - aka The Body.)  So, anyways, Willow loves a Tara, but she also loved (and still clearly cared for after their breakup) Oz. That's 1 man and 1 woman in next to each other in her little black book. So... she's bisexual. Right? (But, as with many things, it gets complicated)  And this, while not outright stated in the show, it is made pretty clear. Willow continually states that she loves Tara for Tara (as it should be). The gender doesn't matter.    David Fury:    Willow didn't TURN GAY. She fell in love with someone who happened to be the same sex.   [Emphasis mine]    Alyson Hannigan:   Right now, she is in love with Tara, who's female, but I don't know whether it means Willow's gay. In fact - that's what I want to know. I asked Joss and he said ""Well, she's open to new experiences.""   [Again, emphasis mine]  (She continues with ""But if it turns out that she is gay then it's my belief that it's just the same as me growing up liking boys. It's just the way I'm built and if Willow knows what she's attracted to and didn't act on it till college because she didn't feel comfortable with it, who am I to go against that?"" - so nothing was set in stone at this point [The Year of our Lord 2000 / Pre-S5] [Or ever really was...])    The important thing for me here is the focus on the writer's and actor's part that Willow doesn't really care for the sexuality, she is looking for a romantic connection, for love. (And in my opinion, this is the core of it all - it doesn't matter where you and your partner are on the LGBT&A scale(?) - what matters is if you love them. [And they you.])  I'm realizing now as I write this that you have not completed Season 5 (at least you had not at the time of your post) and I am unsure what else you have had spoiled, so I will discard the section of my thoughts that pertained to S6/S7 and will attempt to sum them up with this quote, which gets to the heart of the matter -   Joss Whedon:   ...at the same time you have people, the moment Tara appeared on the scene, saying, 'Why aren't they gay enough? They're not gay enough! You need to make them more gay.' They want to make a statement, they want to turn it into an issue right away.     If Willow declares herself as bisexual (and I don't think it is in the character's nature to make any declarations regarding her sexual preferences publicly anyways. Or ""decide"" at all.), that means she is NOT GAY. And that's a problem. (Sort of. Kinda. For some people.)  Cause here's the thing, you can argue that bisexuality is less accepted than homosexual relationships - and probably be right. I was speaking with my mother only a year ago, discussing same-sex relationships (I can't recall why...) and she admitted that she did not ""understand"" bisexual people. [And I remember how she looked - kinda ashamed, afraid to tell me that like I would judge her for that ""failure"".] The point is it is still an issue today. And the more specific point, and why I quote Joss above is this:  http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2011/03/new-report-highlights-discrimination-against-bisexuals-by-both-gays-and-straights/   Bisexuals experience high rates of being ignored, discriminated against, demonized, or rendered invisible by both the heterosexual world and the lesbian and gay communities. Often, the entire sexual orientation is branded as invalid, immoral, or irrelevant.   http://www.advocate.com/bisexuality/2014/06/02/13-things-never-say-bisexual-people (I apologize for the clickbait-esque title and style, but it still gets the point across... and was the first google result)   Despite all of the gains the LGBT community has made, bisexuals are still looked upon with confusion — or outright scorn — by gays, lesbians and straight people alike. From people asking me if I was ""full-blown gay yet"" to others questioning my motivations, I've probably heard it all.   The homosexual community does not necessarily treat the bisexual community well. (Now - 2011 and 2014 articles above - or in the 90's.) Willow and Tara became important to people (and organizations) in the lesbian community. So Joss had to pick his battles, to a certain extent, and Willow's sexuality is never explicitly discussed. We take what we get, and live with it. Live in it.*   *Love in it.    (The quotes from Fury, Hannigan, and Whedon came from here, which has some more snippets that are worth reading. Also, the information regarding The Body came from it's Wikipedia page - I leave navigation there as an exercise for the reader.)"

He's definitely better on his own and the other main characters in it are all amazing. You'll see a lot off Buffy cast in it and they're a lot better in Angel than they were in Buffy, IMO. :3"

Not sure if a college library would have it but a local library might. Used book stores would probably have them for pretty cheap as well (and not necessarily used, could be brand new overstock).   I bought all mine digital during Dark Horse sales. Still costs money but it's a lot cheaper than buying full price. :X"

buffy,3dr2mr,cgbrannigan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"So, the whole Willow sexuality thing aside ... The brilliance of the show is that these characters don't always make the ""right"" decisions, or the decisions we, the viewers think they should. They live, they do what they think is best, but they also make mistakes and then actually deal with the repercussions of those mistakes. When Angel made his first appearance, pop culture hadn't been inundated with teen fiction/romanticized vampire heart throbs. I hated Angel, too, especially because I couldn't stand the mushy mushy... But POW, the show hits you with this powerful metaphor of sex and relationships. I rewatch this show all the time, and yes in some ways it seems dated, but the overall themes and just humanity of the characters gets me every time. Even Buffy, who is the strongest, is vulnerable and can make mistakes. Ugh, I heart this show. Also, watching Angel the Series helps you get onboard the Angel train. And if you're a BAngel fan, there's that one heartbreaking ep, ""I Will Remember You."""

Well, how do you know that they're not just dreams?  BUFFY You're running to catch the bus naked? That's a dream. Army of vicious vampire creatures? That's a vision. Also, I was awake.   But I guess I would argue that Buffy only sees things related to the supernatural. Dru had a vision about regular miners having a regular accident. Which is probably not something a slayer would see.  But I like this idea as a twist."

buffy,3doe3f,greyspatter,25,Fri Jul 17 22:41:18 2015 UTC,Lies My Parents Told Me is one of my favorite episodes
buffy,3doe3f,enharet,26,Fri Jul 17 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"OMG I just watched it now! Poor Wood just got told by two slayers (basically) that ""the mission"" is more important than he is! That poor man!   No wonder he keeps looking for a relationship with a slayer. Being important to one is an issue for him! ... Geeze, Joss doesn't skimp on the whole Freudian-parental issues, does he?  E:typo"
buffy,3doe3f,lecherous_hump,15,Sat Jul 18 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"Loved Principal Wood, and never understood how more people didn't have issues with Spike. Even before Robin knew it was Spike who had killed his mother, he knew that Spike was a) a vampire and b) an asshole."
buffy,3doe3f,enharet,10,Sat Jul 18 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people did have problems with Spike over the years. Didn't they? I think pretty much everyone did, nearly straight through the end."
buffy,3doe3f,comradeKatze,9,Sat Jul 18 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"I was and will always be astounded at how easily the Scoobies accepted his return in season 7. Yes, they made the occasionally comment, but for the most part they shrugged it off."
buffy,3doe3f,Iokuas,9,Sat Jul 18 00:47:53 2015 UTC,I feel that  way about his acceptance after getting a chip. He should not have been let in. He should have been staked.  But after he's resouled I get a soft spot for him.
buffy,3doe3f,calgil,22,Sat Jul 18 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"The thing that confuses me: the Scoobies still hate on Spike post-chip, when he's stopped killing people.  Okay, that's reasonable- he stopped because he had to, not because he had a change of heart.  But they're pretty okay with Anya, who slew and punished people for 1000 years and never expresses any real remorse; she actually seems to remember her deeds quite fondly. Anya also didn't stop because she chose to, she just lost her power to do so. There's definitely a double standard in the way they're handled. Does it come down to human/ non human? Or Soul/ Souless?  Edited for spelling."
buffy,3doe3f,Iokuas,2,Sat Jul 18 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Anya is given a pass because she's a genuinely harmless person who was banging Xander. There's also the fact that unlike Spike she wasn't choosing to kill people, she was providing a demonic service. Anyanka was the gun, the people who asked for her services loaded it and pulled the trigger. Vengeance Demons are basically angry genies if you think about it, the people who make wishes are to blame."
buffy,3doe3f,calgil,10,Sat Jul 18 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"As we saw several times, Anyanka would deliberately interpret a wish to cause maximum damage even if it wasn't intended. The girl who was bullied by the frat guys certainly wasn't happy with the massacre that happened. Anyanka was way more than a gun, that's why D'Hoffryn valued her so highly. She made cruel and evil decisions."
buffy,3doe3f,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Jul 18 11:02:12 2015 UTC,"She was a demon. Demons never, ever take the easier, less painful, less evil route. She was evil, that much is completely undeniable. She also wasn't exactly in the best straights after being left at the altar, so at that point she went to far and as we all saw Buffy went to stop her. The fact that Anyanka was a shotgun as opposed to a handgun does not change the fact that she was granting wishes as opposed to just engaging in wanton violence as Spike did.   There's also the fact that she didn't actively try to murder the Scoobies, their friends, family and Angel when she was introduced to the series, while Spike did."
buffy,3doe3f,calgil,3,Sat Jul 18 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"If Anyanka was ANY sort of gun then the girl who wanted the frat boys to 'leave her alone' (essentially) was completely responsible for their deaths. Guns don't kill people, people do. But it wasn't her fault, she was just a hurt girl who wanted to feel better - never for anyone to die...as far as she was concerned that was never a possibility.  Anyanka was NOT a gun. She made decisions which killed people. If anything the 'wishers' were the gun - she used their pain to her own agenda."
buffy,3doe3f,lecherous_hump,2,Sat Jul 18 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think that's why the V3engance Demons exist, to do just that."
buffy,3doe3f,tlow0510,2,Sat Jul 18 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Just pointing out that they're not a mere tool, they're a cruel and fully responsible type of evil."

buffy,3doe3f,Upsidedownnightmares,8,Sat Jul 18 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"Spoilers: It would have been nice to have him in another series/main storyline not focused on Spike, since Spike steals the spotlight. As expected, Wood gets clowned by Spike. Wood really fails to understand that Spike and Nikki Wood dueled on that subway in New York.  One had to get rid of the other. That's how the game is played. Of course, Robin cannot look passed spike ganking his mother.  So his storyline concluded obviously.  It ended up being an elaborate plot to further Spiked development - as if he needed it. Spike is the most developed character in the series!    Aside: I love how Spike makes sure he gets back Nikkis coat in front of him. Spike gets some mojo back and demonstrates it's in his best interest to leave the past behind.  Wood looks pretty lame at this point."
buffy,3doe3f,oomellieoo,7,Sat Jul 18 01:52:00 2015 UTC,"I never cared for Principal Wood.  I don't know why.  His character just seemed ""bleh"".  I might need to watch it again to get your point of view."

I can always recognize her within an instant. Whereas in the season 8 Buffy comic books, I was struggling to quickly identify at various times, Riley, Willow, Oz, and Angel. I had to look at their hair colour, their clothing... But Faith? five by five"

Maybe more like I had a different appreciation for her character, but either way, Faith was awesome and I loved the dynamics between her and Buffy and the rest of the gang for that matter.   A spin-off after the last season of Angel could have been interesting, but trying to put together another spin-off while the other two shows were still in production would have probably made for some crazy writing and logistical problems. Either way, Faith was a well written and well acted character. She'll always be one of my favorites from the 'verse."

buffy,3dn962,barre_chord_reality,3,Fri Jul 17 21:47:43 2015 UTC,I liked Faith.  I'm going to say yeah because im almost out of Buffy/Angel to watch and a faith series would've added on.

He has done some good things, but he did them because of Buffy.  He's obsessed with her (I think it's a big stretch to call it ""love"", no matter what he says) and while that obsession does lead him to do some very admirable things, it also leads him to do a lot of really disgusting things too. He lurks outside her house, steals her clothes and stuff for his creepy little shrine, kidnaps her, and refuses to accept a ""no"" every single time she tells him she isn't interested or tries to break things off with him. And remember that pretend conversation he has with the mannequin in ""Triangle""? That's not how a good person acts to someone they genuinely care about, it's how assholes act to women who they feel entitled to get attention from.   None of those things are quite as bad as the rape scene, but my point is that their relationship (such as it was) was incredibly screwed up and unhealthy from the start. You may not have noticed it until the rape scene, but it was there the whole time."

buffy,3doifs,Bwyd,2,Sat Jul 18 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"He is an evil soulless monster who has tortured, raped and murdered countless others. Just because he's been muzzled and is obsessed with Buffy doesn't make him good."
buffy,3doifs,TheCrushSoda,2,Sat Jul 18 10:14:39 2015 UTC,Well he is a soulless monster so ya know. Angel did way worse things than when he was soulless. Not that was Spike did was okay but it was the lesser of two evils. Plus Spike immediately went to get help where as Angel was perfectly content being the worlds biggest cocksucker
buffy,3doifs,3raserE,4,Sat Jul 18 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Even before this, you're not supposed to root for Spike and Buffy as a couple. When they have sex outside the Doublemeat Palace and again at the Bronze, there's an unhealthy degree of coercion. Spike is obsessed with Buffy--I wouldn't call it love--and as u/MercuryChaos pointed out, does some disgusting things. And Buffy is so full of self-loathing that she lets Spike do it.  The thing about the rape scene is that Spike doesn't realize at first that Buffy genuinely doesn't want to have sex with him. When she pushes him off, he has a horrified expression on his face because he realizes it. Their whole relationship was based on him pushing it and Buffy playing hard-to-get over and over, which is why the bathroom scene happened the way it did.  Their relationship was born out of self-hatred and obsession, not love. It's not something to root for."
buffy,3doifs,wolfsrun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna just jump on the ""keep watching"" bandwagon. Spike does a lot of horrible things at this point but he doesn't have a soul. It does get better."

Just for fun the episode where Jonathan is the best at everything."
buffy,3dkon4,Royal_Hofner,15,Fri Jul 17 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"The lack of music in this episode gives it that extra realistic feel that just breaks you. Honestly, one of the most brilliant directing decisions of all time."
buffy,3dkon4,LoLjoux,4,Fri Jul 17 10:12:48 2015 UTC,That was one of the first things I noticed about the episode.
buffy,3dkon4,ca1cifer,30,Fri Jul 17 11:29:30 2015 UTC,"The thing about the deaths in Buffy or Angel compared to the deaths in GoT is that for me, the deaths in Buffy seem more relatable. It hits far closer to everyone's daily life. GoT deaths are very shocking and unexpected, for sure, but I don't reeeeaaally expect myself to experience anything like that. Whereas the losses in Buffy reflect so much of the losses in my life and other people's, that it just seems so much more human, more real. Your loved one being chopped by swords is not a daily existential fear."

Joyce pretty obviously, since that was the whole point of her death.  But even with Jenny, it's not that she gets murdered by a vampire in a crazy mystical scenario that would never happen in real life.  She gets murdered because Buffy's crazy ex wants to get revenge.  And even if most of us are fortunate enough to not have exes who are that crazy, it's definitely still a thing that happens in real life.  Compare this with say S7 spoiler:.

buffy,3dn2kb,venom8599,4,Fri Jul 17 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"Red solo cups are just disposable cups. While they're sometimes associated with drinking because of movies about house parties or frat keg parties, they're just cups that are cheap and disposable. Most bars serve actual drinks in real glasses, or bottles.   In many places they have bars/clubs that admit 18 year olds because they're music venues, typically while using a hand stamp, mark on the back of the hand, or wristbands to determine who can or can't be served alcohol."
buffy,3dn2kb,Sammyboy616,2,Sat Jul 18 06:43:50 2015 UTC,"They're definitely not getting served earlier in the series, but it get's a bit confused later.  In Family where Dawn says that she has to have a stamp on her hand to stop her from drinking, because she's underage.  But when she says that only losers drink alcohol, the rest of the gang look around uncomfortably, like they're drinking.  Even though they all (apart from Giles and maybe Riley) should be underage at that time."

There's the difference haha XD The gang had already been to college parties and probably spent a few nights puking their guts out, regardless of whether they were of age or not. I mean, it's college. Of course they drink. XD I would imagine that they either sneak their own booze into the Bronze, or they don't drink in the Bronze at all for fear of getting caught."
buffy,3dn2kb,bionut876,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. If they are 18 at the end of season 3, they should linearly be 21 at the end of season 7.  I think that the show intentionally fuzzes everyone's age halfway through season 5. Heck, they all start acting like 30 year olds by season 7. (And Cordelia on Angel? she's going out to clubs with her gang right out of high school!)  But I definitely agree that I assumed they were drinking out of those solo cups when they technically shouldn't be allowed, if the time/ages weren't being blurred.  Edit: they may, of course, all have gotten fake IDs."

buffy,3dlj15,SongOfTheGreen,2,Fri Jul 17 06:25:33 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Hopefully it will go well.
buffy,3dl4na,Goldar85,9,Fri Jul 17 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that while Joss was supposed to be making an awesome send-off for his series (which, as you mentioned, Season 5 proved he could have done) he was off making Firefly."
buffy,3dl4na,jayman419,8,Fri Jul 17 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. This is why the final season of Buffy was a bit of a let down, but the final season of Angel is freakin brilliant. It's because Firefly had been canceled by that time, and Buffy was already over, so by that time Angel was his main focus.  I still have a hard time watching season 7. Thematically, it's really interesting. I like seeing Buffy's transformation into a leader. And there are some brilliant episodes. But ultimately it felt like the potentials took over the show, and there just wasn't time to explore the characters we know and love (namely Buffy, Wllow and Xander).  Plus it feels like they kind of villainized Giles a bit. Why does he have to be such a jerk to Buffy? His attempt to distract Buffy while Robin tried to kill Spike - what a horrible thing for the character to do.  One thing i actually did like about season 7: Did anyone else watch the show when it aired and remember thinking Giles was actually The First? The buildup to that was pretty awesome.  Plus Selfless is one of the greatest episodes ever.  Edit: Spike's story in s7 is also amazing."
buffy,3dl4na,BlackMoonWolf3113,3,Fri Jul 17 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"Most of us that I know did, and I was only going off spoilers and discussions at the Beta and whedonesque, since I was a TV hodad at the time (living in a mission, so not surprising, but using library computers.) I'm sure that Dr. Joss And His ""Bunche"" were thinking about doing that. I don't completely believe the rumor that they had definitely decided to have Giles die form the ax and be the First, and they only changed their minds when they realized the fans had already figured it out.  I like to wank it as  that Giles had a major demon lord hanging around him since ""Tabula Rasa."" It didn't quite possess him but did send him nasty messages and twist his emotions. Even his killing the Bringer so abruptly was part of it."
buffy,3dl4na,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Jul 17 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest letdown for me was Dawn. She'd always been one of my favorite characters and twice there's a tease and a letdown. First when it turns out to be Amanda in ""Potential"" and then with the amulet meant for someone more than human but in possession of a soul.  There were quite a few times where Dawn got close to a level up during the series (I forget the episode but remember her helping Buffy fight some baddies in a pit)... and don't get me wrong, she kicked some pretty serious ass in the finale. I'm glad she was more than just bait. I just wish she'd been more than that. Like... ""not bait"" isn't saying very much.  But I think if I had to pick a favorite episode in an otherwise lackluster season, I'd go with ""Touched"". Watching Faith try to take Buffy's place (plus getting to see her put Kennedy in her place) was pretty satisfying. Plus a little bit of Caleb yumminess, Spike getting angry, and Buffy going from sad to pissed to powerful... it had everything that the entire season should have. Fulfilled arcs, logical character development, telling Kennedy to shut up, and ass kicking from all sides against all comers."
buffy,3dl4na,jayman419,2,Fri Jul 17 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"I think the fighting in the pit you are referring to was the fight at the end of Grave, the Season 6 finale."

buffy,3dl4na,crazyjaf,4,Fri Jul 17 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"BEWARE... SPOILERS AHEAD!  I loved season 7, and the Slayer potentials made complete sense. I don't get any of the hate. The atmopshere was similar to seasons 1-3, but our characters matured. In seasons 4 and 5, our characters were dealing with becoming adults. Season 6 really forced them to overcome their issues and mature. Now, season 7 has them being adults dealing with the typical supernatural nonsense in their lives while knowing their places in the world.   Buffy has moved on from dying, coming back from Heaven, and finding a way to use her 'protector' skills by becoming a student advisor. She's even allowed Dawn to participate in the reindeer games.  Dawn has become less whiny and annoying. She gets to be involved and actually becomes quite helpful throughout the season. I really loved how they distinguished the similarity between her and Xander, being on the outside looking in.  Xander has FINALLY gotten over Buffy choosing Angel, or even Spike, over him. He realizes he's messed up with Anya in season 6 and he's accepted his fate as a construction worker even leading his own team in the reconstruction of Sunnydale High. His loss of an eye refers back to being the outsider looking in. He really took a beating this season, which I think he deserves after the previous season.  Willow has evolved, but she's also integrated the things she hated about herself. Dark Willow mocked how weak and nerdy Regular Will was in her early years. But we see her now reminiscent of her old self, even prior to season 4. She's combined her doubting self and confident self in a version we all love. I don't totally agree with the way they handled her throughout the season (knocking her out all the time), but I guess if you don't know how to be creative (and I'm saying this passive aggressively because this show has been incredibly creative through the first 6 seasons) then there isn't much else you can do. I also disagree with how she got with Kennedy, but I can see how she got involved. I'm thankfuly they're no longer together in the comics.  Giles gets thrown to the side this season due to Anthony Stewart Head leaving the series as a regular in Season 6. But I feel he has ran his course during the series. He's the father figure, the wise old Wizard with the sage advice. However, I do like how they handled Buffy and Giles' relationship this season, showing that Buffy no longer needs his advice. She's her own person now.  Spike has always been volatile and this season he's at his most peaceful, despite being a murderous Sleeper. But with a soul, Spike feels more at home in his skin than any other season. He's the supportive boyfriend that Buffy always wanted/needed, so that's why I will always been Team Spike despite his attempted rape in season 6.  Anyanka hasn't really changed anymore than usual during this season, but she's still the same, sweet demented Anya she always has been in previous seasons. If anything, I'd say she accepted her humanity more this season than any other, per her speeches towards the end of the season.  I miss Tara. I wish she had come back for ""Conversations with Dead People"", but I would want her to call Cassie out on being a fake. Basically, Tara, a good ghost, telling Willow to see through the First's facade as playing Cassie. But that's me.  The Slayer Potentials weren't any different from Buffy being a teenager. So again, I don't see the hate there. After being brought back from the dead, Buffy affected the Slayer line, allowing the First to make a play. It wasn't far-fetched or out of lines for the show. If I have a complaint, it's that the big temple in which Buffy finds the last Guardian. All this time she's roamed the many graveyards and we've never once seen this really odd, out of place Egyptian temple? Also, we have the Guardian to give us a cryptic message only to be killed seconds later? Deus ex Machina if I ever saw it, but at least Joss admitted to it."
buffy,3dl4na,ShushImAtWork,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:37 2015 UTC,I guess that Sunnydale has lots of weird tombs (we've seen others) so she didn't pay attention before.
buffy,3dl4na,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Excellent synopsis. I'll bookend what you're saying about the whole Potentials thing by adding that the concept of the Potentials and Buffy changing the Slayer paradigm was great, but the execution was a bit muddled.   I think they were trying to cram too much into the last season, and got sidetracked with having an Andrewcentric episode, which I thought was a great episode, but also caused the other episodes to get a bit cramped.   Had there been a two part, or two hour finale, a lot of the other issues could have been fleshed out a bit more. I still think it's a solid season with some great concepts that just didn't get executed well enough."
buffy,3dl4na,barre_chord_reality,7,Fri Jul 17 20:41:34 2015 UTC,I loved the potentials. Season 7 was awesome.
buffy,3dl4na,apocalypsenowandthen,2,Fri Jul 17 09:36:31 2015 UTC,"I still like Season 7, though it feels different from the other seasons. More rushed, less cohesive. Great moments, but the plotting just doesn't feel as tight. One thing has always bothered me, though.  The Season 7 assertion that the First was able to attack because Buffy ""destabilized the Slayer line"" never made sense to me.  Buffy already interrupted the slayer line. She died and came back in Season 1, and two slayers have been active at once since Season 2. I'm assuming that another slayer wasn't called after Buffy's death in Season 5 because she's not the ""current"" slayer anymore - Kendra was, and then Faith.   If it's her death and resurrection that made the line unstable, it should have been unstable since Season 1. Maybe it took that long for the First to build power? We know he tried to snake his way into the world all the way back in Season 3. But the show makes it pretty clear that the Scoobies feel it was her resurrection in Season 6 that made the First powerful enough to make a move. I just can't figure out why it was then, and not before."
buffy,3dl4na,isocline,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"The theory tends to be that the powerful spell resurrecting ""the ""champion of the people"" somehow plugged buffy back into the succession. Not too sure of that myself."

buffy,3dl4na,oomellieoo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like the quality in Season 7 sort of follows an upside-down bell curve as it progresses, being both on of the worst or best seasons depending on where you are in it.  It's pretty good at the start, and then starts to loose a bit of steam bottoming out a few episodes after the potentials arrive.  After that it picks up again, getting majorly better with the arivals of both Caleb and Fait.  Climaxing in Chosen, in my opinion the best season finale."

Anaya handed out undeserved death like it was cheap candy, and got off on it - but since she has grown dependent on Xander and the Scoobies, she has to feign a lack of understanding about it.  Then there was the time where she told Buffy that she wasn't the Slayer because she had earned it, that she was simply given the powers - never mind the fact that Buffy had been given a burden and died twice - Anya, the serial killer, thought she somehow had some moral high ground on Buffy - what a bitca!

buffy,3djs68,clea_vage,14,Thu Jul 16 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"The first season of Buffy is a bit of a slow burn, so when things pick up in season two, you'll be in for a great ride. A few things to consider when watching the first season is that it was a mid-season replacement on a rinky dink network with next to no budget to speak of.   The fact that it made it to the second season and improved in the leaps and bounds that it did is nothing short of a miracle. The great dialogue and witty writing kept me hooked on the first season and I'm very thankful that I stuck with it."
buffy,3djs68,barre_chord_reality,17,Thu Jul 16 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"In the first season it feels like Whedon was unsure how he wanted the series to develop, so it's very much monster-of-the-week, but the series really hits it's stride in season 2. I would say keep watching untill s2 ep14, and if you aren't hooked by then Buffy is not for you."

If I were you, I would lay off the Buffy for a week or so, then go back to it. It most certainly does get better after season 1, and it gets into some pretty dark stuff later on. Best of luck!"
buffy,3djs68,BackOfTheHearse,6,Thu Jul 16 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"A few of my friends highly recommend it - we have the same taste in shows, so I trust their judgment! I'll take your advice and take a break for a few days. I forcefully binge-watched the first 7 episodes waiting to get hooked haha."
buffy,3djs68,TBoarder,5,Thu Jul 16 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"Though I wouldn't recommend skipping any, within the remaining episodes of Season 1 following Angel (episode 7), there will be an episode that is downright terrible.  In fact, it's the very next episode.  Everyone knows it's awful, everyone laughs about it.  In fact, you will probably find few diehard fans that will defend it aside from a comedic standpoint.  So don't let that discourage you more than you seem to already be.  Watch it.  Laugh.  Possibly have a beer or two.  Yes, it's worse than the one with the Praying Mantis.  Following that, you have this ahead of you (in chronological order):   An episode that's okay, a bit high on cheese factor.  But there's a good character introduction. An episode that has some really good moments and ideas mixed in with some less-than-stellar moments.  But you can get an idea of the sorts of things they want to be able to do with the show (and get to do later.) An episode that really helps flesh out a certain character and somewhat introduces a concept that is used in a later season in more detail.  Also has a key moment leading up to the finale. And the big one.  The absolute best episode of the season.  While it still has some of the Season 1 style of campiness that gets modified and refined later in the show, it also has one of my top ten Buffy moments from the entire series.  That moment gives a real window into what the series will become."

You have to understand that it was a mid-season replacement for a show and thus has no budget to speak of.  If I recall correctly, it only has less than 15 episodes though. I'm sure that is not too much of a chore. I think I speak for everyone when I say that IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER IN SEASON 2/3."
buffy,3djs68,pinetree505,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"The first season is incredibly campy and kind of childish. As Buffy grows so does the show. The season finale of season 1 almost reprises buffy into a darker season 2. You will hit season arc antagonist, and Joss is known for foreshadowing seasons ahead with hints of whats to come. They will make sense towards the end, and you will start to love these characters. i introduced a male adult friend of mine to Buffy for the first time, and we just made a drinking game out of season 1 because it was too cheesy to take seriously. But by the end he was so in love with the show and ready to rewatch. You are almost at the end of season1. I'd say hold on. Each season gets more grown up and a little darker and as you get used to each character and grow to like them they take them in interesting crossroads, that typically make sense given everything you've learned."

And given the way Buffy was shot, the only way to do it is to ruin the framing by cropping it top and bottom (and ironically reducing the fidelity) or going back to the original stock and... ruin the framing by showing camera men and stage hands that were originally just on the edge of the frame. (To be fair, you could do it in HD properly, but it would still have to be in 4:3 aspect ratio. And there are still some early episodes where the original footage itself was poorly recorded and there's really no fixing the screw ups by the film crew.)  Ugh, you kids and your HD.

I thought this was just because Angelus was exceptionally evil even by vampire standards. Back in season two the Judge said he could sense some amount of humanity in all the vampires that were in the room when he was reassembled (including Spike and Dru) but not in Angelus.   Also: when Angelus got his soul put back, there was nothing holding him back from being as bad as he was capable of being. If the same thing had happened to Spike then he might have had a more noticeable contrast, but but instead he got a kind of transition period where he was held back somewhat by the chip (and then by his infatuation with Buffy.)"

Literally one of the first thing Xander said when Angel became evil was ""Well, I hate to say I told you so... but I told you so."" And he was the same way when he brought Faith to kill A in S3. He's an annoying freaking child.  But then when Anya kills people and Buffy needs to do her duty, Xander is all (basically) 'no, wahhh. I'm special. It's fine.'  I like the guy from S4 onwards, but damn if he isn't annoying. I did not agree with him in Becoming."
buffy,3dceia,FuschiaKnight,4,Wed Jul 15 04:52:44 2015 UTC,Oh I understand that he is a complete asshole when it comes to Angel but I can't argue with the points he uses in Becoming.
buffy,3dceia,FuschiaKnight,8,Wed Jul 15 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"I think even by S2 Angel had proven that he is a very powerful asset for fighting evil. He saved their lives plenty of times.   Why shouldn't they try to restore his soul? If it doesn't work, then they can kill him anyway. It's not like they would let him go if it failed.  He's not getting special treatment for being a vampire, he'd be getting special treatment because he had been one of the best fighters against evil they'd seen. How useful had Xander ever been? Like, ever? They even made an entire episode about how useless he is in S3 (sidenote, The Zeppo is AMAZING)."
buffy,3dceia,AngelAmongUs,14,Wed Jul 15 05:18:22 2015 UTC,"How useful had Xander ever been? Like, ever?    He is the only reason Buffy is alive.    Xander:  Mind if I come in? (comes in)  Angel:  (closes the door) Make yourself at home.  Xander:  She's gone.  Angel:  Whadaya mean?  Xander:  Buffy, she's gone to fight the Master.  Angel:  He'll kill her.  Xander:  Rumor has it. Only we're not gonna let it happen.  Angel:  Well, what do you propose we do about it?  Xander:  Look, I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground,  right? Take me to him.  Angel:  You're way outta your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before  you can even breathe. If you're lucky.  Xander:  How can I say this clearly?  He holds up a cross. Angel growls. Xander advances toward him, and he  backs off until he falls onto the couch.  Xander:  I don't like you. At the end of the day, I pretty much think  you're a vampire. (lowers the cross) But Buffy's got this big old yen  for you. She thinks you're a real person. And right now I need you to  prove her right.  Angel:  You're in love with her.  Xander:  Aren't you?   All of his interactions with vampires had been very negative up to that point.  One of his best friends became one, who he ended up killing.  While Angel does help some, he never fully integrated with the group, remaining a shadowy figure who often gave half answers when asked a question.  Xander does have his faults, but he doesn't have more or worse ones than Angel (with a soul) does."

He chose to continue slaying vampires even after Buffy had left town. He had no powers but he (along with the gang) chose to continue slaying.  The Zeppo was strange because it pointed out how Xander wasn't as useless as people thought he was. If it weren't for Xander the gang would be dead in The Zeppo too. He is underestimated."
buffy,3dceia,DaddyCatALSO,8,Wed Jul 15 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think people give Xander way too little credit.  Was he jealous?  Sure!  Was he wrong?  Well, let's look at it from a more practical perspective:  The first time Angel shows up, he's some creepy guy in an alley, obviously in his 20s, who knows who Buffy is and what's going on.  Okay, um, weird.  But he seems down to help.  When Buffy starts falling all over herself about this guy, though?  Hell, if I was Willow I would be worried.  16 year old very emotionally vulnerable Chosen One falling for a 20-something guy who's kind of condescending, super cryptic, and likes to follow her down dark alleys?  Yeah.  Creep factor is up to 11.  Then we find out he's a freaking vampire.  Um, if being 27 or whatever was a problem before, don't you think being 227 should be a deal breaker?  Turns out Angel is genuinely a Good Guy.  Which makes it even harder to point out the fact that Buffy and Angel's relationship is totally unhealthy for a teenage girl.  So if Xander expresses his dubiousness, it is written off as jealousy and pettiness, which just makes him angry.  It underlines the fact that they trust the judgement of this strange monster man over his, which is pretty depressing for him.  So he starts to hate him even more.  But here's the clincher: in the very first episode, in Xander's very first experience with the supernatural, his best friend turns into a vampire, attacks them, and Xander ends up having to kill him.  Don't you think that would harbor a little mistrust for creatures of the night?  I love Buffy/Angel.  I do.  But I can acknowledge that their relationship was horribly unhealthy, and that Angelus was a monstrosity that needed to be put down."
buffy,3dceia,Shark_Lover1,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"The only difference I can see that ought to happen if Xander'd been honest would be Buffy would make keeping Angelus away from the statue a higher priority.

All it would take to let the beast out is one little moment of happiness or some Spell Caster who knows what they are doing. Can you imagine if Faith had been successful in getting rid of Angels soul in season 3. It would have gone completely different and I'm quite positive that someone important to the group  (whether it was a Scooby or not) would have died at his hands just like Jenny did. Now I agree that Xander has done alot of stupid dick moves, but so has everyone else in the show and so has everyone who has watched the show. If Xander would have told Buffy what Willow was doing, Buffy could have gotten hurt even worse or killed trying to save Angel. And really, no one could deal with how much he would brood then, would we?"
buffy,3dceia,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've always wondered why they didn't try to restore the souls of as many vampires as they could.  Then they'd have had an army of good vamps with superstrength to help them fight whatever apocalypse was happening next."
buffy,3dceia,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jul 16 15:08:32 2015 UTC,Yup I asked this question too. There are many vampires out there that they could re-ensoul. Some of which they know like Harmony. They could have re-ensouled Spike themselves years ago.
buffy,3dceia,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:47 2015 UTC,Would her soul make any difference to Harmony?
buffy,3dceia,GirlNumber20,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:19 2015 UTC,Yeah she wouldn't have to kill people. Also in Graduation Day she sort of said to Willow that she wishes they could have been friends so she wasn't as heartless as thought.
buffy,3dceia,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"Actually I agree, between that and the way Wishverse Harmony acted. (In fact Willow's ""tortured me for 10 years"" make s me wonde r if she and Harm only first met towards the end of second grade, or if they'd been friends before and Harmony changed.)  It's just with her self-centeredness and lack of self-control I have doubts about whether Harmony, even with a soul, could resist the demonic urges very often"

buffy,3dceia,MercuryChaos,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"The two we see receive their souls, Angel and Spike, spent a great deal of time mourning their past crimes.  Angel spent decades; Spike spent weeks in the basement of Sunnydale High.  So it seems from that evidence that, no matter how shitty they were as human beings, receiving their souls back gave them a great deal of empathy, regret and remorse for their past actions.  No reason to think that wouldn't be true of anyone else."

buffy,3dceia,ShushImAtWork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"I thought the ""true happiness"" thing was a Gypsy curse?  Spike with a soul had no such clause.  They could have had a rule to only ensoul vamps who had been fairly decent people in their human life, like that completely awesome psych major who headshrinks Buffy.  He's one of my favorite minor characters and I wish like hell they'd kept him around!"
buffy,3dceia,oomellieoo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"My theory/headcanon is that the demon trials don't have the same restrictions as Angel's curse because you have to voluntarily go through with them, which is enough of a restriction all by itself — except for Spike, none of the vampires in the series ever seem interested in getting their souls back. So if they were going to be re-ensouled it'd have to be against their will, and if doing that were easy it would kind of break the story."

There was a video of a panel with Nicholas Brendon (and Eliza Dushku and others) a few years back where a woman at the microphone went off on how she hated Xander and even though she was talking about the character it was oddly personal. Nick left the stage and the woman then began to mock him, asking if she'd hurt his feelings. Vvvvvery awkward. So horrible.  If I find the link I'll share it -- it is a spectacular cringefest."

buffy,3d1ogg,rachiedoubt,10,Mon Jul 13 08:23:45 2015 UTC,"One of the best Whedony articles I've read in a while. I'm overwhelmed by all the information!  So stoked about Twist     Joss Whedon’s Twist, a six-issue series that he’s putting out next year from Dark Horse Comics. It “basically deals with the most important moral question facing us, which is, why isn’t there a Victorian Female Batman?”   Also I really DO need 'Muffy the Zombie Fighter' in my life."
buffy,3d1ogg,AngryWizard,4,Sun Jul 12 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"One of the best Whedony articles I've read in a while. I'm overwhelmed by all the information!   Yeah, I was excited because it's one of the first ones in a while that I've seen that wasn't just a rehash of things we've heard before. Different interview, same questions and all that. That's one of the best things about conventions, I think, is that fans know what information they don't have yet in a way that random reporters just don't. They (we) are able to ask better questions because of it. For every repeat question I've heard at con related Q & A panels, there always seems to be a roughly equal number of new, interesting questions that I'm actually hungry for an answer to!  Twist is going to be AWESOME!"

buffy,3d3eov,wr3nKingston,2,Mon Jul 13 05:12:17 2015 UTC,"Isn’t Buffy suposed to sense vampires?   It's a holdover from the movie. Movie!Buffy got menstrual cramps around vampires, and yes, that is an accurate indication of the film's level of humor. I think it was mentioned once or twice very early in the TV show, but then dropped for kinda obvious reasons -- even a less, um, earthy vampire sense would have undermined dramatic tension. Angel's reveal is a good example.   I still do NOT understand the Bronze. Do they sell alcohol and just don’t ID?   There used to be bars that would admit the underage, just not directly sell them alcohol. (Of course, this was widely recognized as a pretense, but people didn't take teen drinking very seriously at all until the late 1980s. There wasn't even a federally mandated drinking age until 1984.) I think Joss is showing his age a little with his portrayal of The Bronze. Although maybe as a music venue they could get away with it? I dunno."
buffy,3d3eov,stillnotking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:55:29 2015 UTC,There are lots of bars like that even today--especially in smaller cities that are mostly music venues. They admit underage kids but don't sell them alcohol. Usually they either give the 21+ people wristbands and/or make a stamp/mark/X on the back of the hand of underage kids.

Give the girl some heads up! Its a safety thing.   And thank you for the insight on the bronze! I feel like now a days they would just clarify its a Bar and Grill so everyone can be there.

buffy,3d0yc5,pober,3,Mon Jul 13 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"Seasons 5 and 6 were my favorites (#1 was 6, #2 was 5). They work especially well in conjunction, because they're polar opposites as far as Big Bads. I think The Gift is my favorite episode of Buffy, even above The Body and OMWF (the musical episode, which you're about to get to.) It took me a long time to recover.  I second what /u/Engardia said: Season 6 is going to be painful. It was a different feel for the show, which I think was consistent with the characters growing up and dealing with the aftermath of everything that happened in S5. It's polarizing among fans, but I personally rank it as the best season (narrowly above 5).  Dark Willow is...interesting. You have a while to go at this point before you reach that, though, and I'm not going to spoil anything here.    All of the main characters I feel are now a working team.   At first I laughed at this, then I felt vaguely like crying. Season 6 is an emotional rollercoaster.   Keep posting as you go through or PM me with your thoughts on the show at any point. I love to talk about this stuff."
buffy,3d0yc5,Tvfann12,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input! I'll probably be posting my thoughts soon, think I'm going to watch this season pretty quick, looks like Angel may have to wait again.."
buffy,3d0yc5,mischalecter,3,Sun Jul 12 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting you say that. Towards the middle of 6 and into 7 I found myself wanting to watch Angel more, but I also found myself sticking around for longer sessions when I watch Buffy. I've been watching along with Joss' ""Watchers Guide"" and taking some liberties with episodes in black."
buffy,3d0yc5,Tvfann12,2,Sun Jul 12 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"Glad you're liking Angel. It just keeps getting more and more insane as it goes along (in a good way).   Buffy S5 is extremely watchable. I almost watched the whole thing straight through first watch. It really feels like one big story instead of scattered episodes that loosely tie in to the season narrative (c.f. S1, S2). Really, there's only one one-off episode: Triangle. The rest of the episodes flow smoothly from one to the next.   Willow going all revengy on Glory was one of my favourite parts of the season.   I'm surprised you liked Glory so much after not really liking the Mayor, but honestly, who could not like Glory? She's the best.  Good thing you're not ashamed of tears! You will need them more than ever now that you are into the final two seasons! Personally, S5 was the first time I shed tears (several times) watching a TV show, or well, anything else for that matter. The Body, Tough Love, and The Gift were the most emotional for me.   The Body was so well done and real. All the emotions that the characters feel are conveyed so well by the actors that you have to feel what they are feeling. Their acting is even more appreciated when you realise there are no musical cues to tell the audience that this is a sad moment. All that emotion comes from the on-screen action. Plus, unlike previous emotional moments, the direction dedicates enough camera time to force the viewers into the scene. It's raw and you aren't granted emotional reprieve with the scene changing too soon.   BuffyBot continues the tradition of insiders being oblivious to imposters (Vamp Willow, Faith, Dawn).   If you've seen the first couple of episodes of S6, I'll just say hang on tight. You're in for a roller coaster. S6 basically continues everyone's stories to their logical destinations, which I appreciated, because it's really well-written."

Vampirism is basically a metaphor for sex, and throughout the series they make all kind of references to vampires in general (and Spike in particular) not making a lot of distinction between sex and violence. His interest/obsession with Buffy originally came from wanting to kill her, and when the chip took that option away (or at least, made it a lot less appealing) his goal went from biting to sex."
buffy,3d0iaa,MercuryChaos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:56:45 2015 UTC,It's amazing. They took this character who really had nothing to do and then found something that isn't just interesting but did it in a way that makes perfect sense and feels like the only way it could've gone.

The Watcher's Council seems to have very little information on a connection between Angel and Spike. Even the information they do have on Spike is proven to be inaccurate several times in the show.   Buffy:  (picks up the picture) Who's this?  Giles:  Um, she's called Drusilla, a sometime paramour of Spike's. She  was killed by an angry mob in Prague.  Buffy:  Well, they don't make angry mobs like they used to, 'cause this  girl's alive. I saw her with Angel."
buffy,3d0iaa,SongOfTheGreen,12,Mon Jul 13 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"This episode is so pinnacle for establishing some character points and relationship dynamics!  I almost passed it up as a yawn, but upon re-watching, I am noticing how important it was:   Snyder is really getting his inner antagonist on, here.  This is where it becomes clear that he is going out of his way to keep Buffy down.  He isn't evil; just a dick. Spike's arrival is so dramatic and with style.  It speaks volumes about the differences between him and The Anointed.  The destruction of the sign and Spike's entrance in Sunnydale will be eclipsed during the next season in Lover's Walk. Dru's introduction is fantastic.  She is shaman, maniacal, and on the edge of complete insanity.  I love that they show us this Drusilla and then gradually tease out how she became this way over the rest of the series (and in Angel). As Spike watches Buffy dancing at The Bronze, I realize that his obsession really does begin right here.  At first, I think it was just another Slayer-kill to put a notch in his headboard, but as he continues to fail in this it will consume him for a very long time. Xander's search through Buffy's bag is hilarious; his shock and terror at discovering the tampon is such a subtle indicator of the fear the genders have of each other in youth, but it conveys the awkward so perfectly. Spike: ""You die.""  Here we have a new foe archetype to learn about.  The Master was all ritual and tradition.  The Anointed a barely effective puppeteer.  But Spike is a different breed; ruthless and with swagger, but he is principled.  He breaks rules (""I couldn't wait until Saturday..."") but he likes a challenge and a scene.  As we see later this season with another new enemy, there are far more unconscionable and wicked forms of evil... Dru with dolls, Victorian furniture, lace; she creates this razor's edge between innocence and cruelty.  Particularly when you find out what has been done to her, do you blame her for being so dark?  This is a marvelous character because it describes what she could have been (as a person) and has sunken to (as a demon).  This, this is the tragedy of the curse of the vampire. Spike's love and respect for Dru is iconic.  He drops vamp-face in her presence, caring for her in a tender way that is surprising, considering what we learn of his ruthlessness. The Scoobies are finding their groove.  The support, the childish in-fighting, jokes, romantic hints. Snyder is terrified.  I love that Buffy can control the situation by being the most rational of mind.  And Joyce, who proves where such wonderful power and spirit comes from in this Slayer.  In the end, this is huge, because Joyce sees (and respects) that her daughter is becoming an adult and realizes that Buffy has problems she's trying to handle, too. Angel's farce using the uncomprehending Xander as bait (of course!  Who else would it be?).  This creates joke fodder and keeps riding on the extremely lopsided triangle that exists here. Giles' insecurity about Jenny's reaction to his life and her silent smile and acceptance are beautiful.  Her arm through his says, ""I am with you"" and sets up the horror that comes later. They tease Snyder's connection and awareness of the dark things that go on in Sunnydale.  It gets a few moments of credence but we never really get to see it pay off, which is a shame. Spike's changing of the guard is as dramatic at the end as his arrival in the beginning.  He is a far more satisfying villain and I think it signifies to the audience that this show is going to have so much more meaning than a campy tour of things that go bump.  Now, you're curious about all these characters, these growing relationships, the history that they all have to tell.   A fantastic episode, overall."

Some thoughts from watching:   Snyder owns the scene as always Spike's here, with a very Spike entrance ‘I have a job’ line seems rather redundant; it was pretty clear that that was the implication ‘Why do they call it a mace?’ ‘Cordelia, have some lemonade’ ‘Get the hell away from my daughter’—will be referenced in the finale ‘A slayer with family and friends’—Buffy is unique in the slayer line; this is probably the most important part of the episode to understanding the Buffy character; this is what Buffy gives up in the finale Spike kills the Anointed One—first time I saw this I couldn't stop laughing at just how great it was; Spike really elevates this episode; very strong introduction   edit: formatting"

I think that eps 3, 6, and 7 -- School Hard, Halloween, and Lie to Me (which are Spike & Dru's first three episodes, and are interrupted only by two relatively weak MOTW's) -- form an extraordinary trio that really kick the season into gear, particularly in giving depth to Buffy, Angel and Giles.  After these, a new viewer should be eager for The Dark Age and What's My Line.  I still recall the feeling in that fall of '97, giddy with excitement for this show."

It's just awesome to have him part of the series.  3 I forgot how utterly creepy Spike is in s2. He's even creeping out the anointed one with his comments.  4 I really don't understand why Buffy tries to help Sheila. It doesn't benefit her, and being a good person dosen't mean covering for a stoned slacker with no interest in school.  5 does Spike somehow know Sheila is connected to Buffy? Otherwise it's a pretty big coincidence. 6 Angel's smirk just disappears as Willow says ""if you only had two a year, that's still like 400 dates with 400 different..."" 7 why is Angel not mentioned in the books Giles reads? He was the leader of the fanged four. 8 I'd like see the moment Spike was wondering around Sunnydale and came across the school sign that said parent-teacher night and thought, I should break in and kill everyone for some reason. I mean, that can't be the most effective way to get to the slayer.  9 one of my favorite scenes of the episode is Angel and Spike talking. The dynamic between them is already there.  10 I don't remember the last slayer begging for her life.

(or something like that, I'm paraphrasing, but he definitely says ""you were my sire""). But ... Angel wasn't Spike's sire. Dru was. I know that Angel sired Drusilla, which makes Spike in his line, but the line has always struck me as awkward and possible evidence that the Angel/Spike/Dru mythology got rewritten down the road. Does anyone have any input on this?"

Buffy really picks up in season 2 and seasons 3, 5 and 6 are golden.  You've gotten through the worst part, might as well keep going. If you don't like the 2nd season then I guess it's not for you."
buffy,3d0qvk,ibeatoffconstantly,7,Mon Jul 13 05:04:20 2015 UTC,"It's OK not to like S1 (even though personally, I love it). It's got some less-than-quality moments in it. Start watching S2. If by the 14th episode you haven't been hooked into the show completely, Buffy may not be for you.   However, I would bet by episode three you will start to understand how good of a show it is.   S2 is very thematic. Pay attention to the broad themes and trace them throughout the season and that may help you appreciate the story more."
buffy,3d0qvk,pober,7,Mon Jul 13 01:43:23 2015 UTC,Keep going. The first season is rough.
buffy,3d0qvk,fauxkaren,6,Mon Jul 13 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"One of the best things about Buffy is watching the characters grow and change and figure out who they are.  By the end of the series, you've seen them go through so much that they feel like old friends.  But in order for dramatic character arcs to feel believable and organic, they need time to develop.      Another much celebrated aspect of the show is the use of demons as metaphors for real life struggles.  In the first season it's pretty much just ""high school is hell"", but in the second season the themes are more interesting, and good vs. evil aren't so straightforward.    Buffy contains some of the best episodes of television ever made, but none of them are in S1.  It's worth it, I promise!"
buffy,3d0qvk,skeezycheeses,5,Mon Jul 13 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"This video should help explain.  We also have an entire section in our FAQ devoted to this very question. Season one is largely viewed as the worst of the seasons. At this point, you've already gotten through the hard part. The show gets so amazing. You've done almost all the work. Don't stop now!"
buffy,3d0qvk,clockworklycanthrope,2,Mon Jul 13 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"What other kinds of shows are you into?  Buffy is very unique, and surprisingly deep/complex, I'll say that...but I think if you stick with it, at least through season 3, you'll find something to appreciate about it.  As others have said, season 1 is pretty rough, like they're just getting the feel for it.  It definitely has some of the worst episodes.  Starting in season 2, it begins to get a little heavier, more serious, and slightly darker...and the characters begin to come into their own and grow a bit.  I think the series progressively gets better and better through about season 5, where it plateaus a little.  If you still don't feel like it's your thing, there's a few standalone episodes which, if you're not worried about spoilers, can demonstrate why so many people love it...try watching Hush, and Restless, from season 4; Zeppo, from Season 3 (i think), and maybe even The Body from season 5 (although this, of course, contains a huge spoiler).  It's totally cool if it's just not your kinda thing, of course!  But I think you should try to get through at least one more season, and I bet you can find something at least to appreciate about it."

If you forget who the first major character to die was: Jenny Calandar.   Jenny dies just as she finds a way to return Angels soul and reconciling with Giles (ending of arc).  Kendra dies as she emerges from her shell of what she thought a slayer was, into something more than just a slayer (as Buffy will prove/end arc).  Tara will die reconciling with Willow (end arc).  The Watchers Council will be destroyed when realizing they do not boss the slayer around, but to support her (Big boom, end arc).  Jonathan dies as an adult, not the child we've seen him as throughout the series (end arc).  Anya dies coming to know what it means to be human; something we see her struggle with constantly (to our great comic relief/end arc).  Finally, Spike after Buffy says she loves him (end ar- wait, uh. End series?)."

buffy,3cyq5b,HarlequinNight,4,Mon Jul 13 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"I think Anya's fear of bunnies is one of the most interesting things about the show, and especially her overcoming that fear...even though it's obviously supposed to be a silly sort of comic relief, to make her character quirky.  In her past she gave rabbits to people just as a gift, so I see it as though bunnies representing love, giving something of yourself to others in a selfless way, just because you want to show people you care, y'know?  But she did this, and ended up losing her love and getting hurt, so now seeing bunnies reminds her of this pain, and that's why she fears them.  But then becoming human again for a few years in Sunnydale, she learns to love again, and sees that the pain can be worth it, and then goes down fighting the (figurative) bunnies out of love for her peers and for humans.  As for Tara, it's nice that she was happy when she died, but that was such a huge punch in the gut...if there was a single character on that show who LEAST deserved to die, it was Tara, and if there was one character who most deserved to live happily ever after with her one true love, it was Willow."

He's not afraid to sacrifice popular characters, even if it goes against the grain, in order to further the story and better continue a characters arc.   So many creators get comfortable with the story and aren't willing to make some really hard choices. Joss isn't one of those people. But Joss also doesn't just kill characters to be flamboyant or edgy, there's a point to it, even if the death seems on the outside to have no greater meaning (like Anya)."
buffy,3cyq5b,TBoarder,2,Sun Jul 12 12:23:00 2015 UTC,"Either that, or he just did it so that it was an even bigger kick to the balls when they died.  Also, I wouldn't call having my throat slit, getting stabbed and left to bleed out, or getting cut in half exactly painless."

buffy,3cyibb,wr3nKingston,11,Sat Jul 11 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I love hate-watching this episode because Buffy is hands down my favorite character and her friends just seem completely incapable of empathy sometimes. I hate that she's expected by both the rest of the characters and the fanbase to be so much more mature than the other characters. I often hear people give Xander a pass because he's a teenage boy. Well Buffy's a teenage girl, no shit she isn't the best decision maker in literally life or death situations! I need to stop because I'm getting all worked up just thinking about it, haha."
buffy,3cyibb,albertparsons,11,Sun Jul 12 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"Completely with you. Doesn't Buffy eventually make brief mention of it during an argument with Xander? Like much later?  There are times, I have to admit, where I despised Xander. He seems to have this selfish/vindictive/self-righteous streak that can pop out at the worst time. I think that's why I've never been able to love him like I do the other Scoobies. I don't hate him by any means, I don't even dislike him really, he's just one of those people that I'd never be able to completely trust.   Also, one of my all time favourite lines is in this episode, so I can't bring myself to skip it on re-watches like other people lol."

buffy,3cxwm5,The_Iron_Zeppelin,8,Sat Jul 11 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's a tough one, I agree on one hand you want all of these characters to mature and evolve as the seasons progress and they grow older. But at the same time, how much of Xanders nerd culture references were really immaturity vs just his true self? I think Season 8 forced him to grow up and be a certain way, but some (more) rough stuff happened to him and has continued to happen to him (Anya, Renee, Dawn) so maybe it's not that he's regressing but he's just realizing that growing up doesn't mean not making jokes and having fun it's being your genuine self in every situation, which for him is more of a comic relief, tension reliever character.   I think in the latest few issues of season 10 he also hasn't the BIGGEST role in the story so his lines of dialog are limited and therefore it seems like when he's talking it's just one liners but maybe if he was featured more he'd have more diverse things to say."
buffy,3cxwm5,PawneePorpoise,5,Sat Jul 11 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"I agree! Making nerdy references isn't necessarily immature.  Besides, the supernatural world was at war in season 8 -- things were different. I think Xander has definitely grown...he's dealing with the Dawn thing, dealing with his anger...  I think it feels like a regression because, in a way, the story has regressed to the Scoobies without a war to fight, if that makes sense."
buffy,3cxwm5,tclovescheese,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seasons 8 and in the aftermath of 8, season 9 in particular drove a lot of rifts between our core scoobies. Rightfully so after all the had just been through. So in season 10 things are slowly getting back to being good between all of them. And I think for some characters that allows for then to fall a little bit back into their old selves. Not immature selves, but just the pressure (while always high) isn't quite as high as it was in previous seasons."
buffy,3cxwm5,PawneePorpoise,5,Sat Jul 11 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"I like how he is now. He is definitely more mature than he was in the series. I think he's been handling his relationship with Dawn really well. He's been seeing a shrink (which I think is a sign of emotional growth) about his anger issues, and he hasn't punched Angel yet. On his increase of nerd references and moments (that fight with Spike about the dolls), it could be a way to deal with his anger, an escape, or could just be a writer thing (Nicholas Brendon has been writing him). Overall I think he's matured but not too serious, and I like it."
buffy,3cxwm5,GoncasCrazy,4,Sat Jul 11 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  This is probably the most that I've liked Xander in a really, really long time."
buffy,3cxwm5,kpeteymomo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that he was able to go back to being a normal person now that he doesn't have to be the military officer anymore. He's just as mature, just as put together, but he's allowed to be the ordinary joe that he's always been."
buffy,3cvmbn,Rorplup,40,Sat Jul 11 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"I'd assume, if you're looking for an in-universe answer, that they weren't expecting anything other than the Slayer.  There's no reason to think the bot is anything other than the bona-fide Slayer, so it just wouldn't enter their minds.    See Season 3's Episode, ""Doppelgangland"":   Alfonse:  (shakes his head in shame) A human. I should have smelled it right away.   He wouldn't have thought that the person in front of him was anything but Vamp Willow, because the concept of there being 2 Willows was foreign to him until that moment when Anya reveals it.  See also:  Angel Season 5, ""Shells"":   SPIKE: Back in the lab, she was standing right there in front of me, but there was no scent. Nothing. It's like she wasn't even there.   He was aware of the change that had occurred in that character, so Spike would be more aware of this new, hitherto unknown, being.  That being said, it's really plot convenience.  That's all."
buffy,3cvmbn,BackOfTheHearse,2,Sat Jul 11 04:08:04 2015 UTC,"Plus the buffybot was made by Warren, so I wouldn't be surprised if she was made with actual human skin/hair. Warren hadn't exactly become ""evil"" yet at that point so I doubt that he killed people to get human skin, but maybe he found a way to get his hands on medical waste or excess from skin grafts or something (because he's a creepy motherfucker like that). So she might have also smelled somewhat human from whatever parts she was made with. I figure the vamps wouldn't really notice the difference between a ""human smell"" and a ""partially human smell"" while they were trying to avoid getting staked."

Since the vampires are fighting for their life, it wouldn't be surprising that they don't notice that the Buffybot doesn't smell quite like a human.  Any that do survive an encounter with her may just write off the difference in smell being due to her being the Slayer."

buffy,3cvmbn,longarmofmylaw,2,Sat Jul 11 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Joss admitted that he messed up with the Warren thing. Though Warren basically being dead for a few seconds works. We know the First can take the form of someone who died and came back, so I guess its forgivable, in universe."

While getting a good person back is always near-impossible in fantasy, apparently the lords of the various hells are often willing to let back bad guys if they can accomplish some usefully evil deeds while back. By vampire standards, raising the Master would've been a walk in the park"

I'd love a show with each season centered around a different slayer. It could include Fray as well as historical slayers and bring some of the themes of Buffy to lots of different stories."
buffy,3cu9ze,FunWinterSport,4,Fri Jul 10 23:08:24 2015 UTC,I like that. It's sorta like Buffy meets True Detective.
buffy,3cu9ze,thosefilthyhobbitses,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:47:59 2015 UTC,"I suppose one problem with something in the style of that is that you know the slayer will die at the end. Personally I'd like a show following a random potential after she becomes a slayer following season 7. Same universe, possible cameos from original crew, but also giving it a different element in the show not present in buffy."
buffy,3cu9ze,tclovescheese,3,Sat Jul 11 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm not necessarily. If the show were to run American Horror Story/True Detective style, each season would feature a different Slayer/time period and it wouldn't always have to end in death...maybe the season could just cover a significant battle or foe the Slayer faces?  Alternatively, they could do it Dr. Who style, except instead of regenerating the show just shifts focus to the newest Slayer. Though I imagine having to watch a new Slayer figure out her powers every couple of seasons or so would get boring after a while."

Having guest appearances from the old cast would be an awesome surprise in a finale episode.  Or maybe just a show about Oz."
buffy,3cu9ze,greyspatter,3,Sat Jul 11 01:40:23 2015 UTC,I adore Seth Green. Oz was my favorite character besides Spike.
buffy,3cu9ze,Denihilist,8,Sat Jul 11 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a new take on the series, maybe with Xander and Willow training some newbie slayers.   Presuming, that is, that Nicholas Brenden can kick his drug and alcohol fueled binges.  I wouldn't want a reboot either. Maybe make the story about how Xander and Willow are training the remaining slayers in secret after some really big bad took out Buffy. You could have the underlying recriminations of Buffy's friends feeling like they failed, and how that affects them. Along with being over-protective of the new slayers, even while training them to take revenge."

What would be the point of a reboot? Will it be better than the original? Nope. Will it add anything? Highly doubt it.   There are so many characters and stories that would make for amazing television, that we haven't seen before. So many potential adventures and new avenues to go down.   The only thing that should happen with Buffy is that a Blu-Ray release should be made, done properly, with Joss and the original producers bought in to re-master.   Also, a reboot isn't happening. People have been saying it's ""happening"" since 2003 when the show ended. It's happening less now than it was then.  Sorry, not trying to as /u/DaddyCatALSO put it, ""fight the thread"", but it's been talked about so many times over and over again. We need to push for new stories and new characters, not a reboot."

So much of what I love about Buffy for me is the combination of its witty dialogue, the now-mediocre effects, its overall campiness, and how it fit into the time it was created--all of this gives the show its charm and I don't think it would get away with half of that stuff today and still be taken seriously. And I honestly don't feel this way about any and everything that I love because there's plenty of old pieces of media I'd LOVE to see recreated with today's technology, but Buffy just isn't one of those for me. I would love more attention to the show and the properties, though. It's nearly impossible to find any cool Buffy stuff that wasn't made 15 years ago, and every night I pray to my wooden stake collection that the musical episode soundtrack will be released on vinyl in an awesome deluxe edition boxset one day."

Not sure about Giles either. Maybe Matthew Gray Gubler if he was older.    Xander idk. Maybe Dev Patel or Robert Sheehan ... I dunno, I feel like some characters' physicality isn't as important as others...   But yea that's all I could think of for the time being!   edit x2: i know my imagined cast isn't racially diverse and I do feel bad about that ahah I just couldn't think of many age and look appropriate actors who weren't white lol I guess that's a testament to the underlying racism in the film industry"

buffy,3cu1w5,Cavernwight,20,Fri Jul 10 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"It was perfect! The episode is not about their relationship at all, so it places no special emphasis on their kiss - it's totally normal to them and in their world. Their kiss appeared there first because a lesbian couple consoling each other with a hug and kiss when grieving is completely normal and acceptable, and shouldn't be displayed in any other light.    Were they to kiss in any other place in the series, I think some viewers would be so taken by the moment they'd make it some huge special thing (which it is, first ever lesbian kiss on screen!) when it should be a normal thing that requires no extraordinary response.    Joss got their kiss right."

I really didn't get the point of the episode first time watching, but on rewatching, it's really clear and works so well in its place in the season arc, which is characterised by themes, not as much by the narrative (which makes the next episode's existence more heinous, because it's tonally uninformed).

The point of utilizing the setting of popular culture like television shows to act out sketches is to use references from the show and portray comedy through the lens of the pop-culture they chose.   This is just an awful sketch which is in no way clever or funny, just obnoxious that could have been set in any ""world"". Reminds me of Jimmy Kimmel doing his sex sketch on the ""Friends"" set, just not funny."

buffy,3cmbb5,DaddyCatALSO,22,Thu Jul 9 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"From: Seeing Red (Season 6, Episode 19)  As mentioned earlier, Season Six is by far the darkest of the series, putting just about every major character through the wringer. Yet the most unexpected development was definitely Spike’s attempted rape of Buffy.  Buffy may have dealt with some adult themes in its time but a scene such as this was hard to watch and felt out of place with the rest of the series. The showmakers themselves seemed to have no idea how to handle the fallout of this and the traumatic event was not mentioned the following season. Whatever you say about it, though, the moment was certainly one of the most shocking in the whole show.   I have many problems with why the show chose to do this scene, and how the aftermath was executed, but it was mentioned.  Season 7 episode 2   BUFFY: Spike and I will check out the scene.  XANDER: OK, in the biggest way, I am not loving this plan. (to Buffy) I am not loving Spike. (whispering) He tried to rape you.  BUFFY: And he failed. I know I can take him. Xander, take Nancy home. Spike and I will patrol."

buffy,3cj712,Kblueism,10,Wed Jul 8 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"There is a slight rift in the fanbase, with the bias for this sub being on the side of ""watch it all.""  There are some fans who feel that Seasons 6 & 7 were not quite the same in spirit/feel, or that the events leading to the finale of Season 5 were how the show was meant to end and the other two were just TV producers trying to make a buck.  Not only are some of the best episodes in the last two seasons, but multiple interviews with Joss Whedon have explained why the uncertainty of the show being picked up by a network led to writing Season 5 with a lot of closure.  I believe the following seasons do have a slightly different feel, but for the most part, they're still pretty high quality and absolutely worth watching.    My advice is to watch through episode 7 of season 6 (hailed by many as one of the best episodes in the entire show) and if you're still not feeling it, you can walk away."
buffy,3cj712,MalevolentDragon,8,Wed Jul 8 11:47:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. Seasons 5 & 6 are great, and 7 is better than most TV, and besides, its more Buffy. The biggest problem with Buffy is when you're at the end and there's no more left to watch. So personally I wouldn't be able to just leave 2-3 seasons sitting there existing but unwatched.  And I agree, watch Angel. You can find a decent order to watch them chronologically if you want to get the 'full experience' of all the crossovers. Or you can wait until after Buffy if you want. No big deal."
buffy,3cj712,venom8599,4,Wed Jul 8 09:47:22 2015 UTC,"Here is my take on it. First of all, of course you should watch the whole thing. But if at the end of season 5 you decide you want that to be the end, stop watching.   I cannot imagine anyone actually feeling this way... but feel free!"
buffy,3cj712,danielle_kb,4,Wed Jul 8 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"First off..Yes. Watch all of it. It's so stinkin good.  Second..just in case you haven't started watching through season one yet, be warned...the first season and a half or so can be kind of rough to make it through. I wanted to stop, but it's worth it to push through."
buffy,3cj712,Tiekyl,3,Wed Jul 8 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Omg yes, watch all of it and the spin-off Angel, really."
buffy,3cj712,I_SirGravy_I,3,Wed Jul 8 11:03:31 2015 UTC,Watch all seven seasons Watch all of Angel Read all the Season 8/9/10/ Angel & Faith comics The entire series is fantastic and I highly recommend seeing it through. :3
buffy,3cj712,sorcerousmike,3,Wed Jul 8 15:50:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly I want to welcome you to the best TV show ever. It may not seem like it at first but believe me, stick with it and be the end of the show you'll feel like you lost a friend.  To answer the obvious question: Watch all the seasons in order. I think you might be getting confused with the show ""Scrubs"".   To answer in more detail? Do NOT skip any seasons. Whilst the first season is very cheesy and has the least popular story lines, it's the foundation of the show. You really have to watch the whole thing from start to finish to see how the writer grew it into a masterpiece.  The other thing worth knowing, is that there's a second show called ""Angel"" which is a Spinoff. Angel starts at the same time as Season 4 and compliments the timeline of Buffy with the occasional cross-over. The show still makes sense by itself but if you want to do the whole thing in it's entirety watch them together. The playing order can be found here: http://josswhedon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/buffy-and-angel-episode-viewing-order.html  If you aren't enjoying Buffy, take it slow. Just get through one a day or every other day. It's worth it! People are going to hate me for saying this but I don't rate Season 1 or 2 that well but they're mandatory to get to the good stuff. When you compare Season 1 with even Season 3, the show evolves so much.    Good luck and let us know your thoughts!"

Predictably, this means some fans hated them, but I encourage you to give them a chance. Many of us think S6 was the best season.  If nothing else, ""Once More With Feeling"" (the S6 musical episode) is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the show -- even of TV in general. It won't make any sense to you unless you've watched the first part of the season, so you should go that far, at least."

buffy,3cip5h,SorrowSixx,8,Wed Jul 8 05:32:24 2015 UTC,"MacManus, and by extention Nina, is said to be a very rare type of werewolf, called Lycanthropus Exterus. She is a different species of werewolf than Oz and Veruca, who are probably the type referred to as ""common"" werewolves. The most popular theory online is that Lycanthropus Exterus turns back into human form upon death, while the common werewolf does not. It would also explain some other differences, like Nina changing when the moon rises, while Oz and Veruca change when the sun sets. And then there are the physical differences, of course."
buffy,3cip5h,Beloit,6,Wed Jul 8 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"in that very same episode of Angel they also discuss various types of werewolves, it's entirely possible that there are some kinds of werewolves that don't turn back into the human form once they're killed, or maybe the hunters were skinning them alive, or just you know, plot hole."
buffy,3cip5h,Sneakersislife,3,Wed Jul 8 05:47:11 2015 UTC,"The hunter specifically says he can't skin them alive. But yeah, could easily be a different type. Also different shows so it would be easier to overlook."
buffy,3cip5h,Sneakersislife,3,Wed Jul 8 05:50:27 2015 UTC,"the type of werewolf that Angels friend turns into for example is more bipedal, leaner looking too. it's very different than the almost dog like one that Oz turns into, I'm sure it was just that, that it's a different type."
buffy,3cip5h,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 05:52:18 2015 UTC,They did say in that ep. she was a very rare type in north america
buffy,3cip5h,Rorplup,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:26:31 2015 UTC,I read an article in the Angel magazine that said that they were two different werewolf breeds and that was why one guy turned back. Veruca was still a werewolf when Oz killed her.

buffy,3cip5h,Cervix-Pounder,3,Fri Jul 10 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"I watched this episode a couple of days ago and im pretty sure he says ""its really hard to skin them alive""."
buffy,3cip5h,Iokuas,2,Wed Jul 8 21:25:45 2015 UTC,Who's to say he actually kills them before skinning them? He may skin them alive and they die from the experience.
buffy,3cip5h,monkeymosh88,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"I don’t have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once, but by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor’s dog."
buffy,3chpgy,Rorplup,17,Wed Jul 8 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"We know from ""Villains"" that most of Rack's customers will show you where to go for 5$ (if you haggle).  Buffy got a fair bit of experience ""haggling"" with shady characters at Willy's, probably didn't have much trouble finding someone willing to tell her."
buffy,3chpgy,agamemnon42,5,Wed Jul 8 02:24:02 2015 UTC,This seems the most logical explanation.
buffy,3chpgy,CADOMA,10,Wed Jul 8 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"Hm. Perhaps since the Slayer was created with the essence of a demon its possible for her to find it. Maybe Jonathan, Andrew, or Anya told her about it and gave her a way to find it offscreen. Or she quickly found a vampire or demon and forced them to lead her there."
buffy,3chpgy,venom8599,3,Wed Jul 8 01:08:20 2015 UTC,Spike took her there.
buffy,3chpgy,free112701,3,Wed Jul 8 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"That was earlier in the season. Racks place changes location constantly. By the end of season 6 Spike was ""out of town"""

buffy,3chpgy,DeadNotSleepingWI,2,Wed Jul 8 08:11:48 2015 UTC,It is shown that people with some sort of supernatural element could feel its presence when they were near. Perhaps she just wandered around til she got a twinge.
buffy,3chpgy,ShushImAtWork,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:51:01 2015 UTC,"Dawn used Clem to take her to the hideout because it moves places constantly. Buffy has a higher sense as a Slayer that leads her to ""danger"" or supernatural element. She could have found it herself."

buffy,3chpgy,ShushImAtWork,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:07:48 2015 UTC,I know. She needed Spike last time to find the place so she would have needed help this time.
buffy,3cfswy,Blackmarketbeagle,43,Tue Jul 7 16:03:30 2015 UTC,Compartmentalization of information.  Suppose that a Watcher gets captured and tortured.  The less they know about potential Slayers the less likely it is for anyone who is not the First to hunt them down.
buffy,3cfswy,CrapulousDrizzle,22,Tue Jul 7 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"I think this, and the fact that in the beginning Giles still trusted that the council were working with his and Buffy's best interests at heart. Once he realised what a bunch of dickbags they were he knew that he could only rely on his own information and research, so probably did a bit of digging on his own, so that he (and the Scoobies) could get their hands on important knowledge, hence how he could find out about the potentials in season 7."
buffy,3cfswy,Mquestionmark,7,Tue Jul 7 16:28:30 2015 UTC,hmmm I never thought of that.
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,10,Tue Jul 7 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"it seems a bit odd especially considering he had the knowledge to track down all the random potentials and their watchers.  But maybe that early on in his ""watching"" he was moreso entirely focused on sunnydale and Buffy"
buffy,3cfswy,cassiope,12,Tue Jul 7 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, any of the Potentials actually with Watchers, and many that aren't, were most likely ina big database which Giles accessed while he was  in England."
buffy,3cfswy,wolframandhart,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"In addition to u/DaddyCatALSO's comment, there is a point in Season 7 where the Coven is helping Giles to find potentials, not the council. If you don't know to ask for the information, then you won't get it."
buffy,3cfswy,Arancaytar,5,Wed Jul 8 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"The Watchers definitely keep Giles out of the loop. If I recall correctly, he wasn't even invited to their yearly retreats in the Cotswolds!"
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,5,Tue Jul 7 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about this point myself. The most glaring thing, here, is the long time between Buffy's death and Kendra's arrival in Sunnydale (several months at least, since the in-universe time roughly matches the air date).  Giles probably didn't mention the incident to the Watcher Council, since he'd have no reason to think Buffy's ""death"" might count for the Slayer line (because it's a ridiculous technicality). The first who find out, therefore, are Kendra and her Watcher (Sam Zabuto) when she gets called.  So there are several weird things here:   Why didn't Zabuto tell the Council ""hey, it looks like my Potential is the new Slayer""? This is important info, and he knows he's the first one to know, even if they heard of Buffy's death already. If he did, then why didn't the Council contact Giles? ""You could have told us your Slayer died, WTF."" When Zabuto finally sent Kendra to Sunnydale, why didn't he also call Giles directly? ""There's a new Slayer on her way to you; please assist her.""   This is one of those plots that should only be allowed in pre-telephone settings. :P    My one shot at a theory is that the Slayer succession is actually not instantaneous. Kendra and Faith are the only Slayers who get called in the show due to a death, and both were introduced months later. The whole thing makes more sense if Kendra got called much later - Zabuto assumes that Giles is dead or compromised (since he didn't report Buffy's death), and therefore sends Kendra to Sunnydale immediately, without informing him. He later informs the Council, but by then (and by the time the Council gets in touch with Giles) Kendra has already arrived."
buffy,3cfswy,Arancaytar,3,Wed Jul 8 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"To me, I just see it as The Council and Zabuto figured Kendra was needed in Jamaica, and she was only sent to Sunnydale when Zabuto heard of a specific omen of one particular danger centered there. Once the MAster was destroyed, I guess they figured the local Hellmouth was now no longer a major problem area and left Giles there with ""Slayer Emeritus"" Buffy."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"That does make sense, but you'd expect some kind of heads-up to pass from Zabuto to Giles (either directly or via the council) in the intervening months.  When they introduced Faith the same way in season 3, at least it was excused by her watcher being dead and her being on the run."
buffy,3cfswy,Gneissisnice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"And , we don't know how long it was between Faith's activation and when her watcher died, or how long (probably not long, based on Faith's well-developed street persona) she was with her Watcher before activation"
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,3,Thu Jul 9 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"I just chalk it up to the Watcher's Council being massively incompetent.  I mean, do we ever see them do anything well? They fuck up everything."
buffy,3cfswy,aofb031985,9,Wed Jul 8 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"the two slayers thing comes with lots of plotholes.  for example after faith is called, we are still constantly told that if buffy dies another will be called still.   But then buffy dies for months and its still just the two of them.  even AFTER this, we are told (s7) that if buffy dies one of the potentials will be chosen..."
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,19,Tue Jul 7 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"That was the theory but the fact that a new Slayer wasn't called after Buffy sacrificed herself indicates that the theory was wrong.  It's possible that the magics that keep the Slayer line going only work once.  So when Buffy died the first time and Kendra was called, Buffy was no longer capable of calling a new Slayer when she died again."
buffy,3cfswy,Tattycakes,4,Tue Jul 7 20:48:19 2015 UTC,I think Buffy becomes the Spare not the heir.
buffy,3cfswy,FuzzieDunlop,7,Wed Jul 8 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Which is fine, but why do they keep saying otherwise... especially in s7 where it is repeated over and over."
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,11,Tue Jul 7 21:00:10 2015 UTC,Maybe the characters themselves misunderstood it.
buffy,3cfswy,FuzzieDunlop,4,Tue Jul 7 22:22:36 2015 UTC,I don't remember anyone saying this. Do you have a quote or citation?
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,3,Wed Jul 8 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"S7 e 12  Buffy   You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer? Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps. Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer.    I can't find it, but there is also once where one of the potentials mentions they are sitting around waiting for buffy to die, and are otherwise useless.  I am sure there are other mentions too."
buffy,3cfswy,Erawk,3,Wed Jul 8 07:33:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh, yes. Thanks! That's a very confusing line. I get the feeling that no one in the show really knows what would happen if Buffy died again, and no one who writes the show ever made a definitive call on the matter (though it seems settled after Buffy died in S5 and no slayer seems to have been called afterward)."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"right, it feels like the writers didn't think it through, which is fine, but as someone else pointed out, thats pretty much the definition of a plot hole :)  I'm a huge fan of the show, (obviouslly, how else would i know such an obscure quote well enough to find it?) but there are a few places where it defies logic.  The only bigger plot hole is the s3 one about ""never met a true demon"".    I love the show, but seems like these two plotholes were completely unneccesary.   They really could have fixed the one we are discussing by simply having someone speculate about faith being the one who had to die...  and then not putting in lines like this one.  the s3 one could have been fixed by cutting a piece of dialogue."
buffy,3cfswy,kralrick,2,Wed Jul 8 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't remember this being said either, but it has been a few years since I watched."
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,2,Wed Jul 8 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"Joss gave an interview after S-5; I read it quoted in the book SLayer by Keith Topping, but it's accessible elsewhere, too, I'm sure."
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,3,Wed Jul 8 12:46:40 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the intro monologue or actual dialogue in the show?
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 00:31:48 2015 UTC,actual show.
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,4,Wed Jul 8 07:17:46 2015 UTC,What if another Slayer was chosen when Buffy died only they don't know about it? It took months for them to discover Kendra existed. Who says that a new Slayer wasn't chosen somewhere else in the world? As OP said they didn't contact Giles last time so why would they bother again?  Could be a third Slayer out there.
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Tue Jul 7 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"Kendra didn't come to sunnydale until months alter, but she'd been with her Watcher since infancy. He sent her there, so obviously he knew she was the Slayer by then"
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,2,Wed Jul 8 12:47:43 2015 UTC,"I am aware of that, I don't think that changes anything that I said though. When I said that a new Slayer was chosen when Buffy died, I was referring to the second time she died.   Kendra's Watcher knew she was a Slayer but we don't know if anyone at the Watcher's council was even aware as they didn't seem to get involved  until Faith appeared. If they did know about Kendra then the Watcher's Council didn't tell Giles. If they have acted like this before, why would they tell Buffy again?"
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well, they didn't; buffy didn't know about Faith until she showed up. Unless that's not what you mean."
buffy,3cfswy,FuschiaKnight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:20:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I know that the gang didn't know about Faith. I just mentioned that they didn't tell Buffy about past Slayers even though they had their Watchers. Not until the Slayers showed up. Nothing stopping them doing that with a third Slayer.
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"True but Joss already Jossed the idea in a public statement, so we externally ""know"" it didn't happen.  But you're right, it should be in the show someplace. One problem: CPR was basically invented in the mid-20th century. It's possible Buffy was the only slayer ever revived and that nobody in the 'verse knows what Joss has said. Exasperating."
buffy,3cfswy,FuschiaKnight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"If they could track down all of those potentials, then they should've been able to track down a third slayer..."
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:32:13 2015 UTC,Just because they knew about her doesn't mean they told Buffy as was the case with Kendra and Faith.
buffy,3cfswy,FuschiaKnight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"I thought Giles was finding potentials through the coven, not the council.  Plus, whoever he was getting his info from, if it was a dire enough time to round up the potentials, why the hell wouldn't the new slayer be sent for?"
buffy,3cfswy,Rorplup,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:53:08 2015 UTC,She doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to. She could be in hiding. There are a few reasons that she didn't have to/ want to go to Sunnydale.
buffy,3cfswy,Flamingmonkey923,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:55:58 2015 UTC,"Buffy didn't really want to be the slayer for most of the series, but she always fulfilled her role when needed. Faith wanted to make ammends for her wrongs by serving her time, but she broke out of jail for this. Why? Because it was the end-of-the-world all-hands-on-deck situation.  That, combined with no references at all to a third, mystery slayer makes me think that theory is a little to out of left field."
buffy,3cfswy,ModerateBias,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"We're not going by Joss's mind. We're just talking about the universe. The world is a big place. Who's to say that the Slayer wasn't in a location that the Watcher's council couldn't get to her? As I said before, the Council didn't warn even Giles about the two new Slayers so probably didn't warn him about the other.  Different people with different personalities is what I'd say in regards to Buffy, Faith and another Slayer. Just because they chose to fight the fight doesn't mean the other Slayer had to. That and while it was the end of the world, lots of Potenitlals were being murdered around this time, the third could have been killed too and another may have had to take her place. With the Watcher's Council gone, nobody could help her.  I'm not saying it's real. There's just a possibility if Buffy was still the active Slayer there would have to be another Slayer out there. That's just an 'if'."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Jul 11 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"That's not a plot hole, it's characters being wrong.  After Buffy dies in Season 1, she's not The Slayer anymore, Kendra is. Then Faith is. If Faith dies, a new slayer will be called."
buffy,3cfswy,BigMacisBP,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"Except they keep repeating it after she dies again... season 7 its said at least twice.    Also when your only source of true info is dialogue, and there is never explanatory dialogue about them being wrong... its a plot hole.   You can't have characters giving false lore unless that lore is presented correctly at some point.  its a hole in the writing if you do."
buffy,3cfswy,JBHoTep,3,Wed Jul 8 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. Not everybody is a trivia lawyer, or been a fan since the beginning and read lots of books and articles. The show shouldn't be written to require8 knowledge like, say, mine. Then again, maybe the writers themselves forgot it when writing an ep., the definition of plot hole, really."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,6,Wed Jul 8 12:50:28 2015 UTC,This. So much this. It always bugged me to no end.
buffy,3cfswy,ShekhMaShierakiAnni,3,Tue Jul 7 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered how the two alternative slayers came so prepared. If I'm doing the math right, it was less than a year before Kendra showed up after Buffy died. How was she already so well trained?"
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Trianed since birth, just now ahs supperstrength."
buffy,3cfswy,aofb031985,3,Wed Jul 8 13:01:46 2015 UTC,The thing I don't understand is they have a watchers retreat that Giles talks about when Faith shows up. And Giles says he has never been invited... how can the one person with a slayer never be invited?
buffy,3cfswy,The_Ripper42,3,Wed Jul 8 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"The only reason I can see is that, like many self-perpetuating entities, the Council to some extent is more concerned with keeping itself going than with its mission. And recall Buffy wasn't known to the Council until she activated, and they had little confidence in her ability to last with no prior training. So they fobbed off a Watcher for whom they had little respect."
buffy,3cfswy,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Wed Jul 8 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"Which is really stupid of them.  I mean, don't they have a mission statement somewhere? wtf."
buffy,3cfswy,Bellevert,3,Wed Jul 8 21:02:27 2015 UTC,I think the Council is just a small discombobulated government for the Slayer. Think about HELPLESS they don't care for the Slayer. They care more about ritual and respect for themselves than they care about anything else. Though I do disagree with everyone saying she was no longer the Slayer. Buffy was viewed as such by the council. That's why she was put through the test by the council in HELPLESS. Speaking of HELPLESS lets look at how the two lackeys are just killed and everyone is like meh... They don't like Buffy. They don't like Giles. It is a leave them to die attitude.
buffy,3cfswy,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Wed Jul 8 20:43:35 2015 UTC,I just figured it out. The Watcher's Council sent it in their monthly email To all the watchers but Giles accidentally deleted it after getting frustrated with his computer.
buffy,3cfswy,Gneissisnice,3,Thu Jul 9 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"Traditionally a Watcher was assigned a potential and they are trained from the day they are located.  The Watchers prepare the potential for the possibility of being chosen.  Buffy was one of the few potentials who slipped through the cracks and wasn't located until she was already chosen.  Kendra most likely had been training with her watcher for some time before she was chosen, so it was a smooth transition."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,3,Tue Jul 7 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"Which brings me to my question, how do they know someone is a potential? I feel like with a whole season devoted to protecting the potentials, how do they know (other than The Fiest trying to kill them - how does The First know who they are?)"
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 01:20:31 2015 UTC,I assume they're all using some kind if location spell to find them.  Potentials technically are 'chosen' as well.  They have higher coordination and agility and have Slayer dreams. So there must be some identifiable Slayer magic that the Watchers and The First are using to locate potentials.    Side Note: I looked a little more into Kendra and found out her Watcher was assigned to her as an infant.  She was given up by her parents and never really knew anything but a Slayers life.
buffy,3cfswy,FuzzieDunlop,3,Wed Jul 8 10:17:27 2015 UTC,"Willow even used a spell to track Potentials in season 7, that's why they thought that Dawn might be one (turns out it was Amanda instead)."
buffy,3cfswy,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jul 8 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the Council would only know about buffy's situation if giles goes into enough detail in his reports. And once Kendra was called, Sam was likely busy and even if the Council s ent hima memo he might not notice it."
buffy,3cfswy,jekyllcorvus,3,Tue Jul 7 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think Giles would go into great detail; and I don't think he would leave out the whole, ""The slayer died and CPR was done to revive her,"""

Intellectually, I know that actors aren't their characters and may well have nothing in common with them. But after watching them portray a group of close friends for so long, it's hard not to imagine (or hope) that these people have the same dynamic when off-camera and out of character, too."

buffy,3ccddc,HarlequinNight,4,Mon Jul 6 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I can't imagine trying to go through recovery with so many people ""watching"". Some hoping you succeed and some hoping you fail. Ack. I don't even want to think about that pressure. I really hope he can work toward sobriety."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,9,Tue Jul 7 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"Too bad he's sought help from Dr. Drew Pinski, hack psychologist to the stars.  (I think there was a time where he was earnest and a positive influence, but once he started to do things like ""Celebrity Rehab"" tv shows, he lost all credibility with me as a doctor who cares about his patients more than his checkbook.)"
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,6,Mon Jul 6 21:32:45 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about him but is there actually proof of him having shady practices? Helping people and making money aren't always mutually exclusive.
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,8,Mon Jul 6 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"He started a reality tv show called Celebrity Rehab. If he cared about folks' recovery, he would not be filming folks in their most vulnerable time for the sake of his paycheck so that the rest of the world can laugh at them as a spectacle of substance abuse. There's a big difference between offering armchair sex psychology advice to those who cannot afford it via a radio show where he was more than anything being educational.   But also:  here   “Celebrity Rehab” also reinforces negative stereotypes and myths about addiction — primarily the idea that abstinence through the 12 steps is the only hope for recovery. That idea may have been deadly for Starr and some of the other patients, like bodybuilder and actor Joey Kovar, who overdosed on opioids last year, and actor Jeff Conaway, who died of pneumonia that was probably sparked by an opioid overdose in 2011.   ...   However, psychosis is not considered a symptom of methadone withdrawal, according to O’Brien. “If someone becomes psychotic during withdrawal, it might be underlying schizophrenia,” he says, explaining that many people with addictions also suffer other psychiatric conditions.   also here from the Center of Inquiry  And another"

buffy,3ccddc,matsie,-2,Tue Jul 7 11:18:28 2015 UTC,"The show was not his idea.  He was approached by Bob Forrest with the idea and decided to do it in order to help people and spread information on addiction.  Just because someone is getting paid for something, doesn't mean that is their sole motive for doing it."
buffy,3ccddc,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:22:16 2015 UTC,Yes. And then he did the show. What part of it being fucked up and bad therapy do you not get? He was lambasted by psychologists and substance abuse counselers for doing the show.
buffy,3ccddc,CopyRogueLeader,-3,Tue Jul 7 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"So because a bunch other Doctors didn't like the premise that means they're right?  Dr. Drew has plenty of credentials as well.  I'd rather see someone helping people in any capacity than not at all.  Dr. Drew realizes that the show was bound to happen, but with him part of the process perhaps he felt he could actually help people.    Yes, the filming aspect of it is not typical in a treatment setting.  Perhaps it does have some negative value, but if a network is paying for these celebrities treatment and Dr. Drew is also seeing them in a private setting behind the scenes, what is the real issue?"
buffy,3ccddc,bondfool,2,Tue Jul 7 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"He's said some shit on love line that I think is pretty questionable. Basically if a woman called in and talked about exploring her sexuality at a young age, especially with foreign objects, she was automatically an abuse victim and when she stated that wasn't the case, then she's obviously repressing trauma and doesn't know herself as well as some fucking radio dj."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,11,Tue Jul 7 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"Could it be that Celebrity Rehab was the only way some of those people could afford treatment? Like Nick said, treatment is expensive, even for the famous."
buffy,3ccddc,ominous_squirrel,6,Mon Jul 6 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"It's not effective treatment and it's not the way anyone who is undergoing treatment should be receiving it. Being filmed in your most vulnerable time, while also in a fit of substance abuse, which will also have a tendency to coincide with celebrity vamping will impact your chance of recovery IMMENSELY.  Here, get some really bad treatment, have your dirty laundry aired on national television, have people see you convulse in a seizure from withdrawal while your roommate laughs at you AND HAVE THAT IMMORTALIZED ON TELEVISION. Yep, you'll do fine after this. That treatment is a trigger for further backsliding.  It's not right. No one who really cared about a person's recovery would film it to be shown to a national audience...and filmed specifically so it can be SENSATIONALIZED."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,5,Mon Jul 6 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"I grew up on Loveline and thought Dr. Drew was the bee's knees. Listening with adult ears, it's clear that he's as big of an egotistical ahole as Adam Corolla but hides it behind his nerdy glasses. One episode he yells at a parent who decided to allow their born intersexed child to grow old enough to choose whether they wanted surgery and which kind. Like, wot?"
buffy,3ccddc,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Jul 7 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"Yowza. I didn't even know this. Was this on an old Loveline ep or a more recent one?  The one thing I noticed even as a young teen listening to Loveline in the early aughts, any time a teenager would call and say they were gay, Dr. Drew instantly asked if they had been sexually abused. It made me think there might be something wrong with me because I was 13 and pretty sure I liked other girls."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,-10,Tue Jul 7 18:25:13 2015 UTC,Such an ignorant comment.  Just because you disagree with the premise of the show doesn't mean the guy is a hack.  It also doesn't mean people didn't get the help they needed on the show.  Dr. Drew offered continued private treatment after the show was finished to everyone who was on it.
buffy,3ccddc,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"It's not an ignorant comment. You don't know shit about recovery. And you're an asshole, dude."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,-7,Tue Jul 7 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"You don't know anything about me, don't tell me what I know about recovery you goon.  Your comment is ignorant because it isn't based on fact.  You say Dr. Drew created the show, he didn't.  You say Dr. Drew doesn't care about the people on his show, he offered them all treatment off camera as well.  In your other comment you said Dr. Drew contributes to addiction myths because he follows an abstinent 12 step based recovery plan, there are plenty of 12 step based recovery success stories.   Addiction is not an exact science, different Doctors have different treatment plans that vary from patient to patient."
buffy,3ccddc,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Jul 7 00:38:58 2015 UTC,"No there aren't. 12 step programs have been definitively disproven for efficacy. My comments ARE based on fact. They are advocating for science based medicine and for proper care given to those experiencing substance abuse issues.  It doesn't matter whether or not he created it. He started the show with producers. He was the star and there was no Celebrity Rehab before him. Don't try get me on some dumb semantics. Celebrity Rehab was NOT proper substance abuse therapy and did NOT have any of the cast members' medical and mental health as top priority, which is what any physician should have. It was exploitative and gross and contributed to the deaths of multiple cast members BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RECEIVE PROPER CARE OR METHODS WITH PROVEN EFFICACY.  You're an ill informed schmuck who needs to shut up and actually read about substance abuse recovery before you say another goddamned word. You don't know shit about what you're talking about."
buffy,3ccddc,czerniana,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"I've met people who have used 12 step based recovery and have been sober for years and I've met people who say they hate it.  It varies person to person.    I'm not going to argue on behalf of a reality show that I don't care about, but I will reiterate my point, just because the show itself isn't the best representation of treatment, doesn't mean Dr. Drew is a hack.  Being board certified in addiction medicine is a far cry from a hack. He's helped plenty of people outside of reality TV and I'm sure there is plenty more that goes into celebrity treatment beyond what is shown to us on television.  I understand your point about it being exploitative, but these are all consenting adults.  They know what they're signing up for.  Odds are it isn't their first time in rehab and odds are it isn't there first experience with a camera.    All the times I've seen him interviewed on either TV or podcasts he has never once come across as a person in it for a paycheck at the expense of someone who is genuinely sick.  I'm just defending the guy based on what I know about him.  Not sure why that makes me a schmuck, but alright. Haha."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:35:21 2015 UTC,"Gods you're an angry person.    I've never seen the show, just advertisements for it.  While the premise of video taping someone's recovery for entertainment is disgusting, I can't help but look at the celebrity world and substance abuse as a whole.  While I sat in a waiting room for my own therapy today I was reading through a magazine that was dedicated to criminals behind bars.  There were so many repeat offenders for DUI's and substance abuse.  My own experience with a decade worth of therapy and hospitalizations has taught me that relapse is simply a fact of life when it comes to recovery.  No amount of having support or not having support seems to matter.   Four deaths out of 43 addicts  (according to the article I read) And at least three of those deaths had to do with prescription medication abuse, which is essentially a daily temptation.  While I disagree with the premise of the show I still don't think those numbers are any different than what I've seen in therapy.    What proper care didn't they receive?  Is it possible they were getting it off camera because let's face it, therapy isn't exactly riveting stuff."
buffy,3ccddc,czerniana,2,Tue Jul 7 03:50:56 2015 UTC,No. I'm not an angry person. I am someone who actually knows about recovery and has an emotional reaction to being called ignorant by someone who has no idea what they are talking about. Don't make a blanket statement about someone because of how they reacted to someone who insulted them.
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,0,Tue Jul 7 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Their original response did not appear to match the reaction, which is why commented."

Maybe look at time stamps and the multiple threads? THey were rude so then I called them an asshole and continued supporting my points about substance abuse and recovery but now with a more aggressive tone after being insulted. So again, don't characterize someone without knowing them or caring to see full context."
buffy,3ccddc,matsie,0,Tue Jul 7 11:14:38 2015 UTC,"I never insulted you once.  This is a discussion forum, me pointing out that you are incorrect is not me being 'rude' to you.  I called your insult toward Dr. Drew ignorant because by definition it was.  You lack information of Dr. Drew's credentials and his dedication to his medical practice in general,  which contradicts your insult about him being just some ""Hack Psychologist to the Stars"" which just isn't true."
buffy,3ccddc,czerniana,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"I am aware that relapse is a fact of substance abuse. Maybe instead of characterizing me as angry you should look at my first responses before I was insulted instead of the ones to a user that insulted me? I talk about relapse, ethics in care, efficacy of method. These celebrities don't receive that care and that bad decision by Dr. Pinsky has tainted his reputation and rightly so."

Giles has a really nice speech about why he loves books and doesn't care for computers, which ends with a prototypical Joss line:   the gaining of knowledge should be... well, smelly.    Still, it's pretty low on the list."
buffy,3ce1pq,Flamingmonkey923,6,Wed Jul 8 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"It's a terrible episode, but there are 2 scenes that come to mind as being at least half decent.    Firstly, I particularly like the scene where the nerdy guy decides he does't want to help the robot-demon-guy (can't remember the name), so the computer starts writing the nerd's suicide note. I think it's reasonably unsettling and pretty well done.  And the one at the end with Giles and Jenny, as already mentioned."

That part at the end where it's revealed that Xander remembers everything but refuses to acknowledge that because it's too embarrassing really left a sour taste about Xander in my mouth--like, for several seasons. I mean, seriously?! He tries to rape his friend, and instead of acknowledging what happened, he just pretends he doesn't know? Does he even slightly care about or even consider Buffy's feelings on the issue? Does it even matter to him that the experience of that may have been traumatic for her, even if it wasn't really his fault? No. All he cares about is not having an awkward conversation.

buffy,3ce1pq,likesomuchwater,2,Sun Jul 12 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"And that made his resentment of Spike in season seven seem really hypocritical to me, too. Like, okay, Xander was possessed, but Spike didn't have a soul/moral compass to work with. Is it really that different? Because, to me, it looks the same: both of them were turned into predators by outside, evil forces, and neither of them would've acted that way if they were their true selves (either soul-having or not influenced by hyena spirits). It's not like Xander was a totally different person; he still understood who Buffy, Willow, etc. were and had all his memories of his relationships to them. So, really, when Xander was angry with newly ensouled Spike for his (obviously disgusting) actions without a soul, it just came off as insanely hypocritical. I mean, damn, at least Spike acknowledged what he'd done and tried to make it right rather than sweeping it under the rug, pretending it had never happened, and refusing to acknowledge that Buffy could've been negatively affected by the experience.  Just to be clear, of course, I'm not defending Spike's deplorable behavior. I'm just pointing out how terribly Xander handled things and what a double standard he seems to have here."

buffy,3c9mbp,legobunny,10,Mon Jul 6 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"How I interpret that is Cordelia is blaming Buffy for her heartbreak by bringing Xander into her life. If Buffy had never come to town and made Xander ""remotely cool"", Cordelia never would have dated him.   The twist(?) is that she wishes vengeance on Buffy, not Xander, by wishing her gone. Although as we see everyone suffers from that. Its still relationship related vengeance, it's just not directed at the heartbreaker but instead at his wingman(?)

buffy,3c9mbp,YouJellyFish,14,Mon Jul 6 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"In every instance I can think of, every wish granted by Anya resulted in harm to the person who made the wish.  In The Wish Cordelia herself is killed.  ""she turned a man whose girlfriend wished he were a worm into a Sluggoth Demon"" that ultimately terrorized her further  ""Anya massacred a group of fraternity boys by summoning a Grimslaw Demon to rip their hearts out."" which traumatized the girl who wished they ""could feel what it's like to have their hearts ripped out"" (paraphrasing here) far more than their cruel prank ever could have.   For a thousand years I wielded the powers of the wish. I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared and worshiped across the mortal globe...   ""for the pleasure of the lower beings"" appears to be her pejorative - er, prerogative (whatever, Umad) and so obviously there are some management issues that affect what she can and can't grant.  It also seems as though she can't just come out and tell someone that if they make a wish for vengeance, she can and will grant it. It all has to be of their own free will while unaware that it's actually possible. So naive innocence also seems to be a prerequisite. You can't be aware of it, and that's probably rooted in the same clause that prevents Anya from granting her own wishes.  So even if she could make the stretch that Spike would harm Xander if she removed the chip, it still has to be his own idea.  But beyond ALLLLLL of that...   why the fuck didn't he wish the chip away?   ...no one at that time except for Halfrek even knew that Anya had returned to the fold, and a good amount of scoobies have had bad experiences with wishes (Dawn even expresses that she doesn't even use that word any more)  So Spike could have made that wish and she probably could have granted it, but it would still be up to Spike whether or not to actually act on it (he was drunk at the time he was talking to her) and so the fulfillment of the wish was still left up to the free will of an individual; in every other case, Anya only grants wishes that guarantee chaos (until her ""soft serve"" phase later on)  And if we're taking the ""something shitty has to happen to the wisher too"" thing seriously, she'd probably have to lobotomize Spike to balance it all out in the first place, making him probably incapable of carrying out his drunken pledge and, you know, ruining the show by making James Marsters go full retard.  (All of this is IIRC plus some scrubbing through relevant episodes... any corrections are welcome)"
buffy,3c9mbp,nutbastard,2,Mon Jul 6 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"And if we're taking the ""something shitty has to happen to the wisher too"" thing seriously, she'd probably have to lobotomize Spike to balance it all out in the first place   It probably depends heavily on how he phrases it.  ""I wish I could kill Xander"" might mean that Xander got turned by Dracula and has been ruling Sunnydale as his agent for a couple years.  ""I wish I'd never gotten this stupid chip"" could mean that Adam ends the initiative before they can chip him, but has created an army of half-human, half-demon monsters to take over the world.

""Grant me [arbitrary thing] and I will somehow use it to harm X"" seems far too indirect and prone to abuse. The next step could be wishing for a million dollars ""in order to make X really envious"".  There's no good explanation for how this wishing works, but while vengeance demons have discretion in how to grant a wish (Anya references specific spells and demons she's summoned) there's clearly some kind of entity enforcing rules (since she can't grant her own wishes), and entities like that usually hate a smartass, and would either refuse or alter the wish to prevent Spike from getting a side benefit out of it.  For example, if he wished for the ability to hurt Xander, the effect might not apply to anyone else. Or it could fail since he technically has the ""ability"" already; it just hurts him a lot."

buffy,3c9mbp,DaddyCatALSO,2,Mon Jul 6 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"Spike probably wouldn't have done it to hurt Xander anyway since he's in love with Buffy, it would've been moot."
buffy,3c9mbp,Ashley_batemen,2,Mon Jul 6 05:50:48 2015 UTC,Underneath it all Spike understood that the chip was his artificial soul and without it he might not love Buffy. He didn't logically think this out but it contributed to him not thinking of the idea.
buffy,3c9mbp,JollyJeff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Well, is this really a ""plot hole""? A plot hole is a mistake, or something contradictory. A missing element.   From what I remember of the scene, both Anya and Spike are angry from being dumped, neither is thinking clearly; and they just end up boinking for their vengeance against Xander and Buffy. I mean, Anya wasn't even aware of Spike's relationship with Buffy at the time. So she didn't even know it was vengeance sex on Spike's part.   So, I think the takeaway is they did something that they thought would satisfy their need for ""getting even"" with Xander and Buffy for hurting them, but it didn't work. They didn't feel better, it didn't make things better for them.   Removing Spike's chip wouldn't make sense at that point in the story and would unnecessarily complicate things. I know the attempted rape scene gets brought up a lot here. How would that have played out if Spike was chipless? The chip also comes into play in season 7. And I have to say it's never even occurred to me that Spike should've wished for Anya to remove his chip.  Edit: words and commas"

buffy,3c2qr3,legobunny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:25:16 2015 UTC,I just looked at that; it looks very pretty with the extra paper stuff and everything. But the reviews are rather bad actually.  How much unique content is in that book?
buffy,3c2qr3,Beloit,3,Sat Jul 4 09:29:13 2015 UTC,"I bought that book because it looked cool, but after actually looking through it I gave it away to a friend because I already knew everything in it from other sources. To me the whole book felt like one of those Buzzfeed-style ""15 things you didn't know about Buffy the Vampire Slayer!"" lists which when you click on it turns out to only have stuff that every fan already knows, like ""Joss toyed with the idea of making Xander gay instead of Willow"" and ""Spike was supposed to be a one-off villain""."
buffy,3c2qr3,legobunny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:49:01 2015 UTC,"I concur with /u/Beloit. I got it for Christmas a couple years ago -- I enjoyed flipping through it and looking through the paper props, but it's not super informative for people who know Buffy well.  Then again, I did get it as a gift -- maybe that's why I like it more? :P"

He does put in some spoilers for future episodes to make a point at the end of some of the videos, but there is fair warning. Also, don't read the comments.   However, I would advise avoiding all things Buffy outside of just watching the show. There are casual major spoilers everywhere. However, you can post here and we will keep your threads spoiler-free. We would love to read your reactions.   If you are watching on Netflix, there are spoilers in the episode descriptions, so avoid reading them ahead of time.

I haven't actually started it yet so I can't say whether it's good/spoiler-free, but it might be worth a shot. They're only at season 2 right now though, so might not meet your watching pace."
buffy,3c29m9,Rorplup,45,Sat Jul 4 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"Willow was maturing and getting more powerful the whole time. It made sense to me, it was like a coding problem you have to sleep on, but over a longer time frame. You smack your head against a brick wall for long enough, the problem becomes internalised, and then later BLAM your brain solves it in one go with barely any additional effort."
buffy,3c29m9,fraac,11,Sat Jul 4 02:38:08 2015 UTC,So basically your subconscious keeps working the problem while you do other things right?

Years later, you've become much more proficient at whatever it is you do, and for whatever reason, you're reminded of that old problem you were stuck on so long ago, and you realize, ""Hey, I know how to fix that now!"""
buffy,3c29m9,OSX2000,2,Sat Jul 4 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It's more that when you're trying too hard to work on something you might kinda start to get lost in the problem. Taking a break and then coming back with fresh eyes can help you see the problem in a whole new light, and how to solve it much easier."
buffy,3c29m9,venom8599,24,Sat Jul 4 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"Willow actually brought her back for a few seconds in season 4? during the episode where anything she said became true, but turned her back when she said she wasn't strong enough to do it.   After the major power boost she got from season 5 I think she just realized she could do it."

buffy,3c29m9,neoblackdragon,2,Sat Jul 4 11:54:25 2015 UTC,Well the point of all of that was Willow had a lot of power she didn't know how to normally tap into. By later seasons she knows how to do it very consciously.

buffy,3c29m9,lecherous_hump,5,Sat Jul 4 14:31:52 2015 UTC,I saw it as her realising she could use loopholes within magic to get better results and it was that kind of thinking that led to her abandoning the traditional ways of magic and later abusing it.
buffy,3c29m9,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Jul 4 09:43:53 2015 UTC,"It is a quick and lazy way to bring Amy back. But it also works in-universe, because Willow had become powerful enough at that point."

Meanwhile, you'll spend time focused on other closely related things that allow you to develop and progress, and after some time, you'll be at a point where what was (or seemed) impossible is now easy (or at least not terribly difficult). All you need is to realize that you're now much more capable of doing that thing you'd struggled with in the past."
buffy,3c29m9,barre_chord_reality,0,Sat Jul 4 11:13:39 2015 UTC,The thing is she still didn't know how to do it even before she had the very short thought and knew the answer.
buffy,3c29m9,snailshoe,3,Sat Jul 4 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"I just finished graduate school for mathematics and in my experience doing rigorous math proofs, this makes perfect sense. There are times when I need to prove something I spend lots of time pouring over it, I look at the hypothesis, I try to make a bridge between that and the conclusion, and I hit a dead end. So I let it percolate for a while. There have been some proofs that have taken a long time to come to me. When it does, it's like the light comes on suddenly and boom - the answer is there. Often times when this does happen, the solution is so simple and elegant.   Some may say that math is quite different than magic (I only occasionally agree...) but the thought process is similar in this way. At least that's my take on it."
buffy,3c29m9,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was quick and lazy, seeing how it took her three whole years to bring her back successfully. I thought it was another great slow burn that once fully realized added a great dimension to the show.   As a plot device, Amy served many purposes, one of the more obvious ones was steering Willow towards dark magics."
buffy,3c29m9,snailshoe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:46:45 2015 UTC,"My problem was with how she just spoke to Amy, had a think for a second, said a magick word and the spell for  Amy was there.   That's it."

They're relatively short episode by episode recaps that do an excellent job of delving into the themes and structure of the show.  Most other podcasts don't go any further than ""Here's what happened, and here's the parts I liked!"", which can be OK at times. But these two hosts bring some nice analysis and well thought out discussion to the show.  I believe they made it through season 5 of Buffy and season 2 of Angel before they went on hiatus early this year. Can't wait for them to start back up again."

buffy,3bxqk7,JBHoTep,83,Fri Jul 3 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, SMG is playing an unhinged Faith pretending to be Buffy -- I think at some level wanting to actually be Buffy by the end -- but somewhat lost as to Buffy's current life. IMO she gets some of the body language right, rolling her shoulders and just general differences of posture.  I think they both did alright jobs."
buffy,3bxqk7,venom8599,6,Fri Jul 3 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think SMG struggles to play evil well? Her as Faith being Buffy, her as the first and her as Shiobhan Martin in Ringer all read incredibly similar to me.   Aww, now I'm sad about Ringer being cancelled again :("
buffy,3bxqk7,Lyco_499,11,Fri Jul 3 12:54:14 2015 UTC,She did better as the First than she did as Faith.
buffy,3bxqk7,e101,5,Fri Jul 3 16:57:55 2015 UTC,I guess that's a fair point. I was watching that episode last night and was taken by how well Eliza acted. I do think smg does a better job towards the end
buffy,3bxqk7,aofb031985,23,Fri Jul 3 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"I've actually felt that Eliza Dushku over does it in the very start of Season 3. I feel like she's playing too much of the ""tough girl type"" The more I watch Season 3 the more I think she's so forced. I don't think she's really a great character until the end of Season 3. Maybe I'm just anti-Fatith. I haven't watched Angel but plan on it soon so maybe I'll change my mind."
buffy,3bxqk7,Mac720,32,Fri Jul 3 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the first time I watched the series I kind of couldn't stand Faith. I thought the season 3 finale was awesome, but Faith just bugged me for pretty much the same reasons. It wasn't until I rewatched that I realized they really were trying to drive home the point that Faith is Buffy, just a Buffy that never had a support system. She wants to be good so badly, but everyone kind of distrusts her from day one. Especially Willow and Xander. This episode made me really feel for Faith and the pain she goes through realizing that she doesn't hate Buffy, she envies her. After all, she is still a misguided teenager coming to terms with the same power. I now just take her embracing that side of herself to be a direct result of the fact that that's what everyone expected of her, and she hates herself enough that she just leans into it all the more. It broke my heart a little bit and made me see Faith's side a little more. Especially why she was so close to the Mayor. He was a supportive father figure, albeit an insane one, but a loving person in her life nonetheless."
buffy,3bxqk7,gyver210,9,Fri Jul 3 02:37:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I never really got it until she showed up on angel, then season 7. She seemed a little looser and much more interesting of a character."
buffy,3bxqk7,bunhead,7,Fri Jul 3 01:53:22 2015 UTC,"I had this thought at one point also, but then someone pointed out that Dushku is playing an abused teen girl who's running from her past, and Faith is playing a badass tough chick. Watching it again with that in mind, it became a little more bearable. You can see nuances of it up through the Finch incident, and its only after that, when the Mayor takes her in, that her mindset changes. The Mayor encourages Faith to take the horrors of her past and channel them into the violence and evil that comes with working with him. That, along with his unconditional acceptance of her, which she never got before, is what helped her embrace being 'the dark slayer' and made her performance after that more believable."
buffy,3bxqk7,Sassafrass23,21,Fri Jul 3 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"I think they both did a great job. SMG's character was far more complex as she was Faith pretending to be Buffy...really multidimensional stuff. Eliza had to play straight Buffy who is far more subdued than being Faith.  I think both did a great and believable job. It is obvious they tried to recreate speech patterns and body movements. That being said SMG blew me away in this aspect, she nailed some of Eliza's movements, while catching herself as Faith and trying to transition into Buffy."
buffy,3bxqk7,EveryGoodNameIsGone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:19:03 2015 UTC,I agree. I thought SMG did awesome playing Faith as Buffy. Buffy as Faith just wasn't in the episodes as much.

buffy,3bybj4,jayman419,24,Fri Jul 3 04:57:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the First is anyone. I think it may have been explained in the show that the First is a force of Nature. It is not Satan but the essence of evil. We have to remember that Buffy's world is different than ours. Glory is a Hell Goddess, does that not also qualify as a Satan type character? In Buffy's world, there are multiple Hell dimensions with various beings living inside them, so ""our"" Satan might not even be a thing in her world, or if he is, maybe he isn't even important."
buffy,3bybj4,bunhead,7,Fri Jul 3 06:08:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you when you say the first isn't the embodiment of anyone in particular.

buffy,3bybj4,comradeKatze,7,Mon Jul 6 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think some things in the bible are held to be true in the Buffyverse.  Example: Spike talks about the crucifixion in a way that implies that it really happened, and there were some vampires there to see it. Crosses and holy water hurt vampires, so there must actually be some spiritual power behind them.   So Lucifer could exist, but I don't think he would be the first, since the first is older than old and Satan makes his first appearance in something written a hand full of thousands of years ago.  Something fun to consider: Another point in the buffyverse is that humans' scope of things is pretty limited. Most people don't know about demons, other dimensions, or magic.  This makes it possible that the thing people call ""satan"" is actually a bunch of different demons or entities that people mistook for the same thing."
buffy,3bybj4,neoblackdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:01:30 2015 UTC,Well we have seen plenty of demons who look like Satan. It addition what some people know of characters from the bible actually comes from films or various versions.
buffy,3bybj4,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"I was never sure about the crosses and holy water. Crosses are actually a fairly universal human symbol for good in many ancient religions, but the specific meanings differ. And why wouldn't a menorah work?  As for the Crucifixion that occurred (or didn't occur) as a historical event; the simple event doesn't imply the religious beliefs attached to it by some. and for all w e know some of the human viewers were sired later? Sometimes I agree with Spike:-)."

It is not Satan but the essence of evil.   Two great answers. Let me continue with this. Let's say that Lucifer was actually the hell god of a dimension in the Buffyverse. (I don't know if he is one way or another...) Then think about his story. What caused the pride in his heart? What caused him to want to be like God? Where did the evil come from that was so very attractive to him?   The First.   That's just my take if in fact there is a shared hell dimension between 'verses."

That last fight in the Master's warehouse ... with the slow motion, seeing characters die so callously at the hands of their friends ... I can't watch that episode without feeling something in the pit of my stomach, y'know?"
buffy,3bxox4,TreeDefiesFire,4,Fri Jul 3 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"It's dark, but not THAT dark. I mean, the framing of the episode is Cordelia in a light-hearted ranting about her condition. We as the audience have to assume that everything we are watching isn't actually reality and everything will be back to normal at the end of the episode. What would really be dark, is if there were no way to reverse the new reality and the show had to continue in the new universe, Rick and Morty style. That would have been risky...  There are much darker episodes, in my opinion, because they happen in the reality of Buffy's universe, like Seeing Red, Villains, or Dirty Girls.    Needless to say, I'm not the biggest fan of The Wish. It's interesting, but I can't get into it like most people do. Hey, at least it's a good setup for Doppelgangland."
buffy,3bxox4,pober,4,Fri Jul 3 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Spot on. “The Wish” commits Original Sin - hitting the reset button.

buffy,3bxox4,DeadNotSleepingWI,2,Fri Jul 3 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with your main concept. This ""waking up from a dream"" concept (I am sure there is a specific term for it that I can't recall) is one of the first things an instructor tells you not to do in a creative writing class on the topic of how to end a story. I assume the reason is because it's just too easy when you write yourself into a corner and kind of a fuck you to the reader/audience. However, I think Joss Whedon's skill in character development makes it okay. We got to see awesome sides of characters that we would have otherwise missed out on, and I really enjoyed that. I loved this episode. Overall, I think I would have liked to see some of these alternate universe episodes become two or three parters in order to really explore hidden character aspects.   On a different topic.  I would have loved to see them turn Giles evil at some point so we could have seen him if he would have never turned away from evil magics. Him and evil willow as a duo would have been killer.   edit: we got just a bit of it in Band candy, but I would have liked to see more."

buffy,3bxox4,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"On a first-order plot level, you are absolutely correct; there is nothing wrong with the original universe’s being restored. The amulet can do that.  However, BtVS sparkles largely because it spends most of its time on existentialism/absurdism (the second order) and postmodernism (the third order). Neither of those philosophical/storytelling strains would see just resetting the universe as an acceptable conflict resolution, absurdism because it posits that the fundamental characteristics of the universe are unknowable and therefore unchangeable & postmodernism because it would see the amulet as a tool that submits to oppressive power structures.  Mark Field over at his blog (http://unpaidsophistry.blogspot.com/2012/03/wish.html?m=1) makes a terrific analysis of the episode, to which I am indebted."

buffy,3bvjvv,rettgoat,14,Thu Jul 2 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"I recommend you simply read the synopses on either Wikipedia or the Buffy wikia. Everything's already typed up there, and I don't see what the added value would be of typing everything up again to post it here. Seeing as you only read 3 issues of season 8  (that's when Warren is reintroduced), that would leave 37 issues to type out again for season 8, 20 for Buffy season 9, 20 for Angel and Faith season 9, and thus far 16 of Buffy season 10 and another 16 for Angel and Faith season 10, and that doesn't even include the spin-offs like Willow Wonderland. That is a lot.  But to answer your specific questions:   I read something spoilery about Tara coming back, but it wasn't clear. Is she?   No, she is not.    Also did the Xander/Dawn thing end and if it did what was the fallout like?   They're no longer together. Dawn had her emotions ""reset"" to when she was just created, so she only has a crush on Xander like she did in season 5. It was awkward and they broke up, but neither was happy with that.   Angle was super duper powered and he and Buffy flew around and did some crazy stuff. I didn't understand most of it. Did then end up normal and together?   Buffy and Angel were gifted superpowers by the universe so they could survive the coming apocalypse and create a new, perfect universe. But Buffy refused and both lost their super powers. They are not together.   Also Anya is Xander's mom?   Uhhhhhhhhhh what? No she isn't.   Where's Faith during all this?   In season 8 she's running around with Giles, in season 9 she's running around with Angel to try to resurrect Giles after Angel killed him, in season 10 thus far she was recruited by Kennedy's Slayer company to find Riley after he disappeared, and then she moved back to England to help out Angel and the people of Magic Town (part of London that got hit by a magical plague)."
buffy,3bvjvv,Beloit,2,Thu Jul 2 15:42:24 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot!  i appreciate it.  I'm really glad the Anya is Xander's mom was a joke and not something someone seriously did.
buffy,3bvjvv,Kanotari,6,Thu Jul 2 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the wikia link for you, but just in case you don't feel like reading it, I'll summarize.  To answer your questions, no Tara does not come back. Andrew gets a chance to resurrect her and wants to atone for his sins as a villain, but Willow is able to talk him out of it.   Xander and Dawn have a relationship for a while, but for reasons I'll get into later, Dawn kinda emotionally gets reset back to the point when she was created. She still cares about Xander, but she's not in love with hi anymore. Only Xander is still in love with her, which creates some awkwardness between the two of them in season 10.   Faith isn't featured much in the Buffy comics because she and Angel have their own comic series, creatively named Faith and Angel. Faith sort of becomes a guidance counselor for the Slayers for a while, then she ends up working for Kennedy's private bodyguard company.   Anya is not Xander's mom. No, nononono. Thank god no.  Yes, Angel and Buffy got superpowers. To sum things up, they were possessed/influenced by a force called Twilight and fucked a new dimension into existence. Which they then promptly abandoned to save their home dimension. No, they did not end up normal or together, though this is mostly due to the fact that Angel (under Twilight's influence) murdered Giles. At the moment actually, Buffy is tenuously with Spike. But speaking of dead Giles, the plot of the first season of Faith and Angel comics revolves around resurrecting Giles. They are successful, though for some reason, Giles comes back as a young teenager instead of an adult.   I'd be more than willing to type out a small novel-length rendition of all the comics, but I think the wikia is pretty concise and thorough. Let me know if you have any other questions though!"

He even does that destructive/possessive thing where he gives her a ""way to go out"" if he's not around any more.

From the moment of her introduction into the show, she has a front of strength and bravado. And yet as her character progresses we see glimpses into who she is underneath the facade. Another thing that reminds me of an abuse survivor is the way she so quickly (and seemingly easily) shuts down emotions. It may seem cold to the casual observer, but it's actually a great survival skill learned early on. We really see this when she kills Allan (Mayor's assistant).   Also the lack of ever getting close to anyone, no friends, and no family. The way she clings to the abusive and loving father figure in her life. The way she sees herself as dirty, evil, and wrong. I could go on and on.  All this being said, I don't think that the relationship with the Mayor was meant to be allegorical of molestation. I think that the character of Faith really showed quite realistically what it is like to have gone through that kind of abuse as a child and what it is like as an adult living with those consequences without facing them."

buffy,3bs3jd,retconk,57,Wed Jul 1 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"For example you could say the hyena episode was a metaphor about gangs and how dangerous they can be.   That was the point of the episode. It wasn't a subtle commentary on pack mentality.   Willow's magic addiction could be used as a metaphor for drugs.   Also exactly what the writers intended. The drug metaphor isn't in any way hard to spot. Willow goes to a pusher who gives her a free taste to get her addicted, she goes into 'rehab', tries to stay away, has a relapse, loses relationships and friends, heading downward at an increasing rate until she hits absolute rock bottom and is only saved by the love of her friends.  The Faith/Mayor storyline is definitely about abuse of power, and someone manipulating someone else with the promise of love and affection. The methods the Mayor uses are absolutely along the lines of those a sexual predator would use, but there is no sexual aspect to the relationship so I don't think ""molestation"" in the physical sense was in the writers' minds, even metaphorically."
buffy,3bs3jd,TheCheshireCody,28,Wed Jul 1 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the most important part of the Mayor-Faith relationship is that he gave her the affection and unconditional positive regard that she craved. Faith is what Buffy would be if she didn't have the love of her friends and mother, and Faith was seeing some progress while she was part of the in-crowd, but once she started to sense rejection (and those fears were manipulated by her fake watcher and realized when she killed the Mayor's assistant), she couldn't be helped by the Scoobies anymore."

She was raised to kill monsters and had nothing else going on for her, unlike Buffy who didn't even knew about Slayers and Vampires until being called.  When Faith is called, she screwed things up and got her watcher (her father figure) killed. She comes to Sunnydale, and sees Buffy, her complete opposite, with a loving family and friends. Things she was taught since she was a child were things the Slayer can never have, but this girl named Buffy has. She sees this as an injustice.  Throughout season 3 we see her being more and more isolated, until she accidentally kills Allan. Now, on the show we see Buffy's point of view. But imagine from hers. She is 16ish, she just killed a human, she doesn't know what to do, and she has nobody. When she says it was Buffy, nobody believed in her, even if was only her word against Buffy's, for her was the World vs. Faith.  It was only natural to Buffy to became the enemy. So since everyone she knew in Sunnydale now was against her, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so an alliance with The Mayor was her only option.  She at that moment was broken, and for better or worse, who put her back together was The Mayor. He provided for her, he taught her, and gave her a direction. She was a person who was since she arrived at Sunnydale looking for a 'parent', and the only one who accept the role was The Mayor.  Of course he at the start was playing her. He was a master manipulator and knew how to pull her stings. But just like any romantic comedy of the 90's, what started as pretend, became real for him, and instead of pretending to care for her, he truly started to care, and in the end she really became for him the daughter he never had.  Faith was a metaphor for how some people in the end are the product of their environment and of how people perceive them. Several times throughout the show, Faith could've ""come back"" but others pushed her far back again, including Buffy, because of her own prejudices towards Faith.  Side note: Her over-sexualization, in my opinion, was fear of being abandoned. She doesn't open her self up to feel for others, fearing being abandoned in the end, like with her mother and watcher. So her expression of her sexuality becomes emotionless. Just sex."
buffy,3bs3jd,TheDemonHauntedWorld,2,Wed Jul 1 22:51:45 2015 UTC,"Her watcher was a woman, not a man, so that would be a mother figure. It's also implied that the vampire that killed Faith's woman watcher also raped her. Faith says something along the lines of ""There aren't words for what he did to her."" This is why she wants to fun away from him in FH&T.   I think her relationship with the mayor might be a metaphor for corrupting influences, such as a friend who leads you to drugs or a gang. She is very alone; see ""amends"". Let's not forget, however, that The Mayor loves Faith in a very real way."
buffy,3bs3jd,milewskia2,7,Thu Jul 2 09:02:02 2015 UTC,I never liked the addicted to magic storyline.  It seemed forced and rushed.
buffy,3bs3jd,Cindy_Lou_Who,-8,Thu Jul 2 00:00:00 2015 UTC,Okay. What does that have to do with Faith and her relationship to the Mayor - which is what this thread is about?
buffy,3bs3jd,Algernon_Asimov,3,Thu Jul 2 00:35:18 2015 UTC,Read the post again.  It's mentioned at the end of the first paragraph.
buffy,3bs3jd,Cindy_Lou_Who,-5,Thu Jul 2 08:34:50 2015 UTC,"It's mentioned as an example of high school issues treated metaphorically, to bolster the OP's case that the relationship between Faith and the Mayor was a metaphor for molestation. But, hey, if you want to ignore the heading and the majority of the text, and disregard the central theme of the post in favour of one minor sentence which isn't relevant to the main issue... I suppose that's your prerogative."
buffy,3bs3jd,Algernon_Asimov,0,Thu Jul 2 09:14:46 2015 UTC,"By this logic, were you to read Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, during the infamous Snape kills Dumbledore scene, you would be completely ignoring the conversations and viewpoints of the other characters, the scenery, the overall setting, the weather involved, etc, in favour of the MAIN EVENT. Because I mean, none of those things are relevent to the main issue. Which is Snape killing Dumbledore.  By your own logic, it would be downright stupid to discuss anything else going on in the text, because you are disregarding the central theme, which is one character killing another. Hell, let's just write books from now on that don't possess any random thoughts or descriptions at all, let's just write novels full of to the point sentences, so people like yourself won't get confused when others want to discuss something that was briefly mentioned.   But then again, you're so pompous and trying so hard to sound like an intellectual, you'll find fault in this comparison as well. Because it certainly doesn't correlate to the discussion of the Mayor molesting Faith. And any outside thought bothers you enough to speak in a condescending manner towards other people."
buffy,3bs3jd,Mquestionmark,9,Fri Jul 3 22:10:27 2015 UTC,I see the Mayor's relationship with Faith as a twisted version of a father-daughter relationship. It's like two people who have read about fathers and daughters trying to go through the motions with no idea about how things really work.
buffy,3bs3jd,Algernon_Asimov,5,Wed Jul 1 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, if only because Faith had that dream while in a coma of a picnic with the mayor, and it was all very sweet. I think they could have made their relationship metaphor explicit at that point, but since they didn't, I'm gonna go with what Faith thought. I think your idea was really well argued, though - look at this great discussion!  I would like to add, though, since we're on the father-daughter thing, why the hell didn't Giles step up and make sure Faith was OK? You're just gonna let a kid roll into town and live in a dive motel and continue to dote only on Buffy? Come on. Giles just completely went with whatever the children in his care decided, and Faith got totally fucked. Hmph."
buffy,3bs3jd,paperandcloth,4,Thu Jul 2 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, the Mayor very explicitly told Faith this was not about her sexuality- might've been one of the factors in her later growth and why she trusted him as long as she did."
buffy,3bs3jd,DaddyCatALSO,4,Thu Jul 2 21:05:33 2015 UTC,"I think you are reading too much into it. In my opinion, the Mayor really cares for Faith."
buffy,3bs3jd,angryelves,3,Thu Jul 2 03:42:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a metaphor for molestation, as much as it was a fairly obviously abusive relationship. The way the Mayor indulged her when she did as he wished - but not by giving her things that benefitted her, but buying her possessions he wanted her to have, like a knife to do his dirty work, a dress not in her style - and came down hard on her if she showed her own mind on tried to act on things he didn't explicitly approve of is all standard abusive behaviour. I do think he cared for her, in his own way, but it was a pretty straightforward abusive relationship to me, and they don't necessarily contain a sexual aspect."
buffy,3bs3jd,arrpix,2,Thu Jul 2 02:21:23 2015 UTC,Did you see her reaction to getting the knife? I think they were a couple of messed up people who were on the same wavelength so could have a straightforward nice relationship.
buffy,3bs3jd,fraac,3,Thu Jul 2 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that she was pleased with the knife, I'd also add that once he got her into the dress and told her she was pretty she liked that. However, he still got her the knife with the intention of her using it, rather than it being a what-would-Faith -like kinda gift.  I also agree they were both messed up in ways that put them in the position to have that father-daughter relationship, but I think the Mayor was just so used to being in control by that point it had to be an inherent part of the relationship - that he got the last word, that everything went as he wanted it and it only worked because Faith was desperate enough for easy approval and a had a strong desire not to think about her actions so that she was willing to go along with whatever he wanted so long as she then got that approval."
buffy,3bs3jd,arrpix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:48:33 2015 UTC,I disagree. Yes he probably intended her to use the knife but Faith likes weapons. The dress was more about how she wanted to be as opposed to what he wanted. I believe the Mayor genuinely wanted to make her happy and understood that some aspects of herself were just lashing out.
buffy,3bs3jd,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think he thought he wanted to her be happy. I'm definitely not saying he didn't care about her, tbh I think he himself was surprised how much he did end up caring for her, it's just there was also definitely an abusive dynamic to it."
buffy,3bs3jd,arrpix,2,Sat Jul 4 20:59:42 2015 UTC,I think it was more there to add a relate-able side to the mayor. I think it was a genuine relationship and was more a comment on indoctrination than molestation. Indoctrination is often done out of love but causes fanaticism. I think there was more implication of Faith being damaged BEFORE coming to Sunnydale and the Mayor saved her.  Also it's no real secret that Joss Whedon dislikes government and sees the sort of right-wing patriot as being a destructive and manipulative source.
buffy,3bs3jd,Fullnerd,2,Thu Jul 2 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's as clear cut as that. The mayor certainly used and manipulated people, but remember that Faith had already made the choice to go down the dark path before even going to the mayor - in fact it's the reason she went to him and offered her services. She clearly wanted to be there (at least to begin with).   I think in a way working for the mayor was the easy solution for her - much easier than trying to do right. And I also believe that the mayor's love for her was genuine in it's own twisted way. He certainly wasn't faking it to manipulate her - if he had been then Buffy wouldn't have been able to bait him with Faith's knife in the final fight. Plus it was obvious from the way he flipped out when Faith was in the hospital that he cared for her.  So no, I don't think it was as simple as being a metaphor for molestation, or for any one thing in particular."
buffy,3bs3jd,JangoF76,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:30:13 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you.  Faith wasn't going down the 'Evil' path before the mayor.  The episode Want Take Have is a what happens when rebellious teenager meets Slayer strength.    Faith accidentally killed the guy in the alley and she thought the Scoobies wanted to lock her up.  The Mayor swooped in at the perfect time to gain the trust of a scared insecure girl and then seduced her with gifts and money and a sense of family.
buffy,3bs3jd,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Sat Jul 4 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"The mayor didn't 'swoop in'. He sent Trick to kill Buffy and Faith. After Faith killed Trick, she approached the mayor off her own bat and offered to work for him. She chose that path. Nobody manipulated her into it, least of all the mayor."
buffy,3bs3jd,JangoF76,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right,  I totally forgot that she went to his office and was like ""I hear you have an opening.."".  I just have a hard time blaming Faith for turning to the Mayor."
buffy,3bs3jd,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:12:21 2015 UTC,Faith had a bad background. I'm thinking some men have tried to sexually assault her prior to gaining her powers and other abuses.
buffy,3bs3jd,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"I know some of her backstory was that her Watcher was killed by that old Vampire Kakistos.  He pursued her, following her everywhere trying to kill her until her and Buffy slayed him."
buffy,3bs3jd,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Sat Jul 4 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"When I read the title to this I kinda rolled my eyes, but you're reasonings are pretty sound.  I never looked at it that way.  The Mayor's gift giving to Faith is absolutely the sign of some type of predator.  Typically they'll 'groom' their victim gaining their trust and then slowly use manipulation to get what they want out of the person.  That describes the Mayor and Faith's relationship perfectly and even though it never went to a sexual place I could see how that could be a ""Slayer-ized"" interpretation of it."

There are great story lines, fantastic character builds, and really good crossover episodes. The episode ""I Will Remember You"" makes me ugly cry every time I watch it to this day. I'm actually surprised that people watch Buffy and don't get incredibly curious when there is a crossover and not just go ahead and watch it."
buffy,3btnnz,pober,3,Thu Jul 2 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"OK, I recommend watching Angel, but don't expect it to fill the Buffy void. The only cure for lack of Buffy is more Buffy. In fact, the first time I got done watching Buffy I wanted to watch the whole thing again immediately.   Now Angel does have crossover episodes, but honestly, I found them not to be as great as everyone says they are. Some are very good, but Angel has a very distinctive difference in tone to its originating show, so it was hard for me to think of Angel in a Buffy mindset.   Angel, in the first season is very bland and derivative (not just from Buffy, but from a lot of other television) in some places. But by S2 it is very much a show that can stand on its own, and by S5, it's a show that's better than most TV. The series finale is the best finale I have ever seen."

It is my favorite show, ever, too. I cannot believe I missed it the first time around.  The show absolutely changed my life. It gave me courage to write a book and now I'm a published author.

I mean if you know some history, you know Etruscans came after Egyptians, or the Tunguska Meteorite occurred well before WWI. Any vintage pop/ 50s rock music hobbyist knows the Flamingos' I Only Have Eyes For You came out much later than 1955, & any serious geek knows not all Dr Who ep.s are on DVD, in fact many of the Hartnells are lost completely, but Red Dwarf was available in late 2001, and the Babylon 5 collector plates were never issued.  Actually, it strengthens the possibility the Buffyverse is not just parallel supernatural universe, but an outright alternate history. Which means maybe Sarah never won a Daytime Emmy, David isn't in a popular detective show, Aly known for her comedy etc, maybe they don;'t exist at all!

buffy,3bphts,dbutlerjr,25,Wed Jul 1 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"The chip may have acted like a primer - a way for him to see that he can live without violence (to humans).  I think that without Buffy, he would not have sought out a soul.  We know that he was capable of love, guilt, and joy as a soulless vampire long before Buffy came around.  But he also needed Buffy's shining example of someone who has a soul, who is spunky, who can live on the edge, and who can fight for good every time.  He sees her and he knows that he will not lose who he was, but he will transform.  Spike has always been under the sway of all the powerful women in his life.  He's always attracted to opinionated and strong women, and they have all affected him deeply.  In leading him on and ultimately turning him away, Cecily turned him from a poet to a broken man.  Drusilla changed him into the soulless Spike.  Buffy showed him what a soul could be.  After the infamous bathroom scene, Spike knew that he had to make a choice.  I think it's really important that Spike chooses this path on his own.  He's seen what having a soul is like, and gaining one is all downsides for him: pain, guilt, hurt.  Buffy's example is inspiring, but he knows who he was with a soul.  He was a man living with his mother and being rejected by his muse.  Nobody asks, expects him, or even knows that there is a way for him to gain a soul.  Spike figures it out and does it.  This was Spike's way of righting even older wrongs than his relationship with Buffy, chip be damned.  tl:dr; The chip played a part in his ability to recognize that he no longer needed violence as he once did, but I think the major reason was for Spike to take back control of his unlife, regain his moral compass, and figure out once and for all what kind of man he truly is."
buffy,3bphts,kaellynn,9,Wed Jul 1 03:30:01 2015 UTC,"Also, the reason he came back to Sunnydale to begin with was because of his strong attraction to Buffy after Season 3. He stuck around Sunnydale because he became obsessed with her. So yes, the chip allowed him to stick around long enough for his character to develop, but I still think he's better than Angelus because if Angelus had a chip, he still would have found a way to torture them. Angelus would have manipulated them and emotionally abused them. I would compare Angelus locked in a cage to Spike with a chip. Angelus would've rather died than get his soul back, literally."

Both were forced to stop being monsters, and eventually chose to be heroes instead.  I'd say that Spike's redemption was better written than Angel's, a big part of which is that the show matured a lot in between. Angel's soul is treated like a Jekyll&Hyde button - Angel and Angelus are completely different persons, and all you need to do to turn one into the other is give him a soul or take it away. Angel later mitigated this by making Angel himself darker, but Angelus remained an unambiguous monster.  Spike's change was more gradual and less linear - he was capable of doing good without a soul, and he was capable of evil after getting it (mostly counting his nearly killing Wood after defeating him, since the other stuff was done under hypnosis)."
buffy,3bphts,kaggzz,3,Wed Jul 1 08:29:57 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you but you have to realize that a vampire is the human without the filter of goodness. Angel was an angry, angst-filled guy who rebelled against his authoritative father for no reason other than he was angsty. Angelus was evil in the same way, lading out for chaos and against authority.  Spike was a horrible poet seeking acceptance as a human. As a vampire he was still seeking that acceptance. You get the feeling that if Angelus didn't kill a slayer then Spike never would have, and if that first slayer had gotten him the acceptance he craved then he'd never of killed another."
buffy,3bphts,venusdances,5,Wed Jul 1 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I'd have to disagree with you there, that we know of, Angelus never killed a Slayer. That was a Spikes thing, he sought out Slayers, Angelus avoided them."
buffy,3bphts,kaggzz,2,Wed Jul 1 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"That is true, you are correct.  I should have put it in that Angel gives Spike the idea that the only way he could be hardcore and with the group is if he kills a Slayer, so Spike goes out to do that."
buffy,3bphts,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Wed Jul 1 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Jekyll Hyde"" thing you were talking about it is because Angel has had his soul for a very long time.  He's learned over a century of time to suppress the demon side with his soul.  Once the soul is removed, all that self control vanishes with it leaving you with the raw demon.    Essentially, the longer you have a soul, the more drastic the personality switch when it's lost."
buffy,3bphts,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:52:51 2015 UTC,Angelus is actually cursed. Spike is not cursed.   I think the spell prevents Angelus from becoming a better guy. It forces a Jekyll and Hyde persona. There is no peace or equilibrium.   Spike is a merger and thus the personality endures.  Then again Angel can be quite ruthless when pushed. Hell he can be even worse because Angelus is in it form the carnage but he never hates.
buffy,3bphts,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go as far as saying Spike's ensoulment was a merger.  I think Angel has to be more reserved in his personality due to the nature of his curse being a moment of happiness.  Spike can really be himself at all times allowing a more fluid transition, but really we have no comparison because we haven't seen a soulless Spike post season 7."
buffy,3bphts,CLAXP,8,Sat Jul 4 21:03:02 2015 UTC,He'd doesnt give a piss about atonement or destiny.
buffy,3bphts,BlooregardQKazoo,6,Wed Jul 1 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"Spike is very clearly still evil in season 4, no doubt. I don't think anyone would argue otherwise and I don't think examples of Spike being evil in season 4 really changes anything.  But later, when he still does not have a soul, he chooses to do good and even seeks out his soul. Angel, on the other hand, when he gets his soul turns into a pure, evil, sonofabitch. Sure you can always fall back on the chip excuse as having gotten him there, but Angel had his soul forced on him and that experience has only served to make soulless Angel more evil.  Comparing Spike and Angel, with souls, there's an argument. Compare them without souls and Spike is clearly better than Angel.   Would Spike have become good without the chip? Of course not. But how he responded to it does matter. The chip gave him the opportunity and he seized it."
buffy,3bphts,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Wed Jul 1 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"I actually have a theory for this.  It is stated that Angel after first getting his soul still killed humans.  He just chose serial killers and bad people to feed from.  As the centuries rolled on, Angel and Angellus became two distinct personalities.    Spike has only just received his Soul, therefore the differences between ensouled Spike and regular Spike are subtle.  As time goes on, it will be more drastic change, should Spike lose his soul at some point.  At some point the change would be as drastic as the Angel/Angellus shift by comparison."
buffy,3bphts,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"Angel was lost when he got his soul. Unlike present day, getting blood wasn't as easy, especially with Dru and Darla hanging around him.   Those first few months or years were difficult. He chose bad people because he thought he could live with it. He couldn't and so he stopped feeding off humans when he left Darla.   Spike had the luxury of having been off human blood for years and establishing some life that was compatible with having a soul. Angel  had no support at all. Then he got called into action straight away.   I do think Angelus is actually worse then Spike though. Spike loved Drusilla. Angelus was with Darla for the sex. He had no issue screwing other ladies or abandoning her. He wasn't hurt when she betrayed him nor did he care she was dead. Liam and Angelus are polar opposites. William and Spike are very similar fellows which makes Spike seem like the better guy since there is less of a difference."
buffy,3bphts,Zix117,2,Sat Jul 4 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Having just recently watched Becoming, that last paragraph reminded quite a bit of Whistler's voice over."
buffy,3bphts,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:13:49 2015 UTC,Angel is cursed with his soul. I think that actually gave him a few perks like being able to recall and perfectly draw faces. His curse makes it so he always remembers.  Now the curse is not for Angel. The curse is for Angelus. The demon has to go it's existence seeing Angel repent and do good. It's his own personal hell. The gypsies didn't give a damn about the souls well being.   Remember that there is a distinct difference between the demon and the soul. Angelus is not Liam. Angel is Liam with the memories of the demon Angelus.
buffy,3bphts,TheDeadManWalks,4,Sat Jul 4 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"In the last season of Angel, Spike uses this same argument that he's better because he chose to get his soul back instead of having it forced upon him as punishment like Angel. As Angel says in the same scene though, ""I heard you did it all for a girl."" and sure enough it's never really established whether Spike sacrificed himself to save the world or did it because Buffy asked him to.  What it really comes down to is what you think is better, ignoring your past to make a better future or trying to atone for that past despite all odds."
buffy,3bphts,neoblackdragon,2,Wed Jul 1 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"I believe Angel said ""I heard it was just to get into a girls pants""."
buffy,3bphts,undeadamerican,3,Sat Jul 4 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"No, he would never have become an ally if it weren't for the chip. Granted that I STILL have not read the comics so don't tell me what happens, but I think that's why Buffy couldn't love him, because she knew that any good he did was just because of his obsession with her and other selfish reasons."
buffy,3bphts,l0stcontinent,2,Wed Jul 1 15:59:51 2015 UTC,Considering the Scooby Gang was constantly rude to him-- didn't even want to want to like him-- I'm not surprised he was tripping over himself to go out of his way to see how he could help them out.
buffy,3bphts,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Wed Jul 1 14:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's as if he tried to kill them all...on multiple occasions...and never once was remorseful.  Silly Scoobies, always reacting badly to near death experiences."
buffy,3bphts,l0stcontinent,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"I can't help but think of how at least when Faith came back in S4, Buffy couldn't help but want to understand her. I think a ""good"" trait in a hero is treating others not based on who you think someone is, but based on who you are consciously becoming/what you believe in/stand for. Overall I think Buffy and everyone does a good job of this, but the ease with which that trait was foregone I think was a remarkable injustice to such the major character that was Spike"
buffy,3bphts,Zix117,3,Wed Jul 1 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that always bugged me. Spike is definitely more likable from an audience member's perspective than someone who knows him personally, so I understood why no one really liked him for most of the show, but they didn't even care when he was trying to be good. Through the latter portion of Season 5 and most of Season 6, Spike shows several times that he's devoted and cares about helping the Scoobies, but still the only ones that seem to be completely okay with him are Tara and Dawn, who get a disappointingly small amount of interactions with him, in my opinion. Then they almost all ignore that he got a soul in Season 7 because of one thing he sort of almost kinda did before he got it. Pretty frustrating as a Spike fan."
buffy,3bphts,Karn1254,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:22:01 2015 UTC,"I think that something that people want to forget about Buffy as a show, probably because they've been told the opposite by so many other things, is that it is pretty firm in portraying the idea that there is no inherent moral quality to love.   The show takes a hard line on the fact that if you don't have a soul you are evil, or at least inherently self interested. This is why the decision to have Spike be in love with Buffy turned out to be such a great piece of writing. It allowed them to eventually phase out the more gimmicky chip excuse by giving Spike a more powerful motivation to not kill Buffy or her friends, while making him a more interesting character to boot. And yet, their stance on souls resulted in me not being as surprised (shocked and horrified certainly) as other people seem to be by that bathroom scene. I don't think people want to think about the fact that in that moment, he still really does love Buffy, but he has no soul to justify not taking something he wants. Even his decision to go get a soul is self interested, and only once he has one can he eventually go all ""helping the hopeless."" Recently, the comics have had some comments on this, and I think they maybe take it too lightly, but I won't get into spoilers here.   So to answer the original question more directly: no? I think the chip is the only real (kind of lame) excuse for him to not be bad, and even then the scoobies barely have a reason not to kill him anyway. They might have considered introducing the whole ""in love with Buffy"" thing a little earlier, but I don't think they'd really fully fleshed it out yet."

buffy,3bphts,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"The only reason he sought out his soul was because he was obsessed with Buffy.  The demon in him can only experience love in an obsessive fashion because as a Human, thats how Spike was.  He was constantly seeking approval and love from the women in his life, the demon just nurtured the darkest parts of his already present nature.    His obsession with Buffy led him to get his soul because he knew it was only shot considering she loved Angel when he had his soul.  After getting it, he got more than he realized and with the soul came the ability to mature and grow as a person.  Once he had his soul could finally accept that Buffy had no feelings for him even."

It's so amusing to hear them review episode by episode and hear someone's fresh reaction to an older show.  Also she tries to predict what's going to happen which is hilarious.

buffy,3boqgs,TheDoctor_13,2,Wed Jul 1 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Each podcast is a review of one episode (they are going in order) and only discuss that and previous episodes.

So for the episode being discussed they both have seen it and discuss how 90s the lingo and clothes are, the writing for the episode, the themes, favorite lines from that episode, ect.  Then the person who hasn't seen the next episode makes predictions based on the title and general predictions for the season (liking guessing Angel would be and actual angel -ha!).  The one who has seen it does a great job at not giving a reaction to the predictions.  Also hearing the newbie become attached to the characters is great for reliving how I felt the first time watching it through.      On another note if you listen from the beginning the first episode (maybe two?) aren't the best audio quality.  But it improves immensely after that."

A lot of the episodes I felt apprehensive about first time around, I like a lot more, like I Only Have Eyes For You, Band Candy, and Nightmares.   I'm actually writing down notes from each episode of things that stick out to me. You end up noticing little details and character quirks that aren't mentioned a lot. For example, the first time I watched Triangle, I thought it odd that Willow was so antagonistic toward Anya. I had completely missed their relationship develop from season 3 (to be fair, it's kind of subtle). But after watching Doppelgangland and Choices again, it makes a lot more sense to me now."

buffy,3bj7l9,theDoctorAteMyBaby,77,Mon Jun 29 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"(Sorry for the long post, this episode gives me feels) Neuro Nurse here-Joss wrote that episode, it says in his biography that the surreal reactions of Buffy was his way of mimicking his reaction of his own death of his Mother from a cerebral aneurysm, which usually happens suddenly. I'm almost sure someone found her at home (most are). I'm not sure if it was him or not. I hope for his case, it wasn't.   I have seen families reactions to both conditions, Joss' Mother's aneurysm and a diagnosis of a Oligodendrogliomas (Joyce's brain tumor). The type of tumor Joyce had often grows for years until it is noticed, and then it starts to cause symptoms like headaches and personality changes. Joss himself has said (I can't find the interview) that there was nothing supernatural about Joyce's death.   The episodes where it shows the progression of Joyce's symptoms and Buffy and Dawn's reactions are some of the most realistic medical fiction I have ever seen. He didn't miss a detail, and I'm the type of person that will stop watching a show if they make a medical error because it makes me twitchy (House anyone?).   I also know Buffy's reaction to be true on a personal note. I am from a shitty small town and my first real job was working in the ER as a respiratory therapist/secretary/triage (yes, we were that small). I worked with the most wonderful group of people I have ever known. They were (and still are) that towns angel's in a pit of meth addicts and abject poverty.   Most people who worked there could have made more money working at a bigger hospital about 30 minutes away, but they stayed because we were family. The older nurses took me under their wings. (I started when I was 17, you didn't have to go to college to be respiratory back then. It was just a correspondence course). I wanted desperately to be a nurse, but the local college didn't take nursing students until they were 20.   One Sunday, one of the four Paramedics on staff at our emergency services called in a trauma on the radio. He was sobbing so hard, we couldn't understand him. We just thought it was radio interference.   When the ambulance arrived they were coding one of our 20 year veteran nurses, dead from a cerebral aneurysm. Her daughter (our physical therapy assistant) found her when she went to pick her up for church. I know how Buffy felt in that moment, the body was ice cold. She had been dead for a while.  The blood drained from everyone's face. We coded her for over two hours with a flatline. Not one of us shed a tear. Then the doctor called it, and retired to his call room to cry alone. I learned that day how to put on my ""nurse face"". For her daughter, my friend and co-worker in the waiting room. I had other people to triage, and no right to grieve for my friend and mentor at that moment.  When I watch Buffy, I often see her put on ""nurse face"" to protect Willow and the others from the danger she sees. I started watching it while babysitting my niece and kept watching it because it made me feel better to watch her physically battle evil and win. So often in my profession, there are so many gray areas. You can't punch a tumor.   I have worn many nurse hats over the years. Emergency Room, Burn ICU unit, Pediatrics, Neuro ICU, Neuro Stepdown and finally Cardiac Cath Lab. I have always turned to Buffy to soothe me on the days we didn't win the battle, or the war. I respect the writers of Buffy because sometimes her battles aren't supernatural in nature (Joyce, Parker, Tara's death). Yet in every instance her bravery still shines through.   If Buffy wasn't a Slayer with powers, I'm not sure who she would be. But, I like to imagine she would be in the medical or human services industry."

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little misty right now.

buffy,3bj7l9,synaesthetist,3,Tue Jun 30 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"True, but my point was that maybe it did cause the natural death, via sudden memory creation.  Unless Joyce took a cat scan before she ever got sick, they'd have no way to compare the physical state of her brain before and after Dawn."

buffy,3bj7l9,coolbeaNs92,15,Sat Jul 4 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's a theory that's been discussed before and I like it to be honest. However, for me personally, I don't believe that, although it's an interesting theory I've always enjoyed discussing.   Joyce was always the centre when it comes to normal reality in Buffy. At times, the magic of the Buffyverse collided with Joyce, but for the most part, Joyce was the link to the normal world. There's certinally no indication from Joss or any of the writers that the monks had anything to do with her brain tumour.   Joss was very clear about Joyce's death in that he wanted to show the pain and suffering, but from something that was natural. Also, it's stated many times that Dawn was created for Buffy. If the false memories were the reason for the tumour, why did it affect Joyce? The monks sort out Buffy because she was the Slayer and would do anything to project her family. You could say the same about Willow, Xander and Giles' false memories.   TLDR; Joyce's death for me was always abotu showing the pain and harshness of reality. Sometimes, there isn't a magic spell or a demon to slay that can resolve the problem. Sometimes, it's the mundane that can be the most painful."
buffy,3bj7l9,clockworklycanthrope,5,Mon Jun 29 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"i'm not saying it was in any way intentional.  But it seemed like they created Dawn in somewhat of a hurry, and the timing of Joyce getting sick, and Dawn appearing can't just be a coincidence.  Remember Willow's line ""It's just a matter of balancing the elements so you don't...shit i just caused a rainstorm"" (paraphrased).  Maybe the Monks made the same mistake."
buffy,3bj7l9,clockworklycanthrope,10,Mon Jun 29 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"Except that Joss has said Joyce's death was very intentionally natural rather than supernatural. It's a cool idea (and one that I certainly wondered about when Dawn was first introduced), but ultimately Joss determines canon and he says no.   Edit: It would've been really interesting if that had been the case, though. You have to wonder how that might've changed or influenced things between Buffy and Dawn, had she known."

I didn't do it!"" as they flee the sudden rain. It is shown, then, that the rainstorm was caused by Dracula's arrival, not anything that Willow did at all."

buffy,3bj7l9,leftmostcat,3,Mon Jun 29 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Drac can manipulate weather in the Bram Stoker novel, including creating storms. Considering we know Dracula has additional powers in the Buffyverse (further explored in the comics) and Spike suggests that the novel is a truthful account, I always took that as the storm being related to his arrival (especially considering the next scene is him coming ashore and bursting out of his box of ""special dirt"")."

buffy,3bj7l9,IraninaGenius,2,Mon Jun 29 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"""Correlation does not equal causation"" doesn't really hold up for a work of fiction where literally every element of the story is created on purpose."
buffy,3bj7l9,DaddyCatALSO,3,Mon Jun 29 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"Sure it does. It's entirely possible for a writer to not realize that two things could be seen as correlated and write them as entirely separate events, and that leaves alone all the other ways for correlation not to equal causation: dramatic irony in which the viewer is led to believe two unrelated events have a causal relationship, a correlation which the writer realizes but doesn't intend to be causal, multiple writers unintentionally creating correlated events, etc."
buffy,3bj7l9,venom8599,4,Tue Jun 30 02:13:43 2015 UTC,I've said this with other ep.s like Normal Again. Using the monks' spell to explain *anything * except Dawn's existence is a cheat.

It would make little sense to see all that different stuff, but not what was looking after.  And from a narrative point the spell looks like being written exactly to refute theories like yours."
buffy,3bj7l9,DaddyCatALSO,2,Tue Jun 30 09:17:44 2015 UTC,"It's not Joss's intent, and it's not how I read it, but I do agree that the text supports this interpretation, at least. It's definitely a valid interpretation even if I don't agree with you on it; personally I think it's a more powerful episode if there was no supernatural influence at all, even indirect influence like this, but I can't say that you're wrong for reading the episode that way.  There's nothing that contradicts it, at least. :D"

But there is no one true interpretation; you don't need to prove mine wrong or anything, yours is supported just as well as mine and they can both coexist as valid interpretations of the events.  Your interpretation makes perfect sense, but I'm still holding to mine because I like it better and it makes equally as much sense to me. :P"

buffy,3bg409,pober,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"The US version with the 4:3 aspect ratio. I know Joss Whedon wanting the show to be watched that way, but it just looks really blurry on an HDTV. Gilmore Girls, on the other hand, looks much better on Netflix than it does on the original DVDs."
buffy,3bg409,pober,6,Mon Jun 29 03:38:40 2015 UTC,"Well, changing the aspect ratio isn't going to do anything for the picture quality. The early episodes were filmed on 16mm while the later ones were filmed on 32mm, so naturally the quality potentially will be greater for a digital transfer for the later seasons. I couldn't find film details for specific episodes, so this is speculating a bit, but I think season 3 should look better. Seasons 4-7 are noticeably higher quality from seasons 1-3. I don't know how well the Netflix US transfers compare to the DVD set, but compare the screencaptures below from my Netflix, streamed on the highest quality:  S1 The Pack  S2 Innocence  S3 Band Candy  S3 Doppelgangland  S4 The Initiative  S4 New Moon Rising  S5 Tough Love  S7 Showtime  Please note that the difference is more noticeable when viewing the episodes  in full motion and not still captures."

buffy,3bg409,thesuspicious24,10,Mon Jun 29 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that Buffy came out 3 years before Gilmore. To better compare, you should only look at Buffy's seasons 4-7. Technology improved during that time. Also, what people below said about it being easier to remaster Gilmore as they don't have to worry about the special effects."
buffy,3bg409,oblivious247,3,Mon Jun 29 13:06:26 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's not in HD.
buffy,3bg409,milewskia2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"I get that. But why can't they do a proper remaster of Buffy like they did Gilmore Girls? They don't even have to make it widescreen if they're having issues with the camera crew showing up in the frame. They just need to make it sharper, brighter and more HDTV-friendly.   The Pivot HD remaster doesn't count since they fucked up the color temperature (i.e. scenes that were originally in warm colors look rather cold now)."
buffy,3bg409,synaesthetist,5,Mon Jun 29 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"Remasters aren't exactly an easy straight forward process.  On top of all the typical difficulty of remastering a lengthy television series, Buffy has issues that arise from its usage of special effects that would never be an issue for a show like Gilmore Girls."

I think I wouldn't mind as much if they had always been equally bad, but for a long time I felt that most of the descriptions (on the web version, at least) were pretty objective and gave a good idea of what the show/movie was about. Now every description reads like a winking, inside joke written by a highschooler who just read a CliffNotes plot synopsis...I realize I have no reason to be this mad about something so trivial but for some reason it really fucking gets to me haha"
buffy,3bbo2c,sealifelover5,2,Sat Jun 27 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably because they've been adding so much stuff lately. When they had a small selection, it would've been a lot easier to write good descriptions. I think the new ones are somewhat hastily done."
buffy,3bbo2c,Mquestionmark,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"this description of this particular episode has been there since Buffy was added to netflix, I know because I marathoned it all for the first time when they added it and was baffled by the description. I'd never watched the show and I was really confused when Dawn was the one with the diary."
buffy,3bbo2c,JangoF76,-3,Wed Jul 8 11:44:20 2015 UTC,Just don't read them then?

buffy,3bbo2c,AngryWizard,7,Sat Jun 27 19:00:20 2015 UTC,I actually reported this exact episode description error to Netflix customer service a year ago. Obviously my report didn't help.

buffy,3bbo2c,theoremofgoats,4,Sat Jun 27 18:54:17 2015 UTC,Sometimes I feel like Netflix is purposefully trying to deceive me with the episode descriptions. And the suggested related movies/shows are pretty funny sometimes too.
buffy,3bbo2c,theoremofgoats,5,Sat Jun 27 19:04:11 2015 UTC,I gave my friends a suggested watch list with episodes to skip / maybe episodes and I changed the name of the body so they wouldn't see it coming.   Maybe I'm just as guilty...

Graduation Day Part 2 was (I might have these reversed) The Ceremony in French and War in German. Something Blue (which had to be translated; the custom might exist in non-English speaking countries but the rhyme doesn't) had the descriptive and double-meaning title My Will Be Done in German and the rather silly The Marriage  Of Buffy in French.

buffy,3bceqg,Ciandotmov,3,Sat Jun 27 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"4:3 is the definitive intended aspect ratio for all the seasons of Buffy, which is what the US Netflix has. The BBC broadcast was 1.78 : 1 for seasons 4-7.   For Angel, only the first season was intended 4:3. The rest were broadcast wide. US Netflix has the wide versions of all the seasons of Angel. There are some technical issues with this that show up in the first season."
buffy,3bceqg,pober,2,Sat Jun 27 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"I can't answer the Angel question, but Buffy seasons 4-7 were in wide-screen for a couple years, then they announced that Buffy was leaving Netflix US. It didn't leave, they ended up renewing it, but it went from half and half to all episodes in 4:3 on the renewal date. It was weird when they switched it because I'd gotten so used to rewatching on Netflix instead of my DVD's. I don't think it's a popular opinion, but I really miss the wide-screen version."

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of high-res images of it out there, and it took me some time to find all the bits and pieces online before I could start designing it. It was a lot of work, but it was a labor of absolute love for the show (and vinyl).  The thing I struggled with most was the inner lyrics sleeve and trying to get everything to fit on the correct side. Thankfully there's less lyrics in the second half. Plus I wanted to include the write up Joss did for the CD release of the album. I did have to drop 2 tracks though ('The Mustard Song' & 'The Parking Ticket') due to length constrictions on each side of the LP, but I think it's a compromise I can live with.  I really want to do a small run of this album so bad, it's not much more to do 100 as it is to do a one-off. But I know that's not totally legal and as Faith-as-Buffy would say ""You can't do that. It's wrong, I'll kick your ass.""  Ideally I'd like to send it to someone in Joss's camp or someone at Fox and have them do a RSD release.

buffy,3b3hby,bwburke94,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"From the initial research I did when I started thinking about getting a one-off pressing done, I was finding that the majority of sites limited you to around 18 minutes of music per side. With the track listing I have right now Side A works out to 17:54, while Side B is about 18:29 (after I cropped some of the silence off the beginning and end of a couple tracks). So those 2 songs just had to be cut to make it all fit.  However, I’ve been look at a couple of sites recently and one said they could do a 33rpm LP with 20 minutes per side, so if that's the case I'll obviously add them back in and update the cover art.  The biggest thing for me is finding a place that will cut a one-off that's not a dubplate or acetate, which deteriorate with each play.

If you probe them more about it, they'll likely acknowledge that they can put more on, but they don't want to.  The more you put on one side of a record, the closer the grooves have to be. The closer the grooves are, the more likely you are to have technical problems related to that. Mitigating those problems costs more, and does not assure you won't have them. So from their perspective, they're accepting more risk the longer the programme goes. But you can get up to 30 minutes on one side of an LP.  If they allow it at all, it would probably only be with the agreement that you they accept no responsibility for it. In practice, that means no returns and no credit.  Now, that might seem enough by itself to cover them, but in their mind it's not. They worry about their reputation, not just their bank balance. They don't want unhappy customers. And holding customers to a comfortable 18 minutes is their surest way of keeping people happy.  When I worked at a label, we ran into the same problem with CDs. No factory would guarantee anything over 74 minutes. But in theory, you can get a good deal more than that on there, as long as you accept the fact that it's either going to skip a lot and not work in some players, or that it's going to be costlier, or both. I was working at a label at the time, and when we got in a disc with 80 minutes on it, I called up the label owner and personally congratulated him on it."

The line wasn't long at all, either for the photo op or the signing.  The signature line didn't move quickly, though, because he actually TALKS to his fans before signing. I hope you have a great time!"
buffy,3b3259,barry_47,8,Thu Jun 25 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your experience! I've been to a few conventions, never visited a Buffy alumni before. Beyond excited.  I love that he talks to his fans before the autograph! What a wonderful human. Waiting in line for a while to actually converse with James Marsters = worth it.  Side question, can fans bring in their own merchandise for James to sign? Example, could I bring one of my BTVS magazines or comics for him to autograph? Or will he sign my photo OP photo with him?  Thanks again :)"

buffy,3b3259,tif2shuz,3,Thu Jun 25 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"Check the schedule, because sometimes the photo op is after they're done signing.

buffy,3b52vj,Spongebobeatsmyfeet,7,Fri Jun 26 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Ben's childhood years, but I'm fairly certain that Ben knew about his Glory-ness at least throughout the entire season five; if not, the revelation for him was completely skipped over. Plus, when Dawn mentioned being the key pretty early on, he completely freaked out-so he knew what Glory was and what she wanted.  I think it's a fair assumption to say the minions knew as well. The only people in the show to ever be surprised were the Scoobies and Spike."
buffy,3b52vj,theoremofgoats,2,Fri Jun 26 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"So he knew what Glory was and what she wanted, and he did summon the queller to ""clean up Glory's mess"". but what sticks out to me still is he refers to her as a separate person. While some of that is explained through it being a red herring that they are two different people, I just wonder if at the point of when Dawn revealed herself as the key is when he and Glory started having issues keeping the other ""under"" while carrying out their Ben/Glory duties.   And that just answered my Second question. Ben and Glory must know that they are the same person because they most likely ""black out"" when the other is out. Now I wonder if the minions have always been their caretakers and let them know that or if Glory acquired the minions at an older age??"

In one episode (I forget which one specifically) Ben shows up to the hospital and finds out that he's been fired for not showing up for two weeks. In another Glory asks something along the lines of 'what's Ben been up to?' (Pretty sure it's when Buffy calls to cancel her and Ben's date and Glory gets the message). In the last one or two episodes Glory mentions being able to hear him, and when they're rapid changing back and forth there's a clear awarenes of each other that hadn't been there up until that point."

I've always wondered what Glory's life was like when Ben was a child.  She makes mention that she had been stuck in her human body for 25 years, so I can only assume she's been aware for that long.    Did Ben's parents wonder every 5 minutes why their son suddenly became a girl and then forgot about it afterward?  Was Glory a super strong Hell God even in the body of a baby?  Must have been a real awkward time as Ben growing up.  I can picture Ben getting an awkward lecture from his Father after being caught in a dress and heels."
buffy,3b4ytv,mumbanger,13,Fri Jun 26 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"I'd argue a few things:  1) Angel is from a different time:  1.1) Liam was born in 1727 in Ireland. the average lifespan was somewhere in the mid 30s. (it was 40 by 1750).  1.2) Marriage age during his time as a mortal actually had no minimum, until the 1760s when you had to be over 12 to get married.  This rule still applies in some US States.   2)  Where is Angel even going to find another woman his age? And how does age even work for vampires? he doesn't ""get old"" -- and he doesn't even move air, depending on the episode.    3) From a storytelling perspective, the romance  fit in very well with each characters overall arc. They each fed into one another's self destructive tenancies:   3.1) Angel got involved with someone who was sworn to kill his kind. He hated himself for everything he had done as a Vampire.   3.2) Buffy got involved with an older male authority figure, who her mother would probably hate if she ever got all of the facts up front. Early on in the series she repeatedly would subtly blame herself for her father leaving.   4) Dating was a lot more difficult before the internet, you know?"

And if old guys could look like they're young guys, I promise it would happen a lot.  What defies reality, though, is a 241 year old man being legitimately interested in the pubescent, hormonal, adolescent drama of dating and falling in love with a high school girl."

My idea of the relationship has always been that they actually are much more close in age emotionally than you might think. Angel was turned when he was around Buffy's age, but unlike her he was immature, selfish, and unsettled as a person. The Angelus years didn't exactly provide a lot of time for emotional growth, so in terms of his years as a ""person,"" we can count those out. Same with the years of gutter-living and rat-eating. The amount of time that he has had access to a social structure and opportunities for personal growth has actually been pretty short.   I mean, not that that necessarily makes him a good choice as a romantic partner. Just solves the question of why he would even be interested in someone so young-- he's of a similar level of maturity."
buffy,3b4ytv,uscmissinglink,2,Fri Jun 26 01:44:33 2015 UTC,Vampire don't age and they don't mature either. This is consistent with all vampire lore with vampire children remaining children forever.  So Angel is far older than Buffy but not more mature. The same is true of Spike and all others.  The biggest problem of Bangel is that Buffy will mature and grow old while Angel will not.
buffy,3b4ytv,IraninaGenius,3,Fri Jun 26 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree with you here. The whole mystique and lore of the vampire is that they have the wisdom and experience of age without the wrinkles. Consider, for example, Dracula who's age and experience are one of the things that make him formidable. And then there's Claudia from Interview with the Vampire, who has a woman's brain in a child's body."

Those numbers are down from earlier in the run but they are still doing well.    Another comic creator Kieron Gillen put up a blog post about sales and said:   Anything selling stably over 10k in single issues is a cause for celebration and joy. The creators are almost certainly extremely happy.  If you’re selling over 12k, you’re probably making more than either of the big two would pay you, unless you’re one of the very biggest names.  If you’re selling anything near 20k, you probably have to buy drinks for your friends.   Joss has already stopped writing them but I think it's safe to say that as long as the series continue selling this well, Dark Horse will find someone to write them."

Joss has also found a good team to manage their story-line, but Joss is still obviously in charge and is very much involved in everything that happens.   Buffy is something that I could see going for a very long time. I can also see Buffyverse transcending just Buffy herself.

Since Sweet asked who summoned him, Xander could have capitalized on that and said that he did to cover for Dawn."
buffy,3auerk,Gneissisnice,4,Tue Jun 23 21:25:53 2015 UTC,Xander should have spoke up sooner if he knowingly summoned a dancing demon and then people broke out into dance. Having him admit fault didn't make a ton of sense either so your view fits right in the way i see it
buffy,3auerk,IsaystoImIsays,11,Tue Jun 23 20:39:13 2015 UTC,Xander summoned Sweet for fun.   This was the worst part of episode.

Worse than Willow in Tabula Rasa in so far as he KNEW all the way through the episode what was happening and was lying the entire time. Typical Xander. What a doosh. I like the reasoning below though, that he's covering for someone, that makes a lot more sense and makes him a lot more heroic. Then we have to turn our ire on Dawn..."
buffy,3auerk,barre_chord_reality,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's the Hellmouth, so all sorts of stuff like that can happen. I don't think his intents of summoning Sweet were malicious in any way. Aside from that, it could have been anybody from the gang that summoned him, but it just happened to be Xander. The consequences (or lack of) would have probably been the same if it was Dawn, or Giles or whomever."
buffy,3auerk,Gneissisnice,38,Tue Jun 23 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Giles abandoning Buffy shortly after Once More With Feeling.  Buffy is at the lowest point in her life. Her mother is dead; she herself just died and feels like she's been ripped out of heaven and is feeling empty and depressed; she's now the caretaker of her teenage sister, who's been acting like a bit of a delinquent as of late; she's now the sole breadwinner of the family; and she still has to do all of her slaying duties while putting up with the hijinx of the Trio.  Giles felt that Buffy was relying on him too much, but leaving was the worst thing he could have done. For one thing, everyone's been living in her house while she was dead and now that she's back, they're all like ""Hey, get a job so you can pay for the house! Why don't you go back to school, you're missing out! Don't forget to do your slaying duties while we're carefree adults!"" all while she's suffering crippling depression. Giles helped financially a little bit, but felt like it was her responsibility to pay for things. Why? Slaying is basically a full time job and, unless Giles forgot, his job (and paycheck) revolve all around Buffy. In fact, he got his Watcher pay back solely because Buffy threatened the Watcher's Council. So she really earned that money, it doesn't seem like that much to ask for him to help out.   Buffy is 21 years old at the time, I believe. I'm 24, and if I was orphaned and put in charge of my little sister, you can bet that I'd still go to trusted friends for support, I don't think I'd be able to do it on my own. And I'm not a Slayer who was recently ripped out of heaven.   Kinda went on a rant, but my point is that Giles was extremely shitty for leaving when his Slayer needed him the most, and no one even said anything about it. It was a pretty awesome moment when he came back, but it was unreasonable for him to go in the first place."
buffy,3auerk,withdelight,7,Tue Jun 23 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"YES. This has always really, really bothered me."
buffy,3auerk,TheBarrowman,6,Wed Jun 24 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest problem with all of season six is that Willow (and, for a time, Tara) both live in the house with Buffy, but somehow neither of them are responsible for bringing in any money???? Why is it all up to Buffy, who has just been dead for MONTHS to earn all the money?  Well, that's my biggest problem after Dawn. I just hate everything about her."
buffy,3auerk,Gneissisnice,3,Fri Jun 26 06:49:50 2015 UTC,"I had a big problem with that too.   They're living in Buffy's house but she's the one responsible for running everything? She's been dead for months, give her some slack. But not only do they expect her to do it, they almost berate her, like ""What are you doing with your life? You have no job and you're not in school, do something productive"" while they get to be carefree college students."
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,5,Fri Jun 26 13:16:15 2015 UTC,"These are all good points. Giles was concerned by Buffy relying too much on him, but everybody else relied too much on Buffy. Since the former was addressed, the latter should have been too."
buffy,3auerk,rachiedoubt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like they were trying to represent what it's like to be depressed and have no one understand, or what it's like to have it be invisible.

buffy,3auerk,AngryWizard,77,Fri Jul 3 06:37:33 2015 UTC,"Xander falsely relaying Willow's message to Buffy as ""Kick his ass"", while certainly not in the category of terrible/evil, still deserved more than a fleeting moment of screentime in season 7 to address this blatant lie. Even if he lied for the good of many, I'd still like for it to have been addressed."
buffy,3auerk,jenniferwillow,14,Tue Jun 23 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"What if that had been Giles doing that though, had Giles told Buffy to ""Kick his ass""?  I think Xander rightly pinpointed Angel/Angelus as being far too chaotic and evil to be trustworthy.  And I think Giles had come to the same conclusion, and this were the roles reversed, would have done the same thing.  I don't think it was so much a right/wrong decision, as a better best decision made with all information from past events and current info."
buffy,3auerk,AngryWizard,12,Tue Jun 23 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not even saying it was the wrong decision in the grand scheme of things, I just wish it had been addressed. Coming from Xander (and assuredly influenced by his character in later seasons) it made me feel that it was less a wise and selfless 'for the greater good' than a more selfish 'for m'lady for her own good'. I get just as bent out of shape when Giles lies to her, the slayer test for example was such a betrayal."
buffy,3auerk,Tiekyl,8,Tue Jun 23 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting..  I wasn't mad at him for the slayer test at all...  He was TOLD to do that, and he ended up chickening out anyways and looking out for her in the end.   I'm absolutely livid at Xander for his crap with ""kick his ass"" though."
buffy,3auerk,The_Ripper42,4,Wed Jun 24 00:43:08 2015 UTC,I think most people agree this was a asshole move from Xander whose insatiable hatred for Angel (up to essentially forming a lynch mob with Faith) really made me dislike the character. That never changed.
buffy,3auerk,wr3nKingston,11,Wed Jun 24 07:54:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like Angel does this way more than Xander yet people don't hate him for it. He always makes decisions without telling anyone else, like in the angel episode where he becomes human or the whole Connor thing."

buffy,3auerk,sidvictorious,17,Wed Jun 24 00:20:08 2015 UTC,I have never understood the Spike bathroom thing.  I don't feel like it's underplayed at all.  What aspect do you feel is underplayed?  The act itself?  Buffy's reaction?  Spike's?
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,16,Tue Jun 23 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Spike is shown to be capable of rape. At the time he didn't have a soul, which is conveniently used (IMO) to explain his sexual attack on Buffy.   It makes it difficult for me to re-watch him in seasons 5 and 6 when he is pining away for her, as well as the missteps and blunders he commits (ala kidnapping Dru/Buffy). And it's a contradiction to the female empowerment that permeates the show for (most) of the Scoobies to ""forgive"" him rather easily- given how much Angel ""repays"" and strives for redemption in comparison for his many misdeeds."
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,10,Tue Jun 23 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"WARNING: THIS TURNS INTO RAMBLING  I'm curious what you mean about Angel repaying for his misdeeds, since you make it sound like he tried harder than Spike. If you're talking about in general, Spike experiences the same torture when he regains his soul. Angel had years of living alone, eating rats, to adjust to the constant haunting of the people he hurt. When we meet Angel, he's relatively well adjusted and just steadily works toward redemption.   When Spike gets his soul back, we begin seeing the initial period that Angel also under went - the isolation, insanity, and living off of rats. The difference is that Angel was alone. That sucks. Spike had Buffy actively looking out for him. This is why I have trouble comparing the two -- I feel like many fans think Spike got off easy when we really can't say what he was feeling (and seeing, and hearing.) For all we know, he's still dealing with the initial consequences and feelings of getting his soul back, all while living and working with the Scoobies.   I don't really think Angel had to work for forgiveness. Not to say that everyone forgot what he did, but they knew Angel before Angelus. That made it so much easier for them to see them as different people, and consequently trust Angel again. Had the Scoobies started with Angelus, they likely wouldn't have been able to trust Angel nearly as easily. Major advantage in Angels favor, if we're actually going to try to compare.  Spike did what he did because of a weird obsession/love. Angelus, as he revealed in Spike's early vampire days, just loves to fuck with people. Drive them insane and destroy them from the inside out - an extension of the womanizing Liam. Spike liked to feel power - a result of his humiliating William the poet days. Spike had emotional issues, which everyone could clearly see from moment he lost control over Dru. Angelus was always portrayed as truly evil.   I think I'm headed somewhere with this?   To say that Spike was too easily forgiven may be true, but we don't know what demons he was dealing with (literally.) Not to mention that the bathroom scene was am offense on Buffy. Something that she chose to forgive him for. I do hate comparing him to Angel, but Spike still was held accountable for his actions (Xander, Giles, Dawn showing animosity towards him). When Angelus became Angel again, the Scoobies kind of tried a whole forgive & forget deal almost immediately, despite the emotional difficulties (jenny :( )  Last thing, Joss hated Spike and loved Angel. He wanted Spike gone after a couple of seasons, but the fans adored him so he stayed. In return, Joss made him as pathetic and pitiful as possible. We are watching the show through someone else's eyes, which we can't forget. Of course, this kind of thing happens in every show. I just see it as a reason to try and not compare such complex characters.  Sorry that had like no structure   TLDR: Spike and Angel had very different situations and can't really be accurately compared and I just have lots of feelings about it"

I just see it as a reason to try and not compare such complex characters.   Is there like an interview or something confirming that Joss hated Spike's character?  Because honestly, he wouldn't be very interesting at all if Joss hadn't broken him down around Season 4 and made him pathetic.  Until then he's a fairly amusing, one-and-a-half-note character."
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,3,Tue Jun 23 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"There was some interview with James Marsters where he mentioned that he didn't think Joss liked him...Although in retrospect, he could've meant that Joss didn't like him, not Spike. Regardless, it is interesting to think about with movies/shows. If the writers have a particular personal like/dislike for a character, how well can they really keep it from affecting the viewers?"
buffy,3auerk,eadon_rayne,2,Wed Jun 24 04:19:14 2015 UTC,Ohhh I do think I remember that now that you mention it.  I can't really think of any instances that I know of where a writer hates a certain character but it would be interesting to see the effects for sure.
buffy,3auerk,strawberryf1elds,7,Wed Jun 24 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"I saw a thing where Marsters said that if Joss had written a specific episode, that meant he had the week off.  The impression I got from Marsters's interviews was that Joss was the Dread Pirate Roberts to Spike's Westley - 'good night, good work, I'll most likely kill you in the morning'"
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,2,Wed Jun 24 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"That is news to me. I remember seeing quotes from Joss about how Spike is the most fleshed-out of all the characters he's ever written, and also how he thinks Spike is the person Buffy is meant to be with because he's more interesting than Angel or Riley. I'm not sure where the idea that Joss disliked James or Spike is coming from."
buffy,3auerk,Bwyd,9,Wed Jun 24 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"I guess I see where you're coming from.  But just because it's the first time we've seen him attempt to rape someone in no way means that it's his first time doing it.  And as far as the Angel thing goes, I am a billion times more sympathetic towards Angel than Spike, but even I must admit that the show makes it a point to say how vile and monstrous Angelus was.  That most certainly includes, but is not limited to, rape.  And Buffy doesn't seem to have a problem with that in Season 1.  The show contradicts itself several times trying to decide whether it wants the souled vs. soulless vamps to be the same entity, part of their subconscious, multiple personalities, or just straight up different beings.  Angel's need for redemption seems to imply that they are indeed the same person, so we'll go with that.  If that is indeed the case, then there's no reason they shouldn't forgive him after he acquires his soul, in the same way that most of them don't harbor ill feelings towards Angel up through Season 2.13 and after he is re-souled in Season 3 (obviously Giles is a bit sore about being tortured and Xander hates Angel because he's both jealous of him and weirdly overprotective of Buffy, but for the most part they aren't mad at Angel himself).  Now Angel has had years to atone for his actions, but the only real difference between the two is that Angel was souled forcefully while Spike sought his soul out for selfish reasons (essentially to make Buffy love him, but not necessarily with the most romantic of intentions - in more of a spiteful way).  But what does it matter how they came upon their souls if they are so different with them compared to without them?  Their original intentions mean very little now because they are completely changed people."
buffy,3auerk,Blossomkill,2,Tue Jun 23 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"I think of it like this:  The soul is the true 'you' it has the moral compass but at it's essence it's what makes you you.  When a vampire takes over a person, their soul is gone replaced with the monster however the body (and brain) is still there. Your personally traits, memories etc all still exist which definitely has (to varying degrees) an influence over the demon that's now wearing your body as a human suit.   When the soul is restored, the Demon hasn't gone anywhere. It's just been pushed down, suppressed but is still there. Now this time the influence is reversed, the Demon's traits, urges and memories influence you, even going so far as whispering in your ear  (as shown with Angel and his dreams)."
buffy,3auerk,The_Ripper42,7,Sun Jun 28 11:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think (sadly) that sort of fits the profile of domestic abuse. He's convinced himself that she'll love him if only he can get her to sleep with him and in his mind the end sort of justifies the means. I really liked how they showed buffy suffering the after effects, even after she'd survived so much other violence without much trauma.   Also it's interesting that even without a soul Spike loves Buffy, and this dictates his actions in a warped way, whereas as soon as Angel loses his soul he takes pleasure in torturing her."
buffy,3auerk,Blossomkill,4,Tue Jun 23 19:47:19 2015 UTC,Angelus didn't love Buffy but he was at least as obsessed with her as Angel was.
buffy,3auerk,The_Ripper42,3,Tue Jun 23 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. I interpreted that as more of him being angry at himself for being ""weak"" by loving her though."
buffy,3auerk,Blossomkill,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:51 2015 UTC,I think that's largely true especially from his perspective. But if he had any sense he would've high tailed it out of Sunnydale after killing Jenny. That's what makes me think there's something there.
buffy,3auerk,The_Ripper42,5,Wed Jun 24 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"I agree :) but unlike a lot of buffy fans I actually think that Angel is one of the weaker characters. I can't get past the 200-whatever year old vampire and 15 year old girl who gets sexed so hard he loses his soul, which seems a bit Twilight for want of a better word. Also I think he suffers from not being part of later seasons where everyone gets better writing (I've not seen Angel)"
buffy,3auerk,TheBarrowman,3,Wed Jun 24 16:35:37 2015 UTC,He's definitely weak in Buffy and not even the best character in Angel. One of the things they did in Angel (minor spoilers) is make his personality more geeky but wanting to appear cool which makes him retroactively better in Buffy for me.
buffy,3auerk,sidvictorious,2,Wed Jun 24 22:13:04 2015 UTC,"I actually think that his lack of soul has less to do with his attack on Buffy than the way Buffy had ""trained"" him all season. All of their encounters had Buffy saying ""no no no"" and but really meaning yes. She'd basically trained him in ""no means yes"" speak. When he went for her in the bathroom, he thought it was the same as usual, because, after all, she'd been telling him no every other time they'd had sex. I do NOT mean that it was in any way right or that it was Buffy's fault, only that I can see the reason that this happened. To Spike's credit, he did stop when he realized that no really did mean no this time."
buffy,3auerk,TheBarrowman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:00:14 2015 UTC,"But there is no credit - he didn't stop on his own. Buffy threw him into the bathroom wall, cracking the plaster even. Buffy stopped him, and he ran away when he realized what he did.   The rest of what you said I can see how that would be an interpretation (and not to take the whole thing too seriously), but I interpret it as Spike being overcome by his feelings of lust and rejection and assaulting her. Just a different read."
buffy,3auerk,Bwyd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:51:25 2015 UTC,"That's fair. And it's true, Buffy did throw him off. But he did stop and leave when he realized what he'd done. If he really didn't care, he would've just shrugged it off and kept going."
buffy,3auerk,YoureASoldierBodie,2,Fri Jun 26 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"Spike is William the Bloody, he has brutally murdered, tortured and i'm sure raped countless others since 1880. People got too comfortable thinking him as one of the gang, he is evil. If anything the ""sexual attack"" on Buffy was a very minor crime compared to the Evil he has done over the years. (It's of course not 'minor' but if you compare to 100+ years of murder, torture and almost certainly rape it's a drop in the ocean)  He may love Buffy, but isn't a healthy normal live. This is the love from a soulless Monster, the fact that the stopped at all is shocking but I think is more due to the selfish love than any self realisation of wanting to be good. Spike wants Buffy, if he carried on he knew he would never have her again. He then went out to get a soul because that the only way he could get what he wanted. It was a selfish act which thankfully lead to something good.  Spike with a soul is as different as Angel is to Angelus. There may be shared personality traits but he is no way responsible for his action as a souless vampire as Angel is responsible for Angelus' actions. They can't help but be wracked with guilt because they still have the memories but from an outsider perspective we should not blame either of them for the actions of the Monster."
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,2,Sun Jun 28 11:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's nowhere near rape. They had a violent fetish sexual relationship thing, where buffy would always pretend to resist, which they both enjoyed. He was expecting the same thing but didn't realise she was really hurt, and really not in the mood. It's an uncomfortable scene but I think people make Spike come off way worse than it really is."
buffy,3auerk,YoureASoldierBodie,9,Tue Jun 23 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think the bathroom scene should be seen as ""nowhere near rape."" If he'd continued, with her actively resisting, that's straight up rape. The problem is the precedent they set where no means yes. If they'd been responsible about it (safe word?) that wouldn't have happened. Of course, that would take away the whole ""fire"" of it that made Buffy feel alive.   The bathroom scene was the logical extreme of a bad situation that Buffy and Spike both developed. That's why the bathroom scene is so hard to watch - Spike isn't trying to hurt her, and we know that. But he did. Just because he didn't want to rape her, doesn't mean that's not what it would've been. That, in my opinion, is the importance of the scene. It highlighted how terrible their torrid ""no means yes"" relationship was."
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,3,Wed Jun 24 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"If he'd continued, with her actively resisting, that's straight up rape   That's the thing. He didn't continue, He stopped as soon as he realised buffy was seriously saying no, rather than what she usually did. It's like saying if buffy and Giles were training, Giles fell over and and Buffy continued beating up Giles, that's straight up murder.    The bathroom scene was the logical extreme of a bad situation that Buffy and Spike both developed. That's why the bathroom scene is so hard to watch - Spike isn't trying to hurt her, and we know that. But he did.

buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,3,Wed Jun 24 06:05:23 2015 UTC,"I think we're having a confusion of meaning. No one said it WAS rape. Just that that's what would've likely occurred under the slightest change in circumstance.   Just to clarify, I'm a big Spike fan. But the only reason he stopped was because Buffy managed enough strength to push him off. It was only then that he saw the look on her face and understood what was happening. If she'd been more injured and couldn't fight him off, then yeah, he MIGHT'VE not gotten the hint and followed through. It's hard to speculate when he would've caught on in that situation. From their previous experiences, we could see Spike potentially seeing Buffy not fighting him off as her playing hard to get.   Just because in this hypothetical scenario where Buffy doesn't have the strength to fight him off, Spike doesn't think he's hurting her, doesn't mean it wouldn't be rape. It's stupid to say the scene was nowhere near rape when even Spike realizes that's where it was headed.   I don't think the bathroom scene was ""glossed over"" like the OP thinks. I think Spike got tons of shit for it and punished himself accordingly, even though he knew his intentions weren't bad."
buffy,3auerk,withmirrors,4,Wed Jun 24 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"You're right. Sorry, I guess underplayed is the wrong word in this sense. What I should say is that portraying this action as 'rapey' wasn't the writer's original intention at all. It came from a female writer who had done something similar to a boyfriend (as in, if I can make him have sex with me one more time he won't leave) but when this was transcribed over to a male doing it to a female (even if she is the slayer and stronger than him) it played completely differently. In fairness, they actually REALLY dealt with it a lot in the episodes afterwards, what I should have said was ""other examples of where writers underestimated the immorality of plot driven character actions""."

buffy,3auerk,eadon_rayne,2,Wed Jun 24 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"I HATE the way Giles and Buffy's relationship got trashed in season 7. They had such a GREAT relationship when Buffy was in high school. He was always in her corner, the first one to support her with whatever it was she wanted to do. But in season 7, it's just like all of their history is just thrown out the window and he's so sure he knows better than she does about everything."
buffy,3auerk,TheDeadManWalks,13,Fri Jun 26 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"Here's one that sort of works.  I wanted to see some consequences to Giles having killed Ben.  It doesn't make me like him any less and it was absolutely the right thing to do.  I mostly just wish that someone had mentioned it at some point.  Any lines of dialogue that reference it.  Nothing?  OK.  I remember in the commentary for Lies My Parents Told Me, the writer (Goddard, I think) was originally going to have Giles address it in a speech to Buffy, but then decided that nobody cared about Ben.  That may be true, but I do care about Giles and would have liked to have seen his feelings on the matter."
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,6,Tue Jun 23 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"Slight tangent: While this happened before Giles killed Ben, I always thought it was a really great foreshadowing on the part of the writers to add the ""You're a killer"" line said by Tara to Giles. The gang (and audience) all just took it as the ramblings of insano-girl, right until the end of the episode. Then it's like, 'Damn, good call Tara'."
buffy,3auerk,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Jun 24 02:07:43 2015 UTC,I noticed that on my most recent watch. She said a couple of really true things in her altered state. I love going back and seeing all of the hints and tidbits fall into place.
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,6,Wed Jun 24 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that it would have been good to see that coming up later but I think it remaining a secret works well from a storytelling perspective.  Giles is Buffys father figure and parents often do things to keep their children safe that they would rather not do and they don't talk about it because they don't want their children to see them differently. Giles shouldered the burden of taking Bens life and never passed that burden to anyone else because he knew that it was what he had to do to keep his children, and the world, safe."
buffy,3auerk,heymeowmeow,2,Tue Jun 23 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"Good point, I've never thought about it like that before."
buffy,3auerk,zbobby1990,3,Tue Jun 23 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, it felt strange to me that Buffy was willing to let them go. Glory was incredibly deranged and incredibly powerful and was responsible for so many terrible things. I get that Buffy didn't want to kill a human (Ben) but the idea of her letting Glory go strikes me as way more out of character than the idea of her killing a human for the massively greater good. I also don't really think of Ben as an innocent person because his actions in the last couple episodes were terrible. Admittedly, he was being influenced by Glory at that point but that's part of my point too. They aren't different people in my mind. They are two sides of the same coin and while Ben may be less harmful and dangerous than Glory, they are still the same being."
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,5,Tue Jun 23 23:00:20 2015 UTC,I get that Buffy didn't want to kill a human (Ben) but the idea of her letting Glory go strikes me as way more out of character than the idea of her killing a human for the massively greater good.   Especially when she was murdering Knights of Byzantium all over the place like two episodes earlier.
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"Great point! Though one could make the argument that they were a direct threat to Dawn and Glory wasn't anymore. But still, I think she should have killed Glen.... Bory?"
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,2,Tue Jun 23 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"I think she should have had to also.  Especially since she was talking big about killing her friends if they came near Dawn at the beginning of the episode.  Would have been interesting to see her have to follow through on killing an ""innocent""."
buffy,3auerk,BlackMoonWolf3113,9,Tue Jun 23 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"Xander straight up disrespecting and mocking Buffy's personal choices. If I were her, I don't think I could be friends with someone who openly shat on everyone I dated. His crush on her in the first few seasons was also pretty creepy- talking about wanting to see her naked, or about the things he'd do to her...TO HER FACE. I don't think I could be friends with someone who was that openly crude toward me, fully aware that I'm not interested.  Also she didn't want anyone to know about the bathroom situation with Spike. Xander took it upon himself to spill that information to Dawn, despite Buffy asking him to keep quiet. Whether or not you think the Scoobies ought to have known, it should've been Buffy's choice. It wasn't Xander's secret to tell."
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,5,Wed Jun 24 14:30:53 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you. Looking back, I don't think Xander ever 100% got over Buffy-he accepted that she was never going to feel that way for him, but he didn't get over what he was feeling. I also probably would have ditched someone behaving that way a long time ago-it was very disconcerting."
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,2,Wed Jun 24 21:21:22 2015 UTC,Xander = Not a good guy. Agreed.
buffy,3auerk,IraninaGenius,7,Thu Jun 25 07:48:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe this isn't completely terrible, but in the season three episode 'Dead Man's Party,' I was really bothered by how everyone was attacking Buffy about how she handled the situation with Angel. I totally get how they all had their own things going on, but I'm sorry, it all paled in comparison to being forced to murder the love of her life. Buffy needed some time away, and maybe she should have at least let them know she was okay, but I think it was pretty unfair for them all to gang up and accuse her of being selfish and all the other stuff-so she didn't handle it the best, but she DEFINITELY handled it better than anyone else would have at that point! The writers did a really bad job painting Buffy in the ""wrong"" light there."
buffy,3auerk,DoctorVenkman,5,Wed Jun 24 21:18:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! This entire episode really bothers me. Everyone gangs up on her horribly in the middle of her welcome back party.   Another pet peeve I have with this one. There are scenes showing that the character Pat had become a good friend to Joyce. Then Pat is killed by the zombies, dons the mask and becomes the queen zombie. Buffy stabs her in the eyes with a shovel after saying a witty pun. And there is never another mention of her again.  A throwback to the unceremonious treatment of Jesse. Just kill off Joyce's BFF with a funny pun. One of my least favorite episodes in an otherwise brilliant season."
buffy,3auerk,IraninaGenius,3,Thu Jun 25 16:13:43 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Buffy never wanted a huge 'welcome back' party to begin with-if I remember correctly, Buffy just wanted a quiet dinner with her closest friends and they decided to throw a big party behind her back-probably because they weren't really keen on spending much one-on-one time with her (shown by how Willow was pretty much ditching her all over the place).  I agree about Pat and Jesse too. Wasn't Jesse childhood friends along with Xander and Willow? If anything, there should have been at least a LITTLE grieving-yes, he was a vampire, and yes, he was trying to kill them, but there was a lost friendship, and Willow and Xander were the type who would at least mourn that."
buffy,3auerk,Shark_Lover1,2,Thu Jun 25 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Uh you're right, that annoyed me so much. There's Xander and co. laying into this damaged young person who has had to send the love of her life to hell via a sharp sword and has spent a summer effectively homeless and wandering. Never got it."
buffy,3auerk,Rockworm503,3,Thu Jun 25 07:47:04 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, Xander in general was pretty bad when it came to stuff like this. In season four, I think he basically brushes Willow off by telling her ""We all have pain"" after she tells him she's in a lot of pain after just breaking up with Oz. Yeah, listening to someone mope and cry about breaking up can get old after awhile, but it literally JUST HAPPENED. You'd think that for someone he'd been friends with for so long, he could muster up a little more sympathy and compassion. And then, at the end of the episode, Willow is the one apologizing for everything.  What."
buffy,3auerk,Lyco_499,7,Thu Jun 25 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"Buffy killing the zookeeper in The Pack. He clearly had it coming, so I'm not talking about guilt.   My only objection is that the show never emphasised that she is not only a slayer of vampires and demons, but on occasion, of humans as well."
buffy,3auerk,KingNorrington,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:36:33 2015 UTC,"Refresh my memory, I thought the zookeeper fell into the hyena pit? I feel like he killed himself by his own actions. Buffy didn't pull the trigger on that one (if my memory serves)."
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,2,Thu Jun 25 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"The zookeeper charges Buffy and she throws him over her head and over the fence in the hyena enclosure. He stands up and grabs the fence but we hear hyena growls and he falls back. Buffy moves quickly to the fence like she wants to help him, but gives up with a resigned and a bit disgusted face hinting that he was already dead."
buffy,3auerk,theoremofgoats,24,Thu Jun 25 16:29:58 2015 UTC,Willow in Tubla Rasa. Willow's forget spell (the one that blew up in OMWF) to fuck with Tara's memory. And let's not forget the car crash and bringing Dawnie to the magic drug dealer. All of that made me like her a hell of a lot less. She knew what she was doing espically before the magic abuse.
buffy,3auerk,lauren_strokes,28,Tue Jun 23 16:51:38 2015 UTC,Considering this led to Tara leaving her and drove a wedge between her and the others for several episodes before she could be trusted and the fact that it culminated in Dark Willow I don't think this counts because it was like the focal point of the season.
buffy,3auerk,isocline,12,Tue Jun 23 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"She also may have somewhat, slightly, sort of flayed someone.   Everything you think of plus the flaying are a great Buffyverse exploration of addiction though. Willow was addicted to magic, she did lots of terrible things while ""high"" or in the pursuit of that high. She acted incredibly selfish, put herself and others in danger and ultimately lost control and killed someone. But with the help of those she loves, she beat her addiction and her loved ones forgave her.   So it's not that things were downplayed (Tara left her, Buffy slapped her, Dawn told her to stay away and later, when she was healthy, they almost blamed her for that demon that was flaying people) it's that she was forgiven. And considering the efforts she made to get healthy, rightfully so imo.   (Am a former addict myself, heroin rather than magic though unfortunately, and saw what my family went through. Only by writing that have I noticed just how apt a potrayal of addiction it really was to be honest. Especially the Willow always having the magic inside her thing)"
buffy,3auerk,uscmissinglink,2,Tue Jun 23 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"Sort of flayed someone? Darth Rosenburg flat out skinned Warren! That was one of the coolest things I'd ever seen, even as I knew it meant that they were probably going to have to kill her off later!"
buffy,3auerk,AngryWizard,3,Wed Jun 24 05:24:30 2015 UTC,"WHY DO THEY ALWAYS FIGHT IN THE LEAST ATHLETIC CLOTHES EVER? I get that most of the time it's not predictable, but the series finale? They all knew what was going down and there was a serious lack of ponytails and braids and sports bras, and a disconcerting abundance of tight jeans."
buffy,3auerk,kwombat,2,Thu Jun 25 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, same with 'The Gift.' I mean, Buffy knew she was going to fight a hell god…and she wore heels."
buffy,3auerk,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Thu Jun 25 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Right? She often trains with Giles in athletic clothes, but come fight time, the hair comes down and the cute clothes make an appearance. ????"
buffy,3auerk,cassiope,2,Thu Jun 25 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"It has always bothered me that Buffy & Co. in season 6 were stated to be broke, but no one in that group ever wore a piece of clothing twice. Leather jackets, pointy-toed boots that match perfectly with well-tailored slacks and flowy blouses. I know it's ridiculous, and of course a show is going to dress their characters fashionably (except for Willow's absolutely atrocious outfit in This Year's Girl in Season 4), but it takes me out of the story sometimes. At least put Buffy in some old sneakers. Heels are not conducive to kicking ass."

Season 8 can get kinda weird and confusing because the writers went pretty wild with the idea of ""no more special effects budget limitations"" but season 9 and 10 are much more like the show and have garnered/are garnering a much more positive response. It's good to keep that in mind if season 8 is not really your thing."
buffy,3ax40d,yallcat,8,Thu Jun 25 10:22:50 2015 UTC,Forget everything you thought you knew about Buffy. OP had a thought!
buffy,3ax40d,friggengenius,3,Wed Jun 24 10:34:50 2015 UTC,Honestly I didn't really care about the baby slayers and I kind of thought that whole last season sucked. I wouldn't watch a spin off that didn't include Buffy or Giles or at least some original Scoobies.
buffy,3ax40d,barre_chord_reality,3,Wed Jun 24 06:32:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't really care much for the Potentials either, and honestly I don't think Buffy really cared for them either, but she also understood the importance of giving the powers of the Slayer to all the potentials and taking away the power from the Watchers Council.   There were so many things happening in season 7 that the message kind of got diluted a bit, but I think it's a really important one that many of us often forget about.   On point however... my idea for a workable spinoff would be to have Buffy as Watcher, but not in the horrible and manipulative way that the old Watchers acted. Buffy could lend a lot of experience as a Slayer to all the Slayers. I'm sure Willow and Xander could find something to do in this world as well.   Buffy & The Slayers?"

But I understand where you're coming from. And in no way did I mean it had to be about those girls that were there with buffy.

buffy,3ax40d,Mcmacladdie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:49:12 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely too big a job for one slayer now that you mention it. Seems like every region would need their own. I mean Buffy never left Sunnydale so just eff the rest of us huh? I bet we see something similar eventually.

Spike with a soul would beat Angel IMO (especially after the events of destiny).  Angel wins style? WHAT?  I'm a straight man, but Angel is better looking than Spike? I think Spike is by far more attractive than Angel. But, this one is more personal opinion so I can let that one fly.    Also, is this a competition? How so?"

buffy,3apksd,purplenat,7,Thu Jun 25 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"He really didn't, disappointingly. It's disappointing, because you'd expect a Council-appointed Watcher to be not completely incompetent and portraying him like he was in the show is kind of weak character writing. From the first time I saw him on-screen I got the sense there was more to this guy than what he initially showed us on the surface (kind of like Giles), but we never got to see anything like that. His biggest asset to Buffy and friends was his book knowledge.   The closest he came to showing his potential is either when he decides to take Faith to the Council or when he comes back to offer his help during graduation.   Sadly, in the first instance, his action goes against our audience sympathies and thus can't really be seen as a badass move (although it's in character of him making tough decisions he believes to be right). In the second instance, his help in fighting the Mayor isn't really helpful at all. Would it have hurt to have Wesley staking a few vamps during graduation? It would have redeemed him a little.   However, it must be said again: Wesley has the best character arc in the Buffyverse!"

buffy,3apksd,DaddyCatALSO,5,Tue Jun 23 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"If we're talking behind the scenes stuff, Willow asked him out pretty much day one. He said he didn't date coworkers, so she waited until he was on a different show, and then they got married.  So clearly something on the Buffy set was showing. Maybe not what they put on camera (which I was hoping to locate) but enough to make a woman sure."
buffy,3apksd,SavageGeeIced,2,Fri Jun 26 08:44:46 2015 UTC,I had no idea they were married! That's adorable. :)
buffy,3apksd,Pathwag,2,Wed Jul 8 05:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yep... Hannigan married Denisof in 2003, after several years of dating. These days they're raising their 2 daughters. (And are godparents to Whedon's son Arden.)"
buffy,3apksd,pober,3,Wed Jul 8 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I actually think (and this might just be me being generous to something I love, so excuse me for that), that the Wesley we saw to begin with was a product of the Watcher's Council being a namby-pamby bunch of bollocks who had a team to do their dirty work for them (the wetworks crew).   It was only after he got into the real world and effectively grew up that he started to show some grit. When you see the more of the council later, when Glory is kicking around, I feel like you could really see Wesley coming out of that lifestyle, especially without the benefit of Giles' pre-Slayer experience (having lived a life of rebellion and magical experimentation).   I actually think that the first hints of him becoming our Wesley were when he was attracted to Cordelia, spent ages being English about it, and then finally gaining enough confidence to go for it.  Yeah, so clearly I'm a huge embarrassing fangirl."
buffy,3apksd,pober,3,Tue Jun 23 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, watching him go from ""threatening/being disarmed by"" a slightly amused Angel in ""Parting Gifts"" to this dude towards the end.  I'd say some of his first awesome came when he was impersonating Angel, but he kind of Mr. Beaned his way through that, too. So I'm really not sure where it came from."
buffy,3apksd,pober,3,Tue Jun 23 13:13:29 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about Angel moments, I'd say that Wesley showed his first awesome moment when he tracks down a missing Angel in The Ring. He disarms someone by shooting a crossbow bolt through his hand."
buffy,3apksd,pober,2,Tue Jun 23 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"Refresh my memory, if you'd be so kind... was that before or after he started dating whasserface. You know. Neck kerchief later on. That girl.  I'm trying to be unspoilery, not snide. I remember her saying something like ""No matter how hard you try to wash it away, the darkness will only ever leave gray, never white again""... something like that."

buffy,3apksd,TheGreatHuman,2,Tue Jun 23 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"So if we go with defining Wesley's ""badass""-itude as doing the right thing, even when the world thinks its wrong, does Gwendolyn Post figure into it?  I don't recall if he was there, or what part he played in that fight. But I seem to think she was there to ""take over"" for Wesley and Giles."

The Chamberlain family had been vacationing at Uluru when their daughter was taken from their tent by a dingo. The authorities disbelieved the family's story about a dingo, and prosecuted and won convictions against Lindy Chamberlain for murder and against her then-husband Michael Chamberlain as an accessory after the fact.

Actually, it kind of sets up the season thematically, so I like it more in retrospect.   Glad you are ready for more Spike. Arguably the best Spike episode is in S5."

buffy,3ampqw,TheBarrowman,8,Fri Jun 26 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on Adam (posting from previous like-wise thread)   I don't really think Joss and the other writers went wrong with Adam in terms of making him scary, they went wrong on the fact they didn't develop the character and thus, nobody really cared about him. I really like the character of Adam. I thought he was interesting and articulate and had huge potential to be a really awesome Big Bad. However, all of the focus on season 4 went on the group dynamic and thus the big showdown and who Adam really was, went out the window in my opinion. I don't really think it's a case of ""Adam needed to kill more things to be scary"", I think it's more a case of Adam needed to be given more screen-time and explored as a character.   Still agree with that.    I liked the addition of Anya and Tara, although I think Tara still has a bit of work to do before I care about her.   Don't think that will be a problem :)    Riley on the other hand, I did not like and I don't think he we grow on me, hopefully he dies soon or rather leaves peacefully since he's not actually an unlikable guy.   Generally accepted opinion. Not mine, but you're certinally not alone.    The main strengths of season 4 were some of the singular episodes I thought. Episodes like ""Fear Itself"", ""Something Blue"" and the Faith two-parter were all great, not to mention ""Hush"" (possibly the best episode of the entire series?).    I would agree, but for me personally, what I love about season 4 is that it's different. The colours are different. Everything changed from dark purple/black to white/grey. It felt more expandable and more free, following the college experimental atmosphere. I like season 4 because it feels a bit like a summer break (in correlation with all the other seasons) and for me, it's a nice break for one season.   Good luck with season 5 and beyond and thanks for sharing :)"
buffy,3ampqw,coolbeaNs92,6,Sun Jun 21 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Besides individual awesome episodes (my ultimate favourite being the final episode, Restless. The cryptic foreshadowing clues, the humour, the cheese, the glimpse into the minds and motivations of the fantastic four, it's just an awesome episode) I've always found Season 4 to be the weakest (imo). The seasons are defined by their big bad for me, and Adam is nowhere near The Master, Drusilla and Spike or Faith and the Mayor.   People have already mentioned the missed opportunities with Adam. But I found the entire way the Initiative was handled, one big missed opportunity. It could have been so much more than it was. I also agree with you OP regarding Riley. I just could not like him. We're hardly alone though, as far as I know fans generally didn't like him or at least him and Buffy together. I've heard it theorised that it's because he's too normal, so the relationship lacks the epic drama of Buffy and Angel (apparently we're all super unhealthy and nice, normal guy isn't good enough compared to celibate vampire with a psychopath caged inside lol).   You have lots of awesomeness ahead of you too OP. Season 5 has my favourite big bad (if you don't count Drusilla, who I'm a major fanboy for lol). Won't be specific and spoil things for you, so I'll just say that they're awesome and scary in a new way."
buffy,3ampqw,Lyco_499,3,Mon Jun 22 01:18:19 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have to add is that Buffy vs Dracula is one of my favorite Buffy episodes. For me it fires on all cylinders and is a great start to season five. I'm jealous, I wish I could watch for the first time."

buffy,3ampqw,madcowbomber,3,Mon Jun 22 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"I'm with the rest of this sub in how the overall arc of Season 4 was the weakest of the series, but this season had some of the best episodes of the show. At least 9 episodes in this season are in my ""most rewatchable episodes"" category (well, 8 and a half technically. I mostly like ""The Freshman"" for Xander's ""What would Buffy do?"" speech). And yeah, I really think Adam could've been explored more. Hell, Maggie Walsh was a pretty good setup for an awesome villain IMO. Instead of killing her off, the writers could've made her the season villain and have Adam be the one who does her dirty work. Still, we got what we got.  Season 5 is probably my favorite season. Buffy vs Dracula the worst episode of Season 5 in my opinion, so hopefully that makes you feel better. Season 5 has an awesome arc that's my favorite in the series, and Spike starts character development that is one of the best character arcs in the series (it's my second favorite behind Willow's character arc throughout the series, but that's personal preference). Spike will get a lot more to do in Season 5, so don't worry about that. All in all, strap yourself in for what's probably the best season of the series. You won't regret it."
buffy,3ampqw,Kalse1229,3,Mon Jun 22 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Season 4 is my least favorite, mostly for all of the reasons you've said.  It has some great episodes, like Hush, the Faith episodes, and Wild at Heart, but also some of the worst, like Where the Wild Things Are and Pangs (some people love the episode, I found it meh). Riley was bland, Adam was lame, and the Initiative was just not a great addition to the story.   Anya and Tara are great but I feel like they really reach their best in the next few seasons.   Season 5 is my favorite, I hope you enjoy it!"
buffy,3ampqw,Gneissisnice,4,Mon Jun 22 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think Joss himself put it really well in the season overview from the dvd extras:   ""It was sort of a chaotic season. And a lot of people say it’s the season where we fell apart and they don’t like it. I actually think it’s the season where we did most of our best shows. But it did sort of have a weird incoherence. A lot of stuff didn’t come together in the big picture. Episode by episode the strength was pretty much unmatched. But as an arc, I understand why people are, like ’it didn’t get me there’."""

buffy,3ampqw,Marmadukian,2,Mon Jun 22 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Spike takes a while to find a purpose for being in the show, even the writers and Joss admit in some interviews and commentary about how they struggled to integrate him into the group (MAYBE SPOILERS: by season 7 it becomes more apparent why he is there and he actually become PART of the group, as opposed to some random stalky guy who shows up whenever and leaves whenever, also for a part of season 5 and the beginning of season 6, he is there for a definite reason.)  Also I forget the majority of the episodes in season 4 outside of the big ones like Hush, and the funny ones like something blue. But then again I also forget most of 3 and 5 as well, as I tend to rewatch season 2,6 and 7 more than the others, and I definitely watched through season 5 way too quickly to remember most of it.   I guess my point is, if you're a spike fan and want to see him actually get decent roles, hold out until the second half of season 5, as it has some of the better spike parts, and season 7 might as well be called the spike show."

buffy,3ampqw,fifosexapel,2,Fri Jun 26 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Season 4 is my least favorite, but at the same time it's still good. There are so many hilarious, and great rewatchable episodes that season. I rewatched it recently and found myself cracking up! I reward 5&6 a LOT and since I have all the DVD's I thought I'd rewatch season 4. I skip some of the initiative heavy episodes because I'm just not that into it. But it's still good."
buffy,3ampqw,rachiedoubt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that it wasn't Buffy at its best, but yeah, it wasn't bad either. For the most part, I think it lacked that emotional punch that most other seasons have-which is probably okay with some people, but it's one of the reasons Buffy is my favorite show. I think one of my favorite little funny moments of the whole series was from the episode ""Pangs,"" where Giles brightens up at the mention of mushy peas."
buffy,3ampqw,theoremofgoats,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"I think one of the drivers for S-4 was that the departure of Angel and Cordelia opened up more than two character niches : mysterious semi-out-of-the-group ally, love interest for Xander, love interest for Buffy, sarcastic but truthful humorous semi-member of the group. They kind of took Anya, Riley, Spike, Harmony, maybe Parker & Kathy and threw the characters at these holes to see which ones would stick."

SMG and Head really nailed it.  Xander asking Buffy out and then getting rejected by Willow are also great scenes.  The season was overall a mixed bag. It's a shame that the episodes that could have expanded the portraits of Xander (Teacher's Pet), Willow (I Robot ... you Jane) and Cordelia (Out of Mind Out of Sight) were pretty weak with only Angel getting a solid episode (Angel)  Compared to the next seasons Season 1 has darker cinematography, the music is more electronic, Willow's hair is longer and not very red and Buffy's skirts are shorter."
buffy,3alswe,IraninaGenius,7,Sun Jun 21 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"While this episode has nothing on the other finales of the series, it really is the stand-out in S1. A lot of the scenes here can be characterised by their poignancy, something that is lacking in the earlier episodes."
buffy,3alswe,pober,5,Sun Jun 21 18:40:33 2015 UTC,"The music being more electronic in Season 1 is interesting...  It was done by Walter Murphy who worked on Hunter and Wiseguy in late '80s-early '90s.  (Sounds about right!)  Christophe Beck started with half the eps in S2, including the poignant ""Close your eyes"" theme, then all of S3 and S4.  I agree S1 was a mixed bag of quality, but I still loved the season as a whole (and always enjoy revisiting it), as we got to know these characters and the strange world that Joss created.  I never fell for any other show about teenage characters in the same way.  The shorter skirts were a costume designer's choice which I will defend till my dying breath.  :)"

But what I don't get is why vamps decided to kill just the people in that room. If they're in the school, wouldn't they kill everyone in the building?  7 after the anointed one leads Buffy to the hellmouth, were does he go. He just seems to wonder away.  8 Buffy recognizing the anointed one defies the codex. Hinting that the entire prophecy is subject to change. 9 What would have happened if The Master had won? Wouldn't Vamps like Spike, or any demon in general disagree with one vampire ruling all? 10 I think the fight with the Master was underwhelming. A season worth of build-up for a 1 minute battle that ends so simply."

buffy,3alswe,pober,4,Sun Jun 21 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"1) I think this is more of a happy coincidence. Plus Willows never looked at Buffy as more than a friend even post season 4.   10) eh with the fight choreography of season one, short and sweet is good for me."
buffy,3alswe,The_Ripper42,3,Mon Jun 22 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"1) there's occasional jokes about Buffy and Will not seeing each other that way. 2) it's the quickness that gets me. With everything we learn of the Master throught the season, and Ats, Buffy's ability to dust him that fast is only explained by Him  biting Buffy."
buffy,3alswe,buffanater,3,Mon Jun 22 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"I always assumed nobody else except the AV guys (3 male, 2 feme) and Giles were in the building then.  Firefly has deleted scenes, so does Dollhouse. BtVS & Angel need to get with it."
buffy,3alswe,DaddyCatALSO,8,Mon Jun 22 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"I shared this in another thread, but I watch the first two seasons in Japanese sometimes to study, and there are some funny differences. I've thought about making posts about the differences at some point.  When Buffy is revived and goes to fight The Master on the roof, instead of ""You have fruit punch mouth"", she says something like 歯は丈夫みたい which is like ""your teeth look healthy""  I guess they didn't think Japanese people would know what ""fruit punch mouth"" is, or couldn't figure out a way to translate it"

This fantastic finale kicked off an amazing string of iconic Whedon episodes which anchor the series and develop Buffy's character in significant ways.  The strong return for its sophomore season in When She Was Bad; a major advance in Buffy's maturity and her relationships with Angel & Giles in the underrated Lie To Me; aftermath of a doubly life-changing moment in Innocence; Angel's horrible past and everyone's catastrophic present in Becoming; finding the right path after solitary journeys to hell and back in Anne and Amends; awesome hilarity in Doppelgangland; massive conclusion to the high school era in Graduation Day; and in the show's later years, five extraordinary experimental episodes like nothing else on TV -- Hush, Who Are You, Restless, The Body, and Once More With Feeling.  That is an amazing achievement."

buffy,3ami0k,bwburke94,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:16:02 2015 UTC,To be clear: just the actor is the same though -- different character.
buffy,3ak7eu,BlueSoup10,50,Sun Jun 21 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe they intended that. It absolutely sets up Jonathan's motivation for performing the spell in Superstar, and for his role in season 6 (which I won't go into in case you or anyone else hasn't gotten there yet). Buffy, along with everyone else, ignores him one more time when it matters most, leading him further into feelings of worthlessness. And also I think it reinforces the message of the episode, which Buffy herself lays out in that speech. She can't hear Jonathan's pain because she has to listen to her own, and help save the rest of the school. Buffy is the Slayer and she helps people, but she's not perfect, and the show really explores that. She has to be strong--""strong is fighting. It's hard and it's painful and it's every day""--and she expects that of others, too. I think in her eyes Jonathan's situation is tragic but it's not her responsibility. She has to save the rest of the school, because they can't save themselves. Jonathan can."
buffy,3ak7eu,strawberryf1elds,19,Sun Jun 21 00:38:01 2015 UTC,"That's an incredible point actually, perhaps I did indeed misinterpret. Perhaps, then, it's less of a problem I have with the writing and more for the fact that he is indeed simply forgotten about by the characters that I have a problem with morally, having been in situations where I feel useless like Jonathan too and knowing how much it hurts. It would definitely make sense that he'd still feel this way all the way to the very end, where he finally finds people that care about him and are similar to him in Andrew and Warren. But even then, of course, he's betrayed... such a tragic character Jonathan is, now I think about it. That's almost an Angel-esque tragic character plot line, especially considering Andrew receives no punishment for his betrayal and the fact that he's forgotten about even after his death."
buffy,3ak7eu,The_Ripper42,9,Sun Jun 21 00:43:54 2015 UTC,"As awful as it is, I think it makes it more realistic. I feel the same way about Xander's shitty home life. I would have loved some type of resolution where his friends help him stand up to his parents or something but it's just not something that happens most of the time."
buffy,3ak7eu,3lvy,0,Sun Jun 21 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"Andrew was pushed by the first, so they can't really kill him or blame him for it, the same way buffy couldn't blame spike when the first brainwashed him (gonna stop here, for the ones that havent come that far yet..)"
buffy,3ak7eu,ModerateBias,2,Sun Jun 21 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's a big difference between being pushed to do something and being completely brainwashed. But yeah Andrew's betrayal clearly wasn't completely of his own choice, I  agree."
buffy,3ak7eu,3lvy,3,Sun Jun 21 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"well but he was decieved.   he was convinced by ""warren"" that it would bring immortality, for Jonathon as well as himself.  Andrew is not free of blame, on some level he knew better, and the episode storyteller explores that, finally forcing him to admit it was HIS decision and his evil act, that the victim card only went so far."
buffy,3ak7eu,longarmofmylaw,0,Sun Jun 21 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"The first dressed up as his dead, sadistic, murder of a friend and haunted him. I would call that brainwashing, not just being pushed."
buffy,3ak7eu,LarsP,2,Sun Jun 21 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"That's a really great interpretation, but I don't know if I have enough faith to believe that they'd intended any of this."
buffy,3ak7eu,redandblack555,19,Sun Jun 21 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"Jonathan is kinda abused as a plot device there. It's OK because it sets up perhaps the best scene in all of Buffy, but it really stretches credibility that he would kill himself with a rifle in the clock tower just as we're looking for a mass murderer.  In the immediate moment, Buffy still has a would be murderer to catch, and Jonathan is no danger, so she needs to rush off and fix it.  As for how he is mostly ignored later - though Giles does have some thought for him - I defer to /u/strawberryf1elds brilliant analysis. I honestly hadn't thought of how they show that Buffy is no better than the rest of us. Because we can't be."
buffy,3ak7eu,snailshoe,14,Sun Jun 21 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Also, did he really need a full fledged rifle and scope to kill himself?"
buffy,3ak7eu,MasterVersik,6,Sun Jun 21 03:51:28 2015 UTC,Maybe he just grabbed dad's rifle.

buffy,3ak7eu,catdoctor,11,Sun Jun 21 09:38:55 2015 UTC,"BTVS does a great job dealing with some difficult subjects, but does a shit job when it comes to the topic of suicide.   There is an episode in Season 7 when one of the potentials commits suicide. Instead of offering sympathy, Buffy literally calls the girl weK and berates the potentials for not being good enough. No time is devoted to the characters actually dealing with the fallout of suicide.   In both episodes, suicide is merely an afterthought plot device. It's unfortunate and could have been handled with much more nuance."
buffy,3ak7eu,pagethree,16,Sun Jun 21 03:58:24 2015 UTC,"Buffy had to deal with a much bigger problem than the suicide, and that is the despair that led to the suicide. She knew all the potentials were starting to feel hopeless. If she had been gentle and understanding she might have reinforced the feeling of hopelessness, which could have led to more suicides. She had to get the potentials' heads out of that space ASAP. Also, Buffy was feeling pretty desperate herself at that stage. Maybe she was angry at Cloe for being done. Chloe would not have to face the uncertainty and responsibility that Buffy still had ahead of her. She took the ""easy"" way out, making Buffy's life even harder. Besides, Buffy didn't have the time or the energy to worry about the potentials' feeling because she had to save the world -- again. I think Buffy's reaction was absolutely consistent with her character and the stress under which she was operating at that moment."
buffy,3ak7eu,catdoctor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:04:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it is inconsistent for Buffy's character, but overall disappointing for the writers not to offer multiple perspectives on the topic.   Suicide is a a very tragic and very real problem. If you look into research about the causes of suicide, how people should respond to suicide, and the after affects that suicide can have on other people (both in the community that it happens in and if it is publicized), that is absolutely not the way it should be handled.   Suicide is not the ""easy"" way out. People who succumb to suicide have generally fought a long and hard battle with depression, and for whatever reason can not keep fighting. Suicides also often happen in clusters - if one person kills them self, people around them are more likely to. There's a reason that the media (generally, and if it's a respectable group) deals with real life suicide in a very specific way.   Being gentle and understanding does not increase the risk of copy suicides. Ignoring the underlying issues and making some broad statement about weakness might. If you're already struggling, hearing someone say that you might be weak is not helpful.   Specifically in the case of the show, the characters are literally living on a hell mouth. Any depressive or suicidal feelings are most likely exacerbated. Not to mention the fact that the first knows exactly what to say to someone to get a strong reaction. If you are already a depressed, scared teenager, and the hell mouth + the first gets thrown in.... It's unimaginable.    We don't even get to know much about Chloe's life, because the writers don't think that matters. It does matter. Suicide is not just something that happens to a girl that you vaguely know. At least the writers should have let the other potentials speak on her life.   I just think suicide is such an important issue for people, and especially teenagers (target audience of the show), to understand and address. I think the show falls flat."
buffy,3ak7eu,3lvy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"All good points. I did not mean to suggest that I believe, or that anyone should believe, that suicide is a good or easy option. I was trying to put myself in Buffy's shoes to try to understand her feelings and motivations. She has died and gone to some kind of afterlife before, and in that place (in her own words) she was happy. She was done. (BTW, I don't believe in an afterlife. I am simply looking at Buffy within the context of the reality in which she lives.) By contrast, what she and the potentials are facing right now is a horde of Ubervamps, a battle to the death, and possibly a world onto which is about to be unleashed all the fury of Evil itself. Literally: Hell, as you put it. Even if Buffy wins the battle against The First, this battle will be hard and painful and bloody and many of the potentials, possibly all of them, plus any/all of the people Buffy cares about, will die. So even if she wins against he First, she is going to lose and she is going to be in pain. Given all of this, dying and going to that peaceful afterlife may look to Buffy like the easy way out of the situation she is in at the moment. She steels herself against her own despair, she rejects that idea of an ""easy"" way out and keeps on keeping on. This takes all of her strength and will. There is nothing left for her to give the potential Slayers. And this is an important plot point, becasue we have to see that Buffy herself is near despair. That she is hanging on by a thread. If the superhero who always manages to save the world is one breath away from giving up the fight, then the situation truly is dire. This is not just any apocalypse, this is The Apocalypse from the point of view of everyone around Buffy, even those who have survived Glory and The Master and Dark Willow at Buffy's side. They, too, are close to despair. Without this mind frame, the events of Empty Places just do not make sense. The Scoobies have watched Buffy save the world time and time again. Why on Earth would they depose her of her leadership role and kick her out of her own house? Because they are so desperate and so frayed that they are not thinking straight. becasue they see that she is turning into someone they don't recognize and becasue they see her nearness to desperation. The way Buffy reacts to Chloe's suicide is absolutely essential to setting up Buffy's banishment. Now, out of universe, you may argue that suicide is a topic that should have been addressed with more delicacy. Sure, if you want BTVS to turn into an After School Special. Personally, I look to Buffy for interesting human drama. I do not watch it to learn about suicide prevention hotlines, or to get a comforting message that no matter how much things suck there is always someone who loves you, and light at the end of the tunnel. Any of that stuff would have have relieved the oppression the characters are feeling and lessened the dramatic impact of the season story arc. It also would have slowed down the progression of the story. TL;DR: In my opinion, Buffy's outwardly cold response to Chloe's suicide was completely in character and essential to the story. Further I think that adding in any educational or comforting material about suicide would have dragged down the overall story line and actually lessened the emotional impact of the suicide on the other characters and the audience."
buffy,3ak7eu,rtupelo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"I think that just showed how bad of a situation they were in. The town was a mess, Buffy needs an army to SAVE THE WORLD and then the 'army' starts offing itself off? What would you have Buffy do? Hug them, tell them she's in a better place, and do things that she really doesn't have the time for? Cause if you didn't notice the whole town fled and monsters were taking over and shit, she couldn't really hit pause just because someone decided to take their own life. It would be selfish and unfair of Buffy to not keep on pushing, and try to keep them away from thoughts of suicide with the only real reason she has; to save the world. Chloe could have helped them saved the world but she decided to hang herself. Instead of facing of with all of her 'sisters in arms', she decided that she had had enough. Buffy can't mourne every person she loses either, cause she's lost a lot."
buffy,3ak7eu,monkeymosh88,3,Sun Jun 21 15:28:43 2015 UTC,What is your take on how they dealt with Angel trying to kill himself in Amends?
buffy,3ak7eu,JangoF76,5,Sun Jun 21 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person you replied to but I think they dealt with the topic better there. Even through all of Buffy's pleading it's important to note Angel still didn't change his mind and was still ready to kill himself, but obviously his attempt was thwarted by (I assume) Jasmine. It explores well how sometimes no matter how passionate and sad your speeches and feelings are for someone feeling suicidal, sometimes you just can't convince them yourself, and that it's ultimately up to them to try and find hope in something. Not every suicidal person's story goes like Jonathan's. I'm glad they've portrayed that."
buffy,3ak7eu,ratjea,6,Sun Jun 21 13:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well, one reason we brush past Jonathan's revelation quite quickly is that the big takeaway is that there is someone else out there trying to kill all the students and they don't know who it is. Jonathan and his feelings weren't really the focus of the episode, it was a just a bit of misdirection that Buffy likes to pull on us quite often."
buffy,3ak7eu,njinerd,5,Sun Jun 21 07:56:30 2015 UTC,The only thing about this scene that bugged me is that Jonathan was going to kill himself with a high power rifle. In a clock tower. It was stretching believability just to make us think he was actually going to do a mass shooting. There are much easier ways to kill yourself.
buffy,3ak7eu,Gneissisnice,3,Sun Jun 21 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"I've always thought the Jonathan suicide story was terrible, too, though I hadn't connected the dots about how it went straight to a comedic scene after. What always stuck in my craw was the mass-murder rifle. It would be really unusual for a suicidal person to go into a clock tower with a gun like that. He wouldn't even be able to kill himself with it directly! He'd have to rig up a way to deploy the trigger mechanically.  Jonathan's speech rang much more true than Buffy's did, but I think Buffy's speech was intended to showcase her self-centeredness. Which is an interesting trait they explore throughout the rest of the series, because, well, she has good reason to be self-centered and in many ways it's a necessary quality for her to develop given her situation. But it also makes her sometimes pompous, sanctimonious, and overly brusque to the problems other people face."
buffy,3ak7eu,jayjaythejetplane18,2,Sun Jun 21 13:43:42 2015 UTC,Agree completely.  Next unpopular opinion thread I'm going with 'I hate Buffy's speech in Earshot.'
buffy,3ak7eu,DaddyCatALSO,3,Tue Jun 23 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"Remember, Buffy was trying to prevent a mass murder. It may have been a bit insensitive to leave Jonathan at that exact moment, but as soon as she realized that he wasn't the killer, she had to try to find the real killer. Lives were at stake."
buffy,3ak7eu,3lvy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:55:16 2015 UTC,"Very true. But the fact that the scene where the true potential killer is revealed is basically comedic kind of irks me as it makes me feel as if the show is saying that all the stuff with Jonathan actually didn't matter at all after it was revealed he wasn't planning on killing everyone, and it's quickly moved on from and never mentioned again. The dinner lady of course posed more of a threat to more people but I don't like how it seems to be suggested that everything with Buffy and Jonathan was completely pointless because of the fact he wasn't the potential killer, rather than it just being a misunderstanding leaving the problem still needing to be solved.  Plus, c'mon, Xander just happening to stumble into the school kitchens to eat jello just as the lunch lady pours rat poison into the food is kind of lazy writing."
buffy,3ak7eu,spideroggie,2,Sun Jun 21 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"This actually reminds me of the episode in S3 ""Beauty and the Beasts,"" where it's revealed that Debbie is in an abusive relationship with Pete. While Buffy and Willow initially try to help her, when Debbie breaks down, Willow makes a joke about how ""I think we broke her."" Extremely insensitive to people are actually in an abusive relationship. Debbie later dies at the hands of Pete if I'm remembering correctly, and literally no attention is paid to it other than Buffy apologizing to Scott for the loss of his friends. Still my favorite show of all time, but it could be insensitive to serious topics at times."
buffy,3ak7eu,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:14:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't ehar ajoke in willow's comment, I saw a serious evaluation of how far down Debbie was by then. We all hear stuff differently, I like to call it ""viewer's rights."""
buffy,3ak7eu,The_Iron_Zeppelin,0,Mon Jun 22 16:36:08 2015 UTC,"She's dead. Buffy deals with death all the time. She knows that when they're gone, they're gone, and what's left are the ones that cared. I think that's why they focused more on the person that was still alive than the ones Buffy can't really help anymore."
buffy,3ak7eu,360Saturn,2,Sun Jun 21 15:32:16 2015 UTC,In only addressing the concerns about the insensitivity of later teasing Jonathan in the episode I think you have to go back in time to when the episode aired. I remember it very well as it was set to air one week after Columbine. The sensitivity around bullying did not yet exist and the fact that they even touched on it at all was novel for the time. They might not have done it as perfectly as we'd like but for the time it was groundbreaking. Side note: season 3 finale had some delays to do Columbine and general school violence as well if I remember correctly.
buffy,3ak7eu,LarsP,2,Sun Jun 21 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"(No, you're not over-thinking.) Most of the points have already been addressed, but I'll try to capsulize my own take. 1- the main plot point was Buffy's telepathy disease and the attempt to find the murderer. Once Jonathan's ""herringness"" was found to be red, Buffy had to resume the search. And the juxtaposition of harsh and comic has always been a major part of this show's style.  2- Buffy, as can be seen in boldface in much of S-4 and S-7,  might be the hero but she's a deeply flawed person, especially when it comes to interpersonal relations. Her dismissive later comments are fully in character.  2b- The simple fact is that a lot of women won't have anything to do with a shorter man. And recall that Buffy, whoever she's become now, was raised to be a dependent airhead looking for a man who both stronger and richer to take care of her. One reason (among many others) why her own love life has never worked out."
buffy,3ak7eu,DaddyCatALSO,2,Mon Jun 22 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think the scene after is in slightly poor taste, but actually isn't irrelevant.  Buffy was hearing thoughts about someone about to kill students.  She find Jonathan in the tower but when its revealed that he was only going to kill himself, the conflict then jumps to the lunch lady who actually was about to poison people.  So technically it was necessary to resolve the plot, but perhaps not the best way to follow a scene about suicide."
buffy,3ak7eu,IraninaGenius,4,Fri Jul 3 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"I actually hated Buffy's whole speech to Jonathan. Delivered by a pretty, popular-enough, middle-class white girl to someone who's not only a social outsider, but in enough of a bad place that he's planning on violently killing himself, it really struck a bad chord with me.  The advice that she gives him basically is very person-specific - to her, not to him or anyone like him. It was actually a moment when I started to go off Buffy as a character. Yes, she may be a social outsider (ish), but she's actively chosen to hang out with the Scoobies; she acts like Jonathan has chosen to be isolated and friendless. I was expecting her to extend the hand of friendship to him and for him to become at least a semi-regular part of the gang, but she basically just gives him a telling-off and then acts like the job's done and everything is okay now. Really left a sour taste in my mouth, for me it was Buffy not practicing what she preached."
buffy,3ak7eu,360Saturn,3,Sun Jun 21 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"Like Buffy said, her life life happens to, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than she can handle.  2 years later she does take her own life.  Granted, she was a very pretty white corpse.   The advice that she gives him basically is very person-specific   The advice - or more insight - was to stop worrying what people think about you. Because, in truth, they very likely don' think much about you at all.  Also, all these people you may think are so together and happy have their own problems and torments. Your pain is probably not as unique as it seems.  To me, that is rock solid universal life advice, and I think back on it quite often. Though it may apply the most to a certain kind of self pitying loner."
buffy,3ak7eu,ratjea,2,Sun Jun 21 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that Buffy was largely talking to herself, but she still was saying things Jonathan needed to consider, so it was appropriate and good in that sense. And let's face it, Jonathan's race and probably economic status aren't different from Buffy's, so it's not truly a disproportional transaction in those ways."
buffy,3ak7eu,IraninaGenius,4,Mon Jun 22 16:40:48 2015 UTC,What Buffy's race has to do with anything? I am so tired of this fashion of bringing race in everything in an effort to seem more deep and socially conscious.
buffy,3ak7eu,3lvy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:31:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually mean it in the sense of race, I suppose. More in the sense of ""whitegirl"" as a descriptor for a particular kind of person. Like 'valley girl'. Now I think about it, though, I haven't heard that term used as a descriptor in a while, and I suppose that description might actually comes from a place of prejudice, originally? So perhaps it wasn't a great description of Buffy in this instance.  She is a white girl, and she is middle class, and I think I meant it in the sense of somebody who doesn't have a lot of extra things to worry about in her life, aside from the obvious things related to her 'job' and her day-to-day school life. But no, her race/skin colour does not put her directly above Jonathan in any social hierarchy. I didn't mean to suggest that it would.  In this case, I just felt that Buffy was to Jonathan the way that Cordelia was to Buffy in season 1. Giving advice that made Buffy feel like she'd done a good deed, but which would probably actually not benefit him in the long run (which is possibly correct, given that Jonathan's arc later goes to villain and eventually victim)."
buffy,3ahm8q,AtlJayhawk,51,Sat Jun 20 06:48:12 2015 UTC,Miss Kitty Fantastico is her real name. And it's implied in Season 7 that Dawn accidently killed her with a crossbow.
buffy,3ahm8q,pober,39,Sat Jun 20 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"Technically it's just implied that the kitten set off the crossbow when it was left lying around loaded.

buffy,3abyfx,hopesdead,43,Thu Jun 18 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"The First wasn't introduced as a brand new Big Bad in season 7. IIRC, Buffy even mentions its appearance in Amends during S7: how it tried to get Angel to commit suicide by sunrise.  Edit: clarification"
buffy,3abyfx,DigitalBathRx,6,Thu Jun 18 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"I guess my big problem is The First isn't treated as a very powerful monster. The writers played down The First to fit the story. When The First is brought into season 7, it is a more looming presence that means much more."
buffy,3abyfx,DigitalBathRx,30,Thu Jun 18 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a reason for that. Supposedly. The First didn't have much power in Amends. By the time season 7 rolled around, the First gained power to offset the imbalance caused by there being too much ""good."" Only one Slayer is supposed to exist at a time, but Buffy died and another was called. Ergo, Faith now holds the Slayer line and evil must manifest in order to return balance to the world.  Edit again: See, even I got it wrong :) as the others said, it was the spell performed by the Scoobies to reverse Buffy's death was the catalyst."
buffy,3abyfx,TheKingleMingle,5,Thu Jun 18 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"I always liked the idea that even in Season 7 the first was never that tough.

Bringing Buffy back from the dead does something to the Slayer line and and the balance of Good and Evil that allows the First to take more overt action.

buffy,3abyfx,venom8599,8,Thu Jun 18 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. The first was pretty much just posturing before season 6, all bluster but not much real power, until the scoobies used magic to bring Buffy back (as explained by said big creepy eyeball)."
buffy,3abyfx,sebron,2,Thu Jun 18 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the events going on at the same time in Angel are much more of a violation of the balance of good and evil and to me make more sense than the spell that resurrected Buffy being the cause.

buffy,3abyfx,sebron,2,Fri Jun 19 10:17:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think that really fits with the dialogue.    Giles: It's not because she died, the Beljoxa's Eye was quite clear about that. It's because she lives. Again. Buffy's not responsible for that.

buffy,3a3psn,cheatatjoes,14,Wed Jun 17 06:45:26 2015 UTC,"Xander's wall punch was...  even better.  Anya's speech was what we all think, but no one says.  Xander's wall punch was what we all feel, but no one does.  I guess i like the punch better because i could relate to it more personally."
buffy,3a3psn,ModerateBias,3,Wed Jun 17 09:55:17 2015 UTC,I loved Anya's speech - she's trying so hard to understand the un-understandable. It tears me to pieces.
buffy,3a3psn,eadon_rayne,12,Fri Jun 19 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"The best part about it is I think most people can relate to at least one of the characters' reactions. The very first time I'd seen it was before I had ever really experienced the full weight of grief, so the Scoobies were more what I could relate to. Sad, mad, confused. Trying to be supportive but not understanding what you're expected to do.  The first time I watched it after my mom passed away (suddenly, from a cerebral hemorrhage), I could relate more closely with Buffy, and I think it had to be hard to capture that feeling. In that moment the grief is just so overwhelming that part of you just shuts down and the only things you really manage to do are essentially like being on autopilot. But I could also relate to Dawn's immediate reaction to being told, because that's exactly what it felt like, inside. It's really excellently done portrait, or monument to the actual feelings of grief."

I was seeing this girl who was a huge fan and I said I'd never seen the show before (I'm currently about halfway through season 7). It took her pointing out the fact that there was no music about halfway though the episode before I noticed. And /u/madcowbomber said it just right: Emma Caulfield nailed that scene.
buffy,3a4b11,BMW1M,7,Wed Jun 17 03:03:51 2015 UTC,I will just say you need to read the canon Buffy comics.
buffy,3a4b11,Beloit,4,Wed Jun 17 08:27:54 2015 UTC,Sunny from season four episode one is supposed to be a slayer turned vampire if that helps
buffy,3a4b11,unicorns69ng,5,Thu Jun 18 04:40:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, that was originally the plan, but it was cut. Would've been cool if they'd stuck with it, though. It would've explained why Sunday seemed extra strong."
buffy,3a4b11,clockworklycanthrope,2,Thu Jun 18 07:05:53 2015 UTC,To be honest a little part of me wanted Buffy to drink from Dracula's wrist just to see what would happen if she turned. Wouldn't it be interesting to see the hero turn into a bad guy with enhanced senses? Then the whole gang would have to figure out a way to turn her back!
buffy,3a4b11,PlausiblePeter,6,Wed Jun 17 08:39:46 2015 UTC,Buffy did actually drink from Dracula's wrist (but nothing happened because she was not near death).
buffy,3a4b11,Beloit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:53:09 2015 UTC,Oh that's right! I haven't seen the show in a while but does Dracula have to drink her blood too to complete the sire?
buffy,3a4b11,PlausiblePeter,3,Wed Jun 17 08:55:39 2015 UTC,"Basically, for Buffy to have to turn into a vampire, Dracula would have to drink her blood first until she was nearly dead. Then, at death's door, she would have to drink Dracula's blood. That would turn her.  What happened in the episode (""Buffy vs. Dracula"") was: Dracula drank her blood first when he came into her bedroom at night. Buffy was fine afterwards. Then some time later Dracula let Buffy drink his blood. Buffy was hesitant to do so because she was afraid it would turn her into a vampire. But Dracula explains that it won't, because she would have to be near death to turn.   BUFFY: (looks conflicted) If I drink that-  DRACULA: I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us."

buffy,3a4b11,clockworklycanthrope,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that you'd make the connection to Sunday. The initial plan was for her to be a Slayer that got vamped (which would've explained why she seemed extra strong), but they ultimately removed that idea from the final script.  I'll also echo /u/Beloit's advice about reading the comics. They hold the answers you seek."
buffy,3a1u40,knitknitterknit,12,Tue Jun 16 15:57:35 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think Joyce and Giles were really cute together?  I know it would have distracted from the show and Buffy, especially after Joyce passed away, but I still think they had chemistry."
buffy,3a1u40,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Tue Jun 16 19:31:11 2015 UTC,"One big problem is that, ultimately, a parent and Watcher have different goals for a daughter/Slayer. Other than that, neat. Lots of fic writers have had permanent giles/joyce pairings; even I did in my own non-supernatural fic.

buffy,3a07sd,beccamil95,12,Tue Jun 16 05:11:46 2015 UTC,"I think the part you're talking about is from the episode ""Sanctuary"", from S1 of Angel.  Angel and Buffy were meant to be watched concurrently starting with Buffy season 4, but you won't miss too much if you don't (I started Angel after finishing Buffy).  Sanctuary is a very good episode, especially if you're interested in Faith's story - I haven't seen it in awhile but you could probably watch it without too much in the way of Angel spoilers."
buffy,3a07sd,skeezycheeses,3,Tue Jun 16 05:44:22 2015 UTC,"If you do watch Sanctuary, watch the episode ""Five by Five"" of Angel first. It's a two-part story.  I highly recommend it. Sanctuary is one of my favorite episodes from either Angel or Buffy, and Eliza Dushku gives an outstanding performance."
buffy,3a07sd,3raserE,3,Tue Jun 16 13:23:59 2015 UTC,"You're going to need to be more specific  Could also have been a scene from Angel? During season 4 (and possibly 5) a few Angel scenes appeared in the ""previously"" but I think it was also stated they were from that show not buffy."
buffy,39z18q,carbonbasedmistake,14,Mon Jun 15 23:05:44 2015 UTC,Heh the title. But to be honest the zipper sound always sort of bugged me. It sounds so loud and obviously added in the editing process. Sigh.
buffy,39z18q,fredsaunders,22,Mon Jun 15 23:21:24 2015 UTC,"Troof, but they needed to convey what was happening. They needed to be really clear without being able to show very much. Without that sound, we'd probably still be arguing over whether or not they'd actually done it in that scene. So, yeah, I'm sure it was added in post at the last minute, but it's effective."

buffy,3a0cov,artistamoreno,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:07:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if it's going to be the original aspect ratio or those awful Pivot 'remasters' in widescreen from last year.

buffy,3a0cov,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I own the DVDs and it's on Netflix, so it doesn't make much difference to me personally. I would like anyone seeing it for the first time to see it in its OAR, though. Unfortunately, Buffy was shot on a very small budget and the film stock was not the highest quality, so it really suffers visually compared to modern shows. I was really hoping the Pivot remasters would have been done with some care - cleaning up the muddy shadows, improving the color balance and re-scanning the film for a sharper image - but it really seems that they just zoomed in on the DVDs to 'make them widescreen' and threw in, for no reason whatsoever, some crappy CGI over a couple of the original effects. With Whedon's fame about as high right now as it's likely to ever get, there is no time we are more likely to get a true Buffy remaster than now, but those Pivot ""remasters"" really made me think it's just never ever going to happen."

buffy,3a0cov,coolbeaNs92,2,Tue Jun 16 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"They had to redo a lot of effects because to save money they were done on video instead of film, and were thus stuck at SD. Unfortunately they did a shit job cropping and zooming, and they outright ignored applying most of the filters the show used to make scenes darker (e.g. to make them look like night). It's like they didn't give a shit at all."

I also didn't realize how technical fans were on showcasing the re-runs. I hope ABC keeps it in SD format and displays every episode in the best quality. I remember missing half the shows because I was going to college the last 4 yrs of BTVS and borrowed dubbed vhs copies from a friend to watch them later. I was really sad to see the show go and was wishing a pick-up after 12 years where we find Buffy by miracle had Angel's love child and is a working mother/ teacher at another high school; she becomes a watcher. Wouldn't that be awesome? Tell Joss Whedon I have treatment for a new show. Anyways, love how you called my title ""Massive click-bate"""

The final issue of the season was amazing though.  Season 9 started out okay, but got really weird.  Certain things were introduced in Season 8 that got quickly swept away like they changed their minds, and this was even more prominent in Season 9.  You'll see some real game-changing ideas waved away in the weirdest ways imaginable.  Season 10 is fan service, pure and simple.  It's so much fun to read and  spoiler.  If I have one complaint, it's that it's pretty much ALL fan service.  It's taken forever to find the story and introduce the possible big bad."

What I DO recommend it that you read Angel & Faith (Not Season 10, the previous one).

buffy,39v7r7,a_birthday_cake,22,Mon Jun 15 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"This is not my own observation, I read it on TV Tropes, and thus I cannot say for certain but in the flashback before Angelus turns her, she's speaking with a more normal sounding British accent. She adopts the over-the-top one when she goes crazypants."
buffy,39v7r7,ProfessionalSmeghead,3,Mon Jun 15 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Yes she is. Which either means Dru's accent changes after going crazy, or because flashbacks to the 1800s were filmed for Ats so Juliet Landau had more time to hone her accent."
buffy,39v7r7,buffanater,18,Mon Jun 15 13:50:59 2015 UTC,I always thought she talked like that because Drusilla is bat-shit crazy.  But Juliet Landau has said that she based the accent on a British friend that she had. Maybe she spiced up the accent a little bit to match the character.
buffy,39v7r7,just_lurking12,7,Mon Jun 15 03:37:07 2015 UTC,"Her being as mad as a bag of hammers is definitely part of it but honestly I've heard some cockney people who aren't too far off Dru's accent. Also consider that may be an accent she's kept for 150 years, it's possible that some people just sounded like that then. Spike and Angel changed how they spoke but Drusilla might have just decided not to."
buffy,39v7r7,TheDeadManWalks,6,Mon Jun 15 06:58:21 2015 UTC,"I never really had a problem with Drusilla's accent. Like others, I just assumed that it was a sign of her insanity."

buffy,39v7r7,DeePrincess,3,Mon Jun 15 23:38:25 2015 UTC,"Dru was from London, not sure what part. It's odd, more people in position to know like Spike's but don't like Dru's, some dislike both, and some (including fan writer Keith topping,) think both are great."
buffy,39v7r7,DaddyCatALSO,3,Mon Jun 15 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a case of an American doing a bad English accent. I'm not criticising - very few Americans can do it convincingly. Alexis Denisof is the only one I can think of. I'm English, and I didn't even know he was American until I saw him in an interview using his real accent.  Unfortunately, all the others in Buffy/Angel aren't very good. James Marsters wasn't great either, but he did improve later on. A bit.  I love Druscilla, and Juliet Landau is a great actress. But every time she says ""Spoike"" it's like nails on a chalkboard to me."
buffy,39v7r7,JangoF76,5,Mon Jun 15 10:26:31 2015 UTC,"Her accent is based on a Victorian or even pre-Victorian era cockney accent, so by today's standards it sounds overblown, but it's reasonably accurate."
buffy,39v7r7,nowonmai,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe Dru tries to sound like Spike? I mean she loves him and has spent god knows how many years with him. When kids are little they speak like thier parents, like when they hear new words or quote thier frazes. Or maybe that was her original accent (only normal and better) but as her mind went that did too, it got over exaggerated when her mind went wonky."

Some of the fan videos are just plain hilarious and then there are the ones like this, that leave you in tears. I think Joss Whedon brought a whole new genre to TV, the tragicomedy. It's much more common now, but before Buffy, TV shows fell squarely into ""Comedy"" or ""Drama"" with the occasional exception of ""very special episodes"" where funny shows got serious, and ""MASH,"" which evolved from strictly comedic to more dramatic over several years."
buffy,39shac,catdoctor,3,Sun Jun 14 20:27:20 2015 UTC,"Other than MASH, the closest (very!) vague approximation was The Wild Wild West, straight Western, straight detective, and spy spoof, wrapped together. But that, as much as I'll always love it, was jury-rigged. Joss's shows had a solid unity."

TV convention, I guess ‘There are no dead students here…this week’; Snyder has great lines  ‘Ow!’ ‘Don’t sue’ ‘This girl’s sort of petty for a god’—this line made me think of Glory Somehow Marcie got Cordelia and Buffy over to the Bronze In the epilogue scene, how does Marcie know where to sit? Everyone is invisible"

buffy,39szsk,buffanater,5,Sun Jun 14 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"Weekly episode notes   1 Why does buffy never zip up her bag? It seems like that should be a priority since she's trying to keep her slaying a secret. 2 I think the teacher was already talking about Othello the entire class. Otherwise it makes no sense to bring it up as late as she did. 3 Xander's expression the entire time Cordy is talking during class is great. 4 The way the bat is picked up is wrong. The handle faces the hall way, but is lifted up first. That means she would have to be almost touching is right arm and reaching across his face with her left arm. She would have to be as tall or taller then him to lift the bat so high. 5 It's a happy coincidence that Willow decided to call Mitch's dad ""the beast"" 6 When Harmony falls down the stairs she magically ends up in front of the trash can. 7 How does Marcie get into her ""nest""? Buffy would have seen her climb up a latter or rope. 8 So this is the episode that /u/krabat- got his mouse pad from. 9 Why is Cordelia testing her dress at school? Are teachers helping her after hours? 10 I had similar thoughts to this point, but /u/clockworklycanthrope said it better then I could.   ""I have mixed feelings about Marcy. On one hand, I feel really bad for her. It's obviously sad that she was so isolated. On the other hand, I find it odd that she made so many attempts to reach out to Cordelia's crowd, specifically. Trying to join the ""popular kids"" despite having no links to them seems like a poorly thought out social strategy. I think her lashing out at Cordy and pals would've made more sense if they had openly mocked or publicly embarrassed her. Sure, they were rude to her, but that was how they treated everyone. A more logical and mature decision would've been to try to make friends with students in other crowds. Not having done so makes the character seem more violent and childish than pitiable, which was obviously not the goal; I think this was a mistake on the writers' part. In fact, the saddest part of the episode was not seeing Marcy get made fun of by the popular crowd (since that happens to nearly everyone, at some point), but seeing her get ignored by the teacher, Mrs. Miller. That moment was crushing, and more scenes like it would've made the character seem much easier to relate to.""   11 How did Marcy move two knocked out people from a crowded school into a privately owned club that was most likely locked? 12 perhaps it was just her choice of words, but does Marcy know about Buffy being the slayer? If she does, wouldn't she tell people in the government? She wouldn't have to worry about them thinking she's crazy, they're the ones that put her in a class for supernatural people. 13 my head canon says this is the early days of the initiative.    edit: It looks like this posted several times, I think I deleted them all. Sorry about that."

buffy,39szsk,DaddyCatALSO,2,Mon Jun 15 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"I got the impression that the earlier class where Marcie vanished was on a different play or novel - I'm not too familiar with Othello but I understand he's regarded as a Tragic Hero in the sense the ""evil king in the Scottish play"" and Hamlet are.,  I think the ones helping Cordelia were also students, mostly.  Given how Marcie hung around , she might have heard about Buffy's role, and she also might have made an entrance in an out-of-the-way corner The Bronze earlier.  Given how we know Joss now, maybe the writers were actually going for an angle that would make Marcie a bit less pitiable."

buffy,39szsk,ModerateBias,7,Mon Jun 15 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"Two consistency problems.   One with Marcie, the other with Angel.  In one scene, when buffy is in her ""nest"" she has a knife, but chooses not to stab buffy.   We are left to think maybe its because she doesn't want to hurt anyone who wasn't responsible for her treatment...  but then she seems to have no problem shortly thereafter attempting to murder Giles, Willow, and Xander.   While one could stretch and include willow and xander, since they did have 4 classes each with her and still didn't know her, there is simply no way Giles COULD have known her... he was new this year...    since she vanished 6 months ago, we must conclude she vanished VERY early in this school year.   So why spare buffy but then have no issue killing giles?  The second is the scene where angel appears.   How did Giles know that was angel?  he had not yet met him.  all he should have known is vampire, and should have reacted very differently.   I mean he probably had a description, but its a stretch to say he instantly recognized him based on that"
buffy,39szsk,The_Ripper42,8,Sun Jun 14 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Really all Buffy had to do was mention his nancy boy hair gel and I'm sure Giles could pick him out of a crowd.

Or was she running around Sunnydale stealing food out of people's hands?  Willows wearing a scooby shirt!  All of the Moments where Buffy is a little jealous of Cord and nostalgic of her past are a really great setup for her letting go of her childhood and embracing her role as the slayer in the finale.   Love the dynamic between Giles and Angel. And I have some suspicion that those Slayer volumes were hidden by the Watcher's Council instead of lost.   I was in band, and none of the flute players could ever play that loud  They missed a great opportunity to make the secret government program part of the initiative  Cordys insight into loneliness makes me hope some of the stuff she says to her friends is just her seeing how far she can go  I really enjoy this episode but some of the popular kids making fun of the unpopular kids was a little cliché/over the top"

As to why Willow or Xander had never gotten acquainted with Marcie can be partly laid to ""that's how it goes"" and partly to Jesse's influence. in spite of Xander's lack of respect for Jesse's intelligence, Jesse seemed to emotionally dominate the triad, and he was definitely a cool-kid-wannabe and the main reason why the gang by 10th grade  didn't include Jonathan, Tucker, etc."

What if the thousands of Hell dimensions are simply different planets within the same ""dark"" universe?

buffy,39ro3r,secretsarebest,3,Sun Jun 14 14:02:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly that doesn't seem very powerful compared to feats from other fictional Universes.  In fact, within the angelverse and Buffy universe, the powers that be and senior partners of W&H seem more powerful.  But it could be simply a case where importance in hierarchy rank does not imply strictly power rating.  EG in the marvel universe Galactus is very high up on the cosmic hierarchy of entities but tends to lose to much lower ranked and younger cosmic entities and forces (I exclude mortal heroes who get the better of cosmic Being for obvious reasons)  So yes , the first might well be telling the truth and yet not be so powerful."
buffy,39ro3r,BadEgo,3,Sun Jun 14 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"I don’t know how the First might compare with other big evils, but compared to the other Big Bads of BtVS it stacks up pretty well. First, what they attempted to accomplish:  Master - open the hellmouth. Angelus - destroy everything Mayor - Become true demon Adam - Kill a bunch of people Glory - go back to her dimension Dark Willow - destroy the world First - supremacy of evil over the world, permanently  All of these I think suggest something less ambitious than the First. The Master, the Mayor and Glory had comparatively modest ambitions, however significant the collateral damage might be. Anglelus and Dark Willow wanted to destroy the world, a big thing to be sure, but it’s a one-off trick. I think it would take far less power to destroy the world than to totally remake it in one’s own image. The First has far more ambitious plans than the others, which suggests that it has a pretty high estimation of its power.  Second, think of what happened to all of the Big Bads. Almost all of them were killed by Buffy and the Scoobies. The First was defeated, but only with big supernatural help from W&H. There’s no suggestion that it was destroyed, just all the neandervamps. It is the only Big Bad that survives.  Third, the First was also able to bring back Angelus back from a hell dimension, which suggests some serious power.  Fourth, I don’t think “influencing people” should be downplayed. Getting people to kill their best friend, commit suicide, run away, lie, etc., can destroy your opponent just as effectively to brute force. Getting people to do what they would not otherwise do is a serious kind of power, and being able to do it through suggestion is probably more significant than using brute force to do it. It’s more repeatable and can become easily internalized so that you don’t even have to suggest it anymore."
buffy,39ro3r,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"Could you refresh my memory on what the first did in terms of manipulation.  My memory only includes that of a potential running away out of fear and getting killed.  There were some tricks involving it's ability to take the form of others that naturally created suspicion but in the long run didn't do much damage .  Basically I don't see how much more manipulative it was compared to say the Mayor who with a few words tore Buffy and Angel apart and bought Faiths love. That's two full fledged hardened Slayers as opposed to manipulation of one scared potential who was the weakest of a dozen of them.  Sure the potentials and Scooby gang were demoralized at points but those points it was understandable (your best warrior having problems besting a uber vamp) I don't see much extra manipulation going on.  Also I have a huge problem on understanding what the first was trying to do.  You say the First has bigger ambitions. Is that really true? Like most of the big bads, her plan seem to be hell on earth (leaving aside why she needed caleb and ubervamps really)  Opening the hell mouth is a ambition going back to the Master!   Also you say the Firsts plan is for evil to dominate. How is this special different ?  Also I could be wrong but I don't think the First actually said that or was obvious on what it wanted.  Are you theorizing based on the fact it called it's The first evil?   EDIT you have a good point about bringing Angel back except the powers that be are capable of that. Willow herself pulled a almost equalavent feat except pulling Buffy from Heaven."
buffy,39ro3r,secretsarebest,2,Mon Jun 15 00:13:02 2015 UTC,"There was a lot more than just the one potential. There was all the stuff that happened in Conversations with Dead People, which did a lot to break down the cohesion of the Scooby's and sow distrust of Buffy. It got Chloe to kill herself, along with other things which demoralized the potentials and undercut Buffys authority over them. It got Andrew to kill Jonathan. There was getting Spike to kill again, even after he got his soul back and even with the chip. There was getting the Principal to put his vendetta against Spike above the needs of the larger battle. It worked to drive a wedge between Buffy and Giles of all people, one which I don't think has even been mended in the comics.  Overall, the First did a lot to turn a unified fighting force into a group of squabbling kids - that kicked Buffy out of her own house! That's why in one of the conversations between Caleb and the First one of them said that they were all ready to be slaughtered.   Also, it did wipe out the watchers Council, which had evidently been around for millennia. It also wanted to permanently end the entire slayer line, not just kill one slayer to have another one inevitably pop up. And it created the situation where everybody in Sunnydale abandoned the city. This is the population that had figured out a way to live with vampires and demons and zombies and everything else for decades.  As for its ambitions, the First was quite explicit when it took the form of Cassie in Conversations with Dead People. It said it was done with any kind of balancing of good and evil and that things were going to be permanently changed. It was something way more than simply opening the Hellmouth. We got a view of what the Master would do with that in the Wish. And while that sucked for Sunnydale, it was hardly a worldwide catastrophe. And while the mayor was a master manipulator (but really, at that point how hard would it have been to separate Buffy and Angel?), in the end he just wanted to be a big demon worm, of a kind which had already been defeated by regular human beings earlier in history. I don't see either of them having much more in mind than a fiefdom that they controlled. The First wanted to do so much more to the whole BtVS universe.  As for the powers that be or Wolfram and Hart, I don't know how they would compare to the First. I only watched Angel once and I never understood how those fit into the Buffy universe. Perhaps they are more powerful than the First, but I was only focusing on the idea that the First was the most powerful of the Big Bads in BtVS. And in my opinion, by far the most dangerous and scary."

Every enemy Buffy has ever faced, every monster, every single man, woman and child on the planet with ill intentions are influenced by the First. It is evil incarnate, all evil flows from its influence and that is true power.    We only have it's word that it's eternal .It's basically a ghost non corporeal form really.   I don't think we have much evidence that ""all evil flows from it's influence.."" I mean the name The first evil kinda suggests that.. but is it really true ?"
buffy,39ro3r,matiasgee,3,Sun Jun 14 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't just influence people, it makes them doubt everything about themselves to the point of hopelessness. That's pretty powerful and very evil."

buffy,39ro3r,ravencoal,4,Sun Jun 14 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought of the First as being an entity composed of all the evil within every being. Basically its consciousness is the manifestation of all evil in all beings. The reason it is only incorporeal is because it is made up of thought... it has no body to effect the physical world and therefore has to work through intermediaries. It really, really wants one though and it hinted that what it was trying to pull off on the hellmouth would somehow give it a physical body.  So yes, it is pretty much eternal unless you destroy every sentient being, everywhere, everywhen. Not all powerful though, as its greatest power seems to center on information gathering."
buffy,39ro3r,kaggzz,6,Sun Jun 14 08:11:46 2015 UTC,"Beljoxa's Eye, the all-knowing oracle fleshball dude, didn't seem to put forward any doubts about it, and freely referred to it as The First. Not conclusive, but one more step towards it being true."
buffy,39qi1b,buffeq,16,Sat Jun 13 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"Hush really grabs your attention because the writing quality is on another level from the rest of the first half of Season 4.   What did you think of Something Blue? I think it's one of the funniest episodes in the entire series.   Oz is the best! He has some of the best lines on the show. That being said, I was surprised at the fact that I was OK with him leaving. Keep watching, and you'll see how they handle that more fully.   I feel the same way about Riley, which you will find is a common sentiment. I think it was best summed up when someone said, 'Riley is the incarnation of the colour beige'.  This Season may not have the clear story that Season 3 had, but it's still a solid season and there are a lot of reasons to like it. Anya is one of them. She's great. And as good as Season 4 Spike is, it's my least favourite version of him, for what it's worth."
buffy,39qi1b,pober,7,Sat Jun 13 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"Something Blue! I also thought it was hilarious, in fact this season has had a lot more humour in it than previous seasons it feels like."
buffy,39qi1b,pober,2,Sun Jun 14 00:20:21 2015 UTC,I was going to write something about Oz's good one liners but I felt he still didn't have much more to do.
buffy,39qi1b,Grunzelbart,5,Sat Jun 13 23:17:09 2015 UTC,"Oz's function in the group is the level-headed voice of reason. You never saw him make a rash decision and he helped the group see the big picture. He was the moral centre.   That's not to say he is a one-dimensional character. He obviously has his weaknesses (e.g. Veruca [ughh]). I do wish we got some more back story on him, though."
buffy,39qi1b,jayman419,3,Sat Jun 13 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"The thing about Oz was that the hole triangle with Veruca was kinda supposed to be his full-season arc, but Seth Green decided to leave early so that's kinda the reason the whole story got crammed into an episode and didn't work as well IMO."
buffy,39qi1b,pober,9,Sun Jun 14 09:53:12 2015 UTC,"Spike's accent is probably half forgotten memories, and half badly made up from TV and movies he watches. He hasn't been home in centuries.  Riley is a prick, and he's far from perfect. But he's a decent guy. I'm not saying you have to like him. (I don't like him.)  ""Beer Bad"" is easily one of the worst episodes of the series.  edit: Rephrased it to make Riley's bit slightly less spoiler-y. Looked at S4 and it looks like you have a couple episodes before anything develops with his character."
buffy,39qi1b,MoonSpider,7,Sat Jun 13 20:56:55 2015 UTC,Angel gave up his 'Irish' accent (cringe) for an American one. And I suppose Spike's accent varying is plausible in a broad linguistic sense.
buffy,39qi1b,3raserE,3,Sat Jun 13 21:56:38 2015 UTC,Spike's accent to me sounds half right but half completely wrong which results in it sounding really strange. It doesn't bother me too much though.
buffy,39qi1b,withmirrors,5,Sat Jun 13 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Throughout the series he got some accent coaching from Anthony Stewart Head, who couldn't stand his first attempts at the accent.  It levels out eventually even though it's never truly English-sounding.  In my head I chalk it up to Spike's accent changing after spending so many decades in different parts of the world than where he grew up."
buffy,39qi1b,danielle_kb,7,Sun Jun 14 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"Season 4 has some great episodes--Hush and Restless (Season finale) especially were, for me, some of the show's best moments--but it also has some low points.   Spike becomes a more interesting character later on, especially Seasons 6 and 7. He was tutored on his accent by the actor who plays Giles, because Spike's accent is pretty close to what Anthony Stewart Head actually sounds like, but I can see what you mean.   I hated Riley for reasons that are somewhat apparent in the first half of Season 4 but become much more visible as he and Buffy/the Scoobies get closer. Speaking generally, one of the best parts of the show from a feminist perspective is that there's a female lead who's the toughest, strongest character, and everyone accepts that. And with Riley being supersoldier boy from the army, he has trouble with that. Not hugely, granted, but it's there, and it pissed me off.   For me, the first half of Season 4 was a bit of a lull too. But 5 and 6 were IMO the two best seasons the show had. So don't worry, it gets back to being great.   One of the many great things about Hush was that it introduced Tara, who was one of my favorites. I really loved her, and I'm not the only one.  I liked Oz but didn't love him, but I thought the character deserved a better exit. He was always a good guy, and he should've handled that brief love triangle a lot better. It seemed out of character for him, especially after that Willow-Xander thing in early season 3."

buffy,39nrn2,snowxprincess,5,Sat Jun 13 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"Great review! I'm curious what your opinion on Angel when he got his own show. I personally disliked Angel on Buffy since I thought their relationship was toxic and brought out the worst in both of them. But when Angel got his own limelight, I fell in love with the character. He's so much funnier and better fleshed out on his own, as was Buffy without him."
buffy,39nrn2,Sludgeycore,2,Sat Jun 13 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree totally with what you said. When together, Buffy and Angel were mostly characterized by their relationship.

Xander's speech to Buffy about her and Riley's relationship shows how much he cares and understands the gang. Another point, and one that's brought up often, is he's the human element. Every scooby except him has some sort of supernatural ability. Willow goes from nerdy and shy to a witch who's confident. Buffy has always been super powerful. Giles has spells and a library of knowledge in his head. What is he? He provides support and guides and he always admits to his failures which help him mature."
buffy,39nrn2,kmoproductions,2,Sat Jun 13 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't decided yet for Angel. My problem is that I don't think I have enough motivation about that show to do it. I liked it until the half of Season 3, and then everything felt rushed and too big for the show. I watched the whole Season 4 on fast-forward only because I wanted to be aware of the plot changes, but I couldn't care less about that whole story about Jasmine. I know that it was some people's favorite season but for me it felt off. On the other hand, having a negative review (well, not entirely because some stuff was really cool) could be interesting. I'll keep you updated!"

buffy,39nrn2,a_small_sea,3,Sun Jun 14 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"Love this review. I watch sporadically as a kid growing up and then lost touch with the series, and then I did a rewatch of the entire series (haven't touched Angel yet, I just couldn't do it!) in a very short time this past winter, just like you.   I have to say I'm so glad that I did the rewatch now. As an adult woman approaching my 30s who has experienced failed relationships, heartbreak, and especially very recently, sudden death of a loved one, this series hit home in so many ways and was like therapy to me.   While the first season is super cheesy and hokey, I have a special spot in my heart for it just like I do for my time in high school. Life was simpler then. But man, was I dumb back then. I wouldn't want to relive that time for the life of me, but there are definitely moments in my life and while watching later seasons of Buffy where I felt nostalgic for when things were more straight-forward, easier, and there was only one silly monster to kill at a time.   I also loved the relationships Buffy has with Angel, Riley, and Spike. They are really interesting case studies for unhealthy, toxic relationships - each one of them. And while we root for one or the other, you have to admit they are all flawed but so incredibly truthful. The reasons we love and the ways we express that love are not always so pure. And throughout the series, other people and Buffy hint at the idea that maybe it's not them, it's her. Often we put ourselves in situations that are harmful or not healthy because of our own deeply ingrained issues.   Just like in life, as I progressed through the series, I started to resist watching another episode - there was even a time when I knew the episode about Joyce was coming up and I stopped watching for a couple weeks, because I didn't feel quite ready to go there yet. But unfortunately you can't just not grow up or participate in life. Experience isn't streaming on Netflix. You get older, life gets harder, shit happens. And for me, Buffy is such an amazing heroine and I love that we get to live through all this through her eyes. The biggest moments of her character for me are when she has to admit her flaws, make mistakes, and grapple with her incredible isolation. No wonder we love Buffy. I feel like her all the time. I ask myself, ""What would Buffy do?"" a lot.   Season 6 is probably my favorite season of all but also the hardest for me to watch. It's not about demons or vampires, it's about real people, real life situations. Like Joss has been quoted as saying that the scariest thing of all is just some angry guy with a gun. Tara's death was devastating to me, not because I love her character (I do), but because it was so sudden and so so senseless. There was no warning, there was no reason, she was just a casualty. And in life, that's often how death is. We want a reason for people to die, we want logic, but there often isn't any. And the way Willow experienced grief was RIGHT on the nose for me. When Joyce died, they explored the shock, the discomfort, the silence, the denial. But with Tara's death, we saw the other side of grief: pure rage. And that is so real and so scary and so ugly and so truthful.   To me, the Buffy series is just a huge metaphor for Life. Joss did a great job of having the characters and stories grow, evolve, and become more complex as the seasons went on. Just like life, it gets more complicated, the answers aren't always so clear, and there isn't always a fully happy ending.   PS: Yikes this is long but damn do I love talking about Buffy."
buffy,39nrn2,Xander667,2,Sat Jun 13 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Hahaha gotta love the long comment!  I like your point about Buffy's relationships. With Angel, Buffy was too dependant. With Riley, she went to the opposite side of the pendulum and was too independant (Also, Riley didn't seem to accept 100% the fact that she was stronger than him). With Spike, she was messed up emotionally and tried to find comfort in a relationship based on sex. In the end, none of these worked for her. I think it's great that the writers didn't get her in a relationship by the end of the show, because it showed that you can be strong without needing a man to back you. In the last episode, she basically tells Angel that she wants to get to know  and feel good with herself before getting committed in anything serious. As someone who has followed exactly the same relationships patterns as her, I have to say it was comforting to finally see a female TV character that is able to be independant without being crazy. It gives me hope for my own future :)"
buffy,39nrn2,kmoproductions,8,Sun Jun 14 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"For the Xander thing. Obviously you've never been the person that sees. He has had growth, though not as drastic or noticeable as some of the others. He didn't have to deal with things others did. He was able to adapt and deal. You would have had to watch The Zeppo. So you know that he does have his own stuff to deal with, but he didn't make it public. He dealt with it himself. His arch was being comfortable in his own skin and growing up and realizing who the hell he was and what his purpose was. And when he has that talk with Dawn? That was his arch. He finally admitted what he was about. He was the one that sees. He dealt with his shit the only way he knew how, humor. When shit gets real, make people laugh. Thats what he does, me too.  He's one of the unsung heros in my book. Did he make bad decisions? Yes. The Angel thing may not have been the best but it was needed. He knew that if he told Buffy what Will was doing she would have let him kill her. In his mind the spell wouldn't work and he knew that the world needs a slayer so he made the crappy choice. He did the best he could. You may not like him, but the series would be much different without him."
buffy,39nrn2,DaddyCatALSO,9,Sat Jun 13 02:31:26 2015 UTC,"I'll preface with I haven't watched much in the past few years (especially season 7) but Xander is my least favorite character by far. The whole point of the Zeppo is that Xander is dealing with a minor thing while everyone else is averting AN APOCALYPSE. It's awesome that he is successful in that ep, that he does it on his own, and that he gains some confidence from it but it doesn't change the fact that the gang DOESN'T need him.  All the characters have significant challenges that they face and Xander's are, for sure, the most realistic and boring. He has an uncomfortable-at-best/abusive-at-worst home situation, doesn't have much direction for the future, and is overall pretty mediocre. And that can be really hard! I get that his coping mechanism for all of that was to be funny. However, being funny doesn't necessarily mean being a good and loyal friend or being a good part of the team. And, especially when you compare what the other main characters deal with and how they get through their own issues, his home problems and lack of direction aren't a good enough excuse for his actions to me.   My biggest problem with Xander is his reaction to each of Buffy's main love interests. His attitude is different in each case but it's consistently not how I think a good friend should act. It wasn't just Angel (although that was totally shitty). He was possessive over Buffy for the first few seasons, lied to Buffy about Willow's spell and never told her about it, gave that completely ridiculous speech to her about going after Riley, and was just generally AWFUL about Spike.  Of course the series would have been much different without him. But maybe it could have been better (to at least OP and me) if Xander had been different. It would be different if any of the main characters had been significantly changed. That doesn't invalidate critique.   Anyway, I'm probably being a little harsh because I remember more of the jerky stuff he did. Or maybe I'm just not a person who sees! :)"

buffy,39hdty,DaddyCatALSO,6,Fri Jun 12 19:19:32 2015 UTC,I remember this. It was    about getting a certain number of reviews of one o he r books. she got 'em and she sang and danced.
buffy,39hdty,coolbeaNs92,5,Thu Jun 11 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"This video is awesome!  The fact that it triggered the memory I had tried to push to the furthest corners of my brain are not. They played the Macarena at my sisters wedding last December. I was really drunk, I saw the video, oh God."
buffy,39hdty,fraac,4,Thu Jun 11 22:13:04 2015 UTC,I think having an embarrassing macarena experience is a rite of passage. Mine happened at an ice skating rink in high school. On the ice.
buffy,39hdty,wedge713,4,Thu Jun 11 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Very cool. She's the greatest. To cheer myself up I usually refer to Amber's opinion of my Team Fortress 2 skills.
buffy,39hdty,fraac,-5,Fri Jun 12 06:25:05 2015 UTC,She didn't age well
buffy,39hdty,free112701,7,Fri Jun 12 15:55:23 2015 UTC,She's a beautiful grownup woman now! She's a person in the body of a beautiful grownup woman. How weird it must be.

buffy,39hdty,DaddyCatALSO,4,Thu Jun 11 23:54:47 2015 UTC,It's really really hard not to be in love with that woman.
buffy,39fua9,kaekit36,21,Thu Jun 11 13:05:20 2015 UTC,Not that it would have changed anything but I shudder to think about the events with Ted happening with such a young Dawn in the house. I could only imagine how much Dawn would have taken to him with his false charm and how much danger she would actually be in being so young. Creepy...
buffy,39fua9,Shark_Lover1,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think that too. I imagine that she would somewhat cling to him. For the most part she behaved ok when Joyce was around, it was with Buffy she rebelled, so I imagine she would have behaved around him. (Just imagining little Dawn is so cute). Would that have made Ted wanna take her too? How did she react when Buffy 'killed' him. It was late enough that Dawn was probably in her room playing or sleeping when Ted came back. He could have just locked the door. Just imagine how much shit Dawn musta seen going up. Just imagine when Angelus came to town. Dear god, she was young enough to had Joyce buy her a puppy :("
buffy,39fua9,danielle_kb,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:19:39 2015 UTC,I actually came on here to mention Ted. You beat me to it. Creepy is right...
buffy,39fua9,iwanttoreddittoo,15,Fri Jun 12 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Great idea! My first thought is that Buffy would not have run away to LA  but then I remembered while typing this they mentioned it specifically in season 6. Still, I really mean it shouldn't have happened if dawn was there. I don't see Buffy abandoning her little sister like that."
buffy,39fua9,TheHundredSeas,18,Thu Jun 11 13:13:11 2015 UTC,"I could still see her running away out of some weird fear that she would hurt Dawn too, or maybe her mom would have actually thrown her out with a child in the house."
buffy,39fua9,kaekit36,13,Thu Jun 11 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"Your last statement was exactly my train of thought. Joyce would have wanted to protect Dawn from whatever craziness was going on with Buffy so she would have still told Buffy to leave, essentially kicking her out. I don't think that would have changed."
buffy,39fua9,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jun 11 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Except that Joyce's staement to Buffy was less kickign Buffy out as it was hyperbole to add punch to Joyce's commands. My dad was fond of that kind of (""I wish you'd fallena nd broken your heads."") and it's a major plot point in old(?) murder mystery movies."
buffy,39fua9,bwburke94,10,Thu Jun 11 19:33:43 2015 UTC,"The monks appear to have changed as few ""real"" events as possible to fit Dawn in, rather than starting from 1986 and working from there. Everything that happened before September of 2000 still happened, except if it specifically couldn't happen in a world where Dawn existed.  Dawn wasn't a full-fledged Scooby for most of the 1997-2000 period, but she did know Buffy was the Slayer from the start (per ""Real Me"") so she may have played a minor role in certain early episodes."
buffy,39fua9,Beloit,11,Thu Jun 11 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of (non-canon) comics that use this idea. Sometimes they use events that must have happened but were never actually shown (e.g. Hank and Joyce's separation) with Dawn being there, while others actually show past events moments from the TV series but with Dawn inserted. In one of them Dawn was held hostage by Angelus inside Sunnydale High instead of Willow, for example."
buffy,39fua9,longarmofmylaw,3,Thu Jun 11 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"I can't remember if it was mentioned in the show, or one of the books, but I remember something about Dawn finding out Buffy was the Slayer half a season earlier than Joyce. During the attack on the mall by the Judge, Angelus and Dru."
buffy,39fua9,scrawnybrawny,5,Thu Jun 11 22:44:39 2015 UTC,Ohh this is interesting. Does anybody know the full details/source of this?
buffy,39fua9,Livesinthefuture,2,Fri Jun 12 13:17:51 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure as to source. But I'm pretty certain one of the comics mentions/flashes back to when Angelus first appeared and grabbed Willow outside, in the library hallway.  Except it wasn't Willow any longer but now Dawn."
buffy,39fua9,Kalse1229,2,Sat Jun 13 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well, the season 1 episode ""Angel"" could've been Dawn's first clue that something wasn't right about Buffy's life..."
buffy,39fua9,yallcat,2,Thu Jun 11 21:33:16 2015 UTC,This was going to be the premise of the Buffy animated series that never made it past pilot.
buffy,39fua9,nutbastard,2,Thu Jun 11 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'm 31 and honestly I'd be hard pressed to come up with more than a dozen distinct memories of my brother when we were growing up... mostly I just have a vague sense of who he is. There are some concrete memories, but considering that we spent a total of at least 6,000 days in each others company as kids, what I can pull up is pretty weak. Most of the memories are of conflicts, and even those are just a few frames and a loose understanding of what happened.  Really I don't think you'd have to change much, because how often do we actively go through those memories? And how detailed and accurate are they really?"
buffy,39fua9,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Jun 12 09:41:08 2015 UTC,I don't know; would be easier to answer with soem examples.
buffy,39fua9,suss2it,12,Thu Jun 11 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, one example that I can think of that is Faith's interaction with Buffy and her family. If you notice when Faith comes back in Season 7, Dawn is very edgy with her. Maybe Faith abducted/tied up Dawn as well as Joyce when she tried to do the body swap in Season 4?   Another one might be Ted, Buffy was very standoffish around him, originally just because she didn't want her mom in a relationship, perhaps Dawn was the same too?"
buffy,39fua9,buffanater,2,Thu Jun 11 15:28:16 2015 UTC,Or maybe Dawn was the opposite and got really attached to Ted.
buffy,39fua9,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"Probably, he was someone who her mom liked, was -most likely- nice to her, and was around a lot."

buffy,39e8pg,JangoF76,29,Thu Jun 11 06:39:32 2015 UTC,Old lady penis head is definitely the worst.
buffy,39e8pg,lazydivey,12,Thu Jun 11 10:52:30 2015 UTC,She was at least horrifyingly bizarre.
buffy,39e8pg,Interference22,12,Thu Jun 11 11:06:28 2015 UTC,I thought the point was that it was just so bizarre it even threw Buffy off.

buffy,39e8pg,kmoproductions,47,Sat Jun 13 16:44:46 2015 UTC,I'd like to nominate the three-headed thing Spike and Dawn steal an egg from a couple of episodes after The Body. The thing could barely move and was as threatening as a sock.
buffy,39e8pg,Enzown,28,Thu Jun 11 05:43:22 2015 UTC,Bit like the demon the frat boys were sacrificing Buffy and Cordy to - it mostly sat in the background swinging back and forth.
buffy,39e8pg,magickmidget,13,Thu Jun 11 09:26:18 2015 UTC,The giant fat guy in the tub. That would definitely be my nomination.
buffy,39e8pg,TheCheshireCody,3,Thu Jun 11 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely the grossest one, but at least it looked not awful."
buffy,39e8pg,Caelestia,2,Thu Jun 11 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the guy in the tub was the one in the basement of the frathouse, but that was Reptile Boy, which was actually pretty cool looking as I recall. What was the one with the guy in the tub who had to be constantly basted?"
buffy,39e8pg,TheCheshireCody,6,Thu Jun 11 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"That was in ""Bad Girls."" He was a demon named Balthazar, who had apparently been a longtime rival of the Mayor for control over Sunnydale. His source if power was an amulet that had been stolen from him, rendering him in the state we saw in the show. He had a cult of vampires that were trying to retrieve it for him."
buffy,39e8pg,venom8599,2,Thu Jun 11 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you! That is my nomination for worst demon, both in terms of concept and execution/makeup."

buffy,39e8pg,kmoproductions,21,Sat Jun 13 16:45:32 2015 UTC,The Praying Mantis (Ms French) and the Fork Guy in Teacher's Pet both sucked and simply clashed way too much.
buffy,39e8pg,zbobby1990,4,Thu Jun 11 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"Wow I totally forgot about Fork Guy.  He might be the worst.  Also it's annoying in the first season when they forget to put in the ""dusting"" sound effect so she just stakes him and he falls over... and then he's gone.  I get that they didn't have the budget to show the dusting, but come on, that sound effect can't cost that much!"
buffy,39e8pg,ChicaneryBear,29,Thu Jun 11 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"Robot Moloch in I Robot, You Jane was pretty bad too."

buffy,39e8pg,Aglovale,5,Fri Jun 12 07:21:21 2015 UTC,"I, for one, appreciated its very-special-episode nature. You have to be careful talking to strangers on the Internet, because you just might get catfished by the ancient Italian demon Moloch the Corruptor!"

buffy,39e8pg,MisterGibs,2,Thu Jun 11 19:53:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. Plus that whole episode just felt like a way to get a bunch of plot stuff set up in the least interesting way possible.
buffy,39e8pg,DaddyCatALSO,13,Sun Jun 14 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"This is one crticism I have always had with Buffy and Angel. I didn't get into either until about two years ago and one of the things that turned me off until then was the demon design.  I remember many years before that checking out an episode of Angel and seeing karaoke by a guy in green grease make-up and halloween devil horns (Lorne). I just WTFed and changed the channel. And even now I found the make-up design in the humanoid demons to just be distracting.  But, I'm not sure I have any ideas of what would have worked better."

I know that the whole first three seasons center around a metaphor, that High School is hell, but this episode just seemed too heavy-handed for me."

buffy,39e8pg,IraninaGenius,3,Fri Jun 12 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"Because the werewolves had to do things a trained dog can't do like fight people, jump out of trees, jump on cars and have nasty werewolf sex"

Then next up we jump right into ""I Robot, You Jane"" S01E08 to attract the computer savvy internet crowds.  Everyone loves romance, so after that we should show ""Where the Wild Things Are"" S04E18 to introduce the most important romantic relationship - Buffy and Riley.  After that if we still haven't won them over, I say just every Riley episode back to back. Can't forget to have ""Beer Bad"" S04E05 in there too just to make sure we get the alcohol message out there right off the bat.   /s"

I remember going downstairs and my roommates would be watching Dawson's Creek and I was WAY to cool for that (sigh), so I completely wrote off Buffy as well and had those two paired in my head in some sort of indistinguishable CW teenage angst-fest.  I finally watched an episode of Buffy in 2003 and have subsequently learned not to be such a dismissive jackass."
buffy,39db7y,AngryWizard,5,Thu Jun 11 00:35:45 2015 UTC,WB teenage angst-fest.  CW came along after Buffy ended.
buffy,39db7y,yallcat,2,Thu Jun 11 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"Well, it's kind of fair to say, considering Buffy was on both halves of what became the CW -- as seasons 6 and 7 were on UPN."

buffy,39db7y,BackOfTheHearse,5,Thu Jun 11 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they don't use the same god-awful HD transfer that Pivot does. I was watching some of S4 the other day and it was terrible. Whatever filter was originally applied in post-production to make scenes shot in the daytime look like night were just gone. So in S04E07 ""The Initiative"" it looks like Riley's frat is having a kegger at around noon and some of the forest patrol shots look like they'd have to be standing under street lights. Xander's basement no longer looks dark and dank, but as a rather brightly lit room, etc."
buffy,39db7y,venom8599,2,Thu Jun 11 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"Ugh that's terrible. How does that even happen, losing the color correction?! Netflix isn't like that is it?"
buffy,39db7y,vivellimac,3,Thu Jun 11 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"Netflix is fine.  In fact, in my opinion many scenes end up being too dark.  I know if I'm watching in a brightly lit room, some of the black shades start to blur together."
buffy,39db7y,informareWORK,2,Thu Jun 11 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"They have a shoddy transfer to HD. I'm guessing what they did when they originally filmed the show was use normal lighting and then apply a filter in post-production  to make it seem like night. All the post on Buffy was done on video which has a much lower resolution, so in order to have the show in HD they have to redo everything. So most likely they just ignored that filter for whatever reason. It also makes some scenes look as if vampires are in pretty direct sunlight.  There are also many shots in the Pivot version that were widened and include cameras, lights, and in at least one case a cameraman. IIRC in ""Prophecy Girl"" the Master can be seen in the shot speaking his lines when he's supposed to have disappeared. Just after the shot Buffy is seen looking around the room trying to find him.

Buffy does not discuss her time in Heaven as it is too traumatic, so this might extend to Tara as well. She does not grieve openly for someone for who she cannot express her full envy for. Tara is somewhere Buffy wishes she were."

buffy,39bvkb,Viper_H,22,Wed Jun 10 22:33:30 2015 UTC,"Agree.  And I think it also shows the development of Buffy's character as she gets older and she's faced so many enemies.  In season 1 all she wants to do is make friends.  But by season 6 she's, understandably, much more reluctant to let people get close to her."

buffy,39bvkb,SweetCatastrophy,3,Thu Jun 11 00:11:39 2015 UTC,Yep. She even says in Season 7 that she would kill Dawn if she had to which she was obviously EXTREMELY adamant against in The Gift. Buffy grew up/changed... a lot after dying.
buffy,39bvkb,Chicken421,4,Thu Jun 11 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"I looove Buffy and Tara's friendship. Though they never get as close as the other Scoobies, I think they share something special.  In season 6, Buffy is unable to be her authentic self with her closest loved ones. It leads to her to turn to Spike, who's outside that circle, but their relationship has a darkness to it and ends up making her feel even worse about herself and she withdraws more. So she turns to Tara, who is still at enough distance from Buffy that she's able to be vulnerable and confide in her. I see Spike and Tara as two sides of a coin for Buffy in Season 6. Spike loves Buffy, loudly, passionately, and it consumes her. Tara loves Buffy, quietly, compassionately, and it helps Buffy find herself again.  ...I may ship it"

buffy,39asoz,bonpas,33,Wed Jun 10 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"This scene is too much. It's when Buffy looks at the clock and panics that really sets me off though.   Apart from this scene, Buffy's sacrifice in The Gift is probably the saddest moment for me."

Because I just played my version over and over and all I can hear is David saying ""Shh, shh, please"".

It is literally what makes me cry each time and I see them both so happy with the possibility of a future together. And then. Taken away. Again."
buffy,39e206,Mac720,21,Thu Jun 11 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, can't agree.  I find Tara is a well thought out character - she has her flaws, insecurities, family issues, as well as being just amazing in general. Yes, she does adore Willow, but she also stands up for herself when Willow is losing control of her magic."
buffy,39e206,BlueSnowOwl,9,Thu Jun 11 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"I sometimes feel the same way. I'm rewatching the show now and I'm liking Tara a little less this time around. Oz is one of my top favorite characters, so I'm sure that has something to do with it, but also Amber Benson really doesn't nail it sometimes, and you're right about Tara in that she kind of idolizes Willow and they're very similar. At least for a while. Season 6 Tara is my favorite because she gets some beautiful moments of friendship with Buffy and has some challenging growth regarding her relationship with Willow."
buffy,39e206,strawberryf1elds,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that she becomes more flushed out as a character in season 6 for sure! The whole set up for Dark Willow was really well done. I also loved Oz to death so I'm thinking that probably colors my perception of her, too"
buffy,39e206,fraac,10,Thu Jun 11 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"She was very empathic, in contrast to Willow."
buffy,39e206,Bellevert,6,Thu Jun 11 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"I agree! I think it was a way for them to give a contrast to Willow's darker side. I would have loved to learn more about Tara. I am rewatching season 6 now, and I think exploring the friendship between Buffy and Tara would have been a wonderful storyline. Just more about her background and family as well as growing up with magic. I have a feeling her moral compass comes from lessons learned in her younger years. It would almost mirror what they did with Rupert - not that she was darker, but maybe not quite so innocent."
buffy,39e206,TheStarsDescent,3,Thu Jun 11 12:05:11 2015 UTC,"Although I do like Tara, I do agree with your sentiments on the character.  I didn't dislike Tara - I disliked that they didn't do more with her character.  She was a character who certainly could have had something more intriguing going on - one of the biggest disappointments for me was that they didn't expand on her role in Restless.  It was interesting that she was used as a slayer voice for Buffy - why?  Of all the characters and people that she met, why was it that Tara was the one chosen?  But I don't agree with you on the Cordelia opinion.  I mean, I agree that the show lost something with her departure after season 3... but they certainly gained that something back with the addition of Anya.  Anya challenged the group, added that much needed comedic relief in some of the really heavy scenes (one of my favorite scenes is when the gang is fighting in season 4 and Anya and Tara are just sitting in the bathroom awkwardly), and she had knowledge of the demon world that was incredibly useful.  I think that they covered the Cordelia void with Anya's character pretty well.  But, that's just a personal opinion - I love Cordelia and Anya and I wish they'd been able to interact more throughout the series lol.  :)"
buffy,39e206,Zix117,3,Thu Jun 11 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest disappointment with Tara is that she only really had the one episode focused on her. There was definitely a lot of potential there, ignored in order to make her a background character most of the time. :("
buffy,39e206,pober,3,Thu Jun 11 20:33:13 2015 UTC,First time I watched through I was annoyed Tara wasn't added to the main credits…which made it way worse when they actually did add her to the main credits in Seeing Red. damnyouWhedon
buffy,39e206,Zix117,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"Same. I kept waiting and waiting, then they finally did it in pretty much the worst possible episode :( I thought it took frustratingly long with Lorne on Angel, too, but at least he stuck around after he got promoted."
buffy,39e206,friggidydamn,5,Sat Jun 13 15:45:25 2015 UTC,"I think making Tara similar to Willow was totally intentional. It's role reversal on her relationship with Oz - now Will's the cool one in her relationship. We get to watch her grow into a new role and guide someone else out of their shell. It helps the audience realize how Willow has changed - and her ultimate nightmare of being a meek nerd again in ""Restless"" drives the point home."
buffy,39e206,IraninaGenius,3,Fri Jun 12 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Not only was Tara a rehash of Willow but it was better done the first time; Willow's mixture of cuteness, hotness and playfulness was far more fascinating.  I've seen in reality lesbian couples that resemble each other a lot, so Willow and Tara were not unrealistic, just not very interesting.   In an episode of Angel Willow gets very flustered around Fred and I thought they would have made an interesting couple because they had many things in common like smarts, bookishness and a certain amount of social awkwardness while retaining enough individuality to stand apart. Plus Amy Acker makes a compelling lesbian on Person of Interest."

buffy,39e206,whitew0lf,2,Thu Jun 11 12:15:28 2015 UTC,I hated Tara the first 3 times i saw the show... she does grow on you.
buffy,39e206,Zix117,4,Thu Jun 11 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"Tara is actually my favorite character. I see the similarities between her and earlier seasons Willow, but by the time Tara is introduced, Willow is a very different person, and it's not like they just have two of the same character. Plus Willow is insanely adorable in the first few seasons, so I'm happy to have someone like that present in later seasons as well."

Then next up we jump right into ""I Robot, You Jane"" S01E08 to attract the computer savvy internet crowds.  Everyone loves romance, so after that we should show ""Where the Wild Things Are"" S04E18 to introduce the most important romantic relationship - Buffy and Riley.  After that if we still haven't won them over, I say just every Riley episode back to back. Can't forget to have ""Beer Bad"" S04E05 in there too just to make sure we get the alcohol message out there right off the bat.   /s"

As for the others, it's a huge plot hole - unless aprents had been killed along with those who had Watchers. And Rona (the true ""creature"" of the bunch) might, like Faith, have been a street kid."
buffy,3977qr,DaddyCatALSO,7,Tue Jun 9 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"to OP: A few of them had already gotten watchers to train for being chosen, so the parents probably already knew.

But I have not yet read the comics so that could change."

Buffy didn't get a watcher until she actually became a slayer, why was that different for everyone else?"
buffy,3977qr,elizabethraine,7,Tue Jun 9 20:34:41 2015 UTC,Buffy wasn't discovered until after she was called; they did a badly garbled statement of that in the movie.  Heck Fiaht's Watcher likely didn't meet her/find her until Faith had been takign care of herself on the streets for a couple years
buffy,3977qr,DaddyCatALSO,3,Tue Jun 9 20:40:58 2015 UTC,"Its been a while since I've watched the earlier seasons,  but didn't Kendra say that her watcher came to get her as a child?   And that she was kind of praised in her village because she was a potential.   That bugs me now,  because being the slayer is a secret identity thing and Kendra village knew of their existence and purpose (if I'm remembering correctly)"

Because Buffy is the protagonist, I think we were seeing Dawn through her eyes as her whiny little sister who can't take care of herself and messes everything up. But having a younger sibling myself, I also have a grudging fondness for Dawn. Dawn looks up to Buffy, gives her someone she needs to be a grownup for even when she doesn't want to be.

Cordy and Gunn agree with Wes and are pressuring Angel to act as they fight through some demon of the week, and at the end when someone Wes cares about (that red head girl if the time frame is right...?) is put into danger, he realizes how much Angel cares and agrees to focus on destroying Glory... then they come up with a counter spell to remove Glory's glimmer or something...

buffy,394svy,DaddyCatALSO,7,Tue Jun 9 11:55:12 2015 UTC,Absolutely he would have killed her.  There is no doubt in my mind.
buffy,394svy,Fick_This_Shut,3,Tue Jun 9 18:11:42 2015 UTC,I think it would depend on his relationship with Buffy at that point. If he happened to be Scooby-gang status like Willow or Xand and was sort of like a younger Giles to Buffy I don't see him even thinking of killing Dawn until maybe the threat is really nigh. If not I can see him at least seriously considering it.
buffy,394svy,Royal_Hofner,8,Tue Jun 9 08:38:42 2015 UTC,"well giles is pretty set on doing it if it came to it, until buffy makes the point that she'd just kill him first."
buffy,394svy,faaackksake,3,Tue Jun 9 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can equate Giles and Wesley, despite the similarities in their training and backgrounds. Wesley in BTVS was green and very trusting of the Council. I think he would have argued for killing Dawn as the most practical action. But the more mature Wesley of ATS was, paradoxically, more idealistic than his younger self and I think less likely to kill an innocent. Also, the older, wiser Wesley would be more likely to accept that, no matter her origin, Dawn was fully human and completely innocent. He would have defended her."
buffy,394svy,catdoctor,5,Tue Jun 9 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"dude do you remember how dark wesley gets in angel ? he keeps a human woman chained in a closet with a toilet bucket for months... i think wesley definitely would've sacrificed dawn to save the world, i mean really who wouldn't ? except for buffy, anyone would kill dawn, her life isn't worth the lives of billions of people.  edit: i definitely don't think wes becomes more idealistic, he becomes willing to do whatever needs to be done, for example working with WRH, something the scoobies find completely unconscionable, i don't think anyone in angel has the moral rigidity of the scoobies when it comes to saving the world."
buffy,394svy,faaackksake,2,Tue Jun 9 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"I think he would definitely get very close. Buffy would try and talk Wesley down, struggling with the idea of killing a human. But, Spike would do it. Spike would kill Wesley to spare Buffy having to do it."

The prophecy said nothing about what would happen once the father killed the son. The situation with Dawn was quite different. I feel that Wesley might have considered killing Dawn but would have rejected that option. Wesley was, even in his darkest hour, an idealistic protector of the innocent. He would have joined the Scoobies at the tower and fought like hell to keep Glory from opening the portal, at the cost of his own life if necessary."

In his darkest hour I have a feeling he would've let Illyria rip through everyone on its way back to the Deeper Well if it saved Fred, if he were making the choice instead of Angel and Spike.

Cordy tells Buffy about the exam because she knows that the nightmares are happening mostly in classes. Plus I know it's a bit of a double motive, but I like to think Cordelia is actually trying to help Buffy by telling her about the exam, not cruel.  2 Billy looks almost identical to Billy the kinda slayer in s9. Any theories to link the two characters? Maybe they could be one in the same? Or maybe the writers of s9 took inspiration from this episode. This happens in 1997, so 8 or 9 years later the events of season 9 are happening. 3 Willow's nightmare about going on stage happens again in the s4 final.  4 the way the Master holds himself during the cemetery scene looks a lot like Spike. 5 very abstract thought, but I think this is the only episode were a vampire holds a shovel.

He was very confused when I completely lost my shit and was a mess of snot and tears over ""Buffy"".  He was way behind on episodes and hadn't hit super feels yet. The depth in a show about a teenage vampire slayer and her teenage pal hijinks is astounding.  Joss is boss."
buffy,38weyf,pober,5,Sun Jun 7 17:42:11 2015 UTC,"This look captures everything about this episode so well for me. All the emotions of shock, helplessness, loss, confusion summed up in one expression. Quite good acting."
buffy,38weyf,ModerateBias,6,Sun Jun 7 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first 10 minutes were amazing. Gellars acting was out of this world. She seemed so completely helpless in the whole situation.."
buffy,38weyf,dilemmaemma15,5,Sun Jun 7 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"hug  i was warned about it, watched anyway.  it destroyed me (had lost my mother to cancer 3 months prior).   but it was cathartic, and is now my go to show even now, 7 years later, when feelings of sadness about losing her build up.   It lets me release the emotions, cry it out, and feel better when i am done.  I hate that episode with a passion... which is why its my favorite."
buffy,38weyf,oblivious247,4,Mon Jun 8 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"This is still the realist representation of death I've ever seen portrayed on television. Episode that will always, always make me cry."

buffy,38weyf,DaddyCatALSO,2,Tue Jun 9 11:43:43 2015 UTC,"If you really want a downer, watcher the commentary on that episode. I wrote a paper on Joss for a directing class in college, and that was one of the episodes I focused on- he had (and probably still has) his actors rehearse those long, long, long takes over and over again before filming them, so she had to go through that entire ten minute ordeal repeatedly for hours."

buffy,38wnb3,Beloit,3,Sun Jun 7 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't want it to be Willow's choice.  Let someone else do it.    Let Anya's ghost possess someone and write it in the book  Or Dawn going through her past emotions could do it.  I'm only skimming the comics, season 8 really turned me off them, but I heard that Dawn's emotions had reset to when she was originally created.  Sorry if I misunderstood them"
buffy,38wnb3,Beloit,2,Sun Jun 7 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"If you've only skimmed the comics I recommend actually reading them because it's shown not resurrecting Tara isn't just Willow's choice. Andrew almost resurrected her but when Willow explained why he shouldn't, he too agreed and didn't go through with it."
buffy,38wnb3,Beloit,2,Sun Jun 7 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"Then Giles and Fred shouldn't have been brought back either.  Willow is speaking as a trauma victim, in regards to resurrection, to magic regarding Tara' death  Frankly, I want a Tara who comes back and is extremely glad of it.  Hell, supposedly they were going to resurrect her in season 7"
buffy,38wnb3,DaddyCatALSO,7,Sun Jun 7 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"Willow is speaking as someone who is aware of the consequences of ripping someone out of heaven. Buffy experienced this first hand and to say she was happy with it couldn't be further from the truth.   Giles wasn't exactly thrilled to be brought back, either, to say the least; he was very angry at Angel for being obsessed with bringing back. He was grateful for being resurrected because it freed him from the Eyghon's torture, but he made it clear that if he were to die again he would want to stay dead.   And Fred wasn't resurrected by anyone as far as we know -- the combination of new Seed of Wonder and Illyria's status as an Old One somehow made Fred ""return"", albeit sharing a body with Illyria. As far as we know it wasn't anyone's conscious decision to bring her back, and the meaning and consequences of it still remain to be see."

She's so beneth her it's not even funny and on the top of that, Willow changed. There's no way she would still want Tara as a partner. Willow doesn't date people who aren't at least her equal. What else could Tara be if not Willow's love interest? What could she contribute? Nothing. Let it go."
buffy,38wnb3,Ahab17000,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but can't buy that. Tara's emotional centeredness is something none of the gang have gotten to yet."

He mentioned one day as an aside that his all-time favorite TV series was BTVS, specifically because of the writing and foreshadowing.  It felt like a vindication, in a way; I mean, out of all the excellent television out there, he picks Buffy.  Later in the semester, he even referenced the way the show re-imagined Frankenstein in Adam's character when discussing Mary Shelley's writing.  It was a great class."

I watched for the first time last year with lots and lots of spoilers from this sub and The AV club's reviews. It was still great but some things would have been exponentially better if I hadn't known they were coming.   Also, without giving any details, there is a spinoff starting at Buffy S4 that I'd highly recommend watching in tandem with Buffy both because there are occasional crossovers and because it's an amazing show in its own right, even if it takes a little bit to find its footing."

It starts up during Season 4 of Buffy and it's also on Netflix. There are various guides for what order to watch the episodes in but honestly I just pretty much ended up watching the whole season of one show followed by the corresponding season of the other show for the most part and I didn't feel like it was detrimental to my viewing experience."

This is humorously referenced a fair amount, the biggest example I can think of without giving any real spoilers is when a character references Buffy's class having the lowest mortality rate in Sunnydale High history. So even while there are so many deaths, it's nothing compared to pre-Buffy Sunnydale."

The differences in the story such as James saying that it took years to get over ""hating"" him, instead of being ""jealous"" of him for one year are probably the result of telling the story repeatedly over the years from memory. (This is a story he often recites when David is mentioned at Q & A's.)   He often uses this story as a springboard to praise David's work ethic on Angel.

Despite the fact that Joyce kicked Buffy out once in an emotional moment, you'd better believe she wouldn't have let a bunch of teenage girls force her daughter out of her own home.  Edit: Typo."
buffy,38eh34,IraninaGenius,57,Thu Jun 4 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I totally vehemently disagree with you... I just re-watched a few days ago and Empty Places was the apex of several storylines being developed throughout seasons 6 and 7.   The first is Buffy assuming the leader roll. During the first 4 seasons Giles was the leader of the group, he was the one giving commands even after Buffy break with the council. On season 5 we see Buffy assuming more of a leading role, culmination on season 6 with Giles ""abandoning"" her. On season 7, even Buffy not wanting it, this cleanly was a role that was bestowed upon, with people calling her general sometimes. This culminates on Empty Places where she admits to everybody and herself, she IS the leader, she IS the general. Second is the potentials roller coaster fear for their lives. The fear increases and decreases throughout the season, where every time they feel a little safer, something happens. And the First uses this to manipulate them several times, even making one of them kill herself. And they suffer their wost blow when they feel the safest and more competent when they go assault the vineyard. With the worst casualties since they arrived in Sunnydale. Their moral is in the trash. And this combines with a Buffy every day more detached from them. Third is Buffy detachment. This started on season 6, but at the start of season 7, herself and her friends had put all that behind. When she realizes this is a battle they will probably lose, and even if they win most of them will die, she protects herself by isolation herself. Also she grows closer to Spike, one of the few people likely to survive. Also her detachment is helpful when a commander has to send people to die in battle. But we have to look for the other perspective. From Dawn's perspective, with every girl that comes, Buffy care less and less for her, and the First uses this like a master. From Xander and Willow, she had stopped taking their input, and was just giving orders, they also see her being more erratic, and with Willow there's also the fear of losing Kennedy, if Buffy take ""another"" wrong decision. And Giles and Wood mistrust of Spike and their relationship. And finally Faith. Buffy was the de facto leader because she was the Slayer, with Faith on the picture Buffy needed to prove herself more to the group. For a external observer Faith is a better leader, she is more grounded, she appears to be stronger and she is more connected with the potentials. She's also dumber than Buffy so she's more easily manipulated and she wants to prove herself to everyone.   The group at that moment was being held together by Buffy's power only. When she willingly walks into a trap and gets her ass kicked big time and gets people killed, this broke the group apart... and her mistake (this in my opining was her only mistake on this whole situation) was not being able to regroup and raise moral, like she had done in Showtime, but she wanted to take this broken group and try a new assault (nonetheless being the right thing to do, would probably result in several deaths).  In the end, what Willow, Xander and Giles did is inexcusable in a moral stand point. But from a character development stand point, was what they had to do. This episode shows great character development, and great writing."
buffy,38eh34,TheDemonHauntedWorld,28,Wed Jun 3 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Plus, group mentality.   As someone who has had an entire group against her, I know that friends can suddenly change how they feel about you; a bad seed comes in (in this case The First) stirring up trouble. For me, six months later, (according to them) apparently none of those friends had ignored me and cut me out.   Cordellia would have stood up for Buffy though, I think. Her character (in buffy at least - I have not seen too much Angel) was of the leader of herself."
buffy,38eh34,elizabethraine,15,Wed Jun 3 21:52:34 2015 UTC,I understand everybody refusing to follow her plan but having the Scoobies throwing Buffy out of her own house and putting Faith in charge doesn't seem believable.  One thing doesn't necessarily escalate to the others.
buffy,38eh34,TheDemonHauntedWorld,10,Thu Jun 4 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"Buffy: ""[...] I can't stay here and watch her lead you into some disaster.""  Dawn: ""You can't stay here.[...] You were right, we have to be together on this.""   The whole situation was perfectly constructed so the group would put someone else in charge. Faith won the ""election"". And Buffy was not throw so they could put Faith in charge, but the other way around. Buffy would never let Faith lead, so she had to go. And the person who eventually ""threw"" Buffy was Dawn, also owner of the house."
buffy,38eh34,darth_unicorn,14,Thu Jun 4 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I have to jump in here, Dawn had zero authority. She didn't ""own"" the house at all, she was a child. She didn't make the decision to throw Buffy out, she was just the last one to see her leave (from what I remember). I've always hated that scene though, I don't think it made sense with what had happened leading up to it, the writers just wanted to make things even harder for Buffy."
buffy,38eh34,DaddyCatALSO,5,Thu Jun 4 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"Re-watch the episode... or at least that part.  But first, Dawn owns the house... As well as Buffy. Both did, each had 50%, that's what happens when the parents die, each child gets the same share, doesn't matter if she's a minor or not.  And she was the one to say to Buffy she couldn't stay in the house since she wasn't gonna accept Faith as the new leader. Look at the dialog posted before."
buffy,38eh34,360Saturn,5,Thu Jun 4 13:06:56 2015 UTC,"Yes she says it, but so what? Buffy is her legal guardian. Buffy could throw everyone else out of her house, but they don't get to throw her out. It always winds ne up when I watch that episode. Even if I suspend disbelief and say that Buffy went with it because she could see the value of the group as a unit and put that above her ownership of the house, etc etc,  I just could never buy all her friends and her own sister who she had saved all their lives countless times, kicking her out on the street. I didn't think they were written to be that stupid or cold or cruel."
buffy,38eh34,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"As DemonHauntedWorld said, Buffy pushed it."
buffy,38eh34,360Saturn,5,Thu Jun 4 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"But a lot of what they say to her is true.  Buffy does have terrible tactical skills. Her method is nearly always to not listen to Giles and to wing it relying entirely on her own skills and experience. That's just about acceptable when you're a lone fighter,  a free agent only looking after yourself. But when you're a team leader, and this method isn't working- in fact, your teammates have died on your watch because you didn't plan or assess the situation properly, and you still point-blank refuse to modify your approach, no, you aren't fit to lead . You need a time out.  Another thing people always seem to forget - including Buffy herself - is that the potentials have no powers. In that context, Buffy consistently leads into danger against foes stronger than herself who she herself struggles with, a bunch of scared young girls who are basically carbon copies of season 5 Dawn. Unpowered, unskilled, and only vaguely trained. And against an ultimate enemy whose power is to get into your head and create self-doubts.  And Buffy's speech about how the girl who killed herself was weak rather than a victim or not strong enough? Just wow. Way to endear yourself to the troops."

So in other words if the key was still in its shapeless form they would need a way to capture the energy or drain it from the ball of energy thingy. I could be wrong though I haven't seen season 5 in a while."

buffy,38ec5n,Sammyboy616,6,Sat Jun 6 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"Because once it was transformed into Dawn, any rituals to trigger the Key except for those designed to trigger it in the form of a large-ish living animal ceased to apply and there was no reason to mention them."
buffy,38ec5n,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jun 3 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"But if the key was NEVER any sort of animal, why would such a ritual exist? In fact, it's absolutely shocking to Glory and her minions that the key was even a person, it never crossed their mind. They thought it was an object..."
buffy,38ec5n,johnwatersfan,2,Thu Jun 4 12:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems very likely that rituals exist for any different disguise that the Key could be turned into."
buffy,38ec5n,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jun 4 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"Except in the past the key has always been a mystical ball of energy that was ONE TIME changed into a different form to hide it.   I think it was just a giant plot issue that the more I watch, the more it annoys me."
buffy,38ec5n,johnwatersfan,2,Thu Jun 4 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"Well, again, we don't know if it was ever disguise d before, just like we can't know if it was ever used before."
buffy,38ec5n,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jun 4 19:33:50 2015 UTC,I would guess that the process the monks used to bind the key into Dawn's form needs to be reversed somehow to gain access to the essence of the key.
buffy,38ec5n,evil_burrito,2,Wed Jun 3 18:03:30 2015 UTC,But it wasn't reversed; Glory & Doc simply performed a blood ritual on Dawn as Dawn.
buffy,38ec5n,DaddyCatALSO,3,Wed Jun 3 19:29:39 2015 UTC,I presumed that the end result of the blood ritual performed on Dawn was that the key went into action.  Monks perform ritual the result of which is Key -> Dawn. Some other ritual is required to achieve the desired result: Dawn -> Key.
buffy,38ec5n,evil_burrito,2,Wed Jun 3 20:00:55 2015 UTC,I only realised this during my latest watch through and it has bugged me ever since.
buffy,38ec5n,theperfectend,2,Thu Jun 4 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"The key becoming Dawn was a fundamental alteration of reality, perhaps the ritual in question was altered to require Dawn's blood as a result?"

buffy,38ed94,Grunzelbart,16,Wed Jun 3 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"You don't have to watch them together. The crossovers are neat to see, but not actually relevant to understanding the plots.  If you watch Buffy straight through, some details of Angel will be spoiled for you (like Cordelia working for him). These are also pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, and there are only a handful that I can think of.  However, if you're going to watch the series outside of airdate order, you must finish Buffy before you get to season 5 of Angel. I won't say any more."
buffy,38ed94,listen2,3,Wed Jun 3 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"Big thank you for clearing that up for me. Gonna do that then, watching Buffy completely was my original plan (not sure how it will progress towards the end but so far the quality has seemed steady to me), so maybe afterwards I'll crave some more and am gonna go for Angel, we'll see."
buffy,38ed94,pober,13,Wed Jun 3 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"If you didn't like Angel's character in Buffy, that's understandable. Just realise that you were seeing Angel from Buffy's perspective. Angel in his own show is much more interesting. It starts out slow, but definitely is worth watching if you are into the franchise.   As others have stated, it's important to finish Buffy first or watch them together in the airdate order as opposed to watching Angel first."
buffy,38ed94,pober,3,Wed Jun 3 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"It's not like i didn't like Angels character. He's a standup guy and all that. Some of my favourite moments from what I've seen were between him and Buffy actually. I just never was this big in on their relatioship. Well it kinda works and again, they had really great scenes, but it always kinda lacked chemistry for me, so i wasn't that sad to see him breakup or go (like for instance with Willow and Oz)"
buffy,38ed94,keeveralexander,3,Wed Jun 3 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply you didn't like Angel's character. It's just that that is a common complaint.   Personally, I kind of liked Angel as a character in Buffy, but I didn't know how strong of a show Angel could be with him as the main character. But the first episode took care of those doubts quite nicely."
buffy,38ed94,DaddyCatALSO,3,Wed Jun 3 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"There's a crossover list on the sidebar that'll help, but I would suggest watching a season at a time. The show's are tonally completely different but both absolutely worth watching. Angel is excellent, particularly in season 2 and 3 (in my opinion). I'm doing a watch right now and I'm using the crossover guide, but honestly if its your first time through I'd suggest alternating each season. So season 4 of Buffy/ Season 1 of Angel, Season 5 of Buffy/ Season 2 of Angel. For various reasons it's important to watch Buffy first because big things that happen are referenced in Angel sometimes whereas Buffy rarely references events in Angel.   The only arguable exception to this is season 4 of Angel, because that ends prior to the end of Buffy season 7. So I'd ultimately suggest Buffy 4, Angel 1, Buffy 5, Angel 2, Buffy 6, Angel 3, Angel 4, Buffy 7, Angel 5.  I didn't touch Angel at all until a couple of years after Buffy (I don't even know if I was aware of it tbh) and I can't believe what I missed out on. Not only does it have my favourite character in the whole buffyverse (not Angel), it develops the lore so much, and the stuff they deal with on Angel is just more mature and for me more enjoyable. To this day I still prefer Buffy as a show overall, but I think I definitely prefer Angel's subject matter and overarching stories (well... most of them >_>)"
buffy,38ed94,BlooregardQKazoo,2,Thu Jun 4 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"The small numbe r of actual crossovers are the only ones where it's even recommended to watch in order, and Buffy generally makes sense without it, and Angel makes a tiny bit less general sense."
buffy,38ed94,feminaprovita,2,Wed Jun 3 19:34:23 2015 UTC,i also watched all of Buffy before watching Angel. there would be little references to Buffy or Willow getting back from LA but the specifics were never important.

buffy,38attw,CJGibson,4,Wed Jun 3 08:37:32 2015 UTC,"Well, they're played by the same actress, but despite the ""William?"" I'm not convinced it's one character (and I don't regard commentary as authoritative; it says right on the disc it represents personal opinion.)  Halfrek mentions being active during the Crimean War, which was several decades before Spike was turned. So, if they were the same, it means Cecily wasn't real, only a disguise to reach a  wish-seeker. That isn't impossible, but it seemed  Cecily was well-known and had been around for a while, parents were known, William's falling in love with her, etc. From what we saw of Anyanka/Cordy & Halfrek/Dawn, Vengeance Demons are attracted by need, they don't camp out in one place waiting for someone to be wronged.  Side note: if Cecily was Halfrek in disguise, and something abd happened to William after speaking with her, it doesn't mean he was the object of some person's vengeance wish. I can't see William hurting anyone that much, especially considering Hallie specialized in wronged children. William was likely just around, and she'd've had a different target."
buffy,38attw,venom8599,4,Wed Jun 3 13:48:12 2015 UTC,"Ok so we know that Halfrek's thing is children whose parents aren't being so great to them.  And we also know that Spike's mom was kind of a bitch.  What if Halfrek was actually posing as Cecily to try to get William to wish for something, even though he's not actually a young child?  Only, like you said, he never actually wishes for anything, so she sticks around for a while kind of intentionally snubbing him and trying to get him angry so he'll wish for something."
buffy,38attw,DaddyCatALSO,9,Wed Jun 3 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"How was Spike's mom a bitch? William loved his mother, and she in return doted on him. He seemed very close to her. It was only after he turned her that she became anything close to a bitch. But then, as Spike realized, that wasn't his mother talking -- that was the demon he set loose when he sired her."

buffy,38attw,venom8599,0,Wed Jun 3 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"We know from Dopplegangland, that Vampires retain a lot of the personality of the people they were before they turned.  Spike's mom ""doted"" on him because she needed him to take care of her, but she wasn't a good person."
buffy,38attw,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed Jun 3 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can read too much into whether she was a good person or not just from that. I think his actual mother did want him to find someone and ""leave the nest"" so to speak. To not want that would've been a weird thing. So some of the things she said were probably her own thoughts.   But they were expressed through a lens of cruelty and deviance that just wasn't his mother. Similarly you can't just assume that because Dark Willow was into it that actual Willow wanted people in chains to ride like ponies. And despite what Angel says, Angellus is also quite distinct from what we see of his previous life as Liam, although obviously some aspects remain."
buffy,38attw,CJGibson,4,Wed Jun 3 16:26:20 2015 UTC,"I tend to think that a vampire personality manifests some very real but usually well-hidden darker parts of the person's human nature. So all that's in their minds but not necessarily what they secretly *want * to do(c'mon, we've all got stuf f like that, right?). In Harmony's case, her worst side wa s already on view as a human, so no real change except for physically killing people."
buffy,38attw,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Jun 3 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"Also, keep in mind, that Anya often takes small or imagined slights against women, or even normal every day breakups, as an excuse to exact vengeance.  Spike's mom wouldn't have to be Mommie Dearest in order to potentially get Halfrek's attention, it could be based on very tiny things."
buffy,38attw,AngelAmongUs,3,Wed Jun 3 19:07:16 2015 UTC,"But they were expressed through a lens of cruelty and deviance that just wasn't his mother. Similarly you can't just assume that because Dark Willow was into it that actual Willow wanted people in chains to ride like ponies.    Vamp!Willow had a long time to develop in an alternate reality where things like this were not only possible but happened all the time.  Just as with Angel, I don't think you could say that this ""just wasn't her."" What a vampire version shows is how bad someone can be, I think - it removes any guilt or remorse, any obligation to follow social niceties, gives them power and bloodlust, and allows them to give full rein to their inner cruelty.  It is no accident that Willow in s6 becomes similar to her alternate self in ""The Wish"" in mannerisms, language, and actions.  Edit:  About Spike's mother specifically -  I think she legitimately did think those things about her son. They were possibly exaggerated, to wound him further, but if she were really and truly affectionate towards him and loved him, that would not have been her reaction.  One's preferences and affections towards people, if strong enough, often survive into ""vampire-hood."" Harmony still considers herself friends with Cordelia; Alonna is still caring and affectionate towards Gunn, and Spike still cares about his mother after being turned into a vampire.   ANNE: I hate to be cruel - (stops/realizing) No. I used to hate to be cruel. In life. Now I find it quite freeing. Nothing less will pry your greedy little fingers from my apron strings, will it?   Without her illness and her soul to restrain her, she is able to say what she actually feels. About her son, about his poetry.  It is similar, to me, to the temporary release from ""soulfulness"" Angel experiences in ""Eternity,"" and the way he is able to be honest about how he feels about Cordelia's acting in that state. After which he says:   Angel: But I really didn’t mean...  Cordy: Oh, yes, you did. And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t try to weasel out of it. (Gets up)  Angelus may not be the most relaxing company, but at least he’s honest. Shouldn’t I expect the same from the not-evil version of my friends?   It seems to me that in most cases (I'm actually having trouble thinking of a counter-example) vampirism causes someone to behave more honestly than they might as human."

It is pretty clear that Angel is lying in ""Doppelgangland"".    BUFFY: Just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do with the person it was.  ANGEL: Well, actually -- (off Buffy's glare) -- that's a good point.   The only question is if it was only for Willow's benefit. Angel tends to keep things to himself and revealing just how much he has in common with his soulless state would elevate him in no one's eyes.   Angel ""The Prodigal""  What we think of as ""Angelus"" had a long time to develop under the influence of Darla.   DARLA: This contest is ended, is it?  INT. IRISH HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT (1753)  (Darla enters. Angel sits amongst the aftermath. The entire family is here: Angel's dead Father, his Mother and again the dead little sister.)  ANGEL: Now I've won.  DARLA: Are you sure?  (He looks at her -- what's that supposed to mean?)  ANGEL: Of course -- I've proved who had the power here.  (Darla takes in the sight of the massacre.)  DARLA: You think?  ANGEL: What?  DARLA: Your victory over him took but moments --  ANGEL: Yes.  DARLA: But his defeat of you will last lifetimes.  ANGEL: What are you talking about? He can't defeat me now.  (She regards Angel's Father's dead body.)  DARLA: Nor can he ever approve of you -- in this world or any other.  (Angel looks at the bodies, takes that in.)  DARLA: What we once were informs all that we have become. The same love will infect our hearts -- even if they no longer beat. Simple death won't  change that.  ANGEL: Love? Is this the work of love?  (She moves close to him, reaches out tenderly, strokes his face. Not so much condescending as understanding. Not sentimentally, but admiringly.)  DARLA: Darling boy. So young. Still so very young...  (Off Darla gazing with gentle humor at her creation and Angel looking back, trying to process her words...)"
buffy,38attw,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"And despite what Angel says, Angellus is also quite distinct from what we see of his previous life as Liam, although obviously some aspects remain.   It is pretty clear that Angel is lying in ""Doppelgangland"".   The only question is if it was only for Willow's benefit. Angel tends to keep things to himself and revealing just how much he has in common with his soulless state would elevate him in no one's eyes.    Yes, I'm aware Angel decided to lie there, but I meant despite what he was originally going to say before the glare from Buffy, since the change to the lie was pretty obvious. Because its quite obvious that many parts of a vampire's personality are the same.  But I suppose the larger point I was making is that I don't think a vampire's actions and words are enough to judge the previous person as good or bad even if those thoughts  were rattling around in their head somewhere. Because the best part of the person is gone in a vampire. The soul replaced with an actual demon. (e.g. comic spoilers)"

She isn't a nerd & has never been around ""nerds"" (she is one of the most sheltered people I have ever met).  I never wanted to meet him. I figured we would be shoved through the line, people would be rude, & it would ruin my idea of Buffy. But, we made it a weekend & I went even though I was a nervous wreck.   We had James laughing in seconds, the Mutt and Jeff duo that we are. He remembered us when we went to the photo op & I was shocked. I can't imagine remembering all those people.   I went to a Q&A later & saw him get visibly upset over a similar question. The Sunday of the con, the floor was empty (the weather was bad). We were from out of town and my stinker of a BF had ditched me to go buy her then boyfriend a present. I was sitting by a column reading next to the row of booths with nothing to do.  I looked up and he motioned for me to come over (he must have been as bored as I was, no one was in his line). We talked for a while, he remembered us from the day before & asked me where my other nurse was, the blonde one. I am so glad I met him, he really was sweet. http://i.imgur.com/RIdeIFR.jpg"

And he went to hell just so he could get his soul back... because he hurt the woman he loved. He's much more awesome than Angel. Angel's soul is a curse, Spike's a reward.

I don't root for him and I wasn't sad when something bad happened to him. He didn't have a soul and therefore I don't think Spike truly loved Buffy until he had one. Obsessed yes, but I think love came later. As I stated before, when Spike tried to rape Buffy, he was done in my mind. I will never excuse that. Ever. I have a bad habit of not letting things go (I'm working on it). But James saying this...I think it helped me move on a bit."

buffy,3880wl,catdoctor,2,Tue Jun 2 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"Well, through season 6 they explore a lot of abuse and sex. It would have been interesting to see a female character use sex to try to hold on to a male and continue a relationship after it has ended (just like the writer's personal experience). None of the women's situation at the time really fit into that, but I would have liked to see how they'd show it. It is a very real thing that happens, and showing the wrongness of it would've been nice.  Willow after Oz would have fit. Anya doesn't really work unless Xander leaves her earlier and not at the altar. I can't see Buffy ever doing something like that, nor Tara."

James is known as a Method actor, so he really feels what his character feels. I can only imagine how much it tore him up inside to play that scene. I though he was tremendous as Spike. The writers kept changing their minds about what they wanted Spike to be, and each time James rose to the occasion, without ever letting go of the core that was essentially Spike.

buffy,3880wl,sarah_bellum75,17,Tue Jun 2 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, I feel there's an underlying tone of misogyny to your comments.   If you have a reaction of justice or fairness when watching a woman get sexually manipulated, that seems to betray an underlying personal issue.  The way you say ""for once"" women are being sexually manipulated seems to indicate that you feel that women in general are sexually manipulative and men in general aren't. Even if you had worded it such that you felt a sense of fairness because you feel like Buffy was sexually manipulating Spike and so it was fair that he reciprocated, a more appropriate reaction is still empathy for both of them regarding the times they have been wronged and disappointment in both of them for the times when they have wronged the other. The idea that it's fair or just for her to be manipulated in return seems very eye-for-an-eye.   You say women aren't at fault for men's horniness but then you immediately turn around and say, ""but women are always doing themselves up"" and implicitly accuse them of being at fault for men being horny. You say that when you ask women why they do themselves up you get the response that they are doing it for themselves. Women aren't one homogenous group with unified desires. Some women may be doing it for sexual attention and some may be doing it for themselves. And, even if a woman is making herself fancy to appeal to men, it doesn't mean that they are dressing for every man out there. Dressing nice and putting on make up isn't a blanket invitation for men to make advances. I'm a gay male and I see men I want to have sex with on a daily basis. When a guy wears a suit that makes his ass pop, are the only two options that he is either dressing for me or dressing for himself? For that matter, would I be in any way justified in walking up to them and asking them why they dressed that way? If I'm sexually frustrated, would I be in any way justified in thinking, ""it's not the fault of men in general that I'm horny, but they certainly go out of their way to make themselves look sexy for me""?  You explicitly state that men are in a constant state of horniness which, besides reducing all men into one unified concept of sex-machine, implies that women aren't also walking around with sexual desire on a day to day basis, constantly seeing attractive people of the sex they're interested in. Women suffer from sexual frustration as well.   Now, this isn't a hard and fast rule, but when a presenter feels a need to preemptively defend their ideas as not bigoted, the idea is generally at least somewhat bigoted."

buffy,3880wl,BadEgo,-8,Wed Jun 3 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"yes it is an underlying personal issue... just like many of the men who are sexually manipulated on the daily  are you implying that anyone with a personal gripe in an issue cant argue within that issue or make a legitimate statement about it?  ""doing themselves up"" is not implicitly accusing them of being at fault. its a context to the question when i ask why they do this and an introduction to the general answer i get.  can women not be at fault for mens horniness but still be the cause of it?... i think so. and thats what i said.  also, when we say ""men"" and ""women"" i already assume we are generalizing for arguments sake. clearly no one believes everyone is the same. bringing that up is a distraction to the actual conversation. semantic smokescreen.   Dressing nice and putting on make up isn't a blanket invitation for men to make advances.    never said that. as a matter of fact i said the opposite. i explicitly said its not their fault  i never walked up to a random woman... all the women i ask are acquaintances at least and none of them were ever offended by my question, just defensive. which says a lot.  i would like the exact quote that you are referring to when i said ""men are in a constant state of horniness""  that last statement you made violates the same rule it claims to be proclaiming. preemptive bigotry of a statement that is bigotry based on preemption alone is the same thing.... bigotry  ""constant state of torture"" was exaggeration that i regret given how far you are taking this whole thing.  im being compared to warren... like this is out of hand. all you guys can see is the hatred... seems like your looking for it more than im spouting it.. because every time i read one of your comments i feel like your not even talking to me. i cant see why men arent allowed to be oppressed by their own nature and the way society has conditioned women and men to behave. why is this even a controversy?"
buffy,3880wl,BadEgo,12,Tue Jun 2 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Well, your personal gripe seems to be, ""I've been sexually manipulated by a woman/women, so women in general are sexually manipulative,"" which takes away from the already tenuous legitimacy of the claims that women are sexually manipulative. People with a personal gripe can discuss a related macro-issue, but if the personal-level gripe starts to taint the argument about the overarching issue being discussed, it can seriously take away from the argument. And that's not even getting into the implication that men aren't generally sexually manipulative and that this instance is an exception to the rule as put forward by saying it feels fair because ""for once"" women are being manipulated.   You do explicitly state it is not the fault of women but you turn around and immediately imply it is their fault. You may disagree that the implication is there, but personally, it's there clear as day in my mind and it seems like other readers are getting the same idea based on the backlash. Sometimes tone and word choice can put forward messages that the speaker isn't explicitly stating. What the listener hears is often just as important as what the speaker actually says in communication. It's the same as how an artist can make a painting that means one thing and the audience can see it and feel that it means the exact opposite.   The idea that women are defensive when you ask them about why they dress the way they dress does say a lot. To me it says we live in a society where men feel justified in looking for a motive or agenda in one of the most basic aspects of day to day life, getting dressed, and that they feel justified in asking women what that motive/agenda is. This isn't something we men have to deal with so it's hard to put oneself in that position and get a good idea of what toll that would take on you (universal you, not you personally). I wasn't present for the conversations you've had on the matter so I'm not really in a place to judge but I know I don't really like people questioning or judging my appearance. Assuming I'm not currently representing someone else or an organization, it's nobody else's business how I dress.   The torture comment was what I was referring to with my quote about a constant state of horniness. You take that back, so fine, it's off the table, I won't argue it anymore.   Maybe my comment about needing to preemptively defend against accusations of bigotry is bigoted. I'm certainly capable of bias and appreciate being called out when I present those biases.   I don't think you're a warren. That's someone else who made that attack and it may or may not be justified. I don't know you and don't really have any thoughts on your character beyond feeling that this particular opinion of yours is bigoted. But, if you don't feel I'm talking to you, I'm sorry and I don't know how to change that. I'm breaking down your various points and addressing them one by one, so I don't really know what more I can do to make you feel that I'm talking to you rather than at you.   The controversy, to me, is not that you're arguing men have X issue, it's the implicit tone of why it's women's fault. You keep saying that you aren't arguing that it is women's fault, but it sure feels that way to me even if you don't come out and say it."
buffy,3880wl,BadEgo,-2,Tue Jun 2 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"i know you didnt call me warren but the emotional response to my entire point seems very similar. i think warren is a horrible person and so is spike pretty much all the way to the end even though he loves buffy it doesnt matter... even him giving his life was arguably not enough.  im mostly on their side every time anyone makes an argument and i try to explain that i didnt come from that place and its upsetting that everyone cant get over themselves and see underlying suffering of men on a daily basis. feminism is great and it needs to exist, but we cant let it ruin other people rights to have emotional social safe-guards in society and it cant prevent men from explaining that not only do their feelings matter, but they are a lot more serious than most women take them.  thank god every man doesnt go through this... and that its just a majority, because it fucking sucks having zero power from puberty to death over sexuality when we are virtually at the whim of any attractive woman's sexual needs."
buffy,3880wl,theoremofgoats,-4,Tue Jun 2 20:58:30 2015 UTC,also again... i explicitly said theres a difference between being the cause and being at fault
buffy,3880wl,keeveralexander,7,Tue Jun 2 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"And again, what you explicitly say and the message that comes across to the reader are not always one and the same. What is explicitly said is not the only part of communication. Take, for instance, someone who beats up a gay person but explains that they love everyone and homosexuality is sinful and they are just trying to help someone get right in the eyes of God because they love them. What they are explicitly saying is a message of love even when it's clear that's not the case. Granted, this is an especially extreme example, but I'm just trying to make the point that what is explicitly said is not the totality of communication.   Now, in your other response, above, you narrow down your argument and the crux of the matter seems to me to be that you feel society is over saturated with sexual enticement and that is causing suffering because it breeds sexual frustration. I don't necessarily have an issue with that. I think one could certainly make an argument that that's the case. I do however take issue with the underlying idea that it's specifically an issue for men. If you were simply only talking about it as it relates to men, even then I wouldn't have an issue but there's a constant underlying tone that women don't experience sexual frustration and men experience it on the level of an epidemic. This reduces men to sexual beings who are ruled by their libido and women to sexual objects without libido's who use men's libidos against them.   Now, I don't want to go too far into quit-complaining-cause-there-are-starving-kids-in-impoverished-countries territory, but I really think you should reflect on your own culpability in whatever sexual frustration you're feeling. If you want to get off, the means are there. I may have posted that gif humorously, but seriously, just masturbate. If that's not enough, post on Craigslist for a hook up. Or use tinder or whatever straight people are doing these days. If someone is sexually frustrated, I think that is more their issue than society's. You say, and this is a direct quote:   problem for me personally is that i dont want to do anything like [masturbation] in the morning until i go out and get aroused by an ass in yoga pants... which btw is everywhere now...    That is not a societal ill. That is not oppression. That is horniness and laziness rolled together into an entitlement ball."
buffy,3880wl,Legen_unfiltered,-5,Tue Jun 2 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"i dont think its only for men, i think that only MENS issues to this respect get ignored. womens sexual problems are always dealt with with reverence and complete compliance.. men get no such thing from society when it comes to their feelings  also the last part you quoted me in saying... you are implying that the only reason im not maturbating is that im lazy which is absurd im just not in the mood and then, without my ability to stop it seeing them in yoga pants puts me in the mood, also im not saying they shouldnt wear them and i didnt say anything close to that so idk why ur saying ""entitlement"" thats absurd. i just want it to be recognized and acknowledged the way womens sexual issues are.  also you should read some of the horrible things women and men are saying to me that have no bearing on the conversation simply because i think that mens sexual overcomings are not taken seriously while womens are taken seriously to a much greater degree  also, i talk about many issues all the time, this just happens to be one of them. also, anyone who wants to talk about this issue with me is equally guilty of wasting time on it.  i have complete control over my actions and have gone out of my way like im supposed to as a human being to pursue but not push women into being with me. also i keep my ""perverted"" tendencies to myself... what i dont see is much reciprocation from women in any sense when it comes to any complaint or gripe with women men may have.  men are constantly shamed for being very much biologically invested in their sexuality and its atrocious the treatment we get in many situations"
buffy,3880wl,DaddyCatALSO,12,Tue Jun 2 22:25:55 2015 UTC,What the fuck are you for real? As a guy I can tell you most other guys I know don't think this way.
buffy,3880wl,cfairbanks,-10,Tue Jun 2 20:03:06 2015 UTC,you are in the minority sir. theres a billion dollar advertising industry that stay in business by manipulating the desires of men and the main one is sex. google how often the average male thinks about sex. i love downvotes btw can i them all please?
buffy,3880wl,cfairbanks,8,Tue Jun 2 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"Rape is about power. It has nothing to do with sex. Spike's attempted rape of Buffy was because he felt powerless, he couldn't make her love him. To compare that to sexual frustration unnerves me at best."
buffy,3880wl,keeveralexander,-3,Tue Jun 2 19:42:25 2015 UTC,i thought we were talking about them having sex above the bronze? that wasnt rape.
buffy,38654k,lecherous_hump,39,Tue Jun 2 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"Good luck, Nick. Thoughts are with you."
buffy,38654k,beer_me_twice,34,Tue Jun 2 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Sad to hear. I'm touched by all the support he is receiving, though. This reply, for example."

It's a disease you have to manage for the rest of your life.

He has plenty of people around him personally but I feel like the internet and hollywood paints the public as being very hateful and mean. But i know that Buffy fans are different and so does he...   so lets remind him"
buffy,38654k,doyle871,3,Tue Jun 2 20:30:55 2015 UTC,Good for him takes courage to know when you need help. Hope he comes out stronger than ever.
buffy,38654k,Mcmacladdie,3,Wed Jun 3 16:53:16 2015 UTC,I sent him an email with some words of encouragement.  I really do hope he's able to work through this.  I wish him nothing but the best of luck.
buffy,3854be,squallosu,20,Mon Jun 1 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, if Willow could have somehow fixed the Buffy Bot, she could have sent it to work at the Doublemeat palace in her place. Free income!"
buffy,3854be,l0stcontinent,23,Mon Jun 1 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"Or like if Willow could have gotten a job when Buffy's mum was sick, or when she and Tara moved in when Buff died and neglected all the bills lol, Buffy wouldn't have to be working instead of focusing on being the Slayer/big-sister-turned-mother-figure."

buffy,3854be,_shazbot_,16,Tue Jun 2 19:23:05 2015 UTC,If Willow has the expertise to repair and maintain a somewhat convincing human-like robot she could have been pulling down a huge salary doing part-time consulting.  Enough to keep Buffy in fresh stakes and copper pipes for decades.

buffy,3854be,CandiedDreams,6,Tue Jun 2 23:26:22 2015 UTC,Willow was out of commission when Buffy started working.  She could have fixed it earlier in the season but probably figured they didn't need it since they had real Buffy back.

buffy,37zfdg,catdoctor,2,Tue Jun 2 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"I was just so shocked. I knew there was a 6th season, but I think I assumed that 6 & 7 would take place in an alternate dimension (like in The Wish) and that didn't comfort me at all, lol. But then she came back and I then became really sad that she was ripped out of heaven to once again be thrown into her duties and this world that had been nothing but cold and harsh.   Buffy, as a series, used my emotions as a punching bag."
buffy,37zfdg,placebo_burritos,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"And this is why we love the series so much. I especially love Season 6. Until then I liked Buffy, but I was not attached to her. It was watching her struggle after she was pulled out of Heaven that really made me love and admire her. The scene where she and Spike first meet after her resurrection is so heartbreaking: how she quickly buttons her shirt. How she tries to hide the wounds on her hands.  His look of utter disbelief and joy quickly followed by his quietly horrified recognition of how those wounds happened, and the tender way he takes her hands nurse them. The scene where Buffy ""thanks"" Willow and the others for bringing her back. How strong she is when she tells them exactly what they want to hear! She is being the Buffy they expect, but there is no one there for her. Later on, when she tells Spike about being in Heaven. Man! Other writers would not have been so subtle. Other actors might have raged or wailed. Not SMG. She was quiet and straightforward in her delivery, and the quietness simply underscored how hard Buffy was working to keep it all together. Another scene that is a total gem is this one.  I can barely write about it. And, even though this scene is about Spike, there is something in Buffy's eyes. Like she's thinking that he should have saved her, but it's useless, because no one can."
buffy,37zfdg,catdoctor,2,Wed Jun 3 01:20:49 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wonder if The Body is easier or harder on people who don't have a great relationship with their parents.
buffy,37zfdg,CJGibson,2,Mon Jun 1 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'd think it would depend on how empathetic you are with Buffy. Having a good relationship with your parents could help with empathy, but I don't think it's necessary. Some people naturally connect with characters on-screen."
buffy,37zfdg,pober,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:57:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I know for a fact having to deal with that level of grief certainly changes the impact of the episode, however. The first time it aired I hadn't, so it was just trying to empathize with Buffy. After my mother died, and I had been through that whole experience, the episode is like a perfect monument to that raw fresh grief."

They said she hadda have a last name for her so I chose Lehane 'cause I wanted something southie   Alex Jurkat of Eden Studios said this:   Yep, Faith's last name (and Kendra's) were devised for a roleplaying game .. . actually two roleplaying games--the Buffy the Vampire Slayer roleplaying game (btvsrpg.com) and the Angel roleplaying game (angelrpg.com). [...] In any event, we had created surnames for both Slayer and were prepared to go that route but decided to see if we could get a definite ruling from the PTB on the issue. Lo and behold, Joss spoke (and quickly we might add).    It has since been used in the canonical comics like Buffy s8 and Angel & Faith."

buffy,37yigl,Buffy_Bot,8,Sun May 31 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"This is one of the more memorable episodes of season 1 I think. Season 1 is basically hokey monster central but at least the ""monsters"" in this episode add to the universe. Having Sid and the Demon hunter mythos really grows the world. (Where as creatures like Miss French as the mantis lady do not.) This is something that I'm noticing as I watch through the show with my roomie again. Season 1- The slayer's universe is just the scoobie gang. Season 2- We expand the craziness to more of the school. (Go Fish, I Only Have Eyes For You, What's My Line, etc.) Season 3 - The city government is involved and the Slayer thing is more city wide. Season 5 - We get more global with the knights and Glory. Until we end in Season 7 - Where EVERY slayer is awoken on a global scale. I feel this episode is the first hint at there is more out there than what's under the library."

buffy,37yigl,ModerateBias,5,Mon Jun 1 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"I have a tortured history with this, my least favourite episode.  It happens to be the first Buffy episode I ever saw, catching it on TV sometime in the late '90s/early '00s. I thought it was terrible and figured that would be my only experience of the show.  Years later, I saw Firefly and decided I like Joss Whedon and should give Buffy a chance. I went through season 1 and when I hit this episode it almost convinced me to give up on the show. I only managed to continue a little way into season 2 before giving up.  Years passed and I happen now to be living with a housemate who is a Buffy obsessive. She convinced me to give the show another go, so I began watching from the start again. When I hit this episode, it was just as bad as I remembered and I had to relegate it to background noise. I'm happy to say I've soldiered on and when I hit season 3 the show clicked for me. I'm now deep into season 5 (and season 2 of Angel) and adore everything.  Why do I dislike this episode so much? It's hard to say exactly. I guess it fully symbolises the terrible monster-of-the-week format which I have never been a fan of, but it somehow manages to throw in all the worst ways of doing it. The ventriloquist dummy is a hateful invention and that probably has something to do with it, but he's brought to life (pun intended) in a cliché-ridden mess."
buffy,37yigl,LeftHandedGuitarist,3,Mon Jun 1 10:24:15 2015 UTC,It took you until Season 3? You are a hard sell! Most people are hooked half way trhough Season 2.
buffy,37yigl,catdoctor,3,Mon Jun 1 14:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, seasons 1 and 2 were both difficult for me to get through. I could see the improvements season 2 made but the show still felt cheesy and cheap. If I had watched it when originally broadcast that wouldn't have mattered too much, but coming off shows like True Detective, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Outlander, The Americans... it was an adjustment!  Season 3 of Buffy upped the game in every way, and the show became fully about the characters rather than about the situations (not that it hadn't done so before this, but it managed to make it really work here). Once I reached that point I was staying up late watching 6 episodes in a row."
buffy,37yigl,LeftHandedGuitarist,3,Mon Jun 1 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"Season 6 is my favorite, but seems to rank rather low with the rest of the fandom. I like how dark it gets, how hard it is for Buffy, how twisted the relationships become."

buffy,37yigl,The_Ripper42,4,Sun May 31 14:02:46 2015 UTC,Pretty much the only part I like of this episode is when the gang are making fun of Giles for having to run talent show and Snyder then forces them to perform. The amusement on Giles' face.
buffy,37yigl,theperfectend,4,Sun May 31 17:38:25 2015 UTC,While not one of the strongest episodes I think this is one of the better examples of a good misdirect around who the bad guy is. The writers had already done this in The Witch but I think in that case it was more predictable. Though the best use of this trope might be Earshot.
buffy,37yigl,Enzown,3,Mon Jun 1 02:12:01 2015 UTC,Sid is a film noir character making this a first try of the concept that was later developed in the first season of Angel.

buffy,37yigl,danielle_kb,2,Sun May 31 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"weekly episode notes   1 do we ever see the auditorium again after this episode?  2 it's adorable that the talent show is the scoobys biggest problem.  3  Willow says she plays the piano. I can't think of any time after that it being mentioned.  4  principal Snyder says touchy feely is what leads to being eaten. Oh that's not the only way. 5 Giles states ""a demon is a creature of evil, pure and simple"". I'll make a self post at some point about this. Every season after this conflicts with that statement. From demon bars to night clubs, demons seem more like humans with misunderstood needs. 6 ""There are things I will not tolerate: students loitering on campus after school, horrible murders with hearts being removed. and also smoking"" is delivered perfectly.  7 On this watch I really noticed how much the magician shows up.  8 So what happened to the demons corpse? I think it's episode 9 when the scoobys actually say ""what do we do with the corpse?""  9 the last scenes are the best part of the episode."
buffy,37yigl,buffanater,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:30:42 2015 UTC,"I never buy the moments when Buffy accidentally starts talking about vampires. She did in Welcome to the Hellmouth with vamp-asbestos   Buffy used to be a popular valley girl. I feel like she should be less worried about the talent show.   Snyder is fantastic. I wonder if he knows anything about Buffy seeing as he's working for the Mayor.   Why would Morgan join the talent show using a possessed dummy? I guess he needed an excuse to carry it around. He's also really bad at hiding the secret.    Is something wrong? Some girl in the talent show just got murdered would probably be a good excuse I love how the slayer still goes to her mom when she is scared at night  Shouldn't the police be working on this if it's a human case  ""I wouldn't figure you for a demon hunter"" says the dummy  Some great twists and turns but I would've like a little build up to who was demon"

I don't know what happened to me as a child but if it's not a Sesame Street character, I am literally grossed out and often nauseated by the sight of a puppet. The Angel puppet episode was more tolerable due to the type of puppet, but not by much."
buffy,37xpx3,NickIsYams,7,Sun May 31 14:36:15 2015 UTC,"I actually like it for that reason - for a change, the dummy was the good guy, which made it less creepy than, say, the Twilight Zone ventriloquist dummy episode. That said, I skip season 1 altogether anyway."

There are a lot of people who seem to appreciate that the actor was famous and really well respected and then he passed away so it's like a nostalgia trip for some people but... I live in the UK and have no idea who the guy was so all I know about him is ""Ted"" and he's like a functional embodiment of everything misogynistic and bad XD. It's hard to watch."
buffy,37xpx3,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sun May 31 19:58:23 2015 UTC,That's kind of the point of the episode though.  Anyone who would act like Ted couldn't be a human.

buffy,37xpx3,thrillhouse13,2,Sun May 31 15:33:06 2015 UTC,Becoming Part 2 - I did it last night. The feels. It brings me back to being the seventh grade boy who experienced his heart break through this episode.  Anything with Riley - C'mon he's perfect you don't deserver him Buffy. It just makes me mad.  Season 5 - Because Dawn. People say you get used to her. I never did and I never liked her. I wish they would have just killed her off after Season 5.  The Series Finale - Because its over.
buffy,37xpx3,pepper_pot,3,Sun May 31 14:23:41 2015 UTC,I'm rewatching the series for the bajillioth time. I'm so torn. I hate Dawn so season five just makes me rage. But I love spike in season five.

I feel like he could have fulfilled the same role as a guest star in season 5, regular in season 6 and guest star in season 7 again. I just disliked that he was considered such a big part of the show when they had to keep finding reasons to keep him relevant, meanwhile Tara who seemed to kind of just naturally be there was relegated to guest-star status until seeing red. It kinda sucked."

buffy,37xpx3,Johnderate,2,Tue Jun 2 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"Then Amber did her job properly :P. Tara is supposed to be an awkward character until she (off-screen, quietly) finds a bit of inner confidence in Season 6."
buffy,37xjy1,hollykatz,10,Sun May 31 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"Some of the emotion will come across for sure but definitely not the same reaction.  For instance, the Anya speech, which we all know, kind of only reaches that level of impact because of all the time we've known her to be incapable of sympathy. It works so well because it's the first time we've seen her show that kind of emotion. I don't think something like that would hit that hard to a new viewer.  The same goes for a lot of things in this episode which are different from the norm. The absence of music in what is usually a very operatic show. The strange use of cinematography and editing to focus on banality (e.g Watching the paper towel soak up the vomit, prolonged extreme close up of the phone), on a series that is usually more snappy and quick. I think that part of why The Body has such an impact is because techniques like these are so different from the usual episodes, and so it really stands out as  discomforting. Again, without prior knowledge of the series, the impact wouldn't be quite as big.  That being said, I think there is a lot that could still be appreciated. Certainly by somebody who could relate to the experience. It just would never hit them quite as hard as it hit us. We love these characters so it's going to be harder for us to watch them grieve."
buffy,37xjy1,rywon,2,Mon Jun 1 11:19:20 2015 UTC,I forgot about the Anya speech. Crap. We are getting close to that episode and her speech rips my heart out every time.
buffy,37xjy1,aofb031985,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"For me, it was just a character defining moment. It showed how vulnerable and lost she really was as a human having to live with mortal issues. The last line of that speech where I choked up."
buffy,37xjy1,insomniaholic,6,Tue Jun 2 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"The Body was the first episode of Buffy I ever watched. I didn't cry, but I recognized it as powerful and interesting and it caused me to reexamine my preconceived notions of what type of show Buffy the Vampire Slayer was. I continued watching from that episode on and when I looped back around through to season 1 and all the way back to The Body, this time I cried and it affected me much more emotionally.  So the same emotional reaction, highly doubtful, but an appreciation of a powerful, well-crafted episode, yeah."
buffy,37xjy1,AngryWizard,3,Mon Jun 1 13:28:39 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. Part of the reason the show has such an impact is becasue we know Buffy and her friends. We know how strong and awesome Buffy is, and we are watching her be completely helpless.  We know that Giles often comes in to save the day, but here he cannot. We know that Anya never sweats anything (except bunnies) but now she is lost. We know that Willow is a powerful witch who has faced down a god, but today she can't even decide what shirt to wear. Without knowing the characters, the show is about the mourning of a bunch of strangers."
buffy,37xjy1,catdoctor,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yes! It's like the whole show has built them to be so strong as individuals who can literally beat anything together, but this episode just tears that down. It's very raw. It reminds you that they're still just regular people."
buffy,37xjy1,insomniaholic,3,Tue Jun 2 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Having just watched 'The Body' for the first time yesterday (and been an emotional wreck because of it) I was pondering a similar question. I honestly think that, no, anybody coming to it without context would find it a somewhat boring episode outside of a couple of scenes.  This is mostly because the entire episodes revolves around characters reacting, not acting. It works for someone familiar with the show because we see the culmination of 5 years worth of character development laid bare, as people we love watching (and who are usually very strong) deal with the worst kind of emotional trauma."
buffy,37xjy1,LeftHandedGuitarist,3,Mon Jun 1 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"It would be like watching the end of a film that was famous for having a really sad ending, but without watching the preceding 2 hours.  You'd get the idea, but you wouldn't be invested or knowledgeable or invested enough to car.  Probably."
buffy,37xjy1,Sammyboy616,2,Mon Jun 1 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"I think maybe if they lost someone they loved or had a similar experience, especially if it happened recently but I think the reaction would be strongest if they knew the characters. You might put them into a depression/coma if they both knew the characters and recently lost someone."
buffy,37xjy1,Shark_Lover1,2,Mon Jun 1 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure. Her death had been spoiled for me before my first watch, and despite my great love of the characters, it's never resonated with me in the strong way it has with so many others (heresy, I know). So at first glance, I think not.  But on the other hand... Perhaps if you're careful not to build it up as the best ever, but just let it be, with brief introduction/backstory as needed, your non-Buffy-watching friend may appreciate it to some degree, but I strongly caution against overselling it (not least because I wish I loved it like everyone else does, and hate that I found it disappointing compare to its hype)."
buffy,37xjy1,feminaprovita,2,Mon Jun 1 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"Depends more on lif3e circumstances, a s other posters have said. Even for long time fans, that's the real determinant.

They share a mythology, but not a tone; when I've tried watching concurrently I find the antics of Buffy and crew come off as immature."
buffy,37wg4j,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun May 31 03:34:41 2015 UTC,"watch all of Buffy then all of Angel   This is my preferred method of watching them as well, for exactly the reasons you state. :)  Trying to switch back and forth makes the overall viewing experience less enjoyable and immersive, at least for me."
buffy,37wg4j,krhsg,6,Sun May 31 07:19:00 2015 UTC,"I love seeing posts like this!  It's like seeing the show new all over again.  A lot of people think that S4 is rough.  It has some of my favorite episodes, though.  The story arc isn't very present, and it's a lot more MotW than S3 was.  I really enjoy every season.  I watched Angel years after I watched Buffy.  I think that the best way to watch it would be to try alternating shows, at least for the first season of Angel (there are a couple crossover eps that start on Buffy and end on Angel).  After that it's less important -- Season 6 & 7 of Buffy moved to a different network, so there aren't really crossovers there (seasons 3 & 4 of Angel).  Except for the first season of Angel, there aren't really any spoilers for Buffy (until the last season, which aired after Buffy ended).  Both shows have great moments, and both shows have terrible moments.  You're in for an awesome ride!  I hope you keep posting about your experiences as a new viewer."
buffy,37wg4j,krhsg,3,Sun May 31 02:52:59 2015 UTC,season 4 on both shows is rough.  but both have the best standalone scenes and episodes of season 4
buffy,37wg4j,pober,4,Sun May 31 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"I get that S4 of Buffy had a pretty weak arc and all, but it's one of my favorites.  For a lot of spoiler-y reasons that I don't want to put in this post, but it just makes me happy.  I love the whole show, really."
buffy,37wg4j,krhsg,1 point,Sun May 31 04:35:55 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I think I will try and watch them in an alternating way unless there's major serialization or one has a major drop in quality. I'll probably post occasionally after each season about my thoughts on them :)
buffy,37wg4j,pober,3,Sun May 31 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"OK. Here is my spoiler-free assessment of the series as a whole: Every season has its own strengths and individual charm (yes, even Season 1). This is why you will so many diverse answers to the question, 'what is your favourite season?' Everyone likes different things, so one season may appeal to someone more than another.   The one thing that is clear, though, is that the writing matures considerably as the show goes on and the themes become more heavy. Topics that would never be addressed in the early seasons are addressed at length in the later seasons. Generally, the cheesy elements that you see in the monster-of-the-week episodes go away for the most part as the series progresses. I would argue the quality consistently improves over the course of the show.   Personally, I find Season 5 to be the best season and it's my favourite because of the story and tone. Season 4's strength is in character development. A lot of Season 5's impact comes from the set-up of the characters in Season 4. Also, as was previously mentioned, the story may be little weak, but the season has a few really strong individual episodes so it makes up for it (the story is not bad, it's just that people expect more after Season 3's long arc, I think).   I should warn you, however, that the absolute worst episode in Buffy exists in Season 4. I won't tell you which one (you'll know when you watch it), but thankfully it's in the beginning of the season. If you make it through that one, it's all uphill from there.   As far as Angel goes, I watched it after I finished Buffy. I'm glad I did, because I found Season 1 of Angel a little rough and I would have felt a little tedium watching both shows together. However, if you are really into the show at this point, I say watch them together (spoiler-free crossover guide in the sidebar). Angel gets really good as it progresses and seeing the stories together is good for continuity.  Oh, and what did you not like about the mayor? He was so good! I loved every scene he was in."
buffy,37wg4j,placebo_burritos,5,Sun May 31 05:16:41 2015 UTC,"You put everything I wanted to say into a spoiler-free form!  Awesome.  (I know I'm in a serious minority here, but I kinda like that absolute worst episode of S4)"
buffy,37wg4j,addica-rob0t,3,Sun May 31 06:42:43 2015 UTC,"Was the worst episode the second one? I just watched it and loved it but can see why some wouldn't, the worst ep I've seen so far is I Robot, you Jane from season 1... Just ugh."
buffy,37wg4j,paulcosmith,2,Sun May 31 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"Nope. Keep watching. You'll know it because everything about it is cringy.   Living Conditions is an OK episode in my book. Tonally speaking, the early episodes in Season 4 feel so different from the previous seasons because the show changed so much. Remember, we're no longer in high school (it literally blew up), and the characters are moving into a new phase of life. At this point, the show, just like the characters, is in unfamiliar territory. The writers again have to find their groove. This also is what keeps the show fresh until the end.   The worst episode in Seasons 1-3 for me is Go Fish. Such a pointless episode that breaks up Season 2's awesome narrative. Plus it's got some cringe-worthy moments."
buffy,37wg4j,blueberry_crepe,2,Sun May 31 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all that! I guess I will try to watch them at the same time, and also watch extra episodes of each depending on how good they are at the time etc. I'd say I didn't like the Mayor because I've seen so many sarcastic villains like him and they just annoy me (I'm aware that Buffy did it first as its pretty much the oldest show I've watched but I still hate villains like that, although I guess I'm supposed to)."
buffy,37wg4j,catdoctor,3,Sun May 31 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think the show peaks at season 5. I love all 7 seasons, but there was a slight drop in quality after season 5. The beginning of season 7 is pretty rough, but it ends wonderfully. It's definitely a show you don't ever want to give up on."
buffy,37wg4j,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sun May 31 04:10:04 2015 UTC,"I watched one and then the other, back and forth, until Buffy ended. I watched it on dvd, so it was kind of a pain, but I was never confused as to what was happening. :)"

buffy,37wg4j,catdoctor,1 point,Sun May 31 10:07:03 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on S2/S3: Season 2 had higher peaks than season 3 but also had deeper valleys. (I've never liked ""Killed By Death,"" for example.) Season 3 had a more consistent quality, but never reached the peaks or valleys of season 2.  My favorite thing about Season 2: it seemed like the writers started each episode with the question ""What can we do to make Buffy's life hell this week?""  My favorite thing about Season 3: the Mayor. The best Big Bad ever."

buffy,37s04o,helcat,15,Sat May 30 02:36:36 2015 UTC,I love seeing these mini-essays from people seeing the show for the first time. I get to experience it again vicariously.
buffy,37s04o,lecherous_hump,13,Sat May 30 05:02:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I just finished this episode too (first-time watcher), and it was magnificent. The protracted scene of Giles coming home to find Jenny's body just broke me, it was one of the most upsetting but brilliant scenes that I have ever seen on TV.   I had to recover after the episode finished, but then I immediately rated the Show 5 stars on Netflix. I cannot wait to see where it goes from here."
buffy,37s04o,Leo99999,15,Sat May 30 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"""Passion is the source of our finest moments; the joy of love, the clarity of hatred, and the ecstasy of grief.""   This episode is one of many masterpiece level episodes that await you."
buffy,37s04o,hereticmoses,12,Sat May 30 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's been said a dozen times in this thread but Passion is the point of no return for a lot of us long time fans. It's the episode where at the end, I was no longer on the fence. I'd actually torrented the first two seasons - after Passion, I immediately blew $130 on a box set (though I never actually watched the DVD's, I felt this gave me enough moral leeway to watch the much more convenient downloads)  You won't be disappointed. The series is arguably one of the best shows ever made."
buffy,37s04o,nutbastard,6,Sat May 30 13:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'm excited, I always dismissed it as a dated and cheesy 90s show but now I'm loving it. This was definitely my point-of-no-return episode too"
buffy,37s04o,nutbastard,1 point,Sat May 30 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that even though it creeped into the 2000's, cellphones would ruin a lot of the plots and so they are conspicuously not a thing."
buffy,37s04o,teh_maxh,2,Sat May 30 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"Mobile phones ruin a lot of plots from the days before they were a thing. For that matter, non-mobile phones ruin a fair few plots from the days before they were a thing."
buffy,37s04o,rbwildcard,0,Sat May 30 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Until season 7 when Sunnydale ""finally gets a cell tower""."
buffy,37s04o,keeveralexander,1 point,Sat May 30 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think we all need to remember that mobile phones weren't all that common amongst people generally when even season 7 was released. I'm pretty sure I got my first one around that time too tbh (and actually, I was around the age of the phone receiver in the show at the time XD)."
buffy,37s04o,KateKillz,11,Sun May 31 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"OMG I love the monologue. Here it is all together:  ""Passion, it lies in all of us; sleeping...waiting, and though unwanted... unbidden it will stir; open its jaws and howl. It speaks to us...guides us; passion rules us all, and we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love, the clarity of hatred, and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion maybe we'd know some kind of peace... but we would be hollow; empty rooms shuttered and dank. Without passion we'd be truly dead.""  It's one of my favorite quotes and one of my favorite episodes ever. Holy fuck, I lovehate Angelus!"
buffy,37s04o,helcat,6,Sat May 30 08:04:06 2015 UTC,"Ikr, I initially disliked Angel because I thought he was pretty dull. Then I started to like him with Buffy more and more and suddenly he's gone fully evil. It's great"
buffy,37s04o,aofb031985,4,Sat May 30 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I've always liked Angelus way better than Angel. Angelus has wit."
buffy,37s04o,starlit_moon,1 point,Sat May 30 21:25:29 2015 UTC,Ugh. I hate every thing with his face.
buffy,37s04o,michellelynne87,22,Sun May 31 04:16:14 2015 UTC,For some hilarious reason I had a mind blank and thought you watched Passions as in the show Spike likes to watch. I was like oh is that a real thing?
buffy,37s04o,starlit_moon,7,Sat May 30 10:48:31 2015 UTC,It is a real thing.
buffy,37s04o,michellelynne87,2,Sat May 30 11:34:48 2015 UTC,Oh! well the more you know then
buffy,37s04o,Exende,5,Sat May 30 11:41:12 2015 UTC,Ya it's really funny b/c the character Timmy on passions mentions Buffy.
buffy,37s04o,timms5000,6,Sat May 30 13:02:00 2015 UTC,"Please make more reaction topics like this, I want to see your tears thoughts"
buffy,37s04o,aofb031985,2,Sat May 30 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"I'll try to, but my phone may break when drenched in tears so we'll have to see haha"
buffy,37s04o,pober,4,Sat May 30 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously, don't read anything around here this is the sort of show where there are major spoilers to be had. That second half of season 2 is where the show really finds itself and it has a lot more episodes on this level after this."
buffy,37s04o,Minn4theWin,1 point,Sat May 30 16:23:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. The show just gets incredible from here.
buffy,37s04o,Exende,8,Sun May 31 04:18:20 2015 UTC,"I love reading reaction write-ups like this.   I remember having the same feelings about Jenny. I was not that affected with her actual death as I wasn't emotionally attached to the character, but the aftermath, with the way that Angel sets up Giles was just twisted and brilliantly evil, and is what sold me on the story.    The whole episode is dark poetry."
buffy,37s04o,Minn4theWin,0,Sat May 30 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Dark poetry, it is! And what makes it so fucked up is seeing Giles go from being the happiest to the most depressed all in one episode. Like George R.R. Martin with GoT, Whedon has no problem whatsoever killing off major, crowd favorite characters... not necessarily speaking of Jenny, but of what we see in future episodes.  Also, for the ppl on here that keep mentioning they're watching for the first time: check out Angel. It was this very episode that gave the writers the idea for the spinoff."
buffy,37s04o,gonzowisdom,1 point,Sat May 30 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"I thought that was ""I Only Have Eyes for You"""
buffy,37s04o,Tamryn,0,Sun May 31 21:02:34 2015 UTC,Hmm I don't think so. I remember it being mentioned in the commentary. Maybe I should go back and re-watch to double check. Oh darn ;)
buffy,37s04o,DaddyCatALSO,4,Sun May 31 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"I'm watching this episode right now, and I just now noticed something. The police find Jenny's body in Gile's house and don't really seem to do anything about it.  There's a drawing of her dead body on a table, and the cops don't grab that? They do question Giles, but he's let go right away and that's the last of it. How would Gile's not be the prime suspect? I guess he has an alibi? I don't know."
buffy,37s04o,DaddyCatALSO,13,Sat May 30 05:14:51 2015 UTC,Have you seen the whole show? It's pretty clear that the police in Sunnydale are used to strange and possibly supernatural deaths.
buffy,37s04o,merehypnotist,3,Sat May 30 06:16:46 2015 UTC,Giles only saw the letter saying 'upstairs' at first so maybe the drawing was put in after by Angel after the police had left. He's just the creepy guy who might do that.
buffy,37s04o,kaekit36,1 point,Sat May 30 08:03:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you were way ahead of me."
buffy,37s04o,nutbastard,1 point,Sat May 30 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Giles: ""Have you heard of Angel?"" Detective (?Stein himself?): Yes, some sort of local gang boss, but we've never been able to find anything on him. Giles: Well, some of my students had a run-in with him a few months back, and now he's waging a vendetta. Detective: Okay, give me any details you can recall and we'll see what we can do.  But I agree, no good reason for the drawing to still be there, unless Angel or one of his henchfolk dropped it off after"
buffy,37s04o,nutbastard,1 point,Sat May 30 18:03:11 2015 UTC,Shhhhhhhh....
buffy,37s04o,rbwildcard,5,Sat May 30 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"You're in for MANY more moments like this, sweetheart. It's a fantastic show that matures along with the gang as it goes and Joss is not afraid to be brutal (no one is safe!). Welcome to the fold!!"
buffy,37s04o,monkeymosh88,3,Sat May 30 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"After Serenity, Dr Horrible and Age of Ultron I really should have thought this might happen haha"
buffy,37s04o,nebloof,3,Sat May 30 11:56:00 2015 UTC,"What, no Firefly?  Seriously... watch Firefly."
buffy,37s04o,aofb031985,2,Sat May 30 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"Oh no I actually have watched and enjoyed Firefly. It's just that nobody was cruelly murdered in it, though I'm sure it would have happened in season 2 ;_;.  On a semi-related note have you played the Firefly board game? I recently got it and it's great fun and that's coming from a guy who doesn't usually play board games. It's uncommon in most games to spend the entire time being chased by Reavers after having your crew eaten and losing all your stuff to the Alliance yet still manage to win."
buffy,37s04o,emmadara,3,Sat May 30 13:21:28 2015 UTC,"I have not, and I will look into it. Thanks!   It's just that nobody was cruelly murdered in it   cough Serenity cough"
buffy,37s04o,ModerateBias,2,Sat May 30 13:35:27 2015 UTC,Yeah those two were tough ;_;
buffy,37s04o,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sat May 30 14:16:32 2015 UTC,S/he listed Serenity above.
buffy,37s04o,keeveralexander,4,Sat May 30 14:24:28 2015 UTC,whenever you find yourself struggling as far as being interested... all that means is that its about to get really awesome
buffy,37s04o,anarchistica,4,Sat May 30 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"That episode is incredibly well crafted, I found it to be the first time Angel really became a frightening villain, a real threat. The scene where Giles comes home is just perfectly set up with the swell of the music."
buffy,37psc5,tydestra,31,Fri May 29 13:09:10 2015 UTC,"Anya's reaction to Joyce's death was gut wrenching, the fact that it's not in the top 10 is criminal.  This coming from someone who really didn't care for Anya"
buffy,37psc5,wbright92,24,Fri May 29 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"tbf I don't think buzzfeed's lists are really in any particular order, they're more just stream-of-consciousnessy"
buffy,37psc5,HarlequinNight,7,Fri May 29 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, come to think of it, you're right. It's very here's 37 stuff instead of a list of 37."
buffy,37psc5,DaddyCatALSO,8,Fri May 29 20:53:16 2015 UTC,Yeah that was a character changing event for her in the eyes of viewers. I think I recall hearing that Joss had spent so much time focusing on Buffy and then Willow with many many takes getting things just perfect. Anya was able to bust that out in a single take or something so it was kind of only in the back of everyone's minds.  When it finally aired the fans were almost as blown away by Anya's moment than they were with the rest of the episode and the writers were very surprised by this.
buffy,37psc5,SikozuShantiShanu,2,Fri May 29 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"Anya's reaction is often called Emma's finest hour in the show, at least up thru the end of S-5.  Backstory nut that I am I've often wondered if Anya hadn't established a side relationship with Joyce, beyond the latter's occasional ""Den Mother"" activities. Perhaps Anya once ina while asking Joyce questions about how a contemporary woman would act."

But it's nice to have one place for these statues, and I've already started adding my other figures to it too.  But to answer your question, it's a Heartless. I can't get enough Kingdom Hearts either! He's from the Square-Enix HD collectors box set."
buffy,37q7n2,danielle_kb,3,Fri May 29 20:14:12 2015 UTC,That looks awesome!
buffy,37qf4r,hopesdead,16,Fri May 29 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Well, with the exception of the first season, there were 22 episodes in each season. That puts these all right at the end of the first 3rd of episodes, right when the season story arc is being firmly established. It's likely just a timing/planning thing."
buffy,37qf4r,billmcneal,2,Fri May 29 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"It's just the way storytelling often pans out in a series and how story arcs tend to work.  For example, the writer of the webseries Red Vs Blue once said one of the characters, Tex, would often make her first appearance of the season in episode 10. He didn't plan it that way at first, it was just the nature of storytelling, but once it was pointed out to him he started doing it intentionally."
buffy,37qf4r,TheDeadManWalks,8,Sat May 30 10:22:54 2015 UTC,"I've seen many references to the ""seventh episode,"" in both Buffy and Angel. It's always an important episode thematically and one that I think is planned specifically to be the seventh.  AtS episodes that are #7:   Season 1: ""The Bachelor Party"" Season 2: ""Darla"" Season 3: ""Offspring"" Season 4: ""Apocalypse Nowish"" Season 5: ""Lineage""   The seventh episode seems to be a ""time of reckoning"" - secrets are revealed and a foundation is laid for future episodes.  I'm not sure if it's like this for other TV shows, but certainly there does seem to be a lot of attention paid to the seventh episode in the Buffyverse.  Edit: BtVS s5 and AtS s2 are a little different because the major ""secret"" or question was resolved in episode 5 (what's going on with Dawn and what's going on with Darla, respectively). ""Fool for Love"" and ""Darla"" are major episodes for the seasons, though."

buffy,37qf4r,withdelight,1 point,Sat May 30 02:02:05 2015 UTC,Same here. So much insight into the show.
buffy,37qf4r,keeveralexander,1 point,Sat May 30 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for mentioning that podcast, and this is a neat, interesting theory. Some of those are my favourite episodes in the series.  I did catch on to the 19th episode ""bad things happen to Tara"" thing, I'm not sure if that was intentional (and I realise it's only tangentially related but I like to bring it up :P)"

buffy,37nchq,starbuck105,8,Fri May 29 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"There's an episode in season 4 where someone makes a comment that they are a walking bruise but that she doesn't have a scratch and she says ""slayer strength"" or something to that effect.   Usually though when there is a really bad fight we see her injured, but not everyday stuff."

buffy,37nchq,MoonSpider,7,Fri May 29 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"You see more as you continue the show, but not very often. It comes with that whole slayer package I suppose. Although, TV is notorious for unrealistic after-fight scenes. When you see someone who just got into a fist fight in real life, it's not pretty. TV usually doesn't make it all that realistic.   That being said, Buffy does have some powers of strength as an excuse for lack of injury."
buffy,37nchq,lecherous_hump,6,Thu May 28 23:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's an example of ""Secondary Powers,"" where the super Slayer strength and agility also comes packaged with a level of Slayer ""durability"" or resilience.  As other people have pointed out, it ends up commented on directly in the show a few times, where Buffy has no marks on her after certain brutal encounters and other characters address the fact that anyone else in her shoes would be a 'walking bruise.'      But beyond that, the super-resilience is one of those things that has to come part-and-parcel with the super strength dealio, since not only does it allow Buffy to take punches from demons and vamps or get thrown against walls and through doors without substantial harm--- it's also what allows her to apply any of her strength without seriously injuring herself.   Buffy NEEDS to be super durable, otherwise every time she threw a super-powered punch or tossed somebody across the room she'd end up broken and torn from all the extreme forces on her body.    It's also shown a few times that Slayers (and vampires) have an accelerated healing factor as a secondary power--they recover from injuries much faster than regular folk.     All of this stuff stems from extrapolating though certain standard implications of writing about super-powered characters.  If Spider-Man routinely fights villains who can throw him through a wall, it's not really his STRENGTH that keeps him from breaking every bone in his body.  It's the demands of the story you're telling, which dictate than any character with super strength needs to be pretty durable, too."
buffy,37nchq,JangoF76,4,Fri May 29 03:34:44 2015 UTC,"Slayer healing. It gets mentioned a lot. Of course, that doesn't explain why everyone else's bruises heal so fast =p"
buffy,37nchq,DungeonPlunger,3,Fri May 29 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of slayer strength and also fast healing. I don't think the healing thing is explicitly mentioned though until season 6. But you know, she is basically a superhero - how often do you see Spider-Man (for example) with bruises?"
buffy,37nchq,whitew0lf,2,Fri May 29 06:48:03 2015 UTC,It's a combination of the slayer gift and the producers not wanting it to be too dark by showing your heroes all bruised and bloodied up all the time.  Cinematic license at it's finest!

I have met James four times, never once talked to him about the band, and he's always been amazing and sweet. Honestly, he's the nicest celebrity I've ever met on the con circuit, and so kind to his fans. Once, a girl in line in front of me got really overwhelmed and started crying, and he was just so wonderful with her--comforting her and gently asking for her name. I imagine the person you spoke with must've met him on a really bad day, or something!"

buffy,37jhv2,averagebitca,1 point,Thu May 28 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"Right?! Because he is obviously awesome in general, but he sure as hell wasn't in that scene."

buffy,37jhv2,buddhasaurus,15,Thu May 28 04:32:33 2015 UTC,"He's not a good guy. I don't think we're supposed to like him. You can like that he's a badass, but he's soulless and evil and as a vampire always is, and because of that he hurts people, uses people, and is very selfishly motivated in everything he does. Edit: Actually let me change this. Because he's soulless and evil, I guess that does make him a pretty great vampire. He's supposed to be evil, he's a vampire. Plus, that time when he didn't tell Glory that Dawn was the key."
buffy,37jhv2,socialpronk,7,Thu May 28 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"I don't get why that scene is considered such a drag on Spike as a character. That's not even close to the worst thing Spike has ever done. That's not even as bad as some of the stuff Giles is done, and he's supposed to be the moral compass for most of the show."
buffy,37jhv2,Zix117,8,Thu May 28 20:16:27 2015 UTC,Shameless fanservice.  I am pleased :)

buffy,37jhv2,Zix117,-8,Thu May 28 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"I can think of a lot of other vampires more interesting and powerful. Spike is ""pretty"", and has a few Joss Whedon quotes to spice him up. In essence, he is just a cranky Edward Cullen."
buffy,37jhv2,lifesbrink,17,Thu May 28 12:36:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think that through the show we get to see that he's not so flat of a character as that. He gets some memorable and sometimes, yes, tooly one-liners but ends up being a really complex and important character. One that the viewers end up having both love and hate for.  I don't think 'best' necessarily has to translate to 'most powerful' either. And he's definitely handsome, but also very obviously not just supposed to be there for eyecandy."
buffy,37jhv2,WhereMahDragons,1 point,Thu May 28 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"very obviously not just supposed to be there for eyecandy.   Right - he's supposed to be a badass villain heartsick drunk wacky neighbor-next-door comic relief noble love interest sadistic love interest ensouled vampire redux.   Yeah, they had no plan.   EDIT: that's just me being snarky. He wasn't just eye candy. I loved the character in season 2-3. I just don't think the writers knew what to do with him for a long while after. He was shoehorned in there for a while, in my opinion."
buffy,37jhv2,FuzzieDunlop,4,Thu May 28 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that it didn't seem like they had any particularly notable plans for his character initially. Doesn't mean he was just supposed to be there for eyecandy, though. Especially at the beginning, unless most people found the typical vamp-faced villians to be something that would count as ""pretty"" or as him solely existing to be eyecandy. Sure, there were shirtless scenes etc. later on but if anyone thinks that was the genuine highlight/overall point of the character and their role then they're missing out on a whole lot. I'll concede that he had some cringe-worthy edgy/broody one-liners, but other characters did as well. And overall it worked for him in a way that wasn't flat. A comparison to the Twilight Saga books' as a 'cranky Edward Cullen' isn't a very fair one. He existed as more than a 'pretty' 2D character.  You can say the progression seemed convoluted but his character held an importance to the show that stretched far beyond 'sit and look pretty.'"
buffy,37jhv2,WhereMahDragons,1 point,Thu May 28 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you're right about that. He was a great character. For a stretch there, though, it felt to me like he was being shoehorned into the show. I didn't like seeing such a legendary badass vamp being used as comic relief in season 4, for example."
buffy,37jhv2,FuzzieDunlop,1 point,Thu May 28 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, I agree. The way it initially progressed for awhile did seem a little forced. I mostly just wanted to clarify that his overall character didn't work out to be one deserving of being defined as ""cranky Edward Cullen"" or ""pretty""/'eyecandy' IMO.  But yeah, the decision to make him into more of a main character was obvious and sometimes awkward for the plot flow."
buffy,37jhv2,WhereMahDragons,6,Thu May 28 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Lack of a long-term plan does not mean that the character wasn't well-developed or that his progression was flawed. After all, Anya was not a ""planned"" character, either.  As Joss Whedon said in 2003:   Miller: You're known for having a master plan, for having mapped out the whole arc of the story, not just within a season, but also from season to season. But there must have been changes to that plan over the years, stuff you couldn't help or that you realized as you went along would be better if you did it another way. What were some of the big changes from the master plan?  Whedon: The master plan does not have a master plan. Television ultimately finds itself, and after it finds itself, it finds itself changing. I'd have a year plotted out, maybe two years in advance. And I had the major points that I knew I needed to hit and they would serve as anchors and we'd get from one to the next, and that was great. But the rest you deliberately don't have a plan for, because you don't know what's going to happen. Apparently people seem to be responding to this Boreanaz fellow. Apparently Seth is gone. Apparently this villain isn't working out and this one is popping like crazy. You need to improvise, you always need to.  TV's like whitewater rafting: Without rocks, there wouldn't be rapids, and it wouldn't be as much fun. Rolling with it gave us Tara and Willow coming out. It gave us Spike falling in love with Buffy. Rolling with it found out that Anya and Andrew were comic geniuses. You plan your ideas and themes, and then you let the rest form naturally, and then it feels real. It doesn't feel like you're imposing something on everybody. Ultimately, the staff - who are the biggest fan-geeks in the world, and I'm including myself - when they watch an episode have to feel the way the audience does, and more importantly the characters have to feel the way the audience does. If the audience doesn't buy that Buffy's back from the dead, then Buffy can't buy it. They've got to go, ""I can't believe this has happened. It's horrible."" If the audience is feeling the loss of Angel and feeling that she can't have a relationship with Riley, she's got to feel the same way. You feel that out."
buffy,37jhv2,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu May 28 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite things about Spike's character is how organic his character progression was. You're right, it wasn't planned. Yet I think that if you look back at his first appearance you can see how the writers built on the traits they established there and developed them over the course of the series.   Spike swung from one extreme to the other from the very beginning. I think it made for a character that was versatile and could be continually adapted for whatever purpose. It all hangs together remarkably well imo. The emotional core of him stayed consistent even if the tone of how he was presented to the audience changed."
buffy,37jhv2,puppiesandchristmas,-3,Thu May 28 15:06:57 2015 UTC,Spike and Angel were most definitely eye candy. It annoyed me how they were used and they at least got more depth in Angel.
buffy,37jhv2,lifesbrink,1 point,Fri May 29 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"Defining eyecandy here. Someone that is purely aesthetically pleasing. If you're saying that a character exists as eyecandy I'm interpreting it to mean you think that they served no more productive of a purpose than essentially being nice to look at. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  The dude got an entire spin off TV show and comic series. I don't even like Angel's character, but saying that the his entire character is just eyecandy is being stubborn IMO. Can I say Buffy's character existed to be eyecandy because she wore appealing clothing and had some stupid relationships? Had the occasional blatantly sexual role like in Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered? I think it's lacking an equal amount of acknowledgement as to the depth of her character otherwise. Spike stood on his own as a character apart from being a romantic interest/character who held sexual appeal (which wasn't even something he was really introduced with as a character, being a plain old vamp-faced villian.)  Neither Spike nor Angel were comparable to such a 2D character from a crappy teen romance novel. There were parts that definitely had those characters acting stupid or broody, but behavior like that didn't serve as the main/entire functionality of their role. Spike had a role that was very essential at times to plot and character development."

buffy,37fjgu,faaackksake,4,Wed May 27 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that they shot Tara first and when they were shooting the yard, they just went with ""no one will notice"" because the yard scene looked better this way.

buffy,37fjgu,Infamously_Unknown,2,Wed May 27 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"So did most people I presume, but you can't always tell how well will things work out when filming and here they were trying to spatially tie together two different scenes on two different sets.   So I don't think there's more to it and I'm not suprised by it, because as good as the series may be, it's not a big budget movie production where they have weeks to work out the kinks like this."
buffy,37fjgu,Markatansky,4,Wed May 27 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a degree of suspension of disbelief required. Maybe it was evil bullets"
buffy,37fjgu,barre_chord_reality,3,Wed May 27 21:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the trajectory of the bullet was vital to the plot of the story, but I did think it seemed a bit odd the first time I watched it. The way all of it happened was meant to cause confusion and chaos to the viewer, so I guess that part of the story worked."
buffy,37fjgu,catdoctor,3,Wed May 27 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"Presumably a wild shot went through the window, through Tara, out of Tara and into the ceiling or wall near Willow. The angles are all wrong, of course, but this is a show about vampires and demons, so I think we suspend our disbelief a little and allow the director a little artistic license. Wibbly wobbly timey wimey, if you will."
buffy,37fjgu,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed May 27 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"The thing that has always bothered me about this scene was I was never clear what happened to the bullet.  It looks as though the bullet completely passed through Tara; she was facing Willow, so she was shot in the back, and she has a wound in front that would therefore be an exit wound. Willow got sprayed with her blood... but where did the bullet go?"
buffy,37fjgu,longarmofmylaw,2,Wed May 27 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Willow have the bullet later, when she's torturing Warren?"
buffy,37fjgu,kaylamartinez,6,Wed May 27 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"No, that's the bullet she took out of Buffy."
buffy,37fjgu,AngryWizard,1 point,Wed May 27 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"That's another good point.  It looks as though Tara has a clear exit wound, so should Willow have been hit too?"
buffy,37fjgu,keeveralexander,2,Wed May 27 18:47:13 2015 UTC,I tried to find it but i've failed; once upon a time op I found on the internet where someone had done a csi type trajectory analysis of the bullet that killed Tara. I feel like it had diagrams with angles and red lines and actor heights and measurements and math and physics and shit.   I can't remember the final conclusion but I believe they had calculated how far away the gunman would have had to have been in reality for the angle at which the bullet entered and struck Tara. I so wish I could find it again.
buffy,37fjgu,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed May 27 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid this is one of those moments where I'm just resigned to ""they had to find a way to kill her"". The angle of the shot is pretty much impossible. I resent Joss in an I-love-him-really way for many things he's done on his shows, but there are several things in the Buffyverse I'm always angry about when I watch. One is Tara and how he toyed with the fans emotions by keeping her out of the title credits only to add her in Seeing Red ""because he always wanted to do that"". The other is Cordelia's treatment on Angel. Real anger."
buffy,37fjgu,venom8599,1 point,Sun May 31 06:49:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I'm pretty much right there with you.  So many things about that make it seem as though not only should she not be dead, she shouldn't have even been hit.  But Joss had a hard-on for killing someone off the first time they showed up in the title credits :/"
buffy,37fjgu,venom8599,1 point,Sun May 31 06:52:58 2015 UTC,"Not exactly; the bedroom window faced that yard, and Warren's alst shot was a imed itno the air, not at Buffy.. But yes, still an impossible superbullet."
buffy,37fjgu,Zix117,1 point,Wed May 27 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"He wasn't aiming properly--he was just waving the gun around in one hand. That isn't conducive to accuracy at all. And besides, bullets ricochet in sometimes quite unpredictable ways depending on the types of surfaces they impact and even the shape of deformation of the bullet when it first makes impact."
buffy,37fjgu,keeveralexander,1 point,Thu May 28 01:21:45 2015 UTC,"I did figure that the bullet going through the glass of the window would effect the trajectory, but it looks like it went from going upward at a roughly 45 degree angle to being perfectly level, based on where the hole in the glass is and where the wound on Tara is."
buffy,37fjgu,Zix117,1 point,Thu May 28 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely, but it can happen. It also could've continued, hit the ceiling and ricocheted down impacting Tara in the back at an angle and either still coming out at that same angle and it was hard to tell, or have been deflected off bone. It's hard to really tell exactly what happened since we're just judging from an in-reality totally fake gunshot, but we don't ever see the entrance wound or any ballistics evidence, so we don't know for sure. All we see is a hole in a window and a hole in Tara.  So that's enough for me to not really question it too much."
buffy,37fjx4,Illyriia,3,Wed May 27 06:54:15 2015 UTC,"I would list them as lots. For instance, season 8, season 9, After the Fall, etc. I wouldn't list individual comics unless they are volumes... then maybe... I know when I look for comics I rarely (if ever) purchase individual comics. Plus you have to then ship each comic separately. Sounds like a pain to me."
buffy,37fjx4,danielle_kb,2,Wed May 27 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"Yes lots are the way to go.  As these are not particularly valuable comics, you would have a very difficult time moving them issue by issue."

buffy,37evsw,EggheadDash,3,Wed May 27 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, a 4:3 version does not exist.  Fortunately, it's much easier to remove material than to add it. With mplayer/mpv, use the filter -vf crop=w=540:h=480 to crop to the picture to a non-widescreen size. VLC can the same thing; see the instructions at https://wiki.videolan.org/Crop/.  If you don't watch on your computer and your player doesn't have crop settings, you can create your own 4:3 versions by transcoding with the same crop filter. Handbrake is one tool you can use for this.  Burning your cropped versions back to disc starts to get into questionable copyright territory, so I'll leave that for you to investigate further on your own if you want."
buffy,37evsw,listen2,1 point,Wed May 27 03:57:06 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly ideal either though. I'm using vlc here, not mplayer, but I used that to crop the video to 4:3 and in the first 30 seconds we see Lorne lean out of the frame (here's how it looks in 16:9) The thing is when they do pan and scan for the TV broadcast they would have kept Lorne's position in mind and produced a frame like this but vlc can't do that on the fly. Oh well. Unless someone wants to check Amazon Prime for me (which I'll get if it has it) it looks like I'll be stuck seeing gobs of actors waiting for cues, vampire reflections, crew members and equipment for season 2."

buffy,37evsw,keeveralexander,1 point,Sun May 31 06:56:26 2015 UTC,"Season 2-5 of Angel are widescreen protected (not just filmed, aired and approved by Joss in widescreen in some countries). The worst goof due to the widescreen is the one you pictured at the gym (there are various mirrors showing Angel's reflection that would be out of frame in 4:3), but your example in another comment about Lorne leaning out of frame isn't actually him leaning out of frame (I mean it is, but that's the way it originally looked). My Season 2 DVD is in 4:3 and that's what it looks like :)  tl;dr, Seasons 2-5 of Angel aren't as full-frame-original-intent necessary as Buffy. Joss even mentioned that Angel was filmed in Widescreen when talking about how Buffy wasn't. If it's about creator's original intent, don't bother with 4:3 because there's no need (when it comes to Angel). If it's about watching it as it originally aired in the US (and the US alone), then a cropper will do that for you. The Lorne leaning out of frame thing actually happens on my 4:3 DVD's."

buffy,37c5yo,lecherous_hump,6,Thu May 28 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much damage they've done:   Warren: Katrina, Tara. Robbed a bank, sent a demon after Buffy. Gus: Probably killed a bunch of people. President Snow: Lots of deaths/damage/pain. Knox: Fred. Ramsay Snow: Tortured and killed a bunch of women. Joffrey: Mycah. Hurt Sansa a bit.    Aside from President Snow they're hardly truly evil, mostly just cruel."
buffy,37c5yo,kmoproductions,18,Tue May 26 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"What puts Warren over the line isn't even killing Tara, necessarily; it's raping and killing his ex-girlfriend.  Edit: Shooting Buffy, while definitely bad (understatement), is more akin to killing an opponent in battle. But there's stuff that's not ok even in wartime. Actually, maybe that's a good baseline for evil: things that aren't ok even in a war."

So I would say all of them are evil. Warren was the best villian in BtVS because he was the most realistic - just a sociopathic misogynist greedy for power with unhealthy obsession and rage."

buffy,37c5yo,anarchistica,4,Wed May 27 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"okay joffrey ill give you, he was more like a sick little child burning things with a magnifying glass, he was stupid and very cruel but not evil, more twisted. But Ramsay Snow is definitely evil, he truly relishes peoples pain, he destroys people physically and psychologically sometimes for a purpose and sometimes just for his own gratification, i mean c'mon he massacred winterfell and everything"
buffy,37c5yo,faaackksake,3,Wed May 27 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I'd forgotten about how he attacked whathisface in the books and proceeds to burn down Winterfell. Plus the whole affair with that old lady who ate her own fingers.   But aside from the Snows they people on that list aren't that bad. Knox even seemed to think he was doing Fred a favour or honouring her."
buffy,37c5yo,anarchistica,2,Wed May 27 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"yeah the at that point recently widowed donella hornwood, captures her, forces her into a marriage ceremony with him, rapes her, and then locks her in a tower and leaves her to starve to death, when they find her body she has eaten her own fingers, and that's before we even go into what he does to theon in the books, and jeyne poole and the ironborn at moat cailin etc he's pretty evil, :P  i'd argue that the scale of the act is semi-irrelevant, it could be argued deliberately, maliciously killing one person can be as heinous as killing a hundred, it's the intent that matters. You could argue that knox was just a religious fanatic so that to him giving fred to illyria was some kind of honour but that is completely insane, and i don't think we can excuse 'evil' just because of insanity, we have real world counterparts to people like knox, ISIS, boko haram etc, whatever reason they use to justify their behaviour (in this case religion) it's still evil. Also if Illyria had come back at full strength and things hadn't gone the way they did there's a distinct possibility that she could have dominated the world she was an old one, at that point in knoxs mind he was pretty much dooming humanity to either genocide or enslavement.  haven't seen or read the hunger games stuff so don't know how evil the suthernator is in that one. and yeah Gus is just a drug dealer, i don't remember him going out of his way to kill innocent people but it's been a while since i've seen it, iirc most of the people he shot were like lackeys or rivals etc, still a bit evil but not really on par with campaigns of flaying people alive or summoning ancient demons..."
buffy,37c5yo,anarchistica,2,Wed May 27 12:06:03 2015 UTC,Hunger Games-Snow is evil in a dictator sense. Think Stalin-people are just pawns so he can get what he wants. He has absolutely no problem killing someone who mildly irritates him.

Ramsay was raised by a guy who says ""don't make me regret raping your mother"" at a castle belong to a bunch of people who have a mutilated person as a flag. Taking that into account, he does relatively little damage. He unnecessarily hurts a few girlfriends and his wife. He's hardly as evil as Robb Stark.  Same with Gus. Gus seems more of a Stringer Bell than a Marlo. WW himself is probably more evil.  People generally seem to have a problem telling evil apart from meanness/cruelty. Just look at the love the Starks get and the hate Walder Frey gets."

Yeah, he was an idiot for refusing to accept how marriage works in Westeros, and a bigger idiot for assuming that he could get away with it.

Also, did the Engineers plant humans on a planet already infested with demons just to, like, see what would happen? That could be an interesting plot thread to explore.

Paige Moss was really cool, she did a great job. But she only did it for a couple of episodes because we lost the boy. But then four episodes later I got to meet Amber Benson. So like I said, you gotta have the rocks.  Sometimes we had guest-star issues. Quite frankly, I had planned to see Tara again later this year and Amber decided against it. I'm not unhappy because we got to make the statement with Kennedy, that you can move on and you can live. It's scary, and we've played a couple of episodes about how frightening it was to enter into another relationship, how it felt like a betrayal - because it felt like that to the audience. That was an interesting place to go. You know what they say, every time a door shuts...  ...  Miller: Were there any other final notes you wanted to strike before the conclusion and couldn't, besides having Tara come back?

(sorry, no s[pellcheck here)  Later, joss was discussing the possible idea thta Buffy would receive a wish as a reward and she'd use ti to raise Tara. Not sure how sicnere he was but I'm sure he and the writers discussed this and many other far-out things. but, when he sounded Amber out about it, she had a prior commitment and couldn't commit to it. So he abandoned the idea, not that i think he would've followed thru, that storyline wouldn't suit his style."

buffy,379cae,bwburke94,2,Tue May 26 11:26:13 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, Spike: The Complete Series would not be the best starting place; it actually takes place takes place not just after After the Fall, but also after Buffy season 8.  This is another good order you might want to look at:   Buffy: Omnibus 1-7  Angel: Omnibus 1&2  Spike: Omnibus  Spike: After the fall  Angel: After the fall (1-4)  Angel: Aftermath  Angel: Last Angel in Hell (totally unnecessary all together just as an fyi)  Angel: the End  Angel: Only Human (has to do with Illyria)  Angel: Illyria  Spike: The Complete Series  Fray: Future Slayer (anytime at all before reading Buffy season 8)  Buffy: Season 8   Buffy: Season 9  Angel & Faith: Season 9 (concurrent with Buffy season 9)  Buffy: Season 10  Angel & Faith: Season 10 (concurrent with Buffy season 10)   As for what is canon and what is skippable:  Contrary to what the Excel document suggests, it's not clear that Spike: Asylum and Shadow Puppets are canon. They're supposed to take place sometime during AtS season 5, but the timeline really doesn't seem to work with the characters and what they would have been doing during the events of the show.  From what I understand, the main reason they are considered ""canon"" is because they introduce a character that also appears in After the Fall. Brian Lynch has said that he wasn't concerned so much about streamlining his stories with the rest of canon and more about ""telling the best Spike story that he could.""  In general it seems that the author of a comic has much more influence on the characterization and overall presentation of the story than the writer of an episode in the show. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of Brian Lynch's writing. His portrayal of Spike is not at all how I understood the character in the show, and Shadow Puppets in particular I thought was fairly tasteless.   It is a well-known comic, though, even if (possibly) not canon, and many people like it. I just wanted to give you a heads-up that if you don't like Spike: Asylum, it's not necessarily representative of the rest of the comics. :)  I really enjoyed Illyria: Spotlight. I'm not sure if it's considered canon - I don't think so - but it's one of the best and most true-to-the-show comics I've ever read. I'd recommend it.  There are also some comics available online here; I believe many of them are also collected in the Buffy Omnibus volumes. They're worth a look. I particularly like Reunion by Jane Espenson.  Have fun exploring the expanded Buffyverse!"

The Tara/Willow arc beginning, Xander/Anya continuation and growth, Buffy facing the adult world (with a ""normal"" boyfriend to boot), and Giles finding his own path. Really, when you look at that season, it's necessary for the story as a whole.   And you know, I never really thought too much about what you said regarding ""the first year of college is disorienting and directionless"" but this season does fit quite well with that.   As for strong episodes, almost every time I cherry pick episodes to watch, it's from that season. That says a lot."

buffy,373xor,slipn,4,Mon May 25 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Actually, I know there are people that genuinely like it.   Buffy episodes vary in quality, but I do not consider any of them to be bad, except for this one. Here's why it's a bad episode, in my opinion:   It recalls a tonally Season One-type scenario and then proceeds to exceed any silliness that has existed up to that point in the series. People changing into cavemen by drinking magically-spiked beer? Please. I would have hoped the show would be a little more intelligent with its metaphors.  It's supposed to be a one-off anti-drug message. But does it actually work as an anti-drug episode? At the end, Xander asks Buffy what she learned about beer. She responds, 'foamy'. The episode also is scattered throughout with moments of supposed hilarity. If anything, what we learn from this episode is that drunk people are funny. Wrecked is a much better episode with a similar theme. OK, so it fails in its one-off state. Does it at least have any interesting character developments, advance any important plot points, give us more interesting lore to consider? No. The only plot point worth noting is that Parker is no longer a concern for Buffy now by the end of this episode. Thank god that's over. Parker's short story arc was too long anyway.

He seems to borrow and self-reference his previous work a lot when it comes to his newer stuff (for example, not technically Buffy, but I also noticed some similarities between the Avengers in AoU and some of the characters from Firefly, complete with an older brother who watches out for his powerful yet not completely there sister). I'm working through 4 for the first time (seen some of his other stuff like Firefly, Dr. Horrible, and Avengers), and the pep-talk that Xander gives Buffy in ""The Freshman"" is very reminiscent of the one Clint gives Wanda in AoU (I also found it kinda funny how Xander at one point in that scene said the phrase ""Avengers Assemble"", considering it was over a decade before Joss was made director of Avengers)."

buffy,373b11,strawberryf1elds,6,Sun May 24 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I also think Willow's character is developed in a way that is consistent with the later seasons. Needing love in order to feel validated, and becoming obsessed with that to the point of destruction...it's basically the finale of season 6. And it all starts with 'I Robot, You Jane.'  I think this quote from 'Two to Go' encapsulates this side of Willow nicely: ""Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser, and she always has been. ... The only thing Willow was ever good for... the only thing I had going for me... were the moments, just moments, when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful."""

It's interesting to see how insecure he is. 5 it's nice to see Xander have some useful information about CRD. 6 Willow two times calls for her parents. It's never explained why they didn't respond. Any idea why? 7  Malcolm: Right now, a man in Beijing is transferring money to a Swiss bank account for a contract on his mother's life. Good for him.

buffy,373b11,BeadleBelfry,3,Mon May 25 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the conceptual prequel to Age of Ultron  It seems a little too easy for the monks to trap Moloch  There's a folder on one computer named ""Buffy... I, Robot"" Think that had the episode script or something?  Dave was alright, but that other guy was just cringe-worthy  Moloch seems to be putting a lot of effort into one girl. If he wanted to he could just use his hypno-love powers to enslave everyone, right? Unless he actually has a type of love for his victims.   ""... a very deadly and seductive demon"" ... Yeah I see it.   Jenny's demon knowledge probably comes from being a gypsy not just being on the Internet  I liked the banter between Giles and Jenny but ""technopagan?"" Really?  Also I like the idea of other groups in the world fighting the good fight. It makes more sense than ""one girl in all the world"""
buffy,373b11,The_Ripper42,2,Mon May 25 02:38:12 2015 UTC,"""technopagan"" is a real religious movement which was quite a bit in the news around that time. Yet another reason why she was estranged form he r clan."

buffy,373b11,lecherous_hump,1 point,Sun May 24 20:31:32 2015 UTC,This episode is my least favourite of season 1 with a bullet. The story is all over the place and the demon in the computer is so nineties it hurts. The main example is these lines:  Willow: I met him online. Buffy: In line for what?  The story has a whole just doesn't make sense and the only redeeming quality I can think of is the introduction of Jenny and the beginning of her relationship with Giles and the shot where the monks seal the box only for the next shot bo be of Buffy opening it. It's a shame that the first Willow episode is such a weak one but upwards and onwards from here. (Well mostly up. A few more real stinkers to come...in my opinion anyway)
buffy,373b11,fmccool01,1 point,Mon May 25 16:01:33 2015 UTC,I think this might just be the worst episode of Buffy.

Also, the weirdo kid who says ""If you're not jacked in, you're not alive."" Crazy thing is people are so hooked to the internet these days, most suggest to get off it... just makes me laugh."
buffy,373b11,skjay91,1 point,Wed May 27 10:54:19 2015 UTC,The cringe worthy dialog about Internet does a good job of evoking the enthusiasm that inflated the dotcom bubble at that time.  The worst part is that the writers missed a golden opportunity by going with a demon instead of a troll.

buffy,3722ra,triivium,10,Sun May 24 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind about Spike and 'that scene' ... He didn't have a soul, so he had no frame of reference for right and wrong. He and Buffy had a violent and tumultuous relationship, and she often rejected him for reasons that had little to do with her feelings. Usually right before or just after having sex with him (sex she seemed to enjoy quite a bit).  I'm not justifying it, nor saying that any person in that situation has cause to act the same way. But Spike thought he was doing what Buffy wanted, and when he learned that a) he didn't know what she wanted and b) he was metaphysically incapable of ever knowing, Spike took immediate steps to address the issue and return to her 'fixed'."
buffy,3722ra,jayman419,4,Sun May 24 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"It's been rehashed many many times. I've read through a lot of forums and a lot of discussion about it and Buffy in general. And honestly it doesn't change my opinion on Spike that much. I am well aware of exactly what he was at any point in time during this binge watch. You don't have to defend him to ME of all people. I'm just saying to everyone else in that universe.. he was not able to redeem himself, and that is what is upsetting to me. Because he was doing really well... Doing less evil things. And then that happened and then no one could really trust him again. I thought maybe finally he could make a solid case for himself but unfortunately Buffy never loved him the way I thought he deserved to be loved."
buffy,3722ra,jayman419,3,Sun May 24 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily to defend him. Just to put it in context.  Spike doesn't have much of a chance at redemption among Buffy and her peers. Their only example is Angel, and he said he was a good guy with a soul then went nuts, killed people, hurt Buffy, and left town. Spike did as well as he could, as far as making a case for himself, through his noble death.  But Spike does a bit better on Angel, especially when he's dealing with Fred. The Fang Gang has a better idea of the real duality of an ensouled vampire, and are much better able to accept him."
buffy,3722ra,Sassafrass23,3,Sun May 24 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I know the context quite well. Just watched it last week!     I just wish he had the chance to be as great of a love as people think Angel is. I actually liked it when he lived in Xander's basement after high school ended for them and they became a little buddy buddy. But not much more bonding action after that. In fact, Xander became intensely hostile. I liked it when Spike was able to bond with Buffy's inner group. With Dawn and Joyce for example.     I actually haven't seen Angel... so I don't know much about it. I kinda wish Spike left town and didn't come back. Even though he got to redeem himself at the very end, I feel like it wasn't really enough. In all of season 7 he just got yelled at and beaten up all the time. No one really acknowledged it much or was even appreciative."
buffy,3722ra,GinaZaneburritos,6,Sun May 24 04:55:02 2015 UTC,"Xander...   I loved him as a teen but agree with you after watching as an adult.   I was also a huge Buffy/Angel fan as a teen (but can totally see the Angel hate now) but I won't ever be able to get over Xander's reaction to Angel coming back from hell. Him and Giles blamed everything Angelus did on Angel and it drives me crazy! That was definitely one thing I enjoyed more about Ats than BTVS, the clear separation between Angel and Angelus."
buffy,3722ra,Sassafrass23,11,Sun May 24 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"Him and Giles blamed everything Angelus did on Angel and it drives me crazy! That was definitely one thing I enjoyed more about Ats than BTVS, the clear separation between Angel and Angelus.   I find this comment to be really baffling, as AtS was the show that - I thought - made clear just how thin the line was between Angel in both his soulless and ensouled states.  Seasons 2 and 3 in particular showed how dark Angel could be even with a soul. He left a hotel full of people to die in ""Are You Now or Have You Ever Been,"" he locked twenty-some lawyers in a room with two murderous vampires, he ignored, disrespected, and physically threatened his friends. He also tortured both people and demons (killing a harmless demon was something portrayed in BtVS as part of Faith's descent into darkness) and attempted to lose his soul with Darla.  Drusilla is surprised by how similar his actions are to those of Angelus, and she even sees him as Angelus in ""Reunion"":   DRUSILLA: Look what we have for you! (then, disappointed) It's not Daddy, it's never Daddy, it's the Angel-beast...   and after he refuses to save any of the lawyers:   DRUSILLA: Daddy!   He never denies the actions he does as Angelus; when Holtz captures him in ""Lullaby,"" he tells him that    There is no justice for the things I did to you.   To me, it seems clear that Angel does not think of his actions as separate from those of Angelus, or himself as not somehow responsible for them. He has always had a darkness within him, a taste for cruelty, that his soul enables him to keep in check (when he lets it). But he is not a separate person, no more than Spike is in his soulless and ensouled states.  If anything, it bothers me that many people tend to absolve Angel for the crimes he did as Angelus in Buffy but hold the actions of soulless Spike against him in s7. At the very least, it seems as though there should be a consistent standard."
buffy,3722ra,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sun May 24 07:23:15 2015 UTC,"**Angel spoilers  Those are some really good points and I agree about the darkness always being inside him. I just see the two of them as so distinct. I mean, when Angel is doing all of those things (locking the lawyers in, etc) it seemed pretty clear to me that it was Angel being tortured over his failure with Darla, not that Angelus had returned (which I know isn't your point). I took Drusilla's 'daddy' comment to be more wishful thinking on her part.   Season 4, though, when Angelus actually does return, Angel's comments after he is restored are something like 'I don't feel bad about what he did, we knew what we were risking by bringing him back' and how nobody blames him, it's all hugs from the crew and Faith and then back to business. Very different from everyone's reaction in Buffy and I like it better this way.   Absolutely they are 2 sides of the same man but they are distinct in my mind. It's my old crush on Angel that causes me to be so frustrated by Xander's unwillingness to see Angel my way, as separate from Angelus.   I definitely agree about wishing there had been a little better consistency in this aspect.   Edit: spelling  Edit 2: the Spike thing: I was frustrated that he didn't seem to be distinct from his soulless counterpart. I expected this whole different person, like the way I see it with Angel/Angelus. This is also a lack of consistency  imo but I know you see it the other way around."
buffy,3722ra,venom8599,3,Sun May 24 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"Angel spoilers  I think one of the main differences in the reactions of everyone to Angelus in AtS s4 is that Angelus never really hurt them. He killed no one when he was soulless, except for the Beast, who they all had been trying to kill anyway.  He scared them and said some hurtful things, but that's much easier to come back from than breaking an innocent girl's heart and killing someone they knew and loved (Jenny).  He was also ""the boss,"" and they had a great many other problems to deal with at the time. Angel was a peripheral member of the group in BtVS and had never been fully accepted by them; by the time they knew he was back, he'd been gone for months, and no one (not even Buffy) argued that he was necessary to have around because of all the good he could do. They were not in the same sort of ""crisis situation"" that they were in AtS.  I think another big difference was that they hadn't put Angel on a pedestal - they knew what he was capable of and what to expect from him without the safeguard of a soul. ""Eternity"" captures their feelings nicely:   Cordy: Okay, here is something I never thought I would say to you: Wesley’s right. Forget about it.  Angel: But I really didn’t mean...  Cordy:  Oh, yes, you did. And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t try to weasel out of it. (Gets up) Angelus may not be the most relaxing company, but at least he’s honest. Shouldn’t I expect the same from the not-evil version of my friends?   What Angel does and says without a soul is what he could just as easily do and say as Angel, were it not for the soul that provides him the impetus not to give in and to think of others instead.   Very different from everyone's reaction in Buffy and I like it better this way.   I do too. :) It seems to me that Angel is much more himself with his team than he was with Buffy; they understand and know him better and are not innocent of the depths to which his darkness can take him.  I think it is less that Angel ""completely changed"" in BtVS and more that Buffy just fundamentally misunderstood the character of the person she fell in love with... which is both completely understandable and very realistic for someone who is 16-17. :) I think Buffy saw him as a dark romantic hero, and most of what we see of Angel in BtVS is very much her point of view.  Even in the early seasons of BtVS, he is cagey, misrepresents to Buffy that he has never seen her before, follows her (she even at one point calls it ""stalking""), and uses Xander easily and without apology  to deceive Spike in ""School Hard."" He's not a perfectly good hero; he's a very complicated guy who is trying to figure out how to be in the world and do good after being a literal serial killer for hundreds of years. He does do many good things in seasons 1 and 2, but they're almost all focused on protecting Buffy; he isn't interested so much in helping strangers - not yet anyway. His soul does enable him to grow past this more in s3... and definitely in Angel. :)   Absolutely they are 2 sides of the same man but they are distinct in my mind. It's my old crush on Angel that causes me to be so frustrated by Xander's unwillingness to see Angel my way, as separate from Angelus.   It is possible to like Angel (even a lot) and still see him as not (very) separate from Angelus. I love Angel. :) I think he's a wonderful character."
buffy,3722ra,Sassafrass23,1 point,Sun May 24 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely they are 2 sides of the same man but they are distinct in my mind. It's my old crush on Angel that causes me to be so frustrated by Xander's unwillingness to see Angel my way, as separate from Angelus.   I used to think of Angel the same way. However, now I think it's more complicated. It isn't just when he has a soul he's good and when he doesn't he's bad. Even when he has the soul -- Angellus is still there underneath. He isn't just a man in a vampire's body. The demon is still there, subconsciously urging him to give in and be a monster even with the soul.  I think that by S4 most of the Angel Investigations crew realize that. Gunn is the only one who has an explicit conversation with Angel about it as far as I remember, in ""That Old Gang of Mine"". I'm sure Wesley realizes it as well, judging by some of his actions in S3-S5. Another thing you have to take into account is that the Angel Investigations crew at that point are a lot different than most of the characters in Buffy, even if they started out in Buffy. Angel spoilers  It seems more petty with Xander because he obviously has/had feelings for Buffy. But I think mostly it is out of genuine concern for her that he's an asshole to Angel and Spike. He's concerned that she's so blinded by love that she doesn't see that the demon is still there inside them. I don't recall him ever really being an asshole to Riley too, so that makes it seem even less like petty jealousy to me."
buffy,3722ra,Sassafrass23,1 point,Thu May 28 03:12:19 2015 UTC,Same reaction! I thought Angel was great when I was younger. Watching through it now... bit too broody and love-sick. If I were a teenager watching that... yeah go true love! But not a teenager anymore. Haha. It's interesting how different stages in life make me react so differently to these characters. I suppose I was more naive then.
buffy,3722ra,themasterdoctor,2,Sun May 24 04:46:55 2015 UTC,Have you watched Angel? I think it's fantastic. The Buffy characters that move over to Angel are able to be explored so much better and the story line is great.   It doesn't really have the same comedy that Buffy has (something my brother in law pointed out when he recently watched for the first time) but it's very good.
buffy,3722ra,themasterdoctor,2,Sun May 24 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it at all. I do like Cordelia so maybe I'll give it a go sometime. Oh yeah! I didn't even mention how Xander was a complete jerk to Cordelia. I felt bad toward her with the way he treated her toward her end on Buffy. So many things to bingewatch... so little time.     If it's not comedic, what is it like?"
buffy,3722ra,theoremofgoats,2,Sun May 24 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"So I'm actually watching part of season 1 as I respond. I always do this when I'm on this sub, I get sucked right back in!   There are definitely funny parts but rather than most episodes having a consistent, funny theme like in buffy it's a little more serious. Which should be expected because it doesn't start in high school and the characters are older.   Also, the crossovers between the two series are super fun, they're more frequent in the early Angel seasons but last a long time. Angel seasons 2 and 3 are, in my opinion, soooo good."
buffy,3722ra,bwburke94,5,Sun May 24 05:12:14 2015 UTC,Cordelia is so different in angel though. I suppose this is probably because she's more of a central character that she was explored a lot more and changed more and more throughout Angel
buffy,36yu8c,K0KA42,48,Sat May 23 07:22:02 2015 UTC,"Angel. I completely understand your hesitance here. I couldn't get into it for a while because the simple fact that it wasn't Buffy. However, I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did because it gets really, really good. Remember, Buffy's first season is a little rough too.   The further along you get into Angel, the less derivative the episodes become, and the more interesting the characters are. I remember in Season 3 of Buffy I was waiting for a moment for Wesley to show us he was more than a one-dimensional sap. We never really got that, but in Angel we do. Actually, his character arc is better than any other's in the Buffyverse, in my opinion.   Now there are a few missteps here and there, but I would argue fewer than in BTVS (I'd also argue BTVS has more high points than AtS) and honestly, the final season is just so good, it's worth slogging through the occasional off-episode just to get to the brilliant finale. Seriously, AtS has the best finale I've ever seen. Also, two of the best episodes of the Buffyverse shows come from Season 5 of Angel (A Hole in the World/Shells). And no, the crossover episodes are fun, but the show really holds together on its own just fine.   Tldr: Stick with it.   Edit: Can't speak for the comics."
buffy,36yu8c,pober,4,Sat May 23 07:58:58 2015 UTC,"I remember in Season 3 of Buffy I was waiting for a moment for Wesley to show us he was more than a one-dimensional sap. We never really got that, but in Angel we do.   Both Cordelia and Wesleys' character arcs were amazing. They transformed so much but it was believable too. Angel definitely turns into a show that can stand by itself - but it does still run parallel to Buffy at the same time and there's usually one or two episodes in each season that tie directly into what's happening in Buffy.   Each season has an interesting villian/nemesis arc and all have their own strong standalone episodes too. A favourite of mine is one where they investigate a mysterious ballet act that appears to have been running with the same cast for hundreds of years, purely for the seriously creepy horrifying minions in that episode (you'll know them when you see them). It's coincidentally Summer Glau's acting debut too and..there are other but I'll rein in the babbling.  I too am not sure about season 5. I'm still processing it, even today.  Another thing OP can check out is the animated series. Not the long-talked about and abandoned cartoon show, but the series that animates the season 8 comics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMDYRQFMU1E the animation style might not be to everyone's taste, but I quite enjoy it.  There's also a lot of Buffy novels out there. They're all hit and miss. Some are incredible, some are kinda trashy. They definitely explore the canon and you can pick and choose which season you want to read more about. A few of my favourites are Tempted Champions, The Gatekeeper Trilogy, The Wisdom of War, The Book of Four, and The Lost Slayer arc.   Finally..if you're interested in enjoying more Buffy in general, there's the official guidebooks sure but they're held in check by being official (they're kinda dull). If you want to read something that's full of interesting information but can also say whatever the hell it wants to, I'd check out Slayer by Keith Topping. They're unofficial yet highly detailed reviews of each episode that has a dozen funny little sections for everything, such as looking at themes, connections to other episodes, pop culture references, dialogue, subtext, mistakes made in each episode (like eyebrows falling off or crewmembers visible in the bushes), quotes, and allsorts of random interesting information relevent to each episode. I love these books. They're available to buy as one large volume containing the whole series now.  Nerd out!"

buffy,36yu8c,pober,1 point,Sat May 23 20:21:11 2015 UTC,Eerie stuff. I can never get those minions out my head!
buffy,36yu8c,Gingerwerewolf13,4,Sat May 23 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree with most of the people here. Angel, while I enjoyed a good part of it, only comes close to Buffy with a few episodes. Otherwise, it is markedly less interesting. And I have never seen such bad TV as Angel season 4. The characters are haphazardly written and their arcs meander wildly. But there is some great stuff there, but equally there is terrible stuff."
buffy,36yu8c,VanillaMoonPie,3,Sat May 23 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to try to defend the ending of Season 4. However, it did set up Season 5 quite nicely, so there is a redeeming factor, I guess."
buffy,36yu8c,pober,2,Sat May 23 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"I just ignore season 4, then I love angel."
buffy,36yu8c,LoLjoux,3,Tue May 26 01:51:33 2015 UTC,I personally didn't like Angel season 5.  I thought 2 and 3 were the best.
buffy,36yu8c,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Sat May 23 17:06:35 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Those seasons had some really awesome moments in them like
buffy,36yu8c,pober,2,Sat May 23 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of all kinds of Willow in the comics, definitely read them.  Agreed about Angel, as you get farther into Angel the story gets so good. Also, Angel focuses more on long, in-depth story arcs with a great payoff than I feel Buffy did."
buffy,36yu8c,BthreePO,1 point,Sat May 23 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree about the Angel storylines. Once you get past the first season, the show really feels like one cohesive story being told."
buffy,36yu8c,pober,1 point,Sat May 23 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"I agree angel is so much better once you get into it. Amazing last season. Although I hate it was just cut off like that, it was just canceled so it wasn't supposed to be the series finale  Also has anyone read the buffy comics? Thinking about reading them to continue the series. They are on season 10"
buffy,36yu8c,tif2shuz,7,Mon May 25 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"It seems your questions have been examined regarding Angel, now about the comics.   I am glad you got season 8. It's worth reading. But keep in mind that it gets way better after season 8 (in my opinion anyways). It's a little crazy and everything is.... well, big. But it gets more down to earth after that season. So again, stick with it. And it's totally worth reading. All the characters continue their arcs- the Buffy story isn't done yet. So don't quit.   Dark Willow? Again, read the comics.   My take on Angel is that it's worth it. Especially to see the Wesley arc. There are parts that are kind of sloggy to get through, but totally worth it in the end. pober said in one of these comments that Wesley's character arc is better than any others. I cannot argue with that."
buffy,36yu8c,danielle_kb,8,Sat May 23 12:59:35 2015 UTC,In season 8 Joss and company get a little carried away with the fact that they no longer have budgetary restraints and end up doing some pretty stupid things.  The two season 9 books are fantastic though.  Angel & Faith Season 9 was my pick of the week every week it came out.
buffy,36yu8c,oblivious247,3,Sat May 23 14:28:05 2015 UTC,Oh that is really good to know. I tried season 8 but without limitations it becomes ridiculous. I'll have to try 9 now thank you.
buffy,36yu8c,iwanttoreddittoo,2,Sat May 23 17:29:38 2015 UTC,Agreed.
buffy,36yu8c,danielle_kb,7,Sat May 23 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"If you liked BTVS, you will probably enjoy Angel enough to make it worth your time.   Have you seen Firefly? 10/10."

buffy,36yu8c,knitknitterknit,5,Sat May 23 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"Approach Angel as its own show. Its not Buffy, it wasn't meant to be. Its darker at times and the evolution some characters undertake there is pretty massive."
buffy,36yu8c,tydestra,3,Sat May 23 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"I loved Angel but it is not Buffy as there is no other.  Not crazy about the comics.  What keeps me going is watching Buffy over and over and over, etc."
buffy,36yu8c,free112701,3,Sat May 23 13:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just finished season 8, and was about to start season 9. Season 8 was really good. It's a weird feeling at first, cause it's a different medium, but really enjoyable. The writers were able to do story arcs that would've been too expensive for TV, while still keeping the humor and charm of the show. And it's all canon (confirmed by Whedon)"
buffy,36yu8c,eatapenny,2,Sat May 23 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"IMO season 9 was better then season 8, but don't forget to read Angel & Faith, because it was fantastic.   While we're on the topic of Buffy comics, can anyone tell me is season 10 is any good?"
buffy,36yu8c,decerian,2,Sat May 23 15:34:15 2015 UTC,Season 10 is strong.  I think its the closest to the show the comics have gotten so far.
buffy,36yu8c,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Sat May 23 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty excited about 9 and Angel & Faith"
buffy,36yu8c,eatapenny,6,Sat May 23 15:57:39 2015 UTC,Hell yes Angel is worth 5 seasons. I think it's even better than Buffy.
buffy,36yu8c,suss2it,2,Sat May 23 07:41:56 2015 UTC,I just finished Angel and I found it such a hard slog by the end. Maybe I'll enjoy it more on a second watch through but I won't be doing that for a while.
buffy,36yu8c,theperfectend,2,Sat May 23 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"The latter half of Angel's season 5 are the best episodes of any show I've ever watched. Honestly, the show IS slow but it's all worth it in the end. It's darker and explores different questions than Buffy. It takes a long time for it to find it's way but when it finally does it is to me one of the greatest thing ever.   I would suggest you take a break before starting Angel, cause you will probably get tired of the show before it reaches it's amazing point and you start to see it. 7 seasons of Buffy + 5 seasons of Angel in one go is probably too much if you are feeling hesitant about it."
buffy,36yu8c,Eagle37,1 point,Sat May 23 17:47:14 2015 UTC,I have the library editions of the comics.  I love them and I am not a comic book reader.
buffy,36yu8c,comradewolf,1 point,Sat May 23 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Angel is really great, especially in the later seasons. The episodes that were happening when buffy was still on are also pretty cool, because you really see Angel's perspective about Buffy's decisions. The comics are also really badass. Xander is so rad in them."
buffy,36yu8c,glamasaurusrex,1 point,Sat May 23 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"I've been watching the two shows together on my first time. Angel S1 and S2 weren't great, but at Angel S3 (Buffy S6) I'm finding myself wanting to grab the Angel DVDs instead of the Buffy ones. Not sure how either one ends, but Angel does get interesting."
buffy,36yu8c,soundman1024,1 point,Sat May 23 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"Angel is great. Darker than Buffy and the second half of Season 4 has some icky stuff, but still worth watching. Also watch Firefly and Dollhouse. Al of Whedon's shows have a slow start so be patient."

buffy,36yu8c,lecherous_hump,0,Sat May 23 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I enjoyed moments of Angel, but it's very slow. The character development that permeates Buffy is there, but it takes a lot longer. There are a lot of episodes that don't add anything to the plot and are just meh. But this all improves in season 5, which I think is when Buffy ended and Joss got more time to work on the show. So I recommend watching the first and last seasons, and going back for the rest if you enjoyed that."

buffy,36w8yz,catdoctor,21,Fri May 22 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"That's actually one thing that I seriously disagreed with. High school Xander was my favorite Xander. Yes he had some seriously stupid moments and some downright deceitful and hurtful moments but I don't think any 17 year old boy made it out of adolescence without having a few of the same moments. He didn't need to be chubby or a complete loser, he never was originally. They were the cooler of the outcasts, and by turning him into an oaf, they sort of ruined his character to me. He kind of regained his confidence after the replacement but I don't know why they completely destroyed it in the first place. Him being with Cordelia made sense, Willow finding him attractive made sense. He was always the underdog but they completely cut his legs out from under him when the rest went to college and I never really understood why it was necessary."
buffy,36w8yz,Sauceykat,19,Fri May 22 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of friends from high school who didn't go to college when the vast majority of people did. They felt extremely isolated from those of us who did go on to college. They would get defensive, sort of project a 'you must think you're smarter than me' kind of thing a lot. So I can understand why Xander would have felt that way in season 4. Although once Buffy drops out half there are less people in their group in school than not so it shouldn't have been as big of a deal for him I guess."
buffy,36w8yz,Tamryn,9,Fri May 22 18:42:10 2015 UTC,"And he's a freaking contractor. Those guys work hard as hell and get rewarded for it. He's bomb in the comics too. I'm not all caught up but he's definitely not just the comic relief or ""glue"" like some shows try to pawn off."
buffy,36w8yz,sweetlemongrass,13,Fri May 22 19:48:34 2015 UTC,I've always thought young Xander looks like young Matt Dillon and that picture is a perfect example.

buffy,36u27u,Sassafrass23,13,Fri May 22 03:05:18 2015 UTC,Haha I think it's just a joke about Anya's past as a demon!
buffy,36u27u,strawberryf1elds,28,Fri May 22 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"From the Buffy Wiki : it is presumably a reference to Persephone, stolen bride of Hades and Greek goddess of springtime. Anya's doubt probably comes from that in some myths Persephone is held captive against her will, while in other ones they are a merry couple."
buffy,36u27u,Bewarethewulf,18,Fri May 22 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"someone is stretching there on the wiki...   like...  stretching beyond all sense  persephone was not a child, for one.  also, there is no version of the myth where they are a merry couple (since its the myth of why we have seasons, a happy couple would make no sense)"
buffy,36u27u,ModerateBias,8,Fri May 22 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"Well, in the story of the myth I could find, she was described as ""a young maiden.""  The part about why we have seasons is because her mother, goddess of grain and growth, missed her, and therefore didn't pay attention to her duties. It had nothing to do with whether or not Persephone was happy with her husband."
buffy,36u27u,Bewarethewulf,14,Fri May 22 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I know who added that because there is someone on the Buffy wiki who keeps making these wild connections to everything. ""Character X is actually based on Dante from Devil May Cry! And character Y is actually an homage to Professor X from the X-Men!"" This without any kind of source to back up the claims, of course."
buffy,36u27u,Beloit,1 point,Fri May 22 09:01:13 2015 UTC,"And character Y is actually an homage to Professor X from the X-Men!   I have to say, I have noticed several things that are homages to Marvel."
buffy,36u27u,Beloit,2,Sun May 24 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"I bet there are, I mean Buffy herself was based on Kitty Pryde and her last name was taken from Scott Summers, and we know that because Joss had said so. But the things that are added to the wiki is stuff like, ""This character is bald and Prof X is bald too, therefore one is based on the other!"" Just because characters share a basic trait like hairstyle does not mean it's necessarily copied from somewhere else, which this person does seem to think is the case."
buffy,36u27u,TheDemonHauntedWorld,7,Sun May 24 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"Well... It's not like some dude just pulled that connection out of nowhere. It's from a article written by Doctor Laurel Bowman from the Department of Greek and Roman Studies of the University of Victoria.  In the article she says:   Anya, a reformed vengeance demon who now works with Buffy, says when she hears this ""Dawn may have been ill-advised in summoning him, but I've seen some of these underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well. Well, maybe once."" Buffy goes to rescue her sister, who is sitting in a throne beside the demon in approved Queen of the Underworld style. All ends well, when it turns out that Dawn was not in fact the demon's summoner, and he releases her. But there are echoes of several classical myths in this episode. Dawn plays Persephone, the child bride, (as Anya noted) to Buffy's Demeter, as the mother-surrogate.   So...   Link to the article: http://web.uvic.ca/~lbowman/buffy/buffythehero.html"
buffy,36u27u,MaxisDiedForYourSims,4,Fri May 22 15:19:20 2015 UTC,Actually Demeter is responsible for the seasons too.
buffy,36u27u,ModerateBias,3,Fri May 22 10:38:50 2015 UTC,"demeter is her mother, and ties directly into this story."
buffy,36u27u,JoanCrawford,3,Fri May 22 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"Right - at least one version of the story is that Demeter is so sad when he daughter is in the underworld for 6 months out of every year that the weather becomes cold and harsh. Hence, winter."
buffy,36u27u,Gneissisnice,2,Fri May 22 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Demeter is the one that is responsible for the seasons. She despairs when her daughter is in the underworld and it becomes fall and winter, and when Persephone comes back, she's happy again and it becomes spring and summer.   That has nothing to do with whether Persephone is happily married to Hades or not."
buffy,36u27u,ModerateBias,0,Fri May 22 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"...  if she was happily married she'd be down there year round... and no seasons, only cold.   And you'd get short bursts of warm when she visited...  consistent seasons imply she has no choices in the matter, and thus is not happily married."
buffy,36u27u,BackOfTheHearse,20,Sat May 23 08:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not missing a specific reference or callback. Just a funny line!"
buffy,36u27u,fraac,0,Fri May 22 03:13:55 2015 UTC,How do you know?
buffy,36u27u,YouJellyFish,8,Fri May 22 10:52:21 2015 UTC,There aren't any mentions of child brides beforehand.  The way she says it also makes it fairly clear that the line is just meant to be humorous.
buffy,36u27u,fraac,0,Fri May 22 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"I got the impression it was something Anya had thought about. If it's purely a joke, it's a bit weak."
buffy,36u27u,CJGibson,2,Fri May 22 14:14:48 2015 UTC,It's not a joke intended to make you fall out of your chair laughing.  It's a joke intended to give Anya more character.
buffy,36u27u,fraac,-1,Fri May 22 17:56:12 2015 UTC,I don't get it. What makes you think it isn't a reference to something in the writer's head?
buffy,36u27u,CJGibson,3,Fri May 22 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"It might've been.  It might not've been.  The point is, there's nothing in the show to suggest it's a reference to anything specific.  It's a one-off line that reminds us that Anya is thousands of years old and has seen things that normal people haven't."
buffy,36u27u,fraac,1 point,Fri May 22 18:00:41 2015 UTC,I agree with that. To me it seems like weak writing unless there was a specific instance in mind.
buffy,36u27u,Tiekyl,3,Fri May 22 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. It obviously seemed like a reference to something, even if it's not something from the series itself."
buffy,36u27u,saxman481,3,Fri May 22 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered about this too. I feel like I'm gonna watch some old movie someday in which this type of situation ends well and go ""ohhhhhhh""  And then I'll probably post it here"
buffy,36u27u,-DD,6,Fri May 22 12:13:08 2015 UTC,I figured as a revenge demon she was referencing a time when she helped a child bride get revenge and some how it turned out well for both of them. Like it was just a nod to what she's seen during her career lol
buffy,36u1mw,suzeburbs87,14,Fri May 22 03:00:12 2015 UTC,Is this the final product? Some of the shading looks really good (hands especially) but I feel like there's a lack of depth/detail to the face.

buffy,36rrrc,TOKEN616,60,Thu May 21 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"The reason why Buffy is so good is because Joss wrote flawed characters. Xander is a very flawed character - he's jealous, whiny, brash and unsure of himself (not to mention the whole Anya trainwreck thing). If anything I think that makes him more relatable not less.  As the other guy said, he also has his strengths though, something which was expanded upon in the Zeppo - He's brave, has the capacity to be humble, can relate to other people and always does his best to help even though he knows he's not much in a fight.   As for the age problem, not much I can help you with there - Nick didn't age very well, and makeup can only do so much. As for the great job thing, that was explained pretty well in ""The Replacement"", where he was up for promotion because he had worked there for at least a couple of years and all his best qualities got sent to the job interview. They kind of shyed away from his job after that, but it's implied that once he got some self confidence in his abilities, he was able to climb the ladder quite successfully"
buffy,36rrrc,LogicalChocolate,16,Thu May 21 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like I've read that he was asked to stop working out so much so that his body type fit what the character should be. Like, they realized from the first few seasons he was looking too handsome and fit, so they needed to frump him up a little. Knowing that it was a conscious choice on the part of production makes me think that the lack of sympathy, to some degree, for the character is justified. Like you said, though, that's what makes Whedon's character development so delicious and layered. That's what makes everything from Vampires to the Mayor turning to a giant snake so plausible, because the characters going through it are just so real themselves"
buffy,36rrrc,Mac720,15,Thu May 21 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"I have heard the same thing. Xander is a stand-in for Whedon, who is not a particularly fit-looking individual. And Nick Brendon was a professional athlete. Not necessarily a good match.  I, for one, certainly appreciated when Xander was at his most fit. Rawr."
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,10,Thu May 21 22:46:36 2015 UTC,As did I. I will always think of Go Fish fondly :)
buffy,36rrrc,Mac720,4,Fri May 22 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"It was only for the seasons they were in high school. He got progressively bigger after that and if you see him now, he's pretty jacked.   I don't think it was as big a deal as you make it out to be, actors have done much more drastic things to secure roles (see: Christan Bale in The Machinist)"
buffy,36rrrc,BthreePO,2,Fri May 22 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"High school was when he was in shape, it was the college years that he was chubby, and I actually made the same point about him being jacked now. Just saying that it would take a role having to let yourself go for 4 years as opposed to film roles that are generally for a year at most."
buffy,36rrrc,Sauceykat,0,Sat May 23 07:30:51 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, he was in the best shape in season 5 (working construction will do that), then started to gain weight for season 6 and 7 (when he moved into management).  That makes sense to me, and people in forums keep mentioning how Joss told him he couldn't be sexier than James, but I don't see anyone actually provide proof of Nick even saying that."
buffy,36rrrc,BthreePO,6,Sat May 23 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Replacements went a long way in showing Xander that he had some confidence and ability within him; once slobby train wreck Xander was reunited with suave competent Xander, he used his knew knowledge of himself (and his aced interview) to his advantage."
buffy,36rrrc,AngryWizard,30,Sat May 23 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"Xander is a flawed human being. Which is exactly what makes him so wonderful. In fact, Buffy is flawed. Willow is flawed. And Giles, Anya, Spike and Angel. All of them are imperfect. Each of them has different demons to fight. This is what makes them compelling. Xander loved Anya. Really, he did. He asked her to marry him in a situation where he was sure they would both die. It was an impulsive, romantic gesture. He was not ready to be married, but he didn't know how to get out of it after they had survived. At the Magic Box when Anya was doing her capitalist dance, he saw her as so charming, he felt so in love with her, that he made another impulsive, romantic gesture: he announced to everyone that they were getting married. Now he was even more stuck, even though he had doubts about getting married. His doubts stemmed from watching how his alcoholic parents tore each other apart, day after day, for his entire life. I come from a family that did this. I have never been able to get married, because I don't want to live in the Hell my parents lived in. And Xander would be, literally, marrying a demon. Of course he has doubts! Xander is so afraid of disappointing Anya that he cannot talk to her about his fears of marriage, except in the song he sings in ""Once More With Feeling."" Anya, in turn, has ignored the signs and continued to pressure him into marriage, believing that Xander has normal pre-wedding jitters and not really understanding where he is coming from. She heard the song in OMWT, but she never tries to have a discussion with Xander about their mutual doubts. She is in love, too, and is afraid that if she starts that conversation, she'll end up losing him. The day of the marriage comes, and Xander is shown a scenario that is frighteningly like the one he fears the most. A lifetime of a loveless marriage, in which he has ruined not just his own life, but the life of the woman he loves. So, again impulsively, he walks away. He honestly feels he is doing it for Anya's good. He feels this way, that is, at the moment he does it, but later he realizes how badly he messed up and regrets his decision. This is very, very human. If you have never deeply regretted a decision you've made, you are either very lucky or very young. Xander does not expect Anya to take him back. He begs her to take him back. He tries to explain how he feels, but Anya is so hurt, she can't hear him. This goes on for most of the rest of the series. It is a sad situation, but it is very real. And I wouldn't even describe it as being ""immature"", necessarily. Even older, mature people get into situations where they are trying not to make a mistake and so end up making a bigger one. I know a lot of people blame Xander and hate that he walked away from the wedding. I, personally, really love that part of the story because it is an absolutely real tragedy. These are the types of things that happen in real life, to real people. And this story was brilliantly written and acted. I would not have had it any other way."
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,8,Thu May 21 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"I actually really like this point of view. This is the kind of reply I was hoping someone would provide. Put in that context, I can of course relate, no I am not that young that I have not made decisions that will haunt me. This I can relate to. My issue with him as a character is that these human, relatable moments are far to few. Im not at all saying that his point of view was wrong, im just of the opinion that he should have dealt with these problems earlier.  There are just not enough of these relatable moments throughout the series. Like the maority of the rest of the cast all have their moments where I personally think that they have a situation I understand. I ... I just dont like Xander. But thank you for this comment, it does help me look on the whole wedding situation in a different way"
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,5,Thu May 21 19:51:01 2015 UTC,Keep watching. Xander has one or two beautiful moments left.
buffy,36rrrc,BlackMoonWolf3113,5,Thu May 21 19:59:52 2015 UTC,This is a lovely character analysis of Xander. :)
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,4,Thu May 21 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you, but it barely scratches the surface. Every major character on Buffy could have a whole book written about him or her."
buffy,36rrrc,Kanotari,3,Thu May 21 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I understand that Xander made more than one bad decision, but I really love the reasons behind those decisions that you were able to produce. You're able to articulate it all in a way I never could."
buffy,36rrrc,Erawk,3,Thu May 21 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"I was getting ready to do my usual pro-Xander spiel but you beat me to it, and, if I can steal /u/Kanotari's word, you were much more articulate in doing it.  Nice work."
buffy,36rrrc,krabat-,35,Fri May 22 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"I really like Xander, and I think The Zeppo is one of the best episodes which really shows how Xander feels alienated from the rest of the gang sometimes.  That being said, he could be a real horse's ass, and generally acted like he never grew up, even after landing the management position with the construction firm. He was always super jealous and macho around Spike and Angel. The thing I remember most is when Willow told him to tell Buffy that she would be able to give Angel his soul back, and Xander deliberately lied to her so that she would kill him. He did some really shitty things during the series.  On another note, though, every character had their issues and problems, and none of them were squeaky clean. Willow did try to end the world and Buffy ran away from home, so they all had their hang-ups."
buffy,36rrrc,kscannon,5,Sat May 23 09:07:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, the Zeppo was a good episode and I will admit that episode did make me sympathise his character a little bit. However, that, and I believe there was a couple of other Xander centric episodes, were undermimed by the fact that there was little to no character development otherwise. Sure we see his background, he came from a rough upbringing, but his flaws from season 1 continue right up to season seven. Maybe its just my upbringing and the life I had, but I find it much easier to understand Willow's development from nerd to fitting in, to loss and the eventual desire to end the world, and Buffy's willingness to run away from everything, than Xander's arc. I am not saying he was written badly, but I just find him impossible to relate to as a character. I mentioned it in the post already, but I do really feel he was miscast. Nicholas Brandon looked in season 1 the age he should have been at season 7. Maybe its just the fact im looking at what I perceive to be an ""Adult"", but I am seeing behaviour of someone much younger and that is bugging me.   But in all seriousness, what ""22"" year old holds management of a construction firm?  Thank you for your insight, I am not trying to argue against what you are saying, I put this post up to get insight from people who do like his character and why. Because I am trying so hard to like him, but just cant"
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,14,Thu May 21 17:20:13 2015 UTC,Have you worked in the construction field?  If he is able to do his job well which was proven in the episode he gets split in two. And the company is lacking management then he could easily fill it. You need to understand that there are a lot of stupid people with zero common sense and can only take orders to get stuff done. If he knows the job and can make good decisions then he could be a leader in the company
buffy,36rrrc,kaellynn,8,Thu May 21 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that, in Sunnydale, lots of things need to be re-built all the time, so there is a lot of work, and people frequently die mysteriously, so lots of turnover."
buffy,36rrrc,BthreePO,4,Thu May 21 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest I haven't, I was not aware it was that easy to climb the ladder in that area of work, heck maybe i'm in the wrong field!"
buffy,36rrrc,kscannon,13,Thu May 21 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"I think the job is even more believable when you think about how he relates to Buffy.  He's always the cheerleader or support, which is why he struggled with confidence until the episode where he split into two.  Then, he realizes that he can be a leader too...and he's had the perfect role model for a leader in front of him this whole time!  All he has to do in a sticky situation is apply his construction knowledge + how would buffy handle this, and pull it all together.  Xander is not my favorite character at all, but I think he's a pretty realistic, somewhat jerky, friend."
buffy,36rrrc,kscannon,3,Thu May 21 21:15:35 2015 UTC,You just have to make sure you get into a place where people are constantly dying. That opens things up pretty quickly.
buffy,36rrrc,tif2shuz,1 point,Thu May 21 22:17:54 2015 UTC,There are a lot of ifs and by no means are you in the wrong field.

I Do not think it's too far fetched at all that he is a manager in the construction job. If anything its really good for his character, because he found what he does best and his own career path without attending college. Which, in my opinion, is refreshing to see"
buffy,36rrrc,Tiekyl,2,Thu May 21 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"His career isn't really that hard to believe. A friend of mine didn't finish high school, went into landscaping and then onto construction working as a carpenter/framer. He got his GED and became head framer and then eventually a foreman at a residential construction company before he was 25 doing pretty much the same thing Xander is at the end of the show.  Obviously his story doesn't happen everyday, but it isn't unheard of either."
buffy,36rrrc,bright_ephemera,18,Mon May 25 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"ive worked in construction and its not too weird.. plus hes just in charge of parts of a jobsite as we see in the episodes with the trio messing with buffy.  i think hes pretty tame as far as being an ass if you consider his real life competition.  xanders biggest flaw is that he is possessive of the women he is friends with sometimes. he doesnt tell buffy about angel getting his soul back.  personally i think xanders decision to call off the wedding was the right one.  i have more complaints about the fact that anya is a materialistic shrew who only cares about herself. last i checked xander didnt slaughter endless amounts of innocents in the name of ""vengeance"" and also not trying to actively gain that power back and kill someone they supposedly love just because they dont want to have a arbitrary ceremony that was picked up as a necessity by anya trying to feel like a real woman, or her version of what a real woman should be...  i hate when people try to say xander is mean to anya... the meanest thing he did was lead her on while she was clearly not ready to be a human being let alone be in a relationship as one. thats what i fault xander for.. but in no way do i see him as the bad guy in that situation. hes just stupid and immature. which comes from having drunken fighting parents i presume (experience)  its ok for everyone in the show to have shit talked to their face because they are a murderer even while they are making amends (andrew, angel, spike etc) but anya doesnt get it that often at all and when she does its by willow or xander and its very harmless"
buffy,36rrrc,Amadan,18,Sat May 23 22:05:31 2015 UTC,xanders biggest flaw is that he is possessive of the women he is friends with sometimes. he doesnt tell buffy about angel getting his soul back.   This is honestly one of my biggest peeves with him.  I don't think I ever quite forgave him for that.
buffy,36rrrc,Arancaytar,8,Thu May 21 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"To me, Xander not telling Buffy about the ensoulment is absolutely consistent with who Xander is. On the one hand, he is very protective of his friends, and he never liked having a vampire around, even before anyone knew about Angelus. He could not trust a vampire (he never trusted Spike, either), and once he knew about Angelus, this mistrust grew astronomically. Xander really believed that it was better for Buffy if Angel were out of her life for good, soul or no soul. On top of that was the petty jealousy of a very young man who sees a taller, more handsome, more self-assured guy get the girl he wants. Part of his decision to to not tell Buffy about the soul was purely selfish. It may not be Xander's most redeeming moment, but it was absolutely consistent with his character."
buffy,36rrrc,madjoy,5,Thu May 21 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"i can relate to it, but seeing him do it makes me realize how wrong it is and i actively try to overcome this primitive feeling. its very hard"
buffy,36rrrc,strawberryf1elds,3,Thu May 21 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never  forgave him either. That just crossed a line in my eyes. Fine, be overly protective and biased, but lying to your friends to make sure it goes the way you think it should? It even made me retroactively like him less in previous episodes."
buffy,36rrrc,BloodyAwfulPoet,2,Thu May 21 18:10:45 2015 UTC,Oddly enough I think that 'kick his ass' thing was one of his best character moments in the entire show.
buffy,36rrrc,Howardzend,1 point,Fri May 22 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"It is very much in-character. But I just don't like that character that much, precisely because (among other reasons) of the fact that that scene is in-character."
buffy,36rrrc,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu May 21 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"Not passing on Willow's message was in my opinion at least on part a coldly pragmatic judgment, and not just fueled by jealousy or hatred for Angel.  Xander believes (with some justification) that the ritual is a long shot at best, and also that Buffy's feelings for Angel may cause her to make tactical errors. If Buffy holds back because she's waiting for the ritual, she puts the whole world at risk. So he decides that giving her that hope would be a dangerous distraction.  It's ethically gray, but in the same way that Giles killing Ben was. (Aside from Ben's final face-heel-turn, which Giles didn't know about.)"
buffy,36rrrc,BloodyAwfulPoet,2,Fri May 22 08:39:21 2015 UTC,"But then how can he be so unsympathetic - and not express any remorse - at the beginning of next season, when he KNOWS what she went through (partially as a result of his actions or lack thereof)?"
buffy,36rrrc,BloodyAwfulPoet,5,Fri May 22 11:23:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, I take your point. However Anya was clearly on the road to redemption. I think you are being a bit harsh on her character here. Out of interest, what is your take on Angel and Spike? They have a less than perfect past, but their past transgressions are overlooked in general. I know the wedding was not supposed to happen but I think Xander should have said something earlier. The expectation that everything would return to normal after that was a bit much. I'm not at all saying Xander was totally the problem, but I can not sympathise with him after Anya's session with Spike. What she did was not nice, but he can not make it personal after his actions."
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,6,Fri May 22 14:45:05 2015 UTC,"You think that Angel and Spike's transgressions are overlooked? I think the defining story for both of those characters is their struggle to overcome their past and achieve redemption for themselves and in the eyes of the people around them...both work incredibly hard to overcome their past transgressions and are constantly reminded of their history, at least the way I see it."
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,4,Thu May 21 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"And Likewise, much of Anyas season 3-6 arc was coming to terms with being human. She tried to overcome her past mistakes, and yes I know she seemed selfish and liked to make things about herself, but at the end of the day, she made the best of what she had too. As I am starting season 7, it seems that Anya has returned to her Vengeance ways (Which Is a development that I am not happy with!), but didn't Spike go to Africa in the season 6 finale in the hopes of returning to his vampire ways too? I thought that returning his soul was a fantastic twist.  OR maybe that was his intention all along and maybe I interpreted the finale incorrectly? Whatever the case may be, I dont think Anyas demon past is very relevant towards the end of her and Xander's arc"
buffy,36rrrc,catdoctor,11,Thu May 21 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"Spike's intention was always to get his soul back, they deliberately left it ambiguous in order to misdirect people about his intent."
buffy,36rrrc,DaddyCatALSO,3,Thu May 21 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I did not pick up on that when I watched it. So I will say that was some good writing on the writers part"
buffy,36rrrc,Amadan,7,Thu May 21 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Season 7 will give you more clarity on Spike's soul and Anya evil ways.  Enjoy.    On topic, I tend to agree with you about Xander.  He does have some more redeeming moments in season 7 but overall, he was my least favorite scooby.  And I adored Anya even with her materialistic stuff.  I mean, after centuries of torturing men, materialism just isn't that big of a deal.  Also, she genuinely loved Xander though I will never understand why."
buffy,36rrrc,LarsP,6,Thu May 21 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"The writers have saidSspike was seeking his soul intentionally. They've also said they wrote it so we wouldn't think that. in doing that, they over-did it with stuff like ""Make me what I was."" Which can logically only mean unchipped or human"
buffy,36rrrc,kaellynn,5,Thu May 21 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"Did they? I was not aware of that so thank you for that insight. It was a great twist, one of the few times I paused an episode thinking ""Hold up a second, what??"". I really think this is a fantastically written show and even though this is my first watch through, I do look forward to rewatching the whole thing as there is bound to be a lot of things I did not pick up on first time round!"

buffy,36rrrc,DaddyCatALSO,4,Thu May 21 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Anya didn't just sleep with another guy. This would have hurt and angered Xander, but Anya slept with a vampire! Xander has always hated and mistrusted vampires. To him, this is a cardinal sin. Imagine if your SO didn't just cheat on you, but slept with the skankiest drug dealer/murderer/child molester they could find. That's the equivalent, in Xander's mind."
buffy,36rrrc,rbwildcard,2,Thu May 21 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"i can understand.. knowing intellectually and logically that youre wrong rarely stops someone from lashing out in time of traumatic stress like finding the person you love fucking another man who is less than respectable  anya spends years rejecting the notion that being human is something she wants to do.. she was a murderer for way longer and caused more harm than both spike and angel..  so yeah xander is a hypocrite and a lot of things, but i blame him more for BEING with anya than leaving her"
buffy,36rrrc,LaunchpadMacQ,3,Thu May 21 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"Ok I will play devils advocate for a minute here, Anya was hurt initially, hence her reason for becoming a vengeance demon initially, BUT she was only carrying out the wishes of other women scorned. Was she the murderer, or were the people who summoned her to blame?   I think, and it may or may not be the best way to look at it, that Anya's past is her past and does not really come into play with her and Xander's relationship. It would be relevant if she continued as a demon while seeing him, but it did not.   I personally think the pair of them were the best couple on the show, and that he should have said something sooner regarding his marriage reservations. I do not think him being with her was the problem at all.  BUT as I said the reason for this post was just to see people's general perception towards him as a character, so thank you for our input."
buffy,36rrrc,RivetheadGirl,2,Thu May 21 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"first of all, the first thing she did when she got her powers back was make a wish against xander even though it failed(painful death). then she went around to everyone who knows xander and tried to get them to do the same.   saying its not her fault if these people get hurt is a bit much since she wants the power to do these things in the first place, every step it was her decision, in fact they took her power away because she was TOO destructive. a demon order decided she was too destructive and irresponsible.  also she laughed when she talked about the guy she turned into a giant worm.  the first human interaction anya has with xander and the first 3 times she has an interaction with the scoobies she mentions that the only reason she is doing anything ""normal"" is that shes powerless and she would otherwise be killing them"
buffy,36rrrc,TheBlackHive,2,Thu May 21 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Very true; it's just a lot of us, particularly those who saw it play out in the original seasons, developed a strong sympathy for and liking of Anya, and don't hold  the relationship with her against Xander, except for the jilting. simple fact is, no matter how scared eh was, now that he's reminded of his family weaknesses, he can keep them in mind and not be bound to act the way the light show showed."

buffy,36u1ll,yallcat,2,Fri May 22 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"Where is it said she was a Nun? It's been a good 6 or so years since I've watched through the show so some of my details are rusty.   ""The Sisters of Mercy was a Catholic order of nuns. In 1860, a young, nearly insane woman named Drusilla seeked refuge with at their convent after the vampire Angelus murdered her entire family. On the Day Drusilla was to take her vows, Angelus invaded the convent and killed all the sisters before turning Drusilla.""  I see where she sought safety."
buffy,36u1ll,faaackksake,6,Fri May 22 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"At some later point Angelus tortured and killed Drusilla's entire family, causing her to flee to a convent in Prague. On the day she was to take her holy vows, Angelus made her watch as he killed every person in the convent and engaged in sexual relations with Darla. The trauma of Angelus's atrocities drove Drusilla insane, and Angelus chose to turn her into a vampire, as he considered her a masterpiece, a testament to his talent. Believing death to be a mercy to her at this point, he chose to sire her to make her pain eternal as an immortal."
buffy,36u1ll,DaddyCatALSO,6,Fri May 22 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"""On the day she was to take her vows,"" so she wasn't a nun but was less than a day from becoming one."
buffy,36u1ll,catdoctor,2,Fri May 22 12:11:31 2015 UTC,Nun the less she was almost a nun. Wakka wakka.
buffy,36u1ll,GinaZaneburritos,2,Fri May 22 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"we see a scene in flashbacks of angelus first encounter with drusilla (can't remember if it's in BTVS or ATS) but in it we see drusilla confessing to a 'priest' in the confessional (it's actually angelus who has just finished eating the priest) about being a clairvoyant and how she thinks it's evil and how her mother has said it's evil and she needs to repent etc, that's when angelus becomes interested in her and starts to torment her, killing her family, which drives her to the convent, where, on the day she's to take her holy vows, he murdered everyone in the convent and raped drusilla on the altar, which drove her insane. so yes, she wasn't a nun when angelus first went after her, but we know that she wasn't a gypsy, she was the daughter of a wealthy family in england, we get a pretty clear understanding of drusillas origins throughout,  we get a better view of the kind of person she was in the comics; spoilers for comics"
buffy,36u1ll,Enzown,2,Sun May 24 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"Which is totally inaccurate. Romany follow what they perceive to be the religion of the place they're in, Catholic, Orthodox or Muslim -a lot in US-Canada have become Pentecostal. 9and not all paganism is Goddess Worship.) The show isn't meant to reflect reality."
buffy,36u1ll,beccad93,2,Fri May 22 12:23:17 2015 UTC,not totally inaccurate just exaggerated.. much like the show did. it is copy/pasted from wiki after all.  so in that case they would move them more towards the occult sects of gypsy because of the nature of the show.  certainly anyone who believed in magic wouldnt become a devout nun
buffy,36u1ll,Beloit,3,Fri May 22 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"No. Drusilla had a family in England. We see the story of how Angel finds her and, eventually, sires her in ""Angel."""

buffy,36nif9,faaackksake,14,Wed May 20 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"i have to say i disagree about her horror movies, i mean i know what you did last summer is a classic 90's movie and a great pastiche of slasher flicks (although i guess it's not post buffy), the grudge overall was a serviceable remake of the original (which i love) i thought she was really good in it but the other elements of the film didn't quite hang together, similarly that film 'the return' ( i think it was called) i thought she was great in, but the film overall wasn't great, despite a good performance from her, in both cases i think the movies had a lot of potential and failed to deliver despite SMGs good work. I do think she's been unlucky with a few films that could've been really great. That said i absolutely love her in cruel intentions (the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side), she;s good in the rom com/drama with alec baldwin too, best film i've seen her in though is definitely Veronika Decides to Die, it's based on the paulo coehlo book (one of my favourites) and she's just so great in it, it's probably the most serious dramatic film i've seen her in and she totally becomes the role. Although i'm a bit of a fanboy for SMG so she can do little wrong in my eyes :P  also sidenote; not cool guys, don't downvote /u/DaddyCatAlso for expressing an opinion you disagree with, our community is too sweet for that."

The gang is back together and working like a well-oiled machine, Buffy is growing as a woman, Spike is growing as a souled vampire, and I'm digging this current direction the story is heading. I've always found the Aurelius family lineage to be interesting and have wondered many times in the past ""Soooo who DID sire the Master?""   Right now, I just don't want to see the writing team fall flat on the motivation behind this big bad. What does Archaeus get from Spike and Angel and what's his endgame? And why now?"

I love seeing that Joss and his some of his original writing crew are still very much involved in the overall story being told. A lot of people online have been complaining about the Buffy/Spike shipping, saying the only reason it's happening is because Joss has had very little involvement. That doesn't appear to be the case as major plot lines seem to be approved by him first during their writing summits."

Maybe since it involved creating another universe, the pendant needed to be attached to Cordelia to still exist? Still doesn't really work.   For the first part, I didn't see Giles lose it at any point, he just didn't realize it had any magical properties until the end. It was probably at his apartment the whole time after they took it off of Cordelia's body."
buffy,36jo23,wowyesokay,12,Tue May 19 22:59:16 2015 UTC,I always kinda love how Anya started the Russian Revolution and has spent over a thousand years loyally wreaking havoc in the name of vengeance but then one day her pendant breaks and suddenly D'Hoffryn's over her. It's very silly.
buffy,36jo23,heymeowmeow,7,Wed May 20 01:29:17 2015 UTC,Who knows?  Maybe he was just in a bad mood and/or felt like punishing her for her carelessness?   It seemed like he could be fairly capricious and arbitrary at times.  Remember what he did to Halfrek in S7?
buffy,36jo23,dbutlerjr,4,Wed May 20 12:35:16 2015 UTC,I think it also kinda ties into the trope Joss likes to play with of being bound by arbitrary ancient laws even though we are in modern times.

As for Anya giving the pendant to Cordelia, that's definitely a mystery. What's weird is that, in later wishes and with other vengeance demons, the wishers don't seem to need to wear the pendant to make it work. However, ""The Wish"" is the only episode in which someone wishes for an entire alternate reality/timeline shift. It's possible a wish that big requires other rules. However, there's absolutely no way Anya would've known what Cordy's wish was going to be when she gave her the pendant, so even that theory isn't particularly strong."
buffy,36jo23,clockworklycanthrope,1 point,Thu May 21 04:47:30 2015 UTC,"I also think its weird how Halfrek was able to push Buffy and Anya away from her pendant with magic when they tried to take it from her 'body', but Anya didn't seem to have any telekinesis in her fights with Giles, Spike and Buffy."

buffy,36hnsi,Enzown,3,Wed May 20 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"Pedantic point of clarification-- Angel was sired by Darla, not the other way around.  The section for season 1, ep 7 ""Angel"" currently says:     Angel's first kill is Darla, the woman he sired.     And you might want to re-jigger the wording on Graduation day part 2, which seems like it has the remnants of a previous phrasing on the end.    Harmony gets vamped--becomes a very incompetent vampire ever.     Anyway, this is a very cool chart! Thanks for taking the time to put it together."

buffy,36g10u,buffylove,3,Wed May 20 08:54:51 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel the same. Partly, I just like her having relationships. All of them are interesting, when viewing them from her position. Even boring old Riley. They each bring something different to her personality. But I don't think she's done baking yet. I don' think Buffy is cookies, and I don't think any of her loves have been ""the one"", or whatnot. But I think she needed to be with each of them.  I do think that Angel thought she was ""the one"" for him, but gradually learns that isn't the case.  I don't think Riley ever really saw a full-fledged future with Buffy once her learned about her Slayer-ness.  I do think that Spike completely believed she was ""the one"" for him. And that may have never changed. But by the end, he knows that even if he feels that way, she doesn't. And the man inside the monster couldn't force that. So unlike Angel, he didn't grow away, he turned away for her sake."
buffy,36g10u,TheDylanJacobson,4,Thu May 21 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Which makes Spike, in the end, the best man who loved Buffy in the series. Angel lets her go, but Spike, gets his soul back for her, he burns in Hell AND he lets he go."

buffy,36g10u,maggie92x3,6,Wed May 20 06:30:59 2015 UTC,Same here. Buffy and angel scenes for me ended up just being like really melodramatic and just repetitive. I used to really like angel and buffy together but I'm definitely more spike and buffy now
buffy,36g10u,tif2shuz,2,Mon May 25 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"Spike challenges her and pushes her to her limits,  something Angel never did.   Angels soul was meant to curse his eternal life and his love for buffy wasn't supposed to happen or be some kind of reward,  thats why he can never have true happiness with her.   Spike fought to have his soul restored (though at the time he didn't know that'd what he was fighting for)  he was fighting to bring back that part of himself that ""Buffy deserved"".   Angel never fought to have his soul restored (unless you count that freaky memory lane trip with faith in season 4).   Not to mention that even ensouled Angel still killed/let an innocent man die just so he could feed and showed no remorse for the act.  Yet Spike was racked with guilt over the deaths he caused while under the influence of the first.     All the time I hear about how ""the rape scene""  ruined their view of spike,  but most people don't see it from his perspective.   I saw a comic strip once (I wish I could find it and link it so you can see it and see where I'm coming from) that made a valid point of that scene.   Their entire sexual relationship, Buffy was always saying ""no""  and ""never gonna happen""  to Spikes advances and then turning around and sleeping with him anyways.   So in Spikes eyes,  the whole thing up until she kicks him across the room and looks at him with tears,  was like every other encounter.   That look of absolute shock and horror on his face when he realized what he almost did,  that was real to him.   He never wanted to hurt Buffy and realizing he did is why he left town."
buffy,36g10u,Starlite85,2,Wed Jun 3 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was one scene for me that was a real bummer. I don't like that spike was made to rape Buffy, it just tarnished their love story a bit"

Too many shows force a pairing and make that the ""happily ever after,"" but it's just not realistic. Buffy ending the show single was great, and a really bold move by the showrunners. Buffy and Spike were super passionate about one another, BUT it seemed like a codependency thing. Not good, long-term."

I dream of his cheekbones and his abs and his smirk. But I never thought he was a good long-term partner for Buffy. Neither, for that matter, was Angel. And neither did Buffy, at the end. The ""cookie dough"" speech makes clear that she has not decided yet and that there needs to be more of Buffy before she can choose a life partner. I prefer to think that the man who finally pairs up with Buffy is one we have not met on the show, or in the comics.  He is strong, and supportive, and smart. He is sexy and warm and funny. He is human, too, and can grow old with Buffy. In short, he is perfect for her."

Their relationship in that episode does have a different feel to it, like they are on a more even ground, than it did in the early seasons of Buffy.  Angel also becomes a happier, more fleshed out character after moving to LA."

From that moment on she became a workaholic, practicing every day for hours, even in the backyard. Her big break could have come with her role as a young Victoria Principal in Mistress (1987), but the producers edited her part out of the film. Her main breakthrough came in 1991, when she was picked by Prince to dance with him for the ""Diamonds and Pearls"" album. A single from the album went to #1 and Robia was pictured on the cover.  Robia went on to appear in more than thirty music videos before Prince pursued her to play the role of ""Pearl"" on his hit album ""Diamonds & Pearls.""   There is also this awesome tidbit:   At the age of sixteen Robia began to work professionally. Her first job was the music video ""Shake Your Love"" by Debbie Gibson.

ETHROS DEMON: Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? (eye to eye with Angel) Nothing. That's what I found in the boy. No conscience, no fear, no humanity. Just a black void. I couldn't control him. I couldn't get out; I never even manifested until you brought me forth. I just sat in him and watched as he destroyed everything around him. Not from a belief in evil, not for any reason at all. That boy's mind was the blackest hell I've ever known.   I don't know if he's the best case for determining what a soulless human would look like - there's nothing human about him, not exactly.  As /u/AngelAmongUs pointed out, when Buffy was in the process of losing her soul in ""Living Conditions,"" she was still ""Buffy."" She was simply exhibiting more of her self-centered, headstrong, violent, and remorseless side.

buffy,36as7f,bwburke94,3,Mon May 18 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"ive heard peple argue that this flies in the face of spikes nobility and how he overcame his vampirism. but i disagree... i feel there is multiple ways to overcome vampirism.... not having a soul to begin with and/or (in the case of spike) being so in touch with ur soul that you can strive to get it back and/or have a piece of it left to give you a semblance of being human.  however i have always been of the faction that believes spike was only able to strive for a soul because he was sired by angel(through drusilla) and there was something bout angel that carried over into spike that made them special.  spike wound up being more human(but less of a champion, imho) because he actually WANTED his soul  but he also tried to rape buffy so i have problems with all this.  regardless of the fact that im drunk right now..  buffy shows how very different everyone is and how complex lives and personalities are common.  labels dont fit everyone"
buffy,36as7f,catdoctor,2,Mon May 18 07:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the idea that Spike was good only because he was connected to Angel. It makes no sense, because Spike was sired and mentored by Angelus (not Angel), the cruelest, most sadistic vampire ever. Spike was able to become good because, despite being a vampire and losing his soul, he never lost his capacity to love, and to love deeply. It was his love for Buffy that eventually drove him to want to be good and to want to get his soul back. His redemption is all on him, not at all related to Angel."
buffy,36as7f,bwburke94,1 point,Tue May 19 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"angel has proven repeatedly through prophecies and through his actions that he is not only more than just a man and vampire, there is something about him that goes beyond what i would say a normal vampire would be like if he/she got their soul back. i mean hes clearly not a normal vampire without a soul either.  i think back to when giles let willow take his power and it made her good... the powers that be clearly saw something in angel to move him (like a chess piece) into position to become this ruthless monster that could not be matched to later become a champion of mankind.  whatever way they did it, i feel like its the only way to explain it with the lore instead of trying to justify it by trying to say spike never lost his capacity to love.  even dru said ""we can love quite well"" and we also had another vampire be burned by the judge because of the humanity still in him.  now if we want to say that many vampires have this attribute and spike and angel are the only ones to actually overcome it to the point of doing something about it, whether it be post or pre-soul, then its not only a very large coincidence but maybe there is another factor at work.  the only other thing i have thought of for this is buffy. she is just so special that she actually compels these ""men"" to better themselves for one reason or another.  ive also thought that maybe the chip DID psychologically train spike to be more human and therefore open a door for his humanity to walk through.  also it could be all of this together, witch is likely the case.  :) i do consider your point of view as a possibility i just see it as less of a possibility"

This episode and ""To Shanshu in L.A."" also bring up the possibility of Lindsey's redemption; in the end he re-commits himself to Wolfram & Hart - as Angel says, he ""made the wrong choice.""  As for Lilah, she has this conversation with Angel in ""Sleep Tight"":   Lilah: It's a survival thing. I made a lot of devil's bargains and I stuck to them. As a result, I live somewhat dangerously, and quite comfortably. My mother, who no longer recognizes me, has the best room at the clinic. I get up every morning, put on my game face and do what I have to.  Angel: Thing about a game face, Lilah, you wear it long enough, it stops being something you can put on and take off.  Lilah: Wow. We've spent so much time and money on you. You're so pivotal to the coming cataclysm, that I sometimes forget how dense you can be. The game face - the one I worked so hard to get - I became that years ago. Just like you've become simpering and good from yours. You're the new poster boy for human. Thank you very much. I don't want it.   They're still human and still have their souls - over the years, they've just gotten very good at resisting their souls' moral compass.  It's also worth pointing out that just having a soul doesn't make one a good person. After all, Warren had a soul, and he not only killed people but showed no remorse or empathy for them at all."

Rather, it's like your mind and body are rewired so that you yourself 'become' a demon, but only insofar as anyone can become evil...you've just had an added unavoidable push. It explains why Angel still feels remorse for what he did without a soul and how Spike can show restraint and do good without a soul and be more or less the same person (with pretty much the same emotions) after being resouled. And why Harmony had the exact personality. The 'you are completely dead and your body is possessed by an evil from another dimension' is a convenient lie by the Watchers, people might hesitate to do what is necessary if they aren't given a black/white good/evil paradigm."

buffy,36as7f,heimdal77,13,Mon May 18 13:43:29 2015 UTC,spoilers Angel  I feel that basic premise is explored fairly well with Fred and illiria in season 5 of Angel. Not exactly the same situation but enough of the same basic premise of a good hearted sweet and loving individual being taken over by a dark force that you can kind of see where it could go.

buffy,369g9s,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun May 17 14:16:38 2015 UTC,1 point for you :) !
buffy,369g9s,buffanater,15,Mon May 18 10:59:31 2015 UTC,"weekly episode notes   1 the narrator is not Giles. The narrator sounds like he's doing a commercial. 2 Darla. Her character takes seasons and a spin-off series to tell everything about her. We get some great foreshadowing in this episode. Her relationship with Angel and the Master, things that Angel and her did years ago, the fact that she misses Angelus and her disgust with Angel for refusing to fall back on Angelus. 3 maybe it's just because they weren't presented very well, but the three just don't seem to be a problem. One fight they kinda loose, and bam! They're dusted. Not once in their supposedly ""legendary"" run did they slip up? 4 thank goodness Buffy says ""get in! Come on!"" To Angel as they run into her house. Other wise, that would have been awkward.  5 Angel's tattoo is almost never mentioned again. Not that I remember anyway.  6 Angel really opens up to Buffy. Talking about his parents and some of the other things he did. He rarely does that with the Angel investigations group.  7 Xander's jealousy levels are off the charts this episode. This is also the first time of many he'll use the argument that Angel's a vampire, and Buffy slays vampires.  8 Xander does make a valid point though about demons. They are evil. We see that some demons are good, but most are evil. Later in the series and especially the comics, it seems like killing a demon is bad. Early on there wasn't as many ""good"" demons.  9 I love the theory that Cordy is actually fully aware of what Buffy is up to early on before officially joining the scoobys. In this episode it seems like she heard them talking about vamps. But when they turn to her to try and cover up what they're talking about she seems completely unaware of them and more concerned with what dress another student is wearing.  10 more vamps should have used guns.  11 I wonder how many days were in between Angel dusting Darla and him and Buffy kissing at the Bronze."
buffy,369g9s,Enzown,7,Sun May 17 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"Also, Xander showcases some sick dance moves."
buffy,369g9s,The_Ripper42,2,Sun May 17 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"In reply to some of your points.   I think they made a mistake dusting Darla so early (though it was 5 episodes later then first planned). Given her importance to Angel she should have been a more recurring character. Imagine the love-triangle stuff they could have done in season 2. The Three did not live up to the billing as a great threat at all, I'm thinking their dusting was a way of building up the threat of The Master instead. I don't think season one Cordy had the awareness of others to know or care about what anyone other than herself was up to. This is a rare occurrence of Angel actually dusting a vamp. He kills very few during his time on Buffy."
buffy,369g9s,theperfectend,3,Mon May 18 07:16:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm glad that love triangle never happened. This early version of Darla definitely isn't my favorite.
buffy,369g9s,Bellevert,2,Tue May 19 12:57:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like that happens a few times, there's some uber bad that we should be very worried about then Buffy takes 2 seconds to kill it after half an hour of build up.   The tattoo is seen again during season 3 (I just rewatch that season,  that's why it sprung to mind) but yeah it's never really talked about."

In a way Darla is the most technologically sophisticated vampire in Buffyverse with her dual wielding guns. Trick talked big about an Uzi smg, but he died trying to bite a Slayer.

buffy,369g9s,buffanater,5,Wed May 20 14:30:05 2015 UTC,Angel seems to have lied. We see in flashbacks that he had in fact fed off of humans since that day.

They definitely made her vamp face and vamp teeth much better in her post season 1 appearances; Darla seemed to have trouble talking around those teeth in this episode.

Edit: ""FISH GOTTA SWIM, BIRDS GOTTA FLY""!! (sorry, I should wait until I finish watching and then post, but I just got really excited)  Xander just quoted Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle."
buffy,369g9s,The_Ripper42,3,Sun May 17 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to quash your excitement, but I'm pretty sure that the reference is to the lyrics of ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"".  To me, it kind of introduces more fully the idea that Angel's nature is something fundamentally dark and that his cravings are an inescapable part of him.   GILES: There's no record but . . . vampires hunt and kill, it's what they do.  XANDER: Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.   It's also a love song - one where love for someone is something portrayed as literally a force of nature.  Despite the warnings she has received, Buffy is falling head first into something that she knows is unnatural - but it feels natural to her.   JOYCE: Touche'. Do you want to hear the lecture or do you know it by heart?  BUFFY: You were young, you were in love, what you weren't was through with college, focused on a career and . . . no help from the audience, please, in possession of your own identity.   I think this passage could refer equally well to Buffy.  As for Angel's nature - he wants to kiss Buffy, but when he does he can't contain his bloodlust and goes into vamp-face. When he kisses her at the end, he ignores the burning of her cross into his flesh.  It may just be that I'm more familiar with ""Show Boat"" than with Vonnegut, though. :)"
buffy,369g9s,buffybot_bot,3,Sun May 17 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"Ahhh maybe. Vonnegut is ""tiger's gotta hunt, bird's gotta fly"", not ""fish gotta swim"", so you must be right."
buffy,367trl,Chibit3r,68,Sun May 17 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Everytime he gets arrested again I wonder what his family has tried to do for him (especially Kelly since we've seen him in Buffy, but he has 2 more brothers too). Maybe he doesn't want their help. And it's not like he's a kid fucking up, he's a 43 year old man. A 43 year old man who in this report passed out and wet himself, and in the last report had pooped himself. It's really sad and weird watching this continue, and I think we all know how this will end if nothing changes.   Not being an alcoholic, it's difficult for me to understand why he doesn't stay home so he can smash stuff and pass out and soil himself in private as much as he wants. I'm no model for mental health myself, I have crippling anxiety that makes it hard to leave my house, so my instinct would be to try to keep this stuff private and out of the papers."
buffy,367trl,AngryWizard,19,Sun May 17 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Alcoholic here, alcoholism is often a symptom of other problems and not actually THE problem.  I'm never late for work and my bills are never late. I don't get into fights and I've never been arrested. I don't shit myself or piss the bed. Worst case scenario I wake up with a new haircut or a clean room and it's a bit of a surprise for a minute or so.  But I do steady have 10 beers a day if not 15."
buffy,367trl,nutbastard,13,Sun May 17 10:42:20 2015 UTC,"See this another example of what I couldn't wrap my head around. I see Nick at cons doing photos with fans like a normal person, then I see his mugshots and read the accompanying arrest reports and can't put these two nicks together.   Likewise I see nutbastard making coherent comments on Buffy that I upvote often, and am taken aback to find out that you're an alcoholic who's not unfamiliar with blackouts yourself and it's difficult to put the two nutbastards together.   I hope that's not terribly offensive and thank you for sharing. I really wanted to try to understand better why he keeps going out, and how he justifies to himself repeating the same actions with the same results. I'm lucky that alcohol doesn't interest me and makes me have panic attacks. I wish the best for you nb if you ever decide to make a change (well, I wish the best for you either way)."
buffy,367trl,AngryWizard,17,Sun May 17 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"I hope that's not terribly offensive and thank you for sharing.   No no, you're good. For example, I'm now... 10 beers in and about to go to bed. Blackouts are actually quite rare for me but I am familiar with them. There's just some sort of panicky thing that happens if I don't have beer handy if I'm not working. Sometimes I don't drink it all, sometimes I do. Most of the time I do. Which is why I buy my beer right before the cut off - so I have a limited supply. And I'm far too embarrassed to go and buy more at 7am... the vast majority of the time anyway.  Alcoholism for me is just a daily thing. I don't go off the rails, I don't go wild. I just sustain.  And as you can see, even 10 beers doesn't screw with my ability to type and articulate myself. But I'd be lying if I said it's not a monkey on my back.  What Mr. Brendon is going through is almost certainly the result of combination drug use. Me and a 12 pack? No problem. Me and a six pack and a xanax? Scrape me off the sidewalk.  My guess is that he has anxiety issues and way, way overdoes what he thinks will help. Couple beers, that'll loosen me up, eh why not a 1/3 xanax, FFW an hour and it's the other 2/3's and 2 more beers and then whammo. Gone. Autopilot with zero capacity to process social cues or create memories, short term or long.  For some people - me included - we just can't hang with drugs at our disposal. And if you aren't sapient enough to flush them down the toilet and fix your shit when things go wrong, that's a recipe for disaster.  It's even worse if you can afford it. It's the one reason my dad always gave for never trying coke in the 80's - at the time he was rolling in cash. A literal millionaire for a minute. And he always said, ""I was afraid that I would like it, and I knew I could afford it""  I'm the kind of person who absolutely cannot own cocaine. Because I'll do it all. And then I'll buy more. But in the 20 or so times I've done coke, not once was I able to 'save' any for another time, no matter how much I intended to when the night started. I'm the motherfucker that will pick through the carpet thinking I've found a rock that might maybe be a weak ass bump.  So I stay away from that shit like uncoordinated people stay away from dirt bikes.  But beer, sweet glorious beer, it's right there. All the time. And I keep it mellow. But It's definitely a habit if not a full blown addiction."
buffy,367trl,nutbastard,6,Sun May 17 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he has anxiety issues and way, way overdoes what he thinks will help.    This is my guess, too. He probably doesn't have internal/personal coping mechanisms developed to deal with his issues, so he uses unhealthy substances to quiet whatever he's feeling.  The fact that this keeps happening before cons makes me think it is also some sort of social anxiety. And my guess is that it works for him 9 times out of 10. He probably drinks a little before a con to calm his fears and loosen himself up, goes out and sees people, and goes back home. The fact that it works most of the time keeps him returning to it despite the times it doesn't.  Of course, that's just conjecture. But if it is the case he either needs to stop doing the con circuit (if that's triggering his issues) or wait to resume them until after he's been clean for a while and learned healthier ways of coping with his triggers."
buffy,367trl,czerniana,1 point,Sun May 17 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"Like a normal person   I think that's where the confusion sets in.  He isn't just a normal guy.  He's a guy that is forced in front of millions of fans all year long at conventions, and sometimes gets an acting gig, but mostly not.  I'm sure there are a lot of issues to work out because of it.  As someone who has severe depression, anxiety, and has a history of addiction, I can see how his brain could need alcohol.  Alcoholism isn't logical, it's... soothing?  You get to the point where that's your happy place and you don't know where any other happy places are.  And don't trust when you're told someone or something IS said happy place.   Alcoholism is definitely not his real problem.  And that won't get better until he addresses it.  I really hope his family can help him.  If they don't want to, send him out to me and I'll set him straight xD"
buffy,367trl,HarlequinNight,29,Sat May 23 03:03:19 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is, lots of alcoholics can do their thing without the need to adventure into public and interact with the rest of the sane populace. The exception of course is people traveling between/from bars.  What we see here is certainly some type of interaction effect. The man is taking painkillers, sleeping pills, or something else, in addition to large quantities of alcohol. These are like blackout style, sleep walk adventures. Very much a Dr. Jekyl / Mr Hyke kinda transformation into a babbling maniac that he probably has faint or zero recollection of.

buffy,367trl,comfortable_madness,9,Sun May 17 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"My neighbor/landlord is an alcoholic. He's been to jail twice, had his license revoked, and spent two years on probation and attended state required AA meetings for 6 months. He's wrecked multiple vehicles, had two wives and several girlfriends leave him...   He's one of those alcoholics that can be totally functional to a certain point, even fun to be around. Then he passes that point and becomes violent and belligerent, especially towards women. He beat his last wife constantly, pushing her to the point of trying to stab him in his sleep. He's made drunken passes at me, called me at 3 in the morning wanting me to come ""hang out"" then getting mad when I say no and accuses me if being the one to call him.   Back when it began getting real, real cold here (like mid-december) I found him lying on the cement floor of his shop around 11 at night. I could have left him there, but if he'd frozen to death I never would have forgiven myself. So I managed to make him get up... Then he got angry with me when I suggested calling his son to come help. He staggered toward me, so I grabbed a big, heavy wrench and told him I wasn't some weak little woman he can beat, like his ex wife, that I'd put him down if I had to.   My boyfriend came home and helped her him into his house. Oh, he was best buddies with my boyfriend but the moment I said something, he got mouthy and mean.   Believe it or not, when he's sober (which is becoming increasingly rare), he's one of the nicest people you could meet. Would do anything for you, even give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. Because of this, he's got so many people fooled into thinking he's thus wonderful guy.   Give him a case or 3 of beer and some Wild Turkey and you'll see who he really is."

There's a reason they call it ""liquid courage"".   I could be wrong, hell I can admit that. But I've been around enough alcoholics (not casual drinkers, alcoholics) to see the parallels between their drunk and sober selves. In the case of my neighbor/landlord, when sober he may be super nice and generous, I've also heard him slip up and say something incredibly chauvinistic. Then when he's got a good buzz it manifests into something like saying (this is something he said to me just the other day while laughing his ass off and calling my dog a spoiled little bitch) ""All women! Hahaha ALL WOMEN are bitches at some point HAHAHA"". Then he gets shit faced and it manifests into violence.   Like I said, I could be wrong. It's just in my experience alcohol helps you reveal who you are deep down. And to me, saying that it doesn't or that it's not real is a cop out. It's a way to not take any responsibility for the things that have come out of your mouth or the things you've done. To me, saying that is like saying my neighbor isn't a wife beater, hes just unfortunate that alcohol makes him do those things."

buffy,367trl,lecherous_hump,30,Sun May 17 05:21:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it's in another state, which is lucky for him, although if the infraction is serious enough, the prosecutor can request his record in other states and use that as evidence at a hearing. Even if you were found not guilty, your previous arrest reports can be used.  He's been lucky so far. His previous arrests could have been charged as something a lot more serious than they were. If he wasn't a celebrity they almost definitely would have been. At this point, it would be very easy for a prosecutor to have him held in jail on a dangerous-- that's when they say that you're a danger to the public and should be denied bail.  I know all this because, like I said the last time, I recently got out of jail. I was there for 6 months because of something I did while drunk that I don't even remember. No memory whatsoever. It was alcohol and Xanax.  I'm really lucky too. If you kill someone in your car while drunk they often charge you with vehicular homicide. (Edit: I didn't kill anyone, this is an example =x). I can't imagine those people who wake up in jail the next day to have the word ""homicide"" read to them. I got chills just typing that. These are not bad people. They might not even have records.  Sober you has to live with everything drunk you does.  At the end, the only one who can help an alcoholic is themselves, which is a catch-22 because an alcoholic usually doesn't want to. Have you ever been really drunk and feeling bad for yourself, or drunk and in another negative state of mind, like crying drunk? Or angry drunk? This is hard to explain to a non-alcoholic, but, imagine that feeling feeding on itself in such a way that you come to need it. Alcohol gives you it. And there's only one thing guaranteed to make you forget (for a little while), and that's getting blackout drunk again. It's a neat system.  I wish I could talk to him.

buffy,368wgu,Tajz,9,Sun May 17 10:06:48 2015 UTC,Wasn't the reason for this that they wanted to make sure that the slayer would protect the key?
buffy,368wgu,bwburke94,8,Sun May 17 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"There aren't too many things the Key could become that could be protected by a Slayer.  Faith's in prison at this point, so for all intents and purposes the only Slayer who can protect the Key is Buffy. Making the Key an inanimate object is a huge risk, given Glory's physical strength. So giving Buffy a sibling is the best option.  The Key became a sister rather than a brother because it was easier to make a female Summers child because Buffy herself was female. She was made younger than Buffy in order for Buffy to feel the need to protect her, but was old enough to potentially defend herself."
buffy,368wgu,rywon,3,Sun May 17 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"Right, and in addition to this. Nobody ever guessed that the Key was a human. Before knowing this, Glory only ever expected it to be an inanimate object; it never crossed her mind that it could be a living, breathing human. Where it not for Ben's slip-up, she'd have never known."

buffy,368wgu,The_Iron_Zeppelin,6,Thu May 21 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"The monks, for whatever reason, wanted to protect the key, not destroy it.  Presumably, their order had some use for it, or some reverence for it.  Dropping it in the ocean... well two problems.  First, glory could EASILY have gotten that back.  She is a God, she could dive down for it herself.  Ben was mortal, she was not.  But more importantly, presumably the monks wanted it around for something, we never learn why,"

buffy,366wch,GoddessOfGoodness,1 point,Sun May 17 10:44:16 2015 UTC,"True; although that's more a part of pp-culture Sherlockery. In canon, Moriarty appeared once and ditto Moran (unless some late stories had flashbacks.)"

Her post wasn't any more ""abandoned"" than it was the previous summer. The vampires in Sunnydale were not killed by her that summer either.   BUFFY You guys seemed to be doing fine without me.  WILLOW We did the best we could! We didn't have much choice in the matter.   There is no indication that anyone was slaying vampires the previous summer. Why do they feel that she left them ""no choice"" but to take up the slack?  I do think that what you point out is a difference, but it seems strange to me that they would be so concerned about her mission when they weren't worried about it at all the previous summer.  Edit:  I do think that her mom has a reason to expect things from her, and I think that her watcher does. I didn't get the impression that Xander and Willow really did at all - certainly not to the degree that they seem to.   They were willing to give her time at the end of s2. If I were Buffy's friend, and I had learned that she had disappeared, I would definitely be worried about her, but I wouldn't feel tremendously put out."
buffy,366c9h,irishartistry,6,Sat May 16 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I get what your reasoning but you have to remember what happened at the end of season 1. They killed the master, a powerful vampire and the leader of the majority, if not all, vampires in Sunnydale. It's been a while since I watched season 2 but I'm near sure Xander and Willow mention that it was really quiet in demonic activity over the summer while Buffy was gone. If I can remember it's at the start when Buffy saves them from the vampire and she says something about them not having protection. Again it's been awhile so I can't say for sure.   Like the others have said though Buffy was expected to come back at the end of the summer between S1 & 2. At the end of season 2 she upped and left with no word of where she would be. She left behind her duties and her friends and ran away. Entirely different scenarios.   Edit to add: Over season 2 more and more threats came to Sunnydale, drawn by the mystical powers of the Hellmouth but also by the slayer. So as time progressed in season 2 more and more vampires, and demons, active in Sunnydale. Angel was sent to a hell dimension and Spike & Dru left so the vampire minions were free to go off and run amok. Plus those three weren't on the same level as the Master. He was old, to be feared. When he died his followers went underground, weakened by the loss of their leader. This time with Angel, Spike & Dru it was different.   Well, this is my take on it."
buffy,366c9h,AngelAmongUs,3,Sat May 16 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm near sure Xander and Willow mention that it was really quiet in demonic activity over the summer while Buffy was gone.    They do :)   XANDER: (interrupting) You know, I gotta say, this has really  been the most boring summer ever.  WILLOW: Yeah, but on the plus side, no monsters  or stuff. She sits on the stone wall. He leans on it next to her, looking off towards the graveyard.  XANDER: I know, but I'm so restless! I'm actually  glad school is starting again.  WILLOW: Yeah, and that has nothing to do with a  certain girl that we both know that is a  vampire slayer?  XANDER: Please. I'm so over her. (REAL casual) Did she, uh, say when she was getting  back, about which I don't care?  WILLOW: I haven't heard from her. I mean, I got a  couple of postcards after she went to L.A.  and then, like, nothing.  XANDER: Yeah, I never heard... well, she's probably  having fun with her dad.   Xander and Willow have lived in Sunnydale their entire lives without encountering a vampire to the best of their knowledge until Buffy came along.  It's very possible that things occurred  that they were not aware of that first summer."

It's true. :)   I feel that if anyone should be worried about keeping the vampire population of Sunnydale in check, it's Giles, and he isn't. He doesn't train Xander, Willow, and Oz, he doesn't accompany them; his primary focus is on finding Buffy, and he only offers vague encouragement and warning:   GILES: Well, for god's sake be careful. I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns but if any of you should be hurt or killed, I shall take it somewhat amiss.   He has taken over Buffy's job patrolling before when Buffy ""lost her equilibrium"" in ""Ted,"" and presumably he saw no problem with her leaving town for the summer last year. I don't really understand why Xander and Willow think that it falls to them to do what they think Buffy would do if she were there... especially given that their actions aren't focused as much on saving others (like preventing people from being killed by vampires outside the Bronze), but on actively seeking out danger.  It's also the case that Buffy was wanted for murder for at least part of the summer. She possibly would have been again ""in no shape to patrol"" for some time, even if she had stayed."

It's not awesome video-editing making them sit next to each other.  An interesting non-Buffy fact is the actress who played Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 also has an identical twin, as did the guard who wins his cup of coffee before the T-1000 morphs into him right in front of him (that's his identical twin) and stabs him in the eye.   However, I'm digressing, what's REALLY cool is the scene where Sarah Connor is cutting open Arnie's head to take out the chip as he watches through the mirror? There's actually no mirror! Arnie is on one side, talking to Sarah and the side Sarah is cutting open is a dummy (you see the back of the dummy-Arnold's head).  The actress and her identical sister are doing the operation, one side of the mirror each, copying each other's moves.  I love movie facts."

Honestly surprised dawn didn't end up suicidal given all the shit she had to deal with at such a young age.

Everyone freaks out at how terrible a replacement she was for Tara but never mention the fact that Willow was a 20something creeping on a 15 year old.

They are MOLLY, ANNABELLE AND KENNEDY. And they are all potential Slayers.  MOLLY, 14 or 15, is a Brit of East Indian heritage. She's cute, pudgy.  Her style is very ""Ghost World."" Pigtails and a miniskirt, ripped stockings, a lunch box for a purse...  ANNABELLE, 16, is a sleek, athletic upper-class Brit. She's a bit of a snob. Very into her training, a tad humorless.  KENNEDY, 19, the oldest of the bunch. She's tough and wry - takes all the mysticism associated with the Slayer gig with a serious grain of salt.   The only on-screen reference to Kennedy's age is in ""Showtime"":   CHLOE: It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean... I'm too young.  KENNEDY: Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger the better. (then) In fact... I'm starting to think it might be too late for me.

In the movie, the helicopters land, and about 10 seconds later ""riley"" goes to scout the area, sees an enemy soldier, and goes all ""lets take him prisoner!!"" And starts chasing after him. Then he gets shot up like nobody's business and has a nice dramatic death. (Im being flippant about a true story and i apologize for any disrespect, as he may have been portraying a real person and a real death) but in my personal ""head cannon"", the buffyverse where buffy is just a mental patient has a riley who died in Vietnam. The buffyverse where shes a slayer, riley really did get to be the super-soldier his character in ""We Were Soldiers"" wanted to be. Everybody wins. Mostly riley though because a demon-fueled marathon session of slayer sex means... Well... I dont know what it means, but i want it. You do too."

buffy,35yo9m,buffylove,8,Fri May 15 08:35:20 2015 UTC,"My personal feeling is that Riley was the guy Buffy had the best chance of having a ""normal life"" with. She could never marry, have kids with, or grow old with Angel or Spike. Riley at least worked in her world and knew about vampires and all that. The episode where he comes back with his wife I think really highlighted this idea.   Sure, he wasn't an interesting character, and I don't particularly like him myself. But, he was the only major love interest that Buffy could have had that with which I find to be notable."
buffy,35yo9m,Lynn_K,8,Thu May 14 22:27:22 2015 UTC,I liked him at first. He seemed to be very caring and genuine. And then came the blame game. Hhhh...You are dating a slayer. She can't just put aside everything else to show you exactly how much she loves you when you don't feel needed enough. And don't get me started on how much I would have liked to slap Xander when he also blamed Buffy for Riley's problems.
buffy,35yo9m,SikozuShantiShanu,7,Thu May 14 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"I know people generally hate Riley for being bland, but I always got the impression that that was the point of the character. Remember in the beginning of Season 4 Buffy says she wants to be with someone 'normal' or something like that.  I know the show initially portrays him as this super soldier, but as as time goes on, this portrayal is diminished and he is transformed into the safe boyfriend character. Interestingly, the blander and blander he becomes, the more apparent it is that he is incompatible with Buffy. Buffy can never really love him, and he knows it, prodding him down a dark path (which I thought was the most interesting thing about his character [that and his interactions with Angel were hilarious]).   I personally don't hate Riley. I actually felt a little bad for him for the way Buffy treated him in Season 5. I do think he stayed on the show too long, though, and was not sad when he left."
buffy,35yo9m,pober,5,Thu May 14 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Riley couldn't handle Buffy for who she was. He expected her to be some doting female who he could protect, and that's never going to be Buffy. That's why I disliked him. He started out cool. I wish he was never in the initiative or any of that BS. Not to mention he gives her 24 hours or something to figure out if she wants to be with him AFTER she found out he was basically cheating on her?  Nope. Nope. Nope.  Too manipulative."
buffy,35yo9m,buffylove,4,Fri May 15 08:37:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I just finished another watch through of season 4 and I had that exact thought - I wish Riley hadn't been part of the Initiative. I almost liked him until then.

I did like that he was more or less a normal guy, which was kind of refreshing. I thought he worked a lot better in the group than a lot of people seem to."

buffy,35yo9m,SoMuchMoreEagle,4,Thu May 14 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"I find him dull as dishwater. Maybe it's because the writers didn't give him any background other than a few hints at an idealistic rural childhood so he didn't have much substance.   Our favourite characters are always breaking the rules, or bending them, or just writing their own rules! They are fun and interesting. Riley is too regimental. Even when he starts to go against his training it just seems false.    Add to this that I still want Buffy and Angel back together,  the guy really didn't stand a chance :-P"

buffy,35yo9m,jimmyolsenblues,3,Thu May 14 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Riley the first time I watched Buffy as he came across a  pretentious and I found Spike to be more fun to watch.  Years later though and re-watching that season I actually think Riley comes across as a decent guy who is a lot more interesting then he gets credit for. It's just he put up against Spike for that entire season and oblivious people are going to cheer for the dangerous and funny Spike who's character development is gaining momentum that season.   I think what people forget to compare him too is Angel. Angel in my opinion is one dimensional compared to Riley. All Angel's character was is this dark brooding vampire who's in love with Buffy. The entire thing with Angel was the all consuming passionate love between Buffy and Angel but without that Angel himself is dull as a door nail. Take away Angels looks and the the fact he's a vampire and what do you get? Nothing. Angelas is a different story but that isn't angel. Spike on the other hand would still be awesome even without all of that because he has intelligence charisma and depth.   Riley has depth but no one gets to see much of it because he spends most of his time in a one sided relationship which ALWAYS makes the person who is in love look like a loser and a bitch. People hate to see them relationships where both people say they love each other but it's clear one of them isn't in love and as a result there are relationship problems causing the one in love to be extremely unhappy. Riley is the type of guy who would sacrifice himself for the person he loves without a second thought. He's the guy you could build a life with if the feelings are there.  Now think about it. What if Buffy never really loved Angel. What if Buffy and Angels relationship consisted of Buffy doing to Angel what she did to Riley because there was nothing deeper there. No passion. Would people like Angel or would Angel come across as a loser/bitch/whiner. The typical guy/girl that reminds you of the ex you never really loved but still maintained a relationship with despite it. Until either got bored of them, you got sick of them being unhappy in a one sided relationship or they finally manned up and left you after realising the truth.  The problem for him and many guys out there is he is safe. He has your back. He isn't going to try hurt you. He's going to give you whatever you need. He's emotionally available, dependable and will put you first. He's the guy who gets taken for granted because a women knows he's not going to stray and has his heart in the palm of her hands. He requires no work. He isn't the ""bad boy who needs fixing up who oh so many men and women go for despite knowing once they change them they will get bored""  As much as Spike is my favourite character in the whole Show he wasn't a great guy deep down. He still did horrible shit to Buffy AFTER regaining his soul. I think people are more forgiving of Spike because Buffy forgive him even when he attacked her in the bathroom. You know what I mean and honestly he should of being staked for that. When Spike couldn't get what he wanted he tried to take it by force. When Riley could not get what he wanted (buffys love)  he became self destructive and finally left.  It isn't that Riley could not handle Buffy it's that Buffy wasn't in love with him. That's all it was and for that Riley ended up the role of guy/girl in a one sided relationship and no one respects that position."
buffy,35yo9m,Victuswolf,5,Fri May 15 17:09:06 2015 UTC,"He doesn't exactly have a rich internal life, or charisma, or unique energy, or an iconoclastic brave vibe, a challenging brand of intelligence, detectable creativity, anything compelling at all. He's just a big douchy blah cops-and-robbers fratty dude. Not exactly attractive stuff. Then compare his sad sack self to the rest of those badass characters, and he's just just completely out of his league (and that's not even getting into the subject of him putting the world in danger through his creepy pretend-army bullshit, and then acting all 'oh, shucks, I had good intentions.') It is pretty much squicky and repulsive to see Buffy trying to be content with that vapid mediocre dude. So his character inspires either indifference (for the elevated person, probably!) or hatred/contempt/disgust (in more judgmental people, like me apparently!) Blech."
buffy,35yo9m,brightemptyspace,5,Thu May 14 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think you're wrong, but if i may... Isnt the fact that hes kindof whiny and insecure about his relationship supposed to highlite the insecurity that some/a lot of guys have about strong women? Riley really is a good guy, but he (like all of us) is a little insecure. He has a lot in common with xander as far as being put in his place constantly. Yeah, hes the guy, hes even (unlike xander..... Usually) the badass soldier guy, but he is still nothing next to his superhero girlfriend. Riley couldnt get over himself though. He felt like she could never love a man who was less than her.  Lots of guys feel that way. They get so enamored that they begin to believe that they are unworthy if they cant be perfect. It was just sad that he never got to be more than that guy. It would have been cool if they had broken up, and stayed broken up, but he stuck around and learned to deal with her as a teammate with superior abilities without getting his panties in a bunch about it. We always talk about how empowering buffy is for girls, but the male characters were also pretty deep and interesting. I think riley got shafted though because he went out on such a low note and never got to redeem himself. I would have liked to see his character move to Angel. Angel was all about redemption and i think riley deserved that. For real though, i hate riley and buffy as a couple, but angel and riley matching wits would have been fun."
buffy,35yo9m,drvondoctor,1 point,Fri May 15 04:16:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think it was a very masterful (of course) display of the 'threatened guy' dynamic, but also masterful was the way not everyone overcomes their mediocre tendencies. Also, I didn't want to mention the Xander parallel, because I could have written almost the same words about him I wrote about Riley (which is never popular!) Another insecure dude (who went so far as not telling Buffy that Angel prob got his soul back, just because he was a jealous judgmental threatened dude, and thereby put Buffy in the position of having to pointlessly destroy Angel.) I think Whedon realistically shows an accurate distribution of lame threatened patronizing sexist men, and then a tiny sprinkling of truly feminist men. In my opinion, there was only one truly intelligent and reflective and strong and appreciative/non-threatened/feminist man (Spike), but then also one pretty good dude but still patronizing and kind of problematic in various ways (Angel), and Giles (who is problematic in some ways, but on the whole a non-sexist dude. If both Riley and Xander suddenly became a lot more intelligent and reflective and 'deep' and restrained and less creepy, then it would be a much more unreal reflection of actual life!"
buffy,35yo9m,brightemptyspace,5,Fri May 15 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"I think part of my problem with him is that, outside of the whole ""super-soldier"" thing, he was pretty much just there to be Buffy's boyfriend. We never really got to know more about him, except that he likes to drive for fun and has family in Iowa? or someplace. Then he got all jealous and whiny. I was so glad when he left, I was actually annoyed at Xander for talking Buffy into going after him!"

buffy,35yo9m,danielle_kb,3,Thu May 14 23:25:01 2015 UTC,"as someone who just got around to watch the whole series this past year, I was a bit taken aback by Riley. But I feel that is simply because the only relationships I knew Buffy had were with Angel and Spike.  Then I watched it only to find out Angel was only in it for a few seasons, and her and Spike never had an ""official"" relationship. So her dating some previously unmentioned character that I didn't know existed caught me off guard. Especially since he stayed around for a while. I knew all the characters just from knowing about the show and seeing little bits and pieces, but when Anya showed up I was caught off guard as well, I'd never heard of her before.   I'd heard of Buffy, Giles, angel, tara and willow, Oz, Spike, Xander and even Dawn but those two came out of nowhere to me as ""main characters""   I'm not saying I hated Riley, but his entire arc and even his stupid macho guy name weren't exactly my favourite thing. I got through season 4 pretty good, if only for Spike's storyline, Anya, and a few other things. But it definitely isn't in the top for me, although I don't have the issue that other people seem to have with Adam being the villain, if only because I personally enjoy bad sci fi stories."

Always being clingy and lovey-dovey when I wasn't, etc. Well, come to find out, this is actually a common perspective of him. Perhaps that's because some of us have those exes in our past.

She's at heart a conventional cliché-suburban type (even tho she lived in the LA limits) who feels she needs a big strong man to take care of her. (Perhaps one reason she doesn't seem to go in for being on top during sex.) and try as he might, Riley could not give her that. Also, it's hard to love someone who won't allow to be there for them when they need support. Buffy was going thru one of the worst possible things someone her age can go thru with Joyce's illness, and Riley wanted her to put some of it on him, but she wouldn't, she had to make herself suffer more than she needed to."

He also added justification to Buffy's speech about being 'cookie dough' in season 7. If Buffy had just had the Angel/Spike type dark / bad boys for lovers then I there would have been the argument that Buffy had only ever experienced one type of guy and therefore she wasn't just 'not finished baking', she had simply just not found the right type of guy. Ultimately I think there were a few relationship orientated life lessons to be learned with Riley. From just an aesthetics point of view though, he wasn't my favourite partner of Buffy's (I'm a lover of Spike) but I still enjoyed the variety he brought to the show."

buffy,35z213,BlackMoonWolf3113,3,Thu May 14 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"The Buffy/Giles car scene is still one of my favorite moments in the entire series:     Cut to the street in front of Buffy's house. Giles pulls up in his ancient car to drop her off. He looks over at her and shuts off the engine. Cut into the car. The only noise is that of the crickets outside. Giles breaks the silence.  Giles:  It's not over. I-I-I suppose you know that. He'll come after you, particularly. His profile, uh, well, he... he's likely to strike out at the things that made him the most human.  Buffy:  You must be so disappointed in me.  Giles:  No. (she looks at him) No, no, I'm not.  Buffy:  But this is all my fault.  Giles:  No. I don't believe it is. Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you that you acted rashly? You did. A-and I can. I know that you loved him. And... he... has proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months a-are gonna, are gonna be hard... I, I suspect on all of us, but... if it's guilt you're looking for, Buffy, I'm, I'm not your man. All you will get from me is, is my support. And my respect.  Buffy smiles at him through her tears.     transcript"

Anyway, he talks about it like, ""Yeah, we always thought it'd be cool to make one where Buffy might be insane."" Very casually. I don't think the hospital scenes are supposed to be reality."

buffy,35xmx3,drvondoctor,1 point,Fri May 15 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"Nicely put, and I'm right there with you.  I guess I just meant that he does tend to have a pretty dark storytelling style sometimes, and if Buffy was actually insane, I feel like he'd do more to make us aware of it."
buffy,35xmx3,GooGooGajoob67,2,Fri May 15 10:10:20 2015 UTC,It was the final push to get me to write a country song lyric about Willow's and Tara's breakup:-).Problem is getting Martina or Carrie to record it !
buffy,35xmx3,DaddyCatALSO,9,Thu May 14 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"I find it extremely unsettling too. I have some (anxiety related) crazy-brain issues myself, and I sometimes fear 'What if I go insane and they put me in a mental hospital?', so it feels super raw watching it. That fear of being so out of control that I can't parse reality is just so chilling.   And then I wonder which reality I myself would choose when Buffy faces her decision at the end and I'm really glad I don't have to make that decision. Scariest episode of the series imo, but at the same time I always put it in my top 2 when we do those favorite episodes lists."
buffy,35xmx3,AngryWizard,8,Thu May 14 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"To me, it's also unambiguous. Right before the final scene, Buffy says she still needs the antidote. To me, that says the Asylumverse isn't the reality."
buffy,35xmx3,DaddyCatALSO,6,Thu May 14 14:27:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if Normal Again is supposed to be reality, then how do we explain Angel (the series)? The two shows coexist in the same reality, so what - Buffy not only creates her world, but also this other one where she or her friends appear, like, maybe once a year?"
buffy,35xmx3,querico,5,Thu May 14 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the theory that both realities are real. It's been shown since early on that there are multiple timelines and countless other dimensions in the Buffyverse, so one where she was in an asylum and not the slayer isn't entirely out of the question. The poison just connected her mind to her alternate self.  Plus since we know Seasons 1-10 of Buffy are canon, as are all seasons of Angel (and Angel & Faith), and all of the tie-ins, it just seems unreasonable to say (at least for me) that it's all just Buffy being Ms. Crazypants."
buffy,35xmx3,sorcerousmike,1 point,Thu May 14 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"At least 2 different authors have gone with that at shriftweb's Buffy archive. And the stories are also separate realities form each other, irreconcilable."
buffy,35xmx3,DaddyCatALSO,3,Thu May 14 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah Joss has said that the ending was meant to be ambiguous, but it's pretty unambiguous to me.  It ends IN the damn asylum.  So that's the true reality.  He's also said that during his run on Astonishing X-Men, he wanted to include an offhand comment that Scott Summers had a cousin in an insane asylum.  Never came to light, but that's even more telling to me.  None of the events of the Buffyverse happened.  I hate that, but it makes the most sense to me given that episode."
buffy,35xmx3,knowledgeoverswag,6,Thu May 14 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"The ending where the camera moves backwards slowly makes it seem as if the viewer is also fading away from the reality in that room. It messes with my head, man. I've never had a TV show episode make me feel insane before.  It's probably because I am so invested in the Buffyverse. These characters feel real to me. I feel their emotions. So to be told that it's all insane, my feelings are also insane. And that's just... insane."
buffy,35xmx3,theperfectend,1 point,Thu May 14 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like because that is the last shot it is true that she is in the asylum, however I don't hate that. I am quite happy to join this inmate in her fantastic delusions."
buffy,35xmx3,BlackMoonWolf3113,3,Thu May 14 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. During my rewatches I'm more afraid of revisiting Normal Again than I am of The Body. When Buffy uses her slayer strength to hurt her friends...especially when she grabs Tara's ankle on the basement steps when Tara was just trying to help everyone...so intense.  Here are my thoughts on the final scene in the episode, copied and pasted from another thread.   Buffy tumbled through the looking glass and down into the rabbit hole in Normal Again. It's difficult to completely 100% bounce back from mental illness, whether it's depression, anxiety, or (in Buffy's case) delusions.   This may be a dark interpretation, but I tend to believe that the final scene in the episode is symbolic. She went rather deep into the rabbit hole, so to speak. I think any human who went through that experience would always secretly wonder if she's still in that mental ward. Who wouldn't question their reality after such an experience?  So the final scene, in my opinion, means Buffy herself will always remember and question if she's still in that room. It's a memorial in her mind."
buffy,35xmx3,Aloysius_Jentee,2,Thu May 14 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"I think the title of the episode is literal in that she's actually ""normal again"" after the whole thing. Well, obviously, as normal as she ever was.   It makes me happy at the end."
buffy,35xmx3,hotramen,2,Thu May 14 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"I got all shook up when the doctor told Buffy and her family that she had a brief break through that summer before she got ""pulled back in"" to her mental state. It made me feel like that was Buffy's heaven. It gave the episode more depth for me because she was given the option to get back there."
buffy,35xmx3,Enzown,1 point,Fri May 15 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen the episode in a while, but pretty certain Buffy's time in heaven is exactly what that's referring to."
buffy,35xmx3,stillnotking,1 point,Sun May 17 12:38:04 2015 UTC,I think the shock is not that Buffy's world might not be real. We all (I hope) already know it isn't. The shock is the writer forcing the audience into a Doylist perspective when most of us prefer to watch as Watsonians. (Obligatory warning for TVTropes link.)

But now, being a bit older (29) and realizing that for a TV show to completely flip itself like that -- and in such an intelligent way -- is such an amazing feat. One day I think everything that occurred was ""real"" (quotations because obviously it isn't) and then another I love the idea that it's a figment of her imagination. Genius!"
buffy,35xmx3,DanielHorton00,1 point,Fri May 15 18:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was so invested in the story and characters at that time that this episode was really unsettling. Though I think that was sort of the point.   In addition, This seems to be one of those things that's meant to be left up to the imagination. Different people will draw different conclusions. It was done very well in that you can't really logically conclude which scenario is the 'real' one, and which is the hallucination. Mind screw : /"

buffy,35sw0d,jaguars5,9,Wed May 13 05:56:25 2015 UTC,"Haha aw yeah, you're probably right. They start using cell phones in the 7th season but it's always like ""uh-oh, Buffy forgot her cell phone!"" I prefer the show without cell phones to be honest, it makes me feel nostalgic."
buffy,35sw0d,strawberryf1elds,9,Wed May 13 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"This is true, but it's also true for a lot of movies/shows that came out in the 90s and earlier (I remember having an argument on some other forum about Go and cell phone use, for example.) I'm the same age as Buffy & Co, and while a few people at my high school had pagers, I only knew ONE person with a cell phone...and her parents were rich. Which I suppose brings up the question, wouldn't Cordy have had one? Maybe. But again, not super common--the other ""rich kids"" at my high school didn't have one.  It does make for some interesting hypotheticals, though. If, say, Willow had sent Buffy a text about the spell to restore Angel's soul, season 2 probably would have had a very different outcome."
buffy,35sw0d,lightswitch_raver,8,Wed May 13 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"Cordy had a cell phone in season 1, at least in the episode where she said something like 'hold on while I call every single person I've ever known' about Buffy being a weirdo in the bronze."
buffy,35sw0d,AngryWizard,1 point,Wed May 13 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Even so, if only one of them has a cell it's no use because you can't contact anyone on the move unless everyone has one."
buffy,35sw0d,360Saturn,15,Wed May 27 11:29:17 2015 UTC,"Teenagers did not necessarily have cell phones in the late 90's and early 2000's. Phone companies charged by the minute, and texting was not in existence at that time. I remember a lot more pagers than cell phones then. Nowadays, of course, every member of the Scoobies would have had a cell phone. But as I recall, it was rather rare until about 2003 or so."
buffy,35sw0d,BlackMoonWolf3113,6,Wed May 13 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"Most shows (and movies, and books) from an era before cellphones were universal kind of have this problem. Sometimes, I wonder if writers are ever nostalgic about a time where they didn't have to worry about everybody having relatively reliable wireless supercomputers in their pockets all the time when they were putting together plots."
buffy,35sw0d,Eiyran,4,Wed May 13 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"I remember in, I believe it was he commentary of the final episode, Joss Whedon specifically mentions that he didnt want to have cell phones because it would be too easy to fix a lot of the conflicts."

buffy,35sw0d,Sammyboy616,2,Wed May 13 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched it more recently and noticed this as well, but also cell phones weren't as prominent with teenagers in the late 90s/early 2000s. I remember when I was in sixth grade back in 2002, there was only like one kid in school with a cell phone, and everyone knew who she was simply because she had a cell phone. It was kind of funny.  I think it might have been around 2005 when the flip phone/Razr craze began that everybody started having cell phones?"

buffy,35s817,GinaZaneburritos,5,Wed May 13 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"Also, Whistler (who guided Angel toward his arc of becoming a force for good) was, presumably, good. Not just gray-area, but actually good."
buffy,35s817,Nachttoter,6,Wed May 13 06:40:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think Whistler is an excellent example of a demon who is capable of doing good, but not because he is drawn to it like someone with a soul.  When he describes himself, it's like this:   [I'm a] demon, technically. But I'm not a bad guy -- not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life. Someone has to maintain balance, you know. Good and evil can't exist without each other, blah blah blah. I'm not like a good fairy or anything, I'm just trying to make it all balance -- do I come off defensive?   To me, he seems equally capable of swaying someone to evil as well, if that would provide more balance. Good to him is not intrinsically better than evil... his moral code is not one that points him to goodness, but rather towards balance. It is not the same as the moral compass provided by a soul.  If I recall correctly, somewhere in the comics he is revealed to be spoilers for Whistler's birth He's much less human than any other demons seen (up to that point in time) - he works on a cosmic scale where questions of good and evil are mostly irrelevant, except when one threatens to outweigh the other.   BUFFY: You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you? What are you, some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good and evil?  WHISTLER: Wow. Good guess.  BUFFY: Why don't you try getting off your immortal ass and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause I'm tired of doing this by myself.   I don't see him as someone who's a fighter for good at all."

buffy,35s817,AuthorTomFrost,4,Wed May 13 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"When my wife and I are analyzing fiction, we refer to this as the ""Pylean cosmology."" In the Buffyverse, demons are individuals who make individual decisions. They come from different cultures and biologies than humans do and that frequently makes them antagonistic to humans, but nothing is set in stone."
buffy,35s817,CJGibson,2,Wed May 13 11:48:17 2015 UTC,"Oz is turned into a werewolf, which makes him demonic but no less a “good guy.”    I don't think there's anything to suggest that Lycanthropy is somehow demonic in nature, but it's possible it's out there in the extended works (it's definitely not portrayed as such on the show)."
buffy,35s817,CJGibson,2,Wed May 13 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"The way that lycanthropy is spread (through bodily fluids and biting) is similar to vampirism. It's also different from the hyena possession that afflicts Xander in ""The Pack"" - there's no suggestion that Xander could ""turn"" anyone by biting them (as a werewolf can).  Moreover, ""New Moon Rising"" uses Oz to challenge Riley's ""people versus monsters"" world view, several times using the word ""demon"" to describe Oz:   RILEY: Look, I only said what I said because I'm concerned. I don't want her to get hurt.  BUFFY: I know. But you sounded like Mr. Initiative. ""Demons bad. People good.""  RILEY: Something wrong with that theorem?  BUFFY: Well, yeah. There's degrees of ...  RILEY: Evil.  BUFFY: It's different with different demons. [...] The point is, every relationship has issues. Willow fell for Oz before he was even bit. It's always more complicated than -"
buffy,35s817,jaguars5,2,Wed May 13 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"There's a gap in there.  The ""demons"" stuff is Buffy talking about Angel, without mentioning his name.  She switches to talking about Willow and Oz because she doesn't want to talk about Angel with Riley.  That passage doesn't read to me as a suggestion that werewolves are demonic."
buffy,35s817,Nachttoter,0,Wed May 13 18:23:58 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you're putting more thought into this than the writers of the show. The Hellmouth and demons are basically a Dues Ex Machina (although im using that term incorrectly) to basically write a bunch of Goosebumps style episodes.   I mean.. isn't the 4th  episode of this show about a sexy teacher who seduces virgin male students because she's secretly a giant praying mantis?
buffy,35s817,aofb031985,7,Wed May 13 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I gotta say, I think there's much more to BtVS than Goosebumps-style entertainment. It's a metaphor for adolescence that grapples with what constitutes good and evil, right and wrong. The sheer volume of academic writing around the show underscores this!  But seriously, Teacher's Pet is a pretty terrible episode."
buffy,35s817,Nachttoter,3,Wed May 13 06:31:55 2015 UTC,I mean Ms.French provides lots of puns later in the series so Teacher's Pet has a purpose.

buffy,35srm0,OhEightFour,4,Thu May 14 17:07:03 2015 UTC,"I also felt the ""town becomes a huge crater"" was a callback to Buffy's finale, albeit going the route of a raised meteor instead of a sinkhole. I enjoy Joss' penchant for destroying entire cities."

Plus, he planned to take Dawn as is child bride of the underworld. These things are definitely bad in Buffy's world (and ours).  Would you explain the necessary evil aspect? I'm not sure what exactly that means in this context and how it pertains to Sweet."
buffy,35t5e0,BlackMoonWolf3113,2,Wed May 13 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"He gave up really easily. He could have taken Xander and really hurt the scoobs.

buffy,35t5e0,BlackMoonWolf3113,5,Wed May 13 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"Sweet did give up easily, but I've always felt like that's because he's not the violent, fighting kind of demon. His weird puppet guys did his fighting for him, and Buffy killed those guys in about 3 seconds. His power lies in music. Once he saw that the Scoobies were able to fight against his power, and Xander would have been his bride of the underworld, he waved the white flag and noped it of there. He knew he was no match for the slayer at that point. He's smarter than the average demon, but not more powerful. Buffy would have wiped the floor with him and he knew it.  (My opinion, anyway)."
buffy,35t5e0,ModerateBias,2,Wed May 13 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think his issue is that, for whatever reason, he was bound by certain rules.  Beyond that, he wasn't much of a fighter.

buffy,35icka,DaddyCatALSO,3,Mon May 11 18:56:47 2015 UTC,So there seems to be no record of his date of birth. But here are years 1850-1853(I used 1853 for the tombstone in my yard). I took several online quizzes & it said he was a Scorpio by his personality (October 24-November 22). We could pick a date & make it a thing.
buffy,35kvdp,legobunny,13,Mon May 11 09:27:15 2015 UTC,"I consider Buffy a feminist.   Here's why: When I was a young teenager, I was conservative (as many often are). My grandmother (Gummy) raised me, she was a burlesque dancer who was arrested several times for protesting for women's reproductive rights. She danced until I was well into kindergarten. By the time I was fourteen, I was horrified by her behavior, past and at the time.   I complained one day when she was so open about her former job and political leanings to my friends. She looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Yes I took my clothes off, & even almost appeared in Playboy (she got pregnant with my aunt a few months before the shoot). One of the reasons I did it was for you, and the next generation. Clothes or no clothes, you have power to garner respect. Once you learn that, you can do anything.  I shouldn't have had to cover up & be ashamed of who I am. Your Grandfather (a fireman) risked his life every day for everyone, while I took my bra off to pay for Catholic school & I made twice what he did. But yet, abortion was illegal. I watched my best friend die of sepsis from a back alley abortion.  I stood across her coffin staring at her four little girls. The whole reason was she went to the back alley butcher because she knew with number five they would starve on a fireman's salary. I thought, this is all wrong, it all needs to change.  I may have not been the feminist that you can be proud of, or tell your friends about. But you wouldn't be able to do the things you do everyday without me.""   She's right, and I think of this everyday when dealing with a headstrong toddler. It's all about presence. Feminism comes in all shapes and sizes and I consider Buffy a feminist in a halter top. She makes mistakes, she isn't perfect. But she's a better role model than Bella will ever be. Because she had power and presence.   P.S. My grandma was a fan of Buffy and Angel. She liked Angel better, I asked why, ""He has a nice tushie."" :) She was my lighthouse in my sea & I miss her everyday. I'm so proud of her. I wish I could have taken her to meet Dave Boreanaz. She would have loved that.   http://i.imgur.com/j8MqcNB.jpg  P.S.S. Sorry for the long post."
buffy,35kvdp,sarah_bellum75,7,Mon May 11 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"That article, and many like it, just make me sad. Sad because to me, it shows a real lack of understanding of the show. Sure, they're quoting, but it's so cherry picking and no topic is really delved into or thought out. It's really, ""here's the fact, here's my quote/plot line to prove it, fact confirmed"". This (from what I've seen) seems to be a fairly typical trend of themarysue. This kind of sums it up really..   Welp. Surely there are some intelligent and sexual women who are allowed to flourish on this show, right?   Welp indeed."
buffy,35kvdp,coolbeaNs92,5,Mon May 11 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"nothing is more harmful to the idea of feminim then things like that quote.  A woman does not have to be sexual to be powerful.   She does not have to be non sexual either.   why is willow less powerful because she is not sexual?   We don't discuss Xander, or Riley, or Spike in terms of how sexual they are, when we discuss their power and ability to flourish.  We could sure, but its an irrelevant metric.   As it is with women.  The fact is, as long as they are free to be whichever they want, its ok.   its about having the choice, not making the one you want them to.  He mentions the men only to try and demonstrate their attitudes prove that whedon isn't feminist....   he neglects to point out that their attitudes toward women are shown as bad thing...    Though not all of spike's atittude is bad, and the show does well making it clear which parts are positive.   ((You're a helliuva woman is such an amazing line in context))  A housewife can be as feminist as a CEO, so long as its what they chose and felt free to make that choice."

buffy,35kvdp,Sammileighm,7,Mon May 11 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think the article is weak, other than I agree that the whole sex=bad thing is a bit annoying. She mentions as examples of Buffy's weakness the fact her powers come from men originally, the existence of the Watchers and the fact she 'falls apart' when her relationships fail.   I think this shows a lack of understanding of the show - Buffy owns her power and takes it back from the original men's aims, particularly in the last season, moves well beyond any control of the Watchers Council well before that and while understandably upset by relationship issues, always recovers and comes back fighting. Also, she always 'does the right thing' even when it damages her relationships.   I think all these issues existed in the first place primarily to show Buffy overcoming them, so it's a fairly poor argument.   My fav Buffy line which shows her power...  Angelus: No weapons... no friends... no hope. Take all that away and what's left?  Buffy: Me."
buffy,35kvdp,BthreePO,3,Mon May 11 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with all that.  Yet, I did find the points on especially Xander pretty interesting. In all his dorky behaviour and funny jokes, there are loads of things that show how he just doesn't have a whole lot of respect for his partners..."
buffy,35kvdp,loraine14,1 point,Mon May 11 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"That is very true. I was reading through the article, and was like ""That can be explained through context, that can be explained through context..."" and then I got to the part where Xander talks to Buffy about Riley. I've got to agree with that one... sometimes the things Xander said were really off point."
buffy,35kvdp,ModerateBias,1 point,Wed May 13 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"I also didn't understand her gripe with the ""Magical Negro nonsense inherent in the Primitive Slayer storyline"". Is she suggesting that there's something wrong with the first Slayer being African? If she was among the first people on this planet, isn't that where she'd be from?   I've followed themarysue for a long time and sometimes the weakness of her arguments are inexcusable for someone who's major life goal is pointing misogynistic tendencies in today's media.   Don't bash on Joss. He's one of the good guys."
buffy,35kvdp,faaackksake,6,Sat May 23 08:59:13 2015 UTC,"What kind of got me about the article is that the show pointed out a lot of the things she talked about like buffy's attachments to her boyfriends, I'm not sure which episode but she even says she can't let her boyfriends decide who she is (or something to that order) and Anya points out how Xander would often belittle her. And the sex stuff like the episode she pointed out where Buffy and Riley's sex is making the house go crazy, it is actually showed that it used to be a home for teens where a crazy lady would abuse and torment teens who showed any sexual desire: she was the villian. The blame was never put on buffy and she continued to have sex. Plus no one though the buffybot was good clean fun. Buffy is a feminist figure not just because she can fight, that has little to do with it, but because she tries to be strong for herself and her friends. Because she is her own person with faults, and yes sometimes she depends on men (Giles is like a father to her), men depend on her too."
buffy,35kvdp,Kallasilya,3,Tue May 12 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the problem is that as soon as she (or the other women in that article for that matter) are seen to have an emotional bond with a guy it, according to many critics, makes them less of a strong character...  I do think there's more to the sex stuff and the fact that a lot of times sex in the series is seen as having bad consequences, but that goes for Xander just as much. Really, I can't remember many instances where sex was 'in' an episode and it didn't have a feeling of carelessness - the only one I can think of is Willow and Tara.  But that doesn't mean that the message to take from it is that Buffy (or Xander or Willow) shouldn't be having sex, more that they live in a world where bad things happen... So you're right with the crazy-lady-house, but I can see similar things happening with almost all other instances of sex in the show"
buffy,35kvdp,stillnotking,2,Tue May 12 06:21:58 2015 UTC,"Sex being careless is not a feminist issue...   sexuality being good or bad is wholly separate from feminism arguments.  That said, there are several times sex is shown as safe and ""consequence"" free.  anya and xander, oz and willow, tara and willow, Buffy and riley (up until they get consumed by it because of the power of that one house, but that was more about letting it take over than having it), Giles and... forgot her name, his english friend, and i am sure there are more..."

And on the first take he actually walked in slow motion. They had to cut and tell him it would be slowed down later."

I think what makes Xander ""sexier"" in this episode is not so much that he's dangerous and mean, but more that he's confident.   I don't actually think he ""has a better chance with Buffy when possessed,"" because it seems to me that Buffy can't stand him this episode. A guy who steals her food, hurts her friends, makes fun of others, and likes it when she's afraid is not someone who's attractive to Buffy at all. She spends the episode pointing out his ""weird behavior,"" comforting Willow, standing up to him, and trying to cure him.

buffy,35iovq,buffanater,2,Sun May 10 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"weekly episode notes  Happy mothers day!    1 this episode really shows how cool Xan can be. Even though he matures throughout the series, it's only when something supernatural happens that he makes a huge change. Interestingly, in this episode, he's in high school and wants to be cool and popular. So something supernatural happens, and suddenly he's the cool bad boy. Later, in season 5 they're adults, and a bad boy is just immature.  He's not in college, has a low paying job and lives in his parents basement. Something supernatural happens, and he gets split in two. During that time, one half becomes the perfect adult. He gets a promotion, he buys a great apartment, and acts more mature. It seems when magic is involved, he gets ahead.  2 I really liked the zoo keeper, as a villain his tone and attitude were spot on. 3 notably absent were Cordy, Joyce, Angel and the master.  4 question, how did you like principal Flutie? 5 I think this episode was a small turning point for Will, having Xan insult her like that made her start to think more about her appearance. 6 Giles's initial reaction to Buffy's concerns about Xander show some insight as to how he sees himself as a teenager."
buffy,35iovq,BlackMoonWolf3113,8,Sun May 10 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"principal flutie was cool. i liked the idea of him growing as a character. however at the time he was used very well to give the show a morbid credibility.  i thought giles reaction to this was a bit much, considering hes a watcher. he should have listened to the slayer."
buffy,35iovq,AngryWizard,3,Sun May 10 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"After the hyena initially possesses Xander, it gradually gets stronger. The more time passes in the episode, the stronger the hyena becomes. Xander getting frustrated with his homework is probably not only the hyena, I'm sure the character was genuinely frustrated. However, when he throws his homework in the trash, that is the hyena peaking out and beginning to take over.  And I agree, I always feel so sad for Willow in this episode.  Sidenote, I had the biggest crush on Xander in this episode as a young school girl!"

I think he performs well.   Willow says her and Xander weren't always close but it seems like they were in other episodes (yellow crayon). Also I feel so bad for her in this episode.   This is the first example of Xander getting away with doing horrible things without being called out on it. Buffy and Willow just kind of shrug it off as a joke, but to be fair a sixteen year old boy shouldn't   have to be able to deal with the idea of sexually assaulting his friend."
buffy,35iovq,The_Ripper42,2,Mon May 11 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"This is the first example of Xander getting away with doing horrible things without being called out on it.    Xander did horrible things when he was possessed... I don't think we can really fault him. In fact, he was only possessed in the first place because he was trying to save Lance from bullies.  Giles when talking about what happened to Xander says this:   GILES: Well, apparently there's a sect of animal-worshippers known as Primals. They believe that humanity, uh, consciousness, uh, the soul, is a perversion, a dilution of spirit. To them the animal state is holy. They are able, through trans-possession, to draw the spirit of certain animals into themselves.   Giles also, when doing his research, finds that he can use rituals for undoing demonic possession to drive the spirit out of Xander.  To me, it sounds as though what happened to Xander is more like what would happen if he became a vampire - he no longer has the same control over his behavior, but is instead a hyena/human hybrid, essentially soulless.  I don't think Buffy and Willow treat it as ""a joke,"" exactly... more that they don't feel it's necessary to dwell on. Xander has been cured, he's no longer a threat, and he wants to repair the damage to his friendship with both of them, so I think they all are willing to put it behind them."
buffy,35iovq,fmccool01,2,Wed May 13 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"You compare the possession to vampirism but when you look at Angel, who admittedly did more and much worse things, he feels some responsibility for what he did. I agree he can't actually be faulted with harassing Buffy, but pretending not to remember just so he doesn't have to apologize is less than admirable."
buffy,35iovq,DaddyCatALSO,3,Wed May 13 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"One thing I often find skipped over in discussions of this episode is those kids ate the principal. Those kids are ruined for life. Just to repeat. They ate the principal alive. But I guess because Buffy was so episodic in season 1 there was no time to explore any consequences in any other episodes. Speaking of consequences this is the first in a long line of things Xander gets away with throughout the series but because he was under some curse/possessed then is he really to blame for what he did? Overall, not one of the better season 1 episodes but by no means the worst episode of the season. The episode two weeks from now is the worst with a bullet."
buffy,35jci9,buffeq,20,Sun May 10 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there - the first season of Buffy is unarguably the lowest budget, least consistent season of the whole bunch.

buffy,35jci9,friggidydamn,9,Sun May 10 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"I like season 1 only in retrospect. Honestly, the fact you made it through season 1 and are still willing to move forward (with encouragement from us) bodes well. When I watch season 1 now, I enjoy watching the gang being introduced and their dynamics start to take form. This is not a majority opinion here, but if I'd started from the beginning I would have given up and missed out on my favorite show ever in the history of ever. (I started purely by happenstance mid-season 5).   So I say to you, keep watching if you can push through. The last few episodes of season 2 then into season 3 and beyond will pay off and I really think you'll be glad you stuck it out. It's a brilliant journey."
buffy,35jci9,AngryWizard,8,Mon May 11 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, an argument can be made for the first season being the worst. The series doesn't really pick up until mid season two. The show's writing noticeably and progressively matures over time and becomes more consistent.   When I first watched it through (and had no expectations for the quality), I was extremely surprised at how much better it got from the early episodes. By the end of season two I was completely hooked and by season 5 I was binge-watching half-seasons at a time.  I say stick with it and you won't be disappointed."

buffy,35jci9,pober,1 point,Tue May 12 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"This is my experience, too. I started watching because Whedon's name was attached. I was expecting campy, monster-of-the-week dreck, and for the first season, that's about what I got. But you could see the Whedon touch and knowing it started before Firefly, I knew the skill should improve, so I kept going. By the time s2 spoiler I was hooked. So far season 6 is my favorite and I'm currently catching up on Angel until the crossover happens because I over shot Buffy season 7 by, like, half a season.   It definitely gets better."
buffy,35jci9,Mr_Evil_Monkey,5,Mon May 11 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I started watching the show knowing absolutely nothing about it. I hadn't even seen other of Whedon's work. I had absolutely no expectations; I had just heard it was good.   So I actually didn't mind the campy stuff in the first season that much. I thought some of the episode set up for the stories were kind of dumb, but the characters made up for all of that and more, so I kept watching.   Once I hit The Pack, I thought it would be one of those episodes again, but it turned out a lot differently than I expected. The fact that  The Pack isn't even that great of an episode, but it showed me that if the show is willing have stuff like this in it, anything can happen and I knew I had to keep watching."

buffy,35jci9,SweetNigeyB,3,Mon May 11 09:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's like a lot of Whedon shows where there's kind of a slow burn at the beginning of the show.

buffy,35jci9,barre_chord_reality,2,Mon May 11 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"Almost every Buffy fan (including myself) isn't much of a season 1 fan. When I do my rewatches I usually skip it actually. The thing I like about it is the nostalgia but it came out when I was in 7th grade and that doesn't apply to you. I always tell people who are new to Buffy to give it to mid season 2, that's is where most people start to really get into it, don't give up over how lame season one is! ;)"
buffy,35jci9,melusina84,2,Mon May 11 10:18:33 2015 UTC,"When I recommend Buffy to people, I often suggest they skip season one, unless I'm really sure they'll be into the show -- hardcore Whedon fans who somehow haven't seen it yet, etc. You can summarize the actual plot arc of the season very quickly, since most of the episodes are monster-of-the-week.  The biggest problem with it IMO is the production values. They had shit for a budget, and it really shows. Modern audiences are a lot less willing to accept cheesy costumes, grainy camerawork, and unconvincing effects than people were in the 90s."

For me the show really shines in season 3 and season 5, the storylines are just amazing. I would never advocate skipping season 2 - it's a great season - I'm just saying you should stick with it. You'll be hooked at some point :)"

buffy,35l93n,ghostofjoyce,8,Mon May 11 12:38:37 2015 UTC,"You are entitled to your opinion and I understand it completely. Heck, when my toddler reaches her teen years I might even agree with you :)   The only reason I liked Dawn is I was living with a teenager the same age as her during season 5 & I was Buffy's age (I had a roommate with a daughter).   I adored my niece but sometimes her hormones were a bit much. She even looked like Dawn. It made me feel better when Dawn threw tantrums because I saw so much of Dawn in (I call her my niece) this girl. She was clumsy, awkward, loud, emotional, and demanding. But at the same time, she was so intelligent & beautiful I could tell she was something special. So we worked it out.   She's now a scientist working on a famous project for the Smithsonian and I couldn't be prouder. She grew into one of the most powerful young women I know and I only hope my daughter comes close to her brilliance.   I think the writers nailed her age spot on. I was such an idiot at that age, I won't traumatize you all with my story but let's just say I would have been much better off with a sister like Buffy to watch me."
buffy,35l93n,sarah_bellum75,5,Mon May 11 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"She's also left abandoned by nearly everybody, especially in season 6, where about the only people that really look out for her are Tara and Spike. She also didn't really fit in with with the Scoobies either, and didn't seem to have a network of friends to be with, so she had little in the way for emotional support.   To be honest, I felt really bad for her. Dawn never had a chance to shine, because she was always overshadowed."
buffy,35l93n,barre_chord_reality,5,Mon May 11 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"You're posting on social media but not looking for a discussion?  GTFO?

buffy,35l93n,ModerateBias,2,Wed May 13 10:52:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest, most posts about Dawn aren't very well thought out. This was basically just a hit piece, snipe and run. It doesn't do anything to add to the dialogue of what I think is an interesting character on the show."
buffy,35l93n,barre_chord_reality,5,Wed May 13 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"That escalated quickly. Haha.  I'm also not a huge fan of Dawn-I definitely don't have the hatred you do, but I also didn't like how they all babied her and pretty much coaxed her into being the stereotypical bratty teenager. I was neutral with her in season seven, season five I understood the overprotectiveness seeing as she was who she was, but season six made me want to tear my hair out watching her-the main point was that she was feeling insignificant and that no one was paying attention to her, when literally all anyone had been concerned with for the past year was her well-being and protection.   After Joyce dies, Dawn claims to need her mom. Upon seeing Buffy turn away from her at the reanimated Joyce's knock at the door, Dawn tears the photo in order to keep Buffy's newfound attention focused on herself. Adamant about seeing her mom again mere minutes earlier, Dawn rips Joyce's picture, essentially killing her for the final time. Dawn of the Dead indeed.   Well, that was because she knew what she was doing wasn't right. Joyce was a probable zombie, and Dawn realized just how traumatic that would have been had they opened the door and found their zombie mother standing there. If anything, that was Dawn's most selfless moment of the series, even if it came after one of her worst."
buffy,35l93n,theoremofgoats,2,Tue May 12 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"Dawn's most selfless moment of the series"" Yes."
buffy,35l93n,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed May 13 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Not that I'm interested in complaining about one of my favorite shows of all time, but I think about the show pre-Dawn and post-Dawn and I just have to agree. She is so integral to season 5 and 6 that her annoyances are too frequent to be ignored.  Your hatred is a bit more violent than I've seen, but I understand the distaste for the character completely. Her voice bugs me the most, enough to make me skip many scenes with her."
buffy,35l93n,angryelves,2,Tue May 12 12:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm watching season 6 for the first time, and it really strikes me how she makes everything about her. She's always the victim. Some crisis attracts everyone's attention? It's because they don't care about Dawn. Off she goes to her room.  Like I just watched Normal Again. Buffy is having a nervous breakdown, and all Dawn talks about is how she's not in Buffy's ""perfect"" alternate reality."
buffy,35l93n,GooGooGajoob67,2,Tue May 12 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"Dawn always made me mad because she is such a caricature of a bratty teenager. When Buffy, Willow and Zander were teenagers they were intelligent and layered, even when they were screwing up. Half of what Joss was trying to do was subvert everyone's perceptions of teenagers. Dawn goes right back to the way they've always been played on tv. I realize Dawn was a bit younger but still, no nuance at all."

She danced with him one time and everyone gives him a pass to be a complete dick. In season 5, he got better. He pulled a dick move in 6, but I don't completely blame him. He was quite manageable in season 7. But early Xander pisses me off."

buffy,35fax7,sleepyfloyd,3,Sat May 9 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"Wait... Willow and Simmons? Why are they alike?  [Spoilers ahead:]  As for Ward, i would say he started as Angel, then became Angelus, but is currently leaning more towards Spike. But he's a very interesting character, and a very interesting antagonist, which is rare in the MCU, so I try not to compare him to anything. He's worth having a personality of his own."
buffy,35fax7,monina42,1 point,Sat May 9 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"Spoilery Spoiler:  The only similarity I see between Willow and Jemma is that both started off as rather shy nerds and later became much darker, ready to kill without remorse.  As for Ward, he started off as Angelus pretending to be Angel, then showing his true face as Angelus and now still is Angelus. I don't see any redeeming quality in him and no one of the team was ready to forgive him. I'd rather see him dead than showing up over and over again doing something shady.  I see a bigger chance for redemption with Cal(before he sacrifice himself for his daughter). But I don't see too many similarities between him and the mayor, beside the parental feelings for another character. All Wilkins did was for his own gain, while Cal only cared about Daisy, which drove him over the edge."
buffy,35fax7,lavelle1982,1 point,Sun May 10 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Ward on a vision quest to regain his soul would be a very weird thing indeed. I don't think the show will move him back towards Shield. That would take so much explaining/hand waving; not really possible.   But Buffy showed how cool and funny such a loose cannon could be. Spike in S4/5 is a major source of humour and fun. Sure, they had to use this terrible clutch of ""chip in brain"" to make it work, but still. Wasn't it worth it? Ward isn't as cool as Spike, but I do think he could play a similar role. Angelus had to die after S2, because there's just no way he could've worked as a recurring villain/part time team member. Spike needed some shoehorning, but it did work. If AoS decides to let Ward live after this finale, I really hope they take Spike as a blueprint for him. Yeah, ""brain washing"" or whatever would be terrible story telling, but meh... perhaps it's worth it.  Oh, and Cal and the Mayor may not share the exact same motivation (although in the end, Wilkins was motivated by revenge for Faith. That he went after the Scoobies the way he did, when things became personal, was only after Buffy ""killed"" his adopted daughter.), but they are so similar otherwise. This chipper, cheery old daddy thing for an antagonist/villain? I can't really tell any other show with such an character. I still think it's pretty damn great."
buffy,35fax7,pinkb0t,1 point,Sun May 10 07:37:35 2015 UTC,"Simmons has the same hidden darkness Willow had been showing from time to time after Season 3. At first, the show illustrated what a bad liar she was, how she couldn't tell a lie to save her life. Now she's been embedded with Hydra, fooled Bobbi without loosing a beat (in a strenuous and dangerous situation) and is hiding the truth about what happened to Senor Bakshi. She's also the only ""good"" characters of the show who attempted premeditated, cold-blooded murder. I see lots of similarities between this and the Willow->Dark Willow arc."

(I've never read the comics, so if it was ever covered in those, I wouldn't know, but I would have loved to see it while either one was on the air).    I also thought it would have been kind of bad ass if Buffy showed up in the last minute of  the Angel finale to help them fight.  I mean Angel did go to Sunnydale and offer to help Buffy in her fight with the first, so having her arrive in the Angel finale with a bunch of slayers for the final battle seems like a decent repayment of the favor."
buffy,35egiy,hashk,1 point,Tue May 12 01:54:40 2015 UTC,They didn't meet because the networks for season 6 of Buffy and season 3 of Angel could not use characters going through both shows. This changed in season 7. But there is actually a comic which showed in detail what happened that night.

buffy,35dvmd,Skaks,20,Sat May 9 11:13:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of people kind of miss the point about normal again. Just quoting from a previous thread, (there have been lots about 'Normal Again').    The point is that Buffy (since coming back) is disconnected from the world. She feels that she has no reason/doesn't want to be there any-more. So I think the crucial factor of the episode is Buffy reconnecting with the world, finding a reason to keep her there and engaged with this reality.    A quote from Buffy Wikia with inserts from Joss    According to Joss Whedon, this episode was the ""ultimate postmodern look at the concept of a writer writing a show,"" as it questioned fantastical or inconsistent elements of the show ""the way any normal person would."" Whedon added that the episode is intentionally left open to interpretation; the actual cause of the delusions, either the poison or Buffy's return to ""reality"", is not made explicitly clear. ""If the viewer wants,"" Whedon says, ""the entire series takes place in the mind of a lunatic locked up somewhere in Los Angeles... and that crazy person is me."" Although, ""personally, I think it really happened.""    So in closing, the ending is really what you want it to be, Joss leaves that up to the viewer. But what I think is really the point of the episode, is Buffy solidifying herself in her world again. Up to this point, Buffy has not wanted to be here, she wants to go back to ""heaven"" or whatever your personal interpretation of where she was is. This episode is really her deciding that she wants to be here again (if maybe only for selfless reasons), and that Buffy (in terms of arc) can move forward with her life again."

buffy,35dvmd,SarahSEZ,2,Sat May 9 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"Buffy tumbled through the looking glass and down into the rabbit hole in Normal Again. It's difficult to completely 100% bounce back from mental illness, whether it's depression, anxiety, or (in Buffy's case) delusions.   This may be a dark interpretation, but I tend to believe that the final scene in the episode is symbolic. She went rather deep into the rabbit hole, so to speak. I think any human who went through that experience would always secretly wonder if she's still in that mental ward. Who wouldn't question their reality after such an experience?  So the final scene, in my opinion, means Buffy herself will always remember and question if she's still in that room. It's a memorial in her mind."

buffy,35ab5y,kodachikuno,6,Fri May 8 18:53:57 2015 UTC,There's a line between two characters  (not SMG)  where one of the girls says to a guy that hes not a professional monster slayer because it's not a thing.

buffy,35czes,10iss,3,Sat May 9 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"Because when Buffy sacrificed herself to save Dawn at the end of Season 5 her friends couldn't let go and they automatically assumed she was in a hell dimension and so they brought her back to life. By doing this they defied the laws of nature and broke the rules by bringing her back, resulting in The First retaliating (sending bringers around the world to kill the watchers and all the potential slayers and end the line of slayers and bringing forth the 'uber' vamps, unleashing another apocalypses.) After knowing this Buffy concludes  that if she had of let Dawn die none of that would have happened and countless lives would have been saved (all the potentials and watchers that the bringers killed). Or something a long those lines? Did I miss anything or get anything wrong fellow Buffy fanatics? Please feel free to clarify or add on :)"
buffy,35czes,TheSilenceListens,5,Sun May 10 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think this is part of it, but she now realizes that a leader has to be able to make impossible decisions and huge sacrifices for the good of the world, and after all she's been through, she understands this better now.   Back in season 5 she was still looking to Giles as the leader, where as in season 7 we see her fully embrace the role of leader and all the bad shit that comes with that position (she got potentials killed, the potentials don't like her, her friends turn on her, etc). She's matured, and she understands now that (like you said) in retrospect, letting Dawn go would have been the right decision."

buffy,35czes,keeveralexander,1 point,Sun May 10 05:07:30 2015 UTC,"The points made so far are fairly good, but I think it's important to remember Buffy's position in season 5 too. Riley left, Joyce died, and Dawn was the only family she had left. She wasn't willing to lose Dawn. But also, the situation is different. In season 5 its a straight ""Dawn dies = portal closes"", in season 7 that choice doesn't exist. It's more just that if she dies, the battle goes on because it's a war, not fighting one person like Glory."
buffy,35czes,jaguars5,1 point,Mon May 11 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from message boards back in 2003, this was one of many things from S7 that was scrutinized by fans and another sign that the some of people writing just didnt care anymore.   The idea behind it was seemingly that Buffy was now a ""leader"" and had to make tough choices, but nothing happened that would make fans believe Buffy culd let Dawn die.   Another similar example that comes to mind is how the Scoobies kick Buffy out of her own house in the 3rd to last episode. Totally out of character and was criticized by fans."
buffy,35cvy4,buffsterlover,6,Sat May 9 02:22:43 2015 UTC,Hi drunken Buffy lover!  P. S. Season 6 is my favorite. It's brutal but amazing.

Back in 1999/2000, I recorded every episode on VHS. I used to watch certain episodes over and over again.  The Pack Angel Prophecy Girl Inca Mummy Girl I Was Made To Love You  These episodes and probably a few more were played every night on my VCR.

buffy,35cgfk,bwburke94,2,Sat May 9 18:36:03 2015 UTC,Would she? She didn't really seem to have any point aside from being Willow's girlfriend.
buffy,35cgfk,sylban,4,Sat May 9 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"She was introduced to be a more ""vulnerable"" female, since Willow was getting too powerful.  I expect she'd have been killed off earlier or transferred to Angel, since her role would be redundant on Buffy after Dawn's introduction."
buffy,35cgfk,bwburke94,3,Sat May 9 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"It was disclosed to the cast at the beginning of Season Four, so the decision was final before then. I think it was probably made no later than halfway through Season Three, because I think ""Doppelganland"" would have been done differently if it hadn't been. That episode contains a very strong hint, in Angel's uncompleted reply to Buffy after Willow gets to meet her vampire alter ego.  I think what hadn't been decided by then, though, was who the love interest would be. As I understand it, Tara was not originally introduced for that reason, but instead was supposed to provide a vector for Willow to stray to the dark side of magic. (That was later provided instead by Amy.) Seth Green had to leave to work on Family Guy, which would have left a sudden romantic void in Willow's life, and Tara was available to fill that role."
buffy,35cgfk,sylban,-1,Sat May 9 07:19:31 2015 UTC,"""Doppelgangland"" was pretty much the point where Willow decides she's bisexual.   Willow: And I think I'm kinda gay.   I'm a firm believer that Willow was still bi in Season 4, and was still interested in men up until early season 5 when she decided to be an outright lesbian."
buffy,35cgfk,DaddyCatALSO,11,Sat May 9 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"When she utters the line you cite, the ""I"" in that statement refers to her vampire version, not the person speaking. That is clear from context: She also doesn't think of herself as 'skanky'. She thinks her other version is skanky. And she thinks her other version is 'kind of gay'. She does not suspect this yet about herself personally.  The clue is instead supplied shortly after that remark, when Buffy points out that the vampire version a person takes on does not reflect who they were before that. Angel starts to correct her, but Buffy gives him a 'look' that signals him to redirect his comment. In sum, we are to understand that not-vampire Willow could be ""kind of gay,"" but Willow herself is not yet aware of it -- only that her vampire version seems to be."

The examples you give are fine and maybe for women the flow of sexuality is more fluid. It just would of been amazing to see a fully realised male couple like Willow and Tara, there journey was well written and devoid of stereotypes, unlike the pervy season 8 buffy."
buffy,35cgfk,DaddyCatALSO,2,Wed May 20 22:10:40 2015 UTC,"As an additional point of interest, the male to female ratio of the show would've been REALLY different, because Buffy, Xander, and Willow would've all been interested in men. This would've made Buffy and Willow (and, later, Dawn) the only female Scoobies, seeing as all the later additions to the gang were significant others. Riley, Spike, and (of course) Giles, would remain the same, plus a boyfriend each for Xander and Willow."

I just don't think the frat boy heavy writing team did not know how or had the balls to try it. For me Riley and Xander had a real Bromance going."
buffy,35cgfk,bwburke94,1 point,Sat May 9 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"Buffy's little touristing made perfect sense to me; she had about as many men around as a woman in prison, for no other reason."

Hot, interesting girls like Willow, Cordelia, Faith and Anya were attracted to him despite his lack of qualities, because it was flattering to us.  He was also the character Joss identified with.

I also think you're overlooking how incredibly powerful it would be for the audience for an ""everyman"" character like Xander to come out as gay or bisexual. Especially since not everyone in the audience is a straight dude, so treating one as the ""audience stand-in"" can be more alienating than comforting.

buffy,358s8o,r-u-aware-ur-a-cat,2,Fri May 8 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"Well, to this day one of the funniest jokes I've ever made (according to my friends) is ""I wish I could just be like Buffy and stab all my problems in the heart with a stake""  In all seriousness, though, I only watched Buffy sporadically when it was on TV. I was young and out being my own version of Buffy. However, I've been going through a rough patch this past year and Buffy has been a huge comfort to me. Her strength, even under the immense amount of pressure she is under, always makes me feel like I can pull through. This may sound dumb, but if I need to have a moment of confidence or face a hard moment, I close my eyes and visualize myself as Buffy and my problems as vampires or demons. I choreograph long fight scenes in my head and I always come out of those moments feeling better and more powerful and ready to kick ass.  This is the first time I've participated in the fandom, but it's really cool to see how everyone supports each other. It's a great place to be, not a lot of drama like I have seen in some other fandoms."

buffy,358s8o,legobunny,2,Fri May 8 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted to write, but it wasn't until I watched Buffy (in 2010 - I'm a late bloomer) that I actually sat down to write. It was absolutely inspired by Buffy. It was fanfic.  After loving the reaction and feedback, I decided, with encouragement from Buffy friends I'd met online, to try to write something apart from the Buffyverse. Something ""of my own.""  Through feedback of my Buffy friends, all of whom I'd gotten to know through boards, I learned how to write better. Eventually, I submitted to an editor and was offered a contract. And then another.  I am working on a trilogy and a series! I'm delighted. It's a dream come true that wouldn't have happened if not for 1) the inspiration of Buffy to begin with and 2) the support of Buffy fans.  I have since met 5 of these people in real life.  They also serve as beta readers for my stories and have helped in so many ways. One is an ER doctor, another is an archivist, another a nurse. I can turn to them for expertise in a moments notice.  I just finished a time-travel book about Billy the Kid. Where did I go to find someone to translate Spanish for me? The Buffy boards.  I feel incredibly honored to have been included among such wonderful people and to have found this intense, intelligent and loyal group of people."

That episode in which Jonathan wants to shoot people and complains that no one cares about him and Buffy then says no one cares because everyone is busy dealing with their own messy lives... (she said it better of course :) )  Also, more generally, it's a show about a strong hero, but that hero is flawed. As is everyone else. We see weakness and uncertainty and wrong decisions and regret and that by EVERY single character. And that makes most of these characters amazing role models. Because that's just how it works."
buffy,358s8o,furryoso,2,Fri May 8 08:31:27 2015 UTC,I will definitely take you up on those academics references once I finish up work today! Thank you so much for the offer.
buffy,358s8o,BuffyRules3000,2,Fri May 8 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm 32, watched Buffy in its original run, and rewatch when I need a pick me up. As other people have mentioned, it's very comforting. Oddly so.   None of my friends watch Buffy, but sometimes when they are going through a rough patch, a Buffy quote comes to mind to perfectly fit their situation. Neither of the quotes I told them are particularly popular, and I didn't tell them they were from Buffy, but they really connected to them, and made them feel better about their situation. The two quotes were (and these are just paraphrases), ""If you were more open minded your brain would fall out of your head."" and, ""Everyone thinks their exception is exceptional."" Personally the last one resonates with me the most (even if it was said by a villain doesn't make it less true)."
buffy,358s8o,mickey5499,2,Fri May 8 13:17:37 2015 UTC,"My first introduction to online forums was The Bronze Shelter... this was back in 2000 maybe? There was a Bronze (and some other forums) that I had never joined, and the the Bronze Shelter was created as a place where people would be more friendly (ie no trolls).  You could post any opinion you wanted, and you could disagree however you wanted, but you had to do so respectfully.  It was a great introduction to the Buffy community as (1) I saw that people were able to start their own communities based on respect, (2) I learned that fan fiction was a thing and it could get really, really inappropriate, and (3) that there were other people in this world that were into this show as much (actually much more) than I was.  My friends weren't into the show and instead of hitting the bars, I'd watch the show, pour me a great drink, and then go on-line and chat about it.  Made some good friends on that forum that I still keep in touch with. Sadly broke my mug last year... but somewhere I have a recipe book that was put out.  Good times."
buffy,358s8o,theperfectend,2,Fri May 8 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"What's great about Buffy is that it details mistakes made by flawed characters and how those flawed characters deal with those mistakes. Every character in Buffy is flawed, much like every person on this planet is flawed in one way or another. This is what makes Buffy connect with fans and make them feel comforted.  A specific example from Buffy that I connected with was the transition from High School to college. Buffy was always desperate to get out of High School, and she left by literally blowing up the school. After graduation, there was nothing to even look back to Then She gets to college, and it's not as great as she thought it would be. She gets played by Parker, she doesn't really make any friends other than Riley, and she just has a hard time adjusting overall. I had a similar rough patch when I went to college, although I enjoyed my high school experience very much. I had a really hard time making friends, and since everyone around me was so into partying I felt isolated and alone. Most of my old friends were not around or just gone from my life completely. What I loved about season four (Although its not my favorite season) was that the show actually got some things right about college. Like how a lot guys are really just clueless d-bags, how it can be difficult to make new friends, and how you can drift away from your old friends and lose some completely. One of my favorite quotes from season 4 is from ""Fear Itself"", a few guys from the frat house are setting up for the Halloween party and one of the says ""Halloween isn't about thrills, chills, and costumes; it's about getting laid!"" Then the other guy responds: ""What holiday isn't about getting laid?!"" (Arbor Day). While I laughed hysterically, it's that attitude/lifestyle about college that Buffy captures better than any other show I've seen."
buffy,358s8o,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri May 8 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"In general, the Buffy fandom as a whole is so accepting. People are really warm to each other regardless of differences in opinion or otherwise. In real life I'm not a very social person, but the online Buffy fandoms, especially on Reddit and Tumblr, have opened me up to knowing so many amazing people and bringing me out of my shell. I now have so many more friends as a result of the show and it really has helped me feel ""accepted"" in a way."

buffy,356uri,bwburke94,2,Fri May 8 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"I think what got me the most was that just after she sent Angel to hell and started crying, the lyrics for that song started with ""The winter here is cold and bitter, it's chilled us to the bone"".  It just seemed so perfect with how she was feeling.  And then as she watched her friends, not knowing they were wondering where she was, the lyrics said ""I'm pulled down by the undertow, never thought I could feel so low"", and then she walked away.

Then because they used him so much for these circumstances it became a running joke behind the scenes that the Jonathan character always ended up being a victim (kind of like Kenny from South Park without all the death).  Eventually they started giving him more lines, more parts which led to more of a development of his character.   I believe I heard of all this from an episode commentary though unfortunately I don't remember which one."
buffy,3527vy,rywon,2,Thu May 7 10:52:21 2015 UTC,That's pretty much my understanding. It's discussed in the commentary for either Earshot or Superstar (or both).
buffy,351far,marin4g,55,Wed May 6 08:45:25 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I took from this, is that he plans to ""start writing again"". I really, really hope that he's planning on a new Verse. It's been too long since Joss created a Universe on TV."

buffy,351far,paperd,33,Wed May 6 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"His analysis of what's good and bad about Twitter, including inevitable emotional investment, time consumption and politics, is a great read.   The ""writing again"" part of this makes me believe many involved in the Twitter drama don't follow his career closely. Months ago, he said it was very unlikely he'd be directing Avengers 3 & 4, “I couldn’t imagine doing this again. It’s enormously hard, and it [will] be, by [the time I would make ‘Avengers 3 & 4′], a good five years since I created anything that was completely my own.  I'd have been very surprised if he didn't leave Twitter for a while as he's ending a wholly adaptation-focused part of his career and looking at writing original content again. Marvel may be part of what he does, but it doesn't look like it will be all-consuming for him going forward. A phase of reduced social media involvement makes perfect sense."

buffy,351far,Sammyboy616,20,Wed May 6 12:16:56 2015 UTC,"The thing that confuses/pisses me off the most about this is that it never happens to people like Michael Bay to the same extent.  You've got some dodgy writing and awkward yet in-character joke leading to death threats to the guy who created things like Dollhouse and Buffy, and then in Transformers 4 they basically stop the movie for a 3 minutes to make a really forced joke about statutory rape laws, and there's not nearly the same reaction."
buffy,351far,paperd,28,Wed May 6 12:40:19 2015 UTC,Michael Bay definitely gets feminist backsplash.  But there's just so much to criticize about that man's body of work that it just falls into a sea of noise.
buffy,351far,Swarlolz,1 point,Wed May 6 14:43:58 2015 UTC,Yeah like how much piles of money he swims in.
buffy,351far,mehshombra,5,Thu May 7 00:41:46 2015 UTC,I think it's because everyone expects that from Michael Bay. Joss is held to a higher standard.  It's just like how no one cares that Michael Bay's writing is shit. It's what he does. But Joss writes something poorly? We're going to judge and analyze the flaws much more harshly because of the standards he has already set.
buffy,351far,catdoctor,17,Thu May 7 01:32:17 2015 UTC,"That's because Bay has not set the expectation that he is a feminist, where as Joss has earned his feminist cred. He is (unfairly) held to a higher standard. Personally, I saw ""Ultron"" yesterday and don't consider it anti-feminist or misogynist in the least. Any so-called ""feminist"" who thinks it is anti-feminist Ultron spoiler has her head firmly up her ass. The whole POINT of feminism as that women are capable of making their own choices, another spoiler"
buffy,351far,kateh01,10,Wed May 6 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"I thought it was Tony Stark joking that if he lifted Mjolnir he would be reinstating ""prima nocte/noctae"". Which was the kings right to sleep with a woman on her first night of marriage.  Most notably mentioned in Braveheart but also never proven to actually have happened."
buffy,351far,catdoctor,11,Wed May 6 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"Tony Stark and his father are notorious womanizers. Not the most attractive aspect of their characters. So Saying this was very much in character with Stark, and not a statement by Whedon as to whether or not this would be a good idea."
buffy,351far,Glass_Underfoot,-2,Wed May 6 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"There's a difference though between womanizing and a law that demands rape, and is thought to be made-up because it's so far beyond the pale. There are a million better jokes he could have made, the one he did was weird."
buffy,351far,VictahV,3,Wed May 6 23:17:51 2015 UTC,There is a difference. Hence Tony joking. Cmon.
buffy,351far,Glass_Underfoot,3,Thu May 7 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that line was kind of jarring."
buffy,351far,kateh01,11,Wed May 6 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I thought he was making a comment on the Nordic/Viking-ness of Thor's society.  I'm not trying to make some kind of statement about Thor, because there are women warriors in his society and the culture is connected to real-world history by looks and names really.  If anything it's a commentary on Stark not actually knowing much about Thor's society, which is supposed to be fairly advanced."
buffy,351far,Sammyboy616,10,Wed May 6 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Plus the fact that, until he started going out with Pepper, he was a pretty serious womaniser and this is the kind of weird/possibly-offensive joke he would make. I would have found it weird if anyone else had said it, but since it was Tony I thought it made sense."
buffy,351far,fraac,-11,Wed May 6 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"As I understand feminism (i.e. from what I've seen on twitter) it's split into two large camps, only one of which is about women making choices, while the other is about class struggle, with individuals not mattering so much. Joss supports the former, while his friends Anita Sarkeesian and Equality Now support the latter. I'd like to see them argue about it but unfortunately Twitter isn't the venue, so they all have to be mutually supportive which is boring and unenlightening for the rest of us."
buffy,351far,matsie,12,Wed May 6 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"This is wholly inaccurate and untrue. That isn't a correct characterization of Anita Sarkeesian or Joss Whedon's politics. They are all intersectional feminists. Joss speaks to women making their own choices and to class struggle in his works and Anita Sarkeesian talks about female agency CONSTANTLY in her critiques. I'm puzzled why you would think Sarkeesian and Whedon are at odds with each other just because Sarkeesian critiqued his film.  ETA: Just because one feminist focuses on say, reproductive rights while another focuses on queer rights or class struggle or POC rights does not mean that those feminists are necessarily at odds with each other. There is a matrix of overlapping issues and feminism is trying to change a lot of things. That isn't to say the feminist subculture is perfect. Kill your darlings, kids."
buffy,351far,fraac,-9,Wed May 6 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's correct, and it's definitely the most common fight between feminists on Twitter.  ""Feminism is about the collective liberation of women as a social class. Feminism is not about personal choice.""  That seems fundamentally opposed to what Joss believes, and probably why she retweeted criticisms of AoU."
buffy,351far,kateh01,9,Wed May 6 20:00:02 2015 UTC,Why would you use a tweet instead of a dictionary to define feminism?
buffy,351far,fraac,-4,Wed May 6 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"There's no one definition, only what people believe."
buffy,351far,kateh01,6,Wed May 6 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"And then there's the actual, dictionary definition that rational people use."
buffy,351far,fraac,-3,Wed May 6 20:16:21 2015 UTC,Okay but when you're talking to another person you need to relate to them and try to understand the differences.

AoU was a major studio tentpole movie with a lot going on. It's not hard to see how certain things might get a little muddled despite the director's best intentions.   But it's pretty clear now that none of that had anything to do with his leaving twitter anyways."
buffy,351far,heymeowmeow,10,Wed May 6 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"Because feminism is a generic term that doesn't have one set in stone ideology. There are countless different opinions under that giant umbrella term.   Also, as the other person mentioned, identifying as a feminist doesn't make you free from criticism. Everyone says/does/thinks prejudiced things over the course of their life even if overall they're very supportive of marginalized groups. To be flawed is to be human. It's a matter of recognizing when that happens and trying to keep your prejudices in check."

buffy,351far,Victuswolf,3,Wed May 6 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Accusing Joss Whedon of sexism? Really?   The bloody creator of the Legend that is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy is one of the most beloved, strongest, emotionally deep, grounded and bad ass characters in all science fiction.   I can't think of any character in a science fiction show that is as fleshed out, real, and is as strong as Buffy. By strong I don't mean kick your ass strong although she certainly could. I mean strong of character. I am a guy and as sad as it may seem to some people but I looked up to ""Buffy"" the character. Everything she had to deal with from being raised by a single mom, being kicked out of school, not fitting in because of her ""gift/curse"" and never really having the chance to live life like many people take for granted due to her responsibilities. Then you have the love of her life turning into a monster, having to send him to hell after he finally got his soul back, him leaving to prevent it happening again, dying twice, being brought back from Heaven and feeling as if this life is hell (something a lot of people can relate too) her mom dying suddenly and buffy was the one who found the body. Having all her friends turn on her after years of sacrificing everything to protect them.   It might all be science fiction but there are people out there that go through a lot of horrible shit, who never get the chance at a child hood or have to take on responsibilities from a very young age. When you or others you care about are dealing with that it's nice to find something out there even if its a fiction to relate to and give you the mind set of never give up.  I have some one close to me who from the age of 14 all the way too 25 became a full time carer for her grand mother. Then her aunt fell Ill and she was the one who took on the responsibility of caring for her instead of letting her family put her in a home. Now she's taking care of her mom who has been constantly in and out of hospital, has died once but they brought her back, nearly died a few times since. Her mom has severe breathing issues and is on oxygen 24/7. She has spent her entire young adult life caring for people and for someone like that sometimes all they can relate too is a fictional character as to be fair most people would not give up that much. For that she will always have my love, my help and respect. That's what it is to be someone who deserves respect. To give up so much for so little.  Buffy isn't just strong female character. Buffy is the embodiment of sacrifice. She is what it means to give up most of your life for others and that transcends gender or any of this feminist or sexist bull crap that we constantly see now.  People need to look beyond bloody gender as men and women are NOT that fucking different. We might have a few more hormones here and there with different private parts but that's about it. Men are just as emotionally as women and Women are just as cold as men. There is no significant difference there or any difference between the sexes despite what the media & out of date cultural mind sets might try to shove down our throats.  Feminists, Humanists, sexists, traditionalists or whatever people want to label themselves is doesn't matter. If you want to be treated with respect in this life you have to respect yourself and the people around you. You have to make sacrifices and act responsible. People seem to think they should be respected no matter how they fucking act. That's were some of the crap we see now comes from.  Of course people are coming after Joss they don't see anything beyond their own bubble where their life revolves around them, they join themselves to a cause who in some ways values the freedom of acting irresponsible, being free of consequences and yet still feeling entitled to respect."

In any case, even if it were true that he didn't leave Twitter because of militant feminists, does that make their harassment any more justified?

Personally watched buffy all through once, then did Angel all at once and didn't feel like I had missed much.  Edit: also not a big fan of Angel on ""Buffy"" but the series makes him a much better character, IMO.

There are subtle nods to Buffy episodes, though, and the crossovers are fun.

I used this during my run: http://buffyfest.blogspot.com/2009/04/buffyangel-episode-watching-guide.html It's not perfect, but it does work pretty good. Sometimes I feel like it does switch too often, but it keeps it kinda lined up timewise I think."
buffy,3534qd,TheDoctor_13,1 point,Thu May 7 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"I had only seen the first season before, so last year decided to watch the whole thing. I am still 4 episodes from the end because ugggggh I just don't enjoy it. It has become a chore.   I absolutely loved Angel on BtVS though."
buffy,3534qd,theperfectend,1 point,Thu May 7 10:08:35 2015 UTC,"I did the chronological watch for a while but I found that because the two shows have very different tones to them, I'd be in the mood for one but not the other, or wouldn't want to interrupt the momentum, etc. It started feeling like work to slavishly follow the chronological order. So, you can definitely watch all of one and then all of the other and not miss much. If you do that, though, I would recommend that you watch the Buffy S4/Angel S1 episodes that overlap in that chronological order (especially B: Pangs/A: I Will Remember You, and I think B: This Year's Girl & Who Are You/A: Sanctuary, but check the list), because that's when they have the most direct plot interaction. After that the two shows start diverging more and more and even the episodes that feature a character from the other show don't require you to be watching chronologically to appreciate it.   For example, I don't think Angel's appearance in Forever has a big lead-in on his own show... maybe a shot of him getting a phone call about Joyce or something, I don't remember, but it wasn't much. There is also an Angel episode in season 2 that is a mirror of Fool for Love which is cool to watch in sequence with FfL, but that's all I can really remember."
buffy,350lg3,coolbeaNs92,13,Wed May 6 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"That truly bummed me out. Joss made the Avengers story a top notched film, without him it'd just be Iron Man 32.  Keep up the great work Joss. You are inspirational!"
buffy,350lg3,JudeauChop,1 point,Wed May 6 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that because immediately after seeing Avengers (which I actually really liked, but I'm a Marvel fangirl), I posted on fb that I loved that they made Iron Man 3 with so many cameos and punchy Buffy-esque dialogue. I knew it was Joss, but the whole thing felt like they were trying to drag everyone along on RDJ's coattails. I understand the group dynamics of the Avengers, and I know how ensemble movies work, but they could have at least tried to pretend that it wasn't all about Iron Man with some eye candy and a charismatic villain."
buffy,350lg3,UnKamenRider,8,Wed May 6 04:43:19 2015 UTC,"Really? I felt it was more  an ensemble piece like it was intended, especially with Cap and Stark butting heads. And Hawkeye being the heart of the group with Black Widow and Hulk being adorable. For me at least, Tony was the last person on my mind in being a standout from the crowd."
buffy,350lg3,Blackcrow521,3,Wed May 6 06:44:10 2015 UTC,"Not to fault the film but come on, that's the most fascinating thing to come out of MCU among other fan fave name drops and cameos and interesting story threads.  Every film about the each character matters, it pushes the character forward. And being in so many films, Tony is the most developed one. You can see and follow his thought process into every decision and each film simply ""cuts"" him deeper. That's is most fascinating thing after decades of movie sequel making. Almost all sequels ""resets"" the plates in a way."
buffy,350lg3,leo-g,1 point,Wed May 6 08:51:23 2015 UTC,"I think the other inevitable reason that Tony Stark is the toroidal fusion heart of the franchise is that he's truly God and America, not Thor or Cap. A brilliant rapid-prototyper engineer, attractive, brash and flawed -- He's what's left of everything the West reveres and aspires to in the post-collapse world."
buffy,350lg3,0ddbuttons,18,Wed May 6 10:09:50 2015 UTC,I'm a bit shocked that Joss of all people is being accused of these types of things. I don't know of anyone who has presented more strong and complex female characters in their career.
buffy,350lg3,Anla-shok,7,Wed May 6 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"Same here! I was so surprised to see Joss of all people accused of being a misogynist about a year ago. Obviously it is very probable that his every move isn't politically correct, but can you really throw away his life's work for a single controversial line said by a character that actually might say that? I really think people have a hard time distinguishing the screenplay writer and the character as separate people with separate minds. The joke in question, while tasteless, isn't really far off of Tony Stark's character, you know, probably the most obnoxious person in the (Marvel) universe.  Some people simply feed off of the toxicity brought by fanaticism I think, and empathy just gets lost somewhere along the way."
buffy,350lg3,salvodaze,6,Wed May 6 08:08:06 2015 UTC,you make a good point. People sometimes have a hard time differentiating the writer from the character. I'm surprised that this still has to be said.

buffy,350lg3,PhoxPhucker,4,Wed May 6 07:22:58 2015 UTC,"Some Twitter users didn't like elements of Avengers 2, particularly Black Widow, and aggressively (some quite threateningly/abusively) directed their anger at Joss on Twitter. Joss, who is not expected to direct or confirmed as writer for future Avengers movies and might have other things on his mind, thanked those who'd been lovely and deleted his account.   The still-roiling effluvium of Gamer Gate picked it up as evidence of feminists being bad, crazy, awful cannibals of those who support their cause. The drama really centers around correlation/causation about when Whedon deleted his account and those who want to spin that into a story benefiting their position in other areas of online cultural dust-ups."
buffy,350lg3,0ddbuttons,6,Wed May 6 09:48:21 2015 UTC,"I know we did have a post about Joss leaving Twitter a few days ago, but I thought James Gunn made some really good points on the fandoms and the Twitterverse  Also, its AoU spoiler free! So read without fear :)  edited"

buffy,350lg3,0ddbuttons,2,Wed May 6 04:53:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just saw the movie tonight, and have been seeing crap at Joss Whedon every since the new Avengers came out. No one bothered putting that it was against Joss or anything so I saw several spoilers before even seeing the movie, made me so annoyed when I saw that stuff. But oh my god I loved the movie! It was so amazing and perfect to me and I will be so angry and upset if Joss doesn't come back for the next 2 Avengers movies."
buffy,350lg3,Mquestionmark,1 point,Wed May 6 07:05:41 2015 UTC,"Fortunately (given drama) and unfortunately (good thing ending), the expectation that he's not directing 3 & 4 pre-dates all this nonsense. That doesn't mean he's confirmed to be out of writing or co-writing, though.   It's almost certainly a good thing. He likes to do stuff with characters that challenge the audience to genuinely think within context. That's a rough paradigm for the writer of a mass-market popcorn behemoth franchise.   He's had a great string of hits, and stepping back into original writing with that clout while simultaneously doing some Marvel work will very likely be an incredible time in his career."
buffy,350lg3,GhostSongX4,2,Wed May 6 09:34:45 2015 UTC,"This was the last straw for me identifying myself as a feminist.  Third wave feminism is a ridiculously violent and disorganized trainwreck. Reading some of the ""tweets"" sent to Joss made me sick to my stomach and honestly I don't know how harassment or threat laws work in the US, but some of those people should at the very least be talked to by police about the weight of such things.   Once you start actually sending those messages to the person it becomes a legitimate threat and stalking/cyberbullying/harassment should be punished.   The whole thing makes me feel ill."
buffy,350lg3,ModerateBias,18,Wed May 6 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"Don't let those fuckers redefine what it is to be a feminist.   Because all that bullshit that they spew day in and day out is not feminism. It's at best, masturbatory noise created for the soul purpose of exploiting something so that they can get fucking attention. That's all they care about. They are little better than a bratty toddler. They don't give a shit about gender equality. They just want to scream outrage like little lazy internet terrorists and bully people into catering to emotions that they don't even have in the first place. They are just regurgitating some bullshit they read on Tumblr.   And yeah, all this shit seems to stem from fucking Tumblr. These rabid social justice warriors screaming at people, the growing mens rights misogynists of Gamergate too. Shit, last week did anyone else notice that sheer number of racist posts during the Baltimore riots? I began to strongly suspect that there were white power groups using the internet to spread their message to susceptible teenagers. Because that's how those groups operate. They find a segment of kids who are angry and disenfranchised for some reason or another and they sell them a reason to fight. I don't think it's any different with SJW and misogynists.   And, apparently it is a crime to harass someone on the internet. Except nothing will be done. Police don't take those threats seriously and there needs to be something like three citeria for arrest. The means, the motive and the intent. So if you just tweet that someone should die, and they're in California and you're in Vermont and you don't have the ability to fly to Cali or buy a gun or something then nothing is going to happen."

Just a touch ironic, in that whedon was the person who made me realize i am a feminist.

buffy,350lg3,deedeethecat,5,Wed May 6 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"Oh please don't let fanatics and harrassers change your mind about what you can identify yourself as. I am a feminist and I believe everyone should at least look up the definition in the dictionary before saying they are not, but these people are just horrible Internet trolls that aren't much better than any notion they stand against. They are simply bullies and they should not affect your beliefs."
buffy,350lg3,surrenderthenight,3,Wed May 6 08:10:50 2015 UTC,Whether he left just to write or because of threats doesn't matter. Letting militant feminists define feminism is like letting Westboro Baptist define Christianity. Don't let them take power out of that identity.
buffy,350lg3,BrittBrat893,1 point,Wed May 6 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"Feminism is so diverse that individual feminist activism and focus is very broad. Feminists and others have every right to criticize aspects of a movie. But instead of offering constructive criticism, these bullies resorted to name calling and threats.  I consider myself a feminist and as such I'm not speaking for all feminists. I personally enjoyed this movie and did not see Black Widow's character as weak at all. Instead, I felt that giving her a bit of a backstory and focus on her relationships with others, made her a more three dimensional character. same with Hawkeyes background. I too get frustrated that a lot os movies have a romance between male and female leads in the sense that the female lead exists only to be a romantic partner to the male lead. This absolutely did not happen in Age of Ultron.  what I do plan on doing, however, is writing a letter to Marvel complaining about the lack of Black Widow merchandise. My spouse was in a comic book store the other day and a parent was in looking for black widow costumes for their child and the store clerk said that there simply wasn't any.  I have subsequently been comparing the age of ultron merchandise available through marvel and continually notice a huge discrepancy when it comes to Black Widow. Both boys and girls would benefit from female superhero stuff. Tragically, Marvel seems to forget that a good chunk of its viewers is female.  Joss's creation of three-dimensional female characters is one reason I love Buffy and Angel so much. He regularly compared and contrasted strength and vulnerability and God is a cross that you can be strong and vulnerable at the same time."

buffy,34vt72,heymeowmeow,11,Tue May 5 18:43:46 2015 UTC,It's interesting how much the concept of demons changed over the years. Initially it seems like demons are inherently evil with the one in a billion exception of the ensouled Angel. But then in Angel Season 1 we're introduced to the concept of peaceful demons and almost simultaneously Spike is given a chip and demons become a much grayer area after that.
buffy,34vt72,Mystery_White_Boy,5,Tue May 5 18:49:45 2015 UTC,If you look at Whistler at the end of season 2 you see a more peaceful Demon. Long before Angel we are introduced to demons that aren't working on the side of evil. Granted is still not a common occurrence at that point but it was a fairly early bit of world building for non-evil demons.
buffy,34vt72,heymeowmeow,4,Tue May 5 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"I actually considered mentioning Whistler as the first example of non-evil demons but he specifically states that he is the spawn of a demon and an agent of the Powers That Be and acts as a balancing power between good and evil so he feels more like another 1 in a billion exception like the ensouled Angel, even if he refers to himself as a demon."

buffy,34upln,fruitpunch_mouth,16,Mon May 4 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"I posted this comment here 5 hours ago but it shows only in my comment history but not in these comments, so copy/pasting it here again after contacting the mods:  Well shit. No idea if it's related, but he was getting attacked quite a bit from two fronts recently. He was publicly derided for being a feminist and a sjw from one group of outraged folks and publicly derided for being a privileged white male misogynist from another group of outraged folks.  He's not fucking perfect; how many times have we had lengthy debates on /r/buffy about Xander's entitlement issues, Spike's actions in seeing Red, or Buffy's mixed messages leading up to Seeing Red?  There are good discussions to be had about the positive or negative representation of women in Firefly, Dollhouse, Buffy, Angel, Dr Horrible, Avengers, but i've never once considered attacking Joss for inspiring us to have these conversations.   Again, this may end up being about something completely different, but it's the first thing I thought of after seeing some surprising reactions on social media lately."
buffy,34upln,AngryWizard,3,Tue May 5 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think it might be unrelated to the attacks online as he's taken breaks from Twitter before. He's been quoted as saying Twitter is like an extra full-time job.   However, regardless of anyone's opinion about Joss's portrayal of women or anything else he has been criticized for as of late, none of these people are creating an open dialogue by saying ""fuck you"" and sending death threats. That solves absolutely nothing!"
buffy,34upln,doyle871,3,Tue May 5 03:00:10 2015 UTC,Joss has been getting hell for over promoting women from one side and not promoting them enough from the other side. That's Social Media for you. My opinion is if you aren't pissing off both extremes you're doing it wrong.
buffy,34upln,AuthorTomFrost,9,Tue May 5 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"Good for Joss. Twitter is a shithole-by-design. 140 characters is just enough space to be a raging asshat, but not enough for any kind of nuanced thought.  He should move his social networking efforts to /r/buffy."
buffy,34upln,Red-Blue-,3,Tue May 5 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"Apparently he got harassed by trolls. He made the trolls 'win', but I can understand why he left twitter, if all it had to offer was toxicity.   Edit: I was wrong."
buffy,34upln,HomelessBoxBoy,10,Mon May 4 22:39:43 2015 UTC,Supposedly he said a while ago that he would be quitting when he no longer needed to promote Avengers. Was not aware until someone commented.
buffy,34upln,heymeowmeow,3,Mon May 4 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, Whedon's an AGENT OF THE PATRIARCHY, the guy that made Buffy, totally."
buffy,34upln,doyle871,8,Tue May 5 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, I do think there are problematic parts in some of his work, including Buffy (for example, Xander can be pretty fucked up at times and some of the time it's presented in a way like his being fucked up is ""right"" or ""justified"" instead of showing his fucked up actions as being in the wrong).   I think the key is to not get too caught up on either side of the argument and to recognize the good along with the bad and discuss them without falling into either extreme's trap of Savior-Feminist-Whedon vs. Patriarchal-Shitlord-Whedon. I think it's good to acknowledge the problematic issues and think about them and discuss them while not losing sight of the fact that the overall message is one of empowerment or losing sight of the fact that he/the show runners are human and make mistakes like the rest of us."
buffy,34upln,heymeowmeow,1 point,Tue May 5 16:20:17 2015 UTC,The problem is that most think only having perfect characters can be empowering. But perfect characters are boring. The most interesting characters in media tend to be screwed up in some way.
buffy,34upln,heymeowmeow,4,Tue May 5 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Also, as an addendum, I think the fandom's general love for Wesley's story arc in Angel shows that a lot of other people agree that flawed characters are more interesting."
buffy,34upln,rememberthealom,1 point,Tue May 5 18:43:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's an article out there that I found quite thought provoking about how Xander is the author's favorite character and about his struggle between his internal desires for good and love and his godawful role models of masculinity (his father). I don't know if I fully agree with the author or not but it makes rewatching more interesting with that as a way to frame my thoughts on him.
buffy,34upln,SoNotTheCoolest,2,Tue May 5 18:39:07 2015 UTC,I thought it was because he was possibly being sued over the cabin in the woods thing...

I should note, you need to be a confirmed follower of the guy to access his tweets now, he JUST made them private. I will repost his main tweet as soon as he confirms me to enable more people to see these bastards.  I don't care if I get death threats from feminists, myself.  Further edit:  Someone made a small compilation. People make me sad."
buffy,34upln,heymeowmeow,7,Tue May 5 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much just a stupid back and forth about how he's ""too feminist"" and then how he's ""not feminist enough."" It's all just sincerely absurd."
buffy,34upln,lifesbrink,3,Tue May 5 01:36:56 2015 UTC,Beyond absurd.  How can anyone seriously think the guy is sexist??
buffy,34upln,doyle871,9,Tue May 5 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, everybody has prejudices, it's just a matter of recognizing them and working on them. Having said that I think his overall record comes out to being pretty overwhelmingly empowering. I think people who nitpick every little issue and use it to discount all the good messages he puts forward are just being kinda contrarian/edgy."
buffy,34upln,heymeowmeow,4,Tue May 5 02:25:32 2015 UTC,Or extremely brain-damaged.
buffy,34upln,TheLantean,2,Tue May 5 02:28:13 2015 UTC,It's social Media unless you absolutely hate women your a feminazi/SJW and unless you think women are superior in every way and all white men are evil you're a CIS misogynist.   There's no middle ground for normal people.  He never seemed interested in social media and it was either Much a Do or Avengers that got him to go on to help promotion. If I was famous I'd never go on any social media you're just a target.
buffy,34upln,doyle871,3,Tue May 5 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"You don't even need to be a celebrity to be a social media target. One of the reasons I deleted my facebook is how often the media/Internet users at large find someone who made a mistake and suddenly they're famous for being the world's worst person or something. Or like, people with grudges going back and finding old posts from years before and parading them around to discredit people. It's kinda scary having a permanent record of growing up and making mistakes online for everyone to see."

buffy,34smkp,Sludgeycore,4,Mon May 4 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"Also thus Riley's ultimatum and the Xander/Buffy confrontation at the end of Into the Woods.  Xander finally got Buffy to realize what Riley meant to her, but it was too late."

buffy,34smkp,faaackksake,8,Wed May 6 12:39:13 2015 UTC,"nah she's doing him the courtesy of letting him know shes with someone else and that she's moved on, angel is the one who gets upset/angry"
buffy,34smkp,SavannahInChicago,6,Tue May 5 07:38:04 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was out of jealously for seeing him in an innocent, but compromising-looking position. If you remember, Buffy tells Angel about Riley after she realizes that she is loosing the argument at the police state. All of a sudden she stops arguing and pulls that ""I love my new boyfriend"" thing out of nowhere. I got the feeling the writers did it so they could have Angel move on, but Buffy did not have the same intention."

buffy,34qf83,Dog-boy,7,Sun May 3 23:50:08 2015 UTC,"A long while ago, they had a Supernatural Defense Kit that was Buffy themed. It had a vile of holy water, a cross necklace (although, it was gold for some reason), and this ring. I bought this in 2009, I believe. Maybe 2010. The ring didn't fit me until recently (yaaaay weight loss) but now I wear it ALL the time :)"

buffy,34rucd,Zix117,7,Tue May 5 10:50:29 2015 UTC,"For me, season 6 starting with episode 3, was post breakup therapy. Buffy's feelings were relatable. The self imposed isolation, depression, and music was great for me.  However.... Angel really was the best for me. There is an overall adult loneliness to the whole show. The recovery, in a sense, was just to keep fighting."
buffy,34rucd,theperfectend,5,Mon May 4 06:05:18 2015 UTC,"In Prophecy Girl, Xander gets rejected by Buffy, and later, Willow. We catch a glimpse of him afterwards while he leaves the phone off the hook and listens to country music.   Does Becoming count? It feels like it could the most brutal breakup on the show. SMG's tears after she stabs Angel with the sword....it makes me want to curl into a ball and cry with her.  As You Were, Buffy breaks up with Spike at the end of the episode. She calls him William. :(  Fool For Love, isn't that where we see the flashback of Drusilla breaking up with Spike? The Chaos Demon (all slime and antlers) is there too, just hanging out. One of the funnier breakups on the show.  When Xander sees Anya and Spike having sex at The Magic Box in Entropy, his confrontation at the end of that episode is really sad. I really wanted Xander and Anya to get back together. The actions in that episode pretty much sealed the breakup.  The kiss that Cordelia and Wesley share in Graduation Day always cracks me up. They immediately realize they have no chemistry whatsoever. I think that Wesley says he intends to return to England afterwards. Cordy's response is, ""That'd be neat."" And that's it. Not quite a breakup, but definitely an ending.  Ps - Into the Woods. Riley gets in the helicopter and flies away. :( I'm not even a big Riley fan, that episode still gets me.   (Edited for a typo)  I had to add these episodes, too!  Something Blue Triangle I Was Made to Love You Hell's Bells Lovers Walk  I'll try to stop with the edits now. Lol."

buffy,34ptu9,AngryWizard,14,Sun May 3 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"This is the first episode of the first season in which I feel like the show is leaning toward the quality of seasons 2-7, so I like this episode quite a bit.   The biggest negative that's coming immediately to mind is Xander's advice to Owen, something along the lines of 'she doesn't like to dance, doesn't like to be touched, don't even look at her'. I understand it was both meant to be humorous and a stalling tactic while Buffy talked to Giles in private, but Xander's actions throughout the rest of the series makes this type of behavior from him less humorous and innocent in retrospect.  The other thing that stands out to me is that in deciding her world is too dangerous for Owen, Buffy shows way more maturity than most 15 year olds would have. I mean c'mon, Owen was adorable."
buffy,34ptu9,BackOfTheHearse,10,Sun May 3 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"Which reminds me of this line from later in the series:   BUFFY: What I do with my life is none of your business.  XANDER: It used to be   No, Xander, you always attempted to make it your business."
buffy,34ptu9,Scendo,6,Sun May 3 18:05:39 2015 UTC,Xander shows his age here. He's a high school kid with a crush.
buffy,34ptu9,IraninaGenius,5,Sun May 3 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"I liked this episode better now than when I've seen it for the first time, but I still find it kind of weird of Cordelia suddenly throwing herself at Owen like that. She always seemed more interested in jocks than in tall, dark and broody.  I liked Buffy's short dresses, but that faux fur hoodie or the shirt with circles on her chest were weird, and so were Xander's green shirt with circles, Willow's striped bloused and Cordelia's frizzy hair.  I also expected for that pager to get used and I was surprised that it didn't."
buffy,34ptu9,ModerateBias,8,Sun May 3 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"She always seemed more interested in jocks than in tall, dark and broody.   uh...  she hits on angel.   she dates Xander.   She falls for connor.    I think broody is her type.   Heck wesley, her other crush isn't a jock either.   The jock thing is part of her ""popular girl"" face, and not her actual thing."

buffy,34ptu9,faaackksake,4,Mon May 4 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"One of the better eps of s1 imo, always used to think the owen guy was adorable"
buffy,34ptu9,buffanater,3,Mon May 4 10:47:16 2015 UTC,"weekly episode notes   1 did Owen remind anyone of Riley?  2 my silly * quest to find episodes that have a plot hole in the Giles/Ripper continuity continues! Why does Giles not think to bring a stake when he goes off on his own? He seems so helpless. 3 vamps are treated so much more seriously early on, by S9 [SPOILERS] anyone can dust a vamp. They seem less of a threat then the average criminal. You could explain it as ""the gang is better and more experienced, but that doesn't explain why suddenly anyone can dust vamps [END OF SPOILERS] 4 again, Owen is a lot like Riley. Even got the jealous of Angel thing.   Silly because the Ripper aspect of Giles wasn't written yet."
buffy,34ptu9,AngelAmongUs,3,Sun May 3 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think there is more ""Ripper"" there than you might think. :)  /u/GinaZaneburritos made some excellent points about his hidden nature that we see very early in the show.   Which brings me to Giles. :) His behavior here is much more complex and layered than the stuffy grown-up telling Buffy of her destiny and the latest crisis on the Hellmouth.  Although the episode begins by re-establishing Giles and Buffy's current relationship (he tries to forbid her from cheerleading; she protests and says she'll have time both for normalcy and slaying), by the end we have seen a different side of Giles. Seeing Buffy incapacitated with only a few hours to live, Giles suddenly becomes much more decisive, forceful, and dark. He pushes his way into Catherine/Amy's house and confronts her, saying ""You will shut up and you will listen to me.""  As Buffy becomes more and more ill, Giles gives several indications that he is much more familiar with spell-casting and black magic than he lets on. Despite not knowing anything about the body-swap before coming to the house, he takes one look at the dolls and cauldron in Catherine's house and knows instantly what's going on and that he can reverse the spells, but only with the ""certain volumes [that] she would need for this type of casting."" He recognizes that the cat is guarding something, and he finds her spell book easily.  When he goes to the school, he prepares for the spell like this:  He goes over to the glass cabinet with the chemicals in it. It's locked. Casually, still looking down at the book for reference, he picks up a metal beaker and smashes the glass. He looks in and starts picking out vials of useful substances.  To me, these scenes suggest that Giles has a restrained darkness, one that is able to surface when people he cares about are threatened. It hints at his dark past and also his reluctance to share it with anyone, given the way he only evidences any particular knowledge or skill when he feels it is necessary and, in fact, takes pains to leave the impression he is innocent in these matters (telling Buffy that it was his ""first casting"").  It would be interesting to compare and contrast the way Angel and Giles both mislead Buffy about their respective pasts and natures in these early episodes."
buffy,34ptu9,buffanater,5,Tue May 5 04:38:14 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome point of view. The more I think about it, Giles not bringing a stake could represent the fact that it's not only when others are around that he hides Ripper. He's hiding it from himself."
buffy,34ptu9,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue May 5 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome point of view.    :)  I think Giles not bringing a stake is more a sign that he's not that familiar with fighting vampires. Which, after all, was never one of the things that ""Ripper"" was known for. I don't think it's inconsistent that he's less comfortable with ""watcher"" things.  I'm also not sure (now that I think of it) that watchers are even encouraged to slay vampires on their own. He may have been following ""watcher policy"" that that was Buffy's job. Wesley in ""Dopplegangland"" is armed with holy water and a cross (but not a stake), after all."
buffy,34ptu9,magickmidget,3,Tue May 5 19:00:25 2015 UTC,1 did Owen remind anyone of Riley?   Let it never be said that Buffy didn't have a type. Usually.  Fortunately that's also my type. Or it shaped my type. Who knows at this point.

buffy,34mx72,matiasgee,3,Sat May 2 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't either.  If anything, I was reminded a little of Tara's spell in ""Family"":   Tara lifts her hand. There is a small pile of red dust in it. She incants in a barely audible whisper (The voices off screen fading out under it):  TARA: Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all, your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.  She blows the powder from her hand, causing a CGI mist to wend from it toward the group.  We widen to see it settle in the middle of them --  GILES: Now, I think I may have a lead on the monk Buffy spoke with. There are a few orders I've read up on...  -- and shoot into the eyes of everyone assembled. They all jerk back ever so slightly."

buffy,34mx72,swiftlikessharpthing,-9,Sat May 2 21:19:40 2015 UTC,An artist cannot plageurize themselves. I actually didn't catch that callback and wonder if it was intentional now...
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,7,Sat May 2 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"...you realize Scarlett Witch has had these powers before Buffy even existed, right?  wikipedia: ""The character first appeared in X-Men #4 (March 1964)"""
buffy,34mx72,swiftlikessharpthing,1 point,Sat May 2 20:10:52 2015 UTC,Of course I realize that. The homage I was referring to was an object being telekinetically ripped out in a Whedon work which is more than likely coincidental.
buffy,34mx72,lizzyloveslezzies,-9,Sun May 3 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"....you realize you're being an ass and arguing semantics, right? most people saw Buffy before seeing Age of Ultron. most people don't read the comic books. and most people don't feel the need to cite their comments.  arrogance isn't a good color on you."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,7,Sat May 2 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not being an ass at all. Just rather irksome that the poster above me considered it a ""callback"" and said Joss Whedon can't plagiarize himself.   Making a character do what she has always done is neither a callback to his previous work nor is it plagiarizing itself.  I cited the comment because I wanted to include how long the lore and history of the character is for people who DON'T KNOW. I only included it really as proof that Scarlet Witch has been around for a very long time, and that Joss Whedon is not in fact, calling back to his previous work. He is using an established character from various other creators, her powers were not his invention nor influenced by Buffy.   I would hardly classify this as ""semantics"" Also, providing a source to back up my claim is in no way arrogant. It is usually expected."
buffy,34mx72,matiasgee,8,Sat May 2 20:21:10 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you. Not a call back at all. Definitely not to Buffy and can't even see one to Willow (who would be a more appropriate character to relate).  Youre completely right with your lore aspect. For this movie I didnt feel that there were any shout outs to Buffy. And seeing characters do what they would have originally doesn't mean any Buffy influence exists.
buffy,34mx72,Sammyboy616,1 point,Sat May 2 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"The post isn't about her powers, it's about one very specific thing she does in the climax, which isn't something that she's done in the comics (as far as I know)."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,1 point,Mon May 4 14:34:06 2015 UTC,"I think I may be missing what specific power you are referring to?  I can't recall her doing anything she hasn't done before, I must have missed it."

The emotional dynamics of the scenes are quite different, and Age of Ultron spoilers But I do see a little more what everyone was talking about."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,2,Mon May 4 18:26:52 2015 UTC,ahhh okay.   But if she can move everything else it seems likely that she can rip things out of other things. I may be wrong in this case. but she usually can make things float/throw things with her mind.
buffy,34mx72,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Mon May 4 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"But if she can move everything else it seems likely that she can rip things out of other things. I may be wrong in this case. but she usually can make things float/throw things with her mind.   I would imagine. Willow was able to remove the bullet from Buffy's body telekinetically/through magic, for example. It seems like something the Scarlet Witch (like anyone with telekinetic powers) would be able to do.  Although to be honest, and I might be remembering this incorrectly, but I didn't think she used any sort of telekinesis at all to do this in the movie.  Buffy in ""Primeval"" does not."
buffy,34mx72,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Mon May 4 18:53:43 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I read that article and it also says that Scarlet Witches abilities are depicted as Spheres or Hex Bolts, in the movie that is not how they are represented.  Her powers seem to be general telekinesis and mind manipulation.  Being that Whedon has done multiple characters with slight telekinetic powers in Buffy, I don't think its a stretch to say that this new Cinematic rendition of Scarlet Witch could have been influenced by some of the other characters he's done in the past.  Thats not to say Scarlet Which isn't a character on her own, but why wouldn't Whedon put his own spin on the character for the movie he wrote?  Like you said, Scarlet Witch began in 1964, she's had a multitude of writers since then, each one put their own interpretation of her while also maintaining what other writers have done in the past."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,3,Sat May 2 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it seems a bit of a stretch to relate her to one episode where Buffy briefly had these powers. Also her powers in the movie are very similar to her powers in the Ultimate comics, and nearly identical to the X-Men Evolution cartoon.  The actors also said they based their performances of Wanda and Pietro off of the Ultimate comics.   I love Buffy don't get me wrong, I just feel she didn't seem like she was lifted or influenced by Joss' previous works or previous telekinetic people. Like another poster said, her powers are closer to Willow's than anything, and even that is a stretch.   It isn't overly important, I made these comments based solely on the fact that the original person I replied to didn't seem to realize Scarlet Witch existed before Age of Ultron, and that seemed odd to me as she is a popular Marvel character. But I guess I overlooked that people may not be as into Marvel as they are Buffy, and only watch MCU and don't know anything beyond the movies. Which is fine, I just find it odd."
buffy,34mx72,CJGibson,2,Sun May 3 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"The actors also said they based their performances of Wanda and Pietro off of the Ultimate comics.   Not that much off of them though, cause there wasn't a creepy incest vibe."
buffy,34mx72,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Sun May 3 00:41:36 2015 UTC,"Really? Because even though I already knew they were siblings, I still got the vibe that they were together.  It wasn't even made clear in the movie that they were siblings until Quicksilver said the line ""You know I was born 12 minutes before you"" indicating that they were twins.  I could totally see someone unfamiliar with the characters thinking they were a couple."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,3,Sun May 3 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Aside from being called ""the twins"" and their last names being mentioned, and I think Maria Hill may have mentioned they were siblings when explaining their backstory and who they were.   But the average movie goer or anyone unfamiliar with them could easily miss all the little details. They did act more like a couple, and the romantic context added makes spoiler"
buffy,34mx72,CJGibson,3,Sun May 3 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"Maria Hill may have mentioned they were siblings when explaining their backstory and who they were   At the very least she talks about ""their parents""  dying in the bombing which indicates that they are siblings."
buffy,34mx72,CJGibson,2,Sun May 3 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"They do call them ""The Twins"" in the first couple minutes of the movie, but I can see not taking it literally."
buffy,34mx72,Mquestionmark,2,Sun May 3 01:38:02 2015 UTC,"ehhh, whatever I read was from Elizabeth Olsen who said she deliberately stood too close to him in certain shots to sort of channel the incesty vibe.   I'm not one of those fangirls who insist on ships happening when they really aren't, but even without context you could probably make the assumption that they were banging each other or in love more than siblings would be, without knowing the history of them. Obviously the movie left that out, but the actors both knew that it was a thing that happened and tried their best to make at least a sly wink towards it."

buffy,34muyu,IraninaGenius,2,Sat May 2 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Kind of a low move for the entire production, to subvert the universe and the narrative for a petty and ignorant political cause... Beer isn't bad in and of itself, but the writing in that episode objectively is.  It could be argued that with Buffy going to college the issue of alcohol ought to be addressed, but the episode is a joke, and not in a funny ha ha kind of way.  In fact, the episode basically subverts the entire anti-drinking message by making the only bad beer the one that's been cursed by a warlock.  It really could have been handled in a much more mature way, but I think that no matter what it still would have turned out to have the stink of an after-school PSA.  Better handled was Willow's magic addiction as a thinly (if at all) veiled allegory for drug addiction."

This was like 1993 or something. anyway, i liked the film but it was super stupid and campy.  Flash forward to 2001 and i'm dating an amazing man who worships at the alter of Buffy the tv show. I made fun of him and everyone else i met for liking that show because of the movie. I was a total bitch.  Then, one day there was nothing else on tv, and said boyfriend asked if we could watch buffy. FINE..I guess. It was sometime when season five was new on tv. The opening sequence came on, then when the theme music started i had this look on my face like ""what the fuck am i watching? this is amazing"". Not even five minutes into it. Said boyfriend said something like ""I can make you a flow chart of everyone on the show and how they are connected."" No thanks, i'll figure it out.  I've been addicted to the show ever since. and every boyfriend since then, i have made them watch the show and it became their favorite too. My husband and I are considering getting matching tattoos of the Mark of Eygon(something you learn about later).  Best show ever."
buffy,34kitt,strawberryf1elds,8,Fri May 1 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"Knowing Joss, it was likely deliberate, but not sure of the exact reason. Ditto FirstBuffy in the S-7 credits."

I still think one of the meanest things Joss ever did (perhaps the meanest) is add Amber Benson to the opening credits getting fans all excited that she had become a regular, only to have her die in that episode. Why, Joss, WHYYY?"

buffy,34k1io,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sat May 2 18:58:19 2015 UTC,The issue with the last scene is it means Anya's been wandering around the university for hours since her fight with Xander was early in the day. Made it seem too contrived.

AND Joss had his hand on the tiller for marvel's visual media development, obliterating every previous attempt at a comic book movie that came before and setting the bar for the future.  the only thing i might lament is the wear and tear on Joss himself, he's clearly ready to move on. and he will. and we'll all benefit from his next moves, too."

Are we not experiencing pretty much a golden age of high-quality genre TV right at this very moment?  Networks outside the traditional broadcast ones finally pulled their heads out and realized there's enough of a market to support it.  Like AMC (The Walking Dead), HBO (Game of Thrones), Netflix (Daredevil).  Because it allows a lot more time for development, TV is the medium Joss shines in best.  Acknowledging that and wishing he was working with it instead of the two-hour blockbuster format with its severe limitations is neither unrealistic nor an attack on The Avengers."
buffy,34j5fm,bookant,3,Sat May 2 11:34:25 2015 UTC,"Like AMC (The Walking Dead), HBO (Game of Thrones), Netflix (Daredevil).   Eh. Those shows have bigger budgets and more freedom and they still don't really come close to reaching the heights that Buffy did. Joss has done the TV thing better than just about anyone else and he did it on Network television with more restrictions. Now the studios will write him a blank check to do whatever he wants. THAT is truly exciting."

buffy,34j5fm,jeff-the-slasher,1 point,Fri May 1 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Lucy was a movie whose reach so far exceeded its grasp that it ended up just being silly. It was definitely a more ambitious project than Age of Ultron, and in the hands of a better director and writer -- or perhaps just in the absence of big-budget market pressures -- it could've been interesting.  It was a perfect case study in why Hollywood has such a hard time doing ""real"" science fiction. High concept doesn't mesh well with obligate simplicity in execution. They always end up falling back on crap like the old ""ten percent of our brains"" canard."
buffy,34j5fm,stillnotking,5,Fri May 1 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"These are two completely different mediums and two completely different audiences (with some overlap, obviously), and comparing them is a bit unfair in my opinion, because they are two totally separate things. You don't go to your favorite waffle restaurant, order a steak, and then bitch about how the steak doesn't taste like waffles.  It's totally cool to not like one or the other, but don't treat it like Whedon is doing a disservice to his fans by making a blockbuster movie instead of a TV show. Also, [spoilers] I think Whedon gave us some excellent strong women in this one. Black Widow is great, we get to see some of her back story, and her romance with Banner is a very small part of her character. Then we have the Scarlet Witch, who is a total badass, and they don't force her into a relationship! Even though they introduced The Vision in this movie, and Vision and Scarlet Witch are married in the Marvel verse. She got to be badass on her own. I think Joss did a great job."

For the same matter, why didn't any of the bad guys use modern weapons? Look at the damage one yutz did with some sporadic fire from a small hand gun (Warren). Imagine what 10 vamps with AR-15's and some basic weapons training could have done.  In the end, it all probably comes down to how to looked on screen and the tone of the show. The Scoobies weilding brightly colored plastic toys might have been seen as not matching these, just like automatic weapons would not have."

I think some of the competitors in the ""SlayerFest"" used guns too right?   Ultimately I think you're right though-- too many modern weapons wouldn't have fit well with the tone of the show.

buffy,34hmj6,AuthorTomFrost,4,Fri May 1 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is obviously could be a much larger discussion about the lack of religion in the show while still using religious symbols, mythology, heaven/hell, etc...  But my head-canon version to get around this was that the use of crosses against vampires predated Christianity was adopted by the religion. You can even say that Romans killing people on the cross protected them from being attacked by vampires and thus had more painful deaths."

buffy,34i59h,mellifluous500,4,Fri May 1 10:38:00 2015 UTC,I think it would've completely ruined what they did do.  I watched both of these when they originally aired.  The Gift - Holy Shit Buffy's Dead!  (Much bigger deal in first-run because at the point when it aired the show had been cancelled and we tuned in to watch the series finale that night.)  Then we get Angel - This show is smack in the middle of a silly comic relief type story arc.  I get immersed in it.  Everything funny.  Buffy's death is pretty much out of my mind at this point and then  . . .  WHAM!  I get hit over the head with it a second time.
buffy,34i59h,bookant,2,Fri May 1 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"I think that /u/bookant is right in that they probably avoided the crossover because those arcs were so tonally different. I'm not saying they couldn't have made it work (because they could have, of course, and it might've been a cool moment for people who watched both shows), but that arc of ""Buffy"" was dark and dramatic and the corresponding arc on ""Angel"" was largely goofy and comical. The writers probably wanted to keep them pretty separate."

We're not hostile towards new viewers and noobie questions, we embrace them and try to accommodate for everyone. We don't shun opinions that are not our own. As long as a comment is articulate and they explain their point well and politely, people on here will respect you and embrace the different of opinion (it is slightly ironic though that someone posted a comment that has nothing to do with OP's post and got downvoted though).   And I do honestly think that it's largely in part to Joss and how he showed us so many different things. I find that fans of Buffy are generally way more accepting of different cultures/religions/sexuality and so on they other TV shows, and I think that's reflected in our community.   But as a mod, and I say this A LOT as well, it's you guys. You guys make the community. We try and enhance the sub the best way we can by listening to all the different ideas people want to see. I really see it as us giving the sub a paint brush and some paint, and the community making brilliant/amazing pieces of art (ha, that was cheesy but screw it :] )"
buffy,34fsf1,coolbeaNs92,5,Fri May 1 11:54:03 2015 UTC,"As long as a comment is articulate and they explain their point well and politely, people on here will respect you and embrace the different of opinion   Sadly I have to disagree. I'm apparently one of the few people in existence who dislike Spike, Glory, Once More With Feeling and basically all of season 5. I'm not militant about it and don't go around telling people who do like those things that they're wrong. But every time I express those opinions, be it in a discussion post or hell, even an upopular opinions thread! I get downvoted straight away. I noticed expressing a dislike for Spike gets the most downvotes and also the quickest. Doesn't matter how well I articulate my opinion, writing ""I do not like Spike"" gets me downvotes every single time. I get it, Spike is a popular character, probably even the most popular one in all of Buffy. But I actually considered making a post asking people not to downvote others solely because they dislike Spike, because it just happens so often I don't feel like discussing favorites anymore."
buffy,34fsf1,Beloit,2,Fri May 1 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I mean... I won't deny it sometimes happens, but I don't see it often happening to be honest. I did have a quick look through your ""controversial"" comments for Buffy, and I can't see anything for either /r/buffy or /r/angel in the 5 mins I was looking (I'm not saying it didn't happen though)."
buffy,34fsf1,coolbeaNs92,3,Fri May 1 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, believe me, it happens. When I posted in an unpopular opinions thread that I dislike Spike the comment got at -2. In a thread about rating the seasons I put season 5 as my least favorite and got at -1. In a season 10 discussion thread I said I was happy with the Spike/Buffy friendship but did not like it getting romantic again, that got below 0 pretty quickly as well. I haven't checked what happened with those comment ratings since so I guess it's possible they're back in the plus again but still. I know it's not like they get to -8 or something, but it's just disparaging to see people downvote stuff just because you dislike something they like. I think I write pretty coherent comments but nowadays I just don't post anything Spike/Glory/season 5 related on /r/Buffy anymore, and just skip those discussions when I see them appear on here."

Apparently I wasn't the only one getting downvoted there.  Ranking the season from your most fave to least fave, currently at 0. Again, not the only one to get downvotes. Strangely my comment clarifying why I dislike season 5 is at +8. Comment I posted saying content from the comics has to be spoiler tagged which got to -6. It went back up to the positive numbers after I added that spoiler tagging the comics is a rule in the FAQ.   I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones I remember right now."

What I found interesting about the 'Rankings' thread, is that you were downvoted once, but they in your justification, it got much praise. Now, I still don't understand why one person downvoted it, but clearly from the follow up comment, people appreciated your view.   But I'm not at all saying it doesn't happen, it does. We can't really control it and it happens across the whole of reddit. All I can think of to do, is really remind the sub (we have done before) about proper reddequite again.   Thanks for brining that to my attention though. I have been rarely noticing it for the past couple years, and I generally look at every single self.text post, but it's good to get feedback and re-jig some awareness."

All I can think of to do, is really remind the sub (we have done before) about proper reddequite again.   I think that would be a good idea, it's what I was thinking of doing myself. I get caring about imaginary internet points is kinda dumb but it's not very fun to write a well-thought out comment and then get downvoted just because someone disagrees.   Also, about everyone saying everyone is so nice here: the only time I ever got called a slur on Reddit was right here on /r/Buffy: ""Buffy fans are the biggest fags.""

We have done a reddequite reminder before, a long, long time ago. Unfortunately, this is a problem across the whole of Reddit and we have no real control over it (which is a good and a bad thing).   What we also really need to see, is people coming to us and reporting bad behaviour as well. It can be hard to get everything working/added in the back-ground and check every single comment on every point. I would be lying if I said I do because I simply don't have the time to.   But yes, I am going to bring this up between us mods and try to come up with a plan of action on how we can improve. Obviously, you're going to get malicious comments/trolls wherever you go, it's an open forum, but if we can improve, we will.   I'm honestly very upset that you feel you can't share your thoughts and opinions with /r/buffy completely. But please, report this behaviour to us to ensure it doesn't go un-missed."
buffy,34fsf1,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Sun May 3 13:43:46 2015 UTC,"Although I have seen less of that here than on many other subreddits (and I try to upvote when I see it happening), I think downvoting unpopular views in a sitewide reddit issue that comes back to the unfortunate reality that people just don't seem to understand the reddiquette. I think a lot of people interpret upvote as ""agree"" and downvote as ""disagree,"" when downvotes are actually only meant to identify comments that are irrelevant or unnecessarily hostile.   I actually got into an argument with somebody about that on another sub a while back. The person was arguing that because people use it that way, we should all just move to a system where that's the accepted norm; this frustrated me because that person using something incorrectly means he should learn how to do it right and follow the rules, not that everyone else should stop using the feature correctly because he has failed to do so."

But the comments in this thread praising the users of /r/Buffy as wonderful, nice, supporting, understanding and accepting of others' opinions is just very naive. For one thing /r/Buffy is the only subreddit on which I got called a faggot for making a joke. And that wasn't a troll, that was a fellow fan."

I seriously loved it so much, and Tatiana is so fantastic I had to forcefully remind myself not well guarded spoiler but just to be safe: I honestly kept forgetting, then suddenly 'Oh holy shit!'. I think it's a show that many Buffy fans would enjoy (judging by season 1 at least). I'm really looking forward to watching more."
buffy,3493r9,AngryWizard,9,Wed Apr 29 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen it and I love it! All of Tatiana's clones are incredible female characters, Felix is a God, and it's generally very fun. Tat is a wonder to watch, it's become a cliche, but you have four clones on screen and you forget it's the same actress! The main characters of the show remind me of Buffy in a way.   Imagine a Scooby gang full of Tatianas! Buffy-Sarah, Giles-Alison, Willow-Cosima, Felix-Xander, and Faith-Helena."

buffy,3493r9,ajkkjjk52,2,Wed Apr 29 17:39:35 2015 UTC,Pretty much exactly what I have to say so I will just agree here. And add that the feminism is so much more nuanced and inclusive than Buffy managed in its time.

buffy,3493r9,fmccool01,3,Fri May 1 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"I just watched the latest episode and  it is probably my favourite show on television right now. The acting, the plot, the writing. Everything is about this show is amazing. Just one question: Why has Tatiana not been nominated for more awards? No other actor on television can do what she has to do every episode."
buffy,3493r9,AngryWizard,2,Wed Apr 29 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"Don't even follow awards shows but I was adamant after watching season 1 that she deserved every best female actress/supporting actress award available.

buffy,3493r9,happycowsmmmcheese,2,Wed Apr 29 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen the first half of the first season, and it was alright.  I wasn't super impressed with the writing, but I've heard a LOT of good things recently so I think I should give it another go.  I may have judged to quickly.  Can I also recommend The Strain!?  That's the show that has reminded me of Buffy the most lately.  There are plenty of laughable lines/moments (though maybe not the same level of wit Whedon offers), and lots of great actors and exciting action.  Seriously, it's great.  I think season 2 might be starting soon."
buffy,3493r9,wphayduke,2,Wed Apr 29 18:42:07 2015 UTC,I'll check out The Strain. Thanks. I wasn't too impressed with Orphan Black until the middle of season one. It just kept getting better and better and season 2 is amazing.
buffy,3493r9,bwburke94,2,Fri May 1 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely favorite drama right now. Maslany is the best actor working, period (it's more pure sci-fi than Buffy which, of course, was fantasy - two very different genres often lumped together). I only watch two shows regularly, 'Orphan Black' and 'Louie' (In high-school 'Orphan Black' should be required science-class viewing and Louie should be required English-class viewing). Both are that good."
buffy,3493r9,N4U534,2,Thu Apr 30 03:53:29 2015 UTC,Yes. Though I'm an episode behind.

buffy,346bjh,AngryWizard,23,Tue Apr 28 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really shock to be honest, since I'd imagine 80% of the audience have no idea who wrote the films or directed them. The big names for casual fans are really JDW and so on, the actual actors. The people who have followed Joss for almost 20 years like the majority of us on here, are obviously always going to known him as the mastermind because Buffy, Firefly and even Dollhouse/Cabin in the Woods."
buffy,346bjh,coolbeaNs92,20,Tue Apr 28 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"Interview with Joss that includes some Buffy fan ego stroking for us to be mildly smug about. He hasn't forgotten us, guys!!      Which of your projects get the most fan attention?  Firefly, probably. Buffy would be a close second.  What’s the weirdest Buffy reaction you’ve had?  Buffy fans are a very intelligent, passionate and literate lot. It was very weird for me. I thought, 'We're going to make this show good but we won't tell anyone about the metaphor' and right away, everybody got it.   Edit: Also, I have to say that I completely agree with him about cringe humor (""I will hide my eyes like I’m watching a horror.""). It makes me terribly uncomfortable as well; I'm not sure about the Bridesmaids scene he's referencing, but watching The Office UK was a struggle for me in that department."
buffy,346bjh,coolbeaNs92,15,Tue Apr 28 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'm English, and honestly, The UK version of the office is the most depressing, cringe-worthy show I have ever watched. It honestly has very little enjoyment for me and mostly it just makes me depressed. That early 2000's, office-style job on the outskirts of London just makes me want to stake myself.   The US version on the other hand, I adore."
buffy,346bjh,coolbeaNs92,3,Tue Apr 28 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah that never would have sold well to the masses here in the US (was the Office UK massively popular there like Office US was here?). They made Michael Scott bumbling and cringy, but gave him heart. They made him sympathetic, made us root for him to be better or to get it right. David Brent was just an awful human! And yeah, the job itself was pretty bleak."
buffy,346bjh,Sparky678348,2,Tue Apr 28 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"Erm... The Office was popular here, but I wouldn't say it was anything like Sherlock or Dr Who. I think they peaked at about 3 million. Maybe it's because it's too close to home for me. I live nearish Staines and it's a grim place. And that whole early 2000's office job were kind of the nightmares of my childhood (I was a strage kid :x).   But yeah, I love the US Office. :)"

All of his original stuff has been great, other than Cabin in the Woods, which I thought a bit too preachy.  I get that he's a huge comic book fan or whatever, but all of his work in that medium amounts to fan fiction. It's as if Shakespeare had started writing sequels to Doctor Faustus."

Fun to watch, not possible to get cereberally or emotionally involved with characters and/or relationships. In other words, it lacks emotion. Which IMO was the strongest characteristic of shows like Buffy and Firefly."
buffy,348eyj,hashk,25,Wed Apr 29 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"In a word: No. Not in a way that would be readily recognizable.  The best tattoos are either close to monochrome or somewhat cartoonish in their appearance.  I took the image you posted and desaturated it and played around with various levels of contrast and it just doesn't translate well.  If you are set on ""Buffy jumping into the portal"" as a tattoo, you should have an artist re-interpret it first.  As for the POV, I'd suggest a straight on side view - but unless this is going to be a large back piece by a very talented artist, it's still not going to be apparent that the subject in question is Buffy Summers.  And you really don't want to end up with something like this  http://i.imgur.com/CTkcj2B.jpg  This is a little better (as far as having someone elses face drawn on your skin)  http://i.imgur.com/CaR6XM8.jpg"
buffy,348eyj,nutbastard,2,Wed Apr 29 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"I was going to have it a piece on my side, but not taking up my entire side. Which part would be unrecognizable? Would you still be able to see the jump into the portal? As for POV, would it make it better if I had a view where Buffy is above the portal mid jump?"
buffy,348eyj,nutbastard,7,Wed Apr 29 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Mid jump absolutely, just do it from the side so you can get the hair flying up and a profile of her face in the mix. From the top it's just going to look like a random person belly flopping into a pond or something.  But at that size, there are restrictions on fidelity. Sub-millimeter thick tattoo lines are very difficult and prone to the ink falling out."
buffy,348eyj,nutbastard,2,Wed Apr 29 05:07:31 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/SRq9Cmg More like a POV similar to this (but not cartoony, and no Dawn)?"
buffy,348eyj,lecherous_hump,7,Wed Apr 29 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely better, but I still don't see this translating well to ink. At modest size you sort of have to go cartoon. There's just not the resolution to capture SMG in less that 3in2  In any case, yes, clearly no Dawn."

buffy,348eyj,Markatansky,2,Wed Apr 29 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"OP here: I've been wanting to get a Buffy tattoo, and I did originally want the quote from this scene. But, I realized that the actual picture of the scene means the most to me. I definitely want it of her jumping, but still deciding on which POV to get the tattoo in. I will work with my artist to see what looks best. What do you guys think?"
buffy,348eyj,l0stcontinent,2,Wed Apr 29 03:01:15 2015 UTC,You might be able to do something cool with the portal in a sort of water cool tattoo style. If you've seen those and like them. That way it doesn't become this heavy tattoo if that makes sense.  But of the tattoos I've seen recently they are pretty much tattoo anything if you find the right artist so I'm sure it will be awesome when you get it!
buffy,348eyj,l0stcontinent,2,Wed Apr 29 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"Taken straight from that image it would probably end up looking like some mad mash-up of David Bowie, Jesus and Ghostbusters. An artist's line interpretation would be better, personally."
buffy,348eyj,CopyRogueLeader,2,Wed Apr 29 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Anything can be executed well! The real question is, do you have access to an artist who can translate your idea into a successful piece of art? Research local artists' portfolios, which can be found at shops and usually on their website/fb/insta as well. If you find an artist whose style is up your alley then definitely reach out and have this conversation with them. I can brainstorm a couple of ideas as to how you could portray this scene as a tattoo, so I can only imagine the amount of great results that are possible from a creative and educated/experienced artist! A good artist loves a client who turns to them with a unique idea. Best of luck!"

buffy,348eyj,AngryWizard,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"I'd start by finding a certain stylistic approach and going from there. I just checked out Outer Limit's website and it looks like they're a great resource for this. For example, take a look at Ivana who is very abstract and creative while Zac's work is more traditional. And then from there, they'll be more educated than I by a long shot with input and interpretation than I. Something you may run into there to keep in mind is their schedule and availability, since they're sort of a big deal."

Not only did Dr. Joss And His ""Bunche"" know they'd be renewed, they also didn't know what kind of fandom they'd attract, so I can't see any reason why anything in s-1 should make much sense, 7-seasons arc wise"
buffy,343ubh,bwburke94,2,Wed Apr 29 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"From IMDB:   Buffy's birthday was celebrated in the episode first aired on or near 19 January each year. In the first-year episode ""I Robot, You Jane"", Malcolm brings up Buffy's school records on his computer. In the first view, we see that Buffy was born on 24 October 1980, and that she is a sophomore. The second time we see Buffy's records, her birthday is 6 May 1979, and she is a senior. Joss Whedon finally decreed Buffy's birthday to be 19 January 1981.   Joss' decision actually lines up with when the episode aired in seasons 2/3. Her birthday was generally around mid-season.   Surprise (S2E13): 19 January 1998  Helpless (S3E12): 19 January 1999  A New Man (S4E12): 25 January 2000  Blood Ties (S5E13): 6 February 2001  Older and Far Away (S6E14): 12 February 2002   Season one started in March 1997 and season seven was a little busy for birthdays, though it could also be because Spike suggested she stopped celebrating her birthday in season six. ;)"

The Hunga Munga was one of the weapons employed by the Family Home enslavers along with large clubs. During the Slayer Buffy Summers' rebellion against Ken, who lured homeless teenagers in his dimension and enslaved them, she used one of these weapons against the enslavers, providing a distraction so Lily Houston could gather and escort the slaves out.

Depression is an issue that is very dear to my heart, as I battled with it extremely badly for four and a half years.   Damn, so true to my own heart as well.

Wesley, mainly because of Angel and his masterpiece of a character arc,  and Drusilla because she was just plain nuts, with a tragic back story, and I feel that she was unfairly overshadowed by a Spike a few times. We should have seen a lot more of her than we eventually did.   As for Wesley, he's in my Top 5 Buffyverse characters, and rightfully so. The transformation from a bumbling idiot in Buffy season 3 to a legendary badass in Angel seasons 3 to 5 is beautiful to watch."

buffy,33x6vo,sgamer83,6,Sun Apr 26 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"Kristin, I’m glad you asked for my thoughts on the announcement of Buffy the cinema film. This is a sad, sad reflection on our times, when people must feed off the carcasses of beloved stories from their youths—just because they can’t think of an original idea of their own, like I did with my Avengers idea that I made up myself.  Obviously I have strong, mixed emotions about something like this. My first reaction upon hearing who was writing it was, “Whit Stillman AND Wes Anderson? This is gonna be the most sardonically adorable movie EVER.” Apparently I was misinformed. Then I thought, “I’ll make a mint! This is worth more than all my Toy Story residuals combined!” Apparently I am seldom informed of anything. And possibly a little slow. But seriously, are vampires even popular any more?  I always hoped that Buffy would live on even after my death. But, you know, AFTER. I don’t love the idea of my creation in other hands, but I’m also well aware that many more hands than mine went into making that show what it was. And there is no legal grounds for doing anything other than sighing audibly. I can’t wish people who are passionate about my little myth ill. I can, however, take this time to announce that I’m making a Batman movie. Because there’s a franchise that truly needs updating. So look for The Dark Knight Rises Way Earlier Than That Other One And Also More Cheaply And In Toronto, rebooting into a theater near you.  Leave me to my pain! Sincerely, Joss Whedon."

buffy,33x6vo,TheDemonHauntedWorld,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"He's one of a handful of directors who could get a big budget and tell a unique story. That would be great, for sure. I just think television has grown up a lot even since Dollhouse, the choice between film and television now (for someone in a position to make the choice) depends on whether you want to tell a longer story with more world-building.   Here he is recently:  ""I mean, there’s no medium I don’t love. And there’s nothing I don’t wanna try; my favorite thing is to do something that I’m not good enough to do yet. Somebody once, on the Internet, a long time ago, they said, “Joss Whedon has a habit of boxing above his weight class.” And I was like, ‘I think you think that’s an insult, but that’s the best thing I’ve ever heard.’ That’s what I wanna do. Stuff I’m not good enough to do yet and see if I’m good enough to pull it off."""
buffy,33x6vo,Frank_the_Bunneh,2,Tue Apr 28 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"NO GOD... NO GOD PLEASE NO... NO... NO... NOOOOOOOOO  Please leave Buffy alone. Seriously. Buffy is doing great continuing the story on comics, and a new movie/series would only destroy the character, the story, and ultimately the comics.  A movie would not tell S8 story, so the comics would be non canon. The movie would be awful because I don't think they can get the whole cast after +12 years. And the movie studio would want new actors. So they would probably recast everyone or just reboot the whole thing, and even if Joss is on the director seat, I don't think it would be as good as the tv show. And it would only serve to taint the image people have for this magnificent universe that Joss created.  And to get matters worse, because I think this is gonna be a disaster in both ends. (First for being a awful movie, and second for ignoring the comics). Sales of Buffy/Angel in comic would drop making Dark Horse cancel the comics. Leaving us with a bad movie and nothing else.  Please... I don't wanna a movie. I REALLY... REALLY don't wanna a movie."

It has very little in common with the tv show buffy. Some issues were good, The Chain in particular was brilliant.  Can anyone summarise s8 in a few sentences. Buffy and angel made a universe by going at it...seriously? Twilight was piss poorly executed."
buffy,33x49v,Buffy_Bot,12,Sun Apr 26 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"I love Xander's fantasy at the beginning, being the studly hero while Buffy looks up at him longingly.  (Only to be woken up drooling on his desk.)    People are very quick to dismiss most of Season 1, especially the weakest episodes (Teacher's Pet, Never Kill a Boy, I Robot You Jane) -- but they're focusing on story, while missing all the wonderful moments as we get to know the characters.  I fell in love with this show right from the beginning in March 1997, because of these characters: the charm of the actors, the writing of their dialogue, and Joss Whedon's crafting of his unique little universe.  Whenever I re-watch, every episode in S1 has numerous scenes that bring me a huge smile."
buffy,33x49v,monsieurartois,3,Sun Apr 26 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"I think ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" is one of the strongest episodes, actually.  I can't wait till we get to it. :)"

buffy,33x49v,The_Ripper42,5,Sun Apr 26 14:25:07 2015 UTC,Correctamundo!  Finally someone else to put on the trivia board aside from /u/AngelAmongUs although I'm sure they knew the answer :)
buffy,33x49v,GinaZaneburritos,9,Sun Apr 26 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"Interview with Musetta Vander (Natalie French)  From David Greenwalt (credited author for this episode):    But what I love about what Joss has done with the show is that you take something that is very real in high school, like sexual tension, and then you fulfill that by having a guy trapped with a giant bug in a basement who’s going to eat him. So, I like that he takes very real issues and then magnifies them, and it’s fun doing that. What would scare me is not to go there.   From ""Joss Whedon Answers 100 Questions,"" SFX Magazine, 2002:   Question 66: What scares you?  JW: People. And large insects.   I'd forgotten how many of these s1 episodes centered around Xander. Buffy has some development in this episode, and she is clearly the one in charge, but the central conflict and story I think is still Xander's.   This is one of the only episodes where we actually get into the head of someone other than Buffy; the episode begins with Xander's fantasy/dream. After his fantasy turns into something literally horrible, he does what he can to keep cool and fight back, apologizes: ""Just for the record, you were right, I was an idiot, and God bless you ... And thank you guys too,"" and destroys the egg sacs in a moment that reminds me of Buffy smashing the Master's bones in ""When She Was Bad.""   His going to Miss French's house and drinking the martini also reminds me of Buffy drinking at the frat party in ""Reptile Boy,"" a little.  Angel's behavior in this episode strikes me as a little shady: he gives Buffy his coat, conveniently revealing a wound to her. The warning about the ""fork guy"" seems a little contrived too - is the guy really ""coming""? He describes the fork guy later as just a vampire making a ""nuisance of himself"":   ANGEL: I heard a rumor there was one less vampire walking around making a nuisance of himself.  BUFFY: There is. Thanks for the tip.  ANGEL: Pleasure's mine.  BUFFY: Of course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.  ANGEL: I'll be around.  BUFFY: Or who you where . . .  He just smiles at that one.  BUFFY: Well, anyway, you can have your jacket back.  ANGEL: Looks better on you.  He absently runs his hand along the collar for a moment. Things get a teeny bit steamy in there, but neither of them makes a move.  He goes.  She watches him a moment.  BUFFY: Oh, boy . . .   Angel also looks back to make sure she's watching him leave.   It's an interesting choice; Buffy's ""oh boy,"" is, as the Critically Touched review says, ""a wonderful moment of self-reflection [...] as if [she] is self-acknowledging that getting involved with Angel will be problematic, but she can't stop herself from getting swept up by her emotions anyway."" To have him behave this way in an episode about a older woman (who is also a demon) who preys on virgins evokes an interesting parallel.  Edit: /u/Shangel's review of this episode"
buffy,33x49v,The_Ripper42,2,Sun Apr 26 16:20:14 2015 UTC,I never noticed that parallel before. It makes you wonder what exactly they were trying to say about the dynamic between older people getting involved with teenagers and vice versa.
buffy,33x49v,wakame,11,Mon Apr 27 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"So does this mean that the science teacher was a virgin? Or did she just kill him to get the teaching position? I think the first option is much funnier, so it is what I will choose to believe."

buffy,33x49v,The_Ripper42,3,Mon Apr 27 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:  Many unneeded plot points in this episode i.e. fork guy, Angel showing up, and that crazy guy Giles calls, the M. Night Shamalamadindong twist ending  Angel should've been able to take one Vampire, fork or not  Sorry Xander, but there's no way it would be a shock that he's a virgin  Willow seems a little over eager to help Xander's reputation ;)  The scoobies are so innocent right now with the amount of shock and grief that comes with this one death  How does one go about making a mantis demon hybrid? It's not like they can just mix blood like with vamps  Why didn't Buffy just tell Xander that Ms. French probably killed the science teacher instead of being vague  A lot of cutting back in this episode, first to Xander's dream then to Ms. French talking about mantises  I love that Giles has a recording of himself  Buffy's relationship with the dead science teacher was a really nice part of the episode  Edit: Also how did Buffy go underground and find the exact vampire she was looking for?"
buffy,33x49v,ASK_IF_IM_PENGUIN,3,Mon Apr 27 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm watching Buffy for the first time.  Although it's still a little clunky this is the first episode which felt cohesive (if that makes sense). The direction was better than the previous three, the interaction between the cast was much better. It's still a little slow by modern standards but it's certainly finding its feet."
buffy,33x49v,Enzown,2,Tue Apr 28 18:02:53 2015 UTC,So I guess the eggs that were left behind in the high school never hatched?
buffy,33x49v,porcupines4eva,2,Mon Apr 27 03:00:41 2015 UTC,Maybe they hatched last season when everything was happening again in the high school...

A giant praying mantis, just doesn't work in this episode. They could have simply focused on the vampire instead. The whole blade fingers idea is a cool concept that I wish was explored instead of the actual monster of the week.  Also, this is the first Xander episode and they only get better from here. (The Zeppo- one of the best episodes of season 3 if not the whole show.) Both him and Willow get poor first outings (Willow- I Robot You Jane but let us pretend this episode isn't canon. ) Overall, one of the poorer season 1 episodes."
buffy,33x49v,The_Ripper42,2,Mon Apr 27 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"There's definitely something lacking with the mantis demon but the way they played it, the vampire hardly seemed like a threat. It would also have to have much more of a personality to be the main threat."
buffy,33v8q6,Oddric,14,Sat Apr 25 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yup.   And he is right... ""something isn't right there"".   After all, the demon can only be summoned with a specific amulet, and as far as he knew, that amulet was safe and sound somewhere in the shop.  We know dawn had found it...  but presumably because xander didn't put it away properly.

People always talk about Willow and Anya's reactions, which are perfect, but people don't talk enough about Spike's.   It was so touching how he brought flowers because he really liked Joyce and enjoyed spending time with her.   Drinking a cuppa and watching Passions.     I liked that Joyce had a great date the night before and that he sent flowers.   Her last day was a good one.   That's nice."
buffy,33se0v,SoMuchMoreEagle,38,Sat Apr 25 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"This is another reason for why I love Spike more than Angel. Angel wanted to kill Buffy's mom when he didn't have a soul, Spike never even touched her. He liked her, soulless and all. Spike had a cold, but kind heart, even without a soul.. He liked Joyce so much cause she was of the same kind, very nice and sweet and oh so welcoming for Spike and all the other people Buffy brought home. Makes me sad bro."

Yet Spike hangs out with her at least 3 times I can think of and they always chat and she seems to like him despite his appearance. (and later on despite him being a vampire)  Also we never got to see Angel and Dawn's relationship in their false memories. But Spike and Dawn we got to see interact all the time and she really liked him as well. And he liked her.   SPIKE JUST GETS ON WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY, IS WHAT I AM SAYING. Soul or no soul.

Most shows that contain character deaths focus on the death and not the shock and grief that follows. Grief comes in waves and layers and realizations and I've yet to see any show really capture this process as adequately as Joss did in The Body. I lost my mom suddenly last year and can't count the number of times I thought about Anya's speech on Joyce never drinking orange juice again when a similar thought would hit me, like if a movie with an actor my mom liked was coming out and I realized afresh I couldn't tell her about it. This episode was brilliant, heart wrenching and cathartic in many ways."

At the time I saw it I had never experienced the death of a close friend or relative first hand, but I remembered thinking how raw and real the whole thing felt and couldn't help but wonder how close to home it hit for some people.  Well...while the circumstances of my fathers death are fairly different from this episode I can NOW tell you firsthand that this episode pretty much nails the entire emotional experience. The thing I'd never really understood at the time that the episode also captures is that feeling of having no clue at what your supposed to do, or how you're supposed to feel, and how it gradually leads to getting pissed off and punching a wall when you realize that sometimes things just happen and that the whole world is gonna keep on spinning in ignorance despite the fact that everything has changed."

So many hints beforehand, so much misdirection and then Grey's Anatomy spoiler? Come on!  Kristine Sutherland has said that Joss told her she needed to come back for season five because he planned to kill her. The shock and emotional turmoil... I can't even think about it.

Now Firefly is another story and I've seen a fair bit of criticism of the lack of Asian characters in that cast and how that doesn't really make sense.   I've actually never been to southern California though so I'm not sure what it would have looked like demographically in the late 90's. I remember San Francisco at that same time when I was there being pretty diverse with a much larger Asian population than I'm used to here in the southeast US, but I can't use that as a template for socal.  When you say 'how it would have played out' are you referring to how Cordy was the vapid, mean girl in the first couple seasons?"

I heard plenty of criticism regarding ethnicity and Sunnydale. (which, apparently, is most like Santa Barbara, at least in intent) And yes, showing a ""minority"" character as negatively as Cordy was at first and in the Jasmine arc, I can see how it might have come in for even greater criticism rather than positive response.  Can't help but wonder, if Bianca had played Cordy, and if Charisma had stayed with acting (instead of finishing her bachelor's and becoming an English teacher, one of her Plans B) if in ""What's My Line"" she had shown up as Elisa the Vampire Slayer complete with accent."

If it looks like a crossover I'll make sure I'm caught up on both, but I'll usually watch a few episodes at a time of one or the other for continuity. For example, I'm on episode 18 of Angel but finished season 6 of Buffy. They never had a true crossover this year (unless I'm forgetting something that didn't happen) so no worries about missing anything."

Yesterday Marti Noxon retweeted the video and early this week, Anthony Stewart Head did.  A couple weeks ago Nerf Herder and Mark Metcalf (the Master) did as well.  Maybe they're getting some traction?"

buffy,33q89j,Skeezypal,4,Fri Apr 24 18:29:13 2015 UTC,I don't think so though because the Fox HD remaster has nothing to do with Blu-Ray. It's being shown on tv.
buffy,33q89j,lavelle1982,4,Fri Apr 24 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"You don't know that though. If there was a bluray release being worked on, it's likely that it would be the same rather than simultaneously creating two separate remasters."
buffy,33q89j,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:38:45 2015 UTC,"We do though. The remasters were made to be shown on tv last year for a specific channel. Blu-ray is not the same thing as HD, they would still require other work to be done before going on a disc, and I don't believe the people who own the rights to the show would immortalize it and sell it in the current HD state it's in. Airing on tv on one channel is not the same as a home video release and they require different preparations, different rights to be purchased, etc."

buffy,33q89j,noonotthat,3,Fri Apr 24 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think when Joss said Blu-ray release here he was referring to the Fox HD remaster, basically he misspoke. So he's not referring to working on a new Blu-ray release, he's referring to looking into the HD remaster issue."
buffy,33q89j,SPacific,1 point,Sat Apr 25 10:59:52 2015 UTC,Aye!  It never crossed my mind that he might have been referring to something else.  Now it's generating hype and anticipation over an impeding blu-ray when it is far too early to start digging into our pockets.
buffy,33q89j,sork,2,Sat Apr 25 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"The only thing Buffy on blu ray would achieve is the use of a newer video codec than dvd. Which would give you nicer colors and less artifacting. But the show was not shot in hd, period. It would be nice as a space saver on your shelf if you have all the big digibook dvd releases (I do.) The only show that really needs a blu ray release is Angel season 5 (which was 1080i.) Everything else on blu ray would see nominal improvements, but nothing breathtaking. So if they remastered the original 480i 4:3 videos, keeping the original aspect ratios (not cropping to 16:9) and got them on to as few blu rays as possible to save space. I would be for that, but these bullshit ""hd remasters"" are garbage and straight up lies. Up scaling doesn't make something ""HD"" it's just a standard def image up scaled."
buffy,33q89j,rywon,6,Sat Apr 25 01:41:18 2015 UTC,Buffy was shot on film. It would make a difference.
buffy,33q89j,DaddyCatALSO,6,Sat Apr 25 04:18:05 2015 UTC,Blu Ray allows for much higher bit rate. There's more to video than just resolution.
buffy,33q89j,batRam,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:10:57 2015 UTC,Anything shot on film can be converted to HD. Film is not limited in resolution. 16mm or 35mm - all capable of being converted to HD.  At the time of Buffy's release we didn't have televisions to watch the show at this quality and so it was converted to a lower quality format.  Now that we all have shiny HD capable televisions. They can go back through the old film prints and reconvert them to HD. Which is half of what Pivot have done - except they've gone and made a lot of their own crazy changes.   It is nothing to do with upscaling.

buffy,33q89j,welshwordman,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"I think Netflix has actually alternated back and forth between the original 4:3 version and the widescreen (for later seasons).

buffy,33pu9o,ausbigshow,3,Fri Apr 24 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's a well made game. There is enough action involved (for both good and evil players) and it seems to be balanced between the two. For instance, evil doesn't always win.   I've only played with at most two players and it works very well for this. I imagine it would be quite different playing teams, but I'm sure it's do-able.   The only thing I dislike isn't about the game itself, it's that there are no expansion packs. It would be really fun to have options of more big bad's - Glory and her minions, The First, etc. Also to have those expansions carry some more help, research, weapon, and evil cards.   But as games go, this is one of my favorite board games to play. And I once played with a person who never watched Buffy and they liked it. (They also started watching Buffy shortly thereafter and now enjoy the show as well!)"
buffy,33p5ql,SheffScientist,11,Fri Apr 24 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"It's not my favorite (5 all the way), but it definitely has the highest number of great episodes.

buffy,33p5ql,Sludgeycore,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:35:08 2015 UTC,Season 3 has the best worst episodes!
buffy,33p5ql,LarsP,9,Mon Apr 27 01:36:49 2015 UTC,"Season 2 has a special place in my heart. It has a really good mix of action, drama, inter-group struggles with Angelus, the introduction of Spike and Dru. Season 3 and 6 would be tied for second place for me.   Season 4 is my least favorite season, but it has many of my favorite individual episodes, Hush being chief among them for obvious reasons. I didn't like Adam and I felt like the Initiative was kinda underdeveloped as a power in the supernatural world.   But season 2 is and always has been my favorite. It is when I really started falling in love with the show and the characters, and, imho, struck the best balance of comedy, action, and drama for the series.   edit: I totally agree with you though, the Mayor is the best big bad in the show. I obsessively clean under my nails because of that character."
buffy,33p5ql,FunWinterSport,5,Fri Apr 24 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"Seasons 1-3 of Buffy, and 1-2 of Angel are pure gold."
buffy,33p5ql,jtreezy,3,Sat Apr 25 00:41:44 2015 UTC,"Season 2 of Angel is great. One of my favorite scenes in the in the whole series, I think the episode is called Untouched or something like that, but there is the telekinetic girl and she is at the hotel. She opens up the door and there is her father and he says, ""Hello, rabbit."" Then the camera shows the outside of the hotel and all the windows on the floor get blasted out. That was so epic and well done!"
buffy,33p5ql,FunWinterSport,5,Sat Apr 25 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"It became my favourite after repeat viewings but I don't think it's anyone's favourite the first time through. The first time I watched it I think I decided 5 was the best, then 6 on my first rewatch. Now I'm all about 3"
buffy,33p5ql,TheCrushSoda,8,Sat Apr 25 01:16:35 2015 UTC,Season 5 is the best season by far. All the scoobies grow as characters. Glory is the best big bad. There is Dawn. I just love it a lot.

buffy,33p5ql,AGhostLP,4,Fri Apr 24 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. It really encapsulates the whole show-- it's the most 'Buffy' of all the Buffy seasons, to me. Love, loss, growing up, losing friends, it's all in there. Not to mention the Mayor is just incredible."

I love Faith and her story; we get to see the flip side of being a Slayer. Earshot and band Candy though!  Love those episodes. Of the early seasons I think Season 2 is bloody amazing. And I am very partial to Seasons 6 and 7, with 6 being my all-time favorite, no matter how many times I watch them."

Harmony wasn't the nicest person, but she did voluntarily give her life fighting a terrifying enemy."
buffy,33k50t,LarsP,2,Thu Apr 23 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"Me too. I loved her in that scene! It was definitely different than most actors ""laughing"" but I liked it."

buffy,33k50t,StarManta,3,Sun Apr 26 02:09:21 2015 UTC,"See her laughing never bothered me, personally. I do, however, remember hearing (in one of the commentaries maybe?) that SMG didn't like doing fake laughter."
buffy,33k50t,GentleObsession,62,Thu Apr 23 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"James Marsters was consistently amazing. I really liked Juliet Landau as Drusilla. She was always so horrifyingly childlike and creepy. She nailed the character. Perfect amount of dreamy/crazy/terrifying/innocent/everything else Drusilla is. I just read an article where Joss Whedon was talking about how he likes to mash genre's together instead of stick to one thing, and I feel like Drusilla is this in character form."
buffy,33k50t,theevilgiraffe,24,Thu Apr 23 05:29:16 2015 UTC,"Dru is one of my favorites and I feel like most fans either love or hate her. Her and Spike together with their distinctly crazy personalities were always such a highlight. She definitely was consistently awesome from her first appearances in Sunnydale, to later flashbacks and The First appearing as her."

buffy,33k50t,withdelight,3,Thu Apr 23 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed about Drusilla is that the first time I watched the series, I couldn't stand her - but after watching all of Angel and now starting my second time through Buffy, I adore her! I'm not sure what changed, but she's gone from my least favorite to one of my favorites."

buffy,33k50t,JangoF76,43,Fri Apr 24 06:43:38 2015 UTC,"The main cast were all good, but I really loved Emma Caulfield. She could obviously do comedy really well. On the few occasions when they gave her a serious scene she nailed it. I reckon switching in an instant from comic relief to tragedy takes some real acting chops. Her scenes in 'The Body' and her whole performance in 'Selfless' are two that stand out especially."
buffy,33k50t,milewskia2,15,Thu Apr 23 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I really dislike the whole Xander and Anya dynamic post Hell's Bells. It would have been nice to have them as the one light in a midst of darkness."

buffy,33k50t,dgener151,31,Fri May 1 03:54:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think SMG ever got enough credit. As the lead surrounded by a cast of colorful and quirky characters, it'd have been very easy for Buffy to be a simple cipher. But Sarah brings total honest humanity to the character through the entire run. Such a gauntlet of snark, longing, tenderness, fury, and utter despair and she makes that shit look easy."
buffy,33k50t,sylban,27,Thu Apr 23 11:11:17 2015 UTC,"I always found Nicholas Brendon absolutely convincing, no matter what he said or did. He was Xander, as far I'm concerned, and consequently I found Xander the single most believable of all the characters on the show, though I loved many of them. Brendon's portrayal had a powerful anchoring effect on any scene the character was in, so that no scene involving Xander ever felt to me like it might skip a groove or somehow run off the rails, no matter what might happen. There were definitely some specific scenes and even whole episodes where I found the written material noticeably weaker or more awkward, but Brendon seems to have the rare and coveted Hackman gene, which makes everything he's in watchable and enjoyable even if it's objectively weak in some way. I look forward to seeing more from him in, honestly, anything."
buffy,33k50t,StarManta,2,Thu Apr 23 08:39:08 2015 UTC,"Every show needs an everyman, and Xander was it, to a tee."
buffy,33k50t,Gneissisnice,15,Sun Apr 26 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Alyson Hannigan. She was always spot on and perfectly captured the adorable awkwardness of Willow (well, in the first couple of seasons at least, before she got more badass).   Even in episodes I didn't like much, like Wrecked or Smashed, I still had to admire her performances."
buffy,33k50t,Mr_Evil_Monkey,3,Thu Apr 23 12:22:43 2015 UTC,"Her whole arc saw the widest growth and strangest tangents and I believed every minute of it. Only just finished season 6 for the first time, but I like how she seems to pick such sex positive roles. From her first experiences with Oz to her deep love with Tara, even her brief turn as a sexy vamp, she never comes across as a slut or the scary girl who likes sex. Even in the pie movies and himym, she plays roles that definitely like sex, certainly into a modicum of kink, but responsibly vocal with her partners and usually monogamous. For all the HeForShe and gender equality talk surfacing of late in regards to bedroom activities and how women are portrayed, Allyson has been a champion her whole career. And it all started with Buffy."
buffy,33k50t,digne94,37,Sat Apr 25 03:03:43 2015 UTC,Alyson Hannigan can shed a tear like no other.
buffy,33k50t,caelub166923,8,Thu Apr 23 05:51:06 2015 UTC,She's my favorite actor on the show. Willow and Xander are the best

buffy,33k50t,VanillaMoonPie,8,Thu Apr 23 11:29:54 2015 UTC,Sarah Michelle Gellar just knocked out every scene she was in. I loved her work.  James Marsters was also particularly fantastic. He truly made Spike a much more interesting character than it would have otherwise been.
buffy,33k50t,GinaZaneburritos,6,Thu Apr 23 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot of good acting in the show, but someone I think is often overlooked is Kristine Sutherland.  I thought she was perfect as Joyce."

buffy,33k50t,LarsP,6,Thu Apr 23 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Almost all the actors did amazing work, that they haven't really been able to match since.  So I suspect much of the credit actually goes to Joss for spotting the strengths of each actor and writing story lines that let them shine."
buffy,33k50t,The_Iron_Zeppelin,9,Thu Apr 23 15:37:56 2015 UTC,I felt Eliza Dushku as Faith was a phenomenal portrayal.  She was a great foil to Buffy and demonstrated the side of the Slayer we didn't get to see with Buffy.  The lonely outsider.  The personality she gave Faith still holds true in the comics as well which keeps me reading.
buffy,33k50t,orange_lazarus1,6,Thu Apr 23 17:00:14 2015 UTC,She was great with the Mayor but I thought she was amazing in Dollhouse... really wished that show was give a fair chance.

buffy,33k50t,Swarlolz,5,Thu Apr 23 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Xander, he never lost his gooyfiness the entire series even when he was dieing."
buffy,33k50t,catdoctor,2,Fri Apr 24 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"James Marsters. The writers kept changing their mind about what Spike was: evil villain, comic relief, love interest, hero. And each time James made it work, evolving the character without ever losing the core of who Spike was. Since James is a Method actor, this must have caused him no end of agony, but what we get on the screen was totally worth it."
buffy,33k50t,fifosexapel,3,Mon Apr 27 23:56:29 2015 UTC,gotta go with my boy Gilesy (yes i call him gilesy). anthony stewart head performance was always on and he was required to do so much. gotta love those bone chilling moments when he gets all dark and serious.
buffy,33k50t,stillnotking,3,Fri Apr 24 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Alyson Hannigan is underrated as an actor. She's not in the class of Anthony Stewart Head, who is a genius and by far the best in the main cast, but she's really, really good.  All the more disappointing that she took a bunch of fluff roles (including a certain sitcom that ran for ten seasons on no merit that I can see) during & after BtVS. Now I guess she isn't acting much at all. Sad."

A hundred plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of. You. Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say I love you, it's not because I want you, or because I can't have you - it has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try... I've seen your kindness, and your strength, I've seen the best and the worst of you and I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.

If there's no great glorious end to all this, if nothing we do matters... , then all that matters is what we do. 'Cause that's all there is. What we do. Now. Today. ... I wanna help because, I don't think people should suffer as they do. Because, if there's no bigger meaning, then the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world.""

buffy,33blqd,angryelves,34,Tue Apr 21 04:48:55 2015 UTC,"I never thought of Xander as being lesser than the others. He's one of the most complex characters in Buffy. Willow's parents obviously love her but are neo hippies and have a hard time relating to her. Buffy's parents are divorced but obviously still show their affection for their daughter. Xanders parents don't like each other let alone their son, and while it's never stated it is implied that Xanders dad may abuse his mother.   Xander deflects with comedy or wit but he's hurting throughout the series. Before he moves out, you would think he'd rather fight Angelus than go home most of the time. He's the glue in the group, the watcher and the protector despite the fact that he's the most non special Scooby because that is his family. He's overprotective of Buffy because she's been hurt by boys before and seems to have a thing for unnecrophilia.   Watching the show when it was on air I think made Xander more understandable. His solo and standout episodes show how much there is there for the character, and I think they highlight what he does and who he is in the group. The zeppo is the best example. He's doing his own thing, stuck in a horrible situation he figures his way out of AND finds a way to help Buffy and the other Scoobies with their off screen apocalypse."
buffy,33blqd,kaggzz,11,Tue Apr 21 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but often he ends up as a side number or comedic relief which is kind of sad.  One of the greatest things about buffy in my opinion is how all the characters grow along the years. And Xander is a great example of this."
buffy,33blqd,Tank404,9,Tue Apr 21 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"That's because Xander doesn't deal half as well as we see him dealing.  He uses comedy to deflect, as some of his best lines are given when he is at his lowest point.  Xander is the most seemingly open of the Scoobies, but he's really one of the most closed off in a lot of ways.    Think of it in terms of Xander, the Scoobie Watcher.  Xander's home life is dominated by his drunken father.  Xander's greatest fear is that he is truly his father's son, so much so that he would rather break Anya's heart on their wedding and knowingly ruin any hope of happiness for them then become the man he fears at home.  He starts the series as friends with Willow, the quiet nerdy bookish girl who he's known since forever.  Both qualities are very important.  Willow knows Xander's situation (or at least has more knowledge than the average bear) and she's the exact opposite of his home life.  Willow's quiet, smart, and has a degree of culture.  Buffy's entry to the group, the formation of the Scoobies has a lot to do with Xander learning to be in a group and be given problems and fights that makes the ones he sees at home, the ones he feels at home, less.  His zeal to help what he sees as a real problem is what makes the Scoobies come together.  Without Xander, WIllow is just a FemAndrew in waiting, Oz is a villain of the week, Cordelia is a stuck up rhymes with bitch who ends up marrying the first guy she can with the words Doctor in front of his name, and Buffy and Giles are dead or worse.  Yes, Xander is standing to the side, but he's closer to the center that way and it's more of a spotlight than he's comfortable with for most of the series.  This is also why Vamp Xander is so appealing.  As a Vampire, Xander is comfortable with his legacy, knowing he can be so much more of a bad guy than his father ever dreamed of.  Like Angelus, VampDer is guided by his history of familial neglect and disappointment to new depths of depravity.  Often, though, it seems like VampDer is more than happy to watch Vamp Willow have her fun, because he still likes the idea, like Spike, of someone who shares his interests and can still confide in."
buffy,33blqd,kaggzz,4,Tue Apr 21 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed both these write ups. Thank you for that.  I wrote a blog post years ago on Anya and Xander's relationship - my main point was similar, that their relationship was one of the most complex and human depicted not just in Buffy but in a lot of TV."
buffy,33blqd,wbright92,5,Tue Apr 21 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"I would say next to Buffy he is the most important character in the show, because he has not special powers.  Everyone else has or had some sort of power yet Xander has nothing and he is the first to put himself in harms way."
buffy,33blqd,orange_lazarus1,2,Tue Apr 21 19:42:28 2015 UTC,I agree that Xander is a complex cat; I like him. I just thought vamp Xander nailed it. Best vampire I've seen in the show. On par with Caleb. Just really really liked Xander in that role.
buffy,33blqd,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Apr 22 09:06:13 2015 UTC,"As much as the show likes to tell us that Xander is the heart/glue of the group, I've really never gotten that impression just based on events and actions. The only thing that immediately comes to mind is the S6 finale, but frankly that's less about the group and more about his relationship with Willow specifically. Honestly, off the top of my head, I can think of more times where he causes rifts in the group than times when he holds the group together.   Any Buffy scholars care to refute this? I'd really like to be shown the error of my ways on this."

buffy,33apv6,AGhostLP,3,Tue Apr 21 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"A dead Buffy probably has some sort of insurance, and Dawn being a fully realized being is probably collecting SSI death benefits from Buffy and her Mother's passings.  It may have been just enough to cover the food and mortgage with both, but when Buffy got better they probably have some kind of system in place to keep it hushed up and stop the death benefits from coming in.  We know the government types know about the Slayer and we know that the Watchers have people who think about this sort of thing as well, and just because Buffy was on the outs from both groups, their desire for secrecy would necessarily make that mundane sort of thing enough of a priority to kibosh any auditor going ""Aren't you suppose to be dead... twice?"""
buffy,33apv6,kaggzz,9,Tue Apr 21 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Buffy never really ""died."" I think the Scoobies just tossed her in a coffin and buried her.

Hospital bills pretty much sucked up all the money... yet somehow there's still electricity and food in the house and has been for the last few months.

buffy,337vrp,coolbeaNs92,12,Tue Apr 21 01:07:19 2015 UTC,That's not what OP is asking. They're asking if there are crossover storylines between Buffy and Angel. OP is giving an example of Arrow and The Flash because they have shared story lines in several episodes.
buffy,337vrp,johnluckpickerd,17,Mon Apr 20 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"There are crossovers, and you'll need to watch them in the right order, but you haven't reached that point yet.

buffy,337vrp,TheDemonHauntedWorld,3,Fri Apr 24 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"I don't fell that it's strictly important to watch them side by side... specially after Buffy's S4 and Angel's S1. Of course if you want to, it's better. But I personally just binged a few episodes of each at a time, and than next time go to the other show and binge a few episodes, than go back... and so on and so forth.  Also is important to point out that on Buffy's S6 and Angel's S3 and after, it's not linear the order of the episodes... what I mean it's not a Buffy-Angel-Buffy-Angel anymore like previously. If you REALLY want to follow the right order you'll have to check the release dates for the episodes."
buffy,337vrp,GoncasCrazy,3,Mon Apr 20 14:21:40 2015 UTC,The only instance (post Angel S1) where I think watching them side by side really enhances the viewing experience is the very last scene of Angel S2. Right in the freaking feels.
buffy,337vrp,jimmyolsenblues,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"I think in order to really get Faith's character arc you have to watch them side by side. She goes direct from Buffy to Angel, then to jail, then to Angel then Buffy - she jumps back and forth, and if you just e.g. watch Buffy straight through, it may seem like out of nowhere everyone's willing to let Faith back into their lives (if not quite ready to forgive her), and that only makes sense if you've watched her in between episodes on Angel.  And there are other little bits that are better if viewed in order. Harmony, Buffy's death, Forever, etc."

What is wrong with this message and what is the reasoning behind it being wrong?   It says ""1996 Cheerleading Tryouts""; the episode wasn't aired until 1997.  Buffy season one ""Witch"" gives us our first body swap episode. Unlike Faith, Amy's mom doesn't learn anything during the experience.  Xander gets a taste of his own medicine:   Xander: Cool. Was she wearing it? (off her look) The bracelet. She was wearing it, right? That's pretty much like we're going out.  Willow: Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.  Xander: So now I'm a figure of fun. I should just ask, right?  Willow: Won't know till you ask.  Xander: See, this is why you're cool. You're like a guy. You're my guy friend that knows about girl stuff.  Willow: Oh great. I'm a guy.    Buffy: I know you don't. That's cause you're my friend. You're my Xander-shaped friend. (wells up) ...do you have any idea why I love you so, Xander?  Willow: We gotta get you to-  Xander: Let her speak!  Buffy: I'll tell you. You're not like other guys at all...  Xander: Well...  Buffy: You are completely and totally one of the girls. I'm that comfy with you.  (Willow can't help but look a little pleased; Xander looks like he just got cancer.)  Xander: That's great.   Amber trained with coach Benson in an episode titled ""Witch"".   (They watch Amber's routine- she's really good.)  Amy: She trained with Benson- he's the best coach money can buy.      Did you get any training on the set?  Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy): Actually we learned with the Laker Girls and the LA clipper girls. They were great. They were checking our moves and they have real dance backgrounds, so they were throwing in stuff. We were like, ""What, what?"" Still, it helped that I could be pretty bad.      Cordelia: Just look at Amber. Who does she think she is, a Laker Girl?  Willow: I heard she turned them down.   Angel Spoilers: Cordelia"

Well, maybe she did, unfortunately she was never able to do anything with it...  I've always assumed that she stayed trapped in that trophy until the school was finally destroyed, but, it is kind of neat to imagine that maybe when the trophy was destroyed she was released, into some form, who knows what, to become one of the millions of random bads lurking beneath Sunnydale."
buffy,334jjg,AngelAmongUs,6,Sun Apr 19 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"Catherine: A few months ago I woke up in her bed, I didn't know where I was... and I looked in the mirror...   I suppose it's possible that while trapped in the trophy she would have time to contemplate her behavior and feel regret, but she spent months in her daughter's body, and when forced to return to her own, tried to banish her only child to a horrible existence. If she ever got free from the trophy it seems likely that  a person like that would seek revenge on those she feels are responsible for her ending up there."
buffy,334jjg,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sun Apr 19 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"I never thought about what happened to her spirit right after the HS blew up, but I did write a story (for a contest, never revised for permanent posting) about her spirit doing horrible things in 2026. She takes on the form of a ""friendly older woman named Kathy"" She gives cheerleading tips to Buffy and Angel's older daughter/second child (""Joyce Anne"" the Cordelia of the piece in my main ficverse) and, once she gains the girl's trust, uses her to cause strange but familiar conditions to befall several of the Extended Scoobie Family."
buffy,334jjg,its99pm,3,Wed Apr 22 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"There was a fanfic on this premise. She merged with the burnt remnants of Mayor-Snake and I think Maggie Walsh? Somehow?

buffy,334jjg,norrin__radd,2,Sun Apr 19 19:04:16 2015 UTC,I think there's a cut line in the script for a season 4 episode where a character mentions that the eyes on the trophy was moving.

buffy,334jjg,MoonSpider,3,Sun Apr 19 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"It's a fun coincidence, sure, but it's fairly impossible to have been done on purpose---even if Joss knew well in advance that he'd write the character of Tara (which he didn't; at this point in the series he still hadn't decided whether to have Xander or Willow eventually end up in a same-sex relationship) the casting process where they ended up interviewing Amber would not take place until season 4, so Amber Benson wasn't connected to the production in any way when they made 'Witch.'"
buffy,334jjg,Gneissisnice,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"It's possible that Amber Benson auditioned for a role early on and Whedon knew he wanted to cast her in a role at some point, even before Tara was even thought up.   Still not likely, but technically possible."
buffy,334jjg,MoonSpider,3,Sun Apr 19 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, but to say they'd prioritize that to the point where they would deliberately match up a professional chearleading coach with a certain last name to another actor as some sort of call-forward joke to an actress in a role they hadn't written yet? Not at all.   They could write a reference in the text of the show, maybe, but this is a coincidence of hiring technicians behind the scenes.  A lot of people have the name 'Benson.'      These are inter-departmental hiring concerns, there's no way Joss or anyone else involved in writing or casting would be vetting an athletic coach in the stunt department based on her name instead of her credentials."
buffy,334jjg,Enzown,2,Sun Apr 19 19:41:51 2015 UTC,Of course it wasn't.
buffy,334jjg,bright_ephemera,11,Mon Apr 20 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love about BtvS is the unexpected recurring characters. Harmony and Jonathan are the first ones I think of but Amy gets some great recurrences too. Season 1, Season 4 (for two seconds!), Season 6.  However, I can't help but feel like she must end up with the worst case of body dysphoria (is that the word?) ever."
buffy,334jjg,CJGibson,7,Sun Apr 19 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, Amy appears in every season except for five.  2: Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered, when she falls in love with Xander along with all the other ladies in Sunnydale.  3: Gingerbread, where she almost gets burned at the stake.  4: Something Blue, where she briefly gets de-ratted.  6: Three appearances in the ongoing Willow-is-addicted-to-magic plotline  7: The Killer in Me, where she curses Willow to turn into Warren  If you count Rat-Amy, she actually appears in all of them I think."
buffy,334jjg,barre_chord_reality,5,Mon Apr 20 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"This is really a great genesis episode. Think about it, this episode already reveals a tiny layer of Ripper. It also sets up the character of Amy, who is somewhat of a bit character here, but when she returns in a later season, has a huge impact on the entire world.   Aside from that, this episode is paced nicely and makes good use of a budget that essentially amounts to nothing.  I loved the ending too."
buffy,334jjg,A40,8,Sun Apr 19 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"The only problem with ""Witch""? The cliche green-bubbly cauldron ;-)"
buffy,334jjg,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sun Apr 19 15:28:44 2015 UTC,What's that? A cauldron? Who uses a cauldron anymore?
buffy,334jjg,theperfectend,5,Sun Apr 19 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"I really like this episode, I think the pacing is good, it's a little lighter than the previous two so we start to see character personalities more and there is some good dialogue in there.   when Joyce says they had to move to Sunnydale to find a decent school that would take Buffy, do you think this could have been planned by, for instance, the watchers council or even the powers that be? They instrumented her move so she would be at a Hellmouth? I think that is a cool dimension if true.   My favourite moment is when Willow and Xander jump in to help Buffy without hesitation, there was never any doubt for them that they would now be a part of this. Cute."
buffy,334jjg,its99pm,9,Sun Apr 19 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I've read several fanfics where it's mentioned/revealed that the WC made the arrangements for both Buffy being accepted into Sunnydale High and the gallery position opening up for Joyce. Subtly engineering it so that Joyce would choose to move there, rather than to some other town. I think it's pretty likely."
buffy,334jjg,barre_chord_reality,3,Sun Apr 19 19:06:47 2015 UTC,This is excellent. I hadn't even thought any of these scenarios with regards to how Buffy made it to Sunnydale.
buffy,334jjg,The_Ripper42,5,Sun Apr 19 21:25:59 2015 UTC,Amy in her mom's body said they switched months ago so does that mean it was her mom who messed up try outs?
buffy,334jjg,theperfectend,3,Sun Apr 19 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"See that's what bothered me (I only noticed it on this watch through). She says that she hates try outs, talks about her mum in a way that just doesn't really make sense for it to be Mrs Madison, and she looks horrified when the other girls mouth seals up. I thought maybe they switched back and forth but when Amy said that it didn't make sense.   The only explanation is when she says something like ""I can't get my body to move like hers"", she is wearing an unfamiliar body so she doesn't quite have the control that she had of her own."
buffy,334jjg,GinaZaneburritos,6,Sun Apr 19 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's not so much that it's an unfamiliar body; it's just that Amy is naturally not as athletic or flexible as her mom. Catherine is frustrated that despite her skill and practice in her daughter's body, she still ""can't get it to move"" like normal.  I always assumed that Catherine was just nervous before the try-outs. She says later:   AMY: Why do my hands have to sweat when I get nervous?  BUFFY: Don't worry, you'll do great.   She's annoyed that instead of her old body, she has one that she (first of all) had to make thinner (as Willow says, she ""lost a lot of weight""), and secondly, just isn't built the same as hers. As Buffy says to her mom, not all 16-year-olds are the same. :)  When Catherine/Amy talks about her mom, it's always about how wonderful she is, despite how ""hokey"" it sounds. To me, it's clearly Catherine talking.   AMY: Her nickname was Catherine The Great: she took that team and made them tri-county champions, no one's ever done that before or since. She and my dad were homecoming King and Queen, got married right after graduation.  BUFFY: That's kinda romantic.  AMY: Well... he was a big loser, couldn't make any money, took off with Miss Trailer Trash when I was twelve.  BUFFY: Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too.  AMY: Drag, huh. He left my mom with nothing. She put herself through cosmetology school, bought me everything I ever wanted and never gained a single pound...   As for how horrified she looks when the girl's mouth disappears, I think that's mostly acting. Or possibly she didn't do it on purpose, but it was triggered by an irritated emotional reaction to Buffy's find-the-witch trick (this is less likely, though, because the targeted girl is also a cheerleader). When she returns home, she talks about how Buffy's going around stealing pieces of her hair - so it was definitely Catherine in the science lab.  I don't think they're switching back and forth; I think Amy has been stuck in her mother's body for a few months, just as she said."
buffy,334jjg,The_Ripper42,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"If Amy's mom lost the weight for Amy, how do you think she felt getting back into her body and it being much skinnier than before? I feel like that would have to have a serious impact on her self image in some way."
buffy,334jjg,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Apr 22 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of it is pure speculation, because we're really not given much insight into Amy. Willow describes her as ""nice,"" and that is our final impression of her in this episode.  She has a fairly witty comment about the ""intellectual thrill of spelling out words with her arms,"" then apologizes to Buffy when she realizes how it could have come across to her. She loves being doted on by her father. It's interesting that the next time we see her she's busy shirking her responsibilities, using mind control and magic to avoid doing homework. It's a big difference in her personality that is mentioned (""Amy's the last person should be messing with that stuff"") but is never really explained in the show.  I would guess that one explanation for Amy's seemingly complete 180 in terms of personality is that she enjoyed being thinner (we never see her gain the weight back, after all), but I find it likely that she didn't enjoy the discipline it took to remain thin. After such a horrible experience, perhaps she felt as though she deserved ""a break.""  It seems that Amy could be naturally rather lazy (she spends her days in front of the TV, eating junk food); rather than work to gain advantage, she takes the shortcut. She knows that she has (or could have) the power to affect the world, because she's seen what her mom was able to do, and so she cultivates it."
buffy,334jjg,360Saturn,2,Sun Apr 26 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"I always took that to mean that the mom made them start switching bodies months ago, and that she's just been working her way up to fully taking her over.  Otherwise, Buffy would never have known the 'real' Amy and so wouldnt've twigged that she was acting oddly or differently."
buffy,334jjg,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Apr 22 05:13:55 2015 UTC,"Otherwise, Buffy would never have known the 'real' Amy and so wouldnt've twigged that she was acting oddly or differently.   Buffy was able to recognize that Mrs. Madison was actually Amy because Willow had told her about Amy. She had never met Amy before the beginning of the episode. Not only was Buffy a new student who had been around for only a week or two, but she was explicitly introduced to ""Amy"" at the cheerleader tryouts.   WILLOW: Do you know Buffy?  AMY: Hi. (to Buffy) Oh how I hate this, let me count the ways.   Willow tells Buffy that she used to hang out with Amy in junior high and how they would ""stuff themselves with brownies"" when her mom ""went on a broth kick.""  When ""Amy"" didn't make the squad, Buffy tries to cheer her up:   BUFFY: At least it's over. And you know what I think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, now.   Which ""Amy"" rejects. Her entire personality seems different from what Willow had described - she's no longer interested in brownies and she talks about how great her mom is, when Amy used to hide out over at Willow's house. Buffy also knows that Catherine Madison was obsessive about not gaining weight, and according to Willow, Amy had lost a lot of weight.  When Buffy and Giles go over to Mrs. Madison's house, Buffy sees a tray of brownies that ""Catherine"" had hidden under the sofa. Everything comes together for her and she can tell that she's actually the real Amy.  There are a number of body-swap episodes in Buffy, and in none of them are people switching back and forth. The dolls Giles finds include a woman and a girl tied together. The spell has been in effect for months. ""Amy"" has been living her daughter's life in order to prepare for and relive her cheerleading days, while Amy had been spending her days watching TV, eating brownies, and doing homework."
buffy,334jjg,GinaZaneburritos,5,Thu Apr 23 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"I really like this episode, and there are a number of things about it that strike me as interesting and worthy of discussion.  Magic   First of all, this is the first time we ever see a magic user on the show, and she is a villain who (like a demon or a vampire) uses her supernatural powers to maim and kill.  As Giles said at the end of ""The Harvest"":   Giles: I'd say the fun is just beginning.  Willow: More vampires?  Giles: Not just vampires. The next creature we face may be something quite different.   In fact, the next ""creature"" they face is not a creature at all, but another human being, albeit one who is demonic in her behavior.  Like a demon, Catherine is not someone they try to reason with or turn over to the police. I always thought it would have been interesting to know what they planned to do with her after reversing her spells (if she hadn't conveniently banished herself to the statue). Because I always thought of her as human, if a particularly unpleasant kind of human.   Perhaps Catherine Madison was not so much ""Mommie Dearest"" in a normal human sort of way, but was more similar to the magic users Sam spoke of in ""As You Were"":   Back in the jungle we had not one but two hard core shamans working for us. They were working the dark Magicks. Got addicted. And now they're gone. ""Gone"" as in nothing left.   We're told very little of her backstory; it's unclear whether she had always been evil (although it seems likely she had always been a witch), or whether she had become that way more recently. But either way, not only is our first witch someone who seems barely human and undeniably evil, the door is left open for the interpretation that magic itself can be the cause.  Performing magic in general (even a counterspell) is also shown to be a dangerous, dark activity. In order to save Buffy's life and undo all of Catherine's spells, Giles has to call upon Corsheth and Gilail to ""unlock the gate,"" ""let the darkness shine,"" and ""cover them with holy fear."" He offers his own ""energy"" to these beings and demands that they take it and ""be sated"" and ""release the unworthy."" In terms of self-sacrifice and calling upon demons (Catherine also calls upon Corsheth when she tries to curse her daughter), the spell seems almost as dark (and as powerful) as the one Willow performs to resurrect Buffy in s6.  Suggestively, the script describes Giles from Buffy's dying POV like this:   Giles continues the spell, in Buffy's increasingly weird, dark view. His voice is not even human to her anymore.    Giles   Which brings me to Giles. :) His behavior here is much more complex and layered than the stuffy grown-up telling Buffy of her destiny and the latest crisis on the Hellmouth.  Although the episode begins by re-establishing Giles and Buffy's current relationship (he tries to forbid her from cheerleading; she protests and says she'll have time both for normalcy and slaying), by the end we have seen a different side of Giles. Seeing Buffy incapacitated with only a few hours to live, Giles suddenly becomes much more decisive, forceful, and dark. He pushes his way into Catherine/Amy's house and confronts her, saying ""You will shut up and you will listen to me.""   As Buffy becomes more and more ill, Giles gives several indications that he is much more familiar with spell-casting and black magic than he lets on. Despite not knowing anything about the body-swap before coming to the house, he takes one look at the dolls and cauldron in Catherine's house and knows instantly what's going on and that he can reverse the spells, but only with the ""certain volumes [that] she would need for this type of casting."" He recognizes that the cat is guarding something, and he finds her spell book easily.  When he goes to the school, he prepares for the spell like this:   He goes over to the glass cabinet with the chemicals in it. It's locked. Casually, still looking down at the book for reference, he picks up a metal beaker and smashes the glass. He looks in and starts picking out vials of useful substances.   To me, these scenes suggest that Giles has a restrained darkness, one that is able to surface when people he cares about are threatened. It hints at his dark past and also his reluctance to share it with anyone, given the way he only evidences any particular knowledge or skill when he feels it is necessary and, in fact, takes pains to leave the impression he is innocent in these matters (telling Buffy that it was his ""first casting"").   It would be interesting to compare and contrast the way Angel and Giles both mislead Buffy about their respective pasts and natures in these early episodes.   A few other things I noticed and thought were noteworthy:  Jesse  I find it strange that there's no mention of him at all in this episode. Xander appreciates Willow being ""like a guy - like a guy friend who understands about girl stuff""; I find it a little odd that this kind of conversation wouldn't cause him to remember the other ""guy friend"" he had. Overall, Xander seems pretty cheerful for someone who has just lost a friend. A passing mention would have been nice. :/  Willow  I thought this was a very interesting passage in the script that was not in the episode:   At a large table. Xander holds a scalpel poised over a frog. He lowers the scalpel, then:  XANDER: I can't.  He puts the scalpel down. Willow takes it, makes (off camera) a quick neat incision.  WILLOW: One eye of newt...  XANDER: Wow, you've got a killer streak I've never seen before. Hope I never cross you.  WILLOW: I do too, then I'd have to carve you up in neat little pieces.  She holds up the scalpel, gives him her sweet ""Willow"" smile.  XANDER: Ha ha. (takes scalpel respectfully) How's Buffy coming with the hair?   Buffy season 6  Buffy  This is the first indication we get that magic works the same on slayers as it does on everyone else. :) Not only does the Bloodstone Vengeance spell work on Buffy (there's actually no indication that Catherine even knew Buffy was a Slayer) exactly as it would on a human, but Buffy is at first unaware that anything is different, attributing her own bizarre behavior to a ""good mood."" Even though it's obvious to Willow and Xander (and Joyce) immediately that something's wrong.  The other thing that struck me is Buffy being remarkably intuitive in this episode. She knows something's up with Cordelia - also, apparently she knows where her locker is? This struck me as a little strange, given that the ""We Hate Cordelia"" club didn't even seem to know.  Additionally, she can tell Catherine is Amy before Giles can, despite her illness. Mostly because of the brownies, but I think she also could tell something was off about her as well."
buffy,334jjg,MargotFenring,3,Mon Apr 20 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"I like your observations about Giles, because when he said it was his first casting or whatever I was like UH-OH, that doesn't line up with Ripper. But then again he is definitely still trying to figure out how to fit himself in as her Watcher, going back and forth between stuffy father figure and ""go forth and slay""."
buffy,334jjg,buffanater,3,Mon Apr 20 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"my weekly episode notes   1 A lot of the opening credits footage comes from this episode.  2 I kinda forgot what a b***h Cordy was early on. 3  probably just a continuity error, but Giles says this was his first spell. A in-universe explanation could be that he doesn't consider what he did as Ripper him.  4 I wonder if Will and Amy talked about being witches before.    Edit    5 As others mentioned, ""Amber"" and ""Benson"" being names of people in the same episode is awesome."

Given Kendra and Faith's Slayer-Watcher relationships and the rest of the Council's aloofness, I've always imagined the Slayer-Watcher relationship to typically be quite one-sided, with the Watcher keeping things back from their Slayer. Its only later, or gradually,  I think,  that Giles and Buffy become close and mutually trusting, and even then this is portrayed as unusual for a Watcher and a Slayer, which has always implied to me that the Watcher is typically more secretive."

For instance, in real life there was the mother who murdered the cheerleader because her daughter didn’t make the cheerleading squad, and you had the cheerleader episode of the show.  WHEDON: I remember talking about that. I don’t remember saying, “Oh, let’s take that and make it a horror story.” But while we were developing the story, I had seen that. And I thought, again, here’s a story that works because we’re taking it from something, as bizarre as it is, that’s kind of real. This competition does get this insane.  GREENWALT: Again, he took the psychological truth that if a mother could, that type of mother, if she could take her daughter’s body, she would. That’s what I like about this show. It goes that one extra step because it’s psychologically driven."

buffy,3307ej,_o_O_o_O_o_,3,Sat Apr 18 05:48:01 2015 UTC,"agreed, watching season 3 and 4 makes me almost forget Tara exists. I still like Tara, I just tend to like Oz more. Although my bias towards short men and Seth Green being portrayed as a short, silent, strong young man in the series is probably blocking my view."
buffy,3307ej,Mquestionmark,4,Sat Apr 18 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"Thats true too.. I love Seth Green. And I love Oz. So its a circle of feels :)  I think Oz also benefits from a nostalgia factor. He's there when the world is a simpler place for everyone... and Willow is still just a sweet little kid :)   I mean, yes Vampires exist, but still the scooby battles are kid stuff compared to the much much darker stuff they have to deal with in the latter seasons."
buffy,3307ej,Mquestionmark,4,Sun Apr 19 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"I've always just found it amazing that a character with very little dialog and only a few episodes centered on himself (most of them being also shared with Willow) can impact a show so heavily.   When Oz left the group felt a little empty for a while before replacing him, and I felt the weight of him leaving for a very long time afterwards. I also missed the Xander and Oz bromance moments of them trying to save the day and ending up in silly situations (like him and Xander falling through the ceiling while Buffy and Willow are tied up and are about to be killed)  I felt the loss of Tara as well, and she definitely did interact with other members of the group (Buffy, Dawn, Spike etc) but the loss of her felt like Willow's loss more than anything. Plus both Amber and Seth are both cool individuals by themselves and really nice to fans.  They make it so hard to choose one over the other. (although personally I prefer the sweet simplicity of Oz. His directness and simple way of doing things really would have been useful throughout the season 6+7 drama)"
buffy,3307ej,buffanater,3,Sun Apr 19 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"The dynamic of the relation is also different IMO. With Oz and Willow, they feel equal in some way. But Willow and Tara were not really equal in the relationship. In many ways Willow was the dominating one.  And I completely agree with what you said about the loss of Oz vs loss of Tara. I somehow could never really feel the pain of losing her as much as I felt the pain of Oz's betrayal (or Willow's) and Oz's leaving."
buffy,3307ej,catdoctor,3,Sun Apr 19 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, I never saw Oz as betraying Will. I don't see him making what's her name -I didn't like her enough to remember- go into the cage as betraying. I mean, he new she was going to go out and hurt/kill and wanted to prevent that. But that doesn't mean he went about it wisely, I thought he should have put her in a separate cage. Now when he wakes up, it looks like when his wolf side kicked in he had sex with her. If that's the case, I would blame it on his wolf side and the pure animal lust. I may be remembering wrong though, I think Oz might have started kissing her before transforming."
buffy,3307ej,theatreshark,2,Mon Apr 20 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"Well... I don't remember it perfectly either... but I think what put me off was also just that he made her feel that he had a part of himself that she would never be able to ""get"". And that hurt her."

buffy,32zro1,catdoctor,2,Sun Apr 19 12:03:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think Whedon would have anyone be saved in the Christian sense. His writing all makes it clear, even when he's writing about souls, Heaven and the supernatural, that he does not believe in capital-""G""-God or divine salvation. In Buffy, the soul is actually a metaphor for humanity. The soul contains a person's conscience, his/her empathy and all the emotions and thoughts that allow people to live together as social animals. Spike goes through a 3-season arc where he develops a desire to have a soul, seeks out the soul, acquires the soul and then has to learn to deal with his new soul. In the final episode it is this soul that activates the amulet, and through which the amulet's power is channeled. So, besides being a rather lame Deus-ex-machina, the destruction of the Hellmouth via Spike's soul is his ""graduation."" This is the moment when Spike is finally, indisputable fully ensouled, fully human, and completely redeemed. There are magical powers in play, but not any of the traditional Christian doctrine of salvation. To Whedon, salvation & redemption are things that are sought in the world of humans, here on Earth. He explores this theme much more deeply in ""Angel"" and the episode when this is most explicitly stated is in ""Reprise"" where MAJOR Angel spoiler"

buffy,32urtc,Enzown,14,Thu Apr 16 21:49:51 2015 UTC,It's not strictly canonical.  We see Angelus bite male victims and turn other males into vampires in both ATS and Buffy.  Vampires can have preferences though. Drusilla has shown a preference for children. It's also suggested that a younger person's blood might taste better than an older person's blood.
buffy,32urtc,AngelAmongUs,2,Thu Apr 16 22:25:48 2015 UTC,I don't recall Drusilla showing a preference for children. Can you remind me of when we learn this?
buffy,32urtc,heymeowmeow,3,Fri Apr 17 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"It's not something that is ever explicitly stated, and we do know that she feeds off adults as well.  In Buffy season two ""Lie to Me"" we see her targeting a child on a playground. It's possible to see him as a convenient victim, as the child was out after dark and vulnerable, but in Angel season five ""Destiny"" we see an indication that this may be a common practice.     Angelus: Yeah, she is a sweet plum. I mean, a bit dotty and brain-addled, but...  William: She's not-  She's just-  It's like she's still got a bit of a child in her.  Angelus: Perhaps 2 or 3 by now.   Driver! Stop the coach!   Happy hunting. Go on. Just be home before sunrise.      Drusilla: The little children didn't come out to play.   Did you miss me, pretty William?  Angelus: I'm sure he did, Dru. After all... you are his destiny.  Drusilla: Oh. That's so sweet.     Buffy season two  ""I Only Have Eyes for You""   Drusilla: Poor Angel...  (Now Angel grabs Dru.)  Angel: Let's get out of here. I need a really vile kill before sun-up to wipe this crap out of my system.  Drusilla: Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler.   In ATS season 3 ""Offspring""  it is suggested that a child's blood is purer. This purity and innocence may be what attracts Drusilla to them.    There may be a connection with her wanting to be good and pure before Angel destroyed her mentally. She then, as a vampire, ends up destroying the embodiment of those attributes that she held in such high regard as a human.   Cordelia: (cont'd) I almost forgot...  Angel: What did you see?  Cordelia: It wasn't like any vision I ever had before... the innocence... she's so hungry; she doesn't know how to make the hunger stop... I think I know where she's headed...  Wesley: Cordy, what is it, what was the vision trying to tell you?  Cordelia: I think it's trying to tell me why Darla's craving younger victims... we got a real problem on our hands.    Angel: The child, it has a heartbeat. And a soul.  Darla: Not my child --  Angel: Our child. That's why you've been craving purer and purer blood -- that's why it's been driving you out of your mind: it has a soul."

buffy,32urtc,heymeowmeow,6,Fri Apr 17 18:08:40 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not Buffy canon. :) I can think of multiple exceptions in both Buffy and Angel to the rule that ""vampires only bite people of the opposite sex.""  To give a pre-season 4 example, Angel bites Gage, the member of the swim team, in ""Go Fish,"" with the intention of turning him into a vampire.  It's not just Angel - we see this a few times with other vampires as well. For example, Spike while under control of the First in season 7, and Angel season 2 spoiler. We also see other vampires take same-sex victims, notably Dawn's vampire date in ""All the Way"" biting an old man, and Angel season 2 spoiler.  It seems that many of the random vampires we see in the show were sired to wreak havoc, and generally speaking, vampires seem to see males as better fighters.  That would be an in-universe explanation. :) I also think that the show just liked the idea and imagery of a petite blonde female taking on traditional (almost exclusively male) monsters and vampires and winning."
buffy,32urtc,GinaZaneburritos,5,Thu Apr 16 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"I also think that the show just liked the idea and imagery of a petite blonde female taking on traditional (almost exclusively male) monsters and vampires and winning.   That's very likely considering Joss' original inspiration for creating the show. :)   The first thing I ever thought of when I thought of Buffy, the movie, was the little...blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed, in every horror movie. The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea, that image, and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim. That element of surprise … genre-busting is very much at the heart of both the movie and the series."
buffy,32urtc,AngelAmongUs,2,Thu Apr 16 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"Also, in the ATS episode Why We Fight Angel sires a male, though it's worth noting that he does it out of necessity and not out of a desire to sire somebody. Also, Angel After the Fall Spoilers"

(""Grave"")  -Always cry at the end of ""The Gift."" The music and Buffy's speech are phenomenal.  -After Angel breaks up with Buffy and she goes to Willow and breaks down saying ""Right now, I'm just trying to keep from dying."" The way she cried was so real. (""The Prom"")  -""Surprise"" overall makes me cry a lot. When Angel gives Buffy the claddagh ring, when they are running holding hands in the rain together, etc etc.  -A LOT of season 6 episodes, mostly because of Buffy's mental state.

I'm just not a crier or even very emotional. I can't even think of all the episodes that made me cry, but one that people don't really mention is Once More, With Feeling, when Buffy reveals that they pulled her out of heaven, not a hell dimension. The look on Willow's face is what gets me for some reason."

buffy,32psgz,ventus,5,Wed Apr 15 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"Those are actually some good picks... though I have a hard time picturing Ramsay Snow as Xander. Personally I'd want to cast Enver Gjokaj for that part. Ever since seeing him in Dollhouse, I thought he'd make a great Xander.   I'm so used to seeing Iain as a fluffy nerd in Agents of SHIELD that I can't really picture him as Spike, but I wouldn't be surprised if he had the acting chops to pull it off."
buffy,32psgz,anarchistica,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"I actually thought about Enver for either Xander or Angel, but if this were a true reboot it would be a bit odd to see him running around a high school with Emma and Bonnie. I wanted to keep the ages relatively similar.  As for Iwan, I think he'd definitely pull off the sassy best friend type well. I considered Robbie Amell too (probably my runner up for Angel), but I think he's too conventionally attractive to be Xander. No offense to Nicholas Brendan or the character, but Xander is supposed to be the average boy-next-door type who always gets overlooked (""the zeppo""). I think Iwan has an odd quality that sort of lends itself to that.  And Iain thus far has proven himself (at least in my eyes) to be the most dynamic actor on AoS. Look at S1 Fitz for an example of how he might play Will, and his scene with Ward in S2 as something closer to Spike."
buffy,32psgz,ventus,2,Thu Apr 16 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"So you'd want them to cancel yet another Whedon series so Ian and Liz can play in your Buffy reboot? :P  Also, Ramsay as Xander? Oh boy... :D"
buffy,32psgz,nutbastard,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"Iain and Liz have terrific chemistry, and I think it'd be neat to see a type of role reversal between the two. Obviously in this ideal universe they'd somehow manage both shows haha.  And as for Iwan, ""Ramsey"" might make him seem like an odd choice but check him out in Misfits and you'll get a better idea of where I'm coming from with him."

buffy,32psgz,thatrez,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:26:17 2015 UTC,I like the thought process here.. It could work
buffy,32psgz,CJGibson,7,Thu Apr 16 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"I'd cast the showrunners and the project into the sea, that's what I would do.  :P    In all seriousness, I'd hire a reputable casting director and bring in loads of new young talent to audition. And I would audition ruthlessly, hoping to be surprised.  A lot of Buffy's success relies upon the earnest young energy and chemistry between the leads, who were largely unknown to the greater public before the show (Buffy was the first pilot SMG booked when moving to LA and she originally auditioned for Cordelia, it was Nicholas Brendon's first acting job, David Boreanez was brought in to read after he was spotted walking his dog, not because his agent submitted him for the part, etc. etc.)  If I already know of somebody and am 'casting' them off of pre-existing assumptions I currently have, then they probably wouldn't be the right people for the part.  The proper cast for a Buffy remake (if such a thing were to exist) would be actors who are out there right now, talented and hard-working, waiting to be discovered and given a chance to grow into these characters as they grow up with their exploits, NOT people I recognize from movie marquees or existing TV shows.       If I brought someone like Allison Jones in and had her put out the search for the best new talent to read for the parts, I'd have a hell of a lot better chance at getting the right people than by flipping through a mental checklist of actors I'm making certain assumptions about. She discovered the casts for Freaks & Geeks, The Office, and Parks & Recreation; she could discover me a suitable Buffy roster."
buffy,32psgz,thatrez,13,Wed Apr 15 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'd genderbend it.  Buffy - now Buddy - would be Chris Hemsworth  Willow - now Will - Would be Robert Downey Jr  Xander - now Xandress - would be Scarlett Johanson  Giles - now Gillian - would Colbie Smulders  and I'd let whedon direct it  I'd call it Buddy the Avenger Slayer"
buffy,32psgz,thatrez,8,Wed Apr 15 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"No reason not to go with Alexandra.  Also, I think instead of making Giles a lady, you should just cast Samuel L. Jackson for a bit more racial diversity."
buffy,32psgz,stevebaescemi,2,Wed Apr 15 20:19:45 2015 UTC,of course! what was I thinking
buffy,32psgz,Adido_net,3,Wed Apr 15 20:24:41 2015 UTC,we will just use Colbie for Spike
buffy,32psgz,stevebaescemi,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:25:37 2015 UTC,perfect.
buffy,32psgz,Adido_net,3,Wed Apr 15 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Funny that this should crop up! Back in January my friend and I were discussing the hypothetical 'were Buffy to be made today, who do we think would be cast?'. She made it into a graphic and posted it  Or to save clicking, these are the people we came up with:  Buffy - Abby Ross Angel - Paul Wesley * Giles - Jack Davenport * Xander - Brendan Robinson * Willow - Ciara Baxendale * Joyce - Elizabeth Mitchell Cordelia - Shay Mitchell* Oz - Olly Alexander * Spike - Jamie Campbell Bower * Drusilla - Kaya Scodelario Anya - Emma Roberts * Wesley - Tom Mison * Faith - Zoey Deutch *  Although having since watched Gallavant, I think that Luke Youngblood could make quite a good Xander. And Katie Findlay from HTGAWM could work as Faith  (asterisk denotes my contributions)"
buffy,32psgz,Adido_net,2,Wed Apr 15 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"Jamie Campbell Bower    I would never let spike be played by JCB - and not for lack of love-- I wouldn't kick him out of my bed or anything, but he's not quite right. something about him just really feels like the kind of 'acting cool' pseudo-poetic posers that spike tends to avoid. With James Marsters' portrayal it somehow didn't feel forced albeit literally being a persona he took on(In-universe)"
buffy,32psgz,stevebaescemi,2,Thu Apr 16 17:10:56 2015 UTC,We were on the fence a bit with him - we went with him more on a looks basis than acting because we were struggling to think of someone who'd be just as incredible as James Marsters!

Looks alone, regardless of acting ability, with the exception of the (relatively) short JRM who is 5'10 I think these actors could do a somewhat good job as spike- again- looks only  Jeremy Irvine Aneurin Barnard Jonathan Rhys Meyers"
buffy,32psgz,Adido_net,2,Thu Apr 16 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"Ooh - I could definitely see JRM as Spike (I thought he was pretty great in Dracula, no matter who odd that, show was at times). As for Aneurin... He doesn't really rock the platinum hair but if he played Spike anything like how he played David Bailey in We'll Take Manhattan it could be interesting. I'm not too sure about Jeremy Irvine though"

buffy,32psgz,tclovescheese,2,Wed Apr 15 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"I think Anna Kendrick would do pretty well as willow.  You need an English dude for Giles but if you went with an odd pick like Eddie Izzard for that role it could either be a brilliant idea or a farce, but he was pretty dead pan as grandpa in mockingbird lane so I think he could pull it off.  And Emma Watson (sans accent) I think could do Buffy justice. She would have to go blonde, but she has that mixture of prettiness and strength with just a touch of martyrdom that makes Buffy who she is.  No Jennifer Lawrence please... And Elle Fanning might give Dawn a new feel, something more than just shrill teen tantrums."

I mean, I know it happened in 1980, but why was it a cultural thing nearly ten years later?  A bit of googling tells me there were inquiries in '86 and '87; a movie based on the case came out in '88, and Seinfeld made a reference in '91. Seems like I read about the case in an urban legend-type book, as well. So I guess it was just kind of on everyone's mind? Weird."
buffy,32ozkg,lecherous_hump,6,Wed Apr 15 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"Well, Meryl Streep was nominated for an Oscar for playing the woman in 1988. It wasn't exactly a small story. ""The dingo ate my baby"" became kind of a catch phrase."
buffy,32ozkg,lightswitch_raver,4,Wed Apr 15 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember the catch phrase. I remember using it a few times myself. I was just pondering why it became such a thing. For those of us around the same age as the Scoobies (or older, or slightly younger), we didn't blink the first time we heard the band name, and probably thought something similar to, ""oh, haha, yeah, I remember that.""   It's just sort of fascinating to me how there are these news stories that are HUGE at the time, but then just kind of fade into obscurity, or aren't even a blip on the radar for younger generations."

It was all brought back up again three years ago. An inquest finally determined cause of death to be a dingo and had her death certificate altered.

buffy,32ozkg,wowyesokay,4,Sat Apr 18 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Uhh, since idk how to summon /u/autowikibot, here's the story overview:   Alice Lynne ""Lindy"" Murchison Chamberlain Creighton, usually known as Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton (born 4 March 1948) is a New Zealand-born Australian woman who was at the centre of one of Australia's most publicised murder trials. Originally accused and convicted of killing her nine-week-old daughter, Azaria, while camping at Uluru (then known as Ayers Rock) in 1980, she maintained that she saw a dingo leave the tent where Azaria slept on the night she disappeared. Eight years later, her conviction was overturned after the discovery of new evidence, and both she and her then-husband Michael Chamberlain were acquitted of all charges. . . .  As the result of a fourth inquest in 2012, an Australian coroner made a ruling that a dingo had indeed taken baby Azaria from the campsite in 1980 and had caused her death.   Full article on the case here."

buffy,32mv2m,AngryWizard,5,Wed Apr 15 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"I checked in with the mods to see if this post is appropriate but of course your votes will ultimately decide.  In a number of the /r/Buffy threads in which we suggest shows to watch after Buffy, other fans have suggested The Vampire Diaries and honestly at the time I didn't get it. I thought it sounded dumb so it took me a super long time to try out, it's on Netflix by the way. I am a huge Buffy fan and I recently got into TVD and I got tired very fast of people rolling their eyes at me.  Anyway, it's surprisingly similar! Obviously I still think that Buffy is superior but it has a lot of the same themes, a lot of the same moral issues, it prioritises season arcs rather than monsters of the week but the character journeys and growth are very reminiscent of Buffy. There's more to say than what is in the article but I didn't want to post spoilers. Oh and it's also different enough that the comparison does pop up but its not annoying.  I'd love to know what other Buffy fans think?"
buffy,32mv2m,coolbeaNs92,5,Wed Apr 15 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"I tried. I really gave it a fair shot; I watched the entire first season, then 3 more episodes of season 2. But alas, my boat it did not float.   Some shows can definitely resonate outside their target demographic, but I think I am just too far outside Vampire Diaries demo (too old). Buffy is able to resonate with me by way of its stellar dialogue and themes I can still relate to, making the teen drama of it all secondary to its overall wit and power.

buffy,32mv2m,Mquestionmark,5,Wed Apr 15 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"I very much agree with /u/AngryWizard on this one.   Because I grew up watching Buffy when I was 6, my whole life I've been obsessed with Vampires. They're my favourite genre of sci-fi and naturally, I'll watch/read any major series that involves Vampires/supernatural type elements.   I watched the first season and about half of the second season of TVD and it just wasn't for me. The writing didn't inspire me. There wasn't any real relatability in there for me, which Buffy has monumental amounts of, and I just stopped being interested in the show.  As for similarities, sure! I think every Vampire show after '96 has elements of Buffy in there, because it's the core blueprint of how to make it. I mean, Supernatural, TVD, Twilight, True Blood, Being Human and many more, all have BtVS themes in there.   Sorry, just not for me."
buffy,32mv2m,lightswitch_raver,3,Wed Apr 15 14:08:02 2015 UTC,"While I do guilt-watch Vampire Diaries on occasion (to stare at all the pretty people) I do think that TVD is a bit too vapid to suggest to Buffy-lovers. It's a Vampire Soap Opera, better than Dark Shadows, but not by much. I almost want to compare it to the terrible that is Twilight, but Ian Somerholder is a lot more attractive than the two male actors that star in Twilight (Cedric Diggory and an Emu). I think that the plot of TVD has gotten terribly convoluted and it seems to consistently repeat plot lines with minor tweaks. The writing has no humor or depth--making me pretty much the opposite of Buffy. Honestly, I would be embarrassed to attempt to convince anyone to watch TVD."
buffy,32mv2m,anarchistica,2,Wed Apr 15 17:57:56 2015 UTC,I think I would require more...convincing.

But (uh-oh, I have but-face), I was such a huge fan of the books back in the early '90s (to the point that I had chapters practically memorized), that I just can't get into the show. If I could manage to separate the books from the show, I could maybe get into it...but instead, I just keep thinking things like, ""Where the hell is Meredith?"" and ""Elena doesn't HAVE a brother!"""

And I think more could be added to the dialogue section too (maybe make it more broad than just Whedon's style, or an extension of that). Gilmore Girls maybe? The show itself is nothing like Buffy, but I think the dialogue has a similar feel. Fast, witty, little jokes that go completely unacknowledged, made up words, etc."

buffy,32bw1v,thetrooperim,5,Sun Apr 12 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone has mentioned this one yet, but Grimm might be a good one to add. The main character is a Grimm, which is someone who can see things that normal people can't and it's up to him to stop them...very similar to Buffy in that regard. Besides, a few people who work on Grimm worked on Buffy as writers, etc. Since you have The Vampire Diaries you should definitely add The Originals which is basically an Angel-esque spin-off. It's more mature and probably a little darker than TVD and it doesn't have a love triangle as it's core story.   Overall you've got a very good list going. I've seen most of the shows :D"
buffy,32bw1v,brewersfan412,3,Sun Apr 12 23:53:53 2015 UTC,I'd add Eureka in the Sci Fi portion.  For strong female leads...Scrubs maybe?
buffy,32bw1v,Novalee11,3,Sun Apr 12 16:20:39 2015 UTC,Being Human could be added to supernatural stuff.
buffy,32bw1v,GentleObsession,2,Sun Apr 12 20:12:25 2015 UTC,I would add in Lost Girl (supernatural/strong female characters) and CW's The 100
buffy,32bw1v,gypsiequeen,2,Mon Apr 13 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'd also recommend adding The 100 to the chart. Lots of strong female characters. You've got your warrior types, leadership types, smarty pants, ect. Basically all kinds of characters for both women and men. First few episodes are shit and will turn you off (everybody is pretty much unlikable at first) but it gets fairly good towards the end of the first season and gets all kinds of better in the second.   It certainly lacks the humour that Buffy has but there are some pretty interesting moral dilemmas that some Buffy fans may enjoy. Also lots of shades of grey on this show. The ""good"" guys do some bad things and the ""bad"" ones can surprise you. It also shares some similarities to Battlestar Galactica so you could place it near that on the chart. Just a suggestion.  Edit: Oh my god, I don't know how I forgot Xena but that should be on the chart too! Once again you've got strong female characters, good acting, fight scenes (though they are much sillier than Buffy), some good characters arcs (GREAT one in Gabrielle). They also had a musical episode like Buffy, though theirs was before Buffy's."

buffy,32bw1v,gypsiequeen,2,Tue Apr 14 20:20:25 2015 UTC,Yep. Battlestar Galactica is on the chart connected to Doctor Who and Torchwood.   I actually just finished The 100 last week so it's my new TV show to recommend. It's going to be a long wait till the third season...

buffy,32beb0,Mquestionmark,24,Sun Apr 12 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. The actor, Adam Busch, is in no way a creep. He plays in a folk group called Common Rotation and they are amazing. Check them out and buy all of their everything.  Common Rotation did a Living Room Tour about eight-nine years ago and they asked for hosts: I invited them to my parents' home and they put on a show in our living room. It was one of the coolest moments of my life. They used my bedroom as a green room and Adam praised my DVD collection. My mother was very ill at the time and could not watch the show, but when they heard that she was in the other room, Adam asked if it was alright to go in and sing her a song in private. He led the other two guys into her room and they sang her two songs by her bedside.  Whenever I attend one of their gigs, the guys in the band remember me and ask about my family. So, Warren = evil and creepy, Adam = awesome and kind."

I found him much more sympathetic and understandable than many other lesser villains, who seemed more ""standard"" - like Tucker in ""The Prom,"" or even Caleb to an extent.  I think Katrina's reaction in ""I Was Made to Love You"" was totally understandable. :) Buffy's I have a harder time with. Is he really supposed to treat the robot as a person? Buffy seems to reverse her position on that a few episodes later when the robot in question is ""herself.""  Overreacting to ""minor"" human foibles - particularly by insisting people deal with emotional sides of an issue when that's not really something they're prepared to engage with - is one of the things that drove Faith to the ""bad side,"" too.

buffy,32bysg,GinaZaneburritos,8,Tue Apr 14 02:39:05 2015 UTC,"The transcript of Joss Whedon's DVD commentary for this episode can be found here.  Normally I prefer the second part of Buffy two-parter episodes, but this is an exception. I think ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" is better done, and I find this episode a little disappointing.  There are a couple of things I like, though:   The scene where Darla and her gang advance on the Bronze. Cordelia's line about how she has to get the most expensive thing - ""not because it's expensive, but because it costs more."" That's a clever and legitimate distinction, I think. :) Jesse being able to ""get the girl"" as a vampire. Which Joss described like this:    And this is where we play a somewhat, perhaps obvious, but for us potent idea; which is basically that after Jesse has become a vampire he suddenly has some kind of charisma - no pun intended. Some kind of sexual magnetism and experience that makes him completely different than the dork he was five minutes ago. [...]  Again, that's just something that feels extremely real from high school experience, because that confidence, that knowing that you have something, is really a lot of what it took to become something more than the dork that we were. It's just that getting that confidence is nearly impossible. Jesse had to die to do it.   I like the way they do something similar with Xander in ""The Zeppo"" a few years later.  I also like the Cordelia/Harmony/Willow interaction in the computer lab. By the way, does anyone know what kind of programming they're doing? ""Pattern run"" and ""go to end"" sound like the awk programming language (maybe). In a later episode, Jenny Calendar is going over ""for/next loops,"" so I'm guessing that's ... BASIC?  On re-watching, Giles calling the Garden of Eden ""popular mythology"" does sound kind of like a jab at religion in general and Christianity in particular.  In general, I think this is an episode that showcases Xander's character and his development."
buffy,32bysg,The_Ripper42,3,Sun Apr 12 18:37:36 2015 UTC,I agree with this episode not being as good. Welcome to the Hellmouth did a good job of setting everything up but the payoff wasn't that exciting. And a supernatural show like this can't be expected to incorporate any religion into its own mythos. I feel like Buffy usually does a good job of not leaning too far one way or the other in terms of religion/Christianity.
buffy,32bysg,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sun Apr 12 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I agree about Buffy doing a pretty good job with respect to religion/Christianity. I don't have a problem with it. :)  It was actually the first time I really noticed it, and then Joss brought it up in the commentary:   I thought for sure we were going to get in a lot of trouble with this opening, where Giles says, ""Contrary to popular mythology, the world did not begin as a paradise"". That's pretty much a dig on Christianity, saying that there's more going on than people know about, and I thought people would object to that. I thought people would object to a lot of things that we were doing on this show. When you get into magic you get into a very edgy area for a lot of people. But I think people kind of respected its integrity. We never really offended too many people, at least not right away.   I forgot to mention another one of the lines that struck me this time, which was:   Luke: Their fear is elixir. It's almost like blood.   I feel this is a theme that comes up many times in the show. That instilling fear is almost as important as the actual killing and drinking of blood."

Same deal with military terminology in season 4. Most of the lines I heard are nonsense. It is endearing though :] Hell, it was the 90's.  I think Jenny was referencing an If-Then or an If-Then-Else statement that repeats when she was talking about loops. But it still doesn't make sense in context, because that is coding developer speak and they were simply running a search program.  I'm glad you mentioned religion! It's my personal opinion that BtVS alludes to religious themes quite often, but never really approaches the topic head on. For instance, Buffy wears a cross. Not for any declaration of faith, but rather, as a source of protection from vampires. I felt that Buffy, in the early seasons, shied away from any overt religious themes. The most influential one I can remember is the surprise snow storm in Sunnydale during ""Amends.""  Angel and the comics are not so shy: The Powers That Be (PTB y'all)  Joss, himself, is an atheist. But he liked to play around...   ""Was it God? Well, I’m an atheist, but it’s hard to ignore the idea of a 'Christmas miracle' here (though the PRAY on the marquee was an unintentional coincidence). The fact is, the Christian mythos has a powerful fascination to me, and it bleeds into my storytelling. Redemption, hope, purpose, Santa, these all are important to me, whether I believe in an afterlife or some universal structure or not. I certainly don’t mind a strictly Christian interpretation being placed on this episode by those who believe that – I just hope it’s not limited to that."" [15DEC98 ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" official posting board]     That's why I love Buffy. It explores the positive doctrines of religion, but also says that you can be good no matter what you believe.  It's kinda morbid, but as Angel said ""Nothing we do matters, so the only thing that matters is what we do.""  Edit: Does anyone else think Giles is atheist? I can't remember if he ever stated otherwise, but I get that vibe from him."
buffy,32bysg,The_Ripper42,2,Sun Apr 12 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"Giles seems like he wouldn't believe in any type of god that wasn't well documented in a non-religious way, i.e. The Bible."
buffy,32bysg,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sun Apr 12 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"I see him as more hard-agnostic, Buffy too. Xander Cordelia and Harmony seem like the kind who believe while they're sitting ina pew but ti kinda fades out after. Tara was the only truly devout person, and Riley was at least practicing."
buffy,32bysg,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"never really used IT terms properly   Really? The last time I was watching, I paid more attention to what was written on the blackboards, etc., and it all seemed possibly legitimate to me.   Even in ""The Harvest,"" they're writing programs. Programs involving searching are very common in introductory computer science classes, I think.  Rather than being specifically about awk programming, it also seems possible to me that ""pattern run"" could be the name of a function that was given to them, and they had to devise a program that used it. In which case, it could really be any language, although ""Go To End"" might really be ""goto end,"" in which case the possibilities narrow.  I had to check and see which episode it was that referenced for/next loops, and it's what's written on the board behind Jenny Calendar in ""The Dark Age."" I can't get a picture where it's at all visible, sadly, but I promise, it's during the Saturday class. :)  I noticed it because I had never heard of for/next loops before, and I thought I had a reasonable understanding of loops in languages like Java and C++. But apparently it is a real thing, especially in BASIC. :)  I'm getting pretty far off-topic from ""The Harvest,"" but I thought this thread about Jenny and her computer was pretty interesting. By the way, information about ""Data Recovery"" is what's written on the board during ""Passion,"" which seems a little too advanced ... but it's so appropriate that I'm willing to let that go. :)"
buffy,32bysg,DigitalBathRx,2,Mon Apr 13 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"Really?    Lol yup. Not on the same level as Scorpion or CSI, but they used IT terms (that are real) improperly. Not saying it happened all the time, but it happened enough for me to notice. Same with the military terminology. They used terms like soldier, Marine, and Agent interchangeably. Among other things that made me cringe lol.  ""Searching"" is a very vague term. Programs can complete a variety of functions ranging from a ""hello world"" statement (supah beginner level) to minor mathematical calculations (i.e. calculator) to java data structures (ugh gives me the heebies just thinkin' about it). What I meant here:   But it still doesn't make sense in context, because that is coding developer speak and they were simply running a search program.     is that they were actively searching for information on some demon, but discussing terms that are used when developing/writing said code. So, instead of discussing the operation of said process, they were discussing source code as if they were debugging. Loops are a real thing, but all it means is that you've designated a piece of code to repeat itself. So, yeah I see what you're saying. They were trying to develop a program to find the monster/demon/what have you... but they still used terms incorrectly because they were not in the debugging stage. And Willow often spouts out some made up shit in later seasons when Tara is around.  Since C++ or Java were just starting then, I'm assuming they're using COBOL, Visual Basic, or Python. Oh lawd.  Wow :] From religion to computer science. What a ride.

I agree, I tune out whatever Willow is saying about hacking and so on, because that does make no sense (nor would I really expect it to).  And Joss has said he doesn't really know much about military terminology either, having had to ask around to figure out what Xander should say when he's breaking in to steal the rocket launcher. :)"
buffy,32bysg,DigitalBathRx,2,Mon Apr 13 00:36:42 2015 UTC,It makes you wonder... how difficult would it have been to consult a military expert? I guess those are just little things though. I'm sure he had plenty else to worry about.

Or Spike kind of slowly turning into a future fruit punch mouth type.   edit: or, I forgot, perhaps use their soul as an excuse. Their souls are possibly ""wearing down"" on their bodies from the inside causing some human-like aging. Whereas the other vampires do not age because their soul isn't present or affecting them.   I doubt they will reprise their roles because I've seen enough interviews to know James Marsters doesn't want an aged looking spike, and David isn't exactly struggling to find work right now."

buffy,322vau,AngryWizard,4,Fri Apr 10 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"From watching other actors, it seems very difficult to laugh naturally and convincingly, but Tony does it perfectly and it seems so genuine.   I agree, although ""Harmony has minions?"" has to be one of the best and most convincing laughs I've ever seen. :P"
buffy,322vau,GinaZaneburritos,7,Fri Apr 10 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I have to respectfully disagree. For me personally, there was one laugh that SMG got right though. The one during a dreamy sequence where she breaks as she's looking at the pocket watch. It was impressive how real that one seemed when compared to others like the 'harmony has minions' laugh and the 'I've been sleeping with Spike' laugh. It's interesting how you and I see those completely differently though; I actually get second hand embarrassed for SMG during the one you linked because it comes off so forced and unnatural to me, which is what first prompted my 'laughing must be quite difficult for actors' theory. Upvote anyway for sharing!"
buffy,322vau,AngryWizard,6,Fri Apr 10 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that one seeming really forced. It's not quite to the second hand embarrassment point for me, but more like an internal groan."
buffy,322vau,heymeowmeow,3,Fri Apr 10 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's not super hard for me to suffer second-hand embarrassment; watching the UK version of The Office, for example, was incredibly torturous for me. BtVS has several spots where I get uncomfortable/embarrassed - ""no one defeats the penis"" comes immediately to mind, and several of Amber Benson's line deliveries."
buffy,322vau,AngryWizard,2,Sat Apr 11 00:21:31 2015 UTC,"Funny that you pick that laugh specifically!! I remember Joss Whedon saying in a commentary (I think it was.. though I might have heard/read it somewhere else) that for that laugh he was making weird faces behind the camera to make SMG laugh unexpectedly - it was not in the script. He thought it would add value to the weird dream sequence aspect (correctly, imo)"
buffy,322vau,NJ008,2,Mon Apr 13 11:34:15 2015 UTC,"Oh the pocket watch laugh? If so that makes sense, it's so natural."

It's an emotional roller coaster that is sometimes difficult to slog through, but afterwards you feel great about watching it.

buffy,31ztno,Rubberxsoul,20,Thu Apr 9 13:19:18 2015 UTC,"Joss Whedon ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" DVD Commentary    As you can see the make-up, very white-faced, very creepy, very ghoulish. But we sort of backed off from that in later seasons to make it a little more human. Partially because of Angel, and partially because that much body make-up took a long time, and some people felt the white was a little funny-looking. I actually find it somewhat creepier. More ‘Day of the Dead’, more ‘Evil Dead’ than the later vampires we’ve had.  Our first dusting coming up. I like the way he explodes into dust there. That’s something we’ve worked on and perfected over the years as well. That was also a very conscious decision that they would turn into dust, clothes and all – because I didn’t think it would be fun to have fifteen minutes of “Let’s clean up the bodies” after every episode.  Part of this has to be hidden. People can’t know that there are vampires everywhere. We get away with a lot of that by saying that people just won’t admit it to themselves."
buffy,31ztno,AngelAmongUs,2,Thu Apr 9 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"That goulish comment is quite interesting, because vamps in season one often act quite zombieish (slowly pursuing heroes, acting with very little personality), something the show will have excised come season 2."
buffy,31ztno,thakil,8,Fri Apr 10 07:44:56 2015 UTC,"DVD commentary like rawkfemme said (s01e01 maybe), I thought the vamp-faces were to distinguish between killing vampires and humans though? And dusting was more a practicality, so they didn't have to take care of all the dead bodies. It probably doesn't really matter I guess"
buffy,31ztno,sunshine3000,4,Thu Apr 9 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"And dusting was more a practicality   I thought there was also a real life practical element, in that the dusting effect was pretty cheap and easy to do."
buffy,31ztno,CJGibson,7,Thu Apr 9 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"The CGI itself wasn't cheap, I can't remember the exact figure Joss said but it was a lot of money everytime they showed a vamp get dusted. Although I guess doing the camera trick of having them die off-screen and playing the sound is certainly a lot cheaper."
buffy,31ztno,TheDeadManWalks,3,Thu Apr 9 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"It might have been cheap at first, but the more advanced effect they were using in the later seasons of Buffy and Angel (I think it's around B4, A2) was roughly $5,000 a use."
buffy,31ztno,Sammyboy616,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:09:32 2015 UTC,actually the dusting effect was pretty expensive relative to buffys budget
buffy,31ztno,faaackksake,4,Sun Apr 12 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"From http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage18/McLaren.htm  Vampires explode into dust because [. . .] it shows that they’re monsters. I didn’t really want to have a high school girl killing people every week” (Whedon, “Joss Whedon on ‘Angel’ and ‘Puppet Show’”).  So you could pull up the commentaries for those two episodes to verify that and find the full unedited quote. I'm on my phone so that's the best I can do at the moment."

buffy,31x4fm,PeterFnet,2,Wed Apr 8 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Very interesting question. I would imagine that after the events of The Gift, she would just become a vampire like anyone else. As for before The Gift, who knows? I kinda think it wouldn't work. She couldn't transform into a vampire. My thoughts are that first and foremost she was the key at that point which can't be impure so I imagine something would stop her from being impure rather than something impure stopping her from being the key anymore.   On a similar note, is there any word on what happens if a Slayer gets sired?"
buffy,31x4fm,heymeowmeow,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Being that the Key was given form to be protected by a Slayer, giving it the form of a vampire would be counter-productive. Because Spike was sired almost a century before Buffy was born, he couldn't be the Key.  If Dawn were to be sired after her creation, she would still be the Key - but bleeding her may have been a bit harder seeing as vampires don't have heartbeats!"

buffy,31u32k,anandamidetrip,23,Wed Apr 8 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"There are a LOT of ""Top 100 tv shows of all time"" lists out there, many written within the last couple of years, that have Buffy in the top 10.  When they hit you with the ""vapid-teeny drama"" comment, show them the lists and ask what other ""vapid-teeny dramas"" they can find consistently on a list like that.  If that doesn't work, tell the ones that love Supernatural that Buffy is basically a younger, female Dean and they need to watch the first 2 seasons to check it out. I love Spike an Buffy together because I think they made each other grow up in many different ways, and grow into better people, too.  I think the writers still held on to the idea of Angel and Buffy being end-game so much that they never let Spike and Buffy's relationship grow into what it could have been.  Spike's speech to Buffy after she was kicked out in Season 7 proves beyond any doubt that he truly loved her.  And I believe that Buffy's ""I love you"" at the end of the last episode was heartfelt, even if it wasn't completely true, soul shattering love yet. Faith was truly interesting as the ""dark side"" of what a slayer could be.  They did a fantastic job of showing her downfall into letting her power corrupt her, and an even better job of showing how The Mayor fulfilled a side to her that no one on the good side ever did.  If you don't watch any other parts of Angel, you should at least catch the episodes where Faith is on there, because if you love Faith you'll love those episodes.  Beyond that, I don't think there was much else of her story to tell on Buffy except that she came back reformed and learned about how to be a leader and work with a group.     I'm a happy ending person, so I prefer Chosen.  I appreciate the idea of Buffy sacrificing herself for Dawn and the world, absolutely.  I just prefer the idea that by bucking the original system of ""one girl in all the world"", Buffy created a strong group of friends that changed everything for the world instead - and she gets to go on and bake and become cookies. I love all of season 2, but I have so many individual episodes that I love in all of the seasons that I can't really pick one.   Sorry that this is so long, but I really enjoy talking to a new Buffy fan.  I've enjoyed it since in came on tv, and I love that there are new fans coming in every day."
buffy,31u32k,kayjee17,6,Wed Apr 8 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"That'll definitely help. I'm a little surprised the series is so high, considering its unconventional subject and feel, but I believe it deserves its rank. My one friend who loved the show watched a few episodes from season 3 so I'll probably start there. I love Spike & Buffy together too. Their encounters in the last few episodes are what I wish they would have reached earlier in the season. I found it annoying that Spike kept creeping on Buffy in season 5 and unbelievable she wouldn't stake him. Buffy kept beating herself up over Spike and especially in front of him. I found this over-the-top and annoying really. I accepted they would be together because I knew about it ahead of time, so waiting around for it felt monotonous. Yeah not much there to explore. I just really enjoyed Faith's dynamic with the gang. Chosen was amazing. The last 4 episodes or so were like watching an action movie. But The Gift just feels like another great, alternative ending to the show. In fact most season finales seem to go this way. I love season 2's big bad, not so much as a whole, but still outstanding."

Although Buffy is not my favorite character, she is my favorite slayer.    Is it Faith's background that drew you to her? If so, read the comics!"
buffy,31u32k,kayjee17,6,Wed Apr 8 05:13:35 2015 UTC,"Buffy is my favorite slayer.  I was just speaking to OP's love of Faith and how Joss has always described her as the darker aspect of being a slayer.  I also really, really love when she is on Angel after leaving Sunnydale and what happens when they finally confront each other.  I haven't read any of the Faith comics yet, but I'll have to look into them now.  My budget is limited, so I haven't even finished getting through Season 8 of Buffy in the comics, but I'm still working on it, thanks."
buffy,31u32k,yanginatep,2,Wed Apr 8 05:32:08 2015 UTC,She's just blunt and funny. I enjoyed her personality; it clashes well with the scoobies - which I think was Joss' intentions since she's the polar opposite of Buffy. I'll definitely check out the comics.
buffy,31u32k,truly_madly_deeply,10,Thu Apr 9 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'll add my voice to those saying you should really give Angel another chance, especially if you like Faith.

buffy,31u32k,Sassafrass23,2,Wed Apr 8 13:36:08 2015 UTC,The Pylea story line at the end of Season 2 is one of my favorites. You'll get to see Joss dance!

buffy,31u32k,yanginatep,3,Wed Apr 8 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"It was!   Numfar, do the dance of joy!"
buffy,31u32k,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Apr 8 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"It moves away from the detective format of season one fairly quickly.  One of the things I love about the series is that it's one long story. The events of the season one finale are part of a chain that runs through the entire series.  I find the series complements Buffy really well. Buffy is about facing the demons of adolescence, Angel is about being an adult. As a result Angel gets way darker at times, but I felt that a lot of the themes and messages were more mature, more relevant to my life now.  I'd say definitely stick it out till you're at least a little bit into season two, which along with three is my favorite."
buffy,31u32k,feminaprovita,2,Wed Apr 8 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a Season one thing that will not continue (re: feeling like mystical CSI). Season two takes a much darker, less episodic turn. It becomes much more about the long haul plot and much less monster of the week-y."

buffy,31u32k,underthemilkyway,2,Thu Apr 9 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"Are there any episodes from the 1st season I can skip completely? A lot of the characters seemed to be kind of throw-away considering Kate and Doyle, so it makes it harder for me to get invested."
buffy,31u32k,truly_madly_deeply,2,Thu Apr 9 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"""She"" is probably the worst episode in the first season. I think it's episode 13.  Kate develops into much more than a throwaway character, though.  See the thing about Angel is that ALL of the characters develop and change, I'd say moreso than in Buffy.  I hated Wesley in Buffy, and he's still pretty annoying in the first season of Angel. But he actually becomes my favorite character in the entire Buffyverse by the end of Angel. His character arc is amazing.  Similarly I'm still baffled how they took Cordelia, a relatively shallow character, and developed her into a multifaceted character I genuinely really care about throughout the show's run."

buffy,31u32k,DISNEYJ3DI,14,Wed Apr 8 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"I've also just finished watching it and loved it. I feel like I'm slightly unusual in this opinion but I loved season 6 - it was season 6 that got me really hooked. It wasn't just the Spike/Buffy relationship, which I thought was great character development (though it definitely was not necessary to have James Marsters completely naked for the majority of the season - I felt quite sorry for him at times!). I also loved the fact that the 'big bad' was three boys who showed how evil humanity could be - the moment where Katrina shouts at them that what they were doing was rape was really interesting - it blew their fantasy world apart and showed starkly how misogynistic and cruel they were. I thought it was important to have that human element -Buffy had always fought demons but this was one of the first times she'd had to fight human evil and I thought that was really interesting."
buffy,31u32k,soyrobo,8,Wed Apr 8 08:42:55 2015 UTC,"Season 6 really showed how the real world is just as terrifying without throwing monsters into the mix. I always found it interesting that Jonathan was a member of the trio. Jonathan and his magic bone. It really shows how much loneliness and wanting to belong can lead people into destructive decisions.  The Trio are still my favorite villains as a deconstruction of the mad scientist trope. That and as a geeky and socially uncomfortable guy, I can identify with them on a more human level."

buffy,31u32k,sarah_bellum75,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:28:39 2015 UTC,"I found it kind of awkward how often they had Spike half-naked in that season hahaha. I'm honestly surprised on how much people like season 6. I started out knowing that Spike/Buffy and Willow/Tara relationships are developed, that the big bad's were the Trio/Dark Willow, and that the general tone is overbearingly depressing. All of this had me really pumped for the season, but I found it so boring, one-note, and emotionally flat. It was the only season finale I didn't care for. I love Tara but I barely even remember her in that season... It's interesting seeing the other side of the coin though. I can see why you loved it; I wonder if maybe my expectations had a big role in why I was disappointed."
buffy,31u32k,meagan51422,9,Thu Apr 9 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that the ride is hardly over. You owe it to yourself to at least watch Angel (five seasons), and try the ongoing comics (three more seasons of Buffy, 1.5ish of Angel, two seasons of Angel & Faith, and several smaller runs). All canon, with overlapping creative teams. You're not even halfway through the Buffyverse yet!"
buffy,31u32k,ereag,9,Wed Apr 8 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"I started watching Angel but after 10 episodes I couldn't really get into it. I know it gets better as it goes but for me it was no Buffy. And I've heard a lot of mixed things about the comics. Even seeing people say that it ruined Buffy for them. I doubt that'll be the case for me, especially since people say season 7 is awful and I liked it for a lot of different reasons. I just have a lot going on and honestly I'd rather rewatch these amazing episodes! Buffy has becomes my favorite show, its hard to let go."
buffy,31u32k,LaunchpadMacQ,10,Wed Apr 8 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"Please keep trying with Angel, it starts off a little weak but once you get into season 2 im sure youll like it :)"
buffy,31u32k,LaunchpadMacQ,13,Wed Apr 8 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes! You haven't met Fred yet! Please give it another chance, she's my favorite."
buffy,31u32k,BuffyRules3000,3,Wed Apr 8 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"It seems we have similar tastes so I will go ahead and tell you what I discovered years ago. After holding out for a long while, I decided to give Angel a shot three years ago after hearing for years how great the show was, some even claiming it better than Buffy. I finished the show the whole way through and here's my honest verdict: It's nothing to write home about. If you're looking to fill in missing piecing to the buffyverse, this is hardly the place to look as it mostly has nothing to do with Buffy. The characters were lacking, yes, even the beloved Fred. The show couldn't even hold my attention for more than half a season with the most iconic character arc of the show. She did end on a high note with me but it hardly makes up for the seasons where I just didn't care about her. It was interesting to find out where my beloved Buffy characters ended up but there was something jarring about seeing them in a different show that was completely different than the one you loved, I'm talking about you Spike. I also wasn't into the whole series being about defeating an evil law firm. I like my big bads of the season a lot more than one dragging out five seasons. The plot also just gets straight up weird in the fourth season (whichever one Connor was a douche in). The one good thing I can say about the show was Wesley, I liked him in Buffy but I liked him more in Angel.  All in all, I didn't feel emotionally attached to these characters and the plot was shaky at best. Not to say that I NEVER cared about a particular character, it just wasn't lasting.  I guess it didn't help that I was never a fan of the character Angel though so maybe that's why I never clicked with the show.  Try the show because it's worth finishing to the end. This might be an unpopular opinion in this sub but it's my honest one. I can openly admit that it's far from bad tv, just not my kind of show I guess."
buffy,31u32k,bionut876,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely give it another shot, regardless of whether I like it or not. Season 6 was probably my least favorite season of Buffy but I never felt like it was a chore to watch, so I imagine I'll feel the same on Angel. Thank you for your opinion!"
buffy,31u32k,srauf456,4,Thu Apr 9 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"My honest opinion about Angel is that it's boring, but I can't imagine not watching it. Angel has a very slow start, as you've figured out, but it does pick up a little bit. The spinoff made me love Cordelia and Wesley even more, I adored Lorne and Doyle, and I also became attached to Fred (although it took a season or 2 of her). You might not feel the need to watch it, but I think it's worth a shot. Also, there's a Joss cameo, just saying!"
buffy,31u32k,coolbeaNs92,3,Wed Apr 8 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can, honestly. For some reason, it's tougher for some people to swallow certain shows. I've had this problem with The Good Wife for many years; it's such a fantastic show, yet people are put off by the title, the lead, the premise, etc. Buffy is basically in a similar way because it's a female lead and it was originally intended for a teenage female demographic, when in reality in expands well beyond that. Getting people to see it is tough, though. I liked the Spike-Buffy relationship. It felt like a consequence and natural occurrence of the things that happened to these characters. Sure, Spike felt a little silly at times, like with the chip and suddenly realizing he's in love, but on the whole it felt as off-putting as it was meant to be. I enjoyed it on the whole. I didn't care too much for Faith; actually, I didn't like her at all when she first appeared. She grew on me though, more on Angel than on Buffy. Her best moments were on the other show. Chosen was the better series ending. I don't think there needed to be a definite finality to Buffy's tale like with other characters on other shows, especially when this universe had expanded (and continues to expand through comics) so much by the time the show had ended. I thought the ending was awesome as it was. Plus, if The Gift had been the ending proper, we wouldn't have had Buffy's season 6 struggles, which for me were the most compelling. I think I liked the last three seasons equally for different reasons. I enjoyed the grounded nature of Buffy's mom's ongoing health problems; I enjoyed Buffy's resurrection, the Spike-Buffy relationship, Willow's struggles with magic; and I liked Caleb and the whole scope of season 7.   I saw from what you wrote in a comment that you tried out Angel, but I really implore you to continue on. It's a bit rocky to start with, and it hits some definite low points throughout its run, but the payoff is worth it. The back-half of season 1 is when things really get better. You're going to hear a lot of different opinions about Angel (and Buffy, actually, if my bullets above are any evidence). However, that doesn't change its strengths, chief among them its stellar cast. It has my two favorite Buffyverse characters, and it eventually features Spike as well. Despite the ups and downs of the first 4 seasons, season 5 is masterclass. It's my favorite piece of the Buffyverse taken on its own, but unfortunately the development of certain characters throughout it is a requirement to get the most out of it.   My advice is to go in expecting to like some things and not all of it. The development of its characters - Wesley, Fred, Cordelia, Lorne, hell even Angel becomes likable eventually - totally make it worth slogging through some of the slower bits."
buffy,31u32k,socialpronk,2,Wed Apr 8 14:26:44 2015 UTC,"After reading about The Good Wife, it really doesn't sound too appealing haha. Maybe it's just another show I'll have to be open-minded about like Buffy. I thought the chip was a really smart move from the writers actually, but Spike all the sudden falling for Buffy seemed just...weird. I still enjoyed their relationship though. Curious, what didn't you like about her? I loved her from the get-go. I loved the last few seasons too! Especially season 5! Watching them grow up and become adults was ultimately where the show was going to go. And I prefer serious Buffy over cheesy Buffy so the last 3 seasons were all the more appealing to me.   I will definitely give Angel another chance. I'm just having trouble getting into it because of its slow pace, its serial detective feel (I prefer season arcs over MOTW's) and Cordelia/Angel are not my favorite characters (especially Angel). Is there a certain episode/season where you think it starts to really pick up?"

There's either too few tiles or too short a runtime for this to be ""all episodes at the same time.""  The clips don't seem to be significantly sped up.    EDIT ah, I miscounted the line that transitions from the smallest frame size to the next smallest frame size.  There are closer to the correct number of tiles. Still doesn't contain all the footage by runtime, though. And one of the small tiles on the far left is consistently playing the same episode as one of the large tiles on the far right (even though the episode itself changes). Hmm."

He always has interesting insights into the episodes that I haven't thought of before and manages to point out character arcs without being spoilery.  My only gripe is now that he brought up the ""Three's Company"" theme relating to this episode, I'll always hear it when I watch this episode.  And since the guy who played Ted was trying to get into the pants of both his roommates, it is pretty kinky here."
buffy,31s51g,kayjee17,3,Wed Apr 8 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"I always enjoy reading/watching analyses of Buffy episodes. :) The ones for ""Halloween"" and ""Lie to Me"" I thought were particularly well done.  What is called here the ""Cassandra trope"" didn't really bother me during this episode. People tend to dismiss Buffy at varying points throughout the series, but I always find it more or less understandable. Xander also in a few episodes early on hits on the ""real"" truth of what's going on (""Earshot"" and ""Him,"" for example), but because it's phrased as a joke, no one listens to him.  Spells and potions are powerful things in the Buffyverse, and they frequently radically alter someone's behavior without them being aware that anything different is going on. Love spells, for example, as well as Buffy's loss of a soul in ""Living Conditions."" The drugs given to Riley in season 4. Willow casting a spell on Tara so that she forgets their fight. In this context, the fact that Ted is able to strip away Buffy's support system is not unbelievable to me.  I should maybe say that I actually really like this episode. :) Not only for the themes of power and responsibility, but also for the way Buffy deals with her jealousy. She's so resistant to change, using Giles and Angel both as sounding boards, and although she didn't actually murder anyone and her mom doesn't actually have a boyfriend, I think she's learned by the end that she's not always right. And how she deals with her (very human) emotions is a major theme in this season, I think."
buffy,31s51g,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Apr 9 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this is one of the few episodes I usually skip on a rewatch. It wasn't a terrible episode, but certainly no need to see it more than once."
buffy,31s51g,JangoF76,3,Tue Apr 7 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a frustrating episode, but as discussed in the video essay, it raised some interesting questions and implications (which are worth exploring even if the episode doesn't explore them).  A lot of this stuff is way better handled when they return to the subject of slaying a human in season 3."
buffy,31s51g,JimmyMac80,3,Tue Apr 7 22:14:22 2015 UTC,"I liked the video, though the fact that it doesn't mention the numerous other times that Buffy is ignored seems a little odd.  It happens at least once a season, the two times that immediately come to my mind are Cathy being a demon and that The First was guarding something at the vineyard.    I also think he missed an opportunity to compare the differences between Faith killing the Mayor's aid and Buffy ""killing"" Ted.  Especially given the fact that he complains about Ted's death not having a lasting impact.  Though that might have set up a comparison that would have taken more time than he wanted to spend on one video."
buffy,31s51g,magickmidget,3,Tue Apr 7 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that particular comparison with Faith's murder(s) comes retrospectively when TPN gets to Bad Girls. I think perhaps because it's such a huge part of the season three arc and involves some pretty deep comparison of Buffy and Faith, it's a topic perhaps better left for later when the focus is on Faith and not Buffy, as is the case in Ted. That said, I would've at least liked a shot of Faith given the shots of Spike and Riley from much later in the series."
buffy,31s51g,johnluckpickerd,2,Wed Apr 8 01:05:50 2015 UTC,I will definitely cover it when we get there. Weirdly a shot of Riley didn't feel as spoilery as a shot of Faith in this vid. Strange bias.
buffy,31s51g,magickmidget,2,Wed Apr 8 06:59:24 2015 UTC,"I can understand that - even if you've never watched Buffy, the mere existence of Angel the series implies that he and Buffy didn't work out (for the time being!) so Riley himself isn't particularly spoilery."
buffy,31s51g,barre_chord_reality,3,Wed Apr 8 09:04:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the TPN episode guides are designed as a watch-a-long meant to be largely ""spoiler free,"" so he refrains from discussing things that haven't happened yet in the series so far (in case people haven't watched the show until now).  Hence why he alluded to Faith, but didn't talk directly about her and didn't discuss Cassandra Truth examples beyond season 2."

What if someone else's heart got broken in the wish, and Anya granted a different apocalypse. Would the Scoobies stop it. Likely, no. I think we can all sort of agree, no Xander = death by apocalypse somewhere. I liked the idea of it ending in Season 6 though because to me, that is Xander's most heroic moment."
buffy,31pw82,osburnn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"Anya doesn't tell them exactly what an ascension is, but they had clues.  Plus the mayor murders that archaeologist which provided a key clue (lots of fire helps).  We'll still need Xander's soldier info for getting the rocket launcher, but that can be handled by Jesse going GI Joe on Halloween."
buffy,31pw82,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"anya, iirc (and it' been a couple years since i did a full rewatch) gave them the key clue to contextualize WHY the volcanologist's death was important, before that they were floundering."

buffy,31pw82,I_am_TheZeppo,16,Fri Apr 10 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe Jesse would not become a Scoobie at all.  As you pointed out he was interested in Cordelia, not Buffy, so he had less reason to stick with the slayer.   Jesse was not as close with Willow as Xander was, or at least she didn't seem too upset about his death, so that would have been also a reason less for him to join the Scoobies."
buffy,31pw82,kaekit36,4,Tue Apr 7 10:38:11 2015 UTC,"I can see this, but I think Xander's death alone would be reason enough for him to get involved. He was part of the group, and I think the death of his friend would make him care about fighting demons and such. Also, if Jesse never became a Scoobie, this whole thing becomes more complicated, haha. Thanks for the feedback"
buffy,31pw82,IntoTheTimeEgg,4,Tue Apr 7 14:40:26 2015 UTC,Either that or he would alienate himself from the group as a means to avoid getting mixed up in the stuff that got his best friend killed. It's really a coin toss on that one.
buffy,31pw82,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Apr 7 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"I think this is possible too. However, based on what I have seen in two episodes, Jesse didn't appear to have many friends outside of the group. So, alienating himself from them would be to alienate himself from all of his friends. One could say that Xander may have alienated himself as well after Jesse's death. I went with what I had to work with, and I believe he would join the group."
buffy,31pw82,kaellynn,16,Tue Apr 7 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"The lack of long term effect of Jesse's death is something I found disappointing when re-watching.  They just forget about him.  I did hear that Joss wanted him back for Conversations with Dead People, and that would have been amazing."
buffy,31pw82,purplenat,6,Tue Apr 7 11:42:47 2015 UTC,"It certainly would have given me more material to work with. But I agree with both points. I like conversations with Dead People, but I think it would have been better with Tara and Jessie. There would have been so much emotion. I understand that it would a been hard for Jessie to come back, and Amber Benson thought it wouldn't be good for her character, but this is the first. It can be every dead person ever. Why wouldn't it be people that matter to them. Also, a Jesse return would have probably had him raise the question, ""Why did no one care about my death?"" Which would have been interesting."
buffy,31pw82,Enzown,4,Tue Apr 7 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"Wow that would have been. I think Jesse is around in terms of how his death affected Xander and his hatred for vampires (jealousy is not the only reason he doesn't care much for Angel) but he really isn't mentioned much again, which is definitely strange and disappointing."
buffy,31pw82,DementedJ23,7,Tue Apr 7 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"I love this stuff. This is what I subscribed for. :D Thanks!  So, of course there's way too much to consider since butterfly effect and all but you made some really good points! As a Willow fan I thought of two other things I'd be interested in:   Would Oz leave without Xander (disregarding that Seth Green had to leave of course)? I mean without the troubles they had with the cheating, maybe their relationship would have matured more and be more stable, so later on they would try to work it out together. But then again, how would Willow have turned out with Xander, best friend and love interest dying, so early on? Maybe she would have been more mature, maybe a bit cold hearted? I don't think it would be comparable to the loss of Tara with the Dark Willow arch though. Building on that: If Tara would come into play regardless, or alternatively if Oz was still with Willow and he died in season 6 instead of Tara, would Dark Willow come to be? Willow was probably hardened by the death of Xander in her teens. So the apocalypse would maybe just not happen.   This is all leaving out the fact that Jesse exists! Who knows? Maybe Jesse would step up and do who-knows-what.  Sorry, very Willow-centric and not refined because I just wrote it directly after reading. But I'd love to hear your thoughts about it.  Best wishes!"
buffy,31pw82,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Apr 7 10:25:36 2015 UTC,"Excellent points, and for the case of these, I have to ignore Butterfly effect stuff because otherwise it could just become too confusing. Let's start. 1.) I put a lot of thought into Oz, but I left him out for a few reasons. Yes, Willow would have not cheated on Oz, that's true, but they got through that. The issue started with oz and Veruca. Oz did not understand his abilities and left. In that time, Willow discovered that she was a lesbian. Then Oz returns, and she picks Tara. I don't think this changes with or without Xander. Willow is a lesbian. I don't doubt she loved Oz, or even Xander, but in the end, she feels an attraction to women. I also left out how this would effect the personality of the characters because I felt that the characters would have to be who they are. If I change how everyone is (I.e. more cold-hearted) I have to look at every episode and analyze their decisions. It may have made her react different, but it may not have. After all, she dealt with death before (i.e. Jesse, Joyce). I placed Jesse in LA with Cordy, putting LA in a whirlwind. It had an easy way of doing the story, since they did Cordy as the actress on Angel. It made sense that he would be with Cordelia since it happened with Xander."
buffy,31pw82,DementedJ23,9,Tue Apr 7 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Ok so I wanted to add my own in put on this because it actually is an interesting idea.  The first change I would make is Xander getting dusted.  I don't think it would happen.  Only because Jesse being dusted was a fluke, Jesse being infatuated with Cordelia at the time would have tried to protect her instead of going after Xander.  So in my alternate reality Xander would be vamped indefinitely.    Now, Willow being attracted to Xander at the time, would have been more susceptible to being manipulated by Vamp Xander.  Willow gets turned.  Buffy after losing her 2 new friends gets angry and kills Darla, stops the harvest and unfortunately has to dust Vamp Willow and Vamp Xander.    Jesse becomes angry at the death of his 2 closest friends and becomes a vampire hunter more inspired than Xander ever could have been.  He goes with Buffy to face the Master and is able to resuscitate her.  Season 2 plays out incredibly differently.  Willow's death results in the group not meeting Jenny Calendar, Buffy still falls for Angel, Angel loses his soul but without Willow or Jenny Calendar there is no means to ensoul him again.  Jesse gets targeted by Angelus instead of Giles and takes the beating that Giles got in that warehouse putting him in the hospital instead of Willow.   To save the world and no other foreseeable options, Buffy actually kills Angelus, not Maiming him and sending him into that Hell dimension.   Buffy still leaves Sunnydale after the death of Angel, but when she returns she finds that Jesse and Giles have taken up the mantle patrolling Sunnydale.    Without Willow being around to need those ingredients for a ""De-Lusting Spell"" that one night, Spike's second encounter never happens.  Jesse would have eventually ended up with Cordelia and she would have become an actual functioning member of the Scoobies and more permanent of one because without the Willow and Xander cheating incident, she would have never left Sunnydale (in my opinion).    Oz joins the scoobies because things start taking on more of a Wishverse scenario.  Also unfortunately they wouldn't even be called the Scoobies because I think it was Willow who came up with the name.    Angel would have come back to life because The Powers That Be need their spinoff. And things would have gotten weird from their ending in season 5 when Buffy sacrifices herself.  With no Willow to resurrect her, the series ends.    Tragic."
buffy,31pw82,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Apr 7 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"I like this scenario!  Couple extra thoughts to spice this one up even more...  What if Vamp Xander actually stays ""alive"" for longer, and becomes a recurring villain with this scenario?  Maybe Spike takes him under his wing and he starts becoming fairly competent as a vampire.  Spike, Drusilla, and Xander go off and travel but always return to Sunnydale to taunt the Slayer and her scoobies.  Jesse could have learned basic magic from Giles and then become more powerful as the series progresses.  Perhaps with Cordelia constantly in danger, he feels that he has to turn to the ""dark arts"" to protect her.  We know that he can get obsessed, so the magic=drugs metaphor episodes could still occur later on.  Cordelia doesn't care very easily for other people, so I think that once her character grows a bit and she cares for the scoobies it will be a very fierce devotion.  Giles will notice that she's uninterested in anyone else's well-being (a mild version of sociopathic?), and take her under his wing.  So we may get more background on Ripper Giles.  I think that a team of Buffy, Oz, Cordelia, Jesse, and Giles would have figured out the significance of the key a little bit faster.  Jesse would not be as powerful enough to stun Glory like Willow did.  But now they have a werewolf on the team and by this point, Oz will have much better control over his power.  Cordelia and Giles will focus on taking down Ben while the others fight Glory.  Buffy's death is so important to the next season and to her character, I think that she will still have to sacrifice herself for Dawn.  Will the scoobies of this group want to revive her?  Not sure.  Jesse won't have that kind of power, and I think this group is smart enough to do the research and decide against it.    Buffy will be revived, though, because the First Evil will manipulate someone into doing it."
buffy,31pw82,DementedJ23,2,Tue Apr 7 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I really like this version. Xander under Spike's wing could make for some really interesting baddie dynamics. Like Spike ""raises"" him in all the ways he wished Angelus had. Also I see more vampire-romances possible - Xander-Willow? Xander-Cordelia? Xander-Buffy? Probably not something Joss would have done, actually."
buffy,31pw82,LadyLizardWizard,2,Tue Apr 7 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a way to take it. It's very possible. The reason I had Xander dusted was just because I felt that with no fighting experience, even if he didn't die the same way Jesse did, Buffy would have done it. Even though Buffy was friends with Xander, she had only just met him and I think could do it. But yeah. I think its interesting what a difference vamp Xander vs dusted Xander makes"
buffy,31pw82,Rekdon,2,Tue Apr 7 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"That's such a departure from the original story, love it. Part of me kind of prefers the idea that Buffy's story ends at the end of season 5, it seemed like a really complete arc for her. Having said that i'm happy there are another two season to watch of course."
buffy,31pw82,heymeowmeow,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:33:40 2015 UTC,"to be fair, in alterna-verse, xander and willow seemed like really effective vampires. maybe they'd've been smart enough to run an become recurring villains, using their knowledge of the slayer's foibles and weaknesses to torment her."
buffy,31pw82,heymeowmeow,3,Tue Apr 7 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"True, but that was in a 'Verse where Buffy never came to Sunnydale at all.  Vamp Willow and Xander most likely had time to hone their skills without having to deal with a Slayer.  I think Buffy could take them if they were freshly sired."
buffy,31pw82,matsiinthecity,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"i don't disagree she could've taken them, i think mayb they were cannier than your average vamp and might've run, even if just for the sake of drama in later headcanon confrontations. :O)"
buffy,31pw82,Enzown,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could see it. There is also a theory that vampire bloodline determines their potential.  Which is why Darla, Angelus, Spike and Drusilla are so formidable because they are from the Masters Bloodline.  In the Wishverse, if I'm not mistaken, the Master is the one who sires Willow.  So if thats the case maybe she's a little stronger than the average Vamp."
buffy,31pw82,Enzown,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"ooh, interesting, i'd never heard that. it would track."
buffy,31pw82,blunder_wood,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in that world, Buffy never came to Sunnydale. So there was no Slayer. I believe if Xander was Vamped, Buffy would have to make it a priority to take him out."
buffy,31pw82,blunder_wood,3,Tue Apr 7 18:03:09 2015 UTC,So if Angel was turned back wouldn't him and Buffy still be together? And if so I don't think Angel would have gone to LA at all. Plus with extra help maybe they could have put a stop to the nerd trio much earlier and got them to jail and avoided the repercussions. Angel is very good at investigating and finding people so I don't think their hideout would stay hidden as long as it did.

buffy,31l6xv,FunWinterSport,2,Mon Apr 6 17:09:25 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with Darla. She could have been much more bad-ass.
buffy,31l6xv,executioncommentary,24,Mon Apr 6 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"Angel.   Before electronic rocks are flung, I will confess to disliking the character so I'm not entirely sure ima different actor would actually make moping any less not good.   But that's the closest I come. That and wishing Jenny Calendar survived. (Unrelated, I swear!)"
buffy,31l6xv,lauchs,41,Mon Apr 6 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, however I think he did a great job when he was playing Angelus, and he did a lot better on his own show when he was away from Buffy. So maybe just some brooding acting lessons?"
buffy,31l6xv,theevilgiraffe,24,Mon Apr 6 06:52:18 2015 UTC,I hated Angel as a character until I watched Angel the tv show. I remember not even wanting to watch it because he annoyed me so much in Buffy but I'm glad I did. So much less whining and brooding! I wish there was more of that Angel in Buffy.
buffy,31l6xv,Twerkle-Belle,14,Mon Apr 6 09:35:47 2015 UTC,"Which really solidifies the idea that Buffy and Angel made each other miserable. She was addicted to pain and death, but also desperate to see something 'good' from the evil of vampires - a souled vampire obviously drew her in. But given one of the main themes of buffy is that you make your own destiny, I prefer to interpret her 'cookie' speech as saying 'I know we seem destined to be together but maybe we should spend a bit of time working out whether that's what we actually want'.  Of course the reason Angel is better later is because it's his own show and he needed to be a more well-rounded personality to carry it. But in-universe, it really seems Cordelia makes him a better person. Buffy can have her sexual-masochistic relationship with Spike and just leave Angel to find happiness."
buffy,31l6xv,calgil,10,Mon Apr 6 12:11:29 2015 UTC,She definitely shouldn't let Angel find happiness.

buffy,31l6xv,heymeowmeow,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:08:05 2015 UTC,I think he's exaggerating. S2 and s3 Cordelia was prime Cordelia
buffy,31l6xv,calgil,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Cordelia in Season 5 was a pretty good stab at rectifying everything they'd screwed in up in Season 4, as well as giving her an actual send off."
buffy,31l6xv,Sammyboy616,2,Tue Apr 7 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"You know what's funny? I watched Angel first, and I'm watching Buffy now. Angel doesn't come across as ""whiny and broody"" to me - he seems to be speaking from a long background of pain. And when he talks to Buffy (especially in the episodes leading up to Graduation Day) he really feels like an experienced, mature adult speaking knowingly to the teenaged Buffy."
buffy,31l6xv,Gimli_the_White,2,Thu Apr 16 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"That is funny actually, and I did find that after I'd watched Angel that his character in Buffy was a lot easier to stomach.   Amazing what a bit of context will do!"
buffy,31l6xv,Twerkle-Belle,2,Thu Apr 16 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. Hated Angel (especially after Spike was introduced, because I felt like Angel was such a sentimental dummy), but David Boreanaz played such a perfect Angelus, he's one of my favourite characters. Absolutely adore the dark side, hate the goody side."
buffy,31l6xv,001ritinha,8,Tue Apr 7 16:16:31 2015 UTC,before electronic rocks are flung    Haha that's hilarious. I'm gonna use that.
buffy,31l6xv,RoflPancakeMix,3,Mon Apr 6 11:49:51 2015 UTC,"When David Boreanaz started on Buffy, he'd had only one previous acting job and very little training. He was indeed terrible in S1, but he clearly worked at it, and was a lot better in S2. Gotta give him props for that. By the time the spinoff started, he wasn't bad at all.  I'm also not a huge fan of Angel as a character, or the Buffy/Angel relationship, which had David Greenwalt's fingerprints all over it. (""When you kiss me, I want to die""? That's some Twilight-level shit right there.) But I have to admit, I can't imagine anyone but Boreanaz playing the part."
buffy,31l6xv,stillnotking,4,Tue Apr 7 12:57:22 2015 UTC,Nathan Fillion auditioned for the role of Angel. He's much cuter when he smiles so I'm not sure how I feel about this.
buffy,31l6xv,sarah_bellum75,3,Mon Apr 6 14:47:58 2015 UTC,But then we wouldn't have Nathan in S7 and the world would be a poorer place for it.

buffy,31l6xv,SoMuchMoreEagle,2,Mon Apr 6 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"Angel seemed apathetic about things all too often. I understand part of that is his character being 200+ years old, but it doesn't make for compelling TV."

buffy,31l6xv,PeterFnet,15,Mon Apr 6 07:00:16 2015 UTC,Maybe Michelle Trachtenberg. Dawn was meant to be irritating but not so much that I was cheering for the bad guys in earnest every time she was near danger. It could just be the character though.
buffy,31l6xv,melody-calling,11,Mon Apr 6 11:23:10 2015 UTC,Part of the issue with Dawn is she was originally intended to be younger (I think around 10) and it took a while for the writers to shift from that to writing for a young teen once Michelle was cast.
buffy,31l6xv,Enzown,5,Mon Apr 6 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"She was originally intended to be anywhere from 6 - 10 years old. I recently made a post about this, pointing out that nobody really gives a shit about Dawn because she's whiny, even though by all accounts she's not really a thing, and when she's no longer a key and becomes a normal person, she's ignored by everybody. About the only people that really care much for Dawn are Spike and Tara.   The writers had to re-work the role of Dawn to be somebody older, because of strict labor laws in television only allowing for a few hours of filming a day, so they hired an older actor, thus the reason Dawn was 14 when she appeared.   Had she been a little girl, I think people might have felt some compassion for her character, but that's a big maybe."
buffy,31l6xv,barre_chord_reality,9,Mon Apr 6 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's just the character. As written, how could someone do better? Like trapping everyone in a house, and when a dude is dying and needs to go to the emergency room, she's like ""Oh of course you want to leave, here you have to be around me!"" I don't think that could be improved no matter the actor.  But I also think she didn't get annoying until S6. In season 5 she served her purpose, and actually, she was a lot less annoying. When she was annoying, there was a point to it, usually a joke, like when she messes up Buffy's meditation handstand."
buffy,31l6xv,lecherous_hump,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:24:03 2015 UTC,"There was a point. She was just trying to make the Buffy imposter mess up, not Buffy. If you watch the scene it's so clearly not SMG doing that handstand."
buffy,31l6xv,_shazbot_,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"It also seems like the reason she ended up being annoying in Season 6 because Buffy's not really doing a great job of the whole substitute-parent thing, adding to the ever growing pile of crapness that is essentially that season's Big Bad.  Also, the only time I found her annoying in Season 7 is in 'Him', when she's basically possessed, and when everyone kicks Buffy out of the house, but then again I hate every character in that episode."

buffy,31l6xv,staked,8,Mon Apr 6 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, Bianca Lawson is very talented and perfectly capable of playing that part well.  In fact, I think she did remarkably well given the requirements thrust on her for it (most specifically the last-minute addition of a strange accent).  I honestly don't think the issues with Kendra are on her shoulders at all."
buffy,31l6xv,CJGibson,6,Mon Apr 6 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"Everytime my husband sees her he yells, ""Call me now!"" like the bad psychic from the commercials that was on late night in the 90s. Her accent is abysmal. Then there's Boreaneaz's Irish one to make it sound better."
buffy,31l6xv,sarah_bellum75,3,Mon Apr 6 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Kendra's actress, the accent wasn't her idea, and it was thrust on her at last minute-- literally just before filming, they came up with it and made her do it. She never claimed to be able to do a Jamaican accent, so I'm not sure where the inspiration for that even came from, but it really wasn't her fault."

buffy,31l6xv,AnticitizenPrime,20,Fri Apr 10 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"I kinda think the actress who played Tara needed some help. I just didn't see her as being so impressive that she could bring Willow over to being gay. I didn't hate her by any means, but I just feel like she struggled with her acting a lot. Or maybe I just didn't like the fake stutter and the meekness so much.   I feel like Darla could've been done a little more interesting by someone else. I'm not sure how, but maybe it's just that I didn't adore her character as much as I did so many others.   There were so many perfect castings though. Spike, Drusilla, Willow, Giles, Cordelia, and Oz could never be replaced."
buffy,31l6xv,theevilgiraffe,40,Mon Apr 6 06:55:34 2015 UTC,"Just saying, Tara didn't ""bring Willow over to being gay"" - there's a reference to Willow's bisexuality long before Tara shows up. (I think it's the episode Anya is introduced in, right?)"
buffy,31l6xv,saxman481,18,Mon Apr 6 07:34:49 2015 UTC,Something like that.  Vampire willow from the alternate universe is bisexual long before normal willow knows she has a thing for the ladies.

But I agree with you on Amber. I don't think she did a great job, it was just so painfully obvious that she was acting a lot of the time. Her devotion to Willow always felt real though, but the rest was a bit forced. Then again, she is SUPPOSED to be an awkward character, and maybe we as an audience just aren't used to that being shown this clearly, without any comical undertone."
buffy,31l6xv,Arya_Bananahammock,6,Mon Apr 6 11:00:27 2015 UTC,"In fairness, Darla really wasn't very interesting until ""Angel."" Then she was excellent."
buffy,31l6xv,catdoctor,3,Mon Apr 6 20:26:36 2015 UTC,I agree with you about Darla.  I like how she has so many aspects to her.  I especially liked the way she and Drew played off each other.
buffy,31l6xv,SoMuchMoreEagle,8,Mon Apr 6 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised that you think Tara wasn't great, I found her really convincing, though it does help that I know someone pretty damn similar to her personality wise. Also not great at determining acting quality, which is why i'm drawing a blank as to who could of been recast.  I will say that Armin Shimerman as principle Snyder was a great choice though :P."
buffy,31l6xv,Little_hat_logan,3,Mon Apr 6 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"I really think it's the fact that she's supposed to be awkward. The thing about playing an awkward, shy, stuttering character is that the personality type is fairly similar to some bad acting performances. For an example of someone who does the personality type really well, I'd recommend watching Reece Thompson in the movie Rocket Science. His character has a stutter and it is constantly impeding on his interactions with others but at no point does it feel like the awkwardness comes from the actor over the character."
buffy,31l6xv,heymeowmeow,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for the recommendation. I guess one of the problems is that their isn't a lot of people playing ""awkward"" characters that I can think of, unless it's a comedy where the awkwardness is played up purely for laughs."
buffy,31l6xv,Little_hat_logan,2,Mon Apr 6 19:08:01 2015 UTC,Every Michael Cera movie ever are the only other awkward performances that came to mind lol but Rocket Science is really great imo
buffy,31l6xv,heymeowmeow,6,Mon Apr 6 19:10:38 2015 UTC,It's just a testament to Seth Green's performance that you never questioned that Oz could bring Willow over to being straight.
buffy,31l6xv,bookant,3,Mon Apr 6 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"I've never found Dawn as irritating as everyone else does. Maybe because I first watched Buffy knowing she was coming and how irritating she was going to be so I was prepared for a high level of hate I just never felt. When she's written badly it really shows though, like in Older and Far Away and GET OUT GET OUT which my God... Everyone else I'd pretty much keep, but that might be because I can't imagine them otherwise. Would Riley be anymore interesting with a different actor? The problems I had with him are mainly how messed up that relationship is and how we're meant to forgive him because he's a once in a lifetime guy when he's never shown that - more writing than anything.  Also Jenny Calendar should have survived."
buffy,31l6xv,jennifercalendar,3,Mon Apr 6 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"Perfectly cast: Buffy, Spike, Giles, Cordelia, Anya, Faith, Dawn, Willow, Darla, and the Mayor (yes, yes, YES!).  Iffy, maybe someone else could've done it better: Riley, Angel (on BtVS only), Tara, Xander. Maybe Gjokaj as Angel or Xander. That'd be interesting to see.  Recast: Fuckin' Kennedy. No. This is not more blatant, unfocused Kennedy-hate. It's my opinion that another actor could have pulled off the writing better.  Kennedy was extremely combative on the show. To the point where I felt like I couldn't connect with her character at all. Whereas Faith's shitty attitude and bravado came from a place of uncertainty and suffering, Kennedy just seemed to be... bitchy. For no reason. Then again, the blame could be partially placed on the writers for not giving her much of a back story. Or depth.  I know a lot of people in this sub are of the mind that Dushku's acting leaves something to be desired, but I personally don't feel that way. I connected with Faith on a deep level. Her scene in the alley AtS ""Five by Five"" is a testament to that.  We never got any emotionally charged scenes like that with Kennedy. Truthfully, I'm not sure Limon would've been able to pull it off anyways.  Disclaimer: I like Kennedy in the comics."
buffy,31l6xv,DigitalBathRx,3,Mon Apr 6 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine re-casting anyone. Most of the characters evolved over time as the writers worked with the strengths and quirks of the actors they had. That said, I found David Boreanaz as Angel boring, but fascinating as Angelus."
buffy,31l6xv,catdoctor,13,Mon Apr 6 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the biggest issue with the show's casting BY FAR is the abysmal lack of racial diversity. It's California, for chrissake-- what, like there aren't any black or latinx people in California?   Aside from that, I'd recast Xander. I can imagine how his character could be likable if he was played by another actor (like Ryan Reynolds, who I read was the first choice for that role), but there's something about Nicholas Brendon that I find very irritating. I can't put my finger on it.  I'm really torn about Tara."
buffy,31l6xv,sarah-goldfarb,16,Mon Apr 6 10:46:59 2015 UTC,"Something about the way Brendan played Xander made me not forgive him for his mistakes.

buffy,31l6xv,calgil,8,Mon Apr 6 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I loved Xander when the show originally aired but I've grown to dislike him more and more as time as passed, he just seems like an insecure asshole, waiting to be the bully instead of being bullied."

I feel the same way about his character, but it actually made me like him. Maybe because it was realistic, because people can really be that way, especially teenagers.   It's one of those things that sets a Whedon work apart, you know? Remember Wash's character in Firefly, with his jealousy issues - how he would lash out at his wife and Mal... and not in a 'lovable' way."

Santa Barbara is one of the whitest cities in CA -- 74% white and only 1.8% African-American by the 2000 census.  They probably should have cast more Latinos for verisimilitude, though, I'll grant you that."
buffy,31l6xv,lecherous_hump,4,Tue Apr 7 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"They tried to change that in S7 ended up with a bunch of crappy actors. Like the demon girl who ties Xander up. She could barely read her lines. Principal Wood was not a terrible actor, but he had no understanding of subtlety. There was the black Potential, who was the best actor of the bunch, but ironically, her character was annoying as fuck, so by doing a good job, she was actually being annoying.  In short, cast people who are good actors and right for the roles, not ""we need a black guy, hire a black guy""."
buffy,31l6xv,CJGibson,13,Mon Apr 6 13:18:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Ashanti was a singer, not really an actress.  It's not like there aren't talented non-white actors and actresses out there.  ""Who's right for the role, not just the black guy"" is a dodge, because there will always be dozens if not hundreds of talented people of all races and backgrounds who are ""right"" enough for any given role; that's just how many people out there are looking for acting work."

buffy,31l6xv,sarah_bellum75,2,Mon Apr 6 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. Alyson is quite likable and she worked as Willow, but I never found her to be a good actress. I rarely forgot that she was acting, whereas I completely believed most of the others."
buffy,31l6xv,sarah_bellum75,2,Mon Apr 6 18:05:38 2015 UTC,I swear success in Hollywood is 20% talent 80% luck. I see so many good actors go to waste and then they let a no-talent like Ashton Kutcher make movies. Ug.
buffy,31l6xv,ohmyglob4,2,Tue Apr 7 07:51:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wouldhave liked to see Joss' original decision of Charisma Carpenter as Buffy. SMG is just too-handsome? Classical looking? to be Buffy. She doesn't fit, she's just not what I think of when I think of a Buffy. I think sometimes she the way she plays the role it's hard to sympathize with her."

buffy,31l6xv,ModerateBias,31,Mon Apr 6 06:12:41 2015 UTC,"Really? I think she's pretty good. Particularly in the episodes where she body-swaps with Faith I think SMG does a much better job playing Faith than Eliza Dushku does playing Buffy.  In fact, that's my answer. I think Eliza Dushku couldn't invest Faith with enough pathos to make us give a shit about her fall and eventual rehabilitation."
buffy,31l6xv,calgil,9,Mon Apr 6 06:53:10 2015 UTC,I think dollhouse proved that Dushku lacked range...  i agree with you.
buffy,31l6xv,DigitalBathRx,6,Mon Apr 6 05:54:04 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Dukshu isn't bad but I fail to see Whedon's obsession with her. A lot of people could have played Faith better.

buffy,31ipw4,Buffy_Bot,31,Sun Apr 5 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"I love the first season, and the first episode. I think everything about the first season is remarkable in that the writing is still sharp, even though it teeters more towards a teenage drama show, than it does in later episodes.   Lame tropes are smashed in seconds when it is revealed who Darla really is. This show knew what it was immediately and only got better. I also love how the actors haven't really fully gelled yet. There's a bit of clumsiness there that I find rather endearing, but even a few episodes in they all click like they've been together as a core group of actors for years.   Some characters arcs begin immediately, while people like Xander basically stay the same from the first season to the last, in a very intentional way. I can't wait to binge though season 7, so I can start all over again and experience the ""newness"" of the first season all over again."
buffy,31ipw4,barre_chord_reality,8,Sun Apr 5 15:25:17 2015 UTC,Yey for another lover of season 1!  It brings back such nostalgic memories of when the show was live and the excitement of watching Buffy for the first time :)
buffy,31ipw4,coolbeaNs92,3,Sun Apr 5 18:25:52 2015 UTC,I love how the show matures with the group where season 1 is fun and playful and by 3 it starts to get much more serious

David Boreanez, who was possibly the most difficult piece of casting we did. We saw dozens and dozens of guys and never found anyone. David came in, gave a very good read. I liked him, he wasn't exactly, you know, my type. I wasn't sure we necessarily had the guy here until I asked the women in the room. Gale Berman, the executive for Sanddollar, and Marsha Showman, our brilliant casting director, who had both turned into puddles the moment he walked into the room.    First, it's ""Gail"", not ""Gale"". Second: as she is the person who is responsible for cancelling Firefly, my heart sank when she was mentioned."

Before he read about the gym thing, he was all Mr. Nice Guy. Then . . . well, he dies and gets replaced by an actual hard-ass.  I also like how the dialogue is completely on point just starting out. Clever one-liners, witty banter, and Buffy-speak starts out right away."
buffy,31ipw4,rbwildcard,9,Sun Apr 5 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm happy that they got rid of the ""wacky California speak"" that comes up in this scene:   GIRL #3: Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out and that’s why her mom had to get a new job.  GIRL #1: Neg.  GIRL #3: Pos. She was starting fights.  GIRL #1: (opening her locker) Negly!   A decision Joss Whedon described like this:   We toned that down as people didn't respond to it and didn't know what we were talking about. We still speak in a very strange patten but it's more based on the way I and the writers speak than anything we think teenagers might say.   But yes, I agree, I love a lot of the dialogue in this episode. :)"

buffy,31ipw4,MargotFenring,7,Sun Apr 5 23:15:13 2015 UTC,"Joss explains the lack of later skateboard use (I think in the commentary?). It simply took too much effort to film - instead of lighting one, smaller area you would have to have a larger area available and well lit. Xander is shown holding a skateboard maybe one other time for consistency, but it is never used again."

How did Buffy know that the dead guy hadn't drank Darla's blood? I feel like Jesse should have had more interaction with Buffy given that his death is supposed to be all shocking and everything, but maybe that was down played due to the thing with the credits though. Some of the creepy scenes were better than I remembered but the fighting falls kinda flat. I really wish I could've been around to watch this show during its original run."

S7 ep10  Giles: Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires. Primordial, ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. They are the vampires that vampires fear. An ancient and entirely different race and, until this morning, I thought they were a myth.   He doesn't seem to be the typical human-crossed vamp like the rest (obviously), so is he a ""pure"" vampire?   No, it is suggested in ATS ""Darla"" that vampires can change with age.   Master:  We stalk the surface to feed and grow our ranks.  We do not live amongst the human pestilence!  Angelus:  I'll be honest, you really couldn't with that face, now could you?  Darla:  Angelus!  Angelus:  It's not stuck like that now is it?  Darla:  The Master has grown past the curse of human features.  Angelus:  I'm not gonna get a bat-nose like that, huh? Am I?

As for having Jesse appear to Xander, that would have been cool, but they would have had to cut something out. Perhaps some of the time with Dawn?  I would not have wanted to cut a minute of any other part of the episode."

I understand why Amber Benson chose not to come back - it would have been a heartbreaker. But it is sort of strange, within the logic of the show, that The First never uses her form... or, for that matter, doesn't use Joyce's more, or Jenny Calendar's with Giles. As for Jesse, I think it would have been difficult to create the same emotional impact."
buffy,31jtfp,friggidydamn,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"Two in-'verse explanations I've seen; one is that once Willow rejected FirstCassie's temptation, the First had no more reason to appear to her in any way, so no need to take tar'as form, and the Cassie-appearance was because in a way it was more heart-rending to Willow not to see Tara.  Another possibility is that Tara (unlike Buffy) was leading an active afterlife as a good spirit and was able to magickally block the First from using her form."

buffy,31hbbi,angryelves,17,Sun Apr 5 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to say that men in Buffy aren't the greatest. All of the characters, including the men, are very flawed, but as far as it goes for men who are generally considered likable, at least by the show, we have plenty of those: Xander, Giles, Oz, Robin (I think he was awesome), Andrew (got to redeem himself), Jonathan (also got to redeem himself), and of course the vampires. Sure all these characters fuck up majorly, but then again, so do the women, so I really don't know what you're talking about.  On the subject of Hank, I really wish there was an episode where Buffy and Dawn confronted him for being terrible to them, but I don't think that him leaving is that unrealistic. Even in the beginning, he didn't seem to visit very often, which is why Buffy was so excited to see him. I got the impression that he was the kind  of dad who spends time with his kids out of obligation, not because he wants to. I don't think it's that unrealistic to believe that over time he just didn't feel obligated anymore."
buffy,31hbbi,averagebitca,2,Mon Apr 6 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the men are scum, and Giles is perhaps the best of the lot, but the men are usually the ones letting the others down, walking away, leaving, screwing things up, where Willow, Tara, Buffy, Anya, etc are constant.  I think you are reading a lot of things into Hank's character that's aren't necessarily there. Sure, it's assumed that what you say happens when Buffy can't get in contact with her father after Joyce's death. But in the first season, which is what I was talking about in the original post, Hank doesn't feel that way at all. He seems genuinely interested in Buffy, where she is distant.  Thanks for your comment, but I think we just see Buffy very, very differently."

Originally the show was going to be written without ever showing Buffy's parents, but I like how they worked in the role of Joyce, and to some extent Hank.   When you get right down to it, none of the Scoobies had a very stable family, which is why they became each others families."
buffy,31hbbi,barre_chord_reality,3,Mon Apr 6 15:42:05 2015 UTC,Interesting point about the family being the Scoobies. Hadn't thought of that!
buffy,31hbbi,talk_like_a_pirate,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:57:23 2015 UTC,There's a similar character formula that's applied to Angel as well.
buffy,31hbbi,melody-calling,6,Wed Apr 8 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"""Found Family"" is a common trope in Whedon's work.  Like the avengers or firefly."
buffy,31hbbi,catdoctor,10,Thu Apr 9 08:23:40 2015 UTC,"I feel that he wasn't in the show very much just to make Giles more important to Buffy, acting as a father figure rather than just her watcher and so Buffy has to look after Dawn giving Buff more responsibility and Dawn more ammunition to whine."
buffy,31hbbi,catdoctor,2,Mon Apr 6 11:21:04 2015 UTC,"This seems likely to me, too."
buffy,31hbbi,magickmidget,7,Wed Apr 8 06:56:53 2015 UTC,"One of the greatest characters in Buffy is a man. Rupert Giles. I think Hank was an absent father because it makes the bond between Buffy and her watcher much more important and complex. Also, Xander is a good man who makes some mistakes, but his love for Buffy and Willow, and his courage in spite of not having any super powers are admirable. Oz was a good man who managed to overcome his very powerful urges as a werewolf. He had the strength to risk losing (and eventually lose) the woman he loved in order to protect her from himself. Robin Wood was a good man with a deep wound that led him to seek revenge on Spike. But otherwise an honest, loyal and courageous person. Wesley Windham-Pryce was inexperienced and socially awkward, but he meant well. And eventually, on Angel, developed into a strong and brave leader. So, there were some great, human men in Buffy."
buffy,31hbbi,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"They certainly have some good moments, Cat. But I think many would agree the women shine brighter in Buffy."
buffy,31hbbi,doesanyonehaveweed,2,Wed Apr 8 06:58:58 2015 UTC,"Sure. And I'm glad about that because most TV shows focus on the men. Less so now but certainly before ""Buffy."""
buffy,31hbbi,Sammyboy616,5,Wed Apr 8 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"I've pointed this out in the past but it seems to be something a lot of people don't consider: the reason Buffy's parents split up appears to change after the monks create Dawn.   Many people have mentioned that Hank suddenly becomes an absentee father and all round jerk. So what if, when creating Dawn, the monks decided Buffy and Dawn needed to be isolated, to only have one another, to ensure that Buffy would always be with her and therefore protect her from Glory? That's a little pointless if Hank is there to take in his youngest daughter (who he can't protect anyway) when it's too dangerous for her to be around Buffy, so let's make it so he won't because he isn't interested in parenting in the first place.   I feel like this is supported by the events of Normal Again, with Hank suddenly there for Buffy, their only daughter in that reality, in a mental institution. With he and Joyce's ""reason"" for divorce removed (an undisciplined daughter s1-4 [I know both he and Joyce say there's more too it, but it is basically what we as the viewer are given to believe from Joyce and Hank's arguments]/possible affair and disinterest in children s5-7), they are still together.   TL;DR He isn't really an absentee father, he had to ""become"" one so Buffy would feel solely responsible for Dawn with the knowledge that neither of her parents were able to take that role."
buffy,31hbbi,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Apr 8 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"Great point about the post-Dawn thing. I really hadn't considered that!  Even more reasons to personally dislike Dawn! I want to like her, but I just can't!"
buffy,31hbbi,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:00:57 2015 UTC,"The only real story-based problem with that is Hank's absentee nature starts in S-3. There is also the whole, more theoretical, idea of storyline integrity; making the monks' spell responsible for anything specific except Dawn's existence is fundamentally a cheat, almost a Patrick-Duffy-in-the-shower."
buffy,31hbbi,stillnotking,4,Fri Apr 10 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"I thought hank went from being this involved, loving father, to an absentee, self-absorbed jerk, with no creeping up on it."

buffy,31fiko,srauf456,5,Sat Apr 4 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"To some degree, yes. I find myself comparing all shows to Joss Whedon shows, and there are many shows that I sort of casually enjoy, but I know that I would probably love if I didn't have the far superior Whedonverse to compare them to. I'm constantly like ""this show has a fun concept, but imagine how much better it would be with Joss at the helm! They'd be handling their ensemble cast so much better/not bringing people back so often that death is meaningless/using way better dialogue/developing the villains beyond these two-dimensional characters,"" etc. Basically, Joss ruins you for everybody else by being too damn amazing. ;)"

I follow about 20 shows a season and have a backlog that could take me well into next year to finish.

buffy,31fiko,danielle_kb,3,Sun Apr 5 13:39:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, to a point. I have watched some good series since my first experience watching Buffy, but that is still my favorite. And yes, everything gets compared to it, especially in terms of character development."

A good example of this is Person Of Interest. I mostly started watching it because Fred from Angel was on it. The show itself is okay, but some of the bottle episodes fall pretty flat.   Is there any possible way I can talk about Fred from Angel and how her character is similar to Root from Person Of Interest on here? I can spoiler tag it."

I don't like how blunt the ""magic = drugs"" metaphor was, I thought it was really silly that Willow literally went to a dark magic dealer and ""got high"" (floating on the ceiling). It made the whole thing less dramatic because it felt like an anti-drugs PSA.   I also thought that the house-destroying scene with Buffy and Spike was the least sexy thing I've ever seen.  Always interesting to see people have totally different opinions about these things."
buffy,31c8su,heymeowmeow,4,Fri Apr 3 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"I can definitely share your sentiment with the whole 'drugs are bad mmmkay' idea. I totally agree it was depicted a bit heavy handed with the magic addiction.   However, I tend to see some codependent behavior that is evident in many of Willow's actions. Some of her choices in the past lead me to believe that a substance addiction is not a huge leap for the character. She has emotional control issues, as evidenced in episodes like Something Blue and Doppelgängland. She has a deeply rooted insecurity with her 'stupid mousy ways,' these issues are repeatedly reinforced throughout the series. And honestly, if we're going to see addiction in Buffy's world, I'm ok with magick being the metaphor, I'm really not interested in seeing Willow snort lines or anything. Her accidental conjuring of the demon is far more interesting IMO.  Also, as a side note, I believe the writers included some of their past real-life problems in the show, since life is the big bad of season 6. For instance, I know the attempted rape scene with Spike and Buffy was based off of one of the writers' real experiences. Makes me wonder if the addiction angle evolved in a similar fashion. (One of the writers possibly suffered with drug abuse?)  Wrecked/ Smashed is not my favorite 2 episode story arch in the show. But I do feel like it's important for the overall story. I said I loved it, because it's Buffy and of course I love it :) However, I wouldn't put these episodes on my top ten list or anything.  (Edited a typo)"
buffy,31c8su,DaddyCatALSO,5,Sat Apr 4 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a problem with the idea of Willow being addicted to magic, it's just how heavy handed it was. Things like Willow using magic to wipe Tara's memory of the fight are great, they show her becoming dependent on magic and willing to use it to take the easy way out instead of dealing with the problems themselves. But Rack was just too much for me. Dark Willow was great and I think it could have happened just the same without Smashed and Wrecked being so over the top."

buffy,3120rr,The_Iron_Zeppelin,5,Wed Apr 1 16:30:59 2015 UTC,Supernatural is great as long as you don't go in expecting anything nearly as deep and affecting as Buffy.
buffy,3120rr,rockthecatspaw,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, I couldn't watch it after watching Buffy. The characters were so underdeveloped and there really wasn't a defined story line that they would stick to. I made it about three seasons in and just gave up."
buffy,3120rr,ohwowgosh,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"The funny part is, if you had watched until season 5, you would have seen how each season was part of an intricate over arching storyline that was planned by the creator from day one.  Seasons 4 and 5 brought major clarity to everything that preceded it.  I always tell people, if you haven't watched the first 5 original seasons of the show, then you really can't appreciate it."
buffy,3120rr,The_Iron_Zeppelin,5,Wed Apr 1 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"Should you really have to wait five whole seasons for it to get good and make sense though? I have heard that from other people too, but I don't have the patience to put that much time in to a show before it starts making sense. I don't think a good show should take that long before a clear story line comes together."
buffy,3120rr,rockthecatspaw,2,Wed Apr 1 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"You're misinterpreting what I meant.  The show in itself makes sense from a season to season basis.  It just doesn't seem like it has a direction or a specific reason why this random stuff is happening to these brothers.  In season 4 and especially 5, you begin to see that all the prior seasons were planned meticulously.  Which is why you have to watch them to get the full effect of the show.    Which is common, i mean Buffy followed a similar pattern.  Monster of the week + recurring characters + Seasonal Arcs.  Supernatural was just less Campy than Buffy.  Idk, I enjoyed both series."

I think the only thing Supernatural really has going for it are hot guys. The monster-of-the-week formula gives it a little nerdy street cred, but really it's the X-Files minus anything interesting."

buffy,3120rr,TheDuckinator,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"I have disagree with you on the first 5 seasons being boring.  The first 5 seasons are the life blood of the series.  The only reason the show continued after the first 5 seasons was because of the popularity it had generated, otherwise the creator would have ended it there as he intended.  If anything I'd argue that seasons 6 thru 10 are more directionless plot wise because they weren't thought through as much as the first 5."
buffy,315uat,KarmaSoupTruck,11,Thu Apr 2 05:37:51 2015 UTC,"How I view it: Basically anything that doesn't involve the realm of magic is ""natural"". Ex: A human killing a human without magic.  However, anything ""supernatural"" related (vamp bite, portal, etc) would be mystical."
buffy,315uat,SuperNova2012,2,Thu Apr 2 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"And what about demons killing people in human ways? Like a vampire who shoots someone, or a demon who kills someone with a nonmagical sword?"
buffy,315uat,irishartistry,5,Thu Apr 2 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I dare say the same principles would apply. If a vampire or demon kills someone in a human way (gun, sword, broken neck etc.) I would class it as natural."
buffy,315uat,tydestra,2,Thu Apr 2 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that would be a death by man made means (guns, swords) while magic and bites are not man made and thus unnatural."

buffy,315uat,SuperNova2012,3,Thu Apr 2 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yep. I just think that no one really thought of resurrecting because it hadn't been done before and when a slayer drops, the next one gets called. Plus, Buffy was the only one (correct me if I'm wrong) that had people outside of the ""slayer circle"" and also a non-anal watcher. (Think Wesley before he got ""Americanized"".)"
buffy,315uat,Starlite85,0,Fri Apr 3 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"But it would just make so much more sense to resurrect a dead,  but fully trained slayer then to start from scratch with an untrained,  newly called slayer who is more likely to die."

buffy,315uat,Starlite85,3,Fri Apr 3 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"I like to think that willow probably would have been able to bring tara back.   She knew the ritual to do it (not the same she used for buffy,  but the one she helped dawn find to try and resurrect joyce),  but Osiris told her it couldn't be done because it was messing with the natural order of the universe.   She wouldn't have been the same tara that we all knew and loved and Osiris knew this and was trying to protect willow."

buffy,315uat,Starlite85,2,Fri Apr 3 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Im talking about the scene earlier in the episode when tara and willow head out to breakfast and leave dawn in their room.   Before she walks out,  willow uses her magic to slide a book forward on the shelf for dawn to look at.   Doesn't she have to go to the doc to get a certain item for the spell to actually work?"
buffy,315uat,bwburke94,3,Fri Apr 3 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"Tara's death was natural because she was directly shot by Warren. Even if Willow had hypothetically set Tara on fire immediately afterwards, the bullet would kill her before the fire, making resurrection impossible by magical means. Furthermore, even if the fire/magical resurrection theory were to work, Tara's body would somehow have to be prepared to survive the bullet wound (see also: Darla's syphilis.) Buffy's first death (""Prophecy Girl"") was natural, having been killed by a vampire in a human way. This meant magical resurrection was impossible, but Xander was thankfully able to perform CPR. Furthermore, as it was a natural resurrection, there was no further impact to the Slayer line other than Kendra being called. Buffy's second death (""The Gift"") was magical, as the death was from the portal rather than the fall. Being a Slayer, Buffy could have survived a normal fall even from that distance. Because her death was magical, Buffy could be magically resurrected, albeit at a cost. It's worth noting that the whole First Evil thing was a result of the magical resurrection of the ""spare"" Slayer; had this been Faith rather than Buffy, no one knows what would have happened. Cordelia's coma/death is assumed to have been natural, being from a childbirth technically induced by physical means when Connor boinked her. However, the coma itself was magical, and if Cordelia's body were to have healed before she technically died, the coma would be the cause of death and her death would be magical. Physical deaths directly caused by vampires/demons (Jenny, Anya, Wesley) were natural. All dusted vampires are assumed to have been magical. Although this doesn't need to be said, Joyce's death was natural."
buffy,315uat,DaddyCatALSO,3,Fri Apr 3 04:15:07 2015 UTC,"The only part of this that doesn't add up to me is Cordelia's death. Sure, she did get pregnant kinda naturally. But also it clearly wasn't a normal pregnancy. She did not stay pregnant for 9 months I believe, and I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to believe Jasmine actually came from her womb. Therefore the pregnancy to me should be a mystical death as it was clearly a mystical pregnancy."

buffy,315uat,catdoctor,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Faith wouldn't have jumped into the portal though as she is not of the same blood as Dawn (which is why Buffy was able to seal the portal by dying). Dawn would have had to have been put into the portal and the rest of the series would have been less whiny.
buffy,315uat,DaddyCatALSO,2,Mon Apr 6 13:46:58 2015 UTC,"In short a ""natural death"" is anything that could happen to one of us in real life: accident, murder, illness, suicide, etc. A ""mystical death"" is anything that involves magic. If a demon or vampire commits the murder of a human, it's a natural death unless they use magic to do it. So, if a demon hits you with a bolt of electricity or a blunt object and you die, that's a natural death. If a vampire drains your blood, it's a natural death. If a demon puts you through a magic portal, it's mystical."
buffy,315uat,catdoctor,2,Fri Apr 3 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"Well, the MAster just weakened Buffy with his bite, then she drowned"
buffy,315uat,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"That was a natural death and a natural revival. She was brought back with CPR, not magic."

buffy,315uat,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:41:29 2015 UTC,"There are so many deaths and resurrections in the Buffyverse that I am not sure that we can take the demon Willow talks to in ""Villains"" completely literally, at least in the sense of concluding that only mystical deaths can be ""undone.""  Trying to bring someone back from the dead is always a tricky endeavor that requires resources, sacrifices, as well as the help of a powerful being (Osiris, for example, or the Senior Partners, or the Powers That Be, or D'Hoffryn).   The fact that a death is completely natural does not, I think, preclude the possibility that the person could be brought back. Darla was a normal vampire who had been staked. Her raising was a complex endeavor that required a scroll and a ritual and was definitely a special circumstance, but it could be done.  Jack and his friends in ""The Zeppo"" died naturally and were brought back. Maybe they weren't completely the way they used to be, but from their memories and stories it sounds like it :)  There's no reason to see Holland Manners or Lilah's deaths as particularly ""mystical,"" but they were also brought back by virtue of the ""standard perpetuity clause"" in their contracts with the Senior Partners.  Resurrection rituals are different for each person we see brought back. I think what the demon tells Willow in ""Villains"" is not that Tara could not be brought back, but that it wasn't at all the same as when Buffy was brought back. It was the specific method used to resurrect Buffy that was unavailable for a natural death, not raising her in some other, less reliable fashion. And probably involving calling upon another entity, since it sounds like Osiris had no interest in helping her.  Practically speaking, I think that if the writers wanted to bring back Cordelia (or Tara), they could find a way that was plausible and more or less consistent with the rest of Buffyverse lore. After all, they did bring back comics spoiler"

buffy,3139gz,buffanater,3,Thu Apr 2 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"Oh totally. About to go to bed, but quickly since I'm not sure which bit you mean:   Kennedy is a generally unpopular, often reviled character from season 7.   CSS is Custom Style Sheet, the subreddit style. I'm not a coder, but in layman terms it'd be something along the lines of the underlying code that gives each subreddit (webpage/whatever) its unique look/feel. Like the different upvote/downvote icons, fonts, backgrounds, layers, the way elements behave when interacted with, etc. I just pulled most of that out of my arse, but I think that's what css is; it's 1am here so that's what I'm going with!  I just had a suspicion that they might slather the subreddit in Kennedy images/icons today as a joke after seeing what some other subs inflicted on their subscribers with changes to the CSS."
buffy,3139gz,barre_chord_reality,3,Thu Apr 2 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty sad commentary on Buffy fandom. I know you're talking about a harmless prank on April 1st, but as a whole, fans of this show who embrace so many people and demons from all walks of life pick out one person to they shovel all of their angst onto. It's Kennedy.   Always Kennedy.   In fact, when I browsed to r/buffy yesterday I was wondering what kind of post there would be about Kennedy, and sure enough, here it is.   It's mostly disheartening because fandom never moves on. Nobody seems willing to reevaluate how important a character really is in a seasons overall arc. But hey, hatin' on Kennedy is cool, so let's just continue to produce non productive dialogue about it.   EDIT: I love the downvote to disagree principle being applied here. Speak up!"
buffy,3139gz,Sammileighm,2,Thu Apr 2 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"My apologies. I don't hate Kennedy though, it was just a joke, even if a poor one. I commented above that the upvote icon could be Clem, which was also just a bit of lighthearted silliness because he's not my favorite character anymore than Kennedy is my least favorite.   On the Nintendo sub yesterday they changed their css to include a character named Tingle from LoZ that generally annoys the fanbase. I came to r/Buffy not 5 minutes after seeing the Tingle joke wondering if likewise I'd see something similar done here with Kennedy, Dawn or Snyder for example.   I'm probably making it worse attempting to explain myself, but here's a discussion from a few weeks ago about Kennedy that you might like. I'm on mobile so I just grabbed the most recent Kennedy discussion that I remembered: https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/2y6945/in_defense_of_kennedy/  I honestly meant no harm or offense. I don't like upsetting people."
buffy,3139gz,barre_chord_reality,2,Thu Apr 2 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize, it just gets frustrating sometimes. Overall, this is a really productive and civil sub that I almost always enjoy reading and contributing to.   Even when there's a day like April 1st where it's okay to make mischievous posts like this one, it still contributes to the overall dislike of a very misunderstood character.   I think it's more important to discuss in a meaningful way why Kennedy did or didn't contribute anything to the season, or the Scooby Gang, rather than the standard fandom phone in of ""Kennedy is annoying, she isn't good enough for Willow"" ad nauseam.   I don't like upsetting people either, and I don't like being combative on otherwise really great subs like this one, but I do hope that one day fandom will be a little more open to understanding characters on a deeper level other than just being annoying. It's just lazy."
buffy,3139gz,elliethefirst,2,Thu Apr 2 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, would you say that about Dawn? Since she's a less popular character as well."
buffy,3139gz,barre_chord_reality,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"I've written a lot about the subject of Dawn. I think she's endlessly fascinating, in that she, much like Kennedy often draws the ire of Buffy fandom, but in the overall grand scheme of the 'verse, she didn't really do anything -- she was just kind of there.   For somebody like Dawn, who wasn't really a person, then lost her mom and her sister, then only to get her sister back who pretty much ignored her, along with the rest of the gang, until the series ended. I often look at Dawn as a brilliant look at abandonment. I don't know if the writers intended for her character to languish the way she did for the rest of the series, but if they did, that was a masterstroke of writing.   I don't really care to lump both characters together, but hey, they're generally hated by fandom, but nobody is ever really willing to go to any length to describe why they don't care for these to outcasts, other than that they are simply annoying."

I like how the whole gross menstrual thing was turned on its head and became a device for the slayer to hone her slayerness.  I think it goes well with the whole overarching female empowerment message of the show."

buffy,312lon,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Apr 2 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"According to the Wikia page, Slayers have the following powers/abilities:     Superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability. Accelerated healing. Prophetic dreaming. Ability to sense vampires and demons to an extent. Innate close quarters combat and weapons skills.   As the others have said: I think it was something like a spidey sense. I don't remember exactly which episode, but it was sometime during season 3 because she was discussing it with Faith... Buffy described it as a tingle in her lower spine. In a later season, she also mentions that she is able to feel Faith this way. When the Potentials arrive, same deal. She can feel them, but not as strongly as Faith. Which, to me, would imply that the two Original Slayers are not only stronger than the newly activated Potentials, but more intuitive and perceptive as well.  I went a lil' off track there. I love discussing Slayer lore. It's so interesting to me. For example, the prophetic dreams. In the past we know Slayers connected with those that came before them and essentially inherited all of those skills, fought those battles, and connected with them on a subconscious level.  However, the fact that Buffy and Faith can share the same dream space (and help one another) suggests that all of the Slayers are connected in some metaphysical way. Possibly even sharing the same ancient personality that is the Slayer. It's fascinating to me that Buffy is actually made of two parts. The woman, Buffy, and the primal entity that is the Slayer. I like to think of the Slayer as the id within each girl. It's purely instinctual with one goal in mind: kill demons.  Faith, in my opinion, is more in touch with her inner Slayer. She cedes control to her id in tough situations (not so much in the comics). Buffy, beacon of morality that she is, is in constant battle with her Slayer by always trying to do the right thing. It is my belief that this is why Buffy was so upset about Finch dying, while Faith's forced nonchalance was brought about by id saying ""collateral damage happens, whatever."" That doesn't excuse her actions, but it definitely explains the beginning of her downward spiral."
buffy,312lon,DigitalBathRx,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to burst your bubble, but I'm fairly certain that Buffy is unable to ""sense"" other slayers (or potential slayers) in the show. I think this idea came from fanfiction and is not canonical.  I can think of several examples where she is unable to sense the presence of other slayers. When she and Kendra meet, she takes her for an assassin, while Kendra takes her for a vampire. Kendra does show some hesitation with her interpretation and asks Buffy who she is (after Buffy behaves non-vampirically in a fight), but I don't think either of them can really sense each other's ""slayerness"" or trust that the other is really a slayer until it's confirmed by the Council.  When Buffy first sees Faith, she can tell that the guy she's dancing with is a vampire, but she doesn't know until she sees her fight that she's a slayer. In fact, she goes out to rescue her, and Oz is the one who announces that she's a slayer.  Buffy shows an ability to tell when Faith has killed and why (recognizing her ""brushwork"" in Professor Worth's death and also shooting down Wesley's suggestion that it was a ""random killing""). But I don't think she can sense her presence in any way. In ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You,"" she repeatedly doesn't know where Faith is, and Faith even surprises her on campus. Faith is able to find Buffy, but I think that's more because she remembers the addresses of where she hangs out and can also look up her likely on-campus movements (like Spike does).  As for her sensing the Potentials ... the First is able to masquerade as one for a couple of days without her knowing. They had to do a spell to find the one in Sunnydale. And all of their knowledge about when new girls are arriving comes from Willow, the coven, and/or Giles.  I mean, she and Faith certainly have a connection; they're able to share dreams and are both drawn to Slayer-specific weapons like the scythe. And Buffy dreams that the Bringers are attacking potential slayers all over the world, but I see this as more closely related to her other prophetic dreams, and not some preternatural sensing ability.   If I'm missing some obvious revelatory conversation, let me know, but I don't think this is a Slayer power at all. :)"
buffy,312lon,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sun Apr 5 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"It is certainly a common theme in fanfiction, you're right there, but it is also canonical. That's probably why it's a theme in fanfiction, and one used to reinforce Buffy's connection with Faith. While I would gladly like to walk down that road, and did a bit when I went off track, that's not my original intention for discussing this ability.  It is not a reliable ability...   Ability to sense vampires and demons to an extent.     but one that was referenced/alluded to in early seasons, and then never really mentioned again on the show. Much like Buffy's ability to jump over the gate in ""The Harvest"" (S01E02). My theory is that it is a combination of intuition (gut feeling/instinct) and perception (heightened senses/situational awareness). Also, it seems to be one that needs to be practiced. Buffy is also briefly seen ""sensing"" Marcie when she was invisible, she paused mid-fight in ""Band Candy."" This is my explanation for why it's an inconsistent ability on the show. The jumping thing... I don't know how to rationalize that one.   Slayers possessed a heightened awareness of their surroundings. This heightened awareness could, with experience, allow the Slayer to know the position of an attacker and fight them blindfolded or in the dark. This was not a constant ability, however. This skill must be honed through practice and the Slayer usually must focus to achieve the full benefit.   In the comics  Edit: There was also an interesting dynamic of these abilities in Fray  Edit 2: The part where I said Buffy described it as a tingle in her lower spine may have came from fanfiction or some other Whedon-related literature, but the ability did not."
buffy,312lon,DigitalBathRx,3,Sun Apr 5 18:35:25 2015 UTC,":) I didn't mean to offend you with my theory that the idea of Buffy being able to sense other slayers came from fanfiction - hopefully I did not. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with fanfiction! It's just important (I feel) to make a distinction between Slayer powers as evidenced in the series, and those that are hypothesized or extended by fans in various media.  I'm not all that familiar with the comics, so I'm a little unsure what powers Buffy has that you were referring to there. So everything I'm about to say may need to be re-interpreted with information from s8. Although - correct me if I'm wrong - comics spoiler  I've mentioned several places where (it seems to me) if Buffy did have an ability to sense slayers, we'd be able to see it. I can't think of a single example (in the show, at least) where she shows or talks about any kind of ability to physically tell when a slayer is nearby.  But more than that, I actually don't think that Buffy's sometime ability to sense demons or vampires comes from her ""Slayer-ness"" at all. The Wikipedia and Wikia entries you quoted are able to be edited by anyone, and I've unfortunately found many of the statements on them to be false and/or misleading. :/  The more I think about it, the more I'm coming to think that what Buffy has is mostly something that goes along with her fighting skills. Just as supernatural and innate as those - which is to say, not very, since she is constantly needing to train. She's simply attuned to things in her environment, like the movement of the air or things feeling ""off"" (her asking everyone to be quiet so she can concentrate in ""Family"" would be smart for anyone to do in a situation where they're being attacked by invisible creatures). And although Faith is able to tell that the guy at the Bronze is a vampire in ""Who Are You,"" Willow is too. Vampires are different, and if you know what to look for, anyone could pick up on it, I think.  In ""Checkpoint,"" the Council doesn't expect Buffy to be able to fight Philip blindfolded without instructions. Giles tries to test her situational awareness in ""Band Candy"" by having her try to hit him with a ball while blindfolded. She does these things well, but they don't expect her to have some special abilities in this area.  The idea that Buffy has an ability to ""hone her senses"" and tell where vampires are comes from Giles, who says to her in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"":   GILES:  The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can you tell me if there’s a vampire in this building?  BUFFY: Maybe?  GILES: You should know! Even through this mass and this din you should be able to sense them. Try. Reach out with your mind. [...] You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, till you can feel every particle of –  BUFFY: There’s one.   The reason I think that this ability is never discussed much again is because it's not a big part of the Slayer mythology - and what's more, I don't think it was ever intended to be. As Joss Whedon said about this scene:   This is another one of our classic sort of ""Giles is trying to live in the world of normal horror movies and Buffy completely undercuts it"" scenes. It's what we used for Tony's audition.  The way he gives the line, ""But you didn't hone."" always makes me laugh extraordinary much. His frustration at her... just complete subverson of all of the rules of making horror movies. The idea that vampires would dress in the era that they were killed in was a charming notion but one we ultimately abandoned because if every vampire looked like he was from the 70's or the 50's or whatever it was, they really wouldn't be that scary.    So that is more or less my theory. :)"
buffy,312lon,GinaZaneburritos,3,Mon Apr 6 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"Lol, you didn't offend me silly. It takes a lot to irk me. Plus, I love discussions like this.  Yeah, you're right about the comics  Now, as I said before, this ability isn't reliable. I like to use my own theory (that it's a skill that needs to be honed) to explain that. But it's probably because the writers wrote it into early episodes, and then decided not to keep it for whatever reason. Just like the super crazy jumping ability I referenced earlier. Buffy was able to vault over that gate in season 1's ""Harvest"", but we never see her do something like that again.  I'm rewatching the series now, so hopefully I can find the exact lines where Buffy mentioned it. But it was mentioned several times I believe in seasons 2 and 3. When I say mentioned... it wasn't something that was discussed at length, rather, said offhandedly. Also, in that horrid Buffy movie: Buffy could sense vampires with her period cramps or something. I'm not sure if this was a Joss thing, then he tried to incorporate it into the series and just decided ""nah.""  I'm pulling from the Wikia page as a reference, yeah, because I can't find anything on the internet about it. And I'm not about to go digging through episode transcripts. Clearly, it's not a popular topic of discussion considering how specific it is lol. I know Wiki's are not reliable sources and I assume everyone else knows this, so I don't need a disclaimer with every post. Though I have done that in the past lol.  Speaking of the show, specifically: I think what it all boils down to is personal opinion. It was an ability that was canonical in early seasons and then just kinda fell by the way side. I have my own headcanon for why that is, and I'm sure others (such as yourself) would rather just discard it. Which is fine either way and one of the things I love about the Buffyverse.  TL;DR The sensing ability was made briefly canonical in early seasons (and I'll try my hardest to find that dialogue), but the writers never developed/expanded upon it so now it's all up to fan interpretation. Oh, and I'd like to be clear that my first post in this thread, where I went on and on about Slayer lore, is my own interpretation.  Edit: I tried not to give too much away in that spoiler, so be forewarned!"
buffy,312lon,DigitalBathRx,2,Mon Apr 6 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll keep an eye out during the re-watch. :)  This is the first time I've paid much attention to the scripts and what the writers and actors have said about the series, so I'm sure many of my opinions will change as we go through it. :)  Edit: And good, I try not to be offensive. :P"

And (2), holy crap, she's about one-third the age that Drusilla was when the series began.

She comes in during season three and when Spike was supposed to die she would've been the stand in ""Big Bad"" until Angelus emerged. Instead Spike was kept alive because of his popularity and she jut kinda hangs around being mystic until Spike steals her away in Becoming. She's also the only member of the Fanged Four that doesn't get a redemption arc even though her story is arguably the saddest. Her whole ""family"" is taken away from her and yeah she's evil but she's also mentally insane."

buffy,30p949,MoonSpider,8,Wed Apr 1 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"Okay: to open, the unaired pilot - it had really strong echos of the Buffy movie (mostly in the characters of the vamps, but also in Buffy's character). Did Joss use this to get the series accepted?"
buffy,30p949,A40,7,Sun Mar 29 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"It could also be that a lot of the iconography specific to the film were things that Joss wanted to do in earnest on his own this time.  Like him reclaiming the white dress and jacket imagery in ""Prophecy Girl."""
buffy,30p949,MoonSpider,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"I've understood that Joss didn't like the farcical, comedic tone of the movie. I was surprised to see the vamps mugging for laughs in the big theatre fight scene."
buffy,30p949,A40,2,Sun Mar 29 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but there's a distinction between the overall tone of a piece and individual comedic beats, kind of like the the difference between the overall climate in a region versus the day-to-day weather.  The gist of Joss's gripe was that he had written a story with truly scary elements about an empowered woman, and the film turned this into a broad comedy.  Even in this cheap pilot, Buffy's destiny and the death of the student are treated as very serious things, even though there are plenty of silly beats throughout.  The overall goal is still to create a grounded mythology, not a goofy romp.    The Vampire stuntman groaning in pain for a bit is cheesy, but it's not anywhere near the level of mugging and milking that happened in the movie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE74RNgwSkQ&t=10s"
buffy,30p949,MoonSpider,3,Sun Mar 29 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"The vamp's mugging moment was full-on PeeWee Herman to my eyes.  Was Joss wanting a studio exec to think, ""Ah, yes! That comedy was just like the movie - that made money! Kids will like that!"" Has he ever spoken about this pilot?"
buffy,30p949,A40,2,Sun Mar 29 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know how else to articulate the difference between Paul Ruebens grumping and groaning, popping in and out of frame and flailing limbs around for a solid minute vs a stuntman who was working one day on a pilot grimancing for a few extra seconds while waiting for a cut or visual effect that he had no experience with, but I promise you, the approach there is different.  All Joss was wanting from that moment was to show a vamp dusting, in service of completing an action scene of the general scope and scale of the fights that would be standard in the series.  Whedon had been specifically approached by an executive who already had the TV rights to the Buffy property to turn the concept into a TV show; he didn't need to convince anyone of the connection to the film once this project was underway.  He needed to show that the concept could work as a serialized television show.  He was a well-known script doctor and his original Buffy feature film script was extremely popular in industry circles before it was made into the movie and had a lot of the unique elements sanded off.  The movie wasn't a boon to the pilot, it didn't need to belabor the connection.         Joss has talked about the pilot and development in various interviews, like the season 6 special features ""Buffy: Television with a Bite."""

buffy,30p949,A40,2,Sun Mar 29 16:26:58 2015 UTC,Joss refuses to put the unaired pilot on any official Buffy DVD. He knows it's out there on the internet but he definitely doesn't advocate watching it.

buffy,30p949,A40,7,Sun Mar 29 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"That's essentially what any 'pilot' is--an audition for the show to be picked up by a network.  If it's an 'unaired' pilot, that means that they re-did the beginning of the show when they were picked up and the original pilot was never shown on TV. But usually the pilot is aired as the first episode.  In this case, Joss shot the pilot on a shoestring budget to sell the show, and then was able to re-do ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" once they had some proper funding, so that the look of the first episode (and casting, sets, locations, etc.) would match the rest of the series."
buffy,30p949,MoonSpider,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"I understand this, and I'm referring instead to the tone of the unaired pilot. It's very much an echo of the movie, while Episode one: Hellmouth, is very different.  Did Joss change his ideas as to the Buffy series, or was the unaired pilot intentionally more like the movie (which I understand he very much disliked) so a network would buy his show - a show he intended to be much different in tone?"

I don't think the tone of the pilot is anywhere near the tone of the movie---I think that the cheapness of the pilot somewhat clouds a very distinct difference in approach.  I'd say Joss very intentionally made the tone DIFFERENT in order to sell his intended vision of the series, not similar to make it more appealing to the network."

buffy,30p949,choketheboys,6,Sun Apr 5 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"Watching this unaired pilot, what struck me most was the way Xander, Buffy, Giles, and Cordelia were portrayed. In many cases, it varied considerably from the show, and even from ""Welcome to the Hellmouth.""   Xander strikes me as pretty suave, actually. He has no trouble engaging Buffy in a long introduction of the different campus groups. He jokes with the surfer kids. He doesn't stumble over his words like he does later (""Can I have you? Dyeh - can I help you?"") or turn into a ""bibbling idiot."" He goes up to Buffy outside the Bronze like he's totally sure he belongs there. When things don't make sense or seem odd, he brings it up right away and adapts remarkably quickly to strange circumstances. Cordelia becomes a much better and more fleshed-out character in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth."" With all the stereotyping going on, no one ever mentions that she's the best or the coolest or the most popular. She just comes off as randomly mean. Unlike in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" we never see her being nice, and when she says cutting things, there's nothing that really provokes it. Buffy strikes me as much more well-adjusted and sure of herself. She gets along easily with Xander's analysis of the school groups - and with Willow - and with Cordelia. She talks the principal into letting her see the body, rather than sneaking around like she does in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" - she doesn't seem much out of her depth in any social situation. When she's talking to Giles, she talks about how slaying has made her life suck, but she also likes being good at it. She's intrigued by ""zombies"" in the Time Life book. She shows off her Slayer skills coming down from the second story of the library. She doesn't seem intimidated by Giles much at all; she's able to get him to be quiet and and go into a long speech while he's reduced to cleaning his glasses.  Giles seems much more ineffective and uncomfortable than he does in the show, and even in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth."" Buffy bringing up what happened to her previous watcher seems to unsettle him. Unlike in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" he never praises her; in fact he points out everything that she did wrong (even though he wasn't even there) and calls her a ""teen thing."" He tries to get her to understand the necessity both of her duty and of working with him, but he's shut down both by her and later by everyone. More than Buffy even, he seems to be less than thrilled by his ""destiny"" of having her as his Slayer.   As a ""first draft"" of what the characters will become, I found the unaired pilot interesting. But overall I don't think it sheds much light on the show as a whole, and I can see why Joss Whedon doesn't particularly want people to see it."

Oz being the Dingoes' bass player is a very common misconception, just like Buffy's name ""actually"" being Elizabeth. There is someone else in the band who plays bass but he is never named. But also outside of the Dingoes Oz is only ever seen playing the guitar, like at the end of ""Lovers Walk""  where he is holding an acoustic one. He owns several electric guitars, for example in season 4 he plays a BC Rich Warlock, and in season 2 he plays a Fender Stratocaster that is inscribed ""Sweet J"" (likely a reference to the original name of Seth Green and Breckin Meyer's production company, which was called Sweet J Productions).  There are also several textual reference to him being a guitar player: In ""Inca Mummy Girl"" Devon says that Oz is the lead guitar player of Dingoes (""You're lead guitar, man, that's currency!""), and in ""The Zeppo"" Xander specifically asks Oz if it is hard to play the guitar (to which he replies, ""Not the way I play it"").  There is one single reference to Oz owning a bass: in ""New Moon Rising"", Oz tells Willow he traded his bass to have his van fixed and garaged after it broke down outside Mexico. But he is never actually seen playing it and he is definitely never seen using it while playing with Dingoes.  Edit: added some stuff."

If he could play during filming it probably wasn't anything more than ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."""
buffy,30rhit,DethFiesta,3,Mon Mar 30 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"The first time Four Star Mary met Seth Green they made fun of him for not being able to play the guitar. That's why Seth later asked the guitarist of the band (Zu) to come to the set and teach him to play. Initially Zu wanted to instruct him on ""just making it look good"" but Seth insisted that he wanted to learn how to actually play.   I start to show Seth the parts of the song that he'll be playing, and I just tell him to put his hands around here on the guitar neck, and jump up and down, and it will look cool. He insists that he actually wants to learn the parts so it can look as real as possible. I teach him the chorus of the song. Then Seth tells me that he never even touched a guitar before he started the show, and he has now gone out and bought one so he can practice. He is picking up the chords pretty quickly.   It's not specified when exactly this takes place but there's a mention of flyers for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me lying around. That came out in 1999 so it's probably around late season 2/early season 3."

buffy,30rhit,DethFiesta,3,Mon Mar 30 18:07:09 2015 UTC,Oz was the lead guitarist for Dingoes and Devon was the lead singer.   I believe the bassist name was Sam although I'm not 100% on that.

Sometimes, it even features as a plot point. A few examples off the top of my head:   In ""Witch,"" the Summers' kitchen is full of crates and art for a tribal art display at the gallery. Buffy even helps open a crate. In ""Ted,"" Joyce meets Ted when he installs new computer software at the gallery. In ""Dead Man's Party,"" the Nigerian mask that reanimates the dead is something Joyce brought home from ""a very exciting shipment at the gallery."" In ""The Freshman,"" Joyce fills Buffy's bedroom with crates while she does inventory at the gallery."

buffy,30mda5,friggidydamn,22,Sat Mar 28 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, Joss stated that he intentionally left the ending open to interpretation. This episode was supposed to be some sort of postmodern look at a writer writing a show. He wanted to showcase the fact that he could undo years of work with one episode. Essentially, rewriting the fantastical world that is Buffy with one that is more logical.     How important it is in the scheme of the ""Buffy"" narrative is really up to the person watching. If they decide that the entire thing is all playing out in some crazy person’s head, well the joke of the thing to us was it is, and that crazy person is me. It was kind of the ultimate postmodern look at the concept of a writer writing a show, which is not the sort of thing we usually do on the show. The show had merit in itself because it did raise the question, ""How can you live in this world and be sane?"" But at the same time the idea amused me very much and we played on it a little bit, ""How come her little sister is taller than her?"" ""What was Adam’s plan?"" We played on the crazy things we came up with time and time again, to make this fantasy show work and called them into question the way any normal person would. But ultimately the entire series takes place in the mind of a lunatic locked up somewhere in Los Angeles, if that’s what the viewer wants. Personally, I think it really happened. - Joss Whedon (Q&A w/ NYTimes)   Now, I absolutely love this episode. I'll tell you why:  This delusion of Buffy being in a mental institution is almost an alternate reality in a way. Think of how real this must seem to Buffy: she was once committed before by her parents, what the doctor is saying is rational, and come on... how fucking crazy do vampires, demons, and a little sister made from a ball of your energy sound? Crazy, right? They even incorporated her time in heaven, explained as a brief period of lucidity by her doctor, which sounds more reasonable than dying and being brought back by magic.  Now think about this... think about how much easier it would've been for Buffy to accept the delusion. Hey, no more vampire slaying. No more ""weight of the world"" on my shoulders. And look, my mother is here. Alive. Think about how much courage and sacrifice it must have taken to cast that aside and go back to a world she knows is filled with pain and suffering. Buffy has always been dear to me, but in that moment, her selflessness made me fall in love with her character all over again.  TL;DR Buffy could've chosen the easy delusion over the harsh reality, but she has ovaries of pure steel and fuck if going crazy is gonna stop her from saving the world.  Edit: If anyone hasn't read that Q&A, I definitely recommend it."
buffy,30mda5,DigitalBathRx,2,Sat Mar 28 22:48:03 2015 UTC,she has ovaries of pure steel   I love this.

buffy,30mda5,p72entrophy,13,Sun Mar 29 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it recently enough to confirm in my mind that she hadn't taken the antidote yet when it ended, but if that is true then I accept that answer.  also, I was never upset about the episode, and just assumed/thought it was all fake and meant to make you doubt the reality of the show, which in turn made me NOT doubt the reality of the show. If that makes sense."
buffy,30mda5,Mquestionmark,6,Sat Mar 28 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"I thought this episode was brilliant, and was genuinely shocked when I discovered many fans were upset by it. I loved that it was left so ambiguous at the end about which reality was the true one. That's what makes the episode. It would've been far less interesting had they said for definite that it was all just demon-induced delusions.   I love it when the show went in unconventional directions and took risks, but I guess I'm in the minority. It seems that the majority of fans wanted things to stay nice and safe and comfortable. But for me that's not what Buffy was about."
buffy,30mda5,JangoF76,9,Sun Mar 29 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"The way I see the episode, Buffy was torn between two realities and was forced to make a choice. She expressed in ""Dead Things"" a desire to feel that her actions weren't real, and the visions or hallucinations she experiences offer her a way to erase the reality she's been living in. They are so effective not only because she's so isolated from her friends and sister, but also because they tap into her insecurities, her lack of faith in her calling, and her escapism.  I think the lack of an antidote is important, but more because it highlights the fact that Buffy is making a choice. She's at a crossroads; she has two ways that she can go, and both are presented to her as equally ""real"" and compelling.  Originally she chooses not to take the antidote, but she is unable to go through with all that that choice requires of her. The sacrifices of her in-show reality are ones, by the end, she is more able to accept, and in doing so she is able to let go of some of her self-hate.  Because the idea of choice is so important to the episode, I think the answer to the ""which reality is real"" question was deliberately left vague. So yes, I think the lack of an antidote was important, but not that it necessarily makes the hospital any less real. It was very real to her. Just because she takes an antidote to make it seem less real does not mean that it's not ... it comes down to her choice. As it does for everyone."
buffy,30mda5,GinaZaneburritos,7,Sat Mar 28 19:56:22 2015 UTC,The ending of the episode never annoyed me either! It was an interesting episode in terms of exploring Buffy's troubled psyche but the fact that so much happens on the show that Buffy doesn't know about proves to me that Sunnydale isn't all a delusion.
buffy,30mda5,strawberryf1elds,3,Sat Mar 28 19:35:00 2015 UTC,Interesting take.  Though I'd have to wonder how anybody who's a Buffy fan could hate this episode. It's a goddamn masterpiece.
buffy,30mda5,ctsmith76,2,Sat Mar 28 20:22:12 2015 UTC,I personally don't think whether she's taken the antidote or not is relevant. The reason I personally found this such a disturbing (in a good way) episode was because it made me question my own reality and sanity. It forces Buffy to question what it's all worth and forces us to question whether anything is real. Basically I had a three week long existential crisis after watching this episode.
buffy,30mda5,Lilzenforth,2,Sat Mar 28 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"I really liked the episode's story, calling into question the ridiculousness of it all. I never questioned whether the show was all faked like most of the movie Sucker Punch.  They may have wanted to cast doubt but it's just as your friend said. She found the strength to fight and turn away from the very tempting illusion, getting a grip on reality and killing the demon, while simultaneously ignoring the other reality in her mind. She sits down and tells them to get the antidote. It'll take time for that illusion to fully stop.   I also liked the episode with Spike's past with the trigger song. Shows he never truly became a monster like Angel did since he still loved his mother, and the monster she became haunted him for hundreds of years while he played the role of a bad guy before once again falling in love, and using that passion to fight for a soul."
buffy,30mda5,IsaystoImIsays,2,Sat Mar 28 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"My take is that it doesn't matter if it's all a delusion or not. It's the fact that Buffy made a choice that's important. She chose a place where she could be important, powerful, and loved. Is it real? Who cares! It's real to her!"

buffy,30imsq,ModerateBias,14,Fri Mar 27 20:58:26 2015 UTC,Cordelia's character assassination. Fred being just this character that all the men fawn over and treat like a delicate flower. And then also ultimately dying so she can be the lynchpin in the development of other characters.

buffy,30imsq,rufus567,9,Thu Apr 2 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"Very interesting points that I'll keep in mind when I get around to a rewatch.   One thing about Fred though, I don't think her death was meant to be a lynchpin in other people's development. I think part of the issue is the cancellation at the end of Season 5 so they didn't really have time to develop Fred and Illyria further, though they get into it some in Angel After the Fall. I'd like to think that, had Angel gotten a sixth season, Fred's death would have gotten a bit more of the development it deserved with her memories and feelings ""taunting"" Illyria. I think they've said that they were going down that road.   EDIT: Tainting not taunting"
buffy,30imsq,TBoarder,5,Fri Mar 27 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"As /u/heymeowmeow noted, there was always more planned for Fred/Illyria than we got to see. Joss has said that he never intended for Fred to be permanently gone. At some point, the gang were going to figure out a way to split Fred and Illyria, and Amy was going to play two characters. Unfortunately, they didn't see the end of the show coming in time to satisfactorily tie up all the plot points and loose ends they'd introduced for future stories. And, yeah, it's technically accurate that whether or not it was on purpose, what you said was what happened, but, in my mind, intention does matter, and that's not where the story was actually supposed to go or what it was ultimately supposed to be about.  Edit: Clarity."

When she finished San Antone High School , she moved to Los Angeles for graduate school at UCLA. Originally majoring in history, Fred took a physics class with Professor Seidel which inspired her to take another path. Around this time, she began working at Stewart Brunell Public Library. On May 7, 1996, while shelving a demon language book, a curious Fred recited the cryptic text out loud and was accidentally sucked into a dimensional portal to Pylea. Her future friend, Lorne, was sucked into the same portal on his side and ended up in Los Angeles. The portal was actually opened by Fred's jealous college professor, Professor Seidel, who had sent every promising student to it, essentially sending them to their death. Fred was the only one of at least six to return.  While still in school, Fred was a marijuana user and was something of a conspiracy theorist.  Angel is ""rewarded"" as a champion, and is given the honor of killing Fred.

I get so sick of the anti shield circle jerking on whedon subs.   You realize this same kinda hipster attitude is what killed firefly?  And dollhouse?   People claiming that the OLD shows were the only valid ones, and the new ones were subpar.    You can smell Joss' influence in the story arcs, even if not in the individual writing.   Strong female charecters?  Check.   Heavy foreshadowing?  Check.   Characters who develop through interaction with each other more than major action scenes, and the action scenes are instead used to show their growth, not cause it?  check.  Chloe is doing a much better job than Eliza ever did in dollhouse, or Gina Torez did in either Angel or firefly."
buffy,30imsq,Doublestack2376,8,Fri Mar 27 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're overreacting there, bud. I'm a fairly active member of /r/buffy and I've never seen anyone here ""circlejerking"" Agents of SHIELD. On the contrary, a lot of people on this sub like the show (myself included).  As to my opinion on Chloe's acting... it's just that. My opinion. No one is right or wrong here and we're each entitled to our own viewpoint. As /u/hereticmoses said, it's possible to find flaws in something you love.  It's also possible to discuss your opinion without being combative and perpetuating the same type of attitude you initially condemned (i.e. lament the ""circlejerk"" of SHIELD and then bash Eliza Dushku in the very same thread).  Edit: As an aside, Firefly and Dollhouse weren't cancelled because of a hipster attitude. They both got the axe due to low ratings. Firefly's cancellation is largely contributed to a poor marketing campaign, the fact that initial episodes were aired out of sequence, and it was given a time slot that is known for fewer viewers. Dollhouse suffered a similar fate in regards to time slot; that coupled with the over-the-top marketing hype and a slow to pick-up plot... is a recipe for a steep drop in viewership. Joss himself also attributes part of the problem to Fox's lack of cohesiveness on what they wanted from the show, and hesitancy to air some of the more controversial ideas he had.  http://nerdapproved.com/news/former-fox-president-explains-why-firefly-had-to-be-cancelled/  http://screenrant.com/joss-whedon-talks-dollhouse-failure-aco-36447/"

And hipster attitudes did not kill Firefly and Dollhouse, unless the people at FOX are hipsters. Firefly was never given a fair chance by the network, and Dollhouse never really hit that hot spot that shows like Buffy and Firefly did.

buffy,30imsq,DigitalBathRx,3,Sat Mar 28 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Much better is pretty generous, imo. I'm up to date. She's improved, yes, but that still doesn't mean the girl can act. When I watch her on screen, I can see her trying on different emotions like clothes. Then, I start to analyze her. ""Aftershocks"" is a good example of this. When she's in the tank and talking with Fitz. Fitz just blew her outta the water.  To be fair, when you have such an all star cast with superb actors like Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Iain DeCaestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge... one's performance is bound to look lackluster in comparison."
buffy,30imsq,GinaZaneburritos,2,Fri Mar 27 22:13:38 2015 UTC,To be honest as much as I enjoy SHIELD a lot of the acting is pretty wooden only Fitz & Simmons really stand out as good actors to me. Doesn't stop me enjoying the show though.  As for the Jed Joss argument. Joss set the show up and wrote a few episode of the first season. After that Joss sets up the season arc and long term plot while Jed and his wife run the show day to day.

buffy,30imsq,lifelesseyes,3,Sat Mar 28 03:41:18 2015 UTC,":] Who is your favorite character on SHIELD? I really love the dynamic between Fitz-Simmons. How in sync they were with one another and that they almost balanced each other out. And as terrible as it is, Fitz's accident changed him on such a fundamental level that I really look forward to how he's going to change in the future. Before, a lot of things came easy to him and now he's really having to struggle through tasks that he would view as beneath him, in a way.  I think we can expect to see a strength of character coming from him that wasn't there initially. It reminds me a lot of Wes' arc on Angel."

buffy,30imsq,AngryWizard,21,Fri Mar 27 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Buffy is not a strong female character? Did you watch the show?  Here's a list of ""strong female character"" things Buffy has done:   She learns her death has been prophesied and puts her own fear aside to try and save the day, only to be killed by the Master anyway.  She killed the love of her life to save the world She is always there for her friends and classmates She is witty as fuck and can say hilarious puns while still kicking ass She kicks ass in general When everything else has been taken away from her, she still believes in herself She is not a ""depressed mess"" every time she is single. Where did you even get that from?  She has a strict moral code that she lives and slays by, and always looks for the fair and just conclusion even at the expense of her own happiness When given the choice to flee or fight, she always chooses to fight She sacrificed herself to save the world. It was not a case of her committing suicide because she was depressed - it was literally the only way to stop Glory. She ended her own life to save the lives of her loved ones. The Body She is brought back to life against her will. She was dragged out of Heaven and back into a world full of death and destruction. INSTEAD OF KILLING HERSELF which she wanted to do, she sucked it up and learned to deal. Doublemeat Palace - she does what she has to to get by, and doesn't view menial work as beneath her She still takes a chance on Faith and tries to forgive her in spite of the past. She fights Dark Willow    And I could write a whole lot more but seriously, who has the time?  The point of Buffy as a character is that she's supposed to be kind of ditsy at times. She is a teenage girl and she is the hero nobody expects. Joss created her as a parody of the dumb blonde who always dies first in horror films. He turned that trope on it's head and created Buffy.  I fail to see how she's ""not a strong female character at all""."

I don't think the writers forgot about the eggs or that it was a continuity error, it was just a plot line that didn't need an ending. Not everything has to complete closure and this was a running theme in season 1 (the mantis eggs, Amy's mum in the statue, the invisible girl). Interesting theory anyway."
buffy,30jfr1,clockworklycanthrope,3,Fri Mar 27 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"The thing that made the eggs different than the other two examples is the immediate impact they may have had added to the fact they're never referenced again. Amy's mom is mentioned by Oz later in the show when he's looking at the statue (and likely would have been destroyed in one of the two times that the school was.) The invisible girl doesn't necisarrily have an immediate impact as she would have been dealing with assassinations in other countries. Plus many believe that this tied in to the initiation. It gets referenced again season 7. However, the eggs were opening up in the school. That should have been a major catastrophe. But nothing happens. More likely than my theory is that Buffy just deals with them off camera, but I just prefer the theory that this goes full circle."

buffy,30hlyo,eggplant_twerk,68,Fri Mar 27 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"Buffy's first name ""actually"" being Elizabeth is a very common belief that many fans have. It pops up all the time in fanfiction and such. But it is erroneous. Etymologically the name Buffy is indeed a derivative of the name Elizabeth, based on a child's pronunciation of it (""Elizabuff""). But Joyce cut out the middleman and simply called Buffy Buffy. Buffy's full, legal name is Buffy Anne Summers; her gravestone and school records confirm this. There is no proof anywhere that her first name is actually Elizabeth."
buffy,30hlyo,Beloit,29,Fri Mar 27 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"Right, and there is an episode in season 7 where she meets the guardian ladies and they ask her name and she says ""Buffy"" and the guardian lady makes a face and says something like ""no, really."" and Buffy shrugs and confirms that is indeed her full name."

Charisma Carpenter is also seven years older than Sarah Michelle Geller (and just a few weeks younger than Robia LaMorte, who plays Jenny Calendar). Nicholas Brendon is six years older than SMG, while Eliza Dushku and Mercedes McNab are three years younger. I'm not sure how old Spike was supposed to be when he was vamped, but James Marsters is closer in age to Kristine Sutherland (he's 7 years younger) than to Sarah Michelle Geller (he's 15 years older)."

buffy,30ixgl,werewilf,17,Fri Mar 27 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"Giles absolutely does call out each of the scoobies when they do something stupid or dangerous - Revelations comes to mind, when he finds out Buffy was hiding Angel (""You have no respect for me or the job I perform""), or when he confronts Willow about bringing Buffy back from the dead (""you are lucky to be alive, you rank, arrogant amateur"").  Personally, although the consequences of Xander's actions were probably lesson enough, I think Giles was justified in the verbal dressing-down.  Could also partly have been a choice on the part of the writers to play up the suspense and peril, to balance out the mostly comedic tone of the episode?  In any case, I felt it was in character for Giles."
buffy,30ixgl,skeezycheeses,10,Sat Mar 28 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. Giles's reaction was completely justified. Even if the spell had worked as intended, Xander was trying to twist Cordelia's mind into loving him. That's just as despicable as Willow wiping Tara's memory in season 6."
buffy,30ixgl,BrianBuckley,2,Sat Mar 28 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"Probably why it didn't work, or the main reason why. Cassting a love spell with the intention of dumping the victim is truly hideous."
buffy,30ixgl,DaddyCatALSO,6,Sat Mar 28 18:12:16 2015 UTC,He was probably flashing back to his own youth and didn't want to see history repeating itself. He knows the dangers of reckless magick.
buffy,30ixgl,danielle_kb,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:54:40 2015 UTC,This is kind of my take on it. There were a few times that Giles got on Xander's case about things. I wonder if part of it was that Giles saw the lack of male role model in Xander's life and tried to fill that part. Combine that with the fact that Giles was quite irritated by Xander's immaturity and sometimes overreacted to it. It also could have nothing to do with male role models whatsoever. Just a thought.
buffy,30ixgl,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Mar 28 00:01:27 2015 UTC,I've always thought he was harder on Xander because he saw the potential within him and he didn't want him to waste it. There's definitely a male role model vibe going on as well.
buffy,30ixgl,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Mar 28 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"Giles's treatment of Xander has never really bothered me in this episode.  I think one major factor at play is a kind of jealous anger that Jenny Calendar came to talk to him and is instead quickly and completely enamored with Xander and ignoring him. Which of course he can't really take out on her, so he directs it at Xander.   It's only after he physically has to grab her and move her away from Xander that he starts treating him with such ""harshness,"" as you say.  As for the other times he is harsh to Xander in this episode (telling to ""get out of his sight,"" for example), I think a lot of that has to do with his anger, worry, and panic over how Buffy had been affected. She's his Slayer, and she's in real danger, and they don't know exactly where she is, and Giles is the only one who has to get everyone (Amy, Jenny, and Oz, who inadvertently lets Buffy get away) focused on not-the-spell to turn everything back to normal. Xander has managed to create a real crisis, one that Giles has to fix.  So I think he's rather understandably upset. As he tends to get when people (like Willow in s6) recklessly do things that could harm Buffy, or act rashly in a way that causes him pain (like Buffy in ""Revelations"")."

Not necessarily things he's carrying. which makes backpacks, messenger packs etc. problematic. And I think the dust includes most of the carbon in the vampire's body, so it's not the same as cremains, which a re mostly bone with some iron and stuff. Except for the low nitrogen content, vamp dust seem s like good fertilizer (In a fic, I had Harmony tell her first undead boyfriend pretty much that when he dusted on her parents' lawn.)"

It's an incredible game that, back in the day, revolutionized how my friends and I play all games with drama points.   It's one of the most fun and versatile games I've ever played.   Now if you're a fan more crunchy or mechanically games like Pathfinder or D&D, you might have an issue with how loose the game is. Because character death isn't a thing really. You can take an absurd amount of damage and if you do die you can come back with Drama Points! There aren't a ton of skills and they are kind of interchangeable.   The Buffy RPG is great but the game really comes together when you get the Magic Box Supplement which really expands on magic and the Angel RPG which expands on how to create demons and half demons.   But with that said it's an easily adaptable and modifiable, you can house rule it without finding there's a ton of other rule conflicts. They also give some conversion notes for bringing in the magic system of CJ Carellas Witchcraft so you can port in a different game."

buffy,306q96,Scendo,8,Wed Mar 25 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness. I am adamantly anti-Spuffy (anti-bangel too but that's a separate issue. Let the girl live!)  Spike tried to freaking rape her, like come on. Ok, he felt bad. Boo hoo. Ok, he didn't have a soul. It was still attempted rape of someone he claimed to love. She never loved him. If Buffy ever starts dating him (not up to date on the comics), good for her. She got over a trauma. A+ badass. But I could never board that damage, depraved ship."
buffy,306q96,Lollierot,8,Wed Mar 25 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"Buffy and Spike have a complicated history of sex (and are, incidentally, a precise example of why consent and safe words are such a big deal in the BDSM community). Spike comes on to Buffy, Buffy says no, then Buffy comes on to Spike hard, and they bang, then she says she never wants to see him again. Over and over. This is the entire pattern of their relationship, and Spike's error is an error in judgement (believing her rejection to be a part of the same pattern), not an error in morality.   That's why Spike stops - it gets past the point where, in their previous encounters, she would have normally relented, and he realized that this rejection was a real rejection. If it were Spike's intention to rape her, he would've kept going until physically forced to stop.  It's a disturbing scene, but it's one that makes absolute sense within their (unhealthy) relationship.  Edit: also, sidebar, Willow definitely raped Tara and everyone is happy they got back together after that."
buffy,306q96,StarManta,22,Wed Mar 25 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Don’t You Dare Try To Retroactively Justify Dawn   Actually the bit about Buffy having slayer reflexes but being unable to master the skill of driving was the only point I hadn't really considered. She should have been pretty darn great at driving right? I mean she had great hand-eye coordination, timing, and awareness. I guess Joyce thought she was still a bit of a ditz."
buffy,306q96,AngryWizard,15,Fri Mar 27 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"Buffy has trouble driving all throughout the series - it's not just what Joyce thinks :)  She drives like a spazz in ""Band Candy"" and in ""Him."" And in ""Who Are You"" when she's escaping from the Watcher special forces as Faith, she tells herself that she's ""good at this"" as she drives away :)  As someone who has also always considered cars to be ""un-mixey"" things, I always liked the fact that Buffy sucked at it too. But I admit that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
buffy,306q96,GinaZaneburritos,19,Wed Mar 25 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"See I always assumed that it was because no one ever actually taught her how to drive. Like I don't expect her to have a natural instinct for the mechanical, but I think if she was taught how to drive she'd actually be good driver. My mom taught me to drive by practicing in a big church parking lot. Then to get the insurance discount I took Driver's Ed (more successfully than Cordelia).   I felt like the times she drove in the show she was just winging it out of necessity, like Anya driving Giles car for the first time in the Olaf episode."
buffy,306q96,AngryWizard,8,Wed Mar 25 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe :) She ""took the class,"" but she ""didn't even pass the written.""   I feel like Riley would have taught her how to drive if she wanted. I got the impression she just wasn't all that comfortable with modern technology.  And she never asked Joyce to take her driving - she just wanted to get the keys. Which I always thought was a little weird. ""Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?"" Maybe she'd be ready to drive if she could do so legally, I always thought."
buffy,306q96,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Mar 25 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh well shit, I stand corrected then. I guess she really is a bad driver if assumed she'd never been behind the wheel before after seeing her try!"
buffy,306q96,AngryWizard,3,Wed Mar 25 01:36:07 2015 UTC,PLUS her super strength might make her over react to certain stuff.  So like she tried to dodge something but jerks the wheel way over instead of just steering out of the way normally.  She is still a better driver than magick is my drug Willow.
buffy,306q96,choketheboys,8,Wed Mar 25 01:48:17 2015 UTC,Willow drives better when she stands on the roof of the vehicle.

buffy,306q96,DigitalBathRx,8,Thu Mar 26 22:56:22 2015 UTC,I think Buffy is just clumsy. How many times did she drop something or fall or trip when she wasn't fighting? I think that is kind of the irony and beauty if Buffy... She is still human. Very human. Until she gets into fighting mode.
buffy,306q96,HobbitLass,4,Wed Mar 25 12:15:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's that Slayers don't generally mix well with modern technology for some reason.  At least on the show, they seem to exclusively use old weapons, rarely guns.  Buffy rarely uses a computer, can't drive, and even seems to have trouble operating ballpoint pens as seen in... The Initiative, I think."
buffy,306q96,KiraKira_,3,Wed Mar 25 06:34:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is really about slayers, it's more about the intended setting of the show. I mean, there is no slayer on Angel except for some cameos and we still see a protagonist using a gun just a few times during the whole show. And Angel loves cars."
buffy,306q96,Infamously_Unknown,2,Wed Mar 25 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"still see a protagonist using a gun just a few times during the whole show   On ... Angel? Cause I think I'd have to disagree with you there. Wesley uses guns a lot. Lilah uses guns - I admit she's not usually a ""protagonist,"" though I believe that every time she fires one it's against a common enemy. Fred uses a gun to great effect in ""The Magic Bullet."" They use ""lots and lots of bullets"" to try to stop Illyria. There may not be too many of these times when guns are used (and actually, all the examples I can think of are from later seasons), but they're very memorable.  And no one ever talks about how guns are ""never useful,"" the way they do on Buffy."
buffy,306q96,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Mar 25 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"(spoilers)  Sure it's more, but it's still rare and it's mostly just random bad guys shooting Angel. Even Wesley who starts using guns in the middle of season 4 is seen firing one just a few times (I might be mistaken, but I rewatched it recently and I'd say like 4-5 times, certainly not a lot).  And iirc, Skip does comment on how guns never work, just before the only time they actually did work. :)"
buffy,306q96,Infamously_Unknown,2,Wed Mar 25 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"4-5 times seems about right :)  Lilah shoots Billy. And Fred uses a gun to infect Angel with Jasmine's blood, which breaks her hold on the world. So it's not like guns only work once, although they're pretty ineffective against vampires, demons, and everything else they come up against (especially compared to crossbows, stakes, swords, axes, and - for some - good old supernatural strength), which is probably why they don't use them more.  The fact that guns only play a more major role in the later seasons probably has something to do with the fact that they're loosely associated with Wolfram & Hart (just like in Buffy they're loosely associated with the Initiative, as well as with clueless authority). So Wesley using guns can be seen as a product of his growing association with ""the dark side."" And Team Angel's use of guns and other technological contraptions in season 5 can be seen as a product of their association with W&H.  Then again, AtS kind of uses technology like Buffy uses magic. Magic is weaponized in Buffy, and Wesley and Fred often build or use new weapons through science and engineering. Even as far back as ""Fredless.""  I dunno, I just didn't get the same anti-gun vibe from Angel as I got from Buffy. But then again, Buffy is about high schoolers and young adults. Having lots of guns around would probably not be a message they wanted to send."
buffy,306q96,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Mar 25 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"You're right, Buffy was against the use of guns. I remember her saying as much several times during season 6 because of the Trio."
buffy,306q96,DigitalBathRx,2,Wed Mar 25 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, season 6 is really when they drive home the ""guns are bad"" message. She says the ""never useful"" or ""never helpful"" thing twice, in ""Flooded"" when she's talking to the bank guard, and in ""As You Were"" to Riley when the eggs start hatching.  I remember watching the commentary for ""What's My Line?"" and Marti Noxon expressed a lot of surprise at the scene where the police officer/assassin shoots a gun inside the school and takes Jonathan hostage. Within a couple of years the political and social climate had changed enough so they would never have had a scene like that later.  It's interesting that in ""Homecoming,"" Buffy takes the first weapon she finds (a gun - actually, according to the script, a ""30 aught 6""), and later in the cabin has this scene with Cordelia:   Buffy and Kulak fight. Cordelia tries hitting him on his spiny head with the spatula. Doesn't do a damn thing, but you've gotta admire her pluck.  Buffy: Cor ... the gun!  Cordy grabs the gun, tries to figure out how to work it as Buffy takes a slice to the arm. Cor finally gets a shot off - blowing a chunk of wood behind Buffy's head away.  Buffy: Cor ... the spatula!   Now that I think about it, it's similar to how Buffy is pretty incapable of hitting anything with the gun in ""As You Were"":   Riley: Later. It'll keep. Aim high - plenty of lead - they move fast.  Buffy: I'm not exactly gun gal.  Riley: Want to live? Learn fast.  The demons come at them. From all directions, it seems. Buffy tries to shoot them but can't hit them. Gunfire shatters Spike's bedpost, pillow, and barber's chair.  Buffy: These things are never useful.   Actually, the more I think about it, Buffy's lack of expertise and incompetence with driving, cooking (although I believe she gets better at that - ""syrups have kinds?""), and shooting guns probably has more to do with her similarity with Cordelia than anything else. Cordelia is bad at all of those things, too. :)"
buffy,306q96,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Mar 25 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"Man, you definitely need to get in on this rewatch with us. I love your insights."
buffy,306q96,DigitalBathRx,2,Wed Mar 25 18:35:00 2015 UTC,I'm in season 4 of Angel (my first watch-through) and I could swear that Wesley used a gun for the very first time last night.  (Not sure of the name of the episode but it's the one where the demon arrives where Connor was born).  It struck me that I couldn't remember seeing one of the protags using a gun before.
buffy,306q96,Howardzend,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's a Slayer thing, I think it might be a Buffy thing. Buffy seems to think Faith is a good driver in ""Who Are You.""  Faith seems to prefer knives, but she also seems eager to pick up any sort of new toy (like the longbow in ""Bad Girls"").  I'd guess that part of the reason we don't see Faith using a lot of technology is because she likes being more hands-on and enjoys the visceral nature of her job. And pens and computers and stuff are awfully abstract and intellectual ;)"

But I like that by season seven Dawn is a girl who is confident in herself, pretty badass at research, a decent fighter, and honestly on her way to becoming a woman who is okay with being who she is - the sister of the Slayer (which is a daunting task).   Dawn isn't perfect, and they could have made her learn to tap into her magical half. But the girl we see at the end of the show has come a long way from who she was in season six and for that I will always like her. She's not perfect, and she's not even a top ten character but for who she became I enjoy her immensely."

buffy,306q96,laser_marquise,5,Wed Mar 25 12:22:05 2015 UTC,"From the comments,   *Why was Buffy so cold all the time? She's living in southern California and she wears knit hats, bulky sweaters, long coats, etc. constantly. Was SMG a cold person? Was it because she didn't have any body fat to act as a natural cushion against the elements? What about that time when she goes out into the desert to commune with the first slayer and she's wearing a floor-length leather coat over a turtleneck? DURING THE DAY?   Of course behind the scenes it was to hide stunt doubles."
buffy,306q96,buffanater,2,Wed Mar 25 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"Isn't it a big joke too that people who live in southern California put on a parka if it drops to 65°F because they're not used to it? I know they filmed a ton of the show at night. I live on the east coast but I have friends in Florida who are the same way - temp drops to 70 and they break out the sweatshirts. Also yeah, stunt doubles."
buffy,306q96,AngryWizard,2,Wed Mar 25 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"I have noticed an inordinate number of turtlenecks worn by Buffy over the course of the series. I suspect that she had a secret relationship with a vampire the entire series long, and had to hide her vamp-hickies."

buffy,306q96,fusnoduh,7,Wed Mar 25 01:38:33 2015 UTC,I watched Buffy when it first aired but I was way too young for the show and I really don't remember any of the episodes I watched at the time except for The Puppet Show and Doublemeat Palace. Watching it as an adult was odd because why would my brain remember those two episodes out of all the brilliant ones I'd seen? Doublemeat Palace was fun as a kid but oh dear god it sucks.
buffy,306q96,chocolatekettle,2,Wed Mar 25 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think I like it because I don't eat meat. Initially I found the episode disturbing, until I found out what the meat was really made of. Then I thought it was amazing."

buffy,306q96,TheCrushSoda,6,Wed Mar 25 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"I've always been kinda torn on this issue, but I actually do see it as empowerment.  Literally the ability to be a slayer has to do with (a certain kind of) violence committed against you.  But then obviously there are lots of other kinds of violence that can be and are committed against women in this world (both supernatural and not).  So I took the activation of all potentials less as a further act of violence against these women, but more like, an ability to openly communicate about and understand the trauma that had already been committed against them (they were Potentials, after all), while embracing the power and perks that came with but eliminating some of the worst of it.

I had to use contextual clues quite a bit to figure out who a character was supposed to be, and it was very distracting.  The artist is the same for season 9, and although I didn't notice it as much, I'm really looking forward to reading season 10 with a different artist."
buffy,307o7v,skeezycheeses,5,Wed Mar 25 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"The season 10 characters are much more recognizable for two main reasons: the main artist and her style are different and better, and there are WAY fewer characters."
buffy,307o7v,yallcat,2,Wed Mar 25 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Whoa they changed artist, about damn time. Season 8 and 9 were just so ugly looking. They changed artists in book 4 and I thought it looked fantastic, then they unfortunately went back"
buffy,307o7v,TheCrushSoda,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"The new art style is incredibly cartoonish with some ridiculously exaggerated facial features (especially Buffy and Spike's button/enormous noses) and it bothered me at first, but I've gotten used to it and it does help distinguish the characters. I'm enjoying this new season a lot."
buffy,307o7v,Frank_the_Bunneh,3,Sat Apr 11 09:17:05 2015 UTC,"Season 10 is awesome so far. It's really ""back to the roots"". I'm really enjoying it."

You think she would be such a distinct character, but S8 had a lotta blonde Slayers in the same panes. Thank goodness for the Scythe."
buffy,307o7v,DigitalBathRx,5,Wed Mar 25 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"Pasting from previous thread    Well it all depends really. Season 8 veers of quite a bit. Because its a comic and has no budget in terms of storyline, they can go places they couldn't in the TV series. Joss admits that this ""went to his head abit"" and some parts are very out of touch with the Buffy TV show in terms of location and content.   To cut a long story short, yes, you aren't alone, but it changes and gets a lot better. Once you get past season 8 and onto other comics like Angel & Faith, you'll start to really get into it. It just takes a bit of time :)"
buffy,307o7v,coolbeaNs92,3,Wed Mar 25 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"I've only had this problem with Andrew--at first, and that was mainly 'cause I didn't expect him. Everyone else I was able to pick out right away.   Maybe it's just me, but I though the artists did a really good job on trying to get the older characters to look like their actors on the show, and keeping the newer characters are fairly contrasted from one another."
buffy,307o7v,sorcerousmike,4,Wed Mar 25 15:32:51 2015 UTC,I own but have not yet read Season 8 and this makes me a little sad.   I read Spike: Shadow Puppets (or whatever it's called) that is sort of a sequel to an Angel episode (Smile Time) and at one point I looked at a frame for like five minutes trying to figure out who two characters were. Then I turned the page and context made it immediately clear lol.   I thought maybe it was just cause I've never really read comics or graphic novels before and I thought it was like an acquired skill haha

I dislike Georges Jeanty's artwork for specifically that reason; I have no idea who I'm looking at. That problem continued into season nine for me. The first time Riley showed up in that season, I had no idea it was him and thought Buffy had just met some random stranger.  As many others have noted, however, this goes away once you reach season ten. Rebekah Isaacs is a hugely talented artist, and her work on ""Buffy"" and ""Angel & Faith"" is gorgeous. You'll never be confused about who you're looking at again (or at least I wasn't)!"

Though to be fair, not all of my problems are due to the art... I'm just not a big comic fan, so I think some of it is just lost on me."
buffy,307o7v,faaackksake,2,Wed Mar 25 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"it's riley, but yeah i kind of agree, overall i quite like the artwork but the artists seem to vary wildly on how well they draw the faces of characters, although i would say the longer you read them the easier it gets."

She says ""Ethan Rayne?"" and then in the next panel we are shown his face, and he confirms he is indeed Ethan Rayne. As for your comment below saying you were wondering why Buffy would care about this random dude, I was thinking maybe you didn't recognize him after Buffy finds him shot, but before she breaks into his cell she once again says his name."

Edit: I also want to clarify that I'm not complaining about the art. For me, these were two instances in which the art was unclear, but in general, I think the style is a good fit for the story."

He gave Joss a 7 year window (and I think that was around 2000, while Buffy was still filming). Somewhere, in an alternate reality, my doppelganger got to watch a 5 season Spike spin-off. I hate that bitch.    Would you ever consider returning to the role of Spike?  I told Joss a long time ago that if he wanted to film me doing Spike, he had seven years to do it because one of the coolest things about being a vampire is they don’t age. If we could find a way where we could still have the character not age while I’m playing it, whether that be make up effects or computer effects or have the character in his vampire makeup the whole time, but what I don’t want to do is have an aging Spike apologetically telling Buffy that he’s under some aging spell."

buffy,2zylf4,chinola,16,Mon Mar 23 03:31:48 2015 UTC,Did we ever see Giles' cat? I feel like I'd remember something as awesome as that

buffy,2zylf4,GinaZaneburritos,12,Mon Mar 23 03:48:29 2015 UTC,Probably considered a weakness to Buffy because it's said later in her college years when Riley is trying to get to know her that she loves cheese.  Edit: Oh my gosh suddenly the cheese man from the crazy first slayer dream episode makes sense too. Chick is craycray for cheese.

buffy,2zylf4,heymeowmeow,9,Mon Mar 23 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the reason is he's a weakness is because that means Cordelia is unavailable and thus ""not worth it"" to some guys/unavailable to bribe guys for votes with promises of dates/flirtation etc.  Also, since Harmony and her Cordettes don't respect Cordy for dating Xander as evidenced by that scene where they try to hook her up with Jonathan because he's ""just her type""."

buffy,2zylf4,GinaZaneburritos,3,Mon Mar 23 12:53:18 2015 UTC,"Dating Xander is terrible for her image as queen bee   I think that's why he's on there, too.

That being said, I've seen people with walls of these unopened and hung on their wall and that's the best way to appreciate these figures imo. Because opening them leads to them breaking easily and the paint chipping, and people noticing how awful the molds actually are. (I think some can't even stand correctly outside of the package)"

buffy,2zuxeg,xroadsgambler,62,Sun Mar 22 00:33:23 2015 UTC,As someone who has never studied Latin I got the joke the first time.  I mean it has incinderae = incindiary = incinerate   Librum = Library? = books... or alternate path it sounds just like libram which is an off hand item that looks like a book in warcraft.  Do people really know so little about words?
buffy,2zuxeg,joshychrist,10,Sun Mar 22 04:59:32 2015 UTC,librum = libro = book incinderae = incendiar = on fire  book on fire

buffy,2zuxeg,chaoticpix93,6,Sun Mar 22 09:10:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly many words in English do come from Latin in a round about way. There are French, Norse, Germanic, Anglo-Saxon words etc... and so many other places. I don't know /r/linguistics but I do know that English steals from many languages.

buffy,2zuxeg,taigahalla,5,Sun Mar 22 10:57:25 2015 UTC,"""Incendere"" is actually also the second-person singular present passive imperative of incendō. So it means ""be burned/be set on fire!"""

buffy,2zwtu8,TheGreatHuman,8,Sun Mar 22 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"If the comics were completely ignored and we rejoin Buffy and co. 10 years later...  I think that we'd see Buffy taking on the mentor role to a small handful of slayers as her inner circle.  Other slayers would be out there, but they're working on ""pest control"" - the vampires, demons, and other minor supernatural threats.  She'd be teaching her inner circle what she knows about bigger threats like gods, hellmouths, and apocalypses.  Xander owns a construction company that has a consultant to help demon-proof their buildings.  Think feng shui + magic style stuff...like the building faces north, windows go there, a priest consecrates this, set up magic wards at every door, etc.  For the past ten years, it's been successful - no demons in these buildings.  With this track record, Buffy hires the company to build various safehouses for her slayers.  But then they are overrun!  Why is the magic no working anymore?  Who is this mysterious consultant after all?  How can they stop demons from killing slayers right when they think they are safe at home?  Is this all part of a larger demon conspiracy? (yes it totally is)"

buffy,2zwtu8,proindrakenzol,3,Tue Mar 24 15:16:57 2015 UTC,Have you tried reading the comics? Because we're on Season 10 now.
buffy,2zwtu8,danielle_kb,7,Sun Mar 22 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yes I have, and they're enjoyable. However, it is reasonable to assume that the series would take place several years after the comics as Buffy is only 26 in the comics. I also think that they have pushed comic book Buffy into becoming a different character than the one portrayed by SMG. SHe takes more risks, seems more lost and has a greater journey to go to reach self actualisation. I had the feeling throughout the television series that Buffy grew as a character in each progressive series, becoming more responsible, more grown up, and better adjusted. I feel that the comic book Buffy had the reset button pushed on her a little bit as they had to leave room for her to grow and become a grown up all over again.   If Buffy had continued as a television series I don't think the character played by SMG would have gone through the development arcs or issues and predicaments as comic book Buffy. For example, I know SMG was not comfortable with the fact that Buffy had had a lesbian encounter in the comics when questioned about it, I don't think Dawn would have been turned into a giant and I don't think we would be dealing with the same recycled characters and plot motifs. Throw in the fact that the characters are making cultural references that scatter the Buffyverse clock all over the place (referencing Daniel Craig as James Bond in season 8 for example which should have been 2004) and I think you'll agree that any potential reboot on television would need to take its cues from season 7.  What I would love to see would be a series that respects the length of time that has passed for all the characters in the 10 years since season 7 and one that manages to deal with the characters as grown ups and the difficulties they face. I wouldn't want Buffy relegated to watcher role, I would like to see a Buffy who's living through life as best she can with the slayer role still pressing on her. I would definitely like the scope of the series to be smaller than the comic books and to focus back on Buffy as the chosen one."
buffy,2zwtu8,AngelAmongUs,3,Sun Mar 22 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"I feel that the comic book Buffy had the reset button pushed on her a little bit as they had to leave room for her to grow and become a grown up all over again.   Perhaps, but I have gone through phases in my adult life when I feel as if the reset button has been pushed. Things that make me feel completely non-adjusted, irresponsible, and not at all grown up. It seems with Buffy in the comics, an argument could be made for this very thing... At thirty years old, I still need room to grow and become a grown up all over again."
buffy,2zwtu8,AngelAmongUs,4,Mon Mar 23 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"I know SMG was not comfortable with the fact that Buffy had had a lesbian encounter in the comics when questioned about it.

I've discussed the subpar art before (mainly just inconsistent characters), but now that I'm further into the comics, I'm more confident that the story is crap too. It feels like they just throw in as many elements from left field as possible, no matter how little sense they make. The entire plot is disjointed and bizarre."
buffy,2zwtu8,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I like things how they ended. I'd be perfectly content if Buffy wasn't brought to life for the third time.   If there was going to be an extension of the Buffyverse brought to television again, it'd have some very, very big shoes to fill in terms of making anything that would equal the greatness of the first run of the series.   To that, I'd rather see the 'verse where there's a bunch of Slayers running around, but now Buffy could be a watcher or sorts and Xander and Willow could be there too if the roles were written well.   It would be a pretty tricky thing to pull off. Maybe a better concept would be to make Fray. That would be a direct extension of the Buffyverse and you could start with all new characters."
buffy,2zwtu8,purplenat,2,Sun Mar 22 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth I would want Buffy, Spike, and Angel to make up the centre of any new series. The chemistry between Spike and Angel in season 5 of Angel was excellent and I think the dichotomy between their immortality and Buffy's life path would be really interesting to explore. A Buffy with a new Riley-style liberal and understanding husband (and children) would be fun and poignant to play off of Spike's corrosive intensity. I would retire Willow to a mentor watcher role as I feel her character was irrevocably compromised in later seasons and Xander would have died in an unfortunate canoeing accident."
buffy,2zviwr,ThatDamonGuy99,24,Sun Mar 22 04:16:01 2015 UTC,"Wrecked.  Willow's addiction to magic is my least favorite plot line of the series. The ""magic = drugs"" metaphor was extremely blunt, and I hated that she went to a magic dealer to get her fix. It was fine when it was stuff like her abusing magic when she didn't have to or wiping Tara's memories because it was easier than apologizing, but making it the same as hard drugs was silly."
buffy,2zviwr,Gneissisnice,4,Sun Mar 22 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't really have an issue with the ""magic=drugs"" metaphor, mostly since we got Dark Willow out of the deal, but I do agree that the whole part about her going to Rack took it a step too far. I think they could have made the same point without that and while it wouldn't by any means be subtle, it wouldn't push it so far over the top."
buffy,2zviwr,withdelight,8,Sun Mar 22 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my main issue was how blunt it was. Rack really was the tipping point for me.   Things could have happened the same way without him: Willow begins to rely on magic for mundane things, Tara gets annoyed and they fight, Willow wipes her memory and she finds out and breaks up with her. She tries to quit magic and reconciles with Tara, only for Tara to die, causing Dark Willow. We could have done without the over the top metaphor."
buffy,2zviwr,Gneissisnice,2,Mon Mar 23 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"This is right, Willow and her story was very good but the Rack was too much."
buffy,2zviwr,ithinkmynameismoose,21,Tue Mar 24 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"The episode where Adam kills Maggie. I think Adam would have been a more interesting villain if he had been directed by Maggie, who was clearly much smarter and much more sinister."
buffy,2zviwr,catdoctor,8,Sun Mar 22 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"I could see an argument for Maggie being more sinister, especially in light of the whole ""road to hell is paved with good intentions"" thing, but I don't really see Maggie as smarter. Adam can just upload any information he wants into his ""brain"" and, while he does have emotions and longings, they're more rudimentary and simple and they don't get in the way of his intellect the way I think they do for Maggie."
buffy,2zviwr,heymeowmeow,7,Sun Mar 22 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"Word on the street is that that was the plan, but the actress quit the show, so she had to be written out."
buffy,2zviwr,LarsP,7,Sun Mar 22 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"Q: Okay, now I have a bunch of really geeky questions about plot points… Maggie Walsh was supposed to be the big bad of season four, but Lindsay Crouse was unavailable – that’s one rumor I heard. Is that true?  Marti Noxon: Yes, that’s true. That is actually true.  Q: Do you know what she would have done or did you never get that far with the plans?  Marti Noxon: No, we never got that far."
buffy,2zviwr,AngelAmongUs,6,Mon Mar 23 03:38:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I always thought killing such a great villain was dumb. Now I know why.   Had she lived I would have probably really liked season 4. Maggie was pure evil.
buffy,2zviwr,TheGreatHuman,29,Mon Mar 23 21:31:46 2015 UTC,It has to be 'Where The WIld Things Are' for me (otherwise known as the one where Buffy and Riley can't stop having sex for an entire episode while everyone else tries to save them). I guess it was meant to follow the successful and creepy haunted house episodes that had worked previously but for me this one just didn't work at all.   First off there is no way you can empathise with Buffy or Riley when they are taking up half of your episode time with some frankly cringe worthy PG-13 sex scenes and endangering everyone else. Oh and the big bad in the episode was repressed teenage sexuality. Just terrible.
buffy,2zviwr,deathbynotsurprise,3,Sun Mar 22 15:44:30 2015 UTC,I love this episode for the scene where Anya gets a vine punched through her hand and rips it out like a badass.

buffy,2zviwr,nutbastard,7,Sun Mar 22 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"Also, without the attempted rape Spike probably would not try to reclaim his soul, so in truth too many things in this episode are key to the series. After further thought removing it to save Tara cause too many other problems."
buffy,2zviwr,withdelight,15,Sun Mar 22 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"Seeing Red was my first instinct; every time I get to Seeing Red, I am filled with nervous energy hoping that just this once the stray bullet will miss her. But as you've already pointed out, the ripples from losing this episode are too numerous.   We'd lose: 1. Dark Willow 2. Spike's soul 3. Spike eventually saving the world via hero's journey/amulet 4. Giles using magic to fight Willow 5. Willow using the coven's white magic to empower all the potentials after her magic rehab    Probably a lot more I'm not immediately thinking of.   If I had to get rid of an episode completely I'd choose Superstar, as I often skip it during rewatches and don't feel like I'm missing any big important plot thingies by doing so."

buffy,2zviwr,Mollywobbles222,5,Sun Mar 22 14:17:18 2015 UTC,No argument for or against the plot line. Just a cornment that the writers used it to justify Spike's quest to reclaim his soul.
buffy,2zviwr,HelloIAmHawt,5,Sun Mar 22 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Much as I love John Ritter, I hated ""Ted."" It just feels to me like it doesn't fit in the series - at first I thought it was because of the robot thing, but I didn't have an issue with April or Buffybot later, so I think it was just the episode in general. It doesn't feel like the same show."
buffy,2zviwr,nutbastard,4,Sun Mar 22 23:32:49 2015 UTC,"I really love Ted.  This is this first time we see Buffy loose control, take things a little too far.  We know Ted's not a great guy, but we also think he's human, so when she ""kills"" him, it's a big deal.  I know it's not for everyone, but I really love that one."

buffy,2zviwr,BlackMoonWolf3113,5,Fri Mar 27 11:29:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I want to say Wild at Heart, because it breaks my heart every time and makes me really angry with Oz, who is one of my favourite characters. I would have loved for Oz to stick around, although then obviously Willow's relationship with Tara would've unfolded very differently. Maybe Willow would have met Tara and fallen in love with her while still romantically linked to Oz, which might've been interesting...  Edited to add that I really hate Veruca as a character. I mean, I know we're supposed to hate her, because she's a trampy, wolfy homewrecker, but ugh. She's so awful. Everything about her, her face, her voice, just irritates the hell out of me."
buffy,2zviwr,queenie504,4,Mon Mar 23 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"I'd have to get rid of ""Normal Again"". I absolutely 100% LOVED this episode. I've watched the series 10 + times and this is one of the episodes I've seen more because I was in the mood to watch them out of turn. Seriously, brilliantly done, it's a mind fuck.   BUT. If I had the chance to yell at Joss Whedon, ever, this would be the episode I would be harping on.   Because, fuck you! Now I question everything. Is the series the world we want it to be, or in the mind of a crazy? This is almost as bad as Dawn.   Also, if we could just erase Dawn."
buffy,2zviwr,choketheboys,11,Tue Mar 24 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"Beer Bad, just because beer clearly good and it added nothing to canon. Except Buffy whacking Parker on the head which was pretty great."

buffy,2zviwr,pondweedrustandstard,3,Mon Mar 23 09:57:10 2015 UTC,"I love Beer Bad, one of my favorite episodes to revisit. Xander as the bartender is too funny to pass up. Cave Buffy and Parker come to an understanding. She saves his life and then immediately bops him on the head with her stick. The most succinctly told love story told on the show!   (I'm kidding about the love story)  Seriously though, I love how the writing comes full circle, with Buffy fantasizing in the beginning of the ep about saving Parker's life, and then she actually saves him at the end. Plus, as the audience I just want to punch Parker in the face. So the writers brought us that tasty justice when Buffy hits him on the head.  Also, I love Willow when she stands up to Parker and basically tells him how lame he is."
buffy,2zviwr,L-U-N-C-H,7,Fri Mar 27 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"Seeing Red - I would still keep the ideas of the episode just do them differently.  I'd still make Spike do something he'd regret to or with Buffy so that he'd go to get his soul (not sure WHAT), but not what happened in the show. And I'd still find a way for Willow to go ham by having someone harm Tara (maybe Tara is shot but ends up in a coma and she senses Willow is using dark magic to save her and resists?). So that the ripples in that episode could continue.  And then I'd have Dawn or something be the person to wake Tara up via talking about how much they need her, and have TARA be the one to give the yellow crayon speech (but less fluffy and more grounded about Willow getting her shit together because of course Tara has always loved her and that she's never going to stop and Willow please stop I love you because this isn't who you are). And then have Tara go off with Willow when she leaves during the few episodes in season 7 when she's gone. And then have them return together. And have them BOTH cast the spell at the end of season 7."
buffy,2zviwr,queenie504,10,Sun Mar 22 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think Xander giving the Yellow crayon speech was important because it really drives home why Xander is even there.  He is the heart of the group.  He doesn't have super powers or magic or any of that.  He just loves the girls and keeps them grounded in a way that makes him his own kind of hero.  It sucks that Tara died but I think any other way it wouldn't really be ENOUGH tragedy.  I do agree about the spike thing.  I read an interview with James Marsters where he explains the writer's intent in the scene.  It was supposed to be a sort of ""if we just have sex again she'll remember she loves me"" but since the genders were reversed from her scenario and because Spike is the only person strong enough to really overpower Buffy in that way, there was no way to translate the scene other than attempted rape."
buffy,2zviwr,yallcat,7,Sun Mar 22 17:47:03 2015 UTC,That's true. Tara giving it was mostly my inner romantic speaking lmao (and I'm willing to admit that).   And if that was their intent it really did translate badly. I mostly just want to redo that whole bit because I do think there is another way for him to want to get his Soul without resorting to what happened.

buffy,2zviwr,Mollywobbles222,3,Wed Mar 25 00:15:41 2015 UTC,Beer Bad.  That was an awful episode.  I think there was a commentary for that episode where the writer admits it's a low point in the series.
buffy,2zviwr,jtreezy,2,Sun Mar 22 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"Bad Eggs from season two. Just pure filler, and, dare I say it, a bit dull.  Back when I had the VHS tapes, this cassette unravelled and I couldn't watch it any more. I wasn't exactly upset.  I could also do without Doublemeat Palace from season six. I didn't enjoy the suggestion that no university education equals dead-end life. And the penis demon was just dreadful.  Edit: missing word."

The rest of the episode, though - yeah, not so great..."
buffy,2zviwr,DigitalBathRx,-1,Mon Mar 23 19:32:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe Nightmares, having buffy become a vamp and have vampire strength and then have it disappear is not really consistent with the mythology of the show. Not that I hate the episode though. After that the only thing i can think of would be to decanonize Dawn or Tara completely."
buffy,2zviwr,choketheboys,8,Sun Mar 22 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"The worst thing about Tara is she made Willow and instant lesbian.  Even though she previously had a real relationship with Oz who she was sexually attracted to and loved and she longed for Xander for, you know, her whole life.  Suddenly she was ""girls only"" just because Tara. That's stupid.  Every prior indication lends itself to Willow being bisexual.  So the constant reminders to her that ""you don't play for that team anymore"" are just stupid.  Oh, also every time Willow said ""baby"" annoyed me.  Like she became the whiniest girlfriend ever with Tara.  At least with Oz she seemed like a strong person."
buffy,2zviwr,DaddyCatALSO,16,Sun Mar 22 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that I thought it was weird that she was an instant lesbian to the audience after meeting Tara.  But, in real life, that's sort of how it happens for a lot of gays.  I was straight (I thought) until the very first woman.  After that there was really no turning back. It wasn't even a thought.   But there wasn't anything in the show to explain that so you have a good point."
buffy,2zviwr,nunudeen,11,Sun Mar 22 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was weird. That happened to me as well. I had a boyfriend who I had strong feelings for, but once I realized I liked girls there was just no going back to boys. It happens."
buffy,2zviwr,ithinkmynameismoose,10,Sun Mar 22 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"Ya know, a lot of people say this about Willow's self-identification as a lesbian... but I don't understand it.  Her interest in girls was foreshadowed several times in season 3. In ""Doppelgangland"", according to Angel, turning vamp ignites the most deep-seated desires one has. And Faith, who likes to play at being dumb, but who is actually exceptionally intuitive, was the first to pick up on Willow's relationship with Tara in ""Who Are You."" This specific moment was also referencing a non-verbal foreshadow that Faith made in season 3. When she found out Willow was with Oz, she made a confused face. I can't for the life of me remember exactly what episode, though.  Edit: Also, this is how it happened for me. I dated men. Believed myself to be straight. Until one day I realized I wasn't. That I had always been attracted to women, but tried to dismiss those feelings initially. Believe it or not, sexual proclivities and preferences can evolve over time. Or just be delayed in maturing. Honestly, I think a lot of the people who call this bi-erasure are just too hung up on labels. Can we just be happy that a same sex relationship was portrayed so positively (without being all sexed up) in the freaking 90's?"
buffy,2zviwr,jtreezy,2,Sun Mar 22 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"It WOULD be fine if it was her own attitude BUT every time she said anything about a man being attractive after that someone had to jump out and be like ""remember Will, you like GIRLS"" like it wasnt up to her who she was into (granted, some of those occasions had to do with some weird ass hellmouth activity) but even vamp Will didn't seem completely single-minded to me."

I also completely agree about the weird immediate shift to 'girls only,' it constantly bothers me. I comfort myself sometimes with the thought that she simply could never be with another man after Oz, but that would be belittling to Tara and every other girl Willow had feelings for, so it's definitely not the case. Anyway, it just felt off to have that complete shift in sexuality happen, so I completely agree with you."
buffy,2zv2jp,capaldithenewblack,17,Sun Mar 22 01:25:09 2015 UTC,I felt like they were mocking him and his approach. Kind of reinforcing the point Buff made in the season 4 finale about how the military were in over their heads.
buffy,2zv2jp,dimechimes,2,Sun Mar 22 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't read this way to me, but I like this explanation much better. It makes more sense with the rest of the series."
buffy,2zv2jp,yallcat,3,Sun Mar 22 02:20:10 2015 UTC,Maybe not quite mocking but they definitely thought he was going further than necessary.
buffy,2zv2jp,KiraKira_,10,Sun Mar 22 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"I think it fits pretty well.  True, the scoobies have fought solo, but they're most used to being with Buffy and socializing on the job.  See: The Freshman where Willow is causally helping Buffy pick her classes while Buffy is waiting on a vamp to rise.  Meanwhile Riley is used to being all business while patrolling."
buffy,2zv2jp,yallcat,2,Sun Mar 22 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"True, but they sure seemed to know they had to be serious (or try to be) when they were killing vamps without her."
buffy,2zv2jp,Tahedoz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:49:31 2015 UTC,"Riley was a pretty decent substitute for Buffy in terms of effectiveness, so that patrol wasn't like in Anne when they were alone."
buffy,2zv2jp,Mquestionmark,4,Sun Mar 22 16:12:47 2015 UTC,I'm actually with you on this. I felt that was disrespectful to Riley (as if they wanted to mock him) and was not something I would have picture the scoobies do.  But maybe we're giving this too much credit: this scene was probably just here for comical purpose :)
buffy,2zv2jp,imagine_allthepeople,2,Sun Mar 22 14:23:15 2015 UTC,I think it was mostly forced for comedic purposes to offset how serious the Buffy/Spike thing was getting.  also they are used to cracking jokes/being somewhat silly in times of danger and probably weren't used to anyone taking vampires seriously at this point.
buffy,2zv2jp,imagine_allthepeople,2,Mon Mar 23 11:28:56 2015 UTC,"Haha did you just watch this on TV last week?  I believe on the channel Pivot?  I just watched it last week as well, and I was all excited because...well...Spike.  However, I completely forgot about this part.  I was laughing more than I would like to admit at them eating chips.  I completely agree with /u/Mquestionmark on both points.  Something did seem off about it when I was watching it (which is why it is funny that you posted this after I watched), but I felt like they were there to exaggerate Riley's behavior.  He was acting all army and tough in a situation that he maybe didn't have to be so tough in.  They were there to further detract from the seriousness of the situation. It just made Riley more ridiculous."

buffy,2zu5v8,Ashton42,5,Sun Mar 22 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out Angel. I haven't actually finished either series yet, though (season 7 of Buffy, 4 of Angel currently); they happen at the same time and they cross over at times. It hasn't been as great on the whole, but there's a lot to love about it, particularly the characters. It definitely has two of the best Buffyverse characters (Wes returns from season 3 of Buffy, and newcomer Fred is amazing), and it eventually stars Spike as well. Plus, Angel is much more fleshed out in this series and he develops into a much more enjoyable character. Cordelia is in it as well, and she's actually pretty awesome; if you found her annoying in Buffy, she definitely develops into a stronger all-around character here.   Story-wise, it's got its ups-and-downs. It experiments a lot less than Buffy did (though I've been told season 5 does a bit of that), and it tries to be darker/grittier, though it hasn't reached the level that season 6 of Buffy got to [yet].   If you're craving more, that's where I'd start. There's also the comics, which I haven't gotten to, but at least for the canon stuff, it's best you've seen Angel by that point."
buffy,2zu5v8,LaunchpadMacQ,2,Sun Mar 22 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"As well as the canon ongoing comics you can get the 'omnibuses' which are the collection of comics which Dark Horse released just as season 8 came out. They were all made when the show originally aired, and handily split into 7 parts, so each one runs parallel to each season. They're pretty cheap (I got mine from £3-5 each) and they're all about 300 pages long."
buffy,2zu5v8,thosefilthyhobbitses,-7,Sun Mar 22 12:12:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly don't bother with the comics. Or the motion comics, which are not voiced by the original actors.  Just take it as is and let go.  Maybe some of the non-canon novels are good, but I haven't looked into it. My guess is that it's all poor imitations of Joss.  Angel is the way to go if you really care about the universe, but be warned that the first season is almost unwatchable. It does get very, very better later though. Then crappy again for a while.

IIRC Buffy said to willow (when they were fighting glory) in S5 that Wil was the only one that had even slowed her down. Buffy's ultimate advantage was a magical hammer. Keyword being magical.   IMHO ""magic"" was the only thing that stood a chance against Glory. Dark Willow would have ended Glorificus faster than you can say ""that'll put marzipan in your pie plate bingo""."

buffy,2zr47c,heymeowmeow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:04:47 2015 UTC,I try to incorporate buffyisms into my life as often as possible.
buffy,2zr47c,Beigenoise,34,Wed Mar 25 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but I don't entirely understand what you're getting at.  Are you suggesting there was some kind of connection between Ben and Glory?"
buffy,2zr47c,bookant,11,Sat Mar 21 16:02:02 2015 UTC,whoosh
buffy,2zr47c,JVortex888,14,Sun Mar 22 10:08:28 2015 UTC,"Despite calling her a god, they didn't really do much in the show to explain how that made her particularly different from a demon, power-wise.  So who knows..."
buffy,2zr47c,marpocky,17,Sun Mar 22 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"I think she was the god in her home dimension she was trying to open the portal to. Like she was omnipotent there and has always existed there from the beginning of that dimension. No other entity made her, where as demons are created by other entities."
buffy,2zr47c,captainpostal,3,Sat Mar 21 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"Like she was omnipotent there and has always existed there from the beginning of that dimension.   Obviously not completely omnipotent (which I guess technically means not ""omnipotent"" at all) since the other hell gods were able to banish her to Earth."
buffy,2zr47c,CJGibson,2,Sat Mar 21 07:26:01 2015 UTC,Part of her transition to earth and imprisonment in Ben was the loss of most of her powers.
buffy,2zr47c,DaddyCatALSO,13,Sat Mar 21 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"As long as we're nerding out, I sometimes wonder if Dark Willow might have been able to do a large scale version of the reverse-mind-eating spell that she did on Glory and Tara, and just completely drain Glory of all of her sanity."
buffy,2zr47c,wowyesokay,22,Sat Mar 21 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"If we're nerding out, let's just paraphrase the ultimate nerd:  ""Darth Rosenberg would grind Glorificus to jawaburgers, and none of her minions would have the midichloriens to stop it."""
buffy,2zr47c,TheBlueDanNoob,17,Sat Mar 21 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"""You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?"""
buffy,2zr47c,Cindy_Lou_Who,7,Sat Mar 21 10:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah,I think what it boils down to is whether or not Willow could pump enough magical damage into Glory in order to force her to revert to Ben. I think Dark Willow is powerful enough that the magic involved in the transformation (some sort of confusion/memory effect) wouldnt affect her. She'd then likely suck whatever magic power she could out of Ben/Glory and then kill whatevers left"
buffy,2zr47c,mgiblue21,7,Sat Mar 21 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"While Glory was a significant to Buffy, Buffy was mostly human with some enhanced abilities and plot-armor. Glory didn't see all that powerful in the grand scheme of things, even though they made her out to be.  I think it was the limitations of being trapped in a human body, I think Dark Willow could have easily blinked her into a fine red mist.  I mean the hammer that pretty much defeated her was only even owned by a ""god"" that was actually created by one of the Scooby Gang (Anya) before she was even a demon, when she was just a witch.  Anya herself has shown the ability to completely alter reality.  Which makes me realize, no one in the Buffyverse is actually very powerful.  Dark Willow comes closest, maybe the Powers That Be...but they have a strict sit on our ass and do nothing policy."
buffy,2zr47c,AmantisAsoko,3,Sat Mar 21 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they avoided the power creep well enough, except for Willow, for whom they always had to find convenient reasons for her not to kick ass in season 7. But otherwise, everyone remains rather grounded. The comic is another story though."
buffy,2zr47c,PL-QC,2,Sat Mar 21 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"Anya only turned Olaf intoa  troll. Any god status he achieved on his own. As trolls go, he's probably a genius."
buffy,2zr47c,DaddyCatALSO,7,Sat Mar 21 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"Glory cannot be killed and Dark Willow can be killed, but Dark Willow could probably open a portal to some hell dimension and push Glory through it."
buffy,2zr47c,captainpostal,2,Sat Mar 21 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"whoops, I just repeated exactly what you said, sorry."
buffy,2zr47c,monkeymosh88,7,Sat Mar 21 07:29:26 2015 UTC,"I got money on Dark Willow.  Even though season 6 was a rough go for me that I barely got through, because of how generally dark and depressing it was and the lack of a bad guy until the end part (Warren, Jonathan, and Andrew were jackasses and wrecked some stuff, but they were never really a genuine threat, and killing Tara was kind of a giant fluke. I couldn't get into it.) I always felt Willow was the strongest of all the big bads. Even the First with it's giant underground army seemed lame in comparison."
buffy,2zr47c,Mquestionmark,13,Sat Mar 21 10:48:51 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that Buffy ""defeated"" Glory pretty handily, and Dark Willow ""defeated"" Buffy pretty handily, I'd put my money on Dark Willow."
buffy,2zr47c,foyboy,25,Sat Mar 21 11:06:02 2015 UTC,So Dark Willow's greatest power is the use of the Transitive Property.
buffy,2zr47c,MisterGibs,12,Sat Mar 21 02:48:31 2015 UTC,well willow was amazing at math!
buffy,2zr47c,ModerateBias,6,Sat Mar 21 10:42:37 2015 UTC,BTW: Did Willow ever get her Bachelor's?
buffy,2zr47c,MisterGibs,4,Sat Mar 21 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"not read the comics, so dunno.  but if we follow just the show, no.  she was in her fourth year when the town stopped functioning."
buffy,2zr47c,ModerateBias,12,Sat Mar 21 10:53:09 2015 UTC,Interviewer: I see here that you never completed your Bachelor's program. Can you tell me more about that?  Willow: The city where I went to school stopped functioning in my senior year.
buffy,2zr47c,foyboy,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:58:18 2015 UTC,Her overall record wa s probably so good that she and any number of other student s in similar positions were presumably awarded their degrees by the Cal State Univ system
buffy,2zr47c,DaddyCatALSO,4,Sat Mar 21 12:24:12 2015 UTC,"Willow was able to set Glory back - a little. And Dark Willow was very powerful. BUT Dark Willow was slowed down considerably by Giles channeling the magic from a coven of human witches. Also, Dark Willow seemed to tire quickly; she had to go to Rack to ""re-charge."" Glory never had to re-charge and she would have been only mildly inconvenienced by the coven. Sorry to all those rooting for Dark Willow, but I think if it were just the two of them facing off, Dark Willow would be an Ex-Willow in fairly short order."
buffy,2zr47c,catdoctor,7,Sat Mar 21 19:20:19 2015 UTC,Glory did have to recharge though. She had to suck people's minds
buffy,2zr47c,sjbigs,3,Sat Mar 21 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, draining Giles speeded DarkWillow way up -to a suicidal-genocidal rage, admittedly, but up. Given Glory's limitations on earth, she could possibly be drained like rack was."
buffy,2zr47c,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Mar 21 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"Season 6  Dark Willow vs a mostly depowered (though still powerful) god? I'd put my money on Willow. Even back in season 5 before she was all ridiculously overpowered she was still able to hold her own against her for a short time.  Considering everything we've seen her do since that fight, I think she could wipe the floor with her.  I'd rather see a fight of Comic Willow vs a fully empowered Glory. That'd be fun."
buffy,2zr47c,sorcerousmike,2,Sat Mar 21 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"Gods are immortal so Willow can't kill her, perhaps she might have the power to banish her to another dimension?"
buffy,2zr47c,monkeymosh88,2,Sat Mar 21 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"dark willow at the point you describe her ? i say she loses, (but then again buffy does force glory to revert to ben just using the troll hammer and her own strength iirc and i can;t imagine the troll hammer has anywehere near the the level of destructive power dark willow has, so that's always an option. plus i bet there are a hell of a lot of reality altering and sealing spells that could completely incapacitate if not kill glory, hell if she'd been that strong in the climax of season 5 i wouldn't be surprised if she could stop the apocalypse single handedly, but i don't think dark willow would be inclinded to do so.) but on raw power i'd say glory wins. but later versions of willow, as she is in the comics for example, would absolutely kerb stomp glory, with no contest, imo.  love this question btw, good post!"
buffy,2zr47c,faaackksake,2,Sat Mar 21 10:47:35 2015 UTC,"People forget that Ben held Glory back from obliterating the Scoobies. Ben didn't care for the Knights and they were wiped out in about 4 seconds. As soon as Ben realizes that Dark Willow is going for the kill, an uninhibited Glory knocks Willow into orbit."
buffy,2zr47c,norrin__radd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"One punch is all it would have taken for Glory to end Dark Willow. You're all overestimating Dark Willow's power since it was big and flashy. However Glory would have taken Dark Willow's head off with a single heavy punch, and given the goddesses' enhanced speed, endurance and agility it's likely she would have been able to land that blow fairly quickly. Especially considering she beat the piss out of an enraged Willow without really breaking a sweat just one season earlier. Willow high on dark magic and rage wouldn't have stopped Glory. You're also ignoring the fact that she was a very powerful magic user in her own right."
buffy,2zr47c,Iokuas,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"Glory would easily win, Dark Willow is the most overrated being in the whole show in terms of power.   Glory was insanely strong, near invulnerable, Incredibly fast, was a very capable magician herself and made the slayer look like a joke. Dark Willow is powerful, not going to deny that but her powers are so overrated. The only true impressive feat Dark Willow could do was the flaying thing and I don't think that would work on Glory. Whats the worst she could do Glory? Push her back with energy? throw fireballs at her? I don't see that damaging Glory too much. Willow was actually defeated by Giles and if she was a typical big bad, extreme methods such as decapitation should do the trick.   Glory could just go into fast mode and 'rip Willow's spine out before she could take a half a step' and be done with it. Dark Willow could put up a fight against Glory but will ultimately fall short.   Also, Why does everyone say Dark Willow could end the world in one spell? This isn't the case at all. Willow had to channel energy to activate a Goddess power that would drain the worlds life force and burn it too a crisp. It is the exact same circumstance as Angelus using Acathla to end the world. They were both the triggers for the Apocalypse, not the true power behind it."
buffy,2zr47c,Jayman3977,14,Mon Mar 23 03:33:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I first watched it when it was actually on. . . and it IS the best show ever made. . ."
buffy,2zrtb4,Schwartezz,5,Sat Mar 21 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Mmm I may have teared up during Prophecy Girl in season 1 when Buffy overhears Giles and Angel talking in the library and proceeds to freak. But you're right, season 1 isn't very emotional to me.   I cried at the end of season 6 when Xander talks dark Willow down but seeing people cry usually makes me cry, and Willow does some awesome crying in that scene.   Don't think I cried in season 7.  Man. Angel death scene in season 2. I sometimes cry just thinking about it. Recently did a re-watch with my brother in law and cried again. I wonder if it's actually the saddest thing in the show (to me) or if it's an emotional teenage-time in my life that I think back to. I was also huge into the Buffy-Angel relationship back then and it just broke my heart. Also, add some Sarah McLachlan to a sad scene and tears are inevitable."
buffy,2zrtb4,Sassafrass23,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"I can't even listen to that song without bawling. It kills me every time, but I love it."
buffy,2zrtb4,imagine_allthepeople,3,Thu Mar 26 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, the only time I cried in the series was in ""The Body"", but I have a feeling that's less to do with the writing and more to do with my inability to display emotion."
buffy,2zrtb4,Sammyboy616,3,Sun Mar 22 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"The finale makes me cry because there's just a lot of sentimentality to it.  In the school hallway before the core Scoobies split up to take battle stations when Buffy is like ""so what do you guys want to do tomorrow?"" and they have their little ramble then the ""kids"" walk off and Giles says ""The world is definitely doomed"" which is what he said in the end of the pilot. TEARS  Pretty much every scene with Buffy and spike in this episode gets me.  And Anya, poor Anya who we watched for the past 3 seasons grappling with what humanity is.  She finally figures it out and goes down swinging, bunnies and all.  There are some other moment's in season 7 that get me too.  Mostly Buffy/Giles BUffy/Spike scenes.  As for other seasons.  1) No tears really 2) Tears when Angelus kills Jenny and when Buffy had to kill Angel after everything. 3) When Giles gives Buffy the speech after he finds out about Angel being back. 4) The premise of season 4 kind of annoyed me too much for there to be any crying. 5) Everyone knows season 5 was the saddest season ever. 6) Tara, Buffy's revelation to Spike about where she came from.  EDIT: Oh and if you ever need some serious tears, just watch any Buffy/Giles scene compilation video on youtube. YOU. WILL. SOB."

I have no idea how I'm so unobservant."
buffy,2zrtb4,osburnn,2,Wed Mar 25 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I suspect this would be different for everyone :)  I wouldn't necessarily say that seasons 6 and 7 have fewer ""tear-jerker"" episodes, but they might evoke different emotions than earlier seasons.   I would characterize ""Hell's Bells"" as a potential tear-jerker. Also ""Seeing Red,"" ""Chosen,"" and ""Grave.""  Edit: Also ""Tabula Rasa."" :( Although I hardly ever cry during any BtVS episodes anymore."
buffy,2zrtb4,GinaZaneburritos,8,Sun Mar 22 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"Season 6 is also the biggest tear jerker for me, for so many reasons. I guess then I'm a bit masochistic, considering it's my favorite season."

buffy,2zrtb4,Mquestionmark,2,Mon Mar 23 11:33:00 2015 UTC,"S3, I cry during The Prom when Jonathan gives his speech and presents Buffy with her little gold umbrella for being ""Class Protector"" and everyone applauds and she gets her one perfect high school moment and then slow-dances with Angel while Wild Horses plays...  S4, I cry during New Moon Rising at Willow and Oz's goodbye, which I can't even think about without feeling all choked up. ""I feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. Like, if I'm old and blue-haired and I turn a corner in Istanbul and there you are - I won't be surprised. Because you're there with me - you know?""  S5, obviously The Body, mostly during Anya's outburst about having fruit punch.  Other than that, I don't think I cried at all during the series."
buffy,2zrtb4,Mollywobbles222,2,Mon Mar 23 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"Most of my crying when I watch Buffy now is in anticipation. In Entropy (S6), when Tara and Willow get back together ... ""Can we skip it? Can you just be kissing me now?"" omg total and utter breakdown. I know what's coming and I can't even handle it. Or in Help (S7) when Cassie tells Spike: ""someday she'll tell you,"" again, I know what's coming and Spike's gonna die.    I remember bawling my eyes out at the season 2 finale the first time around. That ripped me up, and I'm pretty sure I was a mess for weeks, maybe the whole summer. But now I know he's gonna come back, so it's way less upsetting. Plus, I can just keep watching until things are better. Same goes with S5 finale.    Of course, some things will always make me cry. ""Giles, I'm 16 years old. I don't wanna die."" Every time. The Prom (happy tears). Hell's Bells. God, I watched Hell's Bells just after getting engaged, and I was pretty much inconsolable for a week. The Body, and Seeing Red, obviously. They're moments, not so much seasons, that get me."

buffy,2ztob7,Cervix-Pounder,3,Sat Mar 21 19:41:58 2015 UTC,And the odd thing is...?
buffy,2zpcup,Lyco_499,69,Fri Mar 20 14:47:22 2015 UTC,BUFFY: Why didn't they destroy it? If the Key's as dangerous as you --  GREGOR: Because they were fools! They thought they could harness its power for the forces of light. They failed -- and paid with their blood.   Episode 04x20: Spiral
buffy,2zpcup,BackOfTheHearse,7,Fri Mar 20 17:29:18 2015 UTC,correct answer !
buffy,2zpcup,faaackksake,3,Fri Mar 20 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"Interestingly though, they succeeded. By giving the Key human form and sending it to the Slayer for protection, they made it a force for good."
buffy,2zpcup,i-like-tea,5,Sat Mar 21 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"How exactly did they make it ""a force for good""?  I don't necessarily disagree, but if the monks had destroyed the Key, then Buffy wouldn't have died, Willow wouldn't have brought her back, and the balance between good and evil would have remained the same."
buffy,2zpcup,GinaZaneburritos,5,Sun Mar 22 00:04:45 2015 UTC,I mean that Dawn is a Scooby and fights with the white hats now. So in a way they did make her a force for good.
buffy,2zpcup,i-like-tea,25,Mon Mar 23 08:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is a valid in-universe explanation, but it's stated that the key is ""energy"" and according to physics, energy cannot be created or destroyed - only transferred or transformed.  Could the monks have destroyed the key even if they wanted to?"
buffy,2zpcup,cuprous_veins,9,Fri Mar 20 19:54:40 2015 UTC,really good point.
buffy,2zpcup,misskittyfantastic0,3,Fri Mar 20 22:28:58 2015 UTC,your username is amazing.   also I agree with this explanation.

buffy,2zpcup,kittyfantastic0,8,Sun Mar 22 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"I think it was the monk's duty to protect it, so destroying it to keep it from Glory would kinda defeat the purpose of protection."
buffy,2zpcup,AlaskanFeesh,5,Fri Mar 20 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"But why were they protecting it? If it's only purpose was to break down the walls between dimensions, what would be the point?"

buffy,2zpcup,AlaskanFeesh,3,Fri Mar 20 17:45:19 2015 UTC,This. May be wrong but I think the Knights of Byzantium and the monks aren't from the same order
buffy,2zpcup,TheDeadManWalks,2,Fri Mar 20 16:27:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the point was that they were originally just supposed to protect it and then didn't have time to destroy it once Glory found them.
buffy,2zpcup,Chicken421,4,Fri Mar 20 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"This does not make sense. They didn't have time to destroy it, but they had time to make it human and implant years of false memories into everyone in Sunnydale? Building, especially building in detail, usually takes a lot more time than destruction."
buffy,2zpcup,catdoctor,2,Fri Mar 20 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah you bring up a good point, but maybe when the key is in its natural form there's more to destroying it than just killing a little girl."

buffy,2zljmn,CenabisBene,3,Fri Mar 20 00:53:40 2015 UTC,"This makes me somewhat unreasonably happy :) since at least 40% of it was guesswork. And I knew ""ante"" sounded wrong, but I had to look up what I thought would be the correct preposition.   Anyway, gratias tibi ago ... mi Fabulle :)"

buffy,2zljmn,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Mar 20 02:02:44 2015 UTC,Do the books react if you speak faulty Latin in front of them? Then I'm safe.
buffy,2zljmn,GMLiddell,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's established that the words have to be exact. :)  The real question is how Xander managed to come up with a Latin phrase that would work. After all, Buffy is often comically unable to translate basic phrases in other languages."
buffy,2zl6jj,BlackMoonWolf3113,19,Thu Mar 19 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, noice. To be honest, though, if he's not doing a British accent, I'm not interested."
buffy,2zl6jj,deathbynotsurprise,7,Thu Mar 19 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"Haha! Yea, I hear you. I'm partial to the British accent myself!   The character Dresden is supposed to be American (I think?) so we can pretend James is British using an American accent. Suspension of disbelief, right? ;)"
buffy,2zl6jj,crysiscrytical,8,Thu Mar 19 16:28:38 2015 UTC,his reading of Dresden reminds me of a lot of Spike. It's not the British accent but the mannerism and speech pattern is otherwise the same. Dresden has become this weird parallel universe Spike in my head.
buffy,2zl6jj,20jcp,3,Thu Mar 19 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"Cool! I just bought The Dresden Files book 1, I can't wait to check it out! I've been curious about the series for a while, and James Marsters as the narrator pretty much sealed the deal for me. Haha.   The vampire books are next on my list!

buffy,2zl6jj,mihoutao_xiangjiao,9,Thu Mar 19 16:56:21 2015 UTC,"Storm Front is good and short, the quality of recording and performance definitely picks up as the books progress."
buffy,2zl6jj,razzmatazz1313,4,Thu Mar 19 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with /u/20jcp. I'm very picky with narrators, so I had some issues with his narration in the earlier books, but he definitely gets better. The series itself picks up very quickly as well and you'll probably get hooked 2 or 3 books in. Enjoy it!"
buffy,2zl6jj,20jcp,2,Fri Mar 20 09:33:02 2015 UTC,"The Dresden Files with Marsters is awesome. Then he couldn't do like book 13(ghost story), my god it drove me insane not having him there. I just found this series last year, and finished it all last year. Now I'm going insane waiting for the next one."
buffy,2zl6jj,CatfishChisel,2,Fri Mar 20 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"Apparently, Masters will be recording Ghost Stories to be released this year? Which I think is cool, but also a little bit shitty. I'm not sure in what measures though."

buffy,2zl6jj,Beloit,6,Thu Mar 19 16:29:54 2015 UTC,He's also quite charming in an episode of Supernatural. I don't remember what it's called.
buffy,2zl6jj,lajouissance,7,Thu Mar 19 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"The one where he was married to Charisma Carpenter?  I loved that episode!  I don't remember the name of the episode, either, but it was in Season... 7? because he helped capture a leviathan."
buffy,2zl6jj,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Thu Mar 19 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"It's season 7, episode 5, ""Shut up, Dr. Phil""."
buffy,2zl6jj,astalius,2,Thu Mar 19 17:58:09 2015 UTC,Yup! And then he saved the Winchesters from charisma's spell. Love it!
buffy,2zl6jj,The_Iron_Zeppelin,6,Thu Mar 19 18:02:34 2015 UTC,And bagged the Boys a Leviathan which was the ONLY way they would have discovered the Leviathans weakness.  So basically James Marsters helped the Winchesters save the world.  Just sayin....
buffy,2zl6jj,Zaiya53,2,Thu Mar 19 18:29:58 2015 UTC,now i have a reason to finally start watching Supernatural
buffy,2zl6jj,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:38:17 2015 UTC,This could be my favorite MOTW Supernatural episode. Charisma and James are just so damn likable in that ep. I keep waiting for them to make a return for some more awesome witchy hijinks.
buffy,2zl6jj,Zaiya53,3,Thu Mar 19 18:19:27 2015 UTC,Oh that would be SO cool.  Not sure if you're up to date with SPN but it would totally fit in with what I think they're setting up for next season.
buffy,2zl6jj,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Thu Mar 19 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"next season, siigghhh... Don't get me wrong. I love the show as much as the next girl, but I was so ready for it to be over.   Side note, what's your theory? Maybe I'll get hyped about it again!"
buffy,2zl6jj,dbutlerjr,2,Thu Mar 19 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you.  The series has gotten weaker ever since the epic ending of Season 5.  It was such a perfect ending, at the time i wanted more but now it does seem to have no solid ending in sight.  As far as my theory, this season we've seen a lot of Witch activity.  The off screen introduction of the ""Grand Witches Council"" and a few notorious Witches from lore.  My theory is that they will take center stage as the next Big Bad and perhaps they'll bring back James Marsters and Charisma Carpenters characters because they were thousand year old Witches with a lot of power.  I know its a stretch, but here's to hoping haha!"
buffy,2zl6jj,Legen_unfiltered,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"While I'd love to see them again, a witch based season sounds kinda yucky to me. I want a big bad! Every season in Buffy the threat was bigger, even when she went through battling herself during the trio/dark Willow! I guess I'm just spoiled =P I read a fan theory on supernatural that said something about the finale having Crowley tell the viewers our ten year contract was up, & I got really excited for that =/ I'll stick it out, & hopefully it'll have a good ending =)"
buffy,2zmpjp,heymeowmeow,6,Thu Mar 19 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's especially annoying since I'm watching with a newbie to the show. I know the context, they don't.  Another to add to the list is 04x02, Living Conditions. All demon language is missing, so the whole ""I'm 3000 years old! When are you going to stop treating me like I'm 900?"" is missing."

And, yeah, I've only seen through the whole show once, this past year on Netflix and I missed more than I realized because some of them aren't immediately obvious that there are supposed to be subtitles like in the Zeppo where it seems like part of a running joke of not really knowing what's going on outside of Xander's storyline."

buffy,2zmpjp,wowyesokay,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:32:36 2015 UTC,Same. The first time I contacted Netflix they said it would be fixed but yesterday they told me it's an issue on the other end from the company they license from. If anyone knows who to contact/how to contact them that would be great. Mutant Enemy doesn't have a website or contact info that I can find and WB and UPN are now the CW. I'm thinking 20th Television but they're so big I wouldn't even know how to get their attention.
buffy,2zmpjp,wowyesokay,2,Fri Mar 20 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"The network itself won't have any involvement in the captioning (nor will Netflix, technically).  Subtitles are generally outsourced and you would have to contact the captioning company to have any real hope of initiating improvements. Some googling suggests Amara or Universal Subtitles provide a lot of their content, so you might want to dig a bit further into that end of the service.  Beyond that, HOH lobbyists are very effective campaigners for this sort of thing. Check out their methods for inspiration."

Have you gone full peroxide? Was that something you knew going in? Was that something you were excited for or terrified of? I had done that to myself, like, back in the day, when I was maybe 12 or 13—but that’s the last time I had taken any peroxide to my head. During shooting, we had to re-dye, re-touchup the roots every month. It wreaked a bit of havoc. We found some solutions. My manager is friends with James Marsters’ manager, who played Spike on Buffy. He had to do that for many years, and we asked James. James said, “Dude, put a little Sweet’N Low in the mixture. It really neutralized the burn.” That’s what we’ve been doing. Thank you, James."

I tried to emulate the original as much as I could. I wasn't trying to reinterpret the song but instead wanted to reproduce it in full, idiosyncrasies included. What do you think?"
buffy,2zk4go,nunudeen,4,Thu Mar 19 05:58:23 2015 UTC,"You missed the bit where that evil witch's (which is ridiculous, etc., etc.) dying scream mixes perfectly into the song.  In all seriousness though, this is awesome. :)"

Occasionally my sister and I will watch Buffy together and we always laugh at the part where she screams and it seems to have been timed perfectly to fit with the intro music, which seems a little out of place since none of the other clips have a recognizable sound that seems to be part of the song."

Tara felt a sharp pain and saw a red splatter on Willow's shirt, ""Your shirt..."" she began to say but then she collapsed. Tara was floating in an empty void filled with black darkness pressing in on her from all directions, then she was standing in a large featureless white room. A golden man and woman stood in front of her, both wearing Greek robes. ""Who are you?"" she asked. ""We are the Oracles."" the man said, ""You can call us Brother and Sister."" said the woman. ""Where am I?"" Tara asked. ""This is the place between life and death."" the man said, ""you have been killed but we have interfered."" said the woman. She continued ""We do not usually interfere with lesser beings, but the forces of darkness has grown and you could help change that."" the man then said ""We can't reverse time but we can send your essence back to when you first met your group of friends, we hope you can make things turn out better for everyone."" Then Tara started to get dizzy, she closed her eyes and when she opened them she was sitting in a Wicca meeting at college. ""I remember this,"" she thought ""everybody loses their voices, then I meet Willow for the first time."" The meeting ended and Tara went back to her room. She picked up some of her spell books and headed to Willow's room."

buffy,2zhe10,ctsmith76,30,Wed Mar 18 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"Jinkies. The idea of walkers and vampires coexisting in the same universe is pretty interesting. This would be a problem for vamps. It would change the game for them completely. Vampires have never had to worry about getting enough of their food source before. Also, since one has to technically die in order to be reborn as a vampire, as do walkers, would there be walker-vampires? Or could vampires even procreate anymore at all? This creates a problem that could hinder the creation of new vamps, if every dead human becomes a walker.   Also, walkers aren't the only issue in TWD. Rick and his crew have had to kill lots of humans in order to survive. Killing humans is a big deal in Buffy's world, and a line she refuses to cross. I think this would be the most difficult adjustment for The Scoobies, the killing of people, even more difficult than the walkers themselves.  But, this is what I picture, and it's rather glorious. Buffy slicing away at huge hordes of walkers with her slayer scythe, Willow burning them all away with magic fire, whilst floating above them from a safe distance, and Xander with his eye patch, commanding the slayer army to destroy hundreds at a time.   I will add that Xander is the only one of the group I can see embracing gun technology. It was his idea to use the rocket launcher on The Judge, after all.  Loving this mashup of universes! Can you imagine a crossover? Omg. So epic.  (Sorry, went full geek over this).  Edited for a typo."

I would think they would want to clear out islands and move all the humans to them to keep them safe. But then there is still the daylight issue. Could lead to a true alliance between vampires and humans.
buffy,2zhe10,deathbynotsurprise,3,Thu Mar 19 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"I love your answer! I don't watch TWD so maybe it's not the same thing, but there are zombies in the Buffy verse. In Angel, Wolfram & Hart have an emergency shutdown protocol for the building where, when threatened, they lock all exits and unleash the zombie hoards. Connor and Angel fight the zombies together, leading to the epic joke:  Angel: It's a zombie.  Connor: What's a zombie?   Angel: It's an undead thing.   Connor: Like you?   Angel: No. Zombies are slow moving, dimwitted things that crave human flesh.   Connor: Like you.   Angel: No. It's different, trust me."
buffy,2zhe10,buffanater,12,Tue Mar 24 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the season. S1 scoobys would have trouble, but S5 and up scoobys could destroy walkers easily. Then they would do some research and find a way to destroy all of the walkers instantly."
buffy,2zhe10,faaackksake,9,Wed Mar 18 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"much better than the people on the walking dead i imagine, people on that show make mind numbingly stupid decisions absolutely all the time, sure the scoobies do stupid stuff every now and again but they're much more used to having their lives constantly in danger, plus they all have at least a little experience with weapons, i don't see it being a problem for them, especially with the use of magic."
buffy,2zhe10,roholight,6,Wed Mar 18 18:46:02 2015 UTC,I think the walking dead zombies would be a piece of cake.
buffy,2zhe10,pduffy52,5,Wed Mar 18 16:42:48 2015 UTC,Walker Slayer.   The magic that gives the slayer her power still active in the body of a walker.  That kind of scares me.
buffy,2zhe10,Infamously_Unknown,5,Thu Mar 19 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they would read a pile of dusty books until they would find some solution.   they have no functioning circulatory system   This is a thing I was always a bit confused about. They don't have a beating heart so you'd assume their circulatory system isn't functional, but they can be quite quickly tranquilized by being hit by a dart gun even in their legs. They can also get drunk. Even coffee apparently works on them.  So they might not have mechanical circulation, but there seems to be some magic involved or something. Hard to say how they'd react to a bite."
buffy,2zhe10,Sassafrass23,2,Thu Mar 19 11:52:16 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Some creative liberty, I'm guessing!  They're already undead though.. Hmm."
buffy,2zhe10,Infamously_Unknown,2,Thu Mar 19 14:14:49 2015 UTC,I've thought about that scene in Prophecy Girl where Angel says he doesn't have any breath so he can't resuscitate Buffy. Vampires don't have blood circulation so they can't manage oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange but they should still be able to get air in and get (the same) air out...

On an intellectual level, I know it's not that big of a deal, but damn. At the very least, they could've used it as payoff for that long running joke--something like ""huh. Guess we were wrong about leprechauns!""  Edit: Typo."

buffy,2zfmzt,CalixeAthura,7,Wed Mar 18 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"As a person, I think I would like Tara better.  She's so grounded but still okay with being different and accepting whoever she and others really are.  As a character, I like Willow better because she gets more character development in the series, but this could also be the fact that Willow gets 7 seasons to develop as a character whereas Tara only gets about 3 seasons to develop and a lot less screen time for a decent chunk of that time as she has to be slowly integrated into the Scooby Gang.  I would have loved to have seen Tara have more involvement in the series as I think she was a character with a lot of potential, and Amber Benson is a phenomenal actress."
buffy,2zfmzt,deefee,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like I SHOULD like Tara more sometimes due to what you said. She is very understanding and has the patience of a saint, esoecially when it comes to Dawn. I feel that, if Tara were real, she would just be so much better of a human than I ever could be. I'm more like Willow definitely. Love how Willow and Anya always banter back and forth lol. ""Trust me Anya, there is NO WAY that you cannot piss off.""   I also have to say yes I love Amber. Especially in season 5 after the Glory incident. Lord it tears me up everytime. And, ""hear that baby? You're my always."" So much love man!"
buffy,2zfmzt,ultrahedgehog,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely like Tara better as a person. Willow was really pretty abusive in their relationship, and I think it's a little odd that fans give her next to no flack for this at all."
buffy,2zfmzt,KiraKira_,12,Wed Mar 18 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"Willow was a much more developed character, so of course most people are going to identify more with her than Tara. There's just more to relate to.  She was an awkward teenager, she dated a bad boy (though not as bad as certain murderous vampires), was a nerd, a lesbian, an addict, went through a very mean phase... As much as I love Tara, her character arc was ultimately just that of a shy girl who gains some confidence, and most of her on-screen motivations revolved around Willow.  She might be relatable to folks who've been in relationships with addicts or manipulative people in general, but she just didn't have much of her own stuff going on."
buffy,2zfmzt,GinaZaneburritos,13,Wed Mar 18 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"She might be relatable to folks who've been in relationships with addicts or manipulative people in general, but she just didn't have much of her own stuff going on.   I'm kind of ... personally offended by this. :/ I get that you think there's more going on with Willow, but there's no need to pigeon-hole everyone who finds Tara more relatable.  I actually think Tara is a fairly well-developed character. Unlike some characters in BtVS, we see how she interacts with a wide group of people. We see her interact with others in the Wicca group ... with Buffy ... with Dawn ... with Glory ... with her family ... with Anya ... we see her both with Willow and having left Willow. Of course we see mostly the times that she's with the Scoobies, but that's true of everyone, including Willow. As for summing her up with ""shy girl gains confidence,"" that is, in a sense, equally applicable to Willow. It's what she does with her confidence that is different.  I would contrast her with someone like Jenny Calendar. I love that character too, and although I feel like I have a sense of who she is, it involves a lot of guesswork, because we really aren't shown or told very much.  Anyway, I guess I'll be one of the only people to say Tara :) Partly because I can absolutely relate to her physical awkwardness, her propensity to tell jokes that make no sense sometimes, her inability to make friends, but also her compassion for people and her tendency to listen. I can relate to her self-deprecation (""those boys were really checking me out?"") and her initial belief that something's wrong with her, that if Willow saw who she really was she would freak out (so she messes up the ritual on purpose - lying, which is pretty out of character). I can relate to her need to belong and her disbelief that anyone would think that she does. And also her ability to stand up for people who are being hurt (as she does to Anya in ""Older and Faraway"" or to Glory in ""Tough Love"") and think of the people and aspects that others overlook. She's in the background, but she's there, and, for people like Buffy and Dawn, she's the only one at times who is there for them.  I think Tara's a great character, much more than just a foil for Willow's development. And I think we see her develop quite a bit on the show.  Edit: I do like Willow too, although neither of them is really my favorite character. But I love Tara - even though watching her is, for me, kind of like looking into an occasionally cringe-worthy, occasionally inspirational mirror. :)  For what it's worth, I think Faith's line to Tara in ""Who Are You"" is hilarious:    Tara: She, uh, said he www ...  Faith: He www? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?   Although I find Tara's stammer to be one of her most endearing characteristics, and I realize I probably would have reacted exactly the same way that Tara does :P  I also think it's worth pointing out that Tara never interacted with the Buffybot in ""Intervention."" If she had, she would have seen in about two seconds what apparently her ""best friends"" could not, that it wasn't Buffy. ;)"
buffy,2zfmzt,HolgerMaivali,2,Wed Mar 18 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"I love how you put this. :) and your points are 100% accurate. Though Willow IS my favorite, Tara is a very close 2nd. She barely had any lines for the first little bit of her being on the show but she always had something very valid to say. Hell even when she COULDN'T say anything she made her point. (I am of course referring to Hush. The laundry room scene ;P )"
buffy,2zfmzt,johnpriest,7,Wed Mar 18 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"You make good points. I really wish Tara would have had a longer run on the show. I loved when Buffy confided in her, but sadly that was one of the few parts where Tara wasn't with Willow. I feel like she had so much potential, but she left too soon."
buffy,2zfmzt,johnpriest,5,Wed Mar 18 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that Tara wasn't given enough time to really shine. I imagine that she could have really developed in interesting ways. Take Wesley or Cordelia on Angel or even Willow herself. All those characters were given years to develop and became so much more.   So yeah, have to go with Willow, but only because she had more screentime."
buffy,2zfmzt,Sludgeycore,5,Wed Mar 18 08:55:12 2015 UTC,"I love Willow, and I always will. But Tara seemed so much more innocent in alot of ways.. and generally a nice person. She cared about everyone, she was always damn loyal to the group. She was so broken... had issues. But it never made her a bad person. I think Tara was special out of all the characters... she remained innocent for me."
buffy,2zfmzt,buffanater,2,Thu Mar 19 00:08:38 2015 UTC,I completely agree with that. She really was so innocent. I mean she barely flinched when Glory broke her hand and stuck her hands in Tara's head. Tara took a hell of a lot from Sunnydale. Not to mention her HUMAN family.

When I was first watching the show I had the mind set of ""I'll be watching Tara grow as a character like Willow"". Instead, as I found myself relating less and less to Will, Tara didn't progress. Had she had more time, I think Tara would have grown, but it had taken Will four seasons to grow as she had."

He has been suffering from a lifelong desolation due to childhood trauma and he is finally coming to terms with what happened and where he sees himself in the future. ”  Nicholas’ rep continues, “This is the first time in his adult life that he is able to admit his troubles publicly, and he wants to do so while seeking the treatment that is best for him. This goes beyond a few months in a rehabilitation center, or a quick dose of anti depressants — Nicholas’ struggle will go on for years, but he has a strong support system behind him that will guide him through the uphill battle that is chronic depression.”  And contrary to popular belief, Nicholas’ rep says comic book conventions aren’t a catalyst for the outbursts, “To him, they are a form of therapy — a way for him to connect with his fans and find the happiness he so desperately seeks. While attendees enjoy a vast array of parties and entertainment, celebrity guests see this as an enjoyable, contractual obligation and a part of the actors’ career experience. Nicholas’ fans are some of the most supportive, incredible, and caring men and women on the planet- and he loves nothing more than to bring a smile to their faces. While his actions may have seemed like the opposite over the past several months, this is a man who is struggling to keep afloat after a year filled with many personal struggles.

Everyone was completely confused. There was this period of about four days where everyone realized this was the new episode and we were expected to perform these songs in front of the camera and freaking out.   Amazing. Joss Whedon is so ballsy! He didn't tell the actors that there would be a musical, he simply gave them a cassette.

He was not enamored with vampires and that’s putting it mildly.""   haha this is awesome i can totally omagine this exchange, cool interview, more i read of him the more i like james marsters.  edit: also just to say as difficult as it is to watch, that scene in seeing red is so well done, it's so powerful and i think it does a lot for development for both characters, and for me, in the audience it helped me come to terms with things in my own life, i understand why the cast were against it, but im glad they did it, it's not pretty but it's important."
buffy,2zcd7q,Naibafo,8,Tue Mar 17 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"His answer regarding ""Once More With Feeling"" was awesome.  Great interview, thanks for posting!"
buffy,2zcd7q,catdoctor,2,Tue Mar 17 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"No worries, just thought it offers a great insight into the production of the show from an articulate man who's had time to reflect on the show and the character. I found his answers and acceptance of the impossibility of a Spike movie at this stage quite moving too. Damn Avengers."
buffy,2zcd7q,Sassafrass23,2,Tue Mar 17 14:08:02 2015 UTC,Great guy.

buffy,2zdgn9,NewtonTesticles,13,Tue Mar 17 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Angel. I like him in his own show and I like him in Angel & Faith.   That said, I hate storylines involving the Buffy/Angel relationship. It was a wonderful first-love sort of story, but like most high school/first love relationships, it belongs in the past. Let them move on completely and look back on their time together fondly, the way 99.9% of real high school relationships turn out."
buffy,2zdgn9,hopz,10,Tue Mar 17 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"I like this view. I love Bangel when it was happening, but when Buffy moved on, so did I. I didn't like the whole cookie dough speech. She's ready, she's just not for you, Angel."
buffy,2zdgn9,purplenat,6,Wed Mar 18 01:56:55 2015 UTC,It still blows my mind that both Angel and Spike were named William.
buffy,2zdgn9,farooqiasad,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:56:42 2015 UTC,Is this true? I thought Angel was Liam. Or is that short for William?
buffy,2zdgn9,deathbynotsurprise,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:59:50 2015 UTC,It's short for Liam!
buffy,2zdgn9,farooqiasad,4,Tue Mar 24 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"I'm more Team Bangel than Team Spuffy, but really, I'm Team Neither. I liked Buffy and Angel together, but Cordelia-Angel is my ship. (Is that popular unpopular in the fan base btw? I haven't seen much opinion either way on it since I began posting here...)  As solo characters though, I go back and forth between Angel and Spike. I didn't care for Angel when he was on Buffy, at all (Angelus not withstanding), whereas I loved Spike instantly. But Spike bored me in seasons 6 and 7. I enjoyed newly chipped Spike, as a begrudging ally to the scoobies, but when Spuffy became like a serious thing, I was over him. I get it, I just didn't like it. Meanwhile I was falling hard for Angel on his own series. He's such a complex character, he needs his own show to be fully explored. On Buffy, his character was reduced to dark, broody boyfriend of Buffy. I didn't get him at all, but seeing him on his own season, you see way more sides to his character and grow to truly understand why he's the way that he is.   Ultimately, my love for Spike was restored in Angel season 5, but I think Angel still just about edges Blondie Bear out for me."

buffy,2zdgn9,xtromp,3,Wed Mar 18 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"Still have the same opinion as the last time this was brought up.   I dislike the whole ""shipping"" business. I really wish I could find my old comment on that issue from somewhere, but I can't :( I'll edit post if I do."
buffy,2zdgn9,coolbeaNs92,6,Tue Mar 17 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Haha it's really shallow, but I think it's mostly just a guilty pleasure, at least for older fans.  People who are new to the show might not have caught on to some of the more important messages, but for those of us who've analyzed the show to death, sometimes it's just fun to sit back and comment on how sexy Spike's cheekbones are.  Seriously, they could cut glass!"
buffy,2zdgn9,KiraKira_,3,Tue Mar 17 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"It's not really about it being shallow, it's because I don't think any of Buffy's relationships were right for her. And also because Buffy is so much more than shipping. I just think it's a shame that sometimes so much focus is given on ""who should Buffy end up with"", when that's not the point of the show.   But yeah, after 18 years I am kinda tired out of it. But mostly I really wanna find my old comment, because i put my point across really well. I've been searching through loads of old posts, but still can't find it anywhere :("
buffy,2zdgn9,coolbeaNs92,3,Tue Mar 17 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"Came here to say something along the same vein.   As it stands currently... Buffy has never had a successful, healthy, long term relationship. I don't believe it's possible for a Slayer. So l think that's pretty logical. I don't ever remember seeing/hearing about a married Slayer. Even Wood's mother was juggling both being a mother and dusting vamps all by her lonesome.  Sometimes I like to entertain my Fuffy headcanon for fun :] and it's cool to talk about every now and then. But you're right: Buffy is so much more than that.  And at the end of the day, shipping is all opinion based. So OP, you're not going to sway anyone with a persuasive argument. Some people don't like Angel and that's okay. Some do, and that is too. Some people like Kennedy and that's not okay."
buffy,2zdgn9,DigitalBathRx,2,Wed Mar 18 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"Ooh Fuffy! I've only read 3 fanfic things ever, all 3 were BtVS, and 2 of them just so happened to be Faith/Buffy. That pairing opens up a whole new avenue of Buffy stories."
buffy,2zdgn9,AngryWizard,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think you and I may have discussed this before, but if you want some Fuffy fic suggestions just shoot me a PM :]"
buffy,2zdgn9,DigitalBathRx,2,Wed Mar 18 18:12:33 2015 UTC,I think we did! I had only read 1 fanfic ever (one that a friend wrote) before you and I talked about it a bit and you recommended some.
buffy,2zdgn9,AngryWizard,3,Wed Mar 18 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"As an aside, ""Spangel"" does indeed mean the two of them getting together. But, hey, it's canon, so if that's what floats somebody's boat, then great.  As Joss said when commenting on the issue of Angelus and Spike getting it on back in their Whirlwind days, ""they were evil, not close minded."""
buffy,2zdgn9,clockworklycanthrope,9,Tue Mar 17 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"I just like to root for the underdog, myself.  Spike was never really accepted by the Scoobies the way Angel was.  Granted, Angel kinda fucked that up, but even then he eventually rebuilds his relationships with Giles, Willow, and obviously Cordelia.  Meanwhile Xander wants to kill Spike, Giles actually tries, and Willow doesn't seem to even acknowledge his existence (at least I can't think of any memorable interactions with them, other than the scene in the school basement) post-ensoulment. Plus Spike is hilarious, and Angel's whole tortured soul bit, while noble, gets old quick."
buffy,2zdgn9,KiraKira_,5,Tue Mar 17 21:22:03 2015 UTC,The big Willow-Spike interaction that comes to mind for me is when Spike first learns of the chip in his head and Willow tries to comfort him about his impotence even though he just tried to kill her.
buffy,2zdgn9,heymeowmeow,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the Willow/Spike interaction before he got his soul back was fantastic.  Lovers Walk and The Yoko Factor were great, too.  I meant that after he gets his soul back, they seem to completely ignore each other.  Though I did just remember that scene in Touched where she informs him that Buffy got booted in the previous episode."
buffy,2zdgn9,KiraKira_,2,Thu Mar 19 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Haha totally missed the ""post-ensoulment"" part. My bad."
buffy,2zdgn9,heymeowmeow,3,Thu Mar 19 21:40:26 2015 UTC,"Spangel all the way! There could be oil of some kind involved...  I don't dislike Angel at all, I just find him a bit boring. He's not my type, I guess. For me, Buffy and Angel as a couple are too teary-eyed and melodramatic, but I like that the show is self-aware about it, like during The Zeppo when they're having their big, tragic scene which Xander accidentally interrupts.  He can be really funny, though - one of my favourite Angel moments is when he slips coming in the door and goes ""ow"" and Buffy's like, ""Stealthy."" and he says, ""Not my best entrance. I think they were mopping in the halls."""
buffy,2zdgn9,Mollywobbles222,3,Tue Mar 17 23:59:48 2015 UTC,I'm ride or die for both Spike and Angel. They are awesome (and their banter together is awesome too).   I ship Spuffy and Spangel but honestly Spike/Angel/Buffy is where it's at. Threesomes for all. Any bashing of any character by shippers is just not okay.
buffy,2zdgn9,queenie504,3,Wed Mar 18 00:49:45 2015 UTC,"Sure Angel was cursed with a soul instead of fighting for one, and sure he was a dick as Angelus, but that's not what I dislike about him the most. I dislike that his whole relationship with Buffy boils down to ""I love you. We belong together. BUT WE DON'T. I CAN'T. Okay I can."" repeated for 3 seasons, and Angel had very little character outside of that.  Angel was MUCH more interesting on his own show, and in the few occurrences he interacted with scoobies outside of Buffy."
buffy,2zdgn9,HomelessBoxBoy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the whole ""but we can't"" thing didn't really start until he comes back in Season 3, and him and Buffy try to be 'just friends'.  Before that, he seemed pretty okay with being in a relationship with Buffy.  Though I agreed that once that happens, the relationship kind of goes down hill.  And he's epic in ANGEL."
buffy,2zdgn9,Sammyboy616,2,Mon Mar 23 20:54:26 2015 UTC,I always liked Angel
buffy,2zdgn9,friggengenius,4,Wed Mar 18 04:02:45 2015 UTC,"Meh, I don't really like Angel, he's not nearly as fun on screen as Spike, but I'm not a huge Spike fan either. The whole buffy/angel relationship is still somehow extremely compelling though... Like Ross/Rachel, even though Ross is kind of a tool, their dynamic just works. The same principle applies here."
buffy,2zdgn9,Jay-whatchulookinat,2,Tue Mar 17 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"Idk theres plenty of bangel fans here, myself included, they're star crossed lovers, never to be together but always belonging to one another, its a classic trope and it works beautifully in the buffyverse."
buffy,2zdgn9,faaackksake,2,Tue Mar 17 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Fuck Bangel, Team Cordangel?1? all day err day."
buffy,2zdgn9,xtromp,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:59:09 2015 UTC,It just seems everyone dick rides team Spike to the point that even mentioning Angel gets you mocked.   Negative threads and posts about either of them seem to be created an equal amount of times.   TLDR: Let's all just get along.   That would be nice. :)
buffy,2zdgn9,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"I tend to refer to Angel as ""Captain Cardboard"", although once he got his own show it did slowly dawn on me that behind his I-only-have-one-facial-expression face there was a super dry sense of humour hiding in there somewhere. So I grew to appreciate him a little more. Still... Mr Boreanz? Not the greatest actor. Or maybe James Marsters just had more to work with, I dunno."
buffy,2zdgn9,Kallasilya,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:34:00 2015 UTC,I don't hate Angel but he does annoy me sometimes. He is kind of boring and mopes around and feels guilty about everything. Who is that helping? You can feel guilty but just move on and smile once in awhile. He just seems kind of humorless. I don't hate him. He is a great character but Spike has more of a personality. They both did bad things but they did not have souls.

ASH was the most famous of the cast when he was a regular character, when Giles became a ""special guest"" character that became Allyson Hannigan due to her rising stardom.  tl;dr: Hollywood politics."
buffy,2za8zr,proindrakenzol,3,Tue Mar 17 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"Basically what has been said. The last billing on the main credits is the 2nd best spot. Most shows use the biggest supporting actor to anchor the credit sequence (back when most shows had them). After American Pie, Allyson Hannigan was easily the most recognisable regular at that stage of the show."
buffy,2za8zr,GoddessOfGoodness,3,Tue Mar 17 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"On top of what others have already said, getting that billing spot was actually part of her contract renegotiation that season. She wanted it."
buffy,2za8zr,clockworklycanthrope,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"The credits could have easily used ""with Anthony Stewart Head as Giles / and Alyson Hannigan as Willow"" for the first eight episodes. Certainly that would have been better for ASH than being left completely out."

buffy,2z6k0k,johnpriest,5,Mon Mar 16 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I still find that quote from Faith pretty shocking, even in comparison to blatant erotica.  Like, damn."
buffy,2z6k0k,KiraKira_,5,Mon Mar 16 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"And the effect it had on Spike is fairly profound. We know that he believes through the sixth season that that was, indeed, Buffy talking to him.  From ""Gone"":   Spike: That was bloody stupid.  Buffy: What's the matter? Ashamed to be seen with me? C'mon. He had no idea I was here. This is perfect.  Spike: Perfect for you.  Buffy: Well. Picture me confused. I thought this was what you wanted.  Spike: What I want ... This vanishing act's right liberating for you, in'it? Be anywhere you want. Do anything you want. (pointedly) Or anyone.  Buffy: What are you talking -  Spike: Only reason you're here is that you're not here.   I always understood that he incorporated what Faith said to him in ""Who Are You"" into his conception of Buffy and what she wanted until the seventh season."
buffy,2z6k0k,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 16 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"He didn't know it was Faith specifically, but IIRC, I think he told Faith in Dirty Girls that he'd been told about the situation.  I think it's left ambiguous whether he knew that particular interaction was during the body swap, or even when Buffy told him it happened.  Or maybe I have that backwards and he knew it was Faith who did the body swap, but not when."
buffy,2z6k0k,KiraKira_,3,Mon Mar 16 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"It is indeed left ambiguous - both exactly what Buffy told him and when. But I don't know how else to interpret what he says to her in ""Gone,"" do you? It's the kind of reference that he wouldn't have said if he didn't think it was Buffy.  And as he says to Faith in ""Dirty Girls"":   Faith: Shoulda known it wasn't blondy behind the wheel. She'd never throw down like that.  Spike: Oh, you have been away.   This tells me that it's not at all outside the realm of possibility for him that Buffy could ""throw down like that."" Which, in fact, he probably believed for quite a while.  Edit: For reference, this is the conversation in ""Dirty Girls"":   Faith: I met you before, you know.  Spike: Yeah. You made quite an impression on my chin.  Faith: Not in the graveyard. Before that. I was kinda wearing a different body.  Spike: Pity.  Faith: You seemed okay with it.  Spike: (getting it) The body swap. With Buffy.  Faith: She fill you in on that whole deal?  Spike: Told me it went down. Failed to mention who was driving her skin around.  Faith: I may have said a few things.  Spike: Like you could ride me at a gallop until my legs buckled ... Squeeze me til I popped like warm champagne? (off her look) Not the sorta thing a man forgets.  Faith: Shoulda known it wasn't blondy behind the wheel. She'd never throw down like that.  Spike: Oh, you have been away.  Faith: Don't tell me miss tightly wound has been getting her naughty on.  Spike: Not of late.  Faith: Wow. Everybody's full of surprises."
buffy,2z6k0k,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 16 19:59:11 2015 UTC,Ah!  I just got the parallel between what Faith says in Who Are You and Spike in Gone!  I never caught on to that before because it fits so perfectly in context.

Again for reference (from ""Who Are You""):   Faith: Cause I could do anything I want and instead I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have anything. Anyone. (her tone becomes intimate, hypnotic) Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop ...   etc. :)"

First off, everyone always cites the bathroom scene as a source of like, irredeemable evil from Spike, and while I'm not in ANY WAY defending his actions or saying that he should be completely forgiven, I'd like to point you to this essay on the subject of gender in BTVS. If that's just too long for you, here's some key pieces of this.      During this nine-episode sexual relationship, Buffy assumes the traditionally masculine role of abuser, while Spike assumes a passive role as victim. Buffy holds the power in the relationship. Yet Buffy is not held responsible for her abusive behavior, while Spike is endlessly punished for finally almost raping Buffy. In episodes such as ""Entropy,"" ""Seeing Red,"" and ""Beneath You,"" Buffy is characterized as the victim of the relationship, despite the fact that she spent months abusing Spike.     Until “Seeing Red,” Buffy has all the power in the relationship.  If she wants to have sex, they have it, even if Spike says no (as in “Gone”).  However, when Buffy says no, they do not have sex (as in “Older and Far Away).  Furthermore, Buffy has been portrayed as physically stronger than Spike (for example, in “The Gift” she was able to easily carry a troll hammer that Spike could not even lift in “Blood Ties”).     Although Spike is loving and understanding to Buffy from mid-season five until mid-season six, Buffy treats Spike with disdain and contempt.  She uses him for sex while insulting him and telling him that he is “an evil, disgusting thing,” incapable of changing his nature despite his efforts to do good.  She also physically abuses him by hitting him without provocation in “Smashed,” “Dead Things,” and “As You Were”     Her abuse of Spike is not acknowleged until season sevens's Conversations with Dead People, in which her admission that she treated Spike horribly is tempered by her claim that Spike's love for her is ""sick."" Her abuse is later mentioned in Never Leave Me when Spike points out that Buffy took her self-hatred out on him. Yet these two mentions do not compare to the ""weekly attempted rape reminders"" that we get in almost every episode in the first half of season seven. Buffy's abuse of Spike is never treated as severely as Spike's almost-rape of Buffy, despite the fact that her abuse was conscious and went on for months, whereas the almost rape was a 45-second breakdown.     Buffy never took any actions to deal with her abusive tendencies (she never apologized to Spike, she never discussed her behavior with anyone else, she never even acknowledged that she had done something wrong). Meanwhile, Spike's almost rape of Buffy has been mentioned repeatedly, has resulted in the loss of the only human friend he had (Dawn), and continues to hover over the entire Buffy/Spike relationship. Unlike Buffy, who never showed any sign of caring about her abuse, Spike was so horrified by the almost rape that he travelled to Africa, endured difficult trials, and won a soul which causes him enormous torment--all so he could never hurt Buffy again.    and there is so much more that I didn't include here. Basically, if you hate Spike for that scene, do you hate Buffy too? does Buffy deserve to die for her abuse of Spike? sorry for the huge breakdown, but the constant talk about the bathroom scene drives me nuts when no one seems to recognize that Buffy did terrible things to Spike, too.      Other reasons Spike was great include but are not limited to: after he realized he loved Buffy, he did a lot of good in the group. He helped them fight, he took care of and befriended Dawn when everyone else was out fighting, he protected her from Glory and refused to tell her anything even while he was being tortured and had no real reason not to tell her what he knew. Even before he had a soul, he fought for good even though it went against his nature as a vampire. Then, he gained a soul for Buffy because he wanted to be better, he never wanted to hurt her again. And he ultimately sacrificed himself to destroy the Hellmouth and save the world."
buffy,2z6ksq,blonderuby,6,Mon Mar 16 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"So how do you justify the Scoobies not staking him despite everything he did before that? Because all of the reasons you listed that Spike is good only apply to him starting with season 5. Personally I'm with OP in that I don't see why he shouldn't have been staked during or before season 4, other than Buffy not wanting to kill someone defenseless (because of the chip). And I think that's kind of a crummy reason when you consider all the horrific things he did before that. Prior to his ""I'm in love with Buffy so I should start doing good things"" phase he was a soulless vampire like any other, and those are almost always staked, even right after they rise from the grave and thus haven't even had the chance to do anything evil. Spike was one of the most feared vampires of all time, his reputation for evil and bloodshed second only to that of Angelus, yet he gets to live. He even reminded the Scoobies that he was evil and the only reason he was not killing them right then and there was because he was unable to due to the chip.  Edit: a word"
buffy,2z6ksq,Beloit,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"honestly, I think that the reason he wasn't killed off prior to s5 is that Whedon saw potential in him, there was still a reason for him to be there (In s4, the Scoobies want information about the Initiative, they paid Spike to fight, he was a source of comic relief, etc), and at that point there were probably already plans for what he'd become in s5. The chip, to me, seemed like it was just a reason to keep him around a while longer, because the reason Buffy didn't kill him while he had the chip was pretty much just pity. Why put the effort into killing him when he couldn't hurt anyone anyway? And then he could be useful because he was willing to kill demons just to fight.   other than that, I'm pretty sure the original reason Spike wasn't killed off was because fans loved him, so really, that's the reason. I do think, though, it should be pointed out that Spike did ally himself with Buffy even before season 4, when Angelus emerged after his 'true happiness' moment and was trying to end the world. Even though he originally came on the show as a big bad, Spike never wanted the world to end. Though he's not in any way good at that point, and only allied himself with Buffy to get Drusilla back, Spike being involved in that fight is what allowed Buffy to save Giles from Angelus. Also, Spike is the one who points out that Angel and Buffy could never truly be friends, which ties into Buffy and Angel getting back together which ultimately causes Angel to leave for LA. So, even though he has no real story reason to still be alive by season 5, he is, and he did play small but not unimportant roles up until the point where he began to truly be important."
buffy,2z6ksq,blonderuby,4,Mon Mar 16 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's all true--but it's pointless in terms of the narrative. Within the context of the story, there is NO reason Buffy wouldn't have dusted Spike as soon as possible."
buffy,2z6ksq,tclovescheese,4,Tue Mar 17 02:13:59 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the bulk of what you have said, I do want to point out that Buffy DOES acknowledge to Spike that she is treating him badly. When she breaks up with him in Season 6 she says: ""I'm using you. And it's killing me."" So, not a particularly other-focused apology, it is certainly an admission. This is the one and only time Buffy calls him William, acknowledging with that one word that he has humanity and can experience feelings."
buffy,2z6ksq,catdoctor,3,Mon Mar 16 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that what she says can be considered an admission.  However, it's not the only time she calls him ""William"":   Buffy: What are you doing here? Five words or less.  Spike: Out. For. A. Walk. (then) Bitch.  Buffy: Outside my house. At night. No one has time for this, William.  Spike: On your merry way, then."
buffy,2z6ksq,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 16 18:52:26 2015 UTC,I sit corrected!
buffy,2z6ksq,catdoctor,3,Mon Mar 16 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"'does Buffy deserve to die for her abuse of Spike?' she was dead remember?  also I honestly never though of it that way, however I am still amazed that spike lasted that long. as for a victim, spike was never a victim. his feelings were not feelings as he had no soul.  the only reason spike gave help was for his own desires, not to do good. he wanted to fight and kill but with the chip he couldn't hurt humans so turned to demons. honestly I am totally on xanader's side when it comes to spike. even when he got his soul back his persona didn't change."
buffy,2z6ksq,blonderuby,7,Mon Mar 16 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"Just because she was dead doesn't mean now that she was brought back she can't die again?  and she didn't deserve death so like i don't know what your point is?  and it's brought up multiple times that vampires can feel/love even with no soul, as Spike really loved Drusilla before he had a soul, Angelus loved Darla, etc. Even though he had no soul, he still felt things, and getting a soul doesn't invalidate his previous feelings? Spike knew he loved Buffy even when he didn't have a soul, and he felt the same after he got a soul. Spike has also been shown to be depressed, like after Drusilla left him.   I never said Spike's intentions were to do good the entire time, I know he only cared about doing good after he decided he loved Buffy, and he definitely only cared to fight demons in season 4 because of the chip, because he still wanted to fight/kill things but couldn't hurt humans. He only truly tried to be good in season 5. so again, not sure what your point is here?  and I don't know why you would expect his persona to change because of the soul? Spike's not like Angel, who has two distinct personalities depending on if he's souled or not, the only effect Spike's soul had was to make him feel remorse, to make him more human. I'm going to compare him to how Angel/Angelus is shown, as he's the only souled vampire we've seen. If you wanted to go deep into this, it could probably be attributed to the way they were as humans, how Spike was a sensitive poet while Angel really didnt give a shit, was a drunk and got into bar fights, treated women badly, etc. Spike didn't change much from human to vampire, still cared about his mother enough to want her to be around forever, loved Dru from the beginning, etc, even though he had no soul. Yes, he was evil, but he was never as bad as Angelus, and his personality remained the same because he simply never changed much. Even without a soul, Spike was much more human than Angelus could ever be, hell, arguably more human than Angel when he really was a human."

buffy,2z6ksq,KiraKira_,5,Fri Mar 20 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"his feelings were not feelings as he had no soul.   ""A soul is the thing that separates a human from a demon. It's the thing that points you north instead of south, that makes your instinct to do good instead of to do bad.  Therefore a vampire can feel love. They can have all the whims and quandaries of a normal person, if they're a vampire or a demon, but their basic instinct is to create chaos and evil and destruction, instead of love and bonding and nurturing and stuff. That's the basic difference.  A lot of demons, like Spike, for example, are not that different from a lot of people we know. It's not cut-and-dried. He is capable of great love, but great love is usually a very selfish thing, but he's trying.""   - Joss Whedon"

buffy,2z6ksq,AngelAmongUs,7,Mon Mar 16 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Buffy did some terrible things to Spike, I think blaming the abusiveness of their relationship up until the rape entirely on her, is ridiculous.   In Once More With Feeling Buffy kisses Spike and then in the next episode she rejects him. But he continues to pressure her even though he knows that she is going through depression and suicidal tendencies. He finally convinces her to have sex with him by making her believe that she's a demon ""you came back wrong"", which is incredibly fucked up.  As for this: ""If she wants to have sex, they have it, even if Spike says no""  Buffy is constantly saying no to Spike and he constantly ignores her. In Doublemeat Palace, he comes to her at work she says no, they end up having sex. In Dead Things, the balcony scene, Buffy says no, they do it anyway.  I am not saying Buffy was perfect in their relationship, because she wasn't. Up until the attempted rape scene she was just as abusive as he was, no more no less."
buffy,2z6ksq,blonderuby,3,Mon Mar 16 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"But he continues to pressure her even though he knows that she is going through depression and suicidal tendencies.    True depression is not something that a soulless vampire seems to be able to comprehend.   Darla: But you can escape.  You can escape it all.  Remember what it was like to get lost, huh?  Every thought a million miles away, every part of you being alive!  All you have to do is let me give you one little moment of happiness.    Buffy: So, that's what this is about. You feeling sorry for yourself, Spike?  Spike: I'm feeling honest with myself. You used me.  Buffy: Yes.  Spike: You told me that, of course. I never understood it though. Not until now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.  Buffy: You figured that out just now?  Spike: Soul's not all about moonbeams and pennywhistles, luv. It's about self-loathing. I get it. Had to travel 'round the world, but I understand you now. I understand the violence inside.  Buffy: Violence? William the Bloody now has insight into violence?  Spike: Not the same. As bad as I was, as evil and as wretched as I was, I never truly hated myself back then. Not like I do now.     .   He finally convinces her to have sex with him by making her believe that she's a demon ""you came back wrong"", which is incredibly fucked up.   Spike wanting to talk about what happened between them is not an unreasonable request in regards to their having kissed twice.   He seemed quite surprised when Buffy initiated their first encounter (Smashed), and their second (Gone).  Buffy was wrong to strike him and disparage his feelings. She should not have been hitting someone she kept kissing, and he should not have hit her back.  Regarding ""making her believe she is a demon"", he is one. He likes being a vampire, and is occasionally belittled by her because of it. He is under the belief that his chip only works on humans. One night he strikes Buffy back, and the chip does not fire. Thinking she is no longer human is  logical within the scope of his experiences.  In season five when Dawn attempts to raise her mother from the dead Buffy tells her this:   Buffy: You have no idea what you're messing with. Who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!  Dawn: (tearful) No, I-I know. It'll be her.  BUFFY: No. Now, Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. People come back ... wrong.     .   In Doublemeat Palace, he comes to her at work she says no, they end up having sex.   They actually have sex on a different night from the one where they had the conversation inside.   Timothy (cont'd): Oh, I'm back. You can take your break now.  (Buffy doesn't react right away. She glances toward the front of the restaurant. She can see something outside, through the glass. It's Spike, walking deliberately toward the back of the building. He's looking in at Buffy. They exchange a long look. Buffy turns and heads toward the back, taking off her hat.)   .   In Dead Things, the balcony scene, Buffy says no, they do it anyway.   True.   blaming the abusiveness of their relationship up until the rape entirely on her, is ridiculous.    I agree."
buffy,2z6ksq,averagebitca,6,Mon Mar 16 08:06:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Spike was perfect, nor am I saying that he shouldn't be faulted for his actions, because a lot of the times he was wrong, and he definitely did a lot of fucked up shit. I just wanted to focus more on Buffy for the sake of this comment because I don't often see people talking about how abusive she was to Spike, and because a lot of the time people are quick to talk about how terrible the attempted rape scene was (which, it was awful) without considering the fact that it was more or less the result of Spike snapping after the constant abuse, constantly being told he was worthless or not good enough for her, constantly hearing how evil and bad he was even when he was trying hard to be better and do good for her. I'm not saying that makes it at all right or even justifiable, just that it wasn't simply Spike being evil.  They are both at fault, they both have reasons for being horrible to each other (Buffy with her depression, Spike for not having a soul). But at least Spike fought to be better, where Buffy never apologized or seemed to really regret her actions.      (if i have any of my facts wrong please tell me, though, I just finished my first full watch through of Buffy and I may be forgetting some things?)"

I always saw that as her way of apologizing, it may not be enough but it's definitely there. As for not feeling regret, when Tara tells Buffy that she was human when she did those things, not a demon, Buffy begs Tara not to forgive her. Buffy is constantly regretting her actions in season 6.  I feel like we're coming from different places. You say you've seen people blame the relationship entirely on Spike. I've seen a lot of people blame the relationship entirely on Buffy."
buffy,2z6ksq,KiraKira_,5,Mon Mar 16 07:58:07 2015 UTC,The in-universe reasons the characters didn't kill him:   Season 2: They tried to.

buffy,2z6ksq,barre_chord_reality,-1,Mon Mar 16 23:28:47 2015 UTC,the chip is no reason not to kill him. buffy often credits the things that she kills to being the slayer and that is her duty.
buffy,2z6ksq,KiraKira_,11,Fri Mar 20 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"I think Buffy was mostly opposed to the idea of hurting someone who couldn't defend himself, what with the chip.  By The Anya Incident, she'd grown fond of him--arguably fell in love with him--and he skipped town immediately after the attempted rape.  Edit:  Also, Spike did a lot of good once he realized and accepted that he was in love with Buffy.  He was basically an on-call babysitter for Dawn, and he helped protect her from Glory even when he was being tortured.  He took care of her when Buffy died, and he fought with the Scoobies plenty of times.  Sure he was evil, but a sweet, adorable, funny kind of evil that helped get him a permanent role on Buffy, then Angel, then his own comics."

It's nice for the fans of course, but these actors have to sit through the same questions and stay at the same crappy hotels and spend lots of time away from friends/family, etc.   I have to assume that being available for so many con appearances must be related to a lack of new acting jobs for some people I know are always making con rounds, and I am sure they like the con money and knowing they have fans but they'd rather be on set somewhere with an acting gig.

I got out in early January.  I was told once: ""There is no such thing as rock bottom. There's only death and prison."" It can always get worse, until you're dead or forcibly locked up.  That's not enough to stop some of us. It wasn't enough to stop my father, who literally drank himself to death, it wasn't enough to stop me, and I think it may not be enough to stop Nick.  I don't know why I'm like this. I'm a mild-mannered computer programmer when I'm sober.  I wish I could talk to him. I'd tell him my story, tell him what jail was like. Tell him how it's so cold guys wear socks on their arms to try to keep warm, what it's like to not sit on a soft surface for 6 months, what it's like to have to get tested for blood diseases because while you were trying to defend yourself one of the times you got attacked, a guy grabbed your face and you had to bite his finger to get him off.  I'd tell him what it's like to have no friends left because you've alienated them all. (I expect he already knows that, and doesn't care, like I didn't.) Or lose your job (I expect he knows that too, ditto doesn't care), your driver's license.  Mostly, though, I'd try to tell him what it's like to be sober, and the main difference is, there isn't a black pit of hopelessness at the end of every day. The tradeoff is the catharsis. You lose that. But you're not someone that can have it. Other people can, you can't.

buffy,2z1kx4,Cervix-Pounder,9,Sun Mar 15 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"The TMZ Article has been updated with an interview.  ""A Tallahassee newspaper spoke with Brendon this afternoon who claims he's been off his depression medication which has led to his recent issues. He also claims that he was molested as a child by a teacher and it drastically changed his life. Click below to watch the interview. """
buffy,2z1kx4,doyle871,12,Mon Mar 16 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And how is he going to heal when in the next breath he claims he does these conventions because they make him happy? Flipping beds, crapping himself and demanding upgrades because he's a ""TV star"" doesn't seem like a happy guy to me.  ""I love meeting my fans."" Because they're the ones funding his benders."
buffy,2z1kx4,edna311,5,Sat Mar 14 19:53:47 2015 UTC,Is he not recurring on Criminal Minds anymore?
buffy,2z1kx4,Erawk,6,Sun Mar 15 02:18:18 2015 UTC,Yup -- it sounds like he only said that because he had another day left at the con and wanted to make sure he got his whole paycheck or something.
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,3,Sun Mar 15 04:04:44 2015 UTC,Weirdly according to The Richest he's worth 7 mill. You wouldn't have thought he'd need the money if that's true. I guess that could be tied up in property but still sell it and get a smaller place.
buffy,2z1kx4,doyle871,2,Sun Mar 15 04:11:08 2015 UTC,I can imagine that he'd easily blow through that much money. It's the sad thing of the current era that £1million or £5million doesn't get you all that much anymore!

buffy,2z1kx4,Fiend1138,12,Mon Mar 16 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"From the E! article:    Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum Nicholas Brendon was arrested on Friday for the third time in five months, for allegedly trashing a hotel room. Again.    The 43-year-old actor, who played Xander on the cult series and has also appeared on Criminal Minds, has been dealing with personal turmoil over the past few months. He was detained in Tallahassee, Florida, where he had traveled to attend the pop culture convention ALT*Con. He is accused of causing damage to property, worth between $200 and $1,000. He was released from a police jail after posting bail on Saturday, records show. Police have released a harrowing account of what allegedly occurred. Brendon has not commented about the incident. In a probably cause affidavit obtained by E! News, police say that they responded to a call made from a hotel about a stolen wallet and cell phone.    The manager at the front desk told an officer who arrived that he had contacted them at the actor's request and that Brendon had taken pills and alcohol and was walking around the hotel with blood on him and his clothes torn and wet from a toilet he says the actor had caused to overflow. During their conversation, Brendon arrived, wearing a T-shirt and pajama pants that had a crotch tear, the report stated.    The officer said that when he asked him what was going on, he told him, ""Not much, just hanging out. I'm in town to sign autographs."" He then asked the actor if he had called to report a stolen wallet and phone and that the actor said, ""Yes, but I don't want to do anything about it.""    They then both entered his hotel room, where the officer saw a wallet on a desk. Brendon confirmed it was his. He could not, however, find his phone.    ""I observed him with toothpaste all over his face and shirt, his pants were torn, he had defecated on himself and his pajama pants were wet below the knees,"" the officer wrote in the report. He said he also saw in the room a prescription pill bottle containing one pill, sitting on a dresser. A prescription for 10 pills was filled earlier that day, the officer stated.    He said Brendon had also during his stay occupied another, similar room, located on a higher floor, which was given to him after he was denied an upgrade. The officer visited it to try to locate the actor's phone and observed there a soaking wet carpet and bathroom floor, a smashed porcelain piece of décor, a damaged dresser, a landline telephone pulled out of its socket and a flipped bed.    The officer wrote that the manager told him that staff had at one point discovered Brendon sleeping in front of the door to the lower-level room, woke him up, and escorted him back to the upper-level one. The manager also told police that guests had complained that Brendon had knocked on their door and then walked in their room, after which staff escorted him out.    The officer wrote that during his conversation with the manager, another officer arrived and as they discussed the incidents and possibly arresting Brendon, the manager received a call from his staff that the actor was at the hotel bar. The police arrested him there. They say he was cooperative and also received a tetanus shot for a cut on his right thumb before he was taken to jail.    In October, Brendon arrested in Idaho for allegedly damaging property and resisting arrest. He later apologized, admitted to being under the influence of prescription medication and alcohol.    ""I intend to seek appropriate treatment and therapy for my medical ailments as well as my emotional demons,"" he said at the time, adding, ""During this difficult time, I appreciate understanding as I pursue rehabilitation—and I value support as I earn redemption with my family, friends, and fans.""    The actor's arrest in October took place just one week after he tied the knot with girlfriend Moonda Tee in Las Vegas, a week after he proposed to her. Four months later, in February, the actor's rep announced the two had called it quits. Days later, Brendon was arrested for grant theft and criminal mischief after allegedly causing damages in a hotel room in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and then skipping out on the bill. He was also in town for a fan convention at the time.  ""We are aware that Nicholas' actions are of a much deeper origin—and we are working toward creating a healthy environment for him to thrive in,"" his rep had told E! News. ""The past several months have been trying, and Nicholas' disease is damaging and consistently misunderstood. We are doing everything in our power at Camp Nick to assure his recovery."""
buffy,2z1kx4,noticebox,10,Sat Mar 14 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that he lives on the money off these appearances. They can't really just cancel them, I can't imagine he has a lot of money saved up."
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,7,Sat Mar 14 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yup. I think he's hooked on the easy money. Auditioning is a daunting thing, especially when he probably now has a bad reputation in the biz. And if you're depressed/addicted to alcohol, it's easier to slog around to cons and answer the same questions before an approving audience of fans than it is to sober up, go to tons of auditions and face rejection."
buffy,2z1kx4,edna311,5,Sat Mar 14 21:12:59 2015 UTC,I have a real problem with his new management (Bloody Bombshells). Either they don't want to cancel his appearances because of the money or because their scared he's going to fire them.
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,8,Sat Mar 14 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Can you spell ""opportunistic enablers?"" Because I can, and it looks a lot like ""Bloody Bombshells.""  At least this may stop the pathetic begging to get ""him"" verified on Twitter, even though he can't be bothered to actually tweet himself. It may be a whole day or two before they start that up again."
buffy,2z1kx4,doyle871,6,Sun Mar 15 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yup... I noticed that too. Yikes. I think it's weird Twitter won't verify him... I know people personally who have way less ""fame"" and way fewer followers who have been verified for years."
buffy,2z1kx4,edna311,7,Sun Mar 15 01:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's the demands of the modern media. He used to have a forum that he or his first wife would make a post on once a month and that was enough for the fans and it seems him, then he had a this podcast type thing where he would share what he was reading, what projects he was involved in again about once a month.  Now you have to tweet, post or broadcast in some fashion every day or even several times a day and not everyone is up for that.  As a fan I'd rather someone post something once a month than once a day if it was what they wanted to do rather than what they felt they had to do."

It Just seems like Nick's twitter account stopped being about him a long time ago And became more about how his account can help his new managers."

Clean-shaven, bright-eyed, totally sober as far as my wife and I could tell. We didn't go up to talk to him because he was charging $40 for an autograph, but from where we ate our lunch we could see him pretty well, and he seemed to be animated and friendly with the couple-dozen people who came up to him in that time.  That he's mixing pills and alcohol makes me really nervous. I don't know any actual numbers, but it seems whenever there's an overdose, it involves drugs mixed with alcohol. I really don't want to see Xander in the headlines that way."

buffy,2z1kx4,catdoctor,12,Sun Mar 15 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"He needs to get back with that Jaqui who used to basically escort him around cons, hand hold him the whole time not sure if she was officially his manager or just handled his con gigs, she's J Augusts rep now. He rarely had any issues then and started getting TV work. Since he left her he's had no end of issues.  I really hope he gets help anyone I know who's met him says he's a great guy sober and the stories have always been his acting is highly respected in the business but he's too unreliable to hire."
buffy,2z1kx4,doyle871,7,Sun Mar 15 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'd kill for the details on why Jaqui no longer works for him. Kahmeela, too, though she was only with him for a hot minute before he moved to these winners."
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,9,Sun Mar 15 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think Jaqui is too professional to ever tell, but yeah as edna311 says the reasons seem to becoming clear."
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,8,Sun Mar 15 04:38:55 2015 UTC,"My heart breaks for him. He's probably alienated everyone who loves him with his behaviour but I so wish there were someone who could help him. Niky needs someone like Robert Downey's Jr.'s wife to save his life, too."
buffy,2z1kx4,catdoctor,15,Sun Mar 15 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think people have tried. Alyson Hannigan tried to reach out to him on several occasions through Twitter a few years ago, ASH seemed so happy to see him when they met up and all the Buffy people seem to have good things to say, Joss has even given him a gig on the comics but you can only help those who want to be helped."
buffy,2z1kx4,waitressinthesky,11,Mon Mar 16 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"It makes you wonder. I feel like getting a gig as good/solid as ""Buffy"" so early on in your career could be a double-edged sword for a young actor. To have so many big fans and to have so much attention. You probably start feeling a bit entitled and aren't ready to hustle as hard once that big gig is over."
buffy,2z1kx4,thomclyma,12,Mon Mar 16 05:58:24 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, right when Buffy ended Fox had him shoot a pilot for a sitcom (that eventually wasn't picked up). So I can imagine that he was feeling pretty damn good about himself right before his career took a nose-dive.  With Kitchen Confidential, which was a couple of years after Buffy, if you watch the DVDs with the un-aired episodes you'll notice his character is used less and less. This made me think that his alcohol issues were already pretty bad when he was on KC.  Conventions might be his only source of real income. So yeah I can see how early success combined with an alcohol problem can lead to him ending up as a 43 year old man pissing and shitting himself in hotels across America."
buffy,2z1kx4,vosdka,6,Sun Mar 15 00:16:39 2015 UTC,Well put. I agree.
buffy,2z1kx4,Pheebalicious,7,Mon Mar 16 19:31:28 2015 UTC,I think he needs a heck of a lot more support than a tweet and a hug at a convention. The pattern of alcohol and drugs leading to destructive and disruptive behaviour is a desperate cry for help.
buffy,2z1lvb,GinaZaneburritos,8,Sat Mar 14 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"You have an incredible insight into the way Dawn and Faith relate to Buffy. :)  Personally, I wish the monks had made Dawn out of both of them. Faith was technically the slayer at the time when Dawn was made. Perhaps Faith’s perceived instability was taken into account."
buffy,2z1lvb,AngelAmongUs,3,Sat Mar 14 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, very insightful post! I had never really considered it from this perspective before, but your points make a lot of sense.  I would also add that there is some tension that could be seen as sibling rivalry between Faith and Dawn when they eventually meet in Dirty Girls...   DAWN: Does she have to stay here? 'Cause there's some nice hotels that welcome tried-to-kill-your-sister-types.  FAITH: Check it out, brat's all woman-sized.   And then later, the two of them bond by rebelling and going to the Bronze while Buffy, the bossy big sister, is away.  It's interesting to think about what their dynamic might have been like if Dawn had actually been there when Faith was introduced in the third season. She clearly remembers Faith, and resents her, but I wonder how a twelve-year-old Dawn would have reacted to a new Slayer blowing into town and becoming all buddy-buddy with her big sister. Jealousy, probably? Maybe initially hero worship, because Faith was the cool one and Buffy was a little more uptight and not as much fun?"
buffy,2z1lvb,Mollywobbles222,3,Sun Mar 15 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a mind bender, because Dawn was there in the third season, don't you remember? ;)   Sadly, I think Faith gets a much more thought out and fleshed out arc than Dawn does. She mostly languishes in season 6 and starts to come to her own in season 7, but nothing ever really comes of her aside from a few standout moments.   Anyway, thanks for the great post GinaZaneburritos."
buffy,2z1lvb,barre_chord_reality,2,Mon Mar 16 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, very insightful post!   Thanks :) If you ""brush up on your Buffy and Faith history,"" there's so many instances where they seem to have a ""sister"" dynamic - often using that exact word - that I thought it was strange it hadn't been discussed much before.   dynamic might have been like if Dawn had actually been there when Faith was introduced   Hmm, let me see :)   Dawn's attitude towards Faith in that scene you quoted reminds me of nothing so much as her attitude towards Riley in ""As You Were"":   Dawn: Agent Finn returns.  Riley: Hey Dawn. Look at you. I think you grew about a foot and a half.  Dawn: Lot can happen in a year.  Riley and Sam exchange glances. He's in the dog house and he knows it.    Dawn: So, you gonna say goodbye this time or just split all secret-agenty like last time?  Riley: Depends. Do I warrant a hug?  Dawn glares at him, then relents. Hugs him.   Dawn has a similar sort of dynamic with Spike, telling him that he'll ""wake up on fire"" if he ever hurts Buffy again. And she liked hanging out with him before; he even helped her break into the Magic Box.  I would guess that third season Dawn thought that Faith was super cool. 😎 Partly because Faith gets along with everyone (including Buffy's mom) and would be able to help protect Buffy (who had run away and had just returned). Also, Faith was initially skeptical that Angel was good again, and after seeing how scary Angelus was and how much he hurt her sister, I think Dawn would appreciate that about her.   I would guess that Faith was kind of outwardly annoyed by Dawn, but I think she would have liked having someone look up to her. Faith was like Xander in some ways, and didn't seem to have much use for school - which was, kind of, deep, you know? And she acted more like a real superhero than Buffy, who took her calling and responsibilities so seriously and was more often Clark Kent than Superman. Also, Faith had a tattoo.  I would guess that this all turned around dramatically with the events in ""Enemies."" And Faith was now - like Riley - more or less dead to Dawn. And she went back to idolizing Willow, ""who likes school as much as [her]."" I do wonder if she got the ""Want. Take. Have"" mantra from Faith, though. Not that it's unique enough that she couldn't have come up with it herself.  I just hope Dawn wasn't in the house during ""This Year's Girl."" :/ The monks probably made her be at a sleepover or something."
buffy,2z1lvb,KiraKira_,2,Wed Mar 18 06:46:01 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if you were going to do a post on this after you mentioned it the other day!  I'm glad you did because you brought up some really interesting parallels.  The only criticism I have is of the comparison between Buffy trying to kill Dawn and Faith.  It's kind of a tenuous link given that the context is so radically different.  In Buffy's dream, her smothering Dawn was representative of her guilt over feeling like she couldn't save Dawn from Glory, while her stabbing Faith was a direct result of Faith losing her shit and trying to kill people.  Buffy tried to kill all of her friends at some point or another (save Tara, I think) so I don't think that really means much other than that Buffy has intimacy issues coming out of her ears.  I think another way they might have set up Faith as a sister-like figure for Buffy is in her relationship with The Mayor.  Like we were talking about last night, The Mayor was a sort of counterpoint to Giles' character, and they behaved similarly toward their respective Slayers in that they were both significantly older, had a strong sense of propriety, and acted as father figures for Buffy and Faith despite having no blood ties.  Faith also seems to long for Joyce as a mother figure, telling her in This Year's Girl that she would have appreciated her much more than Buffy does.  Later, in seasons 5 and 6, Buffy and Dawn would both struggle with the loss of parental figures, Joyce and Giles, and sort of Tara and Spike, to a lesser extent.  It seems like the only major characters who consistently have a problem with losing their parents and parental figures are Buffy, Faith, and Dawn."
buffy,2z1lvb,KiraKira_,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you did because you brought up some really interesting parallels.   Thank you :)   The only criticism I have is of the comparison between Buffy killing Dawn and Faith. It seems like a tenuous link given that the context is so radically different.   I don't think it is, actually. Let me see if I can articulate why.  Buffy's decision to kill Faith is a direct result of what she feels she has to do to save someone close to her. It's something that she is conflicted about, that Xander and Wesley and the Council try to dissuade her from, but ""she's talking about watching her lover die,"" and she believes that ""this is what [Faith] wants."" Moreover, she is stunned for a moment after stabbing her, allowing Faith the chance to get away.  Buffy's killing Faith comes to symbolize - for her - the part of herself that is ""a killer."" She is unable to actually accomplish the deed, and when she returns she is willing to sacrifice herself. She doesn't know if Angel drinking from her will kill her (""Maybe not. Maybe if you don't take it all""), and it seems clear to me that she feels guilty for what she did, or what she thought of doing, or what she was willing to do to save someone who meant a lot to her.  Buffy is similarly conflicted about whether or not she should kill Dawn, and she similarly feels that she would sacrifice her for selfish reasons. In ""The Weight of the World,"" she says to Willow while in her catatonic coma state:    Buffy: I just wanted it over. If Glory wins, then Dawn dies. I would grieve and people would feel sorry for me. But it would all be over. And I imagined what a relief that would be. I killed Dawn.  Willow: Is that what you think?  Buffy: My thinking it made it happen. Some part of me wanted it.   In ""The Gift,"" Buffy says to Giles:   Buffy: The Spirit Guide told me Death was my gift. I guess that means a Slayer is really just a killer, after all.  Giles: I think you're wrong about that.  Buffy: It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, then I'm done with it. I'm quitting.   In both cases, Buffy makes a decision (or feels that she makes a decision) somewhere in her mind that Dawn and Faith have to die. She can't really live with those decisions, and comes out of them feeling self-sacrificial and with a renewed sense of ""she is my responsibility.""   the only characters who consistently have a problem with losing their parents and parental figures are Buffy, Faith, and Dawn.   You forgot Spike :) And Angel.   And Giles is a parental figure to Willow as well, whom she loses for a time. Xander has a complicated relationship with his family. I don't think these themes are limited to just a few characters."

She can't really live with those decisions, and comes out of them feeling self-sacrificial and with a renewed sense of ""she is my responsibility.""   That's a good point!   You forgot Spike :) And Angel. And Giles is a parental figure to Willow as well, whom she loses for a time. Xander has a complicated relationship with his family.   Spike and Angel don't seem to consistently deal with the same issues with their parents, though.  They both feel guilt over killing their families, but in Spike's case it's really only dealt with in one episode, and Angel's struggle with his father is more about guilt over never winning his approval and, in the end, killing him.  I guess you could say Spike struggles with his relationship with Angel as a sort of parental figure, but that strikes me more as two alpha wolves vying for dominance.  Does Giles have a parental relationship with Willow?  I always thought of that as more of a teacher/student relationship, definitely not as close as Giles and Buffy.  Giles never gets all that involved in Willow's personal life the way he does Buffy's, and he seems to have this Yoda thing going on with her in Season 7.  Giles doesn't dream about taking Willow to the fair or sing a song about standing in her way.  And, now that I think of it, most of the struggle that goes on with Giles' and Buffy's relationship is on Giles' end more than Buffy's--he's the one that debates leaving for 2+ years--so I'm tempted to take Buffy off that list.  Buffy losing her relationships with Joyce and Giles were ultimately more about her having to take on adult responsibility.  She misses both of them, of course, but most of the plot surrounding those events were focused on her being afraid of having to take care of herself and Dawn, while Dawn and Faith's issues were much more about feeling abandoned, whether by death or choice.  I guess I would actually broaden my original statement and say that Faith and Dawn both consistently struggle with abandonment issues, period, since they both end up getting pretty bitter about losing people all the time.  It defined both of their personalities for a pretty significant period of time--Faith for most of Season 3 and Dawn for most of Season 6.  But then I guess I'd have to put Buffy back on that list since she's always going on about the Slayer having to be alone.  But then I'd take her off that list again because she's the one who keeps pushing people away when they want to be close to her, which is pretty aggravating to watch.  I dunno."
buffy,2z1lvb,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Sun Mar 15 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"good point   Another similarity between these two events is that, in both cases, it's the blood of Faith and Dawn that is the crucial ""ingredient."" The blood of Faith (when drained) can save Angel, and the blood of Dawn (when drained) can save the world. Buffy ultimately offers her own blood in both of these cases rather than carrying out the death of either Dawn or Faith.  It's also worth pointing out that Buffy's blood in these situations is ""just as good"" as both Faith's and Dawn's. For the purposes of saving Angel and the world, it's exactly the same. She is able to ""stand in"" for each of them, because in a sense they are both like her, or part of her.  In ""Normal Again,"" although Buffy does try to kill all of her friends, it's Dawn specifically that the doctor identifies as the source of her conflict:   Doctor: The magical ""key."" Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion, actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate her need for a familial bond. (To Buffy) But that created inconsistencies, didn't it? Your sister. Your friends. All the people you created in Sunnydale. They're not as comforting as they were, are they? They're coming apart.   It's the conversation that she has with Dawn just prior to Willow bringing her the antidote that highlights her sense of the unreality of her life. And, later, when she makes her decision and says goodbye to her mother, it's Dawn that she saves:   Buffy: You're right... Thank you. Goodbye.  Joyce: Buffy...  Dawn: Help! Somebody!!  SLOW MOTION: Buffy stands up with the solid intent of The Slayer.  Buffy: Let her go.   Dawn is really the key (pun intended) figure in this episode. She has a unique ability to bring out Buffy's protectiveness, but also cause her to question who she is and struggle with her identity.  Or, rather, almost unique. :)"
buffy,2z1lvb,Schwartezz,2,Sun Mar 15 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"I blame Buffy partly for Faith turning ""Bad"".  In Faith's debut episode, Buffy acts so jealous over her presence.  Faith may have been naturally rebellious and inexperienced as a Slayer, but Buffy really puts out the vibe that she wants Nothing to do with Faith.    Then suddenly through the season, you see Buffy start bonding with Faith, partying and what not, but as SOON as Faith slips up and accidentally kills someone Buffy suddenly takes the high road.  That is what really drives the wedge in Faith and the rest of the group.  Idk, to me it came off as Buffy running to Giles to ""tattle"" so she could be the ""favorite"" again.     And Giles was even worse,  from Faith's first appearance his and Buffy's first reaction was something along the lines of ""If Faith takes over as Slayer Maybe Buffy can live a normal life"".   Overall I saw Faith as the Slayer that just wasn't Buffy.  She actually needed the support and instead got shafted which is why I can almost sympathize with her.  I guess you could say Dawn was kind of similar, she felt like her sister being the Slayer made her insignificant.  But Buffy also thought Dawn was the spoiled baby of the family who always had to tag  along.  My only conclusion is that Buffy is a borderline narcissist, who must be the center of attention. Haha!"
buffy,2z1lvb,The_Iron_Zeppelin,4,Sun Mar 15 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"I blame Buffy partly for Faith turning ""Bad.""   I agree :) Although I think where she really let Faith down was not so much in the beginning, but after Faith accidentally kills the Mayor's assistant. Even given Faith's tendency to attack first and ask questions later, that could easily have been Buffy. They were trading off staking vampires who were coming at them ""one at a time,"" and it happened to be Faith's turn.  As Giles pointed out later, it was an accident; things happen. They've happened before, and they likely will again. At a time when Faith needed support and acceptance, Buffy tries to impress upon her the gravity of her actions, which mostly just makes Faith feel defensive and awful.  Buffy doesn't really do that with Dawn. If I had to compare the two situations, I would say that both Faith and Dawn have a troubled ""origin story"" that makes them both kind of impulsive. Dawn doesn't even know what she is; she learns that she's ""only been alive for six months"" and all her memories of a loving family are fake. Faith never had memories of a loving family, and she's struggling to understand her role as a Slayer in a world which already has a Slayer.   I think that Buffy empathizes with both of them and tries to understand and help them. She says to Willow about Faith:   She had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be me.   And about Dawn:   It doesn't matter how you got here or where you came from. You are my sister. You couldn't annoy me as much if you weren't.    I think the differences between Buffy's reactions in season 3 and in season 5 have to do partly with the fact that she's matured in two years, and partly with the fact that she sees a lot more of herself in Faith. She loves and empathizes with Dawn, but she never used to be a green ball of energy. On the other hand, like Faith, she's a Slayer.   I think it also has to do with her guilt over the part she played in the Mayor's assistant's death. To her credit, she is also incredibly hard on herself when she thinks she killed someone in ""Ted"":   Buffy: He was a guy. He was a weird, sleazy guy but he was a person and I killed him.  Willow: Don't say that.  Buffy: Why not? Everybody else is. And it's the truth.  Xander: It was an accident.  Buffy: I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.   Faith killing someone, accidentally or not, freaks Buffy out on a deep level, because she knows how close she is, sometimes, to doing the same. I think she's harder on Faith than Faith deserves because she feels a real need to deny an empathetic response in that situation.   And she doesn't have the same sort of conflicted feelings about Dawn's situation. So I think that's the main difference."
buffy,2z1lvb,Schwartezz,2,Mon Mar 16 19:15:02 2015 UTC,Well said.
buffy,2z1lvb,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Mon Mar 16 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Buffy just ditched Faith as soon a she killed someone. The wedge came from the fact that Buffy wanted them both to take on the moral responsibility of killing a human while Faith just brushed it off as part of the job. Yes they saved lives, but Buffy had the moral compass that directed her towards taking ownership of her negative actions, even if her positive outweigh them. And she did try to help Faith for a long time, she didn't just tattle and run. Let us also not forget Faith went to Giles first and tried pinning it on Buffy.   I sympathize with Faith too because she never had what Buffy did in regards to a loving mother, a strong father figure and a group of frieds that would stand by her for death and beyond. But she did have a choice in which she could have had all that, just as Willow tells her. So she instead turned to someone who offered that love and guidance, even if he was evil and wanted to be a big, giant snake. Giles and Buffy did offer her support, but Faith had the ""do it alone"" attitude. Lets not forget the betrayal of Gwen Post, a person supposedly on the good side and of authority that is there to guide and train her, turns around and unleashes the power of a nasty glove on her.   Buffy treats Dawn like a little sister because that's what she is. Being the baby I can relate a lot to Dawn, but ha the same overprotection and clearly annoyed older sisters when I tried to join on the ventures.   You may not like the character of Buffy, but to argue she is borderline narcisstic is quite humorous to me. Someone completely self involved doesn't save the world. A lot."
buffy,2z1i3t,maxi106,8,Sat Mar 14 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"Garlic as a vampire repellent dates back to ancient Eastern European legends and is mentioned in the original ""Dracula"" novel."
buffy,2z1i3t,catdoctor,7,Sat Mar 14 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"And in the Buffy episode 'Dracula', Spike laments that Count Dracula's story getting popular is the reason everyone knows how to kill vampires now. Don't remember if he specifically mentioned garlic in the episode."
buffy,2z1i3t,AngryWizard,8,Sat Mar 14 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"Willow does:   A lot of it we already knew… Turn offs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turn ons: nice duds, minions and long slow bites that last for days…"

I get very sick if i eat anything containing garlic or garlic powder, I've always been a biter, and I think I'd enjoy having a minion.   And thanks for finding that, I vaguely remembered garlic being mentioned somewhere in the episode."
buffy,2z1i3t,AngryWizard,8,Sat Mar 14 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"The only official explanation that the Buffy-verse has hinted at is that it smells ""foul"" to them; which makes sense considering their advanced olfactory capabilities.    Angel:  You’re no different from the rest of them, - are you, father?  (His father spins around and stares at him)  Cowering in their houses – boarding up the windows – smearing that foul herb in the doorways.  You’d think something evil – and vile – and monstrous - had taken to terrorizing this village –and everyone in it."
buffy,2z1i3t,AngelAmongUs,11,Sat Mar 14 20:40:37 2015 UTC,Just makes me think how much it would suck to be an Italian Vampire.  Garlic is fucking delicious.
buffy,2z1i3t,thewanderingway,7,Sat Mar 14 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"Also in ""Passion"" during Willow's ""sleepover with weapons."" It wa s never shown or described. Maybe it's a  kind of super-teargas effect, maybe even a nerve gas that makes their movement s uncontrollable. Probably temporary, presumably doesn't kill them and they recover after.  Aimee Mann mentioned that Sunnydale isn't the only ""vampire town"" in Buffyverse America. Maybe some out-of-the-way shops carry a pepper spray with microfine ground garlic added. (I know they do in my ficverse, but canon is lacking.)"
buffy,2z1i3t,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sat Mar 14 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"We see throughout the series that garlic is used to keep vampires away from places where they are not welcome. Buffy uses it to keep Spike and Angelus away and her weapon trunk is lined with it as well. We can assume that while it may not kill a vampire, its presence is enough to keep one from entering. It's never really listed as a weakness or used in combat, so one can assume that it more or less functions as something that a vampire is unable to be around. Thus it's logical to extrapolate that it has to do with something about garlic causing discomfort to a vampire. I'd wager it's something akin to an allergy and a vampire's enhanced senses cause the allergic reaction to pop up even when they're not in physical contact with or have ingested it."
buffy,2z1i3t,Iokuas,2,Sun Mar 15 07:59:29 2015 UTC,"We can assume that while it may not kill a vampire, its presence is enough to keep one from entering.   I don't think it's that powerful - after all, Buffy and Willow did end up ""changing the locks"" with an obscure spell to keep Angelus from entering Buffy's home.  Honestly I think it's just vaguely obnoxious to them.   It's never really listed as a weakness or used in combat   I'd wager it was considered for comedic effect at some point (like Xander throwing, what was it, a potato? at the syphilis bear) but probably axed for a handful of good reasons.  Sidebar: They never really addressed the whole holy water thing - it's effective as hell, why not just roll around with super soakers? And I think the answer to that is ""well because that would make for a really crappy show""."

buffy,2z1i3t,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:35:36 2015 UTC,Actually the legend of vampires and garlic originates from people trying to explain the disease of porphyria. Victims are sensitive to sunlight and garlic aggravates their many other allergies. So they tend to avoid it.

buffy,2yxqk4,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sat Mar 14 00:10:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that Glory is a great villain :)  I'm not so sure I really think of her as completely female, though. In any case, she's not human, so I have trouble seeing her as ""a smart, powerful"" woman like Buffy. I also disagree that she's in control of herself, pretty much ever ;)  She's very traditionally feminine in terms of her dress and mannerisms, and everyone uses female pronouns to refer to her, but she is also called a ""hell god."" We never see her in her actual, normal, non-Earthly state, and it's unclear to me just how ""female"" she is. I kind of think of her as just as female as Jasmine from Angel. Also Illyria, although that's a somewhat different case.  The writers certainly intended to have Buffy fight someone who looks like her - ""same dress size"" is, I believe, how Doug Petrie put it - but that doesn't really make her at all similar to Buffy.   Edit: It's interesting to me that we have two ""gods"" that appear as female who are never referred to as ""goddesses,"" while the show does explicitly use the word ""goddess"" at least once: when Willow does the spell with the scythe in ""Chosen."" It makes me wonder whether ""goddess"" is something that only characterizes the Earth and the root systems that Willow was studying in ""Lessons."" Perhaps gods represent a different kind of power.  This would help explain why Illyria refers to herself as ""God-King."" I always had a vague idea that in Illyria's time, ""king"" and ""god"" were neutral words as well, and didn't refer to any particular gender. It was left for the muck to make subtle distinctions like that ;)"
buffy,2yxqk4,KiraKira_,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"I thought Illyria was explicitly male, just crammed into a female body?  It's been a long time since I watched Angel.  I should do that."
buffy,2yxqk4,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Mar 14 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"Prior to being installed in a human body, Illyria was explicitly an ""it."" The use of that pronoun over any other was actually important to the plot at one point.  There are a few lines that suggest a masculine identity for Illyria, but nothing definitive. ""A true ruler is as moral as a hurricane - empty but for the force of his gale,"" comes to mind.   As Illyria loses some of her (its) power, and explores more of the human identity she (it) now has, I think you could say Illyria becomes more of a female character. And the characters in Angel seem to alternate freely between referring to Illyria as ""it"" and ""her,"" but mostly using ""her.""  Illyria is actually a totally different case from both Jasmine and Glory, and I'm kind of sorry I brought it up :) But it's another example of someone who looks female but isn't exactly."
buffy,2yxqk4,faaackksake,2,Sat Mar 14 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"i don't think we can assign gender (at least as humans understand it) to 'hell gods' or the old ones, like this http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/buffy/images/3/3e/OldOneIllyria.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101112071712 is illyrias original form, like you say 'it' is the only appropriate term..."

buffy,2yxqk4,GinaZaneburritos,10,Sat Mar 14 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"I think you could say many of the same things about Warren.  Whether this kind of overtly misogynistic villain is the best or most suited villain for the series ... I don't know. I think it comes down to personal preference and how you like to interpret the overall themes of power and feminism in the show. It feels a little too ... un-subtle for me :) And a little simplistic; there's a lot more going on in the series than this kind of violence against women theme.  I think this is one of the things I liked about the portrayal of Riley. He had a lot of old-fashioned ideas, but he was still a good guy, and Buffy loved him.   Buffy: Maybe I'm taking you home, ever thought of that? What is it, you think boys can take care of themselves, and girls need help?  Riley: Yeah.  Buffy: Oh, that is so Teutonic."
buffy,2yxqk4,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Mar 13 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"The main reason I felt it more about Caleb than Warren was that Warren basically never actually beat Buffy, apart from that one time with the orbs, whereas Caleb immediately foils Buffy in a traditional beat-down.  I do get that it was a pretty un-subtle way of doing it, but I think it kinda worked considering how close to the end of the series it was, and how he was essentially summing up everything the show (and women in general) had come up against."
buffy,2yxqk4,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Mar 13 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, Warren was fundamentally a weakling, not to mention not actually brave. Caleb had the bravery of a madman and superstrength from fusing with the First.  Still, as it played out the only reason Buffy beat Warren was because Jonathan finally grew a morality. But that's as far as it goes. (I have to wonder, if Jonathan hadn't done that, would  warren have stayed long enough to beat Buffy to death or broken off to make his getaway while she was still alive? My entire Ice Age buffy ficverse is based on wArren getting away before she was killed.)"
buffy,2yxqk4,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I always figured the reason the Trio were the main badguys for most of S6, and why Buffy had such a hard time getting rid of them, was to kind of show how much the return to her crappy life from heaven was getting to her, as they probably would have been dealt with in an episode or two when she was on top of her game (S5/7)."
buffy,2yxqk4,SeekALifeUseful,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, that makes sense. But I have a feeling Buffy might not have walked away the winner in that one specific fight without Jonathan."

buffy,2yxqk4,GinaZaneburritos,9,Sat Mar 21 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"I think Faith and Kendra are also good dramatic foil for Buffy as a character. They represent the two extremes of being a slayer.  Kendra follows all of the rules. She goes where her Watcher tells her, does all of the studying, does not have relationships with family or friends, etc. She is the subservient slayer that was desired when the First Slayer was created.  Faith, on the other hand, is completely on her own after her Watcher is murdered, and it doesn't sound like she really followed the rules too much before then. She too lacks family and friends but fills that void with a reckless lifestyle.   In getting to know both of these women, Buffy sees the strength in her own style of slaying and her good fortune to have the family and friends she has surrounded herself with. That is what makes her so successful compared to many of the slayers before her.  So not villains but still perfect for Buffy breaking the trope of what is expected of women in society with Kendra as meek and subservient and Faith as sexualized bad girl."
buffy,2yxqk4,KiraKira_,3,Fri Mar 13 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"I thought Fillion did a great job as Caleb and he was certainly a fine villain for that season. But what you like most about him is what kind of turns me off a bit: his overt sexism. One of my favorite things about Buffy was how they would make these points using subtext and allegory. Angel has sex with Buffy for the first time and becomes an asshole. A pretty common story for a lot of teenage girls, except he becomes an asshole because he's a cursed vampire. The show addresses toxic teenage relationships without explicitly saying they're addressing the issue. It's clever and not at all ham-fisted.  With Caleb all subtext goes out the window; it's pure text. He's an evil misogynist plain and simple. That certainly makes him a bad guy, but not one of the most clever villains the show ever came up with."
buffy,2yxqk4,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sat Mar 14 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"It's not like Caleb was the only overt misogynist on the show, though.  There were several characters who were about different forms of misogyny.  The Mayor was misogyny + paternalism (putting Faith in that sundress), Warren was misogyny + sexual entitlement (rape by magic/robots), and Caleb was misogyny + religion."
buffy,2yxqk4,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Mar 14 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your characterization of the Mayor as a misogynist. I mean, ""misogyny"" means ""hatred of women,"" and I don't think that describes him at all. He's occasionally condescending or paternalistic, but he's kind of that way to everyone. I suppose you could maybe call him sexist, as indeed you could also call Riley or Xander at times, but he has been alive a long time. It seems pretty normal to me.  The Mayor is definitely evil, and I think it's debatable whether he treats Faith well, but he doesn't look down on her because she's female. Putting Faith in a sundress is something that makes her feel self-conscious, but not ashamed or debased. He respects her abilities and indulges her wishes and genuinely doesn't want to see her harmed."
buffy,2yxqk4,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Mar 14 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Misogyny doesn't have to be as simple as ""grr woman bad, vaginae dirty!"" though.  Like I said above, I think it's just a different kind of misogyny that's maybe harder for people to pick up on because it's so much more normalized for us than serial murder and rape (which, honestly, I don't even know if as many people would have been as averse to Warren's rapey tendencies if Katrina hadn't explicitly said, ""This is rape,"" but that's a whole 'nother conversation).  Patriarchal ideals for women are inherently misogynistic, and like you said, he's very old school.  He displays a distaste for Faith's sexuality--not just in a ""this is awkward"" kind of way, followed by vigorously cleaning his glasses, but a ""stop acting like a slut"" kind of way--and tries to make her into a child for him to control.  He's condescending to everyone, that's true, but it manifests itself much differently with Faith than Mr. Trick or Allan Finch.  It's a lot like how the Council (patriarchy) fears the Slayer's power (female power) and thus seeks to control it, only less metaphorical."
buffy,2yxqk4,StateYellingChampion,2,Sat Mar 14 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we're going to agree, but let me see if I can address some of the points you raised :)   he displays distaste for Faith's sexuality ... in a ""stop acting like a slut"" kind of way   I assume you're talking about this scene:   Faith: Thanks, sugardaddy.  The Mayor: Oh! Faith. I don't find that sort of thing amusing. I'm a family man.   I'm not sure how you would have wanted him to react. :) No, he doesn't get flustered and awkward (as Giles does when Faith says ""if I'd known they came that young and cute I would've requested a transfer""), but then again, he's not shocked and uncomfortable in the same situations that Giles is. He unambiguously rejects her advances, but in a lighthearted way (""I don't find that sort of thing amusing"" - giving her a face-saving ""out"" by calling it a joke) and hints that what he is interested in is not some sort of sexual favor but more of a familial loyalty.   As for your theory that he dislikes her sexuality in general ... I don't think so. He encourages her to seduce Angel. He's not blind to the fact that she's sexualized, nor does he want to change it. He does seek to use it to his advantage, but she's not unwilling. In fact, she's the one who is upset when Angel rejects her; she complains that she tried, and he tells her that it wasn't her fault. When Faith brings Angel to the Mayor, they engage in a kind of ""dad meets the new boyfriend"" scene, with her asking ""can I keep him?"" and the Mayor telling him not to keep her out too late.   tries to make her into a child for him to control   The writers were trying to portray a loving father/daughter relationship between them, and I think what you're seeing is what they intended. But a father/daughter relationship is not inherently misogynistic. And as for the fact that he casts himself as her ""father,"" that is at least as much Faith's doing as his. She's looking for a father figure, in a sense - someone to support her and guide her and give her the love and attention she craves. Her first Watcher was killed by Kakistos; Giles was Buffy's Watcher, and Gwendolyn Post turned out to be evil. The fact that he picks up on her neediness and desire to be taken care of and responds by putting her up in a nice apartment and caring for her does not make him a misogynist. It makes him very human.   tried to tame Faith. She was wild, strong, and he tried to turn her into a child and steal her power for himself   He used her as an asset, that's true, to advance his own goals. But I don't see him so much as ""taming"" her so much as channeling her abilities and power for (probably mutual) benefit. She believes that he cared for her and that she would be ""by his side"" when he ascended, and his behavior in ""Graduation Day, Part 2"" supports the interpretation that he did care for her, deeply, and thought of his ascension as also ""her day.""  Faith felt rejected by the Scoobies, by Buffy, by Giles, by everyone. No one really liked or trusted her. By going to the Mayor, she was looking for someone who would not judge her and would appreciate her. I would say that she felt as though in him she found the kind of recognition she so needed. In fact, the First takes his form in the seventh season to remind her of the person who has always ""stood by her"": ""I'll always be with you, firecracker.""  I think where we most disagree is in seeing a paternal type relationship as inherently messed up. I don't think that Giles displays any kind of misogynistic attitudes towards Buffy.   Moreover, I think the show as a whole is more about people, and I think it does the series a disservice to point to actions characters take against each other and call it ""misogynistic"" just because one is male and the other is female. Most of the time, they're simply exploiting a vulnerability, or seizing an opportunity, rather than acting out of some antipathy towards women."
buffy,2yxqk4,KiraKira_,1 point,Sat Mar 14 06:04:16 2015 UTC,"That's one of the main reasons I feel that, in a non-supernatural world without the deep temptations of eternal life and unbelievable power, the Mayor would have been a very decent person, with a bit of a control complex. Most of the bad things he did were require d by the choice he made. (as a comp[arison, look at Stephen King's The Stand. Several of the Vegas characters who supported Randy Flagg, like Whitey the cook or Corrigan the detective, would have, in an apocalypse story without a supernatural element, been just two more of the good guys.)"
buffy,2yxqk4,StateYellingChampion,2,Sat Mar 14 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's my age and politics, but I always saw the sundress as just one of several attempts to help Faith grow into a  more complete person."
buffy,2yxqk4,StateYellingChampion,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that Warren was an overt misogynist, which I found to be a smart critique of geek culture. Shows like Big Bang Theory celebrate it, but there's definitely a dark side to nerdom. Warren's like a proto-neckbeard.  I recall that The Mayor called Buffy a whore when she was unconscious in the hospital, but I didn't really pick up on anything overt other then that. If his paternalistic attitude towards Faith was  an outgrowth of a hidden misogynistic tendency it only affirms my point. It was handled subtly unlike Caleb's."
buffy,2yxqk4,lecturermoriarty,2,Sat Mar 14 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think The Mayor's misogyny was all that subtle.  One of the big things about his character was that he was like a counterpoint to Giles.  Only unlike Giles, who sought to empower Buffy with his patriarchal role in her life (which I take some issue with, but that's neither here nor there and Buffy does eventually grow out of him) The Mayor, in a lot of ways, tried to tame Faith.  She was wild, strong, and he tried to make her into his little girl and steal her power for himself.  It's certainly a different kind of misogyny than we see with Warren and Caleb, and it's a kind that often goes unnoticed, much like Riley's benevolent sexism.  Basically, I think it was less that the writers handled it in a subtle way, and more that we, as viewers, are less prone to pick up on it.  Hell, maybe the writers didn't even realize it's what they were doing, I dunno.     Warren's like a proto-neckbeard.   Hah!  I love that!  Perfect description!"

buffy,2yyex7,The_Iron_Zeppelin,4,Fri Mar 13 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"Ok so you all remember when Buffy gets that Slayer ""Emergency Bag"" from Robin.  She uses the Shadow Caster to go back and Meet the Shadow Men.  The Shadow Men offer to make Buffy stronger by adding more of the Slayer Essence to her which was essentially pure demon essence.    We know that Buffy denies the power from them, out of principle.  What do you guys think would have happened to Buffy's character had she accepted the essence?  She would have undoubtedly been Stronger, Faster and increased Slayer abilities all around, but what other ramifications could it have caused.  Could Buffy have been corrupted by it?  Possibly become more demon than human? I wonder if maybe she would have taken on the persona of the Wishverse Buffy. All business without the personality.   What do you guys think?"
buffy,2yyex7,KiraKira_,5,Fri Mar 13 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Oh... I thought you were just pointing out what appears to be a demonic boner.   Well we can infer that slayers already have a tendency toward darkness, based on Faith's murderiness and Buffy's attraction to vampires, so obviously that would be amplified.  I don't necessarily think she'd be more like wishverse Buffy because that Buffy, much like Faith, had been shaped by life circumstance more than demonic power.    I think, given that Slayers already walk a fine line between good and evil, it probably would have irreparably tipped that scale.  I don't think she would have really been a Slayer anymore because evil things don't exactly have much drive to kill other evil things unless it's for selfish reasons."

buffy,2ywmsq,hogslaper,10,Fri Mar 13 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"""Dislike"" is relative.  I consider it the worst season of Buffy, which still makes it better than 99% of television ever made :)  I don't remember (assuming I ever knew) whether they knew it was the last season from the beginning, or if the cancellation came later.  But part of what makes it really not work for me is the sense of ""starting over.""    It starts out feeling like another Season 4 - In the sense of it feeling like a transition to a new iteration of Buffy in the way 4 transitioned us from High School to adulthood.  They rebuild the High School, they introduce new characters like Principle Wood.  And then it ends up being the final season and (a) those things never really go anywhere and (b) the time that was spent on them seems wasted.  I'd have rather seen that time spent on the existing characters and story lines.  As Big Bads go, I also found the First underwhelming and boring.  Rumors leaked about Clare Kramer and the others being on the set (for what turns out to just be one scene of the First taking their forms).  I was really hoping they'd come up with a premise to make the final season a sort of Buffy ""Sinister Six"" type deal."
buffy,2ywmsq,bookant,19,Fri Mar 13 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't dislike S7, but it felt like a completely different show from the preceding six seasons. (Well, the preceding five, anyway -- S1 was also pretty different.) The characters' actions were pressed into the service of the narrative more often than the reverse, a ""top-down"" approach to writing that was uncharacteristic and often heavy-handed. The expansive themes of the season weren't well-served by the rushed and overly pat finale. Contrast it with the S5 finale, which would have been a much more believable and organic ending to the series. (Not that I'm complaining that it wasn't -- S6 was and remains my favorite season.)  ""Storyteller"" was a great episode, but it was notably distinct from the season as a whole. Using Andrew as an unlikely POV character was genius."

Only for her lover to tell her they can be together by committing suicide and then finding out Tara was The First Evil.

The most important change in the Slayer lineage that Buffy changed got totally lost in all the chaos. It was one of my favorite statements of the show, but you almost forget about it immediately because of the all the sub plots of the Potentials, Andrew etc.   In all, I really enjoyed it -- but it could have used a two hour finale to button things up."
buffy,2ywmsq,barre_chord_reality,3,Fri Mar 13 14:13:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah the finale could have been longer. It wasn't made clear on first look if only the Potentials we see on screen in the bus are the only ones who survived the destruction of Sunnydale or if there are more who got out. Secondly it was not clear to me why Spike had to wear that necklace (or am I remembering wrong). Is Dawn a actual Potential, (which makes no sense because she isn't technically a biological sister of Buffy)? So many questions I could ask that would have been nice to wrap up.   My biggest question... are the Scoobies plus surviving Potentials the only living people to escape Sunnydale?"
buffy,2ywmsq,hopesdead,2,Fri Mar 13 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"Dawn wasn't a potential, it was actually Amanda who was the potential, although you might be remembering another episode where it seems like Dawn might be a potential. ;)   There was a tie-in with Angel as to why Spike had to wear the amulet in the finale.

Spike also mentions to Buffy when she is thrown out by the group that he can walk into any house because everyone just abandoned everything.   I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the explanation for it was that everyone could sense something bad was going to happen and had come up with all different reasons to evacuate the city. Especially since the government must keep tabs on Sunnydale and the Slayers.   And for what it's worth, the comics do talk a bit about the destruction of Sunnydale, too. I'm not sure if there are any other stories commenting on it."

It was very well done and Emma knocked it out of the park, such complexity played so well.   I do feel that the season 5 finale was stronger and would have been a fantastic series finale. Don't get me wrong, I'm so glad we were able to have a 6 and 7, but I agree with stillnotking in the fact that 5 was more believable and organic."

buffy,2ywmsq,mac117,2,Fri Mar 13 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Joss talks about it in the finale commentary.  He was going to grant Buffy a wish from the Powers That Be and have her wish for Tara to come back to life.  Honestly, I'm glad it didn't happen.  I loved Tara, and I cry like a baby every time she dies, but I feel like it's important for Willow that she retains that loss and continues to overcome it.  Plus it would have been unfair to everyone else who died throughout the series, like Jenny or Joyce."
buffy,2ywmsq,fifosexapel,2,Fri Mar 13 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"It is not my favorite nor least favorite, but some of the speachifying she does, that even they make fun of in the show Andrew narrates does get old.  I enjoyed it much more when we watched angel and buffy intermingled"

buffy,2ywmsq,windspirit,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed S7, the only reason it's not my favourite is because it's a bit tonally confused in the first half.  You've got the whole ""back to the beginning"" arc with the school - a great idea in my opinion, but just a bit too much like S1/2 and not as heavy as S5/6 - which really clashed with the darker potentials/sleeper-agent/end of the world arc.  I also really like Caleb (I don't know whether or not that's a popular opinion or not)."
buffy,2ywmsq,windspirit,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"my top three seasons are: 3, 5, 7...i really like 7. it goes all dark and deep, goes into the lore, spike all soul having and crazy, faith, caleb"
buffy,2ywmsq,Tschaet,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:46:50 2015 UTC,The only real reason I didn't like season 7 is because of how messed up Spike got from his soul. But it got better towards the end when he was more or less back to his bad self!
buffy,2ywyjj,barre_chord_reality,22,Fri Mar 13 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"I liked Dawn fine.  I thought she showed a lot of courage and cunning to be so young.  She was craving attention a lot in Season 6, but of course she was.  Both her sister and mother had died within a few months of each other, and when Buffy came back she was hardly acting like Sis of the Year.  And everyone was still treating her like a child after she'd suffered the kind of loss that would make anyone grow up quick. Plus she'd gone from being this magical key that everyone needed to protect to just... Dawn.  I'd probably have abandonment issues after that,too, and that's without all the teenage hormones."
buffy,2ywyjj,KiraKira_,9,Fri Mar 13 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"I always feel the most sympathetic for Dawn in Potential, cause you can see how much she wants to be something more than ""just Dawn.""  I think that's really a turning point for the character for me, where she sort of accepts who she is and decides to do a better job filling her own shoes, so to speak."
buffy,2ywyjj,CJGibson,8,Fri Mar 13 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"I think Dawn is one of the better examples of an abandonment narrative in pop culture, whether this was intentional or not is beyond me.   It's interesting that her abandonment arc is only directly referenced in the episode ""Older and Far Away"" but after that, Dawn is just kind of there for the remainder of the two seasons. It's a really fascinating look at something that isn't very often addressed in TV or movies, at least not very well.   It's not a subject that's easy to tackle or for the audience to digest. As the case with Dawn, nobody cared."
buffy,2ywyjj,shypye,4,Fri Mar 13 15:56:47 2015 UTC,It's Joss... everything is intentional lol
buffy,2ywyjj,Sammyboy616,3,Fri Mar 13 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"I always though she helped a lot in S7, doing research and fighting and sort of acting like Giles Junior at times.  Also yeah, I think it's interesting how well they handled her arc, but how badly they screwed up Connor's in Angel at the same time (to the point where they just Deus Ex Machina him out of the show at the end of S4, without really ending any of his arcs)."
buffy,2ywyjj,b_knickerbocker,13,Fri Mar 13 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"If we find Dawn to be annoying as a teenager, I can only imagine how annoying she would be as a young child. In general, most children on TV are terrible actors. I would rather be annoyed by a teenager who can act than a six year-old mugging for the camera.  Also, Dawn finally came into her own in Season Seven and wasn't annoying at all. Still better than Connor."
buffy,2ywyjj,KiraKira_,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, would you have felt more empathy for Dawn if she had been a helpless little girl? Would people tend to feel more sorry for a little girl than a teenager?   As a teenager, some of that vulnerability is lost, thus the reason I think so many people don't really care about what happens to Dawn, just that they find her annoying."
buffy,2ywyjj,bwburke94,4,Fri Mar 13 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it helps that Michelle looked very mature for Dawn's age, despite not being much older than her.  I think 14/15 is still young enough that you get that vulnerability, but Dawn looks at least 18 throughout the show, even when they were trying to dress her exclusively in the cute pastel clothing."
buffy,2ywyjj,quintus_aurelianus,3,Fri Mar 13 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"See, I think that's a big part of it. She looks basically like the rest of the gang, and obviously towards the end of the show Michelle grows to be quite a bit taller than Sarah.   Had Dawn been portrayed by a much younger child-like girl, I think fans would have possibly felt different about her, and possibly bad for her in some way."
buffy,2ywyjj,The_Iron_Zeppelin,8,Fri Mar 13 17:10:51 2015 UTC,"Probably an annoyance to all of us. Some things never change.  Though I assume 14 year old Dawn was ""written"" as younger in a meta-sense because the Monks needed someone Buffy would protect."
buffy,2ywyjj,Sammyboy616,5,Fri Mar 13 15:09:39 2015 UTC,I like Dawn.  I think people just don't like change.
buffy,2ywyjj,BrittBrat893,7,Fri Mar 13 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"I dont care what anyone says, Dawn was a great character in my opinion.  In The Body where you see that complete breakdown of Dawn behind the glass.  Its just so believable its one of the most emotional moments between Buffy and Dawn in all of the show.    Had she been younger, I would have been less impressed.  A child that young wouldnt have translated well in The Body.  They probably would have had no choice except to keep Joyce alive to watch over a younger Dawn.  Having season 6 Buffy interact with a 6 year old Dawn the way she had originally would have made me hate Buffy as a character for neglecting a 6 years old.  Those are my thoughts."
buffy,2ywyjj,BrittBrat893,4,Fri Mar 13 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"I've actually always been sort of sympathetic towards Dawn.  Her freak-outs in season 5 were totally understandable: she's just found out her life was a lie and she shouldn't exist, which I doubt most adults would be able to handle.  And in season 6, she never seemed to be perpetually annoying or badly written, like Connor in Angel or Carl Grimes in the Walking Dead.  Plus she was a badass +member of the scoobies in Season 7, and was actually pretty helpful most of the time, but everyone else always seems to forget that."
buffy,2ywyjj,amalgamatron,3,Fri Mar 13 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"I felt bad for her in general. I know what it is like to be a little sister, the baby of the family, to have people coming and going in your life so easily. I sympathized a lot with her because I could always see myself in her. I really can't stand that she gets so much hate because it seems like no one cares what it must be like for her. Honestly she was a brilliant character to me and I love her and would have loved her if she had been younger too."
buffy,2ywyjj,tclovescheese,3,Fri Mar 13 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"I love this response and that you can relate to a character on such a personal level. For me, Dawn is a fascinating character on the show, but also just as interesting outside of it, where you see people post intellectually lazy comments about Dawn as a one dimensional and bratty character. There's obviously a lot more to her than that, and it's sad that people aren't willing to rethink how much she changed the dynamic of the show, and Buffy herself."
buffy,2ywyjj,choketheboys,3,Fri Mar 13 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"She really did change the show a lot, which is something I love about it. And yea Dawn was bratty, but everyone has their bratty moments and she is literally just a young teenager who has probably gone through a lot.  For the viewers she wasn't with Buffy until season 5. But for Dawn she was there as Buffy was called and kicked out of school, she was there through moving and the divorce with Hank and Buffy getting locked in a psych ward, she was there throughout everything from the birth she thought she had had up past season 5 and there is so much she probably wen through that we never got to see on screen.  Honestly I could talk about Dawn all day lol, she became my favorite character on the show once introduced and it was my older sister who showed me the show. Dawn is one of the most realistic characters on the show, and that seems to be what a lot of people have issues with deep down. She is an awesome character. :D"
buffy,2ywyjj,MC_Carty,3,Fri Mar 13 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"Initially, I didn't care for Dawn, but in subsequent watchings, everything Trachtenberg does makes sense.  Now, if we were able to get her to portray Nona Mecklenberg, the character she played in Pete and Pete, I would've much preferred that.  It probably wouldn't make sense in the Buffyverse, though."
buffy,2ywyjj,DaddyCatALSO,3,Fri Mar 13 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Dawn. I understand how people can find her annoying, but I don't understand how some people just aren't empathetic at all towards her.  If they'd cast a young kid, I think Dawn's behavior and actions would have been a lot easier to swallow.  Also, it's pretty obvious in early season 5 that the writers were planning for a much younger character. What I find baffling is that they didn't seem accommodate Michelle's casting very well until, like, season 7, when Dawn becomes much more mature and useful."

buffy,2yr7d2,thelewis564,9,Thu Mar 12 06:36:10 2015 UTC,Buffy vs Xena would be good I think. Lucy Lawless sings and had a good sense of humour so she'd be good to reprise her role as Xena.

buffy,2yr7d2,rememberthealom,4,Fri Mar 13 01:49:51 2015 UTC,Sure thing. After we released our December battle we were brainstorming around what the next one would be. We knew that Cinderella was probably up next and right around that time Sarah tweeted our first rap battle (Snow White vs. Elsa). Light bulb moment. Our people got in touch with of her people and she jumped on board.

buffy,2yt5bn,DeadNotSleepingWI,3,Thu Mar 12 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"I am not going to hold my breath for that. I don't think Fox is going to give up the control over this for that yet. I believe that it might take a long time before a Whedon approved remaster appears.   Wish that Fox had gone the route of HBO, and worked with Whedon and others (HBO collaborated with The Wire creator David Simon on the technical process in the remastering his show). Until then I'm going to need to settle for the current DVD release if I really want to own it."

I do my research. :) I did almost buy the collected volume(s) of Season 8 prior to finishing my first run of Buffy. I realized something was missing plot wise in Buffy during the final episodes when Angel reappeared to give that necklace."
buffy,2yt5bn,Sammyboy616,3,Fri Mar 13 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"The contract for Buffy got renewed, so it should be okay on Netflix awhile longer.

Basically, the vampire needs to drink the blood of their victim until said victim is near death, and then the victim has to drink the vampire's blood. The victim then dies and later rises as a vampire. If the vampire drains all of the victim's blood, the victim simply dies and does not rise again. If the victim drinks the vampire's blood while not at the edge of death nothing happens and they go on being regular living human beings."

Even knowing the Joss quote that the cheese man doesn't mean anything, I've always thought that he was Willie Loman (from Death of a Salesman) and that the cheese has something to do with the meaning of cheese in the play DoaS.  My understanding of Willie and cheese in DoaS is that cheese serves as one of the many symbols that Willie is out of touch with contemporary life -- he's an anachronism.  I can't remember the play that well since it's been over a decade since I last read it, but I think that Willie likes to eat cheese in the evening, and, one night, his wife offers him Cheese Whiz, which has just been invented, but he doesn't like it or understand it.  I'm not sure how that relates to Buffy, but the cheese guy is the right age to be Willie Loman and they're performing (a weird dream version of) DoaS in the episode, so I think there's something there."

To reveal them would bring Chaos down upon the living earth.  Giles: The beast must be fought. Our only hope lies in finding  its weakness.  Spirit Guide: Seek not. Disturb us no longer.

I figured I would try to actually combine the pictures into a single one.  For anyone who doesn't know magic, the flavor on Angel's card is pretty good. Basically, the line about ""threshold"" at the bottom means ""when enough stuff goes into your own graveyard - angel becomes a white creature (instead of black) and can kill other black creatures"". So this card starts as Angelus and then becomes the more powerful card Angel."

Somebody in design changed it to blonde, and the artist obviously does not have any input about the actual card design from a game play point of view.

Little Ms. Muffet counting down from 7-3-0.  BUFFY: Great. Riddles.   Little Miss Muffet is a reference to Dawn and the episode was 730 days until The Gift. In the episode Real Me Dawn refers to herself as ""curds and whey"" to further connect  In the scene you mentioned the clock's time is 7:30 another reference to the time until Buffy sacrifices herself for Dawn  Restless (in Buffy's bedroom again but with Tara not faith):    BUFFY: Faith and I just made that bed.

buffy,2ym0qf,hatramroany,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"In the episode Real Me Dawn refers to herself as ""curds and whey"" to further connect   Not exactly. When Buffy pulls her out of the magic shop where Mr. Bogarty lies dead (Mr. Bogarty's name is also a call-back, according to David Fury, to the other dead magic shop owner from ""Passion,"" who was described as running ""the local boogedy boogedy store""), she is accosted by a lunatic, who has this conversation with her:   Lunatic: Hey! What are you doing?  Dawn: Wha-?  Lunatic: What are you doing here? Can't loiter. No loitering ... That's why I'm a cat ... Quiet ... cat's in the cupboard, but they find you anyway ... and it hurts (Remembering some agony) Please make it stop! (He pulls at his hair, whimpering, then slaps himself) Shut up! SHUT UP! They'll hear you!  Dawn: (Shouting) BUF-uhh!  Lunatic: Shhhh! I know you ... curds and whey ... I know what you are ... you don't belong here.   David Fury has said specifically that ""curds and whey"" was meant to tie into the ""little Miss Muffet"" line from season 3. This entire scene is the first time the show addresses the fact that Dawn is something new, that Buffy didn't really have a sister until now.  There's been so much attention payed to ""little Miss Muffet"" (Glory also rambles about someone ""sitting on her tuffet""). I also see the ""cat"" line as (probably) referencing the third season Faith dream. In the section you quoted, the ""Who's going to look after him? / It's a she"" lines are talking about a cat.   There's actually a lot of cat imagery in this show. :) Miss Kitty Fantastico has a role not only in Willow and Tara's lives, but also in ""Restless."" Buffy's spirit guide in ""Intervention"" is a mountain lion (""hello kitty""). And in Angel, Gunn sees a panther in the White Room."

buffy,2yiume,Dog-boy,4,Tue Mar 10 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"Buffy started when I was 37. I watched episodes here and there but as a Mom of young kids I could never watch it consistently. When Dawn showed up out of nowhere (in my view) I quit watching it. And later when my son tried to persuade me to watch Firefly and used the fact that it was by Joss Whedon to persuade me, I passed on it because...Dawn.   I am so grateful that my daughter got me watching it again when she was in high school. And the awesomeness that is Joss became clear and lead to Firefly and Dr. Horrible and Cabin in the Woods and Much Ado and...  My daughter is calling from university in a little while so we can watch an episode of Buffy together. It's a great day."
buffy,2yiume,AngryWizard,2,Wed Mar 11 02:30:19 2015 UTC,I found Buffy right when I needed it most. I was the most depressed that I'd ever been in my life and wanted it all to end. The universe threw the perfect episode with the perfect characters and subject matter at me (my 1st episode was The Body) at 2am while flipping channels; if it had been a 'silly' episode I think I would have skimmed right past it. So it's like it all came together perfectly exactly when I needed it. I still remember saying 'Hey that's the girl from American Pie' and setting down the remote. Now look at me!!
buffy,2yiume,Dog-boy,3,Wed Mar 11 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"The Body, to me, is one of the best pieces of television ever made. It is such a realistic portryal of what having someone you love die is like. The lack of music makes it so real."

buffy,2ykync,therealmgo,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"Question: How much of the foreshadowing in Restless was intentional?  According to the wiki, there is some really insane foreshadowing in there for odd things, and I've noticed some myself that shouldn't have been able to be foreshadowed.. specifically Willow writing on Tara's skin in blank ink, much like the ink that would dye Willow's hair after Tara's death. I don't think they'd decided to make Willow a bad guy at that point, so it makes me wonder if some of the other stuff I've seen pointed out might just be coincidence.  Like wasn't Anya supposed to die in Season 5?  She didn't get back in the vengeance biz until Season 6,  but there is that one line in Restless about her becoming a demon again which seems like really obvious foreshadowing, at least in retrospect."
buffy,2ykync,CJGibson,2,Tue Mar 10 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Joss and co. only purposely foreshadowed Dawn's arrival. The rest of the stuff they just went back to the episode and pulled stuff out, I'd assume. But I don't think anyone working on Buffy at that time has ever actually answered that. The only thing that was for sure on purpose from that episode was the ""Tabula Rasa"", there was an interview with Joss where he said the Loan Shark dialogue and the Giles/Spike relationship was something he'd want to do again.

buffy,2yl9fc,therealmgo,7,Tue Mar 10 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"I like that they didn't really defeat the First.  It wouldn't have made any sense, being that it is Evil.  It can't be killed, only fought, which is ultimately what they'd been doing throughout the show.   Only now Buffy has empowered all these other young women (literally on the show, but figuratively in real life) to fight some of those battles on their own and with each other by teaching them the lessons she's learned over the past 7 years.  I thought it was a really beautiful goodbye for the show.  Plus Soulful Spike tugged at my heartstrings all season.  <3  Edit: Come to think of it, I'd say Glory was really the larger than life Big Bad.  The First was more of a metaphor made literal."
buffy,2yl9fc,KiraKira_,3,Tue Mar 10 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"I really liked the first half of season 7. I love ""Him,"" and ""Selfless."" Gnarl and the Turak Han are frightening as is evil Spike.  ""Conversations with dead people"" is an amazing episode both for character and arc development. And I love seeing more of Spike's backstory including the pretty Early One Morning song. And amazingly, Dawn stops being painfully annoying.    The potentials are the worst. Giles acts too much like the watchers institution instead of like a father figure. The speechifying gets so old, so fast. Who is this random order of really old women who watch? I did not sign up to watch a war movie about battles and soldier training. Ugh. And Andrew should have died, not Anya. Clearly Joss just goes for the pain, every time."
buffy,2yl9fc,purplenat,2,Wed Mar 11 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"And Andrew should have died, not Anya. Clearly Joss just goes for the pain, every time.   Actually, Emma Caulfield (Anya) requested for her character to die in the final episode, so that's not all on Joss. Now, the way it was done, of course, was Joss."
buffy,2yl9fc,clockworklycanthrope,5,Wed Mar 11 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"It's weird how time changes your perception of things. I remember the first time I watched S7, I thought it was perfect and so dark and suspenseful, especially the First. Now, many rewatches later, I can see a lot of flaws in the season that I was completely oblivious to before (although I do still love certain moments and episodes - Conversations with Dead People is pretty high up on my list of favourites).  I think the First was a great idea, but awkwardly executed. Its reveal with Spike in the basement, cycling through all the show's past Big Bads, was brilliant, and its presence in Conversations with Dead People was also genuinely chilling and sinister. But the more the First talked and inserted itself into the show, the less frightening I found it, until eventually it just seemed like kind of an empty threat. I feel like if we hadn't seen it quite as much as we did, it might've been more effective.  I agree with you that the potentials were annoying. I would've much preferred a final season that focused exclusively on Buffy and the Scoobies - instead, we were handed this brand-new gaggle of random girls we'd never met before and expected to care about them. I get that it was supposed to tie into the whole girl power, passing the torch to the next generation thing, but I still could've done without it.   Didn't hate Kennedy as much as others apparently did, but would have liked it better if we'd seen Willow grieving, healing, and then coming into her own alone, without a pushy new girlfriend being shoehorned in just for the sake of romantic drama. I think it's true that the fans probably would've hated any new love interest after Tara, but why did there need to be a love interest at all? Willow is such a strong character and it would've been cool to see her realize she doesn't need anyone else in order to be complete.  With that said, I do love the way the show ended, in general, and Buffy's ""So here's the part where you make a choice"" speech still gives me full-body chills no matter how many times I watch it. I also think her smile at the very end is perfect."
buffy,2yl9fc,Mollywobbles222,3,Wed Mar 11 08:45:07 2015 UTC,"Like about Season 7: The First. I actually like that big bad and I agree with /u/KiraKira_ about how it would have been silly to ""beat"" evil and I liked that it instead reinforced the idea of constantly fighting to keep evil in check. Also, I loved the Willow library conversation in Conversations with Dead People. Andrew makes me laugh too.  Dislikes: Way too much deus ex machina. IMO the Slayer Scythe and the amulet were bullshit plot devices. Also, this extends into the previous season a bit too but I think that Xander and Anya (particularly Anya) got way off track after Hells Bells. Xander more went off the rails back in Season 4 and never quite got good storylines again, but Anya is the one who suffers in Season 7."
buffy,2yl9fc,heymeowmeow,2,Tue Mar 10 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"I loved Buffy's therapy session in Conversations, too, especially her revelation about her superiority/inferiority complex and bit about feeling like she's beneath her friends.  I like how it ties in with the whole ""from beneath you"" thing, which ties in with the earthy theme in Season 6.  Plus (I like to think) a neato callback to Fool for Love, maybe driving home that she doesn't look down on Spike anymore."
buffy,2yl9fc,KiraKira_,2,Wed Mar 11 01:00:02 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. I love that whole episode! Cassie and Willow are my favorite followed by Buffy and Holden and then the rest are all about equivalent to me.
buffy,2yl9fc,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Mar 11 01:23:13 2015 UTC,"the Willow library conversation   My favorite part about this conversation is how emotional Willow gets, and how the First seems to be so unable to relate. It seems just to coldly and dispassionately try to figure out what to say next to manipulate her, and Willow is so overwhelmed by the idea that Tara is there that she doesn't even notice:   Willow: But-but she's talking to you? And she can hear me? (starts to cry, looks up) Tara? Tara, I miss you. I miss you so much. (To Cassie) Can she hear me? What's happening? Did she say anything? What? Did she go away?  Cassie: She's crying.   The First seems to be looking at Willow with an alien incomprehension, and you can almost see it thinking, huh, what should I say next ... she's crying, sure, that sounds good. Let's milk this for a while, say the words that should work, and then move on to what Willow can do about it.   Willow: No. No, don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me.  Cassie: She misses you. She wishes she could touch you.  Willow: Me too. Oh, me too. Oh God, Tara, it hurts so much. Everyday, it's like this giant hole, and it's not getting any better.  Cassie: But it will. It can."
buffy,2yl9fc,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Mar 13 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"Andrew annoys the living hell out of me. I can't believe that they couldn't do better than this cringing murderer for comic relief. Like, ha ha, he tormented Buffy for a season, laughed along with sexual assault plans on more than one occasion, and killed his only friend, but now he's endearingly funny! Apart from Andrew, Season 7 took itself too seriously. I know people love Spike speechifying, but my Lord, season 2 Spike would have heckled himself to death rather than finish some of those monologues. The total absence of reason surrounding the Potentials...like, how do they eat? Do they get medical treatment ever? Who's paying for all this? The big bad's superpower is talking people to death. They made an entire season about a Big Bad whose sole superpower is talking people to death. The shapeshifting was very stylish, don't get me wrong, great to see some of those actors come back, but...talking to death.   Wow, I didn't realize how much I disliked Season 7 until now."
buffy,2yl9fc,bright_ephemera,2,Tue Mar 10 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"I wish they just hadn't had the Trio and instead had Warren by himself, or perhaps had Jonathan and Andrew realize what they were doing early on. Maybe they could have left after Life Serial but before the gross sex-slave episode. I liked Jonathan in the beginning when he was misguided but not evil and I like Andrew's presence in Season 7 except for his murdering Jonathan and the awful history in Season 6 so I wish there wouldn't be that bad taste in my mouth around them. On a similar note, Angel The Show Spoilers!"
buffy,2yl9fc,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Mar 11 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed season 7 more than 6, but it wasn't a well constructed season on the whole. The first was a difficult concept to properly illustrate and while I get why they can't permanently stop evil, I'm not sure it was the most satisfying storyline to have a big bad that can't be beat.  And the introduction of the potentials was problematic. Too many to give any real focus over to any of them (they were mostly reduced to a bunch of stereotypes) but not enough so that it didn't really matter. It made the whole season seem very rushed and I felt like most of the characters didn't get the screentime I wanted for them, except for the Buffy-Spike relationship which really dominated the season (or maybe I'm just extra sensitive to it because I really didn't like it).  I'll always defend season 4. Adam was terrible, don't get me wrong, but the season had the best character development, Tara was introduced and we got to know Anya a lot better. I liked the concept of The Initiative, I always thought the show needed to really address how the authorities handle vampires, demons etc (beyond the PCP cover up of course). It's a shame that half of the story had to lead directly to Adam."

buffy,2ygsfv,toocutetopuke,7,Mon Mar 9 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"Magic the Gathering(MtG) is a Collectible Card Game where you cast spells and summon creatures from a deck of cards to destroy your opponent.  MtG has many formats of play including contsructed (make decks at home) and draft (there is a pool of cards available where you are playing that you select from and make your deck out of).  A Magic Draft Cube is a specific format of draft play in MtG where someone creates and controls how the drafting process happens. It is sometimes accompanied by custom boxes / carrying cases that make the cube itself a bit of a spectacle.  Edit: bonus explanation I skipped over! Magic has many ""blocks"" of cards to draw from, and this cube draws entirely from the Innistrad block, which has Gothic Horror as its main thematic element, so the cards themselves fit right in to the cube subject matter. It would be quite possible to draft a Vampire-themed deck... and also possible to draft an anti-vampire deck."

buffy,2ygsfv,Mollywobbles222,2,Tue Mar 10 09:00:54 2015 UTC,"That is more a reference to classic horror movies where the hero was often shown driving a stake into the vampire's heart using a mallet. They would find the vampire sleeping in their coffin and kill them that way.  I've never thought about it before, but Buffy did away with that horror trope and instead used the stake itself as a stabbing weapon.  Image for reference!"
buffy,2yikrd,WispGB,5,Tue Mar 10 02:29:00 2015 UTC,You may want to check the FAQ for discussion on this! Lots of people in this neck of the woods get frustrated just like you at the Council's stupidity on this issue! :)
buffy,2yikrd,strawberryf1elds,4,Tue Mar 10 02:45:31 2015 UTC,The Watchers Council never gave the Slayer a direct salary because that would make her too independent. It was expected that the Slayer would be taken care of by her Watcher and then die too young for them to need money for anything big. Unlike most slayers Buffy was supported by her mother so there was no need for Giles to take care of her. In season five a iffy didn't ask for money because she refused to be dependent on this group of controlling men. If she went on a rant about her having the power and then asked for money for herself it would put them in the position of power again. My question is where does the Watchers Council get its money?
buffy,2yikrd,The_Ripper42,4,Tue Mar 10 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's just like when Anya (I believe) suggests that Buffy start charging people money after she saves them. I think she always just thought that it would be in bad taste. And she damn sure never wanted to have to depend on the Council for anything, or feel that she owed them anything. If anything she wanted them involved in her personal affairs as little as possible."
buffy,2yikrd,bloody_william,3,Tue Mar 10 04:56:28 2015 UTC,I love how this contrasts with Angel where they need to charge people to stay afloat.
buffy,2yikrd,The_Ripper42,6,Tue Mar 10 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"This is directly addressed in our FAQ, which includes a variety of links to the many conversations we have already had on this topic. Please check it out for answers to this question and others that are frequently discussed and have been thoroughly answered."
buffy,2yikrd,KiraKira_,3,Tue Mar 10 05:28:47 2015 UTC,"Also, how did Giles maintain rent, utilities, and  assorted costs of living (including replacing all the shit that got broken) in a huge, beautiful apartment while being unemployed for well over a year?  Why on earth does Buffy think she can maintain a house that costs a few hundred grand while working for minimum wage, probably part time?  CoL is low in Sunnydale, but surely not that low.  For that matter, how did Joyce do it while being a single mom of two?  How do Willow and Tara always have such beautiful clothes and makeup when they're just unemployed college students?  How does Anya survive for those two-ish years before she starts working at the Magic Box?  Finances on BTVS seem to be just as magical as the rest of the Buffyverse."
buffy,2yikrd,The_Ripper42,3,Tue Mar 10 02:53:15 2015 UTC,"Giles would likely have savings from having a steady job with the council his whole life, Buffy was preoccupied with many other things so she might have just never thought of moving somewhere cheaper, plus I can imagine she was attached to the house her mother lived and died in. Maybe Buffy's dad contributed financially and we just never saw it because the show is from Buffy's POV. Obvi magic for the Willow and Tara stuff. I'm sure Anya could find a few suckers to manipulate or maybe she mooches off of her old demon buddies and just lies about D'Hoffryn giving her time off for being so good at evilness. But probably just weird Hellmouth logic that nobody in the show notices."
buffy,2yikrd,KiraKira_,7,Tue Mar 10 03:41:54 2015 UTC,"she mooches off of her old demon buddies and just lies about D'Hoffryn giving her time off for being so good at evilness.   I love this theory!  It seems like something that should have been mentioned in Season 4, but it's absolutely hilarious to imagine her still pretending to be a demon and trying to convince her friends... For my own amusement, I'm going to imagine she was crashing on Clem's couch."
buffy,2yikrd,faaackksake,3,Tue Mar 10 04:01:35 2015 UTC,just to add to this it is mentioned at one point that joyces life insurance covered all the costs between buffy being dead and ressurected.

buffy,2yfw40,poor_yorick,50,Mon Mar 9 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Superstar isn't that bad of an episode. It has Jonathan, the world without shrimp, Jonathan, Spike calling Buffy ""Betty"", Jonathan, Xander speaking Latin in front of the books, and Jonathan."
buffy,2yfw40,bwburke94,15,Mon Mar 9 14:22:51 2015 UTC,I love that episode!  I think it's a hilarious and fun cutaway.
buffy,2yfw40,YouJellyFish,5,Mon Mar 9 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"Superstar, to me, is the predecessor of Storyteller. Both are very important episodes overall, although Storyteller is better made. The show was more mature, obviously, at that point, which made tackling that whole problem of escapism easier.  Superstar, compared to that, feels too silly, but is still pretty good. It's the complete opposite of Beer Bad, which was hilarious and entertaining, while being very empty. Superstar is deeper, but kind of annoying."
buffy,2yfw40,sleepyfloyd,8,Mon Mar 9 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, I kind of see why you would compare ""Superstar"" to ""Storyteller."" They're both about people trying to make a niche for themselves that is the wrong one. And they're both written by Jane Espenson.  But I find ""Storyteller"" in tone and theme (and quality) to be a little closer to ""The Zeppo."" Not only does it follow a relatively minor character (who is, however, part of the group), but it pokes fun at a lot of the show, including Buffy's season 7 speechifying. It's lighthearted and has a lot of genuinely funny moments (the slow-motion glamor shots, ""we are as gods""), and many serious sequences are seen from Andrew's idiosyncratic perspective (him rewinding the tape of Anya and Xander's conversation and casting himself as Anya, the different versions of Jonathan's death that he imagines).   Both ""The Zeppo"" and ""Storyteller"" deal with issues of identity and how to be a hero. How to take responsibility, not by telling stories or jokes and comparing yourself to Jimmy Olsen to everyone else's Clark Kent and Lois Lane, but how to act when you're the one who needs to save the day. And what that means. And how you need to be different, and how it doesn't matter how you present yourself or what people think of you, but what you do and what you are.  ""Superstar"" is fun, but it's just another spell. I see it as similar more to ""Something Blue."" Doing a spell to make the pain go away is not the answer :) Everyone gets to be different for a day, and that's always amusing, but ""Storyteller"" and ""The Zeppo"" deal with the world as it is. And how people who don't quite fit, who see themselves as ""the guy who is recording everything for posterity"" or ""the guy who gets doughnuts"" (the ""guestage"" and the ""Zeppo"") have to break out of that role when the circumstances call for it. To be the hero. Or to truly atone."
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 9 23:32:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think identify is the central theme in both Superstar and Storyteller. In Zeppo it is, obviously, but the big difference is that Xander wants to change himself, while Jonathan and Andrew try to change the world around them. It's escapism, wishing yourself away to a world where you are the hero and everybody loves you. Superstar does it via magic, which is kinda lame, while Storysteller has this great theme of creating your own little world by narrating things away that don't fit, that you don't like.  Another big difference is that in Zeppo, Xander himself figured things out. He was the hero of his own little story while the others saved the world. But he did it, and nobody else. In both Superstar and Storyteller, Jonathan and Andrew need a kick in the butt from Buffy to face reality. Without her, Andrew would still be creating his own little worlds, narrating the harsh reality away.   Storyteller is a way more daring episode than Superstar because it's more consequent in the way it breaks the fourth wall. While Superstar makes fun of Mary Sues and their bad fanfiction, Storyteller aims way higher. Everybody uses the power of narration to deal with the world. It's a fine line when this becomes unhealthy denial of reality. I could never see myself in Jonathan, but I can definitely see myself in Andrew. Storyteller has been, in this regard, perhaps the most powerful Aesop of the series for me. The show nodding to its fans and telling them that bad fanfiction is bad is one thing. To tell them that, hey, the narrative structures of Buffy are no replacement for reality and you shouldn't think in tropes and stereotypes... that's something pretty cool for a show as immersive as Buffy."

A lot of people badmouth it because of Riley/the initiative/Adam - which to be fair are all pretty lame - but they're only a small part of the season. It also had some of the best episodes of the series, like:  Fear Itself  Something Blue  Hush  A New Man  This Year's Girl  Who Are You?"
buffy,2yfw40,JangoF76,11,Mon Mar 9 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think season 4 has a lot of good individual episodes (Hush and Something Blue are two of my favourite of the entire series), but the overall storyline is a bit meh. I actually don't have a problem with Riley in season 4, I just feel like they did that thing where they rewrite a character to make you like them less right before they leave the show. I feel like I see that a lot where someone in the main cast (of any show) is dating someone outside the main cast."
buffy,2yfw40,deadange1,8,Mon Mar 9 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"Riley, Adam, and the Initiative don't quite work, which is rough because they're the backbone of the season (though I love the other stuff in S4 like the aformentioned stand-out episodes). But on my most recent rewatch, I found those aspects a lot more palatable if I looked at them as what they likely were: rough drafts/first attempts at writing challenging things like 'Cabin in the Woods,' old school heroes like Steve Rogers, villains like Ultron, etc. without quite having the resources to pull them off.  By kind of... looking through what's there to appreciate what they were trying to achieve, I had a much better time.  It's amazing how much better Riley functions when you imagine someone like Chris Evans reading those lines.  That kind of stuff is tough to pull off, so I can appreciate the aim even if the result falls short."

Personally I think it's hilarious. I also like Doublemeat Palace and Ted.  I find Beer Bad boring more than anything else."
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,7,Mon Mar 9 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if you don't like it, explain it to me ... Personally, I think it's hilarious   I'll try :) It's kind of hard to explain, because I actually do think a lot of the dialogue and scenes are well-written. And funny. I like the scenes between Buffy and Spike and Buffy and Anya especially.  But there's something that bothers me about this episode. Somehow it just doesn't all come together for me. I think it has something to do with the fact that I've never particularly liked Jonathan or been compelled by his character arc. I'm also annoyed with episodes where spells sort of wear off on their own, or people suddenly decide things they could have decided a while ago. I don't like ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" partly for this reason. And Buffy suddenly deciding or realizing she can push Spike around again, or just take initiative in general, is a little strange, as is Jonathan suddenly deciding that he's (probably) on Buffy's side.  I like a lot of things about this episode - I like how everyone is who Jonathan imagines they are (so Willow and Tara are together but have a joint kind of celebrity crush on Jonathan), and Giles and Xander are more in charge and Buffy, though ""the Slayer,"" is pretty subservient. But I find the plot kind of weird.   I guess overall I think of it as a sometimes amusing diversion that comes right after a really good episode, but for the most part it's not one I want to see.  But, you know ... out of 144 episodes I'd be shocked if there weren't a few that I didn't much care for :)"
buffy,2yfw40,averagebitca,7,Mon Mar 9 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I really like Jonathan, which is probably why I like the episode. You could make the argument that the reason Buffy realized that she could take initiative when she did, is because the spell was created at that point, and all of the memories before were fictitious, meaning that Buffy had no opportunity to be active up until the point where the spell was created. But you're right it is kind of a plothole. I've just never been the kind of person who really cares about plotholes."
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 9 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :)  I really want to love all of Jane Espenson's episodes, because I like the way she writes dialogue a lot. But I have come to realize that we disagree on a couple of fundamental things, like whether or not Jonathan should be in as many episodes as possible and whether her plots sufficiently make sense :D  I love ""Storyteller,"" ""Band Candy,"" ""Intervention,"" ""Harsh Light of Day,"" and many others. But a lot of her episodes bother me to varying degrees and, you know, I think it's largely because of the plots. ""Earshot"" has some great lines and a very moving speech. But the fact that it was all just a massive coincidence that Jonathan had been attempting to commit suicide in a tower with a rifle on the same day that the real culprit (who they discovered completely by accident) was planning to poison everyone bugs the hell out of me. I think Jane Espenson talked proudly about how this was one moment where Buffy solved a problem without violence, and that's great and all, except it was completely tangential to the ""real"" plot of the episode. The actual problem was still solved with violence, so ... Go Team :)  I think the mislead with the rifle was ridiculously overdone, and I think the mislead with the shiny coin in ""The Replacement"" was pretty overdone, too. And that is another episode I think is both interesting and sometimes really hilarious (like Toth with the cauldron or talking to Giles). 80% of the plot is centered around a fake-out, and that gets annoying. To me. :)  Sorry, apparently this turned into a rant :P I do really like her episodes, or many parts of her episodes, in general. I just wish they were a little bit better, if you see what I'm saying."

buffy,2yfw40,ruaidhri,15,Mon Mar 9 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think ""Anne"" is really underrated. Maybe because the stakes are so high it seems campy: a demon or race of demons has created a literal hell to work humans to death in, all in the space of one non-hell day.  But the homeless teenager commentary, while at times heavy handed (montage, anyone?) is touching; Chanterelle/Lily is on point as a sweet, slightly manipulative, clingy homeless teen (who we last saw as a vampire worshipper); the demon-slash-teen outreach counselor is appropriately double-talking and evil; and the city itself is well-drawn.   Lily: She points out that trouble seems to follow Buffy and it's like a punch in the gut. When she goes to the demon underworld she tells Buffy she knew she'd always end up there, in hell. More wrenchingness. You just know she had a terrible, abusive, neglectful childhood and it hurts. At the same time it's made her needy and manipulative and you want to avoid her. Really realistic. Demon dude: So his name's Ken. He's appropriately smarmy and slightly creepy as the do-gooder who wants to save the homeless kids of the city. It's also exactly the appropriate attitude for a demon who kidnaps homeless kids and works them to death in hell mines below the city. Which is interesting to notice. It's also pretty funny when he whines that they're not supposed to fight back. And when he whines that Buffy ripped off his face mask. He whines a lot. Which is funny. But anyway, his character personifies everyone's fears about the overly friendly helpful quasi-religious types ""saving"" homeless kids or any other vulnerable population. The city: It itself represents despair, just as Ken and Lily also do. The entire episode is a reflection and projection of Buffy's mental state and insecurities. The episode is full of little indignities like the diner customers who sexually harass Buffy, whose asses she can't kick cause she's not supposed to be strong. Which also reminds us of how waitstaff in general can't kick sexually harassing customers' asses because they need the job, they need the tips, etc.   It's all pretty brilliant."

buffy,2yfw40,ultrahedgehog,3,Tue Mar 10 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"I also dig a lot of the ""Monster of the week"" episodes as well. I think mostly it is because a lot of the series gets so dark that having a nice and cheesy filler can be very refreshing. I also really enjoy how it is usually a good setting for the characters to interact in a 'safe space' with no major plot points - just the Scoobies being Scoobies.   P.S I actually really like Go Fish for some weird reason. And I always get an unintentional laugh out of the ""Dude, what is that foulness?"" line."

It's probably not any worse than all the other episodes I like :)  The placement of it is kind of strange, though - right between ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and ""Becoming, Part 1."" It's an odd place for such a filler-type episode.  Also, Buffy needing to be rescued by Xander seemed a little off to me."
buffy,2yfw40,ultrahedgehog,5,Mon Mar 9 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points except the last. Sure, Buffy is usually the savior, but the show really emphasizes that her strong friendships make her different from/more resilient than most of the past Slayers. It would be hard to drive this point home if her friends(even the ones without superpowers) didn't get her out of some binds."

If Xander could take him out, why couldn't Buffy? It always struck me as bizarre, like they were making the Slayer weaker just so Xander could have his moment. Especially since the guy was human. There are other ways to make Xander a hero than by making Buffy incompetent."
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Mar 10 13:17:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, I suppose that makes more sense, I didn't remember the specifics of it. I guess Xander had the element of surprise? But yeah, maybe a bit of an inconsistency there."
buffy,2yfw40,RichterSkala,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"I laughed out loud just READING that line--I'm with you!! A lot of little one-liners like that tickle me more than they probably should. xD   I liked Go Fish also, I think a lot of people hate it purely because of its placement between big episodes. Aside from the weird Nazi/rapey stuff at the end (which is uncomfortably common in the show to begin with), it's mostly entertaining!"
buffy,2yfw40,Ashton42,2,Tue Mar 10 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"weird Nazi-rapey stuff at the end   Soviet, actually :) And to be precise, the ""rapey stuff"" was not really related to the athletic ""doping"" that was going on, except that both were ideas the coach thought were good for ""his boys.""   I think it was more tied to the idea that ""high school jocks get whatever they want,"" as they're idolized by both school administration and high school girls. So, taken to extremes ... thinking it's OK to turn student athletes into monsters to win a championship, and wanting to provide them with sexual ""perks."""
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Mar 11 09:05:27 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the plot idea of ""I, Robot...You, Jane"". It's really playing with the rules of the demon-fantasy world and modern technology"
buffy,2yfw40,stillnotking,2,Mon Mar 9 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"Rationale for the painful upvote. You answered the question, you reasoned why, YOU like those episodes...but daaaaaaang gurl. :p  Although, i like Him just fine...anya robbing a bank, willow gonna him him into a her, andd spike tackling a rocket launcher wielding buffy."
buffy,2yfw40,latrodectusmactans,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:04:30 2015 UTC,":) I think a lot of it has to do with what you find humorous and/or what you can relate to.  ""Beer Bad,"" ""The Freshman,"" ""Living Conditions,"" and ""Doublemeat Palace"" might be funnier if you've either worked a crappy job or had a college experience like Buffy's. Then again, maybe I just have an idiosyncratic sense of humor :P  I think ""Ted"" is fairly chilling; I like Ted himself, and I love all of Buffy's scenes with her mom and the interactions with the police (and Buffy saying ""I'm sorry"" makes my heart ache for her). I also really like all of her mom's scenes in ""Gingerbread,"" plus a lot of the dialogue. And I've always loved Snyder's line:   This is a glorious day for principals everywhere. No pathetic whining about ""students' rights,"" just a long row of lockers and a man with a key.   ""Anne"" is an episode I used to find somewhat annoying, especially with the montage, but I like the scenes in Hell. And Buffy when she's answering ""what are you doing?"":   Breaking into your office and going through your private things. Candidate for what?"
buffy,2yfw40,Twerkle-Belle,10,Tue Mar 10 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"""Him"" -- It's a more slapstick take than the typical BtVS comic episode, but I still think it's funny. The scene with Buffy trying to blow up Principal Wood with a rocket launcher justifies the episode by itself.  ""I, Robot... You, Jane"" -- Yeah, it's cheesy as hell, but it's also one of the few S1 episodes with any secondary-character development. We get to see a bit of the real Willow beneath the shy, geeky facade."
buffy,2yfw40,monkeymosh88,4,Mon Mar 9 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"The rocket launcher thing was the only part I liked about the whole episode, but oh god I laughed so hard I had to pause it to stop laughing."

buffy,2yfw40,monkeymosh88,7,Mon Mar 9 21:32:48 2015 UTC,"I love all of the first season which mostly people seem to rate as one of the worst, I don't understand at all, I love how the show goes for more a horror vibe than the later ones and the soundtrack is incredible!"
buffy,2yfw40,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 9 16:34:15 2015 UTC,"I don't understand at all    horror vibe    soundtrack   Those would be two main reasons I don't like it as much :) I think the soundtrack got way better in season 2 with the addition of Christophe Beck, and horror has never been my thing."
buffy,2yfw40,MoonSpider,3,Tue Mar 10 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"By soundtrack I don't mean the score, but the songs used by actual bands, admittedly season 2 has some great ones aswell. I'm not a huge horror fine either, but in the first season they go a little bit further towards creating real fear and danger for the characters, somehow in the later seasons it ends up being more action/comedy still great, but different, I love the opening of the pilot when you see the couple sneak into the school, they play a great switcharoo where the Vampire turns out to the be the girl, the students then finding dead bodies. It was creepy. Like I said above, most people would agree with you and not rate the first season too highly, but I think it's great."
buffy,2yfw40,norrin__radd,2,Tue Mar 10 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"by soundtrack I don't mean the score, but the songs used by actual bands   Oh, I misunderstood :) Yeah, season 1 does use music that has kind of a different, more hardcore sound, which I kind of like too.   real fear and danger for the characters   I'd agree. Fighting vampires is portrayed as this ultra-dangerous activity, whereas by season 4, Buffy is going through her ""painstakingly thought-out puns"" phase. And even in ""Anne,"" Willow is trying it out too :) The whole show kind of has this evolution, of things becoming less scary as characters get stronger, to the point where they need to introduce new characters (like Dawn and Tara) to be put in danger all the time.  ""Helpless"" and ""Superstar"" were both attempts to return to the idea that these run-of-the-mill creatures of darkness were scary, each time by having Buffy be not herself.  So yeah, basically I agree :)"
buffy,2yfw40,NovemberBlue93,6,Wed Mar 11 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"I've got a big soft spot for ""I Robot, You Jane."" Yea, it's really cheesy, but dammit, cheese is delicious. And you have to be able to resist looking at it through current millenium glasses--of COURSE the tech stuff is dated and makes everything seem sillier, but that's irrelevant to the drama, stakes, and character interactions.  Willow's plight is really relatable, it's rendered pretty honestly, the intangible demon whose power is influence and seduction is an interesting concept, the fabricated suicide ploy is a sequence of genuine and effective horror, we get our first dose of sassy Jenny Calendar, Giles has his great speech about the way books smell, the scoobies end the episode on a real raw and somewhat subversive note about relationship perils in television, and Dammit, Buffy fights a giant robot with Devil horns. That shit is awesome."
buffy,2yfw40,fff8e7cosmic,4,Mon Mar 9 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the same age as the characters so I started college right before season 4 started. I missed the first few eps so Beer Bad ended up being my season premiere. Maybe it was finding something the reminded me of home, or maybe it was the alcohol still in my system from the previous weekend, but I always loved that ep"
buffy,2yfw40,CloudGirl,6,Mon Mar 9 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"Beer Bad is hilarious. It's a terrible storyline, way too preachy for my liking, but the episode just has too many funny moments to hate.   I don't love them, but Killed by Death, Go Fish, Teachers Pet, Reptile Boy, Bad Eggs, The Pack etc are all fun episodes. They contribute almost nothing towards character and plot development, but I really enjoy them as a break from the whatever apocalypse is looming at that point. They're just classic, easy viewing Buffy episodes."
buffy,2yfw40,mcgani,5,Mon Mar 9 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"I liked I Robot, You Jane because it showed more of Willow, and introduced Jenny. I have a soft spot for cyberculture.  And I've heard Band Candy get a bad rap in some circles, which is absolutely preposterous because of young!Giles."
buffy,2yfw40,belac889,2,Mon Mar 9 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"What?! Band Candy is hilarious. And also, yeah..  Young Giles. And Young Snyder. What's not to love?"
buffy,2yfw40,mcgani,4,Mon Mar 9 23:29:21 2015 UTC,"The thing about Buffy is, even the worst episodes have something great in them — character development, great quips, great guest stars, arc development, something.  We just watched ""Superstar"" and it was loads of fun. Frankly, ""Beer Bad"" is pretty darn bad, but it gets Buffy over her Parker-moping so that's good.   ""Ted"" — John Ritter. Miniature golf. You know who else liked miniature golf? That's right, Mayor Wilkins. ""Bad eggs"" — They taking care of eggs! Xander boils his! Plus...Gorches. Okay, the Gorches suck, but they're slightly amusing. ""I robot you Jane"" — It's really quite poignant how well it captures loneliness and trying to solve it through online means, and how vulnerable someone can be to another's online persona. Willow tugs at my heartstrings in this one. Plus, we have Giles' complete terror of computers and Jenny Calendar gets some nice quips in. They might make googly eyes a bit too. ""Some Assembly Required"" — This is the one where random high schooler has brought his football brother back from the dead Frankenstein-style and is building him a mate by killing high school girls and using their body parts. Gruesome even for Buffy. Terrible plot, too. The grieving mother who sits all day chain smoking and watching video of the dead brother's football games is really, really sad, and another example of how Buffy tells stories without saying a word — we immediately know why the younger brother feels so alone and so compelled to bring his brother back. There are lots of good quotes in this too. And Angel is jealous of Xander.  And Xander (unknowingly) disses Cordelia when she throws herself at him!   I'm doing a terrible job here, but hopefully you get the gist."
buffy,2yfw40,belac889,4,Mon Mar 9 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of people here, my vote is on Beer Bad & Superstar. Never really understood why they're so widely hated--they're not the deepest of episodes, but they're fun and give you a pleasant break from some of the more melodramatic material.   Personally, I'll take the campy episodes ala Season 1 over the ""want-to-rip-my-hair-out-in-rage"" episodes like Dead Man's Party & Empty Places."
buffy,2yfw40,aphoenix,3,Mon Mar 9 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"I love Teacher's Pet and I was so disappointed when the slayerettes spent an entire episode ripping it apart instead of appreciating the underrated classic that is the campy, terrible prosthetics, and cheesy plot of an episode."

Of these I'd have to say I don't really love any of them except As You Were which gets a bad rap because Riley comes back, but is actually a really good episode.  Other ones I don't hate are Reptile Boy (for the beginnings of great Cordelia moments) and Inca Mummy Girl (which isn't great but isn't terrible).  I have to admit that a handful of these I had to look up because they're completely unmemorable episodes (mostly the season 7 ones, but also All the Way and Shadow).  125 Empty Places 7.19 126 First Date 7.14 127 Ted 2.11 128 Wrecked 6.10 129 Shadow 5.08 130 Goodbye Iowa 4.14 131 All the Way 6.06 132 Listening to Fear 5.09 133 Dead Man's Party 3.02 134 As You Were 6.15 135 Reptile Boy 2.05 136 Some Assembly Required 2.02 137 Inca Mummy Girl 2.04 138 Go Fish 2.20 139 Beer Bad 4.05 140 Bad Eggs 2.12 141 Teacher's Pet 1.04 142 Where the Wild Things Are 4.18 143 I Robot...

I took that moment as basically showing us how Anya could come to that point by showing us just how truly crushed she was when Xander left her.  For me it is one of the two or three most powerful moments on the show, easily.  Cutting away from the song mid-climax to show Anya impaled?  I'm a big strong man in his mid-30s and I'm tearing up at that one. Every. Single. Time.  And besides, what can be wrong with a show harkening back to a previous episode to reveal a greater insight into a character's motivation?  That song also adds to our enjoyment of OMwF by further fleshing out the mustard and the coconuts making more real the fact that many of the characters sang and/or heard songs during Sweet's presence that we as viewers never got to hear.  Finally, I find the song to be musically superior to all the others, although many of the songs are excellent (hard to say that about the performances).  Anya is the strongest female singer of the bunch and definitely deserved a song to herself like Tara got, IMHO.  But of course, one of the delights of Buffy is how we can all find different things to like and dislike across the seasons.  Cheers.  Edit: Downvote?  Really? It's not a disagree button.

The first time I saw it I actually turned it off mid-episode (never done that before or after, not even for I Robot, You Jane) because I just couldn't tolerate the high volume of cheese.  It grew on me, though, once it wasn't so unexpected.  Definitely one of my favorites now, especially because of how much it sets up the rest of the season.  But I still can't watch it in front of anyone else."

The episodes I have to skip: I've actually never rewatched season three so I couldn't tell you which ones I'd skip there. I'll eventually do it. Wild at Heart. Just no. Pangs, Doomed. It ain't gonna be popular but Fool for Love. I'm just not a flashback person. Into the Woods. I actually really liked Riley in season four but started to hate him in season five so I didn't care about the drama between him and Buffy at this point in the show.  As You Were. Everything about this episode is wrong except for Willow (offering to hate Riley's new girlfriend for Buffy, ect). The last episode I usually watch in season six is Seeing Red because I am a masochist. I don't care for the Dark Willow stuff in the last few eps so I just skip them. Season 7: All of them.

I also don't think the end of season 4 is all that bad, but it makes me somewhat uncomfortable and I don't enjoy it that much, so I often do skip the entire last disc (""The Yoko Factor,"" ""Primeval,"" and ""Restless"").

On the other hand, I can rewatch The Body 'til the cows come home, even though it's such a heartbreaking episode, just because it's so incredibly well-written and brilliantly acted. It's definitely one of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.  If I'm rewatching S6, I always skip the Spike/Buffy ""attempted rape"" scene in Seeing Red, for a variety of reasons."

Had this show been on a major network with a big budget, it wouldn't have been able to do the things it did, even in the first season. Sometimes it was to the detriment of the special effects of the show, but also to the benefit of the show in that it already knew what it was the first time we see Darla.   If you want brilliant special effects and one dimensional characters, there are lots of other shows out there that serve that purpose, quite dullfully (not a word)."

buffy,2y99fi,tydestra,3,Sat Mar 7 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"The First Evil is an ancient power that most closely represents ""darkness"" or ""evil.""   It manipulates human emotion (like fear or jealousy or hatred) but is itself emotionless. It is equally likely to manipulate other, less stereotypically ""evil"" emotions (like the desire to be loved, the desire for justice, or the desire for recognition or success or peace). What matters is the effect: it seeks to turn people to murder each other, to betray others, to hurt others, or to give up. Or some other loftier, long-term, strategic goal, but I think its normal state of being is simply to bring about evil.  It plays on all forms of human weakness (not just fear). It allows Dawn to feel that she is ""rescuing"" her mother and plants a seed of doubt in her mind in regards to Buffy so that she will turn on her. It takes advantage of Willow's grief (as well as her self-doubt, self-hate, and desire to protect others) to try to manipulate her into suicide. It seeks to wound its victims to convince them to choose of their own free will to do evil or refrain from doing good. Because it cannot force anyone to do anything. It's a force; it has no actual physical presence. It can manifest in the form of dead things, and it has acolytes and servants, but its power is limited by human choice (or maybe it would be more accurate to say each soul's choice).   I think of the First (in its elemental form) as somewhat of the opposite of a conscience. It is the inherent darkness within people that encourages them to do the wrong thing, the selfish thing, the easier thing, the destructive thing, rather than that which is more difficult and mature and responsible and compassionate.  It cannot be eradicated. But it can be fought, and normally it is an inner fight that takes place within each person. In the third and seventh seasons of Buffy, there are manifestations of the First that externalize this struggle against evil, but I think the basic framework - the way it works - remains fairly constant.  Does that make sense? That is kind of how I have always seen the First."

buffy,2y92t4,queenie504,2,Sun Mar 8 15:52:16 2015 UTC,I love Willow but the way she acted in parts of season 6 and 7 made me dislike her at times. Not enough to knock her off my top 10 list but she doesn't crack top 5 because of it.
buffy,2y92t4,averagebitca,3,Mon Mar 9 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"This only for Buffy characters, because I haven't watched Angel nearly as many times as I've watched Buffy:   Buffy Willow Spike Giles  Tara Anya  Xander Faith Dawn (yes, I like her) Cordelia   People talk a lot about whether or not Buffy is truly ""feminist"", but I think the true sign of it's feminism, is the sheer amount of interesting, complicated female characters. In many other shows there are far more men than women, and those men are often given far more character development and arcs than the women. In Buffy that is clearly not the case."
buffy,2y92t4,cocainelady,2,Sun Mar 8 05:24:17 2015 UTC,YAY! Buffy #1 :)
buffy,2y92t4,queenie504,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:12:54 2015 UTC,I think that there are parts of Buffy that we could argue are not great when it comes to feminism - the lack of any major long term women of color characters is a big one. But I think for the most part it did a really great job writing complex women and showing that women can be strong in different ways (Tara and Fred being gentler characters but no less awesome). So I will always respect the show for that.

For example Xander. In his case, it's because I can't stand him in certain seasons (like end of season 1, throughout season 2, and sometimes in season 3) but absolutely adore and relate to him in other seasons (seasons four and five). Buffy is kind of a difficult one as well because I'm just never as into the title character as I am their sidekicks but there is something different about Buffy."

My top picks have a lot to do with how I felt about the potential of each character.  The more believable they were on screen, the more I could feel submersed in their history before they became who they were.  Giles for example started out as a one dimensional character who slowly revealed his ruthless Ripper side.  I also like the Bad Guy who strives to be more than just a monster as in the case with Spike and Angel.    I put Willow at number one because her overall arc really demonstrated the evolution of insignificance into feeling empowered but also losing control of yourself which I thought was fascinating personally."

I watched the series completely out of order myself - I started with the fifth and sixth seasons (so Buffy vs. Dracula was the first episode I ever saw in its entirety), then went back and watched two, three and four - maybe in that order? - then seven and then I eventually got around to watching the first season. I have no idea why I did it this way, it was a long time ago. I think I had originally tried to start at the beginning and watch the first season, but lost interest after a few episodes.   So I don't know if I'd recommend starting a newbie off with the first season. Maybe just Welcome to the Hellmouth and then skip ahead to Prophecy Girl and the start of S2?

buffy,2y6945,catdoctor,28,Fri Mar 6 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"Just pasting from another thread about Kennedy.    I've always thought Kennedy wasn't right for Willow, but a relationship that she needed at the time. Obviously she was devastated about what happened to Tara. Such a violent death for such a gently soul was just the worst way that the relationship could of ended. But Kennedy was someone who was ballsy, strong and spoke her mind and I think that's what Willow needed at the specific moment in her life. Do I think that Kennedy and Willow are suited for each other long time? Absolutely not. But I do think Kennedy helped Willow's grieving process. I do think the writing and storyline were rushed however. Willow's character arc didn't really go into enough detail. All we really had was Willow thinking she was communicating through Cassie/The First and talking to Tara. In which she expresses how much Tara meant to her. Season 7 in general in my opinion was very rushed. I still loved it, but there was so many sub-plots going on they didn't really have time to focus on one area.   But really, you're absolutely right and the ""defence of Kennedy"" or whatever way you want to phrase it has been made many times. But Kennedy never stood a chance at gaining support IMO anyway. It didn't really matter what her personality was or the characteristics of her relationship with Willow. She wasn't Tara, and that's the key element that people were never going to accept really, and I can understand it.   TLDR; Kennedy wasn't right for Willow, but was a relationship that was needed at the time. Her biggest downfall was that she wasn't Tara, a point I strongly believe Joss made on purpose."
buffy,2y6945,coolbeaNs92,19,Fri Mar 6 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't dislike Kennedy just because of her relationship with Willow (although that is part of it). I also dislike her because I just don't like her character. She thinks she knows what's best, and there's a bit of a leadership crisis in Sunnydale, so everyone gives her more leeway than they probably should. Because she's pretty untested and insufferable ... kind of like Wesley in season 3. Except he came in at a time when no one was prepared to listen to him, and Kennedy came in at a time when everyone was looking for someone to fill a void.  I mean, I'm happy that it all worked out ... that Willow was able to use her to work through her grief and general uneasiness with magic. I think Willow could have done the same without her, though. Kennedy in many ways brought her further from the core Scooby group, and enabled the First to fracture Buffy's support system.   Because Kennedy seduced Willow, Willow nearly lost herself and brought the gun to the house. Because Kennedy didn't respect Buffy, it made it a lot easier for everyone else to turn against her in ""Empty Places,"" as Kennedy had the respect of the Potentials and Willow and also backed Faith. Kennedy was too hard on some of the girls, causing the First to swoop in and talk Chloe into suicide.   Kennedy's legacy is murky for me. She's definitely brave. But she's also foolhardy, and she caused a lot of damage. But, you know ... it all worked out in the end. Not always thanks to her, though, it seems to me. :)"
buffy,2y6945,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sat Mar 7 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"I don't like those things about her. Then again, I personally find few people in the Buffyverse likeable in any strict sense, and most of them are dead."

I just reread the scripts for ""End of Days"" and ""Chosen,"" and I don't see anything that really constitutes an apology.   Maybe this comes closest:   Amanda: (re: Faith) Is she going to be OK?  Kennedy: I'm sure she'll be fine. Right?  ...  Kennedy: You guys heal fast, right? You slayers?  Buffy (absently): Yeah.  Kennedy: So ... she'll be okay?  Buffy: I don't know.  Caridad: What's with the axe-thing?  Buffy: I took it from Caleb. Might be important.  Vi: Let's hope.  Amanda: I think we got punished.  That gets Buffy's attention. She looks at Amanda.  Buffy: What?  Kennedy: We ... we followed her. And it was ...  Vi: It didn't work out.  Buffy: That wasn't her fault. It was a trap. I could've fallen for it as easily as her.  Caridad: So ... are you ... are you, like, back?  Buffy: I don't know. I guess I'm not leaving.  Kennedy nods, satisfied.  Kennedy: So ... we got a plan now or anything?  Buffy: Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.  Amanda: I still think we got punished.   Humility ... not Kennedy's strong suit :) It's not exactly a ""hug and cry and learn and grow"" moment.   I do agree that Kennedy forgives and forgets quickly. And backs Buffy in the final battle, of course. But I think some of that is also because there's just not enough time to deal with everything more in these last few episodes. Kind of like how the bad blood between Giles and Buffy after ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" is more or less ignored after that episode."

Still, the actions of Kennedy are judged more harshly than just about any ancillary character in the Buffyverse."
buffy,2y6945,barre_chord_reality,4,Sat Mar 7 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"The actions of Kennedy are judged more harshly than just about any ancillary character in the Buffyverse.   I try to be an equal-opportunity judger :D To the extent that anything is about blame, anyway (""blame? there's - blame now?"").   No character in the Buffyverse is without flaws. They're presented as real three-dimensional people; they make choices, some good, some bad. I don't mean to suggest that I think Kennedy is a bad person, or a bad Slayer, or a bad girlfriend. She has a lot of good qualities and a lot of potential (pun intended ;).  And yet, I don't really like her. I'm sure that if she had been on the show for more than half a season, that probably would have changed. We never really got to see how she would have grown up, after all.   And I think the writers did Willow a disservice, in a way, by not letting Willow be alone. Willow has never been good at being alone, ever. Even when she has been alone (pre-Oz, post-Oz and pre-Tara, and the part of the 6th season where she was ""detoxing from her magical addiction""), her mindset can largely be described as filled with longing for someone specific. Returning to Sunnydale after the death of Tara would have been an excellent time for her to start figuring out who she is in a way that is not characterized in any way by a romantic relationship with someone else. Especially since she seems to have such a problem with it (she's practically suicidal when Oz cheats on her; she hates her friends for ""ignoring her pain"" when he leaves her; she becomes both homicidal and suicidal when Tara dies). I don't know if jumping into another emotional relationship is the best idea for her at the moment, especially when she's still relatively fragile in her identity (cf. ""The Killer in Me"").  Then again, it seems awfully realistic that Willow would gravitate to someone new right away, rather than focusing on friendship and a support system that is not romantic.  Edit: And the addition of Kennedy also took away from further development of many other characters in season 7, which I think was a shame."
buffy,2y6945,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Mar 7 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"Fantastic observations. This is the kind of discussion that makes this such an excellent sub!  Flawed characters is what makes Buffy work so well -- even going back to season 2 when Buffy wasn't kill Angel when she had the chance, which ultimately cost the life of Jenny Calendar. Xander, Willow and even Giles all make mistakes and do things that make them human and most of all memorable. All these characters made poor decisions at one point in time and all learned from it, and we moved on with them.   With Kennedy, she makes a few stupid mistakes, one of them was pretty abhorrent given the circumstances at the time (kicking Buffy out) but as I stated before she owned up for what she did to Buffy and went on to battle The First bravely.   Aside from that, the only thing that Kennedy did wrong was be there for Tara. Fandom often says that she was a poor replacement for Tara, but who are we to judge Kennedy if she is worthy of Willows affection?   Willow was an adult who was capable of making her own decisions. She also proved that she was capable of moving on from heartbreak and tragedy -- an important part of the grieving process. Had she moved on to somebody who was just like Tara, that would have cheapened her (Tara) death.   You're right in one aspect of this seemingly simple character, in a really complicated situation, there wasn't enough time devoted to fleshing out her character. Instead we had an episode that was mostly Andrew-centric, which I really enjoyed, but like a lot of things in the overall arc of season 7, it was really rushed and not enough time was available to give a proper backstory to Kennedy and what made her who the person she was. Maybe she didn't take away development from other characters, instead maybe not enough time was given to her. :)"

Good drama is about creating interesting characters and then throwing shit at them and watching how they cope. What could possibly have been more devastating for Buffy than to be thrown out of the Scoobies? Even having to kill Angel wasn't as bad. And yet, it led to one of the best scenes in the whole series (""You're the one Buffy"") and forced Buffy to dig really deep inside herself to find the strength to fight the First. I think this process of finding her strength and going after the scythe were the defining elements that allowed Buffy to win in the end. I thought it was fantastic."

Willow snapping over the death of Tara and deciding that the world sucks too much to let it live? Plausible. Willow deciding in cold blood to stab her best friend/team leader/savior in the back, because the chick she's been banging for five minutes has issues with Buffy's leadership style? Not plausible."
buffy,2y6945,barre_chord_reality,6,Sat Mar 7 11:46:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I don't think Willow turned on Buffy because of Kennedy. That would not explain why everyone else turned on Buffy, either. They turned on Buffy because they were terrified.  In spite of Buffy's track record of success, this Big Bad was so bad that all of the Scoobies felt they could lose this time. This Big Bad had lived among them for days and no one, not even Buffy, even noticed. Also, Buffy was making decisions they couldn't understand: keeping Spike in the house in spite of the fact that he's been under the control of The First and has been killing people. She led them into the vineyard where they were powerless. Buffy was beaten, potentials died, Xander lost an eye. People do stupid things when they are scared. They reach for any alternative that seems even remotely hopeful. In this case, the straw they grasped at was a change of leadership: Faith. To me this story line is very plausible."
buffy,2y6945,gemitry,8,Sat Mar 7 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Willow was willing to risk her life to get Buffy out of a catatonic state during the fight with Glory. She brought her back from the dead in S6. The Scoobies had followed Buffy into near-certain death many times. They even forgave her for almost murdering them in ""Normal Again"". And now, in the middle of an apocalypse, they all simultaneously decide that Faith -- with whom none of them have exactly stellar personal associations -- would do a better job, because one mission went bad? C'mon. That's totally nuts. But I guess we'll have to agree to disagree."

It was really a combination of things. It was her being the leader/representative of this group of extremely annoying people, her being so loud and aggressive even though she was new, and yes, it was also the Willow of it all. It feels like the writers were rushing to show Willow moving on, and as such it still feels really forced even on rewatch. More than anything her personality is just so grating from the moment she shows up all ""ehh"" at Buffy, who has died twice and has been a slayer for years. To quote the great Clare Kramer in the classic film Bring It On: ""Sorry, new girl, but nobody hit your buzzer""."
buffy,2y6945,IraninaGenius,7,Sat Mar 7 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"Someone has to train the potentials. Buffy and Giles don’t have the time. So Kennedy steps up. Instead of letting the young women sit around and be scared, she gives them something to do and skills to defend themselves    You forgot the part where Kennedy revels in acting like a cruel drill sergeant to the point where she drives Chloe to suicide. Sure, the First Evil talked her into it, but it was clear that Kennedy played a role in it, calling her ""maggot"" and having her do pushups when she talked back.   The main reason I hated Kennedy was because not only was she a Tara replacement, she was the opposite of Tara in every single way. Tara was quiet and shy and sweet and great at magic. Kennedy was loud and brash and obnoxious and distrusted magic. Her relationship with Willow just didn't make sense to me. She was just basically like ""Willow's gay, I'm gonna totally seduce her"" and Willow was like ""k. Wait, angst about Tara! Never mind, I'm good"". It felt rushed and unnatural, and the fact that Willow would go for someone who was the complete opposite of the love of her life felt wrong."

She is basically a white-hat saint compared to the faults of Faith, Spike, Anya and even Willow, so her biggest fault is not her moral compass, but the fact that sucks the life on every scene she is in. Andrew was right about ignoring her kissing Willow because she makes even girl-on-girl action boring."

It's so hard for a viewer to support Kennedy when we're still recovering from the loss of Tara, who remains Willow's true love And in comparison to two awesome, sweet former Willow-lovers who really connect to the other Scoobies (Tara and Oz) Kennedy seems abrasive and standoffish. And she is. But like you say, she's what Willow needs after losing the love of her life-- someone to keep Willow grounded and TELL her what she needs-- make her decisions for her-- rather than let Willow be the guiding force in the relationship. And maybe given more time Kennedy would have been folded into the Scooby gang, but they were all caught up in more important things like keeping Spike from killing all the girls and defeating the ultimate evil, haha."
buffy,2y6945,DaddyCatALSO,6,Fri Mar 6 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with all this. I never got the overwhelming hate for her. She didn't get near enough screen time to provoke that kind of reaction!  She was hardly going to be the girl Willow's going to spend the rest of her life with, but how many 21(?) year old girls have found their life partner?! I just saw her as someone for Willow to have a bit of fun with to help her feel ready for a real relationship like she had with Tara again."
buffy,2y6945,N4U534,12,Fri Mar 6 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"She got a lot of screen time, IMO. Probably more screen time than Giles in the seventh season. Which was sad, especially as the writers kept writing him as could-be-the-First for several episodes. But no, she's definitely one of the major characters pretty much from her first appearance.   Kennedy and Willow were not about ""having fun"" - or at least not mostly. There was clearly a lot of trust and support and strong emotions between them ... that blossomed very quickly. I always understood Willow's guilt in ""The Killer In Me"" to stem mostly from the fact that she was, in a sense, replacing Tara in her affections. Not in a having-fun sort of way ... but in an emotional connection sort of way.   And as /u/catdoctor points out, she's her ""kite string"" and helps Willow through the scythe spell, prepared to try to kill her if necessary.  The show might be about young adults, but they're not typical young adults at all. Willow killed someone and almost destroyed the world after her last girlfriend was killed. Any relationship they get into could truly be ""for life,"" since they probably won't even live that long. Fighting evil is a dangerous occupation. It's not just Slayers who have an abbreviated life-span; they're really all in mortal danger, all the time."

I hated how she acted like she knew what was best...even though Buffy had been the Slayer for, what, seven years at this point? Buffy definitely made a lot of mistakes, especially in season seven.

buffy,2y6945,getyourowntots,4,Sat Mar 7 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"It's nice that you posted this. :) It's definitely true that Kennedy is brave, as well as always eager to step up and do what she thinks needs to be done. Whether it's training Potentials or standing up to Buffy or being Willow's ""kite string"" or stepping forward to fight the Ubervamps. When other people might be freaked out, she's always the one with an idea and a way to respond.  She reminds me a little of Wesley in season 3. Someone who's not afraid to do the right thing and who has a strong sense of justice - as well as a belief in herself and her own judgment. Which is sometimes (or often) naive. If Buffy hadn't rescued her, she would have been killed by the nest of Ubervamps, after all.  Except Wesley was constantly belittled (in Buffy), and Kennedy found a niche and a place of importance, both with Willow and in the group. But the basic strokes of her character I think are somewhat similar. It would have been interesting to see how she would have developed if her experiences had been more similar to Wesley's."

The images from around the world showing other girls being activated was done in far more positive spin than the way Sineya was shown being given her powers: the nervous girl at the baseball game gaining confidence, the girl who blocks the person who is about the strike her, etc.  So short answer, not when Willow does it, since a) consent by the SiTs, b) activation seen as a positive change."

In general, we women tend to be more respectful of authority and go along with what were told to avoid making waves.

Once you understand that, Riley becomes... well... tolerable.   He is clearly a foil for Buffy and takes on a role which Xander or Willow never have. After Riley's essentially depowered he goes on living in Buffy's world no longer as her equal in the demon fighting business (as he likely believed he was when they first uncovered each other's secrets) to now living completely in her shadow. He no longer had this ""I save the world"" secret to keep... and the show plays that out beautifully IMO. We get yet another angle to what it feels like to be friends with Buffy and be just a human. It made him feel powerless. Like I said, Xander and Willow never really went down that path (Willows struggle with power is more introspective).  Long story short... He's boring and that's mostly the point of him. It helps Buffy look even better by comparison."
buffy,2y4fih,JCizle,9,Fri Mar 6 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"This is a really well thought out assessment of Riley and his overall characters arc on the show. On a further examination of the relationships that Buffy has on the show, it's obvious that none of them can ever be normal, no matter how hard she tries.  On the surface, Riley seemed normal at first, then it turned out he was in some top secret government monster fighting squad. With regards to the actual relationship that Buffy and Riley had, Buffy obviously didn't treat him all that great. This didn't make Buffy a bad person by any means, because Riley went through his own set of tribulations after he got off his super fighting skills elixir.   Still, he was a pretty good guy and treated Dawn really well. I had kind of a new appreciation for his character when he came back in season 6 with a new life with a new person. That made the overall arc of his character work for me, and I think it buttoned things up nicely on the show."
buffy,2y4fih,barre_chord_reality,16,Fri Mar 6 15:34:01 2015 UTC,I think you pretty much capped him there.  He's boring because it's kinda required by the plot.  The fact that he is part of a secret government demon-hunting army and STILL manages to be boring really says something about the poor guy.  I like him though.  He's an NPC like me :)
buffy,2y4fih,DungeonPlunger,13,Fri Mar 6 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really see why Riley ""should"" have been comparable to a Willow, a Xander, or a Giles. Those are characters who have been with Buffy since the beginning, which the audience spent a long time getting to know. They are symbolically Buffy's Spirit, Heart, and Mind.  Riley always read more as Buffy's chance to have a lot of (mostly) consequence-free sex. You're right-- he doesn't have much backstory, or personality. So, then, by what right should he be in a league with the actual Scoobies? To me, he seemed like a longer-running Scott Hope.  More than being boring, his seeming need to compete with Buffy always pissed me off. ""Wah wah, I have to have super powers, or you won't love me..""  Except Buffy has never said anything of the sort, and even when she tries to express her feelings Riley discards them and over-rides her. He decides in his own head how she feels, regardless of her actual feelings, pulls absolutely stupid stunts trying to make himself seem more ""manly"", and let's not even get started on the vampire-bait phase he went through. What people fail to notice-- perhaps because he is ""just a human"" and not the literal monster Buffy's other beaux have been-- is that the relationship with Riley is still extremely toxic. Buffy either has to pretend to be less than she is to appease his ego, or he storms off in a huff, or makes passive-aggressive quips that lead to fights, or goes to consort with the undead only to come back and make a great effort to make Buffy feel bad about herself.   He wants Buffy to be his accessory, and isn't willing to accept that that just isn't the way it's going to work, because this is Buffy's birthright. He's not even willing, once his oh-this-is-actually-killing-me superpowers go away, to work on a different skill or ability that would make him useful to the group. No, he wants to be Hero guy. Point guy. And he resents Buffy because she was born to that, yet he never tries to fully understand what sacrifices go hand in hand with that power.  Buffy's other relationships are easier to question-- her other beaux are mostly monsters who kill people, after all-- but Riley always pissed me off the most. He presents as this loving, normal guy, but his crippling insecurities make him a terrible love interest, because instead of facing those insecurities he tries to blame Buffy for them and deconstruct her."
buffy,2y4fih,kform,7,Fri Mar 6 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"He presents as this loving, normal guy, but his crippling insecurities make him a terrible love interest, because instead of facing those insecurities he tries to blame Buffy for them and deconstruct her.   OMG agreed 1000% Thank you!  Also - you know, he cheats on her and then pretty much blames her for it."
buffy,2y4fih,meliss2105,2,Fri Mar 6 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, man, don't even get me started on that part."
buffy,2y4fih,kralrick,2,Fri Mar 6 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really see why Riley ""should"" have been comparable to a Willow, a Xander, or a Giles.   Of course Riley didn't have as much time to develop as a character as Willow, Xander, or Giles, but like I said, there's a sort of hierarchy on BTVS.  Or rather, more like a web, with Buffy at the center.  Characters that branch directly from Buffy (Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Spike) have a tendency to be much more developed than characters that branch off from them (Tara, Oz, Anya, Jenny, Drusilla, Darla, Harmony).  Riley breaks that pattern.  It's not just a matter of him being boring as a person--Xander is, too, when you get down to it--but just a lack of establishment of his own personhood.    Time isn't really an excuse for that because, by the time Riley left, Spike had been a regular character for about as long as him, but was far more developed in that time.  He'd gone from being the Big Bad hunting for the Gem of Amara to a suicidal Former Big Bad to a demon killing machine to a neutered puppy in love with Buffy against his own will.  He'd established a pretty solid (though antagonistic) relationship with Willow, Xander, and especially Giles, had an independent relationship with Harmony, had his own motivations, and we got Fool for Love which delved into his backstory in a way it hadn't been before and gave his character more dimension.  And he was just comic relief for most of that time!    Riley didn't really get any of that, though.  We got some lipservice to a life in Iowa and the military before Buffy, but we never get to see it.  It's generally accepted that Riley had decent relationships with the Scoobies, but that's really only ever seen when he interacts with Xander (almost exclusively about Buffy).  The only way he really changes in terms of how he thinks and behaves is, as you mentioned, he becomes bitter and insecure because of Buffy.  By the time Riley left, I think even Anya had established more space for herself.  /u/toth-itsbritishslang made a really insightful comment higher up pointing out that the reason we see Riley this way is because the writing is influenced by Buffy's perceptions, and I think that's absolutely right.  I think that's what I was trying to convey in the OP when I said he's a ""woman"", but they said it much better and without all the gender politics tacked on.   Edit:  I just realized how much I rambled in this comment for no real reason.  Sorry, I tend to think with my keyboard.  I agree with you that Buffy's relationship with Riley was never going to be the idyllic paradise a lot of people think it would have been had Buffy gotten her shit together, but I dunno that he was that obsessed with just being better than her.  Sam seemed like a pretty badass chick herself, and I think Buffy actually addresses that at some point."
buffy,2y4fih,coolbeaNs92,2,Fri Mar 6 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"Sam is a pretty badass chick, but there's an important difference between Sam and Buffy: One of them was born to slay, and that means an edge. It really doesn't surprise me that Riley feels more at home with someone he has an easier time competing with. Riley's issue isn't with necessarily strong women, his issue is with seeing himself as helpless to be on par with someone no matter what he does. Sam is badass, but Sam is firmly human, with human limitations, which puts her on a scale where Riley can (at least sometimes) best her.   It's true that Riley doesn't get the build-up that other characters get, and maybe that's because he was supposed to be ""normal guy"", or what have you.  I concede that he wasn't handled with the finesse other characters were, but I think that there's a simple explanation for him not having interplay with the other Scoobies-- he isn't one of them. Early on, Buffy spent a lot of time ignoring her friends in favor of bland smoochies with Riley, and then ignoring them in favor of working with the Initiative, so it's not surprising to me that there wasn't much of a bridge or connection once Riley was added to the group. After all, no matter how much time he spends in civvies, Riley is still soldier-guy at the end of the day.   Then again, I'm also clearly biased and willing to admit it.  I hate few characters in the series the way I hate Riley ( at the moment I can only think of Dawn, Ted-- and he was a robot!, and Joyce during her if-you-leave-don't-come-back speech)."
buffy,2y4fih,poor_yorick,45,Fri Mar 6 20:27:58 2015 UTC,I actually never really understood the extreme hatred for Riley.
buffy,2y4fih,RoflPancakeMix,17,Fri Mar 6 12:31:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the biggest flaw with Riley is that Buffy didn't love him."
buffy,2y4fih,lecherous_hump,11,Fri Mar 6 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the biggest flaw of Riley is that he's your normal average guy that most people hope to find in our reality.. If you take away The Initiative, he's the best of what you would call ""average Joe"". Kind, loving, loyal, and mostly importantly, safe.    It's great in reality, but for a supernatural genre show, Riley never stood a chance in every sense of the word. I've always liked Riley and really empathised for his character. But even if Buffy hadn't started pulling away from Riley, and even if Riley hadn't gone out and tried to fill that void, they didn't wouldn't of worked as a couple IMO.   But absolutely as /u/meliss2105 said, the hatred of Riley is unjust."
buffy,2y4fih,CopyRogueLeader,8,Fri Mar 6 22:28:25 2015 UTC,"Right? I kind of liked him. He wasn't that bad. In terms of poorly developed love interests, I always compare him to Kennedy. And she was so much worse."
buffy,2y4fih,JoyousCacophony,3,Fri Mar 6 20:36:34 2015 UTC,Me neither. I liked his character and I was sad to see him go.
buffy,2y4fih,fff8e7cosmic,4,Sun Mar 8 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"He's just kind of there, but is what his character's supposed to be.  Compare to Kennedy, who's supposed to be some sexy free spirit but is actually just grating, or Dawn, who remains a charicature of annoyance even after the season they already spent on that."
buffy,2y4fih,Markatansky,11,Fri Mar 6 18:09:49 2015 UTC,Kennedy is the worst thing that happened to that show.

buffy,2y4fih,Ashton42,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:31:13 2015 UTC,For me that spot's taken by Tara. She's not a great character and at the time not a great actress.  She only served to advance Willow's growth.
buffy,2y4fih,AdelaisV,13,Fri Mar 6 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think that's completely fair to Tara. At least she had a backstory, and she did find her agency in season 6, even if she was pretty much a Willow groupie before that. And I don't think Amber Benson was a bad actress, just a limited one in a limited role -- she showed some real chops when she was finally allowed to be a little more assertive.  Maybe it's just that I can't blame her, because I would totally be a Willow groupie."
buffy,2y4fih,emdesch,9,Fri Mar 6 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she really became a great character in season 6.  Family is one of my favourite episodes, and I loved how she kept hanging around with Dawn and Buffy after she temporally 'breaks up' with Willow, and giving Buffy support during the whole Spike situation.  Also, the scene in S5 where she refuses to tell Glory the location of the Key, even after having her hand broken, is one of my favourites of the series."
buffy,2y4fih,emdesch,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't find Tara annoying or anything, but she pretty much was just there to give Willow something to do from season 4-6.  I can't complain though, given that the end result was Dark Willow."

buffy,2y4fih,Ahesterd,6,Fri Mar 6 14:50:45 2015 UTC,I dread season 5 because of Dawn. She's the one character I really could have done without. I'd take a hundred Rileys over her.

buffy,2y4fih,Sammyboy616,2,Fri Mar 6 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"I just got done with a Season 5 marathon and I think she's pretty great in this season.  To only be 14, she shows a lot of courage and wit.

buffy,2y4fih,JangoF76,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"TBH, even in season 6 she wasn't consistently annoying like characters such as Carl Grimes.

buffy,2y4fih,ElectronicPotato,3,Sat Mar 7 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"Dawn was supposed to be annoying, though. If she had been the perfect little sister, her big reveal as the Key wouldn't have created the same emotional tension."

I think I was always too focused on Marc Blucas' terrible acting (even he admits it was terrible) to notice the weakness.

buffy,2y4fih,krabat-,5,Sat Mar 7 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"He was never supposed to shine.   I think you're exactly right with this. Riley was supposed to be the boring, safe, nice guy, so that Buffy could work out her issues.   BUFFY: But then I can't help thinking, isn't that where the fire comes from? Can a nice, safe relationship be that intense? It's nuts, but part of me believes that real love and passion have to go hand in hand with lots of pain and fighting...   So basically, Riley existed to help Buffy get over her bad boy complex and date a normal guy. Of course, it didn't last, but that's a whole different story...  I think he was always aware that Buffy was way out of his league. He has a moment of introspection in S5 - at the end of The Replacement? - where he casually mentions to Xander that he knows Buffy doesn't love him. That really made me feel for the guy.  But yeah, I was glad he left when he did too. I have nothing against him as a character, but he'd pretty much worn out his welcome by that point in the show."
buffy,2y4fih,waitressinthesky,6,Fri Mar 6 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"I really think the writers could have done more with his character, though, while still keeping him the safe nice guy.   You can be boring and still have plenty of depth.  I think if we'd gotten more backstory from him--how he got involved with The Initiative, his first experience with the supernatural, the reasons behind him joining the military in the first place, his relationship with his family--it might have given the audience more of something to root for.  Like, say, his mother was sick so he enlisted so he could help her with medical bills.  Or his father was a military man and it put pressure on him to join, too.  Or his drill sergeant was turned into a vampire, encouraging him to become a monster hunter.  Or, hell, they coulda given us some flashbacks to him meeting Forest and Professor Walsh so maybe we could have been conflicted right along with him in Season 4.  We're told that Professor Walsh is like a mother to him, but we never really see that relationship beyond her giving him orders and him blindly following them.  It would have also helped to establish that the guy actually did exist without Buffy at some point.  Flashbacks are such a powerful tool when establishing a character, and they're so underutilized for Riley compared to Angel or Spike."
buffy,2y4fih,buffanater,3,Fri Mar 6 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"You make a really excellent point about the flashbacks. I feel like where the writing falls down here is that BTVS spends a lot of time trying to make characters with an established 'side' in the fight against evil more complex (i.e. Giles' 'Ripper' persona, or Spike's sympathetic backstory), and they do that through flashback a lot of the time. Riley doesn't get the honour because it undermines his plot purpose to make him more complex. I think what's crucial here is Buffy's reaction after the misdirect/plot-drop with his character in 'Doomed'. She says something like, ""I thought you were a nice, normal guy,' to which he says ""I am a nice, normal guy,' and that's what he needs to be. His only meaning is in what he means to her. She wants boring, she sees boring, he is boring. The writing mistakes 'normal adulthood' for boring, because Buffy does. We see that attitude again in season 6, and then again in 'Conversations with Dead People'; Buffy's whole world revolves around her, and we're along for the ride. Riley finally developing a little complexity, starting with that moment in 'The Replacement' is the beginning of that self-indulgence and egocentrism unravelling (along with Dawn's arrival in the previous ep). Looking at it this way, it kind of casts Buffy in an unfavourable light. This isn't where I intended to go with this thought when I started out, but it's kind of interesting.  Edit: Three variations of 'ego-something' until landing on the right word. Tired."
buffy,2y4fih,Ashton42,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they definitely could've done more, but maybe they didn't want to bother wasting too much time fleshing out his character when they knew he wasn't going to be kept around for very long? Or we weren't supposed to root for him and Buffy as a couple, hence the blandness? He was just sort of the unremarkable transitional college boyfriend between Angel and Spike, I don't think we as an audience were really meant to get too emotionally invested in that relationship. Like you said, he comes into Buffy's life, serves his purpose and then gets the hell outta Dodge.  He did have at least one shining moment that springs immediately to mind - when he punched Parker in the face. I was so rooting for somebody to punch Parker in the face. God, that was satisfying..."

It's like, a) you're a putz because you're still here, and b) you're kind of a jerk because you're putting that shit on her close friend, who didn't fucking ask. If you know your relationship isn't going anywhere, you're not doing anyone any favors by hanging around and complaining about it."
buffy,2y4fih,Sammyboy616,5,Fri Mar 6 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"You nailed it. He's so, so boring, and totally does reflect the way female love interests are treated in other shows. Interestingly he has some similar mannerisms to one of my all-time favorite characters: Malcolm Reynolds! I like to think of Riley as a boring Earth-that-was prototype of a pre-war Mal. But he still sucks."
buffy,2y4fih,IraninaGenius,3,Fri Mar 6 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Riley, but I can't like him either. In a show filled with excellently written, beautifully developed characters, ...Riley is also there. He just kind of... exists."
buffy,2y4fih,filletsteak,2,Fri Mar 6 13:06:29 2015 UTC,"I have to comment on this because as I was watching 4 and 5 again last month I actually really thought about this onscreen relationship in regards to everyday people and relationships they go through, so here it is.  In season 4 we see this relationship developing, Riley likes Buffy first and starts to pursue her in the fashion he has grown up to know in that Grant Wood country lifestyle of his. That safe and slow way.   Let us halt here for a moment and look to Buffy and Angel, right off the bat he knew she was the Slayer. Right away they were side by side in the thick of evil, they were on the same base. Our approach is already worlds apart. How many of us here have had both? Someone who immediately draws the passion out of you, and another whom you may not be interested in but when you come to find they are interested in you, your curiosity perks? I feel the writers were trying to convey these differences we seek as we go through relationships with people in our lives.  Buffy says no as soon as she finds out he's been hiding the commando deal, when he pushes she figures it is worth a go. Angel never pushed for her to be with her, the electricity was in the air every second. In retrospect on this relationship, and as we look to our own in some cases, we realize it's a way of playing it safe.   Now, my absolute favorite scene is in ""Into the Woods"" where Riley is telling Buffy how strong she has been through the entire ordeal with her mother, how she didn't cry once and she replies that she cried all the time. Marc Blucas nailed the scene with a look, a blink really. It took on this, ""you've never trusted me, you've never wanted to be close to me. So much, i'm still a stranger you can't cry in front.""  I don't know about you guys and gals, but god knows I've been on the Buffy end of this scene. The people we find safe we never can truly show our true selves to. This was the problem with Buffy and Riley, Riley could commit his whole heart to her, but she just couldn't. Why? She couldn't help the way she felt, it's human nature."
buffy,2y4fih,pokemonboy2003,2,Fri Mar 6 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"I hated Riley, but not because he was boring. It was because he was a terrible, selfish boyfriend.   In season 5, Buffy goes through the worst shit she's ever had to deal with. Her mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor that's slowly killing her, her sister is really a ball of energy and all of her memories are false, and she's fighting a hellgod that's far stronger than anything else she's faced. Understandably, she doesn't really have the time to focus all of her energy on her relationship. But she still tries. Buffy tries to spend time with Riley and make him feel important. But throughout everything, he just whines that she isn't paying enough attention to her. He should be supporting her in the toughest time of her life but instead he's a whiny bitch. Riley even ends up going to get sucked off (literally) by some vampires whores because he feels so neglected. He was not there at all when Buffy needed him the most and tried to make everything about himself when he was insignificant in the grand scheme of things.   That's why I hate Riley, not because he was bland."
buffy,2y4fih,cocainelady,2,Fri Mar 6 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I didn't hate Riley until the whole ""lemme get my blood dick sucks by female vamps"" scene.  That was low, that was foul."

He was the only one even near stable that she had interest in, and he was the only human that could hang with her. Everyone calls him boring, but considering that every tiny aspect of Buffy's life was filled to the brim with drama and the supernatural, I'd imagine he might be good for her."

It's forgotten by a lot of people, but it's so important and takes away from Joss's original vision.  If a remastering is going to take place, you need to have Joss and the directors back in to make sure none of the original ideas are lost.

For the record, ""cropped"" in this context doesn't mean ""bad"" - Joss prefers the 4:3 versions as that's how they were intended, and opening it up to 16:9 causes a whole host of things to appear in frame that were never meant to. They were only shot in 16:9 at all because that saves on 35mm film (16:9 is 3 perforations tall versus 4:3's 4 perforations tall). Seasons 1-3 were shot on 16mm, and are always 4:3 unless you crop off the top and bottom, like Pivot has been doing."

Commercial hair dye didn't come into common use until the mid 20th century, and that's when we see Spike go platinum.

At the beginning of Season 7, when Spike is hiding in the basement and somewhat crazy, he has long-ish hair with dark roots. He has forgotten to care about his personal grooming. When he comes out and puts on a fresh shirt (which he later - in the fabulous church scene - comments ""didn't work"") he also gets a hair cut and a fresh dye job.  * My mistake.

It still bums me out to this day that they never got the green-light for the pilot/concept they created. It's a win/win for Buffy fans and all the actors/production team. Animation is relativity cheap to produce while still being aesthetically pleasing. Most actors love voice work because they can do it on their own schedule and don't have to go through makeup and all that jazz. Age factors don't matter as we're only hearing voices. Win/win for all.   Just a shame it never happened :(

I have to confess that this kind of cryptic foreshadowing, symbolism, or insertion of meaning is one part of the show's writing that I've never cared for.   I would have thought that the expiration date of her mom's credit card would foreshadow, if anything, her mom's expiration date. Which was in the fifth season, in the year 01. Just a thought :)"
buffy,2y0av9,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever actively tried to foreahadow Joyce's death, did they?  She dies of natural causes, so I always thought they intentionally left out any supernatural references to it.  Not that a credit card's expiration date is especially supernatural, but being that the line came out of Buffy's mouth while she was supernaturally possessed by Faith.  If it is intended to foreshadow Joyce's death, I am disappoint."
buffy,2y0av9,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Mar 6 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be a little more disappointed if it foreshadowed anything, to be honest.  I mean, it's a credit card number. Why should that have any special meaning? It's not in a dream ... it's not something connected to Faith or Buffy at all, except for the fact that Faith is reading it off. It was something issued to her mom more or less randomly. I guess it means she's had the credit card for a while, and it's coming time to wrap things up financially (foreshadowing money problems? All will run out or expire in 5/01?), but other than that ... I'd be more willing to base some sort of theory on Joyce and Faith's choice (and Faith's subsequent rejection) of the ""Harlot"" lipstick.  But then again, that might just be me. Since they changed it from 5/02 to 5/01, there was probably a reason. Maybe you came up with the right one :)  Edit:   I don't think they actively tried to foreshadow Joyce's death, did they?   Not really, I don't think. It was sudden, but she had been ill, so it was ""foreshadowed"" as much as most normal deaths by natural causes are foreshadowed.  Many people point to the so-called ""funny aneurysm"" line in ""The Freshman"" as ""foreshadowing"" Joyce's death. I'm not sure if it was intended to or not. Personally, I hope not. :) Sometimes a figure of speech is just a figure of speech.   It makes sense to me that Buffy would, on some subconscious level, be aware of the upcoming mind manipulation spell and would dream about it. It makes sense to me that Faith may be able to speak to Buffy mind-to-mind when they are unconscious, and that in that state she would not be concerned with protecting the Mayor. It makes sense to me that Tara, when she's been rendered mad by Glory, would be able to see truths about Giles that others cannot. Slayers can have prophetic dreams, and I think they're aware of (or more receptive to) things that are ""outside"" their current linear timeline. Along with insane people like Drusilla, and, at times, Tara and Joyce.  I find it ... less consistent to ascribe some kind of preternatural ""awareness"" or foreshadowing to other people or actions or circumstances, especially when more prosaic explanations are very likely. Like the spider demon dripping goo on Xander's eye in ""Selfless."" Or the ""funny aneurysm"" line.  But that may be just how I see it. I could be wrong. :)   Edit #2: To be clear, I do think the writers/directors often present things in a particular way to emphasize subtleties or themes: like the clothes the characters wear, or the fact that Buffy gets a cut on her arm in ""Bad Girls"" that looks oddly like Faith's tattoo in the same spot. Maybe Xander's choice of Halloween costume (with the eyepatch) is meant to suggest a kind of deliberate blindness or naïveté in his decision to announce that ""he's going to marry that girl."" Caleb gives a reason for why he takes out Xander's eye. I don't know exactly whether there is a deeper meaning to why a spider demon's sticky ""rope wad"" would target his eye specifically, but maybe there is a reason that is somehow connected with him ""seeing."" ;)"
buffy,2y0av9,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Mar 6 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"You're right, theres absolutely no reason it should have any significance.  More of an easter egg than actual foreshadowing.  I thought I was just thinking about it too much (Dawn's first full episode isn't nearly as significant as her first appearance) until I went back and saw it'd been changed.  I'm just always really impressed by how much forethought was put into each season.  Most shows I've seen seem to play it by ear from one season to the next, but most of the major events in Buffy were planned by the third season.   Edit: And of course I post a comment about Joyce's death not being foreshadowed at all just a couple hours before watching The Real Me and catching a line that I think might be exactly that.  After Buffy and Dawn come back from the murder scene at The Magic Box, Joyce is scolding Buffy for letting Dawn go there.  Buffy responds by saying, ""It's not like she saw the body!""  Only in the episode The Body, Dawn does see Joyce's body.  Joyce is concerned about protecting Dawn's innocence and shielding her from the consequences of Buffy's job, but it's actually Joyce's death, which has nothing to do with the supernatural, that ends up traumatizing her.  Not exactly the magical kind of foreshadowing we see in Graduation Day or Restless, so I think it keeps in line with the show's tendency to separate Joyce from all the supernatural destiny stuff, but I think it's at least gotta be an attempt by the writers to set up some kind of irony.  I've watched the entire series at least 5 times now, but for some reason I'm noticing a lot more this time around than I ever did before.   Edit 2:  Also, in this same episode, Harmony tells Spike that Buffy will be dead by sunrise.  In The Gift, Buffy dies right as the sun is coming up.  I'm probably overthinking that one--Harmony's statement isn't at all out of context or strange--but I thought it was neat."
buffy,2y0av9,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Mar 6 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"I've always just been really impressed with how much forethought was put into each season   Me too! :) Hardly anything is forgotten. Choices have consequences, sometimes years down the road. The foundation for something like Willow's increasing reliance on magic to make her problems disappear was established years before her ""downfall"" in season 6.   It's pretty amazing. Characters often go in directions that seem totally unexpected, until you realize that it actually makes a lot of sense. Whedon's shows are definitely something special :)  Edit:  I just saw your edit about Joyce and ""Real Me,"" and I really liked what you said about the two ""bodies"":   Joyce is concerned with protecting Dawn's innocence and shielding her from the consequences of Buffy's job, but it's actually Joyce's death, which has nothing to do with the supernatural, that ends up traumatizing her.   That is an insight I can get behind :)"
buffy,2y040e,starlit_moon,7,Thu Mar 5 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"1) It was the first, the only one that wasn't visited by the first in that episode was Buffy. You know it was the first, because at the end, her mom shows up and tells her that Buffy wont choose her, which is lies meant to divide them.  2) I think she went all ""gotta kill 'em all"" on Anya because of what she had done, because she had killed so many people this time."
buffy,2y040e,shifty4321,5,Thu Mar 5 13:27:28 2015 UTC,"Also, nobody remembers anything from the Wish-verse, so they probably wouldn't know that you had to destroy the necklace."

The final fight, and everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil.""

The only clue they had about that was that in ""Older and Far Away,"" Anya told them to ""get [Halfrek's] pendant."" However, she never told them why, and they never got it anyway, so they probably don't even remember that or have any context for what she wanted to do with it.

The Anya thing...basically it's a continuity error, i've seen it discussed here a couple of times and there doesn't seem to be any satisfying in universe answer for the 'power centre' debate iirc (if anyone remembers anything from the show please correct me), in my head canon, the power centres were unique and specific to each demon and were used so d'hoffryn could keep his vengeance demons in line. Assuming the baseline rules are once you lose your powers you never get them back, i.e once your power centre is destroyed you don't get another one, that would seem like a reasonable way to root out any weak or ineffective vengeance demons too. Anyway so when D'hoffryn gives anya her powers back he's making an exception to the rules and so imbues her with the powers herself, not the necklace like usual procedure, i don't know even for head canon this theory is a little baseless but it's all i got."

Unless you're saying the error is that we don't see Anya wearing the necklace like she used to (or like Hallie does), but maybe she's just being more careful with it than she was before because she knows how easily it can get broken. We know she doesn't have to be wearing it or even touching it for it to work, as she lends it to Cordelia in ""The Wish."" If she doesn't need to wear it to use its power, then she could be carrying it in a pocket, or even keeping it in a safe location like a jewelry box.  Edit: Added more."

When I first read this, I agreed, but now I'm not so sure. I'll think on it. It's definitely part of what makes her badass, but I don't know if it's the main or most important reason. And authority systems are not all bad in Buffy's world. If they were, then she'd be Faith, and Faith would never have gone to prison.  Has anyone else ever been bothered by the fact that Buffy does tend to use violence all the time to solve her problems? Normally, this is a perfectly acceptable response in her world, and I have no problem with it. But I was always a little unsettled by the way she threatened the thugs who were throwing Michael (""the boy version of a witch"") against the lockers in ""Gingerbread,"" and by the way everyone backed off when she approached them.

buffy,2xuznk,GinaZaneburritos,4,Wed Mar 4 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"They are obviously related :) Tara's line in ""Restless"" hints at ""more to come"" in the next season, and also segues nicely into the theme of ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" and, by extension, season 5.  I knew Marti Noxon talked specifically about this episode and Dracula's line on one of the DVD featurettes, so I looked it up. The following is my amateur transcription. :) The lines in bold describe footage from the show, which is interspersed with Marti Noxon's commentary in normal text.   Dracula: I have yearned for you. For a creature whose darkness rivals my own.  Thematically, what we were going for was that Dracula represents a kind of ""dark side"" (scene of the Primitive talking to Buffy in ""Intervention"") that Buffy feels she has in her that we sort of pushed1 with the Primitive in season 4.   Dracula: Do you know why you can't resist?  Buffy: Because you're famous?  Dracula: Because you do not want to.  The scene which Dracula makes Buffy bite him is to continue to explore the theme that we had been exploring in season 4 (dream sequence with Faith from ""This Year's Girl"") which was, how much of her power comes from the fact that there's  something inside of her that is actually a killer.  Dracula: You think you know what you are ... what's to come  And we went as far as to actually have her take blood from Dracula because in a way, we were sort of saying, ""it's already there.""  Buffy drinks from Dracula's wrist.  Dracula: Find it. Darkness. Find your true nature.  Buffy's eyes open. Scenes of Buffy running, blood flowing through veins, the Primitive, Buffy staking, fighting  This is the side of the Slayer that she has to sort of make peace with. Either she's going to go all the way and sort of embrace the darkness, or she's going to find a way to live with it.  Dracula: Always alone.  You know, those are constant themes in our show, which is about how do you deal with power? You know, and how do you deal with your own darker impulses without becoming self-destructive or destructive to other people.   Edit:  1: I have listened to this sentence at least 6 times, and I'm still not sure what this word is. ""Pushed with the Primitive in season 4"" is my best guess. Could also be proposed, or maybe some other word."
buffy,2xuznk,thebeardednurse,2,Wed Mar 4 13:15:57 2015 UTC,"OOOOOO!  Nice catch.....I think that Tara saying it is addressing Willow, and Dracula saying it, is addressing Buffy, if I remember right.  That said, I think of this in this way, Tara=good, Dracula=bad.  In the Buffyverse there seems to be a lot of ""gray"" area, or a lot of crossover.  Tara, being good, was addressing the bad that would happen to willow, and dracula, being bad, was addressing the good that would happen with buffy.  Specifically end of season 6 for willow and end of season 5 for buffy.  Granted lots of hindsight being 20/20, but that's what I think it is."
buffy,2xuznk,Chicken421,8,Wed Mar 4 02:50:49 2015 UTC,"No Tara is definitely saying it to Buffy as it is said right when Buffy walks into her room at the end of Restless. I believe it's really just foreshadowing the whole of her power lying in darkness/coming from the shadow people, and as we see shortly afterwards Buffy starts trying to learn what she is, where the power is from, and how she can control it better. The what's to come part could mean anything that happens onward, but it's a safe bet to assume he means Buffy's death in The Gift. That's just my interpretation though. :)"

buffy,2xpw3q,Tailas,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:13:07 2015 UTC,True. But that doesn't mean some studio exec will change his mind and make it an origin story after all.
buffy,2xpw3q,AgentPeggyCarter,3,Tue Mar 3 16:56:58 2015 UTC,"Guys, don't get too excited. Nothing's official and the news came first from Latino Review (an unreliable source)."

buffy,2xpw3q,AgentPeggyCarter,2,Tue Mar 3 15:45:55 2015 UTC,It's been confirmed by Deadline.
buffy,2xpw3q,Truant_Muse,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:22:51 2015 UTC,It's not confirmed. Nothing's confirmed. It's all just rumored right now. Deadline saw the other news agencies picking up on the story originally sourced from Latino Review and reported on it.
buffy,2xob5g,strawberryf1elds,15,Mon Mar 2 15:26:35 2015 UTC,Anya's monologue. I think about it everytime a loved one passes away.
buffy,2xob5g,simo808,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:25:24 2015 UTC,Lost one of my best friends last week. Anya accurately describes the rollercoaster of sadness that we've been going through.  Fuck.
buffy,2xob5g,revolut1onname,14,Tue Mar 3 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"I plan to watch all of Buffy again next winter. I don't know yet if I will skip ""The Body."" I think I may. Especially since I'm tearing up right now."
buffy,2xob5g,A40,8,Mon Mar 2 15:43:16 2015 UTC,I'm watching Buffy for the first time atm. Last episode I watched was The Body. It's been two weeks. I'm obviously going to go back to the show but it's all too raw at the moment.
buffy,2xob5g,Blacknarcissa,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:59:51 2015 UTC,Truly heartrending :-(
buffy,2xob5g,A40,2,Tue Mar 3 00:00:54 2015 UTC,It's so awful because of how perfectly it is acted and executed overall. I cried so damn much.  It's funny cause my friends who've seen the show kept saying (before I'd seen the episode) it's going to get so much worse/more emotional/more painful.  Then I would've said.. oh it's that person? I'm not that bothered about that person. But now... fuck it was so sad and it connected so much and it was so realistic.  When the paramedic is talking to Buffy and we see her POV that cuts the upper half of his face out of frame... it's so small but it's so effective and truthful.
buffy,2xob5g,Blacknarcissa,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:16:05 2015 UTC,I'm doing a rewatch with my roommate who has never seen it. So I kinda have to watch it or I'll give it away. Thankfully we're still in season 2.
buffy,2xob5g,wiiildflower,9,Tue Mar 3 03:26:40 2015 UTC,"Welp, I just teared up reading the description of The Body.   I always skip it (along with ""Forever"") on rewatches. It's perfectly done, but it's just...too much.  For what it's worth, I can rewatch Hole in the World. I'm a complete mess after watching it, though."
buffy,2xob5g,lightswitch_raver,12,Mon Mar 2 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Hole in the World is so perfectly done too. It's different from the Body though because it portrays the utterly gut-wrenching pain before death, whereas the Body depicts the confusion and banality of what happens after death. Joyce's death, unlike Fred's, doesn't pack the real punch of the episode, it's the reactions of Buffy and everyone that really make me get watery."
buffy,2xob5g,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Mar 2 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"For me, ""A Hole in the World"" is much easier to watch than ""The Body.""   ""The Body"" puts you in a state of mind and keeps you there for nearly the entire episode. There's no music ... no distractions ... no relief. Time slows down; events happen more or less in real time, and you really feel the weight of the aftermath of a loved one's death.  ""A Hole in the World"" has some truly awful scenes, but it also has a lot of humor, and there's a sense of time and events moving inexorably but also quickly. And they are powerless to stop it, but it's not the same deadening, slow feeling from ""The Body."" For me, it's not nearly as hard to re-watch.  ""Wilson's Heart"" from House is sort of difficult, but it's also really cool. Kind of like ""A Hole in the World"" in that way. ""The Body"" is unique in terms of difficult episodes, I think."
buffy,2xob5g,zixkill,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:41:31 2015 UTC,"No, dead Joyce was really the point where you tip over. It was mostly about everyone's reactions yes, but the moment Buffy sees Joyce dead on the couch and becomes completely powerless for the first time since becoming The Slayer. That right there totally wrecked me."
buffy,2xob5g,lavelle1982,11,Tue Mar 3 01:08:38 2015 UTC,They've forgotten Futurama Jurassic Bark.  I refuse to watch this episode a 2nd time.

buffy,2xob5g,kodachikuno,5,Mon Mar 2 23:26:38 2015 UTC,"I grew up watching BTVS with my mom every week. We are incredibly close. As an adult I rewatched the whole series and forgot the Body existed. As soon as the episode ended I called my mom sobbing and she just said over the phone ""oh honey you never rewatch 'the Body'"" and let me cry it out for a bit. I was 23. It gets to me man."
buffy,2xob5g,zixkill,5,Mon Mar 2 22:52:42 2015 UTC,"Not that I would ever skip it, but Seeing Red always makes my heart just drop out from under me when I hear the line, ""Your shirt..."""

buffy,2xob5g,venusdances,13,Mon Mar 2 16:30:44 2015 UTC,"A Hole in the World is the only episode that made me cry on the second viewing. So for me, it's the saddest.   Edit: spelling, damn autocorrect"
buffy,2xob5g,soundman1024,10,Mon Mar 2 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Aw I disagree! I think for me I cried the most at The Body, Forever, Hole in the World, the Prom, and the Gift. There are so many choices though. Becoming is really heart-breaking too, and Grave, and Seeing Red and parts of Chosen and Not Fade Away. Wow as I'm thinking about this I'm getting really upset haha."
buffy,2xob5g,coolbeaNs92,4,Mon Mar 2 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part, to me the saddest episodes in the Buffyverse are the Gift, the Body, Hole in the World, I Will Remember You and the Prom. I just can't help but cry whenever I watch them."
buffy,2xob5g,LarsP,2,Mon Mar 2 21:37:00 2015 UTC,Confession: I haven't actually watched I Will Remember You yet. I had just finished BTVS when I started Angel so I was really emotionally vulnerable and didn't want to cry again so soon after Chosen haha. I'm planning on watching it when I do the rewatch though!
buffy,2xob5g,wildeyes,3,Mon Mar 2 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"I actually just watched it for the first time last night along with Pang. (Pang is the Native Americans arriving for Thanksgiving at Giles place.) I'm watching Buffy and Angel together on my first go. I Will Remember You was absolutely fantastic. It adds a lot of depth to the star-crossed-lovers plotline and gives a lot of perspective on the value Angel places on the human experience. I'm very glad I watched it. I was questioning the need to watch them together, but this episode adds a lot to Buffy's story, even if it is outside of her world so to speak. Strong recommends."
buffy,2xob5g,kpeteymomo,3,Mon Mar 2 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"it's not even close to being in the Top 5 of sad Buffyverse episodes!   I think a lot of people would disagree with that, and I'm one of them :)   It's 100% personal preference. What you find sad, I might not."

buffy,2xob5g,kpeteymomo,3,Mon Mar 2 17:53:08 2015 UTC,Even reading the description made me misty.
buffy,2xob5g,AngryWizard,3,Mon Mar 2 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"It's painful to watch, but I've never skipped it on rewatches.  It's too good to skip- I just have to make sure I'm in the right frame of mind to watch it."
buffy,2xob5g,dcr108,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"Same, I never skip it, but sometimes I have to delay it - put my rewatch on hold until I'm mentally ready for it. That said, I think I've cried more over The Gift than I have the Body, but selfless sacrifice paired with beautiful orchestral music is the fastest way to get me bawling my eyes out."
buffy,2xob5g,timms5000,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:21:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree!  I don't cry a ton during The Body (although Anya's fruit punch speech is a definite tear jerker), but it just puts me in a kind of somber mood.  The Body makes me cry a TON, though.  I completely lose it when Spike cries at the end."
buffy,2xob5g,barre_chord_reality,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean The Gift there at the end, and yeah me too: the dive, the emotion, Spike's breakdown, the look on Giles' face, and that damned powerful music. 🎶 Ugh. Love it/hate it."
buffy,2xob5g,timms5000,2,Tue Mar 3 12:45:19 2015 UTC,Ok so I just watched Hole in the World for the first time and it destroyed me... Why does Joss do this to us??
buffy,2xob5g,Ahesterd,3,Tue Mar 31 03:00:51 2015 UTC,Am I dead inside? I got slightly misty eyed once while watching the Body and I have never outright cried while watching TV. How peopke tearing up just reading a synapsis?
buffy,2xob5g,barre_chord_reality,4,Mon Mar 2 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"Everybody takes in and absorbs media differently. As corny as it sounds, I invite these fictional characters into my life, I make them part of who I am while I'm watching the show.   There aren't enough shows that are well written enough, or have enough characters that have enough of an impact on me to dig so far deep into a show, but Buffy is one of them that has. I watch lots of other TV shows where I watch it, and while the show may be good, or even great, I don't get sucked into their world like I do with Buffy, or to some extent Angel.   I'm sure there are lots of folks who just watch shows for the sake of watching them and have no real (or imaginary) vested interest in them. Others do."
buffy,2xob5g,catdoctor,2,Mon Mar 2 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I have vested interest in Buffy's characters way more than any other show, it's just not a natural reaction for me to cry while watching TV."
buffy,2xoksb,TheOneAndOnlyTainted,20,Mon Mar 2 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it will be back up shortly after. Like Doctor Who, it was ""taken off"" a few months ago, but it was back up almost right away."
buffy,2xoksb,Gingetonic,11,Mon Mar 2 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"Well, DW never actually left Netflix. There was all this worry about it being supposed to leave, but BBC and Netflix renegotiated before it was gone. Given the fan favorite status of Buffy/Angel, we could see something similar, though the fact that it's not a currently running show could have a negative impact on that potential."
buffy,2xoksb,BlobDude,3,Mon Mar 2 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"Okay. I didn't realize DW was never taken down. I just remember the hype of the contract being up, I guess.

buffy,2xoksb,Gingetonic,2,Mon Mar 2 18:47:09 2015 UTC,Scrubs was also renegotiated. That's not currently running.

If enough people express that then they will re-negotiate their contracts to keep the shows on longer. IT WORKS. I went online and chatted with a Netflix representative and said that I didn't want MLP: Friendship is Magic and Jem and the Holograms to go, and the person said ""ME NEITHER! Tell other Netflix users to express that because Netflix does want to know what programming they should keep. And they often do listen and will try to re-negotiate.""  And both shows (and other Hasbro shows) ended up getting extended for about two more months, and I think they are still negotiating for more time...because people contacted Netflix.

buffy,2xpn0b,srauf456,9,Mon Mar 2 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well, there isn't really a lot to have an opinion on to be honest.   I mean, mostly a character aimed to give Giles a bit more purpose and distinguish that Giles is no longer ""just a Watcher"" and has his own personal life. I think Olivia's small amount of screen time reflected the casual ""friends with benefits"" type of relationship they had going on. Two adults who were friends and had sexual feelings for each but didn't want to commit.   I think due to the fact that during the dream state in Restless, we see Olivia in Giles' dream could point to some kind of sign that maybe, if the circumstances were different, there could have been more of a commitment. Although, to be honest, it was probably more about convenience and tying in the Buffy/Giles farther/daughter storyline during the dream-state.  But yeah, it's hard to really have a great amount of attachment or feelings to a character who was only in two episodes and who season 10 spoilers"
buffy,2xpn0b,coolbeaNs92,3,Mon Mar 2 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"I think Giles would have been open to more, but at one point Olivia indicates everything might be too much for her.

I was also right."" Olivia: ""So everything you told me was true."" Giles: ""Well no, um, I wasn't actually one of the original members  of Pink Floyd. But the monster stuff, yes.""

buffy,2xpn0b,coolbeaNs92,3,Wed Mar 4 02:06:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I don't think that would have necessarily lead to more of a commitment, but it certainly was the major factor in the ending of the relationship."

buffy,2xm3bi,Mollywobbles222,18,Mon Mar 2 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"Vampires are capable of being in love with someone. What they are not capable of is being able to have a full and healthy relationship like a souled being. Spike was not able as a soulless vampire to comprehend the motivations and perspective a soul gives someone. Not having one caused Spike a lot of confusion in trying to understand what Buffy was going through after she was brought back from the dead.  The love of a vampire has an element of possessiveness to it.  Buffy S5 ""Intervention""   SPIKE: You're mine, Buffy.   Angel S5 ""Destiny""   William: Why did you...? You knew. You knew she was mine.   Spike is not special in his ability to love. There are other vampires who seemed to love their partners like he loved Drusilla and Buffy. An example of this is James from AtS “Heartthrob”, whose relationship was far healthier than Darla and Angel’s.Vampires are not incapable of being selfless. We see Spike willing to die and endure torture to protect Buffy and Dawn while soulless, but he would not be doing those things for a random stranger.   But, as the last couple of seasons have shown, even a vampire without a soul can love Buffy. Spike (James Marsters), a Britpunk vampire introduced as a villain in season two, has also fallen for the Slayer. Prevented from killing by an experimental microchip in his brain, he not only has been a fool for Buffy's love, but has shown definite inclinations toward doing good for its own sake.  So, that begs the question, what is the role of the soul in the Buffy-verse, if one can love and do good without one? Says Whedon, also from March 2001, ""A soul is the thing that separates a human from a demon. It's the thing that points you north instead of south, that makes your instinct to do good instead of to do bad.""   ""Therefore a vampire can feel love. They can have all the whims and quandaries of a normal person, if they're a vampire or a demon, but their basic instinct is to create chaos and evil and destruction, instead of love and bonding and nurturing and stuff. That's the basic difference.""   ""A lot of demons, like Spike, for example, are not that different from a lot of people we know. It's not cut-and-dried. He is capable of great love, but great love is usually a very selfish thing, but he's trying.""   David Greenwalt partnered with Whedon on ""Buffy,” and now is the show-runner and executive producer of ""Angel."" From Aug. 2001, he says, ""Are we human because we have a soul, or do we become human and therefore gain a soul? Certainly there are people in the world without souls.""   ""Angel's soul is based on the fact that he must feel guilt and pain and sorrow for all he's done. The Slayer had an incredible effect on Angel. Angel saw her and wanted to be a better person, seeing her, and he'd had a soul for 100 years at that point.""   ""Same thing, Spike, to his incredible horror, has fallen in love with the Slayer and wants the best for her. To me, he's become a little bit human because of that.""   https://web.archive.org/web/20011118210557/http://tv.zap2it.com/sciencefiction/otherworlds.html?20561"
buffy,2xm3bi,AngelAmongUs,3,Mon Mar 2 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for this. I had never read that article before, it's very enlightening!  I think you're right, Spike assumed that Buffy was somehow like him after returning from the grave - they were both ""dead things"", which to his mind created a bond between them.   SPIKE: Look at them. That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.    But as you say, without a soul, he was never able to grasp what Buffy was going through emotionally and, of course, he manipulated her deep depression to his own advantage, as a way to get closer to her. They were both using and abusing each other - it definitely wasn't a hearts-and-flowers type deal.  I had forgotten all about James from AtS... really good point!  I like this quote from James Marsters in the article you linked to: ""You don't sit back on the couch watching 'Buffy,' you have to sit forward and think about it."" Which is one of the many reasons I love the show so much."
buffy,2xm3bi,excultist,9,Tue Mar 3 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"The scene you refer to, in which Spike has decided to kill Buffy with a shotgun and suffer whatever pain his chip inflicts, but when he sees how unhappy she is, offers her sympathy instead, is very interesting.  To me it shows that he is capable of compassion.  Why should he be compassionate toward Buffy when he usually acts with complete ruthlessness?  I would say that he respects her as a worthy adversary, because she has defeated him on several occasions.  She has been a worthy ally as well, because she & Spike worked together to prevent Angelus from destroying the world, in the season 2 finale.  He can no longer regard her as just a meaningless person, part of the vast, interchangeable mass of humanity.  But was it love?  Yes, of a sort.  Also I think that if you look closer you can find lots of vampires who have distinctive personality traits that they have retained from their previous human existence.  In the sequence involving the Judge (season 2) Spike has a member of his gang who is a studious, scholarly vampire who wears glasses, and is eventually killed by the Judge for being tainted with humanity.  In season 7 Buffy meets a vampire whom she used to know in his previous human existence and they have a sort-of friendly conversation while maneuvering to kill each other; clearly his personality is intact, except for having become evil.  Of course, in most cases, the only thing we ever see a given vampire do is fight and die.  We don't get to know them.  But that doesn't mean that they don't have personalities, it just means that we did not have the opportunity to learn about their personalities.  Love would not mean the same thing to a vampire that it does to a human, anyway.  Humans who are in love can aspire to get married, live together, possibly have children, and share their lives.  Vampires mostly share the pursuit of evil, the murder of humans.  But still, they can love in their own way.  Spike was the most romantic of the vampires, other than Angel, who was made more romantic by having a soul."
buffy,2xm3bi,excultist,3,Mon Mar 2 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"This is true, most of the vampires on the show are of the ""wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am"" variety. (I remember the bespectacled perma-vampface guy... on a completely tangential note, I always used to wonder what was up with vampfacing. Is it a conscious decision on the vampire's part, or is it reflexive, like when they get angry or bloodthirsty the vampface just pops out?) I'm basing my understanding of what happens when a vampire is sired pretty heavily on Angel/Angelus, which isn't really fair because Angelus is, like, super-extra-evil - fancy evil with raisins in it! - but there's no reason to think that all vampires are exactly the same way.  I don't think Spike had a happily-ever-after in mind with Buffy - he never expressed the slightest inclination to turn her and make her a vampire (which is odd, thinking about it... then again, he seemed to get off on the fact that she was the Slayer, so maybe it would've ruined the fantasy?), but he must have known that even if she returned his love, it wouldn't last. I guess soulless Spike wasn't capable of looking towards the future, because for him, there wasn't really a future... just more of the same. He never ages or changes, but Buffy would, and I don't think that ever actually entered his head."
buffy,2xm3bi,AngelAmongUs,5,Tue Mar 3 05:58:27 2015 UTC,"My impression is that the demonic face of a vampire is equivalent to a facial expression.  People may express a negative emotion by frowning; vampires just have a more extreme kind of frown.  Also, if they actually want to bite someone, the teeth get longer, so the demonic face has a functional aspect.  When Xander casts the ill-fated love spell affecting the female population of Sunnydale, even Drusilla falls in love with him, temporarily until the spell is lifted, and her reaction is to want to make him into a vampire, which is perfectly logical.  That is what a vampire would want to do to someone that they love.  From the vampire's point of view, it is the gift of eternal life (even though in Sunnydale, the mortality rate among vampires is extremely high, so eternal life is not all that it's cracked up to be).  So in that sense it is interesting that Spike never tried to make Buffy into a vampire.  In some way he did love her for being the Slayer, but even beyond that, I think he recognized that she was already the person she needed to be, and that making her into a vampire would not be an improvement.  It is also interesting that Buffy briefly was a vampire, during the nightmare episode in season 1, and even then carried out her responsibilities as the guardian of Sunnydale, and ended the nightmare.  But of course, Spike hadn't even arrived in Sunnydale at that time."
buffy,2xm3bi,excultist,3,Tue Mar 3 10:22:02 2015 UTC,"I think he recognized that she was already the person she needed to be, and that making her into a vampire would not be an improvement.     Life's not a song  Life isn't bliss  Life is just this  It's living  You'll get along  The pain that you feel  You only can heal  By living  You have to go on living  So one of us is living"
buffy,2xm3bi,ModerateBias,4,Tue Mar 3 11:00:39 2015 UTC,Certainly a relevant quote.  It suggests that Spike knows that it is better to be a living person than an undead vampire.
buffy,2xm3bi,Dog-boy,5,Tue Mar 3 11:01:52 2015 UTC,"The question of whether they can is answered two times very clearly...  The first time, is the Judge, who says he smells the human emotion on them, but they (spike and dru) convince him to leave them be since they are the ones who brought him back.  The second comes from Dru's mouth.   In season 5 ""Crush""   When dru and buffy are both chained, dur says she knew he loved her before he did...  but further and more specific.  buffy says  ""whatever you think you're feeling its not love, you can't love without a soul""  Dru answered  ""oh, we can, you know.  We can love quite well, if not wisely""  The whole scene shows his true deep love for dru, and his attempt to show he loves buffy more.  The problem isn't his ability to love, its his ability to have it be a non selfish emotion."
buffy,2xm3bi,nwbradsher,4,Mon Mar 2 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"Like you, I think Spike's relationship with Drusilla shows he has the capacity to love, in some way, prior to regaining his soul. He is generally protective and caring of her. I'm too tired to say much else other than I agree with much of what you and the other two posters have said."
buffy,2xm3bi,AngelAmongUs,5,Mon Mar 2 06:23:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to get into it, because this topic always aggravates the community but my opinion is that they can, but there is no reason why they should.   Buffy-verse has really great rules for vampires in the first four seasons. They are portrayed as animalistic, like the ones Buffy can just dust on patrol, or incredibly evil and devious, like Angelus, Darla, the Master, I think you can even grandfather Dracula into that category. Dru is an anomalous insane character, so just count her out. Season 2 really puts the emphasis on the concept Giles puts into practice in the first episode of the show: when you see a vampire, you're not looking at your friend, you're looking at the thing that ate them. Vamps maintain knowledge and in some cases personality, but they're demons in a human suit.   When you enter the fifth season, you start to bend the rules with Spike. He doesn't become a full hero, but he does care about the Summers family. There's no questioning that he's protective of them and that he does care. Whether is motives are pure? No, not entirely. But the affection is there, and it's very human affection. Master has it with Darla, Dru and Spike have it. But is it love? Only retroactively.  Spike was set on a path to loving Buffy during Season 5, in my opinion because they thought they were cancelled and that they wouldn't have to deal with the well set rules anymore. When the writers began to break the vampire rules that defined the first four years of the show, anything became possible. If you had asked me if it was possible during seasons 1-4, or if Dru and Spike loved each other, I would say that it's a love of the mind and not a true, Buffy-Angel love of the soul. But because of the massive rule changes as a result of Buffy and Spike's affair, I think they can have equally valid love. But there's no reason they should logically."
buffy,2xm3bi,nwbradsher,7,Mon Mar 2 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"when you see a vampire, you're not looking at your friend, you're looking at the thing that ate them.    That is conditioning, if slayers were taught differently they would not be effective warriors.  Buffy says this to Ford in Season 2 during a heated conversation, ""You die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house, and it walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but it's not you."" Slayers and the watchers council, just like soldiers in a war, often dehumanize the enemy to process what they do. This is contrary to what Angel himself (and he would know) told Buffy in the season 1 episode “Angel” which is that he is a vampire with a conscience. Buffy saying this to Ford showed her mindset of what the vampires she slays are, not what they actually are.   in my opinion because they thought they were cancelled and that they wouldn't have to deal with the well set rules anymore.   They were not cancelled. Buffy was always going to die at the end of season five. The move to the UPN was about money.  The rules were not changed for Spike. His going to get a soul is not out of the realm of possibility for him. He was repeatedly told he wasn’t good enough because he did not have one. That is a motivating force. His thinking he is in love with someone becomes a loadstone; he pedestalizes them and who that person is impacts his behavior and motivations. He is literally a “Fool for Love”. How Angel behaves when soulless is not indicative of how any other vampire will behave. You can no more compare Angel and Spike; than you can Spike and Harmony."
buffy,2xm3bi,AngelAmongUs,3,Mon Mar 2 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"As I said, a point of great contention. My point is that they can love, I just don't appreciate how it came about in service to Spike."

buffy,2xm3bi,waitressinthesky,3,Sat Mar 7 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"I think that they can, just to varying degrees.  Spike can easily love Buffy without a soul, because his morality/soul doesn't take precedence when he has one, so take it away and he's still the same Spike, just more selfish and without remorse: the only reason he really didn't kill the Scoobies was because of the chip, and he only helped out to impress (later just help) Buffy.  Angel, on the other hand, now relies so much on his morality and soul that take that away and all that's left if Angelus.  If you look at pre-vamp Angel, you can see that he's actually quite like Angelus (not quite as evil).  Basically, they can still love, it's just that their soul changes how they show and feel it:  Spike loved Buffy, but the way he loved her changed after he regained his soul.  TBH, I think the big question is more if Buffy actually loved Spike."
buffy,2xm3bi,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"I like this interpretation a lot - Spike loves Buffy, but selfishly and in a very possessive, short-sighted and strangely naive way. It wasn't until he got his soul back that he was able to let go of Buffy and love her as a human being, actually putting her happiness before his own.  And you're absolutely right, the question of whether Buffy ever loved Spike is a whole 'nother can of worms..."
buffy,2xm3bi,DaddyCatALSO,2,Tue Mar 3 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm the only person who thinks she did -- guys like Riley were never going to be enough for her. I don't blame her for keeping her guard up, but I think she did love him, in her own Buffy way."
buffy,2xm3bi,catdoctor,5,Fri Mar 6 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"My opinion is this:  Spike pre-Vampire was a failed poet obsessed with a girl named Cecile.  Spike then was sired by Drusilla and he became obsessed with her.  Drusilla dumped him and his obsession transferred to Buffy.  This demonstrates Joss Whedon's original vision of the Vampire being unable to grow emotionally as well as physically.  They are literally stuck as the immature people that they were when they were sired.  Spike without a soul in incapable of true love, only the darker aspects of love, the obsession, the lust and physical passion.   It was until Spike was ensouled that he was finally able to realize that Buffy didn't really love him, which is a complete circle for Spike finally being able to exist without an obsession over the people he loves.  That was my interpretation."

buffy,2xemfe,AngelAmongUs,16,Sat Feb 28 09:26:28 2015 UTC,"It didn't really hit me until the flashback when Angel was watching - what, 15-year-old? 14-year-old? Buffy at her previous middle school. Falling in love with her then and there had a definite Humbert Humbert vibe.  Does Buffy get special status for being an old soul or at least being one of an ancient line of souls? I'm not sure.  Maybe there's something to be said for the fact that Angel has been trying to get it right for a hundred years and this is the first time he sees someone who can understand what he is, stop him if something goes wrong, but sympathize as no demon or vampire could with being something better."
buffy,2xemfe,bright_ephemera,10,Sat Feb 28 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that scene was really what pushed it over the edge into creepy for me. And not just because she was so young, but because he didn't actually know her at all. He basically decided he was in love with the idea of her. In real life that's a recipe for a seriously fucked up and potentially abusive relationship. Add in the fact that she was obviously very immature and young at that point and what was apparently supposed to indicate some kind of predestined, undying love just felt really, really creepy."

buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,18,Sat Feb 28 00:47:29 2015 UTC,"I always did find the relationship to be odd, and not just for the reason you state, of the extreme age difference.  I do not really believe that the kind of tender, romantic feelings that Angel has would still be possible in someone who is 241 years old.  I am a mere 62 years old myself, and I know that my emotional state is not what it was when I was a teenager.  Age changes you, at least in some respects.  And it is a progressive process.  If I live to be 100 years old (which is medically possible in theory, although the odds are against it) I would expect to be a different person from my current 62 year old self, and were I to live to be 200 years old (which is not medically possible with current technology) I would expect to be even more different.  Angel has a strangely innocent quality for such an ancient being.  The only justification I can offer for this extreme case of a May-December romance is that Buffy is unique, as the Chosen One, and anybody she gets involved with is drawn into her world, and will have to deal with vampires and monsters, one way or another, as Xander and Willow and Oz and Riley and Giles and Anya (who is a special case as an ex-demon herself) and everybody else in her social orbit do.  This is not fair to inflict on normal people and it tends not to work out well (and even Xander, who comes closest to being a normal person out of Buffy's group, does eventually lose an eye, in season 7).  So it is in a sense more reasonable for Buffy to become involved with someone such as Angel or Riley who are already involved in the world of supernatural conflict.  But then, the relationship of Buffy and Angel runs into that terrible Gypsy curse, so it isn't reasonable after all, which even Angel himself can see.  Riley was more appropriate despite all the problems that he ran into, but alas, Buffy drove him away, and he wound up marrying someone else."
buffy,2xemfe,excultist,3,Sat Feb 28 03:46:31 2015 UTC,"anyone she gets involved with is drawn into her world ... This is not fair to inflict on normal people and tends not to work out well.   I agree. I'd also say that it's not just the people that Buffy gets involved with; really, this theme tends to come up when any of them get involved with someone.   Giles's relationship with Olivia ends fairly abruptly when she lives through the Gentlemen coming to Sunnydale and then realized that Giles wasn't joking about all the supernatural things he deals with all the time.   I'd also say that both Tara and Jenny Calendar are somewhat involved or aware of supernatural forces, but they're not actively involved in the fight against evil until they align themselves with the Scooby gang because of a love interest. Jenny is frightened off for a while not just by Giles's dark past, but also because being around him means that bad things will happen. And it's the fact that she's actively trying to re-ensoul Angelus that gets her killed.  Tara is never frightened off, but she suffers a great deal because of her proximity to Willow and the gang, and eventually that's also what gets her killed.  The woman in ""Beneath You"" who flirts with Xander also leaves, thinking that they're all ""freaks"" - which I always thought was amusing, because the bad things that happen to her are in no way his fault. But even though a relatively normal person in Sunnydale who has any idea of what's actually going on should expect a certain amount of danger just by living there, many people (like Jenny), explicitly make the connection between ""danger"" and ""getting involved with the Scooby gang."""

buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Mar 1 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"I always felt that Angel's age doesn't really correlate with his emotional maturity. Only rarely he feels like the ancient being that he is. Maybe living as a vampire doesn't really give one the emotional progress that comes with aging? He doesn't go through the same things that usually make a human mature, at least not in the same way (usually people watch their parents die, not kill them...). In that way I don't really find the relationship creepy or weird; he hasn't really grown older in his vampire years, only in his years of having a soul. I don't have anything from the show to back this up on, so I might be a bit off."
buffy,2xemfe,Grutsov,4,Sat Feb 28 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"I would accept that age does not have the same effect on the personality of an ancient vampire, that it has on the personality of an old person.  But it must have an effect.  When you have seen the way human beings have behaved over a period of centuries, you are going to become very familiar with human behavior.  Even I at the tender age of 62 am rather jaded about a lot of things, because I have seen them before, so many times.  And for Angel to fall in love with Buffy in pretty much the way a teenager might have, strikes me as odd.  Still, it's a great story, very poignant.  I sympathize with them, thwarted as they are by a Gypsy curse.  They might have been so happy together."
buffy,2xemfe,excultist,2,Sat Feb 28 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"Mentally, Angel isn't 241, he's just being 26 for the 11 th time."
buffy,2xemfe,DaddyCatALSO,5,Sat Feb 28 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I think that is true.  He has the psychology of a man in his twenties who has a taste for drinking blood.  I think that this is just convenient for plot purposes, rather than being a logical outcome of Angel's life."

buffy,2xemfe,A40,6,Sat Feb 28 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I found it odd too. Not so much for the age difference, more that on Angel's part, it was essentially a less murder-y version of his obsession with Dru back when he was Angelus. The whole relationship started because she caught him following her from the shadows.  I'll always back the Buffy/Angel relationship as Buffy's best, just because of how they were once they'd gone beyond the initial stalking courting period, even if I don't necessarily get how/why they got to that point.  Really, I'm all about Angel/Cordy tbh. I feel like everything wrong with Buffy/Angel was done right with Angel/Cordy."

buffy,2xemfe,johnluckpickerd,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree, necessarily, but I find that storyline a lot less problematic because even in the show it was acknowledged that the relationship was fairly creepy. There's creepy music that plays a couple of times when Cordelia/Jasmine is talking to Connor, and everyone around them is seriously disturbed by the idea of the two of them together. So the relationship may be creepy, but at least it's an acknowledged kind of creepiness.   I think part of the reason some people find Angel/Buffy to be creepy is that the potentially disturbing aspects of it aren't really acknowledged much on the show. The romance and the poignancy are what's emphasized more than anything else."
buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Mar 3 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason some people find Angel/Buffy to be creepy is that the potentially disturbing aspects of it aren't really acknowledged much on the show.   I feel like all the creepiness in the beginning was just a buildup for Angel becoming more overtly abusive when he lost his soul.  Abusive relationships are often enchanting in the beginning, but then devolve into something nasty.  Granted they backtracked on that a little in Season 3, but Buffy and Angel never really got back together again after that."
buffy,2xemfe,KiraKira_,2,Wed Mar 4 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting way to look at it. I kind of agree.  I think I meant that we really see Angel through the eyes of Buffy in seasons 1 and 2. To her, he was not abusive (before he lost his soul), so it doesn't really come across that way.   And as /u/AngelAmongUs pointed out, Angel does go through a lot of personal growth after he comes back from the hell dimension :) but yes, certainly their relationship is never the same."
buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Mar 4 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"In Angel's defense, he would have pretty much the same problem dating any human. The only way he could overcome the age barrier would be by sticking to his own kind. And since they're all (mostly) soul-less demons, he'd have a hard time finding anyone with shared interests. I think Angel deserves a little (but not too much) happiness in his life so he has to make due with humans. Reminds me of a dialogue exchange he had with Wesley in Season 5 of Angel about werewolf Nina:   Angel: Nina's down there right now, turning into a werewolf and liking me. I don't—can't— I have no time for that kind of— I have no right. I mean, look, we all know what happens if—  Wesley: If what? If you achieve a moment of perfect happiness?  Angel: I turn back into Angelus, and we don't want that. What?  Wesley: 99.999-ad infinitum percent of the best relationships in the recorded history of the world have had to make do with acceptable happiness.  Angel: Look, Wes—  Wesley: Hiding behind your gypsy curse when there's a beautiful, engaging—all right, occasionally hirsute—young woman who actually wants you?  Angel: Wes, it's not gonna happen.  Wesley: Why?  Angel: Because I'm not that guy. That guy is charming and funny and... emotionally useful. I'm the guy in a dark corner with the blood habit and the 200 years of psychic baggage.  Wesley: Get over it!  Angel: Why are you yelling at me?  Wesley: Because! Angel, if there's a woman out there, who you find truly attractive, who you think about, let's say, most of the time, who represents even part of what you think makes the world worth fighting for, and who doesn't view you as an entirely sexless shoulder to lean on, you have to do something about it.   Angel might be dead, but he's not dead. He's gotta get out there like the rest of us."

buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"the Willow-Kennedy relationship   I agree. In fact, in the entire Buffyverse, this might be the relationship I find the most disturbing, somehow. Even Cordelia and Connor were supposed to be creepy.   They made a point, in Angel season 4, of mentioning Connor's age (18) twice immediately before they hook up. I still think it's weird they didn't do something similar for Kennedy. In the script, it says that she's 19, but she comes off as Dawn's peer, and other than some vague references to her thinking she might be too old to be a Slayer, her age is never mentioned on the show.  I think what bothers me most is that Kennedy acts like a kid, brazen and bold but naive, and Willow at that point has been through so much that there seems to be a huge gap between them in terms of maturity and life experience. It bugs me :) I get that Kennedy was not supposed to be a long-term partner for Willow, but their relationship still seems a little forced and odd.  Edit: The fact that they keep mentioning Connor's age is even more interesting because I don't think there's any way they could have known it. :)"

buffy,2xemfe,Sammyboy616,1 point,Sun Mar 1 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't find it creepy.  It's been mentioned in interviews and analysis that vampires (especially in season 1) were sort of stuck in a perpetual immaturity;  they never really act as if they're anything older than 30 (apart from the master), sort of showing how lack of soul stops them from ageing mentally.  To me it always seemed like Angel kind of just moped around in limbo for a hundred or so years after getting back his soul.  When he meets Buffy, he seems to act closer to 26 than 200, at least until during Angel.  I also think it helps that the creepiness/unworkableness of it is acknowledged by both of them around season 3."
buffy,2xemfe,wphayduke,-1,Mon Mar 2 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"I have to say Buffy was no creepier than other relationships-with-vampires romantic plots (and with much snappier dialog). Think of the biology of the relationship: First they're dead and cold (regardless of how old they are), almost necessarily they smell awful, they have no breath - or only breath which stench would knock you out. The minimum psychology is that they're serial killers. But there's this suspension-of-disbelief because they're cute [well, Angel, Darla, Anya (demon, admittedly, but, again) - cute]. Women say men think with the wrong body parts, but so do women - with a bit more emphasis on status (men, own up, it's fair to say you're walking libidos with attached insecurities). Ladies, I'm a guy so I can't speak for you - but I don't see a lot of room to be smug.. Falling for dead (cute) serial killers, sure, why not? [To quote Giles: 'We're doomed.']"

buffy,2xemfe,faaackksake,-9,Sat Feb 28 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"of course it's been discussed just not often, because it's such a cliche and boring topic to go over. whatever, you could add this complaint on to pretty much every single piece of vampire fiction with romance involved. If i need to explain to you why their relationship isn't 'creepy' then i think you misunderstood a lot of the series and fundamentally misunderstood the characters of Buffy and Angel."
buffy,2xemfe,GinaZaneburritos,11,Sat Feb 28 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"if I need to explain to you why their relationship isn't 'creepy' then I think you misunderstood a lot of the series and fundamentally misunderstood the characters of Buffy and Angel.   That's a little harsh. To be honest, the age difference between Buffy and Angel doesn't bother me all that much, but I can absolutely see why it would bother others.   First of all, because she's 15 or 16 when he first sees her, and for most of their relationship (until ""Helpless"" in season 3) she's legally a minor. I don't think she was below the legal age of consent when they had sex, but the fact that she's so young is certainly something that gives a lot of people pause.   There's also the idea - that is brought up in the show, as it is in most romantic vampire stories (that I'm aware of) - that a relationship with a vampire is probably not the healthiest or ""best"" relationship she could be in. Being with someone hundreds of years older than you is not exactly normal, especially when you're 16 or 17. If someone found that in itself ""creepy,"" I don't think I could really disagree.   Even Buffy finds her love for Angel disturbing: she knows she ""shouldn't"" love him, ""tries to stop"" and ""can't."" Some people in the show (like Giles) find it ""poetic""; others, like Xander or her mom, find it decidedly less so.  What's really compelling to me about Buffy and Angel's relationship is the very deep emotions that both of them feel. Regardless of whether someone finds it ""creepy"" or romantic, the way Buffy feels is both understandable and moving. If someone doesn't like them together, it doesn't mean they've misunderstood the series or the characters at all. It's a matter of opinion."

buffy,2xc5s8,AngelAmongUs,3,Fri Feb 27 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"Other possible alternate castings include; Nathan Fillion who tried out for both Spike and Angel.    Nathan Fillion did not try out for Spike, only Angel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NIRRNYphY  Ryan Reynolds addressing turning down Buffy the Vampire Slayer:   Returning to Vancouver, he found parts in obscure television movies. At one point, he rejected an offered role in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. ""I love that show and I loved Joss Whedon, the creator of the show, but my biggest concern was that I didn't want to play a guy in high school,"" Reynolds says. ""I had just come out of high school and it was f------ awful."" (He was tormented by bullies.)   ""7. James Marsters, who played Spike, isn’t actually British - he’s from California and performed his audition with a Texan accent. ""   What was the audition process like for Buffy? (2-99 Starburst) I came in and auditioned once and they liked what I did. They tried me in a Southern accent and then an English accent. I did a Louisiana accent for them, but it was a more sexy sort of thing. Drusilla was already cast. They had wanted her from the very beginning. I never met her before. We shook hands walking into the audition and just leapt into it. For some reason we clicked. There was an automatic trust. I think we just recognized that we were two actors that could learn to trust each other and I gave the audition of my life. The shot where we kind of kiss and turn foreheads that we have used a number of times, that was just an instinctual thing that we did in the audition. And that was the end of the audition and they just went, 'We love these guys! Originally Joss wanted us to be punk vampires - he wanted a Sid and Nancy. I auditioned with a British accent and a southern accent, which I thought was real sexy. But the British is dangerous, whereas the Southern was a little slow. When I got the audition, I was playing a role in The Tempest at a Shakespeare festival. The man playing Caliban was from North London and as soon as I got the audition I called him and said, 'Do a couple of these lines for me please.' And he did. I owe him a lot of money, I suppose!   ""9. Season 5 was to feature two famous guest stars, but scheduling conflicts got in the way of both of them. Firstly, Freddie Prinze Jr (Sarah Michelle Gellar's future husband) was originally set to play Dracula in the season  opener Buffy vs Dracula. Then, Britney Spears was set to play dream girl robot April in the episode I Was Made To Love You, as Joss Whedon revealed:""  Full quote:   Well, she wasn't, but they told us she might. And they said, ""Britney wants to do the show!"" They always do. ""Samuel L Jackson wants to do the show!"", we got that one one time too. Eventually I just stopped believing it. So we did hear there was a possibility Britney wanted to do the show. We had never seen her act at all, so I said, ""Well, we'll cover our bases. We'll write a show about a robot! And that way if she can't, we're fine."" And then Shonda Farr came in and did a wonderful job. And the creation of Warren the villain, the Buffybot; it all came from the fact that we thought Britney Spears was going to be on the show. So, happy accidents.   About Freddie Prinze Jr., does anyone have an official confirmation?  The only episode he has ever seen was the musical."

Wonder how different it all would be if that hadn't happened. Or, once Charisma was picked, if Joss had decided to give Cordy a Spanish last name.  Actually, Fox suggested it a s a Power-Rangers style daytime show at one time. In that case, Mercedes would've been the best choice.

I've watched all of Buffy many (many, many) times over the years, but I don't think I've ever actually sat down and rewatched the show in its entirety - like, from beginning to end, not skipping any episodes. I tend to just rewatch seasons in random order, depending on my mood. I've probably watched seasons two and five the most frequently, since they're my personal favourites, and seasons one and seven, not so much.   Certain episodes, I almost always skip whilst rewatching. Beer Bad and Empty Places spring readily to mind... And then some of them I find too upsetting to rewatch, like Wild at Heart, which destroys me emotionally because it hits a little too close to home.  I also rewatch Pangs every Thanksgiving... it's tradition!"
buffy,2xa1na,Mollywobbles222,6,Fri Feb 27 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of mini-festivals!   Yeah, I thought it was interesting, too :) I edited my post above to credit the article and author who brought this idea to my attention.  She also mentioned something she called ""The-Conveniently-Located-Axe"" festival (sorry, not sure which episodes that would include - although I can guess ;), a ""Tragic Buffy"" festival, and ""A Very Special Buffy"" festival (where ""some kind of heart- (or rather stomach-) wrenching problem comes up and is dealt with and we learn a lesson"").  ""Tragic Buffy"" includes: ""Prophecy Girl,"" ""Innocence,"" ""I Only Have Eyes for You,"" ""The Prom,"" ""The Body,"" ""Seeing Red,"" and ""The Gift.""  ""A Very Special Buffy"" includes: ""Killed by Death,"" ""Beauty and the Beasts,"" ""Wrecked,"" and ""Help.""  I also liked the idea of the ""Actually, They're All Stupid"" festival, described as the ""handful of episodes where the Scoobies seem to have collectively or individually lost all claim to even the intelligence of a gnat."" Often (but not always) because of a spell.   Of course, you can always make your own :)"
buffy,2xa1na,AngryWizard,2,Fri Feb 27 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"Ha! Thanks, these are great. I'm a sucker for angst, so I'm leaning towards the ""Tragic Buffy"" one...

buffy,2xa1na,executioncommentary,2,Sat Feb 28 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"Haha, glad you like it!  The author didn't give too many clues as to what episodes she thinks fall into ""Actually, They're All Stupid,"" but I think you've got the hang of it :)  She did mention ""Inca Mummy Girl,"" and described it like this:   The plot holes are big enough to drive an eighteen-wheeler through. The South American exchange student is staying for two weeks with the biggest trunk you ever saw - conveniently big enough to stash a body in. Everyone keeps doing things for plot reasons. There's dead time. When Xander picks up the Incan mummy girl from Buffy's place there's an endless, pointless filler conversation between them and Joyce and Buffy. It's like watching As the World Turns. The dialogue between the Scoobies is awful: ""Do we have to speak Spanish?"" asks Xander. ""Cause I don't know much besides 'Doritos' and 'Chihuahua.'""   She also mentions ""Triangle"" for this festival, especially because ""Buffy spends most of [it] crying in an unconvincing, vaudevillian, over-the-top way.""  I actually find ""Triangle"" and the ""they have a miraculous love"" line that she sobs into Tara's shoulder to be pretty funny :) But I did think that the Incan mummy girl had an awfully large trunk. Especially since she had to ask to borrow lipstick. What did they think she packed?"
buffy,2xa1na,zbobby1990,6,Sat Feb 28 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"I watched the series all the way through while focusing my attention on the stunt doubles. I can now pick Buffy's doubles, Michele and Sophia, out in a split second by posture/stance alone. I also watched all of Jeff Pruitt's behind the scenes stunt film on youtube so Sophia especially is super familiar to me. It was a fun way to watch the show but I'll warn you, it took me a couple more rewatches afterwards to let it go and stop focusing on the stunt-people. Now its more of a subconscious awareness that doesn't tear me out of the moment as frequently, except when it's blatantly bad like the lunch lady attack or Buffy running with Dawn in her arms - just can't overlook that shit."
buffy,2xa1na,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Feb 27 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"I definitely watch with themes. If I'm in the mood to watch something funny, I'll watch the three funniest episodes, or if I'm in the mood for Spike/Buffy, I'll watch a bunch of Spike/Buffy themed episodes.

buffy,2x6xv7,milewskia2,7,Thu Feb 26 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"I don't like this idea, but I would wager that it gets rebooted in some form in the next decade. Like what happened with Star Trek, new fans will rush in, the old fans will hate it, and the old versions of the original will wind down. Best reboot case scenario though is a seamless transition using current characters from the comics. That would be so nice to see."
buffy,2x6xv7,DaddyCatALSO,9,Thu Feb 26 09:26:43 2015 UTC,"A reboot that distills their personality into what the producers think the general public will like:   So, Giles will be Eggs Benedict Cucumber-pants. He will have none of the humor or warmth, except maybe at the end.   Willow's nerd complex will be played up, and she will become computer hacker god 5000 (not that she already wasn't) of course, there'll be that product placement shot of her on her computer. If they decide to go into her sexuality it will be ham fisted social commentary or blatant sexual indulgence.    Angel will be whatever beefcake they can get. Xander will be played by whatever snl person they can get. Cordy will just be whatever no name actress they can get and she won't be played up, Harm's name might be mentioned as a wink to the fans. As far as villians, none of them seem to permeate pop culture the way Khan did such as in Into Darkness, but maybe the'll include Spike in Dru in the movie sequel.   Throwing Dawn into earlier story lines would be interesting to see, so they probably won't do that. Also prepare for the 45 minute action scene where the vampire legion destroy the city  and buffy and the scoobies, now all expert fighters (like expert/ karate slayer level fighters) take them down... And  oh no Joyce died (from the vampire attack) but she was only in two scenes, so its not that important.   Oh and then there's Buffy. I'm not sure who the Andrew Garfield for Buffy would be, but they'd be sure to cast her. You know, that actress who gets every motivation wrong, who comes across like an asshole when she's trying to be cocky and not so bright when she's trying to be intelligent.   Yeah, remakes."

Their son was heir to the House of Bruce and later inherited the Scottish throne. The name Stewart derived from the position of High Stewart/Steward held by his father's family.  Edit: duplicate sentence."
buffy,2x1yi3,AngelAmongUs,10,Wed Feb 25 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that both Angel and Buffy (and other Whedon shows) are - in large part - about people struggling to do the right thing in a world of realistically imperfect information. Many of the central conflicts revolve around the consequences of acting under false belief and the best reaction to one's mistakes.  From Buffy:   Willow, Xander, Anya, and Tara raising Buffy from the dead believing her to be in hell. Xander believing he would end up like his father if he married Anya. Jenny Calendar believing that Angel should be kept away from Buffy, but also that his actions had redeemed him. Faith believing that the man in the alley was another vampire just like the ones she and Buffy had just slain. Giles and Principal Wood believing that Spike was a threat, an ""instrument of evil"" who should be put down for the ""greater good.""   Sometimes the beliefs are reasonable or on good authority, and sometimes not. Sometimes the problem is that characters (also realistically) fail to consider other options, or jump too quickly to what they feel to be true.  It is very realistic. And ""durable,"" for a television show especially. :)"
buffy,2x1yi3,GinaZaneburritos,6,Wed Feb 25 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"As much as I adore Spike, I have to side with Giles and Wood on their conclusion. Spike was a vampire who had recently been shown to be under the control of The First. It would take a very trusting person to just ""feel"" that he is not going to be a threat."
buffy,2x1yi3,catdoctor,7,Wed Feb 25 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"True. It was a very reasonable, practical decision. It made a lot of sense, given everything they knew at the time. Which is why Buffy had such trouble justifying her treatment of Spike all throughout the seventh season.  And maybe Angel could have worn the amulet and therefore saved the world. But there's no denying that if Giles and Wood had killed Spike, the forces of Good would have lost a champion. The First was all for killing Spike, once it was convinced it couldn't make him choose evil.  Edit: There's also a theme running through the Buffyverse that keeping secrets from people is a bad idea. Usually or especially to protect them. Giles couldn't convince Buffy that Spike was an unacceptable risk, so he lured her away from Spike so Wood could go after him. Whether or not he was right in his assessment of Spike, that was a bad move :)  There are tons of examples of this in Angel. When Cordelia loses her memories, Angel lies to ""protect her"" from unpleasant facts (like that he's actually a vampire), losing her trust. Angel lures Connor away for a few hours so he can go confront Holtz. Wesley thought he was doing the right thing in kidnapping Connor, but he did it all behind everyone's back.   No matter how much sense a decision makes, tricking people to allow you to carry it out is not a good idea in the Buffyverse. To give another example from Buffy: Willow and co. keep the plan to resurrect Buffy from Giles, Dawn, and Spike. Again and again it seems like: if you feel you have to hide, it will probably turn out badly."

buffy,2x1yi3,AngryWizard,3,Wed Feb 25 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that Buffy did not give them a good reason to keep Spike around. As  a potential danger to everyone, he should have stayed chained in the basement. They were lucky the First did not have him killing potentials."

buffy,2x0gjk,Truant_Muse,7,Tue Feb 24 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"Try the Vampire Diaries. The first episode/season is a little slow, but I think it's almost as if Buffy were made in 2009. Then move to the Originals when it makes sense."
buffy,2x0gjk,Desperate4AShagGiles,10,Tue Feb 24 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"wouldn't personally compare it to Buffy in terms of what the show is about, but I do really enjoy the Vampire Diaries. I remember when it came on it looked so silly, but it is actually a much better show than anyone would expect."
buffy,2x0gjk,theevilgiraffe,3,Tue Feb 24 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"It took me awhile to actually watch Vampire Diaries because the commercials for it were terrible. I remember one that played incessantly where Damon was dancing on a balcony thing half naked. While Damon is good looking, I just thought it made the show look kinda silly.   But it's actually pretty enjoyable! I don't like it nearly as much as Buffy, but it's fun to watch."
buffy,2x0gjk,Baseball_dusty,7,Wed Feb 25 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"I like Vampire Diaries a lot too! There are certainly a lot of similarities between the shows. There are a fair number of differences, mainly that the main girl character (Elena) isn't nearly as tough as Buffy is, which is a bit of a disappointment, but I feel like the two guys are similar to Angel and Spike. It certainly doesn't take the place of Buffy, but it's a lot of fun if you can get past the campy first season (just like Buffy)."
buffy,2x0gjk,Truant_Muse,9,Tue Feb 24 22:22:38 2015 UTC,I rather like the vampires in the Parasol Protectorate series (and spinoffs/prequels)  by Gail Carriger.    I call them Downton Buffy
buffy,2x0gjk,clockworklycanthrope,3,Tue Feb 24 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yes! I recently was introduced to them and listened to the whole series on audiobook, which was delightful and I'd highly recommend it.  Carriger does such a great job, she's clever and knows how to both play into and poke fun at the genre."
buffy,2x0gjk,TheBlueDanNoob,3,Tue Feb 24 22:03:04 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. I'll have to check that out!
buffy,2x0gjk,clockworklycanthrope,9,Tue Feb 24 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"It's not the vampires as such that are 'ruined' by BtVS. It's quality of dialogue, romance and characters. I give other vampire shows a try for an episode or two, but always end up thinking one or more of the following words (not all for the same show): ""Corny, dull, puerile, contrived, exploitative, derivative."""
buffy,2x0gjk,clockworklycanthrope,8,Tue Feb 24 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"Buffy is of course my favorite, but I like a lot of other vampire stuff, too. Fantasy and horror are my favorite genres, so I'm bound to run into them pretty often. ""Twilight"" is terrible, but not because of the vampires (more because of the underlying messages that are anti-feminist and depict an abusive relationship as being ideal). That's a whole other discussion, I guess. Here's my take on a few vampire related things and what I like about them.   The Vampire Diaries: Basically, I'm in this one for the characters. Lots of really interesting character development and flashbacks (love a good flashback). You have to be able to look past the fact that the show is really weak on plot to enjoy it. They're better about this at the beginning of the show, but as the seasons wear on, you'll notice that events at the beginning of the seasons seem barely connected to events at the end. It sort of just feels like random events occurring, but the character development is pretty solid, and the show is a lot of fun. I definitely recommend giving it another shot. The Originals: This is TVD's spin-off. Still very character-centric, but the plot is a little more coherent. There are some really great episodes and, again, GREAT, visually interesting flashbacks. True Blood: This show is like popcorn. I've seen all of it, but I can't seem to consistently remember anything past about season three. Basically, it's a good time while you're watching it, but if that isn't enough, then it's not for you. Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles: Honestly, I just really like her writing style. She makes everything seem really beautiful and sumptuous. Totally different kind of vampires than on Buffy (and sometimes WAY overpowered), but good reads in my opinion. 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King: King writes SCARY vampires, and I love it. Totally different than Buffy. Way creepy. Worth your time if you like horror. The Mortal Instruments: These books aren't about vampires per se, but there are vampires in them. The main characters are teen demon hunters. Imagine if BtVS and Harry Potter had a mildly trashy baby. Is it high art? No. But it's damn fun to read, and I practically ripped through them. The first ten books of Laurel K. Hamilton's ""Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter"": This series is very similar to Buffy, at least at first. Badass lady with supernatural powers hunts vampires and solves mysteries. It's pretty awesome. Around book ten, however, the author decided she'd rather be writing supernatural erotica, and the entire focus of the series changes. Don't bother reading any further unless that's your jam. Jim Butcher's ""The Dresden Files"": Another series that's not about vampires, but does contain them. The author is a huge Buffy fan, so there are a lot of references. James Marsters does the audio books. The main character (who the author has admitted to imagining, in an ideal world, as James Marsters) is a wizard for hire who solves supernatural mysteries. Fun, fast reads, with interesting vampires that are VERY different from those in BtVS. Being Human: UK version: Not a fan of the US remake, but this UK show about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf living together is truly stellar, at least for the first three seasons. Great acting, and a plot that leaves you watching through your hands and shouting things at the TV. Do yourself a favor and check it out on Netflix.   Edit: Added one I forgot."
buffy,2x0gjk,clockworklycanthrope,4,Tue Feb 24 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Loved Salem's Lot & Anne Rice upon the first read pre-Whedon. Now I'm not so sure about Anne Rice.   -I couldn't even get through the first Anita Blake book. Her portrayal of my city (St. Louis) bugged me, you can tell she's not native. We have so many more layers than she chooses to peel away. We're much more like New Orleans (corrupt and crumbling) than the mid-western city that she writes about. Maybe it's because I was raised with the Paw Paw French so I tend to notice a lot of French bias in St. Louis' culture.    -I started the Dresden files, liked it, then stopped for some reason. I need to pick them up again.   -I didn't even know Being Human was a remake. Maybe I need to check out the British version."
buffy,2x0gjk,clockworklycanthrope,2,Wed Feb 25 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, see, I've never even visited St. Louis, so that wouldn't bug me. I always find it a little strange when people choose to write extensively about locations they haven't been to.  The original version of Being Human is SO much better. Don't know how you feel about the US version, but I couldn't even get through two episodes after starting with the far superior original show. I had high hopes for the US version because I thought it was going to be a new story that took place in the same fictional reality. As it turns out, it was the same story (at least to start--don't know if it veered off later), but written and acted poorly (in comparison).  I think Anne Rice is fun as long as you don't take her too seriously, you know? Her descriptions and writing style are lovely (in my opinion), and I love the darkness of some of her stories--""The Witching Hour"" is a particular favorite--but it's not high literature. She gets away with a lot of ridiculous things for me because I just like the way she talks about things, if that makes sense. Like, something ridiculous or unbelievable will happen, and I'll know it's ridiculous, but oooh, pretty! ;)"
buffy,2x0gjk,DreamsDeferred,2,Wed Feb 25 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"I did like her witches, I wish they would have made a movie of them. Oh wait, the movies were terrible. Never mind."
buffy,2x0gjk,DreamsDeferred,2,Wed Feb 25 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"SO. TERRIBLE. Also, really weird casting choices! Why'd they cast Tom Cruise as blond Lestat and Brad Pitt as raven-haired Louis? If anything, the roles should've been reversed! Kirsten Dunst as Claudia was acceptable, at least."
buffy,2x0gjk,tydestra,2,Wed Feb 25 01:50:50 2015 UTC,I'm glad I wasn't the only one who hated the casting. I was so mad I refused to see it at the theatre and only watched it at home when a friend insisted. Tom Cruise is a terrible actor & Brad Pitt should have never played Louie. I always pictured Louie more lithe and effete and Lestat darker and much prettier. Stupid Hollywood.
buffy,2x0gjk,howaboutgofuckyrself,2,Wed Feb 25 02:04:17 2015 UTC,Right?! You have to wonder if the casting director even read Anne Rice's descriptions of the characters at all!
buffy,2x0gjk,theevilgiraffe,2,Wed Feb 25 02:20:57 2015 UTC,Regarding TB - did you see the series finale?
buffy,2x0gjk,littlepumpkin,2,Thu Feb 26 11:57:32 2015 UTC,"No. I got through the first season and now my husband watches it with the sound off and the captions on because he can't stand Bill either.   That -let me just crawl out of the muddy ground naked now do me- sex scene at the end of season 1 did it for me for a while. I just looked at my husband and said ""She's going to get dirt in her hooha."" and he fell on the floor laughing.   He's now on season 2 and tells me what's happening like I care."
buffy,2x0gjk,PotatoesMcLaughlin,2,Thu Feb 26 18:02:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for making me laugh! That was so awesome :)
buffy,2x0gjk,fff8e7cosmic,5,Thu Feb 26 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"I came to Buffy because of vampires, so it really hasn't changed my views of them elsewhere. She's another facet of vampire shows; what does annoy me is when people pull Buffy into other shows."
buffy,2x0gjk,DreamsDeferred,7,Tue Feb 24 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, except for Pam from True Blood. She is the baddest bitch."
buffy,2x0gjk,DreamsDeferred,2,Wed Feb 25 01:26:32 2015 UTC,I like Tara and Lafayette. Which means they'll get killed. I always seem to like the supporting characters that die.
buffy,2x0gjk,DaddyCatALSO,5,Thu Feb 26 18:06:40 2015 UTC,I'm finding all this love of the the Originals and the Vampire Diaries very interesting. Maybe they deserve a rewatch.
buffy,2x0gjk,CalixeAthura,3,Tue Feb 24 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the Originals, but it's the spinoff of Vampire Diaries, so I wouldn't start with that one. I definitely recommend giving Vampire Diaries a shot, and trying to stick with it through the first season when they were still trying to figure themselves out. It gets soooo much better.   And True Blood is terrible."
buffy,2x0gjk,keelabee,2,Tue Feb 24 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"When I first started the Originals I thought it was a bit cheesy, but I stuck with it and now I love it! Can't say the same for VD though, personally, but it might be because love triangles annoy the crap out of me, and I also don't appreciate millennial high school characters."
buffy,2x0gjk,BlueSnowOwl,3,Tue Feb 24 22:22:23 2015 UTC,"After the first season, I pretty much only watched True Blood for Eric, Pam and Lafy. Buffy will always be the best vampire show."
buffy,2x0gjk,just_lurking12,3,Wed Feb 25 06:32:16 2015 UTC,"There's only about one vampire, but Cassidy in the Preacher comics is still a large favorite. Doesn't veer to far off from Buffy verse, was about the same time period.   He's basically Irish Spike, but with more alcohol."

buffy,2x0gjk,Kapprika,2,Fri Feb 27 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! The vamps in Buffy are my favorite portrayal of vamps. Tru Blood drives me up the wall. ESPECIALLY because of the placement of their fangs..ugh I cringe anytime someone mentions Tru Blood. I DO like the vampires in Van Helsing, but Buffy vamps will always be my favorite. Also I noticed most people shout out to Lost Boys, to which I give all of you PROPS. Lost Boys is amazing. :)"
buffy,2x0gjk,Rorplup,2,Thu Mar 19 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"I was never into Vampire stuff that much. Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel and True Blood have been the only exceptions.  I actually never watched BTVS for the first time until it was well into Season 6. I would always catch the two-hour blocks of it in the evenings on FX because ""nothing better was on"" then all of the sudden I was obsessed with it.   A former roommate tried to get me into True Blood, and I resisted for a long time, insisting it could never be as good as Buffy. Which, it's not, but I finally caved and gave TB a chance and actually really enjoyed it, up until the last season.   But I've never seen Twilight or Vampire Diaries, or whatever other whacky vamp stuff the kids are into these days, and never intend on it. Nothing about either show(movie, whatever) appeals to me."
buffy,2x0uij,herdofsheep420,16,Tue Feb 24 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"It was the earlier spell they did to uncover the memories he had suppressed that eventually caused him to confront his past.  Spike relived a moment in his history that was painful for him, and realized that with a soul his mother would not have been as cruel to him as she was after she became a vampire. This realization released him from the power the trigger had over him."
buffy,2x0uij,AngelAmongUs,8,Tue Feb 24 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  As Giles says at the beginning of the episode:   [To Spike] The Prokaryote stone will help unlock your subconscious to get to the root of the trigger's power. Help you understand it. Hopefully, break its hold over you ... [To Dawn] The stone's only a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike. He needs to overcome whatever mental weakness is allowing his mind to be manipulated in this way.   When the stone slithers its way into Spike's brain, he experiences a suppressed memory of his mom singing the trigger song ""Early One Morning"" to him.  After the stone comes out, he continues to ""work his way"" through the memories and experiences another ""flashback"" while still chained in the basement, this time of returning home as a recently-turned vampire.  He's still not de-triggered. As Giles says:   The process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding into his consciousness, and as long as he does so, we're in danger.   Principal Wood activated the trigger in his cross-filled ""sanctuary"" and in his fight to avenge his mother's death helped Spike work through the final memory of his mother-as-vampire and understand what it meant. The stone was the catalyst, though, to eliminating this ""mental weakness"" of his that the First was exploiting."
buffy,2x0uij,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Feb 25 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe in an off-camera part of the fight, they were both doing a lot of ""your-mom"" type trash talk. And the childishness of it put things into perspective. :)"
buffy,2x0uij,TheBlueDanNoob,2,Wed Feb 25 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"Spike discovers something about himself and in doing so discovers the truth about his mother. Spike as we know has a soul now and he's being punished by Wood for killing his mother (as he has been punishing himself for all the reprehensible things he's done). But Spike realises that he did what he did to Wood's mother because he didn't have a soul. ""I don't give a piss about your mum. She was a slayer, I was a vampire. That's how the game's played"". He similarly realises this about his mother. She was horrible to William because she didn't have a soul: ""That was the demon talking, not her. I realise that now [...] My mum loved me with all her heart"". So, he simultaneously absolves himself and his mother. There's a duality of forgiveness and remorse."

She's not the same person she used to be, and in ""Chosen"" she uses the power to share her strength the world over.

Also, some of the episodes (many, actually) have commentaries, and these have been really helpful to me in understanding how the writers, directors, and actors conceived of and executed the episodes. I think that there are a lot of times when the same people have made public comments (at conventions or in interviews) about the episodes, and that would be very helpful to read too. Posting links to transcriptions of these would be awesome!  Basically, I can't endorse this enough :) I think it would be great in helping everyone to better understand and discuss Buffy on a whole deeper level."

Excerpt from the shooting script:  A few feet on she stops, looking over at the wall. She moves to it and we see that a small hole has been broken through, showing a glimpse of the dark, cramped space behind.  Inside that space is Joyce.  BUFFY: Mom?  JOYCE: Oh, hi, honey.

buffy,2wwfix,strawberryf1elds,26,Mon Feb 23 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"I always thought that was part of it :) The monks made her ""the baby,"" after all, when they could have made her anyone.  It also explains why her mom is so eager to have her hang out with Buffy so much, even though that expressly goes against her desire to protect Dawn from things like ""dead guys in shops"" and violent Slayer-related activities in general. Notice that she's tagging along with Buffy as she's training in ""Real Me""? And her mom is always trying to get Buffy to take her everywhere? I don't think it's just because her mom couldn't afford a babysitter or didn't want to do it herself. Dawn's ""always around,"" as Buffy says, because the monks wanted it that way.  Edit: The monks giving Buffy and her mom (and the others, too, but especially her new 'family') an enhanced sense of protectiveness towards Dawn also goes a long way towards explaining why Buffy was so adamant on saving her, even at the expense of the world.  When I first saw the fifth season, I was a little perplexed as to why Buffy insisted on treating Dawn as her sister, even when she knew that she wasn't. In almost every other case, spells are things to be broken. People's actions under a spell are unnatural and untruthful: for example, Buffy coming on to Xander in ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" Joyce creating MOO and seeing Slayers as the enemy, Tara's forgetting about the fight she and Willow had about magic. And yet Buffy and her mom realize Dawn isn't really ""theirs,"" but she feels like it, and that's enough.  Even at the end of the season, when protecting Dawn doesn't even make a lot of sense (Buffy's so torn up over not saving her that she becomes catatonic, and she's willing to let the world end, if it comes to that, in order to save her - I don't think that the monks ever really wanted anything like those reactions), Buffy treats it as sacrilege to even thinking of treating Dawn as anything other than an innocent. But that's only one way to look at it - the other way is that a ""green ball of energy"" is Dawn's true form.  I think that Buffy protects Dawn partly out of a desire to fulfill the promise she made to her mother before she died, and partly because the monks made her feel that way. She chooses to believe in the illusion. And the illusion becomes reality."

buffy,2wwfix,GinaZaneburritos,8,Mon Feb 23 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks :)  Just a theory. But didn't anyone else think it was weird that Buffy went a little nuts protecting Dawn, especially at the end? She asks the monk to ""unbuild"" the memories, but when he dies she abandons that route entirely and treats her as family. As in the episode appropriately titled ""Family,"" what's important isn't blood-kin: it's the family you choose. She mixes her blood with Dawn's in ""Blood Ties"" (before that I'm not even sure if they did have the same blood - it's kind of more powerful if they didn't), and accepts her as her own. She turns Dawn from a figment, something easily unveiled by the ""tirer la couverture"" spell, into real flesh-and-blood - her ""family."" And by the end of the season, the only family she has left.  Another possible motivation for both her acceptance of Dawn and her sacrifice in Dawn's place in ""The Gift"" could be what Spike termed her ""death-wish"" in ""Fool for Love."" She knows that her feelings aren't ""real,"" but she doesn't have the strength or the will to fight them and would rather sacrifice herself than deal with things as they are. She lost her mother. She doesn't want to lose her sister, even a ""fake"" sister, one she's only had for a few months. I think, by the end of the fifth season, she truly does want to give up fighting. Her feelings for Dawn give her an ""out."" They're not completely real, and she knows that, but she chooses to die for them anyway."

They're not completely real, and she knows that, but she chooses to die for them anyway.   (Emphasis mine). Your comments are extremely well said. I agree that Buffy went way overboard protecting Dawn, and really could not believe Buffy's decision to sacrifice herself in Dawn's place until I read this. Poor Buffy. She really had too heavy a burden to bear for far too long, as the Slayer and as a person."
buffy,2wwfix,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your kind words :)  In terms of ""Buffy being depressed,"" I think the fifth season is even harder to watch than the sixth season in some ways.  I've always been glad that Buffy (the show) didn't end after season 5. It would have been a pretty depressing ending to what is usually an optimistic and empowering show, IMO."
buffy,2wwfix,GinaZaneburritos,2,Fri Feb 27 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"Shit, man. Stop making me feel things! This is really beautiful, and the ideas of your second paragraph are nicely supported by the show. ""This isn't real, but I just want to feel"", as it were."
buffy,2wwfix,barre_chord_reality,3,Tue Feb 24 03:55:19 2015 UTC,":) I can't help it; I'm stuck with serious thoughts all day XD   This isn't real, but I just want to feel   Hmm. That's an interesting parallel that I hadn't considered before. I think it has some merit.  Buffy is pretty emotionally drained and feels ""hollow"" long before she gets pulled out of heaven. Her mom gets sick, then dies; Riley leaves her. She empathizes with the robot April (treats her as a person, insists that Warren treat her better, tries to soothe her ""feelings"" as her batteries run out - totally different, by the way, from how robots were presented in ""Ted""), and in ""Intervention,"" it's clear that she's right: she has become so hardened, emotionally numb, and ""turned to stone"" that her friends can't even tell her apart from a robot.  Death was her gift. And then it was taken away. And her response is to turn again to feeling something - love for Dawn, passion or lust for Spike - in order to find some kind of purpose, some kind of satisfaction in her life. Her feelings for Dawn, whatever their origin, become real because she chooses them. Her feelings for Spike also become real (eventually), but here she can't claim that she's behaving decently or unselfishly, as she could in ""The Gift."" And that tears her apart inside.  So these ""feelings"" affect her in different ways, but yes, I think you could say that she chooses them (knowing that they're not completely real) for somewhat the same reasons."
buffy,2wwfix,GinaZaneburritos,10,Tue Feb 24 05:57:19 2015 UTC,"I think that could be part of it, also from a practical standpoint, the character of Dawn was supposed to be for somebody younger, like 8 to 12 years old. Michelle obviously got the part, so they tweaked her character slightly to reflect her actual age.  Aside from all of that, I think the most disturbing thing about the way they handled Dawn was how as she got older, they all treated her as if she was even younger. Even her dialogue devolved. The only people who really seemed to care about Dawn was Spike and Clem.  EDIT: and Tara. I forgot to add Tara."
buffy,2wwfix,barre_chord_reality,3,Mon Feb 23 22:54:05 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by ""her dialogue devolved""? She seems to grow as a character (to me) throughout the sixth and seventh seasons. She takes responsibility for her ""sticky fingers/grabby hands"" phase (and learns not to use the w-i-s-h word), she finds the M'Fashnik demon, and she acts pretty maturely (with courage and self-sacrifice) in both ""Conversations with Dead People"" and ""Potential."" And ""Grave.""  Buffy always cares about Dawn. In ""Lessons"" I think you see it, if not before - she's just kind of distracted. And to be fair, a lot of people act childishly/selfishly in season 6. I don't see Dawn as acting any more childishly than anyone else, really."
buffy,2wwfix,TheBlueDanNoob,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:38:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't very clear with my explanation. I should have just waited until I had time to write something more coherent than that.   What I meant about Dawn and the dialogue that they gave her character for the last two seasons of the show is that it essentially devolved. I noticed this when I was on my second watch of the series. I don't know how deliberate this was on the behalf of the writers of the show, but she (Dawn) grows to be taller and looks somewhat older, but the way she speaks is that of somebody younger than she is portrayed as being.   Maybe they were trying to emphasize the fact that she's still the ""baby"" of the Scooby Gang, but it didn't fit with the overall theme of the shows' ability to show great character development and growth. Everybody grows up but Dawn. She's just left on the outer fringes of the show and just kind of languishes.   EDIT2: I'd just like to go on the record as saying that Dawn is one of my favorite characters on the show and really thought that she was underutilized and ahem w-i-s-h that more could have happened with her."

buffy,2wwfix,Sammyboy616,6,Mon Feb 23 23:57:12 2015 UTC,"My main thought as to why Buffy wouldn't let Dawn fight even when Dawn was the same age as Buffy was when Buffy first started fighting (the inability to clearly use pronouns made that a bit convoluted!) was that Buffy knew precisely how dangerous it was, and how awful it was to have to do that.  Dawn, on the other hand, doesn't have to, and Buffy wants to make sure that she never has to.  She goes a bit overboard by not even teaching her basic defense skills, but still, I think that's her reasoning."
buffy,2wwfix,SoMuchMoreEagle,5,Tue Feb 24 00:47:42 2015 UTC,"Why do I feel like whenever people talk about Dawn they totally forget the entirety of season 7, where she spent her time either kicking ass with the gang or doing important translations/research?  Buffy actually acknowledges that she's been treating Dawn unfairly in Grave.  Though I do agree with most of the points being made here."
buffy,2wwfix,GinaZaneburritos,7,Tue Feb 24 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"That does make sense.     I think they also don't let her stay alone because she doesn't have any powers to protect her.   They probably should have taught her ways to be more self reliant, but it's like they saw she wasn't mature enough.   So she kept being incapable and immature."
buffy,2wwfix,suzeburbs,6,Mon Feb 23 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"They do let several people stay at home without any powers, though. Like, say - her mom? :) And for a couple of years she didn't even know there was anything to be afraid of. Buffy only worries about protecting her when she feels there is a distinct, probable threat on her life, as in ""Passion"" and ""Graduation Day"" (edit: or in ""This Year's Girl"").  Xander stays at home relatively worry-free, as does Giles, who I know is supposed to have more ""power"" to protect himself, but many of his encounters with evil creatures end up like this: http://i.imgur.com/2RoGb.gif  I think there must be a little more to the story than her powerlessness."
buffy,2wwfix,RinserofWinds,3,Mon Feb 23 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say, I'd love to see how the first three seasons would have turned out if Dawn was there.

buffy,2wwfix,The_Iron_Zeppelin,6,Tue Feb 24 01:18:14 2015 UTC,*four. And I totally agree. It so fascinates me that the memories we have of the Scoobies during that time aren't the memories they have.

I'll post those when I finish up, might even take on one for each episode."
buffy,2wruq6,sarah_bellum75,14,Sun Feb 22 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"I had used the officially-licensed ""Angel"" prosthetic, but they no longer sell it with that name.  It has the same design, though.  You can get them through www.mostlydead.com.  There are three different designs:   Angel Spike Drusilla   That all being said, if you decide to go with a different design/brand, just make sure it's foam latex and not just latex rubber.  Get some good adhesive like Pros-Aide (Here is the Graftobian brand version of that) and make sure you get its proper remover... otherwise it's nigh impossible to get off.  Avoid Spirit Gum like the plague.  The irritation you can get from it and the weak hold it gives just isn't worth it.  If you have an airbrush for the coloring, excellent.  If not, you can use Rubber Mask Grease.  Other things such as creme makeup will cause the foam to start to break down as well as cause matching/blending problems after wearing it for some time.  If RMG is not an option, you can treat the prosthetic with castor sealer prior to painting.  You will also want liquid latex to blend the edges into your skin.  Stipple with a makeup sponge, don't paint it on.  Other things to keep in mind:   Make sure your face is cleansed before starting.  Oils in the skin really screw with adhesive.  Wetting a sponge with isopropyl alcohol can help to break down any oils before you begin. Take your time.  These things take a while to put on when someone is doing it for someone else.  If you're doing it on yourself then just go slow and be aware of where you are placing glue and work nice and deliberately.   Don't forget things like highlights and shadows.  Just putting a base coat will provide you with a very flat piece (despite the bumpies).   That's all I've got for now.  Sorry for writing a book."

There are so many deaths in the series, but this one really makes you feel the weight of it.  On a funnier note that nobody talks about, I like that guy in Dawn's art class talking about the popular girl.

And it makes them realize that they can't always win against death. There is no plan b, no one last shot, no way to change it because she's just gone.

Joyce didn't do anything as far as Anya could comprehend to deserve death.   That being said, I have to actually skip this episode on rewatches sometimes.

buffy,2wp2co,filletsteak,43,Sat Feb 21 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"That's tricky. As you say, technically it was Spike's blood that ""opened"" the Seal, but I think without Andrew using the knife on Jonathan and ""feeding it its first drops of blood,"" it never could have been opened in the first place.  Andrew had to use a certain knife and ""drive the words deep into"" Jonathan, and the words were ""the blood which I spill I consecrate to the oldest evil."" Without that ritual being performed, I don't think the Seal could have been opened, so this act was really what ""activated it"" from dormancy.   The problem was just that there wasn't enough blood. So old, cold butcher's blood could have finished it off, or Spike's blood, or really any kind of blood. But it was the sacrifice of Jonathan that set the whole thing in motion. I think that's why Andrew's tears could close it.  Does that make sense? That's kind of how I see it.  Edit: I think it's similar to how the Seal was considered ""open"" even when we see several shots of it between ""Never Leave Me"" and ""Storyteller"" where it certainly looks closed. It's still brimming with supernatural evil energy and can possess Principal Wood and draw students to it, because it's ""active,"" in a sense, all the time between ""Conversations with Dead People"" and ""Storyteller."" It just needed a little more blood to spit out Ubervamps, which is why the First was so focused on ""opening"" it more - it wants its soldiers. If you think about it, Xander gets strung up in ""First Date"" to ""open"" it again, even though, no matter how you look at it, it's already open."

First of all, as I mentioned in another comment, because not every college lets you pick your roommate, and secondly, because being prepared for school stuff was never Buffy's forte. She was studying for the SATs, and procrastinating doing it, the night before. Which I find understandable, because she's the slayer, after all, and a normal college experience isn't really her focus.  Also, she says at the end of ""Graduation Day"" that she just wants to sleep until it's time to go to college. They just had a huge, potentially world-ending battle, which they won. Angel left town. You really expect her to be on top of registering for classes before the deadline? I don't think I would be in her position. Just graduating high school can be a big step, even without the extenuating circumstances of getting over her boyfriend-whom-she-sent-to-hell-and-who-came-back breaking up with her, stabbing one of her friends and putting her in a coma, saving the world, and blowing up the school. ""Fire bad, tree pretty."" For a few months at least :)  Giles seemed to be taking a break, too (since he has no job anymore, since he's no longer her Watcher, and since he thinks it's time Buffy learn to do things for herself) and he was the one who was always on her about things like that."

I think Oz is a factor and Willow likely spent a lot of time with him over the summer rather than babysitting Buffy and her responsibilities (registering for classes)   But even though she was assumedly spending a lot of time with Oz, and making sure Buffy stays on task is not her responsibility, I feel like it would be totally in the nature of reliable-dog-geyser-person Willow to swing by Buffy's at some point and say 'Hey Buff, lets pick your classes so you don't get stuck taking Theory of Bowling'. I didn't insinuate that not getting mundane shit done was not in Buffy's nature - that's totally in Buffy's nature!"
buffy,2wphsc,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Feb 22 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think I misunderstood a little what you were saying :)  I don't see many instances of Willow ""taking the lead"" in pushing Buffy to do stuff, though. Even the ""reliable dog geyser person"" line comes from a conversation where Buffy was the one asking her to do something. Willow tried to get Buffy to study with her (in ""Bad Girls,"" for example), and Buffy blows her off. Willow is tutoring her in ""Becoming, Part I"" when they find Ms. Calendar's disk, but again, I believe that's instigated by Buffy. Willow's pretty passive in terms of taking the initiative with her friends.   Maybe it would help to point out that she was apparently equally unhelpful to Oz in the summer between the second and third seasons. Not only did she not push him to go to his summer school classes, but apparently she was even unaware that he didn't go! :)"
buffy,2wphsc,DrLisaCuddy-House,2,Sun Feb 22 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"she was apparently equally unhelpful to Oz in the summer between the second and third seasons. Not only did she not push him to go to his summer school classes, but apparently she was even unaware that he didn't go   Holy shit, good point!"
buffy,2wphsc,wizensilver,7,Sun Feb 22 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"I think Oz is a factor and Willow likely spent a lot of time with him over the summer rather than babysitting Buffy and her responsibilities (registering for classes), but I cannot think of a good reason that makes sense as to why they wouldn't room together.   They had to realize how insanely difficult it would be to have the Vampire Slayer rooming with a stranger (even one that wasn't from the underworld) and not having a place to drop the Secret Identity Gal persona. And even without that, how gambling on two strangers to live with had less of a chance of being pleasant than just living together."
buffy,2wphsc,GinaZaneburritos,8,Sat Feb 21 23:59:05 2015 UTC,but I cannot think of a good reason that makes sense as to why they wouldn't room together.    Rooming with friends in college can be a good way to seriously damage that friendship.
buffy,2wphsc,DrLisaCuddy-House,3,Sun Feb 22 01:59:08 2015 UTC,"Could be. The transition to rooming together just seemed so easy and natural after Kathy's spot opened up for Willow to move in that it just had me pondering why it was never mentioned and what led them to the initial decision, not even a 'yeah we should have roomed together from the beginning' throwaway line."
buffy,2wphsc,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sun Feb 22 21:26:14 2015 UTC,I completely never understood why they didn't room together in the first place. They should have given us some half-assed explanation.
buffy,2wphsc,DrLisaCuddy-House,5,Sun Feb 22 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"I assumed (being British) that it was some sort of american rule that you had to room with who you were given, no choice involved, because of this. Then again, the entire concept of roommates is foreign to me, I have trouble sharing a bathroom in my flat, let alone a bedroom!"
buffy,2wphsc,strawberryf1elds,2,Sun Feb 22 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Nope, I picked my roommates. My first year entering college I roomed with a friend from high school. If you don't pick, they will randomly assign you someone.   The only thing I can think, is that both parties need to pick the other person (so person A has to name B, and B has to name A). So maybe Willow put down Buffy as her preferred roommate, but Buffy just never got around to filling out the paperwork in time, before room assignments came out?  But if that were the case, I feel like we would have seen Willow pout about it."
buffy,2wphsc,CloudGirl,9,Sun Feb 22 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think different colleges are different. I didn't get to choose my roommate. I did fill out a survey with questions like ""what time do you typically go to bed?"" and then I was assigned to a room.   This was in the United States.  Edit: Actually, my college was pretty strict about not letting people choose their roommates. To promote diversity, I think. There were 12 residential ""halls,"" and each student was randomly assigned to one. The only way someone could choose a residential hall - still, not a roommate, though - was if your parent had been in one, and you either did or did not want to room in the same one.  So Buffy rooming with Kathy didn't seem all that weird to me."
buffy,2wphsc,strawberryf1elds,2,Sun Feb 22 01:24:51 2015 UTC,Interesting! TIL
buffy,2wphsc,CloudGirl,2,Sun Feb 22 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no, it's totally not a weird thing to choose your roommate in the US. When you apply for housing, if you know who you want to room with you both put each other, otherwise they use the application to attempt to match you to someone compatible if you don't have someone picked out already. I'm hoping someone comes up with something super convincing that I can use as head-canon for this, as I'm currently watching S.4.E.1 The Freshman and I'm already annoyed that they aren't living together."
buffy,2wphsc,stillnotking,3,Sun Feb 22 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like Buffy and the gang grew up way too fast between seasons 3 and 4. They didn't act like 18 year olds, they acted like mid 20 somethings. They always acted older than they would in real life but they aged six years overnight.   That's what threw me off."
buffy,2wphsc,barre_chord_reality,2,Sun Feb 22 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"How so? If you don't mind, I'd like to know a little more about how you think they act so much older. I'm curious, because I never got that impression."

I drunkenly broke the prosthetic at the end of the night, so I can't quite recreate the look, but basically: -apply forehead/cheekbone piece with spirit gum (mine is foam latex from mostlydead.com. Woochie ""Lost Vampire"" is similar.) -blend edges with liquid latex-- I used a torn makeup sponge and dabbed it on. Give it time to dry. -Makeup! I used foundation a little lighter than my skin (MUFE Mat Velvet in the lightest shade) all over the prosthetic and my skin. Darker shade in the forehead creases to accentuate (I used a bb cream a little too dark for me.) Highlights on the brows and upper cheekbones. Gray and purple shadows around the eye and under cheekbones to look extra dead. -Contacts are from Pinky Paradise, basic yellow ones. My actual eyes are blue/gray. -Fangs are just the kind you can get in little coffin cases at any costume shop. They stayed in all night without a problem.    ... Does that help?

buffy,2wlnm5,bwburke94,6,Sat Feb 21 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, so following on from the comment made previously....  I've thought about this many times before as well. Here are some of the problems with this:    Numbers - A large portion of the sub have either not read the comics, or have read a few (mostly out of order). So firstly, you have a simple case of supply and demand. The demand really doesn't seem high enough for doing a comics read-through. If you look at our 2014 survey, it kinda backs this.  Doing a comics read-through is a huge undertaking, both in time and duration.  Canon - No doubt, there will be some disagreements on canon if doing a comics read-through. I'm sure at some point, people will be say ""well what about [insert] strip?"". This is likely to lead to people dropping out of the read-through and we don't want that. We don't want people to feel like they're not included and that their views on canon don't matter, but it's simply impossible to cater to everyone.  Duration - The Buffyverse is a massive undertaking when it comes to re-watches/read-troughs. There are 144 episodes (plus the unaired pilot) for Buffy. We do one re-watch per week during our cycle, that's over two years to get through just Buffy. If you added comics to this, I have no idea how long this would take, a really long time, especially if you were going to do one issue a week. After the fall is 23 (off the top of my head) issues long. You can see the sheer scale of this idea hopefully now. It's a massive undertaking.    A comics read-through is a great idea, I'd love to do it. But with the sheer amount of episodes and comics that Buffy has, this is no easy task to undertake. If we see an increase in demand, and given the proper preparation, we would definitely love to do this. But for now, it's not something we can realistically implement as we have not really considered this, due to the above mentioned demand."
buffy,2wlnm5,bwburke94,2,Sun Feb 22 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"After reading your comment, I have to agree. Some of those points I had thought of, but the issue with canon I had not. Thank you for such a long response, and thanks mods for doing the rewatch!"
buffy,2wlnm5,Sammyboy616,2,Sun Feb 22 19:05:19 2015 UTC,No problemo!   We have done a complete re-watch before by the way. They can be found in our FAQ.
buffy,2wlnm5,Sammyboy616,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:57:04 2015 UTC,I have a sub set up for the rewatch already. And there isn't a much more appropriate name than /r/WatchersCouncil.
buffy,2wlnm5,Sammyboy616,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Is the sub connected to this one? I know the mods were implementing a new system for the rewatch, is this what they were talking about?"
buffy,2wlnm5,Beloit,5,Sat Feb 21 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"This sub has no affiliation to us. First time I've ever heard about it :)   Also, I saw this post as soon as it was posted. When I have some time tomorrow, I'm going to address the ideas that yourself and others have brought up. :)"

buffy,2wlnm5,Beloit,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:10:36 2015 UTC,"Also, would you include S8, 9 and 10 in the sub?"
buffy,2wlnm5,Beloit,6,Sat Feb 21 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"""That is a reread not a rewatch"" True, do you think it should be something separate?   ""not everyone has the comics or has read them. I have never read a single one for instance so I don't consider them canon."" Ok, well I agree, but not everyone has all the TV seasons. It definitely depends on the person. So what you're saying is there isn't enough people who consider the comics canon do make doing a reread worth it?  ""they are a whole different thing then the show, not really a season."" Yes they are very different, especially S8. S9 and 10 do a lot to go back to the roots though, and feel more like the show."
buffy,2wlnm5,yallcat,3,Sat Feb 21 08:00:05 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they be canon?
buffy,2wlnm5,batgirl_ii,4,Sat Feb 21 13:33:55 2015 UTC,But isn't that like saying season 7 isn't canon just because you can't get the DVD?
buffy,2wlnm5,faaackksake,2,Sat Feb 21 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"My point isn't about whether or not you've seen it, my point is that it's officially canon, and has been done by Joss Whedon.  It doesn't stop being canon if it's hard to get or you haven't seen it.  This is disregarding Head-Canon, but the whole point of head-canon is that it is your own made up canon, divergent from the official canon."
buffy,2wjq84,milliways86,3,Fri Feb 20 14:09:35 2015 UTC,Even just reading this made me relive all those emotions.. Gonna go rewatch it right now!

buffy,2wo3ho,shoseki,8,Sat Feb 21 17:03:55 2015 UTC,All of the female characters had character flaws as well. It is what humanized them.
buffy,2wo3ho,VanillaMoonPie,2,Sat Feb 21 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between a character flaw and the underlying basis of the character being weak. Oz and Riley to me seem the closest to being ""normal"" but they are shown the door fairly quickly."
buffy,2wo3ho,queenie504,8,Sat Feb 21 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're undervaluing the male characters. Just like a lot of female characters who don't kick ass in other TV shows but are still awesome, you don't need a sword to be a badass. For example: Fred was awesome in Angel but it wasn't because she could punch someone in the face. She was smart and competent, and that was all that mattered.   I may not like Xander but he saved the world just by talking Willow down. Giles is smart and resilient, so resilient that he was able to withstand Angelus's torture, and it was only when Drusilla stepped in that he gave. Season Six proved that he was the glue that held the younger members together, they depended on his advice and wisdom so heavily that when he left things declined for them at a very quick rate. And calling Spike whiny also ignores so much of what he did in season 7 that lead to someone who started off being one of the most selfish Buffy characters in the whole series doing one of the most selfless things in the world - throwing his own life away to save the people and person he loved (he also could kick a ton of ass as was shown many many times).   All of the male characters were strong. Just not strong in a typically male way that we normally see (for the most part). And that's a good thing."
buffy,2wo3ho,queenie504,-1,Sat Feb 21 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"Please define for me ""strong in a typically male way"". I just meant strong in a normal way ie don't have some core character flaw that makes them need to redeem themself.  I don't see any positive role models for guys in Buffy."
buffy,2wo3ho,queenie504,6,Sat Feb 21 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"What would you consider a good role model? I think Giles is a fantastic role model for men. He's smart, well read, charming as hell, and actually a lot stronger than he looks. I think Spike is a good role model too (although only near the end of season seven). He did some really terrible things in season six but the man in the end of season seven is a man who has become a good man - he's everything he used but be but good. He was always powerful, and selfless, and loving but when he was those things in earlier seasons he was also extremely destructive in the way he went about showing them - the fact that he's not anymore speaks volumes to how he's changed for the better. And while I don't really like Xander I'll argue that he's a good friend, and that he's kind and isn't afraid to stand up for what he believes in, all good traits for men.  And there is no normal way to be ""strong"" strength comes in many forms.   And when I say strong in a ""typical male way"" I mean that there are so many male characters that feel like cookie cutter action heroes where sometimes where they have flaws but all of that seems to be forgiven because they can kick a lot of butt and take a lot of names. James Bond is a big one when it comes to that. I love James Bond, but he is NOT good role model for men."
buffy,2wo3ho,queenie504,0,Sat Feb 21 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"James Bond is a slimy jerk. But at least he is pro-active.  Doesn't mean that there are any role models for men in Buffy.  And no, guys don't want to be Giles. They don't want to be Xander, potentially Spike (until S7, then definately no), or Riley. Maybe Oz. Maybe. But as I said, they ditch him fairly fast.  It sounds like what you want to be a good role model and what is actually inspiring as a role model for guys are two different things. I'm the bookish type of male, and there is no way in hell I'd every fantasize about being / look up to Giles."
buffy,2wo3ho,Sammyboy616,3,Sat Feb 21 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"""It sounds like what you want to be a good role model and what is actually inspiring as a role model for guys are two different things.""  Maybe you should expand your idea of a good role model then? Because right now it seems very very narrow. You seem stuck on the idea that a good role model must be normal. To which I say - what is normal? Men come in all shapes and sizes. And there are plenty of good ones in Buffy. Maybe they are just not good ones that you can relate too, and that's okay. Oz was an interesting character and in many ways a good role model. But he wasn't the only one."
buffy,2wo3ho,Baseball_dusty,0,Sat Feb 21 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Proactive, willing to take risks and suffer the consequences. Not a creepy 100 year old guy hitting on a 17 year old (angel/spike), not a whiny ""laugh guy"" who gets with someone clearly selfish and deranged and doesn't do anything about it (Xander), not a 40+ old father figure who is basically there for lore purposes.  My only role models nowadays tend to be stand up comedians, they seem to be the only ones who actually say what they think and damned the consequences. You get offended? Leave. There don't seem to be any genuine assholes in Buffy (who bat for the good team) to grudgingly like, lovable rogues that heel turn (Spike doesn't count because of moping).  Han Solo. Theres a good character."
buffy,2wo3ho,Baseball_dusty,4,Sat Feb 21 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"Han Solo isn't the best role model either, at least not until movie 3 where he's mellowed down a bit. He's snarky but that gets him in trouble a lot, and up until the end of the first movie he's incredibly selfish.   To Buffy: calling Anya selfish and deranged is really doing her character a disservice. Anya is awesome. And what's wrong with being a father figure? The first part about Angel and Spike to a much lesser degree is true but you also have to take into account what the show was about - vampires. And Spike took risks and suffered the consequences - many, many times. And I think people get mopey and introspective mixed up a lot. And to being mopey: what's wrong with a guy who is more open with his feelings? That's not something to look down upon.  And I don't think stand-up comedians are great role models either. Some of them are really funny but they can also be giant dicks which honestly can get tiring.   And finally I'm glad there are no genuine asshole male characters in Buffy. She wouldn't stand for them and neither will I.   Honestly I think we are going to agree to disagree on this. And that's okay too."
buffy,2wo3ho,Splynn,3,Sat Feb 21 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"You're kind of just exaggerating flaws in characters, which everyone has.  Buffy barely ever knows what she wants and spends all of S6 wanting to die, Willow tries to solve every problem with magic and kills a bunch of people, Cordelia essentially the bitch-queen until Angel S2, Anya is completely money obsessed and criticises everyone, and Dawn spends all of S5/6 hating everyone, moaning and stealing stuff.  Every character on the show has flaws, which is what makes them strong and believable.  Apart from Tara.  Tara was perfect.  Also, ""boring"" and ""tedious"" are more subjective opinion and not character features."
buffy,2wo3ho,Craigaroo,-1,Sat Feb 21 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"Tara was awesome, but she was also awesome because she was ""normal"". I don't really see a single guy who is normal, except perhaps Oz, but then they get rid of him fairly swiftish."

buffy,2wj9ta,kpeteymomo,3,Fri Feb 20 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"I've been really enjoying this season. I would really like to see a crossover with Angel&Faith since Angel&Faith SPOILER And Spike is sorta acting like Angel did back in S2 right after losing his soul.   Just a thought, but maybe Spike has lost his soul, but since he was helping the Scoobys before he had a soul he won't go completely mad like Angel. Also, with all the talk Buffy and Spike had about what he did in the past and it being behind them, there is a high chance of something like soul loss coming up."
buffy,2wj9ta,buffanater,3,Fri Feb 20 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Oh shit. I hadn't even considered that, but you're exactly right-- except when at the end he tries to assure himself it was just a nightmare. That might be the only thing different. But I love that theory!"
buffy,2wj9ta,strawberryf1elds,3,Fri Feb 20 15:37:51 2015 UTC,It might be one of these:   Foreshadowing. A season 2 joke. Spike's past invades his dreams because of the guilt that he feels now that he has a soul and this is our first view into his mind. Somewhat similar to the dreams a soldier might have after coming home from war.   Or a mix of option 2 and 3.
buffy,2wj9ta,AngelAmongUs,2,Fri Feb 20 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think it's an actual plot point, with something new happening, not just Spike feeling guilty about his past. There's no reason he would be dwelling on his crimes so intensely all of a sudden after having had the soul and the guilt for years."

It's hard to nail down the years of these machines exactly, but Joss was 14 in 1978, and this style first appeared in 1975, suggesting that he got it new or almost new, either as a gift from his family or from a shop in New York City. The Deluxe 240T, which this most strongly resembles to my eye from the image, came out in 1978."

I feel like I should read it, but i'm already of an age where I'm realizing I'll die long before I get to read every book I'd like to.

buffy,2wipah,heymeowmeow,2,Fri Feb 20 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"That's not even the implausible part.  How does Ben hold down a job when he periodically and at completely unpredictable intervals turns into someone else who has other things to do?  How did he even become qualified to be a nurse, how did he get through school?  You can't really function in society under those circumstances.  What if in the middle of class he changes?  What if in the middle of assisting a patient he changes?  I realize that for magical reasons, people will not be able to realize that he is the alter-ego of Glory, but they will certainly notice that he is no longer where he is supposed to be, or doing what he is supposed to be doing.  This is the kind of thing that I tend to overlook on the grounds that there might be some kind of explanation even if I don't know what it is.  As for the coincidence of Buffy becoming personally involved with Ben, coincidence is used a lot in fiction.  It usually helps move plots along.  In this case it isn't really needed to help move the plot along but it does create some interesting plot twists.  If I wanted to rationalize it I would say that the occult energy emitted by the Hellmouth causes lots of strange things to happen."
buffy,2wipah,excultist,5,Sat Feb 21 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'd say that I find many aspects of the Glory/Ben/Key plot implausible.  But I think there actually is an in-world explanation for the ""sudden changing"" problem. Glory and Ben have been sharing the same body since infancy, but it's kind of an uneasy merging. In ""The Weight of the World,"" Glory talks about how Ben's emotions and humanity are starting to affect her. Ben also has a line somewhere about how he can feel the blood of all the Knights of Byzantium she's killed.  I may have made this up, because I can't find anywhere that they say it, but I always had the impression that Glory wasn't always able to manifest and only relatively recently has become strong enough to take over the body. Otherwise, you're right, how on earth could Ben have done anything? He gets fired in this season because of Glory's shenanigans. If this had been going on at the same level for a long time, he wouldn't have been able to do anything with his life.  I feel like Glory laid low for most of his life, and only now that she has a chance to get the Key is she taking over more and more."
buffy,2wipah,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sat Feb 21 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"That is a reasonable explanation.  Perhaps if that is the case, it could have been presented more explicitly in the series.  Here's another question for you (since you're doing so well).  Glory has this whole troop of medieval knights after her.  How long has this been going on, since the middle ages?  Has Glory been chasing after the Key for centuries?  Considering how difficult it was for Buffy to keep the Key out of Glory's clutches, how did they manage for centuries?  Also, didn't the knights know that if they caught up with Glory she would just kill them all?  Was this ever a practical idea?"
buffy,2wipah,excultist,2,Sat Feb 21 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Well, let's see. :)  There is some sort of timing aspect to using the Key. Even after she finds Dawn, Glory has to wait until a specific time and do a specific ritual to open the gateway back to her dimension.  I think that as this time approaches, the monks start to panic and hurry and hide the Key, Glory starts manifesting, gathering her minions, and looking for the Key, and the Knights of Byzantium appear, or wake up, and start hunting her down.   It's interesting, because it seems that a lot of people are aware of Glory even though she's only supposed to have been on earth for twenty-some-odd years. It's also interesting that she has this apparently long-term relationship with the Key, even though she's only been locked out of her dimension for a relatively short amount of time, and I'm not sure why she would need the Key when she's ""at home.""  It strikes me as a plot similar to the ones in Angel, really. There's some kind of prophecy about a god and an apocalypse that has a specific date, which is when Glory had to do the ritual. The monks know about it and try to stop it. The demon creatures that are her minions know about it, find her, worship her (maybe give her more strength somehow, too), and help her find it. The Knights of Byzantium know about it (indeed it seems to be their entire meaning for existing), are either time-traveled forward or perhaps they were put into some kind of stasis until such time as ""the Beast"" appears. The Key is almost as old as Glory and has been around as a portal-maker specifically to that dimension. I guess she feels a connection to it because it's to her dimension, but other than that I don't know. Maybe they have some other sort of history that isn't talked about.  Those are my best guesses. More explicit explanation in the series would have been good though."
buffy,2wipah,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would certainly make sense that the ritual for using the Key to open the dimensional gateway can only be done at a certain time, possibly as a result of astrological influences, or perhaps the various dimensions have some kind of higher dimensional geometry and they have their own orbits around each other and their relative positions.  There is definitely a parallel to the Angel series as you mention.  Buffy and Angel each have an evil goddess to deal with, Glory and Jasmine respectively, and in both cases, the most difficult thing for these goddesses to do is to travel between dimensions.  It is actually harder for a goddess to travel between dimensions than for anyone else, it seems.  Angel easily visits and returns from Jasmine's previous dimension, but it took Jasmine a tremendously elaborate preparation to make the same trip.  Illyria as we originally meet her has the power of effortless travel to any dimension, an ability that is presumably envied by goddesses.  Although we have no information that would tell us why this is, we might imagine that purely as a protective measure, some kind of obstacle to inter-dimensional travel on the part of goddesses has been installed by the Powers That Be."
buffy,2wipah,excultist,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I just meant that everyone seems to have an idea of what's coming and what's going on with Glory - her minions, the monks, the Knights of Byzantium - and it all kicks into high gear in a very time-centric way. They refer to the timing of it at several points: Glory complains that she's running out of time to find the Key, and part of Buffy's main plan in ""The Gift"" was just to slow her down long enough to prevent the rift from opening.   At first, I thought it had something to do with Glory not being able to hold onto herself in this dimension for too long - as in, if she didn't go back soon, she would fade away. I still wonder about that, actually - she was already pretty mentally unstable just being here. But I think it's less of that and more that the ritual is very specific in terms of when it can be done.  Almost like there is some sort of prophecy that many people are aware of. Since the opening of the portal was an apocalypse, it would make sense that it would be known. To be honest, I don't see how you could explain things like the Knights of Byzantium otherwise. If Glory has really been looking for the Key for centuries, and we're just seeing the endgame of a very long war that's been fought more or less at the same intensity for years and years, then I'd have to say that the plot makes no sense at all to me.   The idea the Knights have of attacking Glory was not all that smart, no. I wonder if maybe they had some sort of encounter with her before - perhaps in the medieval era. She's been trapped here only for the last twenty or so years, but maybe she's dimension-hopped before. She does seem to have worshippers here already. I feel like maybe the Glory that they dealt with in previous times was different than now in some way, and that's why they were used to going after her and thinking that was at all a good idea.  I hadn't really thought about the difficulties gods like Glory and Jasmine have moving between dimensions, but you're right. You know, Sahjhan also seems to have a lot of trouble. But in his case it seems more that he's trapped between them, not completely here nor there. I imagine that would be hard to get out of."
buffy,2wipah,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"I always thought of that demon as Sarjean but I have no authoritative source for the spelling.  Sarjean (or Sahjhan) had been made into a ghostly or incorporeal being by his mortal enemy, Cyrus Veil (whose name I may also be misspelling - although I like the name, he is a sorcerer who is able to draw a veil over reality).  He does open a dimensional rift to Kortath (also my guess as to the spelling) so he has at least some expertise in inter-dimensional travel, but it's not something we see him doing.  He does engage in time travel.  It is also not explained (yet another mystery) why Sarjean wanted to bring Holtz forward in time to the 20th century to attack Angel; why not attack Angel at the time Holtz was originally in?  Angel did not become more vulnerable in the future than he was in the past, if anything, his resources were greater.  There are a lot of details in the Buffy/Angel universe that are never fully explained.  We just go along for the ride."
buffy,2wipah,excultist,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"I just use the spelling that I find in the closed captioning - also in the wikis for Buffy and Angel. Or the scripts, if I bother to look them up. Anyway, the spelling doesn't really matter much.  Vail turned Sahjhan incorporeal? Wolfram & Hart took credit for it in season 3, but I always thought there was a good chance they were lying. Although Vail is certainly connected to W & H, so it's possible. And W & H knows how to undo it, so maybe they did have a role in bringing it about in the first place.  I think it's heavily implied that Sahjhan not only travels through time, he also travels through dimensions (as in the conversation he has with Lilah at the bar in season 3), but, although he can open portals and visit anywhere he likes, I always thought he was essentially incorporeal since his transformation. Although maybe that was just in this dimension (cf. Lilah's line right before he opens the portal).  As for why he brought Holtz forward in time, there are a number of possible reasons. I think he was also compelled, consciously or unconsciously, by prophecy to do things the way that he did.  But anyway, yes. Many things not completely explained, which doesn't make it any less fascinating. And good TV :)"

If not, where did they come from?  Season 5 is a wonderful season and may even be the best of all the seasons of Buffy, but it does leave me with a lot of unanswered questions.

It's not just that they can't comprehend the situation it's also their refusal to acknowledge it. I know it's not a great rationalization but it's one that is regularly employed by the writers.   The part that's hard to swallow to me is the coincidence which is definitely commonly used. But, like, I'm easily able to suspend my disbelief enough to accept, say, Buffy and Willow finding Ms. Calendar's disk just when they needed it. I just feel like they could have done so many things to avoid such a massive coincidence, for instance, Glory and/or Ben is/are spying on Buffy so he/she/they made sure to coincidentally meet Buffy.

Before that she was completely contained inside Ben, according to the wiki. There aren't sources cited so if anyone has a source on that it would be great, but it would explain your qualms with Ben/Glory."
buffy,2wipah,heymeowmeow,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would be a good explanation.  I can certainly imagine that not only was Glory expelled from her native dimension, but she was also sentenced to be submerged permanently in the artificial Ben personality.  But then she managed to break out.  Then again, if Glory had been trapped inside Ben all those years, why was she being hunted by a company of medieval knights?  They would never have seen anything amiss, just harmless old Ben.  So it is still a bit mysterious.  Some mysteries may never be solved."

buffy,2wijhe,Sammyboy616,8,Fri Feb 20 15:13:52 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any specific episodes where vampires are shown to be either capable or incapable of going into garages without an invitation. However, there is a season 2 episode of Angel (""Blood Money,"" episode 12) where - without giving you too many details, since I don't know if you're there yet - Angel is able to enter someone's car in a parking garage without an invitation.  A company's parking garage, and I'm sure he doesn't have an invitation to be there. While this could be considered a public place mild Angel spoiler, hopefully not telling you anything you don't already know  So, not only is Cordelia apparently wrong about vampires needing to be invited into cars, I'd say that probably they can go into garages too, since this seems to me to be a case of an attached garage not considered ""part of the building."" I think someone has to live in the space for the invitation problem to come up. So even if the garage is connected, they wouldn't be able to go into the house.  Hope this helps!"
buffy,2wijhe,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Feb 20 05:04:37 2015 UTC,I think if the garage is connected it might be a gray area.  Like maybe if the human inhabitant goes in there to smoke every day it might be considered an inhabited space.

I'm trying to think - this must come up sometime :)  Every time I picture Angel trying to go somewhere and either being stopped or remarking that he's not being stopped, it seems to be right at the threshold. He can go into apartment buildings but not apartments, for example (as in the season 2 episode ""Untouched""). Hallways and laundry rooms and everything else in an apartment building are kind of just as inhabited as a garage, no? In a season 3 episode ""Billy,"" he doesn't think it's bizarre that he can enter the enclosed grounds around a house, but he remarks that he doesn't need an invitation to enter the house.  But, you know, who knows :) If it were my garage, I'd watch out just in case."
buffy,2wijhe,bwburke94,3,Fri Feb 20 05:27:56 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, ""Blood Money"" does expand on the invitation rule. Anne was able to invite Angel to the community center (which is technically a residence) because she sometimes slept there."
buffy,2wijhe,TechnologicalDiscord,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"So if Garages are iffy, houses they can't enter and cars they can, what about an RV?  Obligatory Spike gif.  I love how crazy those goggles make him look."
buffy,2wijhe,lecherous_hump,6,Tue Feb 24 03:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say no if it's an attached garage, and yes if it's separated from the house, but it's obviously grey area. My impression was that a ""home"" is a living area, and if attached to the house, it would be part of the living area."
buffy,2wijhe,catdoctor,6,Fri Feb 20 13:29:29 2015 UTC,IIRC Spike had to be invited into Robin's garage. Which was attached to his house.
buffy,2wijhe,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Feb 22 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"YES! That was a garage! Thank you, this was bothering me a little :)  For some reason I thought this wouldn't be a good case because I assumed he'd been invited. But looking over the script, there is no specific invitation. An implied one, certainly, but that's usually not enough in the Buffyverse.   Wood: Got stacks and stacks of occult books on mind-control back at my house that may help us speed this along. Besides, if anything ... bad does happen there's only me to injure, and, well, I'm willing to take that chance.  Spike: You sure about that?  Wood: I'll keep a close eye on you.   And later:   Spike: Live in a garage?  Wood: This is just my work room. Kind of my ... sanctuary.  Spike: Little place to unwind, huh ...  [Wood enters, followed by Spike]   I think this is dispositive. Vampires can enter attached garages without an invitation."

buffy,2wijhe,CalixeAthura,1 point,Fri Feb 20 19:26:12 2015 UTC,Great question..I always wondered about Angel's place (from Buffy)..He has a soul..but he IS a vampire..but he has a home..would another vampire be able to walk into his place uninvited?
buffy,2wijhe,CalixeAthura,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"That's answered in the show, he can walk into any non-human dwelling without an invite."
buffy,2wijhe,CalixeAthura,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"I meant could another vampire, say Spike, walk into Angel's house uninvited. I was wondering because Angel DOES have a soul. I am still refering to the early seasons of Buffy. I'm not sure how to word it exactly."
buffy,2wijhe,CalixeAthura,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:34:55 2015 UTC,"He can, Angel's apartment is not protected from vampires.  From Wikipedia: ""Vampires cannot enter a human residence without having been invited once by a living resident; however, once given, such an invitation can only be revoked by a magic ritual. If all living residents die, vampires can enter freely. Areas open to the public and the homes of other vampires, demons, and non-humans are not protected.""  Angel is dead, not human.  Spike enters Angel's apartment in the 3rd episode of Angel.  If you have Netflix you can check for yourself, it's about 25 minutes in.  Episode is called ""In the Dark""."

Get a suitable piece of wood and find someone with a belt sander to grind the tip into a point, or whittle it down yourself with a pocket knife while sitting in a rocking chair on a porch for a truly authentic feel.      My favorite stake is the one that Buffy spins in the intro.  If you look closely, you can see that it's actually the handle from a wooden tennis racquet that's been sharpened.    Go down to a thrift shop, find an old racquet with a leather grip, and make yourself a stake!  Other iconic stakes were made from materials as commonplace as wooden balusters, wooden hammer grips, and baseball bats."

buffy,2wetb7,philharlow,12,Thu Feb 19 08:09:45 2015 UTC,"It is beautiful just the way it is. I think engraving anything into the box would take away from how authentic it looks. Like some old box Giles would pull out from under the reference desk in the library, mysterious and faded.  Those symbols you have pictured have no meaning to Buffy, aside from maybe tying in with some ancient European mythology. Celtic roots, whatever. And I think they cheapen the DVD boxes as well, some last ditch effort to make the product look 'better'.  You're tempted to make yours 'better', but I think soldering anything into the wood would cheapen it. It's a case for a stake, and a stake isn't adorned, it is a simple tool that deserves a simple, sturdy, undecorated box. There is power in plain wood, mystery, and death for the things that go bump in the night."
buffy,2wetb7,grassitch,3,Thu Feb 19 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the input! You make great points. I am leaning towards keeping it as-is now, especially since those symbols have no significance. Thanks!"
buffy,2wetb7,GinaZaneburritos,7,Thu Feb 19 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"What an AWESOME gift you're making! The stake and the box already look great. :)  The symbol definitely looks cool, but I don't think it really has a lot of significance in the show. In fact, I can't think right now of a single scene where it's shown.   I have what is apparently called the ""special collector's edition,"" and it doesn't have this symbol on it anywhere.   As for other symbols or markings - I'll think on it, and hopefully others will have good suggestions, but have you considered the cursive capital B? That's very iconic to the show."

Do you mean like this? http://dimensiondecals.vpweb.com/501_500_csupload_56553302.jpg I like that idea as well, but I'd want it to be a bit more faded as it's very bold lettering.

buffy,2wetb7,wowyesokay,4,Thu Feb 19 20:28:42 2015 UTC,I think what would make it cooler is some kind of worn looking latches and/or corner patches on the box. It looks very cool already though

buffy,2wdtix,AngryWizard,2,Fri Feb 20 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"Welllll ... maybe not that true, actually. I've been thinking about this, and it seems to me that Buffy's living room doesn't see all that much action. Which is weird, because I always thought it did. I'd say that if Grimm has been having fights at Nick's house for three-four seasons, then it probably would win.  To go season-by-season through the series with respect to damaging the living room:  First, I'm going to go out on a limb and say there wasn't much destruction in seasons 1 and 2. Buffy was still secret identity gal at home, and the creatures of darkness didn't really follow her home and trash her place. There was some damage in ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" but that's all I can think of specifically about the living room.  In the third season there was ""Dead Man's Party."" (You know, Buffy really saved her mom's life by coming back when she did; otherwise Joyce presumably would have hung up the mask anyway, but there wouldn't be anyone to protect her. Something that occurred to me.) So yes, massive destruction. But that's all I can think of for season 3.  In season 4, we have the other knock-down, drag-out fight in ""This Year's Girl."" Other than that, Buffy's house isn't much of a setting this season.  In season 5, Harmony breaks a window, and the Quellar demon fight may or may not have involved the living room; I'm not really sure. But I think that's about all.  In season 6 we have ""Flooded"" and ""Older and Far Away."" Am I missing any?  Really only in the seventh season does Buffy's living room turn into a war zone, and as OP stated, Xander fixes most of that, and the rest they pretty much give up on.   That's actually not that bad; I thought it was worse. The school gets the brunt of the destruction, not so much Buffy's living room.   Edit: Other honorable mention sites of constant destruction: the Bronze, Giles's house, and the Magic Box. I think it would definitely have to be the school (including the library) that sees the most damage, though. Not only is it the site of most fights and a few apocalypses in seasons 1-3, but it also sees a full-on riot in season 7. And it gets blown up. Twice."
buffy,2wdtix,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sat Feb 21 03:21:45 2015 UTC,"I asked my future father in law (he's a contractor) he said that given that the windows were nearly all appear to be old custom style (the wood at the top would require custom cut glass to fit)  that it would be outrageously expensive, in both material and labor, to replace any of the larger widows even once."
buffy,2wdtix,Baseball_dusty,2,Sat Feb 21 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how to begin to do the math. I think I'd need to kidnap Bob Barker to tell me what everything costs (actually, what everything used to cost) and then tally not just how many things are broken, but also how many are replaced. And I haven't watched Grimm, so I don't know how it would compare."
buffy,2wdtix,GinaZaneburritos,3,Thu Feb 19 05:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good. David Greenwalt co-created it, so it has an Ats feel to it, with the ""grimms"" being somewhat like slayers."

buffy,2wclot,SikozuShantiShanu,8,Wed Feb 18 20:39:18 2015 UTC,Have a whole bunch!  :)
buffy,2wclot,SikozuShantiShanu,5,Wed Feb 18 20:44:15 2015 UTC,I subscribed. It is awesome!
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Feb 18 21:35:08 2015 UTC,That it is! All thanks to /u/johnluckpickerd
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,4,Wed Feb 18 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"I love pretty much everything about Cordelia in this episode. From the fake laughter, to ""she's more like a sister, really, we're that close!"", to giving Buffy tips on what to wear, to the way she hugs Angel for saving her ... the rest of the episode is OK, but I think this is probably one of the best Cordelia episodes in Buffy.  I have to say that the ""Spanish soap opera"" version of Buffy and Angel in this video was kind of funny, too :)"
buffy,2wclot,johnluckpickerd,5,Wed Feb 18 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, totally.     ""You guys. I just... hate you guys! The weirdest things always happen when you're around!""     I also adore Willow's outburst where she's chastising Giles and Angel.     Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off!  And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the chosen one, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty!  And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee?!? Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've gotta help Buffy.""   Hahaha, yea, the soap opera Bangel bit gave me a good chuckle, reminded me of the ""I almost forgot to BROOD!"" exchange from Captain Forehead's show."
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,4,Wed Feb 18 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, early Willow chastisements, always a good time :)   HEY!! We don't have time for this. Our friends are in trouble. Now we have to put our heads together and get them out of it. And if you two aren't with me a hundred and ten percent, then get the hell out of my library!   I think one of the reasons I'm not as big a fan of Buffy and Riley's relationship is they do this same kind of melodramatic argument in ""Out of My Mind"":   Buffy: So you've got it all figured out. I'm bailing because you're not in the super club?  Riley: It's human nature -  Buffy: Don't Psych 101 me! Not now. Not after - after everything ... Nobody's ever known me the way you do, Riley. Nobody. I've opened myself up to you in a way that - God, you're just sitting back thinking it doesn't mean anything to me?  Riley: I never said that ...  Buffy: Well, it obviously doesn't mean anything to you! Do you think so little of me -  Riley: Buffy -  Buffy: No!   Come on! I can't help but feel that over-the-top (melo)drama is Buffy and Angel's thing. :)"
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,5,Wed Feb 18 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"Probably the only person she didn't have MELOdrama with was Spike. I thought about mentioning that in this video but I'm trying to avoid actively describing future episodes too much.  But in this episode Angel says, ""This could get out of control,"" and Buffy says, ""Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?""  And Spike says love is about the blood and the passion.   Yet by the end of the series the two of them have found something almost devoid of melodrama. Spikes speech on one knee is one of the most beautiful monologues I've ever heard. And later he says, ""It was...the greatest night of my life. And all I did was hold you."""
buffy,2wclot,TheBlueDanNoob,6,Wed Feb 18 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, do I love Spike."
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,4,Wed Feb 18 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"This was your video? Thanks then! I enjoyed it. :)  I've never seen anyone ever say that they particularly liked ""Bad Eggs,"" so I'd be more than willing to hear more about why you do, if there's a video of that.  Re: Spike and Buffy: I think their relationship had plenty of drama, and maybe even melodrama at times, but at least it was different. I've always felt that the exchange between Buffy and Riley that I quoted above owed a lot to recycled Buffy/Angel angst :)  Edit: Also, for a truly over-the-top moment, the scene where Buffy is running towards Riley, who's waiting to see if she shows up before leaving Sunnydale, probably can't be beat. I always thought it seemed like a perfect intro for a cell phone commercial."
buffy,2wclot,barre_chord_reality,2,Wed Feb 18 21:53:37 2015 UTC,There's a whole lotta Scooby problems that could be solved by texting.
buffy,2wclot,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"True! Too bad Buffy has a bad habit of leaving her phone at home. Or on the grass. And then there's those pesky codes that none of them can remember, where something either means they got lucky or someone's trying to kill them :)  Well, there's always the ever-helpful locator spells. Except you need people to then not move, as well as not be evil and everywhere. And be sure to open the door to see if the someone you're looking for is behind it rather than in front of it.   It's the Hellmouth. Magic or technology, it's all bound to go wrong somehow :)"
buffy,2wclot,johnluckpickerd,2,Thu Feb 19 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"Not really one of my Candy episodes but I was surprised when Beer Bad was rated the worst, in the survey here. Don't you just WANT Buffy to bop Parker over the head? Or Xander's ""And most people tip, say, 30%""? Or ""Er, Giles, don't make cave-slayer unhappy""?"
buffy,2wclot,TheBlueDanNoob,3,Wed Feb 18 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"""Beer Bad"" actually has quite a few fans. Including me :) I think the teaser with the daydream about Parker while she's in psychology class is inspired, especially paired with the episode's ending ... and Giles is funny in it ... and Willow is awesome in it ... and yes. It's not one of my top ten or anything, but I like that episode a lot.  I think maybe it's one of those episodes people either love or hate - not too much in between."

buffy,2wdbao,AngelAmongUs,2,Thu Feb 19 03:42:42 2015 UTC,According to his Facebook page he's still attending a con in TN next Friday. Hopefully he'll keep it together and there won't a repeat of this week.

buffy,2wdbao,TweetsInCommentsBot,6,Thu Feb 19 15:37:59 2015 UTC,"Anybody with a brain would pull him out of every con until he's sober, and maybe not even after. A convention in TN does not seem like a place to heal."

buffy,2wdbao,edna218,6,Sat Feb 21 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"E!News has the statement from the convention about what happened last weekend:  UPDATE: In response to Brendon's rep partially blaming his ""deporable situation"" at Shockpop for his outburst, convention organizers said in a statement:   ""Shock Pop Comiccon would like to set the record straight regarding false allegations from Nicholas's management regarding Nicholas's arrangements with Shock Pop. On Sunday, we were notified by the airlines that due to Winter Storm Octavia, that a large amount of our flights were cancelled. One of the managers of the convention arranged alternate flights and transportation so the guests could still leave on Sunday. Nicholas refused to take the shuttle and go on the flight. We were notified by his representative, and agreed to provide him an additional night at the hotel, and re-booked his flight at our expense for Monday. Nicholas then refused to take his shuttle to the airport, and go on the flight on Monday. One of the show representatives offered to take him to the airport, and he refused to allow us to send someone down to pick him up. At that time, Nicholas's management contacted us and we advised them he was unwilling to leave Fort Lauderdale.  ""At no time did we ever place Nicholas, or any other show guest under deplorable conditions.Throughout the weekend, Facebook and Twitter posts were positive regarding Nicholas and his experience at our show, and the only statements made by his management on Nicholas's Facebook page after the event concluded were overwhelmingly positive.  ""Our primary concern at this time is Nicholas's health, but we want all of his fans to know, that contrary to what his management has stated, we did not contribute to the  situation, and we exhausted every option we had to try and  prevent it.""  http://www.eonline.com/news/626470/buffy-s-nicholas-brendon-arrested-for-trashing-hotel-room-and-skipping-out-on-the-bill-reps-says-he-s-battling-a-disease"

buffy,2wdbao,Duderult,10,Sat Feb 21 05:06:48 2015 UTC,He's a good guy who can be a huge douche thanks to his addiction. He is in serious need of help.
buffy,2wdbao,faaackksake,10,Mon Feb 23 03:21:16 2015 UTC,I've met him twice now at cons. He always was very personable and warm to me and everyone I saw him interact with. The man was quick with a joke and eager to hug. I hugged the crap out of him both times. Also I'm a dude which might have been awkward for him but he played it off smashingly.   The alcohol and drug problems have been ongoing and I'll echo the wishes for his health and well being.
buffy,2wdbao,just_lurking12,4,Thu Feb 19 01:02:22 2015 UTC,I met him a couple of years ago and he was really nice.  I only got to interact with him for a minute but he seemed like a good guy.
buffy,2wdbao,virtual-toast,2,Thu Feb 19 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"he's always seemed very cool and nice to his fans, always seems warm and personable, but he does have substance abuse problems and they've obviously caused some bad behaviour, i really don't think he's a bad guy, cares a lot about his fans at least, but he needs help, like everyone with those issues. edit: so he's broken up with the wife... that's maybe part of the reason he's gone off the rails in the short term but i think long term it's probably better for him, obviously i have absolutely no idea about their relationship but she seems like a hardcore party girl and someone in recovery can't really be around that, at all."
buffy,2wdbao,throwaway_cuz_myob,4,Thu Feb 19 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"He's been separated from his wife since November (when she moved back to Indiana), so I wouldn't blame this train wreck on her."

I've met him and he always goes out of his way to ask about you, how your day is, and ensure you're having a great time. He is more than willing to give hugs, do crazy poses for photos, etc. etc. He's obviously dealing with some substance abuse problems in his personal life, but no, he's not a bad guy."
buffy,2wdbao,sarah_bellum75,2,Thu Feb 19 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'll be brief.  Take this as you will.  Anyone who has met him at a con for 5 minutes, or at an event, doesn't KNOW him.  Anybody who DOES know him, in the ""inner circle,"" will usually keep their damn mouth shut because... that's just how it's done.  If you want to keep your heroes based on what you ""know"" about them, leave it at that and don't dig too far.  If you want to understand the person, don't let the persona blind you."

Of course I did so and got talk with about it and his love of science for several minutes.  It was so cool but I almost felt a little bad because I was holding up his other fans in line."

buffy,2w7kbx,VanillaMoonPie,3,Thu Feb 19 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm off the top of my head/out of what I've been watching lately.  I actually found myself sort of surprised by Lost Girl, which I expected to be cheesy male gaze kind of tripe, but actually turned out to be really pretty good.  It also features a strong female protagonist, her spunky female friend, and a couple of her love interests.  More recently State of Affairs revolves around a female CIA analyst who reports to the female president and has another female best friend/coworker as part of her main team.  How to Get Away With Murder also features an array of well written women (but I get the feeling this is pretty standard fare for Shonda Rimes, though her other shows are a lot more romance-y it seems).  Agents of Shield has also gotten a lot better as it moved into its second season.  Still plenty of ladies, even more racial diversity (and much better writing).  In comedy territory, Brooklyn Nine Nine is basically my dream show when it comes to diversity and representation.  Out of the seven primary characters, a majority of them are racial minorities, three of them are women, and one of them is gay.  And it all feels perfectly natural, and ends up being absolutely hilarious.  Modern Family also does a pretty good job at representation, which is, you know, sort of the whole point of that show.  Edit -- Oh! And don't miss Agent Carter which is currently my most-looked-forward-to-every-week show, and while it doesn't have a super wide cast of female characters (outside of Carter herself) that's sort of the point of the show right now.  They're doing a great job quietly commenting on being a woman in a male dominated space in the midst of a really good action/spy story."
buffy,2w7kbx,CJGibson,3,Wed Feb 18 00:30:47 2015 UTC,Have you ever given Veronica Mars a shot? It's got a few well-written female characters-- as well as male-- and it's very Buffy-esque in tone. It's even got appearances by Joss and Charisma and Alyson!
buffy,2w7kbx,strawberryf1elds,2,Wed Feb 18 01:31:42 2015 UTC,Yes definitely try it! Veronica Mars and Buffy are tied for best TV show in my mind

buffy,2w69tv,bwburke94,9,Tue Feb 17 08:03:15 2015 UTC,"I like how everybody assumed it was Dawns fault, when it was actually Xander who summoned Sweet."
buffy,2w69tv,barre_chord_reality,7,Tue Feb 17 18:44:02 2015 UTC,Can we please talk about the fact that fucking Xander let several people die as a result of his summoning before owning up?  I feel like the writers never really addressed how horrible that was.
buffy,2w69tv,cakebatter,9,Tue Feb 17 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"Xander, pretty much alone among all the Buffy characters, has a history of making poor or selfish decisions and never being called out on them. I know he's young, and it's not like I don't understand why he does what he does (and it's not even that I think he makes the worst decisions; other people screw up just as much or more), I just think it's interesting that no one ever really takes him to task. And when they try, he clings to the moral high ground and pretty much shuts down the discussion. From the way that he acted after Cordelia broke up with him (trying to get his friends to laugh with him and ""behold the beauty that is now""), to ""kick his ass,"" to the way he vilifies Anya for sleeping with Spike and ends the conversation with ""I don't want to know any of this"" - nobody really gets through to him.  It's too bad, because without reaching that sort of ""rock bottom,"" he never really changes. He suffers from the consequences of his actions, but he still remains convinced all the time that he's right. He never takes responsibility the same way that Buffy, Willow, or even Dawn does.  Regarding ""OMWF"" specifically, I'd say that there's a lot of evil being done early in the sixth season that everyone is too distracted to take seriously and deal with properly (looking at the Trio especially), so I think Xander's summoning Sweet gets swept up in that."
buffy,2w69tv,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Feb 18 05:22:11 2015 UTC,"I think things got pretty out of hand before Xander really knew what was happening. It's not like main cast member had made decisions that cost the lives of others.   Had Buffy killed Angel when she had the chance, Jenny Calendar would still be alive. It seems Xander did sort of get a free pass , but it was the Hellmouth, and I don't think he knew that any of that was going to happen."
buffy,2w69tv,barre_chord_reality,7,Tue Feb 17 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I think the two things are pretty different.  I mean Giles tells Xander and Anya immediately following their number that people are spontaneously combusting and it's probably related to the singing and dancing.  I feel like that's the point you say, ""Holy fuck, I summoned a dancing demon, I thought it would just be an amazing real life musical like I always wanted! Here's the summoning spell I used, let's undo this before more people die!""  It's pretty different to admit you didn't realize what the consequences of your actions were and then take steps right away to stop other people from getting hurt, than it is to kill the love of your life like just a few hours after learning he was evil now."
buffy,2w69tv,cakebatter,3,Tue Feb 17 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of the show. None of the main characters were free of making stupid and sometimes fatal decisions that sometimes impacted all of Sunnydale, or even the entire world.   There was so much insane crap going on in season 6, that I think the decision Xander made to summon Sweet was kind of overlooked. Was it a flagrant oversight? Eh, I don't think so. It could have been dealt with somehow, like Xander having to go be with Sweet in his dimension, but obviously Sweet passed on that.   It's an interesting observation about a show that almost always follows through with consequences of actions, usually pretty directly."
buffy,2w69tv,barre_chord_reality,3,Tue Feb 17 22:44:22 2015 UTC,I use the head cannon that Xander could tell how awful Dawn felt and decided to cover up for her. It doesn't explain why the scooters weren't on his case but at least it makes Xander seem less awful.

buffy,2w6wwr,catdoctor,30,Tue Feb 17 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"Tara explained to Buffy that when they resurrected her from the dead, her essence was mixed up a bit. She's still the same person, but just a bit different at molecular level.   This mostly served as a great plot device to illustrate that Buffy feeling so bad about being alive again wasn't a physical issue. She was depressed about being pulled out of Heaven."

buffy,2w6wwr,DaddyCatALSO,2,Tue Feb 17 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"And Buffy didn't want it to be true, and when she accepted it she didn't want Tara to understand forgive. That's saying a lot about B's mindset."
buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,16,Thu Feb 19 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"BUFFY: You have no idea what you're messing with. Who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!  DAWN: (tearful) No, I-I know. It'll be her.  BUFFY: No. Now, Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. People come back ... wrong.      XANDER: You're talking about raising the dead. It feels wrong.  TARA: It is wrong.  WILLOW: She could be trapped!      We see Spike leaning against a tree, his back to them. He lifts a hand and wipes his eyes. Xander and Anya come closer.   XANDER: What are you doing out here? I hope you're not going to start your little obsession now that she's around again.   Spike grabs Xander and spins him around, slams him up against the tree and holds him there.  ANYA: Hey!  SPIKE: You didn't tell me. You brought her back and you didn't tell me.  XANDER: Well, now you know.  SPIKE: I worked beside you all summer.  XANDER: We didn't tell you. It was just ... we didn't, okay?  SPIKE: Listen. I've figured it out.   Spike lets go of Xander but doesn't move away, continues glaring at him.   SPIKE: (angrily) Maybe you haven't, but I have.   Spike still has tears in his eyes. He points toward the house.   SPIKE: Willow knew there was a chance that she'd come back wrong. So wrong that you'd have ... that she would have to get rid of what came back. And I wouldn't let her. If any part of that was Buffy, I wouldn't let her. And that's why she shut me out.  XANDER: What are you talking about? Willow wouldn't do that.  SPIKE: (sarcastic) Oh. Is that right.  XANDER: Look. You're just covering. Don't tell me you're not happy. (Spike scoffs) Look me in the eyes, and tell me when you saw Buffy alive, that wasn't the happiest moment of your entire existence.   Spike gives Xander a ""you just don't get it"" scowl, turns and walks off.   SPIKE: (as he walks) That's the thing about magic. There's always consequences.   SPIKE: Always!       She starts walking again. Spike follows.   SPIKE: A man can change.   She again stops walking and faces him.   BUFFY: You're not a man. You're a thing.   She turns away again. Spike frowns, grabs her shoulder.   SPIKE: Stop walking away.  BUFFY: Don't touch me!   As Spike turns her around she punches him with her other hand. He pulls back and backhands her. Buffy falls to the ground.   Spike looks surprised, puts his hand tentatively to his head with the beginning of a smile. Looks at Buffy, who is still getting to her feet and has her back to him.   SPIKE: Ahh, ahh, ohh! (grabs his head)   Buffy gets up, backhands Spike and he goes down. He gets up to a kneeling position with his back to Buffy and stays there, looking at the ground. She speaks to his back.   BUFFY: You're a thing. An evil, disgusting, thing.    (Talking about the chip not working on Buffy when he hit her back)   SPIKE: Nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with her.       SPIKE: Came back a little less human than you were.   The episode before Tara does her tests.   BUFFY: Order something or go.  SPIKE: Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust. Damn fluorescent lights. Plus they make me look dead...  Buffy refuses to react to that.  SPIKE (cont'd): Some demons love 'em. The way they vibrate, makes their skin twitch. That the kind of demon you are, love?  BUFFY: I'm not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but I'm not a demon.  SPIKE: Oh, I see. That why you took this job? Prove something to yourself? A normal job for a normal girl. Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.  BUFFY: I'll be fine.   At this point Spike genuinely thinks that Buffy ""came back wrong"". There is no reason for him to think otherwise within the confines of his experience. Magic always has a price.  In season five Spike used the test of being able to hit someone without pain to prove that Tara was fully human.   MR. MACLAY: Evil is evil.  ANYA: Well, let's just narrow it down. (Xander nods)  SPIKE: Ohhh. (looks around) Why don't I make this simple.   Spike walks forward and taps Tara on the shoulder. When she turns, he punches her in the face.   Both Tara and Spike reel backwards in pain. Tara grabs her nose, Spike his head.   SPIKE: Oww!!  WILLOW: (angry) Hey! (suddenly realizing) Hey...  TARA: (both hands over her face) He hit my nose!  WILLOW: And it hurt! Uh, him, I mean.   Tara looks at her in surprise.   BUFFY: (to Mr. Maclay) And that only works on humans. (Willow smiles)  SPIKE: There's no demon in there. That's just a family legend, am I right? (Mr. Maclay looks angry) Just a bit of spin to keep the ladies in line. (smirks) Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you.  TARA: (softly, to Willow) I'm not a demon.  WILLOW: (smiling) You're not a demon.  TARA: He hurt my nose.  WILLOW: Aw.  SPIKE: (still rubbing his forehead) Yeah, you're welcome. (Stalks off)    Spike telling her she came back wrong in ""Smashed"" was not him being manipulative, it was his way of standing up for himself against the “you’re an evil undead soulless thing with no real feelings”. He was telling her that if that’s what he is to her then she is no better."
buffy,2w6wwr,cakebatter,5,Tue Feb 17 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Great compilation of moments. I think you're right that Spike genuinely thought there was something ""wrong"" with her, but that doesn't mean he wasn't manipulating her. He was pulling every string he could think of to isolate her."
buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,5,Tue Feb 17 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"Due to the shock of being back from the dead, and her deepened depression that started in season five, Buffy had been isolating herself from her friends and family."
buffy,2w6wwr,cakebatter,2,Tue Feb 17 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that she was depressed and many people self-isolate when they're suffering from depression.  I don't think Spike was solely responsible for that.  And in his own way he certainly cared about Buffy, but that doesn't absolve him from manipulating her.  He certainly did all he could to be close her, as he had been trying to do for a long time.  For years he had been pushing boundaries that she always had to firmly reform on him, and in her state of depression he kept pushing and pushed his way through."
buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,2,Tue Feb 17 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"Before ""Dead Things"" was there any evidence of attempted isolation?   Yes, in ""Smashed"" during a tense conversation he says:   SPIKE: (yells) It's only a matter of time before you realize I'm the only one here for you, pet. You got no one else!   There are two distinct instances of what could be considered manipulation by Spike in season six. The first was the above quote from ""Smashed"". The second would be this scene from ""Dead Things"".   Buffy smiles widely and watches the others go out onto the dance floor. They begin to dance, having lots of fun.  Buffy's smile slowly fades and she looks pensive.  Cut to Buffy walking over to the bar. She puts her empty cup on the bar and waits for the bartender a moment, then changes her mind, turns and walks away, leaving the cup behind. By the way, she is wearing a white sleeveless blouse and a short lacy black skirt.  Buffy goes to the stairs and begins climbing toward the balcony. The swing music fades away to a slower, sad piece.  The balcony is basically deserted. Buffy leans on the railing and looks down. Shot of the dance floor full of happy dancing people, including the Scoobies.  Buffy watches them, with a sad smile.  SPIKE: (O.S.) You see ... you try to be with them...  Spike walks up behind Buffy.  SPIKE: ...but you always end up in the dark ... (whispering in her ear) ...with me.  He moves up right behind Buffy, looks where she's looking. Shot of the Scoobies from Buffy's POV.  SPIKE: What would they think of you ... if they found out ... all the things you've done?  He puts his hand on her bare shoulder and strokes slowly down her arm.  SPIKE: If they knew ... who you really were?  His hand moves down to her elbow and then farther down, out of shot.  Close on Buffy's face.  BUFFY: (whispers) Don't.  SPIKE: Stop me.  Close on Spike's hand as it travels down Buffy's thigh. Close on Buffy's face as she closes her eyes. Close on Spike's hand pulling her skirt up. Close on Buffy's face as she breathes heavily in pleasure. Close on Spike's face making a similar expression of pleasure and looking at Buffy's face. Close on Buffy's face still with her eyes closed.  Wider shot of the two of them from the waist up. Spike gives a strong thrust and they both gasp slightly. Buffy still has her eyes closed. Spike leans in to look at her face.  SPIKE: No ... don't close your eyes.  She opens her eyes.  SPIKE: Look at them.  Shot of the Scoobies dancing on, oblivious.  SPIKE: That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.  Close shot on Spike's face as he continues moving slowly and talking into Buffy's ear.  SPIKE: Look at your friends ... and tell me ... you don't love getting away with this... (Buffy still watching her friends) ...right under their noses.  Close on Buffy's face as she looks down at her friends.    SPIKE: You all right?  BUFFY: You need to leave me alone. You're not a part of my life...  Spike's own spite surfaces. Sick and tired.  SPIKE: Fine, then. But I hope you don't  think this antidote's gonna rid  you of that nasty martyrdom. See,  I figured it out, luv. You can't  help yourself. You're not drawn  to the dark like I thought.  You're addicted to the misery.  Buffy passes away any anger, too tired. No longer caring.  SPIKE (cont'd): It's why you won't tell your pals  about us. Might actually have to  be happy if you did. They'd  either understand and help, God  forbid, or drive you out where you  can finally be at peace in the  dark. With me. (then) Either way you'd be better off.  But you're too twisted for that.  ON BUFFY - staring at Spike. Her eyes seemingly devoid of emotion, but she's listening. Considering.  SPIKE (O.S.): Let yourself live already. Stop  with the bloody hero trip for a  sec. We'll all be the better for it.  Spike shakes his head. Giving up.  SPIKE: Cause I'm done with it. You  either tell your friends about  us... or I will.   ""Spike was mistaken in that he thought that she was living in a state of denial about not loving or caring for him. That her conflicted behavior towards him was because of that, and not from her deepened depression from being brought back, or guilt for using someone selfishly. It wasn't until he gained a soul that he was able to figure out why she had been behaving the way she was.""   BUFFY: So I'm thinking, sleeping with you...  BUFFY: (cont'd) They'll deal.  Spike watches her go then drops the Second Vamp. The vamp reacts with surprise at being free, then takes off running at Buffy's retreating back, fangs bared.  SPIKE: (calling after her) In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?  The Second Vamp can't help looking back at Spike at that. Buffy turns around, calmly STAKES the Second Vamp.  She keeps walking away as he dusts, and says:  BUFFY: Because I don't love you.  SPIKE: (to himself) Like Hell.    SPIKE: I'm feeling honest with myself. You used me.  BUFFY: Yes.  SPIKE: You told me that, of course. I never understood it though. Not until now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.  BUFFY: You figured that out just now?  SPIKE: Soul's not all about moonbeams  and penny whistles, luv. (pause)  It's about self-loathing I get it. Had to travel around the world, but I understand you now. I understand the violence inside.  BUFFY: Violence. (pause) William the Bloody now has insight  into violence.  SPIKE: Not the same. (beat)  Bad as I was, as evil and as wretched  as I was, I never truly hated myself  back then.  (pause) Not like I do now.    And in his own way he certainly cared about Buffy   As much as he was able to while lacking a soul. Spike was patterning himself after Buffy's morality and behavior as a guide for how he should act. This is why he darkened when she did after the musical. When he attempted to covertly court her in season five he was holding open doors for her and wearing clothes he thought she might approve of.   He certainly did all he could to be close her   He tried to send her away from him in ""OMWF"" and ""Gone""."

buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"And it's not very healthy.  His love for Drusilla is weird, obsessive, kind of father/protector-y, and deeply possessive.   Spike is by nature submissive when he thinks he is in love with both Drusilla and Buffy.  I agree that vampires being in love is in large part possessive or obsessive.   BuffyBot: Spike, I can't help myself. I love you.   Spike: You're mine, Buffy.    William: Why did you...? You knew. You knew she was mine. (ATS “Destiny”)   Angel and Spike both show signs of continued obsession with Buffy even after being ensouled. Angel hires people to follow Buffy at a distance to keep an eye on her in Angel season five.   By the by, I've already discussed how vampire feeding habits are sexual in nature and are a form of implied/alluded to sexual violence.  So in a way, Spike’s always had a sexual obsession with her.  It’s just that the form of desire for consumption transforms over time.  Previously he was obsessed with literally consuming her flesh in an eating way; eventually he wants to consume her flesh in a sexual way.  And, fun fact, the shift really happens when he is no longer capable of actually eating flesh.   Spike does not feed off of Nikki Wood, and we don’t see Spike do more than rip the throat out of the Chinese Slayer, ingesting a small amount of her blood from the initial bite. So with slayers he is not thinking “food” or “victim”, he is challenging a fighter more powerful than himself who hunts his own kind. “I'm the thing that monsters have nightmares about. -Buffy""  The shift really begins after interference from Willow and Faith, causing his perspective of her to begin to change. He stays in the proximity of Sunnydale because of wanting to get the chip out. His frequent interactions with the slayer, which are often unpleasant for both parties, causes him to feel this:    Spike: Just tell me what you want.  Drusilla: I want the Slayer dead, Spike.  Spike: You're the one who keeps bringing her up! I haven't said a word about the bloody Slayer since we left California! She's on the other side of the planet, Dru! Gone from our lives forever!  Drusilla: But you're lying, I can still see her. Floating all around you. Laughing. Why don't you push her away?  Spike: But I did, Pet. I did if for you! And you're still punishing me, you think I don't know what's going on with you?    Drusilla: You can't blame a girl, Spike, you're all covered with her. I look at you, all I see is the Slayer.    Spike: You don't understand! I can't get rid of her; she's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!    Spike: End my torment -- seeing you every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around. Take me out of a world that's got you in it. (suddenly shouting) KILL ME!   It is only after he has a dream about her that he develops what starts as a mild crush that builds during season five.  Drusilla and Spike walk in on Buffy in Spike’s crypt, and Drusilla tasers her twice. He then tasers Drusilla and chains them both up, which is wrong. Buffy is right to dis-invite him from her house.  Buffy has no more right to be going through Spike’s home when he’s not there, then he does going into her house without permission. She often barges into his crypt without notice and physically hurts him without good reason like in “Fool for Love”, ""Blood Ties"" and “Real Me”.  Now about the robot. Spike knows about love spells and various forms of magic. He is shown doing magic in season two. Spike wanted Buffy’s attention. She turns him down repeatedly. His response to this is not using magic to force her into a relationship like “Something Blue”, magically roofing her like Warren did Katrina, or using a pharmaceutical to make her more susceptible to him.He could have chained her up and used her body without setting the chip off if he had wanted to. Buffy suggesting this actually angered him in “Crush”.   BUFFY: The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.  SPIKE: (puzzled) Oh, what... (makes a face of extreme frustration) Ohh!   Instead of any of these options he has a robot made. It is programed differently than April. The Buffybot is more than just a sexbot. It was programed as a companion that he could talk to and fight alongside with. Considering all of his options, and him being a soulless vampire, the choice Spike made is one of the least harmful to Buffy herself especially since he had never planned for her to find out. None of that would make Buffy feel any less gross about it when she found out about the robot’s existence, as is her right. It’s interesting to note that Spike treated the Buffybot better than Buffy treated the real Spike in season six. Things might have been better for everyone if she had just used a robot instead of a real person.   Spike pretty much exemplifies the idea of a “Nice Guy” who expects that once he does enough nice things for Buffy, he’ll be able to have her.  Pretty messed up, but let’s keep going.       SPIKE: I know you'll never love me.  Buffy pauses halfway up the stairs, turns back to look at Spike.  SPIKE: I know that I'm a monster. But you treat me like a man. And that's...   Spike does many nice things for Dawn, Buffy and even Tara without expecting reciprocation. He didn't expect anything from Buffy for not telling Glory about the Key or for protecting Dawn when she wanders around by herself at night. He would socialize with Joyce separate from Buffy.   XANDER: You have got to be kidding.  SPIKE: (sighs) I'm not going in.  XANDER: And you're not leaving those.  Shot of Spike's hand holding the flowers.  XANDER: You actually think you're gonna score points with Buffy this way?  SPIKE: This isn't about Buffy. (walks closer)  XANDER: Bull. We're all hip to your doomed obsession.  SPIKE: They're for Joyce.  XANDER: Like you care about her.  Spike sighs angrily. Willow steps between them.  WILLOW: Guys, guys, not here.  SPIKE: Care? Joyce was the only one of the lot of you that I could stand.  XANDER: And she's the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag. I'm touched.  SPIKE: I liked the lady. Understand, monkey boy? She was decent. (Xander and Willow exchange a look) She didn't put on airs. She always had a nice cuppa for me.  Willow looks sympathetic.  SPIKE: And she never treated me like a freak.  XANDER: Her mistake.  SPIKE: (scoffs) Think what you want.  He throws the flowers to the ground and stomps off.  XANDER: Un ... believable.  Willow looks at Xander, bends to pick up the flowers.  XANDER: The guy thinks he can put on a big show and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.  WILLOW: (looking at flowers) Xander... (he looks at her) He didn't leave a card.  Xander stares in the direction Spike went, looking surprised. Willow looks sad.    He may care specifically about Buffy or Dawn, but that’s a value he’s assigning to them as individuals, not because they’re human.     I agree."
buffy,2w6wwr,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Feb 19 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with just about everything you said about Spike and Buffy and their relationship. :)  Except possibly this:   Angel and Spike both show signs of continued obsession with Buffy even after being ensouled. Angel hires people to follow Buffy at a distance to keep an eye on her in Angel season five.   About Angel, I absolutely agree that he has a moderately unhealthy obsession with Buffy even when he has a soul. But I'm not so sure about Spike.   He begins to work with Buffy and the Scoobies again because he ""knows what's coming."" He's certainly jealous of Principal Wood to an extent, but he also seems willing to bow out gracefully. He even suggests to Buffy that he should leave, and she stops him (""because I'm not ready to have you not be here"").   When he talks about how she was ""his,"" he's talking to Angel, and it's fairly understandable that he would want some kind of respect shown to the fact that they were in a relationship. It doesn't strike me as extremely possessive. He also chooses to stay in L.A. rather than chase after Buffy in some belief that they were meant to be or that she's ""his."" Which he could have done, since after all there is no curse that prevents him from being happy, and the last time she spoke to him she said that she loved him.  I don't see his actions as being at all on the same level of what Angel does."
buffy,2w6wwr,defeasiblefee,-1,Fri Feb 20 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to prove with your compilation? That Spike wasn't attempting to manipulate Buffy at all? What about his constant lurking in the shadows waiting for whenever Buffy tried to get a minute alone, so that he could be alone with her? It's pretty clear that Buffy was depressed and confused and hated herself, and Spike capitalized on that in great form."
buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,2,Wed Feb 18 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to prove with your compilation? That Spike wasn't attempting to manipulate Buffy at all?    No, I listed all his manipulative behavior from season six.   What about his constant lurking in the shadows waiting for whenever Buffy tried to get a minute alone, so that he could be alone with her?    Do you mean when she told him she was in heaven? He wasn’t expecting her to come out the back door and tried to leave her and she said he could stay. He is allowed to hang around to a degree, he had become part of their group while Buffy was gone. It seems that the whole “lurking in the shadows” is a vampire thing in general. Angel did a lot of it with and without a soul in season one and two.    Buffy was depressed and confused and hated herself   Spike as a vampire was not able to understand that, which he admitted when he got a soul. This is only one reason you should not have a ""romantic"" relationship with a un-souled vampire."
buffy,2w6wwr,clockworklycanthrope,2,Wed Feb 18 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"that doesn't absolve him from manipulating her   Sure. What does absolve him is that he didn't have a soul and was literally without a moral compass. Just like we can't blame Angel for Angelus' actions, we likewise can't blame ensouled Spike for the actions (however damaging) he may have taken without a soul. I mean, of course soulless Spike did some shitty stuff. Honestly, it's kind of impressive he didn't do more shitty stuff because, let's be real here, no way in hell a measly chip would stop Angelus from hurting people. You just know that guy would be talking people to death and messing with their minds for the fun of it 24/7.  Edit: Typo."
buffy,2w6wwr,cakebatter,1 point,Wed Feb 18 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"I pretty strongly disagree with this for a couple of reasons.  Okay, so you can’t necessarily hold re-ensouled Spike responsible for his soulless behavior (though FTR, Angel spent like a century feeling guilty about shit Angelus did, and soul-Spike felt guilty for things soulless-Spike did, so that’s worth considering), but you can hold soulless Spike responsible for the shit soulless Spike did.  And we’re talking about how soulless Spike was manipulative/abusive.   AND, Spike has been interacting with the Scoobies for years at this point, and desperately trying to ingratiate himself further into the group.  It's not like he has some excuse of not understanding human behavior.  Time and again he wanted to be considered on a level worth of human interaction, so yeah, you don't have to absolve him of those actions."
buffy,2w6wwr,clockworklycanthrope,2,Wed Feb 18 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"So, I just realized I read this comment wrong, and I deleted my response to post a more accurate one. Bear with me.  To some degree, soulless Spike can be held accountable but, in the past, vampires have been described as animals. Are you going to be angry with a bear for eating somebody? No. It's a bear. It does what it does.  When Spike is without a soul, he is a demon. He has a human personality, but he is a demon. He can see people doing things that are ""good,"" but he has a really difficult time personally understanding; he thinks he gets it, but he's wrong. A good is example happens in episode 5x11, ""Triangle."" Spike thinks Buffy will be impressed that he's not feeding off of bleeding disaster victims. He wants to do this, but doesn't because he knows she ""won't like it."" Buffy, of course, is repulsed by the idea that Spike could even think of doing something so odious. Spike, however, cannot comprehend why this would be so. Buffy is a stand-in for his moral compass. He tries to do things she would want for him, but cannot complete grasp the actual meaning of these actions.  So, yeah, he was super horrible, but why would we expect anything else of him? Honestly, the audience was wrong to think that Spike, by masquerading as a human really was one. He wasn't. Like Buffy tells him in season five, ""you're like a serial killer in prison."""
buffy,2w6wwr,cakebatter,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not angry with a bear, but if a bear is rampaging through neighborhoods and killing people then we put it down, we don't say, ""oh that's just its nature!""  I'm saying it's okay to hold soulless Spike accountable for his soulless actions, just like I would be okay with a bear who has lost their fear of humans and is eating them facing the consequences of their actions (which is sadly being killed).  Although Buffy says there's no ""you"" left when you become a vampire, there's definitely evidence the demon is based at least somewhat in your personally. Plus there's this exchange in Doppelgangland, when Willow is weirded out by her vampire-equivalent:   BUFFY: Just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do with the person it was. ANGEL: Well, actually --(off Buffy's glare)-- that's a good point.   And though Spike is a demon, there's tons of stuff in the Buffyverse that basically says big whoop. There's Anya, Clem, Lorne, lots of other demons who are closer to humans than pure evil demons. And in Angel there's mention that vampires are even more human than other demons.  So basically, I get that Spike is morally handicapped as a soulless vampire, but that doesn't mean soulless Spike wasn't abusive or that soulless Spike is unaccountable for his actions."
buffy,2w6wwr,clockworklycanthrope,2,Thu Feb 19 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure. I'm not saying there should never be any consequences for a soulless vampire's actions, and I certainly don't think everybody should just put up with it or something because it's his nature. I'm just saying it's not really much of a shock and, really, should've been pretty expected. I mean, pretty much the very first thing Spike did after the Scoobies helped him in season four was turn against them to help Adam.   And, of course the vampire's personality is shaped by the person who originally inhabited the body. In the quote from Buffy I shared, she acknowledged that the demon will have all the memories of the body's original inhabitant. What gets sucked out is the soul--something that, in the Buffyverse, provides the ability to understand morality in a complete sense.  As for other demons, there's no reason at all to believe no demons have souls. Certainly, nothing Lorne ever did indicated he was soulless; I imagine he'd be insulted if someone suggested that he was. In fact, I'd argue that vengeance demons have to have souls to be able to do their job--to detect and understand those who have been wronged. All we know for sure is that vampires don't, and that the vampire creation process involves the removal of the human soul."
buffy,2w6wwr,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:32:28 2015 UTC,"What gets sucked out is the soul--something that, in the Buffyverse, provides the ability to understand morality in a complete sense.   Exactly. Vampirism is not possession, it is transformation. If the soul was left after the transformation, vampires would not be as willing to create havoc and feed off humans as they are without one. Which was the whole purpose of infecting a human with the blood of a pure vampiric demon in the first place. Vampires are often referred to as hybrids and half-breeds by other demons in both Buffy and Angel.  It's still the same person they were before they became a vampire. Only now they crave the blood of humans and have no objection to taking it. It is this that makes slaying newly transformed vampires morally not objectionable. They are going to feed off someone and possibly turn others, it’s only a matter of time. So preemptive action must be taken."
buffy,2w6wwr,cakebatter,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, I completely agree that Angelus would have been just as dangerous with a chip as without, but he's a completely different person from Spike.  Spike had established (before even losing his chip) that he was more hedonistic and interested in things like fighting, fucking, and feeding.  He likes violence, sex, and food.  He doesn't care so much about some big cause, and isn't super passionate about inflicting the best or most perfect pain on his victims.  He just likes being content and living in the moment.  That's why it's so easy for him to side with the Scoobies once he has the chip.  It's easily in his best interest and there aren't really any ""moral"" scruples preventing him from doing so.  Angelus would probably chose to starve over working for the Slayer."
buffy,2w6wwr,feminaprovita,2,Wed Feb 18 21:30:40 2015 UTC,"That was an excellent compilation, thank you! I actually do feel like I understand the concept better, of Spike thinking Buffy came back ""wrong."" Plus, it was a pleasant walk down memory lane. :)"

buffy,2w6wwr,yallcat,7,Wed Feb 18 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"I always felt that Spike was using ""wrong"" as a way to blanket-describe all the differences between Buffy post-rise and Buffy the way she was before that. Post-rise Buffy is depressed, even more alienated  from the people around her, more morally grey than before, and she has been through the dark-magic wringer. Either the magic that brought her back altered Buffy so that she isn't entirely human anymore-- thus making Spike able to hit her-- or that Slayer death-wish he mentioned a while back is catching up with her and that is why he can hit her. After all, he can clearly get rough if the person he's getting rough with wants him to, and at this point I think it's safe to say that Buffy considers having been dead her quiet time.   It's also of note that while Spike is goading Buffy here, calling her ""wrong"", it's clear that he considers himself to be ""wrong"" as well,  and that they can only fit together if they're both all fucked up inside. This is because Spike isn't ready to be responsible or accountable yet and it's easier to bring Buffy ""down to his level"" instead of trying to better himself (as he does later) to try to be worthy of her."
buffy,2w6wwr,excultist,2,Tue Feb 17 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"He was just taking advantage of the situation (being able to hurt her despite the chip, having a surface explanation) to manipulate her into bangs."

I would have to describe it as a red herring.  By the end of the series, we could see nothing wrong about Buffy.

The First Evil could not be killed but could appear in the form of any dead person, to torment the living; a vast army of super-powerful vampires was assembled in the Hellmouth waiting to be released, the Watcher's Council was blown up by the bringers, Buffy gets thrown out of her own house by rebellious slayers-in-training.  It was just depressing.  Even so, I did enjoy the grand finale at the end.  As for the continuation of the series in comic book form, I have not read it.  Maybe someday."

buffy,2w6wwr,Chas420,2,Thu Feb 19 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it was never explained because Tara proved it false. Spike had a hypothesis, it was wrong, and they didn't talk any more about it because it was incorrect and therefore didn't impact the continuing plot.   Think about it this way: during OMWF, Anya suggests the perpetrators may be bunnies. A curious audience member might wonder just how exactly she thinks bunnies may be causing people to burst into song. However, the gang soon learns that the real perpetrator is Sweet, a demon, so they don't spend any more time talking about Anya's now obviously incorrect bunny theory. It might still be interesting to talk about, but the fact that they know it was incorrect means it doesn't really have any relation to the plot, so there's no real reason to bring it up again."

buffy,2w5xdm,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Feb 17 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Steve Tartalia also really hurt doing the fall into bricks in - ""The Gift,"" I think?   Yeah, it sounds like Steve got pretty bloodied up by it.   (2001 Australia con) I don’t do all my own stunts, I do about seventy percent of my stunts. I come from stage, so, on stage you don’t get a stuntman to come in. So I know basic hand to hand combat, basic broadsword, fencing, dagger, stuff like that. But there are people who are much better than I am – Steve Tartalia is the stunt Spike. The rule of the show basically is if my feet are on the ground, it’s me—so if I’m flying around with a big Kung Fu move or bouncing off the wall and hit the guy, that’s Steve Tartalia, who is a maniac and does not know the word safety. He freaks people out all the time. There’s a bit that you guys are gonna see at the end of the season when Spike takes a big fall, and it had to be cut with the best stunt fall guy in all Hollywood. There are only three guys that’ll take a hundred and seventy foot fall and we got the best guy to do it, but it also has to cut with Steve taking a six foot fall, onto concrete. I mean they gave him a couple of foam bricks where- I would say five, maybe. And he—most guys would try to like not jump so high… he took it off a chair like this [demonstrates] jumped up, kipped and then went flat, so he went six feet up in the air and then straight down on his face. Right? And then me, I get down on my knees and I do this [gets on knees and slumps forward, looking weedy] And the embarrassing thing is like all the whole crew is like ‘Oh, great stunt James, we’re so glad you’re not hurt’. While Steve’s bleeding in the corner. Really- one time in Crush when Buffy decks Spike and Spike takes it straight into the uh, there’s a vanity there… Steve just [struggles to explain] frapped his face against the cave wall, I mean it was just blood all over the place, and he was lying on the floor and the director and producer are talking- bringing me over and start talking to me about the new shot as they just carried him away. I’m just ‘stop, man—he’s hurt’ and he’s all [macho] ‘no, guys, I’m okay. I’m fine, get me the superglue’. That superglue is what stuntmen use instead of bandages, they superglue their faces back together so they can get back in the shot. I figured out that stunt guys get hurt all the time, they just don’t admit it. They always say ‘I’m fine, I’m fine’ and then they go off by themselves and collapse. I’m kind of the same way because I like to do my own stunts, and if I get hurt they don’t trust me to do the stunts, so once I did this- the stunt guys, they got into- they understood that I would not complain if they tagged me, or if I get hurt I’m not gonna tell anybody that I’m hurt. Suddenly they start pulling out all these potions and salves from Asia, and all of this secret medicine that keeps you going, and so I’ve been let into the internal world of stuntguys and—those guys work hard, they’re maniacs.     On another note ... why would an interviewer ask someone's favorite curse word, and then activate ""censormode""?   Some of the end questions were a bit odd. :)"

buffy,2w6326,TheBlueDanNoob,4,Tue Feb 17 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"""So... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?""  /u/AngelAmongUs already gave the right answer, so everyone else should go for the funniest wrong answer."
buffy,2w6326,barre_chord_reality,4,Tue Feb 17 08:10:23 2015 UTC,I love (and hate) how true this show stays to its commitments.
buffy,2w6326,barre_chord_reality,2,Tue Feb 17 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS WARNING: Well come on, Willow was happy with Tara, until Tara left, but then she was happy again, until Tara died, but then she was happy-ish again with Kennedy ..."
buffy,2w6326,barre_chord_reality,2,Tue Feb 17 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Many, many spoilers.   Willow was happy with OZ, then found out he was a Werewolf.  Even then they were happy together until he left. She obviously met Tara after OZ, but we all know how that turned out.   Buffy dated one Vampire, then a guy who seemed to be a regular guy, but was part of some kind of top secret government boogie monster fighter builder organization. After Riley, she sort of dated another vampire.   Xander dated Cordy, who turned left Sunnydale and later turned into some kind of Godess. He later dated a girl who used to be vengeance demon and pissed her off.    So yeah, none of them had very productive relationships. Even when the potential for happiness was there, things happened. :("
buffy,2w6326,Scendo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:54:29 2015 UTC,Buffy dated Spike? More like CWB - co-workers with benefits.
buffy,2w6326,barre_chord_reality,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:17:42 2015 UTC,"I was going to say abused, but it was sort of mutual in its own screwed up way. It was some kind of relationship, toxic or not."
buffy,2w0dqj,GinaZaneburritos,26,Sun Feb 15 21:53:53 2015 UTC,Xander is now older than Giles was when the show began.  Wut.
buffy,2w0dqj,MoonSpider,12,Mon Feb 16 01:32:39 2015 UTC,And Oz is now the same age as Buffy's mom was when the show began :)

buffy,2w0dqj,clockworklycanthrope,20,Mon Feb 16 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, Eliza and Mercedes were so young! I'm especially amazed at Eliza Duskhu's ability to carry a role that complicated at such a young age."
buffy,2w0dqj,clockworklycanthrope,11,Sun Feb 15 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like the dynamic between Charisma and Mercedes must've been really odd. Here's Charisma, a 26 year old pretending to be a sophomore in high school, and Mercedes, who plays her best friend, is an actual sophomore in high school."
buffy,2w0dqj,CJGibson,6,Mon Feb 16 02:38:14 2015 UTC,Exactly my thought. Especially mild Angel spoiler
buffy,2w0dqj,MoonSpider,11,Mon Feb 16 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"At least she's a vampire, by then. Even though Mercedes was aging too, I could always sort of explain away the Cordelia/Harmony age gap in later seasons by saying ""well, she's a vampire now, so she's stopped aging."" Obviously, that wasn't the REAL reason, but it was sort of fun to think about it that way. :D"
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,11,Mon Feb 16 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"Ohhh! Harmony's a vampire! That's why she - oh my God, I'm so embarrassed. All this time I thought she ...   ... was actually so much younger. :)"
buffy,2w0dqj,JangoF76,7,Mon Feb 16 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"No no, you see.  Mercedes McNab is a vampire."

buffy,2w0dqj,barre_chord_reality,-1,Mon Feb 16 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"Actually I didn't see much change after S2- in s-1 her face was stilla little sort of big-looking. (She was almost hideous in Addams Family Values, and adult face ona little girl's ehad and body.)"
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,15,Tue Feb 17 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Charisma was not a very convincing 16-year-old. Surprised about Eliza and Mercedes though."
buffy,2w0dqj,magickmidget,9,Mon Feb 16 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"Well, true :) Nicholas Brendon wasn't a very convincing 16-year-old either, as well as being far too good-looking to be that unattractive to girls.  I'm kind of surprised they didn't dress Cordelia down more often. She looked way too put-together for someone in high school, even granting that she was supposed to be the ""hot, popular one."""
buffy,2w0dqj,AngryWizard,5,Mon Feb 16 03:24:03 2015 UTC,An interesting fact is that Eliza was an emancipated minor.There are conflicting reports on whether it was at 13 or 17.
buffy,2w0dqj,AngryWizard,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"By the time she was on Angel, she was 30ish. They basically ported her character over to Angel as an adult, which was fitting, since the show dealt with more adult themes than Buffy did."
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Tribut eto her talent she came as close as she did to pulling it off, IMNSHO"
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,11,Tue Feb 17 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"...Spike is older than my dad. Spike, is older, than my dad.  Although I guess technically, being in his 100s, Spike was always older than my dad."
buffy,2w0dqj,deets19,7,Mon Feb 16 08:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you to /u/AngryWizard and /u/bright_ephemera for the data collection and organization! I thought this list was pretty cool, and it was last posted nearly two years ago, so I thought maybe there were many who hadn't seen it.  I'd looked up most of the actors' ages before, but I had never bothered to look up Cordelia's or Jenny's, so this was kind of surprising. And, in retrospect, totally believable."
buffy,2w0dqj,AngelAmongUs,5,Sun Feb 15 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"I must admit, I'm pretty obsessed with this list and had considered updating it with the new 'Age Now' stat but never got around to it. Still fascinating a year later."
buffy,2w0dqj,deets19,6,Sun Feb 15 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"That's a good point; the ""ages now"" will be off by 1-2 years. Oh well.  Yes, this list is awesome! So glad you put it together. :) When I'm bored, I search random topics in the subreddit, and this was one of the threads that was most interesting. I was happy to find it."
buffy,2w0dqj,Sammyboy616,6,Sun Feb 15 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"August 2nd 2013 was the date I added their age at the time, so yeah, need to mentally add about a year and a half to get their current ages.   I found Faith, Cordelia and Jenny to be the most surprising; it can make the group dynamics interesting during rewatches if I stop to think about it for a moment."
buffy,2w0dqj,CJGibson,3,Mon Feb 16 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"Huh, I always knew Eliza Dushku was really young in Buffy. They mention her age in one of the season 3 commentaries, and especially in her first few episodes she looks incredibly young under all that dark makeup. SMG looks really young, too, but I always thought Faith looked younger than Buffy.  But yes, the ages of these three make several interactions in season 3 interesting. ""And you teach psychology? I take psychology"" (are you sure?) and ""first word 'jail', second word 'bait'"" :)  I'd be interested to see a list like this for Angel. It always seemed to me that Angel was more about adults than young adults, and the actors' ages seem like it'd work out that way.  I have no idea how old I thought Jenny (the character) was - probably early thirties? Younger than Giles, but not that much younger."
buffy,2w0dqj,deets19,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"Since Cordy was likely 18 already when wes showed up, with a Feb. b'day, not totally accruate"
buffy,2w0dqj,barre_chord_reality,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:14:53 2015 UTC,And her boyfriend just turned 29. Good for both of 'em.
buffy,2w0dqj,magickmidget,6,Tue Feb 17 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. I wonder if Michelle Trachtenberg's age when she started on the show is why she always seemed so young to me? She and Eliza were pretty much the only actors playing high school characters while they were actually high-school-aged (kinda SMG, but she was still 19-playing-16)."
buffy,2w0dqj,TheBlueDanNoob,7,Mon Feb 16 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"I think it was a matter of perspective. The other characters treated her younger than they would have tolerated themselves in season one and two. Dawn is viewed through the lens of the older main characters. If Joyce or Giles had been the focus of the show, Buffy would have seemed younger to the audience too.  It is because of this perspective that people would have probably been creeped out if Angel had developed an interest in Dawn in season five or six, even though that is the age that he started to develop an interest in Buffy."
buffy,2w0dqj,TheBlueDanNoob,4,Mon Feb 16 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"That's true. The older characters also spend a lot of time trying to shield her from the supernatural stuff, when at her age they were actively fighting it, so she reads younger."
buffy,2w0dqj,magickmidget,2,Mon Feb 16 02:53:03 2015 UTC,It's probably also got a lot to do with her being written as a 12 year old instead of a 14 year old for the first half of season 5.  (There were going to get someone younger until Michelle was cast).
buffy,2w0dqj,sylban,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think it was a matter of perspective.   There's more to it than that though.  We've been taught by television time and time again that high schoolers look like they're in their early 20s, because they always cast people who are in their twenties to play high schoolers.  Then when an actual teenager shows up it's really weird."
buffy,2w0dqj,feminaprovita,5,Mon Feb 16 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"And Mercedes McNab as Harmony :)  Yes, Michelle Trachtenberg was really young. And she grows a lot taller over seasons 5-7, which is always kind of fun to watch."
buffy,2w0dqj,oryomai1,3,Mon Feb 16 02:15:16 2015 UTC,Accurate! I'm in the middle of season six on my re-watch right now and it seems like she grows an inch every episode.
buffy,2w0dqj,dreucifer,1 point,Mon Feb 16 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"Aww, poor Dawnie. The character that grows physically, but not mentally. Her dialogue in season 6 and 7 is less sophisticated than it was in 5, and her character as a whole just kind of languishes until the show is over. :(   I think that the writers of the show wanted to show a compelling case of abandonment, and that's how they went about doing it."
buffy,2w0dqj,Lakz,5,Mon Feb 16 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"The character of Dawn was originally meant to be a few years younger. Then Michelle came in and Joss really liked her for the role. I imagine given the original plan for the character coupled with the fact that she is the baby of the family, it made it very easy to forget that she was only a year younger than Buffy was when she was called."
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,3,Mon Feb 16 08:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know Amy's real age compared with Jenny Calendar's, because of the lines in Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered:  Amy: ""Who made you queen of the world? Like, you're old enough to be.""  Jenny: ""Well what can I say? I guess Xander's too much man for the pimple squad."""
buffy,2w0dqj,DaddyCatALSO,6,Mon Feb 16 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"Ha! :) According to IMDB, Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy) was born on 11/18/1970. Robia LaMorte (Jenny) was born on 7/7/1970. So she was about ... four and a half months older?  I guess that's old enough to be ""Queen of the World"" :)"
buffy,2vzhj4,thisguy49,3,Sun Feb 15 17:28:28 2015 UTC,I whole-heartedly approve of the Revelation of the Daleks-style Colin Baker action figure you've got there.
buffy,2vzhj4,Interference22,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:50:15 2015 UTC,I got that at the same place I got my Buffy pop figures lol. Buffyverse and Whoverse are my two favorite shows so my merch must be set up together.

buffy,2w0yp3,boootista,10,Mon Feb 16 00:52:48 2015 UTC,I'll never tell
buffy,2w0yp3,madcowbomber,2,Mon Feb 16 09:04:36 2015 UTC,No matter how many times I see it the interplay in this song between Anya and Xander always makes me smile.
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:55:46 2015 UTC,"Joss once said that ""Under Your Spell"" is the dirtiest song he ever wrote, but I beg to differ. ""I'll Never Tell"" is downright filthy. And I love it!"
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,4,Wed Feb 18 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"Wait ... what? Why?  ""I'll Never Tell"" seems pretty PG to me, whereas ""Under Your Spell"" edges pretty close to R. I mean, I would be mildly uncomfortable watching ""Under Your Spell"" with my parents (or, at least, the ending of it) - Joss did say it was essentially porn - but I wouldn't feel the same way about ""I'll Never Tell."" It's such a throwback to old-style musical numbers, and except for the one ""penis"" line, I find it pretty tame."
buffy,2w0yp3,AngelAmongUs,3,Wed Feb 18 05:29:51 2015 UTC,"These are all the non PG things in ""I'll Never Tell"". One of which you already mentioned. :)   WARM IN THE NIGHT WHEN I'M RIGHT IN HER TIGHT (catches himself) --EMBRACE, TIGHT EMBRACE    ANYA: HIS PENIS GOT DISEASES FROM A CHUMASH TRIBE    XANDER: (looking her over) YOU'RE THE CUTEST OF THE SCOOBIES WITH YOUR LIPS AS RED AS RUBIES AND YOUR FIRM YET SUPPLE -- TIGHT EMBRACE...   ""Under Your Spell"" is the ""dirtiest"" though, and also the saddest."
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Feb 18 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the ""tight embrace"" thing is so subtle! :) I'd watched that song several times before it ever occurred to me. But true, that does make it more ""filthy,"" and I retract my astonishment.   Yes, well ... quite ... begins to clean glasses  ""Under Your Spell"" is far less subtle, IMO. Pretty much no other way to interpret what they're singing about and what's going on. For me that makes it much ""dirtier.""  P.S. /u/catdoctor, between this and the discussion a few days ago on /r/ANGEL If anyone cares, this is obviously an Angel spoiler you are starting to make me feel so naive :) Here I was thinking I was all grown-up and stuff! :)"
buffy,2w0yp3,AngelAmongUs,3,Wed Feb 18 05:49:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, well ... quite ... begins to clean glasses   Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we've written?"
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Feb 18 06:09:29 2015 UTC,Tell no one.
buffy,2w0yp3,AngelAmongUs,2,Wed Feb 18 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"""Under Your Spell"" is far less subtle, IMO. Pretty much no other way to interpret what they're singing about and what's going on. For me that makes it much ""dirtier.""   Absolutely.  What I've noticed some people miss on the first viewing of ""Under Your Spell"" is how Tara is singing about literally being under Willow's spell before she even knows about it.   TARA (cont'd) NOW I'M BATHED IN LIGHT SOMETHING JUST ISN'T RIGHT (turning to Willow) AM I UNDER YOUR SPELL   ...and when she finds out...   TARA: I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL GOD, HOW CAN THIS BE PLAYING WITH MY MEMORY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL WILLOW, DON'T YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NOTHING LEFT OF ME   This makes Tara feel violated, which she explains to Willow in ""Tabula Rasa""."
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,2,Wed Feb 18 06:03:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with being young and innocent. We all want to grow up so fast and here I am, middle-aged and jaded, just wishing I could remember what it was like to be naive."
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Wed Feb 18 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Not all that young, actually. Buffy Summers was one year ahead of me in high school :) I was on the young side for my grade, but still.  Reminds me of that exchange in ""What's My Line, Part I"": I might not be young forever, but I'll always be stupid innocent :)"
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,2,Thu Feb 19 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"So you graduated from high school in 2000?  I graduated in 1980. To m, you are young!"
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Feb 19 23:54:06 2015 UTC,Fair enough! :)

""You're the cutest of the Scoobies with your lips as red a rubies and your firm yet supple ... tight embrace."" ""His penis got diseases from the Shumach tribe."" Vs: ""you make me com...plete."" Maybe it's a toss-up."
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Feb 18 23:18:11 2015 UTC,It's not just the last line. Really this whole section:   The moon to the tide  I can feel you inside  I'm under your spell  Surging like the sea  Wanting you so helplessly  I break with every swell  Lost in ecstasy  Spread beneath my willow tree  You make me complete  You make me complete  You make me complete  You make me --   I'm with Joss; this is pretty pornographic.
buffy,2w0yp3,mouldy_cookie,10,Wed Feb 18 23:18:35 2015 UTC,Standing
buffy,2w0yp3,emdesch,8,Wed Feb 18 23:25:42 2015 UTC,Mine's either Walk Through the Fire or I'll Never Tell. Sooo catchy.
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,7,Mon Feb 16 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"Really? I find ""I'll Never Tell"" to be more of a retro-pastiche that's never going to be a breakaway pop hit.  :)"
buffy,2w0yp3,emdesch,3,Mon Feb 16 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"I really think I just love the back & forth between Xander and Anya. The song highlighted all of the previously unspoken issues in their relationship in a fairly lighthearted way, and them dancing around to it made it even better."
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Feb 17 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, no, I was mostly kidding. I love it too :) It's so light-hearted in tone, and I love the way it's choreographed.  Also, the exchange between Anya and Xander right before the singing and the dancing has always been one of my favorites:   Anya: Will you still make me waffles when we're married?  Xander: No, I'll only make them for myself, but by California law, you will own half of them."
buffy,2w0yp3,emdesch,2,Tue Feb 17 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"I'm awful at recognizing sarcasm, haha. But yes- that's one of my favorite things he ever said."
buffy,2w0yp3,Sammyboy616,2,Tue Feb 17 02:08:37 2015 UTC,I really hope I have an opportunity to use that line at some point in life.
buffy,2w0yp3,kaekit36,5,Tue Feb 17 02:12:29 2015 UTC,Parking Ticket. The end makes me laugh every time. IIRC you can't hear it much in the episode but I have the soundtrack with the full song. Two thumbs up.
buffy,2w0yp3,cnet14,6,Fri Feb 20 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"Is it bad that my favorite song actually was Anya's song (""Mrs."" I believe is the title) in the season 7 episode ""Selfless?"""
buffy,2w0yp3,DethFiesta,4,Mon Feb 16 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"Mine too. It's fantastic, plus the song in the context of the episode is one of the emotional highlights of the entire series for me."
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,2,Mon Feb 16 20:13:55 2015 UTC,The moment when it stops and they cut to Anya impaled on the wall. Chilling!
buffy,2w0yp3,DethFiesta,2,Mon Feb 16 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly.  The climax of the song interrupted to show her cruel ""death.""  That right there makes it the most Whedonesque of all the songs -- stabs you right in the heart just when your heart is soaring!"
buffy,2w0yp3,Ashton42,2,Wed Feb 18 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"because you're smiling. you're remembering how happy she was, that her flashback is to the nights around OMWF, and it's a fun little, completely unexpected treat, then....fuck...buffy just ran her through...right."
buffy,2w0yp3,sagemoss5,4,Wed Feb 18 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"I love the Standing/Under Your Spell piece with Tara and Giles both singing. They are both amazingly talented and the voices work well together. Plus how heartbreaking it is that they are both so hesitant to leave. Also, how can you not love I've Got A Theory. Bunnies aren't cute like everybody supposes."

buffy,2w0yp3,mushroom_planet,4,Tue Feb 17 15:31:09 2015 UTC,I think mine would be a tie between Rest in Peace and Walk Through the Fire. But I've got a Theory is pretty close.   Edit: I forgot about Standing. God Damn...I love them all.
buffy,2w0yp3,IRob92,5,Mon Feb 16 20:20:12 2015 UTC,Walk Through The Fire and the one Buffy sings after that (I forgot the name)
buffy,2w0yp3,GinaZaneburritos,3,Tue Feb 17 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"No love for ""Rest in Peace""? I don't know if it's my favorite, but I love that song :)  I went to WonderCon a few years ago, and there was a viewing of ""Once More, With Feeling"" in a huge auditorium with closed captions so that everyone could sing along (not that anyone needed the captions, as far as I could tell). Hundreds of people laughing and singing to this episode ... and I'll never forget how so many people swooned when Spike sings, ""You know / you've got a willing slave."" :)  It was an incredible experience. 10/10 would recommend to any Buffy fan if the opportunity arises."
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,4,Tue Feb 17 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"Close tie. I love how ""Standing"" plays with the words ""standing"","" and ""understanding."" I love how sad it is and how well Giles sings it. I love how beautifully it portrays both how Giles feels about Buffy and how he comes to his decision. I also love how it's staged, with Buffy moving in slow motion in the background as Giles sings in his own time bubble. But ""Walk Through the Fire"" is equally brilliant. It creates tension by bringing us over and over again to a word that rhymes with ""burn"" and then cutting the phrase short and starting a new verse before the rhyme is fulfilled. Once again, Joss's word play is sublime, using every possible meaning (literal and figurative) of words that have to do with fire, heat, burning, cold, freezing and ice.  Everyone expresses his/her thoughts and fears at once, but there is never a muddle. We even get laughs from Willow: ""I think this line's mostly filler"" and Anya: ""Beady-eyes is right; we're needed."" And, then, when all the voices are singing at once, we finally get the resolution to the rhyme as they sing ""burn"" in 8(?)-part harmony in a chord that is completely unexpected. As the fire engine speeds by.  Bloody brilliant!"
buffy,2w0yp3,AngryWizard,2,Tue Feb 17 01:14:10 2015 UTC,"Bloody brilliant!    Damn right it is! I'd read an entire post of your thoughts of every song on the album if this is what I'd have to look forward to. Thanks for sharing. I love Walk through the Fire, Standing, and the Standing/Under Your Spell reprise and cannot pick a favorite of the three."
buffy,2w0yp3,catdoctor,2,Mon Feb 16 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"Standing/Under Your Spell is also wonderful. Amber and Tony's voices blend so well. I love Tara's lyrics because again Joss shows how much he loves words: ""I wish I could trust that it was just this once but I must do what I must. I can't adjust to this disgust. We're through. But I just wish I could stay."" And the staging emphasis the loneliness that both Giles and Tara are feeling. They sing at once but are not together; they never look at each other or interact in any way. In the meantime, Buffy and Willow are in the same room but oh! so far away.

buffy,2w07ca,excultist,14,Sun Feb 15 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"The trio were played as comedy up until a certain point, then Warren killed Tara, at which point he completely stopped being funny.  I think there is a point being made, that even ridiculous, inept villains can still do serious harm.    Anyway, we were never given any guarantee that there is just one Big Bad per season.  I counted four of them in season 2 (Spike, Angelus, the Judge, Akathla).  Season 6 seems to have two Big Bads, the trio, and dark Willow (also known as Darth Rosenberg).  Both of these are unusual as Big Bads, the trio for being so amateurish, and Willow because she is not really bad, she just seriously lost control of her anger for a certain period of time.  With previous Big Bads such as the Master, Akathla, the Mayor, Adam, or Glory, their evil is much more precisely defined.  They are truly and unambiguously evil, devoted to evil, and knowing exactly what they are doing.  Season 6 takes us in a different direction.  Of course, Joss Whedon never likes to repeat himself.  There is always something different."
buffy,2w07ca,GinaZaneburritos,13,Mon Feb 16 01:20:21 2015 UTC,"The Trio stopped being funny for me in ""Dead Things."" And really, even though their first appearances were played for comedy, their goals, if taken seriously, were never very amusing. Warren in particular showed a willingness to kill right from the beginning in ""Flooded"" (as well as in ""Gone""). They showed no regard for the museum guard's safety when they used the freeze ray, they set loose demons on a populated construction site, they wanted to make themselves invisible to spy on naked girls, and they even messed with time itself. They just seem ridiculous and inept, but they're really not, and by the end of the season we realize that."

In fact he and Andrew both considered Buffy to be ""cool,"" and they probably would have been almost as quick to follow Buffy as they were Warren.  He was always unpopular and unnoticed. He tried to commit suicide in ""Earshot,"" and although he ends that episode wanting to live, he still hasn't found a lot of meaning in his life. He does a spell in ""Superstar"" to get the recognition and friends and meaning that he's always craved, and it's not that he doesn't get what Buffy's telling him - that you can't ""make it right with one big gesture"" - he just doesn't know how, exactly, to make it right. And he was never entirely willing to put in the work and time and suffering in order to really change himself into someone who would be on the side of good.  Warren offered him a quick fix, just like he found in ""Superstar."" Money and power and friends and everything he'd ever wanted. I actually found it completely believable that he'd find his plan seductive. Disaffected, directionless people are drawn to this sort of thing.  He always knew Buffy was the real hero, and he was just pretending. He knew it in ""The Prom,"" he knew it in ""Superstar,"" and he knew it all through the sixth season. The difference is that it finally comes to a point in season 6 where he can't pretend anymore. The thought of doing real evil makes him see, finally, that he has to take a stand. Then he finally starts to redeem himself."

The guard whom they froze with their freeze ray should have been dead, because human beings cannot survive being frozen, but as it turned out, he was thawed out and was perfectly OK.  But as you say, the trio showed disregard for his life even though he survived, very improbably.  If I were to imagine myself for some reason being invited to the first organizational meeting of the trio, I could have told them immediately that what they were doing could only lead to disaster (although even so, I would not have anticipated the scale of the disaster, which almost led to the destruction of the world).  Obviously, you do not want to play around with the forces of evil on the Hellmouth.

The Trio were too dumb to function and while Warren was crazy and did terrible things he didn't make it to the end and thus I wouldn't consider him the big bad. Willow was evil for a while but I don't think she was the big bad either - while she did bad things I wouldn't full on call her ""evil"". I think the biggest bad of all were all these characters reacting to being adults, and the struggles that come with transitioning into a different phase of their lives - and then how that played out and affected them all."

buffy,2w07ca,sleepyfloyd,2,Sun Feb 15 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"here is my official opinion, and the way I kinda put it together.  In this case, seasons 1 and 7 I don't think pertain but all the others do.  I think the big bad in season 6 is Magic.  Here is why I think this.  In all the other seasons (1 and 7 excluded) the big bad was a struggle between good and evil, and evil ultimately prevailed, until the scoobies stopped it.  Season 2 was Angelus, struggle between soul and no soul, good and evil, and evil angel ultimately prevailed, and then the scoobies stopped it.  Season 3, the mayor, pure evil, but also Faith, struggle between good and evil.  Season 4, the initiative/Adam, the initiative was a good organization until we learned of the evil Adam they created.  Season 5, Glory, but also Ben, struggle with good and evil.  In season 6, magic was the culprit wrecking havoc through most of the season, usually caused by willow, and corrected by Tara, but the trio also used magic.  Once the balance was upset by Tara's death, evil magic reigned through the buffy verse, until Giles showed up and restored the balance, and then ultimately xander defeating that evil.  So that is my take on it."
buffy,2w07ca,krisa731,3,Mon Feb 16 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"Kinda depends what you mean with ""big bad"".   There are antagonists and then there are villains. A villain is a plot device. It's something the heroes are afraid of, keeps them on their toes and makes them do things that are entertaining for us.  An Antagonist is a character who opposes the protagonist, forces growth and development.  A good antagonist will have its own arc and motivation, perhaps be even more interesting than the hero.  An antagonist might find redemption at the end of the story, but the vilain will always (well, never say never, but ... yeah) be killed in the end.  Darth Vader is an antagonist, the Emperator is the villain. One is simple plot device that fuels the story and gets thrown in an air vent when no longer needed, the other has a completely fleshed out character and a very solid arc that ends in redemption.  Faith is a textbook example of an antagonist, the Mayor might be the greatest villain ever. Spike started out as a very cool villain but then became a ""real"" character and was (poorly) playing the antagonist n season four.  In season six, the trio creates the plot in many episodes (Life Serial, Buffy being invisible episode, ...) and Warren kicks of the decisive plot development of the season by killing Tara. They are the villains.  Spike is the antagonist for the first part of the season, because his actions fuel Buffys character development. He has to leave after ""Seeing Red"" because two unconnected antagonists don't work well. After ""Seeing Red"", Willow becomes the full-time antagonist, having her share of (bad) growth and pushing Buffy, Xander, Dawn and Giles to theirs.   Life itself being an asshole and being more difficult than vampires and demons is the theme of the season. Might also be ""the big bad"". As I said, kinda depends on what you mean with the term."

buffy,2w07ca,eatapenny,2,Mon Feb 16 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"How about consequences? Can an action, or a result of an action be considered to be a big bad? If that's the case, then season 6 and to some extent, season 7 are primarily about consequences.  I've never seen a show own it the way that Buffy does, I mean, nobody gets a pass on any decision that they make ever. Even with The Trio and their silly and horrific actions going on, you still have Willow and her magics, and Spike and his infatuation with Buffy, all leading to what feels like the show falling apart -- as the Scooby Gang falls apart.   I thought it was incredibly daring and risky, but ultimately makes sense considering all the decisions that lead Buffy being resurrected."

buffy,2vy2ng,ultrahedgehog,1 point,Tue Feb 17 07:08:38 2015 UTC,"Restless is hit and miss, I guess.   What gets me is the insane narrative craftsmanship of the episode. There isn't a single cut, a single line of dialogue or anything else that isn't perfectly choreographed and thought through. Every take is full of meaning, explaining the characters, how they see themselves and others, and the plot.   The four dreams do a great job of illustrating where each character came from, where they are now and where they are going. You have, for example, Xander, who sees every woman around him completely sexualised (even and especially Joyce), except Buffy. She's a little child in his dream, he's something like a big brother. No more crush, moving on, being over her. Or Willow, who gets the greatest amount of character growth in the season, and who is now afraid of others thinking that she's just faking it. Buffy telling her in her dream to take of the costume is all about that. After that, she stands there in this ridiculous schoolgirl outfit from Welcome to the Hellmouth.  Literally every second of the episode is full of this. Willow and Tara talking between gently waving red curtains, Gilles raising Buffy like a little spoiled child, Spike pulling of a showman act... or take the scene between Anya, Giles and Xander, where everybody is speaking French. If you had the task of showing Xander's anxiety about being stuck in his parents basement and not doing anything with his life (""The others have gone on ahead...""), his fear of being too weak and too stupid next to all these super-powered badasses for the challenges they have to face (""Now listen very carefully,  your life may depend on what I'm about to tell you... French""), what smarter way could there be?  I really think that Restless is the best script Joss ever wrote. Also up there is Out of Gas from Firefly, which was written by Tim Minear, but has Joss's fingerprints all over it. The way these stories showcase the characters past, present and future all at once in one episode is just insane."

buffy,2vvq1l,AxaniAnya,3,Sat Feb 14 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Shakespeare ... never really tackled the idea that men and women could be brought down by their own fear.   That can't possibly be right. I'm not as familiar with Shakespeare as I used to be, but I think you could make a compelling argument that fear is an important motivator for many of his tragic characters.  Off the top of my head, I'd say that Brutus of Julius Caesar has a lot in common with Xander. A friend of Caesar, he allows himself to be swept into suspicion about his motives (planted falsely) and plays a key role in his assassination. When defending his actions, he speaks of logic and rationality, as opposed to Antony's emotional response. He acted for ""the good of Rome,"" as opposed to ambition. He was afraid, and his betrayal sapped Caesar's will to live: ""et tu, Brute? Then fall Caesar.""  Just like Xander is convinced - partly by one of Anya's victims, who gives him a false ""vision"" of their future - that not marrying her is the right thing to do. And his betrayal literally ""kills"" her humanity; she chooses to become a vengeance demon again.  For Angel fans, it's worth pointing out that mild Angel spoiler  It's always interesting to read these articles, just to see what other people think.   Although I never thought Anya died saving Andrew. She just died, and Andrew made that up. Is that not the consensus?"
buffy,2vvq1l,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Feb 15 02:43:59 2015 UTC,"Joss directly addresses your point about Anya and Andrew in the final episode's commentary. You are correct. Anya did not die saving Andrew. Andrew has just finally found a positive way to use his power as a storyteller, which is giving Xander the feeling that Anya's death meant something--that she was a hero--when, really, it was just senseless violence. Andrew picks what Xander needs to hear instead of reality, and for once that's okay.  Edit: ""Senseless violence"" in the sense that sometimes people just die without drama, or meaning, or a big scene. Certainly, Anya's commitment to the fight was admirable and more than just senseless. However, her personal demise had no greater meaning, and that's a bummer. Andrew gave Xander something better to remember her by, even though it was false."
buffy,2vvq1l,clockworklycanthrope,2,Sun Feb 15 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"Also, I never thought Anya died saving Andrew. She just died, and Andrew made that up. Is that not the consensus?    The Bringers descend on Andrew and Anya, driving them apart -- Andrew toward the north hall, Anya down the adjacent hall that leads outside. Andrew goes down holding his sword out pathetically, a Bringer leaping onto him with a knife.  Anya slashes one - drops it, and another comes from the side, she turns and is gutted, the Bringer stabbing her repeatedly as she drops, dead.   Yes, according to the script they were in different sections of the hallway at that point. He's a storyteller. :)  He is also apparently ""Jerry Lewis with a sword"" amusingly enough. :)   A few of them come at Anya -- who's pretty damn good with a sword -- and Andrew, who's Jerry Lewis with a sword, but somehow managing to keep them at bay..."

I have always felt that Buffy & Angel had a very beautiful relationship, made even more beautiful by the tremendous obstacles that exist between a vampire with a Gypsy curse, and a vampire slayer.  The cards were certainly stacked against them as a couple, but their love survived (even if their relationship didn't).

buffy,2vsfxs,GinaZaneburritos,7,Fri Feb 13 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that and thought it was weird too.  But actually - what else was he going to do with it? Throw it away? Give it to Drusilla? Hang it up somewhere in his room or the factory?  I imagine his thought process is: every time Buffy sees me wear it, it'll remind her of what I was, and that'll hurt her. It might even hurt more if he didn't reverse it: I'm sneaking in to your room and killing your friends, but it's because I belong to you, baby. Kind of like ""was it good for you too?""  I don't know if any of these are actually why they decided to have him continue wearing it, but I think it works."
buffy,2vsfxs,GinaZaneburritos,6,Fri Feb 13 20:52:27 2015 UTC,I always thought Angel and D'Hoffryn were somewhat similar.   Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain.
buffy,2vsfxs,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Feb 13 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Which is good, cause, you know, otherwise Buffy would have been dead. No reason not to kill her when she came looking for him in ""Innocence,"" and he would have had the element of surprise.  The desire to cause suffering rather than just killing the good guys outright is what enables the heroes to rally and beat them back. It's kind of the First's problem too."
buffy,2vsfxs,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Feb 13 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"The First cringe how is something so old and so ""evil"" so incompetent?!  It barely uses Spike's trigger to do anything really interesting or to kill Buffy (it's supposed to be wiping out the slayer line).  It has all these bringers, but Spike is barely guarded when Buffy goes searching for him.When the vampires Spike sired are holding Buffy any one of them could have just reached out and snapped her neck.  A more interesting thing they could have done would have been for a potential to go missing. Then other potentials  appear to  tell her that they are leaving to go back to their own homes; that they think the fight is pointless and they give up. Buffy will think that 3-4 of them have deserted the cause, but when Buffy goes into the basement she finds out that the First had made Spike sire them while triggered instead of a bunch of random townspeople."
buffy,2vsfxs,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Feb 13 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, the First comes off as pretty incompetent. But the idea is so cool that it's actually my favorite ""Big Bad.""  I like the potentials idea! Another thing that the First could have done was impersonate Buffy a lot more. Not just when talking to Spike or Caleb, but with Giles and Willow and the potentials.   The First drives Angel to either murder or suicide in season 3 ... Is it just over-extended in season 7? It could have messed with them a lot more.  I'm starting to think that the First's incompetence is due to a few factors:    It's a little out of its element. It's used to working ""behind-the-scenes"" and nudging people towards evil actions. It's not used to taking an active role and formulating strategy. In fact, it's suggested that it lives in hatred, in cruelty, in all these other ""evil"" impulses. It might not really even be able to make plans - it depends on its agents, like the Bringers and the Ubervamp and Caleb to do that, and none of them can exactly be called deep thinkers. It just sees what's in people and brings out whatever it knows will scare them, will cause them pain, and will cause them to hurt others. It sees opportunity in Andrew and in Spike, but it's kind of a reactionary force.  I don't know if it wants to kill Buffy. I know it's trying to wipe out the slayer line, but all it ever seems to talk about is killing the potentials, and you're right, if it wanted Buffy dead it should have been able to kill her several times over. I think it really wants to ""turn"" people to evil. That's where it lives. It wants to see Buffy mentally and emotionally destroyed, not so much just dead.   On another, related topic, am I the only one who thought it was cool when Angel season 4 spoilers"

That is a great idea! It would have been interesting to see ""Buffy"" giving speeches and orders to people in the house, like the potentials, who don't know her well enough to notice anything strange.""Buffy"" could have been sending potentials one or two at a time into traps of bringers.   ... Is it just over-extended in season 7?   Yes, without the benefit of David Greenwalt.   It's not used to taking an active role and formulating strategy   I think it is also overconfident.

Yes, it's that too. It might be old and evil, but really, it's not that smart :) It's also used to taking the long view, since it's been around for so long. Always more chances to bring out more evil! It's just not equipped to really take advantage of the opportunity it has. Although it does a good job. Really its major failing was underestimating Spike's capacity for goodness and Buffy's faith in him. It kept trying to make him an agent of evil, and make everyone else see him as an agent of evil, but they help each other in a way the First never expected.  Totally different, by the way, than the way it all ends with Buffy and Angel in season 3. If they hadn't gotten supernatural help with the snow, it all would have been over.   Mine is the Mayor   Well yes, the Mayor is awesome! :) So seemingly wholesome but so evil. The only real problem I have with the Mayor is in believing that he really loved Faith. For some reason I have a really hard time believing that; I honestly don't know why.   Actually, he reminds me a little of mild Angel spoilers"

I thought it was made pretty clear by mid-season 2 that they couldn't be together forever, despite their love for one another. What came after doesn't change the fact that Angel was Buffy's first and only true love. She tried to move and claim a ""normal life"" (Parker, Riley), then she found a monster to bang that sunk her deeper into her own self-loathing before almost getting raped by him (Spike), but I don't fault her for any of that.   The only thing posts like yours accomplish is they poison and splinter the remaining fandom. They're nasty and mean-spirited."

It attempts to trivialize what was a profoundly impactful storyline in the history of the show (arguably, the storyline that elevated the show to a whole new level). It caters to shippers, and that never ends with a reasonable, fun and light-hearted discussion amongst fans."

buffy,2vs43g,catdoctor,5,Fri Feb 13 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"He was definitely going to get his soul. It makes no sense that he wanted to get his chip out to ""give Buffy what she deserves"" because the chip no longer had any effect on Buffy. Spike was not a complicated man. He didn't go in for philosophical discussions and probably didn't get his soul back because he thought this would allow him to love Buffy better. Spike knew that Buffy has loved Angel, a vampire with a soul. So he figured ""If I'm a vampire with a soul then she can really love me as much as I love her."" I don't think he even stopped to think through the consequences to himself of getting his soul back, namely the wrenching guilt that Angel felt. Sometime in Season 7 Spike says that he has no serious remorse about the things he did as a vampire. He was a vampire and he did what vampires do. That's all. And this is why he was able to cope with the restoration of his soul so much better than Angel did."
buffy,2vs43g,clockworklycanthrope,2,Fri Feb 13 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Not even really a question. Joss and the other writers have said that Spike was definitely trying to get his soul back, so that's the canon version of events. Anyone who says otherwise is directly contradicting the canonical version of the Buffyverse."
buffy,2vs43g,FuzzieDunlop,-1,Sun Feb 15 06:02:31 2015 UTC,"The operative question should be, why does a soulless vampire feel guilt or remorse for evil acts at all? This plotline completely ignored existing canon. And why does Buffy ""deserve"" a souled Spike? 10+ years later, it still makes no sense to me. What Buffy deserved was Spike out of her life altogether. Plus, we already did the ""vampire with a soul"" story. Poor Spike - a very cool character who got shoe-horned into whatever role the writers wanted him to fill that season."
buffy,2vs43g,AngelAmongUs,5,Fri Feb 13 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Spike showed the ability to feel bad for hurting someone he loves in season 2. Harmony felt bad for wanting to drink from her friend Cordelia after they bonded but not from strangers.Feeling bad about something is not the same as the remorse they would feel if they had a soul.   Spike:  Yeah. So... (kisses her forehead) What might you guys have  talked about, then? Old times? Childhood pranks? It's a little off, you  two so friendly, him being the enemy and all that.  Drusilla:  (to the bird) I'll give you a seed if you sing.  Spike:  The bird's dead, Dru. You left it in a cage, and you didn't feed  it, and now it's all dead, just like the last one.  Drusilla cowers and whines.  Spike:  Oh, I'm sorry baby. I'm a bad, rude man. I just don't like you  goin' out, that's all. You are weak. (takes her hand) Would you like a  new bird? One that's not dead? (sucks on her finger)    Cordy is lying asleep in bed.  The door opens slowly to reveal - two feet in fuzzy pink slippers.  The camera pans up past long legs to show us Harmony standing in the door wearing a white negligee, staring at Cordy's neck and licking her lips.  She walks over to the bed and slowly sits down on its edge.  Suddenly the door slams shut and Cordy startles awake.   Harmony:  ""I didn't do that.""   Cordy:  ""Harmony? (Turns on the bedside lamp and rubs her eyes)  I have a ghost. - What - What are you doing in my...""   Harmony:  ""Nothing!""   Cordy:  ""Harmony.""   Harmony:  ""I'm sorry. - I thought I could control myself.  I thought I could control these urges.""   Cordy sitting up:  ""Urges?""   Harmony:  ""You have no idea how hard it is to stay away from you.  I mean, seeing you there looking so - so luscious.""   Cordy:  ""Oh. - Oh!  You're a...""  Harmony:  ""I should have told you.  I was - scared.  Scared that if you found out what I was - you'd kill me.""   Cordy:  ""Oh.  No, Harmony - god, you really think I'm that narrow-minded?  -  I don't care about that!""   Harmony:  ""You don't?""   Cordy:  ""No!  Not as long as you're happy.""   Harmony:  ""Happy.  What's that?  The last time I remember being truly happy was being back in school with you.  Now here I am taking advantage of you?""   Cordy:  ""No.  It's - it's just...  It's just that I had no idea - that you, you know - thought of me that way.""   Harmony:  ""I don't!  I swear.  It's just, - well, I haven't had any for a while and... (Sees Cordy's look and gets up)  Oh, forget it.  This is stupid.  I'll just go back to the couch.  I'm really sorry.""   Cordy:  ""Don't be.  If you wanna stay and talk...""   Harmony:  ""No, I'd better... You know, I'd appreciate it if you didn't - mention this to anyone.""   Cordy:  ""It's our secret.""   As far as the ""deserved"" line, all of Spike's dialogue was intended to  be misleading.   The writers were intentionally trying to be misleading by making the dialogue vague enough that they thought people would really fall for him going to Africa to get the chip out so he could hurt Buffy. He did not need the chip out to be able to hit Buffy, or even to hurt her friends if he really wanted to. He could always just get someone else to do it for him. They did not tell James to be vague in his performance though. He did not find out that Spike wanted to get his soul until a panel discussion immediately after the end of season 6 with the cast when Joss exclaimed that he invented the “plot twist” when asked if Spike had meant to get his soul because it did not seem like it onscreen. When he heard this onstage he appeared mildly irritated because his performance would not match the characters true intent. Therein lies the problem, they told one of the best actors on the show to act out that his character was angry at Buffy and wanted revenge and the chip out. So that is how it played on screen. There was never plans for Spike to actually go there for the reasons we were supposed to be fooled by."
buffy,2vs43g,mickey5499,4,Fri Feb 13 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think he necessarily felt guilt or remorse. I think he wanted a soul because he wanted Buffy, and he wanted to show her that he could be the man that she wanted and deserved. The whole point of him really working with the Scoobies was to show Buffy that he could be that man, and him trying to gain a soul was the same thing."
buffy,2vs43g,heymeowmeow,2,Fri Feb 13 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on that are that he doesn't feel guilt for stuff he did to people other than Buffy but he does feel guilty for stuff he did to her. Drusilla explicitly states that vampires can love quite well, if not always wisely and I think that Spike loved Buffy and he felt bad for hurting someone he loved and not for hurting ""the slayer"" or ""an innocent"" or anything like that. And I don't think he feels bad for killing either of the other slayers (it certainly doesn't seem that way in Fool for Love. I think in those instances he feels perfectly ok with those deeds, Angel the show maybe spoilers but he wants to make them stop because he's putting what he thinks Buffy wants or deserves above his own wants because he loves her. Which brings me to my next point that it's not that Buffy deserves a souled Spike, but instead just a being with a soul, so he's not saying he's doing it with the intention of, ok now you need to date me. I think his intention is, now I can be a person who at least has the potential to be what you want because I now see that you were right when you said, ""Ask me again how I could never love you."" (paraphrased from memory)."
buffy,2vs43g,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Fri Feb 13 20:45:22 2015 UTC,I always had a headcanon it was Angel's fault his sirelings and grandsirelings were so strange & didn't follow the vampire rules in the verse. My headcanon also included this as the reason as why it's so easy to resoul him. Otherwise why wouldn't you try to give all vampires souls? That's why Wolfram & Hart are so interested in him & don't just kill him.
buffy,2vs43g,heymeowmeow,3,Fri Feb 13 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Ha, that is interesting.  I always thought it was funny that Angel the show spoilers  The reason I think they don't is not because Angel is somehow ""easy to re-ensoul"" - because there's really no suggestion that the gypsy curse wouldn't have worked on someone else - I think it's just that more Angel spoilers Also, re-ensoulling a vampire is always portrayed as pretty powerful magic, not something easy to achieve. I always had the impression that the gypsy curse - or the trials that Spike goes through - may not even work unless there were powerful emotion fueling the desire for re-ensoulment.

I always had this theory that he was different, that's why Darla chose him. She was drawn to him because he was strange.   Another headcanon, the reason Angel was bat shit crazy for so long is when he was re-souled by the by the gypsies, he was given the gypsy girl's soul. Tethered to him, it torments him with guilt for eternity."

buffy,2vlg9b,thisguy49,3,Thu Feb 12 06:23:31 2015 UTC,"Captain John Hart (Torchwood):       Captain John Hart, played by James Marsters, is a fictional character from the BBC science fiction television programme Torchwood. He is introduced in the episode ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang""—the first episode of Torchwood '​s second series. Whilst the character has not featured subsequently to the second series finale, he went on to appear in a Torchwood Magazine comic strip and Marsters has stated his interest in reprising the role on more than one occasion.  In his first appearance, John Hart is as a rogue Time Agent and former partner of the series' lead male character Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) both professionally and sexually. Whilst the original function of the Time Agency—stated to have ceased operation by the time Hart appears —is left unspecified, John's own backstory is briefly given, as well as having had a relationship with Jack he has been in rehab for an addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex and murder. John leaves earth disgraced after his initial self-interested plot is foiled by Harkness' Torchwood team, though returns in the series finale ""Exit Wounds"" where he is eventually given a chance to redeem himself.  The role of John Hart in Torchwood was written with the casting of Marsters in mind after he contacted the shows' producers expressing his interest in appearing in the programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used to illuminate some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona. Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart's character to Marsters's role as Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show's tone, a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role.

I think he looked a bit taken back and he said ""Why yes I am"" and smiled very warmly at me. I then asked for his autograph and he scribbled it onto a napkin. The other kids got autographs too, but I was annoyed because nobody even knew who he was haha.

A falling ring in itself seems like a small event, yet mysterious, with a much bigger event to follow.  I also think that Angel had not been slain when Buffy impaled him with the sword, because abdominal wounds do not slay a vampire, it was the vortex generated by Akathla which carried Angel away.  My condolences for your loss.  You have an interesting ring by which to remember your mother, as Buffy remembered Angel."

This was a badly miscalculated ploy by none other than the First Evil, which thought that the return of Angel would be emotionally upsetting to Buffy and would make her less effective in her Slayer role.  Of course it was emotionally upsetting to Buffy but Angel rapidly became a valuable player in the fight against evil, and eventually became a key player.  The forces of evil do not always know what they are doing.  We see this in season 3, episode 10 ""Amends"".  That is the first time we see the First Evil.  It is then never seen again until season 7.  That plot line took a long time to come to fruition."
buffy,2vloiw,excultist,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:36:08 2015 UTC,Good point. Evil can't udnerstnad good.
buffy,2vloiw,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"Evil does not understand good, but evil also seems often not to understand other evils, as well.  Historically (back in the real world) Hitler and Stalin were both very evil, and they made a deal with each other, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which would have allowed them to successfully carve up Europe between themselves, and no one could have stopped them, either.  But then Hitler betrayed Stalin and violated the pact.  Even Stalin, a man of immense evil, did not fully appreciate how evil Hitler was.  Similarly in the Buffyverse, the Hellmouth is finally closed, in the series finale, with the help of an amulet donated to the cause by none other than the extremely evil Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart.  The nearly invulnerable lava demon was finally killed by the evil Angelus.  Balthazar the obese semi-aquatic demon would have gone to war with the evil Mayor Wilkins, if only he had gotten hold of his amulet.  Spike kills the Anointed One.  The forces of evil are not very well unified."

Usage and symbolism of article  Claddagh ring:       The Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart, and usually surmounted by a crown. These elements symbolize the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). A ""Fenian"" Claddagh ring, without a crown, is a slightly different take on the design, but has not achieved the level of popularity of the crowned version. Claddagh rings are relatively popular among the Irish  and those of Irish heritage, such as Irish Americans,  as cultural symbols and as friendship, engagement and wedding rings.

""You only like the bad guys, why can't you like a nice guy like me instead?""   seems to be his mindset for so long in the series. When he confesses to Buffy and she admits she doesn't see him ""that way"", instead of respecting her feelings as valid, he tells her to try.  Keep in mind that he knows all about Willow's feelings for him (as established in his rant during The Pack), and he hasn't ""tried"" to ""give her a chance."" And doesn't until it's established that Willow's affections have moved to someone else-- Oz.    Xander always struck me as a very me-me-me, my-my-my kind of guy. Of course he has times in the series when he shows he's got more to him, but for me those moments didn't wash away my initial impression.  But then, I'm more of an Oz girl myself."

buffy,2vk714,dcr108,7,Wed Feb 11 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"FAQ  I only ever read the comics which are canon. Reading order can be found there as well and also canon explanation. The really quick order would be.   Angel: After the fall 1-2 Spike: After the fall  Angel after the fall 3-4  Spike: The Complete Collection (think it's called that) Fray  Buffy Season 8 (with some one shot's but I think they're including in 8) Angel a& Faith / Buffy season 9.   Again, it's all in the FAQ. I recommend /u/dtadgh's list, although I disagree on their canon status for Angel   26-27 Boys and Their Toys, Angel    Annual 1 Last Angel in Hell, Angel This One Time (and some others). Basically, if you're unsure, just google the story and if Joss isn't credited, big chance it's not canon."

buffy,2vk714,dtadgh,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:17:51 2015 UTC,Hey list author here. I consider those titles canon because they were written by Brian Lynch who wrote all the canon Angel and Spike stories and they're consistent with his vision. Also I just think he's a really good writer and tells some of the best stories of all the comics. Same goes for Spike Asylum and Shadow Puppets in which reoccurring characters are first introduced. I know they're not strictly canon by way of having no involvement from Joss but I hope I made that clear in the notes
buffy,2vk714,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Thu Feb 12 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"I don't at all have a problem with you citing that as canon. It's your list, you were dedicated enough to make it and it should reflect how you feel :) I just don't feel the same way about Lynch, so when I cite your order, I just mention it to add my opinion.   I use your list because it's fantastic and very well presented. :D"
buffy,2vk714,dtadgh,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I love hearing comments about it. Open to all suggestions. I put a lot of thought and effort into it, trying to make it as objective as possible, but I guess it's inherently biased to my subjective opinion. Would love to hear any other comments you have.  It's surprising to me to see so many differing opinions on Lynch. For me he's done the best Buffy comic work behind only Joss himself. He shows a real understanding and love of the source material and After the Fall was amazingly well put together. Obviously in part thanks to Joss's plotting, but I think Lynch does a great job of writing most of the core cast and I've even come to care about his original characters (Betta George brought so much humour). Maybe what I liked about his writing is the way he instilled so much humour using the ensemble cast in a fashion similar to Buffy, whilst still maintaining the emotional core that the Angel series had developed. I would love nothing more than to see Lynch come back and write a Spike story, reuniting the team from Asylum etc. The Spike 8 issue series was also really enjoyable, faltering in some spots for sure buy it went some really interesting places and Spike finally felt like a character who could stand on his own, with his own interesting supporting cast, rather than just being a supporting character himself. In some ways I lament the fact the Dark Horse took back the Angel licence; we could have had more Lynch penned Spike stories.  Boys and Their Toys felt like a great standalone humour episode in the style of Spin the Bottle. Nailed the Spike/Angel dynamic. And Last Angel in Hell was just a good bit of harmless fun.  It will be interesting to see if Spike ever meets up with the other Angel characters in the ongoing comics. He developed so many interesting relationships that it would be sad to see them all discarded in favour of just relegating him to Buffy support character once more.  TL;DR: I love Brian Lynch."

Did you find that even people who didn't watch the show enjoyed themselves? How did the people who didn't watch the show come up with costumes? Did you get them to start watching it? I have so many questions!  Edit: Did you have an Onion Blossom as one of the appetizers?
buffy,2vey69,disassterbate,7,Tue Feb 10 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! Yes, they really really did! It was a requirement for guests to come in costume, so a few friends started watching the show just so they could figure out what the hell to wear... and then got addicted (My job is done). I also kept the Facebook event updated every few days, posting things like the ""10 episodes to watch if you want to understand the Buffy phenomenon"", and ""How to Vamp it Up like a Sunnydale Vampire.""  The games/activities made it fun for fans and non-fans to get into it. Pin-the-stake-on-the-Master, Crossbow training, Buffy charades, and of course the photobooth were super popular with everyone.  Of course, there were still many people who had never seen an episode and wore all black and just went with it. Pretty much all of them peaced out when Once More with Feeling came on around 1am.  And of course booze helps all things. We had two signiture drinks: ""Spike's Gift"" (lemonade, tequila, blood orange skewer) and ""ScrewAngel"" (Screwdriver with a grenadine swirl and sword-pierced cherry). Also, red jello-shots with blood types written on them!  Oh man, we didn't even THINK of an Onion Blossom. Dangit! We did do garlic mashed potato balls, ""staked"" meat balls, and lots of 90's snacks however."
buffy,2vey69,Bellevert,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"The ""ScrewAngel"" is one of the greatest things I have ever heard of. That whole party sounds amazing, wish I had been there. Thanks for the amazing ideas!"
buffy,2vey69,Bellevert,3,Wed Feb 11 03:20:36 2015 UTC,Pin the stake on the master!
buffy,2vey69,MrsSquishy,3,Tue Feb 10 19:03:55 2015 UTC,Yes! It was a blast. Slightly dangerous with adult beverages involved. But everyone loved it. We also had crossbow training in the backyard with wooden toy crossbows and Spike!drawing style vampires to shoot at.
buffy,2vey69,GinaZaneburritos,3,Tue Feb 10 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Omg, i totally lost it at the 'Slayer, come out and die :-)' sign.  Bravo!! That must have been a rad night, and belated happy birthday!!"
buffy,2vey69,tempotiger,2,Wed Feb 11 02:09:12 2015 UTC,That looks so fun!
buffy,2vey69,HuseyinCinar,2,Tue Feb 10 20:08:55 2015 UTC,That is awesome and where was my invitation
buffy,2vey69,matsie,2,Tue Feb 10 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"That is FANTASTIC!!! Are all of your friends buffy-fans?! I can't decide if it is better if they are or not! If so - awesome - so many friends that are fans too! If not, they all cared so much about you to dress up for you! All around great time!"
buffy,2vey69,shhhh_spoilers,2,Tue Feb 10 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! It was a solid half-and-half for Buffy fans and non-fans/casual watchers. I agree, it was so awesome that everyone went full out despite half not knowing what they were getting themselves into! I would like to brag that I created a few new Buffy fans in the process though :)"
buffy,2vey69,sigma914,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:01:12 2015 UTC,That is always a very satisfying accomplishment! I am always happy to bring someone into the know. I really enjoyed all of the costumes and it was amazing how accurate they were! Well done!

buffy,2vey69,catladyalice,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:51:41 2015 UTC,That is so awesome! You guys have the clothes from specific episodes and everything!!  I'm amazed. How long did it take you to pull that off?  These are the best party pictures I think I've ever seen. :)
buffy,2vey69,TheBlueDanNoob,5,Tue Feb 10 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks :) Best is a strong and excellent word. Decorations took about 3 weekends worth of shopping/creating, and a whole night and part of the next to put up. We went a little crazy on decorations, but it was so worth it. Setting the mood is key if you expect your guests to dress up! We gave our guests a couple months to choose characters and told them costumes were required, but we were still impressed at how many pulled out all the stops! Even friends who never had seen Buffy before made an effort. Best costume awards went to Spike (male), Dark Willow (female), and Cordelia (gender bender)"
buffy,2vey69,iratasum,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the gender-bender Cordelia, but he looks so much like Angel! Can't decide whether it's a missed opportunity or not.."

buffy,2vey69,welikeproductivity,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:36:36 2015 UTC,Omg. I hope you don't mind but I may steal this idea for my bday in November!!
buffy,2vey69,rainbowblight,6,Tue Feb 10 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Um, please!! BUFFY PARTIES FOR ALL!  Things I learned:   Joint birthday parties of this scale are the way to go! It was so much fun planning with a fellow Buffy fan. I was in charge of decorations and games, and she took care of food and drink. We were also able to split the cost of everything, which became rather substantial. Once you put on OMWF, everyone who isn't already a fan will leave, but everyone who is will immediately sit down and sing along to the whole thing. So it's a good thing to do around midnight :) The games/activities made it fun for fans and non-fans to get into it (and since it was a joint-bday, let both bday girls' friends interact). Pin-the-stake and Crossbow training, Buffy charades, and a ""What Would Buffy Do?"" board kept everyone giggling. Playlist is key. We did every 90's/2000's song that felt Bronze appropriate (including those from the soundtracks of course). We could have had some more dance-y music, however. Photobooth was a huge success, though it would have been nice to have an official photographer friend roaming around. Hope you do it!!"
buffy,2vg0o9,thebeardednurse,19,Tue Feb 10 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"ok real question now, was Joyce's death really the saddest, or was it just how it was portrayed that made it so emotional?"
buffy,2vg0o9,theevilgiraffe,9,Tue Feb 10 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that too. I think it depends on who it was the saddest for. For me, Angel's death was the saddest. It was so hard that his soul was restored right before she had to kill him. I think for Buffy, it might be a tie between Angel and her mom. On the one hand, her mom's death was sudden and shocking and destroyed what little innocence she had left in her life. On the other hand, she had to kill her first love. The fact that Joyce's death stuck while Angel's didn't makes Joyce's a little more gut wrenching."
buffy,2vg0o9,thebeardednurse,11,Wed Feb 11 03:18:28 2015 UTC,I think that Tara's death destroyed the last innocence left in the show.  Tara was pure and uninhibited by anything evil.
buffy,2vg0o9,cocainelady,2,Wed Feb 11 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that, as well.  Was incredibly surprised to see that as the majority answer.  I can't remember what I answered - Either Buffy or Angel (Angel, even though I don't like him in the show had an incredibly sad end).  Buffy's was beautiful, but much, much more sad than losing Joyce."
buffy,2vg0o9,Beloit,8,Wed Feb 11 13:15:48 2015 UTC,"I like how the word cloud made of answers to the question ""Why do you love the Buffyverse?"" is made up of all these profound words like ""journey"", ""complexity"", ""resonated"" and ""subversion"", and then there's just ""ass""."
buffy,2vg0o9,Beloit,4,Tue Feb 10 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"That was my fault in accidentally using two words instead of one.  If you use two words, it splits them up. So that's happened. I'll fix it when I have time.   Also, flaws being next to feminism is another totally random thing that the word cloud has generated. So unlikely to happen, yet it has for some bloody reason.   Again, I'll fix it.   edit  fixed"
buffy,2vg0o9,MoonSpider,4,Tue Feb 10 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I guess that was supposed to be ""kickass"" then? I just thought a bunch of people had responded they love the Buffyverse because of a certain character's posterior..."
buffy,2vg0o9,GinaZaneburritos,6,Tue Feb 10 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"I want to know what people wrote in for 'other' on the soul mate question.     Edit Now I know!    Some of the write-ins: Faith(x6) there is no such thing No characters in the series That one dude from the movie, what the hell happened to that guy? She's not done baking yet! I don't believe in soulmates. Herself (x2) Nobody. Buffy hasn't found her soulmate yet IMO Giles Other/blank(x4) She's still cookie dough! Hasn't met him/her yet and comics don't count Willow TBD. ""cookie dough"" Clarence Hasn't found them yet. It's all about the Scooby Gang's relationship. But Team Spike. Ash Williams they really (intentionally, I assume) never introduced one. Peter Parker. They'd be such a good team! He's like Willow and Oz combined, with the powers and angst of Angel. No such thing Principal Wood I don't believe in soulmates She hasn't found them yet Angel. But she really doesn't need a soulmate. She is a strong woman who don't need no man. Someone New Probably Angel, but I wish it was Spike :-/ Dawn"
buffy,2vg0o9,MoonSpider,2,Tue Feb 10 23:47:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I wrote ""she's not done baking"" :P  In past surveys, that's actually been a fairly popular answer.  Edit: As in the 2012 survey, for example - combined with ""no one."""
buffy,2vg0o9,TheBlueDanNoob,2,Wed Feb 11 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"Nice! I almost went with ""cookie dough,"" but in the end I wrote in ""Peter Parker.""    I THINK THEY'D UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE EACH OTHER."

buffy,2vg0o9,DigitalBathRx,3,Wed Feb 11 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"I found those fun to read through :)  IRL, it seems that everyone I've talked to about Buffy (granted, not that many people) has a crush on Faith. Male, female, gay, straight ... Doesn't seem to matter!   The nice thing about this subreddit - and about surveys like this - is that I can see how diverse we Buffy fans really are."

""…No, Faith would TOTALLY do that. Faith was built to do that. She's the 'do that' girl!""    I think it's somewhat analogous to the omnisexual appreciation of Spike."
buffy,2vg0o9,TheBlueDanNoob,3,Wed Feb 11 07:07:50 2015 UTC,":)  I've often had a conversation that goes something like this: ""Buffy? Oh yeah, I liked that show! You know who was really cool, though? Not Buffy ... that other girl, what's her name ... she was another slayer, I think?""  About Spike, I agree - at least for women. I've yet to meet a straight guy who will admit to having a man-crush on Spike, though.   Edit: Altered wording"
buffy,2vg0o9,MoonSpider,3,Wed Feb 11 07:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think Faith and Spike are alike in that way as MoonSpider said.   I identify as lesbian and I am sexually attracted to Spike. Sometimes I like to think of Faith and Spike as this larger than life, genderless, uber-sex-god encased in leather and snark.

buffy,2vfs03,Raffit,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:02:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has something to do with that environment/setting. That's my kinda worst nightmare, being stuck in an industrial estate in somewhere like Slough. And the whole early 2000's era of office life just depresses me as well. Essentially it's my worst nightmare as someone who's just about to finish university, ending up in that type of environment.   I can still recognise the obvious brilliance to the show and the fact that it's deliberately set in that environment for the premise of the show, but it just makes me sad when watching. The difference being with the US version is that while the environment isn't great, the characters and the investment in Jim and Pam make it great. I've never felt like I really cared for The Office UK characters. And to be honest, I was never really invested in Tim and Dawn either :/"
buffy,2vfs03,Kikooky,2,Wed Feb 11 12:07:29 2015 UTC,"This might seem like it's coming out of left field for someone who's never seen it, but you might want to give Person of Interest a go. It's the most similar thing I can come up with, strangely. It blends action, humor, and heavy storytelling very well, while being a bit more grounded in reality than Buffy is (though it's still scifi). Also, Amy Acker.  I believe Netflix Canada has it. Netflix US will be getting it later this year."

buffy,2vchne,Kikooky,28,Mon Feb 9 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"According to the writers Spike always set out to get his soul back. It was intentionally written that it appeared he wanted the chip out so he could get revenge. Getting his soul back was the twist but it was what he wanted. You can read more about it, including what the writers of the show have said about it, on this page."
buffy,2vchne,Beloit,10,Mon Feb 9 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"As a recall he throws it in Angel's face in the later parts of Angel saying stuff like ""I fought for my soul, I earned it, you just got handed one"" etc etc."
buffy,2vchne,Loreki,15,Mon Feb 9 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"SPIKE:  Oh, yeah. Look at you. Thinking you're the big savior fighting for truth, justice, and soccer moms but you still can't lay flesh on a cross without smelling like bacon, can you?   ANGEL: Like you're any different.   SPIKE: Well, that's just it. I am. And you know it. You had a soul forced on you as a curse. Make you suffer for all the horrible things you'd done. But me... I fought for my soul. Went through the demon trials. Almost did me in a dozen times over, but I kept fighting. 'Cause I knew it was the right thing to do.   It's my destiny.   ANGEL: Really? Heard it was just to get into a girl's pants."
buffy,2vchne,AngelAmongUs,13,Mon Feb 9 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"I love how that ""get into a girl's pants"" line is such a double-edged insult. On one hand, he's saying Spike went through the demon trials to get into a girl's (Buffy's) pants. On the other hand, it's a jab at how, early in his vampire existence, Spike had said Drusilla was his destiny; Angelus, of course, then promptly slept with her as a cruel joke designed to hurt Spike and draw him further away from his remaining goodness and ties to human emotions.   When Angel responds to ""it's my destiny"" with ""Really? Heard it was just to get into a girl's pants,"" he's simultaneously bringing up an old hurt and belittling Spike's sacrifice and feelings for Buffy. No matter which way Spike takes it, it stings."
buffy,2vchne,clockworklycanthrope,9,Mon Feb 9 23:24:58 2015 UTC,"Angel also does this in “Lover’s Walk” in front of Buffy who has no idea about the context and history behind the comment.   SPIKE: I used to bring her rats... With the morning paper...  BUFFY: Oh, good, more moping. That's really gonna win her back, Spike.  SPIKE: The spell's gonna get her back.  ANGEL: Lot of trouble for someone who doesn't even care about you.  SPIKE: Shut your gob.  ANGEL: She's just kind of fickle...  SPIKE: Shut up!"
buffy,2vchne,AngelAmongUs,5,Tue Feb 10 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, she kind of does. Remember ""Becoming, Part 2"":   Spike: I want Dru back. I want it like it was, before he came back. The way she acts around him ...  Buffy: The whole world could be sucked into Hell, and you need my help cause your girlfriend's a big ho?   I never really took Angel's lines in ""Lover's Walk"" to be particularly snarky. He kind of has a point :)"
buffy,2vchne,GinaZaneburritos,6,Tue Feb 10 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Buffy has a good grasp on what he really means though. It's likely that Buffy only thinks Drusilla is mildly flirting with Angel from his comment.  Angel and Spike never really reveal their past together to her. Which makes the ""one vampire got me hot, you're just convenient"" comment hit even harder (you can see it in his face) than Buffy is probably aware of. It's somewhat reminiscent of the ""you're beneath me"" scene from ""Fool for Love"".  Angel knows how to go for the mental pain, it's his specialty. He’s defiantly trying to push Spike's buttons. The most effective lies have a little truth mixed in."
buffy,2vchne,AngelAmongUs,2,Tue Feb 10 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"There's somewhat of a gap between ""big ho"" and ""mildly flirting."" :) but you're right, the more I think of it, Buffy probably would be a bit more hurt if she had really understood the Angel/Spike/Drusilla dynamic.   Buffy has her jealous moments, after all. She's very hurt seeing Angel and Faith together; she's jealous of Riley ""seeing"" a vampire in season 5; she's hurt seeing Spike and Anya in season 6. She doesn't seem jealous here or in ""Becoming,"" and while part of that is that there were more important things going on (can you imagine - I knew he turned into a psycho killer, but I didn't think he'd cheat on me!), it's more likely that she just isn't taking it too seriously.  The thing about this scene is that it's one of the first hints of Angel/Spike banter, at least when Angel has a soul. It's not something that's fully developed yet. We don't see it at all in ""School Hard"" or ""Surprise"" ... we do see it a little in ""What's My Line?"" but although Angel is deliberately provoking Spike in that scene, there's a suggestion that it's solely to prevent Spike from restoring Drusilla. I always took understood it to mean that he knew what to say to hurt Spike ... but I never thought he was ""pushing his buttons"" just for the purpose of being cruel.  I could be wrong, but I think the banter between Spike and Angel really gets going once Spike decides/realizes he's in love with Buffy. Then the writers have fun fleshing out their relationship."

buffy,2vchne,kodachikuno,5,Mon Feb 9 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, the writers (including Joss) have specifically stated that Spike's intention with the trials was definitely to get his soul back.

buffy,2v700z,whitew0lf,26,Mon Feb 9 09:26:36 2015 UTC,"James Marsters used a Texan drawl for Spike before he swapped it for cockney.   Actually...   (2-99 Starburst) I came in and auditioned once and they liked what I did. They tried me in a Southern accent and then an English accent. I did a Louisiana accent for them, but it was a more sexy sort of thing. Drusilla was already cast. They had wanted her from the very beginning. I never met her before. We shook hands walking into the audition and just leapt into it. For some reason we clicked. There was an automatic trust. I think we just recognized that we were two actors that could learn to trust each other and I gave the audition of my life. The shot where we kind of kiss and turn foreheads that we have used a number of times, that was just an instinctual thing that we did in the audition. And that was the end of the audition and they just went, 'We love these guys! Originally Joss wanted us to be punk vampires - he wanted a Sid and Nancy. I auditioned with a British accent and a southern accent, which I thought was real sexy. But the British is dangerous, whereas the Southern was a little slow. When I got the audition, I was playing a role in The Tempest at a Shakespeare festival. The man playing Caliban was from North London and as soon as I got the audition I called him and said, 'Do a couple of these lines for me please.' And he did. I owe him a lot of money, I suppose!    David often ad-libbed and changed his lines to the extent that his co-stars would not know what he was going to say next.    Does anyone have a source to confirm this, because it is pretty well known that you do not modify the lines. Not even the punctuation. That is what they did to his original movie script and he never got over it. Just ask the guy who played Gru (ATS), who said that Joss was not happy with his script suggestions.   (4-05 Houston)  Q: As a method actor, how do you keep things fresh on the fifth take?  James: You just look at your partner - it's so much easier if your partner is really there with you and not giving you a preplanned - you know. It becomes very hard when you're working with an actor who's just giving the line reading, the way they planned it at home. Because there's no tennis happening. It's really wonderful when you work with an actor and you don't know what they're gonna do. David Boreanaz is like that. You look into his eyes and you really don't know what you're gonna get, in a really good way. I've probably worked over the years with maybe 5 or 10 actors who were like that on Buffy and David was one of them."
buffy,2v700z,AngelAmongUs,5,Sun Feb 8 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"Plus, he didn't swap it for cockney. He has distinct South London accent. They are very different. It's like the writer just went ""English accent that's not posh? Must be cockney. Oh and he did a Southern accent? Must be Texas."""
buffy,2v700z,AngelAmongUs,8,Mon Feb 9 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"""English accent that's not posh? Must be cockney.""   A lot of people don't seem to realize how many different completely natural ""London"" accents there are.

buffy,2v8eg0,chumpleji,19,Sun Feb 8 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"So in my book, Faith reformed before Spike. Thoughts? Anyone else agree?   True. Spike didn't truly reform until he got a soul because without one he was not able to understand the weight of the death and destruction he had caused.  Before this he had done many good things, but was using Buffy as a moral compass because he lacked a soul. Which is why he got darker when Buffy did in season 6."
buffy,2v8eg0,AngelAmongUs,2,Sun Feb 8 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"That's so interesting. I never really put together that they both got darker around the same time. I'm going to have to watch for that. I'm in the middle of season 5 now, so perfect timing. Thanks!"

buffy,2v7s5v,maxman92,10,Sun Feb 8 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly have to say that by making Willow into a witch of enormous power, her character arc leaves us with many more unanswered questions than we have with Wesley.  Willow become so powerful, yet for the most part she is just trying to avoid using her power, when there would seem to be so much more she could do with it.  It is almost like the theological Problem of Evil.  If God loves us so much, and is so enormously (or limitlessly) powerful, why does He not do more for us?  I would say the same about Willow.  That is not to say that I do not enjoy the character and her arc; she is certainly one of the key characters who made Buffy the great series that it is.  Wesley, however, is more understandable to me.  He has very real human limitations and works within them.  He also brought, in certain episodes, an element of comedy to the series which is very entertaining.  He can be both a clown and a hero.  In the end Wesley's doomed love for Fred is as poignant as Willow's doomed love for Tara.  So if the two character arcs, I prefer Wesley's."

I would say the same about Willow   Well said. There is no logical reason that Willow never tried to give Harmony (who told her she was unhappy being a vampire in season 4 and told Cordelia she wasn't able to feel true happiness anymore) or Spike a soul.  She raised Buffy from the dead and fought a hell god with magic in season 5, but didn't try to de-rat Amy until she was lonely in season 6."

I think that was reasonable and a pretty good joke. Willow spent a lot of time trying to de-rat-ify Amy before she was powerful enough to do so. Eventually it fell by the wayside and she stopped really thinking of Amy as Amy because for years she had just been her pet rat. As soon as it finally clicks like, ""Hey, I'm powerful enough to change her back now,"" she does so without hesitation.  As for the giving vampires a soul, I would agree that there's no good in-universe explanation for why she doesn't (ie any reason besides that would be a bad plot device since it makes 80% of the villains impotent and boring)."

buffy,2v7s5v,DaddyCatALSO,4,Thu Feb 12 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to go Wesley. Obviously I love Willow and I prefer Buffy to Angel, but I think he changes so much more. Willow develops a lot and gets to know herself more, but Wesley I feel like really changes to his core. When we first meet him he's this bumbling dufus and by the end he is devestated. He has betrayed friends and been abandoned by everyone at one point, lost the love of his life, tried to deal with this grief. He is really unrecognizable by the end which just can't be said about Willow at the end. I think at the end of the day he just changes more, and his changes are all character and less greater forces which I feel is a larger part of what effects Willow, i.e. magic."
buffy,2v7s5v,tvnerd25,2,Mon Feb 9 12:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say Willow.  To be honest, though, I don't actually see many similarities between their arcs (yes, I know they have a conversation about their respective forays into the dark side). But to me there are many more similarities between Buffy and Wesley.  Both are alienated from their friends and seek comfort in sleeping with ""the enemy,"" and for essentially the same reasons. They choose partners who don't judge them and who, despite being definitely ""evil"" (Spike doesn't have a soul, and Lilah is under contract to Wolfram & Hart), genuinely seem to care about them. The scene where Wesley breaks up with Lilah reminds me a lot of the scene where Buffy breaks up with Spike.  Even after the relationships are over, the dynamic between Wesley/Lilah and Buffy/Spike is similar. The way that Angel and the rest defer to Wesley about Lilah reminds me of: ""All decisions regarding Hostile 17 are up to you."" And Wesley seems to care a lot for her, much as Buffy continues to care for Spike. There is a kind of understanding and respect and compassion that, again, I only really see with Buffy and Spike.   Obviously there are differences. But Wesley's darkness, to me, is not so much ""I'm in so much grief and pain over the death of someone when we should have been forever that I can't handle it and am going to destroy the world."" It's more the Buffy season 6 type darkness.   Wesley never gets there. Willow is the one who has the redemptive arc, and I find it much more interesting."
buffy,2v7s5v,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Feb 9 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"there are many more similarities between Buffy and Wesley.   Spot on. There is a scene in ""As You Were"" where Riley comes back and Buffy enters Spike's crypt and sets up a ""fantasy scenario"" for herself (unbeknownst to Spike who answers genuinely).   BUFFY: (quietly) Tell me you love me. SPIKE: (surprised) I love you. You know I do.   She takes a couple of steps closer.   BUFFY: Tell me you want me. SPIKE: (whispers) I always want you. In point of fact- BUFFY: Shut up.    Compare this to Lilah dressing up as ""Fred"" and Wesley telling her to leave the glasses on in ""Habeas Corpses"".  The only difference between Lilah and Spike is Spike not being able to understand the extent to which Buffy is using him."
buffy,2v7s5v,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"You think Spike didn't know? I think part of him knew, and he hated it. Maybe not as much as Lilah, but I think Lilah is just more OK with it.   Spike was devastated that Buffy couldn't love him, and he wanted to be ""the kind of man who would never."" Lilah's pretty broken up over Wesley (""I could wear the glasses again""), but actually changing to be with him isn't something she considers. Or maybe she just knows that she can't. Spike can get his soul, but Wolfram & Hart seems to have a tight lock on hers.  The other similarity between Buffy and Wesley is that both of them choose relationships where they can be dominating and abusive, and this is ""OK"" because the people they're with are evil."
buffy,2v7s5v,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Feb 9 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"I think part of him knew, and he hated it. Maybe not as much as Lilah, though.   Part of him also thought that she was living in a state of denial about not loving him. That her conflicted behavior towards him was because of that and not from her deepened depression from being brought back or guilt for using someone selfishly. It wasn’t until he gained a soul that he was able to figure out why she had been behaving the way she was.   BUFFY: So I'm thinking, sleeping with you...  BUFFY: (cont'd) They'll deal.  Spike watches her go then drops the Second Vamp. The vamp reacts with surprise at being free, then takes off running at Buffy's retreating back, fangs bared.  SPIKE: (calling after her) In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?  The Second Vamp can't help looking back at Spike at that. Buffy turns around, calmly STAKES the Second Vamp. She keeps walking away as he dusts, and says:  BUFFY: Because I don't love you.  SPIKE: (to himself) Like Hell.    SPIKE:  I'm feeling honest with myself. You used me.  BUFFY:  Yes.  SPIKE:  You told me that, of course. I never understood it though. Not until now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.  BUFFY:  You figured that out just now?"
buffy,2v7s5v,AngelAmongUs,2,Mon Feb 9 21:57:42 2015 UTC,"I knew you were going to bring up that season 7 conversation :) No, I think you're right, I guess that was my bias; in spite of that conversation, I thought he really did understand on some level exactly where he stood. That the main difference was that he just couldn't stand Buffy looking down on him, whereas Lilah didn't have quite the same hang-up.  But now that I think about it more - you're right, there's really a fundamental difference between Spike and Lilah. Before Buffy rejected him in the infamous bathroom scene, Spike really never had any experience, ever, with the idea that emotions aren't enough. When Buffy says that she has feelings for him, to him that really is the end of the conversation. His entire life, he's always followed his emotions, and if he feels something, then that's good enough; that's all he needs to know, and he really can't understand why it wouldn't be enough for anyone.  That's the moral compass that he's lacking. He's always been ""love's bitch"" - whether it took him to new depths with Drusilla or whether it lead him to save Dawn, on a really fundamental level it was all the same. He was ruled by his feelings, and he couldn't conceive of anyone wanting to do anything else.  Lilah, on the other hand, has years of experience denying her basic humanity and emotions. She understands that feelings aren't everything, and she is more than comfortable with the idea that one can make choices in spite of emotion. She gets it. He doesn't. She doesn't want to believe it:   Yeah, yeah, I've heard that a million times, cowboy. We both know how this song ends. You, me, broken furniture ...   but she does.  Although, you know, the biggest difference I still see between the Buffy/Spike and Wesley/Lilah relationships is the way everyone else reacts to them. Even after Spike gets a soul, everyone - except Riley - gives Buffy so much crap. I could be wrong, but I don't think anyone gives Wesley any crap at all. The overall vibe seems to be ""we don't get it, but she seems important to you, so OK. Just want you to know Angelus didn't kill her. Sorry for your loss."" Her Wolfram & Hart colleagues are more snide about it than anyone ever is to Wesley.  Aside from the obvious and mildly disturbing gender implications at play here, this is essentially why I prefer Willow's arc to Wesley's. Buffy, Willow ... really everyone in Buffy is called out on their bad choices. There are obvious consequences; there are clear turning points; they move on. It's more optimistic. Maybe also a little simplistic, but ... I dunno. Wesley never has a scene like Buffy does in ""Grave."" Wesley, from the very first time we see him in Buffy, is a fairly ruthless - if naïve - guy who takes matters into his own hands about Faith. He steals Connor because he thinks it was the right thing to do. At the end of the show, he's still making the same kind of hard choices; he's still doing what he thinks is right. I don't actually see that he changes much at all. He doesn't go from black-haired to white-haired like Willow. He stays pretty gray."
buffy,2v7s5v,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Feb 10 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"He doesn't go from black-haired to white-haired like Willow. He stays pretty gray.   You're right. :)   Wesley's arc is not about any sort of redemption, but becoming hardened by his life experiences.  Betraying Faith for ""the greater good"".  Not telling anyone about the prophecy about Angel killing Connor ""for their own good"".  Kidnapping Connor ""for the greater good""  Shooting a person in the leg for not working on Fred's case in season five.  Killing his ""father"" for Fred.  He really didn't change at all. His personality just became weathered.   the biggest difference I still see between the Buffy/Spike and Wesley/Lilah relationships is the way everyone else reacts to them.   And they can't say that it's because Spike had tried to kill them in the past, because Lilah was in charge of many things that hurt the ""Fang gang"" and she had a soul.   Spike, even while soulless and not repentant of his past actions in s5&6, had turned a new leaf in a way Lilah never did. Spike fought along side the scoobies before and after Buffy's death and was trusted enough to be a caretaker for Dawn."

It was honestly one of the most important factors for me in my development growing up. I was six when I saw 'Welcome to the Hellmouth' live, and to this day, one of the best decisions I've made. So many lessons....  For me, Buffy really changed my world outlook on using talents/assets that you have to help others. I was always a really tall, big kid. I'm 6'7 and should definitely of stopped growing. I've done pretty much every martial art and sport at some point or another. When I was around 4/5, I knew I had a certain amount of power over the people around me. I wasn't a bad kid, but It was becoming apparent to me because of my size and the way people treated me. I was I suppose, kind of a kid version of Larry (but I haven't found out I'm gay, as of yet anyway)  What I'm so grateful for Buffy growing up, was that the show really taught me that having power over someone doesn't allow you to walk around or act like you're better than anyone else (hello Faith argument), or pass judgement, or use this advantage against them. But to use any talents that you have, in order to help as many people possible as you can. I'm not saying I go around in tight clothing breaking up fights wherever I go and always managing to throw in a cheeky pun. Or casting a spell to fight off a gang of drunks. But I really feel the whole concept of Buffy as a whole, stomped out any possibility there could of been of me turning into a bully, but at the same time, also accepting who I was (I myself was bullied for being a ""freak"" and being into computing). That's probably what Willow taught me most to be honest. That computing is cool!  TL;DR - Buffy changed my outlook on how to just generally help people in life, and just accepting who you are as a person. That's how my outlook on the world in general changed."
buffy,2v49lj,tclovescheese,2,Sat Feb 7 20:18:07 2015 UTC,Love it.
buffy,2v49lj,dryan0,6,Mon Feb 9 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"Buffy is my arm. It's like...an extension of myself. People say life doesn't come with a handbook, but I think it does, and it's called Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
buffy,2v49lj,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sun Feb 8 06:31:17 2015 UTC,This. Yesssss.
buffy,2v49lj,rawkfemme,5,Mon Feb 9 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"It definitely influenced me a lot. My story was similar to yours - I caught a live episode of Season 3 (Enemies) and was hooked. I recorded the old episodes on VHS that aired early in the morning and watched them all (sometimes out of order) and then bought the series on DVD and watched in order (and have re-watched many times since).  As someone who has depression, I looked up to Buffy as someone strong, even when she felt alone or when things felt helpless. She always fought.   I ended up getting a quote from the show (""without passion we'd be truly dead"") as a tattoo! It reminds me first to live with passion and do the things I enjoy because life is short. When I'm not doing great with my depression, everything tends to feel grey. There is no passion in anything I do, so having the tattoo is a daily reminder. Second, it reminds me of my love for the show and all of the friends I've made along the way who are also fans :)"
buffy,2v49lj,puddinhead,5,Sat Feb 7 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"It amazes me how many fellow fans there are, how many of us feel that a show had such an impact on our lives. I truly appreciate the man Joss Whedon is, he took the gift he was given as a writer and shared it with the world."

buffy,2v2qvj,_o_O_o_O_o_,2,Sat Feb 7 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"Rewatching Buffy and Angel, I realised how many lessons and morals I learned. There are also so many things that went completely over my head when I was a young teenager that I can really relate to now that I have matured."

buffy,2v1ydj,greatersteven,1 point,Sat Feb 7 05:26:36 2015 UTC,"Y'all are confused. Tara and Willow's first kiss wasn't built up at all, and with purpose: Joss had them kiss in the body in a completely un-played-up fashion because he wanted it to seem normal, because it is.  And the part about skipping to the kissing definitely wasn't their first kiss, it was after their big magic fight in S6 just before, y'know.   In conclusion, two separate kisses, neither played up all that much."
buffy,2v1ydj,Doublestack2376,4,Sat Feb 7 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is saying it was their first kiss, but that's not what the list is about. The list is about ""most satisfying"" kisses. While /u/rompenstein seems confused about when the ""can you just be kissing me now"" scene happens, I would say that that kiss when they reunite after the fight was pretty satisfying. Seeing them apart was such a bummer, so that moment when they got back together with that kiss was great!"
buffy,2v1ydj,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sat Feb 7 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"But in this list, the reason they are so satisfying is because of the built up tension wanting it to happen for so long."

buffy,2v1ydj,xeothought,1 point,Sat Feb 7 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was never a fan of Josh and Donna together, largely because, to be perfectly honest, he didn't deserve her.  I also tend to agree that Mulder and Scully were better when they weren't playing up a romance.  It sort of makes me feel very When-Harry-Met-Sally ""Can men and women really be friends?"" esque."
buffy,2v26j8,GinaZaneburritos,8,Sat Feb 7 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"When I first watched Doublemeat Palace, I was horrified by how bad it is, but it's kind of grown on me.  Season 6 in general, was a season that I hated while I was watching it, because it was just so depressing, but on rewatch I started to like it a lot better. Now it's my second favorite season. I feel like season 6 is far more enjoyable in hindsight, because you know where it's going, so it doesn't feel like 22 episodes of unpleasant hopelessness, but an actual storyline."
buffy,2v26j8,averagebitca,3,Sat Feb 7 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"You know, I feel like I might have felt that way about season 6 except for the fact that I watched seasons 5-7 first, so I just thought it was a pretty depressing show in general :) I actually fell in love with the later seasons, considered myself a Buffy fan, and watched those seasons a few times before I decided to get familiar with the rest of the show.   That was a few years ago. I've watched the whole thing now more than I can count. But it's kind of funny in hindsight :) I can see how season 6 in particular would be jarring if you'd seen it from the beginning."
buffy,2v26j8,The_Ripper42,2,Sat Feb 7 07:16:38 2015 UTC,Is there a reason you started half way through? Unless you watched it when it aired that seems a little strange. And even if that's the case what was your reasoning for not going back for your rewatches
buffy,2v26j8,TheCheshireCody,4,Sat Feb 7 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Well, OK. It's kind of a long and complicated story. :)  Basically I was introduced to Buffy by my then-girlfriend, who was introduced to it by her ex-girlfriend. The ex-girlfriend had, I think, seen it all, but thought that season 6 was by far the best, because of Willow and Tara and Spike and Buffy and all that jazz. So I think she started off my girlfriend with ""The Body"" and then through to the end. By the time I was around, my girlfriend had seen ""Hush,"" ""Restless,"" and all of seasons 5-7, and had also been told that except for those season 4 episodes, the rest of it wasn't nearly as good.  So, that's what I thought too. I remember getting excited seeing that a Buffy episode was on TV, except annoyed that it came from one of those ""prequel"" seasons where there were people I didn't recognize at all - like Cordelia, Oz, Wesley, or Ms. Calendar. And the episodes didn't seem much like season 6; they seemed a little lamer.  Basically I became such a big Buffy fan that I thought I should watch the rest of it. It's not like it was a big mystery, exactly, I was just told it wasn't as good. I knew Buffy and Faith had some kind of major history. I knew Buffy and Angel had some big love story. Then I actually went out and bought the DVDs, convinced my girlfriend to watch them too, and the rest is history."
buffy,2v26j8,TheCheshireCody,8,Sat Feb 7 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"I've rewatched the series a few times, and honestly I don't think there's much change from my first impressions. Glory was annoying as fuck, Riley was boring, the character development over the course of the series was brilliant.   Also, how could you not like Fear, Itself? Putting everything else aside, the ending was pure awesome. ""Who's a little fear demon? Come on. Who's a little fear demon?"""
buffy,2v26j8,Kikooky,2,Sat Feb 7 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. I thought it was a slightly scary, more-or-less throwaway episode with some good lines and a funny ending.  But it's the way everyone gets separated, and the dead guy talking to Buffy in the basement: ""They all ran away from you ... They always will. Open your heart to someone and ... But don't fret, little girl. You're not alone ... Anymore.""  And she fights the zombie things, as he says: ""No matter how hard you fight, you just end up in the same place. I don't see why you bother.""  I feel that it's the point of the whole show: you're alone, you fight, you hang on, and you realize your fears are not what you thought they were. Stand up and fight back, and reality changes. It seems hopeless, but it's not. Because behind it all is something small and easily vanquished. Evil has to manipulate, to trick and turn people against each other, because by itself it doesn't have any real power.  At least, I thought so. It's really the scene in the basement that elevates this episode for me."
buffy,2v26j8,Baseball_dusty,2,Sat Feb 7 04:57:35 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's a great episode, and one of the first to really delve into the actual fears and insecurities the Scooby Gang have. That would become a major theme later in the series, that this ""fearless crew"" were deeply human at the same time they were out being superheroes, and to see it touched on so well here I just loved. I also just really love the notion of a show about vampires and demons doing Halloween episodes."
buffy,2v26j8,tempotiger,2,Sat Feb 7 05:01:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. :) Well, I always was a little slow - I get that now ;)"
buffy,2v26j8,The_Ripper42,6,Sat Feb 7 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"I like Joyce a lot more now (before she understood her daughter was the Slayer, buffy just seemed like a wild-child). She tries her best. I still dislike some of what she tries, but I understand now that she's trying, not just being overbearing.  I appreciate Xander more, and am less mad for the things he does that I disagree with. Again, he's trying to do what he thinks is right. Sometimes I strongly disagree, but I can acknowledge that he's trying in his own way. Also, he's saved Buffy way more times than I ever noticed before. Just little saves that aren't really focused on, here and there.   I love Giles. I always liked Giles. But I saw him in the fatherly role. As I age, I see more and more of him as my peer and the gang as kids. I'd give that man a medal, if I could.  I understand less why the gang doesn't just stake Spike when he shows up neutered. The guy is bad! Just stake him and be done with it! Of course, I'm glad they don't because of later, but it doesn't really make sense why even Giles would not just stake him when he's tied up and no one is looking.  Edit: Also, my marry, fuck, kill has completely changed."
buffy,2v26j8,YourWaterloo,2,Sat Feb 7 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'm curious: what was your fuck, marry, kill before - and what is it now?"
buffy,2v26j8,anaffairofcharacter,2,Mon Feb 9 06:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reasons they don't kill Spike is that he's potentially useful. He can't hurt humans so he's harmless, but he can kill demons (and does) and has inside knowledge which they can buy.  Another reason could be that it's just unsporting to kill someone who can't hurt people. I sort of disagree with that, as he'd proven himself evil several times, but it does feel wrong to kill someone who feels harmless (the fact is he isn't though, he psychologically disrupts all of them causing lots of pain)."
buffy,2v26j8,sarah_bellum75,2,Mon Feb 9 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"Xander is Buffy's ""loyal opposition."" Especially in the early seasons Willow and Giles rarely ever strongly question Buffy's decision making."
buffy,2v26j8,heymeowmeow,4,Wed Feb 18 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"On my first watch I actually spoilered myself whenever something seemed to get too emotional - I just couldn't keep watching, I had to stop and look up what whould happen because the suspense was killing me.  Now, after I have let the story sink in and accepted it, it is much more enjoyable to watch everything and know what is going to happen.  After watching Angel, I am not as bothered by Harmony anymore.  And I love rewatching the second half of season 2, because my views of Spike and Angel have changed. The first time, I was kind of rooting for Angel in their interactions (the conflict about Drusilla etc.) because I wanted to see Spike getting shot down for once.  But after getting to know him better in the later seasons and watching ""Destiny"" (Angel S05E08), which tied their story together brilliantly, I actually feel so, so sorry for him."
buffy,2v26j8,heymeowmeow,3,Sat Feb 7 13:45:28 2015 UTC,I accidentally spoiled many things for myself by reading retrospective reviews of Buffy on Critically Touched. Whenever it happened I was upset because  I thought it would make the sad scenes less powerful… I was so wrong.

buffy,2uvgco,Upsidedownnightmares,9,Thu Feb 5 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"Don't be too hard on Connor.  Remember that he was raised in a horrendous hell dimension by a deranged vampire hunter until he was a teenager who landed back on Earth with no understanding of human society, fully indoctrinated to believe that Angel is an evil monster who must be killed, and having to figure everything out under impossibly difficult conditions that would drive anyone insane and did drive him insane.  Despite a number of truly terrible things that Connor did, and his feelings of self pity, I always felt that he was fundamentally a good person, and in the end he did choose to do the right thing when it counted the most.  In the end only Connor could save the world from Jasmine, and he finally did.  And of course, he also did the right thing in the grand finale of the series.  I felt that his personal evolution was the most painful of any character - although Faith at least comes close - and in the end, his basic strength of character did pay off."
buffy,2uvgco,excultist,13,Thu Feb 5 18:10:26 2015 UTC,The same actor is on Mad Men and I can't stand that character either... I think the actors mannerisms just rub me wrong.
buffy,2uvgco,FeralHousewife,8,Thu Feb 5 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"I did watch Vincent Kartheiser on Mad Men and I hated that character, who is the epitome of all that was wrong with the decade of the 1950's.  Of course, that is exactly what the role calls for, so Vincent Kartheiser played the roll well.  He also appears in a brilliant science fiction movie called ""In Time"" in which he plays an evil plutocrat.  Vincent Kartheiser, for whatever reason, seems to have made a career of playing characters who are difficult to like.  But I still feel a definite fondness for Connor."
buffy,2uvgco,excultist,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"It's that same slimy feel that wasn't quite fully developed in Conner that made me twitch watching Mad Men.

buffy,2uvgco,FeralHousewife,5,Thu Feb 5 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"Connor has a mixture of good and bad qualities; in Mad Men we see only bad qualities.  I think that the purpose of Mad Men is to show just how terrible the prevailing social attitudes of the 1950's really were.  Speaking as a person who actually lived through most of the 1950's (I was born in 1952) I can say that this series seems to be remarkably accurate.  America in that decade was bloated with self-satisfaction at having played a decisive role in defeating fascism in the previous decade, and in being the vanguard of technological progress in the world, while being utterly blind to its own stupid mistakes (everybody loved to smoke cigarettes, etc.) and prejudices."
buffy,2uvgco,excultist,2,Thu Feb 5 18:45:25 2015 UTC,I may have to go watch something else he is in to figure out if it's just the actor... Even when Conner is being good I still feel like he is lying to me about something.
buffy,2uvgco,FeralHousewife,2,Thu Feb 5 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"Try the movie ""In Time"" which is a truly great movie, well worth watching for its own sake, and an interesting performance by Vincent Kartheiser."

buffy,2uvgco,excultist,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely, the attitudes lingered on, no doubt about that.  Part of what makes the show so interesting is how it deals with the older characters who still have that 50's attitude clashing with younger characters and a larger society that are beginning to embrace youth culture and diversity."

buffy,2uvgco,cptjmshook,4,Thu Feb 5 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"That is a fascinating analysis.  I had not thought about it that deeply, since I decided that I didn't really like Mad Men anyway and stopped watching it very quickly.  But I have to agree, there are remarkable parallels to the two roles that Vincent Kartheiser plays in the two TV series.  While Cordelia is not Connor's mother, she is very close to Angel, Connor's father, so her liaison with Connor is at least quasi-oedipal.  I know that a number of people have expressed their dislike for the character of Connor, but I like him.  I find that the supernatural elements are interesting.  There is a moment when Connor realizes that he is the son of two vampires but does not know what this makes him; he stands in front of a bathroom mirror and tries to make a demonic face, which he can't since he is not actually a vampire.  I have to sympathize with his identity crisis (not unlike the one Dawn has when she discovers that she is a synthetic person created by a magic spell, rather than being the normal human being whom she thought she was).  This is poignant.  There are many fascinating ironies which result from this character, especially in the episode ""Origin"" (season 5, #18) when he has fully assumed the life of a normal young man in the family he was given by the spells of Cyrus Veil, but then he is drawn back in to the world of the supernatural, so that he can fulfill the prophecy regarding the demon Sarjean.  When he threatens Veil with death if he should ever trouble his family again, he does so in a ridiculously clumsy manner; obviously he has no skill at making threats, yet Veil takes him completely seriously, because he knows that this seemingly ordinary young man is, beneath the illusion, the very dangerous Connor the Destroyer (as he was known in Cortath).    Even though you do not like Vincent Kartheiser's face or his voice, they worked for me.  There is no one else I would have rather cast in that role.  Leonardo DiCaprio could have played the role, if it had come along a little earlier."
buffy,2uvgco,excultist,3,Thu Feb 5 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I had the same experience where it took me awhile to figure out why I already hated Pete Campbell so much when I started watching Mad Men. I ended up finding him an interesting character, not just somebody I hate, in both shows in fact, but still."
buffy,2uvgco,undeadamerican,1 point,Thu Feb 5 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"he's also a creepy as fuck semi-narrator semi-protagonist in ""crime and punishment in suburbia"" which i feel is underrated."
buffy,2uvgco,DementedJ23,8,Thu Feb 5 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"I started watching Mad Men before ever watching Buffy or Angel, so for me it was ""Holy shit! Pete Campbell is Angel's son!"" as opposed to ""Holy shit! Conner is on Mad Men!"" What's interesting to me is that the characters are very similar, even beyond the general slimy/off-putting quality that may be attributable to Vincent Kartheiser and his unfortunate babyface and patrician accent. Conner is the literal son of Angel, the tall, dark, handsome, brooding, virile Byronic hero who is the central protagonist of the show. Pete Campbell is the symbolic son of Don Draper, the tall, dark, handsome, brooding, virile Byronic hero who is the central protagonist of his show. Conner has conflicting feelings towards Angel, whom he resents and sees as a rival even as he admires him and strives to emulate him, seduced into regarding him as a father figure and seeking his approval despite himself. Pete Campbell has conflicting feelings towards Don Draper, whom he resents and sees as a rival even as he admires him and strives to emulate him, seduced into regarding him as a father figure and seeking his approval despite himself. Conner continually strives to be a good person but keeps fucking up and hurting/alienating people because of the warped values and lack of interpersonal skills instilled in him by his upbringing. Pete Campbell continually strives to be a good person but keeps fucking up and hurting/alienating people because of the warped values and lack of interpersonal skills instilled in him by his upbringing.      In both cases, Vincent's role is essentially Oedipal: possess the mother and replace the father. Obviously neither Cordelia nor Peggy is his character's literal mother--indeed, Peggy is closer to Pete's age than Don's and the nature of her relationship to the latter is never romantic--but both do end up being the closest female character to their respective male protagonists, regarded by him as a peer and equal, and both end up situated beside their respective protagonists in positions of leadership, outranking Vincent's character in the hierarchy of the symbolic family. So it's no wonder we end up hating and resenting both of these characters so much, considering we've spent the entirety of these shows yoked to the perspective of the fathers they're trying to replace. Just imagine how much we'd hate Hamlet if his play were told from the perspective of Claudius, or Oedipus himself if his play were told from the perspective of Laius.      tl;dr: Vincent Kartheiser should play Oedipus."
buffy,2uvgco,cptjmshook,2,Thu Feb 5 19:33:23 2015 UTC,I've only see the first three seasons or so of Mad Men.  Did you forget that him and Peggy have a love child? I never did watch long enough to see if she eventually acknowledges she was pregnant/gave birth or if Pete ever found out he has an illegitimate son.  edit I feel wrong talking about another show on the Buffy forums... o.0

Buffy is my favourite character too, of course you want to be like the buff but the whole point is that she isn't special because she's the slayer, she's special because she's Buffy and i honestly don't see how her having a vagina stops me (or anybody else) from identifying with her. edit: ah immediately downvoted by the author, glad to see you take criticism well."

I think if you know Buffy well enough, which it sounds like you do, you can pretty much remember how the crossovers fit in so it's not a huge deal. Once you get past the first 2 seasons, the crossovers are few and far between anyway. I think the only time I got a bit confused was in the Angel episode ""Darla"", when I got a bit of deja vu wondering why it seemed so familiar (it goes side by side with ""Fool for Love"", with some shared flashbacks).  But I'm rewatching the 2 series side by side now and I do feel there's a lot to be gained from doing it this way as well."

buffy,2uuvmu,HomelessBoxBoy,2,Fri Feb 6 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"Consider the reasons why we like Buffy.  It is witty and ironic.  It conveys a sense that the characters take their situation seriously and react in ways that people actually could react in those situations.  The supernatural element is imaginative and carries with it a feeling of mythic depth rather than just being a silly or arbitrary invention of the moment.  There is real emotion involved, real loss, real happiness, loyalty, and a deep sense of personal responsibility to do the right thing.  There are very charming characters who we can come to regard as, if not our personal friends, at least people whom we would like to have as our personal friends.  There are lots of surprises.  Joss Whedon somehow never does exactly what we expect him to do.  And there is a wonderful sense of continuity.  Everything that happens in Buffy matters, and is not forgotten; it will have consequences in later episodes.  This goes a long way toward making the series convincing despite being a complete fantasy.  That's what we like.    So, how does Angel compare?  Everything that I observed about Buffy is also true about Angel.  It's all there.  But if it doesn't speak to you, I don't know, maybe David Boreanaz is just not charismatic enough for you.  The one fundamental difficulty with the series, which did not prevent me from enjoying it, is that David Boreanaz clearly is not an immortal vampire who does not age.  He has obviously aged, from his initial appearance in the first episode of Buffy, to his later years in Angel.  He personally cannot be criticized for that; we are all human beings and we all age.  But in terms of the mythology of the show, it was something that required me to suspend my disbelief.  When the character of Angel first appears, you can see why he is called Angel.  He has an angelic quality to him.  And later on, while there is nothing wrong with his appearance, it is not angelic.  But we overlook it.  It was unavoidable that only human actors were available to play the role of supernaturally youthful vampires."

buffy,2uuvmu,culus_ambitiosa,3,Sun Feb 8 11:26:57 2015 UTC,"I like watching them separately. All of Buffy, and then all of Angel. It's fun to watch the crossovers sequentially at least once, but honestly I prefer to keep the shows more or less separate.  I know that they take place in the same ""Buffyverse,"" but to me it seems like they occur in separate, similar dimensions. Prophecies are mentioned in the early seasons of Buffy, but they're vastly more important in Angel. Wolfram & Hart doesn't even appear in Buffy. I'm not sure if Hellmouths are ever mentioned in Angel, except as a reference to Sunnydale.   Angel is a fantastic show, but Buffy holds a special place in my heart."
buffy,2uu8s0,CalixeAthura,11,Thu Feb 5 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as Clem tells us, Rack ""likes little girls,"" and when Willow first meets him, he tells her that he's not interested in money - all he wants is to ""take a little tour.""  Willow isn't unique; he did the same thing to Amy, and I think it's safe to assume that he does the same with most of his clients (except those that do pay him in some other way, like Warren).   The way that he approaches her and the language that he uses - ""you taste like strawberries"" - is highly sensual. It seems to me that what he wants, and what he's attracted to and wants to explore, is her essence, in a way: her power, her personality, her potential. He likes young girls, so I think that he is attracted to their innocence as well. His brand of magic comes from a darker place, and I think that he seeks out goodness, and innocence, either because he needs or wants to take some, or because he enjoys snuffing it out.  I think he's much more interested in Willow than others because 1) she's new, and therefore uncorrupted as well as unknown to him (the point when he said ""I believe these two are next""), and 2) she was more complex than others. Complex in the sense that she had more capacity to absorb his magic and also, apparently, there was something about her ""taste"" that he enjoyed.   The metaphor for magic here is obviously drugs, and you can see Rack as some sort of mystical drug dealer. I also always thought the writing implied prostitution as well. Willow allows this (pretty creepy older guy) to touch her, to go inside her, to ""taste"" her, and in return she gets hours of euphoric haze. The fact that she opens herself up to Rack symbolizes that she is desperate to feel some sort of control (over herself, over what she's feeling), and she's willing to lose part of herself to do it."

They are not putting together a new complete genome from which a new organism will grow, they just exchange a small portion of their own genetics with other bacteria, to increase their genetic diversity.  Rack & Willow seem to be doing something similar.  Magical bacterial sex.  I'll give you some of my magic, and you can give me some of yours.  We will both gain in magical diversity."

buffy,2uu8s0,AGhostLP,3,Fri Feb 6 07:40:34 2015 UTC,"I always thought there was an exchange between the two. Rack recognizes her power-- he says something about her power coming off of her in waves-- and he wants it. Willow wants the intoxicating magic (drugs) Rack has. But, really, the takeaway is that Willow is pimping herself out to get high."
buffy,2uu8s0,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Feb 5 19:30:03 2015 UTC,'Just a little taste'  If we use the drug analogy it must be like somebody who is constantly high on one drug being offered something new. Plus by that point Willow hadn't become a junky and her magic was pure and powerful.
buffy,2uu8s0,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Feb 5 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that Willow's magic was ""pure and powerful"" at that point. She had done a great deal of magic throughout the series with good intentions - staking a vampire with a pencil, cursing Angel, teleporting Glory (one of the things I find most irritating about the Willow's downfall foreshadowing is how Tara is so mad at her for doing this teleportation spell and saving their lives) - but she had also begun using magic purely for selfish purposes. She had the best of intentions when bringing back Buffy, but the magic she used was unnatural and twisted (killing a fawn is a good sign that you're not doing the right thing). She used magic to ""make a fight disappear,"" she used magic to wipe away pain in ""Tabula Rasa,"" just as she did earlier in ""Something Blue"" - essentially she was using magic to escape and to control her surroundings so that she (and those she loved) wouldn't have to deal with overwhelming emotions.  Right before she went to Rack, she had just gone on some sort of all-night magic bender that reminds me of nothing so much as the Trio's creating an invisibility ray so that they can spy on the naked girls at the spa. It's the same idea of using power for petty purposes, to take what you have no right to, to find a facile kind of enjoyment and feel that everything is OK when really nothing is OK. The Trio were living out their fantasies of being wealthy and powerful and attractive, and, especially after Tara left her, Willow felt she had nothing to lose. Just as she tried to get over Oz by getting drunk at the Bronze, she gave up on trying to do the right thing.  The difference between Rack's magic and Willow's magic (up until the point that she went to him) is that Willow had always used her magic to do something. She created party decorations, she brought her friend back from the dead, she moved people into an alternate dimension to find Dawn, but it was always directed outwards. She wanted to make the world a better place. With Rack, there wasn't even the idea of changing anything; she just wanted to feel better. Everything that she had tried to do had worked for a time, but it always came crashing down. Tara left, Giles yelled at her, everyone got their memories back ... she no longer had enough power to keep up with the escalating pace that she needed to keep to convince herself that everything was going to be OK.  She cuts herself off from herself by letting Rack in and even convinces herself that ""none of it is real"" - as she tells Dawn when she sees the monster as they're walking home in ""Wrecked."" She's completely walled off from her emotions and just wants to be out of it. She has no idea how to deal with things, so she'd rather be in denial and believe that nothing matters.  She's in a dark place, but she's still young, and she has a lot of strength and goodness and innocence still. I think that's what Rack is attracted to. And she doesn't even place a value on it; she doesn't feel that she has a choice, because she's never been able to deal on her own.  I think Rack is also, like D'Hoffryn, attracted to her potential: he wants to nurture the darkness in her and is excited by the idea of what she could inflict on others."
buffy,2uu8s0,GinaZaneburritos,2,Fri Feb 6 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"I meant more that at that point her magick is pure in that it comes from her. Once Rack gets a hold of a junkie he gives them his 'tainted' magick and they become addicted so it must be novel for him to experience pure, untainted magick that he hasn't interfered with.   Also, in relation to your point I don't really think magick can really be good or bad it's just what the person does with it. Willow could levitate a weapon and kill a vampire or she could kill an innocent bystander, it's the same levitation spell either way."

buffy,2urr3s,ultrahedgehog,17,Wed Feb 4 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"Even though it's possible to identify potential slayers at a young age (like Kendra), there seems to be a certain ""window"" in which potentials can be chosen. A Slayer has to be old enough to fight, hence no baby or toddler Slayers. And she has to be young enough for the same reason, hence no geriatric Slayers. So it's true what Kennedy said: if a potential is not chosen by a certain age, she will never be. One of the shooting scripts mentions Kennedy being the oldest of the potentials at 19, so it seems Slayers are almost always chosen when they're in their teens."

buffy,2usmxp,ilais2,14,Wed Feb 4 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't watch the movie until after having seen all episodes. The movie is mostly fun to see if you're a Buffy fan because it's the show's conceptual predecessor, but otherwise it's a pretty bland flick.  Also, the movie and the show are pretty different; Joss Whedon wrote the script for the movie, but the way it eventually ended up was not how he had envisioned it. The movie isn't canon for the show either, so you're not missing out on any vital information or back story."
buffy,2usmxp,Beloit,4,Wed Feb 4 21:46:15 2015 UTC,It's up to you. I don't really think it's necessary since the TV show was basically an attempt to make what Joss had originally intended the movie to be.
buffy,2usmxp,heymeowmeow,5,Wed Feb 4 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"I would watch the show, then watch the film.   The film wasn't at all what Joss wrote or planned it to be. It was changed dramatically by the production company and the film studio.   I love the film because it's classic 90's cheese at it's best. It's terrible, in a really funny almost cringe-worthy way."

buffy,2usmxp,Nathasaurus,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:04:49 2015 UTC,"while it's not specifically the way the movie portrays it, the way I like to watch the movie is that it is a prequel to the show.  I think in the movie Buffy is a senior, or close to it, whereas in the show she comes to sunnydale as a sophmore.  I think if you watch the movie and imagine she is a freshmen in the movie, then you get the timeline a back story a bit more.  how she was called (though I think it's different then how it's portrayed in the show) but it shows her first stakings as well as burning down the gym that is referenced in the show, correct me if I'm wrong, been a while since i've seen the movie...lol"

buffy,2us08r,skeezycheeses,10,Wed Feb 4 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"The reason season four tends to be less popular than 2,3,5 is because the big bad is not quite as good as Angel, the mayor or *****.  Pros: It's much lighter(happier) than the other seasons with more comedic moments.  It's got some of the best individual episodes of the series.  Beer Bad is skippable, but it does wrap up things that happen in episode 3 (which is not skippable)."
buffy,2us08r,AngelAmongUs,10,Wed Feb 4 18:31:13 2015 UTC,I've always found Beer Bad to be pretty funny. Xander as the bartender? That Guy going on about Geosocioeconomic ramifications to get laid. Buffy's goofy cavegal face. Comedy gold.
buffy,2us08r,soyrobo,7,Wed Feb 4 19:34:16 2015 UTC,Lots of people love season 4 and you could be one of them. Don't worry about what other people think and just enjoy the series on your own. I watched it at a time when the internet wasn't prevalent and I'm so glad.
buffy,2us08r,mba113,7,Wed Feb 4 19:22:08 2015 UTC,Season 4 is my favorite season :)
buffy,2us08r,excultist,7,Wed Feb 4 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"Let us also remember that season 4 includes the episode ""Hush"" (episode 10) which is among the very best of the entire series.  I also thought that the concluding episode, ""Restless"" which is unlike any other episode in the series, is quite fascinating.  Episode 17, ""Superstar"" is quite funny, and we have to enjoy the lighter moments of Buffy because the series as a whole is sometimes painfully serious, as Buffy faces impossible odds and is not happy about it. And then there is episode 19, ""New Moon Rising"" which is a superbly poignant episode about the love of Willow and Oz, and the struggle that Oz has to go through because of being a werewolf, really an amazing episode.  Overall, I think that season 4 was quite successful.  The only season I would actually complain about is season 7, which I found to be depressing on the whole, because the struggle had become so difficult and seemingly impossible.  And even that season was still enjoyable at least sporadically.  But anyway, watch season 4, absolutely.  It's a great season.  Not to be missed!  As for your other question about watching the Angel series, if you really want to go for the most perfect way to view the Buffyverse, it would be to watch everything in the same order in which it was originally broadcast.  So the first season of Angel is happening at the same time as the fourth season of Buffy, and you could watch alternating episodes of each, to get the perfect storyline.  Episode 2 of BVS season 4, ""The Harsh Light Of Day"" is the beginning of a storyline which concludes in the Angel series episode 3, ""In The Dark"".  There are several other cross-overs.  Buffy visits Angel, Angel visits Buffy, even Oz shows up briefly in the Angel series, and Willow; Wesley and Cordelia both have major roles to play in the Angel series.  Faith has an important role in both series.  It is all connected.  But you do not HAVE to view it that way.  You could also just watch all of Buffy, and then watch all of Angel.  I think it would work well in either case."
buffy,2us08r,pweezus,5,Wed Feb 4 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"You have school, work, and bills coming up. Although I love television and consider Buffy to be my favourite show, your own safety is more important. I hope all of that works out for you.  I actually loved season 4. I LOVED Beer Bad and thought it was a great episode. On the surface, it seemed kinda bland but there's a deeper meaning to it when you look back on it. It's definitely one of the more memorable episodes.  That being said, season 4 is one of my favourite seasons in terms of character development and the development of relationships between the characters, more than the actual plot. That being said, it does have my least favourite character (Riley Finn) and my least favourite Big Bad (Adam), but it's still enjoyable for the most part.  I'd say every episode of Buffy is worthwhile and you should probably experience every episode to get the full Buffy experience. Even the weaker episodes have some crucial character development. And it builds up to the fifth and sixth seasons, which are the best seasons of Buffy in my opinion. Happy watching!"
buffy,2us08r,Sammyboy616,3,Thu Feb 5 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you're saying, apart from Beer Bad.  To me, it's trying to do the 'real life issues with monsters' thing the show is famous for (especially seasons 1&2), but it just presents it like to black and white of an issue.  ""Beer is evil and you should be t-total forever"" kinds feels like the moral."
buffy,2us08r,pweezus,3,Thu Feb 5 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Beer Bad made a good point about Buffy resolving her issues with Parker (the guy she slept with first at UC Sunnydale who ended up being a jackass...) and how with a clearer mind, you see things more simpler, which led to her hitting him at the very end. I'm not sure how much of a stretch that is, but I enjoyed that part of it. Plus, I found the entire episode entertaining.  Off-topic, but I thought the most flagrant attempt Buffy made at ""real life issues with monsters"" was Reptile Boy... where Buffy and Cordelia go to a frat party and then get offered as human sacrifices to a giant snake. Date rape drugs... giant snake... yeah."
buffy,2us08r,Sammyboy616,2,Thu Feb 5 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah, the giant snake was pretty bad.  And the thing about Beer Bad was that it wasn't that bad an episode - especially the part where she hits Parker; loved it - , but I just though the metaphor was just too on the nose (and a bit black and white).  I had similar problems with Wrecked, where Willow starts going to see Rac, and they basically just made her go to a magic drug den.  The rest of the episodes pretty decent, but that part was to close a metaphor."
buffy,2us08r,pweezus,2,Fri Feb 6 11:44:45 2015 UTC,I think Willow's entire addiction to magic was a metaphor... but it was one of my favourite storylines of the entire show so I didn't mind it as much. I just wish they carried on more with Willow's recovery in season 7 because I would have liked magic itself to be explored more since it is an integral part to the Slayer's existence. Sidenote: The Mayor was the only giant snake that mattered.
buffy,2us08r,Sammyboy616,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"It was definitely one of the best season arcs, I just felt that the metaphor started to get to close to magic = drugs in some of the middle episodes. Sometimes the way they talk about seemed more like they were talking about heroin than magic.  It just irked me how magic suddenly turned into a drug, when they could have done the addiction story-line a bit more subtly."

buffy,2us08r,averagebitca,2,Thu Feb 5 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"Riley Finn is a representation of what a Buffy character should not be. He's just a typical straight white pretty boy with a stereotypically masculine personality and a borderline sexist ""authority figure"". I just couldn't stand the way he felt superior to Buffy just because he was in The Initiative. Buffy is the slayer, god dammit! And he's just really boring and vanilla compared to all of the other well-illustrated characters of the show. Basically, he's boring and he doesn't deserve Buffy and I don't know why she liked him so much and I was happy when he was gone.  Sure, he had some redeeming qualities at certain points of the show and Marc Blucas is sexy as hell, but it just wasn't enough to make me like him."
buffy,2us08r,AngryWizard,4,Thu Feb 5 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of people charge him with being sexist.  I understand he had an inferiority complex because his girlfriend was stronger than him, but his boss was a woman and he had no trouble taking orders from her. I think he would have gotten over it with time.  A lot of people found him boring.  I agree in his first few episodes that he's practically intolerable. Seriously, until Hush (coincidentally the first episode where he has a far better haircut) his character is cardboard. But I really found him much better after that.  As far as being vanilla... I understand that happy people don't make exciting drama characters. But when it comes to relationships I don't like drama! I do agree that he wasn't the best boyfriend for Buffy, but I don't see that as being his fault. Buffy straight up says she likes Bad Boys, and that she thinks "" real love and passion have to go hand in hand with pain and fighting"". That's completely not what Riley has to offer. So no wonder they don't work out. Buffy wants some dramatic passionat affair. And Riley just wants happy comfort. I'm more of a happy comfort person, so I see more of myself in him, at times, than Buffy.  I understand they weren't right for each other. But I still like him."
buffy,2us08r,DaddyCatALSO,6,Thu Feb 5 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"Season 4 has a pretty bad overall storyline but some really great one-off episodes. I consider it far better than season one.

buffy,2un39z,mintyafrojb,17,Tue Feb 3 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"The Watchers Council is made up of people who generally care far less about the Slayer than they care about their cause. To them, the Slayer is a means to an end. It's why they have the Cruciamentum: there's no real reason for it, and the Slayer could easily die, but to them it's just to make sure they have the strongest Slayer available.   A Slayer is not supposed to have a life beyond her ""duty""; Buffy was the first to have friends and a life beyond being the Slayer. It's supposed to be all Slay, all the time until you die, and then that repeats when the next Slayer is called. Generally Slayers only last a couple of months. So they don't see it as necessary to pay her, because paying a Slayer would mean they care. And it would mean facilitating a life beyond Slaying, because with a wage you can get your own house, food, clothes -- it would mean the Slayer is no longer be dependent on her Watcher. And they need her to be dependent.  The reason Giles was paid, if I were to take a guess, is because he's a member of the Council. The council made those rules so of course they'd make sure they come out of it well. I guess you could even say that in the eyes of the Council the Watcher is the one bringing in the real work: doing research, pointing the Slayer where she needs to go, what she needs to kill. The Slayer is a tool and she's not paid while her Watcher is the same way you pay a farmer but not his ox, even though the ox is doing most of the physical work plowing the fields."

buffy,2un39z,ZombiKitties,2,Wed Feb 4 08:56:04 2015 UTC,"But this is where the fact that she and Giles no longer work for the Council comes in. The council makes sure the slayer is taken care of so that she does't have to have a life outside of the slayage, but Giles broke rules, and Buffy rebelled so they are no longer under the Council's watch, therefor she needs a job to take care of herself."
buffy,2un39z,CJGibson,2,Wed Feb 4 18:38:35 2015 UTC,Buffy was the first to have friends and a life beyond being the Slayer.    I wouldn't say the first.  Nikki Wood had Robin for instance.  But Buffy has a stronger connection to friends/life than most other slayers get to enjoy.
buffy,2un39z,WannaSnugle,-3,Tue Feb 3 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"Adding, slayers get stronger with each generation, in The Councils eyes it""s counter productive really."
buffy,2un39z,Beloit,3,Tue Feb 3 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true, though. I can't recall anything ever being mentioned about each new Slayer being stronger than the last, if that's what you meant."
buffy,2un39z,WannaSnugle,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:23:04 2015 UTC,I think it was mentioned during Buffy's encounter with the 1st slayer. When she learns about the Elders or whatever that made the 1st slayer that her power grows. Might be wrong though
buffy,2un39z,Beloit,2,Tue Feb 3 20:43:15 2015 UTC,I'm looking through the transcripts of Restless (first encounter with the First Slayer) and Get It Done (first encounter with the Shadow Men) but I can't find anything about that. The Buffy wikia page on Slayers doesn't mention it either.
buffy,2un39z,WannaSnugle,3,Tue Feb 3 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"Damn, im spreading false info."
buffy,2un39z,excultist,7,Tue Feb 3 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"My own feeling is that even if Buffy is not on a payroll and simply acts as a volunteer, she deserves recognition for what she has done.  By the time she goes to work at the Double-Meat Palace, she has already saved the world from the Master, the Judge, Akathla, Mayor Wilkins, Adam, and Glory, in addition to many other lesser evils (Moloch in season 1, for example).  Easily 6 instances in which the entire human race would have been destroyed or plunged into severe chaos, had Buffy not come through.  No winner of the Nobel Prize has ever done as much.  Yet Buffy gets no recognition or money.  Even is a purely strategic sense, it should be apparent that if Buffy has to spend her time earning money, she will have that much less time in which to perform her function as Slayer.  Would we really want to take the chance that the vampires or other threats will accommodate themselves to Buffy's schedule?  (Although in a sense they do, since she does run into a demon in the restaurant itself.)  But then, we could have made the same argument when she was in school.  It was often difficult for her to work around her class schedule while the world was in dire peril.  This is, in a sense, why the Initiative actually made so much sense (even though Dr. Walsh led them badly astray).  There should be a government agency that deals with supernatural threats, and Buffy should be part of it, and on their payroll, and getting all the back-up she needs.  Remember, she once had to get Xander to steal a bazooka from the army with which to kill the Judge.  She should have been able to simply requisition one, or if necessary, call out a full military response.  After all, she is saving the world.  But I understand that it is more dramatically interesting to see how she manages to save the world despite a general lack of support by the world that she is saving.  Joss Whedon never wanted to make things easy for her."
buffy,2un39z,Camdog_defaultPlayer,6,Tue Feb 3 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"My explanation for this is that traditionally the Watcher was paid and he was supposed to look after the Slayer, and in a way this puts the Council in control of the Slayer.   Now with Buffy, she's different and wants a normal life, has a family, and more importantly in this circumstance has a sister and a home to provide for. She doesn't want the Council to give her money because in a way this would cause them to have control over her -- ""oh, you aren't going to go do that thing we said? Well, no more money until you do"".   Now the problem is why doesn't Giles just give her money? I don't know."

buffy,2un39z,CJGibson,2,Wed Feb 4 03:28:46 2015 UTC,"Now the problem is why doesn't Giles just give her money?   If Giles is getting money from the Council, it'd the pretty much the same thing as taking money from the Council to begin with."
buffy,2un39z,-IAmNoMan-,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kind of thought similar, she despises The Council and doesn't want to have any dependency on them. But, that's a good point...cough up, Giles!  I wonder if he still gets paid in S6/S7 (you know, before Council Go Boom)...he should definitely be handing over the money in that, most crucial, period. Since he's in another timezone!"
buffy,2un39z,BadgerTwo,3,Wed Feb 4 08:59:24 2015 UTC,But she isn't under the council by then is she? I can't remember how she 'quits' the council but I know she does at somepoint(?) spoiler for somewhere in s7(maybe) Can anyone remeber how Buffy 'quits' the council and when she does? Because after Wesley goes (to join Angel;TS yey!) she doesn't have an official watcher. Giles was fired soon after Buffy turned 18 with that trial thing with Quentin Travers (sp?)

buffy,2ulwds,excultist,8,Wed Feb 4 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"Clem was actually the character I wondered about the most.  We have all these evil demons on Buffy, and then we have this weird anomaly, Clem the nice demon.  What does it mean?  Maybe it just means that you can never really judge anybody by their category, you have to know them as individuals.  But still he was very intriguing.  Beyond that, I would have liked to see more of just about everybody.  The series is full of interesting characters whom I would have liked to get to know better."
buffy,2ulwds,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Feb 4 19:47:09 2015 UTC,I think I've seen you commenting in /r/angel before. Within the greater Buffyverse there are a lot of examples of Demons who are nice.
buffy,2ulwds,excultist,2,Wed Feb 4 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"There are other examples, it is true.  Lorne is perhaps the greatest example, he becomes a significant ally for Angel.  He is also an anomaly, since the other demons from Pylea are not so nice.  Angel's partner Doyle was a half-demon hybrid.  At a certain point in the series it appeared that Skip was nice, but then he turned out not to be.  Illyria was a demon who wanted to take over the world but found that she couldn't, and gradually was persuaded to join forces with Angel and his team.  I would have to agree that Clem is hardly unique.  I still felt that he was a mysterious character.  If course, there is quite a lot that we are never told, about demons and their motives, origins, special powers, biology, reproduction, culture, etc.  The Buffyverse is very complicated.  If you remember the opening scene of the great musical episode, Once More With Feeling, we see Buffy fighting in one of the Sunnydale graveyards against vampires and miscellaneous demons.  There is this one demon with very impressive ram's horns on his head.  Buffy kills him with a sword.  I have never known whether she kills him because she had some knowledge that he was an evil demon who was going to harm people in some way, or just because he was a demon who therefore was assumed to be dangerous.  If Buffy ran into Clem in a graveyard, and had not previously met him, would she just have automatically killed him?  I do not really know the answer to that."
buffy,2ulwds,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Feb 4 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"The point you bring up about killing Clem had she not already known him is interesting and something I've kind of thought about before but usually more in the context of Angel S2 E1 where Angel kills a demon that he thought was trying to kill a pregnant woman but was actually her bodyguard. The woman thinks Angel is evil for doing so and Angel ends up kinda becoming her new Body Guard in a way (her ""Champion"" more specifically which, as a sidenote, is I think when they started using the term Champion all the time which for some reason bugged the hell out of me lol).   As an aside, you're right about the other Pyleans not being nice, but I think we should distinguish between not nice and evil. I don't think the Pyleans were evil. As far as I can remember, I think the only thing they really do that is evil is their treatment of humans as cattle/slaves, which I would argue is more a sign of them being unfortunate products of their environments more than evil. One thing I find incredibly interesting about Pylea is how it looks in comparison to our dimension. In our dimension, humans are in power and they regard demons as evil and therefore kill them. Arguing against the evil of (most) demons in our dimension would be a tough case to make. But then you look at Pylea where Demons are the ones in power and they keep humans as cattle. One could argue either way that this treatment is more or less evil than killing the humans. But the interesting part of the comparison is, what makes humans from our dimension so certain that their idea of good is actually good, when a Pylean visiting our dimension could very well see our dimension as being an evil place where evil humans treat demons with cruelty. It's kinda like the Cold War (or any war really) all over again where each side thinks that the other group is ""evil"" when really both are arguably evil. Sorry that got so rambly lol"
buffy,2ulwds,excultist,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about the demon whom Angel mistakenly kills in the first episode of season 2, ""Judgment"".  Demons can actually be forces of good.  Added to this we have the presumption that vampires are evil, which is almost always true, but which now and then causes people to make a false assumption about Angel.  So it's tricky.  You could certainly make a case that the demons of Pylea might be culturally evil but not inherently evil, just as human beings can be part of an evil culture but are not inherently creatures of evil.  But then, we have lots of demons whose evil is very clear.  Akathla still seems to be the very worst.  All he has to do is open his mouth, to suck the whole world into hell.  That's pretty evil.    There could be a lot of morally ambiguous demons.  Some demons could be trying to kill Buffy simply because they know that Buffy would kill them, given a chance.  Perhaps with some diplomatic negotiation of some sort, the conflict could be resolved without anybody being killed.  But then, most demons seem very aggressive and not inclined to negotiation.  There is such a great variety of demons that they seem to defy any effort to create a coherent picture of what demons are, and how people should deal with them.  You seem to have to play it by ear, so to speak.  There are many things about the Buffyverse that we will never know."

Buffy moping about Parker, Xander not being cool, the whole ""afterschool special""-ness of it all, applying for (and getting denied) ONDCP funding... it's just the worst.

buffy,2ulo0p,osburnn,4,Thu Feb 5 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"The episode that I most dislike is ""Helpless"" (season 3 episode 12) in which Buffy is subjected to an extremely dangerous and unnecessary test by the Watcher's Council with the full cooperation of Giles (even though he does change his mind when it is already too late).  One of the things which makes BVS great, is that Joss Whedon takes his own premise seriously.  Characters react in ways that actual people (or actual monsters) would react if they were in that kind of situation.  People take their mortal peril seriously, as they should.  I have seen plenty of other fantasies or action movies in which people have no concern for their safety at all, as if they knew that they were in a movie and there was necessarily going to be a happy ending.  Life is not like that.  If the situation of the Buffyverse did exist, with deadly vampires and assorted other supernatural perils, and a Slayer who was our only hope of overcoming or at least restraining these threats, and a Watcher's Council whose main function is to support the Slayer, it would be absolutely out of the question to take a Slayer candidate and put her in such a dangerous situation deliberately, actually robbing her of her supernatural strength to see if she could then figure out a way to defeat the vampire anyway.  That is ridiculous on the face of it.  Here is a person who has done nothing but good for the world and for the Watcher's Council, being tested in such as way that if she fails the test, she will die.  Furthermore, they do not get Buffy's consent for the test (and she would have been too sensible to consent) but they inflict it upon her through trickery.  They have no right to do that, and really, no reason to do it either.  If Buffy actually was not the true Slayer, she will die on the job anyway, no need to hasten her demise.  But it is even more ridiculous than that.  This episode is in season 3.  At this time in her career as Slayer, Buffy has already defeated the Master, has slain easily a thousand vampires (not that I'm counting), has defeated the Judge and Akathla.  She has literally saved the world at least 3 times, prior to being subjected to this test.  Why would the Watcher's Council not accept this as sufficient evidence that Buffy is indeed the duly ordained Slayer?  It is hugely convincing.  I am left with the impression that the Watcher's Council must be a bunch of lunatics, but then, that doesn't explain why Giles is generally so helpful.  And even Wesley, who enters the series as a very naïve Watcher, still shows himself in due course to be a true warrior for the forces of good (more so in the Angel spin-off than in BVS).  So it is hard to believe that the Council is just a bunch of lunatics.  The overall effect is that the series loses some of its consistency.  It does not make as much sense as it might have.  That's what bothers me."
buffy,2ulo0p,GinaZaneburritos,6,Wed Feb 4 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"It's definitely Doublemeat Palace oh my god. Even the cheesier MOTW episodes from earlier seasons have a sort of charm to them. But for some reason, Doublemeat really gets my goat. The colors are so bright and lurid, and the monster is so dumb and penis-y, and it's a reminder that Buffy the Vampire Slayer works in a bleeding fast food restaurant! (Which is definitely my least favorite plot development i in season 6, which is saying something.) And the twist ending is that....there's no meat in the sandwich! Gasp. BUT even this episode has its pros. Namely, Spike/Buffy alley sex. And props to Sarah Michelle Gellar for pulling off a neon orange chicken hat. Just goes to show that even Doublemeat Palace is better than most of the TV out there."
buffy,2ulo0p,DoctorVenkman,9,Tue Feb 3 05:13:19 2015 UTC,I actually like Doublemeat Palace...
buffy,2ulo0p,TheBlueDanNoob,8,Tue Feb 3 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"I like ""Doublemeat Palace"" a lot. Not many TV shows show so realistically what it's like to have a crappy job like that. In fact, I understand that they had advertisers threaten to leave based on this episode.  ""Another eight hours? On top of these eight hours? But that's ... so many hours. What's with the double-shiftiness?""  ""Because ... I want to be part of the Doublemeat experience?""  Plus, the introduction of Halfrek is pretty funny."

buffy,2ulo0p,clockworklycanthrope,14,Tue Feb 3 06:57:34 2015 UTC,"I love that episode. It doesn't particularly advance the plot, but once I get over my embarrassment for Dawn, I find it hilarious! I mean, I wouldn't list it in my top ten or anything, but I love basically everything Willow says in that episode. Plus, that sight gag with Buffy and Spike running around outside Principal Wood's window is excellent. The episode is thin on plot, but filled with funny moments."
buffy,2ulo0p,AngelAmongUs,4,Tue Feb 3 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"I love this episode too! And yes, it is impossible not to feel mortified on Dawn's behalf. :)   So many of the lines are great. From RJ's brother making fun of poetry in front of Spike, to ""she's recently evil, you know - well, so am I, why should I have to miss out?"" to ""Hecate hates that"" to ""you're older and hotter and have sex that's rough and kill people,"" I find this entire episode absolutely hysterical.  Edit: And for whatever reason, the line ""first with the lap dance, now with the cat fight - hey, wanna get drunk and barf next?"" is one of my favorites as well."
buffy,2ulo0p,GinaZaneburritos,4,Tue Feb 3 11:02:03 2015 UTC,"I love that moment where Xander and Spike are talking like they have this complex plan, and then they just run at RJ and grab the jacket."
buffy,2ulo0p,AngelAmongUs,2,Tue Feb 3 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"So do you think this was an ""Angel"" thing or a soul guilt thing?   They're standing on the front porch now, ringing the doorbell. An angel decorates the door jamb, and Spike avoids its glare.  While the brother's talking, Spike's inspecting the figurines on the curio cabinet. They're all angels. Dozens and dozens of angels. He starts turning them around, where they're not facing him anymore."
buffy,2ulo0p,AngelAmongUs,3,Tue Feb 3 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Ha. I guess it could be a soul guilt thing, but my money's on the Angel thing :)   I don't know if it's in the script, but it seems to me that it's not coincidence that the camera cuts to Spike as RJ's brother is talking derisively about his brother writing poetry. I've never actually noticed that he's turning the figurines around, though!"
buffy,2ulo0p,clockworklycanthrope,3,Tue Feb 3 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"money's on the Angel thing    Yeah, it's funnier that way. :)   One time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. Then he, uh—what do you call it? Blossomed. That's what it was like.   Spike's still walking around the room, looking at things.    I thought I remembered Spike glancing at him at that point in the episode, but it's not in the script.   I've never actually noticed that he's turning the figurines around, though!   I missed the angel on the door thing."
buffy,2ulo0p,GinaZaneburritos,3,Tue Feb 3 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"It also feels so out of place. Very little of the character interaction, even outside the spell effects, matches the episode before or after. The episode seems to exist in a reality of its own.  Anya robbing a bank was pretty great though."
buffy,2ulo0p,AngelAmongUs,8,Tue Feb 3 07:26:36 2015 UTC,"I think the whole point of it was basically ""this season is going to be full of downer moments and preachy speeches. We're not going to have a lot of time for funny, so let's try to fit in one really lighthearted episode before the season arc gets too far along."""
buffy,2ulo0p,GinaZaneburritos,3,Tue Feb 3 07:56:13 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that. It's different in many ways from the rest of the episodes around it, and in particular the scenes of Buffy, Willow, Anya, and Dawn all placed together on the same screen is something that no other episode does.  It does continue the classic Buffy tradition of having a lighter episode right before heavy drama. ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" comes right before ""Passion."" ""Smile Time"" immediately precedes ""A Hole in the World.""   Thankfully, it also goes the other way: ""Intervention"" comes after ""The Body"" and ""Forever,"" and ""Flooded"" and ""Life Serial"" follow ""Bargaining"" and ""After Life.""  I've always been a little disturbed that R.J. seems to find Dawn suddenly attractive after she pushes someone down the stairs. :/"
buffy,2ulo0p,AngelAmongUs,2,Tue Feb 3 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"I've always been a little disturbed that R.J. seems to find Dawn suddenly attractive after she pushes someone down the stairs. :/   That's right, and he's supposed to be ignorant (or at least the older brother seemed to be) of it's effects on others."
buffy,2ulo0p,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Feb 3 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, I feel sure that he knows, or at least has an idea. The way he looks at Buffy as he slips on his jacket outside the principal's office? The way he has girls do all his homework for him? The way he's not surprised when girls take out his rivals for him, or good things seem to happen ""out of nowhere""? Maybe it doesn't go farther than ""chicks dig it when I wear my jacket,"" but I feel like he sort of knew."
buffy,2ulo0p,Scendo,2,Wed Feb 4 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"I think it has effects on more than just people around it. The older brother said that RJ himself changed after he started wearing the jacket. That could account for his lost love of poetry and his approval of Dawn’s ruthlessness that he benefits from.  So while he probably knows to some degree that the jacket is having an effect on people, it might be clouding his own judgment."

buffy,2ulo0p,Chicken421,2,Tue Feb 3 10:48:02 2015 UTC,"I find Buffy's seduction scene here to be much better - or at least more realistic - than the one in the second season. I mean, we just had ""Innocence,"" and she comes onto Xander like Kathryn in Cruel Intentions. I feel like Buffy is still far too innocent at that point to pull that off.  In season seven, though, she has ""the sexual experience and stuff"" :)"
buffy,2ulo0p,Nathasaurus,3,Wed Feb 4 08:59:23 2015 UTC,"The episodes I don't really care for are Amends (S3) Beer Bad (S4) Where the Wild Things are (S4) Superstar (S4) Restless (S4) OMWF (S6) Beneath You (S7) Him (S7)  These are just all the ones I would skip in a re watch, I guess I don't know which ones are necessarily 'worse' than others. I think considering I would watch every other episode, in a show with seven seasons that I kind of expect not to like a few."
buffy,2ulo0p,Sammyboy616,15,Tue Feb 3 12:21:03 2015 UTC,Did... Did you just put OMWF and Restless on a worst episodes list?
buffy,2ulo0p,Nathasaurus,5,Tue Feb 3 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, haha, with the expectation that it would, of course be the unpopular opinion. What I don't understand (and I'm not speaking for every Buffy fan, of course) is that from what I read, the majority of people have problems with the so called 'MOTW' episodes. The main thing that they seem to have a problem with is that they don't contribute anything to the season and they're pointless and silly and blah blah blah. Yet that is one of my main problems with the two episodes you just mentioned. I guess everyone just has different things they like about Buffy and everyone gets something a bit different out of it and I think that's what makes it such a great show. :)"
buffy,2ulo0p,Nathasaurus,2,Thu Feb 5 08:18:45 2015 UTC,"I totally respect your opinions, but I would argue that both do add to the series.  Restless basically foreshadows the entire of season 5, as well as small parts of season6/7, and giving deeper insight into the characters.  OMWF also has some character development seriously important to season 6: Buffy having come from Heaven, Giles and Tara leaving."
buffy,2ulo0p,wowyesokay,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:11:29 2015 UTC,"I hardly even remember Restless, I've watched it through once and then tried a couple of other times, and it's just painful to watch.  That's true with OMWF, but honestly I just skip it and rather than sitting through that episode, I can see the only important events from it summed up in the ""Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Im open to giving them a re watch at some point, just not anytime soon haha."
buffy,2ulo0p,Nathasaurus,6,Sun Feb 8 11:35:32 2015 UTC,Curious why you dislike OMWF?  It's my go to episode when I just need a Buffy fix. Probably the only episode I've seen more than ten times.

buffy,2ulo0p,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Feb 4 07:23:59 2015 UTC,"I showed my friend Buffy recently, and Doublemeat Palace was the first one I showed him. It's still his favorite. I had no idea people didn't like it. It fits perfectly with the Season 6 theme of real life being the enemy Buffy is fighting, and is a great parody of what it's really like to work minimum wage jobs."

buffy,2ulo0p,Nathasaurus,2,Wed Feb 4 00:55:23 2015 UTC,I don't dislike OMWF but I recently rewatched it and definitely didn't really love it either. I actually like musicals and I'm not sure why everyone loves this episode so much. I've started to wonder if it's so beloved simply because it's in Season Six and isn't incredibly depressing or particularly heavy handed.
buffy,2ulo0p,Kevl17,2,Wed Feb 4 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"I honestly have just never cared for it, I like the fun and silly side of Buffy, but this just doesn't do it for me. I think the singing is really cringe worthy, and I don't like musicals in general. I actually haven't watched it in years now because I always skip it, but I am willing to give it another chance next time I do a re watch. I just honestly can't even remember enough of it to give a breakdown of what I dislike about it. I never realized it was so popular until I saw people online who always put it on their lists of favourite episodes, any family or friends I've ever watched it with all agreed that it sucked."
buffy,2ulo0p,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Feb 4 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like musicals in general   Yeah, I imagine that would do it. I'm shocked that everyone with whom you watched it felt that way, too, though! No offense meant (of course), I've just honestly never heard anyone voice that opinion!  Thanks for explaining! :)"
buffy,2ulo0p,Kevl17,2,Wed Feb 4 07:27:46 2015 UTC,"Haha that's cool, I seem to like a lot of the things about Buffy, that seem to be pretty unpopular with the majority of fans.

As far as I know, Faith and Joyce don't spend any time together later.  Is this line meant to convey that Faith has no problem making promises as Buffy, since she has no intention of doing any of those things? Is it a way of making Buffy out to be a bad guy in their eyes? I've never quite been able to make up my mind. Why does she keep telling people that sure, absolutely, sounds great, ""count on it""?

I did three years of an Education degree; it's really chilling how many people are teaching/administrating for just that reason.   I think he is fully aware of the Hellmouth, and who/what Buffy is. He's just not strong enough or smart enough to learn how to work the town of Sunnydale to his full advantage like the Mayor does. I'm not sure how much he knows about Giles or the Scoobies, but he dislikes them because Buffy likes him. He hates Buffy because not only does he recognize that she's better than he is in almost every way, she has the nerve to make her disrespect of him known. He hates knowing that he is inferior to her, and that they are both aware of that inferiority. Deep down he knows that if he gives Buffy a good enough reason to, she'd literally wipe the floor with his face without breaking a sweat, though, so even though he intensely dislikes her, he's careful to stay on the right side of school policies, waiting until he has a fool-proof reason to expell her.    f I remember correctly, Snyder certainly seems to NOT be on Mayor Wilkins's side in the stand-off in the school in 'Choices' where he catches them trading Willow for the box of giant spiders.    I always got the impression that he was terrified of what was in the box, and was jumpy about the whole situation, ready to flee at the first sign of trouble."
buffy,2ufs6p,cant_be_me,5,Sun Feb 1 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"I like your analogy a lot :)  I never thought he knew Buffy was the slayer, though. I don't think he really takes all the Hellmouth stuff very seriously. He knows things like vampires exist, but his job is to keep everything running as normally as possible and maintain the illusion. I mean, he thought it was a good idea to open up the window and help people leave in ""School Hard,"" where - because his life was on the line - you would imagine that he'd be on Buffy's side if he really took vampires seriously and knew that she could fight them.  I think when he burst in on the Mayor and Buffy and the box of spiders, he really thought Buffy was delinquent enough to be involved in drugs. I think the knowledge that the whole situation had something to do with the Mayor really threw him for a loop. He doesn't know, and he doesn't want to know. He wants to manage the school and keep kids in line, and that's about it.  He respects the Mayor because he's a powerful man; he hates Buffy because she's a kid, and a troublemaking kid at that who also disrespects him constantly. Also, he knows that the Mayor doesn't like her, but I think he doesn't really care to know why. I think he wants to pretend that the world really is that simple, and the Mayor is more than happy to let him do that.  As long as he can run the school and the Hellmouth aspects of his job are limited to him telling the police once in a while that ""it's a gang on PCP"" I think he's happy."

buffy,2ufhct,excultist,3,Sun Feb 1 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"We see other vampires besides Spike drink alcohol and eat food. So while they may not require the nutrition of food, they can still derive pleasure from it."

It still strikes me as an idiosyncrasy of Spike's that he not only likes food, but has a particular fondness for onion flowers.  I can't think of another case of a vampire having a favorite food, other than blood, of course, which is every vampire's favorite.  Admittedly, almost all the vampires whom we see on Buffy are killed so rapidly that we do not get to know much about their personality, beyond their vampiric aggressiveness.  Maybe lots of them actually had food preferences."

When he becomes human again in 'I Will Remember You' of ATS, he starts devouring everything in sight, because he had forgotten how good food tasted. This seems a little bit inconsistent."

In the first season of Angel he is shown eating dinner with a family and having eaten at least part of his meal. So it's not that he can't eat food, it just doesn't interest him to the extent it does Spike. Spike also watches more TV than Angel does. Angel seems to prefer to read.  s1ep17   Cut to the family and Angel sitting around the table.  Paige:  “More Brussels sprouts, Angel?”  Angel:  “No!  Thank you, I’m – full.

buffy,2ufv8t,tataha,4,Sun Feb 1 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"Since Bram Stoker, and Sheridan La Fanu's ""Carmilla"", the vampire bite has always been quasi-sexual. The neck bite is simply the nearest thing to a kiss. (Biting the face would be gross and couldn't be concealed for those serial nightly drinks that the 19th century vamps did). When Victorian prudery was over, the ""kiss"" was partly replaced in vampire fiction by bites on the breasts and thighs, with obvious symbolism. The fang is a penetrative thing, etc."
buffy,2ufv8t,TheBlueDanNoob,3,Mon Feb 2 03:35:21 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that their saliva has healing properties makes the most sense since they have accelerated healing themselves, plus their blood has special properties, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to suggest that their other bodily fluids do too. Although in reality, it's just because they couldn't get away with putting something that graphic on tv. There are plenty of times where people bled way less than they should have (For example, when Buffy slits that guy's throat with her skate blade in What's My Line Part 1.)"
buffy,2ufv8t,walkthroughthefire,2,Mon Feb 2 03:44:48 2015 UTC,"the reason they don't have buckets of blood spurting out everywhere despite tearing through main arteries is really just because it's kind of a family show, they just couldn't have had such realistic bleeding so often and still have aimed it at the demographic they wanted, but for an in universe explanation i quite like your idea that the vamps have some kind of mild coagulant in their saliva which stops victims from bleeding out on their own."
buffy,2ufv8t,faaackksake,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:13:27 2015 UTC,They might not want it to bleed uncontrollably.  So maybe there is something slows the blood so that they can draw it out as desired without it getting everywhere.

buffy,2udwu0,personahorrible,22,Sun Feb 1 10:45:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that Joyce is a good parent, and probably the best parent in the series (not that she has much competition).  A lot of the hate comes from the first two seasons, where Joyce doesn't know about Buffy's slayer status, so a lot of her punishments and groundings which seem pretty harsh to us, would be pretty reasonable from her point of view. Also she was extremely strong for her daughters when she became sick.  With that said, I don't think that what she did in Becoming is defendable. She kicked her daughter out of the house, which is bad enough already, but what really pushes me over the edge, is her reaction when Buffy comes back. In Dead Man's Party, she gets angry at Buffy for leaving, even though she told her to leave. That's probably the angriest I've ever gotten at Joyce.  In the end, I think Joyce is a complicated character who fucks up, just like all the others, and I don't think she should be hated for it."
buffy,2udwu0,averagebitca,10,Sun Feb 1 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"I understand that reaction to ""Dead Man's Party,"" although I have to say that I was far angrier with Xander (and, to a lesser extent, Willow).   One thing that this show has helped me understand is that people don't always mean the things they say during fights. In ""Becoming,"" Joyce's world was literally turned upside down. Something had happened at the school, a girl was killed, Willow was the ""second victim,"" the police suspected Buffy was involved, then Buffy came home with another older guy who had attacked the school previously. She saw a man turn to dust, learned her daughter was a ""vampire slayer,"" then overheard a conversation about taking on Angel (her daughter's disturbing ex-boyfriend). When she tried to offer suggestions and involve the police (a totally normal reaction), Buffy told her basically to shut up and let her deal with it. She was reeling and felt helpless and was scared. I wish she hadn't said what she said, but I understand - I think - why she did.   I think she was equally terrified in ""Dead Man's Party."" Buffy had just returned home, and now she was packing a bag, planning to leave again. I think anyone could be forgiven for flipping out a little - I just don't blame her much. In comparison, Xander's reaction seems to me extremely immature.  Either way, you're right - she's a complicated character who makes mistakes, just as they all do. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks she's not so bad. :)"
buffy,2udwu0,Zaiya53,5,Sun Feb 1 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you op. I had a friend who was dating this slimy scum bag loser who was controlling & used her. Not to mention emotionally abusive. She knew she shouldn't be with someone like him but she kept going back. I later found out that he hit her, was into beastiality & kiddie porn, & tried to run her off the road when she found out & broke up with him.   In the middle of this, before I knew the latter stuff, I performed an act of desperation. I told her it was either him, or me. Now, I know I should have never done that, I should have tried to be there for her, help her. But I honestly thought that she'd have to pick me. She knew how bad this guy was, he was terrible before the last of it happened. But I lost her for a few years because of that. Then all the stuff happened & he was out of her life for good.   I never wanted it to come to that, I wanted to save her from it, & I thought the threat of losing me would be enough. So, I get why Joyce did what she did. & I get why she got angry when Buffy tried to leave again. I was mad at Xander that episode, maybe maddest I've ever been (aside from when he never delivered the message to Buffy when Willow was trying to save Angel)"

This is probably a point we're never going to agree on, but I just can't get past Dead Man's Party. I would have forgiven her for Becoming, because like you said, it was a really bad day, and she was very emotional, and didn't know what to do. But I don't think she had any right to get angry at Buffy in Dead Man's Party for leaving, after she told her to leave. And did she really have to make a public scene out of it? Trust me, Xander and Willow pissed me off too in that episode, but I expected better from Joyce.

buffy,2udwu0,averagebitca,2,Sun Feb 1 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough :)  I always had the impression that Joyce made a public scene because she was afraid that Buffy would really just leave if she didn't stop her, no matter who else was around.  This scene has always bothered me somewhat too, but I feel that the more I watch it the more I understand where she's coming from.  It's interesting: if Giles had been the one to find her packing a bag, and Willow right there saying, ""She's running away again,"" what do you think his reaction would have been?

I'm an only child to a single mother as well (so obviously I'm talking more about the pre-Dawn era), which isn't something that's explored too much on TV - there's always a sibling or crazy step family or something - and I think they nailed it. Neither of them are perfect, the fact they only have each other to take their anxieties out on so sometimes things blow up and get volatile, but that's reality. There's no second parent to back Joyce up or to tell her she's maybe not doing the right thing, she has to just go with her gut. As for Becoming, it was a heat of the moment sort of thing. Had Buffy come back post-near-apocalypse, I highly doubt Joyce wouldn't let her back in.   I was so mad when Dawn got shoehorned in to the series because it changed everything for Buffy and her mum together. I couldn't really relate anymore.

buffy,2udwu0,SmolderingSkies,4,Sun Feb 1 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"On the topic of parents; what is it with Buffy's dad?  Not counting his dream appearance in 'Nightmares', where he represents a pretty reasonable fear for Buffy, he seems not that bad.  He treats Buffy well, she spends the summer with him, and he's seen talking to Joyce in 'When She Was Bad'.  Then, about late season 2/season 3, he turns into a major dick; missing Buffy's birthday, running off to Spain, marrying his secretary and missing Joyce's funeral.  Then in Season 5, they essentially have Buffy and Dawn retcon his history, so instead of him and Joyce breaking up he ran out on them. It's like, halfway through the series the writers forgot that the evil guy in 'Nightmares' was just a dream, and started writing for him and not the originally established character."

Willow's mother takes over the book-learned role, treating her daughter as an age-group. And then there's Faith's mom, passed out drunk all the time.

buffy,2udwu0,N4U534,7,Sun Feb 1 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"I think Joyce's early reliance on the parenting book style is a result of her recent divorce. She's suddenly taking on all the responsibility of raising her daughter and is searching for whatever help she can get. Plus, in her eyes Buffy is a bit of a delinquent.

(or at least he still did in 2004)  Nick prefers Faith.  Sarah prefers Angel.  David doesn't care at all.  Charisma prefers Xander.  Julie accused Charisma of sleeping with her son. (jokingly)  Charisma said that the Connor relationship was gross.  Nick hated the potentials storyline.  If Nick had to pick another character to play he would chose Spike, who is his favorite character after his own.  If James had to pick another character to play he would chose Faith.(2001)  If Eliza had to pick another character to play she would chose Spike.(2011)  James was sick a lot while filming Angel and was coughing up blood during the filming of the finale. They spent eight hours filming the cast being rained on with cold water.  David wanted to explore the Spike and Angel relationship more.  At a rare convention appearance together David and James were asked to kiss each other. They declined.  James' favorite seasons are Buffy s2 and ATS season 5.

Some of the body language from these vamps – again, all CGI – again, really beautifully done. The idea of the soul being the thing that elevates and kills him felt like a beautiful wrap-up. And again going from the epic to the humorous in a heartbeat; that's our boy.   [The Slayers leave the Hellmouth]  The girls kept walking through the beam: I had to explain, ""You're being chopped in half! Duck!""   [One of them trips and falls running down the school corridor]  And she actually fell, which was really fun. Because it makes it look real – because it was! And she wasn't hurt; nobody was hurt; it's all fake, it's okay.   [They board the school bus]  The idea of the bus: what can I say? Just felt right. It's a good way to get a lot of people out, and it's a school bus. You leave school on a school bus. That's what we did.   [Xander looks for Anya but doesn't see her body]  This shot, one of my favourites too. He's looking for her, she's right there, he doesn't find her. Those always get me.  [Buffy and Spike's last scene]  This was an interesting scene because both James and Sarah came to it from the wrong place, really. They were playing things falling apart, and the terror of it, and I said that what I wanted was for them to completely distance themselves from it. I explained how all the sound was going to drift out.  [Their hands burst into flames]  I thought that this was a sort of romantic image, the two of them. We actually did it with real fire but their hands were all gelled up and you could tell, so this was added CGI, and looks beautiful. I thought it was a nice comment on their relationship. But what I basically told them was ""Play the romance. Be proud of him. Love him when you say you love him. Love her when you say she doesn't love you. Forget about the crumbling world. For that period of time it doesn't exist.""   It's a cinematic trick but it's a necessary emotional one. I was surprised that they hadn't come there because usually the three of us come to a scene in exactly the same place. And this time it really was sort of different. And eventually Sarah said ""If you have what you think you need I think we should move on, because I'm not sure I understand how this works."" But I look at the two of them get together and their work is tremendous. But that is part of making TV and movies.   Sometimes you'll get a take from an actor that blows you away and they'll go ""Oh, I wasn't feeling a thing, I was thinking about something else, can we go again?"" And you're like, ""You just gave me gold"" and they're like, ""But I didn't feel it."" I'm like, ""The audience will."" Sometimes you can let them have another and sometimes you just say, ""Trust me.

Willow is put in danger a lot in the first seasons, then, as she becomes a stronger character, Tara becomes the one who fulfills much of that role. Dawn also, in the later seasons. But Buffy's pain remains pretty constant throughout."

buffy,2uclb4,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sun Feb 1 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's so interesting! I feel like I can always relate to Buffy. Are there any particular moments where you ""expect more out of her""? I feel like she does a better job in most situations than someone twice her age would.  I also think it's cool that the first responses all listed people who are not Buffy. Buffy goes through so much but doesn't act or seem like a victim, which is why I think people don't consider her the show's ""whipping boy."""
buffy,2uclb4,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"I just feel she should learn the life lesson to ask for help earlier....ex-her financial problems & spiraling into depression. She complains to the Watchers Council that ""she's only a teen"" and needs Giles, then shuts him out and can't handle herself."
buffy,2uclb4,nauoldcrow,3,Mon Feb 2 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I guess I see your point a little, although I disagree.   She does try to get help re: her financial issues; she has Anya take a look at the books, and mentions her worries to Giles. She tries to get a loan, and when all else fails she gets a minimum wage job to support herself and Dawn. I suppose she could make Willow and Tara help her, but that would really fall outside the plot of the season :)  I'm not sure what you mean by ""she shuts him out."" Do you mean by not calling him or whatever after he went to England? Saying, actually I can't handle this, please help me? Because I feel like she did that before he left, and he showed a lot of reluctance to help parent Dawn and do much more other than hand her a check that one time. I feel like he gave her no reason to think that he'd be receptive to calls for help, since he was dead set on ""you have to deal with this on your own, Buffy."" And she tried."

Then she moves to LA to become an actress, which she fails at, her friend who she is maybe interested in pursuing a relationship with dies, starts getting migraine-inducing visions that end up almost killing her on multiple occasions, is forced to become a demon, gets sucked into two alternate dimensions, has two mystical, unplanned pregnancies (three if you count that time demons laid eggs in her and she grew an eye on the back of her head), gets possessed, goes into a coma, and then dies.  I think the fact that Charisma was actually treated pretty poorly towards the end of her time on Angel probably has something to do with this, but I've always felt more sorry for her than any other character."

You could make a good point his Angels whipping boy as well, especially before the whole W&H takeover.   Faith as well. I come from a similar background to Faith, so I can really understand the character and why she is/was that way. I've always especially appreciated the whole letting somebody in only to get burned, then just not letting anyone in at all.

Putting all of the suffering onto one character isn't very creative and that's why Joss never did it.

I also expect a lot of school work was created, like science projects and creative things from kindergarten. Maybe minor damage done to the house or furniture caused when she and Buffy were playing that never got fixed."
buffy,2uc9db,Beloit,6,Sat Jan 31 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"This. It's impossible that the spell was merely memory alteration. The memories of everyone who knew Dawn would conflict with those of others in thousands of ways, i.e. every event Dawn influenced (see 'Butterfly Effect' or 'It's a Wonderful Life'). So you'd have to alter the memories of everyone who meets anyone who knows Dawn, and so on ad infinitum. I've always taken it to be a reality alteration."
buffy,2uc9db,TheBlueDanNoob,3,Sun Feb 1 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"This is true... They had to create an entire life for this being.   That means not only recreating memories for buffy,  Joyce and the gang,  but for every person that ever had personal interactions with them.   That means people like willow and xanders families, people who would eventually interact with dawn at school,  the people Joyce worked with,  her father,  his girlfriend,  anyone from their life in LA... Even though we never again saw him in the series (and i havent read the comics,  so I don't know much about his life now) once she was introduced,  they would have recreated memories for Oz,  who was living on the other  side of the globe and never really interacted with her,  simply because of his past relationship with buffy..."

buffy,2uavjq,AngelAmongUs,12,Sat Jan 31 13:10:09 2015 UTC,We are talking about souless demons here. I think it's quite obvious that many vampire would have raped people but Buffy is not the type of show to really delve into that in a big way. I think it's also heavily implied that Angelus raped the gypsy princess that incurs his curse.  I highly doubt that Spike is some special case and using Harmony as a benchmark is not the strongest of arguments as she was a very 'unique' vampire.
buffy,2uavjq,AGhostLP,6,Sat Jan 31 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that Spike is some special case    I didn't mean that.  I was saying that it is not automatically something all  vampires do. Are vampires more likely to rape than humans because of their lowered inhibitions? Probably, but most just want to feed off humans as shown in both Buffy and Angel.  What I was saying about Spike is that one line of dialogue creates huge implications to the rest of his characterization. That in order for all other canon we know about his devotion to Drusilla, and his behavior (style of evil) in modern and past times to mesh with that episode it could not have been something he did recently or regularly, but still obviously felt tremendous guilt for when he got his soul back.   I think it's also heavily implied that Angelus raped the gypsy princess that incurs his curse.   It's actually not implied. Other than that  Angel bit her leg and that he and Darla had sex  with her in the room all that we know is that he killed her. They could have just made her watch and then drank her blood after they were done having sex with each other. Any other details are filled in by the viewers imagination."
buffy,2uavjq,AGhostLP,5,Sat Jan 31 13:59:55 2015 UTC,Didn't Jenny's uncle say they 'defiled' her? I'm not saying every vampire always does that but just because show is vague about it it doesn't mean it's not happening a lot. I actually think Angelus was much crueler than Spike on the whole.
buffy,2uavjq,sarah_bellum75,3,Sat Jan 31 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Enyos:  So you just forget that he destroyed the most beloved daughter  of your tribe?!

buffy,2uavjq,sarah_bellum75,2,Sat Jan 31 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, must have remembered wrong."
buffy,2uavjq,AGhostLP,6,Sat Jan 31 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this has been brought up yet: I think you make some good points, but there is too much emphasis on ""rape"" being the sexual act. Have you ever read Anne Rice? Her vampires are essentially neutered, yet they are very sexual beings. The act of biting a human or another vampire is intensely sexual-- sinking one's fangs into another, penetrating them. In fact, taking blood from someone unwilling is described as rape.  So that conversation between Spike and Buffy-- I never saw that as Spike implying he was raping young girls. He's admitting to joyfully draining them of their blood. I suppose you can argue that pleasure he derives from doing so is akin to that of a rapist. But why go there? This is a TV show, after all-- one made for the WB. If you want that dark element, watch American Horror Story or something."
buffy,2uavjq,sarah_bellum75,3,Sat Jan 31 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"He's admitting to joyfully draining them of their blood.   Which was my original interpretation of that scene, but ""rape"" seems to be a   popular interpretation. Although it is never clarified if he was actually talking about rape, and if he is was, is he just trying to goad her into killing him by saying the most awful thing he could think of whether he had done it himself or not.  It is possible that it is being widely misinterpreted. There is a popular misconception that Angelus, Darla, Dru & Spike called their group ""The Whirlwind"" when that phrase was only used once in the context of describing Darla and Angel's relationship to each other.    This is a TV show, after all-- one made for the WB.   One made for the UPN, which is why content restrictions were so different than season 1-5."
buffy,2uavjq,SarieldeVergerberg,5,Sat Jan 31 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, but my question still stands. Why go there? And, yeah, I knew about the network change. It doesn't seem very relevant to the conversation at hand, though. If you want to go there, you could say the Spike/Buffy relationship never would've happened on the WB, or it at least would've had a different tenor, and then we're down a rabbit hole.  I've always been very big on author intent. What is the writer's intention in that conversation between Spike and Buffy? Is it necessary to imply rape to understand it? I'd say no. Spike is stating he's performed grievous acts to shock and anger Buffy. To say he's admitting to being a rapist is going somewhere you don't have to go to understand the scene.   But also there is my original thought which is that biting and sucking blood from someone unwilling is akin to rape for a vampire. So. Yeah."

It’s something I don’t even want to watch if I click on it, anything like that on TV, I have to click it off or I’ll put my foot through the screen. I wanna kill… They may be going back to that, you know I- what you see on the screen is just my terror at having to do that scene. There’s not really any acting going on. It’s just me and- and I haven’t watched the scene. I’ve seen little clips of you know, what’s happened before on Buffy [lowers voice]: previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They show it sometimes and I’m always like ugh, god.  I- oh my God, I hope that since Spike has the soul, he’s not capable anymore of anything like that. That’s what I’m really hoping. And I hope that they don’t bring him back to that state of mind. Yeah. I mean if you guys wanna get upset about the girl I tried to make a victim, there’s a point when they took the chip out, or they didn’t take the chip out, Spike thought the chip was inactive and he immediately went for a victim and it didn’t horrify anybody! So that’s why they had to put that rape scene in, to horrify you guys, and I was like, if you just would’ve gotten horrified before! But Steve DeKnight is a fabulous writer. But  when I showed up on the set that day, I told him sometimes you guys don’t know what you do, sometimes you do not know what you are asking us to do. And I’m proud of it artistically, but you know as a human being I never, never, never want to do something like that, and I will always refuse cuz I know what it does to me now, so. There was no acting going on. The look in my eyes is the terror of being made to do the scene... I wanted to slam my head into the pavement so I could fly away. They had to do it to have him fit into the theme of Buffy... if you're bad, you lose, if you're good, you win. Even so (the good ones) stumble, make fools of themselves, hurt each other. Spike was antithetical. Really dangerous for Joss and Marti — Spike had the potential to ruin the show. He does fit into the show now... he was ill-fit before."

I had thought ""we"" were safe watching (me as a rape victim & my adolescent niece). We were wrong. She was so angry and betrayed, & then got angry at me when I refused to hate him. She looked up to me as ""strong"" and felt like I let her down. She just kept insisting over and over, ""He tried to rape Buffy. How can you even look at it from his point of view?""   I kept telling her, ""I'm not going to hate an actor or character for something that was written for them.

buffy,2uavjq,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sat Jan 31 23:00:46 2015 UTC,"Is it necessary to imply rape to understand it? I'd say no.   I agree    Why go there?   There was a large ""Spike would never do that"" fan backlash after Seeing Red that David Fury in particular actually mocked fans online for back when the show was airing.  They had not expected the audience to start to dislike Buffy the character to the degree they did after ""dead things"" and they overcorrected somewhat. One of the writers made a comment wondering why some people were still standing up for the character after what had happened in Seeing Red.  Apparently the writers had intended that fans would feel sympathy for Riley when he was insecure about his relationship with Buffy according to  Jane Espenson, but sometimes intent doesn't translate to the viewer."
buffy,2uavjq,ModerateBias,3,Sat Jan 31 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"Well, that's not really what I meant. Yes, there is the one scene where Spike attempts to rape Buffy; but I thought we were talking about the implication that the vampires in the Buffyverse are serial rapists.   I guess I'll just say this: No, I don't think all Buffyverse vampires are serial rapists. When it's ever even remotely referred to, which is rare, it's more likely that the writers intended the ""rape"" to be that of taking blood with fangs. Rape was never an underlying theme in Buffy. The ONLY time it ever comes to the forefront is in the Bathroom Scene. Which I'd argue is not a vampire violence moment-- I've always thought that was a human moment for Spike, which makes it uncomfortable to watch more so than if he tried to bite Buffy."

buffy,2uavjq,DaddyCatALSO,5,Sat Jan 31 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"The metaphor of vampirism is rape. Even if the textual act isn't rape, symbolically it very much is. Look at Angelus, everything he does exudes sexual violence. For vampires, the line between sex and violence is so thin it barely exists."
buffy,2uavjq,excultist,3,Sun Feb 1 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that rape is not really ""normal"" for vampires. Humans are mostly sources of food.   However, it's not out of the question, because the overwhelming idea, I think, is that vampires treat humans for their own pleasure. Or, at least, being soulless they feel no compunction about doing so.  I think that the reason rape is implied so often in these series is that it raises the level of horror. It's interesting that you posted this now, because I was just watching Angel season 3, and there's a line somewhere that Holtz says about Angel ""violating"" his wife. And I was like, wait, what? Did I miss something?  Regarding the season 7 scene: I could easily believe that Spike had some sort of twisted phase during his time with Drusilla - when she was ""taking him to new depths"" - where he regularly raped children. I don't think it would be something he came up with on his own, but if it were connected to her, I think he would have. :(  I could also believe that Spike was lying or exaggerating to induce Buffy to stake him.  I could also believe that the writers simply got it wrong, but it doesn't really bother me the way that it's written. I think that Spike, although he is a good guy, really did do some fucked up things in his life. Probably cause he was hanging out so much with Angel and Drusilla, who both seem to have an affinity for torture.  Vampires in general don't. At least, not so much the ones we see."
buffy,2uavjq,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sat Jan 31 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"regularly raped children   While Drusilla did prefer to eat children, that seems highly unlikely.  ""Dawn's age"" is 16-17 in season 7   It is possible that either Holtz believes Angel's taunting or that we are supposed to believe he did do that and they just didn't set up the actual scene to match that."
buffy,2uavjq,jukeboxhero515,3,Sat Jan 31 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. And I think I worded it too strongly, I'm sorry. But there's not much I would put past Drusilla in terms of what she might find entertainment, that's all I meant.  I do think that rape is not something Spike would normally do. As you said, it's not in his nature."

A lot of feminists seem to take issue with the fact that while Joss himself is feminist and portrays many strong female characters, he also shows characters with non-feminist attitudes without always portraying them as inherently bad or evil. To me, this is just being realistic. Just because I'm a feminist doesn't mean the world around me will always reflect my beliefs (sadly), and just because someone has attitudes that differ from my own doesn't make them some sort of actively evil monster. Personally, I think the people who malign Joss for those writing choices need to chill.  Edit: Typo."

I guess by comparison to some of the other comic book movies out there, they're okay, but the dialogue is really diluted and not as clever as the writing on the shows he created.   I guess a lot of that is due to the fact that these kinds of movies need to be understand world-wide, but as a viewer of his other works, it's kind of stale.   Hopefully Joss comes back to TV, or some other media distribution outlet and creates something more intimate that I can get get my feelings crushed by. It's something I've grown accustomed to."

buffy,2u7h74,strawberryf1elds,20,Fri Jan 30 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think Giles is absolutely a Slytherin. I don't think he values knowledge for knowledge's sake, like a Ravenclaw would, and he's naturally fairly ruthless and cunning. He's also drawn to the dark arts, and he doesn't place a high priority on fighting fairly.  I like him a lot, but I think his most natural House is Slytherin.  I think Willow is definitely a Ravenclaw. I'd contrast her with Tara, who is one of the few Hufflepuffs I think there are in the show.   This is an interesting topic! I'll think about it more and give a more complete answer later.  Edit: OK, I think I've come to a decision about almost everyone. Here's my updated list (there are actually more Hufflepuffs than I thought there were):  Slytherin: Giles, Angel, Anya, Glory, Warren, the Master  Gryffindor: Buffy, Spike, Xander, Cordelia, Riley, Faith, Jonathan  Hufflepuff: Tara, Joyce, Harmony, Kendra, Graham, Andrew  Ravenclaw: Willow, Oz, Jenny Calendar  I put Faith in Gryffindor rather than Slytherin for a couple of reasons. Essentially I think she has a lot of Gryffindor qualities: she's daring, she's brave (even, sometimes, reckless and foolhardy), she's not afraid to speak up, she has a need to ""be a hero."" Her first impulse is always to act, and she follows her heart.   I put Riley in Gryffindor as well because I think this House most exemplifies his values. He has many Hufflepuff qualities, but he craves excitement and values chivalry like a true Gryffindor.  Despite the fact that she's a slayer, Kendra doesn't seem to have much of the ""hero"" mentality and seems like a Hufflepuff to me.  We don't see a whole lot of Jenny's personality, so I'm making some assumptions. But her free-thinking, irritated-with-ignorance intellectual attitude makes me think she's a Ravenclaw."
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,2,Fri Jan 30 20:03:52 2015 UTC,Your list is the one I most agree with. Great choices!
buffy,2u7h74,Scendo,2,Sat Jan 31 10:51:11 2015 UTC,"Your Slytherin nomination for Giles is spot-on, I'd say. Most people equate that house with baddies but forget that (Half Blood Prince spoiler), in the end."

Frankly, I'm jealous of your flair :)  It's not that I don't think Kendra is courageous - it's more that I think she had greatness ""thrust upon her."" I put her in Hufflepuff because I see her as essentially reactionary, in a way. She's suspicious of new ideas (""he's a vampire - he should die""), very rule-oriented, with a love of tradition. She wants to play her part as best she can, and do her Slayer duties; she has a respect for authority and will fight valiantly, but more because she feels it's her duty and not because she seeks individual glory, like a Gryffindor.   Of course, we don't get to see much of her personality, so I'm extrapolating. But that's more or less why I put her there. She doesn't want to be a hero, I think; she'd be happy - or maybe even happier - if she weren't ""called."""

He still threatens Principal Snyder; he still kills Ben; he still lures Buffy away from Spike because ""this is the way wars are won.""  He's not so much a thinker the way a Ravenclaw would be. He's not really a ""people person""; he's fairly private and risk-averse (in the sense that he tends to be cautious and not shoot from the hip), but when he takes action he does it mercilessly, and he doesn't shy away from these decisions. He doesn't spend a lot of time questioning himself or others or engaging in flights of fancy.  He has respect for traditions - also like a Slytherin. He's concerned with his public image - like a Slytherin. He appreciates knowledge, but not so much for its own joys as for what he can do with it.

buffy,2u7h74,laceyrocky,7,Fri Jan 30 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"Because I'm seeing this in the comments, Slytherin is not about being evil or mean. Slytherin is about being cunning and ambitious. I would agree that Anya would be a Slytherin because I think Slytherins are the natural business people of the Wizarding World. I would think Spike and Cordelia would both fit into Gryffindor assuming that we are taking their entire character arcs of the Buffyverse and not just their early appearances."
buffy,2u7h74,heymeowmeow,2,Fri Jan 30 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that Spike and Cordelia could belong in Gryffindor, but I think naturally they are resourceful and clever and self-reliant, even if they are also brave and noble (which Slytherins can be too!)."
buffy,2u7h74,clockworklycanthrope,8,Fri Jan 30 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"Spike has many positive qualities, but ambition isn't one of them (and even Spike admits he's not especially clever or cunning). Spike cares about love and comfort, but Angel's the man with the ambitious plan. When he's evil, it's to destroy the world. When he's good, it's to save it. Angel is the Slytherin.  Cordelia could probably go either way. She's both very brave and very ambitious/cunning. Honestly, it'd probably be up to her to choose which one she liked better.  Edit: Also, the idea of Spike as ""self-reliant"" is pretty hilarious. If I were to diagnose Spike with something, it'd be codependency. The man has no clue how to be alone or how to not be in a relationship. He'd even rather be with someone he can't stand (Harmony, for example) than be alone. Without a relationship, he literally falls apart (spiraling into depression without Dru, not being able to mentally deal with the implications of his restored soul without Buffy's help, etc.). He's arguably the least self-reliant person in the series (although an argument could also be made for Anya)."
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sat Jan 31 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why this is being downvoted. I agree with pretty much everything you said.  I'd say that ensouled Spike is a lot less dependent on approval, but he remains a pretty needy guy throughout the entire series. Passion and emotion and all the other romantic ideals are really what drive him, always. He always puts himself second, no matter what situation he's in. He likes to ""lose himself"" in the moment, whether it's in fighting or loving. He's a natural martyr.  He really is completely different from Angel :)"
buffy,2u7h74,clockworklycanthrope,3,Sat Jan 31 08:12:21 2015 UTC,"All true. And, obviously, as my flair would imply, I mean none of these things as an insult to Spike. He's my absolute favorite character! I just don't think he's a Slytherin! If I had to rate the order of houses he'd be placed in, I'd say Gryffindor>Hufflepuff>Slytherin>Ravenclaw. With Angel, I'd say Slytherin>Gryffindor>Ravenclaw>Hufflepuff."
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Jan 31 08:15:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, I never would have thought that not being thought a Slytherin would ever be considered an insult before now :)  Seriously though, I do think it's nice to have these sorts of conversations between fans. Clearly these characters are all important to us, but no one should ever get too offended. Plus, I know I've learned a lot by reading how others view this show! The differences are sometimes the best part! :) And no one I know IRL ever wants to spend hours talking about these things like I sometimes want to do :)"
buffy,2u7h74,clockworklycanthrope,5,Sat Jan 31 08:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just mean saying he's codependent and not particularly clever or ambitious could get people a little riled.  And, YES, I love hearing differing views and ideas on here. After seeing this thread, I described to my husband all the ways I would've sorted a lot of these characters differently. Like, I'd say Giles is actually a Slytherin and Oz is a Hufflepuff.  Giles - While he's obviously brilliant he's not into it for the sake of knowledge. It's all about what that knowledge gets him, and he's shown time and time again that he's willing to do whatever it takes to make sure things go according to his plan, whether or not those choices are noble or even smart. I've seen an argument or two in this thread saying Ripper was a Slytherin, but Giles has grown into a Ravenclaw, but I strongly disagree. He's the same person; he's just an adult now, and his cause is a better, nobler one overall, but he is who he is.   Oz - Super smart obviously, but he doesn't care about that at all. He was the highest SAT scorer to flunk senior year, after all, so not so much a Ravenclaw. Slytherin is out because he's not at all ambitious; he even says that he wishes he didn't test so well because that leads to jobs--something he doesn't want. He's had his moments of bravery, but it's not a particularly defining characteristic for him. In my mind, he's a clear Hufflepuff."
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,4,Sat Jan 31 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"Totally agree about Giles.  About Oz - somewhere in this thread I commented on why I think he's a Ravenclaw. Basically I don't think he's interested in school, or hard work (like a Hufflepuff would be), but I do think he's a highly individualistic person who really values his mind and thinking processes and is always an intellectual. It was tricky, though. If I had to pick Houses for him, it would be: Ravenclaw > Hufflepuff > Gryffindor > Slytherin"
buffy,2u7h74,clockworklycanthrope,5,Sat Jan 31 08:51:37 2015 UTC,"Totally valid point, and I see where you're coming from even though I see him as a 'Puff. I'd rate his houses the same as you did, except swapping the first two. I think Oz is up for a certain kind of hard work; he strives in his music. :)  What're your thoughts on Xander? I mean, I understand why the OP sorted him Hufflepuff, but the fact that he's this totally non-supernatural person who keeps coming back to the thick of it with the Scoobies (despite being the most likely to be killed, since he has no magic, special fighting skills, or book smarts about demons) is very brave. There's a possibility of Gryffindor to that, you know?  I totally agree with what someone else in the thread said about Riley: definitely a muggle. That's sort of the whole point of his character, that he is this normal, non-supernatural guy."
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Jan 31 09:06:39 2015 UTC,"Xander to me is an obvious Gryffindor. His first instinct is to act, he has a strong sense of justice, he'll throw himself into the fray without a thought for his own safety (""Yeah? Well, those of us who were born with feelings are going to do something about it""). Even his vices are Gryffindor: he's often self-righteous and arrogant.  Riley may be a muggle, but he dreams of being a Gryffindor, I think :)  What do you think of Faith? OP never mentioned her, and although I edited one of my comments to include her, no one else has yet brought her up. I lean towards the Gryffindor House for her as well. She has a lot of the same instincts and virtues. I don't see her as a Slytherin, really, even when she was evil. Although both she and Buffy do have a bit of darkness in them."
buffy,2u7h74,clockworklycanthrope,2,Sat Jan 31 09:17:48 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about Spike being codependent. But I think there's a difference between being self-reliant and being independent. And I don't mean to insult him by giving him the label of Slytherin haha, there's nothing wrong with Slytherins and Spike's my favorite character!"
buffy,2u7h74,Beloit,5,Sat Jan 31 08:01:39 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it's an insult either! One of my best friends proudly (and accurately) identifies as a Slytherin. I don't mean any insult to Angel here, either. I just think Angel and Angelus both exemplify Slytherin qualities, while Spike has literally none of them.   Two other quick things: I edited my post a little more right as you responded, just to clarify, so it may be a touch different now. Also, I upvoted the comment of yours I responded to; someone had downvoted it to zero, and frankly I hate to see people getting downvoted just for having differing opinions.

buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,11,Sat Jan 31 08:08:10 2015 UTC,"I always put Oz in Hufflepuff. Because while his intelligence may put him in Ravenclaw, education and knowledge are clearly not his main pursuits. Oz as a character is much more defined by his unwavering loyalty to his loved ones, and he also displays a lot of kindness, the ability to forgive, and a strong drive to help others. That, to me, puts him firmly in Hufflepuff house."
buffy,2u7h74,Beloit,3,Fri Jan 30 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"Nice! I was on the fence about him, this is a good argument for Hufflepuff. I like it"
buffy,2u7h74,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Jan 30 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know. After going back and forth a lot, I think he's a Ravenclaw.  He cares a lot for Willow, but he's only tangentially related to Buffy's group; I wouldn't say he's a group-oriented person at all. In fact, he's pretty self-sufficient. He spends a lot of his time just thinking about things; when he does contribute to the group, it's usually in the form of a witty line or else a well-thought-out suggestion.   He's not a knowledge seeker in many senses of the word, but he's an original thinker who is always thinking and values his own creativity and intellectual processes. He doesn't place a premium on practical knowledge the way a Hufflepuff would, nor do I think he needs to be part of a community to be satisfied with his life.  I could see him doing a Hufflepuff-like vocation like working on a farm and being happy doing that, but he's first and foremost an intellectual and would often be in his own head. His inner life is more important than what's around him.  So I think he's a Ravenclaw."
buffy,2u7h74,CJGibson,3,Sat Jan 31 03:14:50 2015 UTC,I'm just going to say: comics. spoilers  So I'm going to stick with Hufflepuff as Oz's house.  Edit: improved wording a bit.

Xander -  Gryffindor - Mostly because I don't really see Xander valuing intelligence and knowledge that highly that would put him in Hufflepuff. But Xander is certinally daring and brave, if not to a stupid extent at times :)  Giles - Ravenclaw  Spike -  Slytherin  Dawn - Hufflepuff  Tara - Hufflepuff  Anya - Slytherin  Angel - Gryffindor  Cordelia - Gryffindor (looking at Cordelia as a whole, not just in Buffy)  Oz - Hufflepuff (Oz is very intelligent, but I'm not sure he values it that much.) Riley - Gryffindor or Hufflepuff I can't decide on this one."
buffy,2u7h74,emdesch,3,Fri Jan 30 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"I think Xander is a Hufflepuff because Hufflepuff values loyalty and friendship, rather than intelligence and knowledge (that was more Ravenclaw I thought).

buffy,2u7h74,fsckit,3,Fri Jan 30 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"I can defo see that side and I wouldn't have any compliant's about putting Xander in either :)   But for me personally, Xander doesn't have the patience and ""fair play"" aspect of Hufflepuff. I mean, a LOT of the trouble Xander gets into is because of his lack of patience. And I'm not too sure about valuing hard work at time either. I of course agree with the loyalty aspect, but often at times it's misguided loyalty (especially season 1-3) more than devoted loyalty. I would say that jealously and stubbornness sometimes interject Xanders loyalty, which I don't see too much of in Hufflepuff.  Wheras Gryffindor does have that daring and nerve or someone who would overthrow loyalty in place of a self entitled state of bravery/daring.   But I can easily see Xander being a Hufflepuff as well, it's just the hard work and patience that edge Gryffindor to me."
buffy,2u7h74,sue-ra,4,Fri Jan 30 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"Xander would be gryffindor...  hufflepuff takes all the rest but values hard work.  Xander is a lot of things, but brave is definitely one of them, and noble usually another (other than when it involves angel, it seems)  Willow, like Hermione, could go either way.     Oz would be be hard.  he's got the brave and noble thing of gryffindor, but the brains of ravenclaw, and the loyalty of hufflepuff."

buffy,2u2rsj,pinky0926,55,Thu Jan 29 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"Well, Spike is really driven by approval, especially from women he either loves or hold in very high regard. He needed the approval of his mother. He needed the approval of Dru and eventually craved the approval of Buffy.   You could make a very good argument as well that Spike was more pushed into the good side, rather than choosing to go there. If mean, he can't attack humans after the chip, so he might as well start helping the Scoobies so he could ""kill something"". And that's really where Spike's further interactions with Buffy led him to seek that approval and thus, start behaving better. So the..   he starts doing good things despite not even having a soul    is valid, but to a certain extent. You could argue the chip was his artificial soul if you like. That doesn't mean Spike doesn't deserve good credit for his actions, but it's not like there was no intermediary factors in play.     But yes, he is hated because of all the bad things he has done. Which is completely his nature, by the way. Imagine if a Lion suddenly started raising baby Zebras or protecting Impalas?    True, but if I met a Lion and he tried to kill me the first time I saw him and all my friends, I wouldn't exactly trust this Lion. Also, if that Lion had a history of going out and trying to kill people like me, that would also build another barrier of mistrust.    Then he gets his soul back, and how is he treated? With resentment and more disgust. He's suffering in a basement going insane and (initially) nobody gives a damn unless they can pry him for information.   This is mostly true. However, Spike did tell buffy to go away after finding him trying to cut out his heart. And this is also coming off the attempted rape. Again, massive trust problems.   So really, yes, I have always certainly appreciated that a lot of the good things Spike has done go unnoticed/unappreciated. Even with the chip, Spike did things that Angelus never would, not in a million years, even with a chip.   But really, there is so much miss-trust when it comes to the Scoobies and Spike. He's tried to kill them. He's teamed up with other people trying to kill them. And he tried to rape Buffy. You have to appreciate the difficulty in trying to move on from those past experiences.   So essentially, yes, I can see your point of view and agree to some extent, but it's nowhere near as simple as saying ""The Scoobies are crappy judge of character"" in my opinion."

buffy,2u2rsj,DaddyCatALSO,32,Sun Feb 1 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"biggest reason why I liked Spike more than Angel, is that Spike went looking for his soul, went and bled for his soul and went and earned his soul so that he could be with Buffy, Angel was just cursed and as soon as he was un-cursed he went back to being exactly what he wanted to be; cold blooded murderer.  Spike wanted to be the good guy at the end of the series."

buffy,2u2rsj,buffybot_bot,2,Fri Jan 30 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"I still think Spike looking for his soul is a retcon. The way it was filmed was way cooler. Cooler in that it was ambiguous and he was like, ""I came here to get Buffy what she deserves,"" which normal Spike consciously means ""I want this chip out so I can kill her."" But the demon gives him his soul because that's what a part of Spike that he tries to ignore really wants.  But no. It's all retconned now (by Joss even?) to be Spike went looking for his soul. That's so flat and dull."
buffy,2u2rsj,CloudGirl,3,Fri Jan 30 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense though, because he could kill Buffy before he goes to get his soul. She is the one person he can hurt because she came back different."
buffy,2u2rsj,miscommunication_me,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a retcon... I've seen a lot of this lately on confession sites where they thought Spike went to get the chip out and shouldn't be praised for getting his soul, because getting his soul wasn't he ""intended to do""  Reality is, they made him say very vague unclear statements about giving Buffy what she ""deserves"", in a really harsh aggressive tone, to deliberately mislead audiences so they are shocked in the final moment when he's given back his soul.  It was essentially set up to make you think it was about the chip, when it was about his soul from the start. He asks the demon to turn him into what he was before, which could have meant ""a chipless vampire killer"" OR the before as in, his human self as William with a soul. He never clearly says he wants to be a selfish vampire murderer again on purpose, to make it go both ways and make people wonder what his intentions are until the last second of the season.  Even after the attempted sexual assault, despite the actors being uncomfortable and unhappy about the scene itself, they very purposefully make Spike's expression after Buffy finally kicks him away genuinely guilty and in disbelief with himself for doing that to her. He legitimately looks disgusted with himself for a few moments, and this is without him even having a soul.   He looked after Dawn during the gap between season 5 and 6 knowing full well Buffy was dead and not coming back to reward him for it, but did it anyways. He didn't tell Glory about Dawn and had no way of knowing if he would even survive or if Buffy and co would ever find out what he'd done, but kept his mouth shut anyways. He made giant leaps and bounds in the right direction before ever having a soul, and Buffy only seemed to go back to treating him like trash or a disposable evil animal the moment she felt attracted to him, and then suddenly everyone was disgusted by him again, and disregarded everything he'd done to treat him poorly.  So no, I firmly believe you really can't interpret that scene as anything other than him wanting his soul back. You can get the curtain shoved over your eyes for a few minutes, but it ultimately becomes clear what he set out to do.      As for the OPs statement, I tend to cringe whenever they treat him poorly at any point after ""Intervention"" in season 5. Spike has always shown signs of being more human or emotionally inclined than the other vamps, probably because his original human self was a highly emotional passionate person. In season 2 he makes a civil choice to help Buffy, and yes he gains from the arrangement, and leaves he to die, but he puts aside his nature to work out a plan with an enemy of his.   He also was always civil and kind and polite to Joyce for the most part, and seeing how he was treated when he genuinely was mourning for her made me cringe. He easily could have been a jerk to her and just not physically harmed her, but was polite to her even when he was a villain in season 2.  And I feel people get all to easily grossed out by his and Buffy's abusive relationship in season 6, prior to the sexual assault that I feel personally was OOC even for a soul-less Spike. They tend to gloss over that up until Once More With Feeling Spike was being genuinely supportive of Buffy and was the only one understanding of her or willing to listen to the negative side.  It always makes me uncomfortable to see Buffy turn on him the moment she feels attracted to him or romantically towards him. Before that she ""treated him like a man"" but the moment she kissed him, she went back to calling him a murderer, saying she couldn't trust him (even though she had until that point, for the last section of season 5, and the first half of season 6) called him a monster, punched him during conversations etc.   She was going through her own shit, yes, but the instant turn from mutual friendship and a quiet respect to, fuck you you are a monster who I hate, has always made me feel sorry for him. I would be flustered and frustrated and abusive back if someone did that to me, to have someone build up many episodes of reliance and trust in you just to have them revert back to primal hatred after a few kisses? I'd be pissed and confused.   She toyed with him straight up, dangerously exploiting what could have been platonic (as he was accepting up until she mislead him by kissing him) with someone she knew had obsessive qualities and who had to work a lot harder to ""do the right thing""   Jesus I am ranting. I don't even want to start in on her leaving him to rot in the hellmouth basement being tormented and driven insane, only to suddenly care and give him sympathy for being down there so long after he helped her.   /RANT OVER sorry I got all riled up"
buffy,2u2rsj,Mquestionmark,13,Sun Apr 12 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"I never felt sorry for Spike. I love Spike as a character and he is the reason I re-watch the show over an over again. I love watching his character arc and his struggle. He started out as a good man, before he was a vampire, but he was teased and dismissed. When he became a vampire, he found that the crueler he was, the more acceptance he got from his group (Anger, Darla and Dru). He came to like this kind of status and he enjoyed the hunt. Then, when he got his chip, he lost all his friends and his status. It took him a while, but eventually he found he could get a semblance of both (though not real acceptance) by fighting with the Scoobies. When he realized that it would take nothing short of getting his soul back for him to have even a chance of truly being loved, he went in search of the soul and fought for it. At the end of his struggles, he still had his romantic nature, but he had lost his cruelty, had gained a sense of humor and had earned the love and respect of the person who mattered most to him. This is not a journey to be pitied. It is one to be admired."
buffy,2u2rsj,catdoctor,10,Thu Jan 29 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Adding to that, I thought it was interesting when, on Angel, he said that during his time as a bad vampire he'd ignored all the hurt and pain that he'd caused while he was being all villainous and such whereas Angel, on the other hand, said that the hurt and pain was the part that he loved.  Spike's motivations seem really different from most other vampires, which is pretty neat."
buffy,2u2rsj,YourWaterloo,10,Thu Jan 29 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"Spike, to me, has a very child-like quality. He has no internal censor: he says everything he thinks and feels. He always goes for instant gratification. He's out to have fun and do things that feel good. It's not until he becomes involved with Buffy and the Scoobies that he actually starts to think about the consequences of living this way. When he goes to get his soul, he has decided to grow up. He is going to be an adult and take responsibility for his actions. In Season 7 he learns that being a grown-up is not always easy and no one applauds you for it. In a way, his immolation in the Hell Mouth is his graduation."
buffy,2u2rsj,catdoctor,2,Thu Jan 29 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. Spike had been kicked around all his mortal life, so when he was turned he went all badass and found that it worked in his favor. Who could blame him for it? He finally found his niche and then as the show progressed, he found that he had other talents and saw less need for gratuitous violence for the sake of violence. Spike did a lot of growing as the show went on, and I agree that he shouldn't be pitied. I do feel bad for his history, but it's part of what makes Spike Spike, so I think it's important to understand who he was to appreciate what he became."
buffy,2u2rsj,foreverhaunted21,4,Thu Feb 5 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thought I'd chime in here. I love Spike. He's easily my favorite character in the the series. I happened to watch Smashed today (season 6), which I found to be highly relevant to this conversation. In the episode, Spike hits Buffy during an argument. This is the first time he's acted physically violent towards her since she was brought back from the dead. To his surprise, Spike's chip doesn't react to hitting her.   What does Spike do when he thinks his chip had stopped working? His first instinct is to try and murder some random person to test his chip. It's terrifying what he puts his intended victim through. From her perspective, and those of all his victims, Spike is truly evil.  I love Spike. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that he was, without a doubt, very much evil before he got his soul back. Just not as evil as Angelus."

I didn't really understand rape culture at the time I wrote/drew this. I do now.

buffy,2u2rsj,LogicalChocolate,5,Fri Jan 30 04:54:38 2015 UTC,That was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.  slow clap
buffy,2u2rsj,catdoctor,15,Thu Jan 29 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"You know, apart from that whole stint in season 2 where he was a vicious murderer, all those flashbacks to when he was touring Europe with Dru/Angelus/Darla and committing what was essentially genocide, that time when he tried to become immortal so he could kill with impunity, that time he tortured angel for shits and giggles and every other little bit of psychopathic soulless murder Spike committed under his long existence as a vampire.  And saying that's all part of his ""nature"" is a cop-out, If it's all right for Buffy and the scoobies to kill every nameless vampire that pops out of the grave, regardless of whether that vampire has killed anyone or not, then it's completely acceptable to treat Spike a little harshly. In fact, I would go as far to say that treating him with disgust is perfectly reasonable, and potentially not going far enough. You also have to remember, most of the ""nice"" things spike ended up doing before he got his soul back were because he was physically unable to do ""bad"" things, no matter how much he wanted to. Indeed, its mentioned time and time again that although he helps them fight ""bad"" things, he doesn't actually like any of the scoobies, and would happily sell them out at the first opportunity, which you might remember, he does.   After he falls in love with buffy, the tune changes somewhat, although his motives are not exactly focused around fluffy bunnies and the power of true love, and he still does some pretty awful things - see, attempting to rape Buffy  Onto him getting his soul back. Initially the scoobies treat him with discuss because this is the first they've seen of spike since he fled after nearly raping buffy, and they have no idea he has a soul. You also have to remember, a soul is not a get out of jail free card, people with souls can be just as evil as people without them, and even with a conscience, Spike still needs to repent about the things he's done. If Spike didn't repent then that would show that getting his soul back had done nothing for his ways. If a murderer is released from prison after supposedly being rehabilitated, you still wouldn't trust him immediately. And later on in the season, well after Spike had gotten his soul back, I question that the scoobies only treated him with disgust, apart from Xander (which is an entirely separate matter), he became an invaluable member of the team, being trusted to train the potentials, go into the House as he pleased. While they could have treated him better at this pint cough Xander cough Giles, they weren't exactly torturing him for kicks, they even ended up spending a vast amount of time and effort trying to rescue him from the First.   In conclusion: Spike was a psychopathic murdering arsehole for the majority of his existence, and considering how the scoobies treat all the other vampires they encounter, with a couple of notable exceptions (Angel), their treatment of Spike is entirely justifiable, and it's nigh on miraculous that they decided against killing him when he got chipped up"
buffy,2u2rsj,excultist,8,Thu Jan 29 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's stupid that the scoobies hate him for being like that, that is part of my point.  Every horrible thing Spike did he did because he didn't have a soul. You may as well hate a Lion for killing a Gazelle. It's completely in their nature.  So I'm saying it's amazing that he did anything good whatsoever.   Sure, it's pretty stupid that they didn't kill him. I still pitied him though. His nature is to bite and kill and he can't do that. Then his nature is to feel bad because he now has a soul."
buffy,2u2rsj,catdoctor,8,Thu Jan 29 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"By that logic, the Scoobies should not kill any vampires. After all, what they do is in their nature."
buffy,2u2rsj,excultist,3,Thu Jan 29 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"In principle, if there were sufficient resources to do so, every vampire should be captured without killing it (as Spike was by the Initiative) and every vampire should have its soul restored by the soul restoration spell which Willow used only on Angel (twice if we include the Angel series as well as BVS) and should be rehabilitated and made into a productive but nocturnal member of society.  That would be ideal.  But very difficult to actually do."

Also, you have to realise it's not as simple as a Lion killing a Gazelle, because in that metaphor, human's are the gazelles, and i'm pretty sure Gazelles would hate the fuck out of lions. A more suitable metaphor would be vampires/Spike are ravenous starving bears, and we are the only close source of food   Edit: Not to mention the fact that Spike isn't a lion, he's a vampire, something which is sentient and looks very much like a human"

buffy,2u2ovz,LordLior,4,Thu Jan 29 12:22:42 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why someone who has already watched the whole series 20 times would need any help in deciding what the best episodes are, however, I am willing to give my opinion anyway.  Season 1, the last episode, Prophecy Girl.  It is a fascinating internal struggle for Buffy to decide that even though she is going to die, she still cannot escape her obligation to fight the Master - also the way everyone (even the Master!) compliments her on her white dress is hysterical.  It is as if etiquette transcends good and evil.  In season 2 the very best part is once again the finale, the last 2 episodes, in which Spike is forced to admit that he doesn't really want the world to end, evil though he undoubtedly is, and Buffy has to fight Angel and ultimately send him directly to hell, to save the world - in some ways an even more painful choice than the one she had to make in ""Prophecy Girl"".  Season 3, episode 16 ""Dopplegangland"" is the most interesting.  Our Willow has to deal with vampire Willow from another universe, who was accidentally summoned.  Fascinating interplay.  Season 4, episode 10 ""Hush"" is clearly a masterpiece.  The Scoobie gang has to solve the problem of The Gentlemen without even being able to speak.  Everything about this episode was elegantly done - the way the Gentlemen float along, not even having to walk.  Season 5, episode 16 ""The Body"" - a very powerful examination of he nature of loss.  Even in a fantasy, people can feel real emotions.  Season 6, episode 7 ""Once More With Feeling"" - my very favorite episode of the series, incredibly brilliant.  The humor, the music, the irony.  ""I can bring whole cities to ruin, and still have time to get a soft shoe in"".  Priceless.  Season 7  episode 16 ""Storyteller"" is my favorite, in which we get to fully examine the psychology of Andrew, last surviving member of the trio of evil nerds, and see how he is finally brought to face the reality of his situation.  A fascinating mix of comedy and tragedy."

For that, I recommend you take the four episode method: watch the two part pilot, Angel, and then finish up with Prophecy Girl.   Side note, I also really recommend Witch if your friends will go for one more episode. The introduction to Amy is pretty cool, and it's our first experience with magic within the Buffyverse."

buffy,2u1kuf,nSquib,6,Thu Jan 29 10:49:03 2015 UTC,"I liked the magic can = addiction storyline, because of falls into place with nearly everything on Buffy falling into the order of the supernatural.   Had Willow become hooked on caffeine pills or something stupid like that, it would have felt out of place.

buffy,2u1kuf,danielle_kb,9,Fri Jan 30 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"The actor did very well, considering the fact that he was playing a terribly written character. As an actor, he's wonderful. Just look at his performance in ""Helpless"" as the crazy vampire.   But love Rack as a character? God no. The entire ""magic as a drug"" storyline was so badly written that I have trouble believing it's the same group of writers. I personally believe they paid a crazy homeless man to write all those scenes. After vaguely describing some basic character traits of the people he'd be writing."

buffy,2u1kuf,therosewalker,5,Thu Jan 29 14:05:03 2015 UTC,That's your opinion but I completely disagree. I thought the moment when Buffy finds Willow and Dawn after the car crash is especially powerful.
buffy,2u1kuf,DaddyCatALSO,4,Thu Jan 29 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's not whether the moment itself is powerful or not (though I disagree on that too.). It's about the fact that magic as a drug makes no story sense. It makes no character sense. And it turned the corruption of Willow into an after school special about addiction instead of a thoughtful statement on the corrupting nature of power. Especially the corrupting nature of power when it is invested in someone who has felt as powerless as Willow.   The chance to contrast how Willow handled power vs how Buffy handled power was exciting. And it was ruined completely. Because that comparison doesn't work when magic is a literal drug that actually addicts people. Rack could have been a very fascinating character. And they could have explored addiction with another character, maybe one who made more sense (I'd've picked Xander)."
buffy,2u1kuf,barre_chord_reality,3,Thu Jan 29 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that magick could become addictive was explored very early on. Giles and Tara had warned Willow long before season 6. I understand that you didn't like it as a storyline but I think that's just your taste, it doesn't automatically mean it's bad writing.   I mean if we go right back to the second episode of the whole series we are shown the effects of magick abuse and how it can corrupt someone."
buffy,2u1kuf,jatie,3,Thu Jan 29 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. How it corrupts someone. Giles have tons of speeches about the deductive nature of power. About how magic always turned out to have a price you didn't fully understand. To be careful and tread lightly was his advice.   Not once until partway through the sixth season is the idea that ""oh yes, and magic is literally addictive in ways similar to heroin"" even mentioned.  You may like an appreciate the storytelling of that plot line. But it is most definitely bad writing. It ignores previously established character development in favor of the addiction concept. It also introduces major components of the rules of magic six years into the storyline with not a single hint before that addiction was even possible.   The foreshadowing you mention never even hinted at addiction. It was always about the corrupting nature of power.   It also turns Giles into some sort of monster. Really. Why is he letting teenagers handle this power that is literally addictive in a drug sense while also being a gateway to power beyond control.   It's already irresponsible for him to instruct Willow or encourage her studies in the first place. For him to knowingly allow her access to this amazingly addictive magic without so much as a warning about the addiction is monstrous.   Sometimes I feel like I come across too strong on this point. So if I'm doing that again, I do apologize."
buffy,2u1kuf,Emperor_Pilaf,2,Thu Jan 29 23:33:41 2015 UTC,Why do you think magick is corruptive- because the power is addictive. You are also forgetting that Willow is a special case because she had a natural ability that meant she was much more powerful than your average witch and this isn't something Giles could have predicted.   You are fine to be passionate about your opinion and that's great but just because you think it's bad writing doesn't make it so.

Just the speech that Buffy gives Jonathon about the fact that everyone is ignoring him because they are too busy dealing with their own pain really got me. I remember feeling that way in high school and not realising that others were going through the same things.
buffy,2u16xg,DrHELLvetica,4,Thu Jan 29 05:52:06 2015 UTC,"I can definitely relate to that. Earshot is an episode I think oft gets passed by in discussion.

Somehow, that episode always makes me feel better. To know that other people have experienced that, I'm not alone :)"

After my brother killed himself, people would always ask if we saw it coming/were surprised. Yes, we knew he has problems, but that didn't make it any less shocking/sudden/surprising."
buffy,2u16xg,catdoctor,3,Thu Jan 29 04:40:22 2015 UTC,"I loved that scene. I think it was really important for a tv show to express that. Often times tv shows portray death as such a foreign catastrophic surprise, and it ends up being the same old ""I never saw it coming, that's why I'm sad"" moment. I think it's important to recognize that sometimes the events leading up to tragedy don't necessarily define the tragedy itself. Being aware of the possibility doesn't mean feeling/accepting it when it comes. People like to give an appropriate grieving period in my experience, and that's not realistic to different circumstances/people."

My father passed away very suddenly like Joyce, just one random day out of nowhere.  And years later, my mother died after being a 6 year brain cancer survivor, mainly due to complications caused by a recurrence of the tumor, again similar to what happened with Joyce, though my mother's death wasn't sudden or unexpected like my father's.  I also can put myself in the shoes of many of the main cast and their different reactions. I know how Giles felt having to be the adult who dealt with the awful paperwork stuff. I've felt the anger that Xander had that made him put his hand through the wall. I've had to tell my family members about the deaths like Buffy had to tell Dawn at school. And I've been in Tara's shoes explaining to others how to cope and understand what was happening.  There's a reason that episode is widely regarded as one of the best of the show. More so than any other, it's honest and relatable, and it manages to be that way while exploring a topic that everyone experiences and no one can fully describe. The people we see on the screen all represent different aspects of how you might react to the death of a loved one. We see a little of ourselves in all of them."

Bit of background: my best friend and roommate of 12 years passed away last year (March 14th, 2014, to be exact), and I was the one who found him.  Watching The Body, all the stuff that goes on in Buffy's head, the panic, fear, forgetting basic stuff like CPR when you're trained, suddenly being stoic, feeling sick, cleaning up, and EVERYTHING is exactly (almost to a T) what happened to me when I found my friend.  Joss truly encased and very accurately displayed the reactions to finding a loved one like that, and I find it hard to watch because I end up re-living that night again in my own head (I was diagnosed with PTSD from the experience, so it really doesn't take much).  The second thing that gets to me now that didn't before is actually in the first episode (I believe called simply ""Pilot""?).  When the dead boy falls out of the locker, the makeup they did for him was damn near perfect as to what an actual dead body looks like.  That color of blue/grey for the lips, and the pale, but still colored face.  I literally had nightmares about that shade of blue/ grey since my friend passed, and that one half-second scene sends me into a fit of tears (very uncontrolled PTSD is, by the way).  I can honestly say I've never seen such an accurate portrayal of a dead person as that, and seeing it in real life, I [sadly] have a point of reference."

But in terms of hitting closest to home: ""Doublemeat Palace"" and ""Flooded"" sadly. I was was a few years younger than the scoobies when Buffy aired, and I had a hard time relating to the sixth season at first. It wasn't until I graduated from college that I realized how amazing and ""real"" the final two seasons were. Buffy goes to a very dark and isolated place, but most people do when they are forced out into the real world. I cry the hardest in this season, and watching her find strength, and her place in the world, through being a leader, and teacher in season seven becomes even more beautiful. Anyways, Doublemeat Palace and Flooded alway hits home in a really dark and sad way. Trying to save the world, but not being able to afford to eat. Watching Buffy try for the loan and get rejected even after ripping her skirt, and killing a demon for the manager always makes me laugh in a very sad way."

buffy,2u16xg,BrittBrat893,6,Fri Jan 30 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of scenes that I really relate to.   The scene that introduces Tara in ""Hush."" She's a quiet member of the group, and when she has something to say everyone talks over her, until one girl says, ""Guys? Quiet. Tara, you have something to say?"" And she smiles and shakes her head cause she can't be put on the spot. That was totally me most of my life! I have a theory that the first half of season 4 is funnier if you had a college experience like Buffy's. At least, I did, and I think the first few episodes are incredibly true and hysterically funny. ""I've heard about ten different issues, and I'm upset about each and every one of them"" - ""I didn't get Jell-O shots! I'll trade you for a 'Take Back the Night'"" - ""Well? Do we have a Klimt? Monet, still in the lead, but look out for team Klimt, coming from behind!"" Plus, I have known people exactly like those pretentious guys in ""Beer Bad."" Maybe not be-mean-to-the-bartender guys, but people who make up intellectual arguments about things like how philosophy would have evolved if everyone had been drunk. And someone introduces their pet theory - like ""Thomas Aquinas"" - and everyone shuts it down. Basically, the whole depiction of college life really hits home for me. I have Asperger's too, and I relate to a lot of what Anya says. To give a different (and not so depressing) example, her speech in ""Triangle"": ""You're referencing literature I have no way to be familiar with. You're trying to make me feel left out, and you're stealing!"" and ""Well, I couldn't know if I could until I tried, could I?"" Also - in another episode - when she is talking to Xander about their relationship, and he says ""these things just sort of ... happen,"" and she says, ""All right. How?"""

buffy,2twsb4,newton_figgz,10,Wed Jan 28 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"She has a fold-out desk too, you can see it in the picture, she just didn't fold it out. Probably intentional by the producers to make her look like she was struggling."

I'd guess that having her desk out would have made that movement more awkward - just to give another reason.  I have to say I never would have picked him out in this lecture hall if Joss Whedon hadn't pointed him out in his commentary for the episode.

buffy,2tx1x7,pinky0926,34,Wed Jan 28 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"Dawn, Willow and Xander turning on Buffy and kicking her out of her own house in S7. Out of character, just would not happen. Not often I call BS on Joss' writing but this was one time."
buffy,2tx1x7,TheBlueDanNoob,17,Wed Jan 28 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I do believe it. It's sad and ridiculous, but it's not like they haven't turned on her before. It doesn't help that when Buffy is feeling the most emotional (guilty, ashamed, overwhelmed - like she was at the end of ""Dirty Girls"") she rebuffs everyone's attempts to commiserate with her and goes off to deal with it alone.  Of course, it doesn't help that this time they were the ones who were hurting - badly - and she was the one who wasn't willing to engage in emotional soothing. They felt ignored and let down that they had trusted Buffy when she told them that this was the plan and then their fears were realized.  It doesn't help that Giles (who still remained a powerful authority figure to them all) had already taken an overtly antagonistic stand against her. And had unfortunately been right about it being unwise to go seek out Caleb. I think that helped give them the moral foundation to do what they did - they have a ""parental"" stamp of approval.  As for Dawn ... I believe that it was the message she got from someone she believed to be her mom that cemented her turning on Buffy.   Buffy had a hard enough time always connecting with her circle even before the First got involved. When it started sending messages to Dawn, putting out Xander's eye, feeding info to Principal Wood about Spike (which would lead to fractured group dynamics no matter how it played out), plus fooling Buffy into a futile attack that leaves girls injured and dead, pretty much anything can happen. Especially since Buffy's reaction is always to cut herself off from the group when emotionally overwhelming things happen to her.  Xander and Willow were so upset with Buffy in ""Dead Man's Party"" that I always thought it'd be funny if she came one week later - when Faith arrived - only to find that she'd been replaced by Faith. I think that's almost what comes to pass here: they didn't have another slayer option in ""Dead Man's Party"" - but they do in ""Empty Places."" And everything comes together to push her out. :(  tl;dr I used to think this, too, but actually I think it's a decision that makes sense - even if I hate them for it - given how we've seen them treat Buffy before and given the kind of stress the First is putting on the group."
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Jan 28 10:35:52 2015 UTC,"You've given me something to think about with the bit about Dawn, how her mother's words, 'when the time comes Buffy won't choose you' (paraphrasing here) might have colored her thinking. It's still hard for me to put aside the fact that Buffy sacrificed her life to save Dawn, and that should probably come with a lifetime supply of loyalty and leeway. But more than any other, I just cannot get behind Willow turning on Buffy. I cannot make it make any kind of sense."
buffy,2tx1x7,AngryWizard,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you would think that Buffy had proven herself to Dawn. But I think it's clear in the seventh season that Dawn desperately wants and needs to believe that she heard her mom, despite what everyone tries to tell her. And if you think about it ... Buffy sacrificed herself for Dawn, but I think she left Dawn with a little survivor's guilt too. All of the sacrificing gestures Buffy made are not ones Dawn even wanted her to make. Except maybe going to work to pay the bills, but what kid wants to know how hard that is for a parental figure? Plus, ever since she came back, Buffy never had much time for Dawn. Dawn loves her, but she still needs a mother. And when a vision of her mom came and told her to watch out, she needs to believe it. About Willow, I think her primary emotional ties are to Xander and Giles. Giles because he took her in after her dark phase in season 6 - I think she really looks up to him, more maybe than she does to Buffy right now. And Xander is her oldest and best friend, and he just got horribly injured. I think she wants to show solidarity with him, and I also think that seeing him hurt is really traumatic for her. When Buffy says ""I've figured it out - we've gotta go back in,"" I think this really scares her. Even if she agrees with Buffy, I don't think she feels emotionally stable enough to stand with her against Xander, Giles, and Kennedy. She still doesn't completely trust herself, and those are her anchors.    Just my two cents."
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Jan 29 10:52:22 2015 UTC,"RE: Willow's ties  I like that because, personally, I think Willow's relationship with Giles is much more father-daughterly than Buffy's. Buffy's relationship with Giles feels more like a trusted advisor/teacher to me.  Maybe this is just because I've been rewatching some Season 2 episodes recently, but I've been struck by how close Giles and Willow are. Giles first and only (significant) love interest in the show is Ms. Calendar. Giles is the dry, somewhat stern librarian, Ms. Calendar is the hip, fun computer teacher who's interested in Magic and then they have their little group of Scoobies including the HBIC Buffy, the fool Xander, and then Willow, the shy, self-conscious young girl who just loves to learn and program computers and has a budding interest in the magicks. Willow is the one who struck me as their daughter figure.   I just watched I Only Have Eyes For You the other night and I was especially struck by the relationship between Giles and Willow in one scene. Giles is in denial sorta about Jenny's death and he thinks that she may be responsible for ghostly activity going on at the school. Everyone else is quite certain it's not her and that the spirit is violent, so they work out a spell to try to exorcise the spirit that involves Willow, Xander, Buffy and Cordelia reading a chant at different parts of the school. When they try to do it the ghost attacks them each in different ways. The ground beneath Willow's feet sucks her in like quicksand. She screams out for Giles who comes and pulls her out and they roll down the stairs and come out hugging each other and share a really tender moment where Willow says through tears, ""Giles, I don't think this is Ms. Calendar. She wouldn't be this mean,"" and we see Giles agree and his denial slip away. It's a really sweet innocent moment that drove home to me how much these two love each other."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,3,Thu Jan 29 16:46:01 2015 UTC,I don't believe Giles would be on their side. I just don't. I hate how much they changed the dynamic of the relationship between Buffy and Giles.
buffy,2tx1x7,pagethree,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of it was that they kept writing him as possibly-evil for several episodes. The mislead (is he the First?!) was cute, but it resulted in a Giles who never hugged Buffy and told her things that may or may not be evil and certainly helped her to feel pressured and helpless. As a result, he seemed cold and distant and a jerk through practically the whole season.  It's a shame, really. I think they took it too far. The fight about Spike I absolutely buy, because this is the same Giles who preemptively killed Ben. But the rest is harder to swallow."
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,17,Thu Jan 29 05:36:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, let's see. There are a few things that have always irked me.   At the end of season 3, the Mayor and Faith want to distract Buffy by hurting Angel. Fair enough. Except the poison they use, which supposedly they primarily wanted to be ""wicked painful,"" also happens to be cured by a slayer's blood, and apparently this is news both to Faith and to the Mayor, who supplied it. I've always found this almost impossibly unbelievable. I can't believe that the Watchers' Council didn't just kill Faith when she was in a coma. They'd lost their slayer - their ""instrument"" - they have an entire team that does ""wetworks,"" and all they do is instruct some nurse to call them if and when she wakes up?  It would have made a lot of sense to have armies of Buffy-Bots fighting evil. Alternatively, why not just cause a lot of slayers to be technically dead for a second and then revived? The Council is awfully conservative and reactionary, but still. Kendra says derisively to Buffy, ""Did anyone explain to you what 'secret identity' means?"" Did anyone explain it to Kendra's ""people?"" Because apparently the calling is taken very seriously among them, so much so that she was given to her Watcher to be raised. This doesn't sound very secret to me. If evil things are drawn to the Hellmouth, and there's more than one Hellmouth, who protects the other ones? Clearly, if she'd gone to Cleveland, Buffy would have had plenty of things to fight, as witnessed by her badass scar in ""The Wish.""   I have a few more, but those are the main ones, I think. :)"
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,3,Wed Jan 28 07:15:35 2015 UTC,"Let me offer some explanations for this list of objections.  In the matter of the mayor not knowing all the properties of the vampire poison he uses, information about the supernatural often seems to be fragmentary or hard to get hold of.  It is contained in rare texts which are not available in most libraries (Sunnydale high school library excepted).  Faith still has an important role to play after her coma, in rescuing Angel (in the Angel series) and as part of the final battle of the Hellmouth, and given that there are a certain number of prophecies that come up now and then, I could speculate that the Watcher's Council knew that it would have been a mistake to kill Faith.  I will admit that the Watcher's Council is usually not that well informed, but there could be some occasion when they were.  While it could have been useful to have an army of Buffy-Bots, remember that it was Warren who built the Buffy-Bot and he was not exactly an ally (aside from being killed in season 6).  You may think that Warren should not have been the only person who was capable of building a particular machine, but I have always felt that actual existing technology is very far from being able to produce anything like that kind of fully autonomous, artificially intelligent robot, and it must have been Warren's particular abilities as amplified by the energies of the Hellmouth, which made it possible for him to build that kind of robot.    As for the other suggestion, of just killing the Slayer and reviving her repeatedly, in order to summon replacement slayers (as in the case of Kendra) I think that this would have been risky.  The system is really designed to have just one Slayer at a time, and if you abuse the system it might break.    It does seem that Kendra's family did know that she was going to be a Slayer.  Exactly why they were informed about something that is generally kept secret we do not now, but secrets do sometimes get out.  I could point out that by the time Buffy graduated from high school, she was given a special ""class protector"" award, so people pretty much knew what was going on (and furthermore, the whole class was aware that there would be a mass vampire attack during the graduation ceremony, and they were all prepared to defend themselves).  Then there is the question of who protects the Hellmouth in Cleveland.  Since the Cleveland Hellmouth was only mentioned at the very end of the series when there was absolutely no time left to develop that idea, we do not know what is going on in Cleveland.  Presumably, someone is there, keeping things under control.  Slayers and Watchers are not the only forces of good in the world.  In the Angel series we learn that there are mysterious ""Powers That Be"".  I would have to guess that someone was assigned to Cleveland, maybe even a Power."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,3,Wed Jan 28 14:29:21 2015 UTC,"These are all pretty good explanations that I can buy to varying degrees, though I do think it's worth noting that the Hellmouth in Cleveland is first mentioned in the Season 3 episode, The Wish. In the alternate universe, Buffy lives in Cleveland instead of Sunnydale. I thought I remembered it being specifically referenced as a Hellmouth because, when they reference it at the end of the series, the existence of the other Hellmouth registered with me as something I already knew specifically from The Wish but wikipedia and the Buffy wiki only specifically mention ""a lot of demonic activity"" in The Wish and I've only done one full watchthrough of the series, so maybe I'm remebering it wrong."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Jan 28 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"It's a good point.  I do not recall that Buffy had been said to be in Cleveland specifically to deal with Hellmouth related problems in the alternate universe of ""The Wish"" but it is certainly plausible that she was there for that reason.  And really, I do have to wonder what is going on in Cleveland, considering the kind of problems which arose in Sunnydale.  A Hellmouth seems to be an insanely dangerous phenomenon.  But the world hasn't ended, so we can presume that someone is looking after things."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,5,Wed Jan 28 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, I think the Sunnydale Hellmouth is so active because of Buffy. Clearly, the Hellmouth was already a thing before Buffy arrived, but it's not until Buffy arrives that it really seems to kick off.  Consider, before Buffy moved there, Xander and Willow and Cordelia had lived in Sunnydale their whole lives and none of them had any idea that there was anything supernatural going on in the town. It's not until Buffy arrives that they start coming into contact with evil creatures on a literal daily basis. Over the course of the series, there are a ton of almost-apocalypses with the Hellmouth at the heart of them. Presumably, if the Hellmouth had always been this active, these apocalypse attempts would have been way more successful without the Slayer around to throw a wrench in things.   The way I think of it is that the Hellmouth was already there, but that it was much more dormant before Buffy's arrival. When Buffy arrived, the Hellmouth sensed that there was this new super-force for good in the area and so it kicked up the evil in response (sort of like testosterone reacting to increased estrogen levels in the body or vice versa or perhaps like a haunted house movie where, the house is already haunted, but when psychics visit, the house cranks it up to 11)."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,4,Wed Jan 28 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting theory.  There are a few significant characters who were in Sunnydale long before Buffy arrived.  Mayor Wilkins was the mayor of Sunnydale for about a century.  And the Master was already there, trapped in the Hellmouth.  Presumably the obese demon Balthazar was there, in his pool (since he couldn't get around much).  Rather than imagining that it was Buffy herself who stimulated the Hellmouth into becoming active, I would rather imagine that the mayor was keeping a lid on things, as a mayor should, to preserve the city for his own purposes, so that he could eat everyone himself when the time came for his ascension.  Alternatively, there could have been another Slayer.  After all, there is a Slayer in every generation.  There must have been one before Buffy.  And maybe she lived in Sunnydale.    Anyway, it is very hard to know how much supernatural activity is going on in a given location.  Los Angeles does not have a Hellmouth, yet in the Angel series, we see just as much supernatural activity as in Sunnydale.  Wolfram & Hart are just as good as a Hellmouth, possibly better, as a stimulus for supernatural evil.  There is, in any event, a lot that we do not know about the history of the Buffyverse."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Very true, I hadn't considered the Mayor's long history in Sunnydale. As for The Master, as I mentioned before, I've only done one complete watch through of the series, and I've always felt a little confused about why The Master is trapped/where he is trapped/what makes him so special. After rewatching I Only Have Eyes For You last night, I'm realizing I need another watchthrough soon even if it hasn't even been six months since I finished lol. In fact I don't even remember Balthazar at all right now haha.   EDIT: I also wonder a lot about the Slayer immediately before Buffy. I'm hoping it comes up in one of the comics I haven't read yet."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Jan 28 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Balthazar the obese demon appears in season 3, episode 14 entitled ""Bad Girls"".  The reason the Master is trapped in the Hellmouth is that he came to Sunnydale specifically to open the Hellmouth so that it would release all the evils of Hell into the world (being a particularly malicious vampire who hates the human race) but it isn't easy to open the Hellmouth and he didn't do it correctly, and therefore got stuck inside it.  Although that does raise another question as well.  We know that there are a whole series of prophecies about the Master in the Hellmouth, prophecy about the Harvest, and about the death of the Slayer.  Since this was all predicted, it would have made sense for the Master to simply avoid going to the Hellmouth in the first place so that he didn't get trapped in it.  But then, perhaps the Master did not hear about the prophecies until he was already trapped.  The Master seems to be special just because he is a particularly old, powerful vampire.  He is also part of an interesting genealogical line.  The Master has sired Darla, Darla has sired Angel, Angel has sired Drusilla, and Drusilla has sired Spike.  They are all connected."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:14:17 2015 UTC,I definitely need to rewatch Season 1 cause I knew it was maligned compared to the other seasons so I half-watched it while replaying Super Mario Galaxy 2 and only started really fully watching around when Angel turns into Angelus. Pretty much my entire understanding of the master is from Angel/Darla flashbacks in Angel the Show.
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Jan 28 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"There is no question that season 1 is the weakest season, however, it is also quite brilliant in certain episodes, and it does create the basis for the series, all 7 seasons.  There are at least some parts of season 1 which I enjoy as much as anything in the entire series.  And everything that happens will have consequences later on.  Some things have greater consequences than others.  We never see a giant praying mantis again, however Xander's tendency to become involved with catastrophically wrong women does continue, all the way to the end."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:41:23 2015 UTC,Very likely the Light-skinned Afro-Hispanic Woman who sired Harmony is in that family also.
buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jan 29 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the Hellmouth in Sunnydale was just beginning to pick up activity, which is why Buffy was sent there.  Or Xander/Willow/Cordelia all had experienced supernatural forces before, but blocked them from their memories (like most people in the town seem to do to some extent).   We also know that outside forces are aware of the presence of the hellmouth. It is possible other groups worked to prevent demonic activity. In fact, we don't even know how long some form of the Initiative was active in Sunnydale. It's possible they had been there for many years, but Buffy only began to notice them once spending time around the UC Sunnydale campus.   Big range of possible explanations."
buffy,2tx1x7,pagethree,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"Some very interesting points.   In regards to how long the initiative has been in Sunnydale, I don't think we have proof one way or the other but we do have some possible clues. The giant secret base under the campus seems to imply they have been there as long as UC Sunnydale has, but a possible explanation is that things get destroyed and built/rebuilt all the time in Sunnydale (eg Sunnydale High, Buffy's House, The Magic Box) so maybe that part of the campus is new. Also, hinting at their previous existence is the initiative-like group during World War II in the Angel episode Why We Fight, though this does not specifically imply that they were in Sunnydale back then. Hinting that the initiative is new in Sunnydale is the fact that the Scoobies spend three years in Sunnydale and never run into them but in Season 4 they have constant run-ins. It's possible this is because they are now at UC Sunnydale where the initiative is headquartered, but since the paranormal activity is rampant all over town, presumably they would have seen them before. Also supporting the idea that it is new to Sunnydale is the fact that Riley is the ranking officer. Riley has only been in Sunnydale for a couple years maximum and yet he is the hoghest ranking soldier in the Initiative. The only good explanations I see for this are that either literally every other ranking officer died, or else Riley was a first recruit to the new Sunnydale Initiative. Finally, the fact that they shut down the Initiative completely at the end of the Season and cite it as a failure makes me think that it is fairly new, otherwise I don't think they would shut it down completely and they would cite the years of success as a reason why they need to stick to the old model pre-Maggie Walsh rather than shut it down completely.   Again, AFAIK, there's no proof one way or the other but I personally think the Initiative is new to Sunnydale.   As for Sunnydale residents blocking out Supernatural stuff, I'm certain all three of them had, but I personally think that if the Hellmouth had always been that active, that would have been very hard to do than if it ha been a couple experiences over the course of their whole lives but that's just my personal opinion.   Maybe some of the comics that I haven't read yet cover some of this ground. I hope so!   EDIT: wrote this on my phone, please ignore typos. The crazy confusing sentence at the end is meant to express that it would have been hard to block out constant activity but easy to block out a few instances over the course of 16 years."

buffy,2tx1x7,autowikiabot,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about the poison and the Mayor that really bothers me is that I find it so easy to believe that he did know about it. After listening to the writers talk so much about the ""loving father-daughter relationship"" he has with Faith, I reluctantly have to admit that apparently he didn't mean to put her in harm's way. But when I first saw it, I thought he never really cared much for her and that he was just using her and playing on her vulnerability and need for ""a dad."" What kind of future would she really have in his demonic new world, anyway? I always thought he knew about the poison's cure and used it as a way to make Buffy crazy and possibly even kill her. If Faith happened to die, well, I thought he'd be OK with that. Apparently it was a coincidence though. :( About Faith, I agree, maybe there was some sort of prophecy. But I still find it a little odd that the Council would have allowed themselves to be without an active slayer under their control for so long. What were they doing, besides watching ""Masterpiece Theatre?"" Plus - although he might not have had the authority, I suppose - when ""Faith"" gives the special Watcher forces grief in ""Who Are You?"" at least one of the Council's men is willing to kill her right then. I do agree that they probably wouldn't have gone around killing and bringing slayers back to life, though. Seems too risky. Warren isn't the only advanced robot-maker; crazy Ted from season 2 was as well. And the high-schoolers in ""Some Assembly Required"" manage to animate dead bodies. Willow is shown to be both interested in the mechanics of these robots (with both the Buffy-Bot and with Ted) and able to fix the Buffy-Bot pretty well. I don't know if she'd actually be able to make one, but surely the Initiative could have. It seems awfully convenient, anyway, that the Buffy-Bot is capable of fooling vampires for months after Buffy's death (despite having its head kicked off in ""The Gift"") and then is destroyed for good just when Buffy comes back to life. I mean, I do buy it, but it's definitely a convenient plot contrivance."

I don't think that person was available to the Scooby gang.  Maybe Willow could have built a robot, since she did have the ability to repair them.  Although to make an analogy, someone who can repair a car is not necessarily prepared to build one.  If the Initiative had focused on robots instead of the really bad idea of creating a Frankenstein type monster, they might well have been able to do that (especially if they were able to recruit Warren or Willow as consultants) but it would have huge implications.  This is a government project, it would inevitably lead to a whole army of robots replacing the existing armed forces, and logically, replacing human labor in general.  There is no reason not to have a robot factory in which robots build more robots, so the quantity of robots you make is effectively unlimited.  This is more than just a good way to fight vampires, it literally changes everything.  It would not be impossible to write scripts on that basis, but it would profoundly change the nature of the whole series, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Robot World.  It would make Buffy irrelevant.  I don't think that such a radical change of direction would have been a good idea."

buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,8,Thu Jan 29 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"OK, this is an interesting topic.  I would like to comment first that I also was deeply incredulous that Buffy would ever have been in the position of having to get a job in the fast food industry when clearly the Watcher's Council should have put her on a salary, for doing the most important job in the world.  That was ridiculous.  The idea that Buffy's dad simply abandoned the family is not as implausible as you suggest, since this does happen to a great many families.  Marriages often fail, and husbands often leave.    I do like the explanation given by GinaZaneburritos for the general lack of guns being used by vampires.  They prefer to use their teeth.  Other than that I have a few of my own.  One that really annoyed me was that Glory had ceremonial clothing for Dawn to wear when she was ritually bled to open the dimensional gateway, yet for most of the season Glory did not even know that the Key was in the form of a person.  The fact that there was a particular ceremonial garb for the Key to wear, should have been a clue.  In season 7, when Spike is kidnapped by the First, he is at one point being tortured by having his head held underwater so he couldn't breathe.  But we have already established that he doesn't breathe.  To drive home the point, in the Angel series we see that Angel is held underwater for months, and doesn't drown.  Why would a few minutes underwater matter to Spike?  And this is something that the First Evil would have had to know.  For that matter, as a vampire who does not breathe, Spike also should not smoke cigarettes.  If you can't breathe, you can't inhale smoke.  We see that when Buffy is dead and buried, and then brought back to life, it is really difficult for her to fight her way out of the coffin and back to the surface.  However, vampires are routinely buried in coffins after they are first transformed into vampires, and yet they then seem to just sprout out of the ground like tulips in April.  Surely they too would have a hard time, as Buffy did, unless they were specially buried with no coffin in a shallow grave, which does not seem to be the usual practice (after all, the people who are burying them have no idea that these dead people are going to rise again and even if they did know that they were burying vampires-to-be, they would generally not want to assist in that process).  In the very early episode ""Teacher's Pet"" when a giant praying mantis wishes to mate with Xander, surely a female giant praying mantis would rather mate with a male giant praying mantis and would experience greater fertility if she did.  Biologically it makes no sense.  Just because she is able to disguise herself as a human does not make her a human or endow her with the ability to interbreed with humans, I would think (admittedly things do get weird on the Hellmouth)."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,4,Wed Jan 28 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"I only have two (semi) rebuttals.  Smoking: Vampires can breathe - they can perform the action of taking in air and letting it out. So Spike can smoke for sure, and just as he's still affected by alcohol there's no reason to think he isn't affected by tobacco/nicotine. They don't need to breathe so the drowning complaint is valid (and irked me a bit as well).  Coffin-bustin': The only rebuttal for this is that we don't ever see how vampires get out. In the first episode Spike comments on Buffy's bleeding fingers, saying he's gone through the same thing. It's fair to assume that it isn't easy for all vamps to get out, but at the same time they're probably less terrified and traumatised due to the big stonking demon in their head that's screaming for them to get out and feed."
buffy,2tx1x7,wbright92,5,Wed Jan 28 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"I think, regardless of whether or not you need oxygen, that being forced to inhale that much water would surely be painful."
buffy,2tx1x7,glueandtar,2,Wed Jan 28 18:30:56 2015 UTC,Yeah good point. Vampires are immortal but not immune to suffering.
buffy,2tx1x7,wbright92,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"But why would he be forced to inhale? All the Turok-Han does is push his head underwater. I see no reason why this would be torturous; except for maybe some claustrophobic reason, it should be just as painful as someone forcing your hand underwater.  I agree with /u/excultist that this is mildly irritating."
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:50:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'd have to rewatch the scene, but if his mouth were open when his head was pushed under, or if he were to gasp in fear, then the water would be in his lungs, which would be painful regardless.   I do see what you're saying, though, if he acts like a drowning human. That would be irritating, as I'm also one who likes continuity."
buffy,2tx1x7,glueandtar,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Angel does say in Season 1 that he can't give Buffy CPR because he can't breathe, but the show hadn't come into it's own by that point and the mythology wasn't fully planned out. Continuity issues from very early in TV shows are fairly common and I think people harp on this one a little too much."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"You may recall the season finale of the first season, ""Prophecy Girl"" in which Buffy dies, and Angel and Xander find her in the Master's lair, after the Master has finally escaped.  Angel cannot perform CPR because, he explains, he has no breath.  So Xander performs CPR and revives Buffy.  That would seem to mean that vampires do not have the opportunity of breathing when they choose to do so (alternatively, maybe they can breathe when they choose to do so, but the breath of a vampire cannot restore life, due to the nature of vampirism).  Of course the point is valid that vampires are able to speak, and speaking requires breathing.  I have tended to imagine that perhaps vampire speech is not the usual variety, maybe their vocal chords can vibrate on their own.  Smoking cigarettes is another matter, I don't see how that could be done without breathing.  Anyway, it is at least an ambiguous aspect of the way vampires are depicted in the series.  If vampires can breathe, why does Angel claim that he can't?  I also have some trouble with the idea that it isn't easy for all vampires to arise from their graves, because we see it all the time, Buffy is in a graveyard and a hand comes up through the soil, and there it is, a newly arisen vampire with no sign of any trauma resulting from fighting out of a coffin six feet underground, they all seem fresh as daisies, with barely any soil clinging to their clothing.  I think this is something that was just not carefully considered, when the Buffyverse was devised."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,3,Wed Jan 28 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"One possible explanation for breaking out of the coffins:  When Vampires break out, it is a newly born vampire with fresh strength and vitality in a body that has just deceased with evil and violence being the primary goal whereas world-weary Buffy is ripped out of Heaven and forced into a body that has been decaying for months and comes to confused about her very existence.   This is just what came to mind off the top of my head. Definitely not a bulletproof argument lol"
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Jan 28 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Not a bulletproof argument, but nonetheless, it is the best one I have heard for this seeming anomaly.  I am going to provisionally accept it for my personal concept of what is going on in the Buffyverse."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,2,Wed Jan 28 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"My only explanation for Angel (beside s not knowing how) is that in a magickal universe, a dead thing can't directly restore life."
buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a reasonable interpretation - but what Angel actually says is, ""I have no breath"".  He may have been speaking metaphorically, though.  He has no breath of the kind that can restore life."

buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,2,Fri Jan 30 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"We might assume that it has deeper meaning, but then, maybe it was just a failure of continuity.  Perhaps the writers did not realize that although vampires do not need to breathe to live, as humans do, they also do have to be able to breathe in order to talk, or to smoke cigarettes as Spike does, so it does not seem likely that Angel actually has no breath.  It doesn't really add up, although as I said in my previous comment, we could certainly imagine that even if vampires can breathe, they can't do CPR because they are mystically connected to death rather than life.  Although if that were the case, then ideally that should be brought out in the series rather than being left to our imagination.  In the end, there is a certain amount of error which we should be prepared to tolerate, since this was, after all, a weekly TV series, and they did not have time to ponder every detail to get it exactly right.  Everything considered, they did amazingly well under the constraints of time and money that they faced."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'll try and address the other replies in this one...  1 - [DISCLAIMER - I HAVE NO IDEA HOW CPR WORKS AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC HUMAN BIOLOGY IS PROBABLY PRETTY FAULTY] Breathing! Assuming that the entire work of Buffy is all canon within the universe and its lore (big assumption), I offer this defence of Angel not being able to save Buffy, while Spike is able to smoke. Please refer to both my disclaimer and the heavy amounts of bullshit I spew on a near constant basis before judging me too harshly.  It is entirely possible, nay, plausible, that while vampires have pretty full motor function, there are certain biological functions that they cannot perform. Heart beating, probably normal digestion, that sort of thing. We see them drink alcohol and blood, so we can assume they have some sort of functioning digestive system, but it could be very different to ours. One of these non-functioning functions would likely be the conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide that occurs when we breath.  Now, bear in mind that I do not know how or why breathing into someone's mouth during CPR works but I think it's a fair assumption to say that if Angel isn't processing air in the way a living human would, the effect would not be the same.  However, the basic muscles used to inhale and exhale should still work, so there's no reason why Spike can't smoke (and be affected by the drugs he's inhaling). It would also explain how they can speak - they're still taking in air and getting rid of it but they're just not converting it the way humans are meant to.  2 - If we were watching Buffy rise from the same perspective as we see most vampires, we'd see the same thing, right? Just a hand coming up through the soil. The difference is that there's a traumatised girl coming out, not a demon that is more aware of what's happening and has a primal need to feed. The clothing thing is hard to argue away in-universe, as that's pretty clearly just not great attention to detail.  BUT since I'm doing so well (/s) at making up shit, let's assume that every Sire plants a lint roller in their babies' graves, so they can look all spic and span when they get out."
buffy,2tx1x7,wbright92,1 point,Thu Jan 29 11:47:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going with the theory that vampires actually are capable of breathing, but don't have to, and that they fail at CPR for supernatural reasons.  A lack of carbon dioxide in the exhaled breath would be an advantage, rather than a disadvantage, in terms of CPR.  But vampires are creatures of death, so their exhalations are not life-giving. For vampies rising from the grave without evidence of any great struggle to escape from their coffin, I am going with the hypothesis that this is a benefit of the demonic power of vampirism, that they have an initial burst of coffin-smashing power.  (However even then I could quibble if I wanted to - Buffy sometimes encounters vampires who were not buried, they are still in the morgue or wherever, and there is no indication that their power upon wakening is any different than usual.  But maybe you need the coffin to trigger the coffin-escape supercharge.)"
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"I think we're getting to the issue of OP's question - there are a lot of elements of the universe that just haven't been worked out to the minutest detail, but that doesn't detract from the show's quality.

buffy,2tx1x7,wbright92,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"If you compare the vampire siring strategy in BVS to ""True Blood"" we see that in that latter, the new vampire-to-be is buried in a shallow grave with only a thin layer of dirt, and no coffin, so it is easy to arise as a vampire.  They thought it out.  In BVS the siring process could be described as bit-and-run.  The sire just abandons the new vampire to be buried by his or her grieving relatives who do not even know that something much worse than death has befallen their loved one.  But yes, a thoughtful sire would arrange for a double espresso and a line of coke to help wake up the new vampire.  Or, who knows, a liter of blood.

Except the show made it abundantly clear from the beginning that (a) the Council didn't really see Slayers as people at all and (b) Buffy was very much not the typical Slayer.  It makes sense that the Council pays the Watcher.  To them, he's the important one.  He's a core member of their secret society, he's had all the education, initiation and training.  The Slayer is basically a thing.  A weapon to be wielded by the Watcher.  And it typically brainwashed from childhood to be good little instruments and do what they're told (Kendra).  Remember the Slayer is also disposable.  They weren't expected to live long enough to reach young adulthood and need a paycheck."
buffy,2tx1x7,bookant,2,Wed Jan 28 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"It's really not logical.  If the Slayer is busy earning a living so that she can pay her rent and feed herself and her sister, then she will necessarily not have very much time left over for slaying.  Even if the Slayer is just a tool, you have to take care of your tools, and keep them properly sharpened.  Are you being attacked by a vampire?  Well I get off work in another 4 hours, so try to hang on until then.  Very good."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with this guy. The Watcher's Council are apparently huge, powerful and very wealthy.

Having your slayer exhausted and time-poor is not conducive to good world-saving practice.   Let's be honest. The Watcher's Council swooping in and solving all of Buffy's financial problems would have been way too easy."
buffy,2tx1x7,excultist,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:10:24 2015 UTC,"It is true that Joss Whedon never makes things easy for Buffy.  An alternative could have been that when Riley found Buffy in the Double-meat Palace, he could have offered her a job with the Initiative.  That organization never ended even though the Sunnydale operation came to its catastrophic end when Adam made his move.  That would also have been logical.  Although if Buffy wound up fighting demons in South America, she would not have been available to fight the final battle of the Hellmouth.  But nobody really saw that coming, in season 6.    Anyway, the forces of good are sometimes ridiculously disorganized, but then, so are the forces of evil, who often wind up defeating themselves.  So I guess it balances out, somehow."

I'll see if I can find it so I can quote it exactly - it's pretty funny. Plus, elsewhere Jane Espenson remarks that, gee, it would have been so easy for Glory to just use the crazy people she's creating all the time as perfect Key-finders. The season is just not very well-plotted. I still like it - for the emotion and the characters and the themes and everything else that makes Buffy great - but I've given up on trying to force it to make a whole lot of sense.

I mean, it's possible that they had jobs, but it never talked about either of them working. So did they just take money from Joyce's life insurance? Buffy's savings? If Buffy was so far into debt that she had to get a low paying food service job to support everyone then one of those seems pretty likely. Also, you never see Tara nor Willow working  either.   I'm not sure if that counts as a plot contrivance but it did piss me off a little that they somehow put everyone into debt less in less than a year. What kind of friends are you?!"

Surely they could've helped out more.  As far as the debt, I don't think it's completely inconceivable that they would get that far into the red since on top of living expenses they did have to pay the hospital and funeral bills, too.

I wish it were possible for a high-schooler to teach the class, because I would have loved to do that, but it's not realistic.

While it's perfectly plausible that Giles could have a girlfriend after Jenny, why give him one if she's not going to be a real character?"
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sat Jan 31 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"Some responses to your points (which are valid nitpicks):   I also thought the plot line of Buffy's dad seemed to come out of nowhere, but a fan explanation made it more acceptable. I read someone's theory (probably on this subreddit) that the magic used to create memories of ""Dawn"" somehow went awry with Mr. Summers. He never lived in Sunnydale, spent only minimal time with any of the characters that lived there, etc. It is possible that some small part of his mind knew that Dawn was not real (Considering that Joyce is able to come to this conclusion partially on her own, it is possible). If that is the case, Mr. Summers behavior makes somewhat more sense. It always bothered me that he never showed up for Joyce's funeral. While this is not a canon explanation, I think it is within the realm of possibility. Buffy having to work at the Doublemeat Palace was ridiculous. Only plausible explanation to me is that Buffy was too proud to ask them for money or create any further ties between them. The Watchers on the council are mostly dicks so it makes sense as to why they would not have offered to pay her on their own accord. Disappearance of modern weaponry: perhaps demons have heard through the grapevine that something stops the slayer from being killed by guns. It also seems as though few demons have interest or access to guns. Vampires are often shown as underestimating the power of the slayer, so perhaps their overconfidence causes them not to use weapons."

buffy,2tx1x7,AngelAmongUs,4,Thu Jan 29 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"Both the Slayer Scythe and the Amulet. It's not that I don't buy that either of these things could exist, it's just the sudden and random way they find their way into Buffy's life, exactly when she needs them to take down the First.  Also, I have a couple issues with The Gift and Ben.   They just happen to meet Glory's human form. Out of all the nurses at all the hospitals in Sunnydale, they just happen to become friendly with the one who shares a body with a Hell Dimension Goddess hell bent on using Buffy's sister to destroy the world.  I don't buy that Buffy wouldn't kill Ben. Ben was a part of Glory and Glory needed to be stopped, no matter what, even if he is an innocent. And on that note, he isn't an innocent. He was tempted by Glory and eventually came to do evil to Dawn. I don't buy that Buffy would just let Glory live because she shares a body with a human. She was eventually willing to kill Anya, and Anya wasn't nearly as big of a threat to anyone as Glory was (granted, that is two seasons later, but still). Why did Buffy's blood close the gate? Dawn was made using a part of Buffy and therefore Dawn has Buffy's blood in her but Buffy does not therefore have Dawn's blood in her. Dawn is the magical key + a little bit of Buffy but Dawn is the magical one in this instance and Buffy does not have that magic in her. It seems like they were going for the same thing as Harry and Voldemort with Harry being a horcrux for Voldemort and Voldemort being a sort of good anti-horcrux for Harry, except in this case, it wasn't a two-way exchange, it was just that Dawn had some of Buffy inside of her. I don't understand how Buffy's blood would have done anything. This one kinda breaks my all-squares-are-rectangles-but-not-all-rectangles-are-squares logic function.    Don't get me wrong, I like The Gift and I like Chosen, I just think they both could have wrapped up a little nicer. Too much deus ex machina.  EDIT: The Gift*, not The Body"
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,2,Wed Jan 28 18:09:48 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, The Scythe was established in Fray all the way back during season 5."
buffy,2tx1x7,CloudGirl,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:48:06 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting. I own The Fray but haven't read it yet. I didn't realize it came out way back then. Still, I didn't really like that the Amulet came from canon outside the show Buffy and I still feel that way about the Scythe. Buffy was primarily a television show and so I don't think the final conflict should be resolved from secondary sources that they can't really have expected the whole audience to have read."
buffy,2tx1x7,Buffymaster,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"I've wanked it- Dawn is actually a clone, so the Portola couldn't tell the difference between her heartbeat and Buffy's. But we shouldn't have to do t hat."
buffy,2tx1x7,AngryWizard,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"I think the common problem here is that both seasons 5 and 7 introduce the Big Bad very early, in the first few episodes (season 1 does too, but it has fewer episodes, plus I'm pretty willing to let first-season issues slide). When there's no mystery or evolving bad-guy plot lines, there's the problem of: what can they do in the last episode that's different from what they've been trying this whole time?  Season 5's plot is essentially a long story of Glory very gradually narrowing down where the Key is while Buffy tries to figure out how to fight her and protect Dawn. I feel like at the end, they had to somehow make up an ending that kept all the elements and sort of make sense, and so there's a lot of ""well, that came out of nowhere.""  A similar thing can be said for season 7. Seasons 2, 3, 4, and 6 seem to have evolved a little more organically (maybe not in the case of 4 though, I'm not sure), with Big Bads emerging fairly late in the game. I think that makes the plot contrivances that end those seasons somewhat more believable."
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm I hadn't considered that those two seasons have that in common. I would also point out that Mayor Wilkins is introduced and made to be the clear big bad pretty early in Season 3 but I would agree that it still feels like it evolves a bit more organically than Seasons 5 and 7.  It's interesting that you point this out though because I would think that the Seasons that utilize the whole length of the Season on the big bad plot would be the seasons where things would proceed organically and where things like the Scythe or the Amulet or Buffy taking Dawn's place could have the room to get introduced in a reasonable time, and yet they're the two seasons where I feel like they deus ex machina'd the conflict."
buffy,2tx1x7,AngryWizard,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:30:05 2015 UTC,I don't buy that Buffy wouldn't kill Ben.   Buffy was willing to stab Faith to save Angel and kill human knights trying to stop the world from ending by destroying the key.  But came unraveled when she thought she accidentally killed Katrina and came down hard on Faith for accidentally killing the mayor's aide at a time when what she needed was support.   So maybe if Giles mentioned that Ben was a threat to Angel...        Why did Buffy's blood close the gate?   If Buffy could close the portal then she should be able to open it. If this is true then Dawn's existence has no purpose. Buffy throwing herself off the tower was a leap in logic on her part.
buffy,2tx1x7,heymeowmeow,2,Thu Jan 29 10:20:00 2015 UTC,"Very good points about the knights and Faith. I hadn't even considered those instances even though they're much more comparable than the Anya one. I don't even mind that Giles was the one to kill them. I'm fine with other people getting the spotlight every once in a while like Xander in Season 6. It's just the fact that Buffy was just willing to let Glory go simply to save the life of one human who wasn't even really an ""innocent"" anymore. That just struck me as being unbelievable."
buffy,2tx1x7,AngryWizard,2,Thu Jan 29 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"SO. MANY.   Making Willow ""turn"" gay. I know, it was foreshadowed and stuff. Still seemed super forced. Why not just make her bi? That would have at least made some sense, considering she apparently had the hots for Oz. Cordelia's family money issues. It was just fabricated to get her away from college and out of Sunnydale. In fact, this deal of knocking down characters' financial or ""potential"" status out of the blue happened in other shows, too. Roseanne did it to Becky and Darlene. Becky was super smart and headed for a bright future. Somehow she decides to elope with her boyfriend at 16 and live in a trailer park. Darlene was super artistically talented and headed for a bright future. Somehow she decides to marry her boyfriend at...19? and drop her future entirely. Anywho. All her family's possessions wouldn't have been seized, nor would their money have been, and especially not their house! I just found it very contrived that none of the Scoobies had siblings and in fact, very few kids in Sunnydale seemed to have siblings.  Willow staying in Sunnydale for college. Another contrived waste of a brilliant mind on a mediocre education. I know I know, she said she wanted to be there to fight evil and that she was excited about designing her own curriculum. I still don't buy it. Oz's leaving. I haven't gotten to that episode yet in my rewatch but I seem to recall it made no sense. It was basically just to get Oz out of the picture so they could get Willow all gayed up. Giles deserting Buffy every chance he gets. I hated that. Okay, in the first ep of s04, when he does it the first time, he regrets it at the end of the episode. But he just keeps on trying to desert her until he gets it right in season...6? God, that was an asshole move. I just can't believe he would want to force a 20 year old who'd just come back from the dead to be ""more adult"" and completely take away any sort of mentoring role from her. Ugh. Hate that plot contrivance. It was just more of the ""let's see how shitty we can make Buffy's life"" from the writers. So cheap. Maybe they were trying to do Joss' ""make characters unhappy"" rule but this went so far it was just fourth wall-breaking and ridiculous. The Maestro became the The Master. Pfft. How contrived. :D The Watcher's Council puts tons of effort in training slayers, not to mention Watchers, but then tries to kill the slayer on her 18th birthday. And judging by what happened on Buffy's 18th, they very often succeed at it. Seems either like they're incredibly incompetent (which actually could be the case) or like the show wanted to give Buffy yet another hardship and made up this horror house thing without realizing how terribly it reflected on the WC."

It was basically just to get Oz out of the picture so they could get Willow all gayed up.   I don't believe that's why Oz was removed.  Seth Green commented[1] that he felt he was just being shoehorned into scenes and with ""other opportunities"" coming up (Austin Powers, etc) he didn't want to stick waste time on a minor role (my wording, not his).  The whole Veruca/Oz thing was originally[2] supposed to last for a larger number of episodes but Seth's choice to suddenly depart the show meant that a long story-line for Oz's departure became somewhat more abrupt.

buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,6,Thu Jan 29 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"Making Willow ""turn"" gay     I've said this here before, but Willow's journey to gayness mirrors mine pretty damn well, sans vampires and magic. I was in relationships with guys (longest was 2 years) pretty steadily until I was 20. Then the summer after sophomore year of college I kissed a girl for the first time, head exploded, planets aligned, and 'holy shit I'm gay'. I never would have thought about calling myself bi at the time as I exclusively dated women from then on and I was sheltered, there was no tumblr or reddit, no gay or bi people on tv. I definitely feel like when it was filmed has to be taken into consideration, it was a very different time. Buffy and Will & Grace were the first time I saw someone gay (and ok) on tv, so the fact that there weren't any bisexual characters on tv yet either is kinda just how it was back in those dark ages. So yeah, maybe me (and Willow) being gay doesn't ""make sense"", but it's definitely not the first time even in real life that someone has met a girl at 20 and been like 'holy shit, gay now'.   No siblings   I'm an only child too so them not having siblings never dawned on me (hehe) until now.   Oz's leaving..to get Oz out of the picture so they could get Willow all gayed up.   Seth Green was leaving the show to take on other acting roles. There was honestly nothing they could do about his character after Seth announced he was leaving other than try to write him out with some closure I suppose.    Giles deserting Buffy   On the one hand, I agree and I hated it. On the other hand, I really do think he was 100% convinced that he was doing the right thing and doing it for Buffy (as shown in his omwf songs). Again, pertaining to the writers solely trying to make Buffy's life shitty, this also goes back to the actor; ASH moved back to England to be with his family after season 5, so the writers had to set up his absence somehow. I'm glad they didn't kill him off, even though I wanted to kick Giles' ass myself in season 7.   The Watcher's Council...tries to kill the slayer on her 18th birthday   This is my personal theory of which I have no evidence. The WC does not like to keep slayers around for too long. As they get wiser, more capable and more confident, they also get more defiant and question the council. I know it's morbid, but from everything i've learned of the watcher's council, I really think they prefer malleable 15 year olds to strong wise 20 year olds, as they are much easier to manipulate. They really don't care if the slayer dies, and in some cases I feel they would prefer it. The Slayer isn't a person to them, just a weapon to be used and recycled. A wiser Buffy tells them she doesn't need them, they need her, and I'm sure this isn't the first time a slayer has come to that conclusion."
buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jan 29 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"I've said this here before, but Willow's journey to gayness mirrors mine pretty damn well   I have two points to make the first of which I will tread lightly with.   I am also gay and active in the LGBT community and by no means speak for the gay community, and I truly and honestly don't mean any offense here at all, but in all of the discussions I've had with people about their experiences with coming to terms with their sexuality, I've only very rarely heard of this sort of experience where it is a sudden epiphany of sorts as an adult. It seems like the majority of queer people I've discussed this with had a good idea for a very long time that they were to gay. This is not to say that you are wrong or deny your experience or anything, I just think that that sort of situation is the exception and not the rule. I really hope this isn't coming off man-splain-ey or anything like that. I'm just trying to compare experiences.  My second point is much more general and comes from a creative writing class I took in college. The teacher shared an interesting anecdote about reading a student's story and telling them that they couldn't believe the actions of one of the characters. The student responded by saying that the story was based on reality and that they had actually done those things. The point of the matter was that it doesn't really matter if something did in fact happen in reality if the audience is unable to believe that it would happen. And personally, I did not find Willow's sudden transition from totally into guys to totally into girls to be believable."
buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jan 29 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"It seems like the majority of queer people I've discussed this with had a good idea for a very long time that they were to gay.   Could be that I just didn't have any idea what 'being gay' even meant. I never met a gay person until I was a sophomore in college. Never saw a gay person on tv that wasn't like Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde) from Bewitched, a flamboyant character for audiences to laugh at. I thought everyone had crushes on their same sex best friends, but deep down I kinda knew it was 'wrong' so I never ever revealed those feelings. I dunno, I guess I feel like a bit of a freak now after reading your comment, but I really just think I was so naive, had zero role models, and wanted to fit in. I probably should have stayed out of the conversation since the 90's in the bible belt was such a different time than the lens most younger people are looking back on the Buffy late 90's early 00's through. Maybe i'd call myself bi if it happened now, but I'd never date a man again so I think gay has been working for me.   Regardless of whether or not my or Willow's experience is weird, valid or believable, it meant so much to me to see a normal relationship on tv between two women; like I can't even explain how incredibly awesome it was to see this on tv for the first time, so bunch of bullshit or not, I am insanely grateful to have finally experienced what it feels like to see a relationship like mine not being ignored or treated as a side-show attraction. It was so damn cool."

Everyone's experience is different and everyone's experience is valid!   the 90's in the bible belt was such a different time    This could actually account for a lot of the differences in our experiences. I generally assume when on reddit that I'm talking to someone born between 1985 and 2000 because that seems to be the big demographic on here. I personally am from near San Francisco and the majority of my interactions have been there or in college in Utah where most people were from the Western half of the United States. Now knowing that this was a decade before my own peer group's coming out period and in the bible belt, it's more like I should have stayed out of the conversation.   Regardless of whether or not my or Willow's experience is weird, valid or believable, it meant so much to me to see a normal relationship on tv between two women   I know this feeling so much but from other shows from my own coming out period so I'm really glad you had someone who matched your experience.

buffy,2tx1x7,DaddyCatALSO,2,Thu Jan 29 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks man/dude/lady. I'm still amazed at the progress since I was in high school. An ex-gf who was just 5 years younger than me told me she went to her senior HS prom with a girl and my mind was BLOWN! This is Tennessee we're talking about here. I mean I'd moved to a big college town at this point so it was going to be ahead of the conservative little bastion I came from, but still, a lot of people's attitudes really did start progressing awfully quickly in my mid to late 20's, and gay people started to be less invisible."
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,4,Thu Jan 29 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"Why not just make her bi?   I agree with this completely. It would have made much more sense for her to come to terms with her bisexuality. Though I can see how that might have been harder to do. Even with much greater acceptance of queer peoples these days, there are still tons of issues with bisexual representation in the media. Media outlets like to paint the idea that women who are bisexual are just sluts and men who are bisexual are just gay and too afraid to own up to it. I can see why it would be easier to push a full-on gay character through production. Also, it removes any temptation of Willow dating Tara and then going back to men in a, ""I was lonely but now I miss cock way."" Having her come out as a lesbian is a more official, ""She's here, she's queer and that's never changing,"" type statement.    Cordelia's family money issues.   Also, agreed. That felt like an incredibly lazy trope just to give something Cordelia to do. And I say that as a fan who has absolutely adored Cordelia from the beginning, even before she became a more likable character on Angel.    The Maestro became the The Master.   You just blew my fucking mind. I've looked at Mark Metcalfe's picture out of makeup before and always wondered why he looks so familiar. Classic Bob Cobb!"
buffy,2tx1x7,GinaZaneburritos,3,Thu Jan 29 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"I agree absolutely about Willow.

And the suppose d clues ahea d of time to Willow's sexuality I regard as so much waffle.

buffy,2tx1x7,TheDemonHauntedWorld,6,Fri Jan 30 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"Of course that's a big ""meta"" reason why vampires don't use guns. Also, fights are fun to watch, which is why newly-risen vampires suddenly have crazy martial arts fighting moves (as Dawn points out in season 7).  But I think without too much difficulty you can come up with an in-world explanation as well. The big difference between vampires and slayers, as Spike says in ""Fool for Love,"" is that ""a slayer must always reach for her weapon ... I've already got mine."" They're made to kill up close and personal, and a gun is pretty much the opposite of that.  I think most vampires just want to feed on humans and live their quietly evil lives, rather than target someone like an assassin. Even killing a slayer won't make much difference, as another one will just be called. Most vampires also seem to be much more about following their instincts - ""always thinking with their teeth"" - than about thoughtfully plotting tactical human destruction.  Of course, this demon preference for martial arts, swords, and teeth works out well for humans. Hence Mr. Trick's line: ""It's called an Uzi, ya chump! Would've saved your ass right about now."""

Angel was topless several times prior to this.  When I searched for the episode, the only complaint I saw was one TV station complaining about the amount of sex.

I just think it's a stupid thing to introduce, considering they could've all just done the exact same thing the next season to fight Glory. If I recall correctly, they do offer some kind of crappy explanation for why they can't do this regularly. But I don't know, that kind of bugs me.  Also in the earlier seasons, Buffy always seems to have these dreams with premonitions, that she seemed to hold a lot of confidence in, (e.g when she attacks Ms Calendar in the middle of teaching a class) and they were really few and far between in the  later seasons. Whenever they did pop up they were always really cryptic, like when Buffy has the dream about Dawns' arrival, with Faith and her making the bed.  Another thing is Anya, and her characters continuity, when she first comes to Sunnydale, in comparison to later on in the series, to me she just seems like a completely different person. Which I understand to an extent, but I just think they do a terrible job of making viewers believe she has been alive for centuries. I don't really get why when she gets her powers back in season 7 she is able to go toe to toe with Buffy, but when she doesn't have her powers, why don't they bring her patrolling and give her a weapon? As in, once you can fight with a sword, regardless of strength, I would assume she would still have the technique to do it."

buffy,2twhon,GinaZaneburritos,9,Tue Jan 27 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the series makes any secret of the fact that some vampire's are just special. Dru has her second sight and I think you're right in the fact that her ability to mesmerize (hypnotize?) is an extension of that. Her insanity is a result of the torment Angelus put her through prior to her siring.   As for why Buffy is able to resist certain vampires powers but only after succumbing to them, I've always had a theory that what doesn't (or in some cases does) kill the slayer makes her stronger. “Blood is life"" Spike says but I think it goes deeper than that, which is why I think Buffy is more or less immune to Drac's abilities once she feeds off of him. I think of it akin to like supernatural antibodies. Not that this works for everyone but she is the slayer after all. I believe that there's a deeper connection between vampires and the slayer, which the series sort of touches on with the whole ""her powers stem from darkness"" thing.  I think you're right in that Buffy's abilities are tied to her emotions and state of mind, like what she explained to Kendra about having the fire.   So yeah when it comes down to it I think some vamps are just special. They do get stronger with age and who knows what kind of abilities they're able to develop over the a long time. Their appearance changes eg the Master and Kakistos so why couldn't they develop other powers or learn them via magick.   As a bit of an aside I think Spike is one of these special vampires, just not in the same way as say Dru or the Master. Before she sires him Dru says something like she sees light in him or something, indicating that she perceives his specialness. He's more tied to the world and his actions aren't dictated by the powerful evil that vamps apparently feel connected to once they awaken. He goes off on his own to get a soul, which is obviously something your run of the mill vamp doesn't do. Even when he gets it he's pretty much the same Spike as he developed into s4-6, just ensouled. As you can probably tell I think Spike is one of if not the most interesting character haha. Hope this helped in one way or another."

buffy,2twhon,heymeowmeow,3,Wed Jan 28 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, hypnosis was always thought to be one of Dracula's abilities, and it was often depicted in the early Dracula movies in which Bela Lugosi gave such a memorable performance.  When we see the Master hypnotize Buffy, his gestures are exactly the same as Bela Lugosi used to use.  He is following a well established tradition.   People have often attributed mysterious power to actual hypnotists, and hypnotism has often been a part of the acts of stage magicians.  To a large extent, vampires who hypnotize people are doing what many people think that garden variety, non-vampire hypnotists can do.   In the case of Drusilla, it appears that in her previous human existence she had psychic powers, and that she simply retained those powers when she became a vampire.  This made her unusually dangerous, although not as dangerous as she might have been had she not also been insane.  As an insane, psychic vampire, she was quite unusual."

buffy,2tvhm4,TabulaRasa108,12,Tue Jan 27 19:42:26 2015 UTC,What? No love for Spike?  He and Wesley are my two favorites.
buffy,2tvhm4,catdoctor,8,Tue Jan 27 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"I sort of have a hard time deciding where Spike places among the various characters in my mind. I wouldn't say that he's my favorite in either Buffy or Angel due to not having as much as a presence as other characters. I definitely really like him for what time he spent in both, though. He's easily one of the funniest characters on Buffy."
buffy,2tvhm4,Dog-boy,6,Tue Jan 27 21:01:44 2015 UTC,I always look forward to Spike showing up on Angel. Their relationship is so hilarious.
buffy,2tvhm4,strawberryf1elds,3,Wed Jan 28 01:33:37 2015 UTC,Mine too! They redefine what it means for a character to have an arc lol.
buffy,2tvhm4,Dog-boy,5,Wed Jan 28 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"Having watched both series several times, I find my feelings toward various characters change over time. First time through Buffy Xander and Angel both annoyed the hell out of me. Angel because of the broody thing and Xander because of the nice guy, goofy teenage male thing. And I disliked Dawn intensely. I'm not even sure I noticed Jonathan as a recurring character at the beginning.   Over the years though I have grown to love most of them. Xander can still annoy me during the early seasons but I recognize that he is no more flawed than anyone else. His flaws are just the kind that I find more difficult to ignore. Don't we all have certain flaws in others that make us more crazy? I often find, in the real world, that the things that annoy me most in others are similar to the things that bother me most in myself.  Dawn's whinging doesn't bother me anymore now that I don't have teenagers in the house. Having not left my SO at the alter and living through a difficult marriage that ended in divorce leaves me more sympathetic to Xander. Should he have faced his fears earlier? You betcha, as should I and many others.   I love the shows for the characters, including their warts. I love it for how they grow and develop as individuals and as a group. I love it for the message it sends that what we do is what matters."
buffy,2tvhm4,gypsiequeen,14,Wed Jan 28 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to hear your reasons for having Xander as your favourite --- after rewatching the series when i was older, i borderline hated Xander. I felt he encompassed that NiceGuyTM who 'deserved' to 'have' Buffy.  Lies about Angel, and in the beginning was only nice to Buffy because he wanted in her pants, and continued to be an asshole jealous wanker about throughtout the entire series.  DOn't get be started on how he treated Anya  I guess, by the end, he got better (maybe it took losing his eye)   There are other instances where he says douchey things and the reaction is always 'oh that Xander' or 'boys will be boys' kinda thing. I think he made gross comments about Dawn one time too. bleck."
buffy,2tvhm4,captawesome91,7,Tue Jan 27 21:11:34 2015 UTC,I like xander despite his various flaws. All the characters having flaws is a major recurring theme in the series. On top of that I try and remember that Xander is 16 when the series starts. He definitely embodies that nice guy type that you're talking about. However I think that's pretty accurate for an immature teenage guy. His immature sometimes shitty behavior is Also pretty characteristic of a young man transitioning to adulthood. I'm still mad he left Anya at the altar but he was 22. I'm 24 tomorrow and I know I'd be just as terrified and having the same doubts and asking the same questions if I were in his shoes 2 years ago. He handled it poorly. He makes mistakes. But so does everyone else on the show which is part of what makes it great.
buffy,2tvhm4,kaggzz,4,Tue Jan 27 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday!  Also I think Xander's leaving Anya at the alter is one of the saddest things in the whole series.  What people often forget is that he did it because he was afraid of becoming his family.  Which is a very real fear for anyone getting married, especially if you think about what Xander's family was like.  I think Xander gets a lot of extra crap here that he doesn't deserve."
buffy,2tvhm4,captawesome91,2,Wed Jan 28 01:14:03 2015 UTC,Thank you! That's very true as well. Besides it's not like Buffy ever falls for his nice guy entitled crap. The characters on this show are so fleshed out and well rounded that it's hard to not find redeeming qualities for each one.
buffy,2tvhm4,kaggzz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the Xander hate comes from people who do not understand that every character in the show is flawed by their greatest strenghts. Buffy is strong, but she tried to carry the load all by herself.  Xander sees everything and is willing to sacrifice everything for the people he loves. It's what makes him the glue of the Scoobies and why someone who doesn't have any special powers or a lifetime of training and learning can hang with the Slayer and a witch and bring something to the table for going on 9 seasons now. It also means he's willing to be the meanie and say things like ""You know he's only a good guy because someone put a gun to his head"" when Buffy is dating Angel, or ""We've seen how this plays out, and its "" when Buffy gets with Spike. This makes him seem like a bastard, but in reality he is acting on what he has seen and is willing to fall on his sword to keep Buffy from experiencing the sort of heartbreak and pain. He runs from Anya because he sees how his parents are, and you can include Buffy's divorced parents and Willow's almost non-existant parents as well, and he doesn't want to make someone he loves go through that. He ""gets away"" with mistakes like Sweet because he is there to help any of the Scoobies without question, and instead of burdening them with his problems he plays the Zeppo and handles his issues as best he can.  A lot of the Xander hate also comes from the fact that he doesn't fit the ""Buffy was all about Feminism and Female empowerment!"" mold that some people want to shoe horn the show into."
buffy,2tvhm4,GinaZaneburritos,10,Wed Jan 28 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I just like Xander for being a goofy normal guy with a big heart and a lot of courage. Being a guy myself, he's easily the most relatable character in the series for me. His role in the climax of S6 must have made me like him more than I did previously. Something about him just resonates with me more than Willow and Buffy do."
buffy,2tvhm4,Just_A_Faze,9,Tue Jan 27 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to like about Xander. Of course, he has his flaws, but ... he's part of the unit :)  Also, I'm not sure if you already knew this, but Joss Whedon modeled Xander after himself in high school. So you're in good company."
buffy,2tvhm4,gypsiequeen,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about that, in Joss Whedens continuation via comics, Xander ends up with Dawn. They aren't arbitrary comments. They live together in San Fransisco."
buffy,2tvhm4,ultrahedgehog,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:52:44 2015 UTC,yup! -- just about to start season 10 myself
buffy,2tvhm4,gypsiequeen,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"See, I don't get the ""nice guyTM"" thing from Xander at all. Yes, he lusted after Buffy-- which is fine. He still treated her like a person, and he did the right thing and turned her down when she was under the spell he cast. He was jealous of the other guys in her life, which, again, I don't think he can be entirely faulted for. People don't have that much control over their emotions, only their actions, and I think Xander's actions were appropriate. Can you point to a specific instance of Xander acting entitled or like he ""deserved"" Buffy? I'm coming up pretty empty.  He was a good friend and a helpful co-fighter and he wanted to sleep with her. That doesn't mean he was only a good friend because he wanted to sleep with her."

buffy,2tvhm4,Psychoho1ic,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"I just found that he came back a bit too abruptly in S6, which made it somewhat hard for me to care about him as an antagonist. He could have appeared in an episode or two in S5 that has him do some magic stuff, possibly with Willow and Tara. It would have been nice to see him do stuff in college as well. There was a lack of foreshadowing to his becoming friends with Warren and Andrew."

So many on-demand services now have Buffy like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Sky and I'm sure lots more.   We've certinally seen a big boom in subs since on-demand services started showing Buffy. I think there's also a lot of people who have got back into Buffy becaue of this as well.   Just a testament really to how great the show is and as you say, Long may she slay :)"

buffy,2tw9e4,xqjt,3,Tue Jan 27 22:58:28 2015 UTC,I just assumed it came from her slayer foresight and powers. Something in her (slayer intuition?) knew that something very important happened just then and she interpreted it as deja-vu. That was my take on it.
buffy,2tw9e4,danielle_kb,2,Wed Jan 28 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"Either that or she dreamed about the floppy. Anyway, if there was such a dream, I don't remember seeing it in a previous episode and the scene where we first see the floppy does not really match the scene where the pen falls (apart from the viewpoint). Maybe it took part in a deleted scene."
buffy,2tw9e4,Catnips_Featherbeef,2,Wed Jan 28 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"Slayer power. I know that's the easy answer but it seems to encompass most of the things like that in the series. Buffy does have a form of prophetic dreams and if you remember that's how she figured out Calendar wasn't who she said she was in the first place. Being the slayer tunes her into the extra-natural things that normal people don't pick up on. If anything I think she didn't really use this ability quite enough, but that's just me."
buffy,2tsve4,fatexfellxshort,10,Tue Jan 27 03:37:17 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love about television (as opposed to film) is that there's so much more opportunity for character development and growth. As an audience member, you're a witness to these characters' lives literally hours at a time. You see how they react to different circumstances and form new relationships, all over the span of years. There's just not room to explore that kind of thing in a 2-3 hour long movie.  I love Spike, but a big part of why I like him has to do with the fact that I got to see so much of what happened to him and what he did. That's not true with Loki. To be honest - and I admit that it's been a long time since I saw the movie, so I'm a little fuzzy on the details of what happened in it - I found him kind of unremarkable."
buffy,2tsve4,GinaZaneburritos,3,Tue Jan 27 11:05:21 2015 UTC,"It is certainly true that a TV series allows for greater character development than a movie, simply by having more time in which to do it.  Tom Hiddleston as Loki was very successful in presenting an image of arrogant and cruel power.  It was a great performance.  But Spike was a more interesting character."
buffy,2tsve4,excultist,2,Tue Jan 27 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply he wasn't good. I meant ""unremarkable"" in the sense that Loki isn't a character who's stuck with me all this time, whose motivations and struggles I found deeply moving and relatable. To be honest, I was far more interested in the dynamics of the Avengers in that movie than in the villain.  I know Joss Whedon made a comment somewhere that Loki was like Spike, but I think Loki suffers in comparison. I don't think they're equatable, is all, and it's absolutely possible to like Spike yet not love Loki."

Xander's fight against Anya was one of the hardest boss fights I've encountered in years.  I just wanted to play as Spike and was disappointed that there are only two levels where you play as him. Does the game give you a character select mode after you complete it?
buffy,2trnzi,Interference22,2,Tue Jan 27 09:01:18 2015 UTC,There's a multiplayer mode where you can fight against big groups of enemies and select a bunch of characters. But the characters for story mode are fixed.
buffy,2trnzi,Interference22,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:07:03 2015 UTC,"The multiplayer mode is fine for a little while, but the combat is simplified compared to the main game (you don't have to stake enemies anymore, you just punch them until they die, which is lame IMO).

Certainly the likenesses are an improvement and all the main characters, barring Buffy herself, are played by the original actors. Heck, even the stand-in for SMG does a decent job.  You can usually get it on Amazon for under $10.  There are also Buffy games for Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, and Nintendo DS. Only the DS one is worth a look, though, as it has a story written by Rob Des Hotel and is set after the series ended. Even so, it's not that great."

buffy,2truo7,heymeowmeow,2,Tue Jan 27 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"Buffy is a very understandable character.  Responsibility devolved upon her, it was her fate which she could not escape, so she accepted it and generally fulfilled it (even though she did become catatonic once, during season 5, and had to be brought back by Willow).  And other than that, was a relatively normal person.  I always felt that I understood her decisions.  As with Angel whom I also commented on in the Angel sub-reddit, there are some unanswered questions about Buffy's world.  One force of evil who survives the series is the master vengeance demon whose name I will spell as D'Hoffryn (even though I could be wrong).  There is no telling how much damage he can still do, and he does seem to be extremely powerful.  Exactly why he is devoted to offering women the opportunity to get revenge against men, when he is masculine, is not obvious, although there is no reason why a demon needs to feel loyalty to his gender.  Somehow, he is never on such a direct collision course with Buffy that she has to regard him as the Big Bad, although he does seem very big and very bad in his own way.  We may never know what becomes of him (unless it is dealt with in the comics which I have not read)."
buffy,2truo7,excultist,7,Tue Jan 27 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"A few quick notes.   D'Hoffryn does have a role in the comics. I won't spoil it for you, but he's much more a morally grey force of power than any kind of actual, real big bad. D'Hoffryn does not seem to have a particularly vested interest in destroying reality, and actually seems more interested in order--just not necessarily a kind that's always palatable to humans. D'Hoffryn is not specifically interested in helping women get vengeance on men. He's just interested in wreaking vengeance upon humans in general. The individual vengeance demons that work for him may have their own pet projects (such as Anya's interest in avenging wronged women, or Halfrek's interest in vengeance against neglectful parents), but D'Hoffryn is interested in vengeance more broadly."
buffy,2truo7,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"Beat me to it! Was going to say exactly point #2. :)  I'd say that D'Hoffryn is most interested (professionally) in the pain that is so extreme and so self-involved that it hurts those nearby, and indeed is intent on making others nearby suffer in order that the outside world feel a measure of what the victim internally feels. Recall that he visited Willow after she performed her ""I will it"" spell in ""Something Blue."" The important part of that spell was that she derived her power from a dark place - a place of anger and rage. Her attempt to heal her heart, learn from books, and un-bend a Q-tip didn't work, because she wasn't sufficiently enraged.   Vengeance is not justice, in that it exacts a price for wrongs done. It is a pure expression of infantile rage and self-involvement that asserts itself on everyone nearby, regardless of whether they were the cause of the pain or not. Neither was D'Hoffryn very interested in Willow's abortive attempt to get revenge on Oz and Veruca. It's true that probably the specific plot of the episode was a factor in whether he took an interest or not, but I think that the idea of ""crying out for attention into the void"" is a big part of what he considers vengeance to be.   And this is related, I think, to whether or not he's evil. This kind of self-involved pain simply is; it's a fact of life, like the First Evil. Like every drop of hate ... it's like every screaming toddler's cry. It can't really be fought. You can fight vengeance demons, but not vengeance itself."
buffy,2tqgsj,coolbeaNs92,4,Mon Jan 26 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"I think the really great thing about Tara as a character was that, even though she loved Willow completely, and even though she'd had her own emotional problems with her family that made her come off as a bit of a doormat, she ultimately maintained her boundaries when a situation in the relationship went too far for her to accept. She provides an example that it is okay to say No, and to hold others accountable for their actions, even-- and especially-- when you love them."
buffy,2tqgsj,excultist,2,Tue Jan 27 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"I thought that the Willow-Tara plotline worked extremely well, and I cared for them as a couple and wished them well; of course in Sunnydale the mortality rate is high.  In terms of being a force for greater social acceptance of the GLBTQ community in general, this is not as revolutionary as ""Queer As Folk"" but still, it did contribute something meaningful."
buffy,2tqgsj,excultist,2,Mon Jan 26 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree.  Willow's relationship with Tara seemed very natural, not something that was there to make a point about gay rights.  That was just the way it worked out.  Willow's first love turned out to be a werewolf, and her second turned out to be another woman and a fellow witch.  Both of these were beautiful relationships and in both cases it was tragic that they failed."

Keeping in mind I'm old enough to have seen Rob and Laura and Andy and Helen in first-run, I've always thought Willow and Tara were the most perfectly matched couple on television and in the Top Ten for all on-screen portrayals.

There were so many stoylines to tie up and I think having just one episode wasn't enough to be honest. Never blamed Joss, as I think the 22 episodes is what you're given as a standard season, but I've always thought it would have been nice.   If you haven't already, get cracking with Angel, which will give you another five seasons of fun (well, most of the time). Then you've always got the comics, with our reading guide.

Definitely check out the Buffy spin-off Angel if you haven't yet - it has a darker, more adult tone to it, but it's a key part of the Buffyverse. Also there are several comics that follow Buffy, Xander, et al. after the season 7 finale - check out the comics mega-thread in this sub's FAQ.  I've watched Buffy several times, and I have to say that one of the few things better than watching it for the first time is re-watching it. There are so many details that you notice the next time around. In fact, just this last time I rewatched it I picked up on a couple of cool things that I'd never noticed before (like the fact that Dawn is wearing green when Glory is talking to her in the hospital in season 5, and again when Dark Willow finds her at Rack's in season 6 - cause she used to be a ""mystic ball of green energy"")."

The series debuted on ABC during the 2014–15 television season as the mid-season fill-in for Once Upon a Time.  Season 1 consists of eight episodes which will air over four weeks as ABC has scheduled two episodes per Sunday. The series reunites Fogelman, Menken, and Slater, who had worked together on the 2010 animated film Tangled (produced by ABC's corporate sibling Walt Disney Animation Studios).   A teaser trailer debuted on September 28, 2014 on ABC during the Once Upon A Time season premiere, which described the series as a four-week ""comedy extravaganza"" that will air in January 2015. On November 5, 2014, ABC announced that the series would air on Sundays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern/7:00 p.m. Central starting January 4.

buffy,2tmzfb,The_Ripper42,6,Sun Jan 25 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Considering the spell has to do with manipulating time (a 'temporal fold'), isn't it possible that it reached into the universe during the time it still existed in an attempt to get the amulet? When we see a temporal fold in Angel, it brings Angel, who has existed in the ""Angel-turns-human"" timeline back one day with his memory intact.   Obviously since it's just a show arguing about what's possible is kind of moot, but I think maybe in the instant that Cordelia made a wish, there's a parallel bubble of time and space which closed when Giles smashed the amulet, but that the temporal fold spell reached into that split and recovered vampire Willow."

Also, Anya complains bitterly to D'Hoffryn about losing her powers. But she never says a cross word to Giles about it, and he did it to her. I know he doesn't remember that, but does she?

buffy,2tllnz,happycowsmmmcheese,12,Sun Jan 25 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"That was pretty much my reaction the first time I read it. Maybe at some point I'll read it again to see if I like it any better.  Season 9 is much better, though! As are the Angel & Faith comics. I highly recommend you don't let the end of season 8 make you give up on the Buffyverse comics. :)"
buffy,2tllnz,GinaZaneburritos,13,Sun Jan 25 09:10:25 2015 UTC,as if i had a choice. I can't stop taking in buffy content. this is worse than when i started watching doctor who. In Joss we trust.
buffy,2tllnz,GinaZaneburritos,7,Sun Jan 25 09:11:57 2015 UTC,"If you search the subreddit for ""Season 8,"" there are several threads that go in-depth into the season and everyone's reaction to it.

buffy,2tllnz,GhostSongX4,11,Sun Jan 25 10:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I remember right he apologized for it at the end of Season 8. He said that he was given an unlimited special effects budget and went crazy.   So season 9 goes back to the roots of Buffy and from what I read it's better.   He should save his over the top superheroics for Marvel anyways."
buffy,2tllnz,stickittodolores,5,Sun Jan 25 11:23:27 2015 UTC,I like s8 but 9 is definitely a better read.

buffy,2tllnz,stickittodolores,1 point,Mon Jan 26 11:01:40 2015 UTC,Im enjoying 10. I am only about six issues in so far. I like to get a few issues and read them one after the other. Bothers me to read one then have to wait another month for the next.
buffy,2tllnz,apocalypsenowandthen,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:36:00 2015 UTC,Sweet. I started buying season 9 every month but I just got so behind on them that I didn't read them until the whole thing was done. I'll probably wait for the trades this time around.
buffy,2tllnz,GMLiddell,2,Mon Jan 26 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"Copying my old comment on the end of Season 8 from /r/angel :  I know everybody hates the whole Twilight thing because it was handled clunkily but hear me out. If you examine the character of Angel before he began Twilight, as well as the resultant situation of the new dimension, it really does make a lot of sense and is actually the culmination of plot threads that run through both series. For such a huge and difficult series of ideas to be just dumped and resolved in a few terse 25 page issues, yeah that was difficult, but it made sense. It actually fits his character really well and definitely counts as foreshadowing if not outright setup.  Throughout all of Angel Season 5, Angel was compromising his morals in order to give himself the power to create something he thought might be better and offset the damage done. Wolfram and Hart protected Angel throughout both series [You never see it in Buffy but they say that they've been working on him since before] and later nurtured that trait in him for the entire 5th season so that he could be a key player in the apocalypse of this universe. When The First also brought Angel back from the Hell dimension it said that it had bigger plans for him, and The Powers That Be always said that he would play a crucial role in the final apocalypse of the universe and in turn they sent Whistler to help steer him away from evil. Whistler however was actually a student of the Universal Recreation and wanted Twilight to merge with Angel to rebirth the universe.  Angel went on to coordinate the anti-Slayer movement as Twilight in order to to limit the potential damage, again trying to compromise his morals for a larger context. His larger context being that of getting Buffy into a position where they could destroy the universe and create a fresh one. He has a long streak of trying to protect his friends by leaving them out of his affairs as well. Connor is a great example - wiping his son's entire experience and memory of who he is just to protect him from having a dangerous and supernaturally involved life.  Anyway I'm getting a bit rambly here but you get the idea. Even though they totally dropped the ball on presentation, Twilight makes storywriting sense and can be traced way back."
buffy,2tllnz,AngelAmongUs,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"He also had Lorne kill Lindsey when he was fighting on their side, for his own idea of the greater good. He has locked lawyers in a room to be eaten, and cut off Lindsey's hand. Sometimes his choices are not good ones even if he thinks the ends will justify the means. Angel is not a traditional hero, he's an anti-hero."

buffy,2tkh5s,yallcat,34,Sun Jan 25 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"Not too uncommon, both because it's Hollywood and because Buffy had so many cast members. George Hertzberg (Adam) hasn't worked since 2008. Mercedes McNab (Harmony) hasn't worked since 2011. Robia LaMorte (Jenny) since 2005 (she gave up to focus on Christianity). Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy) hasn't worked since 2007, many others I'm sure. Just to be clear, I mean ""worked"" as in o camera in television/film, not that they've been unemployed :)   As /u/excultist said, very unpredictable industry. And also, people's lives change and they switch careers."
buffy,2tkh5s,coolbeaNs92,12,Sun Jan 25 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"And when Mercedes did work, she played a vampire."

buffy,2tkh5s,radseam,3,Sun Jan 25 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Amy Acker is in like the first couple episodes, and I already know from a friend telling me that Charisma Carpenter and James Marsters are in an episode together. I look forward to freaking out over any and all that show up."
buffy,2tkh5s,coolbeaNs92,3,Sun Jan 25 19:06:04 2015 UTC,Felicia Day (who was a potential in season 7) is on Supernatural's current season.
buffy,2tkh5s,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:23:09 2015 UTC,I thought I'd seen a random screenshot of her in it! That's really cool.  I literally just finished season 5 of Supernatural. Not sure what to expect from here.
buffy,2tkh5s,strawberryf1elds,2,Tue Jan 27 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"The show's quality really declines after season 5. But you should keep watching, there's some amazing episodes and moments."
buffy,2tkh5s,Beloit,8,Tue Jan 27 18:10:41 2015 UTC,I'm obviously comparing her with her character which I shouldn't but I wouldn't have thought of Robia as a big christian.
buffy,2tkh5s,strawberryf1elds,17,Sun Jan 25 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"She's a massive Christian. I'm pretty sure her leaving was also partly due to not wanting to play demonic forces and thought it was hypocritical. Can't remember the whole story, but I think that played some part. I think Joss did want her to portray The First again in season 7 but she turned it down. Again, can't remember 100% for sure, but something along those lines."
buffy,2tkh5s,Jessijames,12,Sun Jan 25 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"That's kinda ironic considering her last role on the show was playing the source of all evil. That's a shame, I loved her character."
buffy,2tkh5s,ModerateBias,5,Sun Jan 25 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was what I meant. After playing The First, it was apparently too close to the devil or something along those lines. Can't remember the full details, but it basically all centres around Christianity."
buffy,2tkh5s,N4U534,3,Sun Jan 25 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure she became religious after her run on the show-- I remember reading that she wasn't religious when she played Jenny. I think you're right that she wouldn't come back to play The First because she'd been ""born again."""
buffy,2tkh5s,Beloit,4,Sun Jan 25 09:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she was about to be attacked by a biker gang or something and prayed for a miracle to save her, and then something did save her so she became a born-again Christian."
buffy,2tkh5s,excultist,5,Sun Jan 25 03:27:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking born again. I did a bit of research and found this  It seems like she was using her time at the conventions to preach. Each to their own and all of that. She must be an amazing actress because she is NOTHING like her character.
buffy,2tkh5s,11Hyperbole121,4,Sun Jan 25 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"Other way around, actually. While driving her car she was praying for god to give her a sign, and suddenly she was surrounded by a Christian biker gang. She saw that as the sign she was asking for and as a result she became a born-again Christian."

buffy,2tkh5s,barre_chord_reality,21,Sun Jan 25 15:51:49 2015 UTC,I've often thought the Buffy cast were such an untapped source within Hollywood. We know there are some amazing actors there but very few have really 'made' it. Sarah is an talented actress and I feel like she just needs the perfect movie script to really showcase what she can do. Alyson has obviously gone the furthest and is a big star now. I sometimes wonder how Charisma's career would have changed if they had let Joss cast her as wonder woman all those years ago.
buffy,2tkh5s,sallydreams,13,Sun Jan 25 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"I have at times wondered the same thing about Charisma, I think she would have made a great Wonder Woman."
buffy,2tkh5s,barre_chord_reality,10,Sun Jan 25 05:06:59 2015 UTC,"SMG?  Uh, pretty sure a few major motion pictures, 8 years on a daily soap, and so on are pretty made it.  Her choice to cut back was one made based on her desire to have a family, and her dislike of public spotlight (she is a very vocal anti paparazzi activist)  Also, Seth Green and Borneaz are just, if not more, big of stars.   Green moved into directing.    Bones has been running for a looong time now.  Now there certainly are some people who went under the radar, but think you are underestimating how many became big starts too."
buffy,2tkh5s,sallydreams,2,Sun Jan 25 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think most people I know recognize Seth for his work on Robot Chicken, Family Guy, etc. rather than Buffy."
buffy,2tkh5s,p72entrophy,5,Tue Jan 27 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say it's Seth who's gone the furthest since Buffy rather than Alyson. The list of work he's done is massive.  Edit: And some of the titles he's done are really well known, like various Marvel titles (Guardians of the Galaxy, Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., Avengers Assemble), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars, Mass Effect, and of course Robot Chicken."
buffy,2tkh5s,SGB_Mom,5,Sun Jan 25 13:19:41 2015 UTC,The acting profession is notoriously unpredictable.  You never know who is or is not going to appeal to a casting director for any given project.
buffy,2tkh5s,misskittyfantastic0,9,Sun Jan 25 01:28:34 2015 UTC,She wasn't the best actress tbh
buffy,2tkh5s,Angelus333,0,Sun Jan 25 03:37:48 2015 UTC,I hated her character and how she tried to control Willow.
buffy,2tkh5s,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sun Jan 25 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"Can you expand a bit on Kennedy trying to control Willow aspect?   Couldn't it be said that she helped Willow recover from her grief from her loss of Tara by breaking the hex of Warren manifesting himself as The First? Kennedy didn't have to do any of this, but she did because she cared deeply for Willow."
buffy,2tkh5s,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sun Jan 25 16:36:41 2015 UTC,She was constantly nagging Willow to not practice magic and never seemed to trust Willow's judgement.
buffy,2tkh5s,legacyst,3,Sun Jan 25 21:27:15 2015 UTC,Tara also tried to convince Willow that she was using and relying on magics too much. Isn't that kind of a leap from being controlling to being concerned about somebody who had a pretty serious history with abuse of magics?
buffy,2tkh5s,Jubjub0527,2,Sun Jan 25 21:55:10 2015 UTC,"Willow had manipulated Tara with magic though, that's different. Also, Tara knew Willow well enough that she saw changes in her like if your SO was blindly becoming an alcoholic before their eyes. Kennedy was going on assumptions and planting self doubt in Willow when instead she should have been supportive before the bad signs showed up again."
buffy,2tkh5s,badcamera,3,Mon Jan 26 00:44:35 2015 UTC,I think one contributing factor would be her marriage in 2007
buffy,2tkh5s,Jubjub0527,2,Sun Jan 25 02:06:40 2015 UTC,Maybe she just prefers voice acting work over doing on camera work.

I also know she was involved in an accident that damaged her neck right after her daughter was born & her daughter was in the vehicle but her car carrier protected her.

Beat perception in animals of article  Beat deafness:       Most people have the inborn ability to perceive the beat in music. Once we become a bit older, we can use this ability to dance and move in step to music. Recent research has shown that beat perception is not unique to humans. Even some animals such as parrots can detect beat and can dance to the beat of music.  A research team led by Aniruddh D. Patel of The Neurosciences Institute concluded that Sulphur-crested Cockatoos have the ability to perceive the beat in music and are able to rhythmically move to the tempo of the music as it changes. Only vocal learning species such as dolphins and parrots are hypothesized to have the ability to perceive beat. This is because beat perception and movement rely on complex vocal learning which require motor and auditory circuits in the brain. Vocal learning and beat perception do some overlapping in the parts of the brain that account auditory and motor areas. There is no significant evidence for beat perception in nonvocal learning species such as dogs and cats.

buffy,2tdc4v,walkthroughthefire,12,Fri Jan 23 04:20:16 2015 UTC,"I'd actually like to see Buffy have some kind of mature relationship that lasts somewhat already. Her story can still be interesting and full of diversity with a stable significant other.   She was just a kid with Angel and let's face it, he was a pretty conflicted individual with obsessive qualities (soul or no soul). He showed her what she wanted out of a boyfriend, though. Someone who could be her equal and partner against the forces of darkness, who could understand and accept her world. The only thing they had a hard time with was being actual friends. Instead they were so stupid in love with each other, it nearly destroyed them.  Riley was a decent match in the beginning, just not a fan favorite because he wasn't Angel. It hardly ever works out with the ""rebound guy"", as it is. After he lost his super soldier strength and became a normal guy, it became pretty apparent their dynamic got thrown off. She subconsciously (and probably somewhat consciously) lumped him in with her other friends, people she loved but shouldered the responsibility of having to take care of. He wasn't her equal anymore and it made him do some weird stuff to cope with that.  But hey, I'm not judging. Spike is the definition of weird (pre-soul, anyways). Despite everything that's happened between them, they have learned how to be good friends (even best friends, according to some of the other Scoobies), he's already her partner against the forces of darkness, and they've seen each other do some pretty weird and dark things... yet they still respect each other. She's growing up and his soul is maturing him (re: growing up) so it kinda makes sense that they've reached a point where she's ready to say ""fuck it, let's do this."" The only problem now may be that he's really gotten over her and is going to try to convince her that ""they"" are not a good idea. Or he does something dramatically stupid that throws Buffy into another year of angst.  Which is boring at this point. The whole ""star-crossed-at-the-wrong-time-immature-handling-of-a-romantic-situation"" Buffy is old hat. Give the girl a boyfriend already, especially if he's a fan favorite (for the most part.)"

I get that it happens in comics when artists rotate in and out for different issues but I never want to see Buffy herself drawn with such freaky eyes and features again. It completely ruined the opening scene for me which I would have found hysterical otherwise.
buffy,2tdc4v,Frank_the_Bunneh,4,Sat Jan 24 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"As someone with piercings I will tell you: there is no way those nipple piercings would've gotten tangled like that. They're captive bead rings, they don't work that way.  I'm not really a fan of the art. It wasn't particularly bad, it just looked kind of wonky overall, but especially the faces. The artist didn't really portray movement or action very well, either. But I liked the demons and the kittens were drawn.  Gonna get downvoted to hell, but I groaned at the last page. I was glad Buffy and Spike were finally having a mature, amicable relationship. I thought we had some progress and we were moving on from Spuffy. But nope. We have to go back to it again. Sigh.  Andrew's superpower scene was really weird. I didn't really understand what was going on. Well, I can see what's happening, but I don't get the reason behind it. Hopefully there'll be more explanation in the next issue. I'm glad Andrew's finally coming out of the closet, though.  Edit: improved wording a bit."

That was an actual plot point that occurred. The scythe had been broken when Buffy destroyed the Seed of Wonder, and was later restored in ""Willow: Wonderland."" Its restoration resulted in a new look for the scythe; it not longer has any silver, and is now all red.  If you're talking about something else, then I missed it.  Will likely comment about the other things later (trying to get some work done), but I'll quickly say that Andrew's transformation was weird and sudden, and I hope not permanent (although I'm pleased he came out), and that I squealed with delight about the Spuffy kiss and shouted ""THEY'RE KISSING"" to my husband, who was in the other room."
buffy,2tc2hd,jatie,26,Thu Jan 22 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"I actually wasn't that sad that Joyce was dead, but the way her death was portrayed was just so real and disturbing and I think that's why people give it so much attention. It's definitely one of the most well-made episodes of the series. To be honest, I kind of don't like Joyce though. I felt bad for Buffy and Dawn when she died, but I didn't miss her. Everybody always talks about what a good mother she was, but there was some pretty crappy parenting going on in the earlier seasons, especially when she kicked Buffy out of the house at the end of season 2 and when she came back, acted like Buffy was the one who had just randomly run away."
buffy,2tc2hd,walkthroughthefire,10,Fri Jan 23 02:07:30 2015 UTC,"The reactions are why I find 'The Body' so hard to watch. I wasn't particularly sad about Joyce, but the rest of the cast is so incredible in that episode - the long shot of Buffy while she's doing CPR and waiting for the ambulance, Dawn's breakdown in the hallway, Willow trying to figure out what to wear, Anya's speech... they captured the many ways that people process grief in an incredibly real way. I also think people relate to Joyce's death because it was something so normal that could happen to any of us (or any of our parents), rather than something paranormal like the other deaths in the Buffyverse."
buffy,2tc2hd,deets19,4,Fri Jan 23 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's a good point.  Joyce Summers was not the greatest mom.  Of course, the problem of having a daughter who was a vampire slayer is unusually difficult (and to be fair, Joyce actually did once save Buffy's life, the first time Spike attacked Buffy).  The sadness of that episode did not derive from the value of Joyce as a character, but from the reactions of the people who knew her.  I had to sympathize with all the characters who were so devastated by Joyce's death.  At the same time, in my own secret heart of hearts, I also thought that Joyce's death was ironic.  What are the chances that anybody who lives in Sunnydale is going to die of natural causes?  And Joyce was very close to the center of all the supernatural conflict.  Yet it was not the supernatural which killed her.  Anyway, I did not experience Joyce's death as a terrible loss, but I did feel strongly sympathetic toward Buffy and Dawn and even Anya who was really more confused than anything else.  Anya, who had killed so many people as a vengeance demon, still did not understand what death really means.  That was very sad.  But yes, there are other deaths that were sadder.  There is a lot of tragedy in the Buffyverse."
buffy,2tc2hd,excultist,8,Fri Jan 23 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"I am so there with Fred. It was so drawn out and painful. And then Wesley too ""Would you like me to lie to you now?"" :( For me, although I cried during The Body, I cried much harder during Forever when Buffy and Dawn break down together-- because that's the saddest part really, isn't it? The death itself is only one part of the experience, it's the grief of those left behind that's really devastating."

Secondly, Joyce's dead looking makeup was umm amazing. Not appreciating the death...but she looked really dead. And comparing that look with a lively sweet Joyce is heart-breaking. Thirdly, Sarah Michelle Gellar outshone herself through her acting. It makes you wanna cry every time you see it. She's brilliant in it. Lastly, you can see how all of them are going to be there for Buffy through a difficult time like this. The way Willow feels so insecure and Tara is trying to comfort her and everyone else is quite relatable and sweet to watch. The rest of the cast also cover it up with a little awkwardness (Anya) as they don't know what to say or do at first...but they're all still together in it and Buffy knows she has their support. Overall, Season 5's episodes are consistent with the same story line but as soon as you watch The Body, everything changes. The little details in it, the direction, the silence...everything was outstanding."

buffy,2tajzy,payton_g,20,Thu Jan 22 15:03:09 2015 UTC,I think the reason I love 2 is because Angel (in his buffy appearances at least) is a MUCH better character as Angelus. His villainous personality is probably one of my favorite things about the show
buffy,2tajzy,mgiblue21,3,Thu Jan 22 19:05:13 2015 UTC,Passion was the episode that really got me into the show. Angelus's sadistic nature was really well shown in season 2 and as someone who didn't watch the show when it aired I was surprised.
buffy,2tajzy,DrLisaCuddy-House,14,Sat Jan 24 23:46:51 2015 UTC,"Everything you mentioned resonates with me as well.  Those are all excellent reasons to love season 2.  We have seen all sorts of evil in this series, terrible powers which potentially could destroy the world, but the exquisite evil of Angelus remains unique, and of course, it also gives Buffy her most painful moral quandary, of having to fight (and ultimately kill) someone whom she still loves.  Beyond that, season 2 has an interesting complexity to it.  For every other season we can identify one force of evil which qualifies as the Big Bad.  The Master in season 1, the mayor in season 3, Adam in season 4, etc.  But in season 2, we really have 4 Big Bads, in the form of Spike, Angelus, The Judge, and Akathla.  None of these could be considered to be a subsidiary force of evil, they are all of primary importance in this season.  And then, of course, in the end Spike decides that Akathla is actually too evil even for him, and switches sides, which was fascinating.  So the season was very richly conceived, full of fascinating characters and psychologically complex situations, and difficult choices.  All of these things do exist in other seasons as well, sometimes with brilliant success, but season 2 remains outstanding."
buffy,2tajzy,excultist,7,Thu Jan 22 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"You are GREAT! The season is so psychologically complex, especially for Buffy. What happened with Angel is a perfect metaphor for what happens in a LOT of relationships. A girl and guy have sex...then the guy completely changes afterwards and his true colors show (although Angel has an excuse...since he lost his soul and all). Also love how there at are multiple big bads! Best season ever."
buffy,2tajzy,vaguelyhuman,7,Thu Jan 22 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"A girl and guy have sex...then the guy completely changes afterwards and his true colors show   Or two people of any genders. I found the whole arc totally relatable watching a few months after the end of a really fucked-up one month-long ""relationship"" with a guy who I lost my virginity to (I'm male)."
buffy,2tajzy,heymeowmeow,3,Thu Jan 22 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"I think of Akathla as more of a means to an end than a big bad. He isn't really a character as much as a weapon.   I would also argue that a lot of the seasons have multiple big bads. For instance, Season 3 has the mayor and Faith. Season 4 has Adam, the overarching initiative/the government and I think to an extent going away to college is the big bad. More precisely, all of the side effects of going away to college like drifting away from family and friends. Season 5 has Glory and Season 6 has Willow (who replaced the trio only at the very end) but both of those seasons also have the big bads of life, adulthood, depression/mental illness, and generally ""myself"" (in a general universal way, not me specifically)."
buffy,2tajzy,excultist,3,Thu Jan 22 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"I think that a distinction can be made between a big problem, and a Big Bad.  If you run out of money that is a big problem but not a Big Bad.  A Big Bad is a deliberately malevolent being of some kind.  Akathla is very unusual as Big Bads go, since he only does one simple thing, which is to open his mouth, thereby creating an inter-dimensional vortex.  Even so, he is a demon, and his actions are done deliberately.  (I was actually a bit disappointed that he remained a stone statue when the sword was withdrawn, I would have liked to see him come to life as some kind of organic creature as other demons are.  I think they just didn't want to pay for more special effects, that episode.)    In the case of Adam and The Initiative, I don't really regard The Initiative as a bad agency; there are many cases when they are quite helpful.  Indeed, had they not implanted the control chip in Spike, he would have remained a force of evil and would not have been eventually converted into the important and necessary force of good that he became.  The Initiative often did not realize what they were doing, but then, that could also be said of the Watcher's Council, which we can hardly regard as a force of evil.  As for Season 3, with the mayor and Faith, Faith becomes one of the mayor's agents, much like Mr. Trick, only more dangerous.  The Big Bad is still the mayor.  I see a difference for example in the relationship of Spike and The Judge, or of Angelus and Akathla.  Spike reassembles The Judge and Angelus revives Akathla, but Spike does not control The Judge and Angelus does not control Akathla, they are all independent forces of evil who sometimes work for the same objective.  Faith just took orders from the mayor, so she became a subsidiary part of his evil plan."
buffy,2tajzy,heymeowmeow,2,Thu Jan 22 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"All very interesting points.  I agree that the initiative is not inherently a force for evil and that they do a fair amount of good, but I still think that, ultimately, they end as a villain (or probably more accurately, a really antagonistic damsel-in-distress type deal in the final battle).   As for Mr. Trick and Faith, I think Faith is much less of an agent than Mr. Trick. Faith does follow the Mayor as a leader but I think one big difference is that Faith was friends with Buffy and the Scoobies and even slept with one of them. She had intimate knowledge of how they work and what their weaknesses were. On top of that, the Mayor has a father-daughter type relationship with her and really cares about her and what she thinks. These two things combined make Faith more of a General or a Junior Partner of sorts in my mind compared to Mr. Trick who I would definitely consider an agent."
buffy,2tajzy,excultist,3,Thu Jan 22 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"If we wanted to make a comparison to another famous work of fantasy, in the context of Buffy season 2, if Mayor Wilkins is Sauron, then Faith is Saruman.  She plays a subordinate, but very major role in the mayor's evil schemes.  It seems like a particularly apt comparison because Faith and Saruman were both previously forces of good, who switched sides to become forces of evil, as servants of greater forces of evil than themselves.  Exactly why Mayor Wilkins is so affectionate toward Faith is open to question.  Here is a person whose greatest wish is to become a giant snake and eat everybody in Sunnydale.  Since the first (and as it turns out, the only) person he eats is his ally Principle Snider, we do not really know that he would not also have eaten Faith at some point.  Giant snakes are not generally known for their sense of loyalty to old human friends.  My sense is that Mayor Wilkins had been a politician for so many years (something like a century) that he had developed a habit of trying to seem like the epitome of conventional American values, who is kind to children and animals, and who is in favor of mom and apple pie, when in reality he was a profoundly evil monster who just wanted to eat people.  This is something that Faith, as a trained and experienced Slayer, should have been able to see, but then we all have our imperfections.  Sometimes you just see what you want to see, and when Faith needed a friend who could protect her from the consequences of her own actions, that is what she chose to see in the mayor.  Anyway, I do not see her as an independent Big Bad, more of a Medium Size Bad, but there is no absolute dividing line.  It is open to interpretation."
buffy,2tajzy,heymeowmeow,2,Thu Jan 22 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"Oooo that Sauroman comparison is pretty apt. Also re: the mayor and faith's relationship being a political move/the mayor may have turned on her eventually, that's an interesting interpretation that I'f never considered. I've always just taken it for granted that his affection is real. My only immediate contradicting thought is the video the mayor left for Faith which shows that he knew his ascension might fail and that he might die, but he still helps her and plans for her future anyway. But I'm probably due for a rewatch of Season 3 anyway since it was my favorite so maybe these thoughts will change."
buffy,2tajzy,excultist,3,Thu Jan 22 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"It's true that the mayor leaves a gift for Faith to use in the event that the mayor himself fails.  I believe that he did so in order to gain some kind of posthumous revenge on Buffy if he was defeated.  Faith was still being used by him.  Mayor Wilkins was never actually kind to anybody, but liked to make a big show of what a nice guy he was.  I think he just enjoyed deceiving people."
buffy,2tajzy,paulcosmith,9,Thu Jan 22 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"It always struck me that the writers began every episode with the question ""What can we do to make Buffy's life hell this week?"""
buffy,2tajzy,Beigenoise,5,Thu Jan 22 20:18:43 2015 UTC,S2 of Buffy and S5 of Angel are the best of each respective show... and my favorite usually comes down to just whichever I've rewatched most recently.
buffy,2tajzy,srauf456,7,Thu Jan 22 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Season 2 covered pretty much everything the show did  later on in the coming seasons as well. Plus, a season with more Buffy and Angel scenes will always be above other seasons! Also, there are episodes like ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" which is not only great because of the story line and the way it was shot...but the message it gives about teenage suicide was a great thing to see. Episodes like ""Passion"" leave a serious impact on the viewers too. Also, Spike's intro, Boreanaz & Gellar's outstanding acting throughout the Season are just some other reasons why this season was absolutely fantastic. (Y)"
buffy,2tajzy,srauf456,2,Thu Jan 22 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you mentioned ""I Only Have Eyes For You""! That's one of my favorite episodes out of the whole series. My favorite part is when Buffy and Angel are kissing at the end of the episode and the ghosts leave their bodies. Buffy, confused, says, ""Angel?"" and Angel runs away! Even he was in shock. ""Passion"" is heartbreaking. The way Angelus sets up Giles to find Jenny lying dead in his bed really shows how Angelus loves torturing people even more than he loves killing them."

buffy,2tajzy,Baseball_dusty,3,Fri Jan 23 08:36:12 2015 UTC,"I agree! I think one of the main reasons I like it so much is that it mixes both MotW episodes with mythology episodes, so when I first watched the show I wasn't sure if I'd get a light episode like ""Halloween"" or a gut-wrenching one like ""Passion"". Also,  personally I think Angelus was the most personal and emotionally difficult Big Bad that Buffy had to face."
buffy,2tajzy,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Jan 23 00:39:52 2015 UTC,I loved seeing how much fun David Boreanaz was clearly having being Angelus.  He communicates joyously evil so well.

buffy,2tajzy,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Jan 23 06:39:08 2015 UTC,"LOL. Personally, I've always liked Buffy's look and hair best in season 5, but I agree, season 2 is probably my second favorite :)  You know, I'm rewatching Buffy now, and it might just be that I didn't focus as much in the past on season 2, but this time around I'm definitely enjoying it more than the rest. Everything just seems so - simple and powerful.  I agree, the moments between Buffy and Angel seem so intimate I also almost feel like I'm intruding! Right now at least, I can't think of any other actors who have ever done that for me.  Also, one of my new favorite lines is ""I've got a thing, you've got a thing, maybe we could have a thing?"" ""Thank you, Cyrano."" :)"
buffy,2tajzy,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Jan 25 10:09:58 2015 UTC,"Season 1 and 2 are core Buffy to me. That is where the heart and soul of the show is. Season 3 through 5 is kind of like a sequel. They are good, but not as good. They lost something. Maybe a grainy camera or something.   The whole arc of Buffy and Angel coming to a head over those two seasons is incredible."
buffy,2tajzy,kaggzz,3,Fri Jan 23 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"I love season 2 because for me, it's when the show really comes into its own. I've written elsewhere about the themes of season 2 and how they are echoed throughout the series, but for me season 2 marks the beginning of truly excellent stories and character development. As well as excellent work all around - the direction of ""Innocence"" in particular is amazing, and all the actors, but especially Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz, reach levels with their performances that honestly I wouldn't have predicted from their work in season 1. The season really shows just how much you can do even with a low budget.  In season 2, it becomes clear that this is not a show about a girl who fights archetypal monsters like the Master (which in itself is a rather cool idea, but if that's as far as it went, I doubt we'd all be here now talking about it 15 or so years later), but instead a show about characters fighting ""their own personal demons"" through the medium of fighting supernatural things. Rather than have villains steeped in religious overtones, the show gives us complex, almost-human bad guys like Spike and Drusilla with their wonderful twisted sexuality and the ability (in the case of Angelus especially) to hurt our heroes in a very intimate way.   Also in season 2, the show adds Marti Noxon as a writer and Christophe Beck as a composer. I've said elsewhere that I like the entire writing staff of Buffy, but to be honest, Rob des Hotel and Dean Batali are by far my least favorites. And I'm a big fan of Beck's work as well. The music in season 1 is pretty unremarkable.  You don't have to have personal experience with relationships gone wrong to appreciate this season. It's just great story-telling.

But there's an episode in the fifth season of Angel where a crazy girl was a potential, and after Willow did her magic became a slayer and escaped the asylum place she was at. When she escapes she kills people, Angel gets involved only to run into Giles, Andrew, etc (no Buffy though). Andrew catches Angel up on Willows magic, and then explains that the Scooby gang are literally all over the world finding different slayers (somehow).  Sorry that doesn't really answer your question, but I think the answer is: a lot, all over the world. My guess is the people that hunted potentials did it through the Watchers counsel, so anyone who didn't have a watcher was safe."

buffy,2t4xb9,GinaZaneburritos,6,Wed Jan 21 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"Could you post the questions again? I feel like I took it a long time ago, and I only remember a few.   I agree that your prediction that the worst death will be Joyce. I think that most people will pick Jenny over Joyce as Giles's love interest (or whatever the wording was) ... although it's possible that I'm drastically underestimating the impact of ""Band Candy."" :) Especially given the wording of the question, I think most people will say Angel was Buffy's soulmate."
buffy,2t4xb9,GinaZaneburritos,2,Wed Jan 21 05:34:46 2015 UTC,Edited post to include survey questions!
buffy,2t4xb9,Beloit,3,Fri Jan 23 03:59:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Just to make sure I'm not insane - there was a question about Giles/Jenny or Giles/Joyce, right? Maybe it was #16, and the options were all in the answers?  OK, just for fun, I'll take a stab at predicting these, fully expecting many of them to be wrong. :)   Q-1. What gender do you identify as? Although I feel certain that Buffy has many fans of many different genders, I think there's probably more female than male fans. But, then again, I'm told that reddit tends to be used by males. So I predict a fairly even split with a small minority of ""other."" Q-2. How old are you? I'd guess that there's a lot of people in the range of 17-27. Hardly any younger (at least that took this survey here), and a small but vocal minority older. Q-3. What country do you live in? Since this is a reddit survey, I'd guess that it is similar to reddit demographics in general - the majority in the United States, a minority in the U.K. or Canada, a smaller minority in other parts of Europe, and a few scattered around the world. Q-4. What is your blood type? Type O is the most common, right? So I guess type O. I also predict a lot of people either didn't know or at least said they didn't know, to avoid appearing tasty to online vampires. Q-5. What is the very first episode of Buffy you ever watched? I have a strong suspicion it's ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" for most of us. Q-6. Which is your favorite season? Seasons 5 and 2 have been getting a lot of love lately, but I predict that season 6 will be the winner. Q-7. Which is your favorite season premiere? This one is tricky. I think the winner will be season 6's ""Bargaining."" My personal favorite is, I think, ""The Freshman"" - which I feel too many people ignore just because it starts off one of their least favorite seasons. Q-8. Which is your favorite season finale? I honestly wouldn't have thought this before coming to /r/buffy, but I expect ""The Gift"" will win. I think every season has a pretty strong finish, though, and that all finales will be represented in the answers. Q-9. And your least favorite season? I predict that every single season will be represented in /r/buffy's answers and that the winner will be season 1. Q-10. What is the name of your favorite episode? Because the question calls for ""favorite"" instead of ""best"" (which I think would give different answers), I'm gonna go with ""Once More, With Feeling."" Q-11. What is the name of your least favorite episode? Previous survey results suggest that the answer will be ""Beer Bad"" ... seriously? That episode actually has a lot going for it IMO. Just to be different, I'm gonna predict ""Where the Wild Things Are."" I think it was talked about around the time of the survey, so maybe that will make it get more votes. Q-12. Do you/would you skip your least favorite episode while watching through the seasons? I think the vast majority of us will say yes. Q-14. Which of Willow's relationships is your favorite? I predict it will be Tara. Q-15. Which of Xander's relationships is your favorite? Clearly, this will be the Inca Mummy Girl. Or Anya. Q-16. Which relationship is your favorite? Is this the Giles/(Jenny or Joyce) question? I'm really not sure. Q-17. Who would your dream date be (from Buffy) and why? I'd guess it would be Spike. But there's a vocal Faith minority, I think. Q-19. Which episode is the scariest? Well, according to previous surveys, ""Hush"" seems to win this category by a landslide. Speaking as someone who is scared easily, though, ""Hush"" is definitely not the scariest. ""Conversations with Dead People"" and ""After Life"" are terrifying. The flash of the demon on the couch? The moment where Jonathan asks Andrew if he's sure where to go and the flashlight lights up the empty doorway where Warren is standing? I love this episode, but it gives me nightmares even after watching it over and over. After you've seen ""Hush"" for a few times, it's not that bad. tl;dr I predict ""Hush,"" unfortunately. Q-20. Which character do you think you are most like? I'd predict that Willow, Xander, and Tara get the most votes. Q-21. In """"Lie To Me"""", Ford is faced with a dilemma. Which option would you choose in his place? Not really sure about this one. I'll predict that more people will choose to die, but that a significant percentage of people would rather become a vampire. Q-22. Who is your favorite Big Bad? I predict the winner will be Glory, followed by Angelus and the Mayor. Q-23. What is your experience with the Buffy comics? I predict that most people have at least looked into them. I'd be surprised if more than 50% have read all of them, though. Q-24. What are your other (non-Buffy) favorite television shows? I'd guess that Angel is well-represented, as well as Firefly and (maybe) Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Probably Supernatural, Dexter, and all the other popular shows of the last few years (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc.). And Battlestar Galactica. Q-25. Why do you love the Buffyverse? I predict that a lot of answers will involve things like ""great characters"" and ""great stories."" Q-26. How many times have you watched through Buffy? I think there'll be clusters of this data. A minority who have watched it innumerable times, and most people watching it 2-4 times. Q-27. Which other Whedon creations have you seen? I have a feeling people here are pretty well versed in many Whedon creations. I think Angel and ""The Avengers"" will get the most votes, followed by ""Firefly"" and ""Dollhouse,"" followed by his other stuff (Dr. Horrible, Cabin in the Woods, etc.).   Looking forward to the results! :)"

buffy,2t3mz1,abernasty,15,Tue Jan 20 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"No, she didn't actually die there. She just pretended to be dead so the guy would stop keeping her head down. She tricked him. And she didn't ""reboot"" after being drowned in season 1. The CPR brought her back, the same way it brings back people without superpowers. It's likely she heals faster from physical damage caused by drowning, though, like oxygen deprivation of the brain."
buffy,2t3mz1,Beloit,3,Tue Jan 20 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's definitely the most reasonable alternative, just given the specific wording it cast some doubt for me."
buffy,2t3mz1,GinaZaneburritos,7,Tue Jan 20 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a death. Just a trick.  It's also the turning point in the episode. She kept resisting being like Faith up until that point, then she decides ""it didn't suck.""  Like a baptism, in a way. ""Drowning"" as a way to break with the past. Similar, in this way, to the drowning in season 1: that's also the turning point for her. Rather than being as she was before - scared and/or fighting her destiny or calling - she comes out stronger: ""oh look, a bad guy."""
buffy,2t3mz1,jayman419,3,Wed Jan 21 00:19:31 2015 UTC,"The point wasn't that she died and came back to life.. that was just her being quippy, as you already pointed out. She could have said ""try to drown me"" but it wouldn't have landed quite the same... she was talking tough for Faith.  It seems that's the real point of the scene... her being ""baptized"" into Faith's way of thinking."

buffy,2t2g9o,PawneePorpoise,2,Tue Jan 20 17:59:10 2015 UTC,Not so sure about Wesley or Lindsey (I've seen up to mid way season 2 Angel). Those two are things those who have seen only Buffy won't understand as being within the Buffyverse. I'd prefer a Wesley resembling how he dressed as a Watcher.
buffy,2t2g9o,stevebaescemi,2,Tue Jan 20 21:55:43 2015 UTC,We need a Xander from Chosen or the comics. That would be a more identifiable Xander figure too.

buffy,2t2g9o,clockworklycanthrope,1 point,Fri Jan 23 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"I think it was especially egregious for them not to release Xander and Giles with the original line. Those two were core Scoobies from the beginning! I love Oz, and the Gentleman was a cool idea, but surely both Giles and Xander would've made more sense. Anya and Tara would also be fantastic additions!  Like you, I'd love to see an Angel line! I'd especially like to see Gunn because he's the only main character from Angel who never got an action figure. J. August Richards expressed his disappointment about that, and it would be cool for the character to get a Pop Vinyl figure to make up for it. Lorne and Illyria would also be really great, and SO recognizable."

Unfortunately the one time it frequently worked was totally by accident and wasn't the media I would have chosen. I don't know if it was something about audiobooks in particular or just the fact that I listened to all four in a very short time but I had Twilight dreams to no end when I listened to the audiobooks lol

buffy,2t22a1,gottafanny,2,Tue Jan 20 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"I just had one! Probably because I've been rewatching it lately.  Unfortunately, I don't quite remember what it was about, except that I was Buffy and there was some evil that I had to battle. I think it involved protecting small children, and I was in an enclosed space of some kind, like a cave. Giles was trying to help, but his ideas were kind of weird and I didn't think they were that helpful. My focus was really not on him but on what I had to do.  That's about it. It had the feel almost of a real Buffy episode. People were trying to help, but it was all kind of tangential. It was my job and I had to do it.  Edit: As I read this over, it occurs to me that I've made it sound like the end of ""Band Candy."" It was not like ""Band Candy."" Giles was more like the Giles of season 5, telling me what sort of strength I needed and figuring out a way to give it to me. I really don't have a sense of the architecture of the enclosed space, but it wasn't some huge cavern; I was only aware of what was immediately around me. And the innocents weren't babies. In fact I think I was afraid that they would get in the way, too."

buffy,2t1jp2,leoavalon,5,Tue Jan 20 11:46:29 2015 UTC,"Here is my take on pivotal episodes for the first 3 seasons.  Season 1: Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel, Prophecy Girl  Season 2: When She Was Bad, School  Hard, Halloween, Lie To Me, The Dark Age, What's My Line 1 &amp;amp; 2, Surprise and Innocence, Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered, Passion, Becoming 1 & 2.  Season 3: Anne, Faith Hope and Trick, Homecoming, Band Candy, Revelations, Lovers Walk, The Wish, Amends, Helpless, The Zeppo, Bad Girls, Consequences, Doppelgangland, Enemies, The Prom, Graduation Day 1 & 2.  However, if he decides he enjoys watching Buffy, I'd try to show him the entire series. There are only a few mediocre episodes, but they usually still contain important elements or character development. Good luck, hopefully you'll bring him over to our side! :)  Edit: added the optional Xander episodes in italics. They really are excellent stand alone episodes. Awesome shenanigans ensue.  2nd edit: PS, let me know if you'd like this kind of list for the rest of the series! However, if your boyfriend likes the show, I'd just try to get him to watch all the remaining episodes. :) cuz it's brilliant, as we all know.   Final edit: sorry, realized I forgot to add Angel in season 1. That one is important, where we learn about Angel's mysterious past."

Do you remember the names of these episodes?"
buffy,2t1jp2,DoctorVenkman,2,Wed Jan 21 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Anya is introduced in The Wish, and Doppelgangland is when Anya tries to enlist Willow's magickal help to get her demonic amulet back resulting in the return of Vamp Willow. I definitely included those in the episode list. (I love those episodes!)  I want to include Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered (season 2) and The Zeppo (season 3) to the episode list, however they are not pivotal to the overall story arch even though they are such fun Xander episodes. It made me sad to leave them off. I think I'm going to edit the previous list I made and add those in italics as optional episodes to watch. Your boyfriend may enjoy them since they center on the 'everyman' issues that Xander faces being an ordinary guy living on the Hellmouth.  Good luck! Keep us posted! :)  Ps, sorry for all the edits! Reread your comment, thought I would add that the episode in which Xander tries to take revenge on Cordelia is Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered."

Actually, it took me a long time to even agree to watch it because I am such a wuss when it comes to horror, and the girl singing in the beginning gave me the creeps.  Funny, I thought ""Pangs"" was pretty stupid when I first saw it. ""It needs more condensed milk""? I love it now, but my first reaction was that it was super lame.  I also - to this day - don't like ""Earshot"" much. And ""Restless"" is one of those episodes that someone will either love right away or will find boring and weird.

She loves Twilight, so I'm hoping she'll enjoy season 2 especially. And, hopefully, the whole show.  At least your friend likes something about the show. :)"

It's the most emotional episode of the series. I starting watching the series with season one near the end of season five. I felt like Joyce was a one-dimensional character, which is hard to do in a universe filled with different dimensions. I did not like her one bit.  When Joyce would discipline Buffy, I would quip, ""You'll get yours lady!"" The best thing to happen to the show was Buffy coming out as the slayer to her mom. Now Joyce had something to deal with and could grow as a character.   By the time s5 ep16 rolled around I liked Joyce. Here's where I reveal that I buried the lead. My own mother had passed away the year before I got around to watching The Body. I had been in an emotional coma for most of that entire year. Watching The Body was the first time I cried about losing my mom."

buffy,2syq7a,hopesdead,10,Mon Jan 19 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple really. He was no longer a regular on the show. Tony wanted to step away from full time work on Buffy because he wanted to be in England with his family, particularly his young daughter.   And if you think about it.. He was in 8 episodes of season 6 and 13 of season 7. Always seemed perfectly reasonable to change him to a special guest star IMO, as he's not in the main cast any-more."
buffy,2syq7a,coolbeaNs92,3,Mon Jan 19 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"He stepped down as a main cast credited regular and appears in fewer episodes in season 6 and 7, because he wanted to spend more time with his family in the UK, I think. He's only in about 50% of the episodes of both seasons, and less prominent throughout."
buffy,2syq7a,patork,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"I might be misremembering, but I believe around season six he asked to be given recurring/guest star status so that he could move back to the UK to be with his family. Main cast credit is typically just the actors who are in every episode, and he wasn't in several episodes towards the end of the show. There are a lot of 'major' Buffy characters that don't get main cast credit, though- for example, Amber Benson was only listed once as main cast for Tara."
buffy,2syq7a,deets19,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it, it's because Head wanted to spend more time with his family in England. If actors are given main cast credit, due to union rules (I think? some kind of rule anyway) they must appear in nearly every episode. This is for example the reason in some season 3 episodes Oz only appears for a single scene -- it's because Seth Green had a main cast credit so he had to appear even if the story didn't call for it. By giving ASH a special guest star credit instead of main credit, he wasn't obligated to appear in every episode, and the creators were basically free to put Giles in when the story called for it and/or when ASH was available.   TV Tropes has some good explanations and examples of the phenomenon: Fake Guest Star and Mandatory Line."
buffy,2syq7a,Beloit,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:01:42 2015 UTC,Yeah as everyone has been saying he wanted to spend more time with his family in England. He even wrote a song on the topic called Babies [The In Between] on Music For Elevators.

buffy,2su2hn,eatapenny,4,Sun Jan 18 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"They definitely count! They continue the story, and were written with Joss's input. Trust me, they're worth reading, it's odd for a couple of issues, cause there's no sound, but Joss said that the comics let him implement ideas that would've been too expensive for TV. It's got the humor and themes of the show, with clever new storylines that help bring back the nostalgia in a good way."

buffy,2sx2bp,Chicken421,6,Mon Jan 19 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yes! I've always loved the relationship between Spike/Dru. Even though that line is half throwaway joke and half Spike snark, it really does capture something about the nature of the Spike/Dru.   Spike and Dru both understand each other in a way that no one else seems to (well, maybe Angelus to some extent). Dru knows that Spike is in love with the slayer, before Spike even knows it himself. Spike embraces Dru's craziness and loves her just the same.  So that line is such a perfect way to bring back Dru for a moment. It shows that while Spike is completely over Dru now, he still keeps that understanding of her."
buffy,2sx2bp,pagethree,3,Tue Jan 20 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"Haha yes! I can imagine spending 100 or so years with somebody creates a bond not so easily forgotten. To quote Spike in Lover's Walk, ""Our love is eternal. Literally!"""
buffy,2sx2bp,Chicken421,4,Tue Jan 20 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"One of the best Spike lines! Although there are a million best Spike lines because A) he gets the best lines B) James Marsters' delivery is top notch.  I wish Dru popped in and out a little bit more in later seasons. Of all the vampires, she probably has the most interesting combination of character traits (clairvoyance + insanity + pseudo-ingenuous + etc.). As hilarious as it is when Spike ties up Buffy and Dru, there could have been even more to wrap up between them."
buffy,2sx2bp,pagethree,2,Tue Jan 20 04:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. After I finished Buffy and was watching Angel, I was so happy when she popped in for a little while. More Drusilla is always wonderful. To touch back on the original topic, I also love in the scene when he ties them up when Spike tells Buffy ""I was going to kill Dru for you! DO YOU KNOW how much she means to me?"" Then of course Dru just laughs in his face. Oh Spike and his woes with the women :)"
buffy,2sx2bp,Chicken421,2,Tue Jan 20 05:13:06 2015 UTC,"I always understood that to mean that he gets that it's not Drusilla, it's just a vision of her.  Because if you look closely at the First here, she really isn't like Drusilla. She really is less crazy than the real Drusilla. I always loved this line too, because the First is playing with him and his love for Drusilla, and he calls her out on it."
buffy,2sx2bp,coolbeaNs92,10,Sat Jan 24 05:19:55 2015 UTC,"Full list of the characters here if you maybe forgot a few..  Buffy Summers  Jenny Calendar  Warren Mears  Drusilla  Spike  Glory  The Mayor  The Master  Caleb  Jonathan Levinson  Adam  Joyce Summers  Daniel  Travis  Margaret  Cassie Newton  Nikki Wood  Betty  Chloe  Eve    I think Sarah did an amazing job of playing The First. She's a really dynamic actor and can really portray very manipulative, cruel characters when in that role (look at for Cruel Intentions for this type of acting). No real surprise there she did an amazing job.   But my favourite actor to play The First has to be Robia LaMorte (Jenny) IMO. She really sold that kind of innocent/manipulate part of The First which was pretty awesome to watch. Surprising as well, seeing as though she hasn't been in that much television."
buffy,2sx2bp,Livesinthefuture,5,Mon Jan 19 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yes definitely, it was a real shame that she turned down the role due to religious reasons."

buffy,2sx2bp,Chris_Pink_Floyd,3,Tue Jan 20 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"Robia LaMorte is extremely active in a Christian ministry. She, understandably, felt that it was both hypocritical and inappropriate to portray the 'ultimate evil' on T.V. while devoting her life to her faith."
buffy,2sx2bp,yallcat,3,Tue Jan 20 01:24:39 2015 UTC,She had already played the same character once... Is the Christianity new?
buffy,2sx2bp,Chris_Pink_Floyd,3,Tue Jan 20 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"People change and grow. She said in an interview on Daystar T.V. that she came into her faith about 3 months into her original tenure on the show and eventually realized that she wanted her personal and professional lives to align. So, when they ended her character she focused on her faith.   Actors, if they're doing a decent job, have to embrace their roles as much as possible. The first was essentially, Satan...who biblically, was the first evil. She came back and gave it a go, but did not enjoy the experience."
buffy,2sx2bp,Kaleighawesome,2,Tue Jan 20 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"No, thanks for the elaboration though! I thought I'd included most of what everyone would say, without explicitly trying to steer everyone in one direction or another, and I'm a little gratified that everyone seems to agree :)  I love SMG (as the First and in general), but despite what Robia LaMorte said about the First not being her best performance, I think the First in the guise of Jenny Calendar is pretty much perfect."
buffy,2sx2bp,yallcat,7,Sat Jan 24 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"Sarah was amazing because she was already in practically every scene but whenever she portrayed the First you knew it wasn't Buffy.  I actually thought the actor who played Jonathan was amazing too, he really captured the darkness."

He would not have kept Dru around for 38 years if he didn’t find it soothing.   “3. He dances like this.”   He was imagining that.   “4. Sometimes he turns into the cruelest creature in history. But only if you have good sex first.”   He did not lose his soul merely because of “good sex”, and yes he does.   “6. This isn’t even a good joke.”   Yes, it is.   “7. This is literally all you need to know about him.”   That is an even funnier joke, and well delivered. :P   “14. Wait a second. There’s a demon inside him.”   There is not a demon inside him. He is one.   “15. No matter what, he’ll only care about Buffy.”   That doesn't even make sense. He cares about Buffy, Darla, Cordelia and others. A point could be made that he has a problem with out of sight, out of mind. Acting most interested in whomever is there at that moment.   “19. One time, he hit the woman he loves.”   Buffy is not a Faberge egg and she hit him first. She is the Slayer who is stronger than a vampire and Angel points that out. Buffy had no right to strike him like that. It’s considered wrong for a man to hit a woman because of the size and strength difference. Buffy is the stronger one so just because she is female this should not be excused.   ""20. Pushing, pushing…""   Yes, it was wrong of him to push for a relationship with someone who he was supposed to be mentoring.

Bonus: Spike gets out of his wheelchair, a moment that is truly awesome. A lot of scenes in season 2, actually. All of ""Passion,"" but especially the end, when Giles attacks Angel, then Buffy attacks Angel, then Buffy drags Giles outside. And he pushes her away, telling her it wasn't her battle, and she punches him, and then they're both crying and she tells him that she can't lose him.  I really like the long takes that occur in a few Joss Whedon-directed episodes. My favorite is the one in ""Graduation, Part 2,"" beginning with Angel rushing into the hospital carrying Buffy and ending when Angel stops the Mayor from strangling unconscious Buffy. It's over a minute long, and it's great. The end of ""Lessons,"" where the First takes on all the forms of the earlier Big Bads while talking to Spike in the basement, gives me chills. ""Once More, with Feeling"" is guaranteed to make me feel better if I'm down. The scene in ""Touched"" where Buffy saves the Potentials and kills the Ubervamps with the scythe is my wife's favorite scene. It is pretty cool. And if you skip to it from watching earlier seasons, it's eerie how much older Buffy looks. It's like you can see how much she's been through.   I love the later seasons, but a lot of those episodes are hard to watch, just because of all the ""feels."" So I can't really say that I watch any particular scene over and over.  Edit: I forgot about the last scene of ""Intervention"": when Buffy goes to Spike, pretending to be the Buffy-Bot, learns that Spike did not betray her and Dawn, and kisses him.

The one where Buffy tells Giles to lie to her and he tells her that everything is terribly simple and the good guys always win. So. Many. Feels.  All of The Body but mostly the beginning up to where Buffy refers to it as 'the body' to Giles and then the scene in Willow's dorm.   Xander's speech to Dawn at the end of the episode Potential where he tells Dawn that he sees things the others don't because nobody's watching him and he knows how hard it is to be the ""normal one"". IMO that is Xander's absolutely finest moment and the moment I think of to remind me that Xander means well whenever his chauvinistic side comes out."
buffy,2suwkg,GinaZaneburritos,2,Tue Jan 20 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree about Buffy's speech in ""Prophecy Girl."" I was surprised to learn the last time I watched it (a few days ago) that I had it memorized, because I've never really liked season 1.  Another great Xander moment is when he gives Buffy back her confidence in ""The Freshman."" Willow, Giles, her mom - every one else let her down, but he's the one who's there for her. It's little, but it means a lot.  Moments like these are what I think about when I'm on the verge of really hating Xander :)"

buffy,2suwkg,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:59:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that article was really interesting!  I like Xander because I think, deep down, he really is a good guy. He's very real in that he's not white-washed at all. He's arrogant, he's insensitive, he's selfish, he's inappropriate, he's immature ... but he's also loyal, brave, and tries hard. The show doesn't flinch away from showing us all his bad qualities, but it shows his good side too.  I also like his speech to Dawn. It's kind of ruined for me, though, because of the line in ""Selfless"" where Anya says to him, ""you've always seen what you wanted to."" Then they decide, a few episodes later, to focus on what he does see from the sidelines and how that's his strength. It's always bothered me."

I rewatch that episode all the time, because it's one of the only things in the world that can consistently make me bawl like a baby. Every moment of it is so perfect, from the disjointed opening scene where Buffy goes from happy, to panicked, to broken and blank to a complete emotional wreck, and all the way through to the end. Willow's wardrobe breakdown over what she should wear because she doesn't want to be disrespectful is a tear-jerker, but Anya's speech makes me lose it the most every time. It touches on all the tiny little things that we take for granted in life, and makes you realize that when someone is gone, they will never do those things again. Generally it's just an emotionally devastating episode.  Of course, that's the easy answer, I suppose, but it's true."

Everything from the M'Fashnik demon breaking the lamp and saying, ""You have cost me, slayer!"" to Buffy's ""full - copper - repipe! No - more - FULL - COPPER -  REPIPE!""  That whole scene is absolutely hilarious. The mummy hand scene from ""Life Serial"" is pretty funny too.   Edit: another honorable mention to the scene in ""Him"" where Spike tackles Buffy as she aims a rocket launcher at Principal Wood's office.  Edit #2: Also in ""Life Serial,"" when Buffy kicks Jonathan (glamoured as a demon) and he says, ""I am well struck! I call on the misty portal to my demon dimension where I'll lay my head and gently die."" And he ""disappears"" in a cloud of smoke, and you see James Marsters cracking up as they wave away the smoke and look puzzled/worried.  :)  Edit #3: Apparently I have a lot of favorite funny scenes, sorry! :) The intense emotional scene between Buffy and Angel that Xander interrupts in ""The Zeppo"" is awfully funny. ""Don't do that! You may be ready to go, but I am not ready to lose you!"" It's an entire Buffy-Angel tortured argument, complete with music and mostly irrelevant to the main story.

buffy,2stdox,buffylove,15,Sun Jan 18 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I feel like Anya's death was foreshadowed far in advance. If you look at her character development, she begins her human life as selfish and self-absorbed (""when I get my powers back you will all kneel before me""). Despite her burgeoning feelings for Xander, she thinks that, when facing an apocalyptic event like the Mayor's ascension, ""the only sane thing any person can do now is run.""  As the series progresses, she becomes more human and appreciative of the greater good and the importance of the (possibly hopeless) fight against evil. I always felt like if the show had ended with the finale of season 5, Anya would have died in ""The Gift."" Not until the very last scene is it clear that she lives through that fight.  But she does live, and in the face of real pain when Xander leaves her, she turns back to her demon roots. In ""Selfless,"" though, she chooses to sacrifice herself in the place of the human frat boys. D'Hoffryn lets her live, but only because her sacrifice would have been - in a way - still selfish. Death would have ended her pain and given her an easy redemption. At the end of ""Selfless,"" she says she doesn't even know who she is or why she's held on to the things she has.   Humanity means taking a stand against evil, facing it courageously and with fortitude, because it's right, even if it seems the ""insane"" thing to do. Anya does this in the finale, coming full circle from where she was in season 3. It's a fitting character arc for an ex-demon."
buffy,2stdox,GinaZaneburritos,13,Sun Jan 18 13:40:31 2015 UTC,What kind of person doesn't love the ending to Buffy? It's the best ending to any show ever.
buffy,2stdox,ohnopigs,4,Sun Jan 18 10:05:31 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this, I believe Anya's death was absolutely a gift, as part of begin human.  In a nod from many, many decent vampire stories, immortality carries a price.  Eventually, you start to realize that nothing matters, because your existence will always outlast anything as it fades into history.  But there is power in death because it makes your actions matter.  And not only to you, but to those around you.  I think that--while sad--this was also very beautiful, because it means Anya had finally achieved the goal of becoming a human being.  Her actions matter, if only to her, which was not something she could really say before."
buffy,2stdox,MalevolentDragon,1 point,Sun Jan 18 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"Is this - the idea that immortality is a burden and a hollow existence - really a theme in Buffy, though?  We see lots of immortal beings, and they all still have a zest for life. Spike is ""only"" 126, as he says in season 4. Angel had been alive for hundreds of years before he met Buffy, and when the First tempts him with visions of peace, it comes in the form of being bad again. His desire to commit suicide is based on his belief that ""he's not strong enough,"" not because he's had enough.  When Anya becomes human, she's been alive for 1120 years, and the thought of death isn't comforting to her, it's terrifying.  The only character that could be seen to have a ""death wish"" is Buffy, and she's hardly an immortal being; in fact, as a slayer, she has an abbreviated life span.  I agree that death can be seen as meaningful, and a meaningful death - and life - is a gift, but it's mostly a sacrifice. I think Anya would have wanted to live. What's important is what you do in life, even if it results in death. As I see it, that's what she learns."
buffy,2stdox,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Jan 19 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"I did not mean to be so macabre; I was not trying to imply that Anya sought death, and more that the ability to die (and therefore the fight against it) carries more gravitas than an eternal existence without.  I absolutely agree that the fight to live is pervasive (Buffy's own words in The Gift: ""Be brave.  Live."") and Anya's death is a sacrifice.  I just think that it's also a beautiful way to show that she was truly human, in her final moments."

It was the scyth that made it possible since it was forced especially for the slayer, powerful and deadly. The scyth wasn't possible to get out of the rock - until Buffy showed up.

""Uh oh, two episodes left and we have an impossible to kill thing, what do? Oh let's bring in this axe that has never ever been mentioned before and make it super important!"" Caleb. Again, it's like he was written in just so Joss Whedon could put Nathon Fillion in the show. He was only in a few episodes, and went from being the invincible pseudo corporeal form of the First to being cut in half in two seconds flat. He's introduced as supossedly the most powerful minion and right hand man to the First, going so far as to merge with the First, but isn't introduced until the end of the season. Where was he before? Hiding? Buffy was nearly killed by him. He was as strong if not stronger than Glory was. He could have easily killed Buffy long before she even thought to look in the wine place. More annoyingly, his character depth was nothing more than a personification of misogyny. Is a little bit of character depth too much to ask for?  Angel shows up for five seconds, hands Buffy yet another deus ex machina device, then leaves. Maybe it was explained in Angel but I shouldn't have to watch a different show just to know what's going on in this one.  Buffy's slayer induction speech was the most cringe worthy piece of writing in the entire show. Actually, almost every speech she had in this season was cringey. The word ""slayer"" was as overused as the phrase ""Dark passenger"" was in Dexter.  The first uber vamp took forever to kill, but in the end thousands could be slain by barely trained just activated slayers who not a day before were practically wetting themselves at the thought of fighting.    Overall I feel like season 5's ending was a better series finale than season 7. It had that nice closure feeling to it and Glory was a much better big bad than The First and was more complex a character than Caleb was. Hell, with a bit of rewriting season 6 could have been made into one hell of a series finale."
buffy,2stdox,meaghan614,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:40:31 2015 UTC,"I was very distraught while reading this comment. A lot of gasps happened, followed closely by some ""wrong!"" and ""are you kidding me?!"" ...and I think I reacted that way because deep down you are right. This is probably why you didn't really get responses either. my hard buffy fan in me wants to think joss does no wrong and that every season is perfect in its own way. but I can see where you are coming from and when watching it over and over (not just as season 7, but as the whole series) it can seem rushed and cheap.   on another note. I loathed the way Dexter ended. loathed."
buffy,2stdox,DomLite,2,Wed Jan 28 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewheres about the internet that Joss wanted to kill off a core character in the finale without a big payoff, like a lot of the Potentials, just to emphasize what a huge deal this final battle was. It was the grand finale, and lots of lives were going to be lost, but he didn't want them all to just be throwaway characters that had only just shown up that season, but he also didn't have time for a big drawn out mourning scene for someone. Emma Caulfield had expressed that she really wasn't interested in returning for anymore Buffy related stuff (I can assume that it wasn't for lack of love for the project, but she probably had other prospects as well), so it was a perfect fit for Joss.  Anya was a core character by this point, but she wasn't one that had been around for as long as say Willow, Xander or Giles. It fit Anya's character arc to go from an immortal demon with no regard or understanding of being human anymore to a mortal being who is willing to stand up and fight for what's right, even if it doesn't really ""make sense"" to do such a silly, selfless thing. She laid down her life to help save the world, and that's a huge thing."
buffy,2stdox,jatie,2,Tue Jan 27 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"""Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain.""  I believe in Anya's case she was the pain, for Xander and everyone else because she could have just as easily lived, and she died for someone like Andrew! Ugh! Did Emma really ask to be killed off? Wouldn't have minded seeing her in Angel."
buffy,2stdox,DaddyCatALSO,0,Sun Jan 18 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the finale (problem was I'd already killed off Faith in my main ficverse to continue the Slayer line.)  They didn't have the ax before, the guardians had it. and they didn't have a Willow before. Anya had to die like Larry at the end of s-3. An apocalyptic battle has to result ina popular character's dying to underline the cost. at elats for joss, and many other writers"

buffy,2sr2i4,urbanflowerpot,26,Sat Jan 17 18:30:18 2015 UTC,I remember seasons one and two had some especially cold days.

buffy,2sr2i4,sambalam29,9,Sat Jan 17 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the shear shirts were the bra was clearly visible underneath. Some of the costume choices seemed clearly limited by the budget (for being either very new, or only one season old)."
buffy,2sr2i4,sambalam29,9,Sat Jan 17 23:13:12 2015 UTC,"Oh how could I forget the sheer shirts haha. But don't forget, the late 90s was a weird time for fashion with or without budget constraints."
buffy,2sr2i4,ayriana,4,Sat Jan 17 23:40:35 2015 UTC,I've been watching Friends lately and there are a few fashion choices that were incredibly out there.
buffy,2sr2i4,soyrobo,3,Sun Jan 18 05:12:27 2015 UTC,I was 6 when the show first aired (too young to watch till last year). I was wearing overalls long before Alyson Hannigan made it look cute. Anyhow I agree that the fashion of the 90s was weird.
buffy,2sr2i4,feioo,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"That's what I was going to say. In the late '90s, showing bra strap was as fashionable as sundresses with combat boots. It was indeed a weird, and extreme, time."
buffy,2sr2i4,osburnn,3,Sun Jan 18 09:02:37 2015 UTC,I still think sundresses with combat boots are cute.
buffy,2sr2i4,faaackksake,3,Sun Jan 18 20:33:24 2015 UTC,Is it really that obvious when a girl is or isn't wearing a bra?
buffy,2sr2i4,osburnn,3,Sun Jan 18 00:46:11 2015 UTC,Well in season 2's The Dark Age when Ethan enters the library you can see a camera change from him to Buffy. For that split second Buffy adjust her blouse to cover the straps. A acting direction or SMG getting bothered?  In that instance it was obvious to me because I saw both her thumbs move in a deliberate motion.
buffy,2sr2i4,fff8e7cosmic,2,Sun Jan 18 00:56:26 2015 UTC,...yes

buffy,2sr2i4,Beloit,5,Sat Jan 17 21:37:15 2015 UTC,I even remember an interview in which Sarah said she heard about a Buffy drinking game. People had to take a shot whenever Buffy's bra strap showed. And that made Sarah choose to wear more strapless bras.
buffy,2sr2i4,FLAFH,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read about that drinking game, too. I didn't know it made SMG change her bras, though."
buffy,2sr2i4,luky_starz,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:06:42 2015 UTC,Maybe that was how she got away with looking naked in Where the Wild Things Are (season 4 episode 18).
buffy,2sr2i4,DaddyCatALSO,4,Sun Jan 18 01:09:26 2015 UTC,I was wondering if the outfit was based on a actual episode but nothing has shown up in a Rewatch so far.
buffy,2sr2i4,Becccccca,3,Sat Jan 17 18:16:45 2015 UTC,I can't really remember an episode this specific outfit appears in off the top of my head either. I think it may just be based on her general season 1 look.
buffy,2sr2i4,BreckensMama,3,Sat Jan 17 18:30:31 2015 UTC,I would have to agree that is is based on the style from season one.
buffy,2sr2i4,gypsiequeen,18,Sat Jan 17 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"I have noticed a strap before, it's even part of a drinking game apparently  (thanks Google!)"

buffy,2sr2i4,kahrismatic,5,Sat Jan 17 19:04:38 2015 UTC,Buffy would Stick It
buffy,2sr2i4,surrenderthenight,6,Sat Jan 17 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"Sarah mentioned in an interview a long time ago that all the training over the years caused her to lose weight and to go down in bra sizes.  She said that in the first couple of seasons she refused to go bra-less, so she frequently had bra straps showing.  Later on she was more comfortable going bra-less because her chest had shrunk.  So the figure is pretty damn accurate."
buffy,2sr2i4,kahrismatic,1 point,Sun Jan 18 06:15:40 2015 UTC,Well that is the best answer so far.
buffy,2ssx9n,Gandalverine,4,Sun Jan 18 04:35:28 2015 UTC,"My idea of why Angel can't do CPR is that, ina magickal universe, the supernatural force crosses over somewhat into the way the natural world works. )Logically, t here's no way it can't.)  So, a vampire is a dead thing, ultimately. And, in a universe where magick exists, a dead thing can't restore life in such a direct way; it would be guaranteed to fail, somehow."
buffy,2ssx9n,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sun Jan 18 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"Are vampires actually dead things or were they thought of that way in past centuries due to ignorance of the transformation process? They often would rise out of graves after seeming to have “died” because they showed signs of clinical death (no longer breathing and their heart had stopped beating).   They can bleed so they have some sort of circulation that does not use the heart.  Breathe, although it’s no longer an automatic body process.  Heal  Engage in sexual relations   Feel all the pain and pleasure a normal human can.  Grow hair   Metabolize alcohol, nicotine and illegal drugs (Angel in ATS).  They can digest food though they don’t require it to live.  They have brain activity as confirmed by Fred in Ats s5.  Illyria referred to them as hybrids, a human who has been infected with the blood of a pure vampiric demon who then becomes a mix of the two."
buffy,2ssx9n,AngelAmongUs,2,Sun Jan 18 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Anya also refers to them as hybrids when she's talking about the Mayor's ascension.  If they're not dead, though, then I wouldn't think that the First would be able to take the form of vampires like Spike and Drusilla and the Master."
buffy,2ssx9n,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Jan 19 07:23:59 2015 UTC,That's not to say that at some point in the process they don’t clinically die for a few seconds or minutes. Buffy’s “death” in Prophecy Girl was enough for a slayer to be activated and counted as a death even though she was able to be easily revived without professional medical intervention.
buffy,2ssx9n,AngelAmongUs,2,Mon Jan 19 07:41:52 2015 UTC,Good point. :)
buffy,2ssx9n,GinaZaneburritos,2,Mon Jan 19 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"Basically, joss threw out a neat sounding line and we fans have been knocking ourselves out over it ever since. Like ""The Gift"" and when the blood stops flowing."""
buffy,2ssx9n,DaddyCatALSO,6,Fri Jan 23 01:38:19 2015 UTC,could have been loss of blood flow to the brain that knocked out dru.
buffy,2ssx9n,thebeardednurse,4,Sun Jan 18 04:49:21 2015 UTC,"And yet, as Harmony says to Spike in season 4: vampires don't have a pulse. Their hearts don't beat; ergo, no blood flow.  I'm pretty sure this is a mistake.  Edit: I mean, it's a mistake in the sense that there's no reason you should be able to choke a vampire into unconsciousness given what we're told about vampires. However, there's lots of stuff vampires shouldn't be able to do that they obviously can. They're obviously animated somehow. So, sure, maybe they can act like humans enough to become unconscious when you apply a choke hold to their neck. Why not? But this moment with Spike and Dru always makes me roll my eyes, too."
buffy,2ssx9n,GinaZaneburritos,6,Sun Jan 18 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"they do have blood flow because they can bleed and also have sex.  its a magic blood flow, cant be explained by science"
buffy,2ssx9n,wxlves,6,Sun Jan 18 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, magic blood flow,  I should have known"
buffy,2ssx9n,GinaZaneburritos,2,Sun Jan 18 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"In ""Pangs"" Spike complains that Buffy's cutting off his circulation, and she replies, ""You don't have any circulation."" He replies, ""Well, it pinches.""  So ... I would think this means their blood flow, whatever it is, can't be cut off in any way. In any case, none of this is well explained on the show, so whether it's a mistake or not is open to interpretation."
buffy,2ssx9n,Tshuggah42,5,Sun Jan 18 16:36:21 2015 UTC,and how do they get boners without blood flow Ive always wondered.

buffy,2ssx9n,AngelAmongUs,3,Sun Jan 18 17:19:36 2015 UTC,This always bothered me too. Like Angel is always out of breath after a good fight. Except he has no breath... I notice little things like that and have to remind myself that I'm there for the story.
buffy,2ssx9n,DaddyCatALSO,2,Sun Jan 18 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a mistake. Spike was not cutting off her air supply.  While he might have a general idea of what CPR is, I doubt Angel has had any experience actually giving CPR and would be unsure of its effectiveness coming from him."
buffy,2ssx9n,Eiyran,2,Sun Jan 18 14:36:47 2015 UTC,good idea but I have another answer as well.
buffy,2ssh31,jatie,31,Sun Jan 18 01:46:16 2015 UTC,I absolutely love Ethan Rayne. Every episode of his is hilarious especially Band Candy when Giles gets so excited at Buffy punching him.
buffy,2ssh31,Chicken421,9,Sun Jan 18 05:49:37 2015 UTC,Ethan was a great minor character.
buffy,2ssh31,BrittBrat893,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:59:45 2015 UTC,"Ethan was awesome, and I was always sad he never had a bigger part in things than 'minor league shit-disturber'."

Fun fact: It's pretty cool that her birth name was Joan and then took on Buffy's middle name, Anne. Then in ""Tabula Rasa"" Buffy picks her name as Joan."
buffy,2ssh31,trainingthemind,4,Sun Jan 18 07:02:35 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was funny that she has Rickie tattoo ""Lily"" on his arm, and in that same episode when Buffy asks her about her new name, she's like, ""yeah, it's fine, for now.""  For now?? Nice of you to let him know you're a serial name-changer before he gets a tattoo of your fine-for-now name.  That ""Joan"" was her first name, that's never mentioned in the show, right?

I found potential slayer Amanda endearing (or at least much more so than the other potentials), but that might be residual from Freaks and Geeks.  I didn't much care for Kendra, the Anointed, or Scott Hope, but I suppose that's not controversial!  I actually enjoyed Kathy in a love-to-hate kind of way, but Veruca I just hate-hate."

The thing about ""minor"" characters in Buffy is that they frequently become more major (like Jonathan, Harmony, and Amy). It's hard to know where to draw the line.  I think Glory's minions are hilarious. I also kind of like Giles's girlfriend Olivia. Halfrek of course, and D'Hoffryn. I like the Watchers Council, Quentin Travers and the others (""I wrote my thesis on you"").  I never was much of a fan of Mr. Trick (if he counts). I despise Jenny Calendar's gypsy uncle.

I also liked: - Amanda, the awkward Potential Slayer. - Harmony - Amy, if she can be considered ""minor"" - Principal Snyder, especially in ""Band Candy"" - Jonathan - I loved how he was the ""token nerd"" until Season 6 when he took center stage. Before that, I imagined he was Joss Whedon when Joss was in high school. - Doc, because who does creepy better than Joel Grey? - Wesley-Wyndham Price. Even before he became a real character in ""Angel"" he had a sweetness to his ineptitude, plus his Pierce Brosnan-y good looks, that were so endearing. - Sweet! - Buffy's second manager at the Doublemeat Palace. Yes, she was a lifer, but she was kind and practical and quirky. - Holden, from ""Conversations with Dead People""  Characters I would have liked more development from: - The first Slayer - Olivia - Nicki Wood"
buffy,2ssh31,TheBlueDanNoob,5,Tue Jan 20 02:44:52 2015 UTC,I think Joss Whedon has said he modeled the character of Xander after himself in high school.  Jane Espenson is the writer who loves Jonathan :)

If you pay attention to what he says, it's so obvious (at least on a rewatch) that everything he says is a line. And when Buffy goes ""off script"" (like saying ""also a valid lifestyle choice"") he looks blank and confused for a second, then just soldiers on with his next ""line.""  I also love that rather than finishing the Parker storyline with ""Harsh Light of Day,"" they have Willow confront him and explain exactly what's wrong with him. I feel like most shows wouldn't take that extra step, and ""Beer Bad"" is a really great conclusion to his saga."

I don't even want to call T&D horror but I also don't want to give anything away. I've seen them 3 times each and I think it's time for another go. One more suggestion on horror movies for people who don't like horror: Pontypool. I've also watched that 3 times and I find it, and Stephen McHattie (and his voice) fascinating. You don't see much, it's mostly dialogue and your imagination, the premise is extremely weird, but nagged at me for days after seeing it. These 3 stand out as the only scary movies I've enjoyed since The Others and The Gift fifteen years ago.   Back on topic, the reaver was in a scene where it's in a room with a lady who shoots herself in the head to escape it. I didn't catch it at all the first or second time."

You remember after the failed Adam experiment we get that outro scene where the government bigwig says to basically shut the initiative down, burn it to the ground and fill it with concrete. Well we see Buffy and Spike return to the initiative in season 7 and it is neither burned down nor filled with concrete.

buffy,2sodhz,TheDeadManWalks,6,Sat Jan 17 02:43:04 2015 UTC,I like this theory so I choose to believe it. It is now head-canon.
buffy,2sodhz,MoonSpider,4,Sat Jan 17 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"I've always been aware of this line of thinking (and preach it to anyone who will listen) but with a few additions/modifications:    The Slayer line is inherently linked with the Earth, therefore no new Slayer may be activated, as most supernatural forces were drawn from/linked to the planet itself. Since evil is inherent throughout all time and will always exist in one form or another, the Reavers are created by the Alliance (the twisted cousin of the Initiative, sophisticated evil), although unintentionally, sparking a new form of vampire, similar to the Turok-Han (ravenous humanoids, formerly normal humans, chaotic evil). Since they have created this force that they cannot control, the special division, much like the Shadow Men, create a slayer from a psychic. River is a perfect conduit as she is already magically inclined.    I'm kicking myself for never posting my theory anywhere. :(  Edit: I also believe Melaka Fray is somewhere around the time of Cabin in the Woods, although in a less isolated/normalized part of the world after Angel Season 5. I think Cabin in the Woods occurs in a small part of the US that has been blocked off as well as possible from the chaos of hell on Earth."
buffy,2sodhz,autowikibot,0,Sat Jan 17 05:15:25 2015 UTC,"Fray's story takes place in the 23rd century, and I think Cabin in the Woods is supposed to be contemporary 21st century.   I think these theories are fun, but they never account for Fray and it is an important part of the canon."

buffy,2sodhz,ClunkingBuckets,2,Sat Jan 17 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"What about this:  Maybe the Potentials weren't called? Maybe Buffy didn't come back in season six, therefore changing the future. This could mean that the First was less of a threat, or found some other exploit to enter the world. Perhaps WR&H took different means to unleash hell in this future, allowing the Initiative to try to hold them back by the means of Cabin in the Woods?  This could compensate for the issues of Melaka Fray (since she may not exist in this alternate future), and why the Initiative would rely so heavily on sacrifices, as opposed to simply enlisting Slayers. We could go further and say that Faith does become Caroline from Dollhouse in some effort to Fight the Good Fight but ultimately does not succeed in helping save Earth from the Old Ones.  Furthermore, River could be this timeline's compensation for not only the lack of a Slayer, but the lack of Melaka Fray."

buffy,2spxc8,GinaZaneburritos,7,Sun Jan 18 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's a good question. I don't remember them ever exactly explaining it.  Well, we see him mostly at the library, and even though it's school property, it's not really used for school. I mean, they do slayer training there, they use the book cage to house Oz and random other creatures they need to contain (Philip/Eyghon and vampire Willow), and there are lots of occult books. They make jokes about it (Jonathan coming in to get books on Stalin, MOO confiscating all the books) but aside from the power play that Snyder tries to pull in banning Buffy from the school, I have a feeling there's a collective understanding at some point that the high school library is different and normal rules don't apply. I think people realize Giles is different too, but he's an adult so they don't really bother trying to rein him in, whereas Buffy is a student and has to deal with a fair amount of order-taking.  He's also walking around the school in ""Dopplegangland"" so he can save Cordelia from vamp Willow, but that looks like it's after-hours, where all kinds of people walk around.  And, as you point out, he's at the prom.  My best guess is that people assume he's a friend of Giles. Either work-related or personal. Clearly he doesn't have a good cover story, but it's a testament to how weird Sunnydale is that it never really comes up."
buffy,2spxc8,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sun Jan 18 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm glad I'm not crazy. I realize that people don't regard the library as a standard book blockbuster but I never caught any ""this is why this guy should be there"" type of thing.

buffy,2skjm6,Krescan,19,Sun Jan 18 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, story time:    So, today I had a dentist appointment, and I parked at a nearby shopping center beforehand. When I got finished with my appointment (no cavities, woo!) I still had, like, an hour and a half left on my parking validation. I went wandering around the stores there for a bit, window shopping and laughing at some of the silly things they had on display.  At one point I stopped to take a picture (this picture, in fact), when just to my left I heard a voice speaking to one of the sales reps. It was THE voice.  That peppy voice and cadence that had worn a groove into my brain after hundreds of hours of watching and listening to various bouts of adventure and heartbreak in Sunnydale. That one voice that you can immediately recognize.     It was Sarah Michelle Gellar. The Slayer herself.   Well, Sarah Michelle Prinze, actually.  I reminded myself of that distinction while I took a few moments to attempt to process the fact that Buffy Summers was hanging around in my vicinity, buying furniture or rugs or whatever.  It wasn't really processable.   She moved away from the counter and started walking in my direction. I looked up at her, she smiled, so I said: ""Mrs. Prinze?"" ""Yes?"" ""Wow! I didn't know if it was actually you. I'm a huge fan of your work!"" ""Thank you, that's so sweet!"" ""Sorry for intruding during your shopping!"" ""Don't worry about it, you're fine!""        ...I realized at that point that she had been walking in my direction because the salesperson had asked her to meet an associate in another section of the store, so I got out of her way so she could go about her business unimpeded.    I sat down on a display chair, thusly, and a short while later she came back to my side of the store to finalize her purchase and check out.  She smiled at me again (good gracious) and headed out with her friends who had been waiting.  I didn't ask for a photo or anything, (because Lord knows these folks get enough pictures taken of them as it is, and I didn't want to bother her or take up her time) but here's a dramatic reenactment using stock photos of us standing with crossed arms in front of contrasting backgrounds, if it helps set the scene.  I feel grand about the encounter overall, but I wish I'd thought of something better to say that might explain how much the show meant to me and how much comfort it gave me in dark times.  But I suppose the short interaction was for the best. Still kind of reeling from it!"

buffy,2smwzb,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:17:10 2015 UTC,My blu ray players and computer all play them in the original 4:3 format with the black bars. I just find it very surprising that it seems as though I ended up with two defective sets.
buffy,2smwzb,coolbeaNs92,2,Fri Jan 16 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Mm. I highly doubt it's both of the sets, that would be one hell of a coincidence. Are there any common factors such as using the same HDMI cable or anything? Could be an up scaling problem, but I really doubt that either to be honest.   It also kind of depends on how much choppiness there is. As in, is there actually a problem or are you just good at noticing it. I mean, season 3 was shot around 18 years ago. Are you sure you're not just seeing something that was shot with cameras almost 20 years ago, If you get what I'm saying?   But if you want, take a video of the problems you're seeing and I can compare. Or if you have a Netflix account, watch the episode on there, although I don't know if they're still showing season 4 onwards in 16:9 :/"

buffy,2sm0yb,gothamite27,17,Fri Jan 16 08:27:23 2015 UTC,The line had already continued through Kendra and Faith. The only way for another Slayer to be called would be if Faith died.
buffy,2sm0yb,GinaZaneburritos,3,Fri Jan 16 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"I agree that that's pretty much the only way it makes sense. It kind of bothers me, though, that throughout the entire show everyone seems to assume the opposite: e.g., the Mayor tells Angel to make Buffy's death ""slow"" because ""we don't want another slayer messing things up."" I understand that no one really knows what would happen if Buffy died since two slayers had never been active at the same time before, but I'd feel better about this response if they actually mentioned it in the show somewhere (maybe they did and I just don't remember?).  Otherwise, for all we know, there is another slayer called after Buffy's death, and we just haven't heard about her. Because she may or may not exist.  I could see Buffy writers making this a storyline sometime in the future, all about the brief time where there was a third slayer before there were hundreds. Or maybe not. I don't really know. I think it's amusing that Faith, by this logic, is the ""real"" slayer, the descendent of the line, but she's the one everyone seems to have been happy to keep in prison and forget about.  As a side note, I used to think it was bizarre that this truly had never happened before (a slayer ""dying"" for a few minutes before being revived). Even considering the fact that medical science hadn't reached that point until modern times, that's still potentially hundreds of slayers this could have happened to before (assuming most slayers only live a few months to a few years).  Then it occurred to me that the reason Buffy is alive is because she was fighting alongside others. Most slayers would not be around humans when they get killed, or at least would not have anyone around to rush to their aid like Xander did for Buffy. So I think it's another example of how Buffy is different because of her connection to other people."
buffy,2sm0yb,GinaZaneburritos,3,Sat Jan 17 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was any ambiguity about the process and if characters got it wrong in the show it was because they weren't fully versed on Slayer lore.   When Buffy died in Prophecy Girl she lost her place in the Slayer line and the baton was passed to another (Kendra). She was revived and became an offshoot of the Slayer line, she existed but she would no longer affect it. It's just common sense really, imagine it like water moving threw a pipe with valves, once you have opened one valve the water has moved on and can only be affected by opening the next valve. However many times you open and close the first valve the water will have still moved on and cannot be affected."
buffy,2sm0yb,GinaZaneburritos,0,Sat Jan 17 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"I get the analogy, I just think there remains some ambiguity in the show. As for what Slayer lore says, we're led to believe that there is no lore on this, and really it seems that no one is an expert. The line that everyone quotes about how Buffy died and then Kendra was called, then Kendra died and Faith was called, is said by Cordelia, and it's just her way of reasoning things out.  Buffy herself says in season 7 when talking to the potentials that ""my death could make you the next Slayer."" Apparently (according to Wikipedia) there was actually a longer speech originally in the script where she suggests that both she and Faith might have to die for the next slayer to be called. This suggests to me that Buffy and Giles and everyone still have this idea that ""there's still Slayer water in Buffy's pipe"" and her death could pass it along to someone else.  Is this explicitly cleared up in the show? Because I'd be happy if it were. It bothers me that so many characters think Buffy dying would create a new slayer if in fact that's not the case.  Edit: clarity"
buffy,2sm0yb,PCBreakdown,2,Sat Jan 17 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's quite clear that it's canon. Had the writers had any ambiguity on the issue they would have inserted a line at the beginning of season 6 about a possible new slayer but they didn't.   What Buffy says in season 7 I have always assumed she meant that when she dies another potential would have had to take her place as the leader, whether they were active or not. It could just be that Buffy was also confused on the issue but I don't think that means it wasn't clear to the viewers."
buffy,2sm0yb,lightswitch_raver,0,Sat Jan 17 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"Ha, well, apparently it's not clear to all viewers. :) If it's canon, I'd like to see the source.  I've found a similar discussion here: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/6840/who-does-the-slayer-lineage-run-through  Also, Buffy has a line to Giles somewhere about dying a second time: ""It was my time. Someone else would have taken my place."" Presumably, I would think, not Faith. I don't know if the writers are confused or just the characters, but I think certainly some viewers are."
buffy,2sm0yb,Beloit,2,Sat Jan 17 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"The issue is discussed to death tbh, it's brought up on this sub every other week. Again I think that line to Giles is open to interpretation, I don't think she literally meant a new slayer would be activated but that's just my opinion.   Regardless of the inconsistencies within the show I just think it makes sense logically."
buffy,2sm0yb,Zeppo_Ennui,5,Sat Jan 17 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was because Buffy was already replaced once. Each slayer only gets one replacement. Buffy already had Kendra, so she doesn't get another."
buffy,2sm0yb,Beloit,3,Fri Jan 16 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Once Buffy died the first time, she was no longer the ""active"" slayer. Faith would have to die for the next Slayer to be called-- at least until -- Season 7 Spoiler  /Edited because I screwed up the spoiler tag somehow."
buffy,2sm0yb,Zeppo_Ennui,2,Fri Jan 16 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think that an explanation that I saw a long time ago online was that since Buffy's death in season five was ""unnatural""/supernatural,  it didn't count as a trigger for another slayer.    My personal thoughts are just that the Slayer line was already split by her previous death so it couldn't be fragmented again like that."

buffy,2sofbs,Swarlolz,19,Fri Jan 16 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"You have the right to your opinion but I don't think you can reduce her character to 'witch' and 'lesbian'.   She was a very complex character and contrasted with the rest of the cast who were relatively outgoing. Sometimes you have to read in between the lines when it comes to Tara but I really like that. If we are going to add more adjectives to your list I would say...  Benevolent:   She is as close as the show becomes to a purely 'good' character and this is why it's so jarring when she killed in such a violent manner. The times in which Tara shows kindness within the series are innumerable but if I had to pick my favourite it would be season 6. The Scoobies were all over the place and Buffy had nobody to talk to. She forges this new type of relationship with Tara and Tara almost becomes her guiding light for a while, it's so sweet.   Wise:  Tara often shows wisdom far and above the rest of the characters on the show. She understood the danger of Willow crossing the line with Magick way before anybody else. She also understood the issues around life/death and resurrection, as seen in 'Forever' and the Bargaining two-parter.   Shy:  This is obviously personal preference but I love a shy character because they are so damn relateable. After 'Family' we understand a lot more about her character and realise that her timidness and stutter are quite clearly due to her abusive family. She also spends so many years thinking that she is part demon which must have made her feel worthless and paranoid.   Brave:  She may not be a Slayer or a super witch but Tara has shown her bravery on more than one occasion. The times that spring to mind are her battle with the demons in Bargaining part 2, her standing up to Willow and of course, her standing up to Glory and not revealing Dawn's identity even though she knew she would probably be killed.   I don't expect to change your mind but I hope I can at least prove that she is way more than just a lesbian-witch."
buffy,2sofbs,PacoBongers,3,Sat Jan 17 03:00:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I generally like charismatic characters and she just doesn't have any. She is just kind of there. I was surprised when she died and bam.   She is completely opposite to me, I don't hate my family, I'm not really in love with willow and I'm not shy or introverted. God damn I love her in OMWF I didn't like that that one episode made me not completely block out the character from memory. I'm on season 7 and the show seems less clunky without an extra character thrown in for no real value."
buffy,2sofbs,AngelAmongUs,8,Sat Jan 17 03:08:10 2015 UTC,What somebody classes as charismatic is up for debate but your opinion is your opinion. Personally I would argue that the hordes of potentials in season 7 were way clunkier than Tara ever was but that's just my two cents.   Considering you say you're on season 7 makes me think you are a new viewer so maybe that has something to do with it. She may never appeal to you which is fine but she will always have her allies :)

Tara was ""just there"" to me during seasons 4 and 5 the first time around (I was 14-15 at this time). During season 6, I felt like they really fleshed her out. It was easy to relate to her feelings of helplessness/anger/regret/hopelessness as she watched Willow continue to choose addiction over their relationship. In addition, she was the only person who approached the Buffy/Spike situation with any sort of compassion and easily became a favorite of mine during the last few moments of Dead Things. Years and years of re-watches have helped me really appreciate and love the character they were creating in the earlier seasons."

buffy,2shj6p,rbwildcard,18,Thu Jan 15 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"It's season six, episode 21.   As for the show, I've seen a lot of complaints that it mocks nerds despite having nerdy protagonists (some would use the term ""nerd blackface,"" which I think is a little silly, considering adults who enjoy sci-fi and video games are not some widely oppressed minority and probably shouldn't be compared to one), and I get that, but as someone who is unequivocally a nerd, I have to say that it just doesn't bug me that much. I don't watch it religiously or anything, but my parents do, and I find it kind of fun that every once in a while they'll send me some text that the Big Bang Theory guys mentioned yet another thing I do or like. So, yeah, it's mostly a show about nerds for non-nerds, but there are some funny jokes, and it can be fun every once in a while."
buffy,2shj6p,quintus_aurelianus,14,Thu Jan 15 06:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of The Big Bang Theory. It has its moments, but when I watch it I kind of feel like I'm the punchline.  However, I really do hate when people (on the internet) describe it as 'nerd blackface' like it's horrifically offensive because having a computer science degree and a six figure salary is just like being enslaved and then systematically denied the right to vote, work, and live in certain areas.  If that's ""nerd blackface"" then Scrubs is ""medical blackface"" and reddit loves Scrubs."
buffy,2shj6p,Starburstnova,3,Thu Jan 15 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, except on your last sentence. Scrubs is a terrible comparison. It's said to be the most medically accurate show on TV, both in showing how it is to work in a hospital and actual medical cases...except of course with exaggerated and added humor. They had a crapload of medical consultants."
buffy,2shj6p,quintus_aurelianus,2,Thu Jan 15 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure accuracy is relevant to my comparison.

buffy,2shj6p,robo2na,7,Thu Jan 15 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"The ""nerd blackface"" thing is really stupid, however, all of the attempted humor on the show seems to just be:  1) X Character attempts normal human interaction  2) Y ""nerd"" character spouts off irrelevant reference to technology or something considered nerdy  3) Laugh track  e.g.  ""Sheldon, do you want to get coffee later?""  ""Coffee? Is that the new version of Linux?""  or  ""I'm bringing a girl over later""  ""Girl? But I'm writing assembly language in x86!""  The actors don't even know what half of the things they're saying are or mean, as I've heard them admit in interviews. I know they have someone that researches the things they talk about, and everything I've heard them reference is real AFAIK, but everything just seems like a non-joke. It's like knowing the name of something technological is a joke in of itself to the writers."
buffy,2shj6p,heymeowmeow,4,Thu Jan 15 13:35:44 2015 UTC,I disagree. Most of the humor is the clash between social circles and how awkward the guys are. A lot of the humor is romantically oriented. So much so that they've added more female main characters to increase the amount of jokes.
buffy,2shj6p,Kittenclysm,4,Thu Jan 15 15:27:42 2015 UTC,This is why I gave up on BBT. There is no real character growth in my opinion and I don't like how the women are portrayed.
buffy,2shj6p,LinuxLinus,2,Thu Jan 15 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that blackface comparison is stupid and offensive. I'm beginning to think that most of the people who say that are still in High School or recently graduated and don't yet understand the difference between being unpopular and bullied in High School and legitimate societal oppression. It's also kinda silly because people act like you need a reason to dislike a sitcom beyond, ""I don't enjoy it."""
buffy,2shj6p,kmj2l,2,Thu Jan 15 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"The smarter the protagonists, the dumber the jokes. Examples of this are Futurama and The Big Bang Theory. Futurama makes pretty smart jokes because its protagonists are dumb, and, well... the Big Bang Theory has really smart protagonists.    Jokes where the punch line is ""lol he said Klingon"" just don't appeal to a lot of people."
buffy,2shj6p,LinuxLinus,5,Thu Jan 15 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"The real problem with it is that it is titanically unfunny. It's like a monument to how stupid and unfunny something can be, and so long as it presses enough buttons for enough people, it can still be a hit."
buffy,2shj6p,hopesdead,2,Thu Jan 15 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"Meh, I think it's about as funny (or unfunny, as the case may be) as most other sitcoms. I mean, sitcoms aren't really my thing in general, but this seems no better or worse than any other."

buffy,2sid9x,cocainelady,6,Thu Jan 15 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"I can't sleep and I guess writing about Buffy is a good way of fighting insomia, so, here we go...  Season 1 is without a doubt the worst season, for quite obvious reasons. Not gonna write about that. Season 4, on the other hand, is a really interesting case. It sucks, but it sucks for all the right reasons and I don't think I would change it.  Why does it suck? Well, because it does anything bad what seasons 2 and 3 did great. Buffy is great when it's emotionally immersive. It's at its best when there is everything at stake for the characters. Sounds like an easy and obvious formula... and well, it is. Joss had it completely figured out after Prophecy Girl and Surprise&Innocence. The show is at its best at these moments, so S2 featured lots of emotional ups and downs, culminating in Becoming, while S3 kinda did this again while exploring the road-not-taken theme with Faith. Be it her story or the whole Angel thing, Buffy is always directly and very emotionally engaged with the overall arc, creating a really good plot and great, terrifying antagonists and villains.  In season 4, Adam, aka the Worst Villain EVAR, has to randomly kill a kid for Buffy to care at all. Which in turn gets directly ridiculed with her Yummy Sushi Pajama speech, because the writers knew exactly what terrible plot-driven motivation this was. Buffy (the character) has no investment in fighting Adam whatsoever, which is really, really uncommon for Buffy (the show).   What's the theme of S4? S2 had this whole loosing-your-virginity-and-ugly-first-love-thing, S3 was the first season that really focused on Buffy growing up, facing tough decisions, becoming an adult and it did great by introducing Faith. S4? Really hard to say. There were so many possibilities, and all of them would've given Buffy some kind of direct emotional investment. Alienation from home and friends after leaving home (is kinda there, but has no connection to the bad guys), struggling to make new friends (gets mentioned, but is never really important), pressure to succeed in the real world, yadda yadda yadda. All this is mentioned in the season opener, and then completely ignored when the plot about the initiative takes over.  An essay in one of the books on Buffy argues that the theme of season 4 is the contrast of Magic and Technology, rationality and emotion, reason and feeling. Or something like that. The initiative with their lab coats analyzing the monsters while Buffy pokes them with a pointy stick. Now, I have a master degree in philosophy and we can argue about Feyerabend and Wittgenstein and whatever till the cows come home, but that is not a theme for a Buffy season. It's just not. Buffy needs to feel the plot to be engaging. She has to be really, really angry at the villain-du-jour, or it doesn't work. Adam and Buffy discussing their differences in philosophical ideas does not make an interesting story.  Now, I'm 100% convinced that Joss knew this very well. Why did he do it anyway? Because he has the great habit of playing against his strengths to keep his work interesting. I guess most people know the genesis of Hush. How people praised his sharp and witty dialogue and Joss was like, FUCK YOU, here's a completely silent episode without any banter. And then, when people pointed out that that was genuinely scary and terrifying and perhaps we should have more episodes like NOPE, our next villain is an flamboyant step-dancer straight outta Broadway.   The show would just be pretty good if Joss had lacked the courage to try new things and abandon his formula as soon as he figured out what was working. I love all his works for that. I'm pretty convinced (I want to believe), that Joss had S4 perfectly plotted out just the way a Buffy season works well. Lots of angsty Angel drama, Buffy being confronted with decisions that leave deep emotional scars no matter what, you know, all the good stuff. And then he said, no, we did all that before, let's do something completely different. Didn't work out, but, oh well. Rather aim for the sky and miss at times than just doing your things by the numbers for the now fourth time.  When season 5 rolled around, the show returned to its strengths. Buffy needed emotional investment in the villain, so the big bad threatened her family. Simple as that. Still, as much as much as Adam and the Initiative does suck, I'm glad that the show dared to try something like that and not do the same thing all over again."

In particular, I agree that this was a season where they took a lot of risks, and honestly, I'm glad they did. Too many TV shows find a successful formula and then stick with it for the rest of time with only minor modifications. So much changes in season 4: they move away from the ""high school is hell"" theme, they allow Buffy to finally move on from Angel, they make Willow gay. In a show known for witty dialogue, they have an episode where more than half of the time there's no dialogue at all.  I don't like ""Restless"" personally, but I'm more than willing to accept a few episodes I don't like as the after-effect of what happens when the show tries something wildly different. And I think it's also true that the transition from high school and childhood to college and adulthood is hard in real life. I think season 4 is very realistic in the way that it depicts all of the characters in a strange ""transition state."" All of our characters (not just Buffy, but also Xander, Giles, Anya, Willow, Oz, Spike) are uprooted in some way from their previous lives and struggling to figure out their place in the world now."
buffy,2sid9x,GinaZaneburritos,6,Fri Jan 16 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"My favourite season is season 2. Angelus has to be the best big bad to me (but Glory comes a close second). It had the perfect balance of comedy, drama, emotion, action.... Obviously it introduced Spike and Drusilla as well. And OZ! What's My Line, Surprise/Innocence, Passion and Becoming are some of the most epic episodes the show has had. School Hard, Phases, Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered and Halloween are so fun too. Season 3 is a close second. It had more individual stand out episodes than 2, but I didn't find the overall arc quite as compelling as I did in 2.  My least favourite is season 6. OMWF, Tabula Rasa and the final few episodes are some of the best ever, but I struggled with Buffy as a character this season. Obviously her mental anguish at being pulled from heaven was totally understandable and realistic, it just didn't make for very enjoyable viewing. She became overly shrewy and martyr-y when it came to Dawn (""I have a life; Dawn is my life"" or something like that). The Trio were fun, but didn't bring the gravitas I expect from a big bad (of course they were just a distraction til dark Willow came about, but I needed something bigger for the first 18 episodes). I felt they would have worked better as an Ethan Rayne type character - popping up every so often to give us a fun episode."
buffy,2sid9x,NovemberBlue93,2,Thu Jan 15 13:19:45 2015 UTC,Dark willow needed to be a longer lasting villain. There was so much potential there.
buffy,2sid9x,DrLisaCuddy-House,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with that. S6 is probably my second favourite season of the show because I really liked the darker tone of it and Dark Willow but I wish there was more emphasis placed on Willow's magic addiction throughout the season. I'd have preferred Dark Willow to come into the season earlier too, those final three episodes were great but they could/should have done more with her."
buffy,2sid9x,DrLisaCuddy-House,1 point,Sat Jan 17 12:38:04 2015 UTC,"She was such a better villain than most of the big bads. Everyone else was evil for the sake of being evil. Willow was evil because of other evil being evil. She came from a place of justice and went off the deep end.   And lets be honest, a good portion of the blame for that rests on Giles. It was obvious to everyone with any magical inclination that Willow was absurdly powerful and his solution was ""don't do that because it's wrong"". He could have trained her, taught her, taken her to the coven to learn how to control her power but instead he ran away."
buffy,2sid9x,Gneissisnice,4,Sat Jan 17 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'd order them like this:  5 > 6 > 3 > 2 > 1 > 7 > 4  I loved Glory, she made season 5 incredible. The entire season was just very well done.  4 is my least favorite. Adam and the Initiative were bland and boring, Riley was a bad boyfriend, and the switch to college from high school didn't feel good. It did have some great standalone episodes, but it also had Where the Wild Things Are, what I consider to be the worst episode of the series. Overall, the season 4 story arc was meh."
buffy,2sid9x,Scendo,5,Thu Jan 15 15:39:05 2015 UTC,2 and 3 are my favourites. 4 or 6 are my least favourites.
buffy,2sid9x,thebeardednurse,5,Thu Jan 15 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"i'm honestly amazed at how high everyone rates season 6.  THat's my favorite season, and when I was on the buffy boards I seemed to be an outsider when I expressed that opinion.  makes me happy.  But yes, Season 6 is my favorite, Spuffy is my favorite couple (grabs popcorn...) and OMWF and Tabula Rasa has gottan be the best 2 ep combo in the series (grabs m&ms....) plus....yellow crayon.  Season 4 would be my least favorite, i never bought Riley as the boyfriend, hated the initiative, and xander and his inbetween jobs and overall whining that he didn't go to college and giles not having anything to do was all just a bummer and annoyance."
buffy,2sid9x,gottafanny,4,Thu Jan 15 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"I realize that I'm in the minority here, but season 3 is probably my least favorite. My favorite season, by far, is season 5! So much emotion!!!"
buffy,2sid9x,GinaZaneburritos,2,Thu Jan 15 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious, what don't you like about season 3? Not to single you out, but you and /u/cocainelady and others who have it as their least favorite.  I can imagine a lot of reasons, like: you don't particularly like Faith, you don't like the continuation of the Buffy/Angel relationship after season 2, or you don't have anything against the season but just don't like it as much as other seasons. I'm just curious if I'm close at all or if there's some other reason :)"
buffy,2sid9x,gottafanny,3,Fri Jan 16 03:50:33 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the curiosity! like it up until I get to ""Bad Girls"", and then I like the filler episodes until the end of the season. I honestly just don't like what Faith does to Buffy. And I really just don't Faith."

I don't love Faith. I truly, truly dislike the Buffy/Angel stuff. The Mayor is great though. I love how much shit Buffy gets for taking off in season 2. Oz is amazing. The Willow/Xander affair is bullshit (though I understand why it was done). It just doesn't do much for me."
buffy,2sid9x,AngryWizard,2,Fri Jan 16 11:43:15 2015 UTC,That Willow/Xander nonsense really is bullshit. You summed it up with the grace and style it deserves. :)
buffy,2sid9x,nextfanatic,3,Fri Jan 16 21:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think season 5 and 6 would be my favourite just because it's where i really started to enjoy the show the most, by the time season 6 got around my 2 favourite characters anya and tara where regulars.  My least favourite would have to be season 4,  Adam and the initiative was way too bland, although  it did have a very strong finale."

buffy,2sid9x,osburnn,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"While I love all 7 seasons, 5 is hands down my favorite. 2 and 4 are pretty close to my least favorite."
buffy,2sid9x,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"My least favorite is always season 1. I think the bad guys (specifically the Master and the Anointed One) are pretty boring and unsympathetic. The trend that starts in season 2 with more interesting and well-developed villains for me is a real turning point in the show.  Also, although I like a lot of the episodes in season 1, I feel like as a whole the show is still trying to find its way. Let me put it this way: if I had seen only season 1 of Buffy, I wouldn't think much of the show at all.   My favorite season is much harder to pick; I like them all. My wife's favorite is season 7. I have to say that at first I didn't like season 7 all that much - mostly because I didn't like the introduction of the potentials - but the season has grown on me a lot. It's awesome to see how much the characters (and Buffy in particular) develop and grow. At the moment, my favorite season is probably season 2 (but in general my favorite is season 6)."
buffy,2sid9x,spilledhotchocolate,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"My favourite season is 5. So many episodes in there that i go back and watch all the time, and Glory was one of my favorite big bads.  My second favorite is probably season 7. I didn't want that to end :( least favorite is probably season 2 or 3. Part of that is because i dont really like Angel, and so the later seasons with Spike are my cup of tea."
buffy,2sid9x,walkthroughthefire,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"Favourite Season: Season 6 Least Favourite Season: Season 6  Okay, but seriously, season 6 had a lot of pros and a lot of cons, but I still think I would have to list it as my favourite. For one thing, two of my top five episodes are in that season. I also found that for the first time, I was able to relate to Buffy. The first time I watched season 6, I was going through something similar. Obviously I wasn't resurrected or anything like that, but I was pretty depressed and I dealt with it by getting into a not-so-healthy friends with benefits relationship where I shamelessly used him for sex even though I knew he was madly in love with me. On the other hand, it also has too of my least favourite episodes (Doublemeat Palace and Seeing Red), once of which triggered a pretty bad relapse in regards to my mental health (I'll let you guess which.) I also wasn't a big fan of Dawn's whining and the more times I watch it, the more the inconsistencies with the magic metaphors start to annoy me (first it represents her sexuality, then drugs, then...I'm not actually sure what the message of season 7 was supposed to me, but what I got from it was that addicts should do drugs, just in moderation...) Maybe I'm just a masochist, but even with all that bad stuff, I find that when I want to sit down and watch a good chunk of Buffy in chronological order, season 6 is my go too.   Season 2 would have to be a close second though. The Angelus arc was great. I was never really a big fan of David Boreanaz before that, but his performance as Angelus, particularly in Passion, really impressed me. Hmm...maybe I just subconsciously hate Buffy, since I seem to prefer the seasons where she's miserable.  My least favourite (if I can't say season 6) is a tie between season 1 and season 7. Season 7 had one or two really good episodes, and I thought all that Spuffy stuff towards the end was adorable, but overall, it was just not that interesting. I think the biggest mistake they made was introducing a bunch of new characters all at once, not giving us any reason why we should care about them, and then giving them way too much screen time.   I think season 1 was probably worse in terms of quality and weirdness (i.e. rapey bug teachers, rapey hyena xander...wow, season 1 was a lot rapey-er than I remembered.) I actually stopped watching it for awhile--partially because I just wasn't that interested anymore and partially because my mom came home from her holiday and she's got a weird religious thing about demons and witches and vampires and lesbians and I didn't want to deal with a lecture. I only came back because I finished watching How I Met Your Mother (at least all that was on Netflix at the time) and started going through Alyson Hannigan withdrawal. It's pretty silly and ridiculous, but I have a hard time ranking it below season 7 because of the nostalgia factor. They all look so young and cute! I just wanna hug them."

I don't like his political views. The real evil in me wants to walk up to him, spray him with red dyed corn syrup and announce, ""You look good in red."" then laugh with an insane giggle as I get escorted out by security while yelling ""pink illuminati!""    River may not win with Buffy, but I have a dream that she will win with Adam Baldwin. Who announced on twitter (about two years ago) that rape victims who get pregnant are unicorns & don't exist.   I then responded with I was a unicorn and would stab him with my horn. I have been having to block his followers ever since, oh & I had to block him too. I would like to say one thing about Joss, he tends to pick his actors well. Adam Baldwin (Jayne) was a definite typecast. What an asshole."
