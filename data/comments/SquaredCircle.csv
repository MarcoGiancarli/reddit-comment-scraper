Almost immediately after I won the belt, the rest of the promoters wanted to book me, I'll admit, they were to an extent booking the belt, but it gave me a chance to prove myself to them, and now, even without a belt, I'm one of the go to guys in the area when booking a show.

Yukes made Smackdown.   After No Mercy was released, AKI's contract with THQ was over and they became a free agent. EA folded Kodiak and signed AKI to a deal. As EA still owned the WCW license they were going to have AKI make some WCW games but WCW folded shortly after preliminary work was done.AKI made the two Def Jam games using upgraded versions of the AKI engine. Yukes continued to make Smackdown games for THQ as PS2 exclusives and THQ signed Anchor to make the WWE Raw games for Xbox.  Edit: Boom  http://www.unseen64.net/2008/07/26/wcw-mayhem-2-ps2-cancelled/  Screenshots from WCW Mayhem 2 developed by AKI and produced by EA.

SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,RamonesRazor,7,Tue Jul 21 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"I started subscribing to the Meltz in January, and its been fascinating reading the attitude era observers each week.   Every single negative thing that took down WCW that we could watch in the Network specials or has been talked about ad nauseam on here or elsewhere is all in hindsight for the most part.   In his observers, he's saying this stuff as it happens. Like, every week he's predicting WCW's future demise even while they're killing it in ratings and house shows. It's incredible to see someone really understand the business to that degree, and pretty much predict the future so accurately."
SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,TheWhiteWayneBrady,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"But, he once may have inartfully stated whether Punk was going to be at a WWE show or not, so he knows nothing."
SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,AliveJesseJames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"Because looking back in hindsight, everything WCW was in the short term. They were looking to win now over the WWF and weren't really concerned with where they would be in 5/10 years. A lot of this was because of Bischoff. Ted put him in charge to take the down the WWF and to do it quickly. When it didn't work and the WWF went back on the offensive, there was nothing left for WCW to counterattack with.  Or, if in video game terms, WCW was playing Facehunter to WWF's Handlock."
SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,Michelanvalo,10,Tue Jul 21 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"This is why I'll never understand people who get upset about Hogan and his booking. The guy came up at the end of the true ""carnie"" era, when promoters would gouge talent for every penny they could and it was really an every man for himself environment. He was a shrewd, take no prisoners negotiator and businessman who managed to protect his brand and gimmick for almost 40 years, while maintaining his spot as the biggest star in history.   In one of the more sleazy industries in sports and entertainment, Hogan never let himself get screwed, and I for one respect the hell out of that."
SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,the_box_man47,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"He didn't let himself get screwed, but he still screwed over other people.

SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,_FinestJellyBeansRaw,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"Hogan was a bitch because his contract included a significant percentage of other wrestlers' merchandise sales, on top of the $2 million he was getting per ppv."
SquaredCircle,3e3d0f,BadNewsBrown,5,Tue Jul 21 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Hogan did this ALL the time right up until WCW died.

Compared to the past 2-3 years, it will make him faster, very likely with more stamina, and improve his explosive power and endurance. And IMO, that all showed last night.   Based on McCool's videos, she also does Crossfit. So that also adds to the idea that Taker focuses on it."

But now that we know Cena can put on a hell of a match in the ring I think it would be a great matchup. I think if Cena refused, Taker could hound and obsess over it like HBK did to get his rematch. It's an easy way to get months of confrontation without an actual match. Strap Nikki to his old crucifix, tombstone Cena's dad, show up at a Make a Wish and attack him in front of a cancer kid. Yeah, yeah it's just fantasy booking but it gives us: -Heel Taker, one last time. -A matchup we haven't seen in a long time with an easy-to-write story. -And good ""out"" for the Taker to retire - his work is done. Uggggh! Wanna see this so bad."
SquaredCircle,3e24m2,bluebird1308,6,Tue Jul 21 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Most likely yes. But I can always see him getting one off appearances, not actually wrestling in the ring. I think after a great servant he's been to the company he should have this run and deservedly a hall of fame induction."

SquaredCircle,3e24m2,Dani_Californication,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"For many years I've had this idea. It was a lot better when the streak was intact, but I also thought a WrestleMania ""If Undertaker wins, he must retire match"" would be quite interesting and a unique twist on the retirement match.   It forces the character to choose between his 'life' and career vs his hubris and accomplishment. I still works fairly well today -- if a fighter's streak ends, they don't think ""Fuck, well now I'll just half-ass it all the time"". No, they'll try to improve their victories and win/loss ratio."
SquaredCircle,3e24m2,Dani_Californication,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"My fantasy scenario was always a heel Cena as champion vs Undertaker for the title, and Taker's career on the line."
SquaredCircle,3e24m2,ManiaCrawl,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"That's another great stipulation, it benefits mostly from an unbroken streak though. There would be more fear that Cena would be the one (source: Cena's history of burying people). Even more fear than Brock, who had very little due to partly due to a lacklustre feud and being a part-timer.   Although in all honesty, I'd hate for Undertaker to lose a Mania retirement match to Cena. He just goes over in every way in every situation. And to get the hypothetical first, or the reality of a 2nd Mania win over Taker is just more CENAWINSLOL bullshit."

It's the multitude of people that post things about that spoiler afterwards and they all get up-voted to the front page.   With this last one, we had FalconArrow's post ... then the front page the next day there were 5 or 6 threads about the Undertaker all around it. It's not hard to figure out."

SquaredCircle,3dyajd,chokethewookie,21,Mon Jul 20 20:22:20 2015 UTC,And I don't understand why someone who watches wrestling wouldn't want to know.  I guess different people want different things.
SquaredCircle,3dyajd,sdcSpade,36,Mon Jul 20 15:48:39 2015 UTC,I'd like to hear just one argument in favor of expecting The Undertaker to appear instead of being surprised by the gong in the middle of the match. Because I honestly don't understand.
SquaredCircle,3dyajd,DangerDamage,6,Mon Jul 20 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not interested in what they have to offer.  Falconarrow spoils that CM Punk is going to return at SS.  I have interest again and will watch that PPV to see how they book his return.  You get it now? I don't wanna sit through a bad PPV full of matches I don't care about hoping I get that ""omg really?!"" feeling once, because a majority of the time it won't happen.  Here is my Undertaker argument - The only match I cared about on the card was the Cena vs Owens match. The finish to it looked so much like Cena just buried Owens, and I honestly was thinking ""I might as well just stop watching after that shit"". But then I remembered that Undertaker was going to show up and I decided to stay and watch the main event.  Essentially, when it's spoiled, I have a reason to watch a match I'm not very invested in."
SquaredCircle,3dyajd,Zorak9379,6,Mon Jul 20 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of late-era Undertaker or screwy match endings, so I was less disappointed last night than I would have been had I been surprised. I enjoyed the in-ring work of Lesnar-Rollins more because I wasn't hung up on where the match was going."
SquaredCircle,3dyajd,chokethewookie,4,Mon Jul 20 18:32:12 2015 UTC,Alright.   I had little interest in watching the main event at Battleground because it was obviously being booked that Seth was going to retain through some kind of bullshit interference.   The Taker spoiler changed my whole opinion of the show and made me want to watch it because I didn't want to miss his return.

People were theorizing either HHH will turn on Rollins or Heyman would turn on Lesnar. Nobody thought of the Undertaker. Then FalconArrow flat out said it was Taker, and the front page blew up with Undertaker posts. I ignored the spoiler threads but it's easy to put two and two together.  He should stick to vague clues from now on. To get us speculating and talking."

Sadly there is no deadman-esque comeback where the lights go out and when they come back you get some Kevin Owens spoilers. To even clarify a bit for you, I know you all think that just receiving hate mail was the distinguishing factor as to why I left but really, it was my unexpected want to lash back at the trolls that did it. I never wanted my time here to be angry or aggressive in anyway, and when it almost got there I dropped it. I love you guys/girls and I love the thread, but in the end getting angry over a subreddit just wasn’t worth it. This place and it’s users deserve better.   This account isn’t being deleted and I am still going to respond to messages here and there, mainly because the mods despite some of your worst intentions are pretty fantastic and (please don’t stone me for saying this) are decent at their jobs.

Your sole interest is based in selfish reasoning that doesn't benefit the person at all.

I was very grateful for falconarrow giving us inside information, like many other people were, but I can understand why people wouldn't be happy when they go into completely unrelated threads and have the show spoiled because people forget that not everyone wanted to hear it, whether it was intentional or not.  For example, if I saw a post regarding spoilers for the IC title situation with Ryback injured atm, I would read them, because I'm not exactly interested in the IC feud just now. But if I saw spoilers regarding Seth Rollins or a surprise return for Stone Cold Steve Austin I wouldn't be happy about it, because for some things I enjoy not knowing what happens next. For some things it's so much better to be surprised, like when Seth turned on The Shield, as much as it broke my heart."
SquaredCircle,3dyajd,comhcinc,15,Mon Jul 20 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"I remember when MetsFan was still a polite and positive contributor to this community and he made those ""I'm leaving!"" Submissions and comments (before returning). This seems on a very similar path. Quit, return, quit, return.  If Falcon wanted to leave, he should've just left. Messaged the mods to tell them and then stopped coming or deleted his account. Seems like an attention-seeking stunt designed to guilt the community. Now, it's just like when MetsFan quit the first couple times."

EDIT: Found stuff on wikipedia   Ura-nage  This move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex [...]  The name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means ""throw to behind/back"" and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution."

SquaredCircle,3e12tn,Denny_Craine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:39 2015 UTC,I just started BJJ myself and I gotta sayi much prefer the Judo I learned 20 year ago to either bjj or judo today. BJJ is just way to slow and horrid to watch  (though fun to do I always prefered Newaza judo) and modern judo is just too limited and creativity is somewhat stifled and newaza pretty much non existent.  As a sport I just can't stand teh practice of pulling guard and lying on your back I think BJJ needs to add a pinning system like judo. 30 seconds for a pin is a long time and enough for you to try and counter with your BJJ submissions or a transition conversely Judo needs to let the Judoka have some time to transition into pins and guards and not just stand you up after 5 seconds if you don't get a pin position or submission hold.  Edit: one huge affect the time limit in judo has done for me in BJJ in most of my opponents are shocked and have no response to how fast I can transition or go from take-down straight into fullmount o side control.

But my point is, now they have five whole weeks to spread across all the feuds, instead of making sure pieces are in place to hit certain ""beats"" so to speak in time for specials.

Sheamus sucks.  Randy Orton has been boring for as long as John Cena has been stale.  Cesaro was treated as an afterthought.

It's sort of counterintuitive, but I think the best Titantron videos for the HD era are the simplest ones that just create a dynamic wall behind the wrestler. Paige's debut Titantron, for example, was awesome, or Miz's WrestleMania main event one with the red background and fan silhouettes. They also tend to use this sort of simple video wall for WrestleManias, and that's why WrestleMania usually looks a notch above.   The simple graphics look so good in HD that it's easy to get immersed in them. Times New Roman or Microsoft Office WordArt does not look as good.

Is it like the rest of the world where some know Cena, Bryan, etc... Or is it like during the attitude era height when it was cool to walk around in a Austin shirt at school?"
SquaredCircle,3dza0a,Necramonium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:06 2015 UTC,it's probably about what it is in the rest of the world. certainly not huge like it was in the late 90s (both there and in North America)
SquaredCircle,3dza0a,Gann1,5,Tue Jul 21 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"See, the thing is, some of the wrestlers are more popular as personalities than as wrestlers.  Two prominent examples: Okada is very well known among children because he takes part in commercials for Bushiroad's card games.  Lots of women and housewives know Makabe because he's often on daytime TV talk shows talking about desserts (His blog name on Ameblo is actually ""sweetsmakabe"").  But as a whole wrestling is not close to as popular as it was in its heights of the 80s and 90s, when they were running the Tokyo Dome multiple times a year and selling it out.  Their weekly television show airs at 3am, on a good network sure, but it gets like 30 minutes or an hour (the show is PPV highlights, not an episodic format). It's a niche product even in Japan, but it is steadily growing and has been in the last few years, really since Tanahashi's rise to prominence."

SquaredCircle,3e143m,OriginalLunatic,5,Tue Jul 21 06:35:46 2015 UTC,That was the first segment to really make me laugh.    This show has so much potential but it just doesn't really click.  They don't get enough of a reaction from the superstars but what did they expect?  None of them are going to freak out in front of a fan.
SquaredCircle,3e143m,Pris257,2,Tue Jul 21 11:15:16 2015 UTC,"They need more segments to have an antagonist who wouldn't care about their stardom.   Like you said, they won't flip out on or in front of a fan. But they should stage more pranks involving backstage crew who are being a nuisance. Like the 'security' who blocked Seth and Barrett from getting back in.   What worked well with the Fandango/Slater coffee segment was they weren't ""wrestlers trying to remain calm in front of fans,"" they were ""doofuses at a coffee shop"" and the idea of preserving their goodwill in front of a WWE fan isn't on their minds like it would've been for Curtis or Naomi, or Kane in that episode with the old lady, etc."
SquaredCircle,3e143m,Dani_Californication,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:20 2015 UTC,The Curtis/Naomi one was just uncomfortable.  The kid was barely bratty enough.  The mom flirted okay but the dad went too over the top with Naomi.

They are pushing Trevor Lee very hard and Im not a fan of his yet. I think they dont want someone from England to be champ cause those plane tickets are expensive. Ricochet would be okay because he really is the king of the indys right now(ROH isnt an indy anymore IMO). Sydal would be cool because he doesnt have bad matches. Hero would be good but god he is huge now like he put on some weight. So Sydal would be my pick but not likely.
SquaredCircle,3e35aa,JuniorSquared,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:03 2015 UTC,I feel like Hero is trying to do a Riki Choshu/Genichiro Tenryu grumpy out of shape old man who punches rookies in the face sort of thing. If he'd just be a bit less indie (Basically do less moves and spend more time being an asshole and treating his opponent like shit instead of trying to do work rate stuff) I'd adore a title reign which is just him beating the piss out of smaller people and tying them in knots.

SquaredCircle,3dza0a,Gann1,5,Tue Jul 21 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"See, the thing is, some of the wrestlers are more popular as personalities than as wrestlers.  Two prominent examples: Okada is very well known among children because he takes part in commercials for Bushiroad's card games.  Lots of women and housewives know Makabe because he's often on daytime TV talk shows talking about desserts (His blog name on Ameblo is actually ""sweetsmakabe"").  But as a whole wrestling is not close to as popular as it was in its heights of the 80s and 90s, when they were running the Tokyo Dome multiple times a year and selling it out.  Their weekly television show airs at 3am, on a good network sure, but it gets like 30 minutes or an hour (the show is PPV highlights, not an episodic format). It's a niche product even in Japan, but it is steadily growing and has been in the last few years, really since Tanahashi's rise to prominence."

Like the 'security' who blocked Seth and Barrett from getting back in.   What worked well with the Fandango/Slater coffee segment was they weren't ""wrestlers trying to remain calm in front of fans,"" they were ""doofuses at a coffee shop"" and the idea of preserving their goodwill in front of a WWE fan isn't on their minds like it would've been for Curtis or Naomi, or Kane in that episode with the old lady, etc."

Ricochet would be okay because he really is the king of the indys right now(ROH isnt an indy anymore IMO). Sydal would be cool because he doesnt have bad matches.

They have no traditional media outlets, so it's interesting to see how they can build storyline interest pretty much strictly online. A promo is effectively an advertisement. Nothing bothers me more than being 'sold' to after I've already signed up. Once you're there, it's about keeping me there. Thrasher Magazine uploads once every three days with like three-to-five really good videos they've been working on, it's the perfect schedule; 'oh all my Thrasher shit is here today, is right, I'll watch some of these.' I know they're in their infancy, but a really fucking good weekly YouTube show would do way more good than five promos a day from guys I don't really know or care about yet."

SquaredCircle,3dykju,koscielinho,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"well there's sometimes quite a lot of unavoidable spoilers here, so look at the risk and make a decision from there.   you don't deserve spoilers, but they are here, you run the risk every time you come looking for discussion and cool stuff made by the community, that's just a fact no matter what kind of modding is enforced.   so just make a decision, is discussion and fun stuff worth me having to actively avoid spoilers, sometimes being actually unable to due so because shit happens.   if it's worth it to you than carry on, if it's not worth it to you than this community probably isn't what you was looking for anyways.   i mean this is all noble, but really you are in danger of spoilers at any moment, just like KenPantera said, he doesn't go on /r/gameofthrones, not because it's some sort of shitty subreddit, but because it's expected you could accidentally stumble upon a spoiler at any moment and that's just simply not acceptable for him so he doesn't even read the subreddit. I regularly unlike facebook pages of reality shows and dramas before their new season starts, i don't like a single official WWE page on facebook as they post spoilers immediately after the show, see i'm a weird one i actually can sort of dig spoilers a couple weeks in advance for WWE, it got me really hyped for Battleground knowing the undertaker might be showing up. What i can't personally take is spoilers of the show after it happened and i've somehow missed it, THAT's why i actually unsub the day of the show if i know i'm going to miss it, sometimes i still get spoiled cuz this shit goes on my facebook trending !! wtf.  look all i'm saying even with a mega thread, even with better policing by the mods, there is still going to be spoilers here, spoilers and wrassling message boards been going hand in hand since day 1, so just take care of your own man, ultimately you just gonna have to assess the risk and decide if it's worth it for ya."
SquaredCircle,3dykju,bluedabio,5,Mon Jul 20 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining your reasoning, but this is the best place on the internet to discuss wrestling, have people make gifs and highlights of things you didn't even notice, hell this sub even got me into new promotions I never would have considered with great user made explanations of the wrestlers and storylines. I don't really want to give it up and it kind of feels like a slap in the face if I have to choose between carrying on being in this community or being exposed to spoilers.  I understand that people want spoilers so they can get excited about an event or know if they should tune in or not, but i'm going to be watching all the content regardless and the suprises make the greatest moments for me. you can't tell me that moments like rocks return, seth cashing in, undertakers streak ending would be as good if we knew before hand.

I don't see why it's so hard to avoid spoiling something that is a surprise part of the plot that really doesn't need ruined because it's not  common knowledge and there is no ""lore"" that could have already spoiled it if you read ahead (e.g. idiots tweeting ""taker is under the ring!"").  I know this is SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT and not SPORTS but can you imagine in /r/nfl if people were like ""omg i heard the packers are gonna win the superbowl by 10 points confirmed"" - I think we all like that suspension of disbelief."

SquaredCircle,3dykju,bluedabio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:17 2015 UTC,It comes with the territory. The speculation is part of the fandom and no matter how stringent the posting of spoiler tags are (and then the meta of how those tags are formatted) spoilers can leak out.

You can't just keep moving the goal posts like that.

I would expect something interesting to happen during a PPV main event, especially given that there is always going to be a question of who will win or lose. Movies are completely different in that not all have twists, but every match either has a winner or a non-finish like last night's.

Imagine if today Cena is in the ring for an open challenge and it is accepted by Stone Cold Steve Austin. The surprise of glass breaking would make any of us cum. If you saw ""Spoilers! Huge return for Cena Open Challenge!"" Then that would ruin it. Coupled with the other posts of  ""Saw Austin at the Airport!"" And the like. The moment is completely altered.

SquaredCircle,3dzifw,Zanydrop,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"Google's Translation- Google seems to think Sexy Star is a he.  MEXICO - One of the best fighters in Latin America and the world, Sexy has been several times champion in his company Triple A, and of the International Wrestling Federation. He is a warrior inside and outside the ring.  How do you get to wrestling?  Well, I always saw in sportswear, but never knew what I was going to spend, I always practiced all sports. After something happens very strong in my life that made me fall into a deep depression and try to take my life, I did not make it, I did not have the guts to do it, because to do that will require a lot of guts and support of my parents at the time, telling myself ""I have always loved sports and I will support"" from there went into self defense classes, I met someone who invited me to the Lucha Libre and I decide to go to be at the party, I wanted to take and forget what was happening and already half-toned (drinks above) start to yell at the wrestlers (men), as my resentment was to a man (none of those fighters) and yelled that I was going up and he was going to show them I could with each and one of them told me that if it was true what he was saying, I felt offended and attacked, told them yes it was true and that was the start in wrestling. Since I put into the ring for the first time, I felt a strange sensation, was to die and be reborn and start a new life, luckily I'm here.  Why participate in the Body Issue?  It was a difficult decision I was thinking a lot, and I had offered to do something a bit similar, but on the other hand, say men's magazines, and he never took those proposals. But now that I do Body Issue's proposal, it became very interesting because they see the strength of the human being, the strength of the body in different disciplines, mark these parts, is something different and interesting. I talked to my husband and at first it took as wave, but I explained what it was, loved the idea and said ""I have always supported and this is no exception.""  How was the experience of being naked in front of a camera?  The truth ... (a little painful laughter) was something strange, something fun, something funny, something I do not know, it was a strange feeling, I was very nervous last night I did not sleep, gave me a headache, feeling much stress anxiety and did not know that would happen, but despite that characterized me as a very outgoing woman, such as nude photos is a little difficult aside from obviously would not only be naked in front of a camera It is also photographer, cameraman and find it hard to trust, but since I had the first contact with the people who were going to do all this, I felt the confidence to do so.  What is harder to be in front of an arena full or naked in front of a photographer and his camera?  It's an adrenaline rush and a totally different feeling, here you are making sure that I did not see anything, these self-conscious, the body tenses and says ""move"", but knowing these naked is quite different. Instead being in front of thousands of people in the fight, because it is something that I'm used to.  Is it difficult to follow instructions from a photographer?  I always get carried away when it is doing, in this case the photographer knows more and if you tell me to do something is because the pictures will come out amazing, that kept me calm and clear I put in the hands of the expert.  What is the type of body to be in wrestling?  For Wrestling do not require a body type, if these small or marking, plump or all body types, weights are handled here not to fight. This depends on how you want to be and what you want to show people. Personally I have always worried about being in shape and have an athletic body, I am a top athlete and want to show muscle, and I am a woman clutching and delivered, I like to be different from others and maintain a good body, yes it marks difference at least in Mexico.  Is it harder to face a camera or an opponent in the ring?  A camera (shows a small smile). Face her fully, as against an opponent I'm always psyched and hard work the psychological part, always see with the eyes of no one with me and I'll win, then that's what I'm ready, but to undress on camera I think that I never imagined."

SquaredCircle,3e2go9,18IsOldEnough,20,Tue Jul 21 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"The story begins with Kevin Dunn's father saving a ton of WWF (maybe WWWF?) footage from a burning trailer. Vince felt he was also in debt to Dunn so he vowed to keep him and his son employed for life.   Dunn has been giving the reputation of being too influential for what his position is. He's stated that woman are pretty much objects and have no reason to be involved with wrestling other than  a nice piece of ass to look at.   Apparently him and Triple H bump heads a lot because Triple H feels the business needs to go in one direction and Dunn/Vince go in another direction. Many feel Dunn intentionally goes the opposite way of Triple H because of the dislike between both of them.  Dunn is a huge influence on Vince McMahon and it's been reported that Dunn was a factor in stopping a lot of pushes (Adam Rose, well anybody with accents apparently, and rumors lately are he's trying to halt Kevin Owen's momentum).  Also, he's the dude that does that nauseating zooming in and out shit on live events. Oh yeah, and apparently he's intentionally missed certain shots of matches that has pissed off fans and wrestlers alike. I remember last year when the Shield was standing tall over Evolution, the camera panned to the crowd for a good 10-15 seconds and missed that entire ""epic moment"". Triple H wasn't very happy.  Jim Cornette has said a lot of negative things about him in shoot interviews which have gained a lot of laughs."
SquaredCircle,3e2go9,Cutmerock,10,Tue Jul 21 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"Dunn also, from most articles written, is very jealous that Steph/Hunter are McMahons succession plan and not him.

Instead of suffering a little pain for much future gain the company (Vince) is taking the shortsighted approach of going back to a dry well. They just don't want to take the necessary time to build a top tier name and get the ratings bump and merch sales that entails. So Cena wins, and a tournament for the U.S. Title.

He cuts a short promo embracing the chants of ""Let's go Cena!"" and ""Cena sucks!"" He praises Kevin Owens and their most recent title match. Commentary reminds us that even though we don't like John Cena, we have to respect him for coming out week-after-week and grappling with unpredictable new talent. Cena opens up the floor for another United States Title Open Challenge. Heath Slater's music hits. He walks down to the ring looking determined but quietly confident. Cena throws his shirt and hat into the crowd then runs the ropes. Within five minutes, Slater squashes Cena and raises the United States Title above his head. His eyes roll back in his head, we hear the sound of a gong and the lights go off. In a matter of moments, the arena lights up again and standing in Slater's place is The Undertaker continuing the debut of his new shapeshifter gimmick."

Maybe that's why Kane, while reluctant, always winds up helping Rollins. Maybe he needed Rollins to rob Lesnar of victory at Wrestlemania XXXI and prevent Roman Reigns from beating the man who ended the streak.   And because Undertaker defeated Bray Wyatt at Wrestlemania XXXI, he has some sort of control over him. And because of that, he deployed Wyatt to stop Reigns from winning Money in the Bank and getting back into the main event picture. Which would also explain why Wyatt is using the expression, ""Anyone but you."" Because Undertaker can't stand the idea of anyone but himself defeating Brock Lesnar at Wrestlemania. Big Show and Kane were even two of the last people Reigns defeated in the Royal Rumble to face Lesnar.  Maybe Mark Henry was right when he kept yelling, ""Y'all a bunch of puppets!"" The Undertaker is the puppet master. We could be dealing with some Chikara-level shit here, people."

SquaredCircle,3dzpen,vande700,6,Mon Jul 20 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"I have to say Cesaro has been impressing me as of late with his ability to put on matches that can be considered MOTY on just any old RAW shows. It seems like he is under pressure to perform this way to get the continued push he has been wanting, but he has yet to crack which is awesome to see.  You can just see in Cesaro's eyes that he has that look that says ""I want to break free... from this midcard role"" which he has been stuck in for years. He just wants it all and he wants it now! In terms of the main eventers duties. I don't think there is a way to stop Cesaro now, he has that main event scene as his one vision.  I've been a fan of Cesaro for many years now so I'm going slightly mad that he gets these pushes only to see him thrown down even when he nails it.  This time I feel he will breakthru these barriers set by the morons in the back. You don't fool me Vince with your dislike for Cesaro and his personality rather than giving him credit for his abilities in and out of the ring.  I've had hopes for many talents before and when they get depushed it's like another one bites the dust. I've never had that feel for Cesaro, I also thought he'd come back stronger and he is proving that every year.   This is the best I've seen him do during one of his pushes so it would be quite a scandal if he was to get depushed yet again, even when he is working his tail off to put these great matches on free TV for the fans.  I guess the show must go on with or without Cesaro in the main event, right Vince?"

There was like a brief 1 month window where Randy vs Cena was going on near the Rumble, but everyone hated that lol I don't need to remind anyone about that Championship Ascension moment :P   And at Wm31, him and Cena were on the same level feuding both for midcard titles. So Bryan is a very recent example.   Other then that? Not sure. Everyone whose really been involved in a Cena program hasn't been a top guy yet with exception to Rollins I think.
