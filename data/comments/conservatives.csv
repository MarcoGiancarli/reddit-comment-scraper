You exchange things of worth for other things of worth, and you are paid for doing things of objective value. In socialism, need is the basis for reward. Income is transferred from those of lesser need to those of greater need via government sanctioned theft.  When need is the basis for reward, the way one gets ahead in such a society is by striving to be needier than the rest of society. For the left, this is a well defined process of how many minority boxes you can tick off. Women, which outnumber men, are considered minorities owing to historical lack of integration into the workplace. Their reasons for being categorized as such are diminishing daily. Being a black woman ticks two minority boxes, granting you twice as much need, and letting you access more easy routes to success. Fauxchohontas (Elizabeth Warren) exploited this by claiming to be a female Native American. Beggars in India will blind or maim themselves because the entire driver for begging income is perceived need, and you generate more income by appearing to be more needy.  Lefties refuse to acknowledge this is what they are incentivizing when they pursue their redistribution programs. People compete to see who is the biggest victim.

Now for me here is the sticking point. Treaties are supposed to be binding to the US and trump our domestic law. But since deals/executive actions are not ""treaties"" they are not binding.

The current thinking in the US is that until the ""age of majority"" (when a child turns 18) parents are considered the custodians of a child's rights, meaning the child has the rights of any other citizen, but those are held by the parents on their behalf (the exceptions being things like voting where the constitution specifically dictates something different).  The UNCRC seems to make the government the custodian of a child's rights more than the parents and in doing so undermines the culturally accepted model of what a family looks like to many Americans and (I'm guessing) to most people from Iowa. It's worth noting that the UNCRC does make some stipulations that would likely improve the lives of children, especially in bad situations, but in my opinion it probably isn't worth it to sacrifice the principle of the family in order to secure these solutions.

Sorry mom and dad, you can't do anything about that, that's part of his freedom of conscience.  Sarah doesn't see anything wrong with making a profit for selling sex to her classmates.  Sorry mom and dad, that's part of her moral code.  Freedom of conscience applies unless the state makes laws prohibiting the conduct.  Article 15 requires that children have freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly.  Tommy wants to go to the concert, and you can't tell him no.  Annie wants to go hang out with the Occupy protesters.  That's her right under the convention.  Oops she got raped.  Who could have seen that coming.  Article 16 makes bullying a violation of international law.  Likewise when mom goes through his sock drawer looking for drugs.  Under Article 17, children are required to have access to mass media.  Think too much TV is harmful?  Sorry.  Don't want him watching ISIS propaganda videos before he can understand why they might burn someone alive?  Too bad.  If the country makes laws prohibiting their viewing such material you can stop them, otherwise you can't control it.  Article 19 could prohibit parents from spanking their children, or even speaking harshly to them, if the international community decides those things constitute physical or mental abuse.  Article 22 prohibits countries from turning back illegal alien children.  Article 24 sounds great until you realize that it puts the state as the primary decider of care for children, not the parents - and that it was under just such theories that doctors at a Massachusetts hospital kidnapped a teenager with a rare medical condition and got the courts to grant them custody, because they disagreed with the diagnosis of the doctors at the other hospital that was treating her.  The doctors at the second hospital misdiagnosed her, were too embarrassed to admit it, and it took a year and a half for her family to get custody back.  Article 26 requires that children be given social security and welfare, regardless of their immigration status.  Article 28 requires compulsory schooling  Article 34 says that states should act to prevent inducement, coercion, or exploitation of children for unlawful sexual activity or porn.  So... if the child isn't induced or coerced, and is working for themselves, that makes it OK, if it is part of their freedom of conscience.  Article 37, section a prohibits life imprisonment or capital punishment for those under 18.  So that 17 year old gang banger who just raped and murdered your family will get out.  Section b makes grounding a child illegal."

Ok   If they don't have to worry about prison time, they'll be more likely to voluntarily seek rehab treatment.    Some will, some won't. I know a few people who it wasn't until they were facing their 4th or 5th DUI or felony DUI, that they saw that they needed help. They knew they had a problem, and tried to do it themselves, but needed help.   We need to offer the treatment with the guarantee that they won't be punished.   There are plenty of options for people who want to get clean and/or sober out there without fear of punishment.   Second, unless they're out there committing serious crimes, the government has no business interfering with their lives like that.   Dealing in drugs is illegal and thus a crime. It is also absolutely within the realm of the Congress to criminalize, see Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, ""To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes"".   We don't need a big nanny-state government telling people how to live their lives. If they're wrecking their own lives, that's tragic, but that's also their decision.   I absolutely agree that we don't need a big nanny state government telling people how to live their lives. But the damage from drug and alcohol abuse doesn't just wreck the lives of the user. When I have to pay higher taxes to support someone on SDI and welfare to support someone who cant support themselves because they fried too many drug cells, that affects me. When someone causes an accident that seriously injures and disables someone just because they wanted to get high, it wrecks other peoples lives. When you are addicted to a substance, that is no longer a choice; if it was you wouldn't need rehab centers.   Have you ever been into a NICU (Neonatal ICU) unit. I worked at a hospital years ago and had to go in the NICU a few times for tech support. More than half of the babies in their were premature and addicted to crack.

I know a few people who it wasn't until they were facing their 4th or 5th DUI or felony DUI, that they saw that they needed help. They knew they had a problem, and tried to do it themselves, but needed help.   I'm not saying to legalize driving while intoxicated. I would say we should take an approach to drugs similar to that of Colorado's approach to cannabis. It's legal to buy, have, and use in private. It's not legal to operate a vehicle while intoxicated.  My point is not that prison doesn't ever work in reforming people's behavior. My point is that we shouldn't be locking people in prison over drugs. We should divert the absurd amounts of money we devote to enforcing drug laws and imprisoning non-violent drug offenders to voluntary drug rehab programs. That's a much more effective way to spend the money.   absolutely within the realm of the Congress   While I disagree with the judicial expansion of the interstate commerce clause to regulate drug sales that never pass state borders, I do recognize that it grants Congress the power to do so. I thought that my saying ""has no business"" clearly implied that I meant ""shouldn't."" I also said ""serious crimes"" to imply that I don't think possession, ingestion, etc. are actions worthy of being labeled as criminal. I don't mean to insult you, but you seem to have neglected your reading comprehension skills.   because they fried too many drug cells   You seem to be implying that you think we should punish the people who only harm themselves with their drug use, using the people who harm others as a justification for doing so. By that, I mean you seem to think that we should punish all drug users so that we can punish those who harm other people. I strongly disagree with that notion. You might as well say we should ban all guns and imprison gun owners just because a few idiots shoot people (whether intentionally or not). Better yet, let's allow some guns (pharmaceuticals), but let's ban assault rifles and fully automatic guns (cannabis, cocaine, LSD, etc.), because those don't have any acceptable uses.  Banning drugs and imprisoning the users hasn't stopped the people around the users from getting hurt. You need to realize that legalizing or at least decriminalizing drugs does not equate to condoning drug use. Doing so only acknowledges that the methods we've used in the drug war haven't been effective.   When you are addicted to a substance, that is no longer a choice; if it was you wouldn't need rehab centers.   Getting help with your addiction is the choice. Doing drugs in the first place was a choice. It's not the government's place to be making these life choices for people. If those people choose to use drugs, then become addicted, and choose not to seek help, that's tragic, but it's their decision.   Have you ever been into a NICU (Neonatal ICU) unit. I worked at a hospital years ago and had to go in the NICU a few times for tech support. More than half of the babies in their were premature and addicted to crack.   I won't dismiss your anecdote. I'll plainly acknowledge that babies born into addiction represent a real problem. The solution, however, is healthcare. We need to get everyone insured, and we need to provide rehab assistance to pregnant women who are addicted to drugs. This is a health issue, not a legal one.   If you break the law you are a real criminal.   Speeding is against the law. I'd hardly call someone who travels one mile per hour above the speed limit a real criminal.   As far as the overcrowding is concerned, execute the prisoners on death row and those convicted of murder. Stiffen the penalties of other crimes so that hopefully a would be criminal would think twice before committing a crime.   I really don't want to get into a debate on the death penalty, but the government shouldn't be killing its citizens when they're incarcerated and no longer a threat to the public. Some crimes may never be forgiven, but we should always allow criminals the opportunity to atone and make reparations.  As for stiffening the penalties, we have hard data that show that that's ineffective. We need only look to the death penalty, again, to see that it's not a deterrent.   Dealing drugs and drug use is not victim-less.   That's not at all what I've been saying. What I've been saying is that we can address these problems through more effective means than incarceration. The drug war has been a complete and utter failure. It has served only to line the pockets of policing agencies and dealers on the black market, get a whole lot of cops and innocent bystanders killed, and lock away people who only harm themselves. We need to regulate drugs in a way that undercuts the black market; we can address most of our drug problems through capitalism."

Clearly this argument fails because there are other reasons why black people are jailed. As per Wiki many theories are out there to explain disproportionate incarceration rates, such conflict theory, strain theory, social disorganization theory, macrostructural opportunity theory, social control theory, sub culture of violence theory, and prosecutorial and police discrimination theory. There are probably more theories. The point here though is one can not assert without further evidence that higher incarceration rates imply prosecutorial and police discrimination.  Yet we see mob violence stating this very thing every time there is a Ferguson or Trayvon Martin.   So there is wide support for this logically flawed argument with a political bias, that people do not naturally reject without any training. Even when the logical flaws are pointed out, some still cling to this argument. I think there is no basic defense mechanism against faulty logic other than training in logic.

Personally I am fine with whatever consensual relationship adults have between themselves as long as it does not adversely impact children or result in one member being trapped and abused.

I think visitation rights in hospitals need to be revisited. Personally I am firmly committed to my heterosexual marriage."

I don't like defaulting to Biblical morality as the 'be-all end-all' of what's acceptable since there are so many things in the Bible that are clearly unacceptable in today's society.  Lets limit marriage to only two people of whatever gender.  I doubt anybody is seriously interested in pushing polygamy.  If there are, the only reason they would receive any attention about it is because the media is interested in the novelty of it."
conservatives,3dev17,Clay_Statue,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"I am not sure you can do it. Once you abandon the standard of marriage that has been in place for thousands of years, you can not arbitrarily impose a new standard. The gate is wide open. In fact Father Abraham of the bible had multiple wives and there is historical instances of that going way back as perfectly normal, and some parts of the Mormon faith truly believe in the sanctity of plural marriage. If we are to say dignity is a reason for opening marriage to homosexuals, then who are we do deny that very same dignity to polygamists?  Arguments based upon small numbers of people seem largely discarded in the case of transgenders, who comprise a very small portion of the population, but are driving bathroom policy in several states.   This is the slippery slope. As we extend dignity to ever more bizarre and rare consensual adult relationships, the dignity of marriage itself comes into question. Perhaps just reserving ""marriage"" for traditional marriage, letting churches decide for themselves what that means, and have the government base its decisions upon secular unions of which traditional marriage is recognized is the way to go. But we can not go that way because the Supreme Court said government defines marriage."

Truth be told, if enough polygamists rally around the cause of plural marriage it will become a thing.  That's the nature of politics, its a mass movement type of deal.  Since 1/10 people (roughly) are homosexual, that is a considerable block of the population.  Polygamists are a distinct minority, much smaller than the gay community.  I doubt that enough people will become interested in plural marriages to make this a political issue in our lifetimes.

conservatives,3dd5jb,fissionman1,3,Wed Jul 15 12:34:46 2015 UTC,"When you cite massive inequalities, you need to put it in context. Even if you buy into the leftist notion that income inequality is bad, the USA is 41st on the list using the Gini index. But I am not going to buy into your assumption that income inequality is bad.  You see, in a capitalist society like the USA we see ample examples of rags to riches stories. Just watch Shark Tank sometime. This proves that it is possible to reach the top through hard work and determination. There are no barriers to success in this country like there are in other countries. This is a huge distinction the US holds over much of the rest of the world where you must bribe your way to be permitted to succeed.   We also have universal education through high school that is free. In nations like Belize, your free education ends after 8 years. You have to pay your way through high school. How you start in life in places like Belize matters more because your basic education is a function of your start, not like it is in the USA.  So the USA has it much much better than the rest of the world, and people come here for that reason. When you look at income inequality in the USA where we have free public education through high school and no barriers to business we have to ask a different question.  What are the differences between the poor that succeed and the poor that do not succeed in the USA? Clearly both have the same starting point (poor). Clearly both have the same unfettered opportunity of free public education. What is the difference here?  I think you will find the core of the problem here is a values one. Some do not value working hard, putting off gratification, gaining skills of marketable value. Some do. Those who do eventually get out. Those who do not usually remain where they are.  Rather than push hard to change the values of those in the lowest economic tiers, the left does the exact opposite. They blame those who succeed for the plight of those who do not attempt to succeed. If you redistribute income from those who work hard to get ahead to those who do not, you encourage more people to lay around and do nothing, and complain about income inequality.  Schools are vehicles for changing values. When I see teachers putting people into groups and assigning a grade based upon the groups success, they encourage some to loaf and grade leech off of those who do not. When I see teachers de-emphasize testing and other objective individual measures of accomplishment, they remove accountability for one's own academic performance.  Were teachers instead to look to the successful and make a study of why those people succeeded, they would hold up as example positive role models of success, and actually effect change in the value set of the poorest Americans.  So YES valuing success in school and holding it up as something to strive for rather than scapegoat is important, and giving that lesson to 10yrs is a good thing, and you might want to even start that lesson earlier than that."

When illegals coming into the US run a high chance of dying in the process, those in the US cannot work, cannot get government benefits, are guaranteed to be turned in by someone for the bounty, and will go to prison and forever be denied legal status in the US after begin caught - then illegal immigration will end."

Don't you think it is possible to secure the border without giving the gov't unlimited license for extra judicial killings?  I'm sure it must be possible without defaulting to shooting people dead in the desert.  The way you prescribe would certainly be effective, but at the cost of diminishing our own humanity."
conservatives,3dcg7t,Clay_Statue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"Dude... your zeal is borderline genocidal.   Dude, your hyperbole is hyperbolic.  Not even borderline.  Securing the border and deporting the people here illegally is not genocide.  Nobody dies unless they choose to.   Don't you think it is possible to secure the border without giving the gov't unlimited license for extra judicial killings?    Absolutely - but the drug cartels won't stop until they are up against forces they can't beat, even locally, and any border security requires an active component, or those determined enough will simply go around it.  By choice, I'd use multilayered fences, automated guns and land mines - that removes the human component from the decision, and keeps the casualties down to those that choose to die - but that requires congressional appropriations and a longer term plan.  We saw what happened with those with the 2006 border wall.   I'm sure it must be possible without defaulting to shooting people dead in the desert.   After the first few, word would get around.  There wouldn't be more."
conservatives,3dcg7t,keypuncher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:03 2015 UTC,"Dude, your hyperbole is hyperbolic. Not even borderline.   Okay you got me.  Sorry for referring to it as 'genocidal', that was over the top.  I just had the image of hunting people with guns and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  The appropriate amount of infrastructure along with surveillance drones should be sufficient to accomplish good results without causing undue amounts of harm.   but the drug cartels won't stop until they are up against forces they can't beat   Drug cartels cannot be stopped from importing their goods so long as American's appetite for drugs remains unabated.  A prison is probably the most secure place I can imagine and it isn't even possible to keep drugs out of that environment.  The sheer amount of money involved in the business will corrupt most people well enough to make sure the product gets through."

If they're willing to do that into the teeth of the army, that isn't exactly hunting.

Won't help unless there is an active component.   Drug cartels cannot be stopped from importing their goods so long as American's appetite for drugs remains unabated.   They'll always try to smuggle drugs in.  Right now they are doing a lot of it via illegals, and they are attacking the border patrol, sometimes with military weaponry, if the border patrol tries to intervene.  The next time they try that, and every time after, they need to be kicked back to the stone age.  It shouldn't take long for them to get the message."

conservatives,3dacip,ThePoliticalHat,7,Tue Jul 14 19:02:43 2015 UTC,What I found interesting about this is that two doctors have already said there is nothing wrong with him - yet the judge orders more counseling because he can't understand D'Souza.  Maybe the judge needs counseling.
conservatives,3dacip,keypuncher,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"If I remember right the Judge had a degree in psychology.  Also one of his other statements is most telling, that he often refers defendants to counseling for crimes which have no logical explanation.
