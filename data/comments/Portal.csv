Portal,3dm6a5,Heraga,10,Fri Jul 17 11:52:43 2015 UTC,"My advices:   Start learning hammer, create some small chambers and challenge yourself every time to improve yourself. Upload the maps to the workshop and try to get as much feedback as possible. Set realistic goals. You won't be able to make a 60-or-so level mod yourself, or with a small team. For Portal Stories we aimed to create 15 maps.  Start with the focus on maps/puzzles. The rest will come later! ;) The PTI is a great tool to prototype PUZZLES. DO NOT use the vmfs generated by the PTI as a base for your levels. They are over complicated, and very very chunky.   As for tips for hammer:   Disable radius culling.  Work on a size 8 or 16 grid. DO NOT use the vmfs the PTI can provide. Use fast compiles if you want to test game logic, you don't need fancy lighting if you test the basic puzzle. Always use the full final compile in the advanced compile settings if you want to test out lighting. If you make small brushwork that doesn't seal the level. Press CTRL+T on it to make it a func_detail.  After you have a rough idea of what you're doing in hammer; read this guide: http://www.optimization.interlopers.net/index.php?chapter=intro It's for Half-Life 2, but it is a great tutorial on how optimization works, and it mostly applies for Portal 2 too."

Portal,3ddlw1,WelshMullet,6,Wed Jul 15 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"The complaints about Mel aren't that they lack a tutorial in basic Portal mechanics, but that they lack a tutorial in the new mechanics the puzzles introduce.  Portal 2, by contrast, has ""too much"" tutorial because it was designed to be picked up by anyone without having played the first game, and recreated the entire tutorial from Portal for Chapter 1.  Mel could have skipped directly to the dual portal device; no one is complaining about a lack of ""re-training"" the basics of Portal. The problem some players are having is that Mel requires the use of certain mechanics to solve puzzles that could have been introduced in less complex environments prior to the puzzles themselves.  To take an example from Portal 2, in Wheatley Chamber 16, the developers found that playtesters would regularly falter on the first step in the solution (portaling to the other side of the chamber) because they were so focused on Chapter 8's new testing elements that they were over-complicating the puzzle solution and thinking they had to (for example) use an Excursion Funnel to get over there.  To solve this problem, the developers introduced a quick event prior to entering the chamber: a white gel pipe crashes into the hallway the player is in, splattering white gel on the wall in front of the gap and the floor beneath the player. The player, therefore, is forced to use a portalgun to cross the gap, effectively reminding the player of the primary function of the portalgun. This made solving Chamber 16, or at least the first step of it, easier to comprehend for playtesters.  Mel has no such mini-puzzles that ease the player into foreign concepts. Take, for example, the fact that certain puzzles require players to purposefully destroy cubes by using a button to request a new cube. To anyone who has played custom maps, this is a familiar concept that has been trained elsewhere. To anyone whose last experience was Portal 2, this is a completely alien concept that doesn't even occur to players. If there had been a quick mini-puzzle that required a cube request to solve it and nothing else, the more complex puzzles solved partially be cube requests would be much easier.  For that reason, a lot of players feel ""cheated"" or like they're using some quirk of logic to get past a chamber instead of solving it using familiar Portal logic. So, to answer your question, yes, it's perfectly possible to create a mod with a decent tutorial level. Mel could have done this by following in the path of Portal games and mappacks before it: introduce a new concept, complicate it in the next chamber, complicate it some more in the next, another new concept, then require players to mix the concepts they have learned in the following chamber... etc. Instead, it feels like no real thought was given to what the player was learning or retaining from one level to the next. That's what people are talking about with a lack of ""tutorial."""
Portal,3ddlw1,awkisopen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"So if one wanted to fully bring a player up to speed on all Portal 1 and 2 mechanics, how many chambers would be required? Could it be comfortably fit into say, 6-8, if you combine elements from the start? This is all hypothetical anyway, I figured making a tutorial was the best way to try mapping with a range of elements."
Portal,3ddlw1,awkisopen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:58:35 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to bring a player up to speed on Portal 1 and 2, that would take a pretty large number of chambers. At the bare minimum you'd need separate chambers to train:   What portals do (force a player to walk through a portal) Cube/button Cube through portal (the portal carousel does this for example) Test that forces player to both walk into and out of the static orange portal (the crossing-pit levels in both 1 and 2); needed to prevent players from thinking of one portal as an 'entrance' portal and the other as an 'exit' portal Flinging Emancipation grill as test element Laser through portal Laser through portal into reflector cube Laser toggle on/off required to solve test (GLaDOS Chamber 4 does this, for example) Laser relays Faith plate intro Faith plate fling into portal Light bridge intro Turret intro (w/ light bridge as turret blocker) Light bridge toggle on/off required to solve test (pull-the-rug does this, for example) Blue gel intro - retaining height Blue gel toggle on/off required to solve test (for example, painting a cube to get it to bounce off a button) Orange gel intro - gaining height through speed Blue/orange gel combination (orange ramp onto blue patch = travelling some distance) Conversion gel intro Excursion funnel intro Inverse funnel toggle"
Portal,3ddlw1,awkisopen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:24 2015 UTC,That is quite a bit to cover... hmm. I think I can fit a few elements into each chamber if it's a mod to portal 2... assuming they have at least played portal 2.
Portal,3ddlw1,ApertureBrowserCore,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"If it's a mod that requires Portal 2, I think you can safely assume the player has played Portal 2 and is up to speed on everything trained therein."
Portal,3ddlw1,konatals,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"All these are good points. One thing to keep in mind that one can incorporate multiple new elements into a single ""chamber"" before moving to the next one by breaking each ""chamber"" into sections. For example, in the first part, you could introduce lasers and how they interact with portals. Immediately afterwards, you could introduce the reflector cube. After that part of the chamber, combine the two concepts, and so on for whatever puzzle mechanics ""fit"" nicely together."
Portal,3ddr89,DaBoxedCube,3,Wed Jul 15 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"On a few occasions I'm pretty sure I abused the game, unless the developers intended for me to portalbump through a fizzler."
Portal,3ddr89,Stone_Crowbar,2,Wed Jul 15 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"like placing a cube at the edge of a portal in the ground to redirect a laser without the cube falling though   Hah, I think I did that too. (I want to go back and see if I can figure out what I should have done.)  There were a couple where I felt like I was being abusive. That was on the edge. Another was the one where there's a small room, pit of goo, a fizzler right at the edge of the far side, three buttons on the other side of the fizzler, and a cube dropper just in front. You can stand on the very edge of the button, disabling the fizzler, and with a maybe 5 or 10% success rate grab cubes as they fall. I need to go back to that one too. (Please no unmarked spoiler hints to that...)  What's really interesting to me is the second chamber of ""two of a kind"", which I did one way that felt completely intended at the time. But in a discussion yesterday someone said they did something different, and now I think that looks more like an intended solution. Videos: their way, my way Edit oh wait, that's the official playthrough. So I guess yes, that was the intended solution. ;-)"

Portal,3dbbtu,randomtroubledmind,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"Mel was incredibly well done. The voice acting was stellar, the story was good. The art and assets were superb. The level design... I wouldn't say the puzzles were just hard, they were obnoxiously hard. To the point where it stopped being enjoyable. In my opinion, when you finish a puzzle you should get that little ""ah"" moment, where you discover the thing that's been staring you in the face. With Mel, when I solved the puzzle, it was more like ""wow, glad that's over, now I get to do a harder one!"" I didn't feel like I solved a puzzle so much as discovered some really obscure trick.   Another thing I noticed was there were quite a number of deviations from Valve's ""rules"" regarding test chambers. (This next part will contain some minor spoilers) In many of the tests, you were required to intentionally destroy a cube by requesting one from the dropper or bringing it through a fizzler. In Vlave's tests, the ""request-new-cube"" button was only for if you messed up. I wasn't really ready for this trick, and I'm not sure I'm really in favor of it.   Another trick used in a place or two was shooting a light bridge through a cube to pop it off a button. I really didn't like this one. I feel like this is more an exploitation of a glitch, or rather, an exploit of a feature added to keep the game from breaking.   I also found myself relying on the autosave feature to see if I was actually doing the right thing or not. I also found the final boss fight to be very convoluted, contrived and not much fun. It didn't involve using portals in a clever way so much as just moving things around in a hostile environment. I felt like it was more HL2-ish than portal.   Now, I haven't played many custom maps. I've solved a few of Mevious's maps and completed 12 angry tests with ease. Maybe if I had done some more of these, I wouldn't have found Mel so difficult. That said, I still think there were a number of cheap tricks and obscure, hard-to-find stuff in there that killed much of the fun for me, which is a shame, because every other aspect was absolutely superb.   Anyway, thanks for the links, I'm going to check these out!"

Portal,3da8bg,Quacksnooze,16,Tue Jul 14 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. As I stated in another post, the learning curve is a brick wall with a slight tilt. It is by far the best community made mod of Portal 2 out there, but its design is flawed. I think this was either meant for people who are experts at solving these kinds of puzzles, or they didn't know about the difficulty curve for level design.  TL;DR I agree with you that it's hard."
Portal,3da8bg,SandwichSwagger,11,Tue Jul 14 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"The reason the game is hard is that it requires knowledge of mechanics that neither game EVER has you use. To list a few examples(spoilers for puzzle solutions if you haven't finished):   At least two puzzles require you to destroy a cube by requesting another. The one I can think of is the one room near the end of the game that is a little tiny cube with two lasers, a cube spawner, and an emancipation grid. You do some stuff with the lasers, and then after you're behind the grid, kill the cube, which lets you out the exit(which is also behind the grid). One puzzle requires you to get a cube wet with propulsion gel, then slide it down a slanted light bridge to disable three lasers for a split second while you run through some disabled instant-death barriers. Finally, the only one that stumped me for an extended period of time: in one puzzle, you have both types of funnels in the same puzzle: blue and orange. It's not one funnel that toggles between the two colors; it's two separate funnels. Anyway, to get out the door, you have ride a blue funnel across a long room, then near the end while you're still in the funnel, shoot another portal to switch its direction. This lets you head back to the start of the puzzle to request another cube, destroying a cube on a switch behind an emancipation grid and allowing you get two cubes to the exit buttons. This puzzle also has the rainbow core easter egg, if you're familiar.   There are a few other examples I can think of, like how you need to use propulsion gel to launch yourself into the air into a funnel, but those three are the ones that got me stuck the most. Especially the third one."
Portal,3da8bg,Quote_a,9,Wed Jul 15 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like they could have done a better job easing you into these mechanics, like Portal 1 or 2 did very excellently.  But I see your point."
Portal,3da8bg,SandwichSwagger,10,Wed Jul 15 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"I noticed a number of these. The intentionally destroying a cube trick really rubbed me the wrong way, because in the stock Valve maps, you would only request a new cube if you messed up.   I don't mind the sliding cube so much as the fact that the death-grids had a significant delay when re-energizing, and you really had no way of knowing that until you tried it, and it breaks continuity with standard functioning of things.   One that you didn't mention was one where I had to shoot a light bridge through a cube to lift it off a button. IMO, there's no way that should be legit. Now, maybe I solved the test wrong, but that was the only way I could figure it out. Don't know if other people encountered that one and had similar feelings.   Man, other than the level design/difficulty, the rest of it it just so well done. I really hate saying all this stuff about it, but I honestly can't say I had much fun doing the actual tests."

It's clearly a game for people who have been playing community maps for ages and think they're too easy, but in game there's no way Mel would be able to pick up a portal device without any fan fare and start using it. Kinda took me out of the experience a bit.  Never mind that the primitive portal device is just as functional as the newer ones. Did Aperture ever have limitations to overcome with these things? Why test something that worked flawlessly from day one?"
Portal,3d4hol,joealarson,5,Mon Jul 13 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had these same issues. It is by far the best community-made mod for Portal 2 out there, but the level design and story are flawed in a way that makes me not like it."
Portal,3d4hol,SandwichSwagger,2,Mon Jul 13 18:30:18 2015 UTC,"Did they ever say the primitive one was from day one? It's just an older design, no reason for it to be less functional. It's even labeled 'old faithful' on the plaque."
Portal,3d4hol,Suppafly,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose these could be considered plot holes, but most people playing it have already played Portal and Portal 2, so training maps would be a waste of time and I'm glad they didn't do them. It's a lot of fun and it was challenging. It also had a decent story, the normal community maps are fun, but they don't really have a story, it's just pure gameplay. I really like the way PS:Mel and community maps in general mix all the new game elements. In Portal 2 the new elements are mostly separate from each other. The most mixing is excursion funnels and goo."
Portal,3d4hol,jdmulloy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"It's kind of an endorsed mod. You should be able to find it, either by just searching it on Steam, or by looking at the Portal 2 page on Steam."

For example: sp_a1_tramride 3) Type in the console: 'changelevel yourmapname' without the quotation marks eg: 'changelevel sp_a1_tramride' 4) Press Enter 5) The level restarts, and the errors are gone!

I haven't loaded up the video but it might be interesting if they put annotations up at the start that you click to take you to specific levels.  But if all something is, is a walk through I much prefer guides on sites like Game FAQs because it's so much easier to just Ctrl+F for something than have to wait for some video to buffer and then find the specific point in the video... and then wait for it to buffer again, and then realize for some stupid reason YouTube auto set the resolution to 240p so you have to change the resolution and then wait for it to buffer again... to only find out that the person was confused what to do with that level and that they waste 5 minutes poking the same thing over and over again hoping that will solve some puzzle..."

You should upgrade - because your current setup sounds horrible!  3) You can set the default resolution YouTube plays at. Check it out :)  Again, having to wait for 'buffering' when the resolution changes isn't an issue to most people as it's instant.  4) My Walkthroughs are of a very high standard with no fucking around like getting lost etc. I get straight to the point in a controlled manner that I hope is easy and quick for people to follow.

Portal,3cor66,viccie211,7,Thu Jul 9 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"OK. You need the following things:   Decently Powerful PC Google Cardboard of some sort Wii Remote + Nunchuk Wii Remote Gun-Shaped Mount An ANDROID POWERED phone to use with the cardboard. Big, hi res screen is a must, and a good battery is nice for extended usage. I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Headphones (not technically needed, but reccomended) A copy of TriDef 3D ($40) A copy of Trinus VR ($6) A copy of GlovePIE and the CHELL VR script Windows. I'm primarily a Mac user, but windows is needed for Tridef and TrinusVR. Portal 2, or whatever you want to play (duh!)   Start by installing TriDef. I trust you know how to install software, so I won’t explain how to click next 40,000 times. Once you start TriDef Ignition (or click “Play 3D Games” in the main TriDef 3D app), it will scan your Steam library, and you’ll want to double click portal 2. It will load, but TriDef isn’t done yet! You should see the game full screen, only shown twice, one on each side of the screen. Head into the settings and lower the resolution to something more streamable like 720p, then set the game to Windowed Mode WITH NO BORDER (if you use a border, it will appear in your headset). It will work, but you’ll get a notice saying the you need to go back to fullscreen to use 3D. Quit out of the game and head to this link (without quotes): “http://d14uirtqdv8v7.cloudfront.net/software/beta/TriDef-3D-Ignore-Requires-Fullscreen.zip”. Close TriDef Ignition. Extract the archive and install the registry key file. Open TriDef Ignition. Double click on Portal 2. You should see the game start in a borderless, 720p window with the 3D side-by-side. Close the game, and now we’ll move on to installing Trinus VR. First, take your Android phone and install the Trinus VR app. Get the lite version for now, best not to waste your money if the app just don’t work. The only limitation is that you can only play for around 10-15 minutes before it kicks you back to the menu. There is also a “DEMO” watermark that appears after 5 minutes. Don’t start it yet, we haven’t installed the server yet. Grab your PC, and install the free server application from http://trinusvr.com. Load that up, and your PC should create a WiFi network called trinus, with the password “mypassword”. Keep in mind that if your PC connects to the internet over WiFi, you won’t have internet access while running Trinus. Connect your phone to the Trinus network. Make sure to turn off your Mobile Data in settings, so that if your PC picks that exact moment to install a 999999GB Windows Service Pack or sync a large Dropbox file, it won’t kill your phone’s data cap. You should take a moment now to go into Advanced mode on the Trinus server, despite it looking like the GUI was written in 1992, it is far more powerful and not as intimidating as the name might suggest. Change the quality to strike a good balance between high frame rates and non-hideous compression (I like Low or Normal, but your preference may vary). You will also want to set the video mode to Compatible, as no matter how hard I tried I could not make Fast work. Now that you have a pretty good basic configuration, whip out the phone and finally hit that big tempting start button in the Trinus app. Quickly press start on the desktop app, and if you have things set up correctly, you should see the Trinus server on the phone. Click the portal window, and with any luck you should see that on the phone. You have the option to stop here if you want, as you don’t NEED the Wii Remote. If you want to continue, why not take a break and snack on some Aperture Science Dietary Pudding and Gel Removal Water Substitute? Done snacking on imaginary foods? Good. Start up the game, throw the phone in yer headset, and give it a test (hahahaha, test, get it, portal? no? nevermind.) You may have to look straight up or straight down to get the head tracking calibrated. At this point you’ll still be using the normal keyboard, but have a walk around and check out your new VR game! After you’ve stopped repeatedly trapping yourself in infinite loops and running around on gels, it’s time to get back to work, we’re not done yet! Now’s when you get to set up the cool Wii Remote controls you saw in my video. Grab GlovePIE from glovepie.org, start up GlovePie. Grab the C.H.E.L.L script, and copypaste it in. Hit the run button. Now we must pair the remote with the PC. Basically, you need to pop off the battery cover, hit reset, and start holding 1 and 2 on the remote. With your other hand go to Add Device on windows (making sure Bluetooth is turned on and the dongle is plugged in if you’re on a desktop), and select NINTENDO-RVL-CNT-01. Choose pair without a code, then go down to your tray and skip installing from Windows Update (it won’t have it anyway). The wii remote LEDs should stop flashing, and hopefully change to showing the first one from the left on and the rest off. This can take a few tries, just be patient. If you become frustrated, please do not burn your PC to a crisp using combustible lemons. This can be a little tricky, but once the devices are paired you should be good for the future. To connect in the future, just hold 1 and 2 until it connects. If you understand GlovePIE, feel free to modify the script to suit your needs. Return to portal, start TrinusVR, connect up, grab your NWHPD (Nintendo Wii Handheld Portal Device), and if you’ve done it right you should have Portal 2 with CHELL VR system running. Celebrate with appropriate amounts of cake, virtual or real."

That the door that usually leads to an elevator doesn't actually lead to an elevator until you complete the map (or trigger the button with a cube at least).

Portal,3c3szu,Valridagan,2,Sat Jul 4 19:47:57 2015 UTC,There's a good 2-part series on Youtube that's a very quick playthrough of PS:M.  It's easy to find the part you're stuck at and get a hint/solution for it.

Portal,3c3szu,AvidLebon,5,Sun Jul 5 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"I see they're looking for a Rattman model. I (a modeler and animator) have wanted to work on a story driven mod, but I can't find out anything about this person or their past games. Wish I could see if this dev is experienced/legit.  Edit: Found their steam profile. I don't see any prior workshop items for ANY game, and it looks like they haven't used the authoring software more than 13 hours. Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but if I'm right then it's probably their first Portal mod. Argh."
Portal,3c3szu,ThePaSch,3,Sat Jul 4 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm working on a short, story-driven Co-Op level pack (since there seem to be next to none of those out there); in fact, I've only recently started working on it. I am about a week in, and the first chamber is slowly reaching preliminary completion (in terms of the puzzle and rough environmental design). Here are a few screenshots of the chamber's current state, for reference.  I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, seeing as this isn't going to be a mod per-se, just a series of levels (planned are 10 chambers + BTS intro/outro) for use with the base game; plus, I'm also not sure if there's going to be any dire need for custom assets as far as the plan goes.  But, y'know. Just in case you're interested and wish to follow the pack's progress, hit me up with a message and I'll give you my Steam details.  Disclosure: I have not shipped a game or mod for any game before. As of this moment, I have 250 hours in the Portal 2 Creation Kit (+another 50 or so in the Alien Swarm SDK, which was used to map for Portal 2 before the official creation tools were released), and another 182 hours in the Source SDK, most of them spent learning and practicing.  I also can't pay you, but seeing as you specifically said that you are looking to work on a mod, I'm assuming you weren't expecting to be paid in the first place (since mod jobs are rarely paid)."
Portal,3c3szu,Xenidae,2,Mon Jul 6 11:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's me, I'm the one making the mod.  I am definitely not the most experienced mod maker, but I do know my way around the map making tool Hammer and if there are things that I don't know (which there's sure to be a few), I am happy to learn. Thanks for showing interest in the model and I totally understand if you don't want to because I'm inexperienced. But, come back and look at it in a few months. If you like what you see then it would be great if you'd make the model, if you don't, then I'd totally understand.  EDIT: I have used Hammer longer then 13 it's just I only started the Portal Authoring Tools  to open it quite recently."

Portal,3c4maa,ApertureBrowserCore,3,Sat Jul 4 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"I would be inclined to believe a miniseries (or 2) would be the best way to tell the story. I'm not familiar with Sherlock, but in my mind, having a dozen or so episodes would give lots of time to tell the story. It would also give the writers a definite time frame to stick to, without having to worry about how many seasons they have before Fox unexpectedly drops the show or having to drag it on for far too long and ruining the story.   Depending on how in depth they wanted to go, they could do 3 miniseries: Portal, Portal:Origins and/or Portal:The Rattmann Chronicles; dealing with the Portal/Portal2 storyline, the beginning of Aperture Science, and Ratman's story, respectively. Or something like that.... Someone far more creative than me could probably do some very cool things given a few 6-12hour miniseries."

Speed running the chamber in 5 minutes followed by 40 minutes of weeping and trying to convince herself to throw the weighted companion cube into the incinerator. Just as you think she will go through with it, she leaps into the incinerator, sacrificing herself so the cube can live. Ominous music plays as the camera zooms in on the cube while fading to black. Run credits.  Alternate ending: after struggling with the decision to incinerate the cube, she pulls it in for a passionate embrace and pulls out a gun. As the camera pans out, a single shot rings out followed by the thump of a body hitting the floor. Cut to credits."

We've had many for Portal (Portal Pro, Rexaura, Blue Portals, Portal: Prelude, Gamma Energy and the upcoming Portal: Outside Influence) but Mel is a new milestone.  Also, it's good. Really really challenging and good. For best results, play it after playing some other custom maps so you can get into the mindset required to deal with certain new concepts being thrown at you.

Portal,3bnbo8,hemenex,13,Tue Jun 30 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"The trick to these things, if anyone cares, is to count the number of lines coming out of intersection. If there are exactly 0 or 2 odd-numbered intersections, then you can draw the thing without lifting your pen. If there are 0 odd-numbered intersections, you start anywhere and finish in the same spot. If there are 2 odd-numbered intersections (like for this house) you start at one of them and end at the other.  This works because for every point on the drawing, unless it is a starting or ending point, you obviously have to come into it and leave it again, so that all the lines at that point are paired."

Portal,3bnbo8,matthi1,2,Tue Jun 30 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Eulerian path:       In graph theory, a Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail which starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in 1736. Mathematically the problem can be stated like this:   Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a cycle, i.e. a path starting and ending on the same vertex) which visits each edge exactly once?   Euler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian circuits is that all vertices in the graph have an even degree, and stated without proof that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit. The first complete proof of this latter claim was published posthumously in 1873 by Carl Hierholzer.

Portal,3bhh6u,carminetruckyours,2,Mon Jun 29 15:56:38 2015 UTC,There was that one in THAW in Hollywood where you have to land in that building where a construction worker is dancing in front of a goat.

Portal,3bhh6u,stinky_cheese_dude,2,Tue Jun 30 02:58:42 2015 UTC,No! But know I want to play it again just for it.

Portal,3bhh6u,GinkoWeed,2,Mon Jun 29 16:59:48 2015 UTC,There's goats that I know of in underbounce and once upon as well (chambers 1 and 2 in the underground enrichment spheres). Both are on top of the second half of the chamber. I'll have to get screenshots.
Portal,3bhh6u,silentclowd,2,Mon Jun 29 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Wait, what is Portal Stories: Mel? I feel like I'm missing something."
Portal,3bhh6u,GinkoWeed,3,Mon Jun 29 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Portal Stories: Mel   To quote the steam page that I just found by googling:   Portal Stories: Mel is a community made, free modification for Portal 2 based in the Portal universe. It tells the story of Mel, who meets a new personality core and faces an undiscovered threat to the Aperture facility."

Portal,3bhh6u,phamily_man,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:04:05 2015 UTC,Just search Portal Stories: Mel in the store
Portal,3bhh6u,silentclowd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:13:44 2015 UTC,I saw that earlier but I'm unclear ... is it new maps and voice recordings made by modifiers?
