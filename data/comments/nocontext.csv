nocontext,3e1fzz,PlasmaBurst,11,Tue Jul 21 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"Did someone mention vultures? Here's a random fact!  When threatened, vultures vomit to lighten their body weight so they can escape more easily into flight. Vomiting also serves as a defense mechanism to deter predators that may be threatening the birds."
nocontext,3e1fzz,Tetragrade,7,Tue Jul 21 16:53:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you, vulture facts! I think I might actually use this when someone is threatening me."
nocontext,3e1fzz,PlasmaBurst,6,Tue Jul 21 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"How about this: next time you are being threatened by somebody, pull your pants down, and shit on your feet, (or theirs; That works too). I guarantee that they will lose all interest in attacking you."
