There are no formalwear occasions, or 'no loitering' signs, or prostate exams, or any of the million things life thrusts upon us that we'd rather not do. Sheep go about eating, shitting and fucking without a care in the world.."

sfw_wtf,37w3x3,ReyRey5280,3,Sat May 30 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"There was a wildlife rehab near where I grew up that had a ""zoo"" like this... they kept local wildlife that needed special care until they could be released. It was free to visit. They had racoons, deer, local snakes, squirrels, groundhogs, owls, hawks, etc."
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,jaya9581,3,Sat May 30 22:45:08 2015 UTC,They are exotic animals in many parts of the world.
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,brainburger,2,Sun May 31 11:30:01 2015 UTC,"seriously, what kind of shit zoo is that?"
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,Woolford,3,Sat May 30 23:19:44 2015 UTC,One in a country that doesn't have raccoons?

sfw_wtf,37w3x3,Woolford,6,Sun May 31 01:35:15 2015 UTC,...it's a couple of raccoons...  am I the only one that doesn't see much wrong with the parenting here?
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,Seatb3lt,6,Sat May 30 23:03:46 2015 UTC,"Although raccoons are typically docile, they can be nasty and violent. This is absolutely shitty parenting."
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,green_and_yellow,2,Sun May 31 18:46:08 2015 UTC,the fact that you don't see much wrong here is pretty concerning if you're planning to have kids

sfw_wtf,37w3x3,acidnine420,0,Sun May 31 00:06:34 2015 UTC,They usually are very docile if raised in captivity.  Just search pet raccoon on YouTube.
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,Moos_Mumsy,3,Sun May 31 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"And if the child falls in and gets hurt, the parent will sue and claim that the Zoo didn't provide proper fencing or signage.  Because it's never the parents fault."
sfw_wtf,37w3x3,Xavs42,2,Sun May 31 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"This probably isn't in the US, so I feel litigation is much less likely.   Especially if they're the type of parents to hold their child by the ankles over a raccoon enclosure."
