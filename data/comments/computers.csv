I feel that this would be a good addition to a security suite, not a replacement to an antivirus installed directly on a computer. Realistically though, you get the same protection from a hardware firewall that you buy once.  It's also a subscription based firmware change to your router, meaning that if you decide to stop using their service you then need to clear their firmware from your router and revert to the original.   Lastly, a lot of the features it provides are readily available on consumer routers, like the notification of new devices on the network and the dashboard of internet events, so you might just be paying for a cloud-based version of something you already have.  TL;DR: Cool concept, but doesn't provide enough security for its monthly cost and some of its features are already built into routers"

If you're really interested wait a while and see what people think if anyone buys it, otherwise look elsewhere.  Malwarebytes Anti-malware is a good passive or active option depending on whether you buy a 3 PC 1yr license or not.  Anti-exploit added to that as well blocks so many exploits without a dictionary (the ""definitions"" it downloads to help it find things) that makers of the popular malware kit Angler have given up on attacking PC's with it installed.

The AMD firepro cards perform better for your dollar than the NVIDIA Quadros. Get an actual  workstation video card, certain features only work on the  workstation cards. They are optimized for opengl not directx.  8gb of ram is likely enough, I suggested he get 16gb. He decided to Max it out at 32gb. SSD with a spinning backup drive is a good way to go. He went with a SSD boot and work drive with dual 1tb for redundant storage. Still deciding on backup solutions.  For SSD brands I am picky. Intel has always been strong in my heart but not in the wallet. I went for a Samsung 840 EVO. I would not recommend a Shamesung again.

I'm particularly confused here:   I plug the new power supply in and the monitor won't work with this power supply in, but it would work with the old power supply in.   It seems like you have a desktop with a separate monitor. The monitor has its own power cord, yes? So it sounds like the problem is maybe that the graphics card wasn't powered properly and the monitor wasn't getting a signal, but the rest of the computer was on? Then when you tried reinstalling, the computer wouldn't power on at all?  It sounds like your power supply may have been a lemon, assuming that you are confident that you made no mistakes with either installation. If this is the case, I would get another power supply. The 500W supply ought to be enough for that graphics card, but importantly the graphics card isn't the only power draw on the system, and there's more to it than just the wattage; also, different companies have different standards and they don't always deliver the listed wattage. Here is a calculator if you want to plug everything in to make sure that your card is up to snuff.

Purchase and install the 64GB ssd and install windows, drivers and updates like you would normally do. ( I recommend disconnecting all of your other hard drives so you don't confuse yourself when you set up windows on the new drive. After windows installs, you can reconnect them) For all of your media files documents and pictures etc on the 1TB drive, you can browse to it, and create shortcuts linking to your desktop for them. Or under the startmenu (if we are using Win 7), you can right click on My Documents, Pictures, Music and under properties change their library locations. (change them to the 1TB drive and respected locations. Instead of c:\Libraries\Pictures, c:\Libraries\Videos - it would be d:\Libraries\Pictures, d:\Libraries\Videos. or what ever the drive is lettered) Games. Both the 250ssd and the 2TB SSHD... If you have Steam games, moving a steam Library is easy. 1. Exit the Steam client application. 2. Browse to the Steam installation folder for the Steam installation you would like to move (C:\Program Files\Steam by default). 3. Delete all of the files and folders except the SteamApps folder and Steam.exe 4. Cut and paste the whole Steam folder to the new location, for example: D:\Games\Steam\ 5. Launch Steam and log into your account. If steam is currently installed on the 250, you can follow #3 and #5. It will launch directly from that directory, you can create a shortcut to your desktop and launch from there as well. Steam Instructions If the 250 is your current OS drive, after you install the new Os on the 64GB ssd, you can go and meticulously delete files you don't need. Just make sure you backup anything that is important first Research and see how to migrate or copy third party games to a different directory. If it seems to complicated, reinstalling them will be easier in the long run. Just remember to choose the proper hard drive you want to install to. Also, if you play offline single player games, research how to backup your saves if needed. Each game is different.     Any other questions, please ask!"

Why are you getting a separate network adapter? You have TWO network ports on that motherboard.  Make sure you know what you're getting into with a Full Tower Case. They are big, bulky, and you aren't putting much in it. It's fine if you want to upgrade later but you could probably get away with a much smaller case and not throw out your back lugging a big awkward thing around. Case is pretty subjective though.

computers,3dwtr0,Ardouos,2,Mon Jul 20 11:39:31 2015 UTC,"I would say no, due to a lot of factors.  Number one, the main reason desktops have such a long lifespan is because every part is (reasonably) easy to upgrade. In laptops sometimes you can upgrade ram and cd drive maybe, but never to the extent that desktops can because on laptops most parts are simply soldered on to save space, so replacing them is nearly impossible  Number two, because laptops are portables they're a lot more susceptible to accidental drops and other damage. One good drop on a laptop can fry it, whereas a desktop really doesn't move all that often.  And number three, the parts on laptops wear out faster. Most laptops cut out a ton of things to save space. The keyboard for example, most have scissor type switches made of plastic, after years of use I find myself having to replace at least a few. But keyboards are fixable, what's a bit harder to fix are heat sinks and bad motherboards. These parts, properly ventilated or not, are running at a much higher temperature from being so cramped, and no matter how lightly you run it, the clocks ticking on it. The part most affected by heat is the processor, and if it dies, it's like a totaled car.   So to answer your question, no, you likely won't find a laptop with a longer life span than a desktop. But you can get pretty damn close, look into sager/Clevo laptops and laptops with interchangeable internals. You sacrifice a lot of the portability, but these babies will last you a pretty good while."

computers,3dwtr0,Colbion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you could definitely get a laptop to last as long as a desktop with proper ventilation and regular dust removal."
computers,3dwtr0,nyanmatt125,2,Tue Jul 21 05:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   Yes: don't drop it, proper ventilation, upgradable RAM needs to be an option, don't be too rough, find a reputable company and go for a slightly higher end model, not the most expensive tier but 1 or 2 tiers lower(depending on the number of tiers). I personally have a mid-2009 MBP that I needed to upgrade the RAM for but runs perfectly fine on latest OS and used for development/programming.   No: regardless of what you do laptops just degrade faster because they are typically bought so you can do work anywhere at anytime, and therefore just get more use. In a 'by hour' usage it may be the same for laptop and desktop, but the desktop will probably see less daily use than the laptop will. So the laptop will probably give out first."

I put the poor HP Pavilion through heady daily usage in high school but it was always kept on a desk with a plastic stand to provide maximum air flow. I kept software clean with firewalls and programs like CCleaner. However, once that laptop was done working 6 years later- it was done. If I had a 6-year-old desktop instead, I would have had the option to upgrade some hardware, thus, extending the computers lifetime significantly."

First you would need to defrag the HDD, clean it from all unnecessary files and “junk” that can pile up, do a Disk Cleanup, run for viruses and malware. If it is larger than the SSD you should additionally slim it down not just enough to fit the SSD but also to have some more free space. Then you do the cloning.  If you have OS on the HDD but don't insist on cloning it, then do a fresh install onto the SSD, connect the HDD as secondary, set BIOS to boot from the SSD and just access the HDD through Mu Computer to copy paste the files you need.

Then, I would boot from a live USB that has Macrium Reflect on it. Then, clone the HDD to the SSD. After the clone i would run the Windows boot tool on the SSD partition that has the Windows installation on it (the tool is found in the Macrium Reflect program, I forget exactly where it's at, but it's on there). Then, I would shutdown and remove the HDD from the system and try to boot from the SSD.

The logic to interleave the ram and turn them into dual/triple/quad channel is all in the memory controller which is now built into cpus.

Ddr-1333 would also work but that's slower and not much cheaper so it wouldn't name much sense. Sounds like your computer manufacturer shipped cheaped out and sent you the slower ram. Also keep in mind you need ddr3l which is lower voltage and runs at 1.35v instead of normal. And double check that you're buying sodimms instead of larger desktop dimms that won't fit.

computers,3dtfli,BloopBloopBloop957,2,Sun Jul 19 07:42:56 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, as asked:  No, absolutely not.  Cancelling a download can have no possible affect on a computer's memory.  However, from the comment you appended, it's clear that there's a misunderstanding.  Computer memory and hard drive storage capacity are two completely different, unrelated (but frequently confused) things.    Starting, and then cancelling downloads of large files can impact your hard drive's storage capacity.  Generally, when you download large files, and particularly software installation packages, the downloaded data is first stored in a temporary file on the hard drive until the download is complete, and the new, complete file named and placed wherever you specified at the start of the download.  If you cancel the download before it's complete, you'll end up with whatever portion that was downloaded stranded in a ""temporary"" download folder, where it remains until manually deleted.  (Completing the download and running the installation will normally clean up any temporary files as part of the setup process, at least for properly designed and coded programs.)  One fix, at this point, would be to find and manually delete those download remnants.  The specific location(s) of these download remnants depends upon your operating system, which you've kept to yourself, so I can't be anymore specific.    As for the one game that was installed and then uninstalled, and now won't reinstall - this may have nothing at all to do with hard drive storage capacity.  It could be that uninstalling the game left bits and pieces of itself behind that are preventing its re-installation.  It could even be that the license for the game installer package permitted only a single, one-time installation, and its installer was so coded.  What specific error message do you get when trying to re-install it?"

These programs are dead last in protectiveness and effectiveness and are consistently rated this way across many tests. Even Microsoft themselves have released press statements not to use defender or mse as your primary av solution.   If you want to stick with free Avira has been getting exceptional ratings lately. Its what i use on all my personal ccomputers. Avast is not far behind. Just be prepared to be bombarded with ads if you decide to go with a free one.   Also make sure you completely remove mcafee before you install anything. Remove it from programs and features, reboot, then run the mcpr tool mcafee provides to remove the remnants then reboot again.

computers,3dr45a,TsuDoughNym,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:36 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not just me. Start with the Amazon review page for the Anywhere MX. The top review for the MX2 (which I was checking out) was essentially ""this is a good mouse, but is the 1 year warranty because it's going to do exactly what my MX did?"" Also, a quick trawl of the logitech forums for double click or phantom left click shows any number of people reporting the same thing.  The mouse is great otherwise, so it's a shame this holds it back. If it's a defect, then I'd love to get my hands on one that escaped it and actually lasted, but I'm 0 for, I don't know, 4 or 5.  I don't pretend to know all about the problem -- maybe mice from before some change in manufacturing didn't have the problem.  Honestly, if Logitech would just make exactly the same mouse but without the problem so I didn't have to keep replacing, I'd gladly pay full price for it again."
computers,3dr45a,TsuDoughNym,2,Sun Jul 19 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"That really does suck :(  Hope you have better luck moving forward.  For what it's worth, I have an M510 and M705 mouse, and have had no issues.  Haven't had the MX line yet but maybe the higher end ones are more prone to failure?"

I know the 6670 is powered over the PCI slot, but the GTS 450 needs direct power from the power supply. You need to wire up the 6-pin power connector visible here.

So imagine picture number 2 where all the red stripes take the foreground, the green is even with the rest of the webpage, and the blue and black all drop into the background. The blue is the best, because the way the soldiers become more blue as they move towards the background, which increases the depth. This is the perfect picture for this effect."

computers,3ds5a1,LonestarPSD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:29:08 2015 UTC,It is a good one to do. But with modern installers you tend to know what programs will run on startup since they ask you. Unless OP meant startup services.msc which I dont think they did.

computers,3dp3js,SkittlesDLX,4,Sat Jul 18 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"The video editing is going to be the big downfall. You can use WeVideo, but it isn't the full-featured heavy video editor that you could get on a Windows machine. Depending on how tech-savvy you are, it would be possible to do a bit of messing around with your Chromebook and install a video editor, but that would get very complicated, very fast. If the video editing isn't essential, I'd say go for it; get a Chromebook. Or, if you would rather have a new, non-Chromebook laptop (that could maybe edit video), some Windows machines exist in the price range of Chromebooks."
computers,3dp3js,bookgeek001,2,Sat Jul 18 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, a Chromebook is basically a dedicated web browser. It should be fine if you just need internet access and Google Drive, but I doubt it could do video editing."
computers,3dp3js,MarkusGordathian,2,Sat Jul 18 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"A thought: at my school we had computer labs with pretty decent video editing software and pretty beefy hardware. If you are going to be editing videos constantly it might make sense to get your own device, but if you only plan to edit the occasional video, you might be able to avoid spending the money and just get a chromebook."

computers,3dnuz9,xHyro,13,Fri Jul 17 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"They don't ""mean"" anything. There are a few possibilities: 1. Your screen is dying. 2. The cable between your graphics card and screen is dying. 3. Your graphics card is dying. I think it's option 1. It looks as if there has been too much pressure on the screen itself or the bezel above it and some pixels are broken now. This isn't something you can fix easily by yourself, so I'd suggest you take the laptop to a specialist. If your are certain you did not put too much pressure on the screen, you could do a warranty claim."

If the person who made it made it low res  there's nothing you can do to make it better looking. This is also true for frame rate which is set by the creator.
