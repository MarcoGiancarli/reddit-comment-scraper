I recently read the book, and actually was upset, because the book is great! It's an awesome, essentially drama-less count of her year in prison. It gives insight into what she had to do to get by. It's not a drama. It's just a memoir."
orangeisthenewblack,3e2hf5,trashangel,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"There are a few more similarities than that.  Basically the backstory of Piper and her lesbian lover moving money for a drug kingpin was all true.  But in reality, she and ""Alex"" weren't even in the same prison.  But yeah, for the most part, the rest of the book was totally different.  What I prefer about the show is there's more backstory about other characters.  In Kerman's novel, it's clear that she's the star and everyone else is a supporting character (which of course makes sense because it's a memoir), which I got a little bored with because of all the women we hear about, she's one of the most boring.  So I prefer the show where we get to go a lot more in depth into the backstories of other characters."

I can't say this next sentence without sounding horribly pretentious, but: As a drama it appeals to the majority of people, but I personally was super excited for an account of realistic prison drama. I do like how the other characters have backstories too though. Norma's has been my favorite and I totally cried. On the other hand, I can't help but laugh when people complain that Piper gets most of the attention. Yes, correct. The story is from her perspective."

orangeisthenewblack,3dwk87,buddhacharm,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:15 2015 UTC,"Three is tough. I guess I'd say Piper, Taystee, and Red.  In the conventional way - Piper, Nicky, Crazy Eyes, Yoga Jones, and Sister Jean just come from a different social class and have a different level of book knowledge than the rest.   Red, Vee, Rosa, and Gloria are traditional street smart archetypes.  Taystee is brilliant. I think of Poussey as smart, but the Season 3 turn towards superstition seems kind of out of character to me.  In Piper's world outside of prison, most of those people would probably qualify for a mention."

How she's alive after snitching on the entire prison with that radio show in season 1 I have no idea.  The nun actually studied religion, so she was the only one who was able to convince the rabbi to let them eat kosher the first time around.  Yoga Jones ran a business on the outside.  I think she's pretty bright.    The people who understand the politics of this environment and live pretty smoothly would be people like Taystee and Red."

Also being shot with a shotgun on in short distance, that might be pretty serious, since shotguns can kill pretty big animals."

orangeisthenewblack,3dtm28,Sodabot300,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:07 2015 UTC,Totally forgot about that. Maybe it is just an attempted murder. But we don't know when she sentenced. Probably early 2000's late 90's if so she has been there over 10 years.

It seems by the type of clothes they wore during episode 1 season 1, it was the Autumn season (the trees were changing color).  It seems as season 3 ends in a summer month, as everyone is jumping into the water.  So from my estimate, approximately 9 months has elapsed total so far.  Rough estimate is each season is about 3 months.  That doesn't necessarily mean that season 4 and beyond will be based on that, but this is what I believe so far."
orangeisthenewblack,3dtm28,maverickLI,6,Sun Jul 19 18:05:07 2015 UTC,We also know it's been 9 months because Daya got pregnant at the beginning of season 1 and has her baby at the end of season 3.

Plus it's fucking weird, if people are in jail you'd expect them to obsess about how much time they have left not avoid mentioning it like it's Voldemort.    But I guess planning ahead is too difficult for the writers, they need to be able to release an inmate at a moments notice or keep them as long as they need to without worrying about conflicts with previous statements."

Hard to give flavor to a character who is purely a plot device.  Although I guess these are things a more experienced actor would try to figure out.

Seems like she will step on and use anyone in her bid for fame. Rose isn't even her last name. She took it from a famous godfather who doesn't even know her and has requested not to be associated with her"
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,jakabab,69,Fri Jul 17 19:20:52 2015 UTC,As much as i don't appreciate her as an actress i will say not to believe everything you find in google searches and people can call themselves whatever they want.

orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,jakabab,36,Fri Jul 17 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"Can you tell us other examples?   When I first heard about her I assumed Ruby Rose was a stage name but after I checked her Wikipedia page it seems that it's her birth name. It says nothing about her ever getting her name legally changed or anything. And for the record, Rose isn't her last name. Her full name is Ruby Rose Langenheim.  I also read the article about her godfather, and Lionel Rose wasn't the one who said that. His wife, Jenny Rose claims that Ruby was trying to cash in on her famous godfather. Rose actually is Ruby's real middle name though, she has just as much right to use it if she wants. She says she met him when she was young about 5 or 6 times and that she considers him a huge inspiration. You think it sounds attention whore-y, but to me it sounds genuine and like she really looks up to him."
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,luckylizard,-11,Fri Jul 17 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"Her godfather was some famous boxer, lionel rose. He has made statements saying he barely even know her and doesnt want to be associated with her, but she changed her last name to his.  It looks like her wikipedias been changed since she went on OITNB but I'm going to look for other sources. Other things were that she essentially name drops/attaches herself to people who could get her fame. Her wiki used to have a rather negative spin but it looks like they fixed that"
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,jakabab,20,Fri Jul 17 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"S.A.G. often encourages people to change their stage names. For example, Julianne Moore's real name is Julie Ann Smith but it was too common so she came up with Julianne Moore, Moore being her father's middle name. Vanessa L. Williams had to use her middle initial bc the Vanessa Williams of Melrose Place fame had entered SAG before her."

Her wiki used to have a rather negative spin but it looks like they fixed that   Hmm sounds like either someone had a vendetta against her or after her rise to fame someone edited it to make her look better.  Honestly though you really can't trust the internet on anything. I'm going to reserve all judgement on her unless I meet her in real life.
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,luckylizard,2,Fri Jul 17 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I should probably do the same. Back when I initially read it though, it left a really bad taste in my mouth. Especially reading her godfathers comments."

Danburry was mysteriously overcrowded so she was sent to another facility. Alex and Piper were only in Chicago in the same prison.  This is the great thing about the show it isn't a standard book adaptation but it is its own thing.

orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,5171984,13,Fri Jul 17 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Very interesting comment and i agree. Perhaps foreign audiences don't have an ear for genuine Aussie accents, and prefer the standard cockney/South African hybrid that most US actors seem to think passes for one.   I'm Australian and I rant and rave when they get a non-Australian to play an Aussie.  It is just such a hard accent to do properly. I'm yet to hear a100% convincing one. But then when they do actually get genuine fair dinkum Aussies (Like Spencer and Rose) I just can't Fucking stand them talking. It is so grating like fingernails down a blackboard.  Weird."

In some ways the world of OITNB is like this American fantasy world and as soon as you hear a fellow Aussie it becomes... Weirdly real? Anyway, I always have this problem with one Aussie in amongst a bunch of Yanks. It always weirds me out."

orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,CX316,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:22:28 2015 UTC,I think it sounds weird because their accent should technically blend in with wherever they're staying after awhile. Like mellow out. Not remain strikingly different.

Before privatisation they were both under the government control, and basically the same prison with two different wings (the Warden controlled max and Fig was assistant warden over at minimum security.)  Government tried to close down the minimum security prison but not the max facility"
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,naryn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:52:17 2015 UTC,But I do remember the people saying that they were going too take over max but it was too much maintenance. Edit: really assholes? You're going to down vote something that was literally said in the show?

orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,Girafarigging,8,Fri Jul 17 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"This is annoying. I know most people didn't like her, but that's because she was so hyped up, and the show really didn't do anything substantial with her at all. She was such an underdeveloped character. She had potential, though, and I think it's ridiculous to act like there's a new cast member, when in reality it's more like a minor character being in a few episodes and then never coming back. Pointless."

orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,Jester_Fleshwound,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:44 2015 UTC,"That bothered me so much. They literally couldn't have written one scene where a prisonmate asks how she's in a US federal prison when she's Australian?  She doesn't need a whole flashback scene, just one or two lines of dialogue is fine. I mean how did she stay in Litchfield for so long without being known as the Aussie girl?"
orangeisthenewblack,3dn21y,manbearkat,3,Sat Jul 18 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"After all the hype about her being on the show, her character ended up being incredibly two-dimensional. I was hoping they'd develop her more in S4."

I really, really, love both shows and they offer different sides, though many story lines are common. I binged Wentworth a little more intensely than OItNB to my surprise haha. It's a bit more like Oz in terms of darkness than OItNB, a lot more drama and less comedy. The characters are really good too! If you watch I'd recommend reading the After Ellen recaps on the episodes, which infuse some comedy into it and compare both shows."

orangeisthenewblack,3dn6t8,maverickLI,3,Fri Jul 17 21:00:00 2015 UTC,Wentworth is a little closer to what's going on in the prison down the hill from Litchfield. Makes me feel sorry for Nicky and Miss Claudette.
orangeisthenewblack,3dn6t8,syringemedic,5,Fri Jul 17 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Better than OitNB, imo."
orangeisthenewblack,3dn6t8,SpaceDingo3,4,Sat Jul 18 08:41:31 2015 UTC,"I watched Wentworth a few weeks ago, and loved it a lot. My advice for OITNB fans who'd like to try it is to not come at it expecting an alternate version of Orange, because it's not. It lacks the comedy that we love about OITNB, but it more than makes up for that in just how damn good the stories are. It's more event than character driven, and the plot moves super fast, always changing. In it's own right, I'd say Wentworth is better than Orange is the New Black."
orangeisthenewblack,3dn6t8,alexthepalisade,2,Sun Jul 19 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"Just give it a chance. It will blow your mind. It's a deeper, more vengeful type of thing. Imagine Vee and her  dark shiznit, layer that over very likeable women, each with different stories. I'm not even going to begin on all the feelings you'll have with the romance that you'll still find out on season 3."

Honestly now i think she deserves to be in prison lol but yeah that final scene where everyone is just having a great time was really beautiful to see. Really puts the ""prison mentallity"" into perspective. All these women aren't as mean or tough as they present themselves but in an envoirnment like Litchfeild the only way to really survive is to be a bad ass."
orangeisthenewblack,3dn5vm,TheXAntiXNinja,4,Fri Jul 17 17:14:47 2015 UTC,That's part of the vicious cycle that is the penal system in America. She adjusted to prison and became the type of person who deserves to be there.

orangeisthenewblack,3dn5vm,maverickLI,13,Fri Jul 17 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised with how much i liked Season 3. I felt at the start it was gonna be kind of a mild season after the first 2 were pretty darn good. But i gotta say i like how they expanded on characters. I really HAAAATED pensatucky when she was introduced cause well you know... crazy religious hick. Then they focused a lot on her back story and just felt really bad for her. Her interactions with boo were simply great and it made me really like boo who i also didn't like at first.   So the show has characters down IMO. I've honestly gotten bored and tired of piper, soooo won't really comment on that aspect since i find the rest of the show much more entertaining.   Heres to hopefully an awesome season 4"

It's one of those things that once you notice it become so difficult to not notice again. None of the music is diegetic, instead you just get these cheesy little guitar riffs as background mood fills that just come from the universe at large…    Considering that the women are in jail, I feel like they should really play up on what the soundscape of a jail should sound like."

orangeisthenewblack,3dk8i8,mpprog,15,Thu Jul 16 23:04:41 2015 UTC,Piper's scenes with Larry and Wheelchair Warrior were about her going: I'm alive.  Soso's interactions with people are: I'm dead.  I see Soso as a foil on what Piper could've been if Piper didn't adapt:   Piper learned to shut her mouth and join a group; Soso didn't.  Piper learned to solve her problems actively; Soso didn't. Piper became stone cold; Soso became soft. Piper started an empire; Soso had to be saved by another group. Piper didn't get banged by Boo; Soso did.

orangeisthenewblack,3ddlf7,LikelyWhisper99,3,Wed Jul 15 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Her transformation is similar to that of Tobias Beecher on Oz. He started off as scared little man from a wealthy background until prison hardened him and snapped him. However, I feel that this change isn't exactly the same as Piper's. I feel like she's always had a little bit of this bitchiness in her, but it's been brought out by current circumstances. I'm glad the writers are doing this. It keeps us on our toes. Similar to Game of Thrones, no one likes black and white morality in a character. It isn't entertaining and it isn't realistic. Piper, who has been the main character, (although that seems to be becoming less and less of the case as the show becomes even more similar to Oz, seeming to lose the concept of one main character) is now very unlikable. I'm glad they're doing this, but I suspect she'll have some redeeming moments. I highly recommend watching Oz if you've finished OITNB, because it's character arcs are similar to the direction OITNB is going now. Oz is on Amazon Prime, if you're interested."

orangeisthenewblack,3ddlf7,Perks92,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:22:13 2015 UTC,She's my favourite character so she better not get cut! Plus why would she? It's based (albeit pretty loosely) on a real story so cutting out the woman who's story it's based on would be a ridiculous thing to do.

It's based on a real person, but if the show followed the real story / memoir too closely, it would be over by now. So, it makes sense there would be more focus on the other characters, but there still has to be a reason for her to stick around."

I really hope it doesn't happen, and out of all the characters, she's the one that I want to end up happy at the end.   It's like a Breaking Bad - Walter White situation. I feel like I shouldn't like her, and that I shouldn't be routing for her due to all her character flaws, but I always want her to 'win' or come out on top in all her sub-stories"

orangeisthenewblack,3d6hri,maverickLI,7,Mon Jul 13 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"When a prisoner is taken to SHU, all of her property would be taken out of her cell and packed up by whichever CO is working the housing unit at the time. Many CO's are lazy or just do not care. Property gets lost or broken, usually the more expensive items (radio or sneakers).  While in SHU inmates do not have regular access to phones or showers. They are fed yesterdays food. Think it looks unappealing now, try it when its reheated 24 hours later.   Two of the biggest repercussions of going to the SHU are that you will usually lose your bunk and your job assignment. In prison having a cellmate that you can get along with has a huge impact on your stay. Once you get sent to SHU, your bed is available and assigned to another inmate. Your job assignment can help your time go by a lot quicker. If you have one where you can get along with your CO boss and coworker inmates, it is a big deal.  It is hard to express how psychological damaging isolation is. The show tries to by using Piper and Watson, but since they only do a few days locked up, they probably wouldn't be hallucinating or hearing voices. There are prisoners who do years or decades in SHU and then get released right to the streets, when their sentence is over."

orangeisthenewblack,3cxo5r,recovering_spaz,95,Sat Jul 11 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"I vote both acting and writing. Alex started off as this mysterious and alluring femme fatale but they never developed her outside of that so once her story was revealed all she has to fall back on is paranoia, angst, and no real substance.   I dunno. I got the impression that she was supposed to be a dark and quietly cunning character but it just never happened."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxo5r,MonsieurGadfly,80,Sat Jul 11 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"I thought that was the point? She started off as a dark, cunning femme fatale, and between prison/character development/flashbacks you get insights showing that she's deeply vulnerable, lonely, that the ""femme fatale"" impression was probably an act, like a drug dealer persona she puts on, and she's if anything more deeply affected by prison than Piper.   And then there's the whole ""wronging a drug boss"" thing, which is breaking her further. I think it's possible that we're still seeing things from Piper's perspective. Piper is deeply selfish, remember, and Alex actually knows the drug business, but Piper keeps brushing her off.  She's a counterpoint to a lot of characters. Mainly Piper this season, I'd think."

orangeisthenewblack,3cxo5r,oktortilla,5,Sun Jul 12 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I actually like Alex a lot better now that we know her vulnerable and somewhat clingy side as well, it makes her so much more relatable. (Well, for me atleast.) I think that she has many different sides but she keeps on this act to make it seem like she only has a few (pissed off and arrogant, that's pretty accurate actually!), but then we get to see everything else she is too. If she'd just be a femme fatale, wouldn't that make her way too one dimensional?"

She and Piper effectively switched places completely this season.

That said, her character this season was a tad annoying.  I can't help but think she was purposefully written that way.  I still don't believe her lack of scenes in season 2 was anything more than contract negotiations (not scheduling conflicts, as has been reported -- I mean, what else is she in right now?).  A part of me feels this was the show's way of gaining some leverage.  After season 1, Prepon had them where she wanted them because everyone LOVED Alex.  After season 3, her character is less well loved, giving the show the opportunity to off her character without too much fan grief.  Or it could just be horrible writing.  :-)"

Her character this last season after getting put back in was so opposite to how she was depicted in all of Piper's flashbacks.  Alex was basically like a mopey wet towel all of the 3rd season.  I actually face palmed when she removed herself from Piper's panty business because she thought piper was taking it too far.  Flashback-Alex seemed like she woulda been all for it, maybe even turned on by Piper's sudden hardcore-ness, but prison-Alex is just sad and boring.  Maybe her mother's death and breaking up with piper and messing up the Paris deal that got Fahri killed by Kubra really screwed her up to the point of changing her personality. Depression, maybe? I think she mentioned once about a darkness in her mind and once told piper she was supposed to be on anti-depressants, but doesn't take the pills.  I dunno, all I can say is that her character development is lacking.  I don't care either way if she stays or goes, but I do agree that the whole Alex-Piper saga has plateaued and something needs to happen to prevent it from turning into an easy fallback plot line for the writers, and for piper."

And her eye brows are indeed terrible.  So basically  I agree with you and can't find a way to CYV, but I would love to see her stay as a side character.  She's tall, confident, her voice is amazing and she has a great 'here comes trouble' vibe when she wants to.  This season was not her season but I hope she stays involved."

I haven't been emotionally invested in Piper since the first season tbh. She's kind of a crap person and as far as I'm concerned she isn't the main character any more, I don't believe there is one now. She was a great character for season 1, to introduce us to the daily life of the prison and it's characters and how things work, but I'd be happy if she finished serving her sentence next season and left the show, though it's more likely she's going to get caught with her new business and have a few more months/years tacked on to her sentence to keep her around."

orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,msvideos234,25,Sun Jul 12 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"I actually totally agree. I had to stop watching Weeds after season 4 because of how much I hated Nancy. Season 3 of OITNB was amazing, but the worst part was Piper by far. Both of their personalities and overall selfishness isn't endearing or 'love-to-hate' as much as just horribly off putting."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,nicodee,10,Sat Jul 11 18:37:33 2015 UTC,Weeds really swung up again after Nancy got shot in the face
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,k9centipede,2,Sat Jul 11 21:29:55 2015 UTC,Woah she got shot in the face!!?
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,nicodee,6,Sun Jul 12 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"Yup!  Major major Spoilers here, but basically after she had the affair with the drug lord, she sold him out to the DEA. So she has to die. But Ooh she's knocked up! Drug lord daddy switches tunes because omg omg son. Nancy doesn't trust it. Drug lords PR lady does not like her. Threatens her to stay quiet and be a good little wife and not cause waves (haha like Nancy could do that!). Shane whacks the lady off and Nancy and family go on the run, taking baby boy with. Travel around in a Jesus bus for a while. Have wacky adventures dealing with avoiding Drug lord Daddy. Eventually he catches up. Nancy calls the DEA and they both go to jail.   Time skip to the next season, Nancy gets out of jail. Drug lord daddies was whacked off in prison so that plot line is closed. Nancy lives at a halfway home and would do fine if she just kept her head down and her ears clean. But nope. That's not the Nancy we know. She goes off, hooks up with her prison wife's brother (played by Porn Stash!) Starts up a new drug ring. Deals with drama some more. Eventually gets a job selling dime bag weed in fancy boxes to high ups in corporate for huge huge mark ups. Gets on top of life again. Her sister, her, and her brother in law all move into a complex together to raise the kids and be a weird dysfunctional family. And during their dinner to celebrate their new life BOOM sniper shot to the face! Wtf wtf.  She survives. Minor brain damage. Takes time to recover. Sells pot to the people in the hospital (patients get it free). Gets out. Shane went through police academy at some point, goes to track down the person that shot mommy. Surprise, it was the son of that DEA agent Nancy married and got killed. He's gone off the deep end. Drama there.   Silas is still all about growing weed. Eventually he gets contacted by big nicotine to run their weed division once weed gets legalized.   Nancy, 3 times a widow now, eventually marries a rabbi. And opens up the Star Bucks of weed shops.   If you enjoy drama, it stays good. If you enjoy watching people make good decisions for themselves, not so much."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,k9centipede,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I actually super appreciate the spoilers, cause I do wonder from time to time what ever happened to nancy and the kids. I think I do briefly remember the young one killing the lady by the pool...and Silas modeling and being with an older lady or something eye roll. But after that I know nothing.  She got brain damage and married a rabbi.....well. Okay then. Haha.  I just really hope that Piper doesn't get increasingly worse throughout the next however many seasons will happen, like Nancy did. I love OITNB more than weeds for sure, so I won't stop watching or anything, but maybe some miraculous thing could happen and she'll somehow redeem herself? Lol"
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,nicodee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"I figure if you haven't seen it yet then the only way you would is if you know what happens and want to see how.   Yeah Silas was a model in Copenhagen. Shane was the one that was dating the older lady (and also really into puppets). Although Silas did hook up with that cheese shop owner lady in the beach town area.  During the time skip Andy and that pot head accountant dude (Doug) invented An attachment that converts a regular bike into an electric bike and tries to open a shop selling that. Nancy sells weed out the back of it, Silas hooks up with some hot chick that happened to be the leader of their rival drug dealers. Rival chick fucks shit up and steals their stuff. So Shane sends his cop buddies after her. She loses her scholarship. Very bitter.   Andy hooks up with Nancy sister, originally to get back at Nancy for something I think? And they have a tooootally healthy relationship going on.   They eventually move or visit agrestic. And Silas meets that deaf girl he knocks up in season 1. They get married and have babies. Deaf girl very much resents Nancy for ruining Silas childhood.   Oh Nancy and Andy have sex once finally! Right on the spot by the sidewalk where Husband/Brother died on that walk! And then Andy just walks away from her.   It's been a while since I've watched it all, so there's probably some details I forget.   Shane gets a bunch of student loans to raise money to help get mommy's drug business off the ground. He dates a cute chick from his police academy class. Shane's mentor in the place is the actor that plays Healy! I like to image it's an alternate time line Healy.   Um during the season finale time skip, baby boy finds out who his real dad was. Nancy never told him all the bad ass shit his drug lord daddy did.   Also Shane is an alkie now and Healy and him are banging prostitutes and stuff (one played by Nikkie!).   Ooh Doug started a cult as a way to launder money at one point. It gets big.  Don't remember what happened to Conrad. But his mama and the guy that was in the wheelchair for a while, Isabella dad? They hook up and are a thing."

orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,cvest,6,Mon Jul 13 11:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I was trying to make my way through the last season and I just could not do it.  Watching Nancy throw a complete fit that she isn't allowed to see her kid was just too much. The fact that she thought she should be given custody was insane. You're a convicted felon who routinely finds new and fascinating ways to fuck herself and everyone around her over maybe you shouldn't be a mother. She completely rejects any concept of reform while screaming at everyone.  Her MO was ""screech at people until they bend or screech at someone else until they kill the initial problem."""
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,metalyger,8,Sat Jul 11 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"I don't take any issue with these characters. They are flawed characters, but human enough for me to stick by them to the end of the show. It's like if you want to see scum of the Earth douchebags that you can't even accept as a main character, then watch anything by Rob Zombie or Eli Roth, it's more of an act of self torture to sit through. There's a line between a flawed character and someone that is a total crapsack with no redeeming qualities. I feel like with Weeds and OITNB, they've never crossed that line to where the main character is horrible and I can't enjoy the show any longer."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,RegularOwl,7,Sat Jul 11 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"If you read the book by the real Piper...I don't think most of us would enjoy her company in real life, either."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,dweebcentric,4,Sat Jul 11 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"Pre-prison Piper, indeed, probably wasn't all that interesting, judging by her initial outlook in her book. Post-prison Piper is actually very interesting. She spoke at a conference I worked at last year, and in her post-prison life, she has become far more compassionate about advocating for women in prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,RegularOwl,3,Sun Jul 12 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"She wrote her book after leaving prison...her personality really rubs me the wrong way. I'm glad she does positive things with her experience and I'm not trying to say I think she's a bad person, but I do think her portrayal in the show as an annoying person isn't unfounded."
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,k9centipede,5,Sun Jul 12 19:37:35 2015 UTC,She uses the white female characters to have a starting point so she can get into the stories the other characters present. And then has the main character be really annoying and drama so it pushes the story line but viewers feel more interested in the other characters stories.
orangeisthenewblack,3cxg60,AVeryWittyUsername,8,Sat Jul 11 21:31:45 2015 UTC,Piper is my favourite character. I love a character that follows their own way. That's probably why Hank Moody is my favourite TV character of all time.

Haha I love Piper and it bothers me how the general fans are obsessed with Alex and just choose to overlook she's equally fucked up (like, she named Piper and lied about it and on another occasion, she threw her under the bus again for an early release). But, I must say, the Piper for the last 5 episodes still shocks me."

I understand why people would dislike the, though hahahaha.  Both are put in extreme situations that are a far cry from what they're used to, it would be a hard sell if they managed to adapt to that as quickly and maintain a cool head.

orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,sevensands2,12,Sun Jul 12 00:22:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know how he's treated, but he seemed to be doing badly when his mother visited him. I think he's a very manipulative and sadistic, opportunistic guy who knows how to use his power against people. But he doesn't have power as a prisoner, and he doesn't seem particularly strong, so I don't assume he's being beaten up or whatever, but he's probably very alone and having a hard time of things."
orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,HippieSoulPunx,6,Sun Jul 12 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"He may have been kept in a Special Needs Yard. This is where snitches, former gang members, sex offenders and former law enforcement can go. I wonder if they mentioned if he was charged federally or through the state courts. The prison where the crime occurred is federally land."
orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,maverickLI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:42:29 2015 UTC,"I agree he should do his time in a federal prison. I don't think he has been convicted yet (federal cases usually take about a year from arrest till sentencing). The visitation scene with his mom is probably 2 months or so after his arrest. Also, fed prisons don't do the behind glass, using phone visits. But they do rent out space in county jails to hold inmates awaiting trial or awaiting designation to prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,maverickLI,3,Sun Jul 12 04:56:21 2015 UTC,"Even at it's fastest, it would be closer to a year for a plea (93% of fed cases end in a plea). He would be arrested, then arraigned. This would be where he meets a lawyer for the 1st time, hears the charges and pleads not guilty. A month later he would actually discuss the case with his attorney, the attorney would tell Mendez the case is not winnable and trying to plead guilty would be his best bet.  His attorney would want Stache to meet with a psychologist, hoping it may influence a judge to give him a more lenient sentence. The lawyer would also be in contact with Assistant US attorney (prosecutor) to see what they were offering.  Most important in every Federal case, the prosecution HAS to prepare a Presentence Investigation (PSI). This is the largest influence in sentencing and is give to the judge after the defendant pleads guilty, but before sentencing. This Report takes between 4-6 months to prepare.  So lets say this is about 8 months after arrest, Mendez pleads guilty, the judge has to accept the deal. Sentencing is usually 2-3 after the plea is accepted. Roughly a year, if there are NO delays."
orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,maverickLI,4,Sun Jul 12 05:08:16 2015 UTC,He seemed pretty miserable when his mom went to visit him. I guess he would be especially if the other inmates found out he's a former guard. Yikes!
orangeisthenewblack,3cyrlh,the_only_ragekat,11,Sun Jul 12 05:10:01 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that  Rapist + Prison Guard = kept in SHU for his own protection.

orangeisthenewblack,3cy165,dymphnawolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"1) Agreed.  2) I don't think having sympathy for someone eliminates the anger over their actions of the past. I tend to look at things more grey than anything else. With Mendez I agree with you more than not. With murderers/rapist while I feel the punishments should always be extreme I am sympathetic if they grew up in situation that made their playing field more difficult. It doesn't in anyway justify their behavior but I can recognize we're born innocent and they happened to learn how to operate in a world with terrible parents, neighborhood and schools. I had the luxury of getting many mulligans for childhood mistakes from family. My bad behavior corrected and taught to value people. Most hardened criminal likely don't have that same luxury. With Mendes though it seems that he had a great upbringing and was afforded every opportunity. Despite this he took advantage of his position of power which lead to a death of an inmate. His abuse of power was constant...there is was no one mistake made on a bad day.  I think Tiffany is a perfect example of having sympathy for a terrible person without forgetting that some of their actions make them near impossible to redeem. She is a murderer and an attempted murderer. Yet we see her upbringing and recognize that the odds were stacked against her and despite her crimes still are sympathetic/outraged when she is raped. I feel sympathetic but it doesn't make me forget she is a murderer. She ruined someones lifes and forever scarred that person's family. She should be in jail until she is very old. Especially considering she attempted to murder again in prison. I certainly don't forgive or like her but I can be sympathetic to aspects of her life and recognize she had a tougher hill to climb than me."
orangeisthenewblack,3cy165,Trolloc,16,Tue Jul 14 13:36:26 2015 UTC,"1) Awesome on her own?  Like if she wasn't in the show awesome? or awesome because she doesn't have to play ""Stella"" to be a part of it?  Either way she blows!  I hate how they introduced her in the sewing shop, kept panning the camera on her with that bieber ass haircut.    2) Dude is a scummy fuck, sympathy?  Isn't all bad?  He was getting blowj's for drugs,  using Red's kitchen to get his product, and even though he was framed, he still was scum before that."
orangeisthenewblack,3cy165,boybakal,6,Sun Jul 12 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a good thing when you forget that someone is playing a character. Playing yourself isn't much good. I don't know, Ruby Rose seems cool, but they did a crappy job with Stella. For the hype she got, we didn't get to see much of her, just a few short scenes here and there, and it was all just kind of thrown together, you know? I don't know if she's meant to be back for Season 4, but if she's not, I'll be annoyed, because it's such a waste. Why introduce a character, only use them in a few scenes, and then send them away? I don't know, hopefully we'll see more of her.  Nah, I still hate Mendez. There are people who claim to be in love with people, but still treat them badly, or are obsessed over them or make them unhappy, etc. He's not all bad, no. He's not, you know, Hitler on psychotic steroids or whatever. He's a crappy person who has his own form of morality and his own feelings. He's not a one-sided villain, a man without feelings. He has feelings, but he's still a terrible person."

And Vee manipulated more sane people into doing awful things, too - I don't think Suzanne can be held responsible (on an analytic level, that is.)  I didn't like her less at all during season 2, I just felt really bad for what was happening to her. She became someone she didn't want to be, but since she was finally getting the love and attention she had been craving for so long, she didn't realize it."
orangeisthenewblack,3cvg83,Unicornea,3,Sat Jul 11 13:29:29 2015 UTC,Her brain doesn't work on the same level as other people's   I think Birdie says something about her brain being on the same level as a 6-year-old.   EDIT: a word

This whole ""trust no bitch"" phase is just an act, it's like a game to her. She's so fucking privileged compared to everyone around her and still insists that her life is just as hard as everyone else's.  A few examples from this season that come to mind  SEASON 3 SPOILERS below   When she's sitting around with some other inmates insisting that she lived in a modest house and lived a modest life, and they call her out when she reveals how many bathrooms the house had.  When she fires Flaca and Vause has to remind her that the women she's recruiting are extremely poor [I can't remember the scene exactly but that was the gist] When her dad finally swallows his pride and comes to visit and she throws a petty bitchfit like a teenager and starts moaning about having sex with Vause. I understand your parents are jerks but they're obviously there and making an effort, and you are a 30 year old woman. Gets Vause back in jail, completely dismisses Vause's COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE fears that Kubra could be coming after her, and then cheats on Vause with very little remorse   tl;dr - screw Piper, I sincerely hope the writers kill her off"

orangeisthenewblack,3cwrk0,car27,9,Sat Jul 11 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"I think the author is right that we as a society need to talk about sexual assault and how to be supportive of those who have been assaulted. Absolutely true. But OITNB and Mad Men aren't preachy after school specials. These shows do their best to show what realistically might happen, not what should happen in a perfect world. In reality, women in prison have sexual relationships with guards and some are more violent than others. In reality, friends don't always know the ""right"" things to do and say when they find out their friends have been sexually assaulted. And, in reality, plenty of women stay in relationships with and marry men who have raped them. I applaud the author's desire to make changes around the discourse of sexual assault, but she's picking on the wrong targets."
orangeisthenewblack,3cwrk0,panic_bread,3,Sat Jul 11 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with the article as well, especially about Daya, though it is also true that prison is a dysfunctional system where many do not get the psychological care they need.  We have seen elsewhere in the show that the counseling that should be offered has broken down.  One place they might address it well, though, would be in the acting class.  Missed opportunity there.  Having done some volunteer work with a similar program, I would say that is where someone might begin to deal with the pain.  One more note, the article gives the usual 1 in 6 women who have been assaulted, but it is much higher in prison populations.   I can't remember the stats offhand, but it is more than half."

orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,Montanx,29,Sat Jul 11 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Meh. I disagree. I think ""playing it safe"" is introducing a new antagonist, basing the entire season around her, killing her off, and ending each of the character arcs roughly in the same spot they were in at the start of the season.  Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy much of Season 2 as a whole (particularly with Rosa, and Morello's backstory), but Season 3 renewed my faith in the show's character-based progression. Plus interest!"
orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,LegionLG,5,Sat Jul 11 05:35:11 2015 UTC,"Well said.  Also, this season was more realistic for a minimum security prison.  It seems like OP wants more violence.  The levels of violence between inmates is minor in a facility like this, because no one wants to go to max.  The real violence is what WAS emphasized this season - rape and harassment by COs - and the reality is that there is little repercussion.    I liked the complexity of this season."
orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,emfrank,5,Mon Jul 13 12:56:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of groundwork for the future was laid this season.  Also, character development was a huge focus, and that required many flashbacks.  OITNB is so talent packed that I enjoy watching the actors work as much as I enjoy the storylines.  Even if this season didn't have it's hugely earth-shattering moments, as long as the cast is given solid material with which to work (and I believe this will happen), there will be a payoff for the audience."
orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,rungirlrun262,3,Sat Jul 11 11:06:04 2015 UTC,Pennsatucky was raped this season in a flashback and THEN CURRENTLY.  What is wrong with you?
orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,DenisNikk,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:03 2015 UTC,"It's not a particularly violent prison, that's kind of the point. As for disappearing characters, maybe the actors were busy so had to be written out (either temporarily or permanently).   Why wouldn't Sophia apologise? It was an accident, and she doesn't strike me as a violent person, or even a person who likes conflict of any kind. I agree that she probably could've overpowered those two women who attacked her, but she was taken by surprise, in shock and there were two of them, and if she's not someone who knows how to defend herself, it's understandable that all of those factors combined meant that they got the jump on her.  No payoff? If that's the reason you watch stuff, you're going to be disappointed. Everything has a resolution in one way or another, but it's not always in the way you'd like. Red and Healy both have feelings for each other, but they both know it's not only inappropriate but pointless, since Red's in jail and Healy is married. As Red says, when Healy leaves, Red is locked in. He has the power, it's not a functional relationship, and it's illegal. They both know that, and are not idiotic enough (I'm looking at you, Daya and Bennett) to really follow through on it. Plus the resolution is that Healy's wife makes a very small but well-meaning gesture, showing that she's going to make an effort.  Rapey guy gets off scott-free because the show hasn't actually ended, it's just the end of the season. You seem like someone who wants every single storyline wrapped up by the end of a season, but if you do that, there's going to be no season 4. Don't you understand that? You need cliffhangers and unresolved issues to set up the next season. Rapey dude will get his comeuppance one way or another in season 4; Boo and Pennsatucky won't let him do the same to another girl."
orangeisthenewblack,3cvwao,HippieSoulPunx,2,Sun Jul 12 03:56:34 2015 UTC,Playing it safe? What about the scene where the fiction charecter fuck people with his 3 penises? Or when the guy got his gallbladder cut out?

I thought it was terrific that people actually got into Suzanne's bizarre erotic alien story.  Her character is childlike, not all there and yet now and then she makes comments showing that she's actually very intelligent & well educated.  I think it's totally plausible that Suzanne would have a hidden talent for writing."

In whole, the show just devolved from a solid and intriguing drama with funny bits into something more slapstick. Quite frankly, this season ruined the show for me."

orangeisthenewblack,3cr2ql,eowowen,2,Fri Jul 10 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"I agree about Schilling and Cox I feel like in season two they were not really involved in the Vee drama and were more comedic relief so I don't see them making it in the drama category. I think they will get nominated for drama, but its pretty much a three horse race between House of Cards, Game of Thrones, and Mad Men for the win. I really hope Toussiant, Aduba, and Mulgrew get nominated, but I'm a little worried they won't be able to fit all three in. My best hope is that season 3 came out right when they started voting, so maybe the Orange is the New Black buzz at that time helped."

If the show was more focused on Piper than it is, I would be out. Her entire gangster-arc feels like babby's first crime. I can't take her seriously. I honestly thought higher of her when she almost killed a person at the end of Season 1.   Maybe when she shanks someone for business I'll take her seriously again. Speaking of shank, that cady-shank was the most obvious Chekov's Gun I have seen in a long time. I do not know where they are going with this. Are we supposed to consider this a Walter White-esque transformation? That can't be because they dropped the name and directly made that reference. It would be too obvious and it is nowhere near as thought out.   Since when does she care so much for prison-cred? She got so obsessed about her ""business"" so quickly I have no idea where it is coming from. To impress Alex? It turned from ""Teehee, I am doing something naughty"" to ""I will ruin this person's chance at freedom because I can't risk people thinking I am going soft."" with hardly any big developments in between.  Perhaps the point is not to show her developing into a competent criminal but to show how she is slowly going insane in that place. Because she seems to become stupider, not smarter at dealing with things."
orangeisthenewblack,3clfyf,Cymen90,9,Fri Jul 10 00:12:39 2015 UTC,"The problem I had with her is how obvious the entire plot was as soon as she was on screen. She was CLEARLY going to be a bigger character than any of the other new girls. Her character-design, so to say, was too elaborate and clean and then there is the accent, so she sticks out to the viewer immediately. It is almost desperate how much of a character she is. Like a cartoon where they draw a croud of people and then there is that one character that is drawn much with much more detail and bighter colors. And the first look she gives Piper is really obvious and she starts asking for her ""girlfriend"" right away and teases her in a flirty way. I didn't mind too much because I was SO SICK of Alex and Piper and I was looking forward to something to shake it up. The whole ""Isn't it funny how we love each other in spite of our hardships"" bit was awful. I am just not into any story related to Piper, I guess. Except for her brother. I do not hate her for the reasons the writers created, I just do not think she is a good character but maybe they are trying to transition to look at her from another angle. Because so far, she is still the rich white girl trying to fit in and that is not enough, even though we see how far she wants to take it."

orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,gormla,21,Thu Jul 9 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"Only a few? Seemed like at least half of the cast had kids. Those who didn't were mostly too young to have kids. Sophia has a son. Aleida has all the kids. Gloria. Red. I'm sure there's more that we just don't see too.  EDIT: The drug thing too. There are a couple inmates in for strange things but the majority are in for drugs. We just don't see the details of their crimes because it isn't emphasized - because for those we do see, the crimes are a big part of their character. Not so for those dealing in drugs - in those cases the crime was more a small aspect of a larger problem. But of those we KNOW the histories of, at least half are drug related. Piper, Alex, Taystee, Vee, Aleida, Daya, Poussey (most likely), Leanne. Nicki's wasn't explicitly drugs but was a large factor. And half of those were cases where it was a ""lackey"" largely taking the fall for a larger figure which the article says is realistic but they brush over that fact.  Seems like the only thing being misrepresented here is the show itself."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,kindraness,5,Thu Jul 9 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was particularly realistic in its portrayal of the prisoners as mothers, as opposed to a show like Boardwalk Empire where only family women seemed to have multiple children when the reality is that the ""bad girls"" would've been mothers several times over as well."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,JurgisRedux,3,Thu Jul 9 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"""Those who didn't were mostly too young to have kids.""???  I think the article is overstated, but to say any of these women is too young to have children seems pretty naïve.  Many low-income women have children in their late teens and early twenties, especially those who are most at risk for crime."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,emfrank,10,Sat Jul 11 04:35:56 2015 UTC,"I am not a big fan of calling many of these crimes ""non violent drug offenses"". If you grow a marijuana plant in your basement, then eat Nachos and smoke it, that's non violent. In Pipers case, she was moving around the cash for a DEADLY criminal drug empire, that killed many people. Killing wasn't part of her job description, but getting the cash from country to country is a huge part of keeping the cartel alive."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,maverickLI,3,Fri Jul 10 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with your theory is most ""Drug crimes"" are non-violent, the police and prosecutors try and link violence or just claim that ""Yeah they were not violent BUT the drug industry is"". This is why they try and justify the draconian punishments for low level drug crimes. It's a disgrace plain and simple, you don't balance a crime by committing another one...like locking up Piper 10+ years after the fact. Does nothing to the drug war/trade and ruins a life."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,DragonZOM,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:09:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that many sentences are way to long. But after reading Pipers book and hearing her complain about getting 15 months for a ""non violent drug offense"", I was like, no 15 months sounds about right. Now she had some advantages, no priors, a good lawyer and she was willing to testify against Kubra, so the feds gave her a good deal. Piper is NOT the person that I want to hear bitch about drug crimes and their sentences."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,maverickLI,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:40:30 2015 UTC,15 months for moving some money around? That's fucking insane. It was a nonviolent offense.
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,liarscheatersthieves,2,Sat Jul 11 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"She brings Kubra $100,000. Kubra tells Aydin, go kill a witness or a rival....here's $100,000 for the job. That's not nonviolent. Piper in real life and the show, thinks she is just having some fun traveling the world with her girlfriend and moving money around.  She never looked at the big picture, what was that money funding. there are many people in prison who can complain about unjust sentences, she's not the one."

orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,dweebcentric,8,Fri Jul 10 19:30:37 2015 UTC,Did...anyone believe it was supposed to be accurate? There has to be some stretches from reality at times.
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,War-Bandit,5,Thu Jul 9 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is now the third article I've seen bitching about how OITNB isn't 100% accurate in every way. It's fucking ridiculous, who reads this shit?"
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,liarscheatersthieves,2,Sat Jul 11 01:01:12 2015 UTC,"Read the author's note.  Her point is not that that OITNB is inaccurate.  She says it starts an important conversation about prisons, but we need to look more deeply.  It is not a criticism of the show, but a discussion of the problem of incarceration of women."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,emfrank,3,Sat Jul 11 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely - it's a TV show.   In defense of OITNB - Piper Kerman is a consultant. And the show is based on the book she wrote documenting what she actually witnessed during her short stay in a federal women's prison.   But it's not a straight up documentary. Artistic license is expected (though season 3 felt far more genuine compared to last season under the reign of Vee). It may not be a completely accurate depiction, but it still got a lot of things right. For example, the struggle to maintain family ties while on the inside. Struggles within family life that lead to cycling through prison. The corporate management of prison life. And so forth."
orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,dweebcentric,4,Fri Jul 10 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think the show is shining a light on all of these issues, especially at the end of season 3 as we see the changes coming to Litchfield. To slam a fictional TV show for not getting everything right is reaching. What it IS doing is exposing thousands and thousands of people to an environment they would never have gotten a glimpse of.   As for their points   A show needs drama, if every person had the same back story it wouldn't be as interesting for the viewer. It's a ""random"" assortment of people so of course there are some people who didn't commit Low Level drug crimes. I think (as someone else said) most of them have kids or are/ were too young to have them. Suzanne, Jimmy, and Lorna aren't the only people who show issues. Soso, Piper, Pennsatucky, Poussey and I'm sure others I'm forgetting have all shown indications of mental illness. Whether it's passing or something more serious, I don't know. How is this the show's fault? OITNB is shining a pretty bright light on Women's Prisons and the problems within them. I think viewers are becoming more sympathetic to these women as their backstories are revealed and maybe that will lead to something more concrete in the future."

orangeisthenewblack,3cojvs,Iannah,4,Thu Jul 9 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"Speaking of misrepresentation...   most of the women incarcerated for crack cocaine or methamphetamine were caught with less than 100 grams, the weight of an average bar of soap.   I know that 100 grams is just a cutoff the author chose to construct an impactful statistic, but anything more than 4-5 grams off meth is a substantial amount that should carry stiff penalties."

orangeisthenewblack,3cm3ks,PartyPorpoise,4,Wed Jul 8 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think they'll clash over the gardening and those small meals Red makes with the vegetables they grow. But I'm also hoping that Caputo is still a good guy, and he finds a way to break free from MCC. I want Litchfield to go back to how it was, minus the corruption from Fig. I don't know, I see MCC is kind of the 'villain' of Season 4, so to speak, so hopefully they won't stick around, and Red and Judy can clash over making delicious meals (well, prison-delicious).  Also, I've noticed a few people mention her racism, but I don't remember her saying anything racist, I must've missed it, what did she say?   I don't think she and Piper will bond much. I mean, Piper kind of sees herself as separate to those people. Like her mother, she loves her mother but she drives her crazy, and she doesn't particularly see herself as this kind of wealthy, entitled rich person, which she is, as the other inmates point out. So I think it's more likely that Piper will look at Judy how she looks at her mother, so they won't particularly bond well. Certainly not now that Piper is running a prison business and is a 'gangsta' (in her own words)."
orangeisthenewblack,3cm3ks,HippieSoulPunx,2,Thu Jul 9 03:05:08 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if it's possible for a private prison to go back into government hands. Does that happen often?  In the final episode, Judy complains about going to a prison in ""Jew York"". She might've said something about black people, but I can't remember. In addition to Martha Stewart, she's also based in part on Paula Deen, so that could be an extra bit of foreshadowing.  I doubt she and Piper will bond, though I am curious about their interactions. I could picture Piper seeing her and suddenly missing her life outside of prison, but you're probably right. I'm hoping Piper sees her and goes ""Damn, was I this annoying when I first got here?"", that would be pretty funny."
orangeisthenewblack,3cm3ks,HippieSoulPunx,3,Thu Jul 9 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it happens often, but I don't consider realism to be a priority in OITNB, you know? So I think it definitely can happen within the realms of the show."
orangeisthenewblack,3cm3ks,dymphnawolf,5,Thu Jul 9 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"I think her being there will somehow lead to the condition of the prison being exposed. People will listen to her so if she talks, Litchfield will be under the  microscope. Or at least there will be the threat of that."

orangeisthenewblack,3cm3ks,60AcreBeetFarm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:06:34 2015 UTC,"That is a possibility as well! Judy King seems like she wouldn't say anything if they treat her better than the other inmates. But she will generate public interest in the place no matter what happens. Maybe we'll get a call back to Larry's public radio appearance.   I can see her arrival bringing forth superficial improvements for sure (better food, more books, things generally looking better) but things are still rotting on the inside. And there will likely be the threat of exposure near the end of the season at the very least because they need a cliffhanger. I bet it either be that or a prison riot."

orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,call_it_art,26,Wed Jul 8 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"It's a bunch of little things.  He's overcompensating and it's become too obvious.  It started with his first wife, Mimi Rogers saying that they divorced because of lack of sex. Then whenever a tabloid journalist said that meant he could be gay, he would sue them.  He's also known for being extremely homophobic on sets.   Then there's other things that by themselves mean nothing, but together add to the equation. He joined Scientology, a ""religion"" known to claim to be able to cure homosexuality. His last wife was treated like a job interview and it was rumored he was considering several candidates for the position. She ended up getting a great deal in the divorce settlement, and rumors are it's to keep her quiet about his being gay.  Mostly, though, it just REALLY pisses him off when people hint that he's gay, and it's funny to push his buttons because he's so homophobic."

For example, Beverly Hills Playhouse was/is heavily linked to Scientology and is an important feeder to the industry and has employed super talented people. Plus a lot of the Scientology jargon and ""coursework"" is just repackaged CBT and goofy old psychoanalysis, so it probably does provide some help to vulnerable people. They treat entertainers like kings, so she probably things Scientology is awesome and everyone in it rules.  Not to say Scientology isn't THE WORST but celebrity Scientology is a different brand than Scientology for the masses."

orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,MonsieurGadfly,-9,Wed Jul 8 12:19:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links.   So from what I can tell, they're just a really insular religion with extremely stringent ideas on how to serve them. They seem to lose face because they use extreme methods against those who speak out or act against them.   I suppose I should rephrase my question then. Why do Scientology beliefs get more vitriol compared to other beliefs? Aside from the fact that they're doing all this in the present where others did it in the past, I don't see why Prepon is being trashed for this. We typically wouldn't trash an individual Christian for the crusades of their forebears or an individual Muslim for the extremist actions of those who share a similar religion. So why do we trash those who believe in Scientology?"
orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,LegionLG,3,Wed Jul 8 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that the offended Christians of the world downvoted you to oblivion without engaging in any meaningful, intellectual discussion about it. People throw the word ""cult"" around willy-nilly these days, and fail to acknowledge that the Cult of Christianity—   cult (noun): noun a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.  a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.   —preceded contemporary Christianity as we know it today, back when it was a small, marginalized group of practitioners with no real numbers or sociopolitical power. (Anyone who doesn't know that, brush up on your reading pronto). But since we only understand ""cult"" as derogatory, all the theists immediately balk at the comparison. When you're too afraid to think critically about your own religion in order to defend it, you have no authority to cast judgment on any organized religion that is not your own. The way some people take it, you would think that Christianity was an absolute power since the dawn of time. It wasn't.  Now, I'm not defending Scientology by any means. I'm equally cynical about all religions—and here I'm not trying to undermine a religion as a religion by branding it as a ""cult,"" shuffling it away in my brainbox, and resting more peacefully at night. But evidently there is no constructive dialogue to be had here, since these redditors are only willing to thoughtlessly condemn Scientology's machinations (which I think is far too easy to do) because it's only utterly bizarre when it's in the defense of a non-Christian religion."
orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,Irrumab0,2,Wed Jul 8 15:15:26 2015 UTC,I recommend you watch the hbo documentary on scientology. You will see some of the messed up things

I'm just trying to understand the reason for the double standard."
orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,Catele,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"Probably because it is really hard to keep a straight face when talking about a ""religion"" founded by a drug fucked science fiction writer."

orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,Irrumab0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:46 2015 UTC,I think the reason is because Scientology is now in the modern times and is seen in many celebreties. Yes islam and christians have done horrible things but most were in the past along time agoooo. Its a stupid reason but shit
orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,MonsieurGadfly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"Your English is fine.   From what I've seen and read so far, I think I agree with you about it being a modern thing.    All the responses I've gotten so far have amounted to ""because it's stupid"" or ""because they hurt people"" or ""because it's such fantasy"" but no one seems willing to address the fact that the same could be said of any spirituality depending on one's perspective and Heathen Level.   From asking my first question, all I've gotten is a lot of downvotes and no actual substance. From this, I'm tempted to conclude that Scientologists are just convenient scapegoats because of their youth and availability."
orangeisthenewblack,3ci409,keshanu,3,Wed Jul 8 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"While some of Scientology's unpopularity probably does come from the fact that is a relatively recent religion and there are plenty of religious atrocities that have been committed throughout the ages, not allowing someone to leave a religion is not typical of most mainstream religions. Yes, there are branches of all sorts of religions were those kinds of things happen, but that is why such groups are called cults. Scientology also operates like a business, while demanding tax-exempt status. Considering how small it is, there are certainly religions out there who have historically, or even today, caused more damage because of their considerably greater influence and the fact that they also did/are doing terribly awful things, but that does not (1) excuse the abuses of Scientology against its members and ex-members, or (2) mean that such wrongs are typical of or inherent in all religions, or (3) mean that religion is the only vehicle for such wrongs. Plenty of wrongs have been committed in the names of all sorts of institutions and causes.  You really should watch the documentary that /u/Irrumab0 recommended if you want to better understand why people dislike Scientology so much. It explains it far better than anyone here can do in a short post."

orangeisthenewblack,3cfe5x,chanilastname,41,Tue Jul 7 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Sadly, that was the one that lined up with my brief jail experience. I was looking at the others and saying ""Fuck, they got coffee?! AND FRUIT?!"" Even on Morgan County I said ""FUCKING FRITOS? Without even having to burn commissary?!""  I lost 7 pounds in the 11 days I was in, and I didn't start off with a ton; I weigh about 160 on the day-to-day. Plus I was drinking water non-stop because, well, there's really not much else to do since I was in lockback 22 hours of the day, and it staves off the hunger a bit. So it's not like I was just shedding some water weight and exercising."
orangeisthenewblack,3cfe5x,tremens,21,Tue Jul 7 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"I can't believe they got actual meat. Pretty much everything I was fed in jail, down to the ""butter"", was made out of soy. There was so much soy that people were genuinely worried about growing breasts. Seeing as how they were also convinced there was saltpeter in the bug juice, I don't know how well-founded their fears were but it still made me wary. If you think you're going to jail, I suggest learning the basics of Judaism so you can pass the quiz for the kosher meal."
orangeisthenewblack,3cfe5x,samferrara,9,Tue Jul 7 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"I had ""meat"" but it was the absolute bare minimum, and usually mixed down with something else (like ""turkey"" stuffing, ""sausage"" gravy, etc) I think they're required to provide a protein for at least two meals a day in my area, unless you declare yourself vegetarian of course.  ""Breakfast"" was an 8oz bowl of either ""Cheerios"" or bran flakes and 6oz of milk, every. single. day.   What was crazy to me was the guys who managed to stay ripped and even bulk up, but they all had something in common, a (relative) ton of money in the canteen; you'd see them picking up big bags of stuff each time it came around. You simply cannot get enough protein, even with what I was provided, on what's given to you ""free"" to maintain weight - let alone put it on.  My suggestion if you think you might go to jail - bring as much cash as you can possibly spare. It's a pain in the ass to get it back out off that stupid, high fee debit card they give you when you're released, but extra food, socks, underwear, even a radio and batteries are invaluable if you're locked up. I try to keep $100 cash on me at all times, even though I'm a pretty law abiding citizen, just because of the experience of being locked up with nothing now."
orangeisthenewblack,3cfe5x,tremens,5,Tue Jul 7 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"We called the breakfast cereal ""scorn flakes"". When I got out they cut me a check, and it was fairly painless. I was just thinking what I'd try to get in order for a first day in jail. I think I'd try to wear a few pairs of good boxers, socks, and- most importantly- comfortable sneakers. I had to buy a pair of 1/2 size too big, already-worn Nike Air Max from someone. The velcro bobos just don't cut it and fall apart quickly anyway. I actually managed to gain some weight in jail, but I probably needed it."

orangeisthenewblack,3cfe5x,Klaviatur,3,Wed Jul 8 09:15:25 2015 UTC,I don't know if that's the procedure everywhere. It may be that the people giving the quiz have no real way of knowing who is pulling their chain and who isn't so they need a quiz with right and wrong answers.   It was like:   What is a rabbi? What is the Torah? What is a cantor? What part of the year is Rosh HaShana?   It's kind of like the questions they ask you on your way into Ben Gurion International.

It's basically a much better looking microwave meal (the ones that come in little trays, usually something like salisbury steak). It's actually more appetizing than some of the food we get at my school.  I wouldn't touch the $0.58 Alabama meal, but that's probably because I hate hot dogs and baloney. I don't know who wants 2 pieces of bread with a ""dab"" of peanut butter. That one with the half an egg is just pathetic."

While they look really good, my school is serving oily tater tots, greasy pizza (up 2 slices per student), french fries, ice cream, soda and chips. The ""healthy"" options are so unappealing and disgustingly unfresh it's never put out. They try to make it look healthy but offering ""baked"" Cheetos and ""baked"" Lays chips but in the end the kid is getting 1,000+ calories in a single meal, served along side those plastic-wrapped pasteries the school calls ""breakfast"" that probably already pestered in 1,000 calories.

orangeisthenewblack,3ce8df,RoseTheChief,27,Tue Jul 7 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, people like him too much and give him too much credit. The flashback shows what he's really like. He's all talk. He talks about wanting to do the serious stuff, but when the grenade comes in, he's a coward, he moves away and takes cover instead of throwing it out, leaving someone else to sacrifice himself to protect the others. I mean, I don't think it's cowardly to not want to be blown up, but in this context it is. He talks about how he's serious about what he's doing, but when he gets his first taste of reality, he's out of there. Both in terms of the military and being a father. He's not behind the scenes being a hero, I don't get why people think that, I think it's just wishful thinking."

He lied to Daya and her mother about not getting injured in Afghanistan, he was injured in Afghanistan and therefore is getting government benefits.  He ratted out Pornstache after he promised Daya he wouldn't.  He left the crib on the side of the road (that can't be clearer about his intentions), and left town without notifying his employer or coworkers.  There is no way he ratted out Cesar, because he wouldn't do anything to risk linking himself to Daya's life."
orangeisthenewblack,3ce8df,oohKillah00H,13,Tue Jul 7 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"There's no proof that he was injured in Afghanistan. He took cover while someone else covered the grenade to protect the others. The human body is quite good at absorbing the shock, so I doubt Bennett did actually lose his leg from that blast, or anything else. He could easily be telling the truth, and I think it's likely he is telling the truth, considering the flashback showed us that he's all talk, but runs when reality hits.  I agree with the rest of your comment though, for sure. People are hoping he's behind the raid, but the flashback made it very clear, in my opinion."
orangeisthenewblack,3ce8df,HippieSoulPunx,5,Tue Jul 7 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, the flashback cuts out before the explosion, so he could have survived it unscathed, finished his tour of duty, and then gotten the infection while in a hot tub.  However, I don't think he completed his full Afghanistan deployment, and when he dove for cover his legs were still only about a yard or two away from the grenade when it went off so I think we're supposed to believe that was the injury."
orangeisthenewblack,3ce8df,oohKillah00H,9,Tue Jul 7 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"In S1 he said he was injured from a hot tub in Orlando and doesn't get gov't benefits.  The crib was probably full of bed bugs and memories of Daya's horrific babyhood, why would he want that?"
orangeisthenewblack,3ce8df,recovering_spaz,0,Tue Jul 7 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he said that, and you find out it was a lie when you see his flashbacks in S3.

orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,hezzaa,87,Mon Jul 6 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting issue - one I haven't thought about before.   But as someone who grew up in western Pennsylvania (and even admittedly speaks West Pennsyltuckian), I do want to point out one author bias. She states that she worked with teenage girls and their families - and that none of those mothers would have flippantly told their daughters that sex should be quick like a bee sting. But just because she didn't work with mothers who had that attitude doesn't mean they don't exist.   Pennsatucky is meant to be an outlier with an unusual situation. She's someone with a mother that would not be so involved in her daughter's life that she would seek out ""mother-daughter bonding"" that may result in interaction with someone like this author. Mothers like that do exist. Girls I knew growing up had mothers like that."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,CandySnow,47,Tue Jul 7 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was about to point out.   The very fact that author Emma Eisenberg encountered those mothers through a service or space where educated professionals could help them with their issues immediately indicates that these women see the emotional development of their daughters as a priority. There is no severe parental neglect on that front like we've seen from Pennsatucky's mother, and ignoring that facet of her backstory bungles the main point of the article.  Classism and sexual abuse in rural areas are serious issues that should be talked about more often, especially through OITNB, and I do agree that what's been done with the meth heads so far is problematic when compared to the rest of the inmates. However, it's important to recognize that rural backgrounds of parental neglect aren't just works of fiction; instead of criticizing the writers for using this common trope by saying that there were plenty of mothers who cared, there should be a push towards portraying these troubling childhoods with more sensitivity and depth."

Yeah, that's an important bias. We're also talking about a TV show set in prison - obviously character back stories are going to feature some kind of neglect from a loved one. There are reasons people commit crimes and it's often due to an unstable support system.  Almost all the characters had misunderstanding or totally uncaring mothers - Piper, Nicky, Boo, Daya, Taystee. I don't remember what Alex's mom was like but there are probably other characters I'm missing.  You could argue that bad mothering is a common theme of the show. OITNB likes to explore expectations of womanhood, wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to say something about the ""nurturing mother"" trope as well."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,manbearkat,6,Tue Jul 7 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Pennsatucky is a character, not merely a symptom.  She may be that too to a certain extent, but she's interesting because of who she is, not merely what she is.  The same is true of all the ladies of OITNB, which is why it's so good."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,elbruce,46,Tue Jul 7 09:21:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of this, but not all of it.   Citing the fact that most WV mothers care about their children seems... irrelevant? There are bad parents everywhere, and the effects of that can be amplified when there's poor sex-ed in schools and poor job prospects, making it near-impossible to leave the region. I don't find it unbelievable that a confused young teenager with zero sexual agency or self-value would sell her body for some soda.   It's weird to point out that the writers ""reduce her narrative to one of familiar self-destruction wrought by bad choices."" That applies to ALL the characters. The flashbacks make it pretty clear that, no matter how human or sympathetic the characters are, they all made mistakes and deserve to be in prison. Having Pennsatucky waffle between comic relief and serious character is awkward, but this too applies to every character. It comes with the territory of trying to do a comedy-drama show.   Also, saying Leanne didn't get any character development this season beyond being ""the bully"" is totally wrong."

He ate a bit of paper. I sincerely doubt that was causative. It was an unfortunate correlation, but surely that's all it was - correlation."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,liah,13,Tue Jul 7 03:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well it's the law though, the law doesn't work on causation vs correlation. Technically, it wasn't her fault. Legally, it was her fault."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,beccabug,19,Tue Jul 7 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometimes laws are dumb. Like the one that sends a teenager (?) to prison for selling a kid paper.  The question is whether or not she deserves it, and my argument is - when compared to the likes of Piper, Alex, Red, Morello, Chang, Nicky, etc. etc. etc. - she clearly just doesn't.   She was a dumb kid who made a dumb mistake. She didn't hurt anyone at all, nor did anything out of malice. It's absurd to me that the American system can penalize someone for fraud for NOT selling drugs.  EDIT: Also, this:   the law doesn't work on causation vs correlation   It kind of does, though, doesn't it? Or at least, it's supposed to. You have to prove that the perp caused the crime; circumstantial evidence (aka correlation) isn't enough to build a case on. She wasn't done for the kid almost dying, anyway, she was done for fraud - which is still kinda ridiculous given the circumstances."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,liah,6,Tue Jul 7 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"I guess that's a good point, she didn't knowingly smuggle drugs or anything but at the same time someone did almost die as a result of her fraud, so it's not like she shouldn't be punished. Maybe prison was overboard though? I mean, she didn't accidentally kill someone with her fake drugs. And she's been on the show for all 3 seasons, and she was there before the show started, so her sentence is pretty ridiculously long for just selling some paper and calling it drugs.  And Idk. The law's just supposed to protect the innocent from criminals, but maybe the term shouldn't be so broad. Circumstantial evidence is enough to get people charged with crimes. And the law doesn't say we need to prove that someone caused a crime, it says we need proof beyond a reasonable doubt that someone committed a crime. There's technically no causation required in there."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,beccabug,10,Tue Jul 7 04:35:02 2015 UTC,I always got the impression that she got a harsher sentence because she was Latina. She also couldn't afford a good attorney.  If Piper or Alex did the same thing at that age they wouldn't have been thrown in prison.

orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,liah,15,Tue Jul 7 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"I thought this article started out strong, and illustrated some important criticisms to the show (especially the teeth thing as a class signifier/using sexual assault as a trope to create sympathy for a character in lieu of other plot devices), but I disagree with some of the conclusions it makes about the show--namely, that Piper and Nicky are more sympathetic than Pennsatucky, or that her backstory doesn't add nuance or complexity to her character as a whole.  That's pretty much total bull shit.  Pennsatucky's story makes her much more sympathetic and relatable, while Nicky's AND Piper's barely do that at all.  Also, I think we're not supposed to view each of these stories in a vacuum, but rather to use the backstories to fill in the context that led these incredibly complex women of such varied experience to wind up in the same place--prison.  I work in a very rough inner city school system and have for years, working extremely closely with very disadvantaged students and their families, so I kind of understand the author's desire to dissolve all the stereotypes and to claim that ""[they] would never ........"" and the fact is, she is right, probably the vast majority of the mothers she is talking about WOULD never ""...."", just like most of the families I worked with would never do or say half the things that The Wire and other shows portray them doing and saying.  But, of course, SOME of them would.  I have seen firsthand mothers who are quite a bit like Pennsatucky's mother, and I definitely don't work in Appalachia!  It happens, it's horrifying, and it plays into our national psyche as a country divided by racism, classism, misogyny, and puritanical views about sex to a very large degree.  Denying the experiences of severely disadvantaged and abused women like Pennsatucky to make a point about classism (a very real problem!) is specious.  And it doesn't even really matter in the end, because the sexual abuse and assault exists in these communities in much higher quantities than in others anyway, so saying they don't WANT it to be like that feels like a reductive detraction of these serious and complex issues, to me.  At the end of the day, it IS like that, and the show is shedding light on that fact, even if the show does so imperfectly.  TL;DR: The author started off strong; she could've done better."
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,alpharatsnest,13,Tue Jul 7 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"This is an example of something I hate. One character does not represent an entire goddamn demographic. This reminds me of when Black Swan came out, and a bunch of articles started popping up about how not all ballerinas are crazy. Uh, yeah, no shit. It wasn't a movie about all ballerinas, it was a movie about one specific character.   It's like the author thinks that the audience is stupid enough to believe that because one character acts a certain way, everyone from the same walk of life is the same. This may come as a surprise to this soapboxer, but most of us have the basic level of intelligence to understand this is an individual character, not the elected representative of all Appalachian-area people. And it's interesting that she's assuming since we see one person like this, we assume all people are like this...however, she can't accept that Pennsatucky's mom would be abusive because she's met some women from that area who aren't. So we as an audience aren't supposed to assume all the people from that area are the same based on this character, but she can assure us that there are no bad mothers because she's met some good mothers. Interesting.   It's also a bit insulting to the writers to say the other meth heads are just flat characters with bad teeth. I personally found Leanne's story surprising, heartbreaking, and compelling. And she's proof enough that they don't need to give a character perfect teeth to make her sympathetic."

There are parents who are like that! Just because the ones this idiot knew would never have said that doesn't mean there's not one who would. I've met a few terrible mothers like Tucky's. They exist. Right alongside the mothers who never talk to their girls about sex because if you never tell them about it and you keep them out of sex ed, they'll never know about sex.   The author is condescending. They think that the audience is too stupid to realize that just because Tucky's mother is a piece of shit doesn't mean all mothers in Appalachia are pieces of shit. They think that we can't realize that different mothers tell their daughters different things about sex and some come out better for it and others come out worse.  Also, the author says that the backstory adds nothing new to Tucky's character. But the backstory is vital to understanding Tucky's reaction. A person's attitude toward sex before being raped is one of the most influential things in their reaction. All we knew before the episode in question was that Tucky had sex often enough to end up pregnant 6 times, miscarrying once and having five abortions."

orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,SuperSkeptik,18,Tue Jul 7 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Here's the copy paste:  In episode 10 of this season of “Orange Is the New Black,” we watch as Tiffany “Pennsatucky” Doggett is raped twice—once in her memory by a boy in her Virginia hometown and once in the present by Litchfield prison guard Coates, with whom she had built a fragile friendship. In its recap, the New York Times’ Arts Beat flippantly titled the episode “Unlucky Pennsatucky.” (It’s worth noting, however, that the recap itself treats her story with gravity.)  The nickname “Pennsatucky” is a riff on “Pennsyltucky,” a term that derives from mashing up Pennsylvania with Kentucky, and which refers to the sparsely populated Western and central sections of Pennsylvania, which are geographically and/or culturally part of Appalachia; the real life Pennsatucky hails from this region, according to the “OINTB” book. In it, Piper Kerman describes Pennsatucky as “a young woman from western Pennsylvania who proudly called herself a redneck” and a member of a group Kerman calls the Eminemlettes—“Caucasian girls from the wrong side of the tracks.” Pennsatucky struggled with an addiction to crack and had lost custody of her child. In the show, she is serving time for shooting a nurse at an abortion clinic in Fishersville, Virginia, who made disparaging comments about the number of abortions she had. “She was like a lost girl,” wrote Kerman.  But Pennsatucky and the thousands of other young women growing up in rural communities in Appalachia, and across the American South and West, are not simply “unlucky”—they are at high structural risk for rape and sexual assault. According to 2012 FBI crime estimates, the states with the highest rates of reported rapes per capita were, in order: Alaska, South Dakota, Michigan, New Mexico and Arkansas. With the exception of Michigan, in all of these states about half their populations or more reside in rural areas or small towns—70 percent in South Dakota. In Alaska, where the figure is 55.5 percent, the rate of forcible rapes per year is 80 per 100,000, nearly triple the national average. “We have an epidemic,” Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell told CNN, whose Sean Sutter did a series of investigative reports on rape in the state last year. New Jersey and New York had the lowest rates of reported forcible rape per capita in the nation.  Recent analyses of rural sexual assault in Pennsylvania—where 60 percent of its counties are rural and home to about one-third of the state’s population—using data from the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape and the Pennsylvania Office of Children, Youth and Families found that rates of rape and child sexual assault were significantly higher in rural counties than in urban ones. They also found that the eight highest rates of rape were in rural counties, and included the three most rural counties in the state.  Nationwide, experts believe the available numbers on rural sexual assault underestimate the problem. A 2003 report from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center found that in rural areas, the numbers of those who seek crisis services far exceed the number of reported rapes. The NSVRC hypothesizes that underreporting, a major factor in all states, is especially pronounced in rural areas because of the low population density, which means victims probably know or have significant relationships with their attackers. Studies like those of Barry Ruback, a professor of sociology at Penn State, have consistently shown that the closer the relationship between the victim and the offender, the less likely a victim is to report. Furthermore, in rural areas, police officers are more likely to be involved in the victim’s social network, say Ralph Weisheit, David Falcone and Edward Wells, authors of “Crime and Policing in Rural and Small Town America.” Other factors that may cause rural rape to go unreported include lack of cellphone reception and public transportation, substandard road infrastructure, and the long distances that must be traveled to reach law enforcement or crisis centers, which may be hours away or in another state.  “Sexual assaults in rural areas are mostly hidden crimes, hidden both intentionally and unintentionally by characteristics of a close-knit culture or an isolated lifestyle,” writes the report’s author, Susan Lewis. “To varying degrees, rural populations are often marginalized from the mainstream power structure, which holds the opportunities for assistance and services through resources and policy initiatives.”  Others point to less tangible factors like a culture that prizes independence from government institutions and family reputation over safety and transparency. “Rural people don’t report unless they have to,” says a program director in a rural community in Pennsylvania, identified in the report only as Tanya. “People in rural communities victimize each other.” Ginger, who directs a crisis center in rural Alaska, said that sexual assault of adult women is nearly universal where she lives and that adult sexual assault is viewed as the norm. Echoes of Pennsatucky’s mother encouraging her daughter to “Go on and let them do their business” (previously we’ve also seen her mother force her to drink a liter of Mountain Dew to secure a higher government assistance check). “If you’re real lucky, most of them will be quick like your daddy. It’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening.”  “OINTB” has generated rich cultural conversations about other pressing social problems that the show’s characters embody, like the treatment of incarcerated trans folks, bisexual erasure and butchphobia, but Pennsatucky’s flashback episode has not started a similar dialogue about sexual violence against rural American women. Why?  “Many people who would bite their tongues and stifle such hostile language about other social groups seem to feel free to spew vitriol and even violent intentions towards ‘rednecks,’ ‘hillbillies,’ members of evangelical Christian churches and poor white people in general,” writes Betsy Leondar-Wright on the blog of Class Action, a nonprofit organization that works to end classism, in 2013 after the first season aired. “In a jumble of sometimes contradictory stereotypes, Pennsatucky, played by Taryn Manning, is at various times a gifted faith healer who speaks in tongues, a homophobe, an anti-abortion zealot, a meth addict, mentally ill, and eventually a violent psychopath. The makers of the show clearly got their only images of rural poor white people directly from the movie ‘Deliverance.’”  This season, however, has seen the evolution of Pennsatucky from this stereotype stew to a more sympathetic character. No longer is Pennsatucky a homophobic villain, but instead she seems to have settled into a role as a fully realized side character—she has more complex emotions, is grappling in a true way with her past; she has been redeemed.  And yet the mechanisms by which she has been transformed into a likable character seem suspect. One of the most marked ways is her appearance—this season her hair is less greasy and pulled back into a neat ponytail, her skin looks smoother and healthier, and most important, she has false, but perfectly white and straight teeth.  As Susan Sered of Bitch points out, ”OINTB’s” creators use rotted teeth to clearly mark Pennsatucky and her former compatriots Angie and Leeanne as white women who are both poor and rural, and thus from a different social and cultural place than Piper and Nicky, or even Norma or Yoga Jones. “Tooth decay is embarrassing. It signifies that supremely unforgivable character trait: not taking care of oneself—a particularly serious flaw in women, who are expected to look attractive,” writes Sered. “More broadly, on one side of the class divide are those with normatively attractive bodies, respectable educational achievements and decent jobs. On the other side are those whose poor teeth and other ‘defects’ are read as signs that they are incapable of managing their own lives.” Would the creators of “OINTB” ask us to sympathize as much with a girl with “meth mouth”? Leeanne and Angie are still somewhat flat characters—a bully and a follower, respectively.  Further, Pennsatucky’s back story, used in a redemptive context this season, is riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés that paint her world as comic and undignified and reduce her narrative to one of familiar self-destruction wrought by bad choices and ignorant, provincial attitudes. In one scene, we see her trading sex for a six-pack of soda—a move that clangs loudly as the product of the imagination of people who have spent little time in the lives of rural people and who are searching for shock value.  Waynesboro, Virginia, where Pennsatucky’s flashbacks are set, is a small city of about 21,000 residents. It is home to the headquarters of the telecommunications company nTelos, sits steps from the Blue Ridge Parkway and is a 20-minute drive from Charlottesville, where the University of Virginia is located. I lived in West Virginia about two hours west of Waynesboro, and worked with teenage girls and their families. The mothers I met wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices; they wanted their daughters to be in loving, healthy relationships. Never would one of them have said, “It’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening.”  Continued to next comment"
orangeisthenewblack,3cbzs3,Radi0ActivSquid,12,Tue Jul 7 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"This is the problem with Pennsatucky’s mother’s advice and with Pennsatucky’s whole sexually traumatic back story—it tries to provide a “reason” for Pennsatucky’s promiscuity and deadening around sex, tries to provide a reason for Pennsatucky herself, appears to be trying to justify a life, which by logical extension, needs justifying. It tells us that the mode we should be using to see Pennsatucky, even current “redeemed” Pennsatucky, is pity. It creates sympathy when for every other character—even those like Nicky and Morello who have reached time and again for self-destruction—we have empathy. Pennsatucky’s past, as written here, in its use of extreme situations only confirms what most Americans previously thought about women like her. While Nicky’s back story adds a layer of nuance and complexity to her character, Pennsatucky’s gives her no such benefit. It’s difficult to imagine a scene in which a rape was perpetrated against Nicky earning her the descriptor “unlucky.”  I suspect that stereotypes about poor rural whites and Appalachians contribute to our tendency to view Pennsatucky as an irresponsible woman who has brought sexual destruction upon herself, or as an unfortunate product of a brutally impoverished culture — or both — rather than reading her rapes as emblematic of an important feminist and humanitarian issue. Women in rural places are at an especially high risk for rape and sexual assault due to structural, not personal, factors. This is the problem with stereotypes—they are recycled stories, they make no new meaning. As long as the stories we see on television confirm our biases and blind spots about place and class, little progress can be made off-screen."

orangeisthenewblack,3ccwe5,maverickLI,9,Mon Jul 6 22:50:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with #2 and #5. I still loved the series, enjoyed the dialogue, etc.   Stella really did seem to be ""eye candy"" and I was disappointed, given that in seasons 1 and 2 even the more attractive characters had depth (which can't be said for some series, unfortunately). And I felt like I was floating through the season; there didn't seem to be a huge amount of climactic build towards the season finale. Suddenly it's just there, and BAM open fence, Judy king, toothpick guard.   Overall I think season 3 has been the weakest, but on the flip side, all of those backstories and side plots show huge promise for season 4 to tie things together."

orangeisthenewblack,3ccwe5,recovering_spaz,7,Tue Jul 7 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"I wish the show would have dealt with the Kosher food problem a little more realistically. If the prison honestly thought inmates were trying to get around the gen population food, they would just make sure the Kosher alternative sucked. I've heard of prisons giving sardines as the Kosher dinner for 30-40 days in a row. And once an inmate ""opts out"" of the Kosher (it is also the meal Muslims can receive) it's almost impossible to get back on the ""religious meal plan""."
orangeisthenewblack,3ccwe5,SpaceFace5000,8,Tue Jul 7 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the examples given in #1.  Leanne's flashback showed why she was stickler for loyalty in Norma's group. She loved her family and her community but felt that the shunning was appropriate and that she has become too destructive to remain among them. I think hers makes more sense if you know more about the Amish faith.  Flaca's also fit, it gave insight into why she was so prideful and competitive. Flaca told her mother over that she wasn't going to end up a seamstress, she had plans and was going to great things! Her luck turned and she finally got one of the best jobs in prison!! And she's a sweatshop seamstress again, her old vocation, shitty as it was, is a dream job in new circumstances. All those years and she her life wasn't where she wanted it to be."

Not really a continuity thing, more of a ""reality"" thing for me is the fact that you can see the characters' state of mind even from the outside: Lorna and Alex, for example, during their breakdowns wore no makeup and basically didn't take care of themselves anymore. It's something that has struck me as really well done, it made me feel like I was watching something real, some real women stuff, while my husband didn't even notice it."

orangeisthenewblack,3cd5o3,trace_mo,7,Thu Jul 9 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because she was the one in charge, and she was the one that screwed up. She was responsible for the corruption. Things in Litchfield aren't going well since MCC took over, but I don't think it's corruption, I think that's just the usual crap of treating people's rights/lives like a business. I don't think there's anything to expose.  She's got a gay husband, she probably just wants to have sex, you know? She was pretty upset and I think she even blamed herself or wondered if it was her not being attractive that made her husband gay, so she probably likes the attention or the knowledge that she's sexy and even has an element of control."
orangeisthenewblack,3cd5o3,HippieSoulPunx,6,Tue Jul 7 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"All of her crimes were covered up and she was allowed to resign quietly. I don't think that she wants to open any of that up again.As for her sleeping with Caputo, she knows her hubby is gay, so she doesn't mind having sex with ""beer can"". I do think she likes powerful men and she is shaping Caputo to not be a such pussy."
orangeisthenewblack,3cd5o3,maverickLI,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's planning revenge.  First of all, her husband's gay and she's not getting her needs met.  At a time in her life when she felt unwanted and unattractive, Caputo made her feel sexy.  She even said shes loves that even though he hates her, he can't resist her.  She just wants to feel wanted by a man.  Besides that, I think she seems alot lighter this season.  She doesn't have as much stress as she did at the prison.  Now she's getting some on the side, I think she's about as content as she can be living the lie she is.  I don't think she's vengeful or resentful right now."

Sasha Abramsky of the Columbia Journalism Review stated that the book ""documents the author’s attempts to preserve her individuality in the face of a gray, impersonal bureaucracy—one based around prisoner counts, strip searches, rules governing the minutiae of life, and continual reminders that prisoners, by definition, have no power, no real autonomy.""

I love O'Neil, he's hilarious! Run nuns!!!  The scene where the guards took Sophia to seg was good too. Think it was Ford and Rodcocker and another dude. They knew it was bullshit but they had to follow orders. And the black female guard, saying she knows when Suzanne is just a bit excited or having an episode. These guards know their shit. The new crowd are obviously useless but it's part of the story. O'Neil probably being my favourite"

From ordering the ""Shot"" quota in season 2, to ordering Sophia into SHU, CO's begrudgingly do as told. When Stella is ""caught"" with the contraband, the CO's know nobody with 48 hours left on their sentence would have that crap in their cell, but it was found in her possession, so she takes the hit."

They seem good at their job, not just in enforcing the rules, but in getting to know the inmates and knowing the limits and etc. Like Maxwell says she knows when Suzanne is just excited, or she needs to go to psych. They care about their job, they care about the inmates, and they pay attention. Especially when they had to take Sophia to SHU, they knew it was a crappy reason and didn't even pretend that it was anything other than that. They treated her with respect and allowed her to go with dignity. Special mention is Bell, because she's freaking hilarious.  Least favourite is also Coates, of course. I never liked him, he always acted very creepy in my opinion, pretty much from the beginning. But also Mendez because he's a sadistic rapist (even if he hasn't forcibly raped anyone, he's sexually assaulted them), Bennett because he's a selfish twit who sucks at his job, and Luschek because of the same reason. He makes me laugh, but as a person, I don't like him."

The rest of the group relies on them, and they're basically the leader.  Red was the mom of her group. Gloria was the mom of Spanish Harlem. Vee was the mom of the black crew, and now Taystee is because she is more responsible and level-headed and caring and can fix problems (like when Black Cindy stole the corn, Taystee stepped in to appease Red)"
orangeisthenewblack,3cbbau,xPawreen,4,Mon Jul 6 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"She's the leader, basically, of the black inmates. Each group has their authority figure, and Taystee is theirs, similarly to how Red is the leader of her 'daughters' and the old women. You can be a maternal figure, like Taystee and somewhat like Red, or you can be like Vee, and the previous black woman before Vee took her place (Wanda?), very tough, quite violent, etc. They're pretty much all laidback, fortunately.  It's like when the CO (the guy Suzanne based her character on, don't know his name) tells Taystee to keep Suzanne in line. The COs will give the leader of the group the chance to deal with the trouble-maker, giving them a chance to avoid being punished. Helps keep things running smoothly."

The whole point of the segment is Boo dying after getting electrocuted by the microwave and upon bring revived realizing that there is no God. My guess is her struggle with her sexuality and being the person she was vs who her parents wanted was resolved partially by that realization, since now her life was all there is and she could begin living for herself .

orangeisthenewblack,3cai9l,HippieSoulPunx,4,Mon Jul 6 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"Looks the same to me. Well, all the flashbacks in the first episode of Season 3 were about their relationships with their mothers. All the flashbacks in the last episode of Season 3 are about their relationships with faith. So with Boo, her relationship is non-existent. She got electrocuted, she was technically dead for a little while, and she didn't see anything. No white light, no god, no Heaven, nothing. So she was happy about it, probably because it allowed her to live her life without worrying about sin."

I wasn't sure if the character was supposed to intentionally get his name wrong, or if there would be legal repercussions in mentioning him directly.   We had Watson and her Nation of Islam father and Cindy's fire-and-brimstone dinner moment.   Also, Morello's first communion where she didn't eat the wafer. I just loved that. ""That's the whole point!"" ""No, mommy, the dress is the whole point!""   Side note: I have a friend who sings at funerals, and when doing a Catholic one she had to sing right after communion was distributed. The wafer didn't dissolve, so she spit it into her hand. Afterward, a priest confronted her because an old woman had told him that she had ""spit up and rejected the body of Christ."" Point being...Catholics take communion VERY seriously, and that makes Morello's flashback all the funnier."

She was sad and very angry - that entire episode she had built up what she planned to do on release: finally getting to be with Jean-Baptiste, and eating dinner at 7:00 - ""like a real person"". Meanwhile, Caputo had asked Fischer to start being tougher on inmates. Wrong place, wrong time - Fischer pissed off Miss Claudette when she was still fragile about her case, so she attacked her, and was subsequently sent to max."
orangeisthenewblack,3c81bi,smartestkidonearth,3,Sun Jul 5 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"She tried to get an appeal for early-release and was denied.

I always look forward to her jokes. I disliked her and her past, but it really melds well/explains a lot about her behaviour. Watching her face submerged under water in the last episode crystallised to me how much of a kid she was at heart."
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,Clitcheese,15,Sun Jul 5 11:21:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't think about her much until this season, but then as she was doing her conversion, she suddenly became one of my favourites!  As someone who is nominally Jewish (I don't practice), what she said about Judaism really hit home for me.  I damn near cried when the Rabbai said ""Ask me again.""  And even though we saw some of her depth, that didn't overshadow her love of life, and expansive, playful personality.  Its all a part of who she is, and it was amazing."

orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,Chickens-dont-clap,36,Sun Jul 5 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"I think she had arrested development from her traumatic childhood. Her dogmatic father was abusive. That would force you to be submissive and silent for so long. It would explain why she is defiant,  acting out and completely childish sometimes. She's doing what she couldn't do back then. But finding a new faith allows her to enjoy something that's just for her. No fire and brimstone like her father condemned her to in the flashback."
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,chocolateraine,5,Sun Jul 5 16:35:42 2015 UTC,Isn't Watson the one whose family was super religious and dogmatic? Or do I have a bad memory and already can't remember Black Cindy's flashback...
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,ddpizza,16,Sun Jul 5 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Black Cindy had a flashback in the same episode as Watson's. She was a little girl at the dinner table and started to sneak food while her father was saying grace. He caught her and yelled at her. It gave me the impression that was a microcosm of her experience with religion.  Edit: In contrast, Watson's family is Muslim, and her dad wouldn't let her accept a track scholarship because he didn't like the track outfits showing so much of her skin. So that was Watson's experience with religion. It is sad because if she had been able to go to college, she probably wouldn't be in prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,sports_and_wine,6,Sun Jul 5 21:13:08 2015 UTC,I believe Watson did go to college on a track scholarship. She got caught up messing with a petty criminal. Like an act of rebellion after her cloistered family upbringing

orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,ddpizza,10,Sun Jul 5 23:03:32 2015 UTC,"I felt like that last bit where she explained how Judaism felt like home to her made me believe she was earnest. Like yes it did start with a solely selfish motivation to get better food, but then when she learned about the religion her motivation changed. Coming from a religious background that was abusive and unfulfilling, I can see how she would outwardly dismiss Christianity but inwardly miss the safety and comfort religion can bring to some people."
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,Jubjub0527,9,Sun Jul 5 20:07:59 2015 UTC,I really liked how sudden the Jew conversion felt.

Black Cindy is also probably in my top 5 favourite characters on the whole show.  I love her joker attitude, she just makes me laugh, she's the perfect example of what you see is what you get.  Maybe its because I tend to enjoy some of the excessively colourful characters, for example, Cesar has also jumped up on my list as hilariously likeable.  Same with Pennsatucky and Maureen.  You can only take so much of the downer characters (ie Soso, Poussey, Sophia). Black Cindy (and Taystee and a few others) really know how to take a shitty situation like prison and just make it fucking work so that they're not moping around all day. :)"

I thought the whole Jewish thing was one of the weaker plot points, and even at the end, I wasn't convinced by her, or I wasn't even sure if she was trying to convince me or just fake it. She just seemed really happy at the end during a very emotional scene, and it was like... well was this little plot really worth it?"
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,envyxd,3,Mon Jul 6 08:53:43 2015 UTC,"I am Jewish, and seeing her submerge herself in the closest thing possible to a mikvah was so beautiful. That entire seen was beautiful though, for all of them. No one really tried to make a break for it, they were just so thrilled for that tiny bit of freedom and the cleansing water. I think she was genuine by that point. I also love how they are keeping Suzanne under control. It's bothered me that they threw Suzanne in with the adult criminal bunch, when she clearly needs some type of therapy (not just drugs) and she truly seems like an uncontrolled child in a grown up body."

orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,envyxd,2,Mon Jul 6 09:08:46 2015 UTC,"I thought it was amusing that they found a way around the system for awhile, and what started out as a path to better food ( apparently MUCH better than the swill that was driving red crazy) turned into something so much emotionally deeper. I thought everyone pretending they were Jewish was kind of funny, but I can see how that may have dragged on a bit too long."
orangeisthenewblack,3c6im9,The_mrs,0,Mon Jul 6 09:15:23 2015 UTC,"I think she's kind of a cartoon and for that reason detracts. Sometimes when she and Poussey and/or Taystee get going hamming it up, it comes off as artificial and as deliberately exaggeratedly stereotypey in a way that pulls me out of the story and makes me a little embarrassed for them. Obviously the show has and needs its comedic elements from each character, but she could use some more depth so she doesn't come off as ""Sassy/Silly Black Lady #3"" from the Burger King commercial or whatever."

orangeisthenewblack,3c64dd,War-Bandit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:12:11 2015 UTC,He definitely tries to be a good husband. Far more so than his wife does anything but use his money and live in his house for free. He even tried to learn her language but nothing's good enough for her.
orangeisthenewblack,3c64dd,eowowen,12,Sun Jul 5 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"I'm failing to see how Healy is a good husband. Because he figuratively beats his wife into submission by providing her a place to live? Because he attempted to learn Russian for her after misrepresenting himself on the Internet? And hey, remember the time he became enraged when his wife wanted to spend time with her friend? How dare she!   Don't get me wrong, I love Healy's complexity. But as much as one wants to argue that his wife is awful, Healy is on the same level. He is a hateful, vindictive, bigoted, volatile, and entitled little man. And while he might genuinely want to impact the world in a positive way, HE is the only one that prevents himself from doing that. He is, in essence, his own worst enemy."
orangeisthenewblack,3c64dd,nightwing2024,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"None of your first paragraph really makes sense with what the show has us see. Regardless of her status as a mail order bride, he does provide a quality home to live in and he tries to be romantic, spontaneous, and thoughtful, trying to plan dates.  And it's not as if we see fun forbid her from seeing her friend(s) every night, he asked if they could reschedule, and then invited her to come along. He's trying to be inclusive by involving her friends and by learning her language. He was rightly upset because she clearly didn't even consider any other option than what she wanted for a moment.  Also, she is in America now, and not speaking in the common language in front of her husband is kind of disrespectful and rude. She should of course be able to keep speaking Russian if there is a transnational problem or if she's alone, but it doesn't look to me (from what we see) that she cares ask that much about Sam's feelings by excluding him from her conversations. It's just plain rude.  He is all of those things you said in the second paragraph, but not really to his wife. Maybe volatile, but not entirely without cause. I'm not Team Healy, the dude is a complete maniac (as I said in another comment) but he isn't a shit husband. He's all of those terrible things mostly away from home, at least from what we see."
orangeisthenewblack,3c64dd,eowowen,2,Mon Jul 6 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"How does it not make sense? The audience is capable of making inferences and assumptions beyond what the show presents to us. Television would be boring if we took writing at face value.  He asked if they could reschedule AFTER losing his temper and screaming at her in front of her friend.  Like I said, Healy is hateful, vindictive, bigoted, volatile, and entitled. He does not lose any of those traits in his role as husband and frankly, in my opinion, that train of thought is dangerous."
orangeisthenewblack,3c64dd,HippieSoulPunx,2,Mon Jul 6 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Healy is a complex character, and I enjoy that. Sometimes he disgusts me, sometimes I like him, sometimes I pity him. I think he's a good person at heart (though he has his flaws), but sometimes things get the better of that. Like when he walked away when Piper was going to be attacked. But then since then he's tried to do the right thing more.  He makes a lot of effort with his wife though, so it was nice to see Red stand up for him and tell it to her straight that she's got a good husband."

Most of the women I know who watched the show aren't jumping to defend Skyler's dumb decisions but they don't idolize Walt either."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,liah,31,Sat Jul 4 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Skyler's dumb decisions were still better than pretty much any of Walt's. I liked Skyler. She was the one who was actually trying to help and protect the family. Walt was just on a giant ego trip. Like, Walter KILLS. PEOPLE. Skyler tries to stop it or get away from it, and she's the bad person? Like, really, guys? Really?  Don and Betty is the same sort of thing. Now, don't get me wrong, Betty's got her moments of being an awful person, but she's got nothing on Don - yet every guy loves and wants to emulate Don, while completely missing the entire point of the show. That he's a totally broken person who will never be happy (they all are, to some degree). I found Betty to be an immensely sympathetic character (the nickname 'Birdie' says a lot), but everyone I talk to think she's the worst thing to ever happen to television because she stopped putting up with Don's bullshit. And the kid-slapping thing, which is fair, but let's not pretend that's when they started to hate her.  It kind of says something about the viewer, imo, and their level of logic and empathy, if they identify and sympathize better with a broken, egotistical, selfish and potentially dangerous male protagonist (Walter, Don is less dangerous physically but emotionally he's right up there) and think he's ""awesome"" enough to emulate, but fail to understand the point of view of a significantly less broken, egotistical, selfish and potentially dangerous female character (Skyler, Betty).  House of Cards is another example. Sopranos can be argued, too."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,CopyRogueLeader,17,Sat Jul 4 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"House of Cards, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Ray Donovan (although to a lesser extent), and Deadwood are all shows off the top of my head featuring absolutely terrible, despicable, sometimes plain evil men who are idolized by a fanbase that completely misses the point of the shows, (that you shouldn't want to be Al Swerengen or Walter White because those men die alone) while simultaneously ripping apart the female characters that are usually just responding to the shitty men in their lives.   Which is why I love Orange is the New Black. It features mostly women, but it doesn't have that air of vapid superficiality like Girls and Sex and the City, and these women are all well-rounded, characters with a lot of depth. Sure, Boo is a self-serving asshole who'll throw red under the bus for her own benefit, but she's also a fiercely protective friend to Pennsatucky. Black Cindy is obnoxious and kind of racist, but she's capable of a lot of growth as evidenced by her conversion. Norma is docile and kind but also a total egomaniac. None of these women are portrayed in black and white, or solidly despicable in any real way (except Vee). Even Pennsatucky is capable of change."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,liah,8,Sat Jul 4 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly why, despite it not quite being in the same league in terms of writing and directing as most of the aforementioned, I find it the most groundbreaking of all of the above.   While I'll always love Mad Men for its exploration of grey areas and humanity, and consider it an overall better show, OITNB is simply doing far more for women and minorities and humanisation than any other show I've ever seen, and for that it's easily my number two show of all time - and I'm super fussy about what I watch."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Throwaway___ok,2,Sat Jul 4 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"Even Vee wasn't black and white though, it's just that the writers showed her dispicable side after her ""good"" side (her maternal role, taking Tastee under her wing, the home cooked meals, family like setting)"
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,banerrycorknut,3,Sun Jul 5 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"I think her ""good"" side was supposed to be entirely an act, though."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,The_mrs,2,Mon Jul 6 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"She only did those things to get her to run drugs. In the end she was truly evil, I think."

orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Loco_Mosquito,3,Mon Jul 6 09:26:52 2015 UTC,"From the beginning, the audience was set up to view Skyler as the bad guy - remember in the first episodes, she nags Walt to take his vitamins at breakfast, and then when there's a family meeting, she insists on using a ""talking pillow"".  She spent a lot of time coming across as the typical nagging harpy wife, and Walt came across as a nutless type B guy whose life was a sad shadow of what it could've been, given his talent.  The series becomes very dark and the Walt character becomes more and more unsympathetic, and Skyler's reactions are very normal and understandable given the circumstances. But first impressions are strong, and a lot of us love a good bad guy (Tony Soprano, Scarface, etc.).  It's not a mystery why people continued to root for Walt and against Skyler even when he's past the point of redemption.  Don Draper is a philanderer, a liar, and a cad, but he's not even a tenth as bad as Walt.  And Betty, a classic narcissist, is a lot more unsympathetic a character than Skyler ever was."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,BlitheCynic,5,Sun Jul 5 16:16:15 2015 UTC,I both love and hate Piper in the same way I loved and hated WW. Fun characters but gaping ass holes the both of them.

While Don Draper and Walter White were never my favourite characters, they were certainly interesting and they didn't annoy me like Piper does.

orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are similar at all.  Don Draper and Walter White did shitty things, but they didn't do them childishly and stupidly like Piper does. That is the main difference. Other characters on the show act similar to DD and WW but don't come off stupid like piper does.  Edit: Also, both WW and DD weren't under any illusion as to what they did and what type of person it made them. Piper does shitty stuff but never seems to realize it is shitty, and on the contrary thinks everyone else is always the issue."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Chuchoter,34,Tue Jul 7 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. She isn't interested in other people. She's a complete narcissist: she never loved Alex; she loved the thrill of being with a drug dealer and the excitement of the drama. She was so flip-floppy between Alex and Stella because when she's bored of one, she flocks to the other. Stella was new and interesting, with an accent and unique tats to boot. Even when Alex's mother was dying, Piper wanted Alex to stay with herself, not to visit her mom."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,recovering_spaz,30,Sat Jul 4 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"Even when Alex's mother was dying, Piper wanted Alex to stay with herself, not to visit her mom.   What? No, Piper realized how dangerous and unfulfilling living with Alex was and wanted to break up. Her mom dying was a sad coincidence.  No one is obligated to stay with a dangerous partner just because the partner suffers a loss."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Throwaway___ok,5,Sat Jul 4 19:58:40 2015 UTC,Finally someone says it
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Jubjub0527,17,Sun Jul 5 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"If you read the book, Piper Kerman basically says that Alex is an ugly butch (comparing her to looking like a bulldog) and you've nailed exactly what ""attracted"" her to Alex: having money, power, and the ability to travel. She quite frankly makes it clear she was using her and allowing Alex to pursue her bc she wanted to travel. She's pretty flagrant about how obviously she used this girl, and presented it in such a way that she'd be surprised that someone would say to her that using people isn't a respectable thing to do (let alone bragging about it). She doesn't see it as wrong bc she sees herself as a better person based on her college education, her fake blonde hair, and her (delusionally off) identification as a pretty girl (read the Amazon reviews if you don't believe me. More than a few people comment on how vapid she is and how often she reminds the reader about how pretty, well educated, and popular she is).  Unfortunately she is the one who inspired the idea for the show, and much more talented people have done an extremely good job with portraying the women in the show. The true ugliness of Piper Kerman is what leaks into and contaminates Piper Chapman."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,panyedelnik,10,Sat Jul 4 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"I've read the book and I totally respect your interpretation of it but honestly, that wasn't my impression at all. To me, it seems that she's very up front and honest about how shallow she was when she was younger and how she honestly believed that her crime was a victimless one. But she also talks about how being in prison forced her to face the reality of the impact of the drug trade on ordinary people. She writes with compassion and in a very non-judgemental way about her fellow inmates and she very candidly acknowledges that her race, looks and privileged background afforded her easier treatment in life and how insanely lucky she has it compared to a lot of women who don't have a voice.  I think her book is very raw and honest and she doesn't try to paint herself in some kind of great light. Objectively, she is wealthy, educated and fulfills most criteria for being considered conventionally attractive by societal standards and she candidly talks about things like her looks and class because these are things that DO give people an unfair advantage in the justice system and she's highlighting that this is unfair. And she's gone on to advocate strongly and actively for reform within the prison system.  I agree that her (brief) mentions of IRL Alex contain a pretty unflattering physical description and comparing someone to a bulldog is pretty mean, but it's also not completely inaccurate to say that IRL Alex would not be considered conventionally attractive in society. I feel like she included that description to kind of ""de-glamourise"" this person so that the story would seem less titillating. I think she was going for brutal honesty but I agree that it came across as pretty unacceptably mean and was a low point in the narrative.   Overall though, I don't get the impression at all that real-world Piper is a bad person. She's certainly no saint but I think she's someone who was pretty messed up and shallow when she was younger, who was forced to face the consequences and reality of that head on and who learned from it and became a better person as a result of it. And she's since tried to take her experiences and use her position of relative privilege to push for active change and reform.  I'm not denying that she's also personally profited immensely in the process but I do feel that she's also done a lot of good in bringing a lot of these inequalities into the public eye.  Edit: Clarity"
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Chuchoter,2,Sun Jul 5 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"I never read the book, actually. I only knew of the book when I first started watching the show, and my friend (we're both English majors) told me it was a horrible read, so I never bothered.   But thanks so much for the info! That answers a ton of questions I had earlier."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,excusemydust,2,Sat Jul 4 20:28:24 2015 UTC,I think you just described why I relate so well to Piper and still hate her.
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,Dirtnose,2,Sun Jul 5 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  I hate her. Completely selfish the entire show, everything just revolves around her, but she constantly gives off the illusion that she cares. It's annoying. The pantie stuff in season 3 is even more annoying.  It's weird though, because I liked Walter White in Breaking Bad, who is kind of similar I guess? I dunno, it's a weird one. Walt was originally trying to help is family is I guess the reason I liked him, but even then, without spoilers, his character shifts throughout the seasons."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,RicochetRuby,10,Sat Jul 4 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"I like her. She's uptight, weak, a narcissist but its fun seeing her try to not be that. Piper is slowly becoming Walter White but instead of loving her, everyone hates her. I don't get why."

orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,panyedelnik,9,Sun Jul 5 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"I don't like her as a ""person"" but as a flawed character I think she's great to watch and I'm really glad that the show gave her a healthy helping of character flaws. I'm actually really enjoying the character development and seeing how she's becoming more openly selfish and messed up. I think the show would be boring if Piper was portrayed as being the ""good guy"" (or even worse, the full on offensive ""white saviour"" type character who waltzes in and helps all the poor/minority people realise the error of their ways).   I like the fact that her selfish, narcissistic side is being laid bare. I also think the writers are really setting her up for a fall, at which point I think she'll be forced to really examine the consequences of her actions on others.  As the series goes on, we see how totally selfish most of her motivations are, how emotionally immature she is and how her bad decisions impact on others and I think it's been very well written so far."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,MyIgnoranceParty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:38:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I also remember seeing some interview in which the creator of the show mentioned that Piper was sort of a Trojan horse in that she wouldn't have been able to get the show made if it wasn't centered around the media-friendly privileged white girl. But once Piper gets the viewer into the prison, the viewer experiences the other characters and their back stories, and it becomes incredibly humanizing.   I feel like the creator doesn't really care about many people liking Piper because most media automatically like her due to her social position. I definitely think humanizing the other characters is more of a priority."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,ajkkjjk52,17,Mon Jul 13 13:22:14 2015 UTC,I think it's mostly just that whenever she's on screen it means we're not spending time with one of the more interesting characters.  It's a watered-down version of Larry Syndrome.
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,War-Bandit,17,Sat Jul 4 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"Because she is immensely myopic and self centered.   Piper being in jail isn't doing a thing to help her become a better person and reflect on the mistakes that she made while she was on the outside. If anything she is just now showing how terrible she is because now she isn't in front of people who expect her to be a perfect WASP daughter.   Also, her abandoning Alex when she needed her because her being paranoid ""wasn't hot"" was just terrible. She gets Alex thrown in jail again and ditches her when she's no longer the confident, sexy drug dealer. Same as when her mom died. When Alex needs Piper, she's gone!  Not to mention her prison gangster thing is behind pathetic.   Piper comes from a well to do family and she squandered the advantages she had in life because she wanted to live edgy. And she has the nerve to think she is somehow a good person."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,banerrycorknut,3,Sat Jul 4 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"Mostly agreed, except for the part about Alex's mom. recovering_spaz put it well in another comment:   Piper realized how dangerous and unfulfilling living with Alex was and wanted to break up.

orangeisthenewblack,3c4dhu,banerrycorknut,2,Mon Jul 6 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I agree - she was able to delude herself into thinking it wasn't that bad, but once she couldn't do that anymore, she left. It was naive of her to think that things were safe just because she couldn't see the nastier stuff going on and could pretend it didn't exist, but she still had every right to leave when Alex started to ask her to carry drugs, involve herself more, etc."

The last few episodes she's walking around just like Vee did, like she's running shit. When you know she's a self centered white girl crisis away from becoming sad, crying poor me Piper.

This has more to do with the writing, but her character is all over the place. I liked the fish out of water vibe we got the first few episodes. She was dealing with the reality of being in prison and learning how to survive. Now she seems to be acting all gangster, in a prison full of real people from the hood. Yet no one ever confronts her on her bullshit. I think what's missing is some type of confrontation or real threat. She had a small one in S1 with Red."

Then she tries to become a good person (lying to Red) then she gets told she's not a good person ugh. I'm tired of her trials with herself when it seems like she knows what she has to do to be a good person but everytime an opportunity comes up she just fails at it. She's been told ""Don't lie"", ""Don't cheat"", ""Stand up for your friends"" and she fails all of this.  I'm also tired of the Alex/Piper relationship because of the same reason. ""Are they dating?"" ""Will Piper cheat?"" ""Lesbian sex scene to titillate the viewers?"" (I was so tired of their sex scenes, especially because they seemed so shoehorned in and cliche)."

Idk how it is for trans people, whether trans women know how to be a man (don't take it too serious, idk a better way to phrase it) before transitioning or they're just putting on an act, but I'm guessing that has something to do with the advice she gave Michael."
orangeisthenewblack,3c41hs,DR6,5,Sun Jul 5 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"What she said to her son are things no one should say to a son, not even if you're a man: a trans woman out of all people should recognize it. If for you ""being a man"" includes being sexist you're doing it wrong.  I see what you want to say, and it may explain well why she said that, but it's not an excuse."

I don't think she's really a misogynist or anything, and I think she generally respects people and wants to raise a good man.  I loved that situation, because it basically amounted to a parent making a mistake and later on feeling shitty about it. Nothing to do with man/woman/trans/etc, just a human being who fucked up and wants to be better for their kid. Dem feels, yo."

Maybe Flaca saw her mom as not being a supportive parent? So she's not a terrible person, but it's still nice that Flaca is trying to help out her mom now that she has cancer.  Outside of that, she sewed false labels onto the clothes she made."

orangeisthenewblack,3c41hs,tesseractive,9,Sun Jul 5 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"Her crime is unusual, and the fact that she has religious people on her side, but Pennsatucky's background story is depressingly common.  I really like that when they tell the stories of their characters, they aren't reduced to the cliches you would assume by looking at them. To me, that's one of the best parts of the show."

So unless she somehow got charged for that, which seems unlikely because that was in Germany and she wouldn't be sent to a minimum security Upstate prison for that, I don't think we've seen it.

If I recall correctly, the first time they spoke, on camera at least, was when she was on the stairs and asked Bennet for some gum and he said no because it would denote preferencial treatment and would look like he liked her, to which Daya said, ""don't you?""  Plus, i think earlier in the episode Daya had mentioned to Aleida that ""that guard"" was always looking at her. <-nevermind that bit, but its still possible that Bennett had his eye on Daya since she got there, it just wasn't really expanded on until they started having scenes together."

That isn't to say people who are the mainstream form of beauty can't act but it adds an entirely new perspective to how we perceive the characters as being more realistic. If all of the inmates looked like Fig or even a prison full of Pipers and Stellas, I'm not sure the show would have been as popular."
orangeisthenewblack,3c43on,aeoliaa,6,Sat Jul 4 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"Prison shows also have an advantage since it is very easy to introduce or remove a character. Transfer someone in, if it doesn't work, send them to Max and try again with a different character. They also expand on existing characters, like Chang, I never thought she could order executions  in the outside world. To me, she started out a little old lady and not interesting.

A big part of me wants to feel that Piper's a self centered stereotypical white girl, playing school yard games in a prison and Alex is just as bad (except for the justifiable paranoia). Then I remember that I'm white (/s) and would probbably experience the same issues, the phrase ""ooh, there's been some research on that topic which shows..."" comes out of my mouth on a regualr basis. But then Piper will have a chat with Red and attempt to completely overturn her entire life in an afternoon and i'm back hating the story.

orangeisthenewblack,3c0rq5,JustOkCaiters,2,Sat Jul 4 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"You've made multiple statements, some of which have truth to them, and some of which are just shit.   1) It's in our DNA to want something attractive. Yes, every community has standards of beauty and there are general universal standards of beauty in humans. For females, you could discuss waist-to-hip ratios. (From my limited knowledge of general sociology courses in college, I can remember this being one of the few universally agreed on attractive female traits.) And of course, face symmetry. But remember that everyone is a special snowflake, so some people are into the outliers.  2) Only ugly people complain about that. Dude, just don't say shitty things, ok? Here, I'll prove you wrong in one sentence. I'm an attractive female and I'm complaining. There's your scientific evidence.   Here's a quick flow chart you can use in the future.  Is what I'm about to say shitty?  No > Go ahead and say it!  Yes > Don't say it!"
orangeisthenewblack,3c0rq5,Soperos,-2,Sat Jul 4 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"1) Welcome to the internet.   Also, people instinctively want what is widely agreed upon to be attractive. Some people think this goes back to us wanting healthy and attractive offspring. Whatever the reason is, that is what people want. I guess ""the truth hurts"".   2) Attractive by who's standards? I can tell you I'm a gorgeous ripped 6 foot tall model. See: Welcome to the internet.   Is what I'm about to say shitty?  No> Go ahead and say it.  Yes> Go ahead and say it."
orangeisthenewblack,3c0rq5,nicogor,2,Sat Jul 4 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're really oversimplifying the ""attractiveness"" thing. I wasn't going to engage you because I'm pretty sure you're a troll or a teen...but there are various studies and most point to people being most attractive to people who look like themselves.  Why? Who really knows but it's probably to pass down your current traits to your offspring. Also, attractiveness does become relative when it comes to real life scenarios and there are a variety of other factors that make people attractive to one another.  That being said, yes, people can reach a general consensus on someone being attractive. However, even the most beautiful person can make an ugly cry face.  Which was the heart of my comment.  Let's knock someone down who is trying to convey a human emotion because fuck it, women are suppose to always strive to be as attractive as they can be regardless of their circumstance.  So, you missed my point. Congratulations.  Unless you are a troll, then, well, try harder."

orangeisthenewblack,3c356p,kindraness,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Why? This is a common direction for storytelling in general. The main character is either unlikable or neutral to the point they aren't as interesting. Because the main character is typically written as an insertion style character - if you make every character overly interesting them most people won't relate to them because they become too much their own person and Piper was always meant to be the character most of the audience latches onto (and, if I may be frank, seeing a lot of the judgement of her confirms this. Piper ironically gets a lot of pretty petty hatred, often for contradictory reasons, and I think it just demonstrates how much the audience is truly like her).   Most hero movies are like this. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Matrix - films like that all rely on the main character not being nearly as interesting as all the people around them. Same thing. It's not that Piper is unlikeable. It's that she's not as interesting, because she's too much like the audience and she doesn't have the romanticized, traumatic backstory."

Plenty of shows have characters people don't like. But I'm specifically talking about the main character.  Joffrey Baratheon - He was the main antagonist, not protagonist.  Walter White - Really? People didn't like Walter White? There were times when he wasn't like-able, sure. But I think most people loved Walter White.  Sheldon Cooper - Listen...if you hate Sheldon Cooper, then you most likely hate the entire show. Fans of The Big Bang Theory consider him a favorite. I think he's a terrible character.

His reach was at least national, Heisenberg was mythical.  The cancer also helps him because to the viewers, he had a cause. But I think his appeal lay mainly with how he had started as a normal man and became an almost God like figure in the drug business.  With Piper, she's more realistic as a person and is more like people the average viewer would know. And she didn't have an 'excuse' like Walter did and sometimes she comes off as doing things out of boredom or a similarly petty reason. She is that fuck up friend or relative you want to smack because they keep screwing up.   I hated Walter White, though. He fucked up lives and people wound up dead because of his ego. And he was terrifying. Piper is just irritating as fuck but I would rather be in a room with her than Walter White"

The other characters in the prison are much more colourful because they didn't grow up in suburbia with wealthy parents. They didn't have rich people problems, so I love learning about them. I love learning about who they were before they got into prison, and why they act the way they do.   What was interesting about Piper initially was that she was atypical in prison. It was interesting watching her acclimate to prison life. It was interesting to see what went on in prison from her perspective. With that said, I feel like her character is now jumping a shark. To make Piper more interesting in the series SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!!!! she starts an underwear scheme. This is very much unlike her character. It doesn't make sense for her to do this. She is a follower, not a leader. I feel like the only reason why the writers did this was to break up Piper and Alex, and to bring in Stella. I can see Flaca doing the underwear scheme, but not Piper."

orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,FriendOfYellingBird,28,Fri Jul 3 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"What I liked most about Cesar is that he genuinely cares about Daya.   I believe that Aleida is doing time on his behalf, and the best guess right now is that Daya is as well.  The quincanera thing now feels very creepy to me. Cesar had been an authority figure in Daya's life since her 15th birthday (at least) and he later slept with her."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,recovering_spaz,8,Sat Jul 4 04:10:56 2015 UTC,Wait what...he slept with her!!!! :OOOO!!!
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,recovering_spaz,12,Sat Jul 4 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"Mhm, at was shown in Daya (and Aleida) 's season 1 flashback (The Chickening). Whether it was to get back at Aleida or to ensure that he'd continue paying rent on the family apartment is up for audience interpretation."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,GreenWithLove,9,Sat Jul 4 05:20:31 2015 UTC,Oh man...fuck Cesar then.
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,Moskvalalala,13,Sat Jul 4 05:25:13 2015 UTC,She did throw herself at him and he looked pretty surprised but didn't say no. He wasn't the initiator though.
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,GoneWildWaterBuffalo,8,Sat Jul 4 12:41:17 2015 UTC,He did however creep on her prior to that with general looks/comments
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,War-Bandit,24,Sat Jul 4 21:56:49 2015 UTC,"Lady Stache just wants to get the baby for reasons of her own, she doesn't care about Daya   Disagree with this part. I got the sense she did genuinely care for Daya."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,War-Bandit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:00:48 2015 UTC,"I guess we will see what happens. My impression was that she was being nice to Daya in the sense that you would be nice to someone that has something you want.   I can't see her ultimately being benevolent towards the person who put ""sweet pea"" in prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,Throwaway___ok,7,Sat Jul 4 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Doubtful. She even tried to make sure Daya was not rushing into giving away the baby by letting Daya get to know her.  If Daya signed over the kid, she would have never gotten it back. Especially considering how she lives at home."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,maverickLI,-1,Sat Jul 4 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yes but then Daya figured out that she couldn't sign over the baby until after the birth. Daya couldn't have ""rushed into"" giving away the baby even if she wanted to."
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,ValdemarSt,3,Sat Jul 4 22:14:29 2015 UTC,Yes but Daya herself said she'd do it right now. Obviously can't legally do that but it shows she was prepared right have everything done and over with. She clearly did want to.  StacheMom didn't.
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,War-Bandit,-1,Sat Jul 4 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes but my only point is that Daya still has what she wants, the baby. If she suddenly started not being nice to Daya, Daya could still change her mind. IMO it is self-interest that keeps her being nice to Daya. She'd have to be an idiot not to be nice to her if she actually wants that baby. Let's see how she treats Daya after she gets what she wants, that would be the true test if she cares. Acting like she cares before Daya signs over the baby is just common sense, it's not necessarily a sign of true caring.   The sign of character is how people treat someone that can do nothing for them, not how they treat people that have something they desparately want. Mary Steenbergen is like the ultimate ""nice lady"" and I just really don't feel that the show will play that straight and have her being a savior. But we shall see...one year from now (argh!)"
orangeisthenewblack,3c1kd4,Throwaway___ok,4,Sun Jul 5 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"But she knows her son is fucked up, that's part of the reason she wants the baby, to redeem herself. Like when she went to visit him in prison, he said he didn't rape anyone, or at least not Daya. She probably knows if it wasn't her, some other girl would've landed him in prison (because he's a rapist and all)."

orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,aprildenise,7,Sat Jul 4 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Worst of the 3 seasons in my opinion also.  So much about it that I disliked when weighed against the first two seasons, that being said, it did finish pretty strong as I liked the last episode the best of the whole season.  Leaves the door open for a really interesting season 4... IF they can write it well."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,OdangoAtama,9,Sat Jul 4 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't even realize this season was disliked before I went here. I thought Season 3 was the best, but they're all great. If you don't enjoy it, just stop watching and watch something else, man."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,Cyanr,3,Sun Jul 5 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"I just finished Season 3 last night. It gets slightly more interesting around mid-late season. Some of the insight you get for the characters (I won't spoil anything) were actually kind of interesting. Honestly, the final few episodes had some great moments.   I agree with you, the first few episodes were utter crap, and totally uninteresting. In my honest opinion, however, it does get better. The setup for season 4 is quite interesting as well. There were some really great flashbacks to pre-prison life, and callbacks to previous moments in the prison. The last 3 episodes (in my opinion) were on par or better than most, but not all, of the episodes in season 2. Worth a watch I think."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,daavoo,6,Sat Jul 4 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"I literally finished it minutes ago. Love the show in general but this season was the weakest in terms of writing, so many stupid things happened and so many actors seemingly leaving for whatever reason.  Still worth a watch though IMHO."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,iamacompletetool,6,Sat Jul 4 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I loved this season. All the action in season two was good but towards the end all the Vee arc was getting me really nervous and edgy, and this season felt like a break from it. I loved the character development, I loved to see more back stories and the development of the ones we had started to see, like Pennsatucky and Daya/Aleida. But to be honest, my approach on watching this series is much more character than action based, and I think this season has been fantastic for me."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,Airine,3,Sat Jul 4 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with the common thread here, that this season has the weakest writing. The panties/Norma things went on far too long.   I love Boo even more now, likely because she looks strikingly like my juniour high gym teacher.  Last 10 minutes of the final episode made me weep."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,Bigfred12,2,Sun Jul 5 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"This season has no villain and no overarching storyline. That's the issue with it. It's just a series of stuff happening.  Jenji Kohan can start a series, the issue is, she just can't finish one. Everyone worried that the same thing that happened to Weeds would happen to OITNB. And... it did. Really wish she would hand off the show to someone else and step down."

Look at Lost, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Dexter, Sopranos, to name a few. Walking Dead seems to be starting to muscle out of their dip. And House of Cards had a pretty lackluster 3rd season.   Even the hardcore fans of those shows admit to a huge lull in the middle of explosive starts and finishes.   Edit; coherence."
orangeisthenewblack,3c4w1r,PM_YOUR_PANTY_DRAWER,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:26:20 2015 UTC,I started to cringe at the episode when Piper gives the speech to Boo etc about liberating their panties and also at the erotic novel subplot...  it I felt like it bounced back sufficiently in the last few episodes that I still won't miss S4 though.

orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,everyonegetsastar,85,Thu Jul 2 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Of all the people on that show, she's the one who needs makeup the least but wears the most. It just underscores the fact that she was hired for who she is and the image she projects all the time, not to play a specific part."
orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,DeepStuffRicky,38,Fri Jul 3 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"The whole character felt implausibly inconsistent with the show, and the makeup really pronounced it. I don't know if anyone will connect to this, but on Scrubs there was a character, The Janitor, who never spoke to anyone but JD through the first season. This is because the creator played with the idea of him being a figment of JD's imagination entirely. I kept thinking that Stella was just in Piper's head. She came out of nowhere, and maybe that was to highlight how fickle Piper really is and that she craves the drama, but Ruby's perfect polish, her total lack of depth, and the lack of dramatic generosity (or maybe just lack of developed talent), ejected me from the prison in every scene.  Honestly, most people call her Ruby Rose--not Stella--because it really just seems like she was playing herself. And I don't mean to throw shade at the lady--she's super attractive and pretty thrilling and skilled as a model--but the stunt casting was so at odds with the show's ethos. And I don't mean casting a big name--I honestly didn't know who she was before--but casting someone porcelain to play someone porcelain, that was disappointing."
orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,pandafaux,26,Fri Jul 3 06:14:58 2015 UTC,"I had qualms about this too because I did sincerely feel that the makeup was one of the few less exaggerated things about the show. Piper is seen in flashbacks with full makeup and cute hair/outfits, as was Alex. But Alex's makeup in pervious seasons pissed me off the same way Stella's did."
orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,ptoftheprblm,6,Thu Jul 2 23:16:21 2015 UTC,"Well in season 1 Piper got foundation for Sophia and nail polish for Ms. Claudette. I'm not sure if she got it from the commissary or from her friends, but it seems like prisoners can get makeup. Sophia has a full salon so her haircut is not that unreasonable, and I think since her sentence was so short she didn't get to the point the other prisoners had of looking all plain and worn down. Just my thoughts.   That said, I do agree that Stella's character was weak. I liked the concept of her but not the execution. Only having her in scenes with Piper made it feel like she was an extension of Piper and not an individual person."

orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,Ninjakittten,44,Fri Jul 3 03:44:46 2015 UTC,The character seemed so pointless to me. There was NO chemistry between her and Piper. When Stella kissed her for the first time I was super confused!
orangeisthenewblack,3bx38t,ynocfyinco,9,Fri Jul 3 04:33:41 2015 UTC,Here here.  I thought the makeup was really distracting and ridiculous.  As well as the rest of her character.

I would have to reflect and I'm unsure if I would be sympathetic to her as a person. But as a character she's really great because, hey, not everyone is perfect or has their shit figured out. She is a person stumbling and trying to find her way, that's really attractive to me for a character."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,NewMerril,14,Thu Jul 2 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"She's a good anchor for the rest of the cast and I like that her viewpoint as the protagonist, more or less, is hobbled by the unreliability of her personal filter. The audience quickly learns that Red isn't scary at all, really, but seen through Piper's eyes she's terrifying in those first few episodes. Part of the genius of the show is being introduced to characters and situations through Piper's eyes and then learning more and realizing just how much she doesn't get. She is the perfect person to be the center of this universe."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,DeepStuffRicky,38,Thu Jul 2 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"I really like Piper, I think she is the most complex character and she nails home some hard truths to other characters. I think she gets a really unfair response from fans simply because she is the one who hurts the fans most beloved characters e.g Alex and Stella.  Piper is also not neccessarily a bad person either, she stands for equality and I personally think is generally quite a good 'moralistic' character."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,xBwainFweeze,22,Thu Jul 2 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with her being a moral character. I think she wants to think she is a good person, but deep down she really isn't. She backstabs people and is extremely manipulative."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,Ninjakittten,22,Fri Jul 3 01:06:55 2015 UTC,"I think she's very human. She is like most people inherently self involved, meaning she is mostly concerned with her own needs, wants, and desires. That's true of everyone in the series.  I think Piper in the show has had to deal with feeling abandoned by her fiancé, old friends, and feeling rejected and dealing with disappointing her family. She's someone who comes from privilege & wealth and she's now in this prison environment where not only does all that not matter, but to most of the other inmates she looks pretentious even though she doesn't really mean to. This whole season for her has been her attempt to reclaim some sense of power. Shes been trying to do so this whole series I think. In season one and two she listened to others and tried following the rules and kept getting screwed over, by people working in the prison, by her fiancé, by folks she thought were her friends. She does shitty things to others but people are just as shitty to her.  Now she's trying to gain a sense of control and self respect on her own terms… personally I think what she's doing is going to bite her in the ass next season unless she ends it. I think what we are seeing in her is how prison can change people. She probably would not have become so ruthless if she has never gotten caught, but she also wouldn't best confronted with her flaws either.   I'm very curious to see if they try to redeem her in the path of the real Piper or if she completely self destructs."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,Fey_fox,2,Fri Jul 3 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"I will give you that..her family, which the exception of her brother are terrible and the most unsupportive people.   But she cheated on Larry with Alex. Yes it was pretty low for him to go shack up with her best friend, but they were in such similar shitty situations that is was really hard not feel sorry for the both of them.  Alex is no better than Piper. She uses people continuously, especially  when she named Piper in her confession which led to her getting released. They both claim to have such a strong bond, but will shit on it time and time again."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,Ninjakittten,10,Fri Jul 3 03:32:03 2015 UTC,"I still like her the same.  She came in like she had it all figured out, but she has learned how to play the game.  I can't get mad at her for that.  THANK GOD Larry and her shitty friend weren't in this season.  I was dreading it every episode."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,motownphilly412,19,Fri Jul 3 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially on hating Stella, she was such a filler."

orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,ytotrip,10,Fri Jul 3 05:12:37 2015 UTC,"Piper was different this season, but I found it hilarious and was laughing hard at all her scenes. she was way more comical this season and she even reminded me of Lucy (i love lucy). especially the scene where she makes her speech on the lunch table."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,biggmeech,7,Thu Jul 2 22:54:37 2015 UTC,I like her. People say that she has no chemistry with the other actors but I feel like she does.
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,TheFourGuy,6,Fri Jul 3 02:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think she's an awesome character, but has become more and more of an asshole since she arrived at Litchfield. Small wonder though, it IS prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,UrbanCowgirl79,3,Fri Jul 3 01:36:53 2015 UTC,"I liked her a lot better this season. She was actually funny and entertaining and interesting and not whiny. As a person she's an absolutely terrible person but she's always been a pretty terrible person all in all, just like nearly everyone else on the show when you really get down to it - they're not supposed to be perfect people. Now she owns it, and that makes her a lot better in my eyes in terms of entertainment."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,kindraness,3,Thu Jul 2 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"I thought Piper was a little annoying, but I don't not like her. She is definitely not the most interesting character, though. I think being in prison for almost a year, she is starting to think like an inmate instead of someone who has no clue about prison."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,sports_and_wine,2,Thu Jul 2 21:31:03 2015 UTC,I used to hate her until she snapped and beat the shit out of pennastucky and from that point onwards she's been one of my favorites. The influx of new inmates is gonna show if she can live up to who she's trying to be
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,Throwaway___ok,2,Fri Jul 3 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. Taylor Schilling plays her descent into madness so well, so I think that's why, for me. She's still insufferable as a character, but I laugh so hard when her eyes start to widen when she's about to do or say something ridiculous. Hell, even the Netflix home screen pic of them (in the saint candles) contains her slowly-becoming-batshit expression, and I love it!"

orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,dream6601,2,Sat Jul 4 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Same. I disliked her since season 1. She's been doing all of the annoying stereotypical pretentious white girl stuff, like correcting others, talking in that tone (I'm sure you know what tone I'm talking about), and a whole heap of other things that accumulated together. I guess her narcissism is what bothered me too. She says that she lied so she wouldn't hurt someone's feelings, but it's really so that she doesn't have the appearance of hurting someone's feelings when that person cries and someone walks by and sees Piper beside a crying person."
orangeisthenewblack,3bwfim,Chuchoter,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:43:42 2015 UTC,I actually like her because of this season. Season 2 painted her as so boring that I just couldn't wait for her scenes to end so we could see someone interesting.

Even if he gets to know about the trials and the stalking charges, he'll think Cristophah was overreacting.  But I could definitely be wrong. I can't wait to see how their relationship will develop throughout the next season.  EDIT: I typed Norma instead of Lorna. I'm now shipping Norma and Vince."
orangeisthenewblack,3by2d3,Auriora,9,Fri Jul 3 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"Christopher will probably go to the police about getting beaten up, especially if Vince mentioned Lorna's name while he was throwing punches. Vince needed to let Christopher know which girl to leave alone, right? It wouldn't take long for the cops to figure out who Vince was.  Of course, Christopher might be too scared of Vince and his crew to say anything."
orangeisthenewblack,3by2d3,Throwaway___ok,7,Fri Jul 3 03:05:38 2015 UTC,I think him being dismissed when Lorna broke in his house is gonna dissuade from reporting.

It's hard for me to dislike someone who's done something terrible when I had two seasons' worth of episodes of her not being horrible. So I like her and I'd like to see her and Vince be happy together, they seem to suit each other well.  Alas, it is a drama/comedy, and those shows need conflict. It won't last long, but I hope I'm wrong."
orangeisthenewblack,3by2d3,War-Bandit,4,Fri Jul 3 22:24:48 2015 UTC,No way to tell.   We still don't know that much about him. He may be dumb enough to continuously believe Morello's claims that she was the one hurt by Christopher.
orangeisthenewblack,3bygpt,motownphilly412,7,Fri Jul 3 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think the writers are intentionally vague. The only 4 characters that we have actually seen in any courtroom are Piper, Alex, Morello and Doggett. There have been discussions here about why certain characters would end up in a Federal Minimum Security Prison based on what we know about their back stories."
orangeisthenewblack,3bygpt,maverickLI,2,Fri Jul 3 16:41:42 2015 UTC,I think they are too - so they don't necessarily have to worry about letting people out at a certain time (especially not knowing from the beginning how popular the show would be). This also allows them to have inmates have extra time added if they want them to stay in jail. Unless they explicitly say it I don't take it literally.

In a few back stories, it shows an inmate committing a crime. Let's take Norma's story. She pushes the guru off of a mountain, this might have NOTHING to do with why she is in Camp Litchfield.

I think my attention span is just better suited to a TV episode than a longer movie, plus I prefer it when they can get into more character development over a season of TV. Doesn't always work out that way, and there end up being a lot of bad storylines and characters start doing weird things once TV shows go on for a while, but in theory I like the idea of TV better. There are definitely movies I like, though. I just don't watch new movies much.  And I must have seen Free Willy when I was a kid, but I don't have a memory of Lori Petty.

The antagonist from the first season, Pennsatucky, was more of a protagonist this year than Piper. I think they're just highlighting the ways in which prison is making her even more selfish and cold than she was to begin with. It was more or less her selfish coldness that got her put in there in the first place, because Alex named her partly to soothe the grudge she still carried against Piper for abandoning her."
orangeisthenewblack,3bvwcl,DeepStuffRicky,9,Thu Jul 2 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. To be honest I think the transition for Piper has helped to broaden out her character from being some silly little girl who made a mistake a few years back, to someone who's been affect from all these events happening around her."
orangeisthenewblack,3bvwcl,Thisryanguy,2,Fri Jul 3 00:06:52 2015 UTC,Yeah i second this. They are probably trying to show the way that prison changes people in different ways

I think maybe Jenji Kohan likes female leads who are kinda narcissists/shitty people. It's not something you see with a female lead too often but like, look at a show like House or Breaking Bad."

orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,banerrycorknut,14,Mon Jul 6 03:04:17 2015 UTC,It also seemed like season 1 and 2 had a major plot point whereas season 3 was very scattered. It was very clique based and then all of a sudden it was a panty business. Season 1 and 2 seemed to have more going on as an underlying story line.
orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,Letshaveanightcap,7,Thu Jul 2 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. That was my main problem following this season. There wasn't much to go episode to episode from. Besides, Piper has like 3 long winded speeches about the panty business then it started to dissolve. Stella was a giant yawn... There was no underlying element to be able to place where you are in the story. I have a friend that is a few episodes behind but I can't remember which one because there's no big storyline to use as a marker."
orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,blaketh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:37:32 2015 UTC,I feel like they could have realy developed some of the characters. When they did the story between red and V in season 2 there was so much depth. Yeah ruby rose I've been a fan of forever but it seemed like she was sprinkled in for no reason. Vause was paranoid for what? Everyone just seemed a bit lost. It almost felt like season 3 was a warm up for season 4. And let's be real. Piper ain't no thug
orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,Letshaveanightcap,12,Fri Jul 3 10:09:52 2015 UTC,"Also, The Time Hump Chronicles give her a creative outlet in season 3 that she didn't have before."
orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,Bird_Tooth,10,Thu Jul 2 14:57:20 2015 UTC,My wife started rewatching the first season after we finished the 3rd one and I was thinking the same thing. They really watered down Suzanne.  But it's also because she had lots of personal character development. :)

orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,mahnkey,10,Thu Jul 2 07:35:23 2015 UTC,"This show is very thorough in imparting the message that everybody has a fuckton of facets to their character and nothing is as it seems at first glance. Would the experience of the show be as rich if everybody was sitcom-consistent? Imagine if Crazy Eyes had had as little development or as few surprises as, say, Sheldon on Big Bang Theory. Her flakiness would probably be getting on your nerves by now if she was still as intense as she was in the first season."
orangeisthenewblack,3bucof,DeepStuffRicky,5,Thu Jul 2 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of the characters mellowed out in this season, and if anything the show has started to feel more sitcommy. They're making all the original cast into protagonists. Crazy Eyes ain't even crazy no more. It feels like they're going to drag out the series for another 6 seasons."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,summerdaze17,71,Wed Jul 1 17:23:00 2015 UTC,I think this season was to help set up the series without Piper and Alex.

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,giveemhellkid,52,Wed Jul 1 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"That's why Piper won't be leaving...because the show is based off of the book centered around the real life Piper Kerman.

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Krunchy1736,33,Thu Jul 2 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was great. Season 2 was even better, though I thought V was one of those quintessential Disney villains that dragged on a few episodes too long, but the season finale had me jumping up and shouting because it was so good! Season 3 things calmed down and very much feels like a filler season. It had some good character development and was nice to see something besides Piper and Alex in the spotlight. Overall it was just a weird season that didn't really grab me like the other two. Though it did get me to like Penssatucky which I didn't think was possible. The finale was... strange. I hope in season 4 they really kick it up a notch to make up for the lull from 3."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,nilok1,14,Thu Jul 2 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"I've always said this is the flip-side of having a entire season released all at once.  In a regular network show the season starts in September, runs through May and then you only have to wait four months to the next one.  With OITNB or House of Cards you get it all at once.  And unless you've got a lot of self-control, you're going to see it all in a week-end, maybe two and then it's a whole year before the next one."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,JRutterbush,89,Wed Jul 1 09:36:05 2015 UTC,"Come back from what? They didn't escape or anything, they'll end up going back as soon as one of the guards comes to get them. Most likely what will happen is that Season 4 will start with the prison on lockdown, but nobody will get in any real trouble because Caputo won't want to admit that he somehow managed to let the entire prison population get outside the fence."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Lefthandbat,48,Wed Jul 1 09:41:27 2015 UTC,The impression I got was that the lake actually acted as a barrier and they couldn't escape anyway. Someone made a comment that suggested this at least. So short of anyone swimming to freedom they'll all be back.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,GoneWildWaterBuffalo,35,Wed Jul 1 10:16:15 2015 UTC,"There could be an accessible route from the road because somebody was delivering Chang's oranges there. But none of the other prisoners would have known that, and I doubt it'd be obvious.   Unless they deliver the oranges by boat. That wouldn't surprise me actually. Chang must have climbed pretty high in the mafia so she'd have lackeys who would be willing to do stuff like hike through a forest and row across a lake just to get her fresh oranges."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,liamwenham,12,Wed Jul 1 11:12:30 2015 UTC,"That's a point, Chang knows that there's a way out there- was she part of the group who went to the lake? If so she might attempt an escape"
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,alive1,50,Wed Jul 1 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"No she won't. The whole point of that scene was that they wanted to enjoy a moment of freedom, joy and play in the water. Nobody there even thought for a second to escape. NOBODY. The reasons behind this are outlined in the episode where Angie escapes prison because of a name/ID fuckup and Caputo goes to get her at the bus terminal."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,liamwenham,0,Wed Jul 1 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"I guess, but also they all knew it wasn't a point of escape- apart from Chang. I guess if you know you can't escape but can play in a lake you will, unless you know that there is a way out there, ya know?"
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,alive1,12,Wed Jul 1 11:38:25 2015 UTC,well obviously any place outside the prison is a way out there. If they wanted to escape they could just walk in one direction for a while until they hit a road or something. What I'm saying is it doesn't matter if they believed it was possible or not - none of them even considered doing it.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,davis98,2,Wed Jul 1 11:49:56 2015 UTC,Yeah Watson even said that it was inescapable.

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,corlyboo,2,Wed Jul 1 09:50:11 2015 UTC,"The ending was very weird to me.  I get that they were just excited to have some fun at the lake, but the whole time I was wondering ""is this really how they want to end the season"".  I guess I was looking for something more climatic like the last two seasons.  Also, I'm very concerned about Daya's baby."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,EllieNora,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Daya's baby is going to be fostered or adopted out through the system (I don't think they can technically do that, since Daya didn't forfeit her baby?)

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Snowfire870,22,Wed Jul 1 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"But it isnt happy not at all. To the old prisoners its a psuedo happiness because they dont know what awaits them. Remember not a single one of them knows about the bunk beds or about the mass influx of new prisoners. The main story still is centered around Piper IMO, as soo as she became the big fish in a little pond(ie her panty business and becoming all ""hard"") the fence opened up to a lake and she no longer that big fish. I couldnt help but see symbolism in all that happened in the last couple of episodes"
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Lilusa,5,Wed Jul 1 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"even though apparently the storyline doesn't change much   I would say that rather than there being 1 main story throughout the season (like the Vee plot from S2), there are many smaller plots throughout the series that are more character focused rather than action focused."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,69ingJamesFranco,37,Thu Jul 2 06:10:26 2015 UTC,"Underwhelming ending, Stella storyline fell flat, Nichols gone, Bennett just flat out left, Mendez was ruined, hopefully Sophia comes back, cult of Norma, Healy and Red, overall was too lighthearted.  I did actually really like Norma's back story though, Red returining to the kitchen even though the circumstances now aren't all that great, Big Boo and Pennsatucky's storyline was my favorite part of this season, Chang was great, and Soso's arc made me happy. Also Suzanne's alien erotica bits I enjoyed as well.   These are just my thoughts, but overall I was letdown."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,HoneyBunchesOfAwesom,25,Wed Jul 1 13:04:40 2015 UTC,Yeah ... Bennett leaving was just sort of ... insincere. It felt like it wasn't right.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,sentimentalpirate,19,Wed Jul 1 12:27:49 2015 UTC,I firmly believe he left in order to call the raid on daia's shitty relative. The one that Bennett met with a few times.  Guards didn't talk about him leaving. It seemed out of character for him. The writers didn't explore his internal conflict for leaving. So the thing that makes the most sense is that his disappearance was written that way to allow for a big reveal later on.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,moemoemoe2,8,Wed Jul 1 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"It could be to show how people can just disappear with zero notice to get out of being a father.  That, or shitty writing."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Kezika,3,Wed Jul 1 16:12:19 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me. The gun think with Cesar could've been a ""take a good look"" moment and he realized that   A.- His son/daughter was going to have to grow up in a home with a guy that would be pulling a gun on it for not eating french fries  B.- That technically he could never legally be considered the father of the child because the act of being that childs father would reveal him as a felon.  So he wanted out, but he knew Cesar was dangerous and already showed up and broke into his apartment once, so he just needed to flat out disappear. So that's exactly what he did. He made himself fall off the face of the planet to everyone that Daya would remotely be able to get in contact with. Then possible even called in a hint to the DEA about drugs just for extra insurance that Cesar wouldn't be able to seek him out."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,ReMarkable91,3,Wed Jul 1 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"Plus the baby is most likely up for adoption. He could say I take it, I feel bad for her."

He was resistant all the way up til the beginning of the episode where he disappeared."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,thatputa,5,Wed Jul 1 23:22:23 2015 UTC,I was like 10000% sure he would return in the last episode and I felt like dying when he didn't
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,they_call_me_dewey,6,Wed Jul 1 16:09:30 2015 UTC,I agree they sort of just left it hanging. But I think he just realized that this nice woman he met at work and fell in love with has a family full of dirtbag criminals that he would never be able to get away from or insulate his child from so he just gave up.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,roblee8908,2,Wed Jul 1 17:16:35 2015 UTC,He left to start a life somewhere else in which he will find a way to bring the mom and baby to live with him in. Probably another country. Calling it now.
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,YouHadItComing,11,Wed Jul 1 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"I loved it.  It's my favorite so far.  I like that they really focused on building up each character.  I think the lack of a big bad guy helped the show air out and explore some new things.  I could not stand the Vee conflict last season.  She was so obviously manipulative, and people just kept playing into her hands. I was facepalming all season.    I felt like this season was way less predictable and much more emotionally jarring, at least for me.  I think the Pentatucky rape scene, especially when shown after her flashbacks, was possible the saddest moment in the entire series."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,SilverPandaBear,4,Wed Jul 1 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"I agree in so far that I felt there was something lacking in Season 3, which didn't put on par with the other two seasons. However I did still enjoy it, I liked that it was a lot more lighthearted than the other two seasons. I also felt it was great that they started to develop new character relationships and storylines. They didn't really tie off many of the storylines, which puts them in a good position to continue them in Season 4. It was still a great season and I would definitely recommend watching it and not skipping the season!"
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Autumn-Moon,6,Wed Jul 1 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was. Nothing happened. The whole used panty thing was stupid. I hated Stella and I didn't even know it was possible to hate Piper anymore than I did before. What happened to Bennett? What happened to Nicky? It's BS that they didn't even hint what was going on at the end of the series."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,davis98,5,Wed Jul 1 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"This is the way I see it: Weeds suffered from awful character development. By the end of the series, I absolutely hated every character that I once loved. Assuming Jenji Kohan has internet access, she's well aware of where weeds went wrong. It was a smart choice to devote an entire season to character development."

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,ijwokwkwppwppwpwppp,2,Wed Jul 1 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"It wasn't as good as season 2. It seems like in season 3, they start a lot of different developments, but they're never spelled out in enough detail or brought to a satisfactory ending. They just kinda fade out.  All in all, gotta say that the dialogue is one of the weakest links in the series. Especially when Red talks, it just sounds extremely artificial. A bunch of dense one-liners that such a woman would never ever say."
orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,Nintendeaux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:30:05 2015 UTC,I thought it was definitely lacking. Lots of filler and backstory that I felt didn't really go anywhere and more scenes of girls getting fucked from behind than I really cared to see.

orangeisthenewblack,3bpxvt,THE__SHITABYSS,2,Wed Jul 1 13:28:07 2015 UTC,"When Netflix took over Trailer Park Boys, they issued the release of two seasons in less than 8 months apart. The Boys are on schedule to pull off this same faster turnaround again this year.  I only bring this up because we now know OITNB has changed their shooting dates. Season 1 was shot in late winter/early spring with a July release. Assuming a 3-4 month editing process, we could see Netflix drop season 4 on us much, much earlier than next June. A have a strong hunch we'll see this happen to OITNB like TPB did."

orangeisthenewblack,3bsucb,WellThatIsJustRude,15,Wed Jul 1 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking as I was watching it that Pennsatucky's rape probably could/would not have happened in the way that it did IRL. I found it difficult to believe that Gloria was apparently consistently able to sneak cigarettes on that same dock, let alone a CO full-on raping an inmate half in and half out of a van in broad daylight. There would be cameras on that loading dock for sure, especially because a contraband ring was busted coming into that very same dock two seasons ago."
orangeisthenewblack,3bsucb,DeepStuffRicky,8,Thu Jul 2 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Right! How about somehow drugging and draggin an unconscious officer to the laundry room to fuck him with a mop handle.

orangeisthenewblack,3bsucb,elesdee,2,Thu Jul 2 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at this point it's neck and neck with my other favorite show, Trailer Park Boys, for its highly suspect but very entertaining depiction of prison life. (A running joke on TPB is how the party not only doesn't stop but actually intensifies in jail.) In fact, in its most recent season TPB actually ripped off almost the entire plot arc with the stolen screwdriver from season 1 of oitnb - although mercifully nobody ends up masturbating with it."

orangeisthenewblack,3bsucb,ericarlen,4,Thu Jul 2 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"I seem to recall a first season episode where Caputo explained to the young blonde guard who eventually got fired that they didn't have anybody watching the cameras, but that if anybody asked she should say that there were cameras everywhere.  Also, the author says that, ""It appears that virtually every male staff member in this place is treating it like his own personal dating site."" I can only think of four people who have done this: Pornstache (who was a rapist), Bennett (who had what he thought was an honest affair with Daya), Heally (who developed feelings for Red but ultimately didn't act on them), and Donuts (again, rapist).  But other than those two things, I agree with his points.   The conversation between Ford and Luschek about the drugs was hard to believe not only because Ford is the probably the kind of guy who would turn in a fellow guard over something like that but also because I find it hard to believe that someone's heroin-doing cousin would just casually tell you how he happened to buy it from someone who's related to one of your co-workers.   I also had trouble with the scene where all the inmates are able to run through a removed portion of the fence because there weren't any guards around. Apparently, the eight people in the break room at the time were all Litchfield had to defend against the prisoners rushing out. And you mean to tell me that none of those prisoners would at least attempt to swim across the lake? I get the point that Jenji Kohan may have been trying to make with that scene, but I just found the whole thing to be unbelievable.   All that being said, I liked this season. And I can't wait for the next one."

orangeisthenewblack,3btm6w,Chuchoter,2,Thu Jul 2 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"In the show, they are actually parent-child. This season dedicated pretty much a whole episode to Daya's childhood."
orangeisthenewblack,3bvvgz,MyMovieSucks,11,Thu Jul 2 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"It wasn't about the remaining characters; they've already shown flashbacks of the characters that had flashbacks in previous episodes. It's because it was about their own relationship with faith. The first episode had multiple characters' flashbacks, to show their relationship with their mothers. The last episode showed their relationship with faith, or their lack thereof. So no, it wasn't to go into everyone's backstory, and showing Boo getting electrocuted wasn't pointless. It's because it was an experience that convinced her that there is no god."

orangeisthenewblack,3bvvgz,HippieSoulPunx,9,Sat Jul 4 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't you hear Watson? She said they're going to the lake, and she said ""It's not escapable or nothing."" They weren't trying to break out of prison and all try to get free. They knew you couldn't escape that way, so they weren't escaping, they were just enjoying the freedom, the fresh air, the water, the sunshine, etc."
orangeisthenewblack,3bvvgz,Chuchoter,2,Sat Jul 4 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think there's only a few options. One is because they were near a lake, and that's the only thing near them. Yeah there is that road the van drives in, but it's 3h by van to get into city, as we've heard from other inmates' visitors. It's a tough road to walk.   The other is because some of them don't know what to do when they're free. Angie had a chance to escape but she stayed at the bus stop despite having a bus voucher. She could've still went to anywhere and took the transit to elsewhere. Another inmate, Tasty? Wasn't she free for a bit but was completely disappointed after? She realized she had no value outside of prison, but in here, people actually cared.   And finally, Stockholm Syndrome. In the sense that they actually figure out it isn't that bad here. And they see it as their actual home now.   Or they're just so excited that they didn't give a bleep and just wanted to have a good time with their friends like normal people."

orangeisthenewblack,3bvvgz,stonedparadox,-2,Fri Jul 3 10:13:15 2015 UTC,Vos certainly didn't get a happy ending. But I wish (assuming she's not dead) we learned more about what happened to her. Is she injured? Captured? I doubt a happy go-lucky-show where Red managed to survive after getting #REKT by that fucking brick is gonna let Vos die like that in a single scene.

orangeisthenewblack,3bswx9,PurpleViolettron,3,Sun Jul 5 19:42:27 2015 UTC,She was acting so Boo couldn't get a slice of the profit. If you look back at the scene in episode 2 the camera zooms in on Nicky's face at the end like she knew she was guilty/did something with the drugs. It also makes sense because her flashback shows that she was selfish and lies to the people around her. I don't think anyone would pick that up upon first watching though.
orangeisthenewblack,3bswx9,hamilted,9,Wed Jul 1 22:29:23 2015 UTC,It wasn't really because of the profit. It was because she's a heroin addict and she was tempted to use it. She only decided to cut Boo out after she realized that she needed Luschek to get the drugs out for her own good.
