blackops3,3e2zlo,Kaeys,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:47:44 2015 UTC,Play Halo 3 on Xbox 360 and then Call of Duty (any of them) and you'll notice a massive difference.

blackops3,3e2zlo,RdJokr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"Just saying, if you play on consoles, it may be very hard for you to see the difference between 30 FPS and 60 FPS. This is one of those moments when I get my ""PC master race attitude"" on and say, this is where PC gaming shines.   With the appropriate hardware, and the right amount of optimization from developers, you can play almost any game at 60 FPS and higher, at ridiculously high resolutions. Once you get used to it, going back to 30 FPS will be a real pain in the ass. I used to play at 60 FPS, then I changed my monitor's refresh rate to 75 (so my max FPS would be 75). Never looked back at 60 again, 60 suddenly feels sluggish to me."

blackops3,3e4826,Agent_Badkiller,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. Putting ironsights on the Lynx took it from a being bad sniper to being an excellent marksman rifle. As well, it has some odd looking (and cool IMO) ironsights which I enjoy. Same goes for the NA-45 with ironsights."

blackops3,3e320w,FlowingSilver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:13 2015 UTC,It worse when you're playing shotgun or pistols (which are now good in aw) and the high base delay means they can panic knife you almost before you see them T.T

I'm extremely happy that cod is moving in this direction with regards to the PK. I can probably speak for everyone, it is so annoying turning the corner to get a 3 piece, and one of the guys has to be the fucking hero, because he got scared to PK me.

blackops3,3e320w,FlowingSilver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:37 2015 UTC,I feel that if you feel so strongly about getting the kill when they get close you should use something like a shotgun that behaves pretty similar to the current knife except still is within the premise of the shooter game. My main issue with the panic knife is that it has such a wide hitbox and range compared to what it should be
blackops3,3e320w,poklane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:51 2015 UTC,I already love it. I currently can't play an hour of Call of Duty without getting pissed about panic knifing.
blackops3,3e320w,PapaJulietZulu,0,Tue Jul 21 17:11:59 2015 UTC,I know I'll get downvoted but there's nothing wrong with a panic knife.  You came upon someone and had faster reflexes than they did.  They could've knifed. They didn't.  You did it quicker.  You win. On to the next kill.
blackops3,3e320w,Lexa_pro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"But what you described isn't panic knifing. PK is when you're surprised and clench down on the stick which causes the knife animation. It's not skill or intended reflex, it's being rewarded for panicking. Notice that is not an issue in halo even though melee in that game is so strong, because the button for melee isn't mapped to the stick. You don't melee unintentionally in halo and get kills you don't deserve."

blackops3,3e22b1,mucimau,3,Tue Jul 21 11:03:33 2015 UTC,yes. but what about the specialists weapons and abilitys? you think they should be locked too?
blackops3,3e22b1,mucimau,4,Tue Jul 21 11:05:14 2015 UTC,"If it's earned by any means during combat I think it should be excluded. The gun customization is alone is enough, I think. Farfetched is the idea to have guns bare as well. Keeping just a customized loud out like gun smithing should keep interest of CoD fans in mind while keeping it as gun based as possible.  Just shooting ideas here."

If you're looking at it from a developer's perspective though, when there seemed to be such low demand is it worth working in and offering, if people may have a bad experience due to low player count?  It's like in some previous CoDs, there were some modes I loved – but not enough people played it, and I get why they didn't really continue in future iterations. Just the nature of creating a game and trying to foster the player base while also giving people options."
blackops3,3e22b1,MrSolid14,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"Its probably not going to be possible but I guess it could be worth a try. Take note that if you want a real (gun vs. gun) fight, they're going to have to remove a lot of stuff. Treyarch might not be willing to cut out a lot of creativity and hard work for one game mode. There's a possibility that they will do what SHG did in AW and get rid of exo movements in one game mode."

blackops3,3e0bxy,Blawdfire,3,Tue Jul 21 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"Don't be so quick to judge. I was simply looking for a copy myself, so I went to my local GameStop right after my shift ended. They had sold out, but the employee notified me that the store closest to my college hadn't made them available yet, and that if I came in at 10am the next morning (right when they open), he'd call the store up and get me a copy).   Not exactly trusting GameStop to keep that copy available in case I was late the next morning, I checked Amazon and, lo and behold, there were copies available. I grabbed one from Amazon to secure one for sure, went to GameStop the next day and they were able to get me one.  So I ended up with two copies. My first thought was to simply cancel my Amazon preorder, but after seeing the prices they were going for elsewhere, there's no way I was passing up a (minimum) $400 payout - that's textbooks for a semester or food for a month and a half! I pre-ordered with no ill intent, but there was no way I was passing up that much money in the name of ""fairness"" (so some random kid can convince his mom that he needs that copy), and there's no way you can convince me that you would do otherwise if you were in the same situation."

I would however preorder it to give to a friend for the same price I got it for. There are genuinely good people in this world and then there are the shitty selfish ones that although have good intentions break moral code to make a quick buck.

If you read my comment, I wasn't scalping anything; I just happened to come across an extra copy so I decided to keep it and make some easy money. If someone values it at $600, and buys it for that much, it's exactly the same as someone buying it for $200 from a retailer. In the end, someone gets exactly what they want and everyone's happy.  You're acting like selling something that you have extra of, without malicious intent mind you, is selfish and a violation of some unwritten moral code. It's not like I'm buying out rows of concert seats and reselling them for a massive profit, I just have an extra copy of a collectors edition game and would be stupid to throw away $400 just to make some random kid on Amazon happy."

blackops3,3e0bxy,Captain__Marvel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:12 2015 UTC,"The DLC code will have to be entered on the original game's country PS Store, but you can play it on any acc.    E.g., buy American copy with American season pass. Make a US acc and redeem there. You can then go back and play it on your orig acc."

blackops3,3e0bxy,Captain__Marvel,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"If I do sell mine it won't be listed until a few days before the release. The only thing it won't come with is the physical game, season pass, and or any redeemable codes. But good thing I don't really plan to sell. Haven't seen a cooler special edition of a game than this in a long time. Something that could actually get used regularly.  If you buy on eBay often, you have nothing to worry about. If you are new to eBay particularly for this item, do your research and only buy from people with good feedback. Communication is key.  These will probably sell for around $250-$300 after release for just the fridge and coasters."
blackops3,3e0bxy,Captain__Marvel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"In regards to outlets, you can buy adaptors for power plugs for as little as $10 so it honestly isn't an issue.  Scalpers on Ebay however are just dicks."
blackops3,3e0bxy,Captain__Marvel,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"Again, those adaptors will destroy your minifridge.  I know it because I had to go to the Middle East and bring adaptors and it would screw my laptop charger."

blackops3,3e0bxy,Blawdfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:35 2015 UTC,Millions of people use adaptors every year without issue. If people want the fridge for use desperately they can pick up a cheap adaptor or a high end adaptor and ensure it'll work.
blackops3,3e0bxy,NaughtyDragonite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:50 2015 UTC,I definitely suggest doing some research and reading reviews on finding a reliable adapter. This is more than just travel usage. This will be plugged in full time in your room.

blackops3,3e0bxy,NaughtyDragonite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:31 2015 UTC,It's also a lot easier/cheaper to mass-manufacture the contents of that care package than a custom mini-fridge.

A campaign trailer looks like all that's left other than e Sports. Do you think that ""The Giant"" zombie map will be a preorder bonus or will it be something like a ""Nuketown 2065?"
blackops3,3e214l,MrSolid14,3,Tue Jul 21 10:32:13 2015 UTC,"The Giant will most likely be a Season Pass bonus, like Nuketown Zombies for BO2. So no, it won't be free."

blackops3,3e214l,camanimal,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think the game's gonna ship with more than 1 map, especially since Shadows of Evil seems packed with a lot of stuff already (and the scope of the map seems to be much larger than TranZit). Add The Giant on top of that, and you'll be good to go till the first DLC pack hits."
blackops3,3e214l,mucimau,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point. They could announce other game modes though, like Grief, or just show more of SOE."

An idea; though Electric Cherry's label is mainly light blue, its actual beverage color is red, which I think is a key feature to the design of the perk. That's even more so since all other Perk-a-Colas beverage colors go along with their own respective label colors.  I know these are simplistic, but I think it would be even cooler if you found a way to incorporate that cherry-red color into Electric Cherry's design.  But still, very awesome!"

There's strategy in not defusing.  I don't think it'll work with any game mode where killstreak are enabled, however some sort of bonus xp and/or exp per enemy alive could work although in black ops 2 you already get +300 score for an exploded bomb which is heaps.  Also people would bitch about k/d"
blackops3,3e2s6w,xUBERJEWx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"Why would you stop defusing? Defusing the bomb doesn't end your kill streak. You still carry that into the next round. I'm confused what you mean by ""strategy in not defusing."" There are no scenarios where not defusing the bomb (assuming you know you can finish without interruption) is advantageous. Unless you are just wanting to extend the game.  Wait, after rereading your comment, I believe you mean that the defuser isn't sure they can complete the defuse without getting killed? I didn't gather that at first. I understand what you mean now, if that is the case."
blackops3,3e2s6w,TMilitar,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"The idea is making the game so intense that if you dont defuse, you will lose your killstreak progress. Players will have to be more careful and instead of just collecting kills, one must work up a strategy to defend the bomb and not get killed in the same time.  Im agaisnt the k/d being showed to the public and lots of people here suggested making in it only visible to the player alone, it's just another reason for campers to camp and players leaving lobbies because the other team has players with much higher k/d rate."

blackops3,3e0jvx,Xeilith,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:52 2015 UTC,How was Comic Con?
blackops3,3e0jvx,Xeilith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"Very cool, even though I couldn't actually go into the convention since I didn't have a badge. They always have cool stuff outside of it though, so that's what I did. Cool cosplayers, awesome exhibits, free swag, and LONG lines. It's the same exact Comic Con experience but free."
blackops3,3e0jvx,SteeezyE,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:59 2015 UTC,And if you're lucky you can strike up some really enjoyable conversations with the convention goers.
blackops3,3e3iid,Allegiance10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:32 2015 UTC,Haven't seen anything about this so far to upgrade I would assume you can cancel order and switch to digital deluxe.
blackops3,3e3iid,jjizzel5555,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:06 2015 UTC,I don't want to have to go through support just to cancel.
blackops3,3e3iid,jjizzel5555,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:30 2015 UTC,Oh thats understandable Ill look into and see what I can find.
blackops3,3e3iid,jjizzel5555,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:51 2015 UTC,So went ahead and chatted with support for you and found out the only way to do it for right now is to refund the orignal and have you just purchase the dogital deluxe edition. Sorry it took me so long been at work.
blackops3,3e11ve,IBMflamingo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"I have a tip for you, don't wait for them to restock. Your going to skip out on the beta and its very important that you don't. Try pre-ordering the game then play the BETA. If they ever restock on the BETA, then simply cancel your copy that you already ordered and get your juggernog. :) I hope that makes you feel better."
blackops3,3e11ve,MrSolid14,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:47 2015 UTC,What?
blackops3,3e11ve,Mikeytruant850,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"I was saying to just pre-order the game and then in case of them restocking on the juggernog edition, cancel your regular copy and order the juggernog. That way he can still take place in the BETA and get his juggernog."
blackops3,3e11ve,MrSolid14,2,Tue Jul 21 04:30:31 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I just didn't see OP express any desire to play the BETA, so I didn't see what you were getting at."
blackops3,3e11ve,Mikeytruant850,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see. I just want as much people participating in the BETA as possible. If we give more and more feedback, the better the final product will be for all of us."
blackops3,3e11ve,MrSolid14,2,Tue Jul 21 06:04:34 2015 UTC,Why are we yelling BETA
blackops3,3e11ve,FlameScout,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"This doesn't say they won't be restocking it, this just says it is currently sold out."
blackops3,3e11ve,Catderp,-3,Tue Jul 21 03:25:41 2015 UTC,Sold out usually means there won't be a re-stock.
blackops3,3e11ve,Captain__Marvel,4,Tue Jul 21 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"Sold out means it is unavailable, Activision did not state however if they are going to make it available."
blackops3,3e11ve,Catderp,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's meant to be a Limited thing and they can't keep re-stocking just because people missed out. Sold out usually means too bad, it's gone."
blackops3,3e11ve,Captain__Marvel,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:28 2015 UTC,I guess we can just wait and see.
blackops3,3e1w6t,xcisics,5,Tue Jul 21 09:09:01 2015 UTC,Wasn't it confirmed that the Xbox and PC beta would start on August 24? That would mean PS4 has the beta for 5 days longer.
blackops3,3e1w6t,flipperkip97,0,Tue Jul 21 09:31:36 2015 UTC,"Nothing's confirmed officially at the moment. Treyarch and Activision have only revealed the beta's start date on PS4. I suppose we'll know about PC and X1 at Gamescom, since it would be pretty close to beta then."
blackops3,3e1w6t,RdJokr,3,Tue Jul 21 09:48:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, Flipper is correct. It does start on the 24th. There has been quite an amount of speculation on the end date(s), though I'm almost certain they'll end at the same time."
blackops3,3e1w6t,FR_Leviathan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:41 2015 UTC,yes i think so. but treyarch did only confirm the start of the beta for ps4...
blackops3,3e1w6t,mucimau,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:01 2015 UTC,"likely yes, by 5 days.  im guessing all the beta's will end the same time, but the PS4 one starts a few days earlier"
blackops3,3e1w6t,ozarkslam21,0,Tue Jul 21 13:47:49 2015 UTC,I think so Because Destiny had the same thing
blackops3,3e1w6t,Khalid_7a,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yes the beta on xbox is shorter because ps4 gets it 5 days exclusively and earlier. Meaning X1 beta will likely start on the 24th of august and they will end at the same guaranteed, no doubt about that."
blackops3,3e0shp,HeSheWumbology,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard a few rumors/ideas of a Specialist having something similar to the Ballistic Knife, but I'm not sure. I'm also wondering the same thing for the Crossbow, especially since they have Outrider's Sparrow (Bow and arrow), which is mostly the same thing."
blackops3,3e0shp,Xeppeling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:55 2015 UTC,The crossbow and Ballistic knife could just be exclusive to zombies with their BO1 skins. Which would still suck :(
blackops3,3e0shp,AmerAlwafi,2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:37 2015 UTC,"It's really essential imo, it was awesome, everyone had a class with a ballistic knife in it."
blackops3,3e0shp,AmerAlwafi,2,Tue Jul 21 05:13:38 2015 UTC,You can't have a Black ops game without Ballistic knife. You just can't
blackops3,3e0shp,mucimau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:51 2015 UTC,Amen to that
blackops3,3e0shp,mucimau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:48 2015 UTC,i don't know. i don't think the crosbow will return as we now have a specialist with a bow. maybe there will be a specialist with balistic knife? something would be missing if these weren't in the game...
blackops3,3e0shp,BigCockMcLong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:16 2015 UTC,I will definitely use that specialist then :D
blackops3,3e1d2z,moorekeny1001,3,Tue Jul 21 05:11:02 2015 UTC,Your good until March at least.
blackops3,3e1d2z,goldenorangex,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:12 2015 UTC,i think most dlc/code related things expire march 31st could be wrong i have seen it on a few psn cards.
blackops3,3e1d2z,DJvic7,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"I don't own a PS4, but is there a way you can create an online account and redeem the Code? So when you do get your PS4 it will be ready in que and you don't have to worry about it expiring? I know for sure you can on Xbox, but I'm not positive for PSN."
blackops3,3e1d2z,Wigliano,3,Tue Jul 21 05:46:25 2015 UTC,There is a version of the Playstation store you can access through a Web browser
blackops3,3e1d2z,Ttothetrain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:59:42 2015 UTC,"Redeem the code online, on the playstation store. ;)"
blackops3,3e1d2z,BleedingBlack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:41 2015 UTC,Your all good until around March. Keep in mind that codes expire and make sure you keep your code in a safe place. :)
blackops3,3dxhlx,madshayne,24,Mon Jul 20 10:08:09 2015 UTC,It would be really really cool.  Maybe make sure you have to wait 10-20 seconds after using a command to use another.
blackops3,3dxhlx,flipperkip97,35,Mon Jul 20 10:29:37 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, get a mic."
blackops3,3dxhlx,GratefulUser,15,Mon Jul 20 10:32:26 2015 UTC,"Using a mic is not always an option. Language issues, background noise, playing late at night all valid reason why one might not be using their mic."
blackops3,3dxhlx,joshafool,-11,Mon Jul 20 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, and your team will always be at a disadvantage while you don't have a mic."
blackops3,3dxhlx,GratefulUser,13,Mon Jul 20 19:09:44 2015 UTC,The truth is that my team is at a disadvantage when I am not playing.
blackops3,3dxhlx,joshafool,4,Mon Jul 20 20:03:18 2015 UTC,Which is why I thought of this to reduce the disadvantage
blackops3,3dxhlx,imstraightlovableson,40,Mon Jul 20 20:36:54 2015 UTC,Have you ever considered the fact that not everyone can / wants to talk while gaming?
blackops3,3dxhlx,S_cute,9,Mon Jul 20 13:17:35 2015 UTC,Have you considered that people don't want to play zombies with someone without a mic?
blackops3,3dxhlx,S_cute,23,Mon Jul 20 13:42:25 2015 UTC,And this would help reduce that gap for people who don't have mics or aren't in quiet places
blackops3,3dxhlx,screwtehbilly,2,Mon Jul 20 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"It would help, I'm not oppose to the idea. Though for me, I'm not trying to get to round 15. If I want to do an EE or go to higher waves, it's easier to communicate with someone who has a mic. It's more difficult to play when you don't know what the other person is doing, if they're hitting the box or getting perks, if they're using the restroom.   I mean, the game comes with a mic. If that breaks, it's maybe $10-20 for a new one. If they can't afford that, they're probably -15 y/o and I wouldn't necessarily want to play with them anyways."
blackops3,3dxhlx,badboy850,7,Mon Jul 20 13:52:08 2015 UTC,Price isn't the problem for me. I just can't talk. I live in an apartment and people around me get really pissy when i make noise at night.
blackops3,3dxhlx,Ooobles,9,Mon Jul 20 13:56:14 2015 UTC,"Same here, I share an apartment with 4 people and the computer is in the same room so I can't talk much"
blackops3,3dxhlx,badboy850,-11,Mon Jul 20 14:03:07 2015 UTC,You can talk quietly.
blackops3,3dxhlx,Qureshi2002,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you've ever tried that, but it just doesn't work."
blackops3,3dxhlx,NaughtyDragonite,-13,Mon Jul 20 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"I have tried that, and it does. So buck up."
blackops3,3dxhlx,S_cute,7,Mon Jul 20 18:44:15 2015 UTC,buck up?  when did reddit get infested with 12 year olds...
blackops3,3dxhlx,NaughtyDragonite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:20 2015 UTC,If you want to do an EE why would you be looking in public matches in the first place?
blackops3,3dxhlx,Shadowgale,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:19:08 2015 UTC,You're right. Private matches are strictly for playing in silence to round 20. Silly me :)
blackops3,3dxhlx,imstraightlovableson,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:43 2015 UTC,How does that relate to what I said at all?
blackops3,3dxhlx,imstraightlovableson,0,Mon Jul 20 22:34:40 2015 UTC,Then maybe they should get the fuck over it and play the game?

blackops3,3dxhlx,dermy96,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:28 2015 UTC,I always thought call of duty should have incorporated this ever since I started playing battlefield. I'm mostly a hardcore player on cod with the occasional regular game mode. I typically give people the benefit of the doubt when they apologize for team killing me so I would love to have an option to say sorry.
blackops3,3dxhlx,HeSheWumbology,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:00 2015 UTC,It would be good if you only play with randoms but if you're on ps4 and are playing with friends you would party chat.
blackops3,3dxhlx,PM_ME_KATE_MARA,2,Mon Jul 20 10:54:12 2015 UTC,It's good if you're playing at a time where you can't really make too much noise (headset).

If the player doesn't wanna use the mic, I doubt they will be keen on communicating otherwise.  Don't forget, CoD has built in AI callouts. Ghosts was a fantastic representation of this. Even without talkative teammates, their AI would call out soldier locations. It was a really good feature."

blackops3,3dy2sg,Fat_Cat1991,5,Mon Jul 20 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Text chat box will be back for multiplayer, so it's probably gonna be in Zombies as well. Gonna check with PCDev about this."
blackops3,3dy2sg,RdJokr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"so in waw and black ops there was a pre game chat box, for those that didnt have a mic, they could communicate with each other. now in bo2 its just mic only which is very difficult to communicate with.   what do you think? Do you want this feature back?"
blackops3,3dy2sg,mucimau,2,Mon Jul 20 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"I only play BO1 on PC, and only with my friends over teamspeak... but if you don't have that option the text chat sure is a nice feature."
blackops3,3dy2sg,mucimau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely. teamspeak is a great feature, and i use it a ton, heck i even rented my own server just for zombies! But how many casuals use teamspeak? Barely any, so for most people its hard to communicate especially if they are shy on the mic."
blackops3,3dy2sg,mucimau,2,Mon Jul 20 14:20:36 2015 UTC,yes that'a true. do you play much with random people? i don't like it that much. everybody wants as much money as possible. and these people don't buy the doors so we are at round 7 still at the beginning untill I buy all the stuff... :/
blackops3,3dy2sg,mucimau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"yes, i had to play with randoms but now through that terrible ordeal, i did find some really nice friends who were great at zombies! we all gotta start somewhere, maybe you had some nice IRL friends to play with."
blackops3,3dy2sg,mucimau,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:55 2015 UTC,ok. that's nice :) well i have 2 friends and we decided together to buy BO1 for the zombies. but that's great if you have a team to play with...
blackops3,3e365p,UniversalCatastrophe,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:45 2015 UTC,I would like a map that takes place entirely inside of a cubicle.
blackops3,3e365p,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:37 2015 UTC,Great idea!!! Could you expand on that though. Like would it be inside a work cubicle? I don't go for mainstream workplaces so I have no idea how big they are but I can't imagine it being to large.
blackops3,3e365p,SirVyval,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:26 2015 UTC,On the outside of a massive space station. Would be fun if it had lower gravity.
blackops3,3e365p,Fat_Cat1991,0,Tue Jul 21 21:14:17 2015 UTC,Like the one in BO2?

blackops3,3e1bti,mucimau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:16:52 2015 UTC,that should not be a problem. you linked your cod account to your psn right?
blackops3,3e1bti,mucimau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:05:24 2015 UTC,yeah
blackops3,3dxq2p,shayshay2k,12,Mon Jul 20 12:01:09 2015 UTC,I like it being the same. Means you always recognize the bomb site. It has an assuring familiarity to it.
blackops3,3dxq2p,KindOfOk,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"If there is an on-screen indicator that says ""Target A"", ""Target B"", ""Defend A"", or ""Defend B"", then is it really necessary what they look like?"
blackops3,3dxq2p,CaliforniaStryder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"You'd also run into the issue of different sized objectives – which, on a map-to-map basis, wouldn't be fair. You couldn't have a giant helicopter players can hide behind be an objective on one map, while another map has a small classic stockpile. That changes S&D.  But you could get creative and have similar-sized items – the burnt-out cockpit of a helicopter, for instance, that's the same dimensions in-game as the weapons stockpiles.  Or, just have the same ""box"" we have now, but put different types of weaponry in them so they just look different."
blackops3,3dxq2p,KindOfOk,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's never mattered much to me what it looks like. I love the familiarity of the green box. I play more SnD than any other obj. mode, and the bomb sites have never once bothered me. Not that I think changing them is a bad idea. I just think it's unnecessary.   The problem with having more dynamic bomb sites is that you have to incorporate that thinking into the map design. The advantage of the box is that it can be placed anywhere."
blackops3,3dxq2p,KindOfOk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed – never bothered me at all, it's just a flourish that could be fun (from a design perspective) to toy with. It's one of the few things that basically hasn't changed since CoD4: MW."
blackops3,3dxq2p,mucimau,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:33 2015 UTC,Yea when they changed the bomb to that giant hockey puck in AW I was thrown for a loop hahaha
blackops3,3dxq2p,S_cute,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:49 2015 UTC,your team has been on the map x on an operation. then your helicopter crashed and you lost a supply box with weapons. a group of enemies forced you to escape. now you are coming back with your team to destroy the wehicle and the weapons so the enemies can't get any parts or tecnology...
blackops3,3dxq2p,mucimau,3,Mon Jul 20 12:36:38 2015 UTC,Wehicle...lol
blackops3,3dxq2p,southerneuropean,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:29 2015 UTC,what's wrong with that?
blackops3,3dxq2p,Guerrilla_Time,4,Mon Jul 20 13:57:22 2015 UTC,Wumbo
blackops3,3dxq2p,xxTHG_Corruptxx,2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"I never liked the way they do the bomb site, which is actually the bomb location cause you can't really put the bomb anywhere else. We got this big bomb that goes off that kills you if you are semi-close, but it HAS TO BE PUT 3 INCHES AWAY FROM THE OBJECT.   It would be nice to have the bomb site and then have a 5' radius around it that you can place the bomb. This slight adjustment of letting the players place the bomb where they want (in the bomb site) could add to the game. One placement could be a good line of sight for one area of the map, but a placement 4 feet away could open up or close off more lines of sight."
blackops3,3dxq2p,CannabinoidKid,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:59 2015 UTC,I would like bomb sites like CS but I doubt that'd happen

blackops3,3e0fix,toonicetosayno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:07 2015 UTC,What type of local game store? And can anyone confirm a Costco?

Once the beta comes, I'm guessing they will give you a code to redeem on the PS/Xbox/Steam Store (depending on what platform you chose obviously). If you preordered digitally then it will start downloading automatically."
blackops3,3e05nc,ThaTiemsz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:56 2015 UTC,Ok so I just redeem on the callofduty website then

blackops3,3e05nc,ChallengeFreakinOwne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:35 2015 UTC,Tiemsz is correct. Only other thing to mention is that you'll receive a code for redemption on your console a few days prior to release via the email you've got linked to your CallofDuty.com account.

blackops3,3dya4j,RdJokr,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"Console peasant here. Just curious why CoD didnt provide severs to rent since BO1? You have to pay for them, right? Whats the loss on Activisions/Treyarchs side?"
blackops3,3dya4j,FuXs-,4,Mon Jul 20 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"Rentable servers come in two form: ranked and unranked. Ranked servers mean you play on it, you level up and unlock things. Pretty much the same type as the servers that COD use nowadays for matchmaking, except that it's not matchmaking, and you can manually pick servers. Ranked servers are monitored by both Treyarch and the server admins who rent them.  Unranked servers, on the other hand, have no progression system at all. Everything is unlocked from the start, and maybe customizable to your preferences (like, say, adding additional Pick 10 slots in your classes). In the form of matchmaking, we know it as ""Custom Games"", or ""Private Match"". However, these do not use any form of servers, and are purely P2P, which is inferior to dedicated servers of course. Unlike ranked servers, admins have almost full control of the unranked servers, meaning they can choose to lock/unlock any specific items, and tweak the gameplay.  While rentable servers may sound like the best thing in the world according to the PC master race, it does have its own weaknesses. The most common one you'll hear about are abusive admins, who set up odd rules in their servers (like crouch only, no akimbo, snipers only, Nuketown 24/7, etc...), and may occasionally kick a player for doing better than them. This is something that Treyarch (or any developer out there) often has no control over, which is why they have resorted to matchmaking to take full control of the servers themselves."
blackops3,3dya4j,XboxWigger,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:51 2015 UTC,I agreed with you until recently.  The best system is what EA and Valve do with their games with their server browser.  They host vanilla servers that are official so you don't have to worry about bullshit like crouch only and what not.  They also allow ranked community run servers to be rented.  I have been having a blast in BF Hardline with this system recently.  When I want the rules with no stupid admin nonsense I play on the official servers and I find plenty of games doing this.  The truth is Activision is just cheap and they need to get with the competition and stop this dedicated server/listen server hybrid crap.
blackops3,3dya4j,fatcIemenza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"Until Activision makes its own game client like Origin and Steam (which are owned by EA and Valve, respectively, as you may have been aware of already), I don't see them trying to invest that much into PC gaming.  COD has been relying on Steam for online play since MW2, so there's not much Activision would be willing to do unless the game has direct integration with Steam to use Valve's servers (that would require paying Valve a lot of cash, which I don't think they'd be too happy with). COD4 and WaW have their own rentable servers going, so they can pretty much stand on their own without Steam.  Tl;dr: COD needs to have its own game client on PC to have all the PCMR stuff, which will probably never happen."
blackops3,3dya4j,RealityMachina,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"COD needs to have its own game client on PC to have all the PCMR stuff, which will probably never happen.   You mean something like Origin? Lol yeah good luck with that. Making CoD PC players jump through hoops to play neglected ports won't help our numbers in the long run. Remember the whole ""spyware"" episode with Origin? No thanks."
blackops3,3dya4j,XboxWigger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"Remember the whole ""spyware"" episode with Origin? No thanks.   Just going leave this here.  That said to respond to RdJokr, I don't think CoD would needs its own game client per se, its own backend would be neededas part of overall revamp from pure P2P matchmaking, but it wouldn't need to be a PC-only thing rather than an overall overhaul of how the series does multiplayer (since at this point it would take a miracle for PC sales to make up enough for the serious investment required)"
blackops3,3dya4j,fatcIemenza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:41 2015 UTC,This is false.  Black Ops 1 was after MW2 and had a server browser that included official and community run servers.  There are plenty of games who do this on Steam and also sell their games outside of steam like on Origin.  All of the Battlefield games run on EA server and rented servers even on the consoles.  They did this even before origin existed back in the BFBC2 days.  It isn't required to have your own client to set this up.  It just requires them not being so cheap about it.
blackops3,3dya4j,Brandalf_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:05 2015 UTC,All of the hours I've put into BF3 and CoD4 and I've never seen the quintessential crouch-only server that someone inevitably mentions every time a server browser is talked about.
blackops3,3dya4j,oliman22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:25 2015 UTC,W@W is riddled with crouch only servers.
blackops3,3dya4j,XboxWigger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:32 2015 UTC,And that is because people like them. Otherwise people would play on the other servers. There is also plenty of vanilla servers in WAW with regular players.
blackops3,3dya4j,oliman22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"There's also a matter of connections as well. There may be a bunch of vanilla servers, but depending on your region, you may not get the servers that suit you. Meanwhile, modded servers with ridiculous rules are the only ones that go well enough with your Internet to ensure minimal lag."
blackops3,3dya4j,watties12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:17 2015 UTC,In COD I have seen them not BF though.  They infested Black Ops 1 on PC.  At one point I couldn't find a game without them.
blackops3,3dya4j,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"What people don't realize is that those servers you don't like exist because there is a demand for them. People like crouch servers, and that is why they use them. Otherwise they would be empty. Same goes for the Nuketown ones. There will always be abusive admins, but it's not at all a big problem. Behave and on 99% of servers you won't get banned. That is mine experience after years of playing server browser COD games.  Also obviously the Black ops 1 PC community prefers these community run servers, because Treyarch itself has to this date and since launch, proviced about 20-30 something VANILLA servers without restrictions of any kind. And you know what? These are ALWAYS empty."
blackops3,3dya4j,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"People also don't like crouch servers, otherwise there wouldn't be posts complaining about it. This can go both ways, you know."
blackops3,3dya4j,Lemwise,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"While I'm not big on crouch only, Nuketown 24/7, etc type of servers, I can't really call it a flaw with the system because those servers are populated as a result of that being what a segment of the population wants. I don't like it, but who am I to say they can't do it?"
blackops3,3dya4j,oliman22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"It is a problem when there are too many of those types of servers, that the amount of vanilla servers just can't compete."
blackops3,3e0d0k,edmundz,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:38 2015 UTC,Most DLC  usually expire in March when you get it in November
blackops3,3e0d0k,LifeHated,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:56 2015 UTC,Dude just open it and get your DLC. People want the fridge for nostalgia and collectible purposes. They can't hate if you want your passes and DLC ha!
blackops3,3e0d0k,Mjmvp_23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:58 2015 UTC,They will have an expiration date. But usually if you ask customer support and say you bought it and the codes are expired they give you a new set.
blackops3,3e0d0k,frankq144,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:09 2015 UTC,Alright thank you mate
blackops3,3e0d0k,ozarkslam21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:33 2015 UTC,why would you not want to unbox it until the summer?
blackops3,3e0d0k,ozarkslam21,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:14 2015 UTC,I don't want to have the huge distraction in college plus I would have to put all my DLC on my roommate's xbox one until I can get one
blackops3,3e0d0k,dflannagan10,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"well shoot, you sound like a very smart, focused young person. what are you doing here in the CoD subreddits???   ;) ;)  i kid i kid"
blackops3,3duutz,Boonsquemador,38,Sun Jul 19 18:23:02 2015 UTC,Party Games are honestly some of the best ideas in the CoD series lately. I feel like the BO1 wager matches (especially Gun Game) and Infected should automatically be in the game like without question.
blackops3,3duutz,ethood1999,10,Sun Jul 19 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"agreed, but One In the chamber especially is so fun because you have to decide when to shoot and out smart opponents. it gets really tense when you and someone else have one bullet left and for me the best thing is that it is different every single game. you get a different experience every single time.  infected is my other favourite game type in public matches but you know how it works. everyone goes to the common area/spot people get picked off then when theres a few (5 or 6) left idiots get picked off then you eventually lose. I think in most infected games the infected people will always win. I also have a problem with the minimap directly pin pointing the last guy on the map, it makes it impossible for them to win. if they have a great hiding spot i dont think it should be revealed. maybe just a fuzz on the minimap like jammer in bo1 which vaguely tells you where that guy is. but thats for another thread i went off on a rant"
blackops3,3duutz,Dommy73,4,Sun Jul 19 19:49:29 2015 UTC,I remember these videos where guy was making others run off the cliffs in One in the chamber :D
blackops3,3duutz,lifeismeaningful,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:15 2015 UTC,Yes! Infected with a full lobby not 12.
blackops3,3duutz,marinafanatic,9,Mon Jul 20 00:00:52 2015 UTC,I support this
blackops3,3duutz,CyKoToaster,5,Sun Jul 19 18:38:07 2015 UTC,I miss wager matches. The risk of playing the 10000 cod point round is some of the most fun I've had gaming ever. So intense the whole time. I know cod points aren't coming back but damn I wish they were
blackops3,3duutz,CyKoToaster,0,Sun Jul 19 21:40:11 2015 UTC,cod coins are coming back
blackops3,3duutz,CyKoToaster,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:50 2015 UTC,Is this confirmed? I never heard anything about it. If so this might be better news than The Giant map. I LOVED cod points so so much.
blackops3,3duutz,T_Immobilisation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I think so. i cant give you a source but im certain that ive heard it and ive seen a ton of people on r/CodCompetitive (including myself) talk about buy in tournaments and shit that could be done with the coin system. Im sure its coming back, just to back what im saying up we wouldnt be talking about that stuff on that sub reddit if they werent coming back. maybe someone that comes to the thread can find it for you, i'll check if i find something i'll edit this  EDIT: heres something https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmReLgYHmvs  another vid, from Chaos silencer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzG2eNEhQFc  im sure ive seen more official confirmation of it since. Im fairly positive they are coming back"
blackops3,3duutz,Joshwoocool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:44:43 2015 UTC,Man I hope your right and the James c Burns thing kind of confirms it. CoD points were so innovative. And I was so upset when they weren't in Blops 2. Even more hyped for the beta now
blackops3,3duutz,jjizzel5555,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:51 2015 UTC,Source? And don't tell me your uncle works at Treyarch....
blackops3,3duutz,RileyCola,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:43 2015 UTC,confirmed my uncle works at ubisoft

My uncle doesnt work at treyarch but my friends sisters boyfriend does so its pretty much official......"

blackops3,3duutz,Gerrit-Jan,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:18 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, black ops 3 will certainly have party modes. All of them may not be available at launch (this probably won't happen), they'll just add it in at a later date."
blackops3,3duutz,mucimau,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"bring back Infected in MW3 style, and then without Tomahawk"
blackops3,3duutz,Gerrit-Jan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:43 2015 UTC,without? so you die all the time if you're infected... :(
blackops3,3duutz,mucimau,0,Mon Jul 20 09:00:07 2015 UTC,yeah but its extremely fun when you're not infected!
blackops3,3duutz,ACiDRiFT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:12:14 2015 UTC,yes that's right. the bad thing is only that you could go on a point of the map where the infected have no chance on getting you if you don't runout of ammo. but that could be different with the new movement.
blackops3,3duutz,MrSolid14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:14:15 2015 UTC,"that's why the time limit of 5 minutes, or 10 maybe is a good idea. otherwise the fun can be taken out quickly, but when there are 15 people wanting to kill you, that spot isn't going to help. Unless you where on a spot in Seatown where maybe 0,1% of the players could get or on Downturn where it takes long to get (the one on the black bars)."
blackops3,3duutz,je1992,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:19 2015 UTC,idk. we'll see... i still hope the infected get a tomahawk. people would maybe leave the game...

blackops3,3dxwak,Sn0H0ar,3,Mon Jul 20 13:01:06 2015 UTC,exchange rates are tough.  im a pricing analyst and just because of the strength of the US$ against the CA$ we mark up the price by 1.79x.  customers aren't crazy about it but they understand it.  only way to keep margins up
blackops3,3dxwak,ozarkslam21,0,Mon Jul 20 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, can definitely see it from a currency perspective. I'll be interested to see final sales numbers though, as (obviously) a person's pay didn't grow in lock-step with our currency's  devaluation against the USD. put another way, just because the loonie is worth less in America, doesn't mean my Canadian employer increased my wage."
blackops3,3dxwak,ozarkslam21,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"oh you are absolutely right.  It very well may have a negative impact on sales. I know Aussie's have had the same struggle in years past, probably partially because of exchange rate and partially due to shipping costs."

blackops3,3dxwak,DJvic7,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:59 2015 UTC,Standard edition costs $100 in Australia to pre-order but you can normally pick it up on the day for around $70-80. I don't know if it works the same in Canada but the pre-order price is normally just a place holder until the stores get an actual sell price.

blackops3,3dxwak,2o5,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:07 2015 UTC,Lol I wish it was as cheap as that in the uk. It costs the equivalent of 90 cad here. On a side note I earn the equivalent of 15 cad as a customer assistant in a grocery shop would that be seen as a decent amount for the job in canada?
blackops3,3dxwak,Bleak5170,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a friend of mine from England has basically told me that everything costs near the exact same in numeric terms, despite the fact that the pound is worth over $2 Canadian, super weird!  As for whether $15/hr would be a decent job; it's a matter of perspective, but I'll say that our rough provincial minimum wages are $10 or so per hour. However, people pushing for a higher minimum wage argue that $15/hr would be a ""liveable"" income. It depends on how you define it and where you live. My personal perspective is that $15 should be close to the minimum for most places to ensure a decent living. Your job here, would likely be minimum wage though, so to answer your question, I'd say that yes, what you make is better than Canadians doing a similar role."
blackops3,3dxwak,2o5,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:47 2015 UTC,is this because the canadian dollar keeps tanking ?
blackops3,3dxwak,Bleak5170,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and I will admit it's cut back on my gaming for sure. Yes I do remember paying more than $100 for SNES games, but $80 for a single video game in this day and age is way too much if you ask me. There was a time I was buying a game every 2nd week or so but not anymore. The one saving grace is that there's absolutely nothing enticing me to buy the Hardened edition this time around. Normally I always get the first or second tier version, but I will probably get the standard edition of a COD game for the first time ever."
blackops3,3dxwak,2o5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"But, there is an enormous amount of work that goes into modern video games compared to games that were released on the SNES. Games have been relatively the same price over the years and haven't adjusted for inflation or the magnitudes of additional work they now take.  I'd say modern games are a steal."
blackops3,3dxwak,mucimau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I considered that as well for sure. I mean I have gotten probably hundreds of dollars worth of fun from A.W. alone. But it's still really difficult to all of a sudden see your games jump $20 overnight.
blackops3,3dxwak,MDRox99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:55 2015 UTC,That's a fair point. A gradual increase would be better than going from $60 to however much they should be charging. The sudden jump in price would ostracize some and just generally isn't that great.
blackops3,3dyp7w,xInferno,9,Mon Jul 20 16:46:06 2015 UTC,Beta codes are free why wont people realize this. You don't need to be Santa clause with the beta codes haha

blackops3,3dwsll,CGA001,7,Mon Jul 20 04:36:35 2015 UTC,I think the no air burst nerf is fairly significant. Gunfights in CoD often only take fractions of a second so that extra time for the c4 to hit the ground probably means the player who threw it is dead. I do like both of your suggestions a lot. There wasn't a negative side to using c4 in BO2
blackops3,3dwsll,YourFavPsycho,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I still don't think the no airburst nerf is good enough to completely balance the equipment.  I don't know if you have played Battlefield 4 before, but in that game there is a grenade called the RGO Impact Grenade. As it's name implies, it is a grenade that detonates as soon as it hits something. This C4 nerf in Black Ops 3 has essentially turned the C4 into an RGO Impact grenade, because anyone who is using it aggressively (which was almost everyone in Black ops 2) is going to detonate it as soon as it hits a surface. In a way, this kind of weapon has already been tested in a similar game, and what Battlefield 4 shows is that instant explosives are way too powerful when they have the range and explosive power as an RPG.   Since Battlefield 4's release, the RGO Impact Grenade has been Nerfed four times. The first nerf was the damage, then they decreased the damage again, then they reduced the maximum amount you could carry from two to one, and then they decreased the blast radius. Battlefield 4 has shown that instantly detonating explosives destroy the flow of First person shooters, especially when playing on small maps like TDM maps, which are about the same size as the maps in Call of Duty."
blackops3,3dwsll,YourFavPsycho,4,Mon Jul 20 19:54:41 2015 UTC,You just had to remind me of the nightmare that was impact grenades...  On a serious note though: I agree. C4 used to be my main gripe about any of the features in CoD up until AW which obviously didn't have it. It was essentially at least one free kill per life unless you got shot in the back.
blackops3,3dwsll,TalentlessNoob,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"You aren't alone brother, RGO PTSD affects the minds of thousands of Battlefield 4 players.  It makes me very happy to see that other people like you agree with what I am saying. I really just don't want to see this game go down the path BF4 started on before they corrected their course."
blackops3,3dwsll,mrjix,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Shooting the c4 to disable it is good a good idea AND the reduced throw distance is semi-good .  The increase in damage and the indicator is a bad idea though , wish Treyarch hadn't implemented it or at least will change it"
blackops3,3dwsll,brensav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"I can understand the reasoning behind increasing the damage so I am not too concerned about that. After all, with an RE factor of 1.34, C4 is one powerful explosive."
blackops3,3dwsll,Fappy_McMasturbate,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:14 2015 UTC,as long as you can't throw c4 while using a riot shield.  that shit ruined ghosts
blackops3,3dwsll,brensav,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:23 2015 UTC,you should not focus on shooting the c4 but focus on killing the player before they can detonate the c4 lol
blackops3,3dwsll,Tenshi-01,5,Mon Jul 20 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"If you're going against a camper, especially now that there's a proximity notification, shooting C4 is going to be important"
blackops3,3dwsll,Dmont_C_Thomas,5,Mon Jul 20 05:37:36 2015 UTC,Fappy gets it :)
blackops3,3dwsll,brensav,5,Mon Jul 20 05:42:38 2015 UTC,"This could also be useful if you see an enemy throwing it in the air at you, if you are skilled enough (or just lucky), you could shoot it and disable it, saving your life.   In this situation it would be wiser to shoot the player you saw throw the c4 then the c4 itself."
blackops3,3dwsll,mucimau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"But even when you shoot drones and things like that on the floor, they normally explode. If you are going to shoot something like that, you usually back up a bit so that it doesn't blow in your face.   A lot of people though will probably throw the C4 in your face like usual. I mean does your body count as a surface or not?"
blackops3,3dwsll,ca6vtec,0,Mon Jul 20 12:51:59 2015 UTC,I mean does your body count as a surface or not?   I sure as fuck hope so.  Gore for the win!

blackops3,3dwsll,Guerrilla_Time,3,Mon Jul 20 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"I know, but what im saying is if they throw it through your stream of bullets while you are shooting at someone else, it should disable it. Or maybe the enemy placed it on an objective, like the Flag in CTF. You could shoot it and not worry about it exploding."
blackops3,3dwsll,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:20 2015 UTC,"Good idea, i understand it that way."
blackops3,3dwsll,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:19 2015 UTC,"i understand. that would actually make perfect sense. this is a bit of topic, but as i was in a gunfight with a titan in destiny. i managed to shoot his granade while it was still in the air. and you say that should work with the C4 as well..."

In the past I've gotten either the Hardened or the deluxe, but there's just nothing in those editions which interests me this time around. Part of this stems from the fact I just cleaned out my storage locker, and discovered a crapload of useless gaming-related items I've gotten with other deluxe versions of games. I will NEVER use any of this stuff and it served as a reminder to not fall for these deluxe editions anymore."

blackops3,3dy0ff,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,3,Mon Jul 20 14:14:45 2015 UTC,No. You can get a feel for the maps by watching any of the thousands of youtube vids that come out whenever new map packs land.
blackops3,3dy0ff,patchworkfuckface,3,Mon Jul 20 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, it could easily work out. I think the issue you're going to run into is, is this trial period going to influence people to buy it more or influence them to not spend the money? In other words, are people going to be more inclined to buy the DLC after playing 1-2 days or will they say ""I don't like these maps, I'm not going to get it anymore.""  I can't say I see this happening though. Money > Content. For me, I've never really be impressed with DLCs, I think the best maps are always introduced with the main game. I think the exception are zombie maps, I think a lot of people (Especially with a treyarch game) are going to be purchasing the DLCs exclusively for the zombie maps.   Nonetheless, interesting idea, but I don't see Activision throwing people a bone on this issue. Plenty of people will still purchase the DLC without playing any new content. There isn't a large enough population of fence sitters to bring light to a trial."
blackops3,3dy0ff,S_cute,2,Mon Jul 20 13:58:46 2015 UTC,I don't know. I really enjoyed the DLC maps on BO1 and MW3. My favorite maps were actually in DLC for MW3
blackops3,3dy0ff,YourFavPsycho,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Good idea for the customer. Bad idea for the business. They lose the people buying it off of ""hype."" You know, the customer that doesn't know that they'll only love 1 or 2 maps but buys the DLC maps regardless.  The only thing they possibly gain is the potential customers that weren't going to buy the map packs initially. However, we have had free DLC weekends before.. See this:    http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-ps3-owners-can-try-call-of-duty-ghosts-onslaught-dlc-for-free-this-weekend/1100-6419236/  But this was months later when the initial ""hype"" customer had already bought the map packs.   So a 1 or 2 day free trial, months later, then yeah they'll probably do it since they've done it before. If you mean try them out as soon as they come out, probably not a good idea for them."
blackops3,3dy0ff,MojoY0Y0,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:37 2015 UTC,nah that's not realistic i don't think.
blackops3,3dy0ff,ozarkslam21,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:52 2015 UTC,i feel like most people really only buy the dlc for zombies anyway. I think most of us know by now at least 2 of the maps will be garbage each time.

blackops3,3duef8,Kaeys,-14,Sun Jul 19 22:50:57 2015 UTC,Plenty of people playing with mouse and KB on consoles. Definitely not impossible
blackops3,3duef8,Still_made_sense,5,Sun Jul 19 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, you RARELY run into console players with KB and mouse. If they would have supported this cross-play, you'd run into these guys every match, and console players would be getting destroyed by them (as its much easier to aim with KB + mouse)."
blackops3,3duef8,Sora26,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"For terms of rarity, In the 3.5ish years of using my Xim3 on the 360 I only ran into one person I was sure had KB+M and maybe only a handful that could have been using it."
blackops3,3duef8,Eradicate_X,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:08:09 2015 UTC,That and even with the XIM you are held  to the same limitations of a controller as far as turn speed goes. PC players would be turning and aiming so much faster.
blackops3,3duef8,cha0ss0ldier,3,Sun Jul 19 23:22:42 2015 UTC,Lol what
blackops3,3duef8,onyxrecon008,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:38:05 2015 UTC,That is one million percent false man.
blackops3,3duef8,CraziBoi94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:46:28 2015 UTC,It's 100% not. The XIM cannot exceed the maximum turn speed set by the game devs in the game code.  If you turn your sensitivity up in the XIM settings and it gets to  point to where you are trying to turn faster than the game allows you actually hit a wall so to speak and slow down. There is no turning speed cap on PC games as far as I know. Down vote me because you don't know what you're talking about.
blackops3,3duef8,cha0ss0ldier,0,Mon Jul 20 17:55:17 2015 UTC,I HAVE ONE LOL.
blackops3,3duef8,CraziBoi94,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:03 2015 UTC,Then you should know what I'm talking about. If you have yours sens turned up to high in the XIM settings your XIM will flash when you turn and your aim will slow down. You cannot exceed the max turned speed that is hard coded into the game. Can you aim more accurately than a controller player on 20? Yeah probably. Can you aim and turn faster? No. On PC it's even faster because there is no turn speed cap though.

blackops3,3duef8,illegalnightmare,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's bad news. Bigger player pool would be way better. Not every kbm user is a magician that can destroy everything in their path, and controller users get the advantage of really good tracking with the aim assist.   I think if there was an option for it that you could tick or untick to allow it to put you in cross platform lobbies it would be awesome."

blackops3,3dtmqo,Camocheese,11,Tue Jul 21 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think IW may have become a little too comfortable. COD4 & MW2 (IW) were smash hits when they arrived, whereas World at War (3arc) didn't receive as much praise. I think we see that in MW3, quite similar to MW2, that's when people started saying ""whoa, this is just a remake."" I never played Ghost so I can't speak too much to it, but it sounds like they played it safe again and added a few changes. With BLOPS1 & 2 (3arc) Treyarch hit their stride, so it will be interesting to see how BLOPS3 does after witnessing the ""fall"" of IW so to say.   I think this IW will be telling, they've have received a lot of flack for their past 1-2 games and now have 3 years to work and improve. I think that 3rd game mode is tricky though and 3arc hit a gold mine with zombies. What we see with SHG zombies is that it is indeed zombies, but there are changes. IW and SHG don't want to make the same exact zombie game as 3arc, but for the zombie fans, that's exactly what they want. So for IW and SHG, they need to find a balance or tap into their own market and discover a new mode (which is what I think we saw in Ghost with the alien game).   I think we need to give SHG a fair chance though before we toss them out with the bath water. I think all three, especially IW and SHG, need to be on their toes even more than the past due to backwards compatibility or potential remasters of a series from an outside developer. These next couple years are will decide if CoD is slowly fading out or ran into a little hiccup."

blackops3,3dtmqo,Camocheese,2,Sun Jul 19 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Never said it wasn't, just mentioned that it was never talked about as much as COD4 and MW2."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Camocheese,12,Sun Jul 19 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"The only thing I disagree with is the campaign. The AW campaign had a very good storyline and, to a literature student like me, was absolutely brilliantly written"
blackops3,3dtmqo,procrastinating_fish,9,Sun Jul 19 11:40:32 2015 UTC,It wasn't exactly brilliant. Spoiler It's really impossible to sympathize with him since his declaration just comes out of nowhere without any proper build up.
blackops3,3dtmqo,Bazzmania,3,Sun Jul 19 12:28:33 2015 UTC,I also really like the arm thing which symbolised the father - son relationship with Irons
blackops3,3dtmqo,runealex007,5,Sun Jul 19 12:44:48 2015 UTC,I loved it all. He was the perfect villain for the perfect era.

blackops3,3dtmqo,dukezap1,5,Mon Jul 20 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"Declaring war on everyone isn't a sign of swaying towards evil? FYI It all started when his son died. He didn't see it as a sacrifice for his country, which was what Will would have thought, he saw it as the loss of someone who died for nothing."
blackops3,3dtmqo,ChampionsWrath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"I meant that Irons never hangs between good and evil. He just suddenly goes from a good guy into the villain. It's silly since there's no build up to that. He doesn't slowly transform into the villain. Nope, no time for that, he just declares war on the entire world out of nowhere."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,2,Sun Jul 19 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"Irons was a good guy, till his son died and used the KVA as a scapegoat for the nuclear power plant sabotages worldwide. He turned evil right after he used a catastrophe to his advantage. Then you begin to realize what he has become throughout the entire campaign. Are you saying that you want him to be both good and bad? Isn't he confused between what's right and wrong already?"
blackops3,3dtmqo,iruleurmom,0,Sun Jul 19 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, he isn't confused about right or wrong. Wilson Fisk in the new Daredevil is a bad guy from the start but we are given reasons to his motivations throughout the show. He only starts out as a guy who wants to do the right thing although his methods aren't exactly good, but as Daredevil messes his plans his methods start to become more and more evil. It's a believable process and the viewers come to understand his motivations and knowing his past are able to sympathize with him. There's no such process with Irons."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Mybrainmelts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:14 2015 UTC,Do you realize that's literally Irons in a nutshell? All was going according to plan till Hades gave them the USB. Then he's forced to show the world the man he truly is.
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,4,Sun Jul 19 13:10:57 2015 UTC,It was the first campaign with a antagonist that had personal agendas. It wasn't the average terrorist. Kevin Spacey deserves an award. He should also be featured in Half Life 3. ;)
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,4,Sun Jul 19 11:43:35 2015 UTC,There'll be another 4 SHG call of duty games before Half Life 3 :'(
blackops3,3dtmqo,Savid5,2,Sun Jul 19 12:42:15 2015 UTC,"According to the Reddit Bot, October 2626. ;)"
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,8,Sun Jul 19 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"Treyarch are my favourite developer mainly due to the zombie mode. They seem to add the most character and charm to their titles. Sledgehammers AW surprised me, very solid gameplay although I'm sick of the Exo movement now. For their first cod title they done well ."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Derp_of_the_West,3,Sun Jul 19 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"My friend and I really like Exo zombies but we don't play it as much. We play a couple games on release, do the Easter egg and don't really play it again. I like Exo zombies for the role it fills. Chaotic small and tight maps with easy to understand characters and story."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,4,Sun Jul 19 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"Ever since several members of Infinity Ward left for the green pastures of Respawn and Titanfall, the only COD games I've enjoyed are those made by Treyarch. Where as Ghosts and Advanced Warfare seem like a copy of a copy, Treyarchs's titles seem to change up the formula just enough to keep me hooked."
blackops3,3dtmqo,hxnterrr,4,Sun Jul 19 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"It's the little details that make me love Treyarch so much. In black ops 2 multiplayer, I love the geographical location in the map loading screen along with the pre match weapon readying animations."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,4,Sun Jul 19 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"Campaign wise, the Modern Warfare Trilogy had the best characters, depth, story, and drama. Can't say I ever cried when a Treyarch Charcter died"
blackops3,3dtmqo,Derp_of_the_West,3,Sun Jul 19 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"BO1 was great also, not sure which I liked more"
blackops3,3dtmqo,DAROCK2300,12,Mon Jul 20 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Quality of the games aside, it actually feels like Treyarch has a passion for what they're doing. It kinda just feels like the other two are just pumping out content for the money."
blackops3,3dtmqo,WhosAfraidOf_138,12,Sun Jul 19 10:13:38 2015 UTC,Its weird because I don't remember Infinity Ward replying to fans about Ghosts. Sledgehammer has heard the fans and did some tweaks to perks and the kill limit so at least they are trying. I feel that Sledgehammer games will not disappoint with their next game. I'm still skeptical about Ghosts II.
blackops3,3dtmqo,Savid5,6,Sun Jul 19 10:19:59 2015 UTC,I doubt that IW will come out with another ghosts title. It is regarded as the worst game in the franchise. Sales would plummet. They will most likely create a new IP. IMO.
blackops3,3dtmqo,agarret83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:42 2015 UTC,Yeah but the ending was a cliffhanger they'd have to do a campign only game
blackops3,3dtmqo,McEgan,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"Also feel that Sledgehammer cares more than IW does at this point, but I'm sure Activision is going to make them care a whole lot more next time around. Also I don't think they'd do a Ghosts 2 after what happened last year."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Nosfermarki,5,Sun Jul 19 10:31:19 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing more of a MW2 remake but I have a feeling that Ghosts 2 will be coming. Trust me, if they aren't idiots they won't screw it up all over again ;)"
blackops3,3dtmqo,Andrewgabbardwalker,8,Sun Jul 19 10:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain it will be a remake next year. Even people who don't play video games have some kind of idea that Ghosts generally wasn't a good game. I think they're going to want to distance themselves from that title, but only time will tell."

blackops3,3dtmqo,jameskies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:40 2015 UTC,All three developers pump out content for money. That's what Activision pays them to do. When I first really got into gaming you never heard anything about a game's upcoming dlc or if it had any. With every cod game you hear about a season pass even before they officially announce the game...
blackops3,3dtmqo,jameskies,3,Sun Jul 19 18:40:09 2015 UTC,Saving this thread for six months after the game is released. CoD cycle here we go again.
blackops3,3dtmqo,jameskies,3,Sun Jul 19 18:28:04 2015 UTC,I feel like Treyarch is the least likely to be a cash grabber. I won't name names but SOMEBODY has been turning COD into a pay to win game. Cough cough Advanced Supply Drops Cough cough
blackops3,3dtmqo,jameskies,2,Mon Jul 20 06:29:16 2015 UTC,That might have more to do with Activision than SHG
blackops3,3dtmqo,jameskies,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"To play devils advocate here, while Treyarch does appear to ""care"", ultimately what matters is the end product. While there is still enjoyment to be had in BO1/2, they are forever tainted by god awful netcode, hit detection, and matchmaking, which is a core component (maybe the most ""core"") of online MP. What makes this truly tragic is that the game itself is pretty good, good enough for most to look past this huge flaw and still keep playing. I know they've said they ""have a guy working on it"", but promises are one thing; the proof is in the finished product. And so far their finished products have been the worst of the 2 in this category (3 if you count AW, but its probably about equally bad).  To balance that criticism out a bit, while IW seems to always deliver technically sound games (barring early MW3), the game design itself is not as good as Treyarch. And sometimes the design is so bad, you don't even want to play it at all, which is what happened with me and a lot of people with Ghosts, the first CoD game that made me stop wanting to play it altogether.  SHG is at the bottom of the pile if you sum both categories up.  I feel like since MW2 (I liked both design and netcode in that game), its been an endless cycle of being disappointed in at least one of these categories. I wish the studios would collaborate more to help each other fix their weaknesses. Treyarch should use IW's engine and leverage whatever technical talents they have that make their games better in this department. Likewise, IW should ask Treyarch for feedback on design ideas and map layout. SHG should just suicide (I kid, but srsly, get help bros)."
blackops3,3dtmqo,AmerAlwafi,2,Mon Jul 20 07:05:16 2015 UTC,"You got a good point. I noticed that although Treyarch makes great content, the netcode and multiplayer issues are always there to plague us. Maybe we'll see if this continues when we play the beta."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Fat_Cat1991,2,Mon Jul 20 07:10:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like treyarch is just so much more focused on the feel of the game and the player experience. They make the game enjoyable and playable for all skill levels, and have enough grinding achievements to keep it interesting. I'm still playing BO2, working on diamond secondaries, and I love that I can still have a decent game using a terrible weapon because the controls are sharp and the maps are laid out well enough to let me develop a strategy."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Fat_Cat1991,3,Sun Jul 19 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"I noticed this when watching some old DLC trailers, Treyarch is the only company that actually does commentary over their trailers."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Fat_Cat1991,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. In Treyarch we trust.
blackops3,3dtmqo,RdJokr,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"It's obvious from their better campaign and the fact that zombies is THE side mode for call of duty. AW even attempted to mimic it and while it was a good ""side dish"" while waiting for the main course, that's all it will ever be a side dish.  I'm not a fan of the multiplayer so I can't comment on there."
blackops3,3dtmqo,RdJokr,2,Mon Jul 20 04:08:05 2015 UTC,"Treyarch has a good formula down for me. Make a great game, get more of my money. Simple! Hell would freeze over before I spent $200 for a IW game, and SH hasn't wow'd me at all. I'm probably going to pick up one of them special ps4s if they have them too. Everyone at Treyarch deserves a big bonus this year."
blackops3,3dtmqo,Fat_Cat1991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:08 2015 UTC,It would suck to see them stop making Call of Duties after this. :( They're the real heroes.
blackops3,3dtmqo,RdJokr,2,Mon Jul 20 06:11:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, while AW wasn't the best game ever I feel like SHG listens to the community more than any previous game"
blackops3,3dtmqo,Fat_Cat1991,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"You mean Zombies, They care more about Zombies and eSports."
blackops3,3dtmqo,jake1260,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Treyarch seem like they actually want to try and innovate the series, whilst still keeping the traditional CoD 'feel'.  The other developers seem to not be able to come up with their own, unique ideas, which is clearly depicted in how they try to copy the Zombies mode in Exo-Zombies and Extinction.  I give Sledgehammer some credit for at least trying something new in the Exosuits but I still didn't really enjoy the game.  Personally I only like Treyarch CoD titles because they feel as if much more love has been put into making the game the best they possibly can."
blackops3,3dtmqo,WigglyWastebin,2,Sun Jul 19 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"They learned through trial and error.  After the bombs that were CoD3 and WaW, they realized what they were doing wrong and fixed the issues to make their games better."

blackops3,3dtmqo,Troll521,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:41 2015 UTC,Im sure they all care greatly about their games and the franchise. Stop with this Treyarch is king bandwagon bullshit. They aren't that great.
blackops3,3dtmqo,mrdoitnyce,0,Sun Jul 19 19:18:22 2015 UTC,Then what are you doing here? Do you realize that this game is made by Treyarch?

blackops3,3dvld4,Jetforce01,5,Mon Jul 20 21:32:40 2015 UTC,Yessssss! I miss the MW2 days of playing SnD with my friends and pretty much everyone in the lobby would be talking. I met so many cool people through it and have so many hilarious memories
blackops3,3dvld4,OprahSwagfrey,6,Mon Jul 20 02:10:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I prefer game chat not being forced as I like giving call outs and being told call outs, perfect for Ranked/League Play."

blackops3,3dvld4,DPancoast,3,Mon Jul 20 11:33:41 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be forced if people want to talk and make friends they can use game chat but if they already have friends/in a party with friends they rather be in a party chat. In aw I only used game chat twice both times was cause the whole lobby was friends and friends of friends.
blackops3,3dvld4,DJvic7,3,Sun Jul 19 23:42:25 2015 UTC,I am not fond of this idea in the slightest. All it does is cause an inconvenience to everyone that doesn't like it.
blackops3,3dvld4,FR_Leviathan,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:23:52 2015 UTC,Then don't have a mic on? It's not a big deal. You know what is a pain in the ass? Going into a ranked game and no cunt on your team is talking because they're in parties with people not even in the game. It should be forced at least for ranked.

Either that or make perks so bland and have such little impact on gameplay that nobody will complain about the miniscule effects they provide.  Trying to eliminate ""crutch perks"" is a farce because it's not possible. Just because a ""crutch perk"" from previous games doesn't make an appearance it doesn't mean there won't be clear cut best options once the meta is established. Drift0r is a smart guy and I'm surprised he's never raised that point."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Tenshi-01,2,Mon Jul 20 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"Which is why I believed they'd never really go away, although the newer perks sound like they will have the most impact for SnD or other OBJs, every eSports team will will be using them for sure."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Southhh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"I guess the difference between a crutch perk and a perk that the majority uses, is that you can get away with using a different perk without really suffering. Like say for example Scavenger became extremely popular, you could drop it and wouldn't really notice much difference in fights. Whereas if you dropped toughness then you knew the difference with the crazy flinch compared to when you ran the perk, so that is what I think is different from a popular perk and a perk that is pretty much needed to do well."
blackops3,3dw1z6,CGA001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"The difference for Scavenger is when you start running a streak but can't keep pick up more ammo lol. Makes AW a pain, with everyone's dependency on the Exo, we need Blast Suppressor and Hard Wired for all the point whores spamming System Hacks. At least I know I suffer when trying not to use them.  And repeating what I said before, I believe these perks will really go for OBJ."
blackops3,3dw1z6,DJvic7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:07 2015 UTC,I did say not everyone would agree.
blackops3,3dw1z6,Synonysis,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:59 2015 UTC,I loved Titanfall. It was such great fun to play and was the only game I prestiged on. I don't know why it got such a bad reception but it's still a brilliant game regardless of what people say and think.  Now down to Call of Duty. I'm the type to not prestige just because I like the way the badge looks. Normally the other badges in CoD games suck so I always stay on the beginning level.
blackops3,3dw1z6,McEgan,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"I think this would be good for Call of Duty. Prestiging in Call of duty now has no challenge involved in it, they need to change it to actually awarding someone who is great with any weapon, not people who can use the most overpowered weapon for ten straight prestiges."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Tenshi-01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"That is tiring to see the same death week after week, what Black Ops 3 offers is more ways to kill and die for me. People will still rush and camp all the same, but we should more often see a death by a special ability/weapon, or scorestreaks (If they perform much better, fingers crossed for AI to be more reliable again.) I want to hopefully see lag in the netcode be done away with, as well as all the other sorts of technical innovations that all the playerbase but the big YouTube channels seem to ask."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Tenshi-01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"if they made it where you had to do challenges to level up i would stay at level 1, i only do challenges when i really need xp/completed it without trying or when i get to max and still want to play, or when i want camos,"
blackops3,3dw1z6,Tenshi-01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:29 2015 UTC,I would only agree if the challenges consists of objectives that does not make players go out of their way to get.
blackops3,3dw1z6,CraziBoi94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good idea in that it actually gives ""prestige"" back to the prestige system in that you are penalized in some way for doing it. That used to be there but they've been taking it away by allowing you to keep unlocks across prestiges, which sort of defeats the point; the ""prestige"" part is supposed to come from penalizing yourself (go back to lvl 1) when you don't have to.  I think it could be expanded on a bit by requiring you to do something or lose something different every prestige. As in for one prestige you have to do what you're talking about (a bunch of challenges), and for another you aren't allowed to use perks, another you aren't allowed to use killstreaks, another you aren't allowed to use a certain weapon class (or must use a certain one), etc. This would add some variety between prestiges rather than them being all the same as well as being more difficult than repeating something you've already done.  Offtopic a little, but expanding on that, it would be neat if there was a handicap(s) you could choose to impose on yourself before the match started. Lower hp, longer reload, killstreaks cost more, etc. It wouldn't give you anything other than ""prestige"" by other players seeing that you had them on yourself (maybe by little symbols next to your name on the scoreboard or something similar). Could maybe be tied to unlocking some calling cards or something too."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Broseboro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:19 2015 UTC,Then no one would prestige. CoD is too...casual or whatever for that.
blackops3,3dw1z6,ChampionsWrath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:33 2015 UTC,Didn't people hate this on Titanfall? I think I remember a lot of people complaining in that they felt the game forced them into doing stuff they didn't want.
blackops3,3dw1z6,tyzenberg,5,Mon Jul 20 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"I heard more complaints of Titanfall's lack of content more than the challenge system anyway. Not dismissing anyone that did, but in my perspective, I only ever heard about how there were too few guns, no streaks, Camo was a crutch, some burn cards were useless."
blackops3,3dw1z6,KindOfOk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I heard a lot of hate mainly being directed at how it was stupid to prestige, since the game forced you to do stuff you didn't want. Yes it needs to be a challenge but it also needs to be fun or people won't want it.   Some people love weapons like shields and so on, but I don't so I wouldn't want to run around with one just to prestige. It is the same for others that don't like certain styles."
blackops3,3dw1z6,Trollin_Thunder,0,Mon Jul 20 02:14:47 2015 UTC,Why I said instant gratification and constant rewarding.
blackops3,3dw1z6,Tippin187,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:56 2015 UTC,It is not instant since you still have to level up then lose everything you have unlocked. However going so far as to forcing people to do a certain thing in the game would ruin the fun for a lot of people.   They need a balance and I don't think many people complain about leveling up to Prestige other than losing all their progress towards certain things. How fast you Prestige usually comes down to your skill as a player as well.
blackops3,3dw1z6,tyzenberg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"I got to gen. 8 in that game, & those challenges were terrible. So much frustration over it. They'd either have to make challenges that compliment overall gameplay or just keep it the way it is."
blackops3,3dw1z6,MrSolid14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:48 2015 UTC,some of the regen challenges were straight up retarded. i swear the gooser challenge scarred me for life.. shudder
blackops3,3dw1z6,TeeHee225,0,Mon Jul 20 17:59:20 2015 UTC,They nerfed that and a few other challenges... 3Arc would get it right the first time
blackops3,3dw1z6,toonicetosayno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"The Gooser challenge is an excellent reason why the challenges are a good idea.  I remember being a Gen 3 early in the game and was scarred shitless of everybody over Gen 5.  Ejecting was almost a death sentence.  I sucked at getting goosers, after being forced to get them, I became a master and ended with about 500 total.  I was hitting goosers on cloaked pilots, I was using snipers/grenades/rail gun, they became trick shots.  Without that challenge, I'd be max level without ever mastering a key feature of the game.  When leveling is all about XP and not actually learning aspects of the game, you shouldn't put ""Master"" in the title of the max level."
blackops3,3dw1z6,TeeHee225,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"I don't care for that system. If you play using diversity, you will rank up faster anyway, because you gain more XP by using all guns, perks, etc. It's already set up that way. While I love Titanfall, those challenges were the one thing I didn't care for. I shouldn't be forced to play a certain way if I don't want to."

They wouldn't do that if they were keeping it out of BO3. I don't think it will be the BO1/2 nuketown though. They'd have to change up a lot of it to work in BO3. Maybe an actual town of nuketown or more of the neighborhood opening up.

blackops3,3du1fc,EpicHD,5,Sun Jul 19 13:41:44 2015 UTC,I saw something on here with a similar idea. His idea was to play tdm but every time you killed someone you got their gun.  So you can start with whatever you want but after that you have to use whatever the other person had. I think making a class for this would be super fun. Do you pick something good or something bad so other will have to use it too?

I'm the one who sent the tweet to @pcdev about the splitscreen because I'm really hoping for it...it's a feature on the consoles, so I've never understood why they remove it from the PC.

blackops3,3dskay,Joey_Drummer,7,Sun Jul 19 03:24:29 2015 UTC,My all-time favorite zombies gun that I would love to see return is by far the Galil. This thing was killer in Black Ops multiplayer and was actually probably my favorite gun from Black Ops all together.

blackops3,3druji,bm97,2,Sun Jul 19 04:59:36 2015 UTC,Not dirty at all. The point of a beta is to be able to try the game. Tons of games do free demos and betas and what not. It should be free regardless.
blackops3,3druji,alexrosenfeld10,-4,Sat Jul 18 23:07:07 2015 UTC,The point of a beta is to test the game... A demo is so you can try a game out.
blackops3,3druji,frankq144,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:53:30 2015 UTC,"Well my point is the same regardless. Should be free & it's for trying. I bet treyarch would be fine with people doing this to get the beta. For them it's still more people trying & playing their game, potentially leading to buying it."
blackops3,3druji,alexrosenfeld10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:58:56 2015 UTC,"Well if you think about it it is free. Besides reserving it for free if you do put money down you can do whatever you want with that money, even take it back the next day or put it towards something else. A beta can also make someone hate the game before release and lose a sale. I know I wouldnt have bought ghost and aw if they had betas lol so treyarch is at least still benefiting with high pre order numbers. Even if half of those people dont pick it up."
blackops3,3druji,frankq144,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, I assume if you like the game you'll keep it. This is just a super easy way to get the Beta w no money at risk. If u don't like the game, then cancel the preorder."

blackops3,3druji,DaftCinema,5,Sat Jul 18 21:45:08 2015 UTC,I use fakenamegenerator. Fake credit card isn't billed because you cancel
blackops3,3druji,madshayne,3,Sun Jul 19 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"Also, just an FYI, it's pretty illegal and you shouldn't admit to this, ever.

blackops3,3druji,BigCockMcLong,3,Sat Jul 18 22:11:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but this eliminates putting any money down and making two trips to Gamestop.
blackops3,3druji,Usernamesarehard7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:15 2015 UTC,Not everybody has a debit card surprisingly and would like to get their cash back.
blackops3,3druji,Enassi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess if u don't have a debit or credit card you can't use Amazon. At the same time, I don't see too many people with an Xbox One who don't have some sort of digital payment (including PayPal). There's no money involved in preordering from Amazon until the game ships so there's no risk as long as you cancel if u don't like the game."
blackops3,3druji,WaterFireAirAndDirt,2,Sun Jul 19 07:10:55 2015 UTC,"But with us you get the code on the spot, no need to worry about not getting a code."

blackops3,3dtvic,maniacalxmatt,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:09:12 2015 UTC,"the game wasnt broken until that was discovered. and i really dont think the community would have found out (because it went so long) until a certain youtuber posted it as a video..  however, i do agree that since it was discovered, it broke the game, and would like to see it removed or at least danger close removed. and to see commando with a different motive, or removed as well. and of SP built into the guns and not a perk."
blackops3,3dtvic,GamingMedicalGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"Even better, if these games did get remade, or even back compat, they added a playlist that disabled these perks for use. Even though I doubt it would happen, it would be interesting."

blackops3,3dtvic,dylan96r,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"Could be, but why would they just remaster them with the only thing changing the resolution? It would be a better idea to make a game with all the best things from MW and MW2 (and maybe also MW3, but I didn't like that as much) with some remade maps, reused guns and current-gen graphics."

blackops3,3dsqau,TheDaveMeowthews,6,Sun Jul 19 02:24:41 2015 UTC,"The game features nine separate specialists, customizable player-characters with unique dialogue, along with a special ability and weapon that are earned on a timer or based on in-game performance.   For example, the specialist ""Ruin"" has Gravity Spikes as a special weapon that deals damage over an area when activated, as well as Overclock for ability which grants a temporary boost of speed.  You will base your loadouts on these specialists - you can only choose one specialist per game, but your loadouts will remain the same.   As previously mentioned, there are nine specialists, but only six have been showcased thus far:   Ruin (Gravity Spikes/Overclock speed boost) Seraph (Annihilator one shot pistol/Combat Focus, which adds points toward your scorestreaks) Outrider (Sparrow explosive bow and arrow/Vision Pulse, which is like threat detection from Advanced Warfare) Reaper (Scythe minigun deployed from arm/Psychosis, which deploys decoys of Reaper to confuse enemies) Prophet (Tempest semi-auto lightning gun, similar to the Arc Cannon from Titanfall/Glitch, which teleports you back to a previous position) Nomad (H.I.V.E. nano drone balls of death/Rejack, which gives a health boost from near death, similar to exo stim from Advanced Warfare)   All special weapons and abilities are unique to their characters and only their characters."

blackops3,3dt3wg,Gonzaz_,2,Sun Jul 19 05:00:20 2015 UTC,Only reason why I'm going the digital route this time. I like having the physical disk and my internet is subpar but this deal is too good to pass up.

blackops3,3dt9kk,Xeilith,4,Sun Jul 19 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"no, the ""struggle"", while not a struggle, is the pesky get X amount of hipfire/heashots etc to unlock the attachment. when in every cod should go back to BO2 where you got the gun, and leveled the gun up.. simple as that. and leave the headshots and extra stuff for camos."
blackops3,3dt9kk,GamingMedicalGuy,8,Sun Jul 19 16:34:47 2015 UTC,Prestiging isn't meant to be easy.
blackops3,3dt9kk,AUKronos,3,Sun Jul 19 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you were downvoted, because I agree. When you prestige you have to sacrifice, and I don't understand why in the latest game they just hold your hand throughout all the prestiges. I miss when it was like starting all over again."
blackops3,3dt9kk,nihppils,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"Back when prestiging was just a new emblem and an extra class, there was no reason in prestiging in a lot of peoples eyes. Now with the whole ""Bring a gun/perk/piece of equipment"" there is kind of a reaosn. But it's still fairly difficult for people who aren't that great at the game, even if they take the best gun with them through prestige. AW was fairly easy, as I was 2nd prestige within 12 hours of release."
blackops3,3dt9kk,Somertonn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:02:39 2015 UTC,Haha dude prestiging involves nothing more than playing the game for long enough and then pressing a button. There are no specific tasks required to be able to prestige other than earn enough points. How does it get any easier than that?
blackops3,3dt9kk,OneKup,2,Sun Jul 19 23:52:53 2015 UTC,I just hope there isn't 32 prestiges lol
blackops3,3dt9kk,DPancoast,2,Mon Jul 20 11:44:34 2015 UTC,Weapon progress was separate from player progress in BO2. It'll probably be the exact same.

This is how it goes down:   The company that makes the fridges tells Activision, ""We can make 250,000 of these ready for launch."" Activision tells each retailer how many they will get. Retailers take preorders until they hit their limit. Company making fridges tells Activision they're ahead of schedule and can make 50,000 more than they thought. Activision tells retailers they can sell more.   Right now, they're at a limit of how many they can make between now and launch.    Numbers are just for the sake of the argument"

blackops3,3drql2,sonnyblack69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:44:54 2015 UTC,You should have got the beta key up to 3 days after you preordered.
blackops3,3drql2,mortysteve,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:34 2015 UTC,Nope... its like over 1 week now. But on Amazon is a infobox that tells me that pre-orders will get the key at the latest 2 weeks before the BETA starts. hmm

blackops3,3dsna8,Ridoon,6,Sun Jul 19 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"Why can't they do the multiplayer HUD like AW's campaign HUD? The ammo counter is in the gun and the grenades you hold are on the side. I thought it was neat, and left a whole lot of space. Wasn't BO2's future campaign HUD similar?"
blackops3,3dsna8,bruh_dinosaurs,4,Sun Jul 19 04:06:47 2015 UTC,I was bummed that they didn't implement this feature in MP but I think it's because the older gen consoles were holding them back.

blackops3,3dsna8,chillw00,3,Sun Jul 19 02:05:52 2015 UTC,It could be better. Everything is slightly pointed up which bothers. Also the color combination makes it look even worse.

Just rewatched the MP Reveal Trailer again, the C-UAV image appears later, but it looks like a very unfinished version of it, so this is very different. Could this be the new VSAT/Blackbird, or is it something like the Guardian?"

blackops3,3dsna8,SwagMagician,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:05:58 2015 UTC,That's the specialist power up not a sand timer. Over all i agree with you though it's a nice HUD.
blackops3,3dsna8,Ludbunta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"Ah of course, specialists completely went out of my head, although I guess they still could remove it and try and squeeze it in somewhere else, maybe without a logo to identify it, more like just a little line that gradually fills. It could be vertical next to the scorestreaks etc."

blackops3,3dnmgq,falconbox,2,Sat Jul 18 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"You know, that isn't relevant since this is about Black Ops 3 and not Black Ops 2. And for the record, every other multiplayer game has it too, it's called latency."
blackops3,3dnmgq,Unrelentingpisstrain,5,Sat Jul 18 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"How is their most recent game in same series ""not relevant?"" I'll assume that same problem in still in the game unless proven otherwise."
blackops3,3dnmgq,Johtoboy,2,Sat Jul 18 04:54:50 2015 UTC,"Not important, are you nuts?  I agree that Treyarch is a great developer, but if they fail to address the collective skepticism regarding CoD's netcode with actual ingame improvements, they'll just be another clone-stamper to make profit off their brand.  And the video you commented on doesn't show network latency. It shows that even in split-screen on the same machine, there's a noticable delay between the two."
blackops3,3dnmgq,alexwoodgarbage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:32:15 2015 UTC,"I said not relevant. I know it isn't network latency, but is it a big deal? Chances are that nobody would have noticed if not for that video. Now people have something else to blame their deaths on. There's a reason why the artificial latency is there. I don't know why."
blackops3,3dnmgq,Unrelentingpisstrain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:45:09 2015 UTC,"Is essence, the guy you replied is asking for the netcode as a whole to be prioritized.  And your answer comes across as 'all games have latency, big deal'  It's a huge deal.   I don't know how active you are in the sub, other communities, and for how long, but the netcode/lag compensation/rewind time/whateveryouwanttocallit has been a constant and substantial complaint since BO1. It's why so many people ask for dedicated servers.   It's a huge deal because for many players who go over the 100 hours mark, it becomes unbearably frustrating.  Your attitude and 'reason to blame their deaths on' comment are condescending and frankly, fucking annoying, if only for the fact that ever since this shit started back in 2007, people that didn't notice the problem felt the need to counter those that did with the exact same attitude and comments.  It's a real problem. If you don't notice it, it's because you're either on the beneficial side of it, or are just not responsive enough.  You could check out Ovenbakedmuffin on youtube, the guy has made some elaborate videos on the topic.  It'll help you understand why there's artificial latency baked into the game."
blackops3,3dnmgq,alexwoodgarbage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"Vonderhaar said netcode is a priority. Of course we'll need proof but we'll see. Also, network latency is something they can't fix. Too many think dedicated servers are the fix, and let me tell you, it most certainly is not. I'm not going to pretend like I have any idea how the ""netcode"" works, it's just a buzzword. I've gone over the 200 hours mark and it still isn't a big deal.   Your attitude and 'reason to blame their deaths on' comment are condescending and frankly, fucking annoying   Rude. You read it like that, I didn't type it like that. If typing and adding punctuation marks is condescending and annoying, I can't help you with that. People find things all the time to blame their deaths on, me included. To not point it out would be ridiculous. Also, when they added the artificial latency, I'm sure they were thinking of both sides: those with bad ping, and those with great ping. They wouldn't do it for no reason.  And, I've seen his video. Quite interesting. I'll have to check it out again."

blackops3,3dnmgq,alexwoodgarbage,2,Mon Jul 20 09:50:38 2015 UTC,It is IMO because everyone is praising Treyarch as a great developer (I don't disagree) but they can't fix issues like this.  He's saying they should focus on fixing gameplay issues like this before focusing on little details like the camping spot.
blackops3,3dnmgq,Mbozes_Taint,3,Sat Jul 18 02:29:58 2015 UTC,I think that issue isn't much relatable to a detail a map creator put in. You can't say Treyarch focuses on little details in a map when there most likely was a small group of map designers who thought it was a neat easter egg
blackops3,3dnmgq,Themursk,2,Sat Jul 18 06:16:51 2015 UTC,True I didn't think of that
blackops3,3dnmgq,Mbozes_Taint,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:39:59 2015 UTC,"It's not that they can't. I'm pretty sure they did that on purpose. It's not relevant because we don't know for sure if the artificial latency returns or not in Black Ops 3. I don't think artificial latency was ever an issue in BO2. Now, thanks to whoever that was, pointing it out, most people are going to assume it's an issue, when in reality it isn't. I know there's a reason for them adding the latency, they wouldn't do it out of spite."
blackops3,3dnmgq,Unrelentingpisstrain,4,Sat Jul 18 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"You seriously don't think the camera glitches were an issue?  You've never been killed without seeing someone, or around a corner?  Every game in BO2 was filled with these.  That's why the person jumping around a corner had the upper hand in a gunfight, even if they had no clue where you were.  That's why what you saw on the killcam was nothing like what you saw on your screen.  That's why AW is so flukey, because the exo movements make the glitches worse.  I'm really hoping they can fix it."
blackops3,3dnmgq,Mbozes_Taint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, let me clarify. At times, it was like I was shot around corners, but that's inevitable. Artificial latency or not, shooting around corners will happen. It wasn't often enough for me to think, ""okay, that was BS!"" or something. I've found that it was never really an issue for me. I play on PC, so that would mean a difference in experiences. Also, the jumping around corners is to surprise the enemy. Everyone expects someone to walk, but if you jump, you catch them by surprise. I've jumped around corners and still died. And killcams, unless they record exactly what happened, will never be 100% accurate."

blackops3,3dnmgq,ACiDRiFT,37,Fri Jul 17 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"Treyarch is more involved and has a larger presence, both in the casual and pro communities. Plus they don't take themselves too seriously.

blackops3,3dqpz9,16Jack,2,Sat Jul 18 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"You will not. For digital preorders the beta should simply appear on your dashboard when it's ready to download/play, you don't need a code.  Atleast that's what I hope..."

blackops3,3dsv66,jjizzel5555,3,Sun Jul 19 03:22:04 2015 UTC,It's not logic; it's stealing.
blackops3,3dsv66,WickedColdfront,-5,Sun Jul 19 03:40:48 2015 UTC,It's not stealing Sony knows of the situation same as Microsoft knows its happening both companies were going to implement game sharing features but stopped for DRM/People reasons. Microsoft announced it and Sony saw the reaction to their announcement and never went for it. So its not stealing it's something most people are doing on both consoles.
blackops3,3dsv66,Wiktorjor2001,6,Sun Jul 19 03:44:21 2015 UTC,"The feature is intended for a single household with multiple consoles.  IMO, people who illegitimately game share are no different than software pirates.  It most certainly is not something that most people do.  You can justify it all you want, but at the end of the day Treyarch sells one less game for each pair of game sharers.  Developers have collectively spent hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of hours working on BO3 -- the least you can do is pay for the game if you're going to play it.  Edit: words"

That way when the game is released at midnight you can just start playing. If youre on west coast you could even start playing 3 hours early since the game is released on midnight east coast time... At least for xbox it is idk about psn.
blackops3,3dqdud,FatalHydra,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, same with PSN. I'm CST so I get to play an hour early.  Also, Next-Gen offer pre-loads which basically gives you like ~3 days to download it before launch. And keep in mind that even physical copies take up HDD space. The game is downloaded from CD to HDD versus Internet to HDD. Space is taken up regardless, many think buying physical copy saves space, it doesn't."

blackops3,3dp808,RoyalFlush666,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:45:24 2015 UTC,Because it was going to only be on current gen. Then a bunch of last gen players complained and Activision saw all the $ they could make so they are making what will no doubt be a complete piece of shit port for last gen.
blackops3,3dp808,TheWhiteTestament,0,Sat Jul 18 18:22:38 2015 UTC,You downvoted me and gave me THIS as your reply?  What an absolute bullshit answer.  You have no proof of any of that.  I sincerely doubt it was ever even considered NOT to make it for the last gen.
blackops3,3dp808,RoyalFlush666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"the first month after the reveal Treyarch and Activision made it very clear BO3 would be available only on PS4, X1, & PC.

blackops3,3dp808,BasedGodCrim,2,Sat Jul 18 06:12:35 2015 UTC,Oh one if those guys huh......
blackops3,3dp808,oli2194,0,Sat Jul 18 15:38:58 2015 UTC,I think it should maybe just act as a UAV for those who run the counter.
blackops3,3dp808,FiveFinger_Discount,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:52:32 2015 UTC,"There was already a counter in BO2, EMP's. They had like a 15second jam of the radar and hud, with insane radius on the emp itself. 2 of those chucked mid map on Nuketown or hijacked would ruin the VSAT for everybody on the other team. Plus, if you get a VSAT dropped on you, then you deserve to be raped for the next 45 seconds that it is up. There shouldn't be a way to actually and reliably hide from it, when it is an upper/mid tier streak. Thats the risk of running it, you won't get it every game, but when you do you are rewarded."
blackops3,3dp808,T_Immobilisation,0,Sat Jul 18 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you! A logical person. I don't get why everyone hates the VSAT, it was balanced perfectly in Bo2. No one complained about the Oracle in ghosts, or the threat detection UAV, which were actually broken and the latter making low profile a crutch perk in domination."
blackops3,3dp808,Nalgul,0,Sat Jul 18 20:02:24 2015 UTC,So it's balanced on 2 tiny ass maps.  What about the rest of the maps where emps will do nothing?
blackops3,3dp808,T_Immobilisation,0,Sat Jul 18 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"Counter UAV'S. EMP Scorestreak. And the range of EMP'S is ridiculous, they're extremely effective on every single map. Run scavenger if need be. The VSAT isn't OP. Even ignoring the above, it's easily counterable by just playing tactically. Whenever I get a VSAT called in against me, I switch to a loud gun (because there's no longer any point in using a suppressor) and play tactically. Strafe ADS around corners, slow down your movement, or if you lack the gun skill just pull out a Remington and camp in a house somewhere until the VSAT'S gone. The people who complain about the VSAT are usually the people who can't get one themselves. If you did you'd see how easy it is to die with it up."
blackops3,3dp808,Nalgul,0,Sat Jul 18 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Counter UAV? LOL..let me shoot it with 1 anti air rocket.  EMP Scorestreak?...  Unless you sit on it the entire round waiting for a VSAT, it's USELESS.  You can strafe all you want, lmao, but I can still see you stafe on the mini map.  I actually get VSAT damn near every other round which is why I'm saying it's so OP.  Anyone who gets them as much as I do knows how devastating they are."
blackops3,3dp808,T_Immobilisation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"Hardly anyone carries launchers. When I said strafing I meant pre-aim around corners, that's usually when people with a VSAT up pounce (speaking from experience, I always wait around corners when I get my VSAT'S). It's really not that hard. EMP grenades are a viable solution just spam them whenever possible, and run scavenger. It's not game breaking. They're not OP. Sure they're powerful, but if you're a competent player you should easily be able to deal with it. If you're not, then that's probably why you get so many VSAT'S called in against you in the first place. There's no way you'd be able to change it without making the streak useless. Just bring EMP grenades and you're all set."
blackops3,3dp808,T_Immobilisation,0,Sun Jul 19 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"Vonderhaar already confirmed there will be a ""VSAT-Like"" streak in Bo3, and there'll be a new way to fight back against it. I hope there isn't a perk to counter it, that would make the streak useless like advanced UAV in mw3."

blackops3,3dmqul,mrdoitnyce,36,Fri Jul 17 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see MW4 happening since they already moved on afterwards with Ghost.   Remember, they've had 3 years to work on this one and able to read a lot of the criticism from Ghost. Will be interesting to see which direction they take it."
blackops3,3dmqul,S_cute,13,Fri Jul 17 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Ghosts as a brand has a seriously bad reputation. As do Infinity Ward as a studio since MW3. The average gamer who isn't on Reddit or YouTube just knows MW3 and moreso Ghosts were poor games.  It's going to take a lot for Infinity Ward to get back faith from both casual and more hardcore followers alike. Modern Warfare has nostalgic brand power and a remaster would certainly tap into that as would a direct sequel.  Edit for clarity, I liked both MW3 and Ghosts to some degree and personally wouldn't mind a Ghosts 2 if lessons were learned. Heck I thought squads was a fantastic idea but like a lot of Ghosts it was just poorly implemented."
blackops3,3dmqul,TotallySnappy,3,Fri Jul 17 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, I actually skipped out on Ghost mainly because of my disappointment from MW3 (MW3 wasn't a ""terrible"" game, BO1 was more fun and still relevant, same with Ghost, BO2 was still relevant).  I think IW's next game is going to be critical for their future success. Like you said, both MW3 and Ghost are near the bottom and it's going to be a dagger if they release another title that doesn't succeed.   For me, I would like to see them take a completely different route. I think a remaster at this time for them would be devastating. Simply because MW3 was similar to a remaster, IMO, and it didn't turn out so well. I think you just bury Ghost and come out with a new title altogether. Unless BLOPS3 is just a complete hit, I don't see them making a BLOPS4, so now is a good time to start a new series. Time will tell."

blackops3,3dmqul,neK231,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I never said ""more relevant"", I mentioned that the 3arc games were still relevant. I don't have the statistics (too much work to look them up) to say that the population was larger on BO1 than MW3 or that BO2 was larger than Ghost. Like /u/neK231 said, even after the release of the IW following a 3arc year, the 3arc game stayed populated. Even now, those games still fetch a decent population and if they were currently playable on PS4/X1 then those numbers may even double."
blackops3,3dmqul,S_cute,-9,Sat Jul 18 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"MW3 wasn't a bad game, it's just your fucking opinion and you're saying like it sucks. MW3 was really good but everyone compared it to a perfect game (MW2). MOAB's, Specialist streaks and the snipers are really loved."

blackops3,3dmqul,OneKup,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure honestly, they might want to stay away from Ghosts now, it's often regarded as one of the worst COD's ever.   They could just start an entirely new story with the MW4 banner, rather than making a new series IMO, which I could see."
blackops3,3dmqul,ChilledB,2,Fri Jul 17 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"i don't know. time will show it to us... i personally enjoyed ghosts. and aw is a thing, i didn't want to buy it because all the people were saying its bad. but now that i picked up AW i really enjoy gunfights with boosting around and stuff :)  if they don't want bad PR with ghosts 2 they would need to give everything to the game. so people would realize that they made some mistakes. but that they will make it better this time around."

blackops3,3dmqul,OneKup,2,Sat Jul 18 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"They could use Ghosts, but it was the playstyle that people didn't like. It was to slow, so they would need to change that and well the hit detection was amazing. They should keep that but maybe have the guns do less damage, so they will increase the TTK without messing with the hit detection."
blackops3,3dmqul,Tenshi-01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly the TTK isn't really an issue.  If you play a map like Showtime that was the fastest rushing map in the game it doesn't even matter.  The real issue was the default maps were to campy with how large they were and all the grass, windows and tree areas to hide in."
blackops3,3dmqul,XboxWigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"I just say the TTK as well as how it generally players, because people didn't like that when you were shot, you didn't have time to react or turn on people. If the other person wasn't a bad shot and could land his bullets then you were dead. To me this wasn't really a bad thing, but people say it takes away skill.   The maps and general slow style would have to be changed but if they could do that, then it may be possible to keep the story and make it a Ghosts 2. It might have been in the future but the maps did mostly have that dark gritty feeling similar to old wars."
blackops3,3dmqul,Tenshi-01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:25 2015 UTC,I agree with you.
blackops3,3dmqul,Boonsquemador,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"Im a nerd so I've thought about this  a lot but an mw4 game with a new story line that ties into the old one would be amazing for me. i think about a family connection to someone like Price and youre his son and you find out about untold past and it opens a whole new avenue for them to go down. Kind of like what treyarch does with zombies but they could make it so the story we know from mw1-3 is a lie, and we delve into a deeper darker world. Obviously there would need to be a plot for the present as well in the game. I could think of all sorts of one liners and shit they could put in their trailers to hint at things.   as far as the game goes if it has mw2 movement and just a mix of new guns and guns from past cods it cant fail. although the map design could be an issue, seeing as they made mostly awful maps in ghosts, the ones with next to no structure. as far as movement and the smoothness of a game goes ive always thought IW is the best. I just dont see the ""Ghosts"" name selling, similarly to you I think they should let the hate wear down and then maybe bring Ghosts back in the future. its probably to late now, they'll already be working on their new game but this is what i hope for. They could still  make a good game with ""Ghosts 2"" i mean its just a name really isnt it? but my trouble with ghosts is the story line, i think its absolute shit and i know they left it on a cliffhanger but id rather a MW game with new storyline. also i care about cod and nostalgia sells, for the good of this franchise they should give everyone a classic cod game that people have been crying out for"

blackops3,3dmqul,XboxWigger,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:03 2015 UTC,I have no issue with the new movement.  It is fun but the rest of the game is a mess.  Go and play classic mode without the exo movement and see what the game has to offer.  Absolutely nothing.
blackops3,3dmqul,runealex007,5,Fri Jul 17 22:08:30 2015 UTC,Which is why the new movement is a main component of a game...
blackops3,3dmqul,XboxWigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:56:13 2015 UTC,"Which is around 30 percent of the core content that was innovated in the game and justifies my point that it has nothing to offer once you look past it.  They added boring customizable scorestreak, blah new game modes, new match making system no one likes, mostly useless exo abilities, and unbalanced and mostly useless weapon variants.  The game sucks."
blackops3,3dmqul,runealex007,2,Sat Jul 18 01:25:45 2015 UTC,But you're not supposed to look past it. It IS the game. And the game with it is fun
blackops3,3dmqul,XboxWigger,0,Sat Jul 18 02:39:16 2015 UTC,"It's fun?  The spawns are terrible, the lag comp is through the roof and the hit detection is ""off"".  The game started off as just being unbalanced with the RNG weapon drops and then it became a kinda pay to win RNG weapon drop system system on top of all ready at least spending 60 bucks on a new copy.  Were is there ""fun"" in that."
blackops3,3dmqul,rmx687,7,Sat Jul 18 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"I said it in another thread but IW only had 2 years to make a game for 6 platforms across 2 1/2 generations. With 3 years to focus on current gen, I think they can pull an Assassin's Creed 2 and make a high-quality improvement the first could have been. I personally wanna see Ghosts 2 because I just need a more modern setting. Extinction was fantastic and the Campaign was my favorite since MW2, the pacing and personal story was very well done.  Unfortunately, the other studios have been hinting that they'd love a WW2 revival and if it's ever going to happen, it will be IW's next project.  Whatever it is, they are pulling out all the stops to make something big. Activision has pressed the reset button on that studio, retiring Rubin, putting a longtime producer back in charge, bringing back Respawn people, and attracting top industry talent, including from Naughty Dog. I would love them to put that energy into reenergizing Ghosts but am excited to see it regardless of whatever it is."

blackops3,3dmqul,JasonDeSanta,3,Fri Jul 17 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I know they have only hired MW2's multiplayer director back or something, who else they hired?"
blackops3,3dmqul,Gawdsuperman,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:31:58 2015 UTC,Even that one guy you mentioned is bigger than you can comprehend  he is the lead multiplayer designer from MW1 and MW2 and that is one thing that ghosts just didn't do right multiplayer.  They have hired veterans from naughty dog and i can easily say there is no introduction needed for them as they are the best in the industy.  tons of in house changes not reported just wait  2016 awaits
blackops3,3dmqul,JasonDeSanta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:41:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is Naughty Dog's magic comes from the non-corporate nature of the whole studio. Sony mostly leave them alone and let them do their own thing, Activision on the other hand is definitely not a publisher like that. So yes, them being from Naughty Dog is huge since they only hire the best of the best, but don't expect them to work freely like they did in Naughty Dog. Call of Duty studios are unfortunately highly corporate and it shows in their games. Let's hope it works for the best though."

blackops3,3dmqul,ca6vtec,3,Sat Jul 18 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"Ghosts 2, actually.  Solely based on the fact they got a ton of negative feedback on Ghosts, and thus could work on all of the issues the last game had, whilst making a better all-around game and experience. Ghosts had some great things, such as weapon balance and hit detection, but everything else needed work.  However. I'm guessing t will be MW4, considering it's an established series, and has a relatively good track record, so it will entice a lot of people to check it out. They want to bring as many people as possible in at the end of the day, and Ghosts won't do that."

blackops3,3dmqul,joshafool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:19 2015 UTC,I'm guessing new IP that follows Ghosts storyline. Kind of like how Black Ops followed World at War
blackops3,3dmqul,XboxWigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"They could do anything and people will still buy it. It really confuses me as to why people hate the games and the developers but still buy the game. It's just how the CoD cycle goes people hate the game that came out that year and hype the fuck out of the next game. It happened with Black Ops 2, I remember so many people who said Black Ops 2 was the worst CoD game and then after Ghosts and AW they say it was the best game ever."
blackops3,3dmqul,GamingMedicalGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"People will still buy it, just millions fewer will. I think no one realized how far the franchise would sink after BO2. I hold ATVI responsible."

blackops3,3dmqul,GamingMedicalGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:45:23 2015 UTC,This is IW chance to redeem themselves. I think they are going to try extra hard to get their next game right. This will also be their first time getting 3 years to develop.  If they don't develop for PC like PCdev's team does they can count me out though.
blackops3,3dmqul,colin_7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:42 2015 UTC,My best is on MW4 or a game going back WW2.  There will be no Ghosts 2 because the brand won't sell the game since everyone hated the first one.
blackops3,3dmqul,Fat_Cat1991,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"ghosts wasnt a bad game, idc if i get hate or not. the point is, it was not bad. better than AW, but slightly worse than BO2. the majority, of players who ""hate"" the game mainly hate it before the health got buffed and it was shit.  along with the some of the weak kill-point streaks.  bah im not going into this, its okay to hate thats fine part of life, but some things of ghosts goes overlooked is all im saying."
blackops3,3dmqul,ScottyK9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"The reason people hated Ghosts is because the maps were awful.  Fucking gigantic with zero flow.   It certainly wasn't my favorite CoD game, but I had some good times.   That said, I'm not looking forward to their next installment.  Once we have a Treyarch title on PS4, I'll gladly play that for the next 2-3 years."

blackops3,3dmqul,GratefulUser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:56:47 2015 UTC,The main reason I'm not a big fan of IW games is because of their choice of color. The modern warfare series and ghosts had such a lack of color it turned me off instantly.

IW know they have to reserve all the silly mistakes they made with mw3 and ghosts they have one last shot at it because you can bet ya arse ACTVI won't give them another chance its do or die for them if they fail the studio will never make another call of duty again the pressure on them right now is incredible and you will never know.

blackops3,3doibc,TheReload,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"Vahn has talked about this a while back. He said that matchmaking can't really help with this, because it will look for the best match that fits your connection. So if lobby A is the best result, then you'll be put in lobby A 99% of the time, unless a new, better lobby B comes up (better is debatable, because there could be other factors affecting this, like DLC and whatnot).   Also, don't throw you into searching for a new lobby when you're mid-game or already in a lobby.   Have any COD game ever searched for lobbies while you're mid-game? And I don't think that COD has ever searched for other lobbies while you're in a lobby, unless that lobby doesn't have enough players to start a match. I've experienced that with BO2 before."

No matter what I do, I never end up playing a full game. Im sick of it."
blackops3,3doibc,FuXs-,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"Can't play full game because you cause everyone to quit and you win? Can't play full game because you back out when you have a bad team?    Anyway, if bo3 played as smoothly as older cods like mw2 it wouldn't matter if you were on the bad team, because you could still do well regardless of your team even if you get a loss.

Those players had an ample amount of time to move away, it was core after all.   Not putting you in the same lobby is tricky though, there are only a limited number of lobbies before you're stuck in a lobby alone. Then what if someone else backs out of your lobby and all the others. Then you have two people all alone. It's a little more elaborate than that, but you should get the idea. I wouldn't be oppose to a ban though, maybe after you back out of 3-5 lobbies within an hour you get slapped with a 10-15minute ban."

blackops3,3dll3m,CGA001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:34:27 2015 UTC,i mean i guess you could say i like it too.  but i don't see how anyone could play the other maps and still prefer tranzit over them.  The only way is the reason why Kino is a lot of people's fave.  because of a nostalgia factor for those whose first zombie experience was on that map
blackops3,3dll3m,CGA001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah I don't prefer Tranzit over other Maps, it could probably make it into my Top 5, but MoTD and Kino are definitely on the top for me.  Agreed on Kino, it actually was my first Zombies experience and I still love it to this day. I'd take Kino over MoTD if it had a big EE like MoTD did, though running trains throughout the Map with Elena Siegman in the background was so amazing."
blackops3,3dll3m,mhallett,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"yeah i think a map being ones ""first zombie experience"" often times plays a big part in how one likes it.  See i personally don't like kino very much.  i spent more time on Five when BO1 came out.  But Verruckt is the first zombie map that i spent a lot of time on, and so it has a high nostalgia factor for me.    So in that case, if someone hadn't ever played zombies and then fell in love with the mode on tranzit i guess i can see where nostalgia could help the map rank higher for them"

I thought it was awesome that they made a map based around ""Die Glocke"", something that has always fascinated me, even though it is almost certainly bullshit.  If I had to rank my top five, I'd say:   Der Riese Five Kino der Toten Call of the dead Moon"
blackops3,3dll3m,AUKronos,2,Fri Jul 17 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I agree with your top 5. However, what do you like about Five? Personally I was really bad at it and didn't care for the Map too much.  Thanks for Voting!"
blackops3,3dll3m,Jagged_Gorgeous,2,Fri Jul 17 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"Most people react that way when I say Five is my my favorite map next to Der Riese. I love the atmosphere of it, the look of the pentagon and it's secret underground test facility, the cramped corridors, and especially the mad scientist. He adds a great feeling of terror as he chases you down, and yet he can be easy to kill if you have the Mustang and Sally. A combination of terror and atmosphere make it my favorite map (I like it just as much as I like Der Riese.)."
blackops3,3dll3m,Throwawaystartover,2,Fri Jul 17 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"This is actually such a good explanation, thanks for that! And now that I think of it, I completely agree, the setting, look, and feel of Five was awesome. As for the Mad Scientist, fuck that guy, I hated him, he scared me so many times lmao"
blackops3,3dll3m,Shabur,2,Fri Jul 17 13:15:03 2015 UTC,"Well hey, what's the point of having zombies in a game if you aren't getting scared? That's unfortunately something no other map has made me feel in a long time, fear."
blackops3,3dll3m,SaneClownPosse,2,Fri Jul 17 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Verruckt was actually quite scary imo. The fact that it was previously an Insane Asylum, not to mention the scary ass crying and screams that you can hear next to the incinerators. Oh and those Mannequins that were made to look like they hung themselves, those were really creepy too!"
blackops3,3dll3m,jacob2815,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:47 2015 UTC,"That one was great, definitely the map with the scariest atmosphere. Also, it's the only map to have zombies that run significantly faster than you, so training is much more difficult."
blackops3,3dll3m,GratefulUser,2,Fri Jul 17 13:26:43 2015 UTC,"We need more Maps like Verruckt, if you ask me. Vondy pls  Did they run faster? I honestly never noticed. Was it a WaW only thing, or were they also faster in Black Ops 1 version?"
blackops3,3dll3m,beater613,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"I agree.  They only ran faster in world at war. If you don't have a pistol to run with, they will catch up to you very quickly."
blackops3,3dll3m,LifeHated,2,Fri Jul 17 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"Hm, that must've been why I never noticed it, I only played it on WaW a few times, played it a lot more on Black Ops."
blackops3,3dll3m,Joshwoocool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"Verruckt was always my favourite, you could barely train zombies but it was great for getting almost every weapon in the box, sitting with 3 other friends at the end of the hall and constantly shooting shit until you got overrun."
blackops3,3dll3m,Joshwoocool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Training was pretty poor but it was still a great Map. Not to mention the Winter's Howl, that thing was a fuckin' beast."

blackops3,3dlk69,mucimau,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the Call of Duty devs could figure out a good way to balance the special blades: alter range, lunge, swing and recover time, effective radius, so on per different type of weapon.  Yeah a Butterfly knife would be rad. They could also have a special feature for it where if you keep YYing with it (like, twice in a row and on), your character would start doing cool moves with it instead of the normal swapping."

blackops3,3dlk69,ACiDRiFT,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:44 2015 UTC,What about multipurpose uses like using a throwable or melee weapon as an in-combat attachment. Such as my gun is empty and all I have is a knife can I attach my knife or tomahawk to my weapon (bayonette style) to get longer reach with my weapon melee? or maybe load my 203 launcher with a melee knife and try a range shot? Obviously I lose my knife completely. thoughts?
blackops3,3dlk69,withavengeance,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:52 2015 UTC,I've always wanted the Combat Suppression Knuckles to make an appearance in multiplayer.

Although, some of them take more time to hit like a massive machete.   But you can use a fucking gold golf club which is so fun to challenge yourself with. I tend to do Melee challenges sometimes when I want to try something different, so this would be really fun to include."
blackops3,3dlk69,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:43 2015 UTC,Technically every weapon is a different melee weapon in BO3! :) But I really like your idea of multiple actual melee weapons. I'm not too sure about the swing distance and timing stuff though. I think just different types would be enough with a couple different animations. Melee isn't that big of a thing in the game so they probably wont spend much time on it besides the initial balancing.
blackops3,3dlk69,Retaheki,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be best if they were cosmetic. I play(ed) Combat Arms, and the Dom Pedro sword had a slow ass attack, but it was a one shot with huge ass range. Although it was fun getting the Ninjato and timing it so I don't get sliced."

PC has always had a big shooter audience, but it shrunk greatly when MW2 came out.   The ability to make custom maps and tweak the game to their preference kept the playerbase large and satisfied.   If you didn't like martyrdom, then there would be servers that didn't have it.   If you only wanted to play small maps, there would be servers for it.  Also, servers tend to have tight knit communities. Coming to a server and seeing your friends is awesome."

blackops3,3dor6v,GamingMedicalGuy,6,Sat Jul 18 02:04:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I am a solo player and clan wars is so much bullshit in pub lobbies. It should be in ranked earn your gear for real!
blackops3,3dor6v,BurnTheKrostika,6,Sat Jul 18 03:14:56 2015 UTC,"i hope they do something kinda crazy with league play.. kinda like how mlg/umg has events throughout the week, kinda be hosted into the game itself yennoe what im saying?"
blackops3,3dor6v,GamingMedicalGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 02:05:48 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a pretty good idea. Maybe play for like rare playercards or something.
blackops3,3dor6v,GamingMedicalGuy,3,Sat Jul 18 02:47:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, or have the ladders and stuff tied into the league play.. like have regular league play, and then options for 1v1/2v2/3v3 etc etc."
blackops3,3dor6v,MDRox99,2,Sat Jul 18 03:11:18 2015 UTC,And an in-game live spectator mode to watch a live event/random player match would be really cool. I find it annoying if I want to watch something like Pinkwall play and half the time I have no idea who they're spectating because they jump from person to person so fast.
blackops3,3dor6v,GamingMedicalGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"yeah yeah, i eventually see options if not in bo3, in the future cods being implemented. i mean, bo2 let you live stream to youtube! lol"
blackops3,3dor6v,HaMx_Platypus,2,Sat Jul 18 03:53:00 2015 UTC,I have heard that CSGO has a system for spectators that allows you to control who you want to watch on your own

blackops3,3dor6v,XboxWigger,2,Sat Jul 18 07:38:08 2015 UTC,There should be a separate playlist for Clan War weekends.
blackops3,3dor6v,WickedColdfront,3,Mon Jul 20 22:41:01 2015 UTC,Even though a lot of people hate it including myself you bet it will be returning.  It helps to keep the game populated especially on weekends.
blackops3,3dn4c8,TheReload,3,Fri Jul 17 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"If you have played Black Ops II, you know that the matchmaking automatically filters out DLCs if it can't find good matches with the same DLC packs that you own. So, no need to worry.  But free DLC is just not gonna happen. Not anymore."
blackops3,3dn4c8,RdJokr,2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:08 2015 UTC,There's no way Activision is going to give out the dlc free to all PC players.
blackops3,3dn4c8,blink0818,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:32 2015 UTC,I know because Activision has become way more short term profit minded but making free dlcs for PC is a Win-Win situation for everybody and release a modtool will allow to sell more in mid/long term like CoD4/CoD5.Even today there are a lot of custom zombie maps that are being made and played on Pc and that's why some guys still bought this game in 2015.
blackops3,3dn4c8,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Doubtful, but maybe they will be free or cheaper by the time you buy the game in April?"
blackops3,3dn4c8,DJvic7,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"Lol,I love your optimism but we are talking about Activision.Just take a tour to steam website and see the DLCs and Games price...Even the old CoDs and their dlcs are the same price as day1 which is unbelievable.But in the Other hand,they do adapt their prices for retails version: That's how I bought CoD Ghosts for 15Chf instead of digital 60chf ( bought like 1 year later release ),AW for 33chf instead of digital 60chf (bought more or less 5 months later) and 15chf for Black Ops 2 instead of 60Chf digital (bought 2,5 years later)  The problem with Steam price is that they are completely fucked up and out of reality,even years and years after release...Moreover,their game almost never go in sales.In the otherside,you can buy your bf4 game for 5dollars on Origin when it's on sale and the game is relatively new and bf4 sells a lot on PC,the main platform.And Activision in the Other hand,they have difficulties to sell the game on PC but they think they can permit themselves to sell World at War at 60 dollars on steam or MW2 at 60 dollars with 15$ dlcs each in 2015...I mean,wake up Activision ffs.  I hate Steam,because it is a DRM and because it has brought paid digital possible but if I have to admit that it's a very strong plateform to sell copies with a strong community.this is a sell catalyst.But when you never and never make significant price reduction during sales (or not at all) and when you don't make an official reduction of the game during the year after release and after...I mean,it's completely normal that no-one buys it...And I just don't understand the completely price policy between retail version and digital,really."
blackops3,3dn4c8,SoulTaker669,-5,Sat Jul 18 00:34:11 2015 UTC,You're an idiot for think just cause you're on pc they should give free dlc's to pc players that just plain retarded.

blackops3,3dpoo2,Wiktorjor2001,4,Sat Jul 18 06:42:07 2015 UTC,The uav only shows people who aren't moving and people who don't have ghost perk.
blackops3,3dpoo2,DJvic7,2,Sat Jul 18 06:33:23 2015 UTC,UAV has been a 3-4 kill streak since COD4. Don't fix what ain't broken (like what Ghosts tried to do...SATCOMs blech)
blackops3,3dpoo2,refreshingcoke,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"UAV is necessary in a game where the TTK is so low. It provides a necessary function of giving a general idea of the direction of enemies so that just simply walking around isn't a gamble on whether or not you'll be shot in the back. That and it provides ""balance"" in the sense that people who are really upset by it have to use one of their perk slots/pick 10 points to counter it. Since such an easy counter exists (all you do is equip a perk), there is no reason to complain against it other than the fact that you're upset that you feel you must use one of your points on ghost."
blackops3,3dpoo2,McEgan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:03 2015 UTC,ghost was bad. just leave it as that. the aw was more your speed. it cost 400 for the base version or make it more then a 1000 points for a really good one.   i think it is ok b/c you can shoot it down. knowing that there is one person with a rocket and you know they do not last long.  the last thing is that it shows were you been not were you are now. the lag and that you are moving making it fair.
blackops3,3dpoo2,00wiishow,0,Sat Jul 18 06:34:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm I never thought about the shooting it down part. However when I play, on any COD really (except the latest 2 obviously), I'm the only guy who seems to shoot them down."
blackops3,3dpoo2,mucimau,0,Sat Jul 18 07:08:21 2015 UTC,that sounds like a good idea. but you guys think its a random perk? there are multiple of those cany boxes in the trailer
blackops3,3dpoo2,poppymelt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:58:46 2015 UTC,It was 425 score in black ops 2. That is a 5 KS or 4 Kills 1 assist for TDM and it varies for each gamemode.
blackops3,3dpoo2,G0DatWork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:06:16 2015 UTC,This would be true back in like mw2 but since every player on the game uses ghost these days I think it's fine where it is.  At least point it's more of a way to get the other team to spend a point in pick 10 than an actual killstreaks reward

blackops3,3dmid5,Fat_Cat1991,37,Fri Jul 17 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Personally i hope that last gen dies off, so more people purchase for next gen and the player base is as big as possible and not split up so much."
blackops3,3dmid5,shiznewski,9,Fri Jul 17 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"Not supporting last gen would've made a lot of people jump onboard with next gen too, creating a larger player base. Unfortunate, but I guess there is money to be had."
blackops3,3dmid5,blink0818,5,Fri Jul 17 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"But just because there is still money to be had it doesn't mean they will keep making Call of Duty games for old-gen consoles by outsourcing their development. Next year is probably the last Call of Duty game to come out for last-gen and people should come to peace with this possibility.   When Drift0r made a video on this a month or two ago the 12 year old kiddies couldn't accept the fact that they needed to buy a new console in order to play new-gen focused games. They wanted to rip Drift0r a new one. Most of them probably haven't experienced a generation change before, so they were extremely immature about it as always."
blackops3,3dmid5,JasonDeSanta,-6,Fri Jul 17 20:53:53 2015 UTC,You forget that many people that play on last gen can't buy a next gen console for various reasons
blackops3,3dmid5,Handsome_Claptrap,3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:25 2015 UTC,It's been way too long. There IS NOT an excuse.
blackops3,3dmid5,FR_Leviathan,-4,Fri Jul 17 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"I really want a PS4, but my parents don't want to buy it and i am a student so i don't earn anything. I don't want to sell the PS3 cause i have tons of games that i still play. This is an excuse."
blackops3,3dmid5,Handsome_Claptrap,2,Fri Jul 17 22:36:20 2015 UTC,"$400 + tax. With 10 cent tax, that's $440. There have been ~88 weeks since the Ps4 release, if we assume you also had no clue it was going to exist until the release date somehow. That's also 22 months, for simplicity sake. That means we actually technically just got to the exact point in time where, had you saved $20 a month for this since that time, you just became able to afford it.   If you're a high schooler, plenty of lawns to be mowed. If you're a college student, plenty of places hire part time for students.   I can feel for not wanting to let go of the console, though I keep mine for a different reason. My only thing is that if you can't afford the console, you better not have bought a single game since the Ps4 came out. If you can buy the new CoD title every year, you sure as hell can just save the fucking money over time and get the console."
blackops3,3dmid5,FR_Leviathan,-4,Fri Jul 17 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"I can surely afford a new console, but my parents don't want me to buy it. If i come home with a PS4 my mom will freak out. It could seem stupid considering i am 19, but that's all. However that's not the point. The point is that for various reasons, there are plenty of people that can't buy a new gen console, so don't say last gen should die. It's like saying that PC games should be available only on pro gaming computers that cost over 1000$."
blackops3,3dmid5,Handsome_Claptrap,4,Fri Jul 17 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"Well, a 500$ pc shits on consoles, if you take into account the fact that on top of a console, you NEED a computer in your house, a cheap computer is 2-300$ so you have 800$ for a gaming computer that makes for an amazing work station, and a great computer that will last a long time."

Almost every house has a Wii, PS3, Xbox 360 or a combination of all three.   There is plenty of games and I'm sure A LOT of those last gen consoles still work.  PS4 and Xbox One are selling yes but it won't be anything near what we've seen."
blackops3,3dmid5,EmotiveCDN,8,Fri Jul 17 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"I think Microsoft mentioned that sometime in 2016 is going to be the end date for Xbox 360 online. These companies are not going to be pouring millions of dollars into last gen. technology. I don't care if people stay on the 360, but you can't complain that you're getting an inferior product. You can't expect Microsoft to continue to support the 360 when they're pushing it's competition in the X1.  I understand money is an issue for some people, but if you truly want to play these games then set aside $5 a month or so until you've saved up enough."

blackops3,3dmid5,SenpaiHatesMe,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:41:59 2015 UTC,well didn't treyarch say that they will make it the best game possible on next gen?  the other two studios will sure also try to meke it the best game possible on last gen. they may need to sacreface a lot. but the people on old gen will still be able to enjoy a new game. and i think thats the point in that.
blackops3,3dmid5,mucimau,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"When I say best game possible I mostly mean more people online between 2 consoles instead of 4.

blackops3,3dlbs0,GratefulUser,2,Fri Jul 17 07:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think I've seen a couple on some of the Specialists. I believe one of the campaign characters actually has one, the one that has his gun against the head of the guy in the white shirt in the April 26th Reveal Trailer.  I did some searching and I've found this in the MP Reveal Trailer. It's Seraph's Anihillator's holster. Not sure if it is a drop holster though, as I'm not too knowledgable about that sort of thing, and the revolver holster looks very futuristicy. http://i.imgur.com/eq5QC34.jpg  I think they vanished in AW mostly because thigh-mounted(I'm assuming drop holsters are mostly thigh mounted according to a quick Google Image search) stuff would probably have to go under the Exo, and with the customization of that game, they can't exactly have stuff that overlaps onto the Exo, or something on the Exo that overlaps into the thigh. Black Ops 3, however, doesn't seem to be afraid of that, seeing as how the customization is limited."
blackops3,3dlbs0,GratefulUser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm actually hoping the white bread campaign character is a multiplayer specialist because he looks more Call of Duty to me than some of the others: they remind me of a MOBA version of CoD. While Ruin looks like a badass, he seems more trucker or viking badass than disciplined badass.  Maybe I'm boring, and maybe I'm shallow. But I like my visual customization almost as much as I like picking my loadouts.  Either way, thanks for the screenshot! Always encouraging to see them on one specialist, since that means there might be more. MAYBE they'll go extra fancy this time and show your secondary properly stowed when your primary is out, so others can tell from a distance what nastiness you could pull out if engaged.  I don't have a source screenshot, but in AW there's a stealth mission with Gideon in Detroit (I think.) The one with the hazmats. Gideon actually has a holster attached directly to his exo when he meets up with you. Threw me off, since that's the only time I ever saw a sidearm aside from one directly held or on the Atlas chestrig.  Seems strange we never saw that exo customization in Multiplayer."
blackops3,3dlbs0,mucimau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:46:58 2015 UTC,"That mission is titled Aftermath, I believe. It's after Fission, right? Yeah, I like Gideon's Exo. I believe it also has a machete attached to it, right down the middle of it.  I believe Prophet has a holster on his belt right above his ass, at least, judging from most of the footage I have seen of him from behind. I'll try and get a screenshot of it.  Edit: Got those screenshots. First one is of Prophet's back belt holster, the second one is of Reaper's holster, also a good shot of the Scythe in action. http://i.imgur.com/9fcySqm.jpg http://i.imgur.com/cp0mhgc.jpg"

If they look nothing like how they do stock, then you wouldn't know how to deal with them. They're not a fan of customization systems that allow you to customize such small details, because they feel it doesn't stand out enough, and big chunky customization like full torso, chest, head, helmet, that is very much noticable, and they can balance how much it changes the character so as to not make it look completely different.  Edit: Found another tweet about big chunky choices from Vahn himself: https://mobile.twitter.com/DavidVonderhaar/status/610986609190699008  Edit 2: Oh, you were probably thinking about the Campaign, which will have fully customizable characters."

I predict that a large majority of the BO2 players will move over to BO3 and what players ghost and AW has left will also move over.  http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=Call+of+duty  Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Multiplayer    5,035 + Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Multiplayer    1,793 + Call of Duty: Ghosts - Multiplayer  582 + some new people = somewhere around 10,000 average...

BO2 was much more of fun playing with friends and how organized it was on PC at the end on a level where AW just can't reach it.   I'm exactly really looking forward to playing BO3 on PC if the so rumors of potentional development support on PC are true. Having the ability to, potentional, hosting your own servers are inmense for a call of duty community and is in the end needed to keep the game alive."

blackops3,3dm9ld,XboxWigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"A PC multiplayer game has more requirements by the fans to be successful and most of the time it is a no brainer.      Dedicated Servers  90 degree FOV  uncapped or much higher frame rate   They get this and you can expect the game to last at least a year.  Oh and by the way the reason AW failed completely is the match making was completely broken on PC.  In the beginning you had 30,000 people at peak and no one could find games besides TDM and moshpit for the most part.  That is how the game died it wasn't that it was god awful.  If that match making didn't suck I bet you would have 20,000 peak players each day until Black Ops 3 comes out."

blackops3,3dm9ld,oliman22,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yes it will.   Call of duty is declining on PC and it has dropped a tremendous amount of players each year. Being in direct competition with CS:GO that is a better supported and cheaper shooter is not helping either.   Black ops 3 is not gonna be the last one on PC, but i IW's might be the last. With the production cost involved compared to how little the game sells on PC it can't be good business for Activision anymore to release it on PC.  What they should do is take the chinese ""Call of duty Online"" put a heavy emphasis on cosmetics instead of P2W and release it for a western PC market. It will most likely be a lot of more succesfull."

It will most likely be a lot of more succesfull.   See, this is where i thought they where going with the supply drops in AW. Those seem like they are copy and pasted from crates in CS:GO. (with the exception of elite weapons, the stuff in supply drops are mainly cosmetic). The only thing Activision would need to do is drop the price of CoD to be competitive with CS:GO.  However BO3 is not going to have supply drops, so there went that theory.  I do agree with you, unless they change the business model on PC to be more like CS:GO (ie CoD Online in China), then BO3 will be the last, or second to last CoD on PC."
blackops3,3dm9ld,RdJokr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"You need to keep in mind that CSGO is a multiplayer-only game, and COD has singleplayer, multiplayer and co-op. That alone justifies the $60 price tag.  Plus, CSGO is a Valve game, being sold on Valve's client. It's obvious it would get better support. And, players can make a shit load of money from selling their karambit knifes and whatever the hell there is to sell. COD isn't that kind of game... yet."
blackops3,3dm9ld,oliman22,0,Fri Jul 17 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"Your points are not valid, because i am still correct. Valve and CS:GO has taken a big part of the COD audience each year, and it's because of the business model that Activision has on PC. Less and less people buy COD each year, because there simply are better alternatives on PC. CS:GO being the major hardhitter on the sales."
blackops3,3dm9ld,XboxWigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:25 2015 UTC,This or we started playing on console like I did during Ghosts.  CS:GO is an awesome game I just have no interest in it.  I like the arcadie fast paced action with perks and killstreaks that COD offers more.

blackops3,3dl8q0,Sora26,2,Fri Jul 17 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"Simple to understand? Naw, don't give these developers any ideas. They don't leave numbers out for simplicity, they leave them out to hide Call of Dutys bad netcode, and then program 4-bars to mean higher than usual ping, just so we think were getting a good connection. (sad but true). This is why in the beginning of AW, everyone was on 1 or 2 bar. Then all of a sudden, they introduce ""Connectivity optimizations"". Everyone agreed that the connection stayed the same, and OvenBakedMuffin proved on his YT channel that pings/connection got even WORSE, but magically, everyone was on a 3 or 4 bar after. You see, they alter what it means to be a certain bar (lower the standards to be a 3 or 4 bar), instead of actually fixing the pings to meet universal gaming criteria.   If people actually knew the pings they were playing on, they wouldn't play anymore. Activision, and the studios know that. Showing Ping Numbers would be putting your hand on the table, and my guess is, Call of Duty, as of today, isn't ready for that. We want numbers. They know that. Seriously though, whats so hard to understand about the lower the number, the better?  TLDR; They don't show numbers for a reason, and that reason isn't ""simplicity""."

blackops3,3dl8q0,fatcIemenza,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:35:13 2015 UTC,I think it should be an option. Some may prefer bars because its faster to see who has what connection while some may prefer numbers because of accuracy. If someone doesn't understand numbers then they don't change the setting from bars to numbers. Simple as that.
blackops3,3dl8q0,IthinkitsaDanny,0,Fri Jul 17 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"On PC yeah, on consoles probably not. I guess they think console players are too stupid to understand ping values (not my sentiment, personally I think everyone should have ping numbers)"

blackops3,3dj322,mucimau,13,Thu Jul 16 18:02:11 2015 UTC,I want it too but don't get your hopes up. The last two CODs didn't have 4 player split screen on last or current gen.
blackops3,3dj322,adoafo,10,Thu Jul 16 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Which is pathetic, to be completely honest. If MW3, and BO2 can do it on Old gen, then why the hell can't New gen do it?"
blackops3,3dj322,EvSauce7,9,Thu Jul 16 18:17:34 2015 UTC,X1 and PS4 has enough power to have 4 player split - screen. Its just that 4 player local play has died out since 2012. Its sad but 4 player is not a priority any more.

blackops3,3dj322,falconbox,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"X1 and PS4 has enough power to have 4 player split - screen.    They really don't.  Not at 60fps and 1080p at least.  If they were to give 4-player split screen, it'd probably be 30fps and 1080p, 60fps and 720p, or even 30fps and 720p.  (I believe Borderlands: Handsome Jack Collection does this with split-screen.  It drops it down to 30fps when playing splitscreen.)"

blackops3,3djnow,Playstation_Nation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"I really like these achievements though. A better solution would be to make custom matchmaking settings, i.e. changing priority between Connection/Location, Skill Level, and Communication/Having a mic, so those that want to earn the achievement/trophy can."
blackops3,3djnow,MatrixSez,5,Fri Jul 17 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience, having trophies for a game that require other players are usually problematic and prevent people from being able to get the platinum. I think a better solution would be to put the multiplayer achievements under a separate category(kind of like how the trophies for each DLC are independent of each other) so the game can be platinum'd without the help of  others and the people that want the co op trophies can still get them."
blackops3,3djnow,Playstation_Nation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:21:54 2015 UTC,Edit: I agree with you. Even people only playing offline should be able to platinum the game. But completing easter eggs with friends is really fun and rewarding.
blackops3,3djnow,SlowMotionTurtles,8,Thu Jul 16 21:19:18 2015 UTC,Why should it matter how many people an easter egg is done with? Seems like a stupid trophy/achievement to me.
blackops3,3djnow,RdJokr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"It is a well known fact that not everyone can get good teammates to accomplish the easter eggs in Zombies. Public Match in Zombies is just a disaster, period, because you'll most likely be matched with teammates who either have no idea what they're doing, or just want to kill shit.  This is what I like about Exo Zombies in AW. The easter eggs weren't overly complex, and they were scaled properly so that you can do all of them solo. That said, if you do have a team to do it, it gets really fun."
blackops3,3djnow,poklane,-3,Fri Jul 17 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2 had plenty of achievements that required 4 players in order to complete the achievement. This added a challenge to the achievement, and meant that not everybody could get it. Hence making the trophy more rare, instead of giving it away like many developers tend to do today.   It's supposed to be an ACHIEVEMENT(in-game, not talking real life achievement here). In my honest opinion, these trophies are actually more rewarding earned with friends, but I'm not saying solo players should be excluded. So here is hoping for all zombie trophies to be completable  alone, but given Treyarch's history they've had many trophies that required 4 players and it excluded solo players from earning them."

blackops3,3djtfy,theirv15,5,Thu Jul 16 23:55:35 2015 UTC,I'd rather that in TDM each kill was worth 125 points. That way there's a bigger incentive for playing the one objective. And with the new movement there's less camping overall.
blackops3,3djtfy,GoBlueGriff,2,Fri Jul 17 00:00:31 2015 UTC,Oh there will still be plenty of camping brother
blackops3,3djtfy,KindOfOk,10,Fri Jul 17 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"69.....teeheehee  Nice idea, but that would encourage camping at the end of the game to reserve your life, instead of rushing to get more kills at the end. I prefer not having another reason for people to camp and slow the game down."
blackops3,3djtfy,G0DatWork,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:11 2015 UTC,Yeah they might camp but if they have 6 guys running in on them it would still be fun.
blackops3,3djtfy,invudontseeme,3,Fri Jul 17 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"I prefer the slower game modes so that's why this is appealing me. Also to clarify, only the team losing would go into one life. The others would still have to get pushed to 69 before going one life."
blackops3,3djtfy,iOrbiTzz,6,Thu Jul 16 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's absolutely amazing and NEEDS to happen. Like, even if the score limit is still 75 kills, but afterwards you need to ""finish off"" the team before winning. That way, in a close game, it gives the best players a chance to bring their team back. This can take some games into a ""sudden death"", which would be absolutely epic.   Some people are commenting that it would encourage camping to reserve your life. GOOD! I'm not a fan of camping or campers in general, but when the score is 71 to 71 (for example), and my idiot teammates are still running out into gunfire, I want to rip my hair out! When a game is that close, every death matters. I hope my team would camp in the back and let me finish off those last few kills.  Anyway, amazing idea, dude. I hope Treyarch is reading."
blackops3,3djtfy,mlittle,2,Fri Jul 17 02:50:59 2015 UTC,"But TDM is, at its core, what team can get more kills. This may be cool as a separate game mode, but TDM is just a fun quick game of kill the other team."
blackops3,3djtfy,Darthownz,2,Fri Jul 17 00:05:22 2015 UTC,I agree it seems better as a variant. Like S&D to S&R. Good thought
blackops3,3djtfy,TotallySnappy,2,Fri Jul 17 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We don't need to reinvent anything...we need to go back to the basics, the last couple of cods are a testament to that"
blackops3,3djtfy,GratefulUser,2,Fri Jul 17 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of gears of war 3. You have spawn tickets rather then kills, when their is 5 tickets left for your team respawns are disabled"
blackops3,3djtfy,PhilHolz,2,Fri Jul 17 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"That'd slow the pace of the endgame right down to S&D territory. More risk, less movement. People will die, not be able to respawn and just leave.   TDM is the biggest, most casual mode. There's nothing wrong with that. Score per kill and score limits are something we should be talking about.   Furthermore, how about team MVP awards? Or a ""higher than average"" bonus? At the end of each match, the average score, kills, whatever of your team is calculated and from that you are given bonus XP dependent on your performance."
blackops3,3djtfy,oTc_DragonZ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:33:26 2015 UTC,You're right. That's why I was agreeing with someone else it'd be better as a variant game mode
blackops3,3djtfy,Jhamham,2,Fri Jul 17 11:43:33 2015 UTC,I'd just be content with corner camping for more than two minutes making your character spontaneously combust.
blackops3,3djtfy,mucimau,2,Fri Jul 17 11:30:22 2015 UTC,"Although, I think your idea is cool, I think it'd slow the game down.  Why not just make another game mode that was 5 minutes long, and at the 5 minute mark, you get one life left.  Only thing in my opinion that needs to change in TDM is 75 kill game length to 100 kill game length and change each kill from 100 points to 125 points."
blackops3,3djtfy,mucimau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:37:53 2015 UTC,"This is just to change up the end-game and bring back some responsibility to the better players. With your idea, you could dominate the five mins, and then have no chance of losing during the one life part."
blackops3,3djtfy,mucimau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have it like Cranked at 69 kills, but with one life like you said (to discourage camping at the end)."

blackops3,3djtfy,refreshingcoke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"If your team has 69 kils, the other team only has one life left. Like instead of finishing normally it turns into wiping out the team one last time"

blackops3,3djchu,CodeRed1234,9,Thu Jul 16 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"I use Tactical, but I'm surprised there isn't that option. I had no idea. To be fair, if someone invests $150+ on a controller, they should have at least a slight advantage over you. Same reason people that invest in a solid headset should gain an advantage over those without one. That's how the world works. It shouldn't be a massive gap, but it should exist. Just like any prop player in any sport will spend more money on better gear to gain an advantage."
blackops3,3djchu,KindOfOk,-5,Thu Jul 16 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"I guess, but if activition and treyarch really have that mindset about their product, where whoever spends the most money is the best, then i think it's time for me to find a new game"
blackops3,3djchu,KindOfOk,7,Thu Jul 16 19:22:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's their mindset at all. But they do want to push CoD as a serious eSport, and to do so, companies will offer higher end equipment to players. It doesn't provide a massive advantage, but it does a small one. It's comparable to any sport. You can't just buy a ball and play competitively. You need all the extra equipment."
blackops3,3djchu,_lukey___,3,Thu Jul 16 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"It's not even Treyarch or Activision, it's just how gaming works, just like any other activity/hobby/sport, people are going to spend money to get an advantage"

blackops3,3dl8kt,KindOfOk,3,Fri Jul 17 08:35:41 2015 UTC,Mob of the Dead is in a 'self-contained bubble of time'. Not to be confused with a different timeline/universe/dimension.

I know what all of those things are and I stay sharp as a tack when working overnights. Good on you for providing this info. So thank you.  For those that want  to stay up all night I would suggest a solid ungreasy meal, caffiene pills, water and many breaks. Please, not daily."
blackops3,3diljn,Obamasmanpurse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:30:11 2015 UTC,"Energy drinks and coffee do me just fine. So does Adderall if i'm so inclined. I'm not new at the midnight release thing, though I appreciate you supporting your favorite ""gamer fuel."" It contains many of the same ingredients as energy drinks, the most important being caffeine. And sure, it has the ""healthy"" bits in there too, but I already eat healthy 99% of the time, and I'm very aware of what I put into my body. I use the midnight release as a rare excuse to binge on garbage that tastes good. And as long as I keep drinking energy drinks and coffee, I won't crash. Also, like I said, Adderall is a miracle drug.  EDIT: I didn't mean for that to sound overly aggressive, and I apologize if it read that way. I just have my specific rituals I enjoy, and have a severe distaste for most energy boosters in general (for daily use). Healthy eating and proper sleep gives you all the energy you need to function properly."

Pre-AW, everyone wanted something new and different. Now those same people want to revert back to WW2. A large portion of this community is extremely fickle. This type of thread is cemented in ignorance, by people who have memories equal to a goldfish. BO3 has been in development for years. They can't completely switch paths after two years of building this game."
blackops3,3dn4mr,KindOfOk,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"I think that's what a lot of people don't understand. These companies were already working on their games when AW was released. Granted they're able to add to it and refine it, but the generally concept is already established.   I think SHG will have the next opportunity to change the direction of CoD, but I have to assume we will see AW2. 3arc might be the most realistic opportunity for a change away from futuristic to WW1/2 style. So we're talking 3-4 years before we see a change unless IW surprises me/us and anticipated a need to change directions."
blackops3,3dn4mr,S_cute,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. The next title is already well under development, so unless they pre-planned a WW2 game, it'll be Ghosts 2 or whatever they decided.

blackops3,3dn4mr,falconbox,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"You might be in favour of it, but you are definitely in the minority. No one else wants less options, less choices, less customisation.

blackops3,3dn4mr,Ludbunta,0,Fri Jul 17 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"And where does that direction eventually go?  At a certain point there has to be an end.   Are we going to be going into the year 3000 with laser rifles and spaceships?    No one else wants...   Except for the people who prefer gun-skill (including all the pro-players), which is why most of the killstreaks and perks (and even some attachments) are turned off by default in league play.  I guess I just preferred CoD when it was more realistic.  After playing every CoD since CoD2, the last few years have caused me to trade in the game within a month and basically just stick to Battlefield.  This fall, it looks like it may just be Rainbow Six Siege for me."
blackops3,3dn4mr,falconbox,2,Sat Jul 18 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"I take back saying no one else wants it, stupid statement but it's late here lol, what I'm trying to say is it caters to the majority, which is what call of duty as a whole is trying to do, at the end of the day it's still a casual shooter aimed at casual gamer, and to them gun skill isn't important, having fun is, and more options & choices is usually more fun. Not to mention these killstreaks, attachments etc make it easier for a casual player, again making it more fun.

Obviously if BO3 is received well they are likely to stick to the futuristic theme rather than go against what they know is popular.  However if it fails, then it'll still be too late for IWs next game or even SHGs next game to change course and go back to WW2 (presuming they're both planning for future games already.  This means that basically, I don't think we'll see a WW2 game until atleast Treyarch's next game after BO3, or probably even further away than that."

blackops3,3depv5,Yasillydumb,18,Wed Jul 15 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"You're most likely wrong about the Origins crew and Samantha. The characters in Origins are completely different than the original four and are brought together in this timeline earlier than they were before because of the time travel that 115 has and it through things through out history and dimensions.   In another dimension/timeline 115 is found during WW1 and Takeo, Nikolai, and Dempsey are sent to Origins to find out what the Germans are doing. This is also a timeline where Maxis does not have a daughter.   Samantha had been sent to this dimension/timeline after Richtofen took her place and so she is now trying to control it. To do this she needed to get the help of the 4 to help her make a gateway to Agartha to get her father and the 4 to her. They needed to fight off the one who was controlling the Zombies within the Crazy Place/The Underground tunnel.  Once this was achieved Samantha created this alternate dimension which is shown at the end of the Origins EE but she can't change what ends up happening every single time (Richtofen taking over the earth.)   She then uses her powers to allow the 4 heroes from Origins to use time travel (since they're now in Agartha) to help break the cycle which is what happens in the Giant."

blackops3,3depv5,SatyrW,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Dr. Gersch worked pretty closely with Dr. Shuster and Dr. Groph on the moon. (Richtofen but Groph in charge on Griffin Station.)  He also worked a lot in Eagle's Nest, and when Samantha took power she trapped him and tortured him (Eagle's Nest is basically Richtofen's HQ, also where Ascension takes place.)  As for Brock and Gary (hehe, pokemon), if you didn't already play the Easter Egg in Shangri-La, they are two British fellows (supposedly explorer and assistant/sidekick) who come to Shangri-La to explore and shit, but when they enter the Pyramid they get trapped and die.  When the gang arrives at Shangri-La, they get there after Brock and Gary have already perished but travel to the past to try and help them, believing they in return can help the gang.  However, when they travel in the past, despite saving them from or predicament, they wind up in another and die again. They go back to the future and then back to the past again to prevent them from dying again.  This process repeats itself many many times over (making this one of the most complex and tedious EE in all of Zombies, hell, even Moon is simpler and takes less time).  After they finally get to the main room they find a plaque with Richtofen's name on it, and then get teleported away, and we never hear from them again.  They don't really have any ties to 935, Richtofen, Maxis or anyone or anything else in the rest of the Zombies universe, much like the actors in Call of The Dead. They really just serve as side characters who (sort-of not really) advance the plot.  That's pretty much it... Actually if you think about it, Richtofen and his gang are time-traveling super heroes, saving those in need. (Ascension and Shangri-La)  And then there's Call of The Dead where they are the ones who need saving (getting trapped in the Silo, needing the Actors to do stuff to help them).  Honesty, Richtofen follows 935s motto (Bettering the Human condition) way more than Maxis does. In fact, Maxis is quite the opposite.  Despite being bat-shit crazy and sometimes evil, Richtofen is a pretty good dude while Maxis is the bad guy."

blackops3,3depv5,falconbox,2,Thu Jul 16 04:42:25 2015 UTC,"I kind of looked at it like, Samantha, full-knowing they're in a time loop and being in Argatha (or was it the Aether?) at the end of buried (or sometime before)  she goes back in time to 1914 where she proceeds to let our heroes meet and guide them to breaking the cycle(originally introduced in Mob of the Dead, although now that I think about it that might be why Mob of the Dead was created, to show the concept of breaking a cycle). When she broke the cycle in Origins, that meant that the contents of World and War, Black Ops 1 & 2 didn't happen, but because they didn't happen, Samantha would have never gone back to create the Origins timeline meaning that they were still in an infinite loop. The heroes, with the 'knowledge of everything' that Samantha granted them at the end of Origins, realised that it was an infinite loop and using their new powers, they went back(or forward depending how you look at it) in time to just after Richtofen had locked Ludvig Maxis and Samantha Maxis in the teleporter with Fluffy, then after they've teleported the Origins crew approached Richtofen and told him of the danger he faces. Richtofen (of course) doesn't listen and tries to open the teleporter but instead of opening it to escape with the test subjects, he wants to escape with only himself(I'm not too sure about that part or why he opened the teleporter actually). So when he opens the teleporter he finds the Origins Richtofen who then, in turn shoots him in the face and then I honestly have no idea how The Giant is going to play out. Wow I envy, your ability to type so much. My fingers are already hurting :):) Just like the last one, good job and keep up the good work!"

blackops3,3dgf6t,fatcIemenza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:05:39 2015 UTC,yeah that seems to make sense.
blackops3,3dgf6t,xDave9teen,2,Thu Jul 16 15:30:21 2015 UTC,It depends on how fast the game plays. If its closer to BO2 (which it seems) then 75

blackops3,3dgf6t,Goaliedude3919,2,Thu Jul 16 12:26:59 2015 UTC,NO!!!!! 75 works best. It keeps the games short and sweet. It prevents people trying to be 25/30 Point streak masters and it's sweeter when you get a DNA/K.E.M/MOAB/NUKE in that 75 point sphere.   100 point TDM matches on AW sometimes take way to long and people tend to quit more often because the game takes so long.

blackops3,3dkblu,MeepsG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"Could lead to some unfair snowballing, also could lead to an average team getting lucky with wins and climbing the ranks too quickly, so they get godstomped every game they play until their w/l is back down.   Still, could definitely work with some tweaking."

In fact,everything that could have been different looking in FPS view is not customisable but anything else that you can't see in FPS view is customisable...C'mon treyarch,this is really big lazy work here,I was expecting at least as good as AW,especially with a such big cod studio.Skin Customisation on this state is pretty useless."

blackops3,3djur2,SoulTaker669,11,Thu Jul 16 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"This guy is an idiot. Just because it can be ported doesn't mean it isn't next gen. They've clearly stated the games will be largely different from each other, and for players not to expect the same experience. The 360/PS3 port will be a much different experience. Hell, even AW plays different on next gen than current gen.   Also, no devs are tapping into the full next gen power yet. It takes years for them to do that. It wasn't until the final years of the old gen console that they were getting everything out of it. They probably held the last gen announcement to try and nudge people to next gen consoles. It's time players make the move, so they are working as a catalyst for that shift, which is perfectly fine.   He is one of the people who thinks everything is a conspiracy about making money. He doesn't even understand how evolution of game engines work. The CoD engine used originally is vastly different from the one today. He uses Cryengine as an example of ""a completely new engine."" Bitch please. It's a heavily modified version of the earlier engine, like Quake is for CoD. And he assumes CoD needs a new engine. Why? The movement and physics are perfect. We don't needs intensive intimate detailed graphics, because that takes away power from computing other stuff.   He also acts like we just buy the game blindly. Hey buddy, did you hear? They are releasing a beta. This means they have confidence in their game. And when 700,000 people play they beta, they will buy the game a few months later. They put their money where their mouth is.   I don't know why this guy is so butthurt about CoD, but maybe he should consider PLAYING A DIFFERENT FUCKING GAME. But he won't, because CoD gets views, and he wants money, so he's a view whore. He knows hating on CoD and acting like a righteous savior for FPS games gets the fanboys riled up, so he does it to drive traffic. It's a smart business move, but it's completely transparent."

I dare you to find me those exact quotes from a Treyarch employee or Activision. You sound like a butthurt current gen owner who is mad over the game going to last gen, so you're doing what many people on here have done and CONVINCING yourself that it will be a COMPLETELY different game on last gen. The more likely scenario is that this game isn't ground breaking, it isn't pushing current gen hardware limits, it's not large in scale compared to open world games like Skyrim or something, it's Call of Duty and it's on the same modified engine. That means it runs on old gen and the last gen port will have less pretty graphics and intricate visual detailing, but essentially the same gameplay. It's as he said, with them charging full price and making the announcement of only 2 player co-op campaign and no gunsmith on last gen, chances are those are the ""largest"" features to be missing otherwise any MAJOR differences would have been announced before they put it out for sale. Also they know if they axe big gameplay features like multiplayer maps, zombie maps, dlc maps, basic movement functionality, etc.... then people just wont buy the game and porting backwards wont be worth their time or money.  ""He is one of the people who thinks everything is a conspiracy about making money""  Let me help you with that. There is no CONSPIRACY about making money. For a company the bottom line is, IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY PERIOD. You're insane if you believe they give one ounce of a shit about you or any other CoD player.  The guy doesn't sound butt hurt about CoD to me. He's presenting another side of the equation that may be controversial for some butt hurt fan boys to listen to and accept. You can be upset all you want, but the truth hurts. I like how you say ""he wants money."" WAIT A MINUTE I THOUGHT WE DIDN'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS A CONSPIRACY ABOUT MAKING MONEY???!!!! LMAO, you want a view whore go watch the guys who circle jerk CoD every year and don't attempt to challenge Activision / The various devs and call them on some of their BS. He's trying to help wake up the community and give them another side of the argument. Get over it if you don't like people criticizing BO3 / Treyarch. You're a part of the problem, because you try to silence and dismiss criticism."
blackops3,3djur2,Lost_C0z,4,Thu Jul 16 22:58:41 2015 UTC,"While this was a really well done point you made, what can Call of Duty games really do to ""push the limits of current gen hardware""? I'm truly just curious why people compare the size and scope of an rpg like The Witcher 3 to a multiplayer driven FPS in Call of Duty, because what can be done to make the CoD ""truly next gen""? Make more campaign levels, bigger zombie maps? I really am just wondering what could be added to CoD to make it a next gen experience that would make sense for a CoD game."
blackops3,3djur2,CProceedingz,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:13 2015 UTC,"They are doing all they can. You have to remember, this dev cycle began three years ago. Xbones/PS4's had just come out when Ghosts was released. game development is a very long and arduous process, which many people don't understand.   You are completely correct in not comparing games. It's apples to oranges. They have done what they felt could be done this year to take advantage of next gen hardware. Bigger campaign that supports 4 people with a completely different structure. They've already told us Shadows of Evil is larger in both size and content than Tranzit. They've also included progression systems in both campaign and zombies. The devs are stretching their legs here. Most people seem to equate ""next gen"" with sprawling open worlds and detailed realistic graphics. CoD doesn't need that. Plus, if all that crap was in multiplayer, it would leech processing power used to keep the game running smooth."
blackops3,3djur2,KindOfOk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"So you don't think that design concessions have to be made to current gen (next gen as people are calling it) in order to successfully port the models back to support the previous gen hardware?  Do you think that these studios they contract out effectively build a completely separate game?  Do you think they rewrite the physics or shading engines and behaviors?  Scale down the polygons and other artwork by effectively making two separate copies of each object?  Is there a slight chance that the design pillars for the primary studio are, make sure that this game can also run on previous gen hardware smoothly.  Because he does have a wealth of games he can point to that have suffered on current gen for this very reason, destiny is a perfect example of a game that had to ""dumb"" down its design in order to be backwards compatible effectively.  Business and logistics and other excuses asside, he does have a quality point and backs up his hypothesis at great length with facts, hyperbole and some other interesting angles.  Games that have to be effectively backward compatible will need to make some design concessions to accommodate this, to varying degrees of course, and it is to the detriment of the current gen games."
blackops3,3djur2,zen_master87,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"I think when people think ""truly next gen"" they think there should be some kind of upgrade in the mechanics or gameplay. He points out in his video that other games actually see a change in game play Battlefield being able to play 64 players.   I am not saying COD should try and get 64 players on Nuketown (which the engine probably can't handle), but it is a difference that DICE has been able to actually implement on current gen. Whereas COD has not changed the actual gameplay. Everything that we can do on current gen we can do on last gen."
blackops3,3djur2,msc49,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"""Not to expect the same experience"" sounds like a synonym for ""different"" to me. I still own and play my 360 regularly. Haven't even bothered to buy an Xbox One yet.   If you truly believe Activision and it's subsidiaries are all about $$$ and don't care about the consumer, I pity you, because you have such a pessimistic and jaded view of the industry. When you watch Vonderhaar talk about CoD, you see genuine passion in him. Also, if you feel this way, just vote with your wallet. Guarantee you this Youtuber, and all his subs, will buy BO3, despite everything he says against it. I'm tired of people in the CoD community vomiting out this anti-Activision bullshit, then buying the game every year. Props to you if you actually stand up for what you believe and don't buy the game.  I'm not trying to silence him. I'm refuting his arguments, which is what people do when they disagree. And I was pointing out the unbelievable irony with him and how he earns money, which obviously flew directly over your head. Also, I'm far from upset about it. He has his opinion, and I have mine. I'm going to buy, play, and enjoy BO3. I love CoD and have been playing it for a very long time, and I'm completely happy with it. I laugh at you people who think CoD is a ""bad game."" You fools have no idea what a bad game is. I remember going into stores as a child and buying games for my NES, hoping they were decent quality. There were games you couldn't even finish due to how buggy they were. THAT is a bad game."

The next part is you will need to provide proof that they've said The Giant bonus DLC zombies map is current gen only.   The only announcement they made about features being different so far is last gen will not have 4 player co-op campaign and it will not have the gunsmith feature. I don't recall any official announcements about DLC as of yet, but they'd probably make that known before having put the game out for pre order.  If you can't provide a source for your claims above, apologize and say you talked out of your ass like the other angry current gen people. HEY, one of the first classics was when you guys said this game is DEFINITELY NOT coming to last gen at all! LMAO you guys need to knock this shit off with making bullshit statements based on how you'd LIKE thing to be vs how they ACTUALLY ARE. You look ridiculously desperate and like a whiny 5 year old when you make claims about the last gen version that HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED."

What is different from a last gen game to the current gen? You've got improved graphics, features and other advances behind the scenes which weren't possible on the older hardware but at the same time it's possible to play these ""next gen"" games on PC hardware that is pretty damn old.  I think people get too caught up on them moving to a new engine which isn't that common in the industry and most ""new"" engines are upgrades and re-workings of previously existing engines."

blackops3,3djur2,falconbox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:54 2015 UTC,Even though I agree that there is a good chance that in some ways there might be sacrifices to make it run better on older hardware there is still the cynical part of me that thinks we wouldn't get a game all that different from what we're currently getting. I think a lot of people tend to think too focusing on the current gen hardware would introduce so much more to the game but I'm not entirely sure it will.  Either way it's pretty disappointing.
blackops3,3djur2,Yoatzinn,0,Fri Jul 17 01:31:32 2015 UTC,I don't think a bigger game equals a better game at all
blackops3,3djur2,burnzrox,0,Thu Jul 16 22:38:32 2015 UTC,"It's not simply ""bigger"". When last gen has to be kept in mind that means smaller, less busy maps with lots of cut corners(see: empty vehicles in AW campaign) and a lack of detail. For a truly ""next-gen""(current gen) experience they shouldn't have to account for these types of things at all and focus on utilizing the full power of the new hardware.   No matter what the PR machine tells you the current gen version will always be held back in some (manufactured or not) capacity due to limitations of being developed with older hardware in mind and that's not really something you can dispute."

Ostracizing a significant portion of your community.    As for console wars, while childish and wrong, it is the nature of the beast with this game series especially. Thsee wars are also one of the inherent side effects of a game series opting to preference one console over the other."

blackops3,3de86d,Brandalf_,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:31:10 2015 UTC,If flak jacket exists then danger close should exist in some for for proper balance. It's the equivalent of having juggernaut without stopping power.

blackops3,3de86d,Xeilith,2,Wed Jul 15 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't mind it since Ghosts and AW had it along with FJ equivalents and it never really affected anything substantial   Ya, I mean all Danger Close really does is counter the effects of flak jacket making explosives useful against flak jacket users. Without some sort of counter to flak jacket it renders explosive equipment much less useful in objective modes where flak jacketi s prevalent and makes it much harder for a player to justify spending create-a-class points on them when they could spend that extra point on something that is going to be more beneficial.   I know a lot of people would complain about it since C4 got a buff, and proximity triggered explosives are back.   People will complain about anything that gets them killed(directly or indirectly), the question is are their complaints valid or justified? People complained about juggernaut in COD4 so it was removed in MW2 which meant nearly everybody and their brother used stopping power in their second perk slot since there was no real counter to the increased damage; effectively making the TTK of the game quicker.   Grenades are a much smaller piece of the puzzle, so the impact is smaller in practice. It's still the same concept, just on a much smaller scale. I don't think it's a huge deal one way or the other, but I still think it's worth pointing out."

blackops3,3difly,KindOfOk,7,Thu Jul 16 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"This. WaW had huge map design, which gave room for tanks. No other CoD has designed maps like that. Of course, I don't think they really fit with CoD's playstyle, anyway. You could see the momentum shift in WaW with tank maps. They just don't belong. That's why vehicular warfare suits Battlefield much better."
blackops3,3difly,mucimau,3,Thu Jul 16 15:18:45 2015 UTC,yes. battlefield has huge maps. and if somebody is in a building you can simply shoot them and break down the whole house... that's not possible in call of duty.

That and tanks wouldn't really go well with the maps unless we can destroy certain parts of it or most of it, and right now I highly doubt that will happen. I mean in Advanced Warfare even the Goliath couldn't get into certain places on maps because it was to big, and so imagine tanks.

""Anyone can have one so its ok"" is such an elementary argument for everything. Basically there is a free disruptive, killstreak you have to deal with all the time. That's why it's wrong. CoD is about fast-paced, blockbuster gun on gun action, not which douchebag waited around for the tank to respawn to sit in it the whole game."
blackops3,3difly,Wiktorjor2001,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Let's look at Titanfall. It has a 3 tier playing field.   Grunts/Spectres < Pilots < Titans  When handled well, such as in Titanfall, Titans are a counterable force and maps are built up in layers to accommodate for each type of player. Thing about Titanfall is people stopped playing as the Titans (before they stopped playing completely).  Why? It was a massive contrast to the pacing and flow of pilot movement and gunplay. That's before throwing in the vulnerability against AT weapons and faster moving enemies. People didn't like being stuck in a slow tin can. It just didn't fit well with the rest of the game. Similarly I don't think it would work well with another CoD game."

blackops3,3difly,Allegiance10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"They break up the flow of the game way too much. In Battlefield, you have launchers as a gadget, along with c4 and a ton of other things, not a secondary. Also the maps are much bigger and fit tank combat. There is also lots of other vehicles to destroy the tanks. In call of duty, everyone who isn't in a tank gets a piece of that tank. Lots of time you will also have bad drivers, which can really change the outcome of the game for your team, more than if they were on the ground (because they aren't hogging a vehicle that could be useful). Once again, in battlefield there are generally more than 1 tank per team, unless it's a CQC map, where they can be destroyed by infantry a lot easier."

blackops3,3dc1c7,LackingAGoodName,-13,Wed Jul 15 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"You could have also cut 70% of this out and left the important stuff.  So much of this is ancillary and not needed.  I mean, shit, I was able to sum up the main points of the first two Witcher games in a smaller post.  And Witcher has WAY more content than Zombies.    It's all about knowing what is essential, and what can be left out."
blackops3,3dc1c7,WutUtalkingBoutWill,12,Wed Jul 15 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I feel with how much Treyarch put into it in the first place, much of it still should be brought up if you're gonna tell its story, in full or simplified.  I'm curious though, what specific details do you find unnecessary?"
blackops3,3dc1c7,_lukey___,6,Wed Jul 15 03:43:46 2015 UTC,It was either this or a four hour video I had to watch
blackops3,3dc1c7,rhcp88,2,Wed Jul 15 03:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'm halfway through that, surprisingly well done actually. Although I am taking what it says with a grain of salt because I think they tend to take liberties when there are gaps in the story"
blackops3,3dc1c7,SneaKyGamErr,18,Wed Jul 15 13:19:41 2015 UTC,I absolutely love that THIS is the simplified version. Just shows how much Treyarch really cares about zombies
blackops3,3dc1c7,LackingAGoodName,8,Wed Jul 15 18:11:26 2015 UTC,Haha there's still so much i left out. They put sooo much into Zombies.   They're even gonna have a wiki type page in Black Ops 3!
blackops3,3dc1c7,the_V0RT3X,3,Wed Jul 15 02:47:11 2015 UTC,"I believe that Wiki was only confirmed for the Campaign though, no word on if it'll feature zombies content or not."

blackops3,3dc1c7,BL1TZJAEG3R,2,Wed Jul 15 10:03:22 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome! I saw that one of the main/great sources for learning the lore was via a 4 hour video (or the wiki), and knew ""how many people are gonna sit down and watch/read this?"" (Although I did watch the video and its really great. Really easy to listen to it if you're ever on a long car ride or on a flight.)  I also thought how amazing of a story Treyarch has told in Zombies and wanted to help more people understand it better, also hoping maybe people will be inspired to go catch up more after these posts."
blackops3,3dc1c7,a2kSD,5,Wed Jul 15 04:26:05 2015 UTC,Just read all of it and its super awesome! Please keep adding parts untill you finished the whole story because i love reading this dude!   Much respect!

blackops3,3dc1c7,CODMuffinMan,4,Wed Jul 15 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"She sure does! Strips him of his power and basically becomes him.  Now, it is possible though, that by the will of The Vril or Satan himself he purposefully gave up his power only to lurk in the shadows, possibly returning at a later time.  Or maybe Satan enjoys Samantha's company and they are one being?  It's up in the air and speculation and theories are welcome, but it went down like this:  -Satan controls the Zombies -Samantha enters the MPD(Pyramid on the moon) which is of Vril origin -Satan is believed to be tied to the Vril -Some Mumbo Magic later -Samantha controls the Zombies"
blackops3,3dc1c7,PoLVieT,9,Wed Jul 15 10:38:37 2015 UTC,"First off, it's Richtofen, not Richthofen.  And second, I don't believe that Richtofen planted false memories in Dempsey, Takeo and Nikolai. The fact that they lost their old memories was a side effect of the 115 experiment."
blackops3,3dc1c7,Taperingbird0,4,Wed Jul 15 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"I thought it was Richtofen too, but my phone auto corrected me so I just assumed my phone knew German better than I do.  While this could be possible, Takeo explicitly states how he remembers what Richtofen did to them and is shocked that Dempsey and Nikolai don't remember. Even swears vengeance. So it's likely Richtofen brainwashed them, but it hasn't really been stated as concrete.  That's the cool thing about Zombies, it doesn't shove facts in your face, it lets the players discover and speculate on everything themselves."
blackops3,3dc1c7,DrazV2,2,Wed Jul 15 02:49:14 2015 UTC,Is it possible Takeo is infected by the true evil and that's why he can remember the experiments? In Origins isn't he the only one that can see certain steps in the easteregg using Zombie Blood?
blackops3,3dc1c7,IAMA_Helix_Fossil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, you mean the Ancient Evil? The Ancient Evil is basically the Richtofen/Samantha before Richtofen and Samantha.  He is who other cultures refer to as Satan, Lucifer, The Devil, and many other names  Origins is when I get a little fuzzy, having not played it in much extent, but it's fair to say the Ancient Evil may have still been around during the events of Origins.  However, the Ancient Evil did not control the zombies during Takeo, Dempsey, Nikolai and Richtofen's travels, so it's doubtful that he influenced Takeo's memories.  Interesting theory though! I'll have to look more into it :)"
blackops3,3dc1c7,IAMA_Helix_Fossil,2,Wed Jul 15 14:42:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your original write-up and reply! Follow up question if you will,   However, the Ancient Evil did not control the zombies during Takeo, Dempsey, Nikolai and Richtofen's travels, so it's doubtful that he influenced Takeo's memories.   Having no control of his minions and losing to a mortal little girl, would that explain the Ancient Evil's intentions to gaining back control of the zombies and exacting revenge on humans trying to be demons?  Understand that I understand you're not an authority on this matter, but I really like talking to people of all the possibilities this lore can take then see treyarch STILL manage to blow our minds."
blackops3,3dc1c7,IAMA_Helix_Fossil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"It very well could be! In fact, it could've been willed by The Vril or Satan himself that he would lose, when he really just lurks in the shadows, all as a part of a bigger plan.  That would be really interesting to see!"

They will have it ready and waiting for you at midnight. Only online orders run the risk of a post day one delivery, but even then, they usually arrive on time. Don't worry about it, and congrats on managing to get one!"
blackops3,3dgmvw,CorporalColonel,2,Thu Jul 16 03:50:31 2015 UTC,Question. Do GameStops usually have another extra at stock to sell on release night?
blackops3,3dgmvw,LifeHated,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:24:09 2015 UTC,"No, not with a game like this. Each store is given an allotment for each system, once they hit that number they don't get anymore. Gamestop might give some stores extra but they will be like the first allotment and go to pre-orders. You're only chance of getting it after release without a pre-order is if someone either cancels their pre-order, or they don't pick it up within 48 hours."
blackops3,3dgmvw,CorporalColonel,0,Thu Jul 16 17:52:32 2015 UTC,well i know for a fact amazon ships so you have it a day or 2 before launch even with the special edition

blackops3,3df73l,FuXs-,11,Wed Jul 15 20:28:23 2015 UTC,it was silly to think that the amount of pre-orders would effect the quality or content of a game anyway.  Like if nobody preordered AW somehow magically it would have been better? nah

blackops3,3df73l,The_Shreckoning,2,Wed Jul 15 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"There were/is a lot of people against the anit-preorder group (myself included), we just made less noise than the people against pre-ordering.  I know Drift0r is going against his norm for the beta, but I'm pretty sure he's going to do the whole ""cancel after I get my code"" thing.  Kind of weird that Treyarch wouldn't just give him a code though, seeing as they were willing to give him a PS4 and they invite him to play."
blackops3,3df73l,tyzenberg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"I usually don't pre-order most games since I don't care about extra content, but if I do have the urge to pre-order I tend to wait until about a week prior to release to get as much information as possible and still guarantee a copy. I'll end up pre-ordering BO3 in that fashion, but simply because I've always enjoyed every Treyarch COD over the other developers. I know preference is subjective, but since there's a track record of my enjoying the games released by this studio, I have less qualms about pre-ordering the game. Next year's iteration is a different story, and I'll likely wait until after release to see what the reception is like on community forums (since a lot of reviewers tend to have glowing reviews of COD regardless of its issues)."

Also done it with Battlefield, Halo, and so much more.  Hell, I would put down 3 pre-orders for all 3 platforms (PS4, XB1, PC) then just cancel them all. Lots of free stuff.  Take advantage of it while you can!"
blackops3,3df73l,LifeHated,0,Wed Jul 15 21:44:39 2015 UTC,I pre-ordered it and then canceled the pre-order once I got my beta code. I'm sure a lot of people did the same
blackops3,3df73l,bodnast,0,Wed Jul 15 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"People never stopped doing pre orders because of wanting to guarantee a special edition, pre order bonus, or in this case the beta. And theoretically a beta should fix the little things people will complain about. But from what I have heard even when developers have a date they still have quota of money they can use on the game so date will not really matter because thats why some things are taken out of a game and its usually money.   Edit 1 - Also I don't think a preorder actually changes anything about the game being made or not being made. Think about the times before pre orders were a thing."

blackops3,3ddxxv,fatcIemenza,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"Ninja helped, but it was still countered by Sitrep. Dead Silence in Ghosts works well. The difference in the two games is that in Ghosts, few people run Amplify. The perk systems are set up differently, leading more people to run other perks instead of soundwhoring in Ghosts. In MW2, you could run Sitrep Pro and not sacrifice losing other perks in that Tier. This led to an abundance of either Sitrep or Ninja."
blackops3,3ddxxv,KindOfOk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:39 2015 UTC,This I feel shouldn't be in the game. Let soundwhoring be an Infinity Ward hallmark. That way there's a difference between the developers games. I want to be able to tell the difference between a Treyarch and Infinity Ward game.

I believe at one point in Black Ops 2, the UAV was 525 points, meaning, if you were playing Free For All or TDM, it would have taken six kills to get a UAV. Insane."
blackops3,3ddxxv,rmx687,3,Wed Jul 15 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"The UAV was 350 at launch and 425 later on. Still extremely easy to get. 4 kills and any kind of assist/equipment points by default, 3 kills and a critical kill assist/equipment points with Hardline."
blackops3,3ddxxv,fatcIemenza,4,Wed Jul 15 20:00:06 2015 UTC,The UAV should not take 5 kills in free for all.
blackops3,3ddxxv,rmx687,9,Wed Jul 15 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"Considering it tells you where the entire enemy team is and allows you to ballgame the spawn system that much more easily, 4/5 kills is still reasonable."

blackops3,3ddxxv,Kaeys,2,Wed Jul 15 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"I mean it kind of is camping. But my friends and I like to control one side of the map in TDM. Using communication to aid each other.  So basically we all have a ""spot"" we generally go to and if we get killed we call out where from in an effort to keep that side of the map for our own. Usually 4 of us hold back and ""camp"" while 2 go out and rush.  Most people call us campers but I don't care. That's how we have fun. And some guy calling us a camper won't hinder that"
blackops3,3ddxxv,ozarkslam21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, I guess it's a good tactic for certain gamemodes. It makes sense. I can see it working for CTF, keeping the person with the flag alive and making sure the side of the map is safe."
blackops3,3ddxxv,Kaeys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:18:24 2015 UTC,Well it's a much better tactic for TDM. Myself and the guys I play with are all upper 20s to upper 30s. We're a bunch of old men who aren't great. But we have success when we play together and communicate well

Was a decent player before AW but never had huge success with my super aggressive playstyle (2.1 KD in BO2). In AW though, I can rush hardcore and still win almost any gunfight against people who play conventionally. BO3 looks promising though. I will definetly abuse any sort of movement advantage."
blackops3,3ddxxv,FirkraagTheRed,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  AW let me play as fast as I wanted, and I LOVED it. You could take so many unconventional paths to the enemy, and you could move in a such a way where they couldn't hit you. Even on the PC where people have ridiculously good aim, if you knew how to chain your exo movements, you were almost impossible to hit. I believe that the only people who hated it are the people who can't play fast or can't aim.  If BO3 lets me play fast and has good fluid movement, I'd be super happy."

blackops3,3ddxxv,WigglyWastebin,4,Thu Jul 16 00:22:28 2015 UTC,2 main things:  Sound whoring   Spawn trapping  I'm a big believer in making player who know what they are doing be dominate and both these thing bring a lot of meta into the game I think.  If you can't lock someone into the area you want and know where the spawns will be you should be rewarding by being able to massacre the other team
blackops3,3ddxxv,FirkraagTheRed,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:56 2015 UTC,Spawn trapping   I can't get behind this one. Someone should not spawned in a camped room (often in line of sight) just because I know where to get people to stand. That's punishing someone for another player's actions.
blackops3,3ddxxv,WigglyWastebin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:11:11 2015 UTC,Okay i didn't mean spawn trapping to that extreme. But their hasn't been line of sight spawn trapping for a while.  I just meant like yeah they are all gonna spawn right around that corner because our team has dominated the map.  Spawns flip way to easily in the newer games.  I want all map to be like nuke town where you can just pin the team into the garden and that side yard.  Not by yourself but if your team works together.

It's been like that since COD 4. Plus it's difficult enough to get people to jump on objectives as it is. If you don't give them streak points by capping flags, defusing bombs etc... every single mode will be glorified TDM. We have to do whatever we can to make people want to complete objectives."

blackops3,3dh27h,akapixelrat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:57:33 2015 UTC,"They have to be careful because if they make too many they will just sit forever.  There is a store by my house that still had BO1 prestige editions up until last year.  A lot of the people preordering will cancel or not pick them up at retail locations.    The fact is these are specialty items that don't sell nearly as much as the base game so they have to keep an eye on demand vs. production.  As for the scalpers, who cares? They aren't ripping anyone off unless someone is willing to pay it.  If people wouldn't buy these things for outrageously dumb prices this stuff wouldn't happen.  Treyarch and activision are handling it properly.  The fact that people are clambering for the low quality trinkets is boggling to me. To each their own though.  FYI you can buy a very similar fridge at Sears for 45 bucks if you really need a little soda chiller."
blackops3,3dh27h,chipper3381,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:04:28 2015 UTC,akapixelrat how much was the BO1 Prestige Edition? I really want one but don't feel like paying high price for it.
blackops3,3dh27h,LifeHated,2,Thu Jul 16 07:19:38 2015 UTC,"Just the original price, they disappeared a few months ago, I'm guessing to clear shelf space?  The bottom line is this stuff is never that incredibly rare. If people would stop buying into the ""I need it"" hype or buckling to the eBay prices there would be plenty of then to go around.   If you don't get one on preorder, call around stores, especially those outside of cities closer to rural areas and you'll probably locate one.  Or just don't buy it and wait for all of the complaints about the fridge quality like every other thing thing ever included in these things."

blackops3,3diqss,BasedGodCrim,4,Thu Jul 16 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"Because in April,Activision usually release a ""Gold edition"" which integrated the first DLC.   So you end up playing with a fraction of the already smaller playerbase? No thanks.  In fact, having any DLC at all only hurts you on PC. The largest group of players is always the group with no DLC."
blackops3,3diqss,fatcIemenza,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:42:00 2015 UTC,This don't work like that with treyarch
blackops3,3diqss,fatcIemenza,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:04 2015 UTC,How so? I can promise you that is the case with BO2 right now.
blackops3,3diqss,fatcIemenza,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"They told me that in black ops 2 PC,matchmaking wasn't regroup by DLCs player and no dlc.But if this is the case,fuck them.PC is not the same as consoles,they just should make Dlcs free on PC like they did on cod4,Cod5 because splitting the already tiny community with 15$ garbage Dlcs that almost anyone buy on PC...They would make a lot more money by giving free season pass for all PC players than selling dlcs because this would increase significantly the direct sells of the game and give a strong player base,bu Activision is too close minded to see that and prefer treat PC community like console community but anyone buy their craps on PC.They should give it free on PC and compensate with some microtransactions."
blackops3,3diqss,fatcIemenza,3,Thu Jul 16 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure who ""they"" is, but it has to be done like that. Otherwise, you'd have a WaW situation where DLC maps were incorporated into every lobby, and players without the maps were kicked as the game started.  In BO2 and most other CoDs, you only got matched with people who have the same DLC packs as you.   What you're suggesting Treyarch do has precedent. For CoD4 PC, the map pack with the 4 additional maps was free with the purchase of the game, as opposed to costing 10 dollars on consoles. However, Treyarch/Activision would not give out 50-60 dollars worth of content to the whole PC community for free. It makes more sense from a business standpoint to operate as they are now."
blackops3,3diqss,DJvic7,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"They gave every single map pack on World at War PC with patches,all for free.The problem is that CoD4/CoD5 Dlcs on PC were bought by Nvidia and give for all PC players for free.But since Steam garbage has made his way on CoD,this was the perfect occasion to sell some 15$ dlcs.  They can see very well that they sold almost no dlcs on PC,this audience and platform is different than the console one.As I said,they would make a lot more money by just giving all the dlcs for free and having moreover a better image.They have to force another partenariatship with Nvidia about dlcs.  However,having free dlcs on PC will embarrass SONY and MICROSOFT,I wouldn't even be surprised if they signed up some conditions about PC version of the game,such as no free dlcs,for not attracting console players to PC version."
blackops3,3diqss,sw3ar,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't know Nvidia did that for the CoD4 and WaW DLCs, that's really cool.   The WaW DLC problem I mentioned above happened on consoles, I didn't play that game on PC.  The issue with what you described is that CoD on PC is only good when Treyarch does it. SH gives no shits and IW barely has enough talent to make a functioning console version, nevermind an actual good console or PC version. Our platform doesn't seem worthwhile to invest in when the games are only good once every 3 years."
blackops3,3diqss,marinafanatic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck would they do that. Just cause the cod community is smaller makes it so the don't need to pay for dlc's.

blackops3,3diqss,XxBeforeTimexX,0,Thu Jul 16 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"They have all the logical.reasons to.give.free dlcs on PC.Moreover,buying dlc on PC break matchmaking because of the player pool being ridiculously low.C'mon.buying dlcs and not even be able to play neither dlcs maps or even vanilla maps correctly...  As I said,PC market =/= console market.History as shown many times,even recently that games sold.a lot more on PC when DLCs and Mods are avaiblr free to everyone that putting some closed game with 15$ dollars policy. CoD4.and CoD5.are probably the most sold cods on PC because of dedicated servers,browser servers,fre dlcs and Mods,like that,they sold.their game in long term.Even nowadays,there are mods that are being made for CoD4 and CoD5.Only problem is that Activision has become very very short profit minded and only see the 50$ season pass.  If they really want to bring back PC players on COD,they have to bring back CoD4/5's policy on DLCs,servers and Mods."

That should be similar to everyone, but it isn't, because the killcam shows a blackscope, when in reality the person has ADS'd. Theater mode should show what you saw because that makes the most sense. Also, I have heard from a developer (on this sub) that he/she measures the netcode lag to be a lot less than previous CODs and that they have a guy working on it. But this may need more backing up."

blackops3,3defc6,wickerwaka,7,Wed Jul 15 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"We've spent some time on this this project because there was some stuff that was just broken. For instance, the problem with the ADS raise animations and some other view-specific actions not being in sync is something we've addressed.  As other people have pointed out, the view of the world seen in the killcam is not the view of the world that the player would have seen. What you see is the servers unadjusted view of the world. I say unadjusted because when the server does hit detection it adjusts its view of the world to match what the player firing would have seen. While that adjusted view is good for collision detection and hit traces, it is not suitable for display because only certain parts of the world are adjusted."

blackops3,3daw68,MikeSouthPaw,11,Tue Jul 14 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with you I wish there was the ability to level up against bots and unlock stuff. I usually play online or custom games online with bots, but if the internet goes down I sometimes I do local play and its really disappointing that they neglect this. I hope they give a ton of customization options for local, such as ability to set the number of points for each scorestreak(you can make UAV cost more or less), ability to change stats on weapons, etc. It's offline and you should be able to do what you want."
blackops3,3daw68,DefenestratedRonik,3,Wed Jul 15 01:02:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, except maybe with the leveling up in local play. Unless we have an option to unlock everything, then I would just hate it since with friends we love to LAN on CoD and we want an equal play field. That is why MW2 is ruined for us. :'(  AW fucked up the local play so much by not having camos and gears, I mean with how they develop create an operator, it's a big joke.  BO2 has the best experience for local play, I would just add the ability to save a custom game mode (so far it's only for online customs), more features (like one-site SND, score streaks multiplier slider, etc...), and adding extra bonus gametypes to local (like Arms Race etc)"
blackops3,3daw68,BleedingBlack,3,Wed Jul 15 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"Not allowing certain DLC or unlocks, (like Supply Drop weapons and gear), in offline play is really annoying. COD isn't the only game guilty of this either unfortunately. I hate playing a severely gimped version of the game when my Internet goes down. Normally if I want to kill bots I set up my own private, online matches because it's so much better. The strictly offline play in A.W. is mediocre at best. Mind you, Black Ops 2 wasn't a whole lot better in this regard. We didn't get one-flag CTF when it was added, and you couldn't have as many bots either."

As for camos and dlc guns, yeah for some reason camos are locked in AW local play. I can understand dlc guns but camos? Black Ops 2 and Ghosts had camos in their Local Play.  As for loadouts there are restrictions you can set in the game rules and limit weapons bots use. I loved playing snipers only with them.  To anyone who bothered to read my longa$$ post, thank you."

So that's why if you go snipers only, some bots will just run around with knives."
blackops3,3daw68,BleedingBlack,2,Wed Jul 15 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yup I only see this happen to the recruit bots (playing with mixed bot difficulty) in AW they just run around with knives if you have loadout restrictions and sometimes they use the basic pistol even if you ban it.

Devs won't waste their resources supporting things that aren't high on the totem pole of importance. The overwhelming majority of players play online, and in today's world, slow internet is rapidly becoming more rare. Fiber is being laid across the country, and even using your phone as a hotspot can give you internet fast enough to play. Some people, like yourself, may still have bad connections, but most of the country (assuming you're in USA) has good internet. Siphoning resources to accommodate a dying breed makes no sense. Unfortunately for you, the days of split screening in a bedroom with three friends is gone. This isn't Goldeneye. And offline stat tracking?

blackops3,3daw68,BleedingBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:41 2015 UTC,You couldn't be more wrong. It's been proven time and time again that the majority of players play solo and/or OFFLINE. High speed Internet isn't as prevalent as you think it many parts of the world - even in the year 2015. Plus most gamers prefer to play alone. Many polls have shown this to be the case.  I do agree that stat-tracking for bot play is pointless though.
blackops3,3daw68,Bleak5170,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"Source? Most players do not play offline. That rumor began with Drift0r (one which I took as truth and perpetuated myself) but was subsequently debunked by Drift0r recently. Unless you link me to an actual poll and statistics that show the majority of players play offline, there is no fact to back that up.   I honestly have no idea what the current state of high speed internet is, outside of the US. The thing is, you don't need 50ms ping to play CoD. You can have a poor connection and still play online regularly. I have friends in my clan that do it. It's not ideal, but they are able to play well, even with a slower connection. As long as you aren't running on dial up, or have 10 devices sucking bandwidth, you'll be alright I think."
blackops3,3daw68,KindOfOk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"And offline stat tracking? When you can set AI to be stupid, those stats would be so lopsided, they wouldn't mean anything anyway.   They would mean something to me considering I wouldn't be playing against the stupid AI.   Unfortunately for you, the days of split screening in a bedroom with three friends is gone. This isn't Goldeneye.   It's not like this hasn't been a feature in the recent past. Pretty sure BO1 had 4 player splitscreen.  I don't see how having a solid offline experience is siphoning from any other part of the game. It has been done before."

blackops3,3daw68,jjizzel5555,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying mix them, that would make no sense. Just a fun thing to do offline. Leveling up and tracking progress completely separate from online play."

blackops3,3ddrve,zen_master87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Its actually an interesting angle on the subject.  The issue i have is the problem is not well defined.    Implementing any kind of system that punishes any behavior that is not outside of the terms of use in public lobbies i am strongly opposed to.    I am just as opposed to complicating the matchmaking algorithm any further without a very compelling reason to do so.  Matchmaking should be about providing the best possible lobby performance for all selected players first, matching as quickly as possible second, honestly from a design perspective those should be the only priorities.  Strict sbmm gets introduced for a not very well defined problem with no real expected outcomes or a good way to measure them and look at the chaos this caused.  I never personally felt that leaving matches was a cataclysmic problem.  In pubs... who cares, in league play, it only gives you a temporary advantage while the software tries to replace the missing players.  Having to sit through a migration can be frustrating but i have been playing since cod 1 and never found this to happen a gamebreaking amount of the time."

blackops3,3dex6v,Getmethepresident11,5,Wed Jul 15 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. Playing with a mouse gives you much greater precision, meaning aim assist isn't needed.

blackops3,3dbo80,YeezyCop,16,Wed Jul 15 00:47:24 2015 UTC,I felt Black Ops 2 had this down the best and since Black Ops 3 is made by Treyarch as well I'm expecting this.
blackops3,3dbo80,DefenestratedRonik,2,Wed Jul 15 00:58:18 2015 UTC,I agree every gun was pretty much on the same playing field which kinda make me hate AW because one or two guns dominated every other gun in the game. BO2 had it to where the disadvantages of certain guns and classes compared to others were good because something could always beat something else and thats where AW lacked.
blackops3,3dbo80,jjizzel5555,2,Wed Jul 15 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"That's because of the BO2 map design. The maps were designed in such a manner that it gave smarter/better players the advantage. So if a person using an M27 gets into a gun fight w a person using an AN97, the person w the better map positioning should win the gun fight. In AW, that doesn't happen as much because of the 3D movement."

blackops3,3dbo80,iKazed,-5,Wed Jul 15 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think in terms of diversity, Treyarch has failed the most. Look at Black Ops 1...literally every gun had another carbon copy of it. Galil = AK47 = Commando, Famas = AUG, don't even mention the SMGs of which there was basically 2 (AK47u/MP5k vs the others). No damage variation, no RoF variation, just different models and names. Black Ops 2 was better, but still not good."
blackops3,3dbo80,Goaliedude3919,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:31:58 2015 UTC,"The weapon stats may have been similar in BO1, but there are other things to make guns stand out. For example, the Galil had a completely different recoil pattern from the AK and Commando. The same thing goes for the Famas and the AUG. Etc. I don't know what you're talking about in BO2 though since none of the guns had repeat statistics."
blackops3,3dbo80,iKazed,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"slightly* different recoil patterns.  And guns in BO2 that were copies:  MP7 = Vector K10 MSMC = PDW57  Something about them and SMGs...  The AN94 and SCAR were pretty close, as were the MTAR and M27...just a few tweaks. Like I said, it got better, but it got nowhere near IW level diverse. That's the one thing IW does right."
blackops3,3dbo80,Goaliedude3919,2,Thu Jul 16 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"They weren't slightly different at all. The Galil had a recoil pattern that pulled up and to the left. The Commando and AK have recoil patterns that are more circular. The same thing goes for the FAMAS v. the AUG. The FAMAS pulls up to the left and the AUG is circular. The recoil patterns are COMPLETELY different.  MP7 and Vector have different ranges and recoil patterns, in addition to the Vector having a faster centering speed. The MSMC and PWD aren't even close to the same. The MSMC does more damage and has better range, in addition to them having different recoil.  The MTAR and M27 aren't even close to the same. The MTAR does more damage damage up close but falls off quicker, has a lower centering speed, different recoil pattern, and that doesn't even account for the fact that the M27 had SMG mobility. The SCAR and AN-94 aren't even close either. The SCAR is a 3 shot kill for a long distance and never drops past a 4 shot kill. The AN-94 has much worse range and drops to a 5 shot kill. To make up for that, the SCAR has more recoil.  All the guns you listed have literally only one thing in common, which is the Rounds Per Minute (RPM). Each one of these guns plays very differently. Most guns had similar RPM statistics because of the frame rounding issue on consoles making it pointless to have minute RPM differences."
blackops3,3dbo80,davidvonderhaar,13,Thu Jul 16 12:16:31 2015 UTC,"Extremely hard and getting harder every game.  Here is the honest truth that depends on how you define diversity. From a game design point of view, here are some of the major things working against us to create diversity:  Guns kill with 3-5 shots [depending on range, and on average.] That's just not a lot of headroom. With the FOV being what it is, and being in first person, guys start to become little pixels when they get too far away. Thus the engagement ranges are clamped down, because it's just not that fun to pixel hunt on a console shooter.  We are a ""bullet"" shooter. While we have different types of damage (fall damage, for example) all ""non-gimmicky"" guns use bullet damage. For example, we don't have ""shields.""  When we play, we don't get to take down the <fire> shield player, using a <fire> weapon and then change to an <electricity> gun, because the guy we are fighting is an <elemental> user, and thus his <combat resistances> would be lower and we could do more damage. Nope. We have 100 health and bullets that do 25-35 points of damage.  There's an expectation of ""lots of guns."" It's a reasonable thing to ask for. However, once you use up the fire types (single shot, burst, full-auto, and variants of all 3), you can probably get 3 or 4 guns in a class where you can meaningfully create diversity.  You have to do it with art, animation, and sound design. Not game tuning. It's just really hard to make a full automatic assault rifle feel meaningfully different from a different full automatic assault rifle more than once or twice.  Weapons need to be ""balanced"" unless it is a ""gimmick"" gun and a ""gimmick"" gun can only be under-performing. That caps the mins/maxes and ranges available to us.  We have 1000s of tunables available to us. Most are not perceivable by a player, even if they meaningfully change the average K:D or SPM. The Grip in BO2 comes to mind as an example of where players were convinced it ""didn't do anything"" when, in fact, it did a lot to change your output. To create diversity, the changes should be perceivable and obvious to a player.  More guns is not better. More is more. And the more you have, the less [gameplay] diversity you will be able to create.  -V"
blackops3,3dbo80,jameskies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:04 2015 UTC,I think you have more room for diversity with this super futuristic stuff. Take after AW with better execution. At the very least we can have some unique looking and functioning types of weapons.

blackops3,3dbo80,KindOfOk,6,Fri Jul 17 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"I've been more than pleased with weapon diversity in CoD. There are multiple guns for every situation. AW doesn't have many stand out guns, because you can use the BAL, ASM1, or MORS and be covered. Any other CoD has had fantastic variety. Even Ghosts, which many dislike, had good options for weapons, and even added the marksman rifle class.   There isn't much you can do with shotguns. Pump, Fully auto, semi auto. BO2 took it farthest with a four burst and slug only, but let's be honest. The Remington was king.   It shouldn't be about how many weapons you have. It should be about having the right types, even if you only have 4 instead of 6 or 8."
blackops3,3dbo80,fatcIemenza,5,Wed Jul 15 01:32:28 2015 UTC,"BO2 had great weapon balance and diversity. Out of all the guns I only found the Executioner and S12 to be total dog shit.   MW2 did too though, it was just overshadowed by shit like Commando and OMA tubes fucking everything up. They had 6 shotguns all with a purpose (even though they shouldn't have been secondaries).  Also I think grenades in BO1 and 2 were similar. I don't have the stats on hand right now though so I could be wrong. Both did nothing against Flak Jacket though and the only difference I think was that C4 in BO2 was way more appealing."

The fact is that SMGs have faster sprintout and ADS time, ADS movement speed and hipfire accuracy, this means that a SMG is able to fire earlier and more accurately than other weapons, giving them an edge over other weapons."
blackops3,3dbo80,zen_master87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"Blops did a nice job with this, some of the evidence of this can be found in the well defined roles that competitive teams would have like anchor positions etc.  I don't feel like weapon diversity and balance are especially difficult if the design decisions you make peripheral to them are well integrated.  The exo suit, double jumping, dashing etc. was a terrible idea and implementation into twitch ping based low ttk shooter like cod and did its part in destroying weapon diversity among other critical tenants in the series.  It serves as a perfect example of one design pillar not being in alignment or integrating with another and causes the whole house to fall down around it.  If they can manage map design/size angles, structures etc. around play relative speed and intelligent spawns with 3d movement this makes weapon variety and viability much more of a reality.  For example if every map is wide open with very few useful structures and play basically like a flat parking lot (*coughs ... AW) then you will continue to see no shotgun, if the game plays too fast and the maps are too small, spawns wonky and unfixable as a result, then you will see no snipers still... and so on."

blackops3,3dajr0,Squeakopotamus,3,Tue Jul 14 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"As a side note, how do you progress through the story line?  I've never played zombies, but it seems to me like if you're not that good you can't get through all the levels to learn the whole story?"
blackops3,3dajr0,KindOfOk,3,Tue Jul 14 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"You have to be pretty solid to complete the EE's in the maps, because many of them will have you upwards of 20+ rounds before it's over. If you can get to round 20 solo, and complete buildables, you will be fine. If you aren't that great, you will want a full party of 4, and that makes things much easier.    The hardest part will be finding 3 other people to EE hunt with through the maps. Honestly at this point, I would just go to Youtube and watch through the NGT Zombies series. They have done every EE on every map at least twice and have them up in playlists to watch.   In short, yes, it takes a fair amount of skill to get through EE's. If you struggle to get past 15 rounds in zombies solo, you will have a bad time."
blackops3,3dajr0,Squeakopotamus,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:30 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you have to find the easter eggs in order to learn the story?"
blackops3,3dajr0,KindOfOk,5,Tue Jul 14 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"Yea....otherwise you are just killing zombies. It began as the true definition of an Easter Egg. Little radios to listen to and stuff like that. Der Riese was the first multi step EE that began actually telling a real story. What we still call ""Easter Eggs"" are not actually that anymore. They are a storyline pieced together by solving intricate puzzles while slaying zombies on the side. It flip flopped from being ""Kill zombies for fun and oh! an easter egg is hidden on the map."" to ""find and solve the easter eggs and oh! there are zombies to kill while we do it."""

blackops3,3dbygv,whereisthetrashcan,10,Wed Jul 15 02:07:47 2015 UTC,I'm really sick of Nuketown. The only way I could be excited for Nuketown is if they expand it past the fence and to the other houses down the street.
blackops3,3dbygv,CGA001,3,Wed Jul 15 03:35:43 2015 UTC,You really think that a new nuketown would be the only small map in the entire game? Think back to the small maps on BO1 and BO2.
blackops3,3dbygv,Denly95,2,Wed Jul 15 02:11:17 2015 UTC,I mean super small. I havent played bo2 multiplayer in a while and all i can think of as smallish is standoff.

blackops3,3dbygv,Lordducky9poo,5,Wed Jul 15 03:14:27 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this, but with the new movement Nuketown would be way too small of a map. What they should do is have that entire town Nuketown is in (there are 4 or 5 more houses) as a map and have that be the new edition of Nuketown for this Black Ops. No matter what I feel like it will return in some way or another."
blackops3,3dbygv,misunderstoodONE,3,Wed Jul 15 04:12:49 2015 UTC,An expanded nuketown would not work as a map if they didnt modify it. 6 houses is way to many. Campers would be insane.

blackops3,3df893,G0DatWork,7,Wed Jul 15 20:20:14 2015 UTC,It is already hard enough to get people who play the obj on my team. Removing scorestreaks makes Domination to a 10 minute TDM again.
blackops3,3df893,FuXs-,-4,Wed Jul 15 20:30:12 2015 UTC,I'd prefer that to a Dom game where people get like 8-12 caps. Too much flag switching ruins the flow of the game
blackops3,3df893,FuXs-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:19:14 2015 UTC,https://youtube.com/watch?v=nN4QwqtxGrw 8-12? I hope you mean 8-12 per round Kappa
blackops3,3df893,LifeHated,-2,Wed Jul 15 23:24:10 2015 UTC,I was referring more to an average player.  And I think every agree AW Dom was horrible but this was for many reasons. Mostly the fact that map control didn't exist in that game due to the movement
blackops3,3df893,tyzenberg,5,Wed Jul 15 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"Killstreaks just make every game TDM.  If they are doing the objective, they are helping the team and they HAVE to do it right.  Using your example of rush planting, lets just say every1 rush plants. The defending team will rush and kill the planter and the rusher will get no score for his scorestreak if he rushes. This will make the planter be tactical.  No killstreaks please."
blackops3,3df893,tyzenberg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"1.They make it easier to balance the rewards in all game mode, ie a uav in tdm is much more difficult if there are scorestreaks   Just make kills and assist give more score.  Arms Race was excellent.   2.They help out the lesser players a lot   BO3 has specialist abilities, people having trouble getting streaks will be fine with those.   3.Players will camp no matter the reward system so it should be based solely on that.    I don't even understand your train of thought on this one, it sounds like you are saying the streaks should encourage more people to camp.   4.Playing the obj is much more complex than just capping flags whenever you can etc. So by making them scorestreaks you are encouraging players to get score not necessarily do what best for the team( such as rush planting in search with no support so they get an easy defuse etc) But kills are always good for the team no matter what.    Kills are not always good for the team.  In Hardpoint, you can kill somebody and get them to spawn near the hill.  Somebody on the other team might be anchoring their team to spawn on the bad side of a map.  It's better to leave him there, instead of flipping spawns and giving your team bad side."
blackops3,3df893,tyzenberg,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:25:48 2015 UTC,I was just saying camping is the main complaint again killstreaks and Idt it has anything to do with it.  Okay but a bad kill is much much more rare than someone doing something foolish on the obj. And the problem with you scenario is spawns more than anything.  It usually takes more than one guy to flip spawns unless he is going off and gets like a 4 piece. At which point your team should be able to get the hill while they are all down
blackops3,3df893,Tenshi-01,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:03 2015 UTC,"Kill streaks give more incentive to camp compared to Scorestreaks.  People will still camp with scorestreaks, but there is more incentive to actually go to the objective than just sit in a random corner.  Camping is going to happen, but killstreaks add fuel to the fire, where scorestreaks kind of smother the fire.  I'd say they're pretty even.  How badly could one player hurt a team by using the objective to get a higher score?  I guess he could be hogging the flag in CTF, but your team isn't giving up points if he keeps it.  He could capture the hill, jump out to let the enemy capture, and then recapture, but if he's the only person willing to play the hill the team already lost.  He could ""rush plant...with no support"", but what was his support doing? why aren't they guarding the bomb now?"
blackops3,3df893,Tenshi-01,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:39:51 2015 UTC,You could three cap in Dom and lose map control.  or do what you said and pick up the ctf flag and just go chill to get double score on kills. In search I've seen people let them plant to try to get a kill and defuse then die. Things like this hurt your chance of winning way more than doing nothing
blackops3,3df893,OneKup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"Good points, especially that SnD defuse thing.  Still, I think the positives out weight the negatives."
blackops3,3df893,mortysteve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"I like the Scorestreaks way since you can get them just as fast for the people that wish to camp somewhere, or you can play the objective and get them a lot faster and more often.   You also don't need to keep capping flags, and it is usually the people that don't know what they are doing who will attempt to cap all the flags. You get quite a bit of points for defending the flags as well, and if they manage to cap it while you are defending the flag, then you can probably easily clear them off it and gain more points for capping it once again.  This will be the same for other objective modes, in that the players that are worse or not used to the mode will dash off to try and get these extra points. (A plant in SnD) The better players will play the game how it is meant to be, and gain the points that way, since if you die then the points are useless. In the end these mad rushers that hunt for easy points will learn what the best way to play the modes is, or they will keep dying and feeding other teams."
blackops3,3df893,jameskies,0,Wed Jul 15 23:45:22 2015 UTC,I agree that's not a good way to get lots of score but the good players will have no problem getting score or kills.

blackops3,3db75o,jacob2815,6,Tue Jul 14 22:35:50 2015 UTC,The Peacekeeper was a great DLC weapon. It filled a very specific niche being the best SMG at range and worst up close. Overall it amounted to an M27 with better mobility and worse range. If all of the DLC weapons were this way I wouldn't object to them. I never felt disadvantaged because I didn't purchase the Peacekeeper.

blackops3,3db75o,KindOfOk,2,Wed Jul 15 18:02:29 2015 UTC,The 3 new guns are free so I'm happy with them. The two guns which were in the dlcs were terrible anyway. I'm hoping that treyarch will take after sledgehammer and bring some kickass guns in.
blackops3,3db75o,RdJokr,3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:58 2015 UTC,"To earn an STG-44 or SVO you have to win them in an ASD first. Are you fucking kidding me? Meaning I could grind for weeks and never earn one of those variants. So my only other option is spend $50 on some ASD's and hope to God a variant is in there. Give me a fucking break. This is bullshit. DLC guns either need to be free for everyone right then, or go fuck yourself and don't add them in. Also, balance them first, please. Peacekeeper and Ripper were both OP.   Whew! I'm sorry about that rant. I'm just tired of the pay to win ASD garbage AW has implemented. It's made me increasingly angry as time goes on."
blackops3,3db75o,KindOfOk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:19 2015 UTC,"You do know you can also earn free ASDs right? And SHG is implementing an in-game Supply Credit system to let you trade loots for points, to buy ASDs too."
blackops3,3db75o,RdJokr,2,Wed Jul 15 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of that. But do you know how long that takes? With well over 300 weapon variants, the odds of you earning a certain weapon are slim. You already only have a 35% of earning any weapon in an ASD. Compound that with the odds of earning all other weapon variants+possible duplicates, you begin to see how astronomical those are. Of course, they can alter the odds for those DLC variants to make them more likely to be earned, but will they?   Don't forget to calculate how often you earn ASD's. Is it one every game? One every 2? or 3? For any casual player who only plays a couple hours a night, they might never earn a DLC weapon that way. It's a bullshit moneygrab to entice players to buy ASD's."
blackops3,3db75o,KindOfOk,2,Wed Jul 15 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"So in order to use the base weapon, you'll first have to receive one of the variants of the STG44 or SVO in an Advanced Supply Drop or Supply Drop   I seriously don't know how you missed this part."
blackops3,3db75o,imstraightlovableson,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't miss it. I lump the two together. ASD's you buy, SD's you earn. I just use the term ASD as a blanket term. It's done quite often here. People just say ASD to cover everything."

blackops3,3db75o,Guerrilla_Time,4,Tue Jul 14 22:52:10 2015 UTC,I believe it was. I don't remember anything about guns post-release.
blackops3,3db75o,Halloween3,3,Tue Jul 14 22:56:58 2015 UTC,This is correct   We are not fans of adding Prestige Levels after launch. We wanted Prestige to have an end goal and off ramp. It's why we gave it a name (Master Prestige) and removed the level icon when you hit it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3bzzee/can_we_not_add_more_prestige_levels_after_going/csr3fon?context=3
blackops3,3db75o,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"Even if Vahn (Treyarc) weren't fans of adding DLC weapons post launch, what say do they really have on the post launch money making aspect of their game? Don't you think Activision wants to make the most money possible and is probably going to tell all their developers now to make DLC weapons (whether to be sold separately or with map packs). I mean do you think Treyarc could say ""We're not a fan of post launch map packs so we aren't going to include any our next game.""?"
blackops3,3db75o,Hypobromite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"People called that the supply drops in AW would be monetized down the line even when SHG's said they had no plans to monetize them before launch.  Something will be monetized for BO3 and we haven't seen anything like supply drops. I think they will have micro DLCs for various paintshop features. So far we haven't seen anything (maybe I missed something) that would give a competitive advantage to players that they can monetize. There's no variants for weapons so there is an actual chance we might have some guns that are balanced and then not screwed up with the variants.  I said somewhere else that a gun or two being included in a DLC pack is fine as long as the gun included isn't better than any gun the game shipped with. If they start adding in weapons for money that are better than the guns the casual player can access with 0 money, they will start to have issues with the game and I can't see Treyarch doing something like that. It completely throws off any balance and competitiveness they worked to get."

blackops3,3db75o,mooseknucklemaster,0,Tue Jul 14 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"I think they can pull this off as long as the DLC guns have a cool factor and not an OP factor. This would cover the balance issues that could come up with adding in a new weapon later on. Just cause it is a weapon that comes with a DLC pack, doesn't mean it has to be the best weapon in the game. It can be just another weapon in the game.  Once they start adding in weapons that can only be bought that are as good or better than the standard game, then the game will be on the decline."

But with your GTX 970, I don't think there'd be an issue. A SLI 980 system was able to run the pre-alpha build of the game with over 60 FPS @ 4K resolution. If you're just playing on 1080p, you're most likely to get your 120 FPS without issues.  That said, let's just wait and see what the PC team at Treyarch has got in store."

They have to cater to the consoles because that's where the playerbase (therefore, money) is at. If the consoles can crank out 900p/1080p @ 60fps with a 7770/7790, then your 970 should be fine."

blackops3,3d7jv5,cy1999aek_maik,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:08:13 2015 UTC,I think (but don't hold me to this) that when you redeem the beta code it asks you for you Gamertag and console IIRC. Then it automatically registers to your account for you so when the Beta is release you can just download it off the marketplace and it will automatically register that your account has the beta code and you can get playing.
blackops3,3d7jv5,lukeermm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:40 2015 UTC,So no emails?

blackops3,3d6bbw,Qureshi2002,-3,Tue Jul 14 01:58:38 2015 UTC,Hit detection sucks in ghosts. It'd whoever shoots first wins. I'm an excellent player but ghosts is a melt fest.
blackops3,3d6bbw,turntupkittens,4,Tue Jul 14 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"Hit detection sucks in ghosts.   It's a proven fact Ghosts hit detection is better than BO2 and AW. I haven't played the others, but a lot of people say it's the best in the series.   It'd whoever shoots first wins. I'm an excellent player but ghosts is a melt fest.   In any game, if the hit detection is good, whoever shoots first and keeps on target regardless of the outmaneuvering skills of the guy getting shot first, will get the kill.  Hit detection and TTK are not the same, but hit detection affects TTK.  Bad hit detection like in AW, gives the bad player the chance to win. If you're bad in Ghosts, but good in the other ones, then you may not be an ""excellent"" player like you say you are."
blackops3,3d6bbw,xCriss8x,-7,Tue Jul 14 20:09:02 2015 UTC,Bo2 hit detection is good. It was bad at first but is now good.

Now, I have a PS4, but I played Ghosts for 7 months on PS3. I was playing on a monitor that only had a VGA connector. Because of HDCP (a content protection system), when I set my resolution to 1080p, my converter would cause an awful blinking that made it impossible to play games. I had to use 480p for a long time to avoid the blinking.  Even at 480p I could read the text just fine. What was the resolution of your monitor? How big was it? How far from it did you play?"

One thing that could cut that time extensively is to remove the killcams after every-freaking-round. We don't need to watch the killcams after round 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 etc... Most of the times it's a 1v1 anyway and 90% of the lobby already saw how the guy was killed."
blackops3,3d6bbw,AmazingShurtle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"Just have a HUD like global offensive, score in the top middle, and have the pictures of the players on the respective side of the score. When they die their pic turns into a skull."
blackops3,3d6bbw,thewinsomer,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:13:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't like this idea. Bringing up the scoreboard added more suspense because there is a slight chance you can die. Besides, it only takes about a second just to see who is alive, or who is dead.   I'm probably in the minority on this one...."
blackops3,3d6bbw,Patrickd13,-7,Tue Jul 14 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I assume that you don't play in a party or play with players who don't communicate a lot.  It takes less than a second to bring up the score board and see who is dead on the opposite team, but you shouldn't even need to do that. Search and destroy is about communication and awareness. Work on your awareness skill by keeping track of what happens in the match. Putting in another hud element just to track the remaining enemies would take away from the awareness skill the game mode demands of players."
blackops3,3d6bbw,FatalHydra,4,Mon Jul 13 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"It works perfectly in CS:GO, awareness still exists."
blackops3,3d6bbw,xCriss8x,2,Tue Jul 14 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"Sometime ago someone asked Vonderhaar to force mics on Ranked Play, but he said forcing players to be social is not something he wants to do. I think he said forcing people to talk is bad design or something like that.   It takes less than a second to bring up the score board and see who is dead on the opposite team   With a mini scoreboard like the one in Ghosts that doesn't block the view and marks the guys that are dead or not playing the round with a red background, I would totally agree with that. No need to show how many are left."
blackops3,3d6bbw,G0DatWork,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:21:49 2015 UTC,I like the fact that it doesn't show up. It adds a level of meta and you have to be paying attention if you want it know without pulling up the board
blackops3,3d6bbw,bubba18sar,-18,Tue Jul 14 01:05:47 2015 UTC,100% disagree with this.  These games are becoming too noob friendly as it is.    Watching the killfeed and checking scoreboard are two or the many things that turns a good SnD player into a great one.   Please stop catering to noobs Vahn.
blackops3,3d6bbw,FatalHydra,5,Tue Jul 14 00:15:28 2015 UTC,It would be made for public match only. No one is a noob in public besides you. Stop treating cod like a competitive all around game. People want to NOT tryhard and have fun at the same time.

This is due to them having variants of weapons that perform better and other variants that perform worse. Just a terrible design choice on their part, but it's made them a ton of money.   Now if it guaranteed to get me an Obsidian Steed and an Insanity, then yes, it would be pay to win."
blackops3,3daktc,famoussasjohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"A gamble, but it's still P2W. One can buy Supply drops worth $100 until he gets what he wants, then he gets better weapons at the game than people who don't pay."
blackops3,3daktc,mindbloun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"There's still no guarantee though. It's all chance that you have no control over. You still have the opportunity to get good loot as well just by ranking up. I purchased about $20 worth just because I had some extra XBL credit laying around that was going to expire, and I didn't get anything worth boasting about. The best variant I got was the MK14 Eclipse.  It's not a good model by any means, but it's not what you're trying to say it is. A Pay to Win model would guarantee you get a certain item. All ADS do is guarantee 3 items. at least 1 weapon and ANY professional item or better. This could be any crappy gun and an elite pair of pants and helmet."
blackops3,3daktc,zen_master87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:39 2015 UTC,"Still, one can pay thousands to millions to billions until he eventually gets it. It's still pay to win, you're paying to win, doesn't matter what you're getting because your intention is to win the game by paying, whether you get it or not within the hundreds you paid, you are still paying to win. AW is a P2W game? Even if it's a slight difference in weapon stats."
blackops3,3daktc,famoussasjohn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"Gambling is the model that activision is investigating with its latest ventures large scale, they did it to a degree in Destiny, and i think it proved the point that you dont need to release lots of content if you can calculate and manipulate the amount of game time it should take users to accumulate the best stuff.  Its unclear how much money they actually made on aw, the game the dlc, the micros etc. unless you are a shareholder maybe or dig through activisions balance sheet quarterly.  The overall playerbase took a hit i think its safe to say probably due to many of these design decisions but maybe they made up for it in transactions... i for one hope not.    once games begin being designed around how to turn people into zombies through tricks and tactics all in an attempt to turn them upside down and empty their pockets you are looking at things the wrong way.  Games get huge because developers try to make a game they want to play... make it the best game experience possible, THEN you will get the players.  These kinds of design decisions are designing the game backwards in my view and only wind up serving to split or diminish the playerbase.  If you have to pay to get the better weapon that gives you a clear advantage then you might as well roll the price of the weapon into the cost of the game or the dlc."
blackops3,3daktc,hellgastpt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that this type of model shouldn't be in the game or any game that you just paid $60 for. If Activision continues with the Supply Drop type idea, BO3 will more than likely have it for weapon skins since they don't have variants that differ in stats and is purely cosmetic. It gets infuriating when you see Bal27 Obsidian Steeds and Insanities running the match. Most of my elites were earned from ranking up while trying to get to Grand Master Prestige. I just don't like the variants model that was introduced lol."

blackops3,3db1rt,SyncJr,5,Tue Jul 14 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"This would be very impractical. In the middle of a game like CoD, people don't have the time to press a non-existent button and type using a controller. I'm not sure if you have tried, but it takes an incredibly long time for most people despite it being a QWERTY keyboard. Not only this, but I can't imagine someone taking the time to stop playing in the middle of a match just o type something small."

And I know what you mean, but as I said in the post, I would mostly be interested in them adding this for Zombies, as I cannot stress out enough, I think it's essential. There's time to write in the transition between rounds or even when there's 1 zombie left."
blackops3,3db1rt,marinafanatic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"But on public matches if I didn't have a mic I'd be much more worried about the zombie and not typing. Not much you can communicate with in between round, besides something like ""good round"". And honestly, I doubt anyone who has a keyboard for a console wouldn't have a mic, even a cheap one. Plus this would probably cause the problem of half of the people on multiplayer teams to be sitting in a corner typing on the slow on screen console keyboard."

The only issue I have with it being implemented on consoles is how slow typing anything meaningful into the chat is when using a controller.  Even though on PC it does have the issue with people spamming chat with complete non-sense at least it's fast and most people will rather fire off a few quick messages then continue playing. I can already picture people spending half the match camping in a bush sending out rage messages into chat that take ages to type out.

If I wanted to speak in a lobby (e.g., if I'm playing Zombies with randoms), then I will speak using my mic. I don't really know what adding text-based communication would add.    I suppose the ability to type a message to your lobby while remaining in Party chat is mildly useful."

blackops3,3ddnl4,Goaliedude3919,6,Wed Jul 15 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"This isn't even close to a valid comparison. Just going off of the modern gen games (CoD4 and onward) IW's games have steadily gotten worse while Treyarch's have steadily gotten better. CoD 4 was the peak for IW. MW2 was a really fun game, but was horribly broken. This was when the lawsuit started and because of that, they weren't able to put the proper attention into fixing the game post launch. Had the lawsuit not happened, MW2 could have been better than CoD4. Then MW3 comes along with some of the major players of the original IW missing. This is the first poor game from IW.  Then they lost even more original staff and put out the shitstorm that was Ghosts.  Contrast that with Treyarch who made W@W, which was a generally well received game, but was slightly imbalanced. Then they made BO1 which was also a well received game and liked by many. Then they made BO2 which is generally regarded as one of the best games to date. All the while, they've kept basically the same team. Treyarch has been constantly putting out better games than their previous games, including their first CoD which was CoD3."
blackops3,3ddnl4,DJvic7,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:36:25 2015 UTC,I like that WAW was slightly imbalanced. It had an smgs that was 3 hit and all ranges without stopping power if IIRC

blackops3,3ddnl4,Goaliedude3919,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:24:09 2015 UTC,True but also ghost had the hardest year to make the game with the console switch. Every says IW needed sledgehammer to make the game but treyarch is out sourcing it's ports but no one has they have 2 companies doing it  plus they were design for a console they didn't have a ton of time hands on with.  Also no one seems to talk about how they had 3 years to make this game. Which should hell alot. I think all the games going forward will be good because of this

blackops3,3ddnl4,Gurr3nX,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:18:36 2015 UTC,Oh so you saying that blackops3 hype isn't helped by this at all
blackops3,3ddnl4,rmx687,5,Wed Jul 15 15:20:56 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you're even trying to say.
blackops3,3ddnl4,Jdodds1,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:39:01 2015 UTC,Im saying I'm sick of the 3 arc circle jerk. If you want to talk about how you think bo3 will be good go for but say something able the game not just that 3arc makes it it will be amazing. That's what people used to say about IW and you see what happened
blackops3,3ddnl4,illegalnightmare,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"No one said that about MW3 or Ghosts because it was a different team. People said MW2 would be great because of IW, and it would have been if they had the ability to patch the game like it needed to be. Had the lawsuit not occurred, MW2 probably would have ended up being the best game to date. But as soon as the heads of IW left, there wasn't the same amount of confidence in IW. All the key players are still there at Treyarch though, and they've done nothing but improve with each and every game they've put out."

blackops3,3ddnl4,ca6vtec,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"The only thing that concerns me is how their maps have gotten smaller and more symmetrical with every game, to the point that it takes all of the unpredictability out of game modes like Hardcore and SnD. I can't get into Black Ops II for extended periods of time because I get tired of the same shootouts in the same locations. I fear that I really could play Standoff blindfolded and still go positive.   That's why I actually appreciated Ghosts and honestly believe it was only held back by the low TTK on an outdated network and the fragmented community. They had 2 years to make a game on 6 platforms across 2 1/2 hardware generations. Yet they delivered so many improvements to the series going forward, it's not even funny."

blackops3,3ddnl4,SyncJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:36 2015 UTC,The bottom line is that 3arch has a great track record with their games. Black Ops 1&2 are two of the best Call of Duty games of the the last console generation and on that fact alone they earned every ounce of praise. They love the pressure of having to make a great game and also know that we expect nothing but the best.
blackops3,3ddnl4,Dommy73,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"The fact that these guys are actually tweeting actively on twitter, looking into reddit posts and taking feedback from players who are looking forward to playing the game is enough to make Treyarch stand out from the other 2 studios. Treyarch are by FAR the most creative studio out of the 3 and are very passionate about everything they do AS CAN BE SEEN BY THIS VIDEO ALONE   Edit: and your point stating that ""3arc have never really innovated in the series"" is ABSOLUTELY 110% false. They CREATED the Zombies game mode and have developed the storyline into what it is now, and Zombies is arguably the most popular mode in any CoD game. They were the first of the studios to introduce a rank based matchmaking system (League Play) which played a huge role in building the competitive scene. They introduced the idea of scorestreaks to reward players for objective play which is essential in making a fun, entertaining and less camper friendly experience. I could go on for days about SMALL thing that 3arc have implemented into their games that have had huge changes on the way their games were played and the reason why they were so successful (BO2 obviously being the main one)."
blackops3,3d9vik,WhereIsTheCupcake,3,Tue Jul 14 17:07:23 2015 UTC,It completely depends on the retailer. My local retailer doesn't require you to pay some cash up front. Downside is that I have no price guarantee.

Essentially what happens is the $5.00 you deposited, will go towards your game. So when it releases, you pay the total price minus what you deposited."
blackops3,3d9vik,robz9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"My local GameStop charges $5 minimum for normal preorders, and for Juggernog, I believe they charged $25 minimum."

blackops3,3d5t6h,poklane,24,Mon Jul 13 19:22:47 2015 UTC,That's a good compromise for pubs. First to 6 rounds is meant for 4v4 not 6v6.
blackops3,3d5t6h,fatcIemenza,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as long as they keep the side-switching every round, I'm fine with going back to a 7 round limit for pubs. On non-competitive maps in pubs where one side has a huge advantage, it's easy to get fucked over by people quitting out before the side switch."
blackops3,3d5t6h,JessPlays,4,Tue Jul 14 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"True, in the end, pubs matches take too long."
blackops3,3d5t6h,xxTHG_Corruptxx,6,Mon Jul 13 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"Something to consider: This might work better for Specialists. The more rounds there are, the more likely it is that people will get more than one Specialist use. Hell, if a team is able to dominate the first 4 rounds, it might actually possible to win without the enemy team getting a single Specialist. Which is good, IMO. It would be annoying to be having a perfect game, then an enemy player (who hasn't earned many points) gets a one-shot-kill weapon for free.  I guess it depends on how they balance Specialist timers in Search. Do they carry over between rounds (presumably yes)? Will they charge faster for every kill/assist/objective compared to other modes (so you'd only need a few kills to earn it)?"
blackops3,3d5t6h,ParlHillAddict,2,Mon Jul 13 21:48:14 2015 UTC,Specialists should be disabled for search anyways.

blackops3,3d5t6h,Johtoboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think I agree. S&D needs to have a bit less randomness than TDM, and specialists could upset S&D's balance. But we'll see! Haven't played it so can't say for sure either way."
blackops3,3d5t6h,shayshay2k,2,Tue Jul 14 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"This is the same logic as people who fought against scorestreaks in competitive in BO2.   Tracking how close the enemy is to their specialist will be a skill to reduce this randomness. You will also know what specialist they have based on character models, and therefore be able to adapt accordingly. If you dont, you die. It adds another level."

blackops3,3d5t6h,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jul 13 19:24:42 2015 UTC,I don't mind this at all. I think SnD can get a bit stale for pubs but lowering the rounds needed to win would definitely help that.

blackops3,3d5c2t,EzzOmen,58,Mon Jul 13 17:24:20 2015 UTC,They should switch rounds because sometimes defense can be more advantageous than attack or vice versa. It makes the game fair.
blackops3,3d5c2t,JayT2,-16,Mon Jul 13 17:29:27 2015 UTC,It is randomly picked though so some games you would get defence and some games you would be attacking. Why is it a big deal?
blackops3,3d5c2t,Tweeney,10,Mon Jul 13 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they want to make it more fair on an individual game level? What's the disadvantage of that? I don't think anyone thinks it's a huge deal, but I find it really hard to argue that it shouldn't be changed to alternate each round, because that just makes more sense from a design perspective."
blackops3,3d5c2t,Aceroth,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"It is not a big deal. They want feedback we will give it to them. There isn't a valid reason not to switch rounds.

blackops3,3d5c2t,JayT2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:25 2015 UTC,So some maps you would get the better side and some maps you wouldn't? How does that make sense? Why not switch every round each team can have good and bad sides?
blackops3,3d5c2t,Pierccy,30,Wed Jul 15 07:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. For two reasons. 1) It's more fair 2) it helps bring casual and competitive closer together, which is important to growing the franchise. While I love 4-0 pubstomping, switching rounds is a better way to play. I'll dearly miss the golden days, but I want to see the franchise move forward and not get stuck in the mud, and this is one way to help it along.   My theory is, just like Pop Warner kids look up to NFL athletes, kids will look up to competitive gamers. It's hard to imagine, but some already do (albeit many Faze wannabes are annoying, it serves the point). Overseas, eSports events can sell out stadiums. It can happen here if nourished properly. Bring the casual and competitive sides closer together, and you begin that ascent."
blackops3,3d5c2t,KindOfOk,2,Mon Jul 13 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"Esports already sell out stadiums in America as well. Think LoL world championship in the staples center, its defintely possible but CoD just may not have the viewer base yet. This helps though."

blackops3,3d5c2t,TalentlessNoob,10,Mon Jul 13 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I can't understand why you wouldn't switch every round.    If you have it so one team has the advantageous side for the first 3 rounds, you're going to have a lot of games which begin 3-0. If you want to dismiss the fairness aspect, then at least consider that a lot of people will simply leave at this point because they're 3 rounds down and you can forget about people joining it and playing because nobody wants to join into a game where they're 3-0 down.    It simply makes more sense and is much more fair to have switching rounds, and nor can I see any downsides to the casual player."

blackops3,3d5c2t,TweetPoster,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"Something relatively minor, but constant switching made it a bit easier to complete Search challenges.  I knew someone who was trying to complete all BO2 challenges, and it was frustrating getting into multiple matches in a row where you started on attack when you had to get defuses while defending. The more times you won attack rounds, the fewer opportunities you'd get to defend. Defuses (or killing bomb planters) are hard enough as they are (as it depends what the enemy team does), but getting only one opportunity per match can be annoying if that's the last challenge you're working on.  Switching makes sure that everyone gets a near-equal opportunity to complete attack and defend challenges every match."
blackops3,3d5c2t,ParlHillAddict,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Switch every round for sure. This isn't counter-strike and the maps aren't perfectly balanced.

One team has to attack site A and the other has to attack site B, it's the teams choice if they go on the attack OR on the defense, OR EVEN BOTH. If both teams plant the bomb then whoever explodes first wins, if they all kill eachother, last man standing on whoever team wins (like regular). It's your choice if you wait for your bomb to explode or go and try to defuse the other teams bomb (in case they planted first).  Holy shit, did I just come up with a new game type?

If one side has an advantage over the other and one team starts the game on that side, they may be able to have streaks to use on the bad side.

Could add a little momentum to your team and adds in the possibility of stretching strats over more than 1 round then having to switch.  13 rounds total though, it would need to be changed from 11. This would allow 4 groups of 3 rounds, so if it ends at 6-6 the final round is team with more kills get CT side."
blackops3,3d5c2t,Guerrilla_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"I love competitive and all, but I feel that the round switch at half time is much better in pubs.  Competitive players are really good at adapting, so an every-round switch is easy for them to pick up on and adapt. A lot of newer and lesser-skilled players aren't as good at adapting. If the game starts with them trying to plant the bomb, it'll be more comfortable for them to continue doing that and playing the same side of the map until half time. Constantly switching the sides will force them to adapt to a different play style and map side each round.   I've been playing CoD for a long time, so I have no problem with it either way. I can play both well. However, I think the halftime switch is better for the newer players."
blackops3,3d5c2t,invudontseeme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to keep it the way it is and only switch after the first three rounds.  It's public play for a reason,  it's just for fun and isn't about competitive league play.  When you switch every round there's no flow to the gameplay and you're stuck every round changing classes for offense/defense.  SnD has traditionally been about being on one side and switching halfway through.  It just feels odd to switch every round and you can't get into a rhythm with sides consistently changing.  Keep the switch every round for competitive play.  Leave the public mode the way it is."

blackops3,3d5c2t,malz_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:41:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. I just hate like not being able to be in party chat when I'm with my friends and they don't want to play search or they're not even in call of duty.
blackops3,3d5c2t,QueenofScreams,0,Wed Jul 15 05:59:52 2015 UTC,I would rather it go back to 3 rounds then 3 rounds then OT.  I think it's much easier for a casual group to develop a strategy for attacking/defending by doing it many times in a row.  It also seems to make games more cat ans mouse than when you switch everytime because when you switch each time casuals tend to not think about preivous rounds as much.   Also it makes it so people who attack and defend with different classes doesn't have to switch every round and lose killstreaks progress etc.   And finally even if one side is better than the other the fact you switch balances this out.  I don't think it's unfair that if you get swept on one side you need to sweep the other. And this format even if it is unfair makes for great comebacks when one side is way better

blackops3,3d5c2t,KindOfOk,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of search, and the proper strategy for each map becomes engrained pretty quick. You know exactly which route to run, what lanes to cover, etc. It doesn't take much to switch that up each round. The problem is that maps are usually imbalanced to one side, which makes it very easy to go up 3-0 to start. That puts the enemy at a huge disadvantage going into the flip. It's horribly unfair.   I will say, the biggest nuisance of round switching is changing my class each round. One for planting and one for defending. But I'll take that minor annoyance over a guaranteed 3-0 deficit any day."
blackops3,3d5c2t,Nalgul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:06:48 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I think. The problem with switching every round is you can't get into a rhythm and there's no flow to the match.   Edit: what the fuck are people downvoting opinions for?

blackops3,3d5c2t,rmx687,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"It's a generalization. Like other public game modes, SnD pub players generally go for the kills just as much as, if not more than, the objective.  It's always been that way, hence why all of the competitive concerns here are largely overblown."
blackops3,3d5c2t,mortysteve,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:27 2015 UTC,How does round-switching have any affect on crazy killcams? Or whether you try-hard or not? Does that mean you're against round switches in Domination too? I don't get it.
blackops3,3d5c2t,rmx687,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone is arguing that 3-round halves give the defenders an unfair advantage and that they would go 3-0 into the half every game. Which is insane and has never been true back when SnD operated this way.  Part of that is because many SnD pub players join for the thrill of an elimination game mode, and the fact that at least four times per match, they'll have a chance to show off their insane loadout, camo, and skill shots for everyone to see. Having a halftime and side switch brings a thematic break to the intense action and enhances the immersion of the game. There's a reason why Counter-Strike still does it this way in casual.   And yes, Domination should get rid of side switching too - the game is much more rewarding as one extended all-out battle for the flags. It shouldn't even  have a time limit, as there's so much more potential for stomp periods and turnarounds when it's all about the race to 200.  I just don't want Black Ops III to be a sterile competitive experience, I want it to have a lot of the energy and aesthetics that made the series so engrossing in the first place. The more they try to over-refine, the further they move away from why people want to play CoD and notsomething else like Counter-Strike."
blackops3,3d5c2t,mortysteve,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"For a team playing to win, it is definitely true. You might argue that people don't play snd to win but that's bullshit. Some mightn't, but most do.    You realise that the game pauses after each round regardless, right? It takes no extra time to switch sides. The game doesn't end mid-gunfight and switch you ...    I don't really understand your argument. You could argue that round-switching in Dom interrupts the game, and I'd agree - but I've no clue how you can argue that in a round-based gamemode. Nor do I understand the idea of not being able to show off your load out/kills because the round switches every side? Again, after each round it has to respawn you which 'interrupts the flow of the game' regardless - the only thing that changes is the side you spawn on.  CS is a bad example to use because their maps are designed for SnD and so offer no unreasonable advantage. If they did, I guarantee that they would switch sides each round."
blackops3,3d5c2t,rmx687,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"Of course people play to win. But they don't play peeking from hiding spots like a League Play team would, the scenario in which you argue defenders  have an advantage every time. Again, SnD was not a massively unbalanced affair in the older CoD games. Pretending like it would be if we went back is hyperbole.  Yes, CS maps are actually often unbalanced yet the normal rules remain the same. We used to joke that the center building facing the CT spawn on CS_Italy was shaped like a coffin because the map meant death for CTs. Yet everyone gives it their best and we play to have fun. As before, I dont want BO3 to be a sterile experience slavishly following the competitive ethos of ranked League Play. I personally feel the constant switching in AW undermines the flow of the match."
blackops3,3d7i69,theopression,4,Tue Jul 14 03:03:28 2015 UTC,I'd love something like that. Also I'd love an actual zombies comic book series showing every map and the characters' interactions.

Call of Duty has a large amount of gimmicky, AI controlled, set and forget or otherwise random stuff that doesn't mesh well with competitive play.  Care Packages being a good example of this, a lucky Care Package drop will completely alter the outcome of a game based purely on random chance. Which is good in a public match played for fun that is not supposed to be won or lost based on nothing but skill, unlike League Play, which is.

Even I like to take a break from competitive to play public once in a while.  Also, people don't like to sweat every game. AW was notorious being a stressful game to play. Passive equipment like claymores helps people relax a bit and play. Also, features like Care Packages help add variability to a game, which makes it fun if you aren't taking things too seriously."

Other games like CSGO and LoL are competitive right out of the box because they are designed to be for competitive players, and thus don't have unskillful things like UAVs.

We all know the quality of ""collector edition"" extras, do you really expect it to be that incredible?  I dunno, you can get a similar counter top fridge for like $45.  Just seems overpriced to me and not worth the wild excitement I see.  The digital extras this time are even rather weak.  The camos are from BO2, and the zombies map is cool, but it's weird to gate that content behind a pricing tier.  I think I may just go with the vanilla version this year for the first time since mw2.  To each their own, if you're really into the investment then go for it, but I think I'll just save the money.  Have fun with whatever you go for."

blackops3,3d80yq,GoBlueGriff,11,Tue Jul 14 12:32:51 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but the point of a collectors edition is that there's a limited number produced so it is collectable and exclusive?

blackops3,3d80yq,brownlec,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:53 2015 UTC,Because it was announced late at night and Pre-Orders went up in the middle of the night.   The Juggernog Edition leaked early in the morning and Pre-Orders went up in the middle of the day.
blackops3,3d80yq,redflare20,3,Tue Jul 14 21:47:16 2015 UTC,Kind of fucked up that there was only 2 available for sale at my local gamestops in which most of the employees preordered for themselves. Doesn't make it any easier to get a copy.
blackops3,3d80yq,OneKup,3,Tue Jul 14 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess it would be about creating hype around BO3. Look at us, we are all discussing it right now and have probably told our friends and family about how we wanted this ""awesome fridge"". If Activision have as much business sense as I'm pretty sure they do, they will release another version of the fridge as a standalone piece. This way they can rebrand it with some other COD trademark, this keeping the Juggernog a collectors edition, filling the demand from the community, possibly getting more sales from those who already have the Juggernog fridge, and being able to charge more for the fridge by not bundling it with artwork and coasters etc."
blackops3,3d80yq,MDRox99,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:11 2015 UTC,I'd guess they don't have enough people/resources/time to make as many as they expect us to preorder if and when they restock

blackops3,3d80yq,OneKup,4,Tue Jul 14 13:49:02 2015 UTC,That's 2 separate concepts. They didn't put a Charizard in every pack so people would continue to buy packs of cards in the hope of getting one. People aren't going to keep buying versions of COD in the hope of getting lucky and miraculously finding a fridge in one.

blackops3,3d80yq,ozarkslam21,2,Tue Jul 14 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"That percent has fallen drastically    feel free to show me some proof of this and id be glad to discuss  They introduced a very popular collectors item to be sold in the collectors edition.  They certainly do not care about any percentage of people who have a mini fridge at launch.  they might have an idea how many total special editions and season passes they'd like to sell, but they aren't making enough of a crazy margin on the mini fridges as they are on the game in general.   Its a collector's edition, its going to be rare.  You snooze you lose in these scenarios"

You snooze you lose in these scenarios   Just like u/redflare20 said, there were only 2 opportunities to get one at his Gamestop and he couldn't even get one because the employees there snatched them up. If there was an even playing field and they would have announced that they wouldn't be restocking from the beginning and they kept the percent of consumers who would be able to buy one the same as previous editions, then it would be fair. Then you snooze you lose."

blackops3,3d5baw,lunaprospect,10,Tue Jul 14 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"I think Black Ops 3 has a high probability of being amazing. I also think Advanced Warfare is actually great for a first effort and am looking forward to SHG hopefully refining the formula with AW2. That leaves IW, and nobody wants Ghosts 2. I think they should do a Vietnam era shooter, with a focus on multiplayer maps with lush, dense foliage. There would definitely need to be variety, some urban maps, etc. but I would love to feel like I was actually in the jungle. Using foliage for cover, maybe even being able to climb trees instead of having ladders all over the place. Vietnam era weapons would be fun to use and a nice counterpart to the more futuristic armories of the other CoDs."
blackops3,3d5baw,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think Vietnam has a lot to offer and needs to be explored further. I've always enjoyed that era, and think it would be a good focus. The biggest issue would be scope. You would need to broaden the terrain away from the jungle (like you said) so they might have to use other locations for expansion of the story, but the main bit be in Vietnam."
blackops3,3d5baw,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the story Vietnam would have to be the focus but there is still some room for variety there. In multiplayer, they could add variety in so many ways. Maybe a snow covered forest in Maine, a lakeside village in Papua New Guinea, downtown Bangkok, the possibilities are endless."
blackops3,3d5baw,CyKoToaster,20,Tue Jul 14 04:29:17 2015 UTC,Vietnam War  No new movements classic movements including dolphin dive.  All the types of weapons and equipment available at that time in history and some ww2 Era weapons.  Multiplayer maps would be designed in a 3 lane way all very colorful and vibrant.  Keep quickscoping  It would look like Black Ops 1 because I think I just accidentally described black ops 1

Matchmaking based on connection, no RNG (like weapon variants through SDs), no crutch perks like Blast Surpressor and Toughness and a counterable Vsat. BO3 is the game I wished for by the looks of it.

TTK at or above bo1 and 2 levels.  Party chat and invites that work well on all platforms day 1, an open and honest dialog with the community on the state of online play with respect to performance, a state of the union, what is being done about it etc.  Basically go back to making call of duty again, a complete divergence from the current trend that is leading to the decline of the franchise.

blackops3,3d5baw,Dmont_C_Thomas,4,Tue Jul 14 07:17:34 2015 UTC,"To answer my own question:  I would prefer a barebones game like CoD4. Probably set in the West during the Gold Rush. It would be a deviation in terms of large scale war, but could focus on smaller skirmishes between bandits, outlaws, and bounty hunters. The good thing is that weapon options are limited, giving a solid balance to the game. Maps could be a variety, spanning the entire western US and into Alaska.   Basic movement mechanics, era-specific weapons with maybe some historical liberties taken for things like sub-machine guns. It could easily have it's own Zombies storyline (Buried is my favorite because of the atmosphere). I would have to play around with map design. Probably opt for more of a 3 lane approach. I would allow quickscoping, but would get rid of claymores, mines, C4 and such. Might add TNT as a time delayed explosive or something. Noobtubes are gone. Scorestreaks would be completely overhauled. Either done away with or drastically reimagined. Canons, stampedes, things like that would have to suffice.    If I were bold, I would create a CoD that channeled Quake, Unreal, and games like that. A fast paced, sci-fi twitch shooter that payed homage to the forefathers of FPS. Despite CoD's pedigree being reality based (for the most part) I would love to see a well done twitch shooter that really pressed players to become better. The skill gap would be larger, but the movement is fluid, the gameplay quick and skillful."

Most of what gets posted here now are questions that have been answered or could be answered by a quick Google. I wanted to throw something interesting in the mix.

The best part about making a game based off the ideas of hugely successful predecessors is that specific mistakes (noob tubes, killstreaks, perks, etc) were made before, so they can be fixed.   While technically this game would sum up to be a refined CoD4/MW2, I still think it will feel like a nice refresher to go back to the basics that made CoD what it is."

Multiplayer: Large maps, even larger than W@W's. Smaller gamemodes (TDM, S&D) will only be played on smaller maps. Big focus on vehicular gameplay.

Honestly, there's too much to consider.  -  This is probably my favorite topic of conversation, but it'd take me a good couple thousand words to nail down the idea. And it'd be very flexible, plenty of factors I could change depending on what works best in testing, that sort of thing.  The big things I'd have would be:   Future or near future setting No advanced movement Anti-UAV perk works when stationary Plenty of gimmicky weapons and equipment, but retaining an emphasis on traditional gun on gun fights A good mix of slow and fast game types No random loot <- this is an important one Chances are I'd try and put an end to selling DLC map packs. Either making them free, not having them at all or finding some other solution Having Hacker (the Black Ops 1 perk), Black Hats and the Black Ops 1 Jammer in the game. Along with a wide range of equipment to use them on. But obviously not so much that the game revolves around it, again, an emphasis on traditional gun on gun fights Probably remove quickscoping, in favor of making sniping better and expanding that roll A mix of Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 1 map design Character customization or I'd have it return to the old way where perk, weapon and team choice dictate your characters look A far, far better campaign story. A good long campaign, with interesting characters and an engaging plot. Told in the old way of switching back and forward between different factions Music, I'd probably try and get Hans Zimmer and/or James Newton Howard, and direct them away from anything that could be described as ""dubstepy'"" or too much like the Noland Batman films, and towards Hans' work on the Man of Steel soundtrack Go to folks at Treyarch for pointers on how to handle Zombies mode, as I'd not have the first clue how to get that right, but Treyarch certainly does   -  I could spend all day on this, but I really shouldn't/won't...

blackops3,3d5baw,PearElite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard of Attack on Titan Tribute Game? Yeah, imagine that with guns and in first person against other people.   No grenades, L1/R1 or Q and E for hooks. You have limited gas and you can go to refill stations around the map, call in a portable refill streak, or die. Tapping sprint creates a burst to slow down or gain momentary speed.  Hitting someone at high speed causes them to die (in cases of both of them being at high speed, higher speed wins) and you no longer have knives, as the knife is now throwing and you have infinite throwing knives. Holding sprint/jump (settings) will allow you to go 2x as fast (60mph?) at the cost of going through gas 2x as fast.  Maps no longer follow any arbitrary lane rules. They're open with short and long things to grapple on and one clear 'lane.' One map will just be a big ol' forest (homage to AoT) and another will be somewhere like New York (2015, not some far off year) where you grapple through Manhattan. The grapple should kill an enemy if they're grappled, and have a VERY long range (Too Far popped up WAY too much in AW.)   And you should be able to shoot while grappling. No preset buttons, your controller is fully customizable so you don't have to learn claw.  TL;DR  Better version of AW's Grapple, essentially Attack on Titan with guns and no titans."

I received my beta code from Amazon a month or two ago when the preorders were first allowed. Got it within 15 minutes of ordering. I instantly redeemed it.  I then cancelled my order and went to gamestop to preorder so I can go to the midnight release of it and start the install/update as early as possible. I got my beta code from that on my receipt. Then, when the Juggernog edition was announced, I ordered it online from GameStop and I got my beta code emailed to me within 5 minutes."

blackops3,3d7zyd,KindOfOk,4,Tue Jul 14 05:48:32 2015 UTC,"They tweak stuff like this late in the dev process, so there is no need to 'fix' it, as the game hasnt been released yet."
blackops3,3d7zyd,NoticedGenie66,3,Tue Jul 14 07:12:07 2015 UTC,"My theory is simple, they lowered the TTK for that YTer event to make it fast paced, they also show 1 shot kills in the video trailers to make it look bombastic."
blackops3,3d7zyd,KonvictVIVIVI,2,Tue Jul 14 07:16:03 2015 UTC,"The video trailers are staged, that's a given, but the YT events I don't think were tweaked on purpose. That would just cause a lot of them to say ""hey, this is bad""  My best guess is the TTK was mostly to do with the LAN environment. I can safely bet that it will seem a little more natural when we test the Online play in August."
blackops3,3d7zyd,asharkey3,3,Tue Jul 14 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"It has already been said that tweaks are made for media events. The snipers were made easier to use, as well as the CaC system being slightly streamlined.   That said the game is prealpha, and thats why ttk is where it is. They will likely tweak it before, during, and after the beta."
blackops3,3d7zyd,AngelsOnBikes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"Driftor himself said that the TTK was faster at E3 than it was when he originally played it. They sped things up because not everyone at E3 is very good, but they still want them to get the full experience."
blackops3,3d7zyd,Goaliedude3919,3,Tue Jul 14 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"I would rather have a game with a hit detection like Ghosts, where TTK was low... instead of my bullets absorbed like some sponge, and some guy just hipfires me to oblivion."
blackops3,3d7zyd,brollyssj4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:59:00 2015 UTC,The thing with Ghosts is that they fixed the bug that made bullets do no damage but they didn't increase the time to kill to compensate.
blackops3,3d7zyd,hydra877,2,Tue Jul 14 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"Vahn has already commented that he's on top of TTK (its one of his top priorities, I believe). But you are somewhat correct. Ever since Ghosts, COD has given the players straight LASER(no recoil)-guns, without compensating for damage/range/ROF. Luckily for us, Treyarch has NEVER failed with correctly balancing weapons for us (with maybe the exception of the BO2 FAL, or BO1 FAMAS).   Whenever they provide a no recoil weapon, they take away damage  and/or ROF (e.g M27, STG, Galil, Swat). Whenever they provide high damage, they add recoil, and/or take away range (e.g Skorpion, MP40, AN94). Treyarch has always made it so it took a certain ""skill"", to master a weapon. You can't just pick one up and drop numbers, like you can in Ghosts/AW.   Don't get me wrong. Treyarch isn't perfect. They have given us some OP weapons in the past (look above). But compared to the other studios. They do weapon balancing/variety the BEST. Hands down."
blackops3,3d7zyd,Sora26,2,Tue Jul 14 07:17:33 2015 UTC,Actually a lot of Treyarch's high TTK comes from the fact that the hit detection is horrible on BO and BO2.
blackops3,3d7zyd,hydra877,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:47:30 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but ultimately I'd wait until the beta before fully commenting on the TTK. While more recent CODs did indeed have less recoil, I don't think adding a lot back into the game would be the best decision. More recoil forces you to factor in more RNG, not to mention it's hard to control with a controller. This may also further punish the PC platform as well, since recoil is easier to control with a M&K and thus the TTK will be lower there, if this was the route they went."
blackops3,3d7zyd,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:37 2015 UTC,The previous games were fine with recoil on controller. It wouldn't surprise me if they lowered the recoil to make getting the kills easier so the game plays faster than previous ones but I don't think it hasn't anything to do with game difficulty.  AW put so much emphasis on making the game fast that it wouldn't surprise me if that was one thing they changed to help achieve that.
blackops3,3d7zyd,Yoatzinn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"No its just too low, and was set that way intentionally for reasons unknown.  Since it is such a sticking point with the community i don't understand why it isn't talked about more openly from the studio and its rep, especially if it is a technical reason and not a political one.  My hope is they lowered ttk as a result of exhaustive online bench-marking in an effort to perfect game performance and not because Activision told them to for reasons the studio will never share with us and can never actually adjust as a result.  If the later is the case, as i have strongly suspected with the last 2 cod titles, expect that you will not like Activisions reasoning behind this and therefore will never be let in on it.  We will just be stuck with another game that kills too quickly and plays more campy because its effectively a who sees who first fest."

blackops3,3d7zyd,vensamape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"I would like more recoil/viewkick also,  but I'm not sure the population wants the game to be tougher that way. With the movement speed, it could be very difficult to keep a bead on someone zooming past for enough hits to kill. We'll see in a few weeks how it plays out."
blackops3,3d7zyd,jasperrat,2,Tue Jul 14 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"BO3 isn't that fast (coming from people who've played the game), and is said to play more classical than anything.  If we're judging off sales, the population does want the game to be tougher. Ghosts was noob-friendly, and it was a shit-storm. AW was suppose to have a skill-gap, but nope, they completely destroyed that with variants, and bad netcode.    The best sellers for COD, were CODs with high skill gaps. I don't think thats a coincidence."
blackops3,3d7zyd,Sora26,2,Tue Jul 14 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"Ghosts is a little less noob-friendly than people give it credit for. Now, Ghosts had a WEALTH of issues, but it promoted medium and long range engagements more than any of the other last 4 games have. Longer lines of sight, harder to aim. And, as well as they went to large on some of the maps (see: Siege), larger maps tend to promote better tactical movement (although unfortunately due to Ghosts low TTK it instead promoted camping on absurdely large maps). Again, Ghosts had a lot of issues, many of which did make it noob-friendly, but some of its decisions I feel were rooted more in skill than not and fell a bit flat due to poor execution in other areas. It also had the best net code of a bunch, which while that led to the stupidly fast reaction time based TTK, it also removed stupid stuff like dying before you see your enemy or having wack hit markers. Less randomness is theoretically more skill based (although again its execution have having people melt counters that a bit)."

Slow TTK was introduced to the series by 3arc. All Infinity ward games have fast TTK. Ghosts has the fastest TTK, but I blame that on the gun balance more than anything.   People shit on Ghosts, but MW2 was just a camper friendly, but it has better map design and better streaks. That made the game fun. Ghosts = bad maps, streaks = not fun."

Then get on AW, grab the KF5, and do the same."

But to answer your question yes I would spend $280 on it because this would be the first collectors edition of COD I have ever bought. I say if you love COD as much as you think then yes try to save the extra money and if you cannot afford it just cancel your preorder or see the thing like other people if you are capable of getting one.

blackops3,3d3n67,DarkusRattus,7,Tue Jul 14 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"Here's how the order should go:  Timeline 1 (aka Original timeline): Shi No Numa => Der Riese => Kino Der Toten => Ascension/Five => Call of the Dead => Shangri-La => Moon/Nuketown => TranZit => Die Rise => Buried => Timeline 2 (Origins)  Timeline 2: Origins => Alt. Timeline 1 (The Giant)  Timeline 3: Mob of the Dead => Shadows of Evil  Timeline 1 is basically the timeline we all knew about, but the moment Origins was introduced, and the plot line developed a bit in The Giant's intro, I now come to the conclusion that Origins is in fact, not part of the original timeline, but rather, an alternate one.  When you think about it, Origins has shown some serious inconsistency with the original timeline (Group 935 formed as early as WW1, the Ray Gun being created early as well, 115 being discovered first in France and not Japan, etc...). People thought at the time that Treyarch's just simply retconning things, but that's not the case here. Origins belongs in an alternate timeline, and Samantha from the original timeline has somehow traveled here in order to find this timeline's original 4 and request their help (because let's face it, the original team in her timeline is most likely dead, and Richtofen's a crazy all-powerful God stuck in a power struggle with her father).  With the alternate O4 traveling to the original timeline, and alt. Richtofen killing original Richtofen before he could awaken the original test subjects, a new timeline has been created (which I've dubbed Alt. Timeline 1) so that events from the original timeline could still exist in a way to lead to this, otherwise we'd be having a major paradox.  And then there's Mob of the Dead and Shadows of Evil. While there's no clear confirmation, Ron Perlman (voice of Campbell in SOE) has said his character, along with the rest of the SOE cast, are in Purgatory, so I can say with confidence that SOE takes place in the same dimension as MOTD. How it will connect to the original timeline, I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see what Treyarch does."
blackops3,3d3n67,RdJokr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:53:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm just trying to understand what the consensus theory for the storyline is right now.  So Origins is on a completely new timeline seperate from the original storyline, and in this timeline, the original 4 meet in France in WW1 and not at Shi No Numa later on. And so after everything happens in Origins, the 3 original characters (besides Richtofen) are teleported and time travel to Der Riese and that is when the intro cut scene takes place.  The only question I have is do they travel to the other timeline during that time? Since they are there after Richtofen has trapped Samantha and Maxis in the teleporter with Fluffy, but those events happened in the original storyline.  I'm just really confused by all this."
blackops3,3d3n67,SRMustang35,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"are the people in Mob of the Dead in purgatory?  I've only played Mob and Tranzit, and was confused as fuck."
blackops3,3d3n67,falconbox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:51:04 2015 UTC,"Purgatory is a sort-of Hell-like realm, where people are sent to be punished for their sins. That was what happened to the MOTD crew, and that is most likely what happened to the SOE crew as well. Only difference is that the SOE crew most likely doesn't know each other, and that their version of Purgatory takes shape of their home town, Morg City."
blackops3,3d3n67,RdJokr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:14 2015 UTC,This was the easiest explanation I have found thanks for simplifying it for me and everyone. I never really paid attention to zombies storyline until now because its starting to get interesting. Everyone has been great help thanks everyone!!

Universe B - mob of the dead, shadows of evil, ...  Universe A2 - origins*, the giant, ...  Outliers: dead ops arcade, call of the dead.

blackops3,3d3n67,CyKoToaster,3,Mon Jul 13 09:56:07 2015 UTC,Like I said there are multiple timelines. In one timeline it takes place directly after origins. However taking ALL timelines into account it should take place before shi no numa. I have the slash because when the map comes out new information could change it's placement.

blackops3,3d3n67,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,3,Mon Jul 13 07:17:39 2015 UTC,Does it go first story-wise? I always thought the 4 characters met at Der Riese.

After all, if we assume Tank Dempsey was at lest 20 during origins, then that would make him 48 years old at the start of Shi No Numa, and the US army had no infantry men over the age of 40.  I think Origins exists in a parallel universe."

Nacht, Verruckt, Der Riese etc. don't happen the way they happen because past is changed).  The Giant (Relieve Der Riese with the updated story based on the event of Origins)."

My local gamestop was out of PS4 and only had 1 XB1 left that I got but from what I heard on youtube is that some peoples preorders that happen after 10pm of the trailer release may be cancelled so im hoping I get one. But I say just give gamestop a call everyday because I know ebgames in Canada had a restock but I havent heard of one in US yet. I say just do a little monitor on here amazon and gamestop on the chance you may get one. And Ill update here if mine gets cancelled. Goodluck to you!

I personally wouldn't even pay an extra 50 bucks much less 400 or more... but if it's that important to somebody to have one... that's their decision.  Also, people complain about all of micro transactions... once again, they wouldn't have them if people didn't pay for them...  Activision is a business, which means maxing profit... it's on the consumer to speak with their money... if you don't like it, don't pay for the extra stuff...  I don't see it as a pay to win... nothing in these exta purchases give you an advantage in the game... it's just an extra money grab... which is, guess what, all optional for the consumer...   I don't pay for lot of extras. I get the game and the map packs... I'm not paying for camos, supply drops, etc... but if somebody wants to, fine with me."

blackops3,3d37ml,WhiteWolfofUtah,3,Mon Jul 13 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"Origins, I believe, is apart of its own separate timeline. I think there are a few different timelines. There's the Origins TL, a timeline where the cycle in MotD is broken, one where it isn't, and two more for Maxis taking control or Richtofen staying in control, as well as the original timeline.   Origins looks like it could turn canon, depending on what direction Treyarch is taking with the Giant, and if anything in the future comes of the events that unfold there. As of right now, it's a different timeline than from the main story of zombies.  I think that after the Giant they will continue along the line of the main story and go back and rewrite how the events played out. This would be evident by Nikolai saying ""There is a chain of events that must be set in motion."" The zombies were present before Richthofen and any of the other original 4 existed.  The Origins characters belong in Origins, but time travel allows them to be in different parts of time, mainly by Samantha controlling how things play out. Like the zombies universe is her own game, and she is trying to get the good ending. That's like how the original 4 were in CotD but they didn't belong there; the teleporter misplaced them there and they traveled through time."
blackops3,3d37ml,mooseknucklemaster,2,Mon Jul 13 12:19:31 2015 UTC,"I posted a comment on another thread concerning how Origins fit in to the story, so I'll just copy and paste:  The Original zombies universe ends with Richthofen and Maxis fighting over control of the Aether in Buried. Rich wants to control the zombies and use earth as his playground, Maxis just wants to reunite with his daughter. They are unaware that Sam was sent back in time to another universe where WW1 was diesel punk, due to the time and space distorting effects of 115.  Sam started contacting the Original Doctor Maxis (Old man) to help her escape Agartha. The original Richthofen was a recently graduated college student. His mentor was Doctor Maxis. When Richthofen's parents died, Maxis tried to become a parent figure to Richthofen. He helped Doctor Maxis and the Original Group 935 in Excavation site 64, France. They discovered 115 and Maxis named it ""Divinium."" After Sam's contact with Maxis and claims that she was his future daughter, he became semi-crazy and Richthofen was getting worried about him. Group 935 started digging and found tunnels underneath the ground, waking up the Templar zombies that existed beneath, which were controlled by the Ancient Evil, aka Satan, part of the Agartha dimension. It is revealed that the original zombie eye color is blue-ish to purple. Many Group 935 members started to disappear or others would find their dead bodies. Maxis was infected with 115 and soon, he succumbed to the zombie disease. Before this, Maxis had little hope for Germany in WW1, so he contacted the US about what was going on, resulting in the arrival of Tank Dempsey to investigate. Nikolai was sent from Russia to investigate Germany's plans in France, and so was Takeo from Japan, an honorable Samurai.  Richthofen cut open Maxis' head and removed his brain before it could be affected by the disease. He placed it in a jar with preserving liquid and hooked it up to a Quad-rotor. Maxis was surprised that he was no longer in his physical body, but Richthofen explained it was the only way he would live. With the help of Maxis and the Original 4, Sam was released from Agartha, But in order to do so, they had to enter a portal (forgot if it was the Aether or Agartha, anyways one of these) through the Crazy Place. They were all mortal beings, therefore unable to enter. But Maxis was now basically a robot, so he entered. Once Sam was finally released, she became a God, and the opposite of the Ancient Evil. Sam had all this unimaginable power, but her one true wish was to sacrifice everything to be a little girl again with her father Maxis. She created a universe where this was possible, resulting in the recreation of everybody and deletion of their memories. EXCEPT Maxis. Maxis was the only being able to remember everything since he entered the Portal. Because of this, he became over protective of Samantha, who lost her memory and became a girl again. He sought to recreate Group 935 in that ""new"" universe. He created a clone of Richthofen to honor and reminisce his old friend from the Past universe. After everything, HE SENT Richthofen on a path to re-unite with his old companions Dempsey, Takeo, and Nikolai, who have also had their memories erased. WaW, BO1, and BO2 zombies are you playing as the Richthofen Clone, and the recreations of the Original 4. And the cycle begins again.   Mind fucking isn't it? The whole zombies storyline is one big fucking time loop. Now, BO3 will have a new storyline, where the Original Four are trying to break the loop once they find out that this has all been a loop."
blackops3,3d37ml,bruh_dinosaurs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"Dude....  Waaaaaaat. This was the explanation I was looking for, that is fucking crazy. XD just two questions, what's the difference between Agartha and the Aether? It seems like they're used interchangeably. And if I'm understanding correctly, The Giant cinematic is them trying to break the loop?"
blackops3,3d37ml,bruh_dinosaurs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"Agartha is a mythological, legendary realm. It used to be the home of an ancient civilization known as the Vril-Ya, the people who created the pack-a-punch and the mystery box, though they are not referred to those names, Group 935 named them like that. The Vril-ya also created the Vril-Generator aka the Golden Rod from CotD. This device had the power to supply an infinite amount of vril, a resource that was important and abundant to the Vril-Ya, as well as 115.  The Aether is the space/realm between life and death. It is filled with spirits and it is also that empty space between teleportation, for example that blue wavy screen in Kino and Der Riese between teleports.   The Ancient Evil, aka Satan, resides in the Aether, the original controller of the zombies.   The Crazy Place is a gateway between the universe that Cod zombies exists in and the Aether. The Knights' Templar from the medieval ages discovered the Crazy Place, as it was found underground Earth. Anyone who enters the Crazy Place becomes a zombie, therefore, filled with Vril-Ya and Templar zombies.  The Knights' Templar had a story about one day, 4 mysterious men wielding the Legendary Staffs appeared from nowhere. They warned the Templars about incoming evil, and disappeared. They were Dempsey, Takeo, Richthofen, and Nikolai.  As of right now, bits and pieces are being taken from the BO3 story but it's in speculation that the crew from Origins somehow found out that they were in a time loop, so using the power of the staffs, transported themselves to the OG universe to try to stop the Richthofen clone from causing the damage that we all know soon precedes. From the trailer, it looks like Dempsey, Takeo, and Nikolai knew what their Richthofen wanted to do (kill the OG Richthofen) so they prevented him from reaching the OG universe, in fear that they could severely change history. The crew warns OG Rich not to open the portal, but being the crazy fool he is, opens the portal anyway and gets killed by the other Rich. The 3 have to now suck it up and continue with Rich, ending the cutscene.  I'm sorry I wrote so much, the CoD zombies lore is just too amazing so I get carried away when I'm asked for help on the subject :D.  Edit: Concerning some of your questions i overlooked, Richthofen didn't create the zombies, he discovered them along with Maxis. 115 can re-animate dead cells on its own."
blackops3,3d37ml,bruh_dinosaurs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:25:43 2015 UTC,"No that's alright, the details are what I want! :D I agree,  it's so interesting, I wouldn't have failed anywhere near as many history classes had it been this interesting... Haha. So how did they know that Origins Richtofen would come out of the teleporter? Also backtracking a bit to your previous post, why does releasing Sam grant her all of that power?"
blackops3,3d37ml,bruh_dinosaurs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:40:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how they knew, neither do i know how Richthofen even ended up in the portal.  Samantha received all that power because although she was freed from Agartha, she still had the power and energies from the Aether. With that power, she essentially became the opposite of the Ancient Evil."

blackops3,3d0ev7,WigglyWastebin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:31:25 2015 UTC,Didn't they extend to better as well?  I'm surprised Xbox got that extension.
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-6,Sun Jul 12 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"Man that's some fucking bullshit. The Beta on XB1 should be the same length of time as PS4, so it should last 5 days longer.   Edit: why am I being downvoted for thinking the beta should last the same amount of time on both consoles?"
blackops3,3d0ev7,IthinkitsaDanny,8,Sun Jul 12 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"Money talks man, it's shitty but this what happens when a company first starts an exclusivity deal."
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-5,Sun Jul 12 14:34:28 2015 UTC,I doubt it'll actually be like that though. They would need the same amount of time on each console to find the bugs on each console
blackops3,3d0ev7,smurfeNn,3,Sun Jul 12 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"Umm, no. It's gonna be like this unfortunately.  And this beta isn't really for reporting bugs, it'll just let people try bo3 so more people buy it imo... :-) activision you know."
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-5,Sun Jul 12 14:45:16 2015 UTC,"Umm, no. It's gonna be like this unfortunately.   You got a source or do you just like to downvote people for being hopeful?"
blackops3,3d0ev7,smurfeNn,5,Sun Jul 12 16:05:02 2015 UTC,"My source is the exclusivity deal. For destiny the beta was exclusive to PS4 and PS3 for 5 days, then continued on all consoles for one week after that."
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-3,Sun Jul 12 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"That's a different exclusivity deal, though."
blackops3,3d0ev7,smurfeNn,5,Sun Jul 12 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"It's still activision so don't get your hopes up, bud."
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:21:11 2015 UTC,Activision's Destiny exclusivity for DLC is also a year... Call of Duty exclusivity is only 30 days. If the company means it'll be the same then explain that.
blackops3,3d0ev7,Gunpocket,0,Sun Jul 12 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"the source is the exclusivity deal. it isn't the directors of treyarch that make the rules, its the higher up at activision, which only care about stockholders and money."
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:52:06 2015 UTC,What in the exclusivity deal says that the BO3 beta will be 5 days longer for PS4? I'm pretty sure it doesn't say that lmao
blackops3,3d0ev7,smurfeNn,2,Sun Jul 12 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"Because if the PS4 beta ended earlier, that would mean those last days on Xbox would be Xbox exclusive... Right?"
blackops3,3d0ev7,jacob2815,0,Sun Jul 12 17:20:40 2015 UTC,You're basing it off of phrasing. We don't know if that's what they meant.
blackops3,3d0ev7,Dommy73,0,Sun Jul 12 17:40:52 2015 UTC,no

blackops3,3d0ev7,Doobie_daithi,3,Sun Jul 12 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"This is cool, but the dates suck for xbone. Xbone won't have beta open over the weekend. 5 day exclusive, starting Wednesday, means xbone starts on a Monday."
blackops3,3d0ev7,Its11thPlanet,3,Sun Jul 12 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, so do PS4 players get to play it from the 19th-23rd and then also when Xbox and PC get it?"
blackops3,3d0ev7,Chrisixx,4,Sun Jul 12 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yes i believe so, so PS4 players get an extra 5 days that xbox/pc dont get"
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,17,Sun Jul 12 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"I fucking hate exclusivity, especially for Betas. DLC ok, I can live with it, but Beta is basically spitting into the face of the users of the other system."
blackops3,3d0ev7,lecheesesammich,46,Sun Jul 12 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"Tell that to all the people on PlayStation who had to wait an extra month for the DLC since MW2. By the time it's released for us, the hype is ruined, all the easter eggs/secrets have been found and all the cool spots on the multiplayer maps are known.   It'd be cool to just have everything release at the same time for everyone. It'd build up much more hype because EVERYONE would be excited for it, rather than just 1 console playerbase, and more people would be likely to buy it."
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,9,Sun Jul 12 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"Right? Isn't it weird that if Microsoft still had the exclusive deal, no one would bat an eye but now since Sony does, everyone is now talking about ""exclusivity is shit"". Now I'm not saying that I agree with exclusivity deals because they really are bullshit but no one has mentioned how long Playstation players have had to deal with waiting a month for DLC. Honestly, 5 days isn't even that big of a deal. Yeah, it sucks but they'll have to deal with it like we did for the past 6 years."
blackops3,3d0ev7,lecheesesammich,13,Sun Jul 12 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's mostly because it was like that pretty much since the start of the new generation and PS gamers kinda got used to it. I know I told myself ''That's just the way it is'' many times.  But now that PS has the exclusive deals, all the Xbox gamers who are so used to getting it right away and not having to wait a month while the other fanbase found all the cool shit for you realise how unfair and shitty having to deal with it is, hence the complaining."
blackops3,3d0ev7,HiDDENk00l,5,Mon Jul 13 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. After a year or so, everyone will sure enough start to think ""That's just the way it is."""

blackops3,3d0ev7,Simple10Jack,2,Mon Jul 13 12:05:57 2015 UTC,You can avoid spoilers for easter eggs? It's not that hard.
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,2,Sun Jul 12 15:00:47 2015 UTC,Just like you can avoid watching beta footage for 5 days.
blackops3,3d0ev7,FirkraagTheRed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"I'll argue that it isn't important at all. It just gives players a sneak peek of the game. Not all the maps will be on it, progress won't be transferred onto the actual game, and it's only 5 days.   As someone who plays primarily zombies, but enjoys online alot (Max level/Prestige on Black Ops 1, 2, MW2, stopped prestiging early on MW3 and AW because I liked the emblem), DLC being released a whole month early kills the awesome experience of trying a new zombies map and no one in your party having any experience of it (I played on 360 for Black Ops 2, so I got to know that feeling). When the DLC drops 1 month early, you are bound to watch gameplay of it at some point, or at least someone in your party will."
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"It isn't important at all? The whole idea of a beta is to provide early feedback to the devs so they can fix certain elements of their game before official release, 5 less days on Xbox = less feedback and defeats the purpose."
blackops3,3d0ev7,Call_erv_duty,6,Sun Jul 12 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"Let's be real for a second here; the point of this beta is mostly to drive hype towards the game, hence it being a pre-order bonus. Most betas, and at least the ones that are made for the purpose of bug-fixing and feedback, are closed betas that require you to sign up and get approved for; like Rocket League.   Betas that you get access to exclusively via pre-order is nothing else but a way to create hype and get more people to pre-order copies. And with the amount of players on PS4, they will get their feedback anyways. If Xbox didn't get it at all, I'd agree with your argument, but they just get it later. They'll get their feedback, even if it's just a week down the road."
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,0,Sun Jul 12 15:13:59 2015 UTC,Not really. I got my code by putting 5 dollars down at GameStop. Doesn't mean I'm actually going to buy said game
blackops3,3d0ev7,Call_erv_duty,2,Sun Jul 12 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"So did I, but part of the hype is convincing you to actually buy the game. If the beta does that, then it worked."
blackops3,3d0ev7,FlyByNightt,0,Sun Jul 12 16:14:07 2015 UTC,True. The beta is the only thing that will convince me. Truth be told I probably won't buy the game for awhile. I hate the added movements. So unless it's very minimal I won't be buying except for zombies
blackops3,3d0ev7,RodneyHFarva,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:11 2015 UTC,"I've been watching gameplay videos on Youtube and it looks very limited. All the Youtubers that played it said it felt just like Black Ops 2 with a little extra mobility, but not enough to make it completely different."
blackops3,3d0ev7,SlowMotionTurtles,-9,Sun Jul 12 17:04:25 2015 UTC,"As a PS owner for the last decade, no.  Getting the DLC a month late sucks.  Xbox users can suck a dick if they're upset about this.  We have had to put up with this shit for years.  You babies can wait a week for the beta."
blackops3,3d0ev7,RodneyHFarva,4,Sun Jul 12 17:31:51 2015 UTC,Why are you acting like PlayStation fans and Xbox fans are enemies? Grow up man.

I just want to move on and have fun in a beta which I now believe should be as long as possible for everyone, regardless of console exclusivity.

blackops3,3d075f,Dainathon,9,Sun Jul 12 13:11:55 2015 UTC,Depends how it's implemented. If the match starts off during the day time and transitions to night then it wouldn't look right. However giving each map multiple times of day and they are randomised before loading then that wouldn't be too bad.

Me and my cousin use the thing where you make each other's Xbox your home Xbox so you can share games you get digitally. This is easier cause we can just split the price of games or I'll pay for one then he'll pay for the next.
blackops3,3d0mxb,Savid5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:48:49 2015 UTC,Regular disc edition.  I got special editions of Ghosts & AW. Both games were shit and I stopped playing before the first DLC on each game came out (thus wasting the extra money for season pass).  I don't care much about zombies and already have a mini fridge (one that doesn't make silly noises). If I like BO3 as much as I liked BO2 then I'll just buy the SP later. I'm not getting burned for a third time.
blackops3,3d0mxb,Gionta1222,0,Sun Jul 12 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"ghosts and aw were bad games tho, you could just tell they were gonna be kind of bland. As for getting special edition ""if you feel like it"", good luck. Were still a few months away from release and jug edition is sold out"
blackops3,3d0mxb,BigCockMcLong,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:04:55 2015 UTC,I meant I will just buy the season pass as and when I feel like it. I'm going to skip on the special editions completely this year.  There is nothing that really appeals to me in the Jugg edition or the Hardened edition. (Because I'm not the biggest Zombies fan).
blackops3,3d0mxb,kloops,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:23:27 2015 UTC,Did they say how much memory the game and install will take up? That's the one reason I usually don't buy games digitally.
blackops3,3d0mxb,N9Nz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:31:47 2015 UTC,Disk or digital will be the same if your getting it on Xb1 or PS4. And ive heard it will be around 40-50 GB.

blackops3,3d14n2,oliman22,5,Sun Jul 12 17:32:17 2015 UTC,It's probably going to sell more. A lot of old fans are getting back into the games because Treyarch simply makes the best CODs. I'm going to guess around 1.5m-2.5m
blackops3,3d14n2,snipeftw,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Most COD pc players will try the beta. If it's anywhere as fun as BO2 it will likely be one of the more successful COD on pc.   If it runs well and on a wide range of systems, has good pc specific features then it will sell well.   Likely no cod will ever sell as well as the old ones due to no TRUE dedicated server support."
blackops3,3d14n2,henryguy,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"Now Treyarch does, but CoD4 and MW2 according to the Veteran CoD community, are the best in the series"
blackops3,3d14n2,dukezap1,2,Mon Jul 13 05:03:16 2015 UTC,MW2 maybe on consoles. It was broken as hell on PC. Only thing it did well was optimization.

blackops3,3d14n2,iTARIS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:55 2015 UTC,I'd be suprised tbh if it sells more than Ghosts.

blackops3,3d14n2,LifeHated,2,Sun Jul 12 19:57:07 2015 UTC,AW sold 400k less than Ghosts though.
blackops3,3d14n2,henryguy,5,Sun Jul 12 20:01:53 2015 UTC,Because they expected it to be good as BO2 then found out IW makes shit PC versions and no one knew how AW was Ganna be so they decided not to buy it after what happened to Ghosts
blackops3,3d14n2,Nytrofactor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"Over half of ghost buyers couldn't even play for weeks after launch. Single player cutscenes were laggy and still are.   I have a buddy who to this day still hasn't been able to play load the game, at all."
blackops3,3d14n2,Nytrofactor,5,Mon Jul 13 01:22:05 2015 UTC,I feel it will succeed due to Treyarchs's history with PC.
blackops3,3d14n2,henryguy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Well BO2 still sold a lot less than MW3.
blackops3,3d14n2,ThingsUponMyHead,3,Sun Jul 12 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"It only sold well because MW2 was so popular. I don't think Black Ops was as popular a game as MW2, so BO2 sold less; also MW3 likely turned many people off from buying BO2"
blackops3,3d14n2,SEJIBAQUI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"COD players are divided as well. Some love mw but hate blops. And vice versa. My buddy hates blops but I love it.

blackops3,3d14n2,runealex007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"Bingo! MW2 was THE shooter at the time. Everybody was playing it, so it only makes sense that its sequel would have been just as good. And when MW3 flopped and BO2 was revealed to be in the future, a lot of people gave up on CoD and BO2. Although if you look at reviews, BO2 is praised just as much as MW2 if not more."
blackops3,3d14n2,tbertuzzi44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think the more important factor than sales is the prolonged life of the game.  Here we see that Black Ops 2 has the most active players at around 7k, while MW3 has about 4k.  However, they both beat AW, which only has about 3.5k and has just about the same player count as MW2.  The only other CoD game on that list is WaW, with no mention of CoD4, BO1, or Ghosts."
blackops3,3d14n2,tbertuzzi44,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Cod4 is not on the list because most people have it on disk. Same with WaW, though that game has recently gained a popularity with people discovering that custom maps are a thing."

blackops3,3d14n2,AppyHappyLad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:36:56 2015 UTC,Most likely like AW it's gonna go below 10k rather fast.
blackops3,3d14n2,AppyHappyLad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. AW had zero PC support and many (literal and hyperbolic) game-breaking issues were constantly ignored by the development team. Mouse polling rates not being supported, terrible matchmaking giving people ""no games found"" during peak hours, the EM1 frame rate exploit, awful optimization for hardware, the list goes on and on. Treyarch has already been more generous 6 months before launch with features and information that SH wouldn't even disclose days before launch. This is a sign that they will give at least some fucks about the PC community. Treyarch even has a dedicated PC version liaison in @pcdev."
blackops3,3d14n2,CoreyHitlerPerry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:47:10 2015 UTC,Well one can hope that it keeps the amount of players as it had during BO2 with a average of about 15-20k during the lifetime.

Now if you slap on mod support for PC it will bring a lot more interest into the game. PC players love mod support."

blackops3,3d4515,phantom1942,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:56 2015 UTC,Battlefield. Where there is less five year olds screaming at you or their mom or even your mom.
blackops3,3d4515,KindOfOk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, this is just troll speak. Unless you are an extremely picky person, there are plenty of other good FPS games, Titanfall being one of them. Of course there is Battlefield, Halo, Destiny, Killzone, Evolve, CS:GO, Crysis, etc. Those are just some of the more recent titles, mind you. Pick your poison, because there is no shortage of it.   If you truly believe there are no other good FPS titles, you need to open your eyes and broaden your palette. The reason CoD is the most popular is because of it's pedigree. It's been around a long time, and has built (and maintained) a rabid fan base. It also appeals to the largest grouping of people, because it takes the least amount of skill to play. If you pick any other FPS, the skill gap will be noticeably larger. CoD is for casual gamers as much as it is for MLG. That can't be said for Halo, Titanfall, Destiny, or CS:GO. Those games have a much greater skill gap, scaring away casual gamers and small children."
blackops3,3d4515,YourFavPsycho,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"I assumed he was talking strictly about consoles because if not...  Anyway, for PS4/XB1 there's only a few shooters worth playing right now. CoD AW, BF, and Destiny (if that's your style). Titanfall is pretty much unpopulated at this point anyway, and I must admit I didn't go back to MCC after the way it flopped when they released it.  Also, Destiny definitely doesn't take much skill with the supers giving you free kills multiple times a match."
blackops3,3d4515,KindOfOk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I strictly used examples from console for that reason, because PC is a different beast altogether.   You are completely correct on the next gen consoles. That's the unfortunate price we pay during the transitional period. Even taking Titanfall out of the mix, there are still 3 massive choices. The supers help, but it still takes more skill overall than a scrub with noobtubes and thermal LMG hahaha.   In another couple of years we will see plenty more FPS releases. Just look at the lineup from E3. New games like Rainbow Six, DOOM, and others will be presenting themselves here in the near future. Plus Titanfall 2, more Destiny, Battlefield, Halo 5, etc. There is no shortage of FPS options, if you are willing to expand your interests a little bit."
blackops3,3d4515,YourFavPsycho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"Well I never claimed that CoD takes much skill ;).  I'm ready for some more saturation on the new consoles though. Tom Clancy games and the ones you've already mentioned should spice it up a good bit. The games that have been released all have some major flaws that make me put them down months at a time. Only games that haven't made me do that so far are Witcher 3, MLB the Show 15, and Dying Light. The FPS genre in particular has let me down so far."
blackops3,3d4515,KindOfOk,2,Mon Jul 13 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"Good games are coming. There is always a rough transitional period between generations. You'll get a couple decent launch games and then you have to wait. Luckily, we have massive lineups for both XB1 and PS4 over the next couple of years. E3 gave us plenty to salivate over, not just in the FPS genre but across the board."

blackops3,3cyai3,TheInactiveWall,15,Sun Jul 12 15:11:47 2015 UTC,Im so confused. Why did Origins Richtofen kill Original Richtofen? Does this destroy the original timeline? Did the events of Moon even happen anymore? Why were the Orgins crew at Der Riese anyway? How did they get to Der Riese? Why do the other 3 origins guys refer to Richtofen as the terrible evil? What about the reveal that the entire story of zombies is just Sam and Eddie playing with toys? Are we playing as toys still or is this in the world that we see at the end of the Origins easter egg? So many questions..

blackops3,3cyai3,Rabiddd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:29:10 2015 UTC,Same was on Origins and we couldn't use it. I hope we can't use it here too because that will mean every character has an ability and that would ruin the classic zombies feeling.
blackops3,3cyai3,wbjari,10,Sun Jul 12 08:49:15 2015 UTC,The whole toy thing was a misdirection by Treyarch which alot of people were saying at the time but no one wanted to listen. That is essentially 1 of the timelines that currently exist. There are 3 timelines going right now. Der Riese to Moon and moon to buriedexcluding MotD timeline(black ops 1 and 2) Essentially the OG timeline. There is the kids paying timeline that is also the timeline I believe SoE will be taking place in. Them there is the third timeline Origins to The Giant. Where the young characters are trying to prevent the OG timeline from happening. By the end of Blops 3 DLC Shit is gonna hit the fan and my hope is that these three timelines are going to intersect and cause a whole big catastrophe
blackops3,3cyai3,CyKoToaster,2,Sat Jul 11 23:18:18 2015 UTC,"After the new crew helped either Richtofen or Maxis in BO2, Sam was sent back into Agartha in 1918, creating a stable time loop. By bringing his past self into the present in a new loop of The Giant, Richtofen is establishing a new timeline."
blackops3,3cyai3,ChronicRedhead,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:17:51 2015 UTC,They might not have known what was on the other side themselves. Didn't they say you don't know what evil you might release or something like that?

I think the last time I used barriers and kept rebuilding them for protection was probably in the Warden's office in MOTD."
blackops3,3d1lel,flipperkip97,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:44 2015 UTC,It makes sense that there would be little to no barriers. Buried and Origins both didn't have many barricades. Only a few near the spawn rooms.

Fair warning: there's quite a bit of lore. Each map has its own secrets, its own side quests, but don't let that ovewhelm you, there's lots of fascinating stuff to dive into.   And, as of now, everything links together. No matter how thin a thread or stretched it might seem, every map has a narrative connection of some sort."
blackops3,3cyje0,dontcallitjelly,5,Sat Jul 11 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"Read through it all.  Had a laugh at the part where Zombies invaded the Pentagon.    However, pretty well written and explains a lot.  One question though, is all this information complied directly from every single Zombies DLC, or is there lore in the comic books released by Treyarch that is not available in the actual game?"
blackops3,3cyje0,RdJokr,3,Sun Jul 12 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"There aren't any Zombies comics that I'm aware of. Most story intel are there in the maps themselves.  I would suggest reading the Wikipedia synopsis (for Black Ops 1 and 2). I did contribute to it a bit, and right now it's a pretty solid, coherent summary of the main events that have happened. For any further details, you can look at the Call of Duty Wikia page."
blackops3,3cyje0,dontcallitjelly,2,Sun Jul 12 05:27:35 2015 UTC,hmm. not sure about additional lore aside from the different maps. all the info compile there is from maps+easter eggs
blackops3,3cyje0,CyKoToaster,4,Sun Jul 12 04:19:20 2015 UTC,And it's only going to be getting better. With the introduction of The Giant and them apparently trying to correct the mistakes can't wait to see more lore pop up in the future

blackops3,3cyje0,bruh_dinosaurs,5,Sun Jul 12 02:26:55 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that every person out there has a different theory on the story. So reading too many different things just confuses me.
blackops3,3cyje0,KarmaMJO,4,Sun Jul 12 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"You should watch the 4 hour documentary on Youtube, trust me, it is worth it. But to get to the mind fucking part, The Original zombies universe ends with Richthofen and Maxis fighting over control of the Aether. Rich wants to control the zombies and use earth as his playground, Maxis just wants to reunite with his daughter. They are unaware that Sam was sent back in time to another universe where WW1 was diesel punk, due to the time and space distorting effects of 115.  Sam started contacting the Original Doctor Maxis (Old man) to help her escape Agartha. The original Richthofen was a recently graduated college student. His mentor was Doctor Maxis. When Richthofen's parents died, Maxis tried to become a parent figure to Richthofen. He helped Doctor Maxis and the Original Group 935 in Excavation site 64, France. They discovered 115 and Maxis named it ""Divinium."" After Sam's contact with Maxis and claims that she was his future daughter, he became semi-crazy and Richthofen was getting worried about him. Group 935 started digging and found tunnels underneath the ground, waking up the Templar zombies that existed beneath, which were controlled by the Ancient Evil, aka Satan, part of the Agartha dimension. It is revealed that the original zombie eye color is blue-ish to purple. Many Group 935 members started to disappear or others would find their dead bodies. Maxis was infected with 115 and soon, he succumbed to the zombie disease. Before this, Maxis had little hope for Germany in WW1, so he contacted the US about what was going on, resulting in the arrival of Tank Dempsey to investigate. Nikolai was sent from Russia to investigate Germany's plans in France, and so was Takeo from Japan, an honorable Samurai.  Richthofen cut open Maxis' head and removed his brain before it could be affected by the disease. He placed it in a jar with preserving liquid and hooked it up to a Quad-rotor. Maxis was surprised that he was no longer in his physical body, but Richthofen explained it was the only way he would live. With the help of Maxis and the Original 4, Sam was released from Agartha, But in order to do so, they had to enter a portal (forgot if it was the Aether or Agartha, anyways one of these) through the Crazy Place. They were all mortal beings, therefore unable to enter. But Maxis was now basically a robot, so he entered. Once Sam was finally released, she became a God, and the opposite of the Ancient Evil. Sam had all this unimaginable power, but her one true wish was to sacrifice everything to be a little girl again with her father Maxis. She created a universe where this was possible, resulting in the recreation of everybody and deletion of their memories. EXCEPT Maxis. Maxis was the only being able to remember everything since he entered the Portal. Because of this, he became over protective of Samantha, who lost her memory and became a girl again. He sought to recreate Group 935 in that ""new"" universe. He created a clone of Richthofen to honor and reminisce his old friend from the Past universe. After everything, HE SENT Richthofen on a path to re-unite with his old companions Dempsey, Takeo, and Nikolai, who have also had their memories erased. WaW, BO1, and BO2 zombies are you playing as the Richthofen Clone, and the recreations of the Original 4. And the cycle begins again.   Mind fucking isn't it? The whole zombies storyline is one big fucking time loop. Now, BO3 will have a new storyline, where the Original Four are trying to break the loop once they find out that this has all been a loop."
blackops3,3cyje0,KarmaMJO,4,Sun Jul 12 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"Thoroughly fucking my mind.  Jesus Christ, no wonder Zombies fans are so passionate.  The lore and apprehension about finding out what will happen next is ridiculous."
blackops3,3cyje0,Octavi0Hadra,3,Sun Jul 12 03:51:30 2015 UTC,ONE MORE QUESTION:  What the hell was the trailer that was just released at San Diego Comic Con?  The one about the girl in the red dress and the guy with the handlebar mustache during the Roaring 20s?    It's completely unrelated as far as I see.
blackops3,3cyje0,ibleedaftertacobell,3,Sun Jul 12 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"Don't say it is completely unrelated, EVERYTHING is important here, every single map is crucial to the story. It might not seem like it is, but it do."
blackops3,3cyje0,SneaKyGamErr,2,Sun Jul 12 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"Alright. There was a Q&A after the zombie panel at Comic Con and they pretty much said all of the zombie maps are related, so this means that the new map(""Shadows of Evil"") is in the timeline somehow, but I don't think anyone has a great idea how it fits in, but it does. I just put a post before this(I posted it, and refreshed), I think it explains what is going to happen next."
blackops3,3cyje0,CyKoToaster,2,Sun Jul 12 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, you explain pretty much what going on right now. The whole story is a whole loop that never ends, until you break the cycle. This now leads you to Mob of the Dead. The whole story for Mob of the Dead is to break the cycle for the 4 guys because its a never ending loop. So Mob of the Dead tells us that the cycle must be broken for the story to move along. So you will now put the cycle idea to what is said in the post above.  Now we head to the new trailer for ""The Gaint"" which got released today. The trailer shows the Richthofen from Origins come and kill the Richthofen that is stuck in the never ending cycle. THIS SHOULD BREAK the cycle and let us move in the story. This story is really crazy and insane at this point."

As long as you have Black Ops 1 and 2 (All World at War maps are available on Black Ops 1), you can experience all the maps. Playing at least some of these (especially Black Ops 1 maps and Origins) will give you some personal insight on what is happening. Welcome to the Zombies story and community! Enjoy!"

The only thing i dont have is black ops 1 and friends to play zombies with.   Im guessing that playing all bo2 zombies maps solo wont work either? Since i guess you cant get that far in any map solo? I tried it once or twice in bo2's lifespan but only got to like round 10 or whatever solo lol.   Should i try again or wouldnt it be worth to try solo?
blackops3,3cyje0,CyKoToaster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:22:58 2015 UTC,Keep playing just to get better in prep for Blops 3. I was god awful when I started playing (didn't know you could open doors). And now I have thousands of hours played on both zombies. My highest rounds are in the 70's on moon in the 50's on buried. Done all the easter eggs multiple times. Practice makes perfect.   As for the story I would reccomend reading different wiki's and watching youtube videos to fully understand the lore and history of zombies. IT's one of the most in depth well thought out and interesting stories of any video game I have ever played
blackops3,3cyje0,SneaKyGamErr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"I will! Thanks for the motivation :) , but wow thats really amazing dude thats really far that you got :o. Did you get that far and doing easter eggs playing solo? I guess not right? :) .  And for the story , i have read the entire thing on the call of duty wikia allready but its kinda confusing with those characters and the different realms and those 2 or 3 richtofen guys in alternate timelines lol the first time i read it, it made my brain melt lol.   Im about to watch a 4hour long video about the story and lore too and hope that that helps hha.   Thanks for your comment tho! Im definitly gonna start practicing on black ops 2 today hha :D."
blackops3,3cyje0,TheMadManager,2,Sun Jul 12 09:00:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I know what video your talking about it helps a lot with the understanding of the story and the lore. No I got that far with 3 other  people. On moon and buried it was easy because completing the easter egg gave you all the perks for the entire game. Good idea to start practicing with blops 2 it's more difficult than blops 1. What system are you on if you want to play you should add me on xbox GT CyKo Toaster. Ever since the zombies announcement I have started playing again
blackops3,3cyje0,SneaKyGamErr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:07:17 2015 UTC,Oh okay hha i figured you couldnt get that far solo. It really sucks to have no friends to play zombies with :( . And unfortunatly im on ps4 so i cant party up with you either.   I guess im just gonna start playing solo alot on black ops 2 to practice and by the time black ops 3 hits maybe try to find some people online to party up with. I never got into zombies but allways seeing the huge hype around it makes me very eager to start playing it and experience it myself . :)
blackops3,3cyje0,TheMadManager,2,Sun Jul 12 09:18:55 2015 UTC,Easily the most fun i've ever had gaming. Enjoy!
blackops3,3cyje0,SneaKyGamErr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:22:56 2015 UTC,Thanks dude i cant wait :D
blackops3,3cyje0,ibleedaftertacobell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:38:56 2015 UTC,People have gotten as far as 200 in the current maps. But in WAW when it was easier there was someone who got into the thousands.
blackops3,3cyje0,SneaKyGamErr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:58:01 2015 UTC,Wow that is truly insane ! I cant believe how long you'd have to play to get over 1000 rounds :o
blackops3,3cyje0,EddieTheLiar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:38:29 2015 UTC,In WAW there would only be 24 zombies a round so it would only take an hour to get to round 50. Which is extremely short for zombies now a days where it would take about 4-5 hours depending on map. So it would take give or take about. 20 hours to get 1000 hours done but that is still an incredible feat in anyways. But pausing the game and stuff help alot. But nowadays you'd only have over 100 rounds if you played for 20 hours.
blackops3,3cyje0,LackingAGoodName,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Oh i didnt knew that about the 24 round zombies. Doesnt sound to bad then. I can believe now with the increasing size in hords every round it gets amazingly tough after a bit hha. Indeed 20 hours is allready a huge milestone and being able to pauze is definitly needed then if going for such a huge round number hha. I see that they made it significantly harder now.   RoadToRound100     hha :p
blackops3,3cyje0,notacheezyname,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"What platform do you play on? I'd be happy to help you out and play with you if you're the 360. And with some practice, you can get somewhat far in maps solo, but you won't be able to complete the Easter Eggs which give lots of insight to the plot"
blackops3,3d1art,T-9-Wizzy,4,Sun Jul 12 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well tranzit was shit, but Treyarch is pretty good at this shit."
blackops3,3d1art,snipeftw,3,Sun Jul 12 18:32:11 2015 UTC,It was. But I kind of liked it long enough until the first DLC (which wasn't great either after seeing the second DLC).
blackops3,3d1art,flipperkip97,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:08:22 2015 UTC,What made tranzit shit in your opinion? Personaly i loved it.
blackops3,3d1art,st1e,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:56:47 2015 UTC,"I didnt love it either. For me i think it was because of the ""forced traveling"" all over the map."
blackops3,3d1art,EnergonSword,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:43 2015 UTC,"The waiting times, the denizens were annoying. The travelling around the whole map to do anything. It was just a pain in the butt."
blackops3,3d1art,snipeftw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"it was terrible in comparison to all other zombie maps.  it was still kinda fun, and had a couple of interesting things, but it is undeniably worse than every other zombie map.  They all range from ""bad-ass to !!!!!!!!"" though"
blackops3,3d1art,ozarkslam21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"tranzit was limited by the console. They never wanted to put fog in there, they got carried away and now we're under a new manager for zombies"
blackops3,3d1art,RSbooll5RS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:20:52 2015 UTC,I didn't care about the fog tbh.
blackops3,3d1art,snipeftw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:36:27 2015 UTC,Fog=OK. Denizens=I will not ever play this again.
blackops3,3d1art,phantom1942,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much. Like it's not that they're scary, or difficult, they are just so fucking annoying."
blackops3,3d1art,snipeftw,2,Mon Jul 13 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"I think that because Treyarch had an extra year, they'll have the time to put more effort and perfection into their work. Personally, and apparently many others, I disliked BO2 zombies compared to the earlier zombies. I have a feeling I'll enjoy The Giant more than anything else in this year's CoD.  As for AW zombies, they were more challenging (damn exo zombies) and I liked that to a degree, and I actually really liked the first map. The others were just not quite doing it for me."
blackops3,3d1art,ImCodeGreen,2,Sun Jul 12 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Why all the Sledgehammer hate? Exo Zombies wasn't bad. And if I had a dollar for every time someone asked ""people still play this game?"" (AW), I'd be a goddamn millionaire. A lot of people still play AW, yet there's a collective hatred of SH and the game. I cannot comprehend this.  Treyarch is not perfect. Tranzit was shit, plain and simple. Buried was boring and easy. Everything else was good. But it's not as if they've never made a bad map."
blackops3,3d1art,Hypobromite,2,Sun Jul 12 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly I only believe Tranzit wad bad because it was last gen. I remember hearing that the only reason they added fog was because the systems couldnt render everything with out being really buggy. The idea was awsome, so many hilarious times of friends (or myself) missing the bus and having to duke it out while the bus came back. I only didn't like that the areas were so small, if it was on current gen where the areas could be much larger a map like Tranzit would be badass imo."
blackops3,3d1art,BigCockMcLong,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:50:21 2015 UTC,Infinity Ward should get the hate..... Ghosts.....
blackops3,3d1art,phantom1942,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:44:28 2015 UTC,Tranzit was a bad map....
blackops3,3d1art,Shtinky_Menace,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:26 2015 UTC,...that's what I said.
blackops3,3d1art,Hypobromite,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"I think because of the 3 years they had, and the fact that they released next to no info at the July 9th event, that they have a 3rd map on disc waiting to be revealed. Guessing during the next Zombies event around August (Maybe Gamescom)  Because BO1 had Kino, Five, and Dead Ops. Along with the 4 W@W maps remade. Making 6 maps on release day + Dead Ops  And that was just a 2 year dev cycle"
blackops3,3d1art,dukezap1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:08:24 2015 UTC,The remakes were in the last DLC with Moon.
blackops3,3d1art,phantom1942,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:07 2015 UTC,No the Hardened and Prestige edition had them at launch
blackops3,3d1art,dukezap1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:55:50 2015 UTC,"I liked how large tranzit was (compared to the other maps), but after a while, there really wasn't much to it, and you couldn't start from a higher wave.  I am wondering what people don't like about the shadows of evil map / trailer, anyone care to explain?"
blackops3,3d1art,Meat_Sheild,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:15:47 2015 UTC,"Tbh I was pretty underwhelmed with BO2 zombies outside of Origins. Buried was incredibly easy, the high rise map I can't remember the name of was annoying as fuck because of the build tables and Tranzit was horrific."
blackops3,3d1art,thekyle1591,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"I agree but at least I still played those maps a ton. You forgot about Mob of the Dead, that map was a masterpiece."
blackops3,3d1art,thekyle1591,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, MOTD was amazing. My favorite by FAR. Although Origins was incredible as well, I didn't always love how you essentially needed to follow an exact script the first few rounds."
blackops3,3cwtei,brollyssj4,10,Sat Jul 11 13:37:50 2015 UTC,Is it weird that I want to eat this gun because the barrel reminds me of Twizzlers?
blackops3,3cwtei,Xelvet,6,Sat Jul 11 15:18:14 2015 UTC,HA HA HA nice comparison mate .... yea i agree come to think of it
blackops3,3cwtei,Xelvet,4,Sat Jul 11 15:31:50 2015 UTC,Haha I'm thinking of naming my custom variants after the Twizzler flavors because of how I paint the barrel on each to look like the different flavors.
blackops3,3cwtei,RoyalFlush666,3,Sat Jul 11 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"yea dark red barrel color, and white stock"
blackops3,3cwtei,Hypobromite,2,Sat Jul 11 15:50:44 2015 UTC,Except you cant paint the barrel.
blackops3,3cwtei,JessicaBecause,9,Sat Jul 11 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"They're still doing stat bars, huh? I hope they'll have an option to show the actual numbers, cause I hate having to reference a google drive spreadsheet for AW weapons."
blackops3,3cwtei,Hypobromite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:07:26 2015 UTC,I feel bad for newbs that choose their gun based on this alone. The original stat chart in the menu means nothing after all the nerf/buffs.
blackops3,3cwtei,DJvic7,2,Sun Jul 12 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"""Oh, 20 damage!? It must get only one shot kills!""  -Johnny No-Thumbs"
blackops3,3cwtei,JessicaBecause,2,Sun Jul 12 02:39:30 2015 UTC,Treyarch rarely nerfs/buff the weapons unless they really think they need to.
blackops3,3cwtei,DJvic7,2,Sun Jul 12 05:35:10 2015 UTC,It's been awhile how many updates were made to the guns on bo2? Perhaps it's the amount of change from the buff/ needs that has me looking past the stat bars all together.
blackops3,3cwtei,Hypobromite,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:56:50 2015 UTC,"its been a few years but im pretty sure only a handful of guns were nerfed/buffed and a good chunk of updates were for hit detection. back on black ops 1 i can only remember the famas being nerfed and like 2 others, treyarch doesnt listen to the players that bitch and cry over a gun being weak or to op which is why i like them"
blackops3,3cwtei,DJvic7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:15:01 2015 UTC,...and yet one major criticism of AW is how OP the Asm1/Bal is and how they won't nerf it. We are such a bipolar community.
blackops3,3cwtei,MrArmageddon12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:05:06 2015 UTC,I find the asmi and balls weak and sledgehammer doesn't give 2 shits about their game they add worthless guns and exo shit they put all their time trying to make money and they forgot about making their game worth playing 8 months after release hell aw started going to shit 6 months in and they haven't done anything
blackops3,3cwtei,HappyGangsta,15,Sun Jul 12 10:09:16 2015 UTC,The futuristic weapon design looks way better in this than in AW.
blackops3,3cwtei,jameskies,5,Sat Jul 11 15:01:16 2015 UTC,"AW sniping is terrible, and very frustrating and inconsistent."
blackops3,3cwtei,Croesius,2,Sat Jul 11 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"And they buff the damage, when it's the sway that is the problem..."
blackops3,3cwtei,pacothetac0,2,Sat Jul 11 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Damage is still a problem, they just didn't buff it enough. RoF needs an increase, hitmarkers need to be far less frequent and sway could be reduced so ARs aren't dominant at long ranges"
blackops3,3cwtei,swedishbror,5,Sun Jul 12 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"Anyone else not like a bipod that you can't use? Not sure if it is usable in the game (like battlefield), but why even put it on there if it's not actually there? Same for guns which appear to have a built in foregrip, but have a separate foregrip attachment."
blackops3,3cwtei,JessicaBecause,6,Sat Jul 11 19:34:34 2015 UTC,Yuuup Battlefield has spoiled us
blackops3,3cwtei,Ziiner,3,Sat Jul 11 20:33:13 2015 UTC,Imagine with all the paint jobs that I could do with it... I am thinking a white and orange CS:GO skin type sniper paint job.

blackops3,3cwtei,Kolkpen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"like every other COD, it will be the same 98 damage and it will be having multipliers over hit boxes."
blackops3,3cwtei,dimitri2596,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:34:49 2015 UTC,But what about SMGs and ARs meng
blackops3,3cwtei,ElectricSundance,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"that is why we have drift0r and many of us dont have the time or the patience to go into research about stats and stuff, If I wanna know something i just go to Drift0r, he is way better than Spam Martin or ChaosXsellout."
blackops3,3cwtei,notreallysrs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:49:07 2015 UTC,But how is watching a video easier than the numbers just sitting there in game? XD
blackops3,3cwtei,whereisthetrashcan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"yes that is true, but its not as straight as values, there are other factors like multipliers, hit boxes, etc,.. like one gun will do terrible if you body but has a different hitbox multiplier...  for example Chrome Barrel for the snipers had weird hitboxes,  and stats for Pytek loophole is complete wack .. so it might just get a little cluster fuck on the screen... but I do agree with having basic numbers and stuff etc."
blackops3,3cwtei,whereisthetrashcan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:03:17 2015 UTC,Looks like a very futuristic Remington XM2010 sniper rifle. That twist on the barrel tho.

blackops3,3d1w2m,Hypobromite,-12,Sun Jul 12 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"I have played advanced warfare, just not alot in the past few months. I couldn't remember because I'm pretty sure I never ran far enough to potentially run out of sprint without boosting or sliding. No need to be an ass about things."
blackops3,3d1w2m,FuXs-,14,Sun Jul 12 22:53:35 2015 UTC,You just explained why unlimited sprint wont be a big deal. :)

blackops3,3d1w2m,JayT2,8,Sun Jul 12 21:40:43 2015 UTC,It should have always been like this. Like Battlefield.
blackops3,3d1w2m,wilderanch,2,Sun Jul 12 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"difference is, battlefield maps are huge. So unlimited sprint is a must in battlefield."
blackops3,3d1w2m,Yartinstein,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:34:55 2015 UTC,This! Just this week I discovered TDM in Battlefield and it opened my eyes to the glory of the whole game!   DMRs ftw!!

blackops3,3d1w2m,SuicidalCat,6,Sun Jul 12 22:16:41 2015 UTC,but then stamin up would be useless :(
blackops3,3d1w2m,DJvic7,2,Sun Jul 12 23:10:25 2015 UTC,Nah Staminup still increases overall movement speed!
blackops3,3d1w2m,chromastone10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:18 2015 UTC,No stamin up will let you run faster
blackops3,3d1w2m,jacob2815,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:32:51 2015 UTC,It gave you light wait and extra sprint time
blackops3,3d1w2m,DJvic7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:08 2015 UTC,"Well idk about BO2 but I know that in BO1 and WaW, sprinting wasn't necessary. Because your fastest jogging speed was faster then the zombies. So you don't need sprint to escape the zombies. Although that may change with the addition of unlimited sprint"
blackops3,3d1w2m,sansol2100,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:37 2015 UTC,It was more of an inconvenience and annoyance

blackops3,3d1w2m,henryguy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"I feel as though the Exo suits balances it out, so the unlimited sprint won't make a major difference. I see most people slide or boost than run anyway.  I would really like unlimited sprint because for as long as I could remember, one of my perk slot was always filled up with marathon."
blackops3,3d1w2m,zen_master87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"Well technically they should tire due to the stress of helping the thrusters being tiring. Pushing off a building while you walk up, even with thrusters, would tire your ass out. Even if you exercised heavily 3 hours a day on average.  I think the maps will be small enough that it won't matter. The beta gameplay footage I've seen the maps are lots of narrow and wide lanes separated by walls with lots of entry ways. I only saw a couple big focal points that are bad to be in or covering for long.  The trick will be to learn when you should be running and when you should walking ""on guard mode."""
blackops3,3d1w2m,FuXs-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"I think this is a more natural way to add faster gameplay for those that think cod can never be too fast.  If the netcode and lag comp are optimized correctly this will all balance out as the non stop rushing players sloooooowly begin to learn once again that a fixed player who has anticipated your carelessness and route does and should have an advantage over you barreling around every corner and through every door way with your gun down.  aw rewarded this because it was a very poorly thought out and made game, a well made game will punish this foolish player behavior once again."

blackops3,3d2w1e,dukezap1,7,Mon Jul 13 05:13:28 2015 UTC,"It did happen a lot and you probably don't remember it much because none of it was directed towards you. Yes the exclusivity deal started all of this, but the hate between the Playstation and Xbox users mainly comes from the Xbox people having rubbed it in other peoples faces  for years. Laughing, and saying how everything else is shit because they are the lead console and so on, this has now built up to the point that a lot of people actually hate each other over consoles for this game. o.O The playstation users are getting their own back but I dare say it will calm down sooner or later, and of course a few people will keep rubbing it into others faces.   I have always been on Playstation but have never been bothered by the taunts, if anything I ignored them. I am looking forward to getting the DLC early for once however, people on the Xbox have always had longer to play with the stuff in the COD games."
blackops3,3d2w1e,Tenshi-01,0,Mon Jul 13 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"but the hate between the Playstation and Xbox users mainly comes from the Xbox people having rubbed it in other peoples faces for years   Yeah, some guy in Titanfall would not shut up about the exclusivity deal having switched to PlayStation. He claimed to have been a PlayStation fan since time immoral, but switched to Xbox for last-gen (well, I guess current-gen?) but just wouldn't stop saying how much he didn't care and how stupid it was because Xbox had more CoD fans.  No, actually, PlayStation does XD"

Walking around with your eyes closed is fine as long as you don't try and cut people down because of your own ignorance.

Some people are chapped about exclusivity, but what i have seen is relatively tame, mostly blindly directed at some corporate entity or another.  I just can't imagine getting upset about someone disrespecting my console.    Buy both consoles that way you never miss out on anything, its the way to go.  On these forums at least, i actually find myself in agreement with most of the posters... they tend to be Trey fans and lean more towards traditional cod, unless a advanced warfare fan sneaks in here, then of course anything they say i file immediately under brain damaged :)"
blackops3,3d2w1e,KindOfOk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:33 2015 UTC,1 month early DLC... Think of it like a beta test. Or.... we Xbox and PlayStation guys can drop our fanboyism and 1. Congratulate the PS dudes/ladies for early COD DLC. 2. STFU and get over each other. I could care less about how many P's i got on my game so long as it looks really good and is fun. Take Battlefield 4 for example. I play the CTE on PC and normally play on Xbone. There is no big difference at all. I would have a problem if my game ran at 480p on the Xbox but that hasn't happened. Instead of fighting over tiny little squares why don't we fight over lackluster content from dev's and publishers. Or stop pre-ordering for games that are questionable. /rantover

blackops3,3cx2f1,Tenshi-01,3,Sat Jul 11 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"They probably released the first set as a trial run/batch. This way if it sold out they could release more, or if it didn't then they didn't waste to much money.  Honestly with the last few games being not as good as other games, they may have not suspected that the special editions would sell out so quickly. I mean, they lasted a day I think then most or all were gone.  They will probably release more since they also won't like the people that have bought multiples of them, only to sell them for a lot more on ebay and so on. :P"

Called the only other 2 stores with 100 miles both were sold out as well. Amazon is sold out too and I refuse to pay a scalper on eBay. Complete and total bullshit.

It generates hype for the product in the game.  Studies have shown that models like this make more money. When people are clawing each other's eyes out for the $200 edition of the game, the $110, $80, and $60 games don't seem so bad and more people are willing to pay for them.   To the people who are saying ""Don't worry, they'll make more"", I hope you're right. However, during the ""Care Packages"" special edition of Black Ops 2, they never made more. They were in less demand so they took a lot longer to sell out, but it was still just one batch."

They're losing money by not making more and I don't think Activision is going to have that.

At best, they will give us the same half-assed modtools Blops1 had, but I doubt they will do even that, because the requirements for modtools are community hosted servers. If they were to give us modtools, they have to give us serverfiles and a serverbrowser too. After all these years, do you really think Activision will allow this?"
blackops3,3cx7jv,vollcorn,3,Sat Jul 11 20:41:18 2015 UTC,So much misinformation in one post.
blackops3,3cx7jv,Brandalf_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:04:03 2015 UTC,please enlighten me
blackops3,3cx7jv,vollcorn,0,Sun Jul 12 06:48:37 2015 UTC,"the requirements for modtools are community hosted servers.   Completely false.   If they were to give us modtools, they have to give us serverfiles and a serverbrowser too.    Also completely false.  Your lack of knowledge about how modding works is blinding."
blackops3,3cx7jv,Brandalf_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:05:27 2015 UTC,"Completely false.   Of course you don't need your own server for modding per se, but if you get modtools, where are you going to run your mods on? Your local machine?    Also completely false.   Then tell me, where are you going to deploy your mod/map? Where can I find servers with mods running? How do you expect to set up such a server without serverfiles? Do you plan to inject ""mods"" on official servers like they did on MW3? (edit: which was basically restricted to a few dvar changes)"
blackops3,3cx7jv,vollcorn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, the mods themselves are files installed on your local machine, just like all the other game files or DLC.  It's quite simple, all they need to do is have a separate playlist that allows mods. Would likely be mods that are uploaded/downloaded through some sort of official source such as Steam workshop. Then the devs regularly update the playlist to include new mod X, Y, or Z. In terms of implementation it could work almost exactly like official DLC already does. If player X does not have mod Y then they can't match with player Z."
blackops3,3cx7jv,Brandalf_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats the most inefficient way of distributing mods ever. This would require contant updating and version checking on both the players als well as the official servers side. Who decides what mods the servers run? What if I want to make my own submod, will there be a hundered diferent submods of the same mod in the official playlist? How do I change settings for a mod? How fast will the mod-playlists be updated? How long will they update the playlist? Until the next CoD comes out? What then?   If you really think they will do something like this you are insane."
blackops3,3cx7jv,vollcorn,0,Sun Jul 12 09:18:15 2015 UTC,"Well for all we know they may go to a route like they did with Modern Warfare 3, which did have a dedicated server browser for UNRANKED matches.  It is on the table and for all we know there could be a server browser. But then again there may not be.  Well its all on the table, we can't make the calls which Activision are making. If you look at COD4 - Mods kept the game alive, maybe they have noticed. But like a few months ago when Drift0r visited Treyarch, he mentioned PC was mentioned in almost all the presentation slides, maybe they reevaluated their business model. Who knows."
blackops3,3cx7jv,ImChrisP,0,Sat Jul 11 21:22:17 2015 UTC,I really hope so. I think being able to play custom Zombies maps alone would make the PC sales of BO3 skyrocket.
blackops3,3cx7jv,SirVyval,-7,Sat Jul 11 22:12:47 2015 UTC,"If they put custom maps in, they better make it on consoles aswell. I pre-ordered for PS4 for the early DLC, but i don't want to pay $159.98 to get both versions. Maybe in the future if there was a sale or something."
blackops3,3cx7jv,mindbloun,2,Sat Jul 11 16:37:11 2015 UTC,You do be know the map tool Radiant wouldn't work on Xbox or PS4 right?  You literally need a keyboard and mouse. So unless Treyarch ports over user made maps it won't happen just buy the PC version if you want user generated content.
blackops3,3cx7jv,SoulTaker669,0,Sat Jul 11 17:35:15 2015 UTC,IIRC the mod tools are typically free on steam so you can create for things you don't own. Don't know if that would apply with BO3 if they do have mod tools though.
blackops3,3cx7jv,SnowflakeNinjaX,-6,Sat Jul 11 20:17:26 2015 UTC,Costume game and mod tools are age old features of PC gaming. Sell the PS4 and join us PC gamers. You won't regret it. Here are some sub-reddits to help you get started. /r/buildapc/ /r/pcmasterrace/

I wouldn't doubt it if Activision/Treyarch waited until after release and possibly even DLC season to give us mod tools.

blackops3,3czrd1,jacob2815,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"Right, so assume all cod players play on console?  Mw2 pc didn't have dedicated servers which is why I mentioned that he picked the wrong game if he were on pc."

Because the vast majority of people do play on console, if you encounter someone who plays, it's a very safe bet to assume that they play on consoles. That's just how things work."

And I checked every single one of them, ended up going to the completely southern side of NJ (what state im from) and didnt even realize it.  Overall, im very pissed off cuz I never owned any collectors editions so I just might end up not buying it at all. Since im not get anything cool and only have to get the generic version, why put down money now?"

An employer there told me that they received an email from higher ups saying the problem would be fixed the day after and that I should get there before they even opened next day if I wanted to get my hands on one.   There were three people that got there (including myself) before the doors opened wanting to preorder it. Only two of us got one (one for Xbox One and one for PS4). I'm also sure there were other people calling and coming in throughout the rest of the day trying to get it.  These things are in high demand; I doubt there's any shady business going on."

blackops3,3cveke,PingPongx,16,Sat Jul 11 02:57:21 2015 UTC,Just because the video camera can record in 720 doesn't mean the quality of the video is good. It's still someone recording a screen. the quality of the trailer itself is not high definition.

The thing that still confuses me is why a map with such a major plot twist is a bonus map. Its like if they made Tranzit bonus map and put Nuketown Zombies on disk."
blackops3,3cveke,MDRox99,2,Sat Jul 11 04:51:32 2015 UTC,I was wondering that too. Why put part of the story behind a pay wall like that? I can only assume we are going to get it free eventually but that really sucks.

blackops3,3cveke,runealex007,2,Sat Jul 11 05:32:49 2015 UTC,"Nikolai says ""only an idiot would try to change (rewrite) history"" so maybe origins and canon story lines have merged and origins Ww1 Richtofen is trying to stop ww2 Richtofen from pursuing the events of the canon storyline"
blackops3,3cveke,YourLittleBrothers,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:05:45 2015 UTC,This is what I'm thinking as well. Treyarch can completely rewrite zombies with the original 4 now.
blackops3,3cveke,ultranicky,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:52:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. I love the original crew way too much.
blackops3,3cveke,albinogoron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"When the Origins crew gets sucked up into Agartha, clearly Richtofen gets seperated somehow. And somehow (Aged) Richtofen knows this and he teleports him into this universe (the universe with the original story; at this point in the story, it seems Richtofen has just teleported Maxis and Samantha). (Origins) Richtofen knows what the (Aged) Richtofen does in the future (Origins Richtofen isn't schizophrenic yet, so he realizes what he does is wrong), so he puts one into his head.  Now the only part I don't understand is why the Origins crew is there if they aren't there to change the future. Samantha sent them there to make sure the story continues as usual. Which doesn't make much sense, considering her dad isn't her dad yet, he's  a flying brain, and they're both stuck in Agartha.  Something's off though, as you can see the clock stops at 2:15 instead of 1:15, as per usual on Der Riese. There's definitely a reason why they showed that."
