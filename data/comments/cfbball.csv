cfbball,34r6bd,dialhoang,5,Sun May 3 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"The basic concept of the H8belt is that the belt is in play every time the team that holds it plays a game (just like the College Football Belt). If the belt holder wins, it retains the belt, but if it loses, then it loses the belt to the team that won.  I chose September 15, 2014 as the starting date because that was when /u/twooaktrees (now /u/Old--Scratch) posted the famous comic, ""Hello, Darkness my old friend""."

So, when UGA loses to, say, UF they then lose the belt. But Florida wouldn't lose it to, say, Georgia Southern. No matter how hilarious that would be.  That'll keep it from becoming wrapper up with the belt from the main sub, and add a unique twist to it as well."
cfbball,34r6bd,TheCid,2,Sun May 3 21:43:22 2015 UTC,That's interesting. Let me think about it.  We might even end up having two belts...
cfbball,34r6bd,Old--Scratch,1 point,Sun May 3 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"OK /u/Old--Scratch and /u/TheCid, I've thought about your proposals for the Belt, and I have several questions/concerns.   What is a rivalry? Things like Michigan/Ohio State and Alabama/Auburn obviously count, but what about instances where a rivalry is relatively new, ""dead"" (e.g. Texas/Texas A&M), or where one or both of the fan bases don't care? What happens to a team like West Virginia, where conference relocation has separated it from its rivals and the team has yet to form new ones? If we do decide to keep it to rivalry games then the Belt might not make it outside the eastern half of the U.S. I would like every team in U.S. eligible, at least in theory, for the Belt. As an alternative to limiting Belt challenges to rivalry games, how about limiting them to games between P5 schools instead?   I look forward to hearing your responses sometime soon.  EDIT for username of Old--Scratch."
cfbball,34r6bd,melonologist,2,Mon May 4 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"Making it rivalry and Bowl games would let it leave the east coast more easily if that's a concern, but I suspect it would work its way around over time even without that criteria.

cfbball,33hpxm,A-Stu-Ute,11,Wed Apr 22 16:46:07 2015 UTC,"Question that this might be a good forum for:  the stickers have been a big hit so far, and there have been a few requests for /r/CFBBall Stickers.  I think this is probably something we want to do eventually, but there are a few questions to answer first:   We need a ""canonical"" version of a ball for each team We need to decide what resolution to have them at.  The whole idea is that they're a bit MS Painty, and so not necessarily a clean crisp image.  The three options for a sticker would be:    Cleaning up the images and still making them irregular, but clean crisp vector graphics Leaving them as they are, which would be a bit blurry at 300 dpi Making them look more pixel art-y, with smallish square pixels making up the image.    We also need to gauge if there's enough interest.  I think there is, and Stickermule has made some of this easier for us.  If we do push through on this, we'll probably save the launch for a special event.   A subset of that problem is that we'd like to add canonical versions of CFBBalls for inline flair.  We currently have 24.  A slightly related question is whether the user flairs in this sub should have CFBBalls instead of team logos, and when asked in the past the answer was no, but the flair resolution is higher now.  So that's many questions, we'd love feedback!"

cfbball,33hpxm,Honestly_,6,Wed Apr 22 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"I've got a rough canon that I stick to, and a lot of that seems to have been carried on to other folks.  That said, it's only really solid for most FBS teams, not all. I'd be happy to scribble them up in a table by conference, or something. But I'd suggest taking a long look at alternatives to mine for teams outside the SEC and outside the regular (more or less) top 40 teams over the last five seasons. I know no one wants to split hairs on that kind of thing, but I don't want anyone to feel like they had a better idea, especially if they know a particular team better than me.   As to the format for flair, I'd totally wear a ball character flair for this particular sub. The resolution isn't all that important to me, though. Most of them can be easily distinguished by any regular readers.   The only thing I'd stick to with regards to that is that we avoid making each ball character the exact same shape, if possible. Keep to the ideal of ""no circle tool"" and stuff.  As to the OP, I can't really commit to that kind of project, unfortunately. I'd love to, but I just can't guarantee I wouldn't wind up having to shit out of it at some point."

cfbball,33hpxm,bakonydraco,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"This plays well into what I wanted to do. My original idea was that I'd make each image in a way that it has some countdown number, but each ball would be separate enough to make it into a twitter avatar or something similar with minimal cropping.  I can make the images pretty well in paint, and then I'll figure out how to make it in a vector format as well and make those available.  The only issue with this is that if a design is rejected as 'canon', a replacement would be needed.  I've already done a bunch of these, so I have a starting point on ideas, but obviously some are good and some are bad.  I guess the community would need to provide decent feedback on which ones would work and which wouldn't."

The largest muster ceremony occurs in Reed Arena, on the Texas A&M campus.  The ""Roll Call for the Absent"" commemorates Aggies, alumni and current students, who died that year. Aggies light candles, and friends and families of Aggies who died that year answer “here” when the name of their loved one is “called”. Campus muster also serves as a 50th year class reunion for the corresponding graduating class.  Some non-campus muster ceremonies do not include the pageantry of the campus ceremony, and might consist simply of a barbecue.     Image i - 2007 Aggie Muster at Reed Arena.

cfbball,32lp7u,dialhoang,12,Tue Apr 14 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"Trim was lounging at home after a long day, watching the grass in his backyard grow. You could be forgiven for thinking that he was bored, but for Trim, who dedicated his whole life to the study of grass, it was the most exciting thing in the world, no matter how many times he saw it.    Suddenly, there was a sharp knock at the front door. Trim went over to the door, a little annoyed at the interruption to his daily routine.    What he saw at the front door terrorized him.    Trim came face to face with a crazed Wake Forest fan with bloodshot eyes, a stranger to him and still unidentified to the authorities.    ""Hate feeds the Demon Deacon,"" uttered the Wake Forest fan.    Trim slammed the door shut and ran away, but the Wake Forest fan barged down the door and chased Trim several yards into the home.    As of yet, the police refuse to release any indication of how Trim met his fate. But, according to witnesses, when the Wake Forest fan exited Trim's home, he seemed to be wearing Trim's face like a ski mask.      In all seriousness, Trimchaser has deleted his account, but most likely he's OK and well. I just did this comic because I remembered /u/i_fap_to_anything's comment when /u/hydrohydro asked where he had went."

Dude, drive from anywhere else in the state to Columbia, you see so many corn and soybean fields it's ridiculous. Hell, the top half of the state is almost all that. The bottom half a little less so, because it is more of the Ozarks region.  Beyond KC, STL, CoMo, Springfield, Branson, St. Joseph and maybe you can count Joplin, Missouri is almost strictly rural.

cfbball,2s9phn,Bucket58,4,Thu Jan 15 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I may eat my words... but I'm looking forward to the game. A lot of people think it's going to be a blow out. I think it's going to be very close down to the wire and could go either way. Despite our record this year we have a very good team. We were devastated by injuries and played an incredible number of true freshmen. We don't lose very many if anyone of major importance to the draft or graduation. So we should see a healthy full squad. We also pride ourselves on stopping the run, something Oregon could not do. With a less productive run game, we can squeeze your receivers a little tighter giving even Heisman contending QB's trouble.   Maybe I'm just being a major fan boy, but if we stay healthy I'm confident we have a legitimate shot at winning against the buckeyes in Lane Stadium but also a very realistic shot at not only winning the coastal but taking the ACC.   It's going to be a long offseason  EDIT: The key to our success next year lies with how well our O-line can protect the QB (whoever may get the starting job) and if we can establish a run game. If we can do that, we should at the very least finish with 10 wins."

One of the big problems with Mexico CFBball is that everything is branch campuses, sometimes on a national scope, and all with the same mascot and colors. (I have this problem with Tec — I've only done Monterrey because I have to figure out how to do all these unique Ram-type variations. ALL of them.)  The gear is used for the teams from the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, a massive vocational school which has a massive gear in its logo.  The branch campus problem is a big one. Pumas Acatlán I have with alt uni colors because they are an UNAM branch campus (UNAM is massive on a scale not seen in the United States). The two UAT schools have very different designs."

I gave Louisville its enormous beak with teeth because it's so odd (birds? teeth?) and also because I have a humorous personal connection to it.  I hurt my head in 2006 (was pushed in middle school, no fun) and had to go to a pediatric urgent care. The room I was in had a sports theme. There was a street sign saying ""Cardinals Way"" (something like this). In my dazed and hurt state, even I realized something was wrong.  Yes, in Arizona, they had bought a piece of Louisville licensed merchandise. Wrong Cardinals."

Third, I think a lot of the UGA faithful are blowing the hedges mutilation out of proportion, we tore up their field a couple years back and they've taken hedge clippings before. I think it's a nice spark in a fizzling out rivalry, to take a souvenir from the rivals stadium after winning on the road.

This will be 2 desperate teams in a bum fight/cage match... even better: The scene is an underground illegal fight taking place in a seedy basement in SE Asia. Lots of people smoking, screaming, waving fists, and exchanging cash as two desperate, way-past-their-prime fighters battle for their amusement (hey, Vegas will have people betting) and for the sake of the fight because there's nothing left for them to live for other than the battle itself. Lots of potential here. I get Deer Hunter vibes on top of everything else--maybe have some long lost friend of SMU come in to try and talk sense to their old war comrade (from the SWC days?) only the Mustangs are too far gone. A beautifully told tragedy.  TCU at an arcade trying to beat their high score on the Big 12 game. The previous was TTU, now they play Iowa State (2-9, 0-8 Big 12) in a game where style points might impress the CFP Committee. Or will the Cyclones draw on the power that came to them in 2011 against Oklahoma State? The Arizona-Oregon rematch on Friday is definitely a loaded storyline of possible revenge. Is it like Rocky?  Louisiana Tech facing a now potentially demoralized Marshall could have some story potential.  If Mizzou beats Bama, does that mean Indiana is the SEC champion? It is in Ohio State's interest to make Wisconsin sound like the greatest team ever. Maybe they hire a promoter like Don KingBall? GT-FSU shouldn't be a problem to find storylines for."

The Univ. of Nebraska at Omaha had a football team with a proud tradition for decades. But, the new AD, UNL defensive star from the 90's Trev Alberts, wanted to fully make the school D1 (the hockey team had been D1 for about 10 years, while the rest of the school was D2). The money didn't line up, however, and something had to be cut. Not only did the football program get cut, but the wrestling program did too, a travesty as they had just successfully threepeated and wad in fact national champion 6 out of the last 7 years.   They were cut ostensibly so UNO's basketball program could join D1 and hopefully make the tournament once in a while, but there are some rumblings that it was done because the BoT didn't want a program within the system competing with the Huskers. There's also an unwritten agreement that UNL wouldn't create a hockey team to compete with UNO."

Our end of season-game alternates between USC and Stanford every year, but this year it is @USC and ND fans definitely hate USC more than Stanford. Don't get me wrong, we love when we beat Stanford too, but there's a lot of mutual respect in the rivalry whereas USC is pretty much all bad will from our side. USC is THE rival (out of many) that most ND fans want to see beaten more than anything. Probably because we lose it more than we win. Maybe two weaker highlights could combine into one more intense highlight between Notre Dame and California.  It's not a big deal because we are a special case in many ways, I just think there's opportunity to do something amusing there. Which is what this subreddit is all about, after all."

cfbball,2mc14w,chhhyeahtone,9,Sat Nov 15 03:05:37 2014 UTC,Thanks! At one point I considered having GT do that magic trick where you hide a bean inside one of three cups and switch them around and you have to guess the cup. I thought it would've made a pretty good analogy to the triple option but I wasn't up to drawing that.
cfbball,2mc14w,JaxRiens,3,Sat Nov 15 03:19:55 2014 UTC,then when they finally figure it out its in a 4th cup with the number 15 on it behind the clemson ball

cfbball,2mc14w,PvM_Magi,2,Sat Nov 15 20:54:06 2014 UTC,Yeah I can completely understand that. Would have been a very close game or possibly even a dominant Clemson win if that freak injury doesn't happen.

The idea is that viewers can play along to the games they are watching by guessing the action, answering trivia/polls and receiving tweets with highlights.   In addition to all that, we also do special badges for moments like pick-sixes, fumbles, special events etc. I love this sub and wanted to start introducing cfb poland ball badges.   Naturally, I had to pick Georgia as the first one, but the plan would be to introduce one new ball per week that can be collected during that teams game, and attract more attention to all the beautiful work that this sub has.  Sorry to spam you guys with this shameless plug, but I figured we are all sports nuts and you guys might get a kick out of the /r/cfbball pub and our mobile game. Happy Gameday tomorrow everyone!"

In the book (and I don't remember how clearly this was portrayed in the movie), he's tripping balls at this point and is seeing giant bats flying all around. As the car pulls over, he says ""We can't stop here, this is bat country!""   b) Why are the bats so stupid looking?"" Well, this was an attempt at being clever. I figured being MSPaint I'd draw them in similar simple fashion, like how a kindergartener might draw birds, but then realized how closely that shape resembles the number 3, so I decided to make them sideways red 3's instead."

We have decided to punt on IE <9, just because it is terrible, but most browsers made within the last 5 years render rather well."

cfbball,2lqfnv,sven8705,6,Sun Nov 9 04:16:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  For those not in the loop, the land beyond the north end zone and a road, formerly a parking lot, is now Marina Heights, a massive $600 million construction site and the future regional headquarters of State Farm insurance.  If you noticed other construction on the aerial shots during the broadcast, that's because we have a LOT going on. The one on the building west of SDS is Phase II of a student housing tower called University House. The one north and west of Marina Heights is the final phase of Hayden Ferry Lakeside, a massive apartment and office complex.  Not to mention that Tempe is one of the hottest development spots in the nation. If it gets off the ground (has not broken ground yet), USA Place will be a massive transformation of a rather neglected street corner, with an Omni hotel, convention/events center and home to USA Basketball. A month or two ago we awarded a master planning contract to Catellus to help us develop some really valuable land for our Athletic Facilities District. And there are several more major housing and office developments happening in and around ASU."

USC is pretty much has a universal reputation for being a spoiled, snotty, cali bro, whereas UCLA fans are more mild-mannered melvins.

cfbball,2ko7cq,grip_it_N_rip_it,4,Wed Oct 29 21:14:25 2014 UTC,My friend whose family has been going to ISU for generations broke it all down for me one time and i will do the best to remember what I can. They were the Iowa State Cardinals in the 20's or 30's and then they played a game against someone where they won and the headline in the paper said something about a cyclone and everybody loved it so they decided to keep the cardinal in the logo and then change the name to cyclones.

cfbball,2ko7cq,Seanzie82,6,Wed Oct 29 22:06:31 2014 UTC,"I've been summoned. The dates I'm about to share are approximate as I'm too lazy to look up the official dates.  Back in the 1890s, Iowa State was referred as Iowa State Ag College and I've even seen ISU called ""Ames College"" back then as well, I'm not so sure about that though. Anyway Iowa State College were known as the Cardinals which is why our mascot today, ""Cy,"" is a cardinal bird.  But then in 1899ish, the Iowa State Cardinals went to play Northwestern in Chicago and blew them out 33-0 the same day that there were tons of tornadoes that touched down in the state of Iowa. But back then, tornadoes were commonly referred to as Cyclones.  The next day, the Chicago Tribune sports section headlined something close to ""Iowa State brings cyclones from Iowa to destroy Northwestern"" I could be way off on that headline but it was to that effect.  The Iowa State admins/staff/students/fans or whatever decided they liked being referred to as the Cyclones so it stuck. Then in the 1990's ISU introduced a logo that combined Cy the cardinal into a cyclone/tornado. It was kind of cool and unique but was a really ""busy"" logo and tough to distinguish at times. Many ISU fans call that logo the ""bird in the blender,"" and that's why they referenced ""Bird 'Nados""  EDIT: Also, the ""Bird 'Nado"" logo made zero sense to anybody who didn't know the background of ISU athletics. Hell, many of our own fans don't even know the history and couldn't tell you why we have a cardinal as a mascot even though we are the Cyclones"

cfbball,2kkwsn,e8odie,8,Tue Oct 28 17:22:41 2014 UTC,"I know they don't. We've had it for three years. There was no other way for me to work it in unless I'd had Georgia bring it in the first place, and it either wouldn't have made sense (since I didn't want to have Georgia ball beat Florida ball up with it since the game hasn't happened yet), or it would have just distracted from what Georgia ball was saying to Florida ball.   I put it in the third panel, where not much is going on, and the comic is just giving background information, and setting up the joke."
cfbball,2kkwsn,ThefalusNeopolitan,3,Tue Oct 28 17:25:58 2014 UTC,"It could have held the pig head up? Idk I think the comic was great, one of the best I've ever seen on here. I love being a Georgia fan and everyone fearing our hatred."

cfbball,2kkwsn,SenderUGA,4,Tue Oct 28 17:44:43 2014 UTC,This is hysterically funny. The only drawing critique I'd add is to widen the eyeholes on the VandyBall skull to the hate filled eyes of UGAball have some red skin around them. #HATEFEEDSTHEDAWG

You'll notice the close ups of Georgia ball and Florida ball are all the same image (with Florida I just changed the eyes, with Georgia I just zoomed in), because copying and pasting is lazier than redrawing."

cfbball,2khkyc,lincolnparkwildcat,2,Mon Oct 27 21:12:55 2014 UTC,"I am too. I guess part of the reason I haven't done it is that I have been to almost all the places that they stop on the lower Mississippi. Even if you don't take the boat, Memphis to Vicksburg through the Delta and then down to Natchez and Plantation country and into Baton Rouge would be an absolutely epic road trip, and a lot faster than the boat. Plus you would get to stop in places like Greenville and here some real blues music. People think I am crazy, but I think the Mississippi Delta is some of the most beautiful country in the world."
cfbball,2khkyc,lincolnparkwildcat,1 point,Mon Oct 27 22:06:01 2014 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. Personally, whenever I make the trip down through Mississippi, I take the Natchez Trace. If you have no where to be at any particular time, it is a pleasant road to drive."
cfbball,2khkyc,barrett51bmg,1 point,Mon Oct 27 22:09:47 2014 UTC,"I never did the trace, except for bypassing Jackson from the north to the west. Too much fear of a ticket."

Tradition dictates that the first 'T' to be stolen should be the one facing east,   as this can most easily be seen from the Downtown Connector.  The groups of students responsible for 'T' thefts generally assume dramatic pseudonyms, such as the ""Mystic Marauders"" or the ""Sneaky Four.""

cfbball,2jx46p,panthera_tigress,5,Tue Oct 21 23:33:33 2014 UTC,"I think most of them would, but we've had a little negative blowback here and there from fans of polandball who think we shouldn't be doing this.  I put a lot of the blame on PB's fantastic job of keeping their quality high. They're really strict, we're really not. The function is that I think some folks think we're just lazily stealing the concept.  On that front, they're not entirely wrong. But most of our artists didn't start making comics of any kind until they started making them here. We've all kinda had to learn by trial and error. What little we have now we wouldn't have at all if we didn't give people leeway to grow into it.  Some folks, I think, may not quite realize that."
cfbball,2jx46p,Old--Scratch,2,Wed Oct 22 01:36:00 2014 UTC,Agree with your assessment.  I like the sandbox we have going here.  I've seen some good stuff from new users and it's pretty cool.  So I tell devote's of PB to suck it because we are going to do this our own way to really tell the story of college football with all the sub-plots during an entire season.  We are simply taking their great idea and making it our own.

You're getting better and better every time you make a new one.  edit- I really like that you went back to the early days of /r/cfbball with the silly squiggles on Bama's script A.

cfbball,2j1o4q,derped,8,Sun Oct 12 18:41:03 2014 UTC,"I'm asking about getting the CSS from /r/CFB and /r/CFBOffTopic, that's the current plan for now. Probably tweak it to show the current #1 teamball for the center part as well.  Or, we could do ball flairs like on /r/polandball (template here), but there are a lot of teams, and school colors are a lot more difficult to distinguish in a small flair than flags are."
cfbball,2j1o4q,xerillum,9,Sun Oct 12 20:46:35 2014 UTC,I actually like the /r/polandball style. Just my opinion though.
cfbball,2j1o4q,EndoExo,3,Sun Oct 12 21:58:37 2014 UTC,I'm just concerned with how legible it'll be with a 20x20 flair is the issue.
cfbball,2j1o4q,xerillum,3,Sun Oct 12 22:12:15 2014 UTC,"Here's 20x20 Nebraska..  You can make the flair size bigger, can't you?"
cfbball,2j1o4q,twooaktrees,3,Mon Oct 13 00:52:18 2014 UTC,"30x30 is probably as large as it can go without looking humongous big, and now that I see yours I'm thinking that's the best way to go here."
cfbball,2j1o4q,xerillum,2,Mon Oct 13 01:55:02 2014 UTC,"The only problem I see coming with that is that we haven't standardized the characters. Some of the seem pretty set, but it's really very few in all.  I have no problem with standardizing them, but I don't really know how we'd go about it for so many schools.  One of the biggest differences between us and /r/polandball is that they have the national flags to work with as standards, we just have the colors and whatever small details we can work into a character to differentiate them from another school with a similar color palette.   I'd love to see us have ball character flairs, I'm just throwing this out there so smarter folks than me can think about it."
cfbball,2j1o4q,twooaktrees,1 point,Mon Oct 13 02:39:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, and another part of it is that there's 128 FBS schools to put in as flairs, at minimum. It's no small task to draw all of those, especially not in a way that you can recognize what the flair is.   Flags are easy for the most part, logos are a lot trickier."
cfbball,2j1o4q,NickHamburgers,2,Mon Oct 13 02:50:51 2014 UTC,"Like I said, I'd love for us to have flair specific to our sub; but I don't see how we could pull it off in a way that was both effective and fair.  Maybe later we could hold contests for alternate flairs or something.   I dunno. Just spit-balling at this point."

It's based on the overwhelming negativity that comes with being a fan of sports in the state of Georgia generally. While I'm not a UGA fan, I am a long time fan of Atlanta sports teams and grew up right on the GA/AL border. I can commiserate with UGA when it comes to sharing pro teams with most of them, and I've just been exposed to them long enough to be very familiar with the moods of their fanbase.  So my UGA character is an unhinged psychopath. The disappointments that have come with their last couple season don't really help in this regard.  Basically what I'm saying is that I'm trapped in a spiral of UGA depression. Pls hlp."

cfbball,2ilccz,BearDown1983,2,Tue Oct 7 20:20:30 2014 UTC,"This makes me curious for Arizona fans' opinions on the firing. Stoops lost 5 games in a row, which led to his firing, but four of those teams would finish in the AP Top-10. Rich Rod has led the team to a 5-0 start, with an upset of Oregon, but he's had consecutive 8-5 years, the same wheelhouse Stoops had the three seasons before his firing.  I wasn't watching this situation go down, so maybe there's specifics I'm missing; the Rich Rod hire seems to be a big win, but was Stoops really doing so bad?"
cfbball,2ilccz,SmallJon,1 point,Wed Oct 8 00:41:05 2014 UTC,"Well... Stoops was well-loved, but his sideline antics were pretty polarizing. Half of the fans loved them, the other half thought the refs would treat him better if he calmed down. We weren't really getting anywhere with Stoops, though. We were doomed to top out at 8-5.   As evidenced  by the personnel RichRod had available to him when he started, Stools really did not have the future of the program in mind, so clearly it was the right choice. I think we were all stunned that it happened when it did... In the middle of the season and that didn't seem right.... But I think had Byrne waited, we wouldn't have gotten RichRod, who was apparently his first choice."

cfbball,2ilccz,Gapeco,1 point,Wed Oct 8 18:03:38 2014 UTC,"The unsung hero that is Greg Bryne.  Stoops had done a remarkable job getting UA from a 3 win team to a regular bowl team. But even when we went 7-1 to start the season in 2010, it was a pretty big masquerade. We got absolutely destroyed by everyone we played of worth and pretty much stopped recruiting, especially on defense.   When Arizona started out the 2011 season 1-5 (three losses to top 10 teams and losses @USC and @Oregon State) on a completely front loaded schedule, Greg, knowing that Stoops wasn't his man long-term had to make the move then, otherwise risk Stoops winning in the second half of the season and gaining more security from the fan base.   Bold, opportunistic play by Greg. I doubt we get RichRod or anyone comparable if he doesn't make that fire midseason.

cfbball,2gqjhn,twooaktrees,3,Thu Sep 18 05:37:46 2014 UTC,"Mike stoops is at Oklahoma, mark stoops is the HC at UK."
cfbball,2gqjhn,Foopipoo,2,Mon Sep 22 21:03:56 2014 UTC,Damn. Me and my brother have similar first names. Wtf makes patents do that?
cfbball,2gptoo,twooaktrees,5,Thu Sep 18 01:04:31 2014 UTC,I hate you. Lol
cfbball,2gptoo,nin478,4,Thu Sep 18 03:03:05 2014 UTC,"Only because I'm right.  And the green ninja turtle mask for Florida was a master stroke, if I do say so myself."
cfbball,2gptoo,nin478,4,Thu Sep 18 03:05:56 2014 UTC,I like how the wind is able to fly in complete opposite directions for both flags.
cfbball,2gptoo,nin478,3,Thu Sep 18 03:09:45 2014 UTC,"Damnit.  Well...one is the wind, and the other is the stink blowing off Dothan."
cfbball,2gptoo,speedracer13,2,Thu Sep 18 03:13:26 2014 UTC,Appropriate. Haha.
cfbball,2gptoo,theReluctantHipster,3,Thu Sep 18 03:19:18 2014 UTC,Not enough peanuts for Dothan.
cfbball,2gptoo,Honestly_,2,Thu Sep 18 10:58:35 2014 UTC,Lol. I love how Dothan is to scale.
cfbball,2gptoo,mags87,2,Thu Sep 18 04:48:10 2014 UTC,"Florida kind of looks like a bastard member of TMNT, probably because of the shape of the eye mask."

cfbball,2f3e1v,twooaktrees,2,Sun Aug 31 16:57:11 2014 UTC,This is beautiful  Be prepared for massive butt-hurt from Auburn Fans
cfbball,2f3e1v,Techsanlobo,3,Sun Aug 31 18:51:14 2014 UTC,"Nah, not really. At this point, most of us have accepted Fairely was dirty and moved on.   We still niggle UGA fans with it from time to time, though."
cfbball,2f3e1v,Techsanlobo,1 point,Sun Aug 31 18:56:37 2014 UTC,I was more referring to your username.
cfbball,2f3e1v,HarryPalmsBlueBalls,2,Sun Aug 31 19:24:56 2014 UTC,He is an Auburn fan.
cfbball,2evzx4,twooaktrees,3,Fri Aug 29 03:42:32 2014 UTC,I would be down. It would be good practice for me cuz I have had this long standing idea for a stateball series with Arizona but I suck too much to draw it.
cfbball,2evzx4,Plneapple,3,Fri Aug 29 05:37:37 2014 UTC,"Also we could really get some fascist mods. I personally don't think that the collegeballs should talk like little kids and stuff. For example, I'd link if not on mobile, but that Michigan State big bro comic was quite the cancerous piece of work. Still funny though."
cfbball,2evzx4,Plneapple,4,Fri Aug 29 05:39:33 2014 UTC,"The biggest reason why I haven't been coming down as hard on rule-breaks as, say, dickrhino would be, is because if I did then we would barely have any content; as well as continuing from mod precedent here. So I think it's a balance between setting the bar high and potentially killing off a fledgling sub, and seeing some truly eye-searing comics once in a while. I want to find that middle ground where we have quality posts here while still being casual and actually having content."
cfbball,2evzx4,Plneapple,3,Fri Aug 29 07:17:14 2014 UTC,"I don't want to be nearly as strict as dickrhino or anything, but I just personally don't like the eyelines or drawing things like abs on a ball.  Could also maybe go for setting a what the balls should look like in the future; I could do without the Spartyball having the headdress."
cfbball,2evzx4,xerillum,2,Fri Aug 29 13:45:55 2014 UTC,"Headdress Sparty is good for me, it's just that it should really be drawn as a helmet and not as an extension of the body. All of your other examples, yeah, definitely. I think for now, warning about rule breaks is the only feasible option."
cfbball,2evzx4,xerillum,2,Fri Aug 29 15:27:38 2014 UTC,"As this is currently a tiny subreddit meant for /r/cfb subscribers, the rules will be very lax. Comics do not have to strictly comply with any rules.    Taken from the sidebar. That needs to be changed if any particular rules are going to be enforced in any way.  I really, really don't like this direction FWIW. I love /r/polandball and all it's permutations, but I hate the dictatorial manner in which the comic style is controlled. I think moving that way is the wrong thing to do."
cfbball,2evzx4,xerillum,2,Fri Aug 29 16:57:57 2014 UTC,"Exactly, and what's in the sidebar is how it's going to be moderated. There's not going to be ""only approved submitters"", and there's not going to be removal of comics unless it becomes a serious problem (and we're nowhere near that problem as a sub right now).   This is/has always been/will always be a casual subreddit. I'm not going to be bringing the hammer down on the rules, more encouraging people to get familiar with the style guide."
cfbball,2evzx4,Techsanlobo,1 point,Fri Aug 29 17:12:36 2014 UTC,"I think we need to let this sub work out its own style organically.   There are some rules I wouldn't mind seeing enforced in the future, but if it ever started to become as exclusionary as /r/polandball I wouldn't be contributing anymore. It sucks all the fun out of making the comics."
cfbball,2eq4a2,twooaktrees,4,Wed Aug 27 13:58:04 2014 UTC,I love lil' Cincy.  Classic!
cfbball,2en6n9,twooaktrees,7,Tue Aug 26 17:19:54 2014 UTC,First I've heard of /r/cfbball ... I enjoyed the Johnny Football / LSU one
cfbball,2en6n9,xerillum,6,Tue Aug 26 17:55:44 2014 UTC,"The overlap of folks who like both cfb and polandball is probably pretty small, but we're around."
cfbball,2en6n9,SaintJackDaniels,4,Tue Aug 26 17:58:47 2014 UTC,"Polandball seems to be getting popular around reddit, I keep seeing comics pop up in other subs I've subscribed to. Or maybe the subs I'm on happen to have that overlap of people who find historical/geopolitical humor funny."

cfbball,2dat19,byniri,22,Tue Aug 12 02:50:43 2014 UTC,"The ""LOL SUGAR BOWL"" was a nice touch."

cfbball,27r7zt,polydorr,2,Tue Jun 10 17:27:22 2014 UTC,"I likem, but a few critiques:   The Michigan State ball looks like a little bit much. Maybe for Michigan just do a big ole M right on the front. Kansas claims the basketball look. Unless we make all the more basketball oriented schools basketballs too. Like Kentucky."
