Perhaps if it takes off there can be a split in the future, but TV deal wise it would make the most sense to have the entire maritimes support a team, and possibly have games at various different stadiums - some in Halifax, some in Moncton."
CanadaSoccer,3e09cw,DamnGhosts,2,Tue Jul 21 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Moncton makes sense location wise as it's seen as a ""midpoint"" for the maritimes. I just think there would be more support in Halifax. Plus I could go to some of the games haha."

Tiebert can come home and start in the middle for a real team.   Floro purposely played this tourney not to lose, spare an extra time goal vs Jamaica, he accomplished that. The problem is I think he could have gotten a lot further. He seemed set on his tactics even when the group became a wide open opportunity.   We could have won all three of the games we played. And we were the better team for good portions of all of them. We lacked the will and direction to win.   If Floro stated this going forward to the CSA and they are comfortable with it, so be it. I suppose the objective is 2018 after all. But if you can't seize opportunities, I can't see how you move forward. Making 2018 would be outstanding. But if we do I expect us to play to win, not just be happy to be there."

Canada is ahead with 4 points and finishes 2nd.  If El Salvador beats Jamaica, then Canada would be tied with Jamaica for 2nd.  First tie-breaker is goal differential.  If Canada wins, they'll be at 0 (or more if they win by more than 1 goal).  If Jamaica loses, they'll be at 0 (or less if they lose by more than 1 goal).  If both games are decided by 1 goal exactly - Jamaica likely wins the tiebreaker.  Even assuming that Jamaica beat Canada on the tiebreaker, then Canada would get a 3rd place spot.  Panama only has 3 points in Group A.  Of course, getting 2nd would be nice to avoid Mexico and the USA in the first knockout game."

We also have a brutal defence, especially Sesselman, except for Buchanan who is amazing. To add on top of it it seems like the media is content with the results.   This will be the legacy left behind."
CanadaSoccer,3bvidy,BanksKnowsBest,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:43 2015 UTC,Wonder how much profit the CSA gets at the end of the day. Could it be enough to get the ball rolling on a national Div 1 league (either women's or men's)
CanadaSoccer,3bvidy,footsoldiers_sg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"I doubt you'll see a Canadian women's div 1 league anytime soon (if ever).  Not to say that I wouldn't like to see one in an ideal world, but the business model isn't there for it.  The US can only get nine teams for one right now, and they've gone through three div 1 women's leagues in the last decade.  At best, we'll follow the MLS model and get T/V/M in there, but that's so far down the road it's not even worth looking at.  Though there's always those persistent rumours about a D2 coming for 2017..."

CanadaSoccer,3bmxjj,ToffeeUnion_NS,2,Tue Jun 30 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"You can sit there and choose to focus on every negative and pick apart our team BUT you have NO IDEA how much passion, heart and hard work this team puts in.   I'm reasonably confident that much of the criticism she has been exposed to has been directed at her individually and not the team.  Here she sounds like she's trying to deflect criticism of herself onto the team.   ""Yes I slipped, yes they scored and yes you can blame me all you want ... if that's what makes you feel better fine.""   It's not about the blame, it's about accepting the responsibility.  She sounds like a teen here, not a grown woman.  I don't want to be too hard on Sesselmann.  I always thought the highest stress role was keeper.  Now I'm thinking it might be centre-back."

CanadaSoccer,3bgqi6,BanksKnowsBest,2,Mon Jun 29 02:05:02 2015 UTC,Who would have thought that Ashtone Morgan would be the top Canadian minute getter in MLS halfway through the season after the disaster that was 2014 for him? Great to see...
CanadaSoccer,3bgqi6,footsoldiers_sg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"he's really turned it around. Definitely Ryan Nelsen's biggest mistake, along with the misuse of Bekker while at TFC. He's shown that he can handle himself brilliantly in MLS and now he is back in the national team picture as well although I have to assume he'll be backing up De Jong at the Gold Cup"

CanadaSoccer,3b74or,BanksKnowsBest,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:42:50 2015 UTC,Well it definitely shaped up to be a hugely disappointing effort by team Canada.

Not sure if they still do that.  But in the context of the World Cup it is going to be seen as England's song."
CanadaSoccer,3aq0ni,ToffeeUnion_NS,4,Mon Jun 22 15:57:55 2015 UTC,To elaborate on this -- It's a record for a national team game involving Canada. The highest attended game in soccer in Canadian history was West Germany vs Poland at the Montreal Olympics. Over 70k for that game.
