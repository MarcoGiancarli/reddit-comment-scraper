soylent,3e3tg4,CordycepsFungus,39,Wed Jul 22 00:45:44 2015 UTC,"Seems to me like you're coloring your interaction with your own personal bias.     You admit that they asked if Soylent was bad for you, meaning that they didn't know, and were uneducated.  Instead of taking the opportunity to educate them about Soylent, and your consuming a product that has 100% nutrition, and the health benefits included in consuming a diet that has everything your body needs, and lacks nothing, nutritionally, and the benefits of things like added productivity time, saving money from a cheaper food source, being on the cutting edge of a possible larger food movement...  Instead of doing any of that, you chose to try and food-shame them for what they were eating instead?    When I mentioned to people at work (in the food service industry), that I was considering a liquid diet, a couple of them seemed skeptical, but instead of shaming them for what they chose to eat, I decided to try and explain some of the things that I had learned in my own research on the subject.  After discussing the topic with them, they were more accepting of the idea, even if it wasn't something they were personally interested in trying.  I may not have converted anyone, but I'll guarantee you that next time they run into a person doing a Soylent (or similar) diet, they'll be informed, and won't react with misconceptions because they don't know anything about it.    Next time, instead of trying to lecture them about why what they're eating is bad, try explaining why what you're drinking is good."

I already had a bunch of Hubert's Lemonade bottles that I was saving for some long-forgotten project.  I find that the recipe I'm using gives me the perfect consistency at 2.5 quarts per batch, which is perfect for 5 bottles.  I have enough bottles that I can mix up 3 days worth of shakes at once, and then not have to worry about mixing any more for a few days.  However, considering they're glass, I prefer to keep those for in-home use.    When I leave the house, and think I might need a meal on-the-go, I have a few 16 oz travel thermoses that I've picked up at thrift stores, usually for around $1-3 each) that I can fill up.  I just toss 1 or 2 of those into an insulated lunch bag with a couple of ice packs, or some frozen bottles of water, and I'm good to go.  The opening is big enough to add a wire blender ball, if you want one (I find that mine doesn't need a blender ball, I just shake it for a few seconds, and it's all good), or it's also big enough to add ice cubes if you want to keep it a little bit colder.  Those bottles, specifically, aren't as well insulated as the glass vacuum lined type, and won't keep the contents as cold, for nearly as long, if you just leave the thermos sitting out at room temperature.  (the quality varies by how good of a brand you get, and how cheaply they're made.)  However, if you have a little insulated lunch bag & an ice pack, you're good to go.  If you have a good quality thermos, and fill it with cold Soylent & ice, you should be able to get an easy 12-18 hours out of it.  A blender ball should also fit in most normal thermos bottles, also.  I've taken an entire days worth of meals in separate thermos bottles in a larger soft-sided cooler bag with a few ice packs.    If you get something with a smaller neck, you can buy smaller blender balls if you look on Amazon.  I have 2 small blender bottles that have oval-shaped mini blender balls that are only about half the size of a ""normal"" blender ball."

Also, I'd recommend switching your water around. Fill up the bottom only about an inch high and put the remainder of the water on top. I find a good chunk ends up sticking to the container top if you don't have enough water on top. That could come loose later on and form a clump. Or at the very least, it robs you of some calories :)"

If you shake at this speed, it needs reduced force, and you are going with the flow instead of against it. Most physical systems have a fundamental frequency like this. Even people--if you push someone, they'll right themselves at some speed. That's it.  The simplest example is a pendulum. Everything is actually a pendulum. :)"

Either dump the mouthwash in with your normal bottle, or spend a day or two using the travel bottle until it's gone.

If your body requires X amount of calories to maintain your current weight, consuming fewer calories than X will result in weight loss.  It's that simple.  Now, the nature of those calories is where the ""health"" part really comes in.  You can (and will) lose weight by eating nothing but McDonald's chicken nuggets if you are under the daily caloric number.  But that's not nutritious.  Soylent's design is meant to be nutritionally complete (so far as I am aware, I am new here).  So the idea is you are consuming the vitamins, minerals, fat, carbs, protein, etc. that one should be consuming in order to be healthy, and also the number of calories is under that X number, you should then have healthy weight loss.  It should be said that it works the opposite way, too.  Say you're eating incredibly healthy foods; salads, fruits, etc. Say that everything you eat is good for you.

The big metric to me isn't weight loss but fat loss. That might seem obvious, but when I was on official Soylent only about 65% of my weight loss was from fat. Sure, I was running a caloric deficit, but losing significant amounts of lean body tissue was a big problem.  Now, I realize this is only a single data point, but for me, switching to keto Soylent options (various commercial ones) was the big difference. My percentage of weight loss being from fat loss is now well over 90. What I found interesting is that I was doing the full 2000 calorie official Soylent in the hopes that losing weight slower would help prevent lean tissue loss, but lean tissue preservation was so much higher on the 1200 calorie/day keto soylent I do now.  When you're so overweight, your body has a decent amount of muscle (relative to an equally sedentary but much skinnier person) just from having to move that much more weight around.  IMHO, keeping as much of that as possible is the single most important metric of weight loss.    When your weight loss includes too much lean tissue loss, it can be easy to end up as what I've heard called ""skinny fat"" where you have lost weight, but so much of it was from lean tissue.  This is my own N=1 anecdotal data, so I'm not claiming this is something generally applicable, but since I seem to fit the requested category from the post, figured I'd chime in with my experience.

But I have lost about 5.6 kg over 4 weeks.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-T5FPjNgfmRUlFbi1zN2lJTnM/view  I use a spreadsheet to keep track of my weight and calorie intake, requirements, etc :)"
soylent,3dwxme,TrueEnt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Keep it up. I was just asking out of curiosity. I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum, it has always been impossible for me to gain weight. I try stuffing my face with food and I don't gain weight. Oddly when I started Soylent I gained ~10-15 lbs over 2 months. I figure I wasn't a 'healthy' weight before Soylent because I was skipping meals (not on purpose) Soylent makes it easy to eat when I'm busy. Then I started wondering if this would be good for a certain someone in my family who has been visibly gaining weight but is too lazy/doesn't care to diet and exercise."
soylent,3dwxme,chrisbair,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I lost about 7.2 kg over a period of about 5 weeks (I just weighed myself, new week, monday). I am rather obese so I try to stick to 1 kg per week in weight loss.   The question is: do the person want to lose weight? If they stick to their regular food, candy, etc., and then eat Soylent on top of that... well, they will kind of blow up.   But if they are willing to substitute breakfast and lunch for soylent, and a light dinner, then I am quite sure they could lose weight, as long as they don't overeat :)"
soylent,3dwxme,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jul 20 07:19:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't changed my activity level since starting Soylent.  I was moderately active before and I still am.  I've lost about thirty pounds in four months eating Soylent for two-thirds to three-quarters of my diet.  I'm not hungry, my rule is I can eat all the Soylent I want.    So, my short answer is yes, you can be obese and lose weight eating Soylent."

As opposed to the chaos of eating normal food where at best you can guesstimate the calories you're getting, I know exactly what 1600 calories of Soylent looks like and how to distribute it throughout the day."
soylent,3dwxme,ShippingIsMagic,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"Others in this thread have already mentioned that the correct way to lose weight is calories in vs calories out. I find soylent just helps track the calories in a lot easier.   I usually mix a whole bag for a couple days and use it as a meal replacement. I find that it keeps me full enough that I can use it to only have a few hundred calories for each ""meal"".   It is great that I can just have the 2 liter bottle full of water/oil/soylent = 2,000 calories and just track how much I have had for the day. So if I am at a half full bottle at dinner I have already had 1000 calories for the day and then use that for my calculations.  A smoothie/water bottle with volume measurements on the sides really helps with calculations, too.   It is really nice when I know I have a big dinner with family or something so I can manage my input before then. I will purposely eat less soylent before that."

There'll be a full review coming from me in a week or so, but regarding the shipping:  It was shipped with next day delivery, so I guess it only left them on around the 13th - 15th.  They mentioned the shipping time on the front page was (I think) 7 - 10 days.  I ordered a variety, they didn't delay through lack of banana, although I wish they had, because banana is my favourite flavour and I got not, so they instead included a Joylent wakeup, and I'm not normally a coffee fan (although will try it anyway).  The Joylent ordering & shipping process, IMO, is generally not good. When they actually post the product, it'll arrive quickly, but they rarely post it within a few days of ordering, and there are lots of stories of them including the wrong things. It's a shame, because I feel it gets them a lot of bad press on here and does reflect very badly on them, especially given how many people complain about it. Nice product though, and loving the current packaging."

Even on a caloric surplus, getting big takes years of ass-busting hard work. It's not easy.  B) 1000 calories per day with that kind of activity level will burn you out quickly, I guarantee it.  C) At that activity level, you'll drop weight over time at 1750-2000 calories per day. If you really must cut calories further, I wouldn't go less than 1500-1750, bare metal minimum.  Summary: just do 3-4 servings of Soylent per day, and you'll easily meet your weight loss objective, and maintain a deficit that you can actually keep up for awhile (I'd do 4 servings on active days, 3 on inactive days). Don't worry about putting on muscle mass until you're ready to eat big. That is all. Easy."

soylent,3duzw8,Mandarni,4,Sun Jul 19 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"It is not healthy if you starve yourself. A deficiency, but not starvation. If you are a male, don't go under 1600 kcal. If you are female, don't go under 1200 kcal.   And don't lose more than 1 kg (~2 pounds) per week. You will look like a wrinkled dog. Flabby skin. Also isn't healthy to lose too much weight.  Basically, the equation I use is (from wikipedia, and yes, I use metric measurements, I am Swedish):  Men   BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 * weight kg) + (4.799 * length cm) - (5.677 * years age)   Women   BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 * weight kg) + (3.098 * length cm) - (4.330 * years age)   This MBR score is then modified, by how active you are, to get the recommended daily intake in calories:   Sedentary:  BMR * 1.2 = RDI Light: BMR * 1.375 = RDI Moderate: BMR * 1.55 = RDI Heavy: BMR x 1.725 = RDI Very heavy: BMR x 1.9 = RDI   This yields your recommended RDI to maintain your weight. Then, basically, 100 kcal deficiency per day yield 0.1 kg per week. So 1000 kcal deficiency per day yield 1 kg per week. Roughly. Just a back of the envelope calculation.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-T5FPjNgfmRUlFbi1zN2lJTnM/view  Is the spreadsheet I am using. As I lose weight my RDI will decrease, and once it reaches <2600 I can't subtract 1000 without falling under 1600, thus I need to exercise more: resulting in higher RDI due to higher BMR coefficient.   I can upload the excel file if you want. The grey fields are basically the fields you need to fill in. Every other field is derived from it. It consists of 4 sheets in 1 spreadsheet file:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-T5FPjNgfmSkhuVnBLQ1dfWVU/view?usp=sharing  I have input the values you provided, except your length, which I put as 185 cm.

My rule is basically ""eat soylent when there's no other healthy, convenient option"". So basically 100% of my breakfasts and lunches are soylent, and I've had weeks where only 1 or 2 dinners weren't soylent. In the last 7 days I think I only had 2 or 3 non-soylent meals (all of them being dinner).  I generally feel fine/about the same on soylent. I'm definitely losing weight, which is great. I do recall, early on when close to 100% soylent I felt a little ""funny"" but honestly I can't remember exactly what the feeling was. I think I accredited it to a surplus of B6 or something.   When I'm on longer stretches of soylent I do crave solid food. Last night I was craving a chicken parm hero like nobody's business, but I got over it ;).   The truth is, you don't have to go 100% soylent. Just eat it in a way that works for you. If I have an opportunity to eat a healthy solid food meal (ie, out with friends), or if I'm in the mood to cook at home, I'll eat the real food. But most of the time, soylent is cheaper, more convenient, and healthier than what I would have done in a past life.   It's definitely better than buttered bagel for breakfast health-wise, definitely better than random, unpredictable $14 lunch at work in the city (if not health-wise, then at least in terms of consistency and cost), and it's better than takeout for dinner, both health-wise and cost-wise."

soylent,3dtziy,ryanmercer,3,Sun Jul 19 15:57:46 2015 UTC,I do add a bit of extra fiber.   I actually started doing this with 1.5 after bitching about how much fiber was in 1.4 heh. I add a tablespoon or so of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B8F85Y to each bag.
soylent,3dtziy,5Foot3ChinlessMale,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:25 2015 UTC,"I have been at 100% for 2 entire weeks, after having made it through the previous month on a 50/50 split. Unfortunately I just ran out of soylent so I upgraded my subscription to a month's supply! Anxiously waiting for my new shipment to arrive. The fact I have to return to regular food for a short while actually depresses me and I am literally craving soylent at the moment. The first thing I ate after the 2 weeks was a greasy burrito. I just have to say that every bite of that burrito tasted like a mouthful of salt. I feel so plebian consuming normal food.   Regarding how I felt, really amazing actually. The biggest issue I have is spacing out my meals, and making sure I dont have too little or too much left to consume for the last meal of the day."

FTFY. On a serious note I feel like I enjoy food more now that I have Soylent. For example when I do have pizza I go buy better pizza rather than just eating pizza from the place down the street because I was hungry. The hard thing for me is that I run out before my next shipment comes in. I have a 2 week subscription, 3 week supply per month would be better for my habits."

I wouldn't want to stay at 100% for a long time. I save money replacing my breakfast and lunch but don't really save much money on dinner.

soylent,3dubwx,ryanmercer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on which type milk you use, and how much, it can significantly change how many calories you're adding. whole milk, reduced fat (2%), lowfat (1%), nonfat (skim milk). For example, using about 1.5l whole milk for 1 day's worth of soylent, will add about 950 calories in the form of 50g fat, 80g carbs, 49g protein. Lowfat milk would cut that down to about 600 calories, 15g fat. nonfat milk, 500 calories, 3g fat. but both still add similar amounts of carbs and protein. And that's just the milk by itself.     Other types of milk, like soy milk or coconut milk, would be different.    Look up the nutrition data for anything you might add: http://nutritiondata.self.com/ http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/"
soylent,3dubwx,ryanmercer,3,Sun Jul 19 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of those changes, and that's actually the main reason why I want to use the milk. I'm wanting about 3000 calories a day."

You always have to exceed you need for at least one of those to meet your  needs. They chose proteins."
soylent,3dthz5,toper-centage,2,Sun Jul 19 10:48:09 2015 UTC,Thanks !
soylent,3dthz5,be_bo_i_am_robot,11,Sun Jul 19 10:49:30 2015 UTC,"It seems the biggest disagreement in the world of soylents (and in the broader nutrition world as a whole) is about  macronutrient ratios. We all need fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, but how much of each? Low carb? 40/30/30? Moderate carb? High carb? What's ""best"" for health?  Compound this with the fact that personal goals differ, and therefore dietary needs may differ as well. Rosa Lab's Soylent was designed to meet the ""nutritional needs of the average human."" Well, the average human isn't running ultra-marathons (in which case tons of carbs are helpful), doing powerlifting, bodybuilding, or Crossfit (in which case protein is absolutely necessary for recovery), or looking to lose 180lb or overcome insulin sensitivity (in which case a ketogenic approach works magic).  If you're an average human, simply doing your 20 minutes on the treadmill 3x per week, you probably don't need that much protein. If you're even moderately athletic, you might. If you're wanting to pack on muscle like The Rock, start eatin', son - you can start with six whole chickens, that's breakfast.  Rosa Lab's Soylent was designed to be the basic ""nutritional substrate"" that you can customize on top of, if you're not an average human. Doing Iron Man triathlon training? Add your meals of bananas and spaghetti on top of your normal Soylent regimen. Doing Olympic lifting? Add in plenty of protein, some eggs for breakfast, whey into your Soylent mix, and so on. Most people won't need to do these sorts of things."
soylent,3dthz5,dalonelybaptist,2,Sun Jul 19 14:25:37 2015 UTC,No complaints from me!  I stick a tiny bit extra protein powder in it and it makes for an awesome post workout shake haha
soylent,3dthz5,xfjtcvngf,3,Sun Jul 19 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"Adjusted to 2000 calories, regular Queal has about 122g of protein.  Soylent 1.3 had 114g of protein.  There are minimal to no downsides to eating more protein than you need, while there are potentially serious health consequences in not getting enough. It's really that simple. The protein might help you feeling fuller longer too so that's nice."
soylent,3dthz5,ricandersen,0,Sun Jul 19 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"And Soylent 1.4 had 84g of protein, Soylent 1.5 has 80g of protein.  Huel has 150g of protein. They state in their forum that more protein helps with satiety.  ""... there are potentially serious health consequences in not getting enough.""  True. But protein would have to be reduced to a ridiculously low number. Like under 40g/day for a prolonged period. Anything in the neighborhood of 50g/day is suitable for all but the most serious of athletes."
soylent,3dthz5,Powderfood_Phil,4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not unhealthy. The only harm in overdosing protein is the lovely gas that comes with it.  That being the case, the point is marketing. Since the industry was already kind enough to firmly install in all of us the idea that PROTEIN = MAD GAINZ, many powdered food manufacturers happily jump onto that wagon.   If you look around this sub, you'll find a plethora of posts wondering why there is ""so little"" protein in Rosa Labs Soylent. Queal, Huel & other high-protein brands don't have that problem. High protein seems to be what consumers want, so it's what they provide."

I can really imagine being a bit overwhelmed by the idea of eating powdered foods after a lifetime of eating solid (and liquid) foods. It can seem as a big step.  I really dont think you have to be worried, it is just (good) food. All of the ingredients have been in your body before. Also know that it's not a diet, don't feel obligated to have it for breakfast every day, just notice how you feel after having a few and go from there.  The wiki is indeed intimidating; it's written by fans, so from quite the subjective perspective. Actually the concept has been around for decades, commonly used for medical purposes but also commercially. Now it's finally getting the marketing it deserves.  Not saying you shouldn't feel overwhelmed at all though :]. Depending on your usual, it's likely that you will be improving on your diet a lot, which may have some surprisingly sweet effects.

soylent,3dqzhe,PM_ME_UR_NUDIBRANCHS,7,Sun Jul 19 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"You need more electrolytes. Add some salt to your soylent. If it doesn't help, see a doctor.  On a side note, if they were serious about this being a single source of nutrition, they'd put in proper amounts of sodium. It's annoying that they decided everybody using this was augmenting their diet with the standard american diet, i.e., that everybody using was automatically coming from a place of inflated sodium intake. They should focus on making the product itself a whole food, and if other people want to add salty shit to their diet, let them enjoy their high blood pressure.  Edit: As to ""some"" salt, I add maybe 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of table salt to 1000 kcal of Soylent since that's usually all I consume in a day. I don't measure, but I probably should so I can reproduce results. I am not used to adding salt to food, and I don't get a lot of salt from my regular diet except maybe once a week when I eat pizza or something. I think 1/2 teaspoon of table salt is upper limit of what's recommended for sodium. Each serving of Soylent provides 16% RDA, so if it's your entire source of nutrition, you're getting about 64% RDA of sodium daily (assuming you're on 2000 kcal per day). Add salt. It needs it, and it won't make it taste salty, despite that being their supposed reasoning for lowering it.  (RDA, DRI, whatever.)"
soylent,3dqzhe,commentsomehow,4,Sat Jul 18 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I don't add salt to anything I eat because most foods in the USA already have too much sodium.  Hadn't really thought about Soylent being too low in sodium.  Could also explain why I feel okay after eating Chipotle.  With what I get, it's about 100% of my daily sodium in a burrito."
soylent,3dqzhe,airjer,6,Sat Jul 18 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's very dishonest of them to tout this as some kind of food replacement if they're not going to provide complete nutrition. No one in the US is thinking they get too little sodium, because most foods here are chock full of it and it's very hard to find any advice that isn't just ""lower your sodium"", which is useless.   Additionally a 2000 kcal per day serving of soylent gives you the bare minimum amount of iodine, so you're not hurting yourself using iodized salt either. People with strange metabolic changes on soylent need to know that the change of iodine levels might be affecting their thyroid if they're not doing the full bag of soylent per day."
soylent,3dqzhe,dalebewan,2,Sat Jul 18 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it also lacking in protein and fiber? I wonder if there's a list out there of everything to add to make it complete.

Using the Mocha flavored protein powder also isn't too bad, and with some minor adjustments, tastes very much like a frappaccino.      The only problem with doing a DIY recipe is that you're going to have a slightly larger ""buy-in"" cost to get all of the ingredients shipped to you.  However, I bought all of the ingredients, and spent an evening measuring out baggies of the mix so that I had a month's worth of mix.      If you're willing to spend a bit of extra money, you can find a bunch of the available sellers have samples for sale on their website.  You can always buy samples of a bunch of different brands, and give them a shot.

soylent,3dnvgs,alfoders,5,Fri Jul 17 23:37:32 2015 UTC,Your container may rupture if you leave Soylent in a tightly sealed container for an extended period of time.

soylent,3dnvgs,ThatRailroader,2,Sat Jul 18 09:28:53 2015 UTC,"The most obvious trick is adding ice at the last stage of mixing. You'll need a lot. If you use room temperature water, microbes can get a head start multiplying while you wait for the water to become cold.  The less obvious trick is to limit its motion. Mixing/shaking increases the nutrients available to microbes, and speeds their reproduction. So don't put it in the fridge door.  Keep it very cold--turn your fridge down as low as it goes.  Finally, if you think it's gonna develop carbonation, put it in a soda bottle. They can handle a good deal of pressure.  Will this keep it good for weeks? No. If you want to do that, my only thought is that you could try seeding it with sourdough starter culture. Then it would develop some of the taste of sourdough, but technically it would be safe, as a hostile environment (acidic) for microbes. You need to check the pressure, I'm not sure whether this makes significant CO2."

soylent,3dnvgs,sleepycorn,2,Sat Jul 18 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, if there's more than 1% chance you'd try it, I can add that you should adapt the starter to Soylent first. You would take a standard starter, and each day when you ""feed"" it, you would use successively more Soylent and less flour.

I'm less inclined to believe that the calculators are wrong by such a wide margin, my theory is that there is something IN the soylent we are ingesting (or the eating lifestyle) that has thrown our metabolism into total chaos.

I had a poorly secured batch of early Joylent, it got infested by clothes flour moths (or something like that) and I've been fighting the infestation since then. They can chew their way through the plastic bag and lay their eggs in the powder, the larvae develop and start grubbing. You'll start seeing webs (like spider webs) inside the bag with powder sticking to it and pupae inside the densest webs. If you let them be, adult moths will emerge a few days later and it all starts over."
soylent,3dl3qa,Lucius_Martius,5,Fri Jul 17 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"this!  They are flourmoths.  If you see moths anywhere in your kitchen immediately check all open and lock away all sealed bags. If you are unsure do not scoop the powder directly out of the bag but fill it into another container to check for clots and webs.  Sometimes if you catch the one or two specimen that got inside your house (either through bought food items like flour, sugar or pasta or through the window) before they can lay eggs you can prevent a large infestation, but if it happens all soylent is in grave danger."

When I started, I weighed almost exactly 100lbs and I'm 5'8"". I've slacked off and lost some weight now but at one point I was 150lbs. I'm 140lbs now, but my goal is 165-175. I'm really hoping that with soylent, cheap meat, and some protein shakes that I'll be able to hit that. On a related note, if you want a pep talk about the gym, I wouldn't mind to skype ya. I started out with my max benchpress being 75lbs...that was my MAX. And I'm by no means a body builder, but I've over tripled my max since then(not hard to do when the starting point is so small!

soylent,3diva7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:14:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Something to think about going forward is, what type of body do you want to have in the future? Sure, you can't have it this minute, but what's your goal?  The reason being that fat is harder to gain than to lose, and fat kept longer is even harder to lose. So if your eventual goal is muscle rather than fat, you may want to be more careful with your calories. If you are on the exact trajectory you want to be on, fine. But if you want to eventually lose fat, I suggest doing it now rather than later, since it just gets harder. You'll end up with all the muscles you wanted, but a belly that you can't get rid of.  But seriously, congratulations!"
soylent,3dlqnx,6buttons,2,Fri Jul 17 08:07:59 2015 UTC,"Just take it slower. People tend to really underestimate how easy it is to injure yourself if you just go out and start running. Running is high impact, and your bones and connective tissue tend to take more time to adjust than your cardio and respiratory systems. I recommend going with the Couch to 5K plan. But make sure you're healed up before you start. (Your diet probably isn't a problem at this point. If you were running marathons, that's another story.)"
soylent,3dlqnx,PM_ME_UR_NUDIBRANCHS,2,Fri Jul 17 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"I second the Couch to 5K recommendation, it helps ramp up your activity in a progressive manner.  Also, I recommend resting for at least a day between runs when starting out - this helps with the stress on your system.    I was in a similar scenario, generally inactive for years, started Soylent, and have gotten back into fitness.  Currently on Week 5 of C25K and going strong."
soylent,3dlqnx,Subvers1on,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:05 2015 UTC,Thanks :)  Having discussed it with a few other people too that appears to be the general concensous. I think I took for granted that the aforementioned activities have given me better cardio than those who don't exercise so I was able to push more without giving consideration to my body. Lesson learnt!
soylent,3dlqnx,Flm,2,Fri Jul 17 13:22:17 2015 UTC,"You probably do have ""better cardio"" than most people, especially those who don't exercise. The issue is more likely with the movements you're doing. Snowboarding and badminton aren't taxing on the legs in the same way as running longer distances. You can most likely push yourself more and faster than people who don't exercise, but your body isn't used to these particular movements so while you might not feel tired from the exercises you are using muscles and joints you don't normally use in way you haven't regularly used them. Once you've accustomed your body to running, you'll be doing great.  It's the same logic as someone who is a terrific long distance rowing won't be particularly good at running long distances, while they most definitely have good cardio, as well as the opposite."
soylent,3dlhtg,tamen,2,Fri Jul 17 06:10:59 2015 UTC,"Mct will also help you maintain ketosis easier. Kinda acts as a small buffer for when you go slightly over your carbs. It won't help if you're going to eat pizza :-)   Strictly speaking it's not absolutely necessary and you can do Keto fine without mct but it's flavorless, really isn't horribly expensive, is one of the healthiest oils out there (probably only second to coconut oil which it's made from). The only downside I have ever seen is if you consume a lot of it and your GI isn't used to that you can sometimes get the runs. After a few days it goes away and you're fine.   I used to use liquid coconut oil in mine because I could get it locally and it was cheaper than the mct I used to use. Then a customer pointed out a different supplier that was actually cheaper for mct than the coconut oil. I switched."
soylent,3dlhtg,chrisbair,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:51:34 2015 UTC,MCT oil is quite expensive here. The cheapest I've found is 100DDK for 500ml.  But it sounds like I can use less and less as I get adapted. Or I can try it anyway :)

Queal has a more rich flavour offer, but that's not a crucial factor for me, as price is."
soylent,3dj5s6,elevul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:57:48 2015 UTC,This is really my sway too.  If they were the same or very similar priced I would give Queal a try without hesitation but money is a key factor.  £20 a week is no laughing matter when that's almost £100 a month saved.

soylent,3dkcaw,recz255,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"Question... is this because you're on the road, and nowhere near refrigeration to be able to store this stuff?  Or is this because once you leave the house in the morning, you don't have a way to keep it chilled?      As others have mentioned (and as I've done) you can use a thermos to keep it cool.  Vacuum lined thermoses will keep things cold for almost an entire day, and you can even mix it up with a little bit less water, and drop a few ice cubes into the thermos when you fill it, to help keep it colder.    I am using the KetoChow recipe, and mix mine up so that I've got 5 shakes that are 16 ounces each.  I also have a number of 16 ounce off-brand thermos-type bottles similar to these (in addition to a few branded thermos bottles that are even better than those I linked to) that I use when I leave the house.  I've picked these up at thrift stores for a couple of bucks each.  If you have a blender bottle wire ball insert thing, it will fit inside one of these bottles to be able to mix it up, but I've found that with a few seconds of vigorous shaking, mine don't even need it.  Anyway... When I mix up my shakes (I find that mine will last 5 days if sealed & refrigerated), I'll put a few meals into these thermos-type bottles, and keep them in the fridge to keep them cold.  If I plan on leaving the house and know I'll need to eat before I get home, I grab a little soft-sided insulated lunch bag (like the kind kids take to school ), and either throw in an ice pack, or a frozen bottle of water (I like to keep a few water bottles in the freezer for quick ice packs) to make sure it stays a little colder while I'm out.      Doing this, I've been able to take my liquid food with me wherever I went, and as long as I've been out of the house, for up to an entire day (just took a bigger insulated bag with a bigger ice pack), and have never had any problems.      You can also save a few plastic soda or water bottles (16-24 ounce size), rinse those out, and reuse them for your travel bottles... if you don't use those type of bottles for anything you drink, ask a couple of friends to save some for you, and wash them out."

I was using old 100%FOOD bottles to store my pre portioned joylent, then I shake them into my shaker bottle and drink from there. The problem with mixing and drinking from the 100%FOOD bottles is that they're a bitch to clean afterwards but I guess you could use a dishwasher, shaker bottles are just way easier to clean.   Another tip is to use a 750 ml coke bottle (or what have you) as a funnel. Just cut it in half, works like a charm."

soylent,3dhqq6,Synectar,2,Thu Jul 16 11:05:31 2015 UTC,It's a bit low on the Biotin and Chromium but looks like it should be ok otherwise.  The MCT powder is pretty cool though it does add a lot of unnecessary carbs with 14g of sugar in each 100g. Since you're adding olive and canola/rapeseed oil anyway you might as well use regular liquid MCT oil and save yourself some carbs.
soylent,3dhqq6,chrisbair,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the values of Biotin, Chromium and Molybdenum are low, but only when you compare them to the European Nutrient Reference Values - the multivitamin we use adheres do the US DRIs so the actual values of these three are in fact the same as in e.g. KetoChow.

soylent,3dg18w,Magroo,2,Thu Jul 16 07:31:09 2015 UTC,THIS 100%. I absolutely have to take a sip of water after I drink some Soylent. I also try to drink the serving in around three big chugs.

Thinking about it, it is unusual that it doesn't bother my stomach at all because I have mild IBS and acid reflux but Soylent has pretty much eliminated my reflux and made the IBS very minimal. I guess Soylent is perfect for me..."
soylent,3dg18w,ItsLeoMan,5,Thu Jul 16 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"It's a different consistency from what your body is used to.   Start with smaller servings, make sure you're drinking enough water, and definitely leave it in the fridge overnight (or blend with ice to chill it down).   If it's not for you, it's not for you; but going all-in all at once would be rough for anyone."

Liquid nutrition definitely takes some getting used to.   When I was first starting lifting weights, it was pretty hard to suffer down a big ass glass of some chalky protein, even though it was chocolate/brownie/peanut butter/vanilla whatever flavor.  It takes some getting used to. It's not a drink, it's not food. It probably doesn't taste quite right. Maybe try to ease into it"

I am never good about hydrating, and it is a real kick in the pants if I am thirsty and drink a glass of 1.5. Try to drink a glass of water the same size of your meal/snack before AND after."

If you exercise or sweat or just happen to need more salt, you're gonna get headaches and feel sick on the nothing that's in Soylent.   On top of that, even if someone is ""used to too much"" who even cares? There's not a one-size-fits-all rule for how much salt you should have. The right amount is the amount that makes you healthy, which varies with the person and is usually significantly more than 1500mg."

Oddly, my girlfriend actually liked it.  It turns out I hadn't let it chill enough in the fridge because when I tried it again the next day, when it had become very cold, it was a significantly more neutral experience. There's still an unusual texture to it but it was far more tolerable.  Overall it tastes like liquid flour to me, with a similar texture, and the colder it is the more that flavor goes away.  Now it hardly bothers me at all."

You barely taste chocolate, but its much nicer tasting than the stuff by itself.  Also mix it really well. I have a protein shaker with a spiral metal ball and 30 seconds of shaking makes a milkshake consistency that I have right away. Really helps."
soylent,3dg18w,djbon2112,0,Fri Jul 17 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"It kind of goes away after a couple weeks. You still don't want to chug it (that way lies nausea), and I recommend drinking water afterwards to wash out your throat, but you can tolerate a serving after you get used to it. Make sure you let it sit in the fridge overnight though. Don't even try to drink that shit warm.  It's really the liquid shits you have to get used to more than the incoming taste and texture abominations. ;)"

I would usually eat nothing in the morning then probably have fast food at lunch. I started Soylent to end that shity cycle. Even just a few days in and I'm actually performing better, with the exception of frequent trips to the bathroom.

When I was eating solid foods I'd generally not need to snack in the morning, then eat lunch at noon, then sometime between 2 and 3 every day I'd need to snack. Then dinner at 6, and a snack or two after.  That's basically exactly what I do with soylent, and I always feel sated. On the rare occasions that I do still feel hungry I just eat more soylent.

I still go to the bathroom whenever I need to fart, due to the smell, but the farts are less gambling now anyways. I can usually tell now, and am not constantly feeling like I have to poo when it was just a fart.  But yeah, I experienced the same thing, and I started on 1.5.

soylent,3ddig3,quealqueef,17,Wed Jul 15 12:36:46 2015 UTC,"That's in a lot of ways the approach we took with KetoSoy -- get the nutrition down first then work on price.    Isolated Milk Protein -- twice the cost of rice protein, but there's good evidence that it is more muscle building and less anti-ketogenic than anything else on the market.  Our Oil Blend -- Mixing 5 oils together is more hassle than 1 or 2 or none, but we believe getting the ratio of Omega3 and Omega6 right + getting the same ratio of fats as stored in the human body is the best blend for our customers.  (after a few dozen requests, we're releasing a reformulation of our oil blend as a standalone cooking oil next week http://www.omegaoil.co)  High Fat Dutched Cocoa -- More expensive, and more troublesome to work with than other flavoring elements, but it packs the right flavor and nutrition.  Ceylon Cinnamon -- We tried 10 different suppliers of cinnamon before we settled on this one.  It is sweet-spicy not spicy-harsh like a lot of other cinnamon blends.  Wheat Grass Powder -- We wanted to be conscious not just for what we know is necessary nutritionally, but also for what might be recognized as new needs in the future.  Vitamin K we know is necessary, but there's good reason to believe that other phytonutrients are either good or essential for human health.  We include wheat grass, coconut flour, cinnamon, cocoa powder, etc in the rawest form practical to guard against unknown needs, future discoveries in nutrition.

soylent,3ddig3,chrisbair,5,Thu Jul 16 12:09:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think we know enough about nutrition to be sure.  My gut instinct tells me a truly optimal variant would be molecularly ""pure"" nutrients (the exact ratio would be a matter of endless debate, and variable amongst individuals anyway) rather than food (animal/plant) derived component ingredients.  But my gut instinct could very well be wrong as there may be absorption or uptake issues that we simply don't know about.  Suffice to say, without paying hundreds to thousands per shake at first, this idea probably isn't feasible anyway!"
soylent,3ddig3,dalebewan,4,Wed Jul 15 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"There is no one size fits all answer to this question. Optimal in what regard? There are different parameters to optimize - some would include; time, money, digestion, ease-of-use, energy, blood glucose/diabetic considerations, and the list goes on.  My goals respectively are energy, body fat composition, and time. I opt for keto because, in terms of energy, it's a night and day difference between a carb based diet. I also require less sleep in ketosis (time). It also keeps my body fat percentage in check.  From there, you are probably best served by seeking out bioavailable micronutrient forms. Typically they are chelated vitamins, meaning they are bound to amino acids. These vitamins are typically harder to get and more expensive than the traditional forms.  For macronutrients it's hard to determine what ""good quality"" is but we can hypothesize on what might be better. We can proactively seek macros with reduced contaminants (pesticides, processing chemicals, natural contaminants, etc). We can also look for macronutrients which have been minimally processed as to ensure they have not been degraded or compromised in anyway and that the integrity of the nutrient remains intact.   To achieve this aim I use organic extra virgin olive oil which has been cold pressed. I also make sure to attain product that is as fresh as possible. Similarly we use extracted coconut oil which has a fairly good pedigree for health benefits and offers no real potential for problems due to the way it is harvested.  For carbohydrates we use pure fructose which is the same sugar found in fruit and vegetables. Because it's extracted there shouldn't be any risk of contaminants due to pesticides as there would be with whole fruit or whole vegetable.  The protein we use is a complex of fast digesting and slow digesting. There is a belief that slow digesting food is somehow superior to fast digesting food (I'm not entirely sold on this), so we aim for the middle.  TLDR; ""Optimal ingredients"" is too vague to draw any real meaning with you have to define measurable parameters by which to optimize."

Rob said in his recent AMA that they could reduce the costs of Soylent right now if they want, but they are keeping their profit margins higher during the early growth stages of the company to fund their expansion.  From everything he said it sounds like his general plan is to maximize market share by expanding to every country possible (ie Europe), then work on getting prices as low as possible."

From there, there are optimal macros that we do calculate specifically for you based on weight, gender, activity level & health goals. We then use the RDI amounts based on age & gender.  Our algorithm keeps things safe by making sure all these requirements + other key things (i.e protein source ratios for optimal amino acid profile) are met 100%.  Regardless of what your numbers are, we keep the price consistent."

I'm an eater of coffee beans, and I love having them ground up in my smoothies, but, to me, ground coffee in my soylent was nasty.  It's interesting that you're using kava -- I was looking into adding kava or st. john's wort into mine, which led me to studies that showed no real efficacy (outside Germany, which is weird), which led me to look at lysine, which basically has the desired effect of the supplements I was looking to add -- I have to say that I've been very even-keeled and happy since I went to ~80%."

soylent,3dad5w,dalebewan,2,Wed Jul 15 06:36:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have tried Joylent. In fact, it was my first soylent type ever. After Joylent I tried Queal 2.0 and preferred it over Joylent, namely Queal's flavours and mouth-feel. The flavours were more outspoken than Joylent's, and I liked Queal's powdery taste. These two things I liked were things others specifically disliked, some stating the flavours were ""too sweet"".  So, yeah, it all very much boils down to personal preference. Also, I used Joylent around ... March, I think. I also think Joylent's recipe has been updated/tweaked since then, so I cannot really make a fair comparison anymore, which is why I don't.  On a side note, I use weekends and evenings when trying a new product. If you have a ""normal"" dinner and don't want to take any chances, I suggest you wait for the weekend :-)."

I definitely will wait for the weekend, but actually, I don't generally eat traditional food at all anymore.  I'm on nearly 100% soylent meals.  I also tried Queal 2.0 some time ago and really quite liked it.  For me, the flavours were different, but were nearly tied for ""quality"" with Joylent (some aspects better, some worse, but overall both were very good).  The reason I chose Joylent over Queal was not having to add the oil.  Now that that's out of the equation for Queal as well, I'm giving them another shot.  To note: I actually started with Joylent some time around last September when they also used oil.  Once they got rid of it, I never wanted to go back to a product with oil again."

soylent,3dad5w,dalebewan,2,Wed Jul 15 12:58:32 2015 UTC,Will do :)
soylent,3dad5w,Waterkonijn,2,Wed Jul 15 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"I've had a chance to try it now, so here's my comparison:  Mixing: Both excellent.  Both Joylent and Queal are easy to mix, don't 'clump' and don't require excessive work to get mixed.  A simple shake in the provided shaker with blender ball works perfectly.  I give both a 10/10.  Mouthfeel: Both very good.  Queal has a slight advantage over Joylent in being a little smoother and slightly thicker with the same amount of water (but not overly thick).  Joylent gets an 8/10, Queal gets a 9/10.  Taste: Queal has more flavours; but I prefer the Joylent flavours so far (only tried Queal Apple Pie and Strawberry so far; so I can't comment on the others yet).  Queal is definitely very drinkable and even enjoyable, but it's just a little too sweet to be an ""all the time"" meal replacement.  For one or two meals a day, or all day a couple of times a week, sure, but all meals of Queal every day would definitely get tiresome/sickly even with the wider selection of flavours.  I give Joylent an 8/10, Queal a 6/10.  Price: Both are very well priced, but Joylent is a little cheaper.  Joylent gets 10/10, Queal gets 9/10.  Satiety: Joylent wins here as well, which surprised me given the slightly thicker nature of Queal.  After a 1/4 bag of Joylent, I feel happily full, but not overly stuffed.  After a 1/4 bag of Queal, I felt like I could still eat something (I didn't, and didn't feel the need for more; but I definitely wasn't as sated as I am with Joylent).  Joylent gets 9/10, Queal gets 7/10.  So, both are really excellent products, and I'll definitely enjoy the rest of the Queal on my shelf, but I'll be sticking with Joylent as my main source of nutrition.  Total scores: Joylent 45/50; Queal 41/50. (personal ratings only; individual tastes and preferences vary.  I would definitely highly recommend Queal to others who are looking at getting in to powdered food products)"

soylent,3daakr,rajlego,6,Tue Jul 14 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say they have a point - the long-term effects of living entirely on Soylent are largely unknown, as this is a relatively new experimental food.  On the other hand, a couple of counterpoints: a) a few people have been living on entirely or mostly Soylent for over a year, with no issues whatsoever (so far), b) Soylent is food, because it's made of exactly the same stuff that food is made out of, so there's that.  All that said, most people don't live entirely on Soylent, but use it as a replacement meal for crappy convenience meals (fast food, breakfast cereal, break-room sandwiches, etc.), much in the same way on one might use Slimfast, Ensure, or something like that. Used that way, you're using it the way most Soylent people do, and in a way your folks are comfortable with, so no worries!"
soylent,3daakr,be_bo_i_am_robot,5,Tue Jul 14 19:11:48 2015 UTC,Depends on your definition of long term. The truth is it really hasn't been around long enough to claim any thing past a couple years.   But it's just food.
soylent,3daakr,Dirk-Killington,5,Tue Jul 14 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Soylent has really prompted me to start thinking more about what foods we typically eat. It seems a knee jerk reaction is to call Soylent ""not real food"", but it's no less real than all of the other processed stuff that people are eating every day. How natural is breakfast cereal? How natural is bread? Everything outside of the realm of straight up fruits and vegetables is processed using a few key ingredients of things that we would typically not be eating on our own. Would I be eating a lot of wheat if it were not processed into flour, combined with other ingredients and baked? How is that more ""real food"" than Soylent?  Soylent is no different than most foods people are eating every day, it just has a much better and more balanced nutritional profile."
soylent,3daakr,DennisVanWelker,5,Tue Jul 14 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"Your parents are just concerned for your health, and depending on your age, they might think you are still vulnerable to scams and misinformation.  Maybe it would help to read through the ingredient list with them?  Soylent is not some kind of mystery mix. It's ingredients are exactly the same as found in all other modern food, and if there were any serious deficiencies, they would have shown up by now."
soylent,3daakr,Cancori,2,Tue Jul 14 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're under 18, your body and mind are still developing, so your parents are probably right. Soylent is not recommended for children anyway. It is better to stick to well-known, traditionally healthy foods as your primary nutrition sources until Soylent has been studied long term.  Soylent is based on the best nutritional research available today, but the depth of nutritional knowledge available is still woefully slim and we are discovering new things all the time. It's much better to be safe than to face the possibility of not living to your full potential due to unforseen circumstances. We know that people can live on soylent, but we do not know for certain that developing humans can thrive on it."

soylent,3daakr,PM_ME_UR_NUDIBRANCHS,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:58 2015 UTC,Not a reasonable claim.  As others have said it's food. The ingredients are known. They have been selected with greater care toward nutrition than the ingredients used in other food. It actually avoids many known problems with existing diets. Historically people have eaten homogenous diets out of necessity at times. This is an improvement of existing food and there's no reason to think that it would have any serious unexpected results. They're always possible but life cannot continue if we try to prepare for every unknown.

soylent,3d6nl7,moxiemooz,5,Mon Jul 13 23:01:17 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to use a blender for soylent unless you're adding stuff that needs chopping, such as fruit. Shaking it is sufficient (put water in, then powder; it mixes easier). You should shake it again before drinking or pouring it if it's sat for more than a few minutes; it tends to settle quickly. It'll last at least 2 days safely in the fridge, and the texture changes the longer it sits so it's a matter of experimentation for how long you want to keep it in the fridge. Separation is normal, it might even separate into layers, so just shake until it's well mixed again.  If having 2 sealed containers is more convenient for you, then you should do that. It's up to you. A 500 calorie serving of soylent, mixed according to directions is something like 24 oz in volume, but may be more if you're adding other things to it, so you might want larger containers if you plan to add things to it."
soylent,3d6nl7,PM_ME_UR_NUDIBRANCHS,4,Tue Jul 14 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"Read the instructions booklet and the faq please.

soylent,3d6nl7,_ilovetofu_,2,Mon Jul 13 23:08:33 2015 UTC,I just got mine last week too. What I do is prepare the entire thing in the provided container. I then mix it in a blender and add a packet of frozen fruits (the $5 bag I buy has 4 packets in it). I then add 2 small scoops of cocoa powder. I mix it all for about 20-30 seconds and then refill the provided container with it. I then have these two shaker bottles and in the morning put 1/4 of the big container in each.   Thats 500 - 600 calories for breakfast (when you add in the fruits and cocoa powder) and 500-600 calories for lunch. I then find something around 500 calories for dinner. A 2 week order will then last me a full month. And yeah the provided container keeps the next days safe. I think I read that 2-3 days is fine after being made.

I prep it the night before in a blender bottle (2 scoops Soylent, four scoops water, shake vigorously) and let it sit in the fridge overnight to cool because it tastes better than prepping and consuming it warm/right away.   I only once prepped a whole pitcher, and even with a blender bottle couldn't get it all to mix in. There were dry bits stuck to the sides and I ended up pouring/scraping it into a blender. I would definitely recommend prepping it that way if you want to do a whole bag at a time, 1.5 has had many people complain that it doesn't mix as well."

From exactly 1.6 liters of room temperature water, fill the pitcher which comes with the first order about halfway. Add roughly half the bag of Soylent, seal, and shake for 30 seconds. Add the remainder of the Soylent and the remainder of the water, seal, and shake again. Zero trouble getting it to mix thoroughly. The above is right out of the manual."
soylent,3d6nl7,Chris770,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"1.5 doesn't require the use of a blender, it mixes quite well if you add it to water and shake it in the manner suggested in the instruction booklet, wherein most of your questions are answered. How you choose to make use of it in your diet is ultimately up to you and your tastes.  If you want to blend things in with it, an electric blender is necessary. To start with, I recommend buying fruit you like and adding a handful or so in a blender to each batch, as the very mildly pleasant flavor of Soylent brings out fruit flavors nicely. Just experiment from there.  Do read the manual."
soylent,3d6tu7,psaldorn,7,Mon Jul 13 23:49:38 2015 UTC,There is a batch of flash-dried banana powder stuck at the border for inspection.

If you want your order quicker and do not mind if it lacks Banana Joylent please state that to love@joylent.eu and we will take care of that.   As a solution we recently attracted an investor.

Always looking for interesting flavours to add to Joylent with its lack of neutral flavours.   PB2/Nutella/Coffee syrups all work well with some of the base flavours. Essences (vanilla, almond) seem okay too. Anything obvious I've not tried yet? Bonus points for low calorie options."
soylent,3d6v90,dalebewan,5,Tue Jul 14 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"As per a previous post of mine in here, I've found e-cigarette flavourings (which are really just food flavourings) work very well; but they're definitely on the expensive side.  A while ago, I ordered a large amount of e-cig liquid flavourings to mix my own and found that some of the flavours I really like, but don't work well in an e-cig (for me).  From there, I started trying them in my Joylent and some of them are really good.  Especially good in Joylent are:   Vanilla Custard in Banana Joylent: it brings out the banana a lot more and makes it more like a Banana Custard flavour. Banana Nut Bread in Vanilla Joylent: it overpowers the vanilla taste completely and makes it taste a lot like, well, as the name suggests, Banana Nut Bread. Caramel Cappuccino in Strawberry Joylent: It's a little 'interesting' to have caramel, coffee and strawberry notes all mixed together, but I really enjoy it."
soylent,3d6v90,dalebewan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly all of my ecig flavours are tobacco + flavour, which might be a bit weird (I'll give it a go when new vanilla arrives though)  Because I'm limiting calorific intake I've been having partial meals, 100g here, 130g there. Meaning I had to mix up premades anyway, I quite like the coffee flavour mixed with others.   How much do you use per meal/shaker? Banana nut bread sounds great. Might have to see if I can get some other nut essences and put it in the next banana batch.   Thanks for the info!"
soylent,3d6v90,moxiemooz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"Per shaker (600ml to 700ml), I put about 5ml of the flavouring, which gives a mild but noticeable taste in general.  Stronger flavourings can get away with a little less (or the same amount but a stronger taste) and weaker flavourings may even need up to 10ml.  For a really strong flavour that completely overtakes the original, you'd probably want to use 15ml, but personally I'm not a fan of flavours that strong now that I'm used to the mild tastes of most soylents in general.  That in mind, it's why I said it's not really a practical/cheap option, given that 15ml of flavour runs around €5 for most typical flavours, so it's a significant percentage of the cost when compared to the base price of Joylent itself."

soylent,3d4pci,DarkTriadBAMN,117,Mon Jul 13 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"To add a bit of perspective.  The comparison to Coca Cola is simply an inflammatory statement and is not relevant to the discussion.  The GL of 100 calories of Coca Cola is 16, while the GL of 500 calories of Soylent is 35.  If we compare equal calories of Coca Cola and Soylent, you can see that Soylent has 44% the GL of Coca Cola.    Also for comparison, looking at 500 calorie servings of various foods, watermelon is 33, whole-wheat bread is 38, 2% milk is 40, oatmeal is 55, black beans are 30, and peas are 33.  So yes, Rosa Labs should be working towards reducing the GL of Soylent.  But no, their values aren't insanely high, and the comparison to Coca Cola was just to generate upvotes."
soylent,3d4pci,dreiter,2,Mon Jul 13 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"the comparison to Coca Cola was just to generate upvotes   Would a comparison to a McDonald's Chocolate Shake be more fair? Same glycemic load, similar number of calories."
soylent,3d4pci,unsafeword,17,Mon Jul 13 22:17:43 2015 UTC,Well you can compare them but it doesn't mean much.  500 calories of the shake has a GL of 41 compared to Soylent's 35.
soylent,3d4pci,dreiter,56,Mon Jul 13 22:32:24 2015 UTC,"Lots of criticism and difficult questions here.

That's worth a lot of trust."
soylent,3d4pci,unsafeword,13,Mon Jul 13 18:59:53 2015 UTC,Why it it the silent consent here on reddit that a high glycemic load is bad for your health and puts you at risk for diabetes?   I quickly researched this linking and couldn't come up with any legit studies with that result. Someone prove me wrong please.
soylent,3d4pci,blueb34r,3,Tue Jul 14 00:17:38 2015 UTC,There's a few cited here to get you started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_load
soylent,3d4pci,Bilbo_Fraggins,8,Tue Jul 14 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Fructose has a lower GI/GL because it must be converted to glucose by the liver before your cells can use it and before it shows up in a blood sugar test so the HFCS55 used in soda will have a low value relative to the total amount of carbohydrates in it. Table sugar isn't far off since it's 50% fructose, just 5% less.  I looked at the testing methodology: a fasting participant is fed 50g of glucose and then blood sugar measured over 2 hours. Then you get the participant fasting again and give them enough of the test substance to equal 50g of available (non-fiber) carbohydrates. Repeat for 8-10 participants and average the deltas.  Just for kicks I did the math on what it would take to test the DIY ketogenic recipe I drink. The Rich Chocolate flavor has 6.0g of available carbohydrates in each meal so to get 50g a participant would need to ingest 8.3 meals worth. No thanks!"
soylent,3d4pci,chrisbair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, so for the glycemic index test they only test the carb source? I had the misconception that the people ate one meal of soylent. Well now I feel really stupid. I'll go ahead and get a glucose meter just to measure how I react to soylent anyways."
soylent,3d4pci,chrisbair,3,Mon Jul 13 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"There are 2 tests: one with 50g of pure glucose then you do another to that same individual (again fasting) with enough of the stuff you are testing to equal 50g of ""available"" (not fiber) carbohydrates. 1/4 of a pouch of soylent has 53g of available carbs which is pretty close so the second test would have about 110g of dry soylent 1.5 powder (mixed with water)."
soylent,3d4pci,chrisbair,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Well then I'm still concerned. Man, I swear to goodness I wanted to buy your keto chow but I jumped the gun since you were away till the 13th.

soylent,3d4pci,poonblaster69,29,Mon Jul 13 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"Well soylent site says   Soylent 1.5 has a medium-level glycemic index of 65    And Coca Cola has a glycemic index of 63   Coca Colaa®, average 63   Soylent site says   has a glycemic load of 35.    While Coca Cola is 16.     The glycemic index compares the potential of foods containing the same amount of carbohydrate to raise blood glucose. However, the amount of carbohydrate consumed also affects blood glucose levels and insulin responses. The glycemic load of a food is calculated by multiplying the glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate in grams provided by a food and dividing the total by 100    http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/glycemic-index-glycemic-load  The Coca Cola numbers are on 250ml of soda, the Soylent numbers are on 1 serving, if you fill the Takeya pitcher with soylent and water 1/4 of that 2quart pitcher is 473ml and change.  Also coke =  sugar and water, soylent = vitamins, minerals, proteins, fasts, carbohydrates. You're comparing rubbing alcohol to aviation turbine fuel ""well gee golly they're both liquid!""  Take the water out of coke and you have 27.47g (sugar being the only thing measured on the label) in the 250ml, where a serving of soylent is 115g (everything). That means there is 4.18x more stuff in the serving of soylent than there is the 250ml of coke yet it only has TWICE the load. I'd call that winning!!"
soylent,3d4pci,ryanmercer,8,Mon Jul 13 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"settle down there, champ. nobody would suggest living off of coca-cola, even if vitamin fortified. the question is how does it compare to real food.  http://www.lowglycemicload.com/glycemic_table.html  Steak is under 15 for both index and load. So is chicken. Spaghetti noodles are better than Soylent, so is yogurt, as is pretty much every other kind of real food.  And Index is not dependent on the serving size - to have a glycemic index higher than Coca Cola is embarrassing. That's what a macronutrient percentage of 45% carb (based mostly on sugar, notwithstanding their handwaving about isomaltulose) will do.  I don't think it used to be this bad for Soylent - I did check this before the pre-1.4 change."

Take that steak and add a carb source and adjust the weight to be the same weight as a serving of Soylent and I bet you'd have damn similar numbers."
soylent,3d4pci,_ilovetofu_,8,Mon Jul 13 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Though what's interesting is when you combine carb sources with things like high-fiber / high-protein foods, the glycemic index can change radically.  This table shows that a plain pizza can have a GI of 80, while a supreme pizza has a GI of 36. So the fact that Soylent, as a full meal, still has a GI of 65 is worrying. I wonder how much the number would change with the addition of more fiber and protein."
soylent,3d4pci,porkbacon,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:36 2015 UTC,the GL measures carbs minus fiber so it would not change the numbers at all unless the overall carbs were lowered.
soylent,3d4pci,_ilovetofu_,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"Glycemic load of a serving of food is its carbohydrate content measured in grams (g), multiplied by the food's GI, and divided by 100. Changing the GI absolutely would have an effect, all else being equal."
soylent,3d4pci,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jul 13 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I was thinking of it affecting the GL formula, but you're right it should have an effect on the GI which would then change the GL."
soylent,3d4pci,porkbacon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:16:58 2015 UTC,I wonder how many people these tests are done on to determine the GI. People vary wildly and take two humans and the same tablespoon of sugar can do completely different things to them.
soylent,3d4pci,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jul 13 17:05:11 2015 UTC,"There is a bit of variation in them, sure. And different tests often yield slightly different numbers. That said, your testing methodology would have to be hilariously flawed to have the difference between a GI of 80 and 36 be entirely explained by error."
soylent,3d4pci,porkbacon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"would have to be hilariously flawed to have the difference between a GI of 80 and 36 be entirely explained by error.   Not really. Humans are genetically diverse to the extremes, nevermind the fact that the gut biome is also proving to have a lot to do with responses to food we consome. If they tested it on 5 people they could have easily have found a few that responded wildly to the Soylent where the other 2 had lower numbers, add the 5 together and average it and those 3 that responded wildly change the average considerably.  If they tested it on 100 people you could still have a significant number of people that for genetic, or gut biome, reasons react differently. We already know of certain genetic combinations that increase risk to things such as diabetes. Some humans have the bitter tastebud genes (I do, PTC makes me want to fold inside out and explode it tastes so terible) and could easily cause wild variation in blood sugar responses, some people can fast for extended periods fine and some can't fast for more than a handful of hours without experiencing blood sugar issues.  You then have to look at things someone may have caused via their diet. Insulin sensitivity can be changed in either direction depending on diet. Hell you can improve insulin resistance with any number of glucose disposal agents if you don't even want to improve it via diet. Were all of the participants similar as far as insulin resistance? Where they as a whole indicative of the global average for insulin resistance? Was their dietary intake all identical for a day or five leading up to the test? Were any of them on medications that may be acting as glucose disposal agents? What sort of physical activity had they all been doing the day before and that day (had any of them been doing intense activity for an extended period while on low-moderate carb diet that resulted in them being in a state of glycogenesis when they consumed the soylent, causing a far different reaction than if they weren't creating glycogen from fat stores to replenish muscle stores?) etc."
soylent,3d4pci,fn0000rd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth the pizza part was an excerpt from a study that analyzed several previous GI studies to produce a massive data set. The supreme pizza piece was from a sample size of ten people with no insulin abnormalities (http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/suppl/2008/09/18/dc08-1239.DC1/TableA1_1.pdf).  I would like to think that if Soylent is gathering GI data for their product, they'd invest enough money to have a fairly reliable result.  From the service they used for GI testing:   The standard glycemic index determination protocol requires that ten normal subjects are studied on multiple occasions (maximum 3 per week) in the morning after an overnight fast. After 2 fasting blood samples are taken, subjects eat a test meal containing 50g available carbohydrate and have further blood samples taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after starting to eat. Capillary blood is obtained by finger-prick and whole blood glucose is determined on-site in our laboratory with an automatic analyzer using the glucose oxidase method.   Seems fairly standardized to me (and considering that most GI information is obtained from sample sizes of around 10, the professionals seem to think that 10 is enough people)"

The pastas section have about the same glycemic index as soylent overall. Most of the items in the fruits, bread, and cereal sections, as well as potatoes and tofu have significantly higher glycemic index than soylent does. I'm not going to do the math, but, I think this would work out fairly well once you factor in and balance everything out.   From the chart you linked, I would just doubt how good the glycemic index is as at accurately measuring health. I don't think many people would consider tofu or oatmeal or watermelon unhealthy, yet they have a higher glycemic index per serving than coke."

Next we'll learn something like a high-protein diet results in the accumulation of some kind of toxin and the whole cycle will begin anew.  Folks who have gone all-Soylent have lost weight. A high GI normally causes weight gain.  I think the old adages hold- Stay active, keep total calories low, watch the fat/carb/protein proportions, enjoy life.

I think we should have a discussion on how soylent should evolve and I believe (and the study I'll link below shows) that high glycemic loads are a big risk factor for diabetes.     Type 2 diabetes mellitus After a high-glycemic load meal, blood glucose levels rise more rapidly and insulin demand is greater than after a low-glycemic load meal. High blood glucose levels and excessive insulin secretion are thought to contribute to the loss of the insulin-secreting function of the pancreatic β-cells that leads to irreversible diabetes (6). High dietary glycemic loads have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in several large prospective studies. In the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), women with the highest dietary glycemic loads were 37% more likely to develop type 2 DM over a 6-year period than women with the lowest dietary glycemic loads (7). Additionally, women with high-glycemic load diets that were low in cereal fiber were more than twice as likely to develop type 2 DM than women with low-glycemic load diets that were high in cereal fiber. The results of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), which followed male health professionals over six years were similar (8). In the NHS II study, a prospective study of younger and middle-aged women, those who consumed foods with the highest glycemic index values and the least cereal fiber were also at significantly higher risk of developing type 2 DM over the next eight years (9). The foods that were most consistently associated with increased risk of type 2 DM in the NHS and HPFS cohorts were potatoes (cooked or French-fried), white rice, white bread, and carbonated beverages (6). The Black Women's Health study, a prospective study in a cohort of 59,000 US black women, found that women who consumed foods with the highest glycemic index values had a 23% greater risk of developing type 2 DM over eight years of follow-up compared to those who consumed foods with the lowest glycemic index values (10). In the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II, which followed 124,907 men and women for nine years, high glycemic load was associated with a 15% increased risk of type 2 DM (11). Further, in a cohort of over 64,000 Chinese women participating in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, high glycemic load was associated with a 34% increase in risk of type 2 DM; this positive association was much stronger among overweight women (12). http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/glycemic-index-glycemic-load#glycemic-load     All I'm saying is that this concerns me and that I think it should be discussed further."
soylent,3d4pci,ryanmercer,8,Mon Jul 13 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"that high glycemic loads are a big risk factor for diabetes.   As I just detailed in another comment, you're looking at two wildly different things.  Serving size for the index: Coke 250ml/8.45 ounces, soylent 1 serving (1/4 of a pouch)  Fat: Coke = 0, Soylent = 23g.  Carbohydrates: Coke = 27.47g, Soylent = 57g  Sugars: Coke = 27.47, Soylent = 15g  Protein: Coke = 0g, Soylent = 20g    So before you can have an accurate comparison, you first need to have an equal unit of measure.   Take the water out of coke and you have 27.47g (sugar being the only thing measured on the label) in the 250ml, where a serving of soylent is 115g (everything).

The only product I have come across which doesn't have maltodextrin is Huel. Why use maltodextrin when there are far better carbs such as oats which has a low GI. Version 1.6 has to address the issue of GI as it is not healthy to consume such a high level up to three times daily.

soylent,3d4pci,bobpaul,3,Mon Jul 13 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"The reported glycemic load for Soylent (35) is about on par with a Big Mac, Diet Coke, and small fries (22+0+14=36). If you're good with that McDonald's meal from an insulin response standpoint - and I mean four times a day - then no further questions are needed. Otherwise it would be great if Soylent could get the number down.  For what it's worth, dietary guidelines for people interested in controlling or preventing Type II Diabetes suggest keeping the total daily glycemic load under 100 for a diet of 2,000 calories. That said, nutrition science is a pretty messy area with lots of U turns over time. Most of us have seen eggs flip from good to evil and back again in our lifetimes, for example. But for anyone who is concerned about those guidelines, four meals of Soylent is 40% over the daily recommended maximum for a 2,000 calorie diet."

Soylent 1.4: Better than 1.3, but still hard to take. Purelent: Very neutral taste, which was quite okay, but the texture put me off (much too thick and chunky). Queal, original recipe: Quite nice taste, having to add oil was too annoying. Mana: Very neutral taste and texture was reasonable.  Again though, adding oil is a no-go for me for long term use and although the texture was okay, it wasn't 'good'. SoylentLife: Sickly sweet with very artificial tasting flavours and also has texture problems. Joylent: As mentioned, my favourite.  It's not without problems (a few delivery issues in the past, and one unannounced temporary recipe change that ruined the flavour of one batch), but nothing serious so far.   Currently I'm awaiting an order of Nano, and an order of the new recipe Queal (which doesn't require extra oil).  Another user here - /u/amazonv - has tried a lot more than I have.  Her findings are here.  Of course, everyone's tastes are different (for example, /u/amazonv likes Rosa Labs Soylent, whereas I don't), so while our suggestions might be a helpful guide, you might find you prefer something else entirely."
soylent,3d27hh,eVALV,2,Mon Jul 13 06:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'm on day 3 of soylent and have tried just soylent(+water) - could only drink about 3/5 before gag reflex was too strong, soylent+pb - which was good but too oily towards the end, and now soylent + frozen strawberries/mango/peach blended together. It actually almost tastes good now. Maybe just mango isn't enough?"

Tomorrow I am making 3 batches of single serve for the day.   Frozen Fruit Medly Cocoa Powder My existing chocolate protein powder that I enjoy on it's own.   Tomorrow, I will add some mango nectar by itself to replace 1/2 or 2/3 of the water.  Lastly, I think I will try adding the powder to an existing morning fruit smoothie milkshake I love.  Will report back."
soylent,3d27hh,SowakaWaka,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"I put in 3-4 strawberry pieces, 1-2 mango and 1 peach. I'm also planning on grabbing some Whey (strawberry probably, just because I already use frozen strawberries) and adding that to the mix. Good luck!"
soylent,3d27hh,fn0000rd,2,Mon Jul 13 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"Nestle Quick!  The old fashioned powdered chocolate milk mix.  You can get it at any grocery store, and it's fairly cheap.  I add one tablespoon per serving of solylent (4 per pitcher)  but you could add more if needed.  If you are worried about the added sugar, you could try the no sugar added version of it.  Citrus sounds awful in soylent. Soylent has an oatmeal/cream of wheat - ish flavor.  It would be like orange juice on oatmeal.  Other easy options:   candy flavorings, you can get them at craft stores flavored syrups - the kind you use for coffee, I use torani vanilla honey or maple syrup, but you'll need a blender to blend it in vanilla extract/cinnamon applesauce (surprisingly good, cinnamon applesauce was great) baking extracts - vanilla, coconut, almond, etc peanut butter powder - sold near the PB at most grocers now, blends better than the real thing frozen banana slices in the blender - gives flavor and texture   Another caution about the citrus, I'd be concerned that if you made a citrus batch by the pitcher, that the acid content would spoil the soylent fairly quickly.  it is probably fine for single-serving mixing though.  The nestle quick powder is great if you take dry powder with you - just throw it in with your dry mix - it's designed to dissolve easily in cold liquids."
soylent,3d27hh,rook2pawn,2,Mon Jul 13 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"I blend one banana with every 1.5-2 scoops of Soylent I drink and let it sit overnight, it makes it much more bearable and even enjoyable. Sometimes I'll also add a heaping teaspoon of peanut butter to that.   I also mixed some instant coffee in with this morning's soylent and it's more bearable but not as amazing as blending a banana."
soylent,3d27hh,sleepycorn,2,Mon Jul 13 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"Cocoa powder and either a banana or some frozen raspberries, plus a little bit of sweetener (I use agave nectar).  I'm craving it as we speak. Or write. Or whatever."
soylent,3d27hh,psaldorn,2,Tue Jul 14 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"i agree, it tastes like uncooked pancake batter.  The best sweeteners and flavorings seem to just ""mask"", but not actually change the flavor, like flavored pancake batter? Perhaps with enough blueberries and strawberries it could get better, or an extra heaping of nestle powder, but overall the 1.5 formulation seems less good than the 1.4. I hope 1.6 is an improvement or i may switch to joylent."

Mine is citric, malic, and tartaric acid. I used to put it in green smoothies to make them less boring, and cut the sweetness of fruit. It worked."

I don't like it after its Sat overnight personally, not sure if it went sour though.  Coffee syrups are good, add before you eat not when you make a batch.  Amazon has lots of favouring too, literally just search for ""flavouring"".   Cocoa powder, ginger, tea, chai powder, fresh fruit (blended),  check out the ""favouring"" flair on other posts to limit the shredding to flavour discussions. Maybe even try baking it into a solid.

soylent,3d001g,dalebewan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:17:28 2015 UTC,"Some people seem to be really bothered by the sunflower oil, whereas others don't seem to notice it at all. I wonder if that's what you're experiencing?  I have a hypothesis that the ""awful sunflower oil taste"" thing is genetic, just like the ""cilantro tastes like soap"" thing (which I have).  In any case, for me, taste is mostly irrelevant. It's not designed for taste. As long as it doesn't taste like dog shit, I'm happy.  I think the guys at Rosa should perhaps experiment with something other than sunflower oil, though. If Soylent had cilantro in it, for example, I'd still use it, but yeah I'd be admittedly less happy with it I suppose. But fuck it, soapy Soylent still means no cooking!"

Back when I did traditional food, I generally use rapeseed/canola oil for cooking and I'm not sure I ever tried sunflower oil that I know of.  That could be it.  Then again, I did enjoy eating sunflower seeds, so also maybe not (I have no idea how much the seeds might or might not have the oil in them in an appropriate form to taste it).  I might experiment and find out.  I also don't consume soylents for a pleasant taste, but for me it does have to be 'not unpleasant'.  Especially when it leaves a lingering aftertaste on my breath that bothers me for a good hour or so after consuming it (brushing teeth only hides it until the toothpaste taste disappears, then there it is again).  By the way, I just learned something new: North Americans apparently commonly call coriander ""cilantro"".  I'd never heard that before, but Google enlightened me.  (and I personally don't have whatever genetic makeup it takes to make it taste like soap)"

We spend maybe $700 for 4 people not trying to be frugal. I'll be generous and say $1100 with snacks and eating out. If we replaced food with Soylent, it would cost almost $200 more (Canada).   But there might be savings over time replacing eating out or having takeout here and there."
soylent,3cw1b9,Asks-Qs,2,Sat Jul 11 06:54:26 2015 UTC,I was hoping soylent would save me money while letting me eat out just as much. now it doesn't seem like there's much savings unless I go nearly 100% soylent and maybe just 1 or 2 takeout meals per week.

I have the bad habit of not packing anything and either skipping breakfast/lunch or buying fast food.    I am trying to replace these ""lack of foresight"" meals with soylent. Right now we are planning on it costing about the same (about 1000cal/day),  but eventually I think I will save even more.   That's just more money that we can spend on nice restaurants.  ;-)"

I was glad to have had it, because I first drove 2200 miles, lived in a small little motel room for 2 weeks, had to apartment hunt, all while starting work in the new location.  Now that I finally have my apartment I still have a full list of things to do.  90% of my non-working, waking time has been spent getting productive things done.  This is my other 10% time actually getting to unwind a bit, and thus being on reddit.  I've been having soylent for breakfast and dinner every day, eating fast food once a day while I'm out and about.  This has saved me a bunch of time and money by having it.  Time because I didn't have to grocery shop, cook or clean excessive dishes, or even go back to the motel/apartment.  Money because if I wanted to cut out what I saved time on, I'd be eating fast food for every meal every day.  $3 per meal vs $5-8 per meal grows significant over the more meals replaced.  I'm glad I had soylent to help me with my move.  I'm sure I'll continue to consume it once I get in the swing of things, just back to less often like I did before."

If you're spending roughly the same money, but now spend less time preparing and cooking food, that's a net savings as well (perhaps calculate that by your normally hourly rate for work/freelance).  To answer the question in terms of raw dollars, I'm saving roughly $140 this month by not eating out or at the cafeteria for lunch at work (avg cost of lunch minus cost of Soylent per meal).

Dont't listen to the salesmen that managed to convince the entire world that just because you lift twice a week that somehow means you need insane amounts of protein. It's bullshit.   A good rule of thumb is 1g protein per day per KG of Bodyweight for an active, fit person. Ramp that up to 1.2 if you want to be sure you don't miss any of 'dem gains'.

soylent,3cudtx,SpacemanLeesBong,2,Fri Jul 10 21:25:54 2015 UTC,Do you have any source that is more medical and less fitness/protein powder oriented that recommends more than 80g per day?
soylent,3cudtx,Dubandubs,5,Fri Jul 10 21:30:33 2015 UTC,Macronutrients PDF from the Institute of Medicine that recommends average adults males consumer 56g of Protein which on average is using 0.8 g/kg of body weight.

I don't find myself craving anything else to eat, even when using it exclusively (along with a handful of fruit for a bit of extra flavor.) I'm not from Canada. Prepared exactly as directed, it has the same consistency and texture as most protein drink mixes. That is to say, not quite as thick as a milkshake, but somewhat thicker than condensed milk. Adding certain fruits can alter this, though not in any unappetizing way. Kiwi and Pineapple, in particular, seem to cause the mixture to thin considerably after being blended in. On the other hand, adding cantaloupe or honeydew melon seems to cause it to take on a slightly thicker consistency (which seems counterintuitive, and I don't know what causes that.) Treat it like a flavor ""canvas."" It has a very mildly pleasant flavor by itself, and seems to go very well with most fruit. I know one person who claims adding jalapeno in a blender is very acceptable, but some people will add those to anything and like it."

Soylent brings out the flavor of anything which is added to it, so it only takes maybe half a handful of strongly flavored fruit (kiwi, pineapple, raspberries, blackberries) or a handful of mild flavored fruit (strawberries, blueberries, cantaloupe chunks) to give it a very nice fruit flavor. This is all dependent on individual taste buds, I'm only basing this on my personal observations.  EDIT: Do shake before pouring each time, and serve chilled. It does separate somewhat while sitting a while, as there's a lot of fiber in it, but you won't notice this while drinking it so long as you give it a good shake before pouring a glass."

By making it as affordable as possible, it can have the greatest impact.  In that sense, it's all about 'gaming the metrics' in that Soylent is attempting to satisfy all of the known metrics for nutritional completeness in the most efficient manner.  Efficiency in turn can be defined in a multitude of ways: ease of manufacturing, ingredient availability, ingredient shelf-life, ease of preparation, cost, etc. etc.  You speak of ""optimal versions"" of ingredients, but it doesn't sound like you've put an ounce of thought into what that might actually mean. The patch notes said that one of the reasons for the added potato starch was an inability to source sufficient oat flour.  So one can imagine even more factors such as supply chain robustness, simplifying manufacturing, which, along with cost, could go into the decision to make an ingredients change."

Perhaps my original post could have been better worded ; j  I always read the patch notes; I'm familiar with them.  I find them interesting.  I understand that the soylent team employs nutritional specialists.  I understand that soylent justifies their changes publically, whether altering the ingredient chain, the product manufacturing or packaging, or dispersion.  This is all in line with a laudable marketing campaign focusing on transparency.  These posts are a great start, but asking for an objective (and knowledgeable) review/critique of these design decisions from a third party is not reprehensible.    I'm sure most if not all design choices benefit the vendor without affecting the consumer or benefit the vendor and the consumer mutually.  It's possible that the vendor, for whichever reason, might make a design decision which does not benefit the consumer as much as an alternative could.  I have no ability to know the difference, as this is not my field of expertise. I am not a knowledgeable reviewer.  It's why I am asking others."

This might be a cheaper option, but keep in mind that powdered canola costs quite a bit more than the canola oil you can pickup at the supermarket.

Magnesium, Vitamin D and Zinc have been shown to raise T levels in those that were not getting optimal levels of those and you were likely considerably magnesium deficient (most people are, I covered it very briefly in this post but basically even if you go get your magnesium level tested they are horribly inaccurate unlike a potassium test as your body only has roughly 1% of the magnesium in the blood and does all it can to keep that that level so you might be showing fine on a bloodtest but could actually be deficient)"

soylent,3cnl4j,elevul,7,Thu Jul 9 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"I have a question regarding the new recipe, more precisely about changes in the macros for Queal 3.0. By looking at the table you post here!, the big changes have been a decrease in fats and an increase in fibres. As you state it, this hardly affects the total energy (kCal).   To my knowledge, however, fats provide the highest amount of energy per gram of the macros (9kcal/g) whereas fibres hardly provide any energy (if they do so at all). How is it possible that this relative big decrease in fats (10,5% - 17,5%) hardly effects the total energy?"
soylent,3cnl4j,CassiusEU,3,Thu Jul 9 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"Any chance of offering another set of sample packs?  I went for samples last time they were on offer, and the flavours were great, but the texture not so much.  I'd be interested in trying V3.0 before buying say 30 meals (which is what I currently order at a time from Joylent)."
soylent,3cnl4j,Horrabin,2,Thu Jul 9 11:54:07 2015 UTC,"No more oil bottle     Great they needed that change.   New packaging     Also great, puts them on par with other 'lents'   Better texture and flavours    Never got to try the old one which is a shame. They say they made it less thick, i know some comparison threads with joylent said queal was more thick so im guessing they are more comparable now?   More expensive   Real shame but i guess understandable. A subscription order of 90 meals worth 2100kcal Queal (cheapest option) is at 165€ which isnt that bad though, still 15€ more expensive than joylent. But then i look at the other options (1800kcal, 2400kcal and Active) and they are priced at 180€ for 90 meals, why is that? 2100 seems to be cheaper around the board, is it using leftover 2.0 batches?  Queal is supposed to have 7 tastes but when making a subscription order i only see 6 with 1 being a 'unflavored' type not seen advertised anywhere else, im guessing this is a webdesign malfunction?"
soylent,3cnl4j,condsant,2,Thu Jul 9 09:32:39 2015 UTC,"No more oil bottle   Great they needed that change.   True, that is a very good change indeed.

They say they made it less thick, i know some comparison threads with joylent said queal was more thick so im guessing they are more comparable now?   The old one was, as you said, a bit more gritty.

Does anyone buy a monthly subscription of 90 meals? That would mean you had to eat Queal all day, every day. That seems a bit too restrictive.  In fact, I'm not a fan of any of the subscription plans since that would mean I had to plan and keep track of my meals, in addition to pretty much locking me in to Queal only. I usually go for the one-time orders and those are now much more expensive compared to Joylent. 90 meals of (one time) Queal are 205 EUR (195 + 10 EUR shipping for me) compared to 155 EUR (150 + 5 EUR shipping) for Joylent. That's a huge price gulf.   As for the flavours, I was hoping the ""Queal in Qontrol"" option for subscription orders was a new feature which they forgot to advertise; didn't realise it could be a malfunction. I really hope the unflavoured option is real. All the other normal flavours are available in the one-time order packs."

Very good point, i was trying to find the cheapest option but i guess its not the most reasonable one.    I didnt even think of the extra shipping cost. An extra 5€ is not a small amount, shipping to my country only inceased by 1,9€ which is reasonable if it gets handled better.

The other variants take up the same amount of logistics (production, SKUs, etc.), but those fixed costs need to be split among fewer sales. To account for that the price-point needs to be higher.  Sorry for the business-y explanation, I hope it makes sense!"
soylent,3cnl4j,dalebewan,2,Fri Jul 10 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"The price is also a bit of a sticking point with me, as others have mentioned.  It's not that I can't afford it, but more that if there's no significant advantage over my usual (Joylent), then why pay so much extra?  Nevertheless, I'm always open to trying new versions and new alternatives, and the only thing holding me back from Queal in the past was the separate oil, so I've put an order in just to try it out.  Unless this new recipe offers something significantly better than Joylent though, I can't see myself buying Queal regularly at this price."
soylent,3cnl4j,Synnyster,2,Fri Jul 10 05:19:26 2015 UTC,Very interesting they've improved their recipe. Going the Joylent route of natural flavourings and the Soylent route of integrated oil  Can't wait until my next subscription batch to give these a taste

soylent,3cnl4j,QuealEU,2,Thu Jul 9 12:57:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, the GI of Queal is below 70.  One of our customers who had access to a bloodmeasurement apparatus was kind enough recently to take measurements for us throughout the day whilst drinking Queal.  He said that drinking 1 meal of Queal with 400ml water, measuring every 15 minutes, he saw a climb from 4.7 mm/l to 5.3 mm/l after 30 minutes, and then leveling off to 5.2 mm/l after another hour."

soylent,3cnl4j,porkbacon,2,Thu Jul 9 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Maltodextrin has a high GI.  Having more protein/fiber with it generally lowers GI (because it becomes more difficult to digest). For an example of this in action, look at this table.  A plain pizza has a GI of 80, while a supreme pizza has a GI of 36. Now, mind you there can be a lot of fluctuation in GI measurements, but this is drastic enough to show the idea."

I considered a new Nutrilent batch or a Queal batch, but now I'm certain it'll be Queal as I'm very curious about the changes.  As for the talk about subscriptions, I always use a 90 meal subscription which I put on hold / cancel when it has shipped. If I want a new batch, I'll renew the subscription.

It's a pity because I was thinking next time I have to re-buy I'd get Queal again instead of Joylent because it was more cost effective, but now Queal's price is higher. I'll still think about it though as I haven't even tried it yet and maybe it worth the increase. It's still cheap living."
soylent,3cnl4j,koffiezet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:32:39 2015 UTC,"New packaging: nice  New recipe: we'll see, I only hope the integrated oil doesn't create the same 'slimy' texture as in Joylent. Not sure what causes it, but it took some serious getting used to.  New Shipping: nice, this gives you an edge over Joylent I guess - which somehow takes almost 2 weeks to get processed and shipped from .nl to .be  Shaker policy: Although I could use another 2 shakers, getting one with every order is a bit too much.  New price: Don't really care - was never a price thing for me. When I ordered a sandwich every day, I spent 5 to 7 eur a day on that, skipping breakfast. Now I don't even pay that much to eat breakfast and at noon, and the price increase doesn't change that  I have both Queal and Joylent. I prefer the Queal (2.0) texture over Joylent - at least if it had some time in the fridge, and adding fruit in the blender made it even better. But Joylent can be consumed almost immediately without much impact on texture or taste, and combined with the integrated oil, it was the perfect 'on the go' emergency solution for me, so I'm curious how the new Queal will compare to that."

soylent,3clqv4,Omnu,5,Thu Jul 9 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Probably won't help but for me it's experience. Growing up I brought basically the same thing for lunch from junior high through college. I've eaten rice chex for breakfast almost everyday for at least the last 5 years and I only switched to that because I discovered that I've got an allergy/intolerance to the almonds in Honey Nut Cherrios. I've got the same reaction to cherries which I've known about since 1989. So it might be stone fruit. Basically if you can become a picky eater, you should be fine. :)"
soylent,3clqv4,Micera,4,Wed Jul 8 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't taste like anything. There's not really any flavor to get sick of. Honestly I feel like it prevents me from getting sick of other stuff. Usually I get tired of eating similar foods so often, but now I can break that up with Soylent."

soylent,3clqv4,heidismiles,8,Thu Jul 9 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think most people eat for ""entertainment"" a lot of the time.  The phrase ""recreational food"" also gets used a lot.  Essentially, most people don't pick the optimal food at any given meal, but instead they will often pick the one that will bring them the most pleasure.  This is even more true with things like 'snacks', which are only rarely eaten due to hunger and more often due to boredom or simply to improve mood.  What else would you call this but ""entertainment""?"

soylent,3cm2u0,sub_surfer,3,Thu Jul 9 12:58:29 2015 UTC,Ha! I started on 1.4 the gas was to the point of actually making me doubel over some days. It took a month of 1.4 daily and a few weeks of 1.5 for the gas to reduce noticeably. I still get quite gassy it's just not painful and it's as foul as ever still.
soylent,3cm2u0,ryanmercer,3,Thu Jul 9 15:20:22 2015 UTC,the gas always went away after a while - and eating a bunch of beano did a lot to control it. it just took time for your digestive system to adjust.
soylent,3cm2u0,poonblaster69,2,Thu Jul 9 13:05:14 2015 UTC,Mine never went away. It got so bad it was causing hemoroid flareups.

soylent,3cm1bd,ScotchandTweed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"I was eating mostly Soylent. About 70% of my diet. My family came into town and started buying me food at restaurants for about 4 days, so I stopped drinking Soylent. This brought on a constipation that I hadn't experienced since I first started Soylent. I have been feeling horrible for days. I think I'll start using less Soylent so I can adjust to other foods without so much of a dramatic response from my body. I'm getting closer to giving up Soylent all together... but we'll see."
soylent,3cm1bd,MitusEye,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"By the time a meal hits your guts it's pretty much liquid. Soylent is like eating a meal with a large glass of water.  So, it's not going to be the fact that food is solid that might cause a problem.  It could very well be what kind of solid food it is.  So, if you've been on Soylent 100% for a few weeks, your stomach might complain if it's suddenly fed a Big Mac and fries."

If you are interested in less kcal per meal, I'd really recommend the 1800kcal version. It provides less calories per meal, but still gives a feeling of satiation. This should work a lot better than eating 3/4ths of a bag of 2100kcal Queal, which might result in, what you already mentioned, a lesser feeling of satiation."
soylent,3ckyjb,QuealEU,2,Thu Jul 9 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the review. I'm currently testing Jake light and Purelent.  I actually dislike the taste of Jake unless I fill the shaker to the brim with water; the artificial vanilla is way too strong for me when I just add the recommended 350ml.  Pellet is sweeter and more neutral at the same time. Unfortunately, it has a very thick and slimy texture.  I will finish both deliveries and then try Queal or Joylent. I really really like that Jake has individual meal packages, but the taste is too much for me."
soylent,3ckyjb,alphager,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review, I've been wondering about that comparison as I've got a Queal order on the way (any day now,) but I would've chosen Jake if it was just cheaper. Mainly because I want one with fewer than 2000 calories but the full compliment of nutrients. Here's hoping The other brands decide to bring out ""light"" versions - my waistline and wallet would appreciate it!"
soylent,3ckyjb,John-Crichton,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Jake's been growing on me.  At first I was disappointed because it wasn't as sweet/flavoured as Joylent, Queal etc.  But then I gradually became sickened by the sweeter brands, and the neutrality of Jake became a positive.  One tip, If you have a decent blender, try blending Jake with ice cubes and a little water. Tastes like an ice cream shake."

soylent,3cllyl,_ilovetofu_,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:34 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm aware of flavor threads im only worried that 1.5 version posts are still rolling out. I didn't know if it would change what works or not.   I'll keep that in mind for lifting as well.
soylent,3cllyl,12yroldboy,2,Wed Jul 8 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"There are lots of different methods of flavoring, but I don't really use them. Kind of takes away from the simplicity of it for me. I've tried mixing in peanut butter, but prefer to just eat a spoonful after Soylent if I really feel like it.  I deliver newspapers 5 days a week (running to/from my car for 90+ min in the middle of the night) and haven't had any issues w/ hunger or calorie deprivation, but that might be different for actual weight lifting types of exercises. When I first started, I would consume exactly one pouch per day, whether I felt like I needed it or not. Lately, I just consume it when I feel hungry, usually 4 times a day. It'll stay fresh in the refrigerator longer than the 48 hrs they advise, but I try to consume it within 3 days.  As with any alcohol consumption, you are consuming pretty empty calories, so it'll upset the calories per day aspect of Soylent, but I haven't really noticed any other effects to my tolerance or experience of alcohol.  And no, they only send a pitcher/scoop on your first shipment. After that, you just receive the white boxes w/ the pouches and instructions."
soylent,3cllyl,ryanmercer,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I appreciate it! Yeah I'm not a big drinker but I do from time to time. Would rather not have to avoid it.
soylent,3cllyl,be_bo_i_am_robot,2,Fri Jul 10 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"1)What do you add to soylent for flavor?    Nothing. I want soylent, not a berry fruit peanut-butter-2-electric-bugallo smoothie. Drink it and ranger the fuck on.   are there any reservations about working out 3 to 4 days a week on soylent?    No. Unless you are on an AAS cycle and are hoping to get mad swole brah because there won't be enough protein in the soylent for that AAS to use and you'll be wasting that AAS cycle.    has anyone experienced problems drinking alcohol on a 100% soylent diet?    No, but I'm not want to comment. I can drink a fifth in an hour and aside from being quite drunk have ZERO digestive issues the next day. I've consumed quite a bit of bourbon on my 2-ish months of Soylent and had no issues. Maybe a hint more gas but Soylent makes me gassy anyway.   do they just keep sending you mixing equipment every month?   No, but there will be the booklet in every box. If you do want more pitchers though Takeya Airtight Pitcher, 2-Quart, Blue and a good thermos for keeping it cold say to/from/at work Hydro Flask Insulated Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Water Bottle, 32-Ounce"

Weight loss or gain? Sport performance? Sufficient calories might be an issue, depending on your goal or sport.  Soylent was designed for the average human. If your workouts are average, you should be fine. Add another scoop and be on your way.  If your workouts are intense, you might have to add in stuff in addition to the 2000 calories of Soylent to keep your calories up for recovery. More Soylent is good to a point, but I wonder about some of the vitamins getting too high (A for example). If you still want to stay in the liquid foods arena, but need 3000 calories or more, I'd look at adding blended fruit, peanut butter, coconut oil, protein powder, whole milk, and so on. Calculate your daily caloric expenditure, subtract 2000, and work from there."
soylent,3ckqk9,TommyAdagio,3,Wed Jul 8 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"1 scoop is .47 cups.  Water is 226 g per cup, so 1 scoop of water is 106 grams.  1 scoop of Soylent is 57.5 grams.   So the mass ratio should be about 2:1."
soylent,3ckqk9,dreiter,3,Wed Jul 8 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"The suggested ratio for the pitcher is 1.6l water to one packet of Soylent. This is a 80:23 ratio, which is the same as what you calculated. Confusingly, this is different than the ratio suggested when using the scoop. I don't know which is their actual recommendation, and which is the simplification."
soylent,3ckqk9,sleepycorn,2,Thu Jul 9 09:03:47 2015 UTC,"According to this, and assuming the ratio is the same for 1.5, it's 115g of powder and 405g of water. (Water has a density of 1 g/mL.)"

I find that a 400ml blender bottle, filled with water (so more than 400ml) is perfect for a single meal. Probably something like 500ml of volume, including 115g of soylent."
soylent,3ckqk9,PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK,3,Wed Jul 8 19:00:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. I understand that there's no correct volume -- I'm just trying to translate Soylent's instructions to something I can easily make on my own for a first batch.

soylent,3ckqk9,Owenleejoeking,2,Wed Jul 8 20:24:35 2015 UTC,It's 2:1. Two scoops of water for every scoop of Soylent.   You can always add more water later if need be too.
soylent,3ckqk9,PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK,4,Wed Jul 8 20:27:30 2015 UTC,A scoop is not a great way to measure out powder. Much better off doing it by weight.
soylent,3ckqk9,Porsche924,2,Wed Jul 8 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Right. But if I want to make less than or more than a single scoop, it's more flexible if I do it by weight."

soylent,3ck9bv,Itsaboutothappen,5,Wed Jul 8 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know why adding too much water to Soylent would give you the runs. The brochure suggests drinking a lot of extra water during the day while on Soylent, and if it all ends up inside your body together it's all going to be processed by your intestines together... isn't it? I kind of figured hamburgers + beer have about the same milkshakey consistency once your stomach breaks them down and sends them on to your guts.  Unless you figure it's some kind of stomach irritation, not an intestine thing?"
soylent,3ck9bv,sarahnorthway,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:16:04 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know.. Maybe the fiber just gets absorbed faster if it's watery?
soylent,3ck9bv,stregafire,2,Wed Jul 8 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've said it before but it's worth repeating. Xantham gum is the answer to your problems.  Pour a good amount of the Soylent powder in a container for mixing. Add about half a teaspoon (or more, but not too much) of xantham gum to the Soylent powder & mix well. Prepare Soylent as usual. It will be thick like a milkshake. This method works best. Adding the xantham gum post Soylent preparation just results in white slimy globs on the surface with no effect on thickness."

So far I burp a lot, my farts smell faintly like Soylent, and my crap's a bit runny and greenish. I doubt it's the fiber since if anything I'm getting less now.  I'm going to stick to one meal for a few weeks and hopefully my body will adjust. Soylent is so convenient, and I'm happy to be getting a well rounded meal to start my day. I might try cutting down on the water or trying xantham gum, but I prefer the more liquidy texture.

You have the runs from alcohol alcohol alcoohol pseudo-dairy.

soylent,3che3h,ryanmercer,2,Wed Jul 8 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"If you want to go for a minimum, and your minimum is less than 1 packet per day, you need to supplement protein. There are three reasons:   Soylent doesn't have that much protein. People eating calorie deficits need extra protein to spare muscle during weight loss. Protein is important for feeling full. One recent analysis found that whatever the food composition, people tend to keep eating until they've had enough protein."

Thought experiment: Is a diet with no fiber, or a diet with no protein, less satisfying?  http://www.sciencealert.com/overeating-driven-by-lack-of-protein  (Apologies for my tone, I don't enjoy being corrected without a convincing argument.)"
soylent,3che3h,sleepycorn,2,Wed Jul 8 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"overeating-driven-by-lack-of-protein   First let's tackle that link... it doesn't say  'overeating driven by having plenty of protein'. Soylent has plenty of protein for those that aren't athletes or genetic-freaks. Soylent has 80g, the government recommends 50g on the DV. It's fairly widely accepted that 0.36g/lb bodyweight is adequate for sedentary persons as there is little to no evidence that anything over .68g/lb has any added benefit for athletes that ARE NOT using steroids. That means soylent has adequate amounts for persons up to at least 222lbs that are sedentary and are not looking to increase muscle mass and really even for mildly athletic people (people at the gym 2-3 days a week or doing CF 2-3 days a week) will be fine on a pouch a day of Soylent up to 175ish pounds based on currently accepted science and ancedotal evidence. (Go try and get more than that 365 days a year as a hunter gatherer for tens or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, or even in most of the countries/civilizations in the world currently...)  Second, there have been countless studies showing fiber can help control 'hunger'."
soylent,3che3h,audevivere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for the careful reply. I still fear your original ""FTFY"" comment was made without paying attention to the context.   Soylent has 80g, the government recommends 50g on the DV... 0.36g/lb bodyweight is adequate... soylent has adequate amounts for persons up to at least 222lbs   I trust your numbers/knowledge, but I don't see how it's applicable:   You posted about athleticism, but the context is calorie restriction. Calorie restriction increases the need for protein beyond the levels you cite. This study was done on calorie-restricting athletes, but with some care we can extrapolate the results to calorie-restricting non-athletes. To wit, if an overweight athlete has 140 lbs of lean mass (200 lbs with 30% body fat), he would need to eat 140-210 grams of protein per day. Since the OP is not an athlete, the requirement will be reduced, but as you said, athletes don't need tons and tons of protein compared to normal people. (Other things I've read over the years agree, regarding increased need for protein.) The scenario I cautioned the OP about is what will happen if he consumes less than 1 bag of Soylent per day. Thus, we are not talking about 80 grams of protein.    there have been countless studies showing fiber can help control 'hunger'.    Yes, but how does this negate my point about inadequate protein driving eating behavior? While fiber may help alleviate hunger, it is not necessary for that purpose, as anybody that has just eaten a large omelette can attest. Anecdotally, I believe the hunger alleviation effect of fiber is short-lived. (I.e., what happens when you have a meal of almost non-caloric vegetables?) This effect is not in the same league as the satiating effect of protein, which has caused me to forget to eat a meal after having a protein shake."
soylent,3che3h,sleepycorn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:41:56 2015 UTC,"If you consume just enough soylent to obtain 50g protein as recommended, you would only be consuming 1250 calories. I think the bigger issue for an athelete would be consuming less than BMR. I don't see the point in consuming excess protein if you are maintaining a negative energy balance. Your body will just metabolize the consumed protein for calories just as it will metabolize fats and carbohydrates. Additionally, to maximize workouts (i.e. the stress that triggers muscle hypertrophy) it would be better to supplement carbs which can be metabolized easily during the workout and decrease the need to produce lactic acid which contrubutes to delayed onset muscle soreness and inflammation within the muscle. Less lactic acid= more reps, less time needed for recovery between workouts, less myocyte cell death. After workouts when myocytes are being repaired would be better for high protein. If you don't have the fuel for an intense workout, you're not stressing the myocytes, thus there's no trigger to even begin the muscle building process.     As far as protein ""sparing muscle during weight loss"" do you have any proof of this in someone who is exercising? The body greatly perfers to break down fat over protein. Muscle isn't usually broken down if there is any other availlible source. That's cachexia not weight loss. Other causes that may convince somone they are ""losing"" muscle mass with calorie restriction may be 1) losing fat that was around the muscle 2) depletion/decrease of carbohydrate stores within myocytes 3) not increasing resistance training to compensate for decrease body weight (ie 10 squats when your 150lbs requires less work than when you were 200 lbs, increase reps or add weight; even if you're not actively exercising it requires more effort/muscle to keep a 200 lb frame upright than a 150 lb frame)  I wouldn't draw conclusions from a retrospective analysis of literature. IMO thats shit science, about on par with an N=1."

If your dietary protein is mostly turned into energy, where is the protein that your body needs for normal tissue growth and repair? It's going to come from somewhere.   As far as protein ""sparing muscle during weight loss"" do you have any proof of this in someone who is exercising?   That was the point of the study I linked. I did you mean to say someone who isn't exercising?   Muscle isn't usually broken down if there is any other availlible source.   You mean like a calorie deficit? (Which is the context of this conversation, after all.)   not increasing resistance training to compensate for decrease body weight   This would cause you to think you have become stronger, not that you have lost muscle.   I wouldn't draw conclusions from a retrospective analysis of literature   My opinion on this science was not formed during this exchange. To me, the study is for demonstration purposes.

soylent,3cdxqb,IHateMyHandle,10,Tue Jul 7 09:23:35 2015 UTC,"Simple-- Soylent was the first.  Soylent was available several months before any of the competitors.    As for who is the most healthy- I don't think you can really measure that.  There's this idea that a 100% food will have 'exactly as much of everything as the body needs"", except there is no such thing.  Different people will have different nutritional needs, and even among normal food there's a huge amount of variation in diets.    If I'm a computer nerd, 1800 calories a day might be enough for me.  But if you are a body builder or construction worker, 1800 calories might not last you through lunchtime.  Nutrition isn't a one size fits all.  Different nutritional mixes may serve different goals.  Take for example one of the Keto mixes like KetoSoy- they have a different mix of nutrients that promotes ketosis (a situation where the body switches fuels to primarily burn fat byproducts rather than sugars).  It will sustain human life just like Soylent.  Is it 'better'?  No, it's just different."

From what I've seen, Soylent's nutritional values for its micronutrients appear to be formulated to almost exactly fit 100% of daily recommended values, while those that follow have micronutrient contents that look more like that of DIY formulas where multivitamins are mixed to achieve the best approximation. Whether it's healthier is arguable, but it does lend to an air of professionalism and control.  Also, Soylent has had the boon of ~$25 mil in kickstarter and venture capital, along with $10 mil in revenue during 2014, with money going towards establishing manufacturing facilities and (iirc) hiring nutritional and food scientists to refine their formula.  I would say that Joylent is their biggest competitor, simply due to their location within the EU and their international shipping."

You can improve taste and texture a million times over doing a home-made variant, or by finding another smaller vendor, but to do so often fails two of the major Soylent selling points: cost and efficiency. I can whip up a full jug in 60 seconds out of a bag, but to go shop, mix, and prepare anything else is going to put me back to regular cooking times. I can buy Soylent under 300 a month on a subscription, and I know the mix is always regulated, standard, and will be improved every few months without any experimentation. Finally, Soylent has been analyzed and tested so thoroughly that I know if I consume a bag, that's 2000 calories. I'm on roughly a 1500/2500 cal cycle depending on activity. It's dead simple to pour out three servings of 500, or to add a couple scoops of protein powder which brings it extremely close. No variation. No guesswork. Total, absolute control. It's like they always say, that if you want flavor, to be a foodie, that their product probably isn't marketed for you. If food is fuel, and you want it done and over with without sacrificing your health... Rosa Labs Soylent is the clear choice.  None of this is to say that anybody else's product is inferior. It is only to say that Rosa Labs has no direct competitor."

soylent,3cdyze,platypod,2,Fri Jul 10 01:00:51 2015 UTC,"I've used 100% Food(earlier this year) and Joylent(currently my entire diet).  I gave up on 100% Food as my body simply wouldn't adjust to it, my stomach was constantly upset. Even after several weeks, it was unpleasant. By contrast my girlfriend had no issues with 100% Food (breakfast only) and continues to use it in the morning, until it's gone.  By contrast, I've had no stomach issues (and neither has she!) with Joylent. It's packaged better, the powder mixes far better, the product doesn't turn into a ball of gel while I'm trying to drink it, the flavours are better, though we both agree that the chocolate Joylent flavour is too mild.  Vanilla tastes like cake, strawberry tastes like a strawberry muffin, banana tastes like unsweetened banana bread. All fantastic!  I plan to try Soylent now that it is available in Canada, but I pay far less (even with shipping from the Netherlands) for Joylent. That said comparing powdered foods is rather difficult, as they all have completely different ingredient bases. So flavour and texture aside, one may simply work better for you than another."
soylent,3cdyze,lasershurt,2,Tue Jul 7 10:10:45 2015 UTC,"I've had both 100% Food and Soylent proper. I'll see if I can point out the key differences:  Texture: Soylent is smooth, very fine powder. 100% food has some bits and bobs that might be unpleasant at first - but over time I grew to like them and found it gave a more fulfilling, ""chewier"" experience.  Taste: 100% Food's chocolate was a favorite of mine. I can have chocolate as many meals as I want and never get tired of it. Their Raw or Organic or whatnot flavors were not for me, though.  Packaging: Both are well packaged. 100% Food has the little bottles, which are very convenient, but lots of recycling trash. Soylent comes in pouches and you decide for yourself if you want to make it 1 meal at a time, or 1 day.  Customer Service: Both pretty good. Soylent might have the edge here now, post funding blast, but 100% Food never had more than a few odd delays here and there, and that was long ago.  I'm pretty happy with Soylent, but I didn't really switch because I was UNhappy with 100% food.   They have a Sampler if you want to try some stuff before committing."

I love the taste of the product and have no issues with texture. If you just use a shaker bottle you will have some particulate but like another poster said ""I kind of like it"". It's easy to measure, mix, and eat.  I will say that delivery issues I have both read about here and experienced cause me to reorder with plenty of time for fulfillment. They will generate a shipping label almost immediately but the product will not ship immediately. I order a month supply in bags and when I get halfway through the third bag I reorder giving me a good 10 day cushion for spaceman to get me my powder. It's a new industry and a young company so I cut them some slack. I am hopeful that this improves over time."

Get double protein if you are a male because it isn't enough despite what the RDI says. I prefer 100%food's double protein to all the other alternatives I've tried which include Soylent and Joylent. The biggest thing for me was bloating and farts. Perhaps being Asian and lactose intolerant has something to do with it. I would get deadly farts and painful bloating while on Soylent and joylent, but never got them on 100% food. I really enjoy their bottle approach as I'm a college student. I'm okay with the texture of 100% foods, but many say the urge to chew the seeds becomes annoying. Needless to say I will be on 100% food's for the next 6 months because I'm certain that all other soylent products use whey protein concentrate to some degree which has been a huge no-no for me."

I had salt craving for a while that i feel have been reduced dramaticly as ive progressed on a joylent diet.   To be honest, this is definitely not a meal replacement   In what way is it not a meal replacement? it is designed and marketed as such. It is designed to give you nutrients and satiate your hunger which is the basic purpose of food.   It is more like how human is designed, we are designed to eat food   In what way?   by the time you eat food again, your body will not be able to digest normal food   A very broad statement, any source that supports this? i can understand there being some side-effects if you pursue a 100% longtime soylent based diet and would be interested in hearing about such effects.  You come to these conclusions after eating only one meal? I would say give it a bit more time. I have eaten joylent for about 2 weeks, replacing 2 meals a day and i have not encountered any problems whatsoever. I have no problem eating normal food and my stomache functions as should with no flatulence issues. It also satiates my hunger to an acceptable level."

I think that you cannot just drink Joylent and call it a meal, yes it fills you up and it satisfies your hunger but you would really want something to eat along e.g. a cookie.   To be honest, this is definitely not a meal replacement   I know that products like this are marketed as a meal replacement, however I think that you cannot replace all the meals with just Joylent, mainly because by just drinking Joylent and call it a meal just does not sound like a normal meal, yes it gives you the nutrients you need but living off Joylent would not be ideal. You would still want to eat with your families, or have dinner with your bf/gf. (You would still want to eat bacon, right? )   There are a lot of reasons to eat, and for me, I am trying meal replacement just because ""I need more time"" and ""I think this is fun to try"", not like ""I'm done with food, everytime I look at the menu I want to kill myself.""   It is more like how human is designed, we are designed to eat food by the time you eat food again, your body will not be able to digest normal food   This is a discussion between me and several of my friends. They thought that humans are designed to eat, our teeth shows that. Also, we think that we are meant to digest solid food. (Although you chewed till it's swallow-able and easier to digest.) If we start to replace solid food with liquefied food you would start to decrease the functionality of your digestive system, liquefied food does not need a lot of digestion (in your stomach), and by the time you eat your medium-well steak you will start to feel unwell. It's like how your body get used to something.  By the way, I will always keep updating this log till I think sufficient information is already written down. I had my second Joylent meal today.   This is my personal experience, and it is really just a reference. Everyone has different body and we may act different on things. We all have our own different thoughts about this new thing, you may not agree on what I think but well that's why we're here, to share thoughts and experiences.   I would agree on replacing 1-2 meals with joylent but not the whole day only with joylent..."

Weighing is so much simpler  Totally agree on oatmeal, I have my morning ones warm when it's cold outside. Found my choc flavour tasted like strawberry/banana though? Not unpleasant really. Mixed a little dissolved Intel's in to improve. Also Peanut butter or PB2 for calorie watchers.  I found leaving it overnight made it smooth but tasted terrible (this was vanilla flavour) not sure if I had it open too long before I fridged it, or the vanilla flavour goes weird overnight.

soylent,3ccqmi,thesorehead,2,Wed Jul 8 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"PB2 mixes pretty well, I don't put much in, when I did try 2 tablespoons I prefixed it with some water just in case. If you mixed it with powdered joyless t before any moisture it would be even better (will try tomorrow). PB2 also adds a thickness that makes me feel full for longer, as long as I don't over water it like I did today. If you do get a lump of PB2 it's not actually unpleasant to chew either. Not too dry, just like a peanut blast.  I put a tablespoon of coffee flavours in occasionally, gingerbread especially, that's with the coffee flavour one though which I can't honestly recommend unless you have syrups to add. Wish joyless did an unflavoured version.   Also added vanilla essence, almond essence etc. They work pretty well.  I want to try savoury versions, but without an flavoured version not possible.   Vanilla, choc and banana flavours can have instant coffee added to decent effect, just pre dissolve it.  I'd like to add a little grated dark choc to a strawberry shake, used to do that in normal fruit shakes adds a nice depth.   I'd you have jams or preserves they could be nice, apricot with strawberry I think. Only if they are jelly, smooth versions though.  I added some mashed frozen strawberries. Don't recommend. Terrible consistency. Blended it to make it edible but it's hassle you just don't need.   Cinnamon is pretty mild, even in vanilla flavoured joylent but makes a nice change.

Adding caffeine to the mix will make this even more pronounced, as it tends to concentrate urine (you can end up with dark urine, even if over-hydrated).

I just wish there was a way to order older versions so we can stick with what we know works. I essentially have to throw out half of my 1.5 order (no one else I know sounds at all interested). It's hard for me to throw in another $70 towards 1.6 as a result. It sounds like not many people are having the same issue as I am, so I can't really rely on reviews to tell me whether it's been fixed or not.  I did sign up for the beta, and depending on the terms and costs of that, that might be a decent option moving forward. I'll wait and see how that pans out."

soylent,3cckiv,SpaceJRod,4,Tue Jul 7 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Let me respond to your main point, rather than your specific issues with 1.5.  Powdered foods is a young market, and Rosa Labs is trying to figure out the best formula for the marketplace.  When it was released, it was clear that priorities came into view that were not as deeply expressed in the testing groups - nothing strange here, I expect the testing group was not as diverse.  So, Rosa Labs is adjusting the formula in response to the markets needs.  Like most new product areas, I suspect they will find ""The Formula"" within the next couple years, which will stick around for a much longer period.  Additionally, Rosa Labs has opted for SKU Rationalization as part of their process.  This allows them to focus on a (currently) single product on the market for both quality and availability.  This also simplifies the business process immensely (just Google 'SKU Rationalization' and you will see what I mean).  Unfortunately, this means certain consumers cannot backpedal to the 'golden days' of their favourite product.  Really, this all fits very similar behavior to the technology sector. New products are released on cycles, and the older versions are no longer manufactured.  The main difference here is that new versions are always progress points moving forward, not just new revisions of the same function (think about smartphones).  With all that said, I empathize with your frustration on this - you will never be able to get 1.4 back.  However, it is the nature of the current ecosystem, and this may be something that you will not be happy with until everything settles after a while.  I don't blame you for walking away, but urge you to consider coming back once you feel everything is stable enough for you.  Personally, I do not like 1.5 as much as 1.4 (which I fortunately still have a 6-weeks supply of), but I am more than willing to go through changes of the product and adapt.  I'm even looking forward to the Beta program (fingers-crossed).  But, not everyone will look at this like me, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Ninja Edit: I just re-read this and I did not mean to sound like I was talking down to you on the subject, just providing an overview of why I think things are the way they are."
soylent,3cckiv,be_bo_i_am_robot,0,Mon Jul 6 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Like I said to others, I'm not complaining about the changing nature of the product. I understand that iteration is the only way to continue to progress. I'd just like to have the option to continue to buy a recipe I've had success with. I know that loses some of the economy of scale, so I'm ok with paying a little more for an older version. That coupled with the beta program sounds like the ideal set up to me."
soylent,3cckiv,ryanmercer,3,Tue Jul 7 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"There are two common things that cause gas in Soylent. One is the fiber. If that's the cause, most people's bodies adjust to the fiber within a week, maybe two weeks.  That being said, the fiber content in 1.5 is actually lower than 1.4, so the fiber probably isn't the issue for you.  The other is some of the complex carbs.  If that's the cause, taking a beano pill with each serving of Soylent should prevent the gas from happening.  Just as a data point, I had no gas on 1.4, and I totally have gas on 1.5.  Taking beano prevents the gas on 1.5 for me.  I feel pretty confident that within a year or two Soylent will have these issues sorted out."
soylent,3cckiv,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:06:11 2015 UTC,I'll look into beano. Hopefully it will let me get through the rest of 1.5 at the very least.

If you pack that cup of flour you can get more weight into that cup.  Soylent 1.4 is not soylent 1.5. Different ingredients will have different volumes, 1.4 and 1.5 have considerable differences in ingredients. Plus the same issue with flour (or any other powdered ingredient in cooking) unless you are going by weight any measurement like tablespoon/cup is open to variation because powders can compact."
soylent,3cayrc,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jul 6 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"This is true, but does make the inclusion of the scoop an eyebrow-raiser.  Soylent!

soylent,3cayrc,lasershurt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:42:04 2015 UTC,If you don't like the scoop don't use it. The easy way to be accurate is to do a whole bag at once but the scoop gets you in the ballpark. Many recipes are by volume not weight because it's easy - we're not making pharmaceuticals here. Or use a scale as others suggested.

When I am down to just a single serving in the pitcher, I pour the remaining into a 32oz bottle. This let's me refill the pitcher, which  I consume after the blender bottle. I just repeat this method every day, and I do not have to mess around with the powder."

soylent,3cayrc,bobpaul,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"I can't scoop without making a mess, but put my blender bottle on the scale and can pour right from the bag without spilling any of it.

I put two scoops of water in the blender bottle, put it on the scale, press the clear/zero button, then use a spoon to scoop the powder into the bottle until the scale reads 115g, put in one more scoopful of water, put on lid, then shake. Honestly it's less of a hassle then trying to figure out if the powder in the scoop is packed too much."
soylent,3cayrc,breadburger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"True, I hadn't thought about doing that in the bottle until another user mentioned it. I was imagining needing a 3rd vessel for the powder, or placing it directly on the scale. But the bottle method seems much easier than even using the scoop, like you mentioned."
soylent,3cayrc,breadburger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:40:16 2015 UTC,Just got to remember to zero out the scale before you start spooning in the powder :) Usually putting the bottle on the scale before you turn it on is all you need to do.
soylent,3cayrc,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:30:37 2015 UTC,When you're messing around with the amounts I find it a lot easier to simply make the entire package in the jug they give you. 2000 calories and you can drink it whenever.

I drank about half the water on the way to where I was headed, I saved the rest untill I was about 3/4 back to my car and the ice cubes were almost the exact same size as when I left the house (they'd just polished smooth from the several mile hike).

Nearly 100% of my diet (whenever I go out with friends for dinner or something I'll obviously not have Soylent). I'd say > 90% of my meals in a given month are Soylent. Body weight hasn't really changed at all since I started. I guess that can be taken as a good thing. I'm getting the amount of calories my body needs and no more.  Hasn't. Read answer to 2. But specifically, I don't let Soylent get in the way of eating out with friends, since that doesn't happen much since my friends have their own families, etc. I'd say my body (Health?) is better and my social life is unchanged compared to before Soylent."

I have 3/4ths of a day's worth every weekday and eat a normal dinner.  I have actually gained weight but I am MUCH healthier than before because I was not even getting 30 percent of what I needed nutritionally, so the difference has been enormous.  After a few questions when I first started at work on what was in the container, no one has approached me in any way about it and it was never directly negative when they did.  In reality, I traded a lot of junk food and processed lunch-meats for 3/4ths of a day of Soylent, and that has changed my life health-wise.    I am healthier from head to toe, but without more exercise, eating more calories than normal obviously makes you gain weight.  Overall I could not imagine going back.  One thing that I have noticed was that after a few months of just eating Soylent and not DIY I found myself seeing it as ""normal"" and not doing things like checking the Soylent sub, and I would imagine that that happens to many long-time users.  Once it just becomes normal you don't talk about it as much."

I eat regular food only socially (still I keep it healthy), so I guess people would not even notice anything if I hadn't told them. Before Joylent I tried to eat healthy as much as possible, but since it was not very convenient/possible at all times my diet was still far from perfect. Joylent makes it extremely easy and effortless to get all the nutrition I need.   Obviously, I'm extremely satisfied with my move to Joylent.

What percent of your diet does Soylent make up?   Around 66% for the first 4 months, 75% for the 2 months after that and near 100% for the last 3 months.   How has your body changed? Weight and other things.   Minor weight loss, but nothing significant.  I was between 105kg and 110kg before starting with soylent, and am now hovering between 95kg and 100kg.  My sense of taste has become more sensitive I think - I am definitely more able to detect 'faint tastes' than before.  When I started with Joylent, I thought it near flavourless but now it's quite a strong flavour to me.  My energy levels are now more consistent.  I don't necessarily have more energy, just that I no longer have significant peaks and troughs throughout the day.   How has the social aspect of Soylent affected you?   Not at all.  I still sit at the table with my wife and kids in the evening as they eat their food and I drink my soylent.  On special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, and the occasional business dinner at work I'll eat traditional food (hence the ""near"" 100% rather than truly 100%).  Eating was never a particularly social event for me.  Perhaps the biggest social change is that I no longer eat lunch in the company cafeteria with my coworkers, but we have a good social relationship within the office anyway so it doesn't make a huge difference.   How does your body and social life now (in regards to food) compare to your diet before Soylent?   I think this is answered by the above answers?"
soylent,3c89cu,dalebewan,3,Mon Jul 6 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"13 weeks, at 80% of my diet. I must emphasize that the remaining 20% is relatively healthy fare and never includes anything with added sugars. Mainly raw plants and various meats.  Previously, I was eating almost every meal at restaurants. Basically, no limits, apart from satiety. Lots of low fiber and high sugar foods, the typical industrial food mix.  Dramatic improvement in health. Specifically: reversal of acid reflux and (related) chronic cough, elimination of all significant visceral fat. No more daytime drowsiness. My waist circumference went from 86.5 to 78 cm. Weight unknown, but I was 180 before, and my body shape looks like it did in 1999 when I was 135 lbs. and quite lean. I am now comfortable sitting in a room at 76 F, whereas I used to be sweating and agitated at anything warmer than 71. This is a nice bonus, because it saves a lot on air conditioning in Texas. My monthly food bill has gone down by 74%  Very little social effect of eating Soylent itself, as I almost always eat alone anyway. The one day's worth of ""regular"" food a week that I eat, I sometimes use for a social event, so there hasn't been interference there. The main social impact has been that women seem to find me more interesting now. It's like magic."
soylent,3c89cu,details_matter,2,Mon Jul 6 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"How long have you been on Soylent?   About four months, I've forgotten the exact date I started. I've tried Joylent, Queal, Jake, Nutrilent and Nano. My main supply consists of Jake an Nutrilent at the moment, and when a supply goes low, I decide which brands I'll restock next.   What percent of your diet does Soylent make up?   It varies. The past week, it was 100%. When I had two weeks off of work, it was about 33%. I reckon on average I'll hit around 80%.   How has your body changed? Weight and other things.   No weight changes. My farts can kill small animals, though. I don't pass gas more than before, it's just that when I do, it's noticable. Being able to suppress it helps ;-).   How has the social aspect of Soylent affected you?   Not at all. Friends and co-workers made some jokes at first, but that's it. Sometimes, people ask questions on how ""the diet"" is going. I'm single with no intention of changing that and eat alone almost exclusively (it's not common for people to go out and eat over here, people cook their own meals at home). At work I always go for walks with co-workers during breaks and have my food at my desk throughout the day.   How does your body and social life now (in regards to food) compare to your diet before Soylent?   Gas aside, hardly any changes. I crave snacks / fast food often (especially in the evening), but I have had that issue before soylent as well. Maybe the cravings are more noticable now, but I'm quite used to having to resist those, as I have had to do so for years."
soylent,3c89cu,boerbiet,2,Mon Jul 6 06:08:36 2015 UTC,"I've been on Soylent for about a month or two.  I generally mix Soylent with chocolate protein powder which tastes great. It varies.  I'll eat 'real' food if there's an occasion to do so, such as if I go out for dinner.  Or sometimes I just feel like eating something else.  Depending on the day, Soylent is 30-90% of my food intake. Lower weight, lower body fat %.  When I'm getting enough sleep I also feel more alert and energized on Soylent vs normal food. I don't try to replace my diet 100%, so Soylent does not have a social aspect for me.  If I'm going out with friends or coworkers I will eat whatever the restaurant is serving.   The most useful thing Soylent does is it gives me a quick healthy meal that's much better for my body than the usual candy bars or fast food.  Soylent leaves me feeling quite full, but fully nourished and without the health consequences of eating shitty food. The result is my diet is overall more nutritious.  As stated before, I don't try to go 100% (most Soylent users don't) so there are no social effects.   Hope that helps!"

In that time I did my first half-marathon and then beat my time by 10 minutes, I learned how to do a muscle up and overall health and mentality have improved.   I only consume powdered foods ~70% of the time. I think having meal time with your family is important and I'm not one to bring Biolent to a bar.

soylent,3c89cu,chris-biolent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:45:59 2015 UTC,"I've got a stockpile of one of the earlier versions of Soylent. Off the top of my head I forget which one.    9 months Soylent is a tool I use when I'd rather spend my time on something other than preparing food I've adjusted my Soylent use to fit in with my normal food diet to stay within my usual weight range. I do find it much easier to be able to weigh out specific calories of Soylent.  I expected to be more productive in the workplace with Soylent added to the mix. Realistically, lunch time is when much socializing takes place. In larger companies I find this social time necessary to move ahead. When I'm asked to grab lunch stating 'nah, brought food with me' can be a bit uncomfortable knowing much of the real conversation happens on the walk to and from acquiring food.    One thing of note is that an all-Soylent diet doesn't work well for me. I start feeling my pulse is racing a bit faster than usual or occasionally just feel off. I haven't read any other accounts similar to what I experience using Soylent for 100% of meals. Simply fall back on the 'everything in moderation' rule, mix up my foods, and feel much more normal using Soylent."

soylent,3c89cu,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"I've been on my DIY for a little over a year now. (holy shit this long already?)  I usually drink it over the day according to how hungry I am, and eat a normal meal in the evening.  It's been a definite improvement in almost every regard. The biggest factor is cost, since DIY allows me to go just under 1€ per meal, which is amazing. Since I'm saving up to buy a new car this has been an important factor to me. I've also been feeling slightly more energetic, though that may very well simply be a placebo effect. Since I never made a 100% switch the cause of any differences is hard to pin down.  A further improvement has been time - I work in a lab, and being able to distribute my ""lunch"" over several five-minute-breaks is amazing, since a single one-hour lunch break is much more complicated to incorporate into the time schedule of my experiments. Because of this I'm almost always able to take an earlier train home.  In sports I've noticed no difference. I do kickboxing, though not very regular. Usually between 1 and 3 times a week. Again I've been feeling slightly more powerful and energetic, though, again, I'd be careful to attribute that to any real effect of my diet.  I must say that the greatest advantage for my personal life is that I finally understand food. Trying DIY forced me to read up on a lit of stuff I was previously too lazy to read up on - it's been a great motivating factor here. Now I know my way around nutrition, which has had the neat side-effect of greatly improving my ""regular"" cooking."

soylent,3c7pmk,Rawrkanos_Michael,7,Sun Jul 5 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"Serious question. Why use Soylent to start cooking meals again? Why not just use regular healthy ingredients to make food if you're gonna put in the time? I'm not bashing, I'm genuinely curious. Soylent for me is about the 'ugh I don't want to cook but do want to be healthy' moments."
soylent,3c7pmk,are-you-really-sure,4,Sun Jul 5 18:32:06 2015 UTC,I think using Soylent to cook meals is more nutritious than using regular ingredients.  A Soylent pancake has all the vitamins and nutrients you need plus a little extra from the add-ons like the eggs and flour.  Cooking with Soylent is for those of us who want a nutritious breakfast that we can eat instead of gulp down in less than a minute.  I guess it's also an activity one can do if they genuinely enjoy cooking. I like to make tons of Soylent pancakes and then put them in the freezer.  This way I can grab them out one at a time throughout the day and be able to munch on a healthy snack whenever I want.
soylent,3c7pmk,Morinaga,3,Sun Jul 5 19:51:28 2015 UTC,Would heating up the soylent destroy some of the vitamins and nutrients in the process though?

I dunno if I'm gonna keep this up after the week-supply is gone, though I am enjoying my delicious nutrient-rich foodcake, and it is about $7 cheaper than my regular diet, if I get the monthly subscription-box.

I used to follow this macro ratio when competing in endurance running for several years and got great results (energy + lean-ness) from it.  Maybe try swapping out some of the Masa for Maltodextrin.  The malto will improve the texture and satiety. It's commonly used in low-fat drinks for this purpose.  I'd also up the amount of oat flour and reduce the rice flour - this will improve digestion and make it less gritty.    It'd be hard to turn that recipe into a baked good though. I've been experimenting with a low-fat baked Soylent type thing for a while  - and I've found that bananas, pea protein and oat flour make an excellent base for most solid recipes."

I was looking at barley flour and it seemed to have a lower GI than some of my original blend...which is attractive to me. Do you think this recipe would work any better for an attempt at baking?

What if there is something important in 'real' food that's not in Soylent?   Scientists have been studying nutrition for a LONG time.  We're pretty good at figuring out what exactly the body needs.  The human body needs a pretty long list of substances to be healthy, but we've been working on that list for quite a long time.  Soylent is just that list of what the body needs, in a powder.    Also, everybody's diet is different.  Lots of Americans eat unhealthy diets- too much of one thing, too little of another.  While it's remotely possible that the makers of Soylent missed something, it's far more likely that I'd get health problems from my old diet of crap food than from not getting whatever Soylent is missing.  Besides, there are people who've been on 100% Soylent for YEARS now.  As a general rule they're all in great health.  If Soylent was really lacking something important, don't you think those other people would be having health problems now?"

I like the idea of soylent, and think it has an important place in the daily lives of people but at the same time feel it will be a while, if ever, before it is on par with a healthy varied diet of good raw food.  People do sustain on relatively poor diets, a tremendous testament to the body's capabilities, but to have the vitality/energy/health that is the best we can achieve it takes a lot of compounds we've yet to have a clue to look for.  When soylent displaces garbage in your diet, you can only win.  But I'm cautious to not displace quality food."

I often enjoy displacing even quality food because it's easy to be deficient in vitamins or minerals, and it is such a waste of time between grocery shopping, prep, eating, and cleanup."
soylent,3c4y8g,qwnp,-2,Sun Jul 5 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"why do you think that? what is so good about raw food that isn't in soylent?   Literally nobody knows.  And that's the point.  In the 30's the last ""essential"" amino acid was found... after WWII nutritional research was curtailed and RDA's established as they felt they knew all they needed.  Everyday see more and more about this food or that compound and how it effects this disease or that condition/mood/sleep/behavior.  Maybe I'm a skeptic but just don't think we ""know it all"" yet.  So I continue to eat quality and use soylent to displace the poorer options I had.   enjoy displacing even quality food because it's easy to be deficient in vitamins or minerals   Guess I could ask: Why do you think that?  Especially when people who eat a varied and predominantly plant based diet are consistent found to be among the healthiest... I like raw but obviously it isn't ""essential,"" just in my opinion/personal experience find it ""more better"" for me.   and it is such a waste of time between grocery shopping, prep, eating, and cleanup.   For you maybe (and obviously many others these days), but some either like very much the process or don't find it so burdensome or think it's worth the effort for taste/nutrition etc...  If I displace 1hr a night of watching TV by prep and cooking, don't feel it's a negative exchange especially if I can do it with loved ones/friends/family.  But as stated, definitely has a place in displacing bad food when time or effort is in short supply."
soylent,3c4y8g,BairaagiVN,6,Sun Jul 5 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"Literally nobody knows.   This is true, but it works both ways. Research could just as easily reveal that some quality foods have anti-nutrients like phytic acid or oxalates that inhibit absorption of some nutrients. Maybe even entirely new ones, or carcinogens.  They may currently and in the future be a valid part of a healthy diet, but it may turn out to be better to extract the healthy bits and take them in the form of something like soylent."
soylent,3c4y8g,ryanmercer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"Agree.  So what side does one err on with this incomplete data set?  We are here, so food is somewhat proven as ""good.""  It's what we evolved eating (though not in the current condition or variety/types/ratios that are common today)  Are you arguing that science knows everything to produce a manufactured food source for optimal health... merely seeing some people sustain for a year or two on soylent is debased by the previous observation that people do survive on quite poor diets. Some deficiencies don't manifest in near term physical effects, some show up as reduction in mental development.  Others may not necessarily be detrimental in deficient/absence but are highly beneficial when present OR as you pointed out, some may be actually detrimental.  Again, at the outset, living and living optimally (however you take that squishy term) are two entirely different concepts.  And Soylent is definitely better than the poorer options.

For me, I get significant hypoglycemic episodes about 3 hours after having 500 kcal serving of soylent. I take it slow, too, and don't gulp it down. It's making it very hard for me stay on 1.5, and the first week on it I completely wrecked what I had going with 1.4 due to the extreme hunger pains I get along with the shakes and sweating and all that fun stuff, resulting in me eating a lot of crap I'd lost all desire for on 1.4, just because it was easily available. For reference, five hours is a pretty normal time for me to go between meals, and I would rarely get physically noticeable dips in blood sugar from my non-soylent diet. On soylent, it's 3 hours every single time I have a meal of it.  So far, haven't found a fix for it.

I don't know if it's ""too much"" sugar, because a lot of it is isomaltulose and trehalose, which have a quick (but relatively small) peak in blood sugar, then take a long time to taper off, compared to sucrose which spikes high and crashes quickly.

To counteract the ""diabetes"" argument: diabetics have high blood sugar. It's the treatment that causes lows, so it's not diabetes (unless you're taking Metformin or some other diabetes medication).  Most importantly, though, is how do you know it's low? I do have diabetes and Soylent caused some lows because I took enough insulin for all carbs in it. My insulin would act faster than the slow acting carbs would, so I would end up going too low. I just had to counteract that by taking less insulin (which is great)."
soylent,3c3wsh,Lhun,3,Sat Jul 4 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"I know because I have the textbook symptoms. I've had it all my life so I can ""feel"" it coming and if I don't eat food soon I will become very shaky, my heart will race along with my chest developing red splotches, I will have serious trouble concentrating, and my pupils become giant. Those are the main symptoms I have. If I forgot to eat dinner I will usually wake up in the middle of the night extremely pale and I will feel like I am dying, things will go black in and out and I will be throwing up stomach acid until I eat/run out of acid, and I will feel extremely weak.  Edit: And no I am not taking any medication other than birth control."
soylent,3c3wsh,Lhun,-2,Sat Jul 4 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, weird. So, since you said you've had it your whole life I assume that means you've been to a doctor about it previously, yes? Maybe Soylent just isn't the right fit, or if you really want to stay with it, you may have to add a little more sugar to help your blood sugar raise.  Those symptoms sound similar to when my blood sugar goes low, except for the red splotches, blacking out, and puking; which sounds like either extremely low blood sugar, or something else is wrong.  Do you treat yourself similarly to a diabetic when you have a low? Either slam a regular pop or chow some candy?"

soylent,3bvcrg,bluecado,3,Sat Jul 4 12:15:43 2015 UTC,"To reduce cooling costs, you don't want to exchange air as you open the door. Therefore, reducing the displacement of the refrigerator is beneficiary.  On the other side, you don't want to increase the heat capacity of the cooled area. The less time the compressor runs during a single turn-on, the more efficient the cooling process will be. The reason is that the backside heat exchanger warms up during the cooling process, but cools down to room temperature when the compressor is not running. The supply temperature of the coolant will be therefore lower, cooling down more after the expansion valve.   The difference might be subtle, but this is the most efficient way, as far as I know. Prove me wrong."

soylent,3bvcrg,sleepycorn,0,Mon Jul 6 19:13:54 2015 UTC,Source?
soylent,3bvcrg,wijzewillem,14,Thu Jul 2 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Is physics 101 a source? Using cold water bottles will balance the temperature in the fridge. Instead of having a lot of cool air that flows out of the fridge as soon as you open the door, you'll have lots of cold water that doesn't flow out. This means the fridge will keep a more stable cool temperature and use a lot less energy to stay cold.  Edit: better wording"
soylent,3bvcrg,sleepycorn,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"Physics 101 tells me heat capacity of air is very low and wouldn't matter that much? We could try to run the numbers but I'm to lazy plus there's a heat wave here and my priority is cold beer!  Edit: couldn't help myself and did a quick calculation. Beware I am under the influence of heat wave and alcohol so I could very wel have missed something (also on mobile, so sorry about crappy formatting)   Heat capacity of air: 1.2 J/liter/K (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity). This is the actual energy needed to change the temperature of one liter by one degree.  With a cool down difference of 20 degrees thats 24 J/liter.  Say you will have 50 liters of bottles in your fridge (a lot/alot): 50 liter air less to be cooled saves you 50 * 24J = 1.2 kJ of energy per door opening. If you open your fridge twice per day thats 36521.2=0.88 MJ of energy saved. This is 0.24 kWh over a whole year. So technically true! The best kind of true! But it does very little, imho. I didnt even consider the coefficient of performance if the fridge, which would get us to around 0.1 kWh using something like COP=2.5."
soylent,3bvcrg,sleepycorn,2,Fri Jul 3 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"You should probably consider the fact that the thermostat isn't perfect (temperature won't mix/flow instantaneously), and the compressor will always run a little more than it should. Furthermore, the first few seconds will probably be wasted energy, before cold air starts coming out. Since the heat capacity of air is so low, only a few seconds of genuine cooling are needed, but do you really think the compressor will stop after a few seconds?  Your physics is solid but your product engineering could stand to grow a little. :)"
soylent,3bvcrg,PirateNinjaa,2,Sat Jul 4 12:20:38 2015 UTC,"Haha product engineering would not be considered one of my strong points :).

soylent,3bvcrg,ryanmercer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"I also wonder, because this solution depends on the thermostat having a very slow response. If it's very fast, insulating the thermostat a little bit would actually help, so the bottles can cool the air before the thermostat notices the temperature change."

But it's much more energy efficient to keep something cool than it is to cool something.

soylent,3bvykd,Powderfood_Phil,2,Thu Jul 2 21:14:47 2015 UTC,Conflicting desires for more focus or more freedom in online communities is a common conflict. I think we're doing pretty well here. The idea that we need a more general subreddit surprises me. I've seen several previous requests for more focus and a few spinoff communities but I think this is the first request to broaden the focus. The name implies that it could be limited but that's not the case. Soylent refers to a specific product but also to the movement as a whole. This is a bit biased but we haven't managed to agree on another name yet.  Reddit is relatively good at solving these issues. Karma alters the visibility of threads to please the majority. Subreddit creation is free and multireddits can improve the situation for small subreddits. Splintered communities are still a huge issue but it's not as catastrophic as it is for other formats.   If you'd like to try forming another subreddit on the topic I wish you luck. I like the idea of /r/Soylent_DE and similarly focused ideas that target a niche which is usually drowned out here but I'm not sure what would happen with a more general one.
soylent,3bvykd,Powderfood_Phil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"Soylent refers to a specific product but also to the movement as a whole   I don't think that's the case anymore. I gave an interview a few days ago, and when I started a sentence with ""the basic idea of soylent..."" there was quite a bit of confusion on the other end - it wasn't clear at all that I meant all soylents. A year ago it would have been perfectly clear what I meant.  Of course, to people who've been here from the start the connection is obvious. But now there's a whole new ""generation"" of users who have been exposed to the idea of powdered foods not via Soylent, but by coming into contact with Joylent, Mana, Queal or the like. I think this trend will only increase, especially since RosaLabs Soylent still isn't available world-wide or even in the EU.  As great as original Soylent is (or seems to be - as a European I still didn't have a chance to test it *grumble* ) I think that the idea has outgrown the company. That may have some impact on the subreddit fairly soon, and I think it's a good idea to discuss this sooner rather than later."

But there is a large range of what can be healthy.  Some people are 80/10/10, which is 80% of their calories from carbs, 10% from fats, and 10% from proteins.  Others are very low carb, so they are closer to a 5/60/35 ratio.

soylent,3bwk6w,denart4,2,Fri Jul 3 20:25:47 2015 UTC,Okay that makes sense.
soylent,3bwk6w,james15358,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:27:12 2015 UTC,:) yeah I ordered joylent sport for those extra calories and protein.
soylent,3bwy6j,truthAboutStuff,7,Thu Jul 2 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"I think one thing to keep in mind is... what exactly are you comparing a soylent diet to?  Were you already the picture of health, calculating your dietary requirements and ingesting the optimal foods to meet your calorie, mineral, and vitamin needs on a daily basis?  You ask if it is safe to live on.  Well, I'm pretty sure fast food restaurants and junk food isn't safe to live on, but I've been giving it a shot for the past 30 years.  Soylent products are certainly an improvement over that lifestyle.  If you need more than 2,000 calories (and want to remain on 100% soylent for all food you consume) you can simply eat more to get more calories, just note that the vitamins you are getting are more as well.  Whether that is good for you or not is purely up to you and what level of nutrition you are aiming for.  After all, some people look at the current Soylent formula and feel they need more protein, fiber, salt, etc. than what is provided in the 2,000 calorie bag."
soylent,3bwy6j,UgarteTheThief,5,Fri Jul 3 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"Check out the FAQ. We also have had people eating amounts ranging from once every now and then to 100% with directly attributed problems. It's food, made up of normal food so normally allergies apply. I'm not too worried. You get armchair nutritionists complaining about the protein or fiber and I think they are things worth paying attention to but this is the stuff they are paying people to take into consideration and who have the knowledge to do so."
soylent,3bwy6j,_ilovetofu_,0,Thu Jul 2 20:58:12 2015 UTC,I have high hopes for things like Soylent. I was just under the impression that its still more of an experiment stages. So its definitely ready for prime time?
soylent,3bwy6j,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"I've been on it for a year. It's experimental in that this combination of ingredients and dosages hasn't been used before, but separately everything is fine, so together I don't see why not. If something medically started happening, I would talk to my doctor and then all of you guys."
soylent,3bwy6j,SparklingLimeade,3,Fri Jul 3 02:50:05 2015 UTC,I am extremely confident. Compared to what I was eating previously it's good. Compared to what I see some other people eating there's no way it could be worse. This is my favorite point.  Soylent is not yet perfect. There are probably diets that are significantly better than current version although we can't agree on what they are. We should be able to eat well without soylent. Health statistics show that as a whole people are terrible at eating well.
soylent,3bwy6j,IWTD_,0,Thu Jul 2 22:25:26 2015 UTC,I find most those people only care about taste which I hear Soylent has none of.   Though i feel the people here have taken me wrong. I plan on ordering some Soylent and had some concerns.
soylent,3bwy6j,slinkyschnitzel,2,Fri Jul 3 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think that the taste varies depending on what people expect it to taste like. For me it tastes like blended oatmeal yet  I've seen others compare it to various other tastes.   To be fair I have no sense of smell, so my input might not be as relevant."
soylent,3bwy6j,IWTD_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:33:12 2015 UTC,"Can I ask: Do you find that some foods have no taste? Or very little taste?  I imagine eating something you can't taste could be pretty boring, and have been thinking Soylent would be good for someone in that position."
soylent,3bwy6j,jd_edc,2,Fri Jul 3 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah some stuff doesn't taste like anything to me. I can still taste sweet, salty, etc, but if I close my eyes I can't tell you what I am eating (lettuce vs spinach for example).   So in theory I should have a perfect diet since I actuelly don't mind eating veggies and stuff. But I get so bored of having to cook and eat that I end up just buying random stuff outside when hungry. In a way soylent is the best invention for me, I just started this week and already I haven't been buying food randomly when out in the city. This is gonna save me a lot of money."
soylent,3bwy6j,sleepycorn,2,Sat Jul 4 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned. There is more risk involved in driving home from work each day, IMO. Compared with the convenience-food diet that Soylent has replaced, I consider this a hedge."
soylent,3bwy6j,PsionicKitten,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:39:21 2015 UTC,Do you consider Soylent as a way to save money or is it a convenience thing?
soylent,3bwy6j,dexmonic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"Neither. He was saying he ate junk food before. Whatever was convenient.  It was the same for me. Cheap take-out every night. Little vegetables. Eating the same thing for half a week, then switching to something else. Being hungry for large parts of the day, and eating until I'm satiated at dinner. (And not lifting any weights.)  Soylent probably does cause some health problem, compared to a ""perfect"" diet. The thing is, we don't know what constitutes a perfect diet, and Soylent is a hell of a lot less likely to kill me than the way I was eating before."
soylent,3bwy6j,_ilovetofu_,2,Fri Jul 3 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"I find the argument that ""one size fits all"" with each bag being 2000 calories to be some of the most inane of arguments.  If you need more calories,  you eat more food.  If you need less,  you eat less food.  Same with soylent.  The FDA bases their recommendations off of a 2000 calorie a day diet, so do people who need 2200 calories complain that the FDA is is giving a one size fits all recommendation mandated to be printed on all food?  If you're worried about your nutrition, you should see a nutritionist, regardless of your type of food.  If you're not then your body will react to any type of food, whether it's powdered, traditionally cooked or fast food. They all have differences in proportions which your body reacts to if you have too much or too little of something."
soylent,3bwy6j,poonblaster69,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:46 2015 UTC,Thats what I was asking. So I simply eat more? I guess the answer is yes. My concern was I hear things almost every day about how too many vitamins and such are bad for you.
soylent,3bwy6j,BairaagiVN,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:45:35 2015 UTC,"Too many of some vitamins can be bad, I've heard, like vitamin a for men. Most vitamins I was under the impression that any excess was excreted through urine or feces. Is this not true?"
soylent,3bvja5,Nirvana9832,7,Thu Jul 2 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"I believe my body just went into shock?   Highly doubt that.   Shooting pain headaches, fever of 102, sweats and then the chills. My gums are swollen on the inside behind my teeth, dizziness after very little physical activity, extreme fatigue.    Sounds like you have a gum infection or something wholly unrelated to soylent.   I'm concerned. Any advice?   See a dentist?"
soylent,3bvja5,ryanmercer,3,Thu Jul 2 14:38:26 2015 UTC,"Could be an allergy to Soylent. Could be a serious tooth infection. Could be cancer. We are not doctors, so we don't have any idea.

soylent,3bvja5,DennisVanWelker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:03 2015 UTC,If you stopped 3 days ago and are still sick I doubt it's down to the Soylent but you sound really sick so I'd get it checked out. You could always tell the doctor the main ingredients in Soylent if you need him to put your mind at rest about allergies.

First thing to do is immediately STOP drinking soylent. Even while it's very unlikely that it is the cause of your symptoms, in the off chance that it is the culprit you should cease your intake.   Second, go see a doctor immediately."

soylent,3bvja5,Cdmbr,3,Thu Jul 2 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"Btw, animals (including us) have a very strong tendency to attribute illness to the food that we had eaten right before the illness, which is known as taste aversion. This is a survival mechanism that helps us avoid poisons, but it often backfires in our modern world and causes us to avoid and attribute sickness to healthy food. Make sure you see a doctor (if you haven't yet)."

soylent,3bu1jq,ryanmercer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:54:43 2015 UTC,The best way I can describe the taste is it's what watered down antirfreeze smells like to me.   It's just a sweetness I can't place to anything I've ever consumed before. 1.4 was basically unsweetened 1.5 that was considerably thicker.

soylent,3bsa6v,SenorDosEquis,10,Wed Jul 1 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"No. People still have trouble understanding the purpose of defining serving sizes how to measure using them. Using 1/4 instead of 1/3 makes it easier for people to do the math. A meal != a serving. It is 9.10 per day, that's all that should really matter and it hasn't changed. The fact that they list it as 112+ meals is pretty bad advertising because there is no definition of a meal, unless they equate meals and servings which again, is pointless. It's not slimy, it's trying to explain something simple that people don't quite understand because they look at it in a complicated way."

The fact that they list it as 112+ meals is pretty bad advertising   I don't think it's bad advertising. 112+ meals means $3/meal, which they are highlighting as a key selling point. When most people think of a meal, they're thinking of Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. ""I spend way more than $3 on dinner!"" is what they want people to think. Unfortunately, one serving of Soylent does not replace your dinner. This is why I find it slimy.   it's trying to explain something simple that people don't quite understand   I don't at all get that impression. Can you elaborate?"
soylent,3bsa6v,_ilovetofu_,4,Wed Jul 1 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"It is $9.10 a day if you consume all 2,000 calories.     For months people have come in asking what to do if they are hungry after eating a serving, how to measure it, etc. It's all on the bag.

They don't advertise the daily cost of 2k calories, though, they advertise the price of a meal. Previously it was $4/meal, now it's $3/meal. But as you say by any real measure, the price has not changed; they've only changed the definition of a meal."
soylent,3bsa6v,TrekkieTechie,5,Wed Jul 1 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"At $9.10 a day that's $3.03 a meal if you eat 3 meals a day, OR $2.28 a meal if you split it into 4 meals.   It's not misleading at all, it's $3 a meal if you eat 3 meals."

In fact it does exactly that for me, and I'm certainly not alone, so your brush might be a bit broad.  To my mind, what Rosa Labs is doing is no different than what any prepared meal manufacturer does: they pick a serving size, and it's up to you how much you actually eat.  To be ""slimy,"" I think they'd have to do what I've seen some candy/junk food/soda companies do, where they package their food in what a rational person would assume to be an individual serving, but on close inspection of the nutrition facts, it's actually two or three servings, so the calorie count is wildly inaccurate."

I agree with you that 1/4 of a 2000 calorie pouch can indeed be a dinner for some people.  I'm questioning the change from 3 meals per pouch to 4 meals per pouch between versions 1.0-1.3 and versions 1.4+, and the fact that they've lowered their advertised price for a meal without changing the actual price of anything.  $255 used to only get you 84 meals :(, but now it gets you 112 meals :)! Except they aren't shipping any more food."
soylent,3bsa6v,dreiter,6,Wed Jul 1 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Market research is a thing. My impression is that they found out that few people were actually consuming 667 calories per meal/2000 calories per day, thus they were selling themselves short.  $225 used to get you 56,000 calories, and still does get you 56,000 calories. There's no established, accepted definition of the word ""meal"" that involves specific calorie counts; they aren't being slimy. The only way they could avoid this completely is by advertising solely based on calories, but that isn't particularly pithy or graspable at a glance by John Q. Public."

I suppose it is possible that they found through market research that most people weren't eating 2000 calories a day. However, responding to that would be directly at odds with the stated nutrient target of Soylent.   Soylent’s nutritional profile is formulated to meet the needs of the average adult Homo sapiens sapiens.   Source  The average adult Homo sapiens sapiens' nutritional needs include consuming 100% of the nutrients listed, and ~2,000 calories per day.  If you are only eating three ""meals"" as defined by Soylent's marketing, you will now be consuming less than the recommended amount of nearly every vitamin and mineral you need.

soylent,3brvy5,temetvince,5,Wed Jul 1 17:26:34 2015 UTC,I had a borderline abusive relationship with food - my diet was shit and I almost always overate at lunch and dinner. After about 2 days on 100% Soylent I was super in to it.  I was actually looking forward to drinking it for my meal knowing I was going to torture myself with some shit garbage meal again.  I don't stress over food anymore and I feel so much better about things in general.
soylent,3brvy5,SpacemanLeesBong,2,Wed Jul 1 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Mm, shit garbage...  Really though, good for you."
soylent,3brvy5,Accalon-0,5,Thu Jul 2 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to figure out exactly how to balance my Soylent and start to feel better (I feel super great pretty much all the time now).  There's an adjustment period when you dramatically change your diet like that, that might throw your body for a loop. You might feel a bit crappy in the first couple of days. It might be easier to adjust if you start at about 1/3 Soylent and work your way up.   Especially if you're exercising, make sure to supplement your salt pretty heavily, Soylent doesn't have enough. I just mix table salt into water and drink it, but different people do it in different ways. Salt deficiency can make you feel like hot buttered garbage pretty quickly, so that one is pretty important IMO."

That first 2 weeks were a doozy though, I had a lot of negative reactions to the soylent at first, digestive upset and a weird jitteryness that I think had to do with bloodsugar. All went away eventually, though I do suppliment with a bit of fiber sometimes and I add a cup of frozen blueberries and a banana to 2 of my drinks every day."

soylent,3brvy5,Shmeww,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't have much trouble with flavor, though for texture I MUCH prefer blending it on the spot right before I drink it to blending a batch in the morning and storing it in the fridge. For me blending it on the spot it has a little bit of a grainy texture, but I prefer that over the sort of slimy texture it gets when it's been in the fridge for a few hours. I also like to blend in frozen fruit to give it that icy slushyness and that doesnt last if you store it.  I didn't find the flavor anything but bland at first, and then gradually got to where I enjoyed it even plain, and now it kinda tastes like a milk substitute with protein powder in it. I really prefer mine with fruit in them though, makes it more interesting."

My address zip code was 1 number off (***11 instead of ***12) and I wasn't notified that this was a problem until 2 weeks of asking why my order hadn't shipped yet. I had multiple replies from Soylent saying that they would look into it and ship it right away.  Only later to receive a message stating that my address was not valid. I changed one number and it shipped a few days later.  It's kinda ridiculous that they couldn't figure it out sooner.
soylent,3braan,RainyCaturday,2,Fri Jul 3 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"funny thing is, after they fixed the issue, they sent my soylent to my billing address, not my shipping address. They can't get basic commerce right it seems"

Also, every other shipping I have gotten has never had problems correcting such a tiny error, if their system would look up the address then it should come up with the correct zip code. (i.e. if I type my address into google maps with the incorrect zip code it comes up with the correct one)  Please don't be an apologist for something so simple to correct on their end and what was clearly a failure of their support staff/shipping systems.

Are we really nitpicking on something like your problem right now, when they fixed it within 14 days, and when it's initially your error that caused it?

soylent,3braan,ObeyMyBrain,5,Wed Jul 1 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Almost everywhere charges you before they ship it   I've worked on painfully many payment systems.  The above is not quite correct. The usual practice is to authorize the charge, but to hold back on submitting the charge until the day before shipping. All major cards and payment processors require this if there's not an explicit agreement. PayPal is probably the only outlier that most people will have heard of.  Many small merchants ignore these rules, but larger merchants who get flagged by their payment processors can end up facing a fine. Even if they don't, it generally leads to increased chargeback rates.  The confusion for buyers may be in most bank sites not making it clear to consumers when they've been charged, rather than when a payment was merely authorized. Consumers assume their money is gone since the available balance goes down or a charge shows as ""pending."" It's not yet gone however, and an authorization will expire if the charge isn't subsequently submitted."
soylent,3braan,ObeyMyBrain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"You are correct, I was calling authorizing and charging the same thing. For us, they usually are as the money is not able to be used."

""According to Janet Hug of Visa USA, ""a merchant is not permitted to bill ahead of time"" except in case of a deposit or down payment that the customer agrees to. MasterCard said in a letter that a merchant can charge you before shipment only if s/he tells you and you agree to ""the terms and conditions of the sale."" American Express said the merchant can charge your card as soon as you give your account number; but if you receive the bill before the merchandise, call Amex customer service and you don't have to pay while they investigate."""

Tried blending it with cocoa powder. Was even grittier. Then threw in some peanut butter and it didn't help at all.   Going to make a full pitcher and let it sit in fridge overnight. Hoping that will improve it. Might also pick up some berries or bananas and try mixing that in. Hoping that will mask both texture and flavor.
soylent,3br6ca,rimble,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:49:06 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned using 'a little less powder', I'm guessing you mixed up an individual meal, which I'm not familiar with, I have always prepared the whole bag.  So on preparing the whole bag, put a little water in the pitcher, dump in the bag (water goes in first to help prevent it sticking to the bottom), and ultimately fill up the pitcher nearly to the top with water--obviously plenty of shaking/mixing in there.  I use an immersion blender, it's awesome.  I think you just need more water.  Also, your mouth adjusts to the taste, it's really weird.  I don't mean you learn to tolerate it or 'choke it down', the taste actually seems to change.  Just going from 1.3 to 1.4 I thought 1.4 tasted awful.  I thought the whole Soylent experience was going to fall apart, everything was ruined, what am I going to do now?!  Tasted good again two days later and every day since...it's weird."

I have tried drinking lots of water etc, it kinda works."
soylent,3bp4re,koera,2,Wed Jul 1 13:10:18 2015 UTC,I have a few almonds when hunger hits. Also do you weigh the powder or use scoop? I found d scoop very unreliable without fiddly tamping.

Of course, that's extremely rough math.  Either way, I totally feel your pain. I'm 5'5""/F and went from 175lb to 125lb. Even starting out I had to be under 1600-1800cals/day, and after not much time had to cut to 1200-1400cals/day to keep losing weight. The last little bit I had to go under 1200cals/day. Maintenance at ~130lb was ~1500cals/day or so. When you're a only mild-moderately active woman, sometimes that's how it goes:/"

I would have a ""cheat day"" on Saturdays to keep my metabolism up and to allow for date nights with the wife or other social eating.   I did this a few years ago. With Soylent it's a complete breeze, because you don't have to balance macronutrients and work on variety to keep the diet palatable.   Keep it up!

soylent,3bp4re,Chilez,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:49:21 2015 UTC,How much of that was fat and how much of it was muscle loss? Weight loss does not equal fat loss and in my opinion it is better and healthier to lose overall fat than just focusing on how much total weight was lost.

They did have some trouble with my 3 months of Soylent being too large to consolidate into one shipment (as Soylent ships each month as its own package). But outside of that unexpected delay they've been pretty good for the few times I've needed such a service (2-3 times total).   from u/snakeofsilver"

That was for Soylent 1.0 and since they pack it more densely now I think reshipping will be a bit easier even for larger quantities these days.  I should probably also clarify that the $5 is their fee for their service, you obviously still have to pay the shipping cost, which varies depending on method and carrier. And you're likely to get hit up with import duties and VAT when it arrives here.  If you feel like it you can sign up using my referral link and we both get $10 after completing one shipping. clickzy (I hope referral links aren't frowned upon when clearly marked)."

soylent,3bo00k,amazonv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to post a review of JouleFuel.  -This is the first complaint we have received about a salty taste. We do add a quality sea salt to our product, but this should dissolve evenly in the blending process.  -We recommend JouleFuel to be mixed in a blender with a combination of almond milk and water. Almond milk helps to add sweetness, as we add very little sugar beyond the dextrose based flavoring. Our customers that are more sensitive to taste may use mostly almond milk, where some of our more hardcore users mix with 100% water. It may take a few times to dial in the right mix for you.  -We opted against using oil powders in JouleFuel. It is important to us that our core ingredients are nothing more than ground whole foods and most oil powders carry extra weight (in the form of maltodextrin). We feel the best option to get quality fats in a JouleFuel diet is by adding olive oil. This keeps JouleFuel free of unnecessary ingredients and allows you freedom to choose your oil, as this is normally a personal preference (I personally use Kirkland Signature from Costco).  -The goal of JouleFuel is to support an active lifestyle, which drove us to include more than 2000 calories in a bag. A full bag of 2750+ calories does mix with nearly a gallon of liquid, which is on par for such a diet. We recently added a BMI/RMR calculator which will recommend a caloric intake based on a few simple inputs (age, height, weight, activity level). It will calculate how long a bag of JouleFuel should last based on the number of meals you will be replacing. For example, a 25 year old male 5'10"" weighing 160 pounds needs 2,747 calories to maintain weight assuming a moderate level of activity, which it one full bag of JouleFuel daily.  http://www.joulefuel.me/how-much-joulefuel-do-i-need/"

Since cutting out nearly all carbs with the help of nearly half of my calories coming from a ketogenic soylent, my symptoms are significantly reduced."
soylent,3bjrbe,glug_glug_glug,2,Mon Jun 29 21:07:13 2015 UTC,Do you mind if I ask what autoimmune disorder?  I recently stopped eating official Soylent to hopefully address my own autoimmune disorder (Alopecia).

soylent,3bjrbe,ryanmercer,2,Tue Jun 30 10:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yum! Two very tasty, healthy, high calorie fats IMO!"
soylent,3bjrbe,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:40:26 2015 UTC,Indeed. I don't like avocado by itself but one time I put half a pound of guac on 2 half pound burgers. That was divine.
soylent,3bjrbe,Bonneville865,2,Tue Jun 30 13:45:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed the (unintended) benefit of less heartburn shortly after starting Soylent. It makes a huge difference."
soylent,3bjrbe,chris-biolent,2,Tue Jun 30 01:57:05 2015 UTC,Using a Keto option may be a good idea for someone like you. Keto typically has less than net 20g of carbs (doesnt include fiber). You may notice a lack of energy for three days (keto flu) but it'll work in the long run.   There are a bunch of diy recipes out there or you can go with a provider like ketosoy
soylent,3bjrbe,Anla-shok,2,Tue Jun 30 10:52:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. I have had stomach issues for about 5 years. After eating I get dizzy, nauseous, and my hands and face go numb. My doctor has no idea what has been causing this. I've had an upper GI test, blood tests, and food allergy analysis and nothing explains it. I have been eating once every other day for about a year because feeling hungry is much better than the alternative. I finally had enough of feeling like shit and decided to try something different like soylent. I'm on day 6 and I feel much better all around. The taste was a problem until I started adding some vanilla extract and caramel flavor. I'm only up to 3-4 scoops a day but even that is an improvement."
soylent,3blji7,denart4,3,Tue Jun 30 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Hello /u/denart4,  What a very disconcerting post! This is certainly the first I have ever heard of a customer mentioning these sorts of effects. And we have hundreds of people living exclusively off of Queal for some months now.  Of course I am confident it is not due to Queal, but perhaps /u/fuv-yauk-ath's advice is valid. If anything, it will make you feel secure that Queal isn't the cause.  Feel better soon!  Regards, - Queal"
soylent,3blji7,QuealEU,3,Tue Jun 30 09:56:10 2015 UTC,You should go see a doctor.
soylent,3blji7,reddlvr,2,Thu Jul 2 00:22:42 2015 UTC,I'd stop full turkey for a couple of months if I were you. Not worth the risk to keep going. If it the problems clear you know for sure. If they don't you can look for the actual cause and use your powdered food with confidence. Please update us with your findings. Powdered foods are pretty much untested on long term so all we have is self experimentation.
soylent,3blji7,fuv-yauk-ath,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:38:21 2015 UTC,"If it the problems clear you know for sure.   Not true. You would simply have evidence to support the claim, but more would be necessary to prove this was the cause.  The cause could dissipate over time on its own, or it could run in tandem with something else that OP is doing while consuming Queal.  This is sound advice, but please don't assume it will determine the cause for sure if the problems cease. It can only prove that the problem is likely not Queal if the problems continue."
soylent,3blji7,daknapp0773,2,Tue Jun 30 19:29:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a nutritional expert or a doctor and the others in here also don't seem like they are, so my advise would be to... visit one!   If you would have been eating your every day meal, and you would have been getting those aches and all, would you have though ""hey, it might be that my diet is off""?. Probably not.  If you really don't want to visit a professional for whatever reason, you could do a complete blood check up to find out how your levels are measuring. (Just visit your doctor though)"
soylent,3blji7,SipaStyle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"This.   I have had diarrhea and fevers recently and suspected the powdered food having side effects. Since that was ""new"" and ""not normal"", it was the easiest suspect. Turned out I had gotten different medication for my hay fever, and those meds caused all my problems.  So, yes, visit a doctor. Your regular meal is unlikely to be the cause, I'd say (and have learned)."
soylent,3blji7,boerbiet,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:20 2015 UTC,Can some deficiency be the cause of that?  Or do I have carpal tunnel?   So quick to jump to extremes...
soylent,3blji7,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:03:43 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to slowly withdrawal from queal, starting with dropping one meal in place of traditional food. And see what happens when you begin to wind down from queal."
soylent,3bjq2e,be_bo_i_am_robot,8,Mon Jun 29 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's basically what I'd like to be doing with Super Body Fuel, eventually. And not just calories, but macro ratios too.  I think it could be a good way to offer something different than Soylent, while staying consistent with the ""custom"" approach I've been known for."

soylent,3bjq2e,humdingerbumfinger,3,Tue Jun 30 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like I recall Rob talking about wanting to do something similar, if at all possible."
soylent,3bjq2e,TrekkieTechie,3,Mon Jun 29 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"if at all possible   Don't see why it wouldn't be. They'd just need to invest in some equipment. You should see the machines Lego has for assembling minifigures and sorting pieces for example... so all you need is a machine that gets the order from the computer and dispenses all of the required ingredients into a mixing chamber and does a quick mix then dispenses the appropriate amounts to x amount of packages and feeds them down a belt, the belt goes to a labeling machine that slaps on the custom label and then on to a box, employee double checks contents of box to the invoice, seals and off it goes to your house. Once they figured out the machine (if such a thing isn't already used in the food industry that could easily be adapted to their use) then as resources allow they just add dozens of these things and charge the appropriate amount extra for boutique ordering."
soylent,3bjq2e,ryanmercer,3,Tue Jun 30 10:03:03 2015 UTC,"The cost of that might be prohibitive. Didn't they say in some interview that they're moving ""kilo-tons"" of product per month? I don't think they mix in 28-lb batches! That would mean more man power, more factory floor space."
soylent,3bjq2e,sleepycorn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"The cost of that might be prohibitive   That's why I said they should adjust the price accordingly for the boutique service. They could also set a MOQ, want a boutique mix you have to buy a month's supply at a time, that's a 28-35lb batch depending on the invidiual, a machine could do that relatively quick.  I see two ways to do it:   A pouch goes from nozzle to nozzle, it dispenses the appropriate weight of each component into each pouch, even if you had 30-40 stops on the line you could probably get it to 10 seconds a pounch easily x 30 pouches is 3 minutes for a month's supply and it would be labeled to state that YOU must mix it or make it all at once. A month sized mixing container stops at each nozzle and gets filled, the container then gets capped (by a machine) and then moves down the line to the 'mixing' department, it gets mixed (still by a machine) and then moves to the next stop, packaging and gets packaged by automation. This option would likely be more expensive than method 1.    You could also do BOTH methods. Method 2 would be cheaper in larger quantity, if you ordered 3 months or 6 months worth at a time you could get a discount as the first 2 steps would take roughly the same amount of time regardless of quantity."
soylent,3bjq2e,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"Insightful. Option 1 has a potentially big obstacle: a lot of powders form clumps instead of mixing with water. It's possible the bags would need to be mixed, lest they be hard to use without a blender. (I'm sure they would not make a product that demands a blender. It's against their ethos.) Option 2 might make sense for a 6 month order, but it might be unprofitable at prices that consumers are willing to pay.  More feasible would be making 10-20 different recipes. They would all be made in large quantities, and instead of choosing an exact bespoke recipe, the customer would be matched with the closest formulation."
soylent,3bjq2e,sleepycorn,2,Tue Jun 30 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"www.truenutrition.com has been doing custom protein mixes in 5% increments (and you can add other stuff) for many years and offering protein prices competitive with prepackaged mixes and I'm fairly certain I saw the owner talking about a nozzle dispensing setup similar to what I mentioned. I can order a custom mix from them and it's at my door a week later, often shipping the next business day in amounts as small as a pound. So I doubt it would add much to the price for a boutique soylent experience."
soylent,3bjq2e,ryanmercer,3,Tue Jun 30 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"It would be cool to see a Soylent app that links to myfitnesspal or other fitness apps. I already log my height, weight and excersise so Soylent could see how often I eat powdered foods, what my weight goals are and how active I am."
soylent,3bjq2e,chris-biolent,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:00:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this, or something similar, is just a matter of time. It would be awesome to have such a service!"
soylent,3bjq2e,Shileah186,2,Fri Jul 3 21:33:33 2015 UTC,100%FOOD has a custom order section where you put in your info and stuff.   It's not as in depth as what you describe but pretty close.
soylent,3bksap,DangerCray,3,Tue Jun 30 01:01:19 2015 UTC,That's great! I sincerely hope that keto works as well for you as it has for me!
soylent,3bksap,chrisbair,2,Tue Jun 30 05:16:02 2015 UTC,Nice. Good to hear of your success with it. I have a write up as well on it please check it out. I had a much harder time with the texture and flavor than you did but I've figured out a groove. Almost 1 week now.
soylent,3bksap,elitesense,2,Tue Jun 30 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you're trying Ketosoy. Like you, I've never really enjoyed cooking, so the idea of having a highly structured format (easy to prepare, well-balanced, consistent amounts) was very appealing to me. I've been on it for close to three months now, losing about 10 pounds per month, and noting other benefits too (lower blood pressure, better lipid profile etc).  It definitely works, so stick with it!  One funny thing though: it can get a bit monotonous, so on weekends I find myself actually wanting to cook something else, even if it is just scrambling some eggs. Ironically, spending more time in the kitchen as a result."
soylent,3bksap,KetoDaddy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am going to still cook, figure my weekends would be that way.  I have a slow cooker and that is easy to use and...well... slow cooked pulled pork is just awesome and never gets old.  I also have about 3 boiled eggs a day, or every other day, just depends and/or a salad if I feel up to it.  I've actually been forgetting to eat a few times only having 1 meal of the Ketosoy a couple times in the last few days already."
soylent,3bksap,fn0000rd,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"3 pounds of weight loss in a week is actually kinda high for healthy weight loss, but that's what I hit right out of the gate on regular Soylent too. You don't want to drop it all at once, drastic changes like that are also hard on your body, and even harder to maintain. Like any other diet, the best thing to do is find a way to eat enough, feel full, and lose a pound or two per week. If you do that for a full year, your odds of staying thinner increase drastically."
soylent,3bksap,fn0000rd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, but damnit I just want it to drop quickly then slow down lol.  But then again, every previous diet did that and they all failed so this is different.  It'd be nice to be back at 280 right now as I was just a couple months ago and start from there, meh, I am just pouting at this point lol."
soylent,3blphg,Kyyas,2,Tue Jun 30 06:07:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have any actual qualifications to judge, but I would say hell no. Low B5 is workable, I guess, but you definitely want iodine. Using iodized salt instead of sea salt should help; iodine deficiency is why iodized salt was invented in the first place. The vitamins are alright, but I have big concerns about the large amount of trace metals you'd be getting. A toxic dose of those generally results in ""oh my god everything hurts and nothing works""."
soylent,3blphg,Cdmbr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:25:57 2015 UTC,"(It must be said that I do not actually know how much would be a toxic dose, or whether the amount listed in OP's recipe would lead to an overdose.)"
soylent,3blphg,Cdmbr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:35:03 2015 UTC,"In my relatively uneducated (nutritionally, anyway) opinion your recipe is not good enough to use as a basis for most of your diet. A meal here and there should be fine, but more than once a day could be not good. Just take a look at the micronutrient breakdown further down the ""Recipe Editor"" page ... niacin, folate, iron, manganese, and sodium are actually above the maximum intakes! You also have a very high fiber content, which could cause ""issues"" :). The omega-3 fatty acids are a problem if you go above about 5 grams, I think (though I'm not sure about that). I wonder whether it's because of the base recipe that you used?"
soylent,3blphg,AndyKing42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:51:32 2015 UTC,"As far as most DIYs go it doesn't look too bad, though try to search out some other recipes that are 100% completed for best results.  As some others have mentioned, substituting iodized salt (which is pretty much every normal salt brand you'll find in the grocery store), is a good way of getting your iodine up."
soylent,3bi2i9,bertrand_bio,25,Mon Jun 29 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"a person who is associated but not employed at bertrand food   You really need to clarify that if you want to stop negative attention from building. As it is, that language sounds very calculated and weasley. It's specific on who they're not. But it's vague enough to leave lots of room for who they are, or why they tried deceiving the public.  Specifically: What do you mean ""associated?"" And are they still associated?  Were their activities supported or directed by Bertrand at any point? For example, was this done by a marketing company on Bertrand's behalf? Or was it an investor or other party with any form of financial interest in Bertrand?"
soylent,3bi2i9,unsafeword,4,Mon Jun 29 14:58:37 2015 UTC,I'd guess an overeager brother-in-law or something like that. Something where an exact formulation brings more damage to the viewed unprofessionalism than some shady dealings would bring in reputation damages.

soylent,3bi2i9,Accalon-0,2,Thu Jul 2 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"If you don't actually clarify how they were associated, you just look even more dishonest."
soylent,3bi2i9,Naught,0,Mon Jun 29 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's hyperbole, to say the least. They don't look ""even more dishonest.""  It might make sense for them to clarify the association. But the fact that they admitted the person was associated, and even edited many of the original posts, ""this post was written by someone associated with Bertrand"" is somewhat refreshing. Don't slam a company trying to make things right because they didn't do it on your terms."
soylent,3bi2i9,ricandersen,3,Mon Jun 29 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"Editing the posts is a good move, but you're missing the point. Saying the person was ""associated [with] but not employed at"" sounds like the equivocation a sleazy company would use. It could literally be someone they asked to post on their behalf under the table, and they're only saying something now because they were caught.  Without specifics, most people tend to think the worst of companies, hence why ""transparency"" is such a large concern. You are apparently the exception.  Edit: it looks like it could have been the admins on the forums that edited the posts and not Bertrand, so scratch that point in their favor."
soylent,3bi2i9,Naught,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"It definitely wasn't the admins on the forums. I actually emailed them to ask them to consider removing the threads.

soylent,3bi2i9,ricandersen,3,Thu Jul 9 22:58:17 2015 UTC,I think that was done by the discourse admins

Perception likely will change in terms of this being a sociable drink WHEN it is offered in a Cafe like setting. People care about health, and while /u/Iride4fun points out that food is way too cheap already and we have a distribution issue, I'd like to append that there's also a food waste problem(There are numerous articles and sources, please google). Soylent solves that like canned foods solved it earlier by extending the shelf life of things.  I'm interested in where things are heading in this increasingly robotic world of ours, and I'm worried about people that wont be able to find a low end job. I honestly don't think $5 USD/day is low enough for that group, and that less than that can be achieved with a non-perfect drink - because even 50% DRI is better than ramen for those eating to get by.  Just would like to point out that $172.90 CAD is $138.50 USD at the moment (or, ~$4.95 USD per day)."

soylent,3bilqs,jamesfrancosleftnut,5,Mon Jun 29 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"the way that powdered food can be streamlined is essentially a solution to the distribution problem, you just have to think a bit farther down the road. The raw materials of powdered food are much more easily and efficiently manufactured than, say, a steak. Thus, with increased manufacturing efficiency in the future (which will in turn lower the cost) and the potential of different food products out of these same materials, we'll have something revolutionary."
soylent,3bilqs,Iride4fun,3,Mon Jun 29 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"Precisely! That's one of the main cruxes of my argument, especially when we look at all the problems with current food, and our slugishness at fixing them through other means."
soylent,3bilqs,jamesfrancosleftnut,2,Mon Jun 29 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's useful just to think of food merely as energy. If you can streamline the efficiency with which that energy is produced and delivered then you can improve the food industry immensely. No, this isn't going to happen overnight, but powdered foods are definitely a step in the right direction. Now to just make them taste passable."

Unless you have to do it the traditional way or like to do it, it's an easy sell for soylent.  For some the reasons you mention, don't see ""food"" going anywhere but think some version of soylet will eventually end up being a component of many's diets.

I'm going to make the assumption you're a younger guy who's just pumped up about it and being a bit naive. I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just telling you, food is cheap and for most people, it is a small respite and enjoyable experience from all the shit they go through every day. People don't want to drink a shake, they want to enjoy a meal most of the time. Life is hard enough without removing the taste of food the majority of the time. I think this is a fad for a small percentage of the population that will burn out rather than grow. People struggling to have nutritious meals are not at all interested in drinking soylent regardless of your idealistic though. The process of eating meals is tied inexorably from being a person and aside from the hipsters who are drinking it, it's not going to take over anything. These investors probably want to ride the wave of publicity and the niche market soylent currently has to an exit, they don't actually believe even .001 percent of the population is going to start drinking goop every meal."
soylent,3bilqs,vaginitischlamydia,3,Tue Jun 30 01:01:19 2015 UTC,"In many parts of the world it's not what people want to do, it's what they have to do to avoid starving. In my article I mention how many people are now flavouring their batches, something that would interest me if I try liquid food.   For meals on the go, a lot of people would be happy drinking a shake if they knew it fed them well enough. If the price of Soylent and its competitors' drops, (which I strongly suspect it will due to economies of scale), then people WILL be very interested in trying this out. Why would any investor with a sane mind give them $20 million if they didn't expect them to be able to use it well? That investment firm wouldn't still be around today if they gave out money that recklessly.  I know that traditional food will always be around and be eaten by lots of people, but when you're dealing with a market as large as food, there's lots of room for this new industry to flourish alongside."
soylent,3bilqs,Iride4fun,-2,Tue Jun 30 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"Wait, you haven't tried Soylent? Maybe you're right about the investors. However, I stand by the $ problems. 3 bucks a meal is not even in the realm of what impoverished Africans could afford. Soylent will never get down to a price they could, those people live on a quarter a day...Again, it's insane to think Soylent could meet a doable cost there, it would have to be close to free which would bankrupt the company."
soylent,3bilqs,vaginitischlamydia,0,Tue Jun 30 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"Not Soylent, though I did try a cheaper competitor product for a week, and I felt full and had normal energy throughout. The competition that is brewing between all these new companies in this industry will help slowly bring down the cost. Remember that these companies are learning how to pack nutrients more efficiently much quicker than the traditional food corporations, meaning they will be able to bring their price points down significantly. (They're already making heaps of money as the Forbes article I included in my article says, which will accelerate this).  I agree that getting it to starving people living below the poverty line will be a challenge for a long while, however as the World Bank says, there has been steady progress in shrinking this group of people."
soylent,3bilqs,Iride4fun,-2,Tue Jun 30 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"It's just a fad and the cost is not going to come down that much, case closed."
soylent,3bilqs,vaginitischlamydia,0,Tue Jun 30 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"If Soylent was actually cheaper than real food and people couldn't afford real food, then it might be revolutionary. Neither of those things are true though. I think it will continue to be a hipster product for people who don't exercise a lot. I run 30 miles a week and ride another 100, it just doesn't fill be up at all, and I end up gaining weight on it because I have to eat another full meal with it. Whereas with traditional food, it actually keeps me full. It was very disappointing as I was a very early backer, even emailed rob about how pumped I was about the product and got a response from him, and waited almost a year to receive 1.0. Then it came and literally filled me up as much as a 150 calorie protein shake. That's just not going to work for a person trying to stay lean while training. I think to keep me full all day long, I would have had to eat 4000 calories worth of Soylent, which would have lead to weight gain."

soylent,3bilqs,BoringlyUnique,-2,Tue Jun 30 04:11:20 2015 UTC,That study is not exactly what I'm referencing. There is a single line that I'm sure you read referring to satiation and just stating that it was similar without any numbers. The greatest difference in the study across carbs is 30% between 65 and 35 from the highest to the lowest. It's not specified what TYPE of carbs which is what I'm actually talking about. Low carb veggies you could absolutely not eat the same amount of calories as eating potato chips and feel exactly as full. Are you not familiar with the different portion sizes for calories? I'm sure you've seen the potato chips versus the huge plate of broccoli. So I get that you're just into arguing but the study you referenced has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. Obviously the type of carb actually matters. Are you really under the impression that eating a bunch of candy is the same as 5 cups of broccoli in terms of how full you feel? Of course not you fucking idiot.
soylent,3bilqs,axcho,2,Tue Jun 30 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"short term satiation due to stomach and intestinal distention (because of higher intake mass) is not the same as long term leptin induced satiation due to caloric intake, you fucking idiot."

soylent,3bgwuv,tacojohn48,5,Mon Jun 29 03:29:21 2015 UTC,You might not want to go full straight on. A rapid change in diet could cause some digestive issues and that's nothing to do with soylent. Try soylent for one meal for a couple days and then for two meals for a couple days and then you can do 100%.
soylent,3bgwuv,JVani,3,Mon Jun 29 12:10:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely nothing to worry about as far as health goes. My only concern with using it as a weight loss product would be that someone could continue to eat their diet then just throw the 2000 kcal/day of soylent on top of that. I don't know if soylent would help everyone in the mental battle side of things.

soylent,3bgwuv,Homomojojojo,7,Mon Jun 29 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"I would probably consult a doctor. They say losing 2 pounds a week is healthy. At that weight you would be dropping a lot very quickly going to a 2k diet, as the heavier you are, the higher BMR you have to maintain that weight.   You're basically asking for medical advice. My advice is not to ask for medical advice from the Internet.  Someone did point out in so many words that it may be wise to ease into it rather than going 100% right away. That's probably good advice. Breaking dietary habits isn't easy and going straight to 100% would probably put you off Soylent in the long run, and you might find yourself returning to your previous diet.  I'd personally probably recommend doing Soylent for breakfast lunch and dinner then eating fruits or veggies for a snack. And taking a walk every day. Can be a short walk, but you'll find it gets easier to walk, and finding yourself walking longer, the more weight you lose.  I like broccoli and hummus personally.  But don't listen to me, I'm not a doctor :)"

soylent,3bgwuv,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jun 29 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"Fruits are good. Veggies are better. I just checked my bag of 16oz broccoli and the entire bag has 100 calories.  If you're feeling hungry eat veggies. If you have a sweet tooth eat a piece of fruit. Dates are good for satiating sweet tooth. Often sweet tooth is just a sign your body wants some sugar/insulin. Veggies are more filling and you can eat more with less caloric impact, so will better serve a hunger craving, since the calories are so much less (a reg sized apple probably has 125 calories).  I'd also probably recommend a ""cheat"" day. Not a go crazy and eat as much as you want of whatever you want. I think a lot of people don't succeed in trying to lose weight because so many programs pushed on us today are about deprivation. And we end up falling back into old habits, often hard, because we refuse to accept that we used to enjoy eating certain things. Then we realize we hate our new diet and eat all the things we enjoy!  A cheat day can be simple. You have a favorite meal? Make it your cheat day. I just be mindful of portions, and if you ate too much, don't beat yourself up, you earned the cheat day because you ate healthy the other 6 days. Next week on cheat day you won't eat so much.  I think too many people subscribe and fail at an all or nothing diet. Eating healthy is a choice. I eat healthy most of the time, so I don't feel bad on the occasion I don't.  You'll still lose weight."

My sleep has become MUCH deeper, more solid restful sleep since I started soylent.  Losing weight wasn't really my goal, as I just wanted to improve my diet first.

We drink because we're thirsty. For water. I drink nothing but water (well, and some green tea once or twice a day). I can see the logic of those studies. Also it's just a bad habit to have a sweet tooth. If your insulin was stable throughout the day you'd never have that desire.  It's not bad for you though. In my ""I'm not a doctor"" experience.

Look at it as you are giving up taste for an affordable perfect diet. I have come to the conclusion that pleasure through food is really expensive. I cost both your money and lifespan.   I recommend getting a fitbit. It comes with a food tracking app that allows you to manually enter the nutritional value of each version of Soylent.

It works for sedatray people because it controls hunger and craving (totally true for me) which helps maintain a deficit, but Keto is inneffective for people who sprint and do high intensity, because fat isn't metabolised fast enough. You'll PR your half, but not your 5k.  It's all about what you want, and what works for you. I like working out, so I go for the carbs, and burn my deficit, but before that Keto was amazing, especially when spending much of my day studying.   EDIT: ""deficit"" is hard to spell."
soylent,3bgwuv,UgarteTheThief,0,Tue Jun 30 15:22:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. KETO is bullshit. low-carb is what's doing the trick. Being in a ketogenic state is the point of eating 'keto'. Keto has no credible evidence that it makes a damn bit of difference, I never said low-carb doesn't help.  Ideally one should toggle with their carbs having low-carb days and refill days if their goal is losing adipose tissue, and ideally they want their post workout window to be carbless for 6-18 hours for maximum benefit in adipose tissue loss.  But keto = ketogenic diet. Low-carb = low-carb. Saying keto implies ketosis is what's respoinsible, when it's just not."
soylent,3bgwuv,gxcgbs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:15 2015 UTC,"I've actually read the exact opposite; that you should eat your carbs centered around the workouts, since that's when they are used.   For me it was Keto. It was VERY low carb. 25-40 net carbs. 50-100 net carbs made me feel like crap whether I was working out or not. It's the carb fasting adreniline, and ketones that make my brain laser focused. Too many carbs gives me too much energy, and makes my concentration bouncy. Like I said, different paths for different destinations."

soylent,3bgwuv,chris-biolent,2,Mon Jun 29 09:57:37 2015 UTC,"Checking in at a similar weight.  Whenever I tried to cook ""healthy"", I usually wound up with something I didn't really want to eat.  I would go out to eat later, knowing my ""healthy"" leftovers were still in the fridge from the night before.  I decided to try soylent products to hopefully have something half-way tasty, healthy, and save time from not having to cook.  It works.  The soylent products may not be as delicious as junk food, but I enjoy them more than the beans and vegetables I was trying to force upon myself before.  Preparation time is non-existent compared to cooking every day.  I can't use ""convenience"" as an excuse to buy fast food or order a pizza.  I am even saving money on food shopping as well.  All that being said, I still have cravings from time to time.  I've had some cheat days here and there, and it usually takes me 3x as long to recover that weight loss.  1 bad day + 3 good days = right back where I started.  But, although I lose a few battles here and there, I can still see a downward trend on the ol' bathroom scale.  I started up slowly on soylent, 1 soylent meal per day for a week.  2 meals per day for the next 3 weeks.  Not much to notice physically, just a bit of gas.  Later I tried 100% calories from soylent, but found that to be a bit too monotonous.  I decided I would rather give myself a bit of room calorie-wise everyday so that I could still eat something I like.  For the past week I've had pretzels and trail mix in the evening.  Whatever I'm in the mood for, as long as I count the calories.  I personally keep a chart going in an Excel file.  I believe some cell phone apps are also popular for this task.  Of course, using less than a day's worth of soylent means you also arent' getting all those vitamins listed on the bag, so take that into account.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask, and good luck with the weight loss.  424.6 lbs -> 372.8 lbs so far"
soylent,3bgwuv,chrisbair,2,Mon Jun 29 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, having an all-liquid diet is going to make the weight loss harder. It's so easy to over consume liquid calories, which is one reason why soda should be one of the first things anyone should remove from their diet. I could seriously drink an entire days worth of Soylent in one sitting and then eat what I normally do for the rest of the day. What I'm trying to say is, Soylent did not give me what I really needed, which was self-control. If you want to give Soylent a try, go for it, but be careful that you are replacing meals with it and not just adding it to your intake."

Along with other ones you may not have thought of yet.   Actual validity of the vitamin tablets you buy, for example. Adding Raw Honey for properties not covered by any rda. Nootropics -  improve one or more aspects of mental function The Psychological effects, and how to combat them.   RDI/RDA - definitely don't take at face. and look at many countries. research each ingredient:    Overdose Symptoms (toxicity) Deficiency Symptoms Source Form it is in. Absorption & interaction (with others)   Example:   B2 (Riboflavin) -  any excess would just be flushed as yellow micturate. Iron. excess would build up and damage internal organs, as well as interfering with absorption of other vitamins. Magnesium, your body can only absorb about 2 mg   Etc, Take each one individually and do the research, make a spreadsheet. Mine has several tabs and is ongoing  Don't get hung up on anti organic/natural, if something can be proven to not have pesticides or hormones in it, and is priced right, it would be best to use that.  Once you have a handle on things, set up google alerts for each ingredient, so you are notified as soon as research comes out, and can adjust as needed.  Then, adjust amounts for you personally - there are many ways to tailor the mix for you specifically, for the medical conditions you have, from headaches, gerd to cramps all the way up to heart disease or liver failure.  Once you go DIY, you realise how really bad and inappropriate the commercialized products are, and would be wasting money as well as harming your health."
soylent,3bdvpg,transmitthis,2,Sun Jun 28 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  A few questions/comments though:   Actual validity of the vitamin tablets you buy, for example.   Given that I am initially considering this as a DIY, but with the potential for longer term productisation, I would likely go for getting something a little more basic than vitamin tablets.  Powdered forms of the exact nutrients is what I was thinking.   Adding Raw Honey for properties not covered by any rda.   What properties?   Nootropics - improve one or more aspects of mental function   I definitely intend to investigate the various nootropics, but I think that while there is likely some very good potential there, there's also a very great deal of misinformation and non-critical thinking associated with them that needs to be sorted out to get to something approximating truth.   The Psychological effects, and how to combat them.   I've been consuming near 100% soylents for a while now, so for myself at least, the psychological effects of an all-soylent diet aren't an issue.  For turning it in to a product, I would of course need to ensure a consumption experience (taste/texture/etc) that isn't unpleasant, otherwise it won't sell no matter how good it is.   Don't get hung up on anti organic/natural, if something can be proven to not have pesticides or hormones in it, and is priced right, it would be best to use that.   Absolutely that's true; but on the other side of the coin, most ""organic"" and ""natural"" foods do have pesticides - just ""organic certified"" ones.  Ideally, there will be nothing in my soylent other than what I want to be there - this obviously includes there being no pesticides.  This concept would also greatly reduce the chance that I'd add honey (as per your suggestion above).  Unless everything that is in honey is something I specifically want to be there and I can control the quantities to an acceptable degree, it's not making it in to the recipe.   Once you go DIY, you realise how really bad and inappropriate the commercialized products are, and would be wasting money as well as harming your health.   I don't believe I am significantly harming my health with my current consumption of commercial soylent products.  I am, on the contrary, much healthier for it than when I was living on (mostly junk) traditional food.  My goal with this plan is to optimise even further and also perhaps create something that others can also enjoy and benefit from."

Obviously the amount recommended for a person may vary based on factors such as age or gender--and the government will publish those statistics as well, they just don't have room to fit those onto the size of a box of cereal.  Most people don't get 100% of the recommended amounts of most nutrients and they don't die, they simply have health problems. For example, the average height of an American has decreased in the last few decades because kids aren't getting enough calcium and associated vitamins and minerals. Or Americans have lots of cardiovascular disease in part due to their diet. Or they're just so goddamn fat because they eat so much. Or they have diabetes due to their intake of sugar. Or they don't get enough fiber and (depending on age - there's a reason that prunes are associated with old people and metamucil commercials have old actors) they are constipated and get hemorrhoids from exerting themselves too hard when they shit.

If you have a known issue then it's better to consult your doctor instead of Internet. They'll know better what might or might not make your situation worse, for all we know an otherwise healthy amount of anything could be bad for you."
soylent,3bbzby,snakeofsilver,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"As I said, I am consulting doctors for this. I also had similar blood parameters way before trying Joylent. I'm just interested (for curiosity, not for some kind of self treatment) if there are some ingredients in joylent in a unusually high or low dosis compared to a ""normal, unhealthy"" diet that might trigger those noticable effects.  But obviously this is not as common as I thought. Sorry for bothering you."
soylent,3bbzby,sleepycorn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"I think you need to ask a nutritionist or a doctor who specializes in diet (or in the liver), not a GP. This seems too obscure for a GP. GPs aren't experts outside their area, which is mainly treating common health problems."
soylent,3bbzby,snakeofsilver,2,Sun Jun 28 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, the GP did the blood test for me and immediately referred me to a gastroenterologist (who received some certificate with emphasis on hepatology last year) after the ""anomality"" was confirmed. That's good enough for me :)"
soylent,3bc9fk,roggggggg,3,Sat Jun 27 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"Just watched the first few days of your videos.  A few pointers that others might or might not have already pointed out to you:   You probably shouldn't have gone to 100% Joylent from nothing at all.  Everyone generally recommends ""building up"" to it to avoid things like stomach discomfort and excessive gas.  I understand the idea of the videos, but it's not representative.  Suffice to say though, if you stick with it for the 14 days, you'll probably be feeling much better once the initial ""shock"" to your system is over. Avoid the clumping bits by having a bit of water at the bottom of the shaker/blender-bottle before adding the powder and then the remainder of the water. Make it in advance and refrigerate it for at least half a day to reduce (but not eliminate) the grittiness.  It seems you're either making it on-demand or all in the morning.  Try making it the previous night and then refrigerating. You seem reasonably physically active despite your sedentary job.  Perhaps the 2119kcal of a single Joylent bag isn't suitable for you for one day.  Personally, I use about 75% of a bag per day; but since you go to the gym, cycle, walk over 15000 steps a day, and wash your car by hand, you might need 125% of a bag or or even more.  This would be a reasonable assumption as to why you felt dizzy and had a white-out. I think you got the same batch of banana flavour that I did.  It's definitely not representative of the usual taste of banana Joylent.  Joylent claim the nasty flavour comes from a different oat source, but I only notice it on the banana and not the other flavours.  Suffice to say, they also said they'll switch back to their original oat source, so I expect this bad tasting banana to be a one-off kind of thing."
soylent,3bc9fk,dalebewan,3,Sun Jun 28 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. After doing this for a week I agree that I approached it from the wrong angle. The idea was to see if I could live off it completely, which is totally possible with reduced physical activity. I had a twitter conversation with Joylent and they told me not to take more than 1 bag per day as I could over vitamin. I am just adding in regular meals now if I have very active days. (https://twitter.com/joylentshake/status/614466547646660608).  I'll try making tomorrows shakes tonight to see how that impacts texture and taste.  The weird banana batch makes sense, I've had other bags of banana since that taste way better.  I'll talk about your comments and this forum in todays vlog so that people don't tread the same rocky path that I have.  Thanks again, I really appreciate people taking the time to give me help and advice."

Upping regular Joylent would cause a vitamin overshot.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
soylent,3bc9fk,dalebewan,2,Sun Jun 28 09:27:43 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Regarding the vitamin overshoot, it's probably best to avoid that in general for the longer term, but also if it's just for a short time (i.e. your 14 day experiment) then it definitely isn't going to harm you and would seem more in line with the goal of the experiment than adding some additional traditional food.  Nutrition requirements have a range of acceptable values - not just one specific value, and even if you were to double your Joylent intake (which would be excessive) you'd still be well within that range for pretty much everything."
soylent,3bc9fk,Nino_Joylent,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:12:38 2015 UTC,"/agreed. Thanks. Also, roggg; please get in contact with us to check the batch. it could be that you received the gluten free oats batch. (nino@joylent.eu)"
soylent,3bbnr2,iSeosamh,6,Sat Jun 27 17:59:09 2015 UTC,I've had it before running and had no issue. But generally I think it's better to eat after a workout

So I'll down a quick deal of soylent, some water, wait about 10 mins and go. It's not ideal but it does the job and I have no had any issues.   In a perfect world I've had a decent enough breakfast and i'll have soylent and water after a run, and THAT feels amazing."

soylent,3bbnr2,dustingetz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:17:10 2015 UTC,With Soylent 1.0 and swimming or any workouts it kind of sucks because of the gas. This soon won't matter much since I'll be getting 1.5 soon that I have heard helps with gas and retaining water. Soylent after swimming/any workout is a non-issue for me.  I have gotten more serious with swimming lately which I plan to switch to it as my primary form of cardio instead of treadmill or running outdoors.

soylent,3bcivx,DebussyDehoosy,6,Sat Jun 27 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting that he found the ""optimum amount"" of fiber to be 1.2g. That's certainly why he feels to free to disregard FDA guidance regarding fiber. I recall that once he made a special fiber-free batch of Soylent and took antibiotics to kill the bacteria in his colon so he wouldn't have to poop anymore.  As Rick Sanchez said, ""You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable."" Me, on the other hand, I'm old. If I don't get at least the FDA recommended amount of fiber, I'm constipated, and when I do finally drop a load I run the risk of prolapsing my ass. The reason he gets by with 1.2g is that he is still young.  I need to find a Soylent maker who's above 40."

soylent,3bassf,flashpunk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"I think he suggested to let it sit in the fridge because letting it sit in the powder naturally gets the clumps out, verses getting it to a certain temperature."

Then I pour it over ice if I want it right away. With a cup you cant shake it easily (I have a starbucks cold coffee cup with a lid I sometimes use which works well btw) and any thing like bananas I want to add can easily be put in and blended.

soylent,3bassf,PirateNinjaa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:32:02 2015 UTC,Cooling it down with ice right away and letting it sit in the fridge overnight make two very different results.  I have also never had a problem going 3-4 days not 48 hours.

Because Soylent makes it easy to do vegan from the outset, why not keep it up, just because? I hear the vegan superpowers kick in after a few months, too.  Just a weird passing thought."
soylent,3b6nlq,roggggggg,4,Fri Jun 26 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"Nice video editing!  The dizziness you're experiencing might be to do with Joylent being really maltodextrin-heavy - in a lot of people it'll cause a blood sugar spike and crash.  A number of their competitors (Soylent, Huel, EatNano) have begun to use lower gi stuff (isomaltulose, rice flour, tapioca flour, waxy maize starch etc.) which won't cause such extreme spikes."

The only thing you should be worried about is getting too many calories, or maybe overdosing on some nutrient (unlikely I'm pretty sure).

You can always go get a blood test done by your doctor and see if there's anything you're particularly deficient on. Personally, due to medicines, I need more calcium.   I keep snacking to a minimum with gum. If I really want to chew on something, I'll get some cucumber or some pickles. Pepperoni chips (microwaved or broiled pepperoni slices) also hit the spot."
soylent,3b6075,snugy_wumpkins,2,Fri Jun 26 07:51:55 2015 UTC,Well truthfully I don't feel that different on Soylent. I feel like good nutrition should make my body perfect as I wasn't eating well before. My hair is thinning and my skin could be better. How come some people look so perfect doing nothing? My roommate for example has the thickest head  of hair but she eats a lot and mostly vegetables. I want soylent to do this for me. I used to be a lot healthier when my mom cooked for me.

You could try upping your omega 3:6:9 ratios with some supplemental oil.   Hair is tricky, try out a new product. I'm currently in love with a good hair mask, it makes my hair look stunning. Wen cleansing conditioner is expensive, but it makes my hair look amazingly healthy."

soylent,3b6075,LeifDTO,3,Fri Jun 26 15:57:14 2015 UTC,I like pickles. The salty taste offsets the sweetness of Soylent and the probiotics in them help with the gas issue lots of people have. And the crunch is very satisfying when your jaw muscles don't get much use.

An extra benefit for me since I make my own soylent, is that I reduce the amount of oil and salt in my soylent, to account for what I like to put on the popcorn.

If this is the case, then your snacks should reflect whatever you feel is lacking from Soylent.  If however you trust that it is nutritionally complete (as it's intended to be) and you just really want to snack, then my recommendation would be to go with anything that you enjoy eating and doesn't provide excessive additional calories (unless the calories are what you feel is lacking, but that goes back to my previous paragraph).  Personally, I greatly reduced snacking when I went to a near 100% soylent (Joylent) diet.  My desire to snack on something almost completely disappeared and now it's just the occasional feeling of missing a particular flavour that leads me to grab something snack-like once every few weeks (compared to ""most days"" when I was on traditional food)."
soylent,3b6075,dalebewan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:10:53 2015 UTC,I do believe soylent isn't complete. Aren't their things in food we don't even know about that are beneficial to us?
soylent,3b6075,QC-Butcher,2,Sat Jun 27 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Aren't their things in food we don't even know about that are beneficial to us?   If you think about that question, the only honest answer anyone can possibly give is ""I don't know"".  However, if there were anything vital to short term (up to a year or so) survival that is in traditional food and not in soylent, we'd know about it by now, since many people (myself included) are on 100% soylent diets and seem to be perfectly happy and healthy.  There could of course be something missing that only presents itself after missing it from your diet for a very long time; however given our knowledge of human physiology in general, plus the likelihood of it having been discovered as a deficiency in people somewhere (people around the world in different locations and cultures tend to have quite different diets) makes it seem reasonably unlikely."

I remember my first day with it... I'd expected chocolate.  I mean, I'd have chocolate protein shakes and knew that 'chocolate' flavor could mean a lot of things, but I was still surprised how little it tasted like chocolate. I remember that I was relieved that it didn't taste like shit. At least I knew I'd be able to use it as a weight loss tool, but still. Surprised. It tasted like Chai tea without the sweetness. Kinda.   Two things happened after that: first, my sensitivity to sweet things increased as sugar was cut from my diet entirely. Second, I increased the amount of Stevia I added to the shakes. After a week it started to taste a lot like chocolate. After a month it was uncanny how closely the taste resembled chocolate ice cream. Today I love it and have it daily for breakfast. I'll mix one full days worth and it lasts for 3 or 4 days breakfasts.  Kinda looking forward to hearing whether your experience is the same."

I felt full all day even with only about 800 calories so I can definitely do a couple more days and see how it goes.   Can I ask how you prep/consume your KetoSoy?
soylent,3b4tjj,johnnyprimus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:04:49 2015 UTC,"No problem. For the bulk pack I combine 2.25 cups powder with 120cc oil (It should ship with a 40cc scoop) and 2 liters of water. I use an immersion blender for about a minute to ensure it's a smooth as possible. Some batches seem to be extra thick after refrigeration, in which case I just throw in another .5-1 cup of water.  Same deal with the daily packets. Just adjust water to your liking. The immersion blender is a huge help in terms of consistency.   EDIT: I also add 29-31 drops of Stevia. Additionally, since my Protein macros are different, I add a 73cc scoop of protein powder. This stuff (unflavored)."
soylent,3b4tjj,johnnyprimus,2,Fri Jun 26 17:07:36 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've found extra water + blending makes all the difference in the world with my batch today!!  My questions to you are:  1. What immersion blender do you use? 2. How loud is it compared to a typical blender? I get off work at midnight so I usually prep around 2am in an apartment building and I want to be as neighborly as possible. Walls aren't too thin but a regular blender is just a bit too loud for 2am
soylent,3b4tjj,chrisbair,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"This blender, and this kitchen mat. The blender is much quieter than a standard kitchen blender. These pitchers are amazing if you can find them in stock. I have adjoined neighbors as well and don't feel bad blending late at night."

If you are used to a full fiber diet it will be challenging to switch to Soylent 1.4/1.5. (As Rob said of the previous versions, ""In fact, this has the full amount of fiber, that nobody in America's getting. So it's quite regular."")  But reducing fiber means that people who just trying out Soylent for the first time don't have gas problems, so I guess the the adverse health consequences are worth it? Rob said that in the next two years, the FDA will be cutting the recommended amount of fiber, and they're just ahead of the curve.  Personally, I think his statement needs a big fat ""[CITATION NEEDED]"" next to it."

soylent,3b3tsz,CassiusEU,2,Fri Jun 26 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Although the concept is the same, the products are actually really different as the ingredients used in Jake differ from the others. We believe that it's the ingredients that makes the product, so this is what we primarily focus on. So, All recipes are unique. Thus, not only the taste and structure, but also the quantities and ratios of micro- and macronutrients differ. We believe that the nutrition sheet is what makes the product, so this is what we primarily focus on.  Adding to that nutrient sources differ a lot in biovailabillity - the amount to which our body can absord a nutrient. It matters whether you use Magnesium Oxide or Magnesium Carbonate, Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) or cholecalciferol (vitamin D3).  Just like e.g. Soylent or Joylent, we have our own set of benefits. It is to the customers to decide what they find most important. A higher amount of protein for the very active among us. Or to not decide: I can imagine that people will alternate between different brands to cover different needs, especially when future development and differentiation takes the products further apart. Morning coffee Joylent, afternoon Jake, evening Soylent-bar, yum!"

soylent,3b4g6b,PasqualN,7,Thu Jun 25 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Omega-3s are essential, of which there are three main kinds DHA, EPA and ALA. Your body is able to synthesise DHA and EPA (From fish or Algae) from ALA (from plant sources). It's debated whether the conversion rate is fast enough for optimal health, but you wont get any obvious deficiency symptoms.   For DHA and EPA there are two options for Soylent, The first is fish oil, which is cheaper but not might not make it taste very good, is not vegetarian and possibly has PBC or mercury contamination. The second is algae oil which is more expensive, which I guess is why some just go for ALA from flaxseed.."

Most 'knock-off' brands don't have it because there are only a few companies that sell it (life'sDHA is the big one) and therefore it is expensive."
soylent,3b4g6b,dreiter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hi, Ambronite has DHA from sea-algae, we are currently lab testing the levels we have DHA fatty acids in the product. I agree there aren't that many non-fish / vegan DHA ingredients in the market. I think Life'sDHA which is extracted from sea-algae is a good one.  The human body's ability to convert ALA to EPA and DHA in the liver is quite low. Whether that is still adequate for good health is debatable, I think. At least research and studies by fish oil and other DHA ingredient companies seem to conclude that 250mg or so DHA would be necessary to optimal brain function. The omega 6-to-3 ratio could be more important for the body to function optimally.  Dr. Burdge, for instance, from Southampton University in UK, has published many studies on the topic: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16188209"

They ship in North America and I found the taste of their double protein and low carb varieties to be much better. Only thing with them, is that since it's all organic there are some bits of seeds in the mix. I found it appealing actually and enjoyed having the seeds to chew on a little bit but not everyone likes that. As a note with 100% food though, start with not much water in your mix and slowly add more till you find your ideal consistency. Their mixes I find suffer a lot more in taste/consistency if you have too much water.  I tried a month of their double protein and low carb mixes, and am currently trying a month of Soylent.

Masa is generally cheaper but the texture is pretty grainy and some people don't like the corn/tortilla flavor. Oat flour is more expensive or requires you to grind your own from whole oats. Oat flour is also overly rich in some nutrients and usually requires added maltodextrin. Most people prefer the flavor and texture of oats. There are other options of course but these are the most common by a lot.  Protein Whey, pea, rice, soy, wheat. There are options. Whey is a good option if you're not vegan and don't have a problem with traces of lactose. The vegetable proteins usually require a little mixing to get a good amino acid profile. The protein shake products sold for body builders are usually some blend of protein with some level of flavoring, body building supplements and maltodextrin for bulking. They're good as long as you make sure of what's in them and account for it. Recipes are usually written for pure protein isolates because they're predictable and can be bought in bulk."
soylent,3b3vp2,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:47:18 2015 UTC,Does Psyllium Husk Powder in Keto Chow serve the same purpose as Masa in People Chow?
soylent,3b3vp2,ketolent,2,Thu Jun 25 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"No they serve two different purposes and are not interchangeable. Masa is a true carbohydrate and calorie source, it is part of the caloric (energy) component because it converts to sugar and ultimately glucose in the body. Psyllium husk on the other hand is a source of fiber. The carbohydrates in psyllium husk are netted and it is not an energy source (not converted to glucose) - it's a component used to improve digestion and better mimic traditional food."
soylent,3b3vp2,ketolent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:43:02 2015 UTC,"So, what would be the equivalent of masa in Keto Chow?"
soylent,3b3vp2,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:29:40 2015 UTC,You need the masa's caloric equivalent from either protein or fat. The two recipes aren't really comparable as one is ketogenic and the other is not.  You can see how we allocate the calories for ketolent here - ketolent.com/nutrition. This should give you an idea of how it can be done.
soylent,3b1s1r,DIY_powderguy,11,Thu Jun 25 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"Hi! I understand your concerns. Until some years ago, cholecalciferol (D3) was indeed only available in a non-vegan form, mostly produced from lanolin extracted from sheep’s wool. However, Vitamin D3 is now also widely commercially available in vegan form: extracted from lichen.  Jake uses the vegan form of Vitamin D3 made from lichen. I cannot speak for other vegan alternatives using Vitamin D3, but knowing that vegan D3 is commonly available may take away your concerns."
soylent,3b1s1r,Jake_Julian,3,Thu Jun 25 10:54:52 2015 UTC,"Lichen:       A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a mutually beneficial relationship (symbiotic relationship).    The whole combined life form has properties that are very different from properties of its component organisms. Lichens come in many colors, sizes, and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose),  or other growth forms.  A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens.  Here, ""macro"" and ""micro"" do not refer to size, but to the growth form.  Common names for lichens may contain the word ""moss"" (e.g., ""Reindeer moss"", ""Iceland moss""), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant.  :3 Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do.  :2 Instead they produce their own food from sunlight, air, water, and minerals in their environment.  When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites but use the plants only as a substrate.

Yes, you read that right. This is an entirely non-intrusive procedure, it’s just taken from the wool itself of course. So this type of vitamin D3 is acceptable for use by vegetarians, however we know that this isn’t a product any real, convinced vegan would want. So we needed a new source for it. We finally managed to get our hands on a plant-based vitamin D3 variant, extracted from lichen. This is great news! However, because it has to be integrated into the rest of our vitamin/mineral mix, the internal process at our manufacturers is long and boring. It has now been accepted to be put into production but we are looking at a good 6 weeks before we can actually use the product in our own production."""

I don't think Joylent's Pablo minds sharing the relevant excerpt from his answer:   currently all of the vitamins in Joylent are extracted from non-animal sources except for Vitamin D3, which is originally extracted from sheep wool.

soylent,3b3wes,ttubravesrock,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"well by volume you want to use ~2:1, so for going 1 at a time you could just get a half cup and mix it with one cup of water. That works out to about 265 calories, or a snack. You could also do 1 cup of soylent with 2 cups of water for 530 calories, or a meal.  The whole pouch is 112ml x 8 = 896 ml, so you would want to mix it with about 1.7-1.9L water. If you have a 2L container, it won't be big enough for the whole pouch.  I guess the main thing is that the scoop is a little under a half cup."
soylent,3b3wes,Cdmbr,2,Sat Jun 27 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"As /u/ttubravesrock said, the pitcher is perfectly fine. If you mix it the day before and refrigerate it overnight, it gets pretty smooth."

In my mind I was convinced that it would be similar to a protein shake but it is in fact, just as everyone says, very much like cardboard blended with oats and maybe some milk. Bland and non-specific. I've experimented by adding a few different things in it for flavoring (one glass with cinnamon, one with cocao, one with sweetner, one with all three, etc).  It'll be interesting to see how I perceive the taste as time goes on since I intend on making this my primary source of nutrition."

There should honestly be a sticky or sidebar that just says something to the effect of ""Soylent (like any other food) cannot help you lose/gain weight. It is only beneficial in the fact that you can more easily track your intake. Calories consumed and calories expended is the only thing that effects weight fluctuations.""  If I see another fucking dumb-ass post like this where the user gives us every detail of his life, down to the time of day he works out, but doesn't have the common sense to do a little bit of research on basic nutrition I'm going to explode. Soylent is not an easy out path to weight loss it's a tool that should only be used by those who understand at least the basics of nutrition."

soylent,3b0ntu,ruffyamaharyder,2,Thu Jun 25 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I want to lose body fat %. I've started adding more protein (Soylent by itself is too little in my opinion for someone working out) and I've started adding more Fiber (Soylent by itself is too little in my opinion) adding these two things changed everything. I'm no longer fatigued nor bloated.  I was doing cardio 6 days a week, lost 11lbs but wasn't feeling slimmer in regard to fat. Tomorrow I'll be doing weight lifting, but making sure while doing it, my heartbeat stays above 130 by jumping rope and rowing whenever it drops while lifting. I use an apple watch to monitor heart beat.  Start counting your macros properly. Carbs, Protein & Fat. Soylent makes this really easy to do without having to weigh food. Don't forget your cheat meal once a week that will reset your metabolism and fat burning hormones. Think of it as a little hack that lets your body know you still eat like shit and should still burn fat (even though that's not true). But eat cheat meals strategically. Double up on your macros. I stay away from fried food even on cheat meals. I just eat a lot more and more fun stuff. Like a delicious steak, vegetables, mashed potatoes, some red wine, even a little dessert.  Pizza, Pasta, Burgers are all great cheat meals.  I suggest finding out what you should be taking in for your age using the soylent nutrition calorie: https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/calculator  and doing exactly that. Don't try to get smart and do less than the recommend calories you should have hehe. Do it exactly. If you're taking in Soylent to get 2000 a day, when you add more protein (Again find out what you should be taking with some kind of calculator) you'll add more calories to that, and same with fiber.  For protein I just use unflavored whey protein from amazon, and for fiber I use this: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QYBMUC/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1435229302&sr=1&keywords=fiber+supplement  Hope this all helps."
soylent,3b0ntu,thescorer,2,Thu Jun 25 10:48:39 2015 UTC,"Soylent is not going to make you put on fat if you are still hitting your caloric target. Unless you're significantly cutting calories well beyond your daily value, you won't be in full muscle atrophy when on a diet. You're bound to lose some muscle during a cut, but you won't be converting muscle to fat.  More likely you're retaining more water. Carbohydrates promote water retention, and beyond that sodium also has a significant effect on water retention. Given that you're already working out significantly, it sounds like you'll be retaining water if your weight changes at all."
soylent,3b0ntu,fenlain,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:14 2015 UTC,"A sedentary 200 lb person with 30% bodyfat would need at least 95 grams of protein a day (1.5 g/kg of Lean Body mass) to not lose noticeable muscle while in a caloric deficit. However, this is a minimum, and more active/muscular people would require more. Seeing how active you are, I would definitely recommend a higher intake (more protein has other positive effects besides muscle retention as well, such as being more filling and having a much greater thermic effect of food). More info about protein intake during weight loss can be found here: http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/protein-intake-while-dieting-qa.html/  tl;dr: Soylent users lose muscle when using it to diet because it does not have enough protein."

I fill it to the 2-quart line, dump the bag in, shake, and I'm done. Don't have to deal with lumps getting stuck on the walls or in the threads of the lid. The overhead and the fact that you're throwing around 2 quarts at once allows it to mix much better.   This may not be a solution for you if you have a motor disability, as you have to hold the spout down while shaking.

That said, I wouldn't rule out observer bias. You'd really want a good before / after picture to tell if there was a difference."
soylent,3ayx3p,synn89,7,Wed Jun 24 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"Some people (not most) go gray due to copper deficiency, and I think soylent contains some."

soylent,3ayx3p,blindjoedeath,4,Wed Jun 24 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, gray hairs can be caused by vitamin deficiency. If you are taking Soylent, you should be receiving all of the necessary vitamins your body requires. Assuming that someones previous diet lacked these vitamins, it is definitely possible."

But, observer bias can happen collectively, so who knows.   My diet prior to Soylent was not ideal, so it's definitely increased my nutrient intake."

soylent,3ayx3p,majeric,0,Thu Jun 25 07:06:40 2015 UTC,"It's not really an extraordinary claim when you consider that Soylent is made up of the ideal nutritional intake of the human body. If a lack of any one of those nutrients can cause gray hair then it is perfectly plausible that the new intake of that nutrient via Soylent is reversing the gray hair. Soylent is not some mythical potion from beyond the stars, it's just a bunch of raw ingredients mixed together."
soylent,3ayx3p,NakedAndBehindYou,2,Thu Jun 25 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"Soylent is made up of the ideal nutritional intake of the human body.   To the best of our understanding. More over, eating the perfect food doesn't reverse aging (which is basically linked to pure calorie count).  Do you know what causes hair to grey? (Stress and vitamin B12 deficiency seems to contribute to grey hair but it doesn't mean that it cause it. Correlation isn't causation).  It's an extraordinary claim largely because it has no foundation in evidence. The fact that the earth orbited the sun was an extraordinary claim before it was proven."
soylent,3ayx3p,majeric,0,Thu Jun 25 03:28:52 2015 UTC,It's an extraordinary claim largely because it has no foundation in evidence.   Are you saying that there's no scientific evidence of any of the ingredients found in Soylent in reducing or reversing graying hair? Somehow I doubt that.
soylent,3ayx3p,eriklb,2,Thu Jun 25 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"Somehow I doubt that   Speculating on the existence of evidence isn't science. Now if you were to hand me a peer-reviewed study published in a reputable scientific publication that demonstrated an ingredient that reduced or reversed graying hair, that would be science.  More over, you'd shatter an entire industry that's built up hiding the graying of hair if it were a scientific fact."

soylent,3avuou,Nachie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"I'm in decent shape. I made my Soylent order when I was still in the Army, so I guess that might count towards proof that I'm not too greasy and pudgy. I've gained a little post-Army pudge but replaced most of it with muscle since I took up powerlifting.  I drink a meal(still on 1.3) in the morning 30 min to an hour before lifting, if I do fasted workouts I struggle more so a quick breakfast is awesome. I prefer Soylent over solid food, I like not having much in my stomach and not burping up bacon during a workout. I'll drink coffee sometimes, never use pre-workout.  After lifting I mix whey protein with a half(or full) meal of Soylent, which is my favorite use for Soylent since the alternative is spending Sundays doing meal prep or having to figure out food when fatigued.  Those are my only Soylent staples 4-5 days a week, I'm flexible with everything else. My Soylent use is centered around my workouts but I use it for occasional snacks and dinners.  FWIW My workout partner has a lot of ""weak"" days that he blames on not eating enough. I've had consistent energy and found that my breakfast is the main reason for it, in my experience it's more crucial than a good night's sleep. Also, my partner takes pre-workout, something halfway through the workout, post workout, BCAAs, fish oil, etc.(one of his customers gives him a discount at GNC so he buys a ton of supplements), has been lifting for a few years and I'm cruising past him in my 3rd month of power-specific training fueled by Soylent, black coffee and cheap whey protein. So, I'm definitely spending less money than him to make sure my nutrition is on point and seeing much better results.  A lot of my progress is due to newbie gains, genetics and my central nervous system getting used to things, but Soylent is the cornerstone of my nutrition and the main reason I've kept my subscription is that it's helping me meet my fitness goals without having to do tons of meal prep."

Like someone else on this thread I have a healthy metabolism and being able to slam down 1,000 calories at a time is the only hope I - or my wallet - have for hypertrophy.  The other effect that shouldn't be underestimated is that since I started using Soylent for 33-50% of my daily food intake my body has almost completely lost its tolerance for shitty processed food. There's all kinds of stuff I used to eat which now will only earn me a 2 hour nap and a feeling of disgust. As a result the food I eat that isn't Soylent has also seen a marked improvement - much more fresh fruit and nuts.  It's working great for me!"

We make our own and call it super drink. The macros are good set to 800 cals a drink, but the micros in our version are less than perfect. We did not bother to spend the time or money to make it perfect. We find it helpful to gain muscle mass. He has been fat before, but I do not attribute much of his fat loss to the drink. The man puts in work at the gym and track and climbing centre.  When we go rock climbing, it is very convenient to be able to fill a shake bottle with powder and just take that. When I can't be bothered to cook or get hungry at night once I'm already in bed, it is also very convenient then. The drink has become my favoured backup meal, replacing freezer pizza, which can only be good for my health. I do not think soylent should be pitted against 'real' food as if choosing one implies abandoning the other. I'll replace a meal or four a week. I have come to crave the taste, as I assume my body recognises it as a source of particular nutrients that I assume I am not getting elsewhere.  You may find it surprising, but I actually care a great deal about cooking delicious food. When I had a market nearby you could often find me looking for the new types of fish and meat and other things to try interesting and new recipes on. Marinading salmon collars, braising then toasting unagi, stewing beef bones for ramen and stuffing galontine chicken with many things. I can't handle getting creative for every meal though, so super drink allows me to... not."
soylent,3avuou,koffiezet,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:48:53 2015 UTC,"I started soylent (DIY) in December.  I also starting lifting hard in December.  I drink soylent for about 80% of my nutrients (that is, most days are 100% soylent, but weekend might have some non-soylent meals out).  Over these 6-7 months, I've been extremely strict (by this I mean, sticking to my workout schedule, and not ""cheating"" on my soylent - but by no means does this imply it was hard, soylent has actually been quite easy).  In a about a month, I'm going to post progress pics, (I'm not sure if it's welcome in this sub, but in others), but the results have been very good.  First, DIY soylent makes calorie and macro tracking a breeze.  Really so simple. Essentially, you don't even have to do it, besides the first time, and occasional adjustments as your body changes.  I first starting bulking with soylent (actually, a ""dreamer bulk"" -- my fitness knowledge wasn't as good and I way overshot my calories), and went from 70kg skinny guy with respectable beer belly to 90kg fat guy but with muscles over about 3 months (probably somewhere between 20 and 25% body fat at this point).  Then I adjusted my recipe down to a caloric deficit.  I'm 78kg now, and probably 10 - 12% bodyfat (I don't have a BF calculator, just estimating using photos).  Now 78kg is not ""big"" by lifting standards, but generally speaking, I'm the most ""in shape"" guy in the room.  I estimate that in around 2 - 4 more weeks, I'll be at my target body fat (hence why i'm waiting for progress photos), and at that point I'll adjust the recipe again to be just above maintenance calories, and attempt lean-gains from that point on.  Anyway, if you are considering it, then I suggest you dive and give it a shot.  For me, at least, it has been an awesome experience  EDIT:  I'm 6'2"" (188cm)"

The first time trying Joylent I had a hard time swallowing it, something I never had with Queal.  My take on it:   Joylent:   is consumable directly after prepping more convenient (no oil) can take a shaker with only the powder with me, and just in case - add water.  Queal:   has to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, otherwise very gritty, but when able to do this it has a much nicer texture imho less convenient (adding oil) for when I have time to prep beforehand/can plan my meals    Neither are bad, but Joylent took more getting used to than Queal although the latter was my first 'soylent' like food I tried. I do blend my Queal not most of the time (together with some fruit).

It is a colorless solid that is soluble in organic solvents, but poorly soluble in water. It has been in commercial use since 1957.  BPA is employed to make certain plastics and epoxy resins. BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made into a variety of common consumer goods, such as water bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. Epoxy resins containing BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans and in making thermal paper such as that used in sales receipts.  BPA exhibits hormone-like properties that raise concern about its suitability in some consumer products and food containers. Since 2008, several governments have investigated its safety, which prompted some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. The FDA has ended its authorization of the use of BPA in baby bottles and infant formula packaging, based on market abandonment, not safety.  The European Union and Canada have banned BPA use in baby bottles.

Also called ""dietary estrogens"", they are a diverse group of naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of their structural similarity with estradiol (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause estrogenic or/and antiestrogenic effects,  by sitting in and blocking receptor sites against estrogen.   Their name comes from the Greek phyto (""plant"") and estrogen, the hormone which gives fertility to female mammals. The word ""estrus"" - Greek οίστρος - means ""sexual desire"", and ""gene"" - Greek γόνο - is ""to generate"". It has been proposed that plants use phytoestrogens as part of their natural defence against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling male fertility.    The similarities, at molecular level, of estrogens and phytoestrogens allow them to mildly mimic and sometimes act as antagonists of estrogen.  Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926,   but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism. In the 1940s, it was noticed for the first time that red clover (a plant which is rich in the phytoestrogen coumestrol ) pastures had effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep.   Researchers are exploring the nutritional role of these substances in the regulation of cholesterol and the maintenance of proper bone density post-menopause. Evidence is accruing that phytoestrogens may have protective action against diverse health disorders, such as prostate, breast, bowel, and other cancers, cardiovascular disease, brain function disorders and osteoporosis,        Image i - Chemical structures of the most common phytoestrogens found in plants (top and middle) compared with estrogen (bottom) found in animals.

These estrogen-like effects have raised concern regarding soy/isoflavone consumption, particularly in the case of postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. Currently there is little evidence to suggest that any potential weak estrogenic effects of dietary isoflavones have a clinically relevant impact on breast tissue in healthy women. Limited data suggest this is also the case for breast cancer survivors. This evidence includes multiple trials showing no effects on breast proliferation or mammographic density and considerable epidemiologic data showing either no effect or a modest protective role of soy/isoflavone intake on breast cancer risk. Tangential support for this idea is also provided by recent clinical trial findings regarding exogenous ET (in the form of CEE) showing a marginal decrease in risk of invasive breast cancer. Based on this evidence it seems unlikely that isoflavone consumption at dietary levels (i.e. <100 mg/day) elicits adverse breast cancer-promoting effects in healthy women or breast cancer survivors not undergoing active treatment. Findings from one rodent study showed that genistein may interfere with concurrent tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that breast cancer patients taking a SERM may need to limit soyfood intake and avoid isoflavone supplements. Currently there are no data to support the idea that soyfoods or isoflavone supplements improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients.     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9865428   The conclusion in this abstract: Compared with the control diet, increased isoflavone consumption decreased urinary excretion of estradiol, estrone, estriol, and total estrogens, as well as excretion of the hypothesized genotoxic estrogen metabolites, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestrone, and 4-hydroxyestradiol. Of importance are the observations of a significant increase in the 2-hydroxyestrone/16alpha-hydroxyestrone ratio and a decrease in the genotoxic/total estrogens ratio. These data suggest that soy isoflavone consumption may exert cancer-preventive effects by decreasing estrogen synthesis and altering metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogens   The Wiki article discussed phytoestrogen effects in men and concludes:  A 2010 meta-analysis of fifteen placebo-controlled studies said that ""neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in men."" Furthermore, isoflavone supplementation has no effect on sperm concentration, count or motility, and it leads to no observable changes in testicular or ejaculate volume."

soylent,3ayqwj,ketolent,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure whether the estrogenic properties of soy actually have any tangible impacts on hormones for men. But vegetable oil (corn, canola, soybean) tend to be the more processed oils. I would look into coconut extract (MCT) and extra virgin organic olive oil."
soylent,3awmus,roilorcas,4,Wed Jun 24 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"None. I used to eat out every day at cheap restaurants (cheap sushi, noodles, cheap Indian takeout, greasy pizza buy the slice). I used to get a lot of calories from tea with about three pounds of milk powder dissolved in it. I don't save any money eating Soylent, but my diet is way healthier, and I feel better. Not starving between meals, not satiated after eating.  And since I have to pay to have Soylent shipped to me, it seals the deal that Soylent is more expensive than my previous eating habits. It's still worth it."
soylent,3awmus,sleepycorn,2,Wed Jun 24 12:49:25 2015 UTC,I used to eat out pretty much every day so I save about $5 per day using Soylent.
soylent,3awmus,elitesense,2,Wed Jun 24 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"Somewhere between €5 and €10 per day depending on whether it's a work day or not.  On a monthly basis, I'd say somewhere around €250."
soylent,3awmus,dalebewan,2,Wed Jun 24 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"how much money have you saved by drinking soylent instead of buying ""real food""?   Soylent costs me EXTRA."
soylent,3awmus,ryanmercer,2,Wed Jun 24 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im wanting to start, but it's going to cost me... If it were cheaper, this would have been a 100% yes a while ago."
soylent,3awmus,Accalon-0,2,Sat Jun 27 04:38:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I wish it was more 5-7$ for 2000 kcals. Hopefully it gets there someday. The creator was asked about the cost in his AMA last week but didn't give a time frame for reducing the price.
soylent,3awmus,ryanmercer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sure it's not easy.  I would actually imagine the protein is the hardest part to balance out cost-benefit wise.  It's definitely more expensive for me because I eat so little/so dirt cheaply most of the time, but it'll be so much better for me that I think it's worth it."
soylent,3awmus,Accalon-0,2,Sat Jun 27 05:10:31 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm betting they could drop it 2-3$ a serving and still make a worthwhile profit if they weren't still rapidly expanding. I bet they could drop it 3-4$ a serving if they stopped working on the formula and pursuing other product lines (he mentions solids in there).   I bet once European countries start to come online I'm hoping we start to see a price drop, because by then they'll still be growing but likely at a slower rate than they are now. With just 8% of the North American countries  (U.S. and Canad) able to purchase right now they are still seeing considerable numbers of new customers weekly I imagine, I bet that will continue for the rest of the year before slowing down on growth until they get to distributing in Europe. Once growth starts slowing, hopefully they can stop having to pour so much of the profits into expanding and can pass some of it on to us as lower prices."
soylent,3awmus,ryanmercer,2,Sat Jun 27 05:15:26 2015 UTC,These might not be good data points since people are using it for only a couple meals a week to 100% Soylent. So this isn't a consistent group.

soylent,3awmus,ZiggyZoomber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:00:36 2015 UTC,$10 per work day from not eating out
soylent,3awmus,Subvers1on,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:11:38 2015 UTC,I only eat soylent for breakfast and lunch on weekdays. An average day was $8-$12 for food and snacks. Soylent cost me around $6 a day. So I figure I'm savings around $5 a day or roughly $100 a month.
soylent,3awmus,jd_edc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:12:56 2015 UTC,"I've saved at least $10 a day, as I would eat out a lot.  Additionally, when I would cook, it would not be as cheap."
soylent,3awmus,Blaqs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Not that much, averaged out. While I definitely save $5-10 a day on crap fast/fast-casual food that I would otherwise be eating, I find that when I do spend money on food I buy really good (commensurately expensive) food, be that in groceries or out at restaurants.     For example, because I didn't spend $100 on junk last week, I had no problem mentally/financially justifying the $25/lb prime dry-aged ribeyes I made Saturday night. With Soylent, my diet is much better nutritionally, and my food-meals are of a much better quality. That's a net gain in my book."
soylent,3awmus,Rbrow89,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:18:09 2015 UTC,like 5-10 EUR a day. Quite a compulsive overeater. Since Soylent that doesn't happen anymore.
soylent,3awmus,eNomineZerum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Probably lose money on the weekends but I save about 5$ on work days.
soylent,3awmus,tupper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:19:39 2015 UTC,You can look at it from a math standpoint. For a regular 7 day it costs $85. That is seven 2000 calorie bags. $85/7=$12 per day.  If you subscribe and get the 28 day box for $255 it comes out to $9 a day.  I mainly use Soylent for convenience but for a long time I would cook up large batches of rice and chicken or lentil soups for CHEAP.  I could spend roughly $50 on food that would last an entire week consuming far more than 2000 calories a day.   I spend slightly more consuming a majority Soylent but I would like to think it is better than my typical Rice and baked chicken breast.

soylent,3aux0n,6ThreeSided9,4,Tue Jun 23 21:44:48 2015 UTC,I think the point of soylent is to get proper nutrition quickly and effectively at a decent price. Not as a full food replacement.

I didn't drink as much water as I should have on my regular food diet, so I figured a soylent diet would be even worse in that regard.  To just make it a habit instead of waiting till I am thirsty, I drink a glass of water (16 fl oz, I believe) with my soylent meals, maybe another glass or 2 in the evenings."

I know I did."
soylent,3athge,NowWeAreAllTom,8,Tue Jun 23 12:48:57 2015 UTC,Same for me. It's still weird to be technically full yet also still feeling like I should eat something.

I find it works best if I sip slowly while I'm otherwise distracted (like while playing video games), otherwise just sitting at the table drinking the shake is kind of weird, since my focus is on eating, but I'm not chewing and my stomach isn't getting full the same way it does with muggle food."

You might not notice it in a single serving, but I'm all Soylent, and I definitely noticed it in the afternoon. Needs to be rectified in 1.6. Still too much fat in 1.5, and there needs to be more fiber and protein, not less."

I started with my friend's small stock of 1.1 she never used, and when I got my own box of 1.5 I suddenly started feeling hungry again even right after drinking it... But throwing in a couple slices of bread each day puts me too far over my calorie goal because the Soylent alone is 2000 calories already... If they either bumped a day's worth of Soylent back to 1600 calories or increased the fiber and protein to what they were I'd worry about gaining weight from it a lot less."

But if you're taking sips of water between bites, there shouldn't be a problem, as your stomach should do a pretty good job of breaking it apart.  But if you're thinking about eating the powder with absolutely no water, there might be problems. ""Normal"" food has a lot of water in it, and the water you add to soylent is kinda equivalent to the water you'd get from eating normal food. You'd definitely want the water to help the enzymes in your stomach and gut break down the carbs, proteins, and fats. Then absorbing stuff in your intestines has a lot to do with absorbing water and carrying stuff with it, in several different ways. The body does introduce fluids to the stuff you're digesting, but that's quite a lot of water you'd be demanding."

I'm fairly big on the idea that advancements in technology like this are going to absolutely pave the way to the future so, for me, I was on board immediately. An actual technical and scientific approach to eating? Yes please! That is what made me buy into it.  Quality of life hasn't changed much, I don't think. I guess I don't go to the grocery store as often at all anymore but, that's about it.

I came back later and saw that shipping times were still bad, but my interest had grown, so I decided to try one of the other providers (PowderChow).  Small order in case it wasn't filling, I didn't like the taste, etc.  Buying plastig bags of ""powder"" from some stranger on the internet?  What's the worst that could happen!  No complaints, really enjoyed it, and have continued to use it.  (Packaging has since become more official-looking, much like official Soylent).  Once Soylent got their shipping issues straightened out, I tried them as well since it's the official brand of sorts.  Again, a small first order just in case.  No complaints, and I now switch between Soylent and Powder Chow.  It's filling, I like the taste, easy to prepare, cheap, ships quickly, and replaces a lot of my previously bad fastfood meals with a healthy alternative.  If anyone asks me what's with the drinks, I usually just tell them it's a protein shake."

Soylent powder was something new with the closest competition being an Ensure drink. The ""energy bar"" market is loaded with competitors from cereal bars, protein bars to balance bars. I'm not confident that Joylent can do in a few months what all these other companies have not in decades."
soylent,3amy09,zhdetfawsc,2,Mon Jun 22 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"I really disliked the Joylent shakes, and unfortunately have a ton of powder sat going to waste in my kitchen. I don't like the taste or texture, and I can't drink much before I'm just revolted by it.  The reason I have so much is that initially I thought I'd be fine with it, so me and a friend paid for 30 days worth together and split the cost and Joylent, and neither of us ended up liking it.  But 5 joylent bars a day would be kind of perfect for me. Simple, bite-size nutrition would be amazing. Even if I don't particularly like the bars, it'd be easier for me to eat a bar than to drink a shake."
soylent,3amy09,06johansenad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:18:20 2015 UTC,"The texture of Joylent certainly is a bit weird (a bit slimy) - certainly compared to Queal. I initially also had a hard time gulping it down, but I got used to the texture rather quickly.   Still prefer Queal, but Joylent is more convenient. No oil to add, and the texture stays more or less the same, whether you consume it immediately or leave it in the fridge for a few hours. It's also easiers to clean. I usually have a shaker with only Joylent powder with me, so I just have to add cold water and have a meal. Just wish it was a bit less slimy, though that's probably because you don't need to add oil.  Queal is for when I can plan my meals and have some time to prepare them. Having to add the oil is not really convenient, and the texture is too coarse immediately after preparing. I usually make it with lukewarm water and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Sometimes I add fruit and blend it - but haven't tried that yet with Joylent."
soylent,3amy09,koffiezet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:22:53 2015 UTC,"For me I think the bars would be more convenient. The texture is tolerable for a little while, but when you make the shake it tends to be a fairly big shake, and I think I'd prefer tackling a small bar rather than a big drink."
soylent,3amy09,06johansenad,2,Tue Jun 23 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"The bars would indeed be more convenient, certainly for 'on the go' - but I rather like it in shake form, it also makes sure I drink enough water (which has been a problem for me in the past).

I don't drink the whole thing at one, I spread it over like 20-30 minutes. I don't get hungry for 3-4 hours, but when the hunger comes, it's relentless. That's just my experience.

I haven't tried longer than that, but I haven't felt the need to. It's really nice, like an oatmeal-vanilla milkshake.  Replacing just one meal a day should be fine, in terms of how your stomach will handle it. But drinking slowly is a good idea anyway."

Wouldn't make a lot of sense would it?   Now with regard to why so much protein. It's because there's a lot of different information to be found about what is right. As far as I have done my reading, the recent developments tend towards higher amounts of protein, equal amounts of fat and lower amounts of carbs. However, not being an expert in the field makes it very hard to really digg into it.  The internet is a great place to find information, but studies are often pulled out of context and wrongly interpreted. Still, as soon as someone discovers something they like, and write about it, there will be thousands of articles repeating the words.  But that's not the root of the problem. The root lies within the research field itself. Why? Because consensus is not quickly reached in a research field so vast as food science:   First, studies have to show a certain different outcome. However, the outcome of a study has to be reproducable and thus reproduced multiple times. Furthermore, a single study is no study. Then even if multiple studies show that something should be changed, older studies that show otherwise have to be disproven.  These older studies are often done by people who are respected in their field and have a big influence. That is to say, if they are not doing them thereselves in the first place.  Even if concensus is reached about a certain subject, it will take a lot of time more before the committees give their advice and guidelines will be changed.  TL;DR: It's very hard to tell what's right, but they might all have their reasons. I suggest asking them and see what answers you like best?"

Here's a  good meta-analysis of the studies on this topic: http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/  The current 'high protein' marketing trend is undeniable, just as 'low fat' was in the 90s. In the past year, I've even seen sweet breakfast cereals and cookies marketed as 'high protein'. These developments are buzzword-led, rather than science-led.  Rosa Labs initially followed this trend, then retreated once they (having the largest customer data set of any soylent producer) noticed the unecessary digestive distress (gas, namely) caused by excess protein."

Honestly I think it's because Rosa Labs is run by a bunch of guys under 25 who can eat anything and stay skinny. Rob's express goal is to make the consistency smooth and the product easy to digest (meaning - minimize gas - not easy to poop, or reduce risk of colon cancer). I've had to cut back my soylent to a once-a-day breakfast substitute because 1.4 was making me fat and I was waking up sore the next day.  You have to remember that Soylent was invented by a young guy who wanted to minimize time eating and spend more time programming. It was not invented by a middle-aged guy who spends an hour a day on a bicycle and an hour or two in the weightroom.  The original Soylent macronutrient breakdown was 50/30/20 (carb/fat/protein), which wasn't that big from a protein standpoint but it was fine for a casual athlete. Actual bodybuilders (I just checked Schwarzenegger's encyclopedia of bodybuilding) will eat 40/40/20 (protein, carb, fat)."

I can't imagine any reason for intestinal degradation from a 100% soylent diet.

soylent,3ancga,IN2L,2,Mon Jun 22 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"A few extra things I forgot to mention yesterday.  Joylent has an easier pricing structure that I prefer, you just buy it when you need a new box.  Queal is more complex, you have the buy when needed, subscription and premium subscription. You need to get the subscription to get close to the price of joylent (queal adds shipping costs while joylent was free shipping). A subscription for me would mean cancelling after 2 months for a month because I only use about 20 meals a month. Which is a extra hassle. There's the premium option aswell and it's not really clear to me what you'll get extra every month and if it's worth it.  Queal did have very good follow up. Sending me a survey a few weeks later asking me about my opinion and if I had any suggestions.  I liked the Joylent shaker more then the Queal one, the queal text on it is very boring. It seems they have new shakers now with the logo (which I like a lot) integrated on the shaker aswell which does look better, but I still feel the queal font isn't very interesting. I probably hang out with the graphic designers at work too much if I start complaining about fonts in logo's."

soylent,3ancga,condsant,2,Mon Jun 22 09:26:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. Queal is more coarse than joylent? thats interesting.  Im currently using joylent and i am going to try queal next. Did you try all queal flavors? how did the different queal flavors stack up? give em a quick ranking please :)  I would say that the joylent vanilla taste is my least favorite. Toss-up between banana and strawberry in the top and the chocolate isnt bad either. I felt like vanilla was a bit too sweet and gave me a salt craving. How is the sweetnes level on the queal flavors?
soylent,3ancga,underkuerbis,2,Mon Jun 22 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"I've tried most flavors. The only one I haven't tried yet is Forest fruit but I'll try that one tomorrow. This is my order of preference.  Awesome Apple Pie Crazy Chocolate Peanut Super Strawberry/Smooth Vanilla Banana Mania Cool Chocolate  Awesome apple pie really is awesome. The other ones are pretty close together in how I'd rank them, Chocolate peanut a bit higher. Banana was suprisingly good since I normally don't like banana. that's why I rank it a bit lower then strawberry but it's actually really good if you're someone who likes eating banana.  For some reason I didn't like the Chocolate one as much as the others, can't really explain why.  Overal the flavors aren't really dominant, it's a very subtle flavor but it does add this little extra that keeps it interesting to drink them every day. The same flavor every day would get boring fast for me. They all taste pretty oaty but with a subtle extra aroma.  I specifically waited with my post till after I had tried the vanilla version of Queal to get a somewhat fair comparison since I only had Vanilla joylent. I also saved a bag of Joylent to be able to taste em both at the same time. I have to say I was suprised at how different they taste. Didn't expect that before I ordered I figured they'd be pretty much copies of eachother but the taste and texture is very different."

When I am trying to gain weight I go out of my way to have an early meal around 7am so that I will consistently be hungry throughout the day and can get enough in to gain.

It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. It is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and thus closely related chemically to the adenine and guanine contained in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia. The most well known source of caffeine is the seed (commonly incorrectly referred to as the ""bean"") of Coffea plants. Beverages containing caffeine are ingested to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to increase one's energy level. Caffeine is extracted from the plant part containing it for making beverages by steeping it in water, a process called infusion. These beverages are very popular: in North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.

If I make individual servings, I have to time it well enough in advance to give it time in the fridge for the grittiness to subside and become cool enough to drink (without feeling like you're chugging warm yeast). Plus, if you don't clean that pitcher or blender bottle right away, it becomes a pain in the ass to do it later.   Solid soylent bars would be a huge improvement for my lifestyle and consumption habits - grab an individually packaged soylent bar and a liter of water to wash it down and i'm set.

soylent,3aj1pp,buttpianist,2,Sat Jun 20 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"Chew gum.  Ignoring the circular non argument below - your back teeth do in fact push out of the gums an very tiny amount at all times.  This is your body's way of countering the push into the gums of chewing.  The bone of the jaw is spongey- like a pumice stone almost.  This is why if you are missing a molar, the opposite molar will slowly over the years move out of the gumline a bit.    Yes, elderly people sometimes loose teeth this way.  Not often, but it happens.  tl:dr chewing gum will give your teeth a workout if you are 100% liquid."
soylent,3aj1pp,aesamattki,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"None of that really sounds right. You jaw bone is hard. This explains how and why teeth move. When you're missing a tooth, that tooth will tend to have force exerted on it towards the empty space in your jawbone so when you chew the ligament will be compressed, stimulating osteoclasts to destroy bone and relieve the pressure. On the other side of your tooth, the ligament will be stretched, stimulating osteoblasts to fill in new bone.  I've never heard of teeth being naturally pushed out of the gum line. A good reason to chew sugarfree gum for dental health is gum is sticky and helps remove plaque and food particles stuck to your teeth and gums. Chewing also stimulates saliva which helps your mouth break down plaque. I don't think chewing is necessary to ""push your teeth into your gums"". That sounds like nonsense."
soylent,3aj1pp,buttpianist,4,Thu Jul 9 23:18:16 2015 UTC,Entirely unfounded. Your teeth don't care about chewing or not chewing.

soylent,3aiueh,Aelcyx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"It tastes like potatoey to me, which is a bit weird because, while 1.5 increased potato starch, potato starch is flavorless.    The texture is also gluey-er the way I prepare it.  I mix each serving separately and drink it shortly after.  1.4 became very slimey due to it's xanthan gum content, but it took time for the xanthan gum to dissolve, so the texture was more fluid if you drank it shortly after preparing.  1.5 contains a different emulsifiers that dissolve and thicken faster, making 1.5 slimier for me.  I wonder if there is some concern over the rice starch/potato starch substitution.  Rice starch was reduced by about half due to supplier constraints.  Is potato starch an acceptable 1-for-1 substitute?  How do supplier constraints like this affect RosaLab's abilities to deliver a continuous supply of Soylent over time?"

soylent,3aib82,healthyactionjc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:41:13 2015 UTC,"Hi - Huel is not intended for bodybuilders.  Huel is certainly high protein, but nothing like the amounts bodybuilders aspire too (rightly or wrongly).  The reason for the relatively high protein is simply down to ratios; ie we wanted to keep Huel moderate carbs and not excessively fat.  So, in order to reach desired calories, we used vegan protein sources."

soylent,3aib82,BrugeHiplo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"Why Huel is High Protein  The RNI for protein is around 50g per day, but this only covers our very basic needs and prevents protein deficiency. The Western diet typically provides more, and Huel does too. All essential amino acids are included in adequate amounts from two vegan protein sources: pea and rice protein, as well as protein from the oat powder. Based on an average of 2,000 calorie intake, you’ll be consuming 150g protein per day from Huel: this provides a good amount for a healthy immune system as well as building and maintaining a healthy body. Furthermore, protein is more satiating (appetite suppressing) than other macronutrients and we've designed Huel to stop unwanted hunger pangs."
soylent,3aib82,healthyactionjc,3,Sat Jun 20 14:53:41 2015 UTC,"150g per 2000kcal is waaaay beyond ""high Protein"". 100g would be high Protein, for a 80kg person. Anything beyond 1.2g per Kg bodyweight is just insane."

soylent,3afdfp,Charlton_Question,30,Fri Jun 19 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"Hi Rob,  First, let me say 'thank you' for helping to kickstart an entirely new industry.  I love the idea of getting people interested in food science and expanding what we can do with technology today.  Second, I just have a few questions and ideas about formulations of Soylent now and in the future.   Have you looked into antioxidants and how they could potentially be incorporated into Soylent in future versions?  There seems to be promising research showing health benefits from high-antioxidant foods such as cocoa, tea, and spices like cinnamon and turmeric.  An entirely Soylent diet currently eschews these beneficial nutrients.  Is Rosa Labs actively researching ways to make Soylent more beneficial to the body (and not just simply hitting the RDA for everything)? There has been recent research indicating that the RDA values for certain nutrients may be too low, either due to lower absorption rates than previously thought, or due to the changing lifestyles of Americans.  Two nutrients that come to mind are vitamins D and B12.  With recent research indicating that 400 IU and 2.4 mcg might be too low of doses to maintain healthy levels in many individuals, and with these vitamins being relatively cheap to fortify with, do you see Rosa Labs increasing the amounts of certain vitamins in response to newer research? This isn't so much of a question but a comment.  I know Rosa Labs has been putting a lot of focus on expanding into new markets (hello, Canada!), but can you say if there are any plans in the works for multiple formulations of Soylent?  Perhaps a low-calorie option, a 'sport' option with increased protein, a lower carb version, etc.  I know this is on the wish-list for many people right now, including myself.   Anyway, thanks again for the work you are doing and thank you for doing an AMA.  Good luck with your future endeavors!"
soylent,3afdfp,dreiter,41,Fri Jun 19 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"Research on antioxidants is all over the place. The mechanism makes sense but in biology things are never as simple as you'd like them to be. I have yet to see really compelling research on any one antioxidant being effective. I love the theory though. Maybe we can make a synthetic antioxidant that 10x more effective than anything naturally occurring and it will be worthwhile. Soylent already includes vitamins e and c which are antioxidants. The FDA is updating some of its DVs in the next 2 years as part of their nutrition label overhaul and we are following the new recommendations. We have always erred on the side of safety with our vitamin levels. They are pretty cheap and have high TUL (tolerable upper limits) so more doesn't hurt. Our label lists a minimum level at which the nutrients are to be found at after our shelf life, which is 2 years. This means that in a fresh pouch of soylent the actual vitamin levels are higher than what is on the label. Maybe, not likely. We will certainly have multiple products but many variations on nutrition seems unnecessary. If you want fewer calories you can just drink less. If you need more protein (unlikely unless you are literally a bodybuilder) you can add your own. We can only maximize efficiency by paring down our product list. I would only want to offer different nutrition profiles if we could do so in a truly bespoke manner. It would be cool if you could design a diet specifically for you but for now we have something that should work well for pretty much anyone.   Side note: according to the WHO you can sustain lean mass with 8% of total energy coming from protein. Protein is popular right now but most people really don't need that much. Protein can also be more inflammatory to digest than other energy sources like fat and carbs.  Side note 2: carbs are unpopular right now but I think that's mostly sucrose getting a deserved bad rap. Not all carbs are bad. Low GI carbs in moderation are and pretty much always have been part of a healthy diet"
soylent,3afdfp,dreiter,11,Fri Jun 19 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that individual antioxidant supplements are generally worthless, but high-antioxidant foods could be added to Soylent to increase the values of these nutrient.

A quick internet search yielded many studies that show that an increased protein intake increases the preservation of lean body mass while in a caloric deficit. (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2007.531/pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213385/  etc). Especially since many users use Soylent for weight loss, typically consuming 1500 calories or so, and thus about 60 grams of protein a day. This is significantly lower than the recommended intake to spare lean body mass in the inactive obese, while non-obese, at least somewhat active people would require even more (http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/protein-intake-while-dieting-qa.html/). This isn't event mentioning that protein is the most satiating macronutrient.  As far as the WHO study goes, since the TDEE of at least half your customers (men) is above 2000, Soylent would not spare lean muscle mass for a large number of people.  As an end consumer I remain unconvinced that that lack of protein isn't just a cost-cutting measure."

First off, thanks for kickstarting this whole movement and for all the work you and your team have done in trying to change people’s perceptions of food.  Q: For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in a first world country, do you think it makes sense to design our nutrition in order to optimize cost of ingredients versus quality?

With food I see cost especially as something that needs to be lowered because   it is a proxy for the resources and labor that went in to the product, which I seek to minimize I want soylent to be globally accessible, and thus it must be at a price point that is achievable by all, while sustaining our growing business.

But still, the product my stomach gurgle uncomfortably. It leave me bloated. This doesn't happen with any other food. My body just doesn't digest Soylent well. I will usually drink 12 oz after the gym when my body seems to digest things better.   I wish I could drink this stuff for 90% of my meals like you. I really do.   You know the product better than anyone. I've tried posting to the forums, sipping smaller amounts, drinking less, eating digestive enzymes beforehand, consuming it warm instead of cold.

It is important to me that we can provide the same level of service i.e. same shipping times and price so we will not release until we are confident we can deliver consistently.

However, things have changed.  Food labeling is pretty confusing and more relevant to traditional foods. They won't even let us put Choline or Omega-3 levels on the label. And many important factors are left out such as carb GI and amino acid ratio. We have more designers now so yes I'd love to work on this."

We've reached huge company milestones in only a year: product improvements, real time fulfillment, international expansion, but I am personally disappointed that we have not yet lowered the price.  I see price reductions as a primary goal, but demand is really strong right now and we can use the money to invest more in R&D. Still, I don't see what we want to do on the research side as being crazy expensive and I would like to pass on our cost savings to customers sooner rather than later."

soylent,3afdfp,amfarrell,69,Fri Jun 19 18:05:08 2015 UTC,The vision in terms of availability is convenience and ubiquity with minimal impact.  Traditional retail is horribly inefficient and inconvenient. The energy they waste on refrigeration alone is unconscionable. And putting warehouses and parking lots in the middle of cities? What a waste.  It is a better experience to press a button on your phone and have Soylent delivered in minutes. Or we may have futuristic milkmen drop off the day's supply early in the morning. Or drone delivery. But what I'm most excited about is putting railguns on skyscraper rooftops worldwide and shooting products straight in to people's hands.

soylent,3afdfp,mangomania42,24,Fri Jun 19 18:08:15 2015 UTC,I think Soylent will be a critical part of eliminating food insecurity. It's an engineering problem to me. If we simply manufactured more nutrition and distributed it wide enough the problem would be solved. I also think we can find ways to synthesize food on site.   However I do not mean to make the problem sound straightforward. Better roads in Africa would likely do more than lowering our price. We hope to collaborate with others tackling complementary development problems. I remain excited about this path but it will take a while.

Food is one of these, but if you want to serve cash-strapped undergrads, finding a way to get in that system is a good idea.

Sorry for the 2 week old reply but I just saw this thread. One of my favorite parts of Soylent is the occasion where some clumps get stuck to the top of the pitcher because I didn't shake it well enough. These are pretty much Soylent powder with just enough water to make them the consistency of.... peanut butter. So, if you could just compact regular Soylent into a protein bar form, I'd be happy with it.  In fact, I think I might try making my own ""Soylent butter"" now that I put the idea in my own head."

It's also a little more difficult to pack food for the full days out of the house, and packing/cleaning two or three thermoses every day is a PITA.   Making it every night got easier when I got a 72-ounce blender, so that annoyance went away.  Oh, another positive -- you spend less money on alcohol."

soylent,3ai1ol,Im_Excellent,3,Tue Jun 23 02:47:12 2015 UTC,So I use a ketogenic soylent so I can't really speak to traditional formulas but the biggest benefits for me is saving time and money while meeting my health goals. I am in the best shape of my life AND putting less time and resources into diet and nutrition because soylent is so efficient. I'm basically absorbing all the benefits of having well thought out nutritious meals without doing any work to prepare them.  In the world of efficiency less is more and soylent takes less time and money while meeting all my needs.

It's all been about convenience for me, and convenience alone. If you're eating as you should, I don't think there's a considerable change, if any at all. No benefit, but importantly, no real drawbacks. I dislike the taste and as such down my meals in one go. This causes a little discomfort. Besides that Joylent has served me just as well as real food.  (I eat 1-2 ""real"" meals a week and have a small snack every day (usually some kind of meat or cheese) other than that, all Joylent)"

soylent,3ahzqg,not-spiderpig,2,Sun Jun 21 22:02:14 2015 UTC,I would suggest vanilla extract. I use about a table spoon every time. Also you could try bananas which a lot of stores have super cheap
soylent,3ahzqg,snugy_wumpkins,2,Sat Jun 20 12:13:40 2015 UTC,Candy flavorings from either flavor west or lorann oils. Find a flavor you know you like - I recommend marshmallow- and buy a big bottle of it. It ends up significantly cheaper than vanilla extract because they're concentrated flavors.

A few early reactions to this:   No flavoring. A lot of people probably like this, but I'd prefer to see more already flavored products on the market. I'm lazy and after trying Soylent I'm skeptical to ""neutral flavors"". That bottle looks like BlenderBottle's SportMixer, which is very good looking and seems like a very solid build. I have two of them and they're really nice except for one tiny design flaw for consuming soylent. If you open it, drink and then close it again, there seems to always be tiny bits of soylent on the cap that quickly dries ""sealing"" the cap in place making it hard to impossible to open. This seems to happen all the time on these bottles, but never with the design that Joylent uses. Maybe I'm just weak, but I'm not a fan of this bottle. I really like the huge savings bundle they got going. Two thumbs up for that.   I'm probably going to hold off on this one for now, until they make a flavored version, but it looks pretty nice for what it is even if it's not for me in it's current form."

For Joylent, 350-375ml of powder are roughly a third of a bag. Just fill the shaker up to the 350ml mark and see how much you've got left for the third meal. It's been a while since I measured exactly since I only use 250ml to lose weight, I'm not 100% sure. Also, the density might have changed a bit with the changed recipe (the gluten free oats)."

I thought that (almost) the whole point of Soylent was to spend less time preparing food?   It takes about thirty seconds to mix flavoring (cocoa powder, powdered peanut butter, etc) into a meal.

Are they both going to taste like crap compared to heavy cream?  Is heavy whipping cream the same as heavy cream? I haven't been able to to find heavy cream in a store so far. Heavy whipping cream on the other hand is easy to find, but I'm not sure if it matters what kind it is. Also don't know if you're supposed to use the same amount of heavy whipping cream as heavy cream on the Keto Chow page.  A lot of large grocery store chains deliver today but they have a minimum amount they want you to spent. I could buy from a regular store, but I still find Amazon to be easier to get things from :)"
soylent,3ac1lr,JohnnyRockets911,3,Thu Jun 18 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"You could simply mix with less water, or more powder to thicken it up.  Also, the point of soylent is to be flavor-neutral... so that's a good thing that a lot of the taste is gone.  However, my 1.5 tastes like pancake batter to me, so, maybe we make different kinds of pancakes."
soylent,3ac1lr,NoDiggityNoDoubt,3,Thu Jun 18 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, pretty much liked 1.4 more, but 1.5 has really grown on me over the last week and I don't really notice the thin-ness anymore."

At the same time, I remember the legion of people (grown men) that cry every time the formulation is changed, can't swallow a sip, gag... I didn't want to let myself get depressed over some auto-suggestive temporary nonsense.  I waited few days to adapt, and that was it. Now I crave the taste of 1.5. Besides, a concoction like Soylent will never be flavor-neutral, and when you remove flavor additions, your taste senses will pick up the more nuanced base profile. Since high quality nutrients are coming from Soylent, I think anyone using it as major part of diet would eventually condition their brain to liking it."

soylent,3ac2c5,NoDiggityNoDoubt,0,Fri Jun 19 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"USDA recommends 400IU for 9-50yo.  Of course, various sites claim different amounts.  Being that Soylent is ""nutritionally complete,"" and that goes for Vitamin D, adding 2000IU (which is the upper limit dosage before toxicity kicks in), I'd be very careful consuming that much every day.  Your doctor probably meant 2000IU tablets, since only a small fraction is actually absorbed, which would put you in the 400IU range."
soylent,3ac2c5,DuzAwe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"Wrong. The Guide line is way off and toxicity is at 10,000+. http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/  The recommended daily allowance for Vitamin D is currently set at 400-800IU/day, but this is too low for adults. The safe upper limit in the United States is 2,000IU/day, while in Canada it is 4,000IU/day. Research suggests that the true safe upper limit is 10,000IU/day. For moderate supplementation, a 1,000-2,000IU dose of vitamin D3 is sufficient to meet the needs of most of the population. This is the lowest effective dose range. Higher doses, based on body weight, are in the range of 20-80IU/kg daily.  Vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol) is recommended over D2 supplementation (ergocalciferol), since D3 is used more effectively in the body."
soylent,3ac2c5,dreiter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:49:18 2015 UTC,"You are right until the last point.  Assuming you take a daily supplement, there is no difference between D2 and D3.   RESULTS: A meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that supplementation with vitamin D3 had a significant and positive effect in the raising of serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with the effect of vitamin D2 (P = 0.001). When the frequency of dosage administration was compared, there was a significant response for vitamin D3 when given as a bolus dose (P = 0.0002) compared with administration of vitamin D2, but the effect was lost with daily supplementation."

soylent,3absmj,kisschicken,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:00:46 2015 UTC,Are you trying to gain or is this a negative side effect for you?    I should note I do hit the gym 4-5 days out of the week and probably burn around 300-500 calories each session. (I lift then do cardio).

soylent,3aapis,syst3mfailur3,2,Thu Jun 18 15:56:57 2015 UTC,If you're lactose intolerant you can try substituting oil for the cream but Coconut milk has quite a lot of sugar and not enough fat. I did a real quick and dirty check to see what kind of numbers we're talking about (using the USDA values for 100g of coconut milk) https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/keto-chow-103-coconut-milk  You would need 320g of coconut milk to hit 1200 calories/day. Doing that you'll be really close to 25g of net carbs. To hit 2000 calories you would need 667g of coconut milk putting you around 45g of net carbs. Depending on your activity level that's likely too many for ketosis.
soylent,3aapis,chrisbair,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"Not lactose intolerant, more it would probably work out cheaper and less chance of spoilage when not refrigerated for a while. I was also planning on using either canola or vegetable oil to boost the fat content, as its cheap.  I got 2 test recipes with a ratio of 10/25/65 at 1500 calories, both of which hit 20 net carbs. https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/nurocket-keto https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/nurocket-keto2  I should note that the only reason why I lecithin is because its pretty much the only thing I can seem to find thats a good source of phosphorus in Canada, without spending way too much.

Before the integration of oil for most powdered foods (sort of making an assumption here), the oil was poured into the drink separately. It incorporates well, and although some oils CAN alter the taste significantly (which can be pretty nice actually, try peanut oil), they don't need to (sunflower, canola). In the end, it can mean not having to drink oil separately, which, to me, isn't that bad.  It should be stressed that care must be taken to watch the breakdown of your omega-3's, and that I'm not a dietician.

soylent,3acio7,Akraz,-4,Fri Jun 19 14:18:12 2015 UTC,"90+g sounds like 40% calories from fat as well. And how long were you on it? Soylent is supposed to be a long term dietary replacement I thought, not a fad diet and especially not to lose weight. i do plenty of reading, you should do less assuming from one headline lol I think high carb diets are the best long term.

People Chow is $7-$8/day)  Maybe start with Soylent as an easy way to see if you like drinking some of your meals... then try DIY after a couple weeks if you want to try something different?

I find the texture actually is a bit better, and according to the info on the labels of the whey protein, it didn't bring me really that high... Although since I started it months ago I do not recall the exact numbers, I looked at the time, accepted them, and then dismissed them. If there was a protein you wanted to try instead, you could experiment with mixing some into keto chow to cover the taste.

It adds both thickness and smoothness.  3) nutritional.  In gram terms it may be a small amount, but there is some evidence that the nutritional matrix it sets up is helpful for a) leveling the nutrient load (especially important with sugar) and b) slowing gastrict emptying (http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/42/4/597.full.pdf) so you get more fullness per calorie."
soylent,3a5jc7,Guv_Bubbs,8,Wed Jun 17 11:51:49 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the ""slimy"" descriptor. To me it's just smooth like a milkshake. And it has hardly any taste, maybe a slight nutty flavor, which is pretty good IMO. I think people are just too used to everything being loaded down with sugar.  If you can't get used to it by itself, try blending in a banana and maybe some peanut butter.  Or you could squirt some Mio in it. My dad does that for his and I tried it, it's really good that way. I just do one squirt and it's perfect. He does 5-6, which makes it taste overwhelmingly sweet to me, but he says he has to use that much to taste it at all.  I think if you just drink the Soylent straight for awhile your tastebuds will adjust and become more sensitive, and you won't need as much flavor anymore."
soylent,3a5jc7,shpongolian,3,Wed Jun 17 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the ""slimy"" descriptor.   I've always thought it had an oatmeal like consistency. Some people might describe oatmeal as slimy."

soylent,3a5jc7,ObeyMyBrain,13,Wed Jun 17 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"It's in your head. Seriously, you got it in your head how horrible and gross and disgusting and slimy it was from reading people saying such and you developed an aversion before even trying it.   It's not slimy, at all. It's like a slightly melted milk shake and the taste is quite neutral with only a slightly woody aftertaste."
soylent,3a5jc7,ryanmercer,6,Wed Jun 17 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"I would call it slimy, especially after seeing inch long threads of it still attached to the blender bottle after drinking a gulp. Note: I liked the texture and miss it in 1.5."

For the 'slimy' just pretend you bought a shake from your favorite place, drove home, got comfy and started drinking it and it's melted a bit.   Aside from that, I find the faster I drink it the less I notice anything about it. Don't have to chug but I'll take probably 4-5 ounce gulps. Also try not to smell it when you're pouring it from the pitcher, the smell/taste builds up and once it's poured/breathed a little it's much better (not unlike whiskey)."
soylent,3a5jc7,Isarian,-1,Wed Jun 17 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"wow, you've got 15 upvotes for this 100% wrong statement. it is absolutely slimy if you let it chill overnight in the fridge. threads of the soylent hang off the bottle and your mouth. it is like sitting in the dentist's chair.  workaround a) don't refrigerate overnight (e.g., blend with ice, which means making or buying ice and buying a countertop blender) or b) wipe your mouth off after every gulp, like the dental hygienist does."
soylent,3a5jc7,reunity,3,Thu Jun 18 05:40:07 2015 UTC,"As said elsewhere, leaving it overnight tends to make it a bit slimy. I mix and drink it the same day to avoid that.  It took me about 4-5 days to get used to the taste. Use the scoop and just make it one serving at a time once a day for a few days, at which point you'll probably acclimate."

soylent,3a5jc7,ABC_AlwaysBeCoding,3,Wed Jun 17 19:56:34 2015 UTC,One thing i found that really helped with 1.4 is to put a little bit of water in the bottom of your cup before you pour the soylent in. Maybe an inch or so of water will make it much more smooth and easy to swallow.  And like others are saying 1.5 is less slimy

soylent,3a5jc7,fn0000rd,5,Wed Jun 17 19:54:13 2015 UTC,I think you took up Soylent too fast. Try and ease into it by only doing one meal a day for two weeks and then two meals a day for another two weeks. This way your body can acclimate to it and you will also feel less dreadful since you don't have to eat it three times a day.

If you use one scoop Soylent and 2 scoops water, that will be 250 calories, and generally fills about one 12 ounce glass for me.  Some people have noted that settling can occur, and you may only get 7 or 7.5 scoops out of a bag (versus the expected 8 scooops), so it's recommended to use a food scale if you have one and if you are worried about being precise."
soylent,3a7mz9,dreiter,0,Wed Jun 17 21:37:53 2015 UTC,My confusion is that 1 scoop contains about 115 grams?  So I would expect that to be 500 calories since the Serving Nutritional Facts equate 115 grams of Soylent to 500 Calories.

I generally drank it with my nose closed, and the cocoa powder kept the aftertaste from being too rough.  Many people here have switched to a keto version when losing weight.

And is it still effective when used for only 1-2 meals a day, a few times per week? Is it effective for weight loss at all (when combined with exercise)? I like the idea of Soylent because I can substitute it for poor food choices during my workweek.   For me I'm just a replacing bad meals with good soylent meals and I've seen a slow bit of weight loss. Doing it like this is going into it for the long term and isn't a get the weight off fast gimmick but will be good for long term health.   I cant comment too much on the taste/texture because I've yet to have official soylent... A few tips nonetheless! Don't make your soylent meal about your soylent meal, try having your meal while doing other tasks so you're not entirely focused on it. If you're not already make sure you're refrigerating it for a few hours or overnight. Give it some time and you'll probably get more used to it and hopefully not notice things that are bothering you, I had to have a few meals of joylent before I was ok with it.

Keto Fuel and Keto Chow after both excellent.  I lost weight on both 'normal' soylent and keto, but the keto was much better for me in preserving lean tissue, so I've stuck with keto. I find it easier to adjust the calories as well since with official Soylent you get a 2k calorie bag instead of starting off with a base mix around 1000 or 1200 calories that you can adjust easily.   http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/ https://www.thebairs.net/product-category/ketochow/   Buying those mixes is what I do and is very convenient, but you can also make these mixes yourself with the formulas on the DIY site to help save cost if needed."

The sub has lots of different advice for improving taste. Peanut butter is a common one. But a word of caution, peanut butter can very quickly add a lot of calories so use it wisely!

Besides Soylent I will have coffee with milk, sometimes a boiled or broiled chicken breast with hot sauce, a serving of cottage cheese with black pepper, or a few shots of vodka.

One great feature is that if you tell it your daily deficiency, it will calculate how much activity you have to achieve your goal.

Oatmeal is good because it adds back in the oat flour that was reduced in 1.5 and adds that comfortable texture back in as well as a pleasant neutral taste. Simply add water to a little oatmeal in a bowl, stir, wait a few minutes and keep stirring and it will become very mushy and dissolved. Then add it to your soylent and blend it.  Condensed milk instead of peanut butter. It improves the flavor tremendously so much so you will anticipate and look forward to it. Add to soylent, blend it, and refrigerate. Very creamy and tasty. Probably better than any shake I've ever had.   The caloric extra from these flavors I consider worth it as it makes the experience much more pleasing, equally good to solid food."

soylent,3a3ah8,snugy_wumpkins,2,Tue Jun 16 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"""500 mL of Soylent"" isn't a very useful number. Dry powders can be compressed and fluffed, so measuring by volume isn't accurate. Prepared soylent can have any amount of water you desire (the soylent release notes give 2 different ratios of powder-by-volume to water (1:2 if prepared by scoop, about 2:5 if prepared a pitcher at a time).  I make 3 meals per bag and have 1-2 meals from soylent per day. I prepare 700mL meals using 153mg of powder (665 cal)."

soylent,3a2rj1,Zjackrum,3,Tue Jun 16 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I started out on soylent recently with a couple friends, and we chose people chow.  The masa harina is the biggest factor in the texture of this stuff.  We're making another batch by replacing the masa with oat flour as suggested on the DIY site.  But at the end of the day, the flavor is going to be watery pancake batter no matter what you do to the powder.  The biggest help for me to make sure the mixture stays mixed has been the blender bottle that I picked up.  Shaking the stuff in a regular bottle leaves a good amount of sludge at the bottom.  Having the mixer ball in there has been very helpful."
soylent,3a2rj1,funkeytown,2,Tue Jun 16 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"Well, a few things:  1) Adding flavorings takes a lot.  You literally need probably 10-15% of the mixture be the flavoring.  Extracts and whatnot barely flavor this stuff, without using half a bottle (at $5+USD per bottle, that's quite expensive).  2) For the most part, this stuff is supposed to taste like watered down cupcake batter.  It's supposed to be flavor-neutral, and you can't get much more neutral than cupcake/pancake batter.  3) Try adding the oil when you originally mix it, and then shake it up before you consume it (which you do anyway).  The oils need to blend in with the ingredients just as much as the remaining liquids need to blend in.  Adding the oil right before consumption, will skew the flavor profile, and probably make it taste a bit oily."
soylent,3a2rj1,NoDiggityNoDoubt,2,Tue Jun 16 20:00:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick response! So is this 'working as advertised' then? I'm wondering if maybe I'm adding too much or too little water to the recipe, or maybe it's just something I need to get used to?  I've read that there are various options for adjusting the texture, such as reducing the masa and adding some oat flour. I wanted to get some other opinions before I started tampering with the formula. I could even just reduce the masa for a slightly lower calorie count if you thought that might help.  Also this isn't for 100% meal replacement, so I could take out some of the ingredients and still have a pretty reasonable profile for the entire day..."
soylent,3a2rj1,NoDiggityNoDoubt,2,Tue Jun 16 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"So long as you're following the recipe amounts, you should be good, and by that, it would be ""working as advertised.""

soylent,3a056c,MrFathed,3,Tue Jun 16 05:53:38 2015 UTC,It's the Pepto.
soylent,3a056c,NoDiggityNoDoubt,2,Tue Jun 16 06:08:01 2015 UTC,"Cut back on the pepto. Pepto can cause dark green-black stool on its own, so eliminating the pepto should clear up the color quickly if that's the problem, otherwise the next step would be a fecal occult blood test. My money is on the pepto. IDK about the powdery residue; toiletpaper falling apart maybe?  How many days have you been on soylent? It can take a while to adjust and everybody's different (depends on what intestinal flora were dominate). Also, in the 1.0-1.3 days it was commonly recommended to drink your soylent slowly over the course of maybe 20-30 minutes rather than quickly. This seemed to help prevent indigestion and bloating. This advice might apply in your case.  Have some bananas."

soylent,3a056c,bobpaul,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:23:20 2015 UTC,You might also consider a 2 week course of prisolec or equivalent.

soylent,3a056c,bobpaul,0,Tue Jun 16 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"Activated charcoal is for food poisoning (some spoilage bacteria make toxins; charcoal absorbs them). Since (s)he just started soylent, I'd say it's more just an issue with the good intestinal bacteria; probably the previous diet had less fiber, and it'll take some time for the few bacteria that are good at digesting fiber to increase in numbers enough to balance things out. I don't know that charcoal would help; both constipation and diarrhea are documented side effects of activated charcoal."
soylent,3a056c,Sharra_Blackfire,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"In large doses it's for food poisoning. Small doses have better results than tums/antacids. Just as my own personal anecdote, I've taken it as needed for years and never had any issues with either of those side effects, but YMMV. I do agree about probiotics though"
soylent,3a056c,Lob-Star,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"My poo is still real weird about 2 days after stopping pepto. I guess the bismuth might still be in my gut, but its lighter and greener now. When I go now, I can barely feel myself pooping (its soft, but still substantive) and at the same time I feel constipated. Still having the wipe residue issue, lots of smearing and yet the smear is chalky or gritty. Probably undigested. Anyways, just logging this here for anyone starting soylent. If I'm still having issues after a week I might have to lower fiber or increase water intake but I'm not worried atm. Started taking a probiotic also."
soylent,3a056c,Ellawell,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:43:25 2015 UTC,Black can indicate internal bleeding from what I understand.  I am sure there are other less scary reasons too.  Might want to phone a doc and ask.

soylent,39yxzf,Im_Excellent,6,Tue Jun 23 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"Secret...?   To start off, I drive freight trains for a living so I normally am gone for 24-48 hours per trip.   I started joylent mainly because I was working out of town for 3 weeks at a time and my company provided me hotels without kitchens and only something like $25 a day meal allowance. My average meal cost eating out was probably 20-25 dollars a meal after tip. I was only on soylents for the last 2 months I was working out of town though....   First month I had a weeks worth of 100%FOOD just to try it out. Once I realized how big all the bottles we're I packed most the meals into individual sandwich size ziplock bags and then all of those into large freezer bags to contain it all. I kept some meals in bottles so I could use the bottles for easy storage while working. I used a wide mouth Nalgene bottle as a blender bottle, stuffed with socks or something to reduced size on the flight out.   The second month I packed joylent with me so it was just a bit different, and a bit closer to what official soylent is like. Basically I swapped out my clothes bag for a bit bigger bag and slimmed down what I was taking, I like minimalism while traveling anyways... This time I brought a blender bottle to mix meals and still used the 100%FOOD bottles for premeasured meals. I marked each bottle (including blender bottle) so I knew how much a meal was and used a 750ml coke bottle cut in half as a funnel.  I guess to sum up    Pack light! Pack smart! Bring a second checked bag if you have to. Use a blender bottle to prepare meals as you eat them because hotel fridges are unusably small.  If you can, measure out meals before leaving your hotel for the day.  Realize that you WILL eat out occasionally either with work colleagues or just because. Reduce the amount of soylent you're bringing accordingly.   ... Trying to think of other tips..."
soylent,39yxzf,ryanmercer,2,Tue Jun 16 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"o start off, I drive freight trains for a living so I normally am gone for 24-48 hours per trip.    Why do you guys randomly stop on tracks blocking multiple roads while miles and miles from any place to unload? Is it just a 'something weird is on the track' or more a 'there's already a train where I'm going unloading""? The damn CSX trains around here are forever blocking intersections during rush hour."
soylent,39yxzf,ryanmercer,3,Tue Jun 16 09:49:27 2015 UTC,"If they're stopped for more than 5 minutes (actually stopped!) call and report it. I'm not sure what the specifics are in other countries, but in Canada its 5 minutes and you'd better be moving again.   As for why we're stopping, could be meeting another train, could be yard congestion or a number of things I guess.   The worst problems come when you get a very large yard in a densely populated city. When I was working in a bigger city and the yard was full, you'd get trains stopped 10 or more miles out waiting in line to get into the yard. There were set spots you could stop and not be blocking crossings, so one guy gets a light into the yard and then everyone else slowly pulls up to the next spot.   As far as something weird on the track, if you i hit a cars or a person I will stop regardless of what's blocked and for how long, other than that it doesn't really matter.   One other thing, if it's a regular occurrence being blocked there it could be poor planning on the railway's or the crew's part and should be reported. Before blocking key crossings we always make sure that we're going to be able to clear it or else we drop a crew member off to cut the crossing (seperate the train at the crossing). Not doing these things is piss poor railroading and should be reported."
soylent,39yxzf,ryanmercer,2,Tue Jun 16 12:15:26 2015 UTC,"Heh I've called CSX when their gates come down and block traffic with absolutely zero train in sight and their attitude is pretty much GFY.   Now, why are train horns so loud? I'll hear the one a few miles from my house (in the city) 2-3 AM almost every night as it blasts it through the handful of crossings.  I swear one morning I'm going to lose it, be hiding down there and jump on the train and slap the conductor senseless with a wooden train whistle haha. It's 2-3 AM and gates and probably zero cars anywhere in sight.   deep breath  I mean, thanks!  And I'm not anti-train, I just cross two tracks to get to and from work... and probably 30% of the time in the mornings I'll sit for 10 minutes or more while one crawls by slower than I can walk and then when i'm leaving work it's usually a race a mile down the road to get to the crossing here at IND before a train shows up heh. It sucks because I have about a 12 minute commute, but if there is a train it quickly becomes a 20+ minute commute."
soylent,39yxzf,ryanmercer,5,Tue Jun 16 12:27:36 2015 UTC,"Gates down but no train is actually kind of a serious problem should be dealt with... Next time try this ""there is an unsafe condition at x crossing... the warning devices are malfunctioning"" don't give any other details.   As for blowing the whistle, our hands are tied. It's law, we must blow those crossings, if we don't and somebody gets hit then we're held liable. There is a way around it though, the city can enact an anti whistle bylaw (at least they can in Canada, not sure about USA) and then we just ring the bell.   If the train is pulling by at 1 mph he's probably deliberately skirting the rules around blocking crossings. As long as he's moving they don't have to worry about the 5 minutes."

I wonder how long the powder mixed in water stays suspended as a good shake. This way I can mix it morning and consume during lunch hour. To test this, asked my mom to mix it (with a scoop of ice cream, because tasted like an oatmeal with no taste in morning) now and put it in fridge.

This has been brought up a great deal already, but the TL;DR of most of the threads are the following:  1) Give your body ample time to adjust to the new diet.  2) Transition slowly to the new diet (slowly increase the amount of soylent you consume daily). Don't just go straight into 100% soylent right out of the gate.   3) Don't give up after a week or two and assume the same thing will keep happening. Your gut microbiome will eventually adjust."

Also, be aware I wouldn't hold it against you not to ship to the territories - it costs a fortune to ship to some locations. Even Amazon.ca discontinued their Prime shipping to some locations recently. I just want companies to be upfront about its geographic restrictions.

As the shaker was supplied by Nutrilent, and the bag (of Nutrilent...) says to use 600ml, it's a bit worrying.   600ml seems wrong. Not only does it not fit, the resulting mix is very watery. Could they really not have caught on to this by using their product a single time??"
soylent,39xwqr,tmp8182,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:43:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the honest review. I'm happy you liked our product. I'm sorry for the outburst a couple of days earlier. It's just that we are a starting company and that user has made that post only to hurt our reputation. The thread still comes up first when searching for Nutrilent on Google and it's hurting our business a lot. I apologized and proofed that nothing of what was claimed was true. I did this here and on Soylent Discourse http://discourse.soylent.com/t/speculation-about-nutrilent-ingredient-quality/21894/47  I got them to change the title and flag his post however it's still on here and google. So it was a pretty unpleasant time.   But still I shouldn't have acted that way and it was very unprofessional of me.
soylent,39xwqr,Nutrilent,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting, detailed review!  I think the concern isn't that fishbait is in the current product,  the worry is that grade 3 soyflour from a fish bait store was even considered at all.  It suggests that the person behind the company prioritizes profits over ingredient quality.  Add to that the flood of obviously fake reviews (not yours) here, on Discourse and on Dutch bodybuilding forums over the past 2 weeks + the creator's outbursts - now most people aren't going to trust this company unless they make a serious focus on transparency."

We have A LOT of money invested in our company and are the only one's who produce and package the product at such a hygienic level.

soylent,39yhpt,dreiter,7,Mon Jun 15 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"This was a randomized, double-blind, n=11, crossover study (and with no conflicts of interest as far as I can see).  I do not have access to the full paper though.   Results: Compared with sucrose, absorption of isomaltulose was prolonged by ∼50 min (P = 0.004). Mean plasma concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide were ∼10–23% lower (P < 0.05). In contrast, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was ∼64% higher (P < 0.001) after isomaltulose ingestion, which results in an increased insulin-to-glucagon ratio (P < 0.001) compared with sucrose. The cumulative amount of systemic glucose appearance was ∼35% lower after isomaltulose than after sucrose (P = 0.003) because of the reduction in orally derived and endogenously produced glucose and a higher first-pass splanchnic glucose uptake (SGU). Insulin action was enhanced after isomaltulose compared with sucrose (P = 0.013).   ELI5 version: Isomaltulose takes longer to digest than sucrose and causes lower insulin response.  Take from that what you will, but I think the isomaltulose addition to Soylent is a plus (compared to pre-1.4 versions)."
soylent,39yhpt,mangomania42,0,Mon Jun 15 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"But it didn't replace sucrose, did it? The right comparison is isomaltulose compared to what it replaced."

soylent,39yhad,sleepycorn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Start off slow, if you're worried about the dramatic shift.  Start by having it for breakfast every day.  Even if you get food cravings, you'll be able to hold out until lunch.  Then, after a few days, or a week, start having it for lunch every other day.  When you get used to that, start having it for lunch every day, as well.  Then, if you want to go 100%, start replacing a few dinners a week with it until you eventually get up to 100% Soylent.

Thanks for the tip."
soylent,39x6is,UgarteTheThief,3,Tue Jun 16 12:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't want to have to mess with a blender either.  You could probably even find a sugar free variety if you're concerned about calories.  I used 1/3 of a 6 serving package and that added enough flavor and thickness for my tastes- it would probably come out almost as thick as real pudding if you use a whole package."

soylent,39wti9,valawndart,4,Mon Jun 15 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"The ""induction phase"" of Atkins is essentially a ketogenic diet, after that you add in MOAR carbs (and way too much protein for your kidneys). A for realsies Ketogenic diet stays below 20-30g of net carbs/day all the time. So it's all induction, all the time! Keto Chow will very much start ketosis, and with the ample electrolytes you should be able to completely avoid the ""keto flu"" that can often accompany it.  Correct. Getting the right vitamins without a multi-vitamin is pretty hard. Rosa Labs Soylent uses powdered vitamins because they have access to it and industrial packing and mixing equipment. In theory, I could grind up the vitamins and incorporate them into the powder but I've heard bad things about how that affects the taste so I have them separate."
soylent,39wti9,chrisbair,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Just as a data point, Keto Fuel seems to use powdered multivitamin (AFAICT) and the taste is not affected (at least, the overall result tastes good to me). Might be worth checking out since it'd definitely simplify things for both you and customers. :D  Edit: diy site formula links to https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VVR6WK?tag=19-82341-20  /u/axcho - if you're willing to share, do you just dump out the contents of these capsules, or does (did?) the commercial version use something different?"
soylent,39wti9,ShippingIsMagic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"/u/axcho if you are dumping out the capsules you could use a trick I learned a while ago:    get a blendtec put 100-200 capsules in it pulse blend it for a few seconds (just enough to break the capsules, not enough to turn the shells into powder) put it through a wire strainer.    I used to open up all the vitamin K capsules by hand, one at a time. That works for a single week but becomes untenable for larger quantities."
soylent,39wti9,chrisbair,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:09:10 2015 UTC,I got around to trying this about a month before closing Custom Body Fuel. Would have saved a lot of time if we'd tried that sooner. :p
soylent,39wti9,axcho,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"I used to just dump out the contents of those capsules. For Super Body Fuel, we'll be getting a specific multivitamin blend in powdered form from a supplier."
soylent,39wti9,axcho,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Guess I could do that too, but it would make it nearly impossible for people to mix their own using the recipe (unless they bought the vitamin mix from me)."
soylent,39wti9,chrisbair,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's more out of necessity than anything else. If you can just give people the Kirkland Signature multivitamins in a plastic bag, that's great."
soylent,39wti9,axcho,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"If they bought the capsules, they wouldn't need to go through the effort to dump them into the mix, they could just take them like they do the vitamins that come with Keto Chow now.  IOW, whereas currently Keto Chow people are today stuck taking vitamins whether they DIY or do the commercial mix, if you go this route then they have an additional incentive to purchase yours, since it means not having to take the vitamins.  This is the same value-add that /u/axcho was doing previously, since people making their own Keto Fuel likely just took the capsules instead of trying to get them into the mix.  IMHO, it's a significant win since I find the vitamin a bit more hassle (I'd forget to take it sometimes) and certainly less tasty. :D"
soylent,39wti9,ShippingIsMagic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Good points. Hmmmm. I'll have to investigate that. I did look into the same multi-vitamins from Keto Fuel, it ends up with a couple serious deficiencies that would have to be filled with other sources (Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum and Phosphorus). I suspect my best option would be a custom powder blend that closely replicates what's in the Costco ones."
soylent,39wti9,chrisbair,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:48:43 2015 UTC,There really isn't any research to suggest protein is harmful to people with healthy kidneys.
soylent,39wti9,pundemic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:44:07 2015 UTC,I haven't researched it enough to argue either way. I do know that protein causes an insulin response (though nothing compared to eating candy) which is one of the things you actively avoid doing keto. So for that at least you want to cap the amount of protein you're eating to what you reasonably need.
soylent,39wti9,chrisbair,2,Mon Jun 15 20:04:32 2015 UTC,I believe the thing to look out for with protein and keto is that eating too much protein can lead to gluconeogensis which is when your body makes glucose out of excess protein.
soylent,39wti9,pundemic,2,Mon Jun 15 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"No. When I send out a week of Keto Chow there's a small bag with 7 pills in it (unless I forget, it's happened twice that I know of). They're the Kirkland Signature Daily multivitamins."

Breast milk is low in iron, and watery, for a reason.  Goddamnit.  In any case, baby formula has been actively researched and developed for many decades.  Motherfucker. Some dickhead is going to harm their child with Soylent, and then bring the bad press down on the whole thing.  Soylent/Joylent need to invest in big ass stickers: ""NOT FOR BABIES FUCKSTICK"".

soylent,39udtx,Barefoot__Wanderer,2,Mon Jun 15 06:24:11 2015 UTC,Actually not all the way true... They have done many studies showing minimal differences between breast milk and formula when controlled between twins in the same family. In some cases formula was even better. The big difference comes in if the child doesn't get colostrum. Now to go search for sources....

soylent,39udtx,UndeadKitten,3,Mon Jun 15 07:07:21 2015 UTC,"Hi all, as u/wcoenen already mentioned, the review mentioned here was someone who was stated they've been our customer for 8 months, not that they're feeding the product to their 8 month old baby! Joylent is meant for consumption by regular adults so no underage drinking!!!!! We have included this warning on our FAQ too!"
soylent,39udtx,are-you-really-sure,3,Mon Jun 15 07:24:53 2015 UTC,A sticker on the actual package would be more effective. Especially since the person buying the product isn't necessarily the person using the product.
soylent,39udtx,UndeadKitten,5,Mon Jun 15 07:37:09 2015 UTC,"I don't ""do"" soylent, but have been part of this subreddit for months. (I find it fascinating that there are powders that can completely replace ""food"" food. I'm not ready to take the plunge and stop eating my own cooking yet, but I still like to browse your threads and read your experiences because lets face it, its really pretty cool and has huge implications for things like disaster relief efforts and people with eating issues.)  That said, this reminds me of the story I see crop up every so often, where a vegan mother or set of parents decides breast milk isn't ""vegan"" enough and puts their kind on soy or almond milk. Inevitably the child becomes very sick, often they die and tons of perfectly sane vegan/vegetarians get the dark cloud of a few idiots hanging over their head.  Whereas the vegan movement is very strong, so a few idiots killing their (innocent, other than the crime of having morons for parents) babies isn't going to end them, you guys with your assortment of frankly pretty cool food options and especially those of you doing the work to develop and sell the products are not in that strong a perch yet. People still don't quite accept a diet like that other than in fringe groups like body builders.  So if someone kills their kid with Joylent (to use the product from OP) and decies to sue because they were an idiot and there wasn't a handy sticker saying ""This ain't infant formula!"" I can see the lawsuit swinging towards the parents, based simply on lack of understanding. Joylent is powder, formula is powder, Joylent gets sued and what seems like a really cool idea and a decent business (judging from the satisfaction with customer service and research I've seen in threads) may go under. May even go under with a few other companies pulled down with them due to negative publicity.  For purely CYA sake, I agree. Companies, cover your ass! Warning on the website, big neon sticker on the container! Customers, don't feed a growing brain/body something that isn't proven to be ideal for it. Breast is best, but formula is a good option too. Iron over dose on the other hand can cause clotting issues in a baby. (One died in our area after drinking a bottle of liquid iron supplement her father had for his weight training. She was a toddler, but it was enough to cause a blood cloth in her brain. I never would have thought it was possibly, but apparently too much iron is a thing.)"

In the Netherlands they don't do law like they do in the U.S."
soylent,39udtx,UndeadKitten,0,Mon Jun 15 00:48:34 2015 UTC,US law would allow distributors to be sued in place of the actual company.  And I used Joylent because it's the product mentioned in the OP. Sub US made food powders if you want to get technical.
soylent,39udtx,ketolent,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:14:05 2015 UTC,Second point taken. I am curious about your first statement though. How does that work? Wouldn't the only thing they can do is ban the import of the product? I'm genuinely curious. It sounds bonkers that U.S. citizens would be able to sue foreign companies about U.S. regulations under U.S. law?...  Edit: upon closer inspection: I may have misread your comment.  Edit2: ok different question. How does it work if they ship it to the U.S. themselves without distributors?
soylent,39udtx,snakeofsilver,2,Mon Jun 15 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about shipping without distributors, if they decide they think the food is dangerous they will ban it and ALL SIMILAR PRODUCTS.   And lets just be honest... we banned kinder eggs. I assume you know what those are? Tasty chocolate around a plastic egg containing a cute little toy? Yeah, we banned those because some people were too stupid to read the clearly labeled packages and allowed kids to choke on the plastic egg. And then because Disney had a similar product called Wonder Ball (later than Kinder Egg, but a similar concept, toy inside chocolate shell) they decided that was dangerous too.  We ban things for dumb reasons. (I'd give you more examples but I just wrestled a Rottweiler to give him a pill. Which in the end, after he ate the bread, spit out the pill, ate the pill pocket, spit out the pill and resisted me putting the pill on his tongue? He ate it out of my hand, bare with no covering because this dog is insane.) Anyway, back to the questions:  I think US citizens actually CAN sue foreign companies. I'm not a law student but I'm pretty sure we have sued companies in China before over lead contamination. But usually we just ban the foreign item, plus any domestic products that happen to resemble the banned item for good measure.  But the bottom line is:   People are dumb. Dumb people have kids. Dumb people feed their kids things that are entirely inappropriate for kids. Then kids end up sick or dead, dumb people sue because the product didn't tell them that it WASN'T infant formula (or didn't tell them not to swallow a plastic easter egg capsule) and a good product ends up illegal.   And before someone says this, no Kinder Egg didn't kill anyone, it ran afoul of a law about candy being safe for all ages. But you can feed a toddler a chocolate shell it you are WATCHING the kid and it is safe for all ages. The trouble is you can't just hand them a Kinder Egg and expect things to be okay so our fine government went ahead and protected the dumb people (and their children, who may or may not be dumb) by banning them due to small parts. Contained in a big plastic capsule.  The way to protect a product from being banned is to plaster it with warning labels. Do everything in your(general you) power to cover one's ass and pre-empt the dumb people. Because I have become convinced that some people actively look for things they can do to have a reason to sue.  I'm somewhat cynical though."

But, I also have a little thing called common sense, and the notices that Soylent have, are right on par with everything else with similar notices.  Speaking of common sense, do you really think Soylent doesn't have legal counsel specifically for this?  I mean, this is a ""food product,"" which means there are even more legal obstacles they have to cover, which I'm sure they have, otherwise they would already be out of business.  So, before you go acting like you know something, and attempting to ""call me out,"" think twice about the obvious aspects of the situation.  You're just going to make yourself look stupid."

soylent,39udtx,Jackalyst,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:36:40 2015 UTC,Deficiency seems like a more probable consequence. Why would kids need less nutrition per calorie? I haven't done all the math with the usda recommendations but that seems to be true for most things.
soylent,39udtx,Jackalyst,2,Sun Jun 14 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"I went through the nutrition facts for Joylent, Soylent, and Jackalent, and although Soylent's nutrients are around 100-140%, Joylent and Jackalent tends to have some stuff in greater excess that what's necessary. Especially the B vitamins (and some others) tend to go several times higher than the daily need (19x in case of B1 for Jackalent). That's no risk for adults as they're water soluble (we can easily pee it out) and many people take excessive vitamin B pills for their benefits anyways, but you can still overdose on them and the concentration might be too high for children. Also, excesses of lipid soluble nutrients (hard to get rid of) might build up over time and cause complications in children who may not have the tolerance that adults have. I'm no nutritionist though, that last bit is conjecture."
soylent,39udtx,Dr_M30W,2,Mon Jun 15 01:23:06 2015 UTC,Also a big factor is the age of the children. A parent considering Soylent as an option for their 16yo kid is a far different thing than using it as baby formula for an infant.
soylent,39udtx,peetss,2,Mon Jun 15 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"19x in case of B1 for Jackalent   Things to that extreme is being phased out of the next update, though the baseline will still be 120% (so by having 3 of 4 meals, 90% can be achieved).

soylent,39wd76,adamavfc,3,Mon Jun 15 09:51:49 2015 UTC,That depends on your activity level. It all comes down to calories in vs calories out. If you don't exercise at all and eat a whole bag of Joylent every day plus some fruits then you're probably not going to see much of an impact on your weight. Figure out how many calories you need and how many you burn through exercise and adjust portion sizes accordingly. But don't cut it too much below a bag per day or you may miss out on vitamins and such.

It's been wonderful on a number of levels.   My relationship with food was effectively alcoholism but with food. So it has allowed me to ""quit"" food.  When dealing with other things in the past (smoking, drinking, drugs, etc) I noticed that ""cold turkey"" quitting was the most effective technique for me, but could never apply that before to my food problem. Soylent has allowed me to do exactly that.   Much like an alcoholic, I realize I'll be fighting this the rest of my life, but now I have an effective tool in my arsenal that allows me to keep a safe distance between myself and food.  I realize many people will say ""but it's still food"", but emotionally, at least for me, it's not.  It's much more equivalent to the sustenance food served on board the Nebuchadnezzar on the original Matrix movie, which is exactly what I needed.

I've gone a few weeks at 100% a couple different times, but normally I do 100% M-F and about 75% on weekends (I eat one meal a day on weekends socially). I have a few points I can make about it:  I feel much better when I'm on the diet, when ever I eat a meal I generally feel lethargic afterwards and stuffed for hours. I much prefer the feeling of being satiated all day rather than dealing with the energy swings of being hungry and then full. It's also significantly improved my regularity digestively speaking.  I never really cooked much before this either, so I was always eating out. I'm the type that puts everything on one CC and pays it off at the end of the month, my monthly statements used to be full of going out to eat charges. This last month I had 18 items on my monthly statement and about 1/2 were bills. The point is I save a ton of money being on the powdered food diet.  I'm a pretty active individual, if I look at an RMR calculator it tells me I need 2800 calories a day just to maintain my weight. I always struggled w/ this prior to the powdered food diet, I would have massive energy swings and just be dead tired most afternoons/evenings. Now I make 2800 calories of powdered food for M-F and then about 2200 on the weekends to go w/ my one social meal. My energy is significantly improved in my workouts and throughout the day. I hadn't realized how much of an impact nutrition could have on my energy levels.   I honestly could not imagine going back to a 100% diet of all food, it would be miserable and expensive for me."

soylent,39u9kj,beardeddragonborn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"I am very weird and picky about food. I'm hoping to slowly reduce my additives to get to 100%, but for now I'll stick with banana, chocolate powder, and some other yums."
soylent,39u9kj,loconessmonster,2,Sun Jun 14 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"I was the same way, then I figured out that I was making it ""wrong"". Soylent definitely is gross when its warm, so if you plan on bringing it with you buy something insulated.  Also I find that Soylent is best when its been sitting in the fridge for a couple hours.  I can't seem to make small portions correctly, its always either watered down or too thick. I always make a whole days worth in the provided pitcher.  TRY PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, it mixes very well with Soylent.  Additionally, I was really gung-ho about eating 100% Soylent but I quickly learned that I miss food too much, so I reduced it to more like 50-75% depending on my cravings."
soylent,39u9kj,ZerozakiIshiki,3,Mon Jun 15 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"Soylent spoils very quickly outside the fridge, so I wouldn't walk around with it in a non-insulated shaker bottle any more than I would milk."
soylent,39u9kj,LastSummerGT,3,Mon Jun 15 06:58:13 2015 UTC,how quick? I usually go to class for 2 hours before going to work and putting it in the fridge.
soylent,39u9kj,crumblebunny,2,Mon Jun 15 18:32:32 2015 UTC,I started using Soylent 1-2x day a few weeks ago. Initially I didn't really like the taste but after a few days I found myself craving Soylent. Hopefully you have a similar experience :)
soylent,39u9kj,skippybosco,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:53:11 2015 UTC,I hope so too!
soylent,39u9kj,p9504178,2,Sun Jun 14 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"Try it cold, even over ice, without the extra additives.. Given your self described success at cold turkey, this seems like a more sustainable solution in the long run than experimenting with more and more flavorings.."
soylent,39u9kj,ZerozakiIshiki,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"I chilled it overnight, and tried blending it with ice, nothing. I'm adding stuff for now but hoping I'll eventually be able to reduce the additives. If I can't, who cares."
soylent,39u9kj,p9504178,2,Mon Jun 15 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"Minor annoyance- the zip locks are unzipped, so if you don't shake them down thoroughly before opening, you'll get that shit everywhere.   When they're zipped, you might find that powder is waiting to surprise you above the zip when you cut the top off. Just dealt with that about ten minutes ago. Better to be unzipped and able to shake it down while still sealed."
soylent,39u9kj,thirtysixred,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"I shake it, zip it, and then cut below the zip to avoid that. Only useful if you're doing whole bottles."
soylent,39u9kj,Babyd3k,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:57:36 2015 UTC,"I have to unzip it, shake it, then cut it. Maybe I'll try cutting below the zip area and see how that works. Good idea."
soylent,39u9kj,thirtysixred,2,Mon Jun 15 13:03:15 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience, I was super excited to try it and had thought I prepped myself mentally for the taste, but once it hit my lips I became extremely nauseous and thought I made a huge mistake.   I added some peanut butter and cinnamon which helped a tiny bit, but there was this weird aftertaste that I just couldn't get past.   The next day I added some cocoa powder, and peanut butter and it's been amazing. The cocoa powder gets rid of that aftertaste and makes it quite pleasant.   I hope one day I can enjoy Soylent plain, but one day at a time."
soylent,39u9kj,reapernad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:26:44 2015 UTC,Are you talking about a hot cocoa mix or just straight cocoa powered? How much do you add per volume of Soylent?
soylent,39ucih,SirDrAaron,3,Sun Jun 14 21:14:03 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience with soymilk in the past. The only ingredients were that and whole soybeans, and I know I've eaten plenty of things with soy, so I figured it was the carrageenan  I pointed it out in the comments of the 1.5 announcement and it lead to a large conversation. Several of us were searching and couldn't find any legitimate literature about carrageenan allergies. In the process I found out that other foods I eat have carrageenan in them (most ice creams, PayDay bars, tons of stuff) and apparently it's not required to be on the label. I now suspect it's the whole soybeans, since the majority of food with soy has soy that's been heavily processed. There's probably some protein that's lost in the processing that I'm allergic to. I have the same problem with almonds, raw causes a reaction but roasted is fine, the roasting process eliminates something I am allergic to  Either way, I now have plenty of information to take to an allergist to have proper testing done. I've already had that with nuts (the roasted almonds thing was even diagnosed, the doctor tested both), now I just need to get carrageenan and whole soybeans tested. I'd suggest doing the same, and if you have any pet or seasonal allergies have those checked at the same time so the doctor can come up with a better treatment than eating Zyrtec like candy"

soylent,39ttll,Cookiest,5,Sun Jun 14 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"I have recently began a soylent regime while training for my third marathon. I am what you would call a 90%er with soylent but I also consume bananas, peanut butter, whey protein pretty much daily to add some extra protein and calories to my diet. So far its been about 2 weeks at about 45-50 miles per week and with that diet I have felt fine. I would say that I eat between 2500 and 2800 calories a day. So far there have been no side affects other than my need more tuns of water(obviously) and no i did not use gel packs."
soylent,39ttll,Rbrow89,3,Sun Jun 14 20:52:57 2015 UTC,I am a cyclist and am wanting to start training for Centuries. Anyone have experience with that while on a 100% soylent diet?
soylent,39ttll,beardeddragonborn,7,Sun Jun 14 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"I recently did my first century after having been on Soylent 80% of the time for two months. Never bonked, no cramps - I felt pretty great the whole way."
soylent,39ttll,kisschicken,3,Mon Jun 15 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"I've done century rides, but not on Soylent. I have ridden plenty since starting Soylent though, and didn't notice any difference in my performance or how I felt riding, so I'd feel perfectly fine with attempting a century on Soylent"
soylent,39tg97,fn0000rd,5,Sun Jun 14 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"I mix my soylent with thai tea, which is basically coffee....I'M NEVER GONNA GIVE THAT UP!!!"

soylent,39tg97,Soylentconor,5,Mon Jun 15 14:35:50 2015 UTC,A good amount of our user base adds cold coffee to their Soylent in the morning.
soylent,39tg97,tweezer82,3,Sun Jun 14 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"I am totally with you on this! I used to drink coffee almost everyday, and I won't touch the stuff now. Even if I'm tired and make some, it just gets tossed later after sitting around all day."
soylent,39tg97,uselesslogin,3,Sun Jun 14 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I still drink plenty of coffee but now if i miss a day it is no big deal whereas without Soylent I would get headaches."
soylent,39tg97,dare_you_to_be_real,3,Sun Jun 14 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I'd ever be able to kick the caffeine habit. I'd try every year, and spend like 2-3 weeks in a daze before saying fuck it, and getting back on the juice. With soylent, well really Joylent, I find that I really don't need the caffeine. This is a very strange thing for me after a couple decade long caffeine addiction."
soylent,39tg97,ricandersen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:54:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is exactly the sort of thing I was wondering about.  I once quit caffeine completely for ~5 years, and the first thing that I noticed was a reduction in the HIGH ENERGY -> crash cycle.   I was working for a dotcom, and often working until 2 or 3 in the morning, so the general thought process would be to start mainlining coffee, but I think what that does is make you burn your energy faster, after which you will crash, and then repeat the cycle.  My favorite thing about Soylent is the steady, regulated energy."
soylent,39tg97,ShatteringFast,3,Mon Jun 15 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"I really like coffee (go AeroPress!). I used to drink 2 cups every morning.  From day one of 50% Soylent, I stopped craving coffee. I now ""force"" myself to drink coffee, maybe twice a week. ""Force"" in the sense that I don't need the caffeine, don't crave it, but know I still like the taste."
soylent,39tg97,Aelcyx,3,Mon Jun 15 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"I love my AeroPress, you have brilliant taste. On Sunday I made a decaf Americano with it, and poured it into my regular cocoa/banana Soylent. It was SO good."
soylent,39tg97,Ditchbuster,3,Tue Jun 16 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"I have one cup of coffee per day, in the morning. M-F I use my AeroPress at the office and weekends I do a pourover at home. I had to cut down heavily because now that I've been on Soylent and lost some weight, one cup is enough! I'm a bit shaky for an hour but I like coffee too much. Getting out of bed and drinking Soylent is such a great way to start the day; I'm full of energy quickly and ready to start my day.  Death Before Decaf!!"
soylent,39tg97,msnu,2,Tue Jun 16 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"I quit before soylent and only have an iced tea like once a month if I'm feeling lethargic. I had it Friday for a late showing of Jurassic World. Made me feel terrible. So, yeah, don't miss it."
soylent,39tg97,epeen,2,Sun Jun 14 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"i still have lots of caffeine, but i have sleep apnea and im still waiting on my APAP machine. I don't sleep well. Coffee or diet sodas. I still find i crave flavored drinks but probably not as much since i tend to be better hydrated on soylent."
soylent,39tg97,SparklingLimeade,2,Sun Jun 14 18:55:01 2015 UTC,So my idea of cutting soda (and sugar in general) bevor trying joylent wasn't that bad. I always had the problem of craving flavored drinks and tried to solve that with tea as a healthier replacement -- with a medium success. Hopefully my discipline will improve when I start cutting out meals for liquid food :)
soylent,39tg97,themarmot,2,Sun Jun 14 19:35:00 2015 UTC,No impact at all. Still have 3-4 cups of coffee a day.
soylent,39tg97,FBomher,2,Sun Jun 14 20:01:35 2015 UTC,I still drink as much tea as ever. It's not so crippling when I miss my morning cup though.
soylent,39tg97,be_bo_i_am_robot,2,Sun Jun 14 20:43:00 2015 UTC,I'm hopelessly addicated to redbull(it's my one guilty pleasure).  I've cut back but I just can't seem to cut the strings on it.  It does help me get going a bit faster and handle late nights when needed.
soylent,39unp8,esccx,2,Sun Jun 14 22:51:55 2015 UTC,Too much potassium at once. Be careful.
soylent,39unp8,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:56:31 2015 UTC,It's 5 grams per day - so about 1.7 grams per meal. Is that too much?
soylent,39unp8,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a lot per day, it's how much you are taking in at once. There is a reason over the counter potassium supplements in the U.S. are limited to 99mg or less by law. Try consuming less in a sitting."

soylent,39sx15,shileyjimon,2,Sun Jun 14 13:27:35 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the general transparency of their production. Does the California dept of agriculture and food perform inspection on their food preparation? What consumer guarantees do we have?   Also i never heard about HPP but it sounds interesting and useful.
soylent,39sx15,rook2pawn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:42:27 2015 UTC,FDA covers it (not a lot of faith in them but it's what we have).
soylent,39sx15,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"As far as Soylent goes, they themselves don't do production, just packaging and r&d. The production labs they contract out to are quiet about what methods and equipment they use, but it's possible."
soylent,39sx15,JavierMcDrizzle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, this wouldn't be required, since Soylent, etc. are dry products until mixed at home by the consumer. In contrast, pressed juices are liquid from the time of their creation, and are around for many days or weeks before someone drinks them. And since liquid is a much more fertile medium for bacterial growth, they need some form of processing to prevent that growth."
soylent,39sx15,dreiter,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"Right, I guess my question was if Soylent, etc. was mixed immediately and sent out out in a bottle, so as to be sold in a convenience store or something similar, would HPP extend its shelf life there?"
soylent,39tndx,Nautisop,6,Sun Jun 14 17:44:26 2015 UTC,I just supplement a day's worth of Soylent with the whey and/or casein I was using before I started Soylent.

soylent,39tndx,rcreview,2,Sun Jun 14 19:47:56 2015 UTC,The recipe for bodybuilding soylent is more soylent. At the 3k+ cal level you'll be getting enough protein. A lot of studies and changing opinion heading in the direction of less than 1 g per lb of bodyweight for active people.

soylent,39sp12,NipperAllen,5,Sun Jun 14 11:32:57 2015 UTC,"Any actual time saved just gets eaten up by other activities, almost magically. The real difference for me in integrating Soylent (DIY) into most meals (90%?) was not having to think/worry/consider/analyse what to buy, what to cook, what to prepare. Just the simplicity of reaching into the fridge and grabbing a drink that's already prepared.   Found my energy levels were stable, I wasn't reaching for cans of coke much at all (this surprised me) and just makes the 'daily food routine' simpler. I still think that a varied, balanced diet would be healthier for me than Soylent but compared to what I was eating/drinking before, Soylent is godly."
soylent,39sp12,knightxiii,2,Sun Jun 14 11:47:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, the mental space that Soylent opens up has helped me quite a bit."

soylent,39sp12,imnewandisuck,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"Daily food routine is eating soylent for breakfast and lunch, cooking dinner after class as a way to unwind and enjoy food. When I feel the urge to snack, I down a bottle of water and wait a few minutes. If I still want to eat food, I have a big bag of prunes and pop some of those. Haven't been to the grocery store in two weeks because I've only had to cook ~14 meals, most of which have been some variation on rice, beans, and chicken. It's also nice that in the morning when I wake up I can just mix some soylent and drink breakfast on my way to the gym. It's not too heavy and not just water or protein powder. It gives me fewer excuses to skip a workout because it's a perfectly nutritious snack that doesn't make me feel sluggish at all."
soylent,39sp12,ZiggyZoomber,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:38:55 2015 UTC,Soylent helps me eat better for breakfast and lunch on weekdays and save money. Unfortunately it doesn't help save time as I have to take a mandatory 30 min lunch break.

On the weekends I would spend about 4 hours preparing 6 days worth of meals and be exhausted by the end of it. Soylent saves me time on the weekend and during the week. I can relax and drink my soylent while at my desk or just running about. It usually takes me 20 min to drink one serving still, but I can do stuff while I drink it. So far I've really enjoyed catching up on my reading. Mixing my week's worth of soylent takes roughly 25 min. and Prep for each day is about 5 min or less."

soylent,39r9k2,Late_To_Parties,2,Sat Jun 27 00:04:29 2015 UTC,"I might add a bit of lime to it, I think.  This sounds like a good idea for a small amount.  It is unusual as hell for what people generally consider as drinkable... usually sweets, fruits, and fats are what people associate with drinks. Not salts and spices. I might give it a swing."
soylent,39qncu,beardeddragonborn,4,Sat Jun 13 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"I was one of the folks that ordered soylent way back in the day...that May when it first became available, and waited a good 6 months for my first batch.   I've experimented with other soylent-like products since then. I just placed an order for Soylent 1.5 this week, and I'm really impressed by the shipping.   Ordered Monday 6/8, received this afternoon, Saturday 6/13. They've come a long way.   Side note: last version of Soylent I tried was 1.2, I really didn't care for it. 1.5 (judging from the small glass I just made) appears to be really quite good!"
soylent,39qncu,Cheddarbek,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"Still only my first day with it, but so far I am loving the taste!"
soylent,39qncu,aideya,3,Sat Jun 13 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"I have had a similar experience. Ordered when it first came available (like April of '14 I think). They lost our order and we didn't end up getting it (1.1) until October/November (can't remember exactly). Took me until May to get through it, so I ordered again. Got 1.4 in 6 days."
soylent,39qncu,sleepycorn,2,Sat Jun 13 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"Mine was the opposite. My subscription shipment was charged but didn't ship. I thought ""hey, while they get this figured out, it wouldn't hurt to have more soylent"", so I made another subscription. It also did not ship. Customer service did not respond until Soylentconor poked them, but it still did not ship out. I finally asked them to refund me. My plan is to make a new account and a new subscription. I hope that ships.  (Note: my first and second shipments shipped very fast.)"
soylent,39qncu,blackguyoncrack,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Ordered 6/16, still waiting :(. Soylentconor responds extremely quick on here which is really cool though.   Edit- 5/16"
soylent,39qncu,ricandersen,7,Sat Jun 13 21:09:18 2015 UTC,You ordered three days in the future?
soylent,39qncu,Gracksploitation,3,Sat Jun 13 21:23:16 2015 UTC,Soylentconor is really John Connor leading the Soylent revolution from the future.
soylent,39qncu,UgarteTheThief,3,Sat Jun 13 22:40:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like Soylent needs to be shoehorned into some Terminator quotes here, but I'm afraid I'm not the right man for the job."
soylent,39qncu,blackguyoncrack,2,Sat Jun 13 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"100% food's marketing is eat like an astronaut, soylent could probably pull that off."
soylent,39qncu,_ilovetofu_,5,Sun Jun 14 11:37:33 2015 UTC,Soylent is the food of the future
soylent,39qncu,blackguyoncrack,2,Sat Jun 13 23:50:44 2015 UTC,5/16*
soylent,39rlrv,MontyTheMooch,3,Sun Jun 14 02:01:24 2015 UTC,I mix it with coffee sometimes or use cold coffee from the fridge. I actually prefer cold coffee added just before drinking
soylent,39rlrv,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried with the official, but I tried hot coffee with 100% food, and it sort of baked it. It made it super duper stiff and firm, but as I was drinking it rather than spooning it, it was somewhat unpleasant. I want to try to cold brew some coffee overnight and try that instead."
soylent,39rlrv,mrnovember5,2,Sun Jun 14 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"Joylent does the same thing, but /u/ebouwman's solution works perfectly well: Just put in some cold water first, and only then put in the hot coffee. You get porridge with boiling water, but not with water that's just warm. They say the vanilla flavor works really well with coffee."
soylent,39rlrv,Ari_Rahikkala,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:08:31 2015 UTC,I will definitely be trying that. I generally don't like vanilla though. (Everyone thinks I'm weird) Coffee is lovely on it's own imo.
soylent,39rlrv,mrnovember5,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:57:01 2015 UTC,That sounds.... gross.   I did it with 100%FOOD as well but I added cold water THEN the coffee. Was ok.
soylent,39rlrv,mrnovember5,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:58:43 2015 UTC,"Ooo, maybe I'll try that. I was considering just making the coffee and then letting it go cold but then I realized I'd just be drinking stale old coffee.  It was gross."
soylent,39rlrv,mrnovember5,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:02:14 2015 UTC,"You can also just refrigerate the coffee...  Make a big pot in the morning, after you're done your cup of coffee pop the rest into the fridge overnight."
soylent,39pos3,dchurch0,7,Sat Jun 13 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"hey did somebody call me =)  The 5ml of oil specified gets you up above 2g of omega 3. If keto chow is your only source of food then it's probably a good idea to do the full 5ml/5 pills. If you're eating other stuff that has omega 3s in it then it's probably not as vital.  Also, looks like the stuff you are taking has a higher Omega 3 then the Kirkland one I'm using. I would recommend cloning the recipe and put the figures for your pills in, you probably only need 1 or 2 of those ones."
soylent,39pos3,chrisbair,3,Sat Jun 13 20:42:27 2015 UTC,Thanks /u/chrisbair! You're awesome! I appreciate the feedback.
soylent,39pos3,dreiter,3,Sat Jun 13 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Paging /u/chrisbair!  My guess is that Chris wants a large ""safety net"" for EPA+DHA in the diet, so he recommends a large amount of fish oil to ensure that.  I haven't seen any papers showing benefits over 500mg/day of DHA, and I would also be concerned about mercury levels of whatever oil you are consuming, but the science isn't solid on the issue yet."
soylent,39pos3,ketolent,3,Sat Jun 13 15:51:47 2015 UTC,You can be as rigid as you want regarding your fat sources but at the end of the day that is probably just what Chris recommends and believes to be optimal.
soylent,39osei,Korrak,2,Sat Jun 13 08:45:49 2015 UTC,"I have a couple bullet cups. I fill one about 1/4 way with water and put in on my scale. I add 250g of mixture. I usually do a little of one, a little of another. The banana works with the other flavors pretty well. I haven't felt the need to add anything else. Then I add water towards near the top. I put it in the bullet for about 10 seconds, remove the top, and split the mixture evenly between two containers. Add water to both and put them in the fridge. Takes about 3 minutes, if that, to make two of my four daily meals."

soylent,39osei,erdzwerg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:28:30 2015 UTC,"I got my first 5 day supply recently, I was gonna try coffee with the vanilla. Does proper ground coffee work ok or would you recommend just using instant?"
soylent,39osei,DKatri,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:22:32 2015 UTC,"I use ground coffee, cause my instant stuff foams really bad."
soylent,39osei,Tandrial,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:28:22 2015 UTC,Do you use a blender? Shaking works fine.
soylent,39osei,erdzwerg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:42:47 2015 UTC,"I used a shaker, ~300ml Coffee and ~150ml Water. I might have to experiment some more then"
soylent,39osei,Tandrial,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:51:19 2015 UTC,Do you shake it or blend it? is it gravy?
soylent,39osei,erdzwerg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:44:44 2015 UTC,"I drop the coffee/vanilla into the empty shaker bottle and fill it with a some hot water. Shake. Add joylent, fill with cold water. Shake. 30min+ in the fridge. Works best in terms of consistence for me."
soylent,39osei,rcreview,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:37:54 2015 UTC,"Stupid question - but will the vanilla blend into bits if I drop part of a bean into my prep blender with soylent, or should I powder the vanilla beforehand?"
soylent,39osei,erdzwerg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:29:56 2015 UTC,I got myself a little mill( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n90sxkU8L._SY300_.jpg). Pricing was surprisingly good.
soylent,39osei,rcreview,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will get one! How much do you add if you don't mind me asking? I think I would have liked the editions of soylent that had vanillin in it."
soylent,39mulz,llSourcell,11,Fri Jun 12 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"They do, calories, bodies crave so much of it every day some people  have too much and have a hard time cutting back. Seriously though, it's just good, which is why your body wants it. Searching the sub for ""crave"" shows this."
soylent,39mulz,_ilovetofu_,3,Fri Jun 12 21:48:20 2015 UTC,Pretty much ya... Also all the vitamins and nutrients...
soylent,39mulz,_ilovetofu_,3,Fri Jun 12 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by good, I should've said good for you"
soylent,39mulz,DakAttakk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:51:11 2015 UTC,Pretty good as well in my opinion.
soylent,39mulz,LeifDTO,2,Sat Jun 13 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I could have such a universal craving but yeah, this is my 5th day on 90% and even though 1.5 isn't as sweet as the couple bags of a friend's 1.1 I started with I crave it just as much because of how filling and nutritionally balanced it is. It feels like I'm living sustainably on godly milkshakes and I love it."
soylent,39mulz,QuizPheasant,5,Sat Jun 13 00:40:28 2015 UTC,My first shipment of soylent came in today. I find it quite delicious.
soylent,39mulz,beardeddragonborn,2,Sat Jun 13 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"Same here! Like liquid bread to me, and I mean that in the best way possible. Tasted very good."
soylent,39mulz,iriey,5,Sat Jun 13 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"There was a 3 day period where I had no Soylent. I missed it so badly. Not sure if it was the flavor, the convenience, or the nutrition but when I was overjoyed to get my next shipment. Like...tearing open the box and making and drinking a cup immediately."
soylent,39mulz,Cheddarbek,5,Sat Jun 13 06:05:46 2015 UTC,They put electrolytes in it. Its what plants crave.
soylent,39mulz,TyraeKlouds,3,Sat Jun 13 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yep! I had a 3 week break because I didn't have enough before I left for a vacation and the whole time, even surrounded by yummy foods (big hot wing lover here), I still just wanted nothing more than some soylent."
soylent,39mulz,uselesslogin,3,Fri Jun 12 23:51:41 2015 UTC,I have 1.5 meals worth every day. I don't crave it on days I get my fix but the first time I went on vacation I thought I could leave it at home. That was tough...
soylent,39mulz,hikahia,2,Sat Jun 13 11:20:10 2015 UTC,"I've been having it for 2-3 meals a day for a little over a month now, and I'm starting to find that when I'm hungry, I specifically crave soylent and not other foods. It's interesting, but feels more like a normal food craving than an addiction :)"
soylent,39mulz,SparklingLimeade,2,Sat Jun 13 02:02:45 2015 UTC,It does have a certain allure. I think that after a few meals your body recognizes that it's an amazing food and decides to demand it when hungry.
soylent,39mulz,anothermomhere,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:56:16 2015 UTC,I feel this way about 1.4. If I have some each day I'm pretty good but I prefer it to a lot of food now.
soylent,39mulz,five___guys,-4,Sat Jun 13 22:36:57 2015 UTC,maybe it's just me but soylent makes me wanna puke. i have to force it down
soylent,39mulz,Skycakes,3,Sat Jun 13 08:14:00 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be forcing yourself to eat anything. You may have an allergy to one of the ingredients if it really makes you want to vomit.
soylent,39mulz,uselesslogin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:15:53 2015 UTC,Do you let it sit in the fridge overnight?

soylent,39mulz,xPerplex,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:41:53 2015 UTC,Are you consuming the entire batch within 2 days? it shouldn't sit longer than a couple days or it risks spoiling
soylent,39mulz,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,-4,Sun Jun 14 01:50:06 2015 UTC,God no. I crave everything but...
soylent,39ow7p,Poor_Snail,3,Sat Jun 13 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"So, UPS (canada at least) acts like a broker* and charges extra on top of import charges & duty. You should phone UPS and ask for an invoice to see what fees were added specifically regarding brokerage. You might be able to self-clear it - but I'm not quite sure how it works in the US."
soylent,39ow7p,Jackalyst,3,Sat Jun 13 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"When I bought 2 months the fee was $60 or something. It was kind of a bummer. Still worth it, still cheaper than others and I'm still happy with it, just...damn. I hope that demand reaches a point where they can open in the US and not have those charges."
soylent,39ow7p,dare_you_to_be_real,2,Sat Jun 13 16:24:06 2015 UTC,How can I prevent such a high fee for my next shipment?   Don't order from abroad. That's pretty standard on brokerage and customs fees for imported food.

soylent,39ow7p,ryanmercer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:00:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I thought the fee might be related to how many times my shipment was reviewed by customs.
soylent,39ow7p,ryanmercer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:48:59 2015 UTC,Food & supplements = expensive as far as brokerage & duties because of FDA involvement.

soylent,39o3f6,cmykInk,2,Sat Jun 13 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"It took me a week to be able to ignore the cravings, after a month I didn't have cravings, that's when I decided I'd eat solid food again. First off it hurt my stomach a lot, second, now I can't seem to stick to just Soylent. I can tell myself no solid food, but I find myself rationalizing it somehow then regretting my lack of self control. It sucks. I spend more money on food than ever."
soylent,39o3f6,DakAttakk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:26:51 2015 UTC,Plan to have solid meals then... If you know you can't resist then work with it. Alternate having solid lunch and solid dinner.   I find most breakfasts won't quench your cravings for solids very well so I don't bother eating anything but joylent. Breakfast cereal is just as boring as liquid meals IMO.
soylent,39o3f6,DakAttakk,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:05:23 2015 UTC,"Its just pleasure eating, I will accept it to a point, but I have to mitigate it. And really the reason I go for 100% Soylent is to stay healthy, it costs a lot of money, time, and effort to have a fully nutritional solid diet."
soylent,39o3f6,SparklingLimeade,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"The need to snack? Yes. It's pretty general.  More specifically I do feel like eating something when I know I should be full occasionally. At times like that a glass of water or a strip of beef jerky can suddenly make me feel stuffed. If those sorts of things aren't available or don't help, distraction always works when I can pull it off. Then again I can starve myself till I'm dizzy if I'm distracted so that may not count."

On days that I genuinely get lots of exercise, I tend to end up eating less, somehow, maybe 1800k. I've also been doing a lot of work around the house (remodeling the kitchen, mowing an acre with a push mower, etc), so my activity level has gone up a bit, as it usually does in June.  I'm 6'4"", and I was at 246 pounds when I started, which was the peak weight of my 44 years. I'm currently at 234, so my BMI is 28.5, down from 29.9, both of which are at the high end of ""overweight,"" but you wouldn't know it to look at me. I mean, I definitely don't look skinny, but I also don't look like I'm borderline obese, I don't think.  I don't know if it's a height issue or what, but according to the BMI charts I should weigh 204 pounds to be at the very peak of ""healthy"" weight. When I weighed 204 pounds (I was 6'4""/205 at 19) I looked like a scarecrow.   So I'm aiming for 220. If I can get lower, that's great, maybe 210 would be ideal for me, but again, I'm not doing this as a weight-loss program. I was mainly just curious what it would feel like to actually get the RDI of as much as possible, and damn, it feels good.  Some quick, easy recipes are to use curry powder with as much cayenne pepper as you personally like, plus a bit of salt and pepper in the magic bullet - there's a yellow curry recipe here somewhere, if you search for it, but even just plain curry powder makes a very nice flavor. It's a little odd without the rice, but we're getting used to that, right? :]  I've also had good luck with some canned crushed tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil and fresh cilantro. I've tried that one both warm and cold, and liked both.  I just made my first single-batch meal of 1.5 today (with a bunch of watermelon in the magic bullet), and the reduction in sweetness should help us savory people a LOT. This weekend I plan on sautéing up some onions and garlic and making a batch with those.  Basically, I would suggest trying whatever spices/herbs you usually like. Make a small batch in a magic bullet if you have one, and worst-case you're out a scoop of soylent. Best case,  you make your taste buds very happy."

I'm fairly skinny myself. I personally have taken Ritalin while on Soylent, and similar to Adderall but to a lesser effect, it makes me lose appetite. I find Soylent to be very valuable calories, there isn't a whole lot of wasted stomach space when it comes to Soylent. I definitely feel full from Soylent, its not quite a liquid that you can chug down, as you were saying.  It could certainly be an aid in your life, you would have to try it out to be sure. I only have a third of a bag a day for breakfast, which i drink throughout the morning, have a normal lunch, and drink the rest at around 3pm.

soylent,39l1oj,fn0000rd,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"Being ADD, I develop systems. Always have a stick of deodorant and shoes in the car. Recite the list of shit I need to have before I leave the house every time.  These days, part of my system is to always have some soylent in the fridge, ready to go. I always have some in a thermos with me when I leave the house.  It's funny, I'd recently started thinking about always keeping a pouch of it and a shaker bottle in the car, like I do with the deodorant. You don't drive, but a pouch and a shaker bottle in your locker might save you quite a bit.  I also think that the omega 3s/omega 6s will probably help you as well. When I first started getting daily omega 3s I didn't notice a difference, but I kept taking them, and over time it has really seemed to help. Maybe you need time to build up actual physical structure from it? Like a dendritic arch kind of thing? I dunno, but I feel like they helped my ADD.  Also, one of the big issues with being ADD is forgetting to eat, which makes you spacy. Soylent is a perfect, stable, habit-forming method of eating that can help you with that, IMHO.  I'm completely unmedicated now, after years of Ritalin -- a successful adult with a good career. I wouldn't trade my ADD for a ""normal brain"" any day. I had some really rough, skin-of-my-teeth years, but I made it out the other side, and have a great life now."

You'll have to do your own research on how to obtain it through legal means but it appears that VA allows for possession of marijuana if it's prescribed as medicine, but they don't have a medical marijuana system in place currently http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-251.1  edit: http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Drug_policy_of_Virginia#/Medical_use from this link it appears that while they may allow for the possibility of medical marijuana, in practice they never authorize it."

soylent,39hq6b,qwnp,2,Fri Jun 12 06:03:52 2015 UTC,"Probably not really... I find the flavours good at about 2% to 5%; but if you like really strong flavours you might want to go as high as 10%.  If using quite a powerful flavour like mint, you could probably get away with 0.5% to 1%.  So, at 2%, 4ml would flavour around 200ml of soylent.  Even at 0.5%, 4ml still only gets you a bit over 1 pitcher.  As I said, I don't think they're really economically viable to use in general for soylent, but it's a nice experiment when you happen to have them lying around and don't want to use them for anything else.  They make a more sense for baking (200ml of a gelatine cake topping for example is quite a few cakes); and a LOT more sense for e-cig liquid (I vape around 3ml to 5ml a day; so 200ml of flavoured liquid lasts me a month or two)."

It's also very satisfying to be able to budget $225 for food every month; I make many less trips to the grocery now, and that's only to pick up pet food and toiletries and whatnot. My blood pressure and cholesterol numbers were starting to get scary, so that's another motivational factor.  I supplement with whey and casein every other day when I lift weights and I'll have the occasional diet soda or sugarless gum, but that's it. I bought a second pitcher for days when I'm eating socially and the amount I drink goes out of whack, but that's not that often.  This reminds me, I gotta shake up my next batch..."

I probably eat two meals a week of non-soylent. Honestly I haven't had any negative side effects. I can switch back and forth with no problems. Even though I sip constantly through the day I can work on the or even two big meals if that's what I need to do, very handy when I'm on the road and don't have the option of what I eat."

I find I'm much less hungry when I'm eating Soylent as compared to regular food.  It's also extremely easy to track exactly how much of everything you're getting, so you don't need to do complicated charting or counting or multiply-the-fat-grams-by-9 or what have you."
soylent,39jcwi,BuffyCreepireSlayer,2,Fri Jun 12 03:49:17 2015 UTC,How does soylent work when you're trying to lose weight? I've never bought it but I want to use it to lose weight as well. I understand it is a powder. Do you put less powder? Is like a scoop equivalent to a certain amount of calories?
soylent,39jcwi,UrsusArctos,2,Fri Jun 12 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"It's pretty straight forward.  If you are dealing with a pouch of official Soylent that is 2,000 calories, you either split the powder into the amount you want, or mix it up and split the liquid into the amount you want.  The thing to keep in mind is that all of the nutritional information about 100% this 100% that is based off of consuming the whole pouch in a day.  If you decide to only eat half to reduce calories, yeah you get 1,000 calories instead of 2,000, but you also only get half the vitamins and minerals.  So, you may need to supplement with vitamins or what have you at that point.  Some non-official brands have recipes that aim for less than 2,000 calories.  Six one way, half a dozen the other.  And of course, like others have said, fewer calories in, more weight lost."

I put in my 1500 calories a day (200 calorie deficiency from what would be a healthy weight maintenance for my goal weight - and 500 calorie deficiency from maintaining my current weight).  If I still feel hungry at the end of the day I low carb/keto a meal.  Steak and lettuce, fish and asparagus, or something of the sort.    I'm slowly losing weight (about a pound a week) and I've been able to keep to this a lot better than any other calorie deficient diet.     Edit:  1500 calories of soylent - so easy to count and measure and eat."

You’re are right that the non-5 star reviews currently do not end up on the homepage. This was not something we intended, but a result of the review system we use: Yotpo. At first we hadn’t noticed because we actually get a lot of 5-star reviews. When we noticed we looked into changing this, but couldn’t find a quick solution to fix it (Yotpo doesn’t seem to support requesting the reviews with a specific ordering). And as we have lots of stuff to do it's still on our list. Of course this is a really lame excuse but its the truth. We’re really sorry for this!  edit: forgot some words  update: We've removed the reviews from the homepage until we can fix this properly. Again, sorry for the confusion. We love feedback and we would never want to stifle it, positive or negative!"

soylent,39f15i,phaed,7,Thu Jun 11 20:05:49 2015 UTC,I believe it.  Didn't make sense why Joylent would harm their reputation for such a short-sighted meaningless thing.

I personally don't know what the order system is but I can assure we do not hide ""unpleasant"" reviews. We, more than anybody, welcome any and all criticism. Furthermore, ""verified reviewers"" are just people that have logged in with their Facebook details, nothing more.

This post/thread should be a bug report, but it's dressed in moral outrage.  Edit: I think the bigger issue is the lack of sorting system in the UI of any kind. You literally do have to click page by page to find the lower reviews, which is pretty shitty. That actually makes me start to agree that this feels bury-ish.

After that is all unverified reviews using the same sorting. (Right now when I check page 18, the page starts with a 1 star verified review and after it are a bunch of 5 star unverified reviews).  Filtering and sorting options would fix this. Generally when I shop online I start by reading a couple of the good reviews and then immediately jump to the 1 star reviews to see if they sound like user error, shipping problems, or legitimate faults in the product. Depending on what I see there, I might look at some 2-4 star reviews to see if they talk about the same things in the 1 star reviews that sounded plausibly valid."

soylent,39h14c,14pp,3,Fri Jun 12 00:29:33 2015 UTC,Do you run them through the dishwasher? I've been using two separate bottles (hand-washed) for almost 4 years now with no leaks or cracks.

soylent,39h14c,mangomania42,3,Thu Jun 11 23:59:13 2015 UTC,you could use glass canning jars - I keep a 2L jar in the fridge. if you don't want to take the whole amount to work you could pour some into a 1L jar.  the jar won't break as long as you don't drop it onto cement.
soylent,39h14c,Bonneville865,3,Thu Jun 11 23:53:16 2015 UTC,Mason jars. Available at Target individually or you can get a flat of them so you can rotate through as you wash them. I actually prefer these now because I can mix and chill individual servings and they're much easier to clean in the dishwasher.
soylent,39h14c,Dirk-Killington,2,Fri Jun 12 01:31:24 2015 UTC,Try a different brand maybe? The ones I bought at GNC like 7 years ago are still doing fine.

I now use these in my soylent pitcher, and mason  jars, vacuum thermos or whatever lidded container I have for individual portions. A few shakes and my soylent is perfect.   I have a blender bottle but the lid is a pita though it hasn't cracked; it just requires an uncomfortable amount of strength for me to open/shut."

Haven't tried it yet, but this will definitely keep me away from Nutrilent. I can only confirm that the translation of the thread is correct, there is probably a good reason for this soy meal not being fit for human consumption."

soylent,39fjg6,SipaStyle,7,Thu Jun 11 13:29:50 2015 UTC,"Insane. If this is true he can face some serious jail time.   We spent months doing research, consulting experts and sitting down with big multinational companies to make sure our product was as perfect as possible. (...) We could not sell people this beautiful food without producing it with the utmost respect and the highest quality.   ""...months doing research"" Right. So they bought some dog food and figured out it wasn't meant for human consumption consulting the food experts on a tech website. Great research. Even if they didn't use it in the final products, this guy must have no clue what he is doing at all."
soylent,39fjg6,Nutrilent,-5,Thu Jun 11 12:15:37 2015 UTC,Please don't fall for this. The soy he's mentioning was 2kg which I ordered to test out and happened to be not suitable for humans. I was just asking around if there would be any problem if used it for testing.
soylent,39fjg6,Nutrilent,6,Thu Jun 11 13:00:06 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I would like to apologize for my reaction. I let my emotions take over which isn't the best thing to do in this line of work. The day this post was published I got a cancellation on 6 orders. This was before I even knew about it. Apparently this thread comes up third when googling for Nutrilent. Its not good for a business when the third google result says ""PSA: Nutrilent is not for human consumption!"". So when I got here I was very upset and couldn't control myself. This person made 2 accounts under 2 different usernames. One here and one on the Soylent forums. I actually know who this guy is and I know that this persons motive is to defame my company. I could even strike back by saying for which company he works but I wont. I acted very childishly and for that I would like to apologize.  Secondly, as most of you could have guessed there is nothing wrong with the soy we use. We were very lucky to have the resources to produce Nutrilent as professionally as possible. Our production is 100% automatic and we control every aspect of it. I would love to show you guys more of our production room since I am extremely proud of it but it will have to wait. We have hired a professional film crew that will capture every aspect of the production of Nutrilent and we will release the film in a couple of weeks.  I haven't been to the production room in a couple of days so I currently only have old pictures.  Here is a photo of the soy we use when it just arrived: http://i.imgur.com/ht5BDFp.jpg It's produced by this company http://www.lifrank.nl This is a photo of when we were filling shipping containers with soy: http://i.imgur.com/TxCYbRS.jpg  Why a shipping container? Well we stumbled upon a little problem. Our supplier told us to look out for something. Apparently oat flour and soy meal are like chocolate cake to mice. They absolutely love the stuff. So we talked with a lot of companies who work with these ingredients and they basically told us that we couldn't do much about it. We needed an easy and fast solution since the soy was arriving in a couple of days. We had some great ideas but a shipping container was the simplest. So we rented a couple of them and stored the ingredients in there.  It has been a great couple of weeks and everything is going better than expected. I guess it was about time something bad happened and I'm really ashamed of my reaction at that particular moment. I hope that I can win your trust back and I will make sure this happens never again.  PS: for the people accusing @DavidMcCarlie of being affiliated with us: He's not. David is simply a customer who loved the product and was defending it. I'm all in for skepticism but don't let it become paranoia and accuse people of things that don't even hold ground. Here is some proof of his order also: http://i.imgur.com/Sv3A3KF.png"
soylent,39fjg6,DavidMcCarlie,2,Sat Jun 13 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"Now the dust has settled a little, I actually feel quite sorry for Nutrilent. Coming from nowhere and competitively priced, they had a couple of favourable reviews, one being mine and within a couple of days a devastating post from someone who appears to have registered simply to cause mischief. I see that google now brings that post right to the top of a search and it's going to take a lot of work to try and recover from the damage that was done.  I was waiting until I had used up my Jake supply before ordering again from Nutrilent but to put my money where my mouth is, I just placed an order for 90 meals.  Let's hope we can all move on from this and have fair competition based on quality and value and not sabotage which is clearly what was intended with such a post."
soylent,39fjg6,Nutrilent,-2,Sat Jun 13 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"I have a small suspicion on who this guy is. First of all how pathetic of you to go through all this effort just to put me at a bad place.  It's pretty simple actually. I needed some soybean meal to test flavors etc. Ordered on some website. When the package came, it had a sticker on it saying not intended for human consumption. So I informed myself on a forum on how seriously I should take it. After their messages I never used it.  The 40.000 kg of soybean meal that we have stocked is manufactured for human consumption. The manufacturer is Soya Austria and I have all the lab reports. If anyone wants to have a look let me know.  Really nice try man. I'm glad there are enough people here who can see through your pathetic behavior."

I think your reactions to his posts are unsettling at best, highly suspicious at worst.  ""All this effort"" is basically just linking to posts you made, which is a completely valid thing to do and of course a question worth raising. You jump to personal attacks, calling him and his effort (for which I at least thank him) ""pathetic"", also insinuating that he for some reason would have sinister motives for posting this.  No matter if you actually used the categorie 3 soy in the end product or not, those posts are troubling, because they indicate that not only is your production process not monitored by a professional, you wouldn't even know where to find one, posting in a tech forum asking for nutritional help.  I also think it's kinda sketchy how OP and this thread is downvoted although the general consensus seems to be that he did nothing wrong - normally this community encourages scepticism. Edit: prior to posting the thread and OP was downvoted into the negatives while Nutrilent had half a dozen or so upvotes."
soylent,39fjg6,PsionicKitten,2,Thu Jun 11 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, the response is unsettling.  In business, if someone has a concern about your product and you turn around and make personal attacks to the person who had the concern, that sends a huge red flag.  The best practice is to release full disclosure on the issue, as to gain good faith with your customer base.  Now it just looks like some emotional, inexperienced person who doesn't care about his customer is just trying to sell whatever he can.  Would you trust this person to prepare your food?"
soylent,39fjg6,Gracksploitation,6,Fri Jun 12 19:37:47 2015 UTC,The 40.000 kg of soybean meal that we have stocked   Is that 40 metric tons? Do you really have 40 tons of soybean meal in storage? That seems like a massive investment for someone who was still trying out recipes 4 months ago. O_o

A little saltier than I expected, but that's not a bad thing, and it was the first ""soylent"" shake I had ever tried, so maybe my expectations were off.  Vanilla - really liked the taste, but I had bad milk burps.  I'm slightly lactose intolerant, don't know whether that was a factor.  I'll have to try it again sometime with a lactaid pill.  I didn't seem to have a problem with the other flavors.  Strawberry - Liked the taste, probably a little sweet for me, ever since starting keto, I've really lost my taste for sweet things.  Cookies & Cream - Good, nothing outstanding  Rich chocolate - A good mix, probably my other ""top 2""  I'm heavily broke at the moment, and have some unused Amazon Gift Cards burning a hole in my pocket, so I'm thinking about creating my own from his recipe, and then later when I can afford it, buying from him monthly."

We like the shakes on the thick side, so we never fill it up to the 28oz mark.  I prefer the Rich Chocolate. We also tried Cookies & Cream and Banana, but we weren't huge fans, plus they are more expensive than Chocolate and Vanilla.  I will add that adding coffee to the chocolate is also pretty good, and the thicker the mixture, the better, IMO."
soylent,39cq8n,CALibertarian,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:37:19 2015 UTC,Chocolate Mint and Strawberry were my favorites.  The strawberry was not too sweet and I liked it the best. I did not personally like the cookies and cream but taste is subjective.  I really did well on the Ketochow but had some personal health issues unrelated to the diet and I've still not been able to start back up.
soylent,39cq8n,stillhasmuchness,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm digging the vanilla (egg nog taste), and the strawberry (tastes like strawberry pocky.)  Didn't really dig the Chocolate Mint, and haven't tried the Chocolate itself just yet."
soylent,39cq8n,tjgrant,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"Cookies and cream is my favorite, it's similar to vanilla but even better, and tastes like a milkshake to me. Strawberry was my second least favorite I think because it just tastes so fake, and I couldn't finish pina colada (although I bet it would also be delicious if blender with real pineapple, that just defeats the purpose of keto). Vanilla, chocolate, toffee are all in the middle."
soylent,39cq8n,robotsneedlove2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"My favorite was and probably still is Chocolate Mint. It's tasty without being overwhelming.  I also like Cafe Mocha, which smells delicious, but doesn't really taste like anything. The blandness of it makes it easier to stay with it in a way.  I liked the Banana flavor, but it was a little thinner consistency for some reason, not sure why, and I prefer it to be a little thicker. This could probably be fixed by using less water.  Strawberry was good, but subtle. I added a couple strawberries into the blender and it was excellent.  I liked the Vanilla initially, but it kind of got old on me quickly.  Still have to try a few others, Cookies and Cream is next!"

soylent,39bj7b,tamen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:39:02 2015 UTC,Some of my ingredients are in pill form as well. I pulverize them in a coffee grinder and add them to the main powder.  You can see my recipe here: https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/h43  Some of the pills is cut down to one a week to not overdo that particular vitamin. I thought it better/easier to add it to the powder rather than have a weekly regiment of varying amounts of pills to eat each day.  Pulverizing the pills and adding it to the powder makes for more evenly supplied vitamins.  I don't do it with my D-Vitamin because it is a liquid as D-vitamin is disolved in some oil. Also I take a D-vitamin every day so it's easy to administer.

Oh sure, I'd love to comb the farmers market for fresh organic beets and goat cheese for a healthy lunch tomorrow, get the fixins for homemade fried chicken, find some new local nanobrew to pass around the dining table. But I've tried to find the time to plan a weeks worth of healthy, convenient meals, only to find that I'm sacrificing 3-5 ""relaxing"" weekend hours to make that happen, and in some cases overplanning, since ""social"" meals seem to happen with little more than a quick text.    This morning I walked out of the house with a blender bottle of premixed Soylent and two premeasured bags of powder. Tomorrow will be much the same, only after work I get to meet up with folks I like for food I want - not food I simply have to somehow procure to survive - and have a ""social"" meal. In the meantime, I have good nutrition, low cost, convenience and a surplus of time. I fail to see how that can be a bad thing."
soylent,395q4e,jd_edc,4,Tue Jun 9 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"Extremely well said.    I've found that after adding KetoSoy to my life I paradoxically enjoy preparing and eating elaborate meals much more.  My creative food energy is conserved for when I want to spend it, and as a result I am able to enjoy the creative food process so much more.  We produce out of a commercial kitchen, half the food trucks that are co-tenants with us eat our product.  You can love food and eat soylent.  It's not even that much of a contradiction when you really think about it."

But it's so much easier to love food when I only have to eat it when I really want to eat it, and I don't have to constantly worry about it.   It's similar to the difference between doing something as a hobby and doing it as a job. Making something obligatory sucks the fun right out of it."

I get some people's reactions, but I usually ask them to imagine never having to eat a crappy meal again - no more stale Subway, no more heatlamp burgers, no more subpar grease laden pizza, no more grab-n-go wilted salads, no more 4-hour old redipak California rolls from the deli, no more suffering thru the ""lite"" options of foods you like and wish you had instead.    My city has a huge foodie scene, legitimately delicious food is easy to find, but you can't eat a $12 duck confit mac-n-cheese 28 times a week, because you'd die or go broke. But if all your ""real food"" meals were delicious, unique, relaxed ""social"" outings or fun, creative, experiments in your own kitchen...that'd be awesome right?

Soylent, as a product and as a concept, is at a very critical inflection point right now WRT societal perception. Tesla is a little further along the curve, and is a good example to go by. This would be equivalent to Tesla making a campaign trying to tear down Ford/Toyota/Honda/etc.  IOW, it misses an opportunity to talk about the great things about your product!  There's so much positive you can market to. People want to eat healthy but most don't like eating their veggies. People don't like going grocery shopping because it's a time-consuming chore. People like having a 5 minute Soylent lunch that lets them get their work done sooner and leave work earlier. Most people don't like all the prep and hassle involved with cooking.  People want to save time, save stress/hassle, and eat healthier. Soylent is such a huge win. Focus on that.  There is so much great stuff to focus on here.  Please don't put the focus on the people that aren't (yet) your customers (""sad lunch""), but instead keep the focus on your customers and all the great changes they've had in their life with Soylent as a part of it!"

So I would say 1.5 is a better blank slate for flavoring options, maybe not as good as a straight drink.  It's still pretty close to 1.4 though, so I would say if you liked 1.4, you will like 1.5.  If you didn't like 1.4, you won't like 1.5.  1.4 was my first version so I can't compare to previous entries."

I get that to a slightly thick consistency (not so thick that it's difficult to stir), then add the oil (one Ketosoy scoop) and mix the hell out of that.  It should be somewhere between watery and pasty. It should have the texture of a slightly-melted milkshake.   Cold water! Always cold water. Honestly I just use a pint glass and a spoon.

If you don't want to lose muscle (which helps you increase your TDEE and look better at the same weight), you might want to consider adding some whey protein or something. Source: http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/protein-intake-while-dieting-qa.html/   After much toing and froing and research had been done it was eventually found that a protein intake of about 1.5 g/kg of lean body mass (LBM; note that researchers actually used Ideal Body Weight but this is a rough proxy for LBM) was necessary to spare LBM losses in a non-training obese individual consuming low calories.  This is about double the DRI for protein (at 0.8 g/kg) at maintenance calories.  So for an overweight individual at say 200 pounds and 30% body fat (this would give them an LBM of 140 lbs or 63 kg), that would be a protein intake of 95 grams of protein per day.   Please note that this value is simply a minimum and dieters may still find that higher protein intakes are beneficial from a hunger blunting effect or what have you (see below)."

soylent,3988qp,dudesire,14,Tue Jun 9 23:34:42 2015 UTC,You can live off Soylent. The reason we don't push that is because to many customers jump on %100 and burn themselves out. It's always better to move into Soylent at a gradual pace. We are trying to move away from the message that has apparently become the norm that Soylent is an all or nothing proposition. That once you start you cannot have 'food'. Much of this thought process is pushed by media outlets exclusively living off Soylent for 1 month to do a review.   Apologies if my comment caused any confusion.
soylent,3988qp,Soylentconor,-4,Tue Jun 9 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"Right I am aware of all of that - but your comment combined with the recent nutrition changes seems to suggest otherwise. And in general, why have you reduced fiber and increased carbs / sugar?"

soylent,3988qp,Soylentconor,3,Wed Jun 10 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"But we don't have much of a baseline for required fiber in a powdered diet. It is essential for helping things move along and with digestion and maintaining a healthy gut biome. But it isn't removed, just reduced. They do have at least one medical professional on staff that they list, so it isn't on a whim."
soylent,3988qp,Kharthak,-7,Wed Jun 10 00:28:29 2015 UTC,"Everything I've read has pointed to generally more fiber is better, within reason. Considering the DRI is not targeted to maximizing health but having a baseline, the fiber content being far lower means it is likely to the unhealthier end. Every historical and epidemiological perspective considers fiber today terribly low. And direct experiments themselves even more so. Arguments otherwise are leaning towards ""well we can survive so why does it matter"" theme"
soylent,3988qp,BuffyCreepireSlayer,3,Wed Jun 10 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that I wouldn't be happy with more, but that I hope their reasoning is sound. It seems like it should follow that without all of the excess that typical eating normally has, the body would need less help digesting it but this really is a pioneer venture.

soylent,3988qp,Mutand1s,-6,Wed Jun 10 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but it seems like they are progressing down an actually dangerous slippery slope. Its easy to cheapen and superficially improve the product and get more customers and still have that position of it being ""healthier than the average american diet""... because thats a really easy accomplishment.

I've gained about 1 kg of weight since I started replacing one meal a day with shakes. I'm going to try to go with smaller portions and see if it still keeps the feeling of hunger away."
soylent,394xko,unsafeword,-1,Tue Jun 9 11:21:36 2015 UTC,100 surplus calories a day is gaining about 10 pounds per year.
soylent,394xko,SparklingLimeade,3,Tue Jun 9 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"To make my statement more clear at the expense of some verbosity: A difference of 100 calories is small compared to the overall scale of possible metabolic rates possible in a single person, much less the metabolisms of all people. Additionally, the amount of food that 100 calories represents is fairly small and so altering intake by that amount is a simple act with no likelihood of causing unexpected repercussions. Lastly, I would also consider 100 calories to be easily within the margin of error for simple metabolism calculations and calorie counts so you may not be as far off as the initial data suggests.  100 calories is not a big deal."
soylent,394xko,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:42:53 2015 UTC,"Am I really that inactive a person compared to most?    Is that counting kcals used while sleeping? Your weight in pounds x13 is a decent quick estimate on the kcals you'd be using as someone that does minimal physical activity every day, toss in some exercise an hour or four a week and bump it to 14. So yeah the 1800-1900 sounds about right."

soylent,3935af,lothtekpa,2,Mon Jun 8 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"Go to the outdoors section of your local superstore and buy a Thermos that can hold at least 1000 ml (two servings). You want to keep Soylent cold in order to keep that thicker consistency that will keep you full. I have a serving for breakfast, sip the Thermos at work, and have my final serving for dinner. Sipping at Soylent during the day allows you to maintain consistent blood sugar, so yes. Soylent is already fairly thick, so blending anything in it will make it moreso. A packet full of Soylent is 2000 calories, so figure out what your calorie load is per day. You will need to supplement protein, which I assume you already do. Some people mix protein powder in with their Soylent, but I prefer to drink it straight. You may want to also consider a pre-workout supplement to get you through your workouts; just watch out for dangerous ingredients in some of those.   Give yourself time to adjust to Soylent; you will probably crave some of your regular foods the first couple weeks. It's okay to indulge yourself, but eventually you'll want to go all Soylent, to save money and just generally feel better. Good luck!"
soylent,3935af,PirateNinjaa,2,Tue Jun 9 00:33:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everything. I've got a solid thermos that I'll use, and a protein supplement in addition sounds great.  Regarding question 2 -- what if I don't sip all day, but instead treat the majority of the serving like a meal? I.e. 500 calories at once? Do you have any experience with that? I feel like the liquid nature wouldn't feel so heavy, and may not result in a crash, but I'm not sure how it would work for a large serving."
soylent,3935af,jd_edc,2,Tue Jun 9 02:52:02 2015 UTC,"To each their own. The closest I come to ""chugging"" Soylent is when I have it in the morning, and even then, I have to down it in a series of sips - the consistency is just too rich for me. I don't recall ever ""crashing"" from drinking it.   2000 calories is at the low end of what someone my size needs every day, so I'd probably crash on workout days if I wasn't supplementing with whey and casein (which technically makes my diet lacto-vegetarian instead of vegan, but that's still a big improvement over the way I used to eat.)"
soylent,3935af,nano_green_banana,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:25:55 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks again for all your help. And yeah I should do fine on overall caloric load since I'll be eating regular food for dinner and taking a post-workout protein shake.
soylent,3935af,Smackugood,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:40:48 2015 UTC,I feel like the liquid nature wouldn't feel so heavy   just remember what normal food looks like when you swallow it after chewing.

The instructions do tell you to refrigerate it overnight, so the people at Soylent seem to prefer that as well. I've tried it sans overnight refrigeration, and it goes down much more like a liquid than a shake. Not as filling.  Soylent is still young enough that there's not a ton of ""sourcing""; the community is much of what we have to go on. You may be lucky enough to be getting version 1.5, depending on when you ordered it. You'll have to let us know what you think, if that's the case."

soylent,39251e,be_bo_i_am_robot,12,Mon Jun 8 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to see the progress of people using Soylent for an extended period of time, you can find some example on the sidebar, where it says ""Firsthand Experience Logs"" (under DIY & Useful Info). Use your mouse over ""Rosa Lab's Soylent"" to see the blogs of people who've tried it before.  This might not be what you're exactly looking for. All of the people on the list have ended their intakes of Soylent very suddenly, or have only planned to take it for a certain period, not continuously.  Another problem is that many of these blogs and recordings are prior to introduction of Soylent 1.4 to the public. This is significant because Soylent 1.4 marked the change in the preparation of Soylent, and led many to ""quit"" using Soylent because of its new ""saltier"" taste. Although it was never officially mentioned by him, it can be inferred that Youtube user ""IAmSoylent"" ended his video logs after trying 1.4.  This product has not been officially approved by the FDA for continuous consumption (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm getting this info from Soylent documentaries back from 1.0), but the owner of Rosa Labs, Rob Rhinehart, says that this product is safe for consuming for an extended period of time. Although I don't have any records to link to you, I have watched videos of people trying it, and most have recorded having a healthier body and losing weight. Others complained that they were having sodium deficiencies, but that was solved with 1.4. I suggest searching results on /r/soylent through the search bar.  Although my entire post might to detract you from Soylent, I want to say that Soylent is a marvelous product, and many views can differ from each other, so give it a try. Don't make the same mistake as many have: diving straight into Soylent.  Many reviewers of Soylent completely switch to drinking Soylent 24/7 upon the box's arrival, and they assume that mixing it and drinking it immediately is a good idea. It's suggest that the consumer should mix their Soylent as directed, then place it in the fridge overnight to settle. Make sure to small increments of Soylent for your first few weeks of consumption. Use it for a single meal, perhaps breakfast or lunch, then increase your consumption to two meals in the following weeks/months, then three meals, and so on. Most people choose to permanently use it a single meal, instead of using it for the entire day.  Flavor also plays a key role in Soylent. As I mentioned before, Soylent 1.4, contains a ""saltier"" taste, according to long-time customers. The reason behind this was the problems with Soylent regarding sodium deficiency. Soylent 1.5 was recently unveiled by Rosa Labs, but I'm not sure if they've solved the issue regarding the salty taste, yet. If you continue to use Soylent with no variation, the taste will be repetitive, and will draw you away, just like it did to Alex Tanner. It's important that you make sure to flavor your Soylent with whatever your heart desires. Bananas? Your favorite flavored protein powder? Nutella? Go crazy. The only issue is the added calories of these extra ingredients. A day's worth of Soylent is 2,000 calories, but the required daily caloric intake for a male between the ages of 20 and 40 (who is physically active) is around 2,500 calories, so as long as you don't go over the 2,500 calorie mark, you should be fine."

This is also a personal preference, and some don't like it like that, but many do.  If the pb is too sticky/messy to mix up, just nuke (microwave) it by itself, first, so it starts melting, then mix it in. Or try PB2, powdered peanut butter.    And realise that you're no longer eating 500 calories. A spoonful of pb and a banana can add about 100 calories each."

As others have pointed out, many blenders' bases can be used with mason jars as well. You can fit around 24 of those (6 columns of 4) in the top rack of a typical dishwasher, which makes cleanup dead simple.

I spent a lot of time reading every ""Month long 100% Soylent!"" blog/article/report I could find and it's mostly just..

You might want to take a different angle. Maybe spend that $2000 on a month supply and follow someone who is starving or a homeless person and get before and after tests on their nutrition. idk  But hey if you want to do that, I'm a college student and have been eating roughly 1 meal a day for most of my life and am soon to start on soylent. heh"

I've also gained several pounds (very difficult for me) since starting a 90% Soylent diet, however that could very easily be a coincidence.  I would consult your specialists and have them review each ingredient in Soylent to make sure they don't see any red flags, then order a week's worth and see how you fare."

Just for my own piece of mind I don't leave in there for more than four days but I think you could do five or maybe six days without issue. I only drink Soylent for breakfast so making a full bag and leaving it in for three or four days has never been an issue.

soylent,390gfm,DavidMcCarlie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"The European versions are quite different from Soylent, their development has been much less innovative and iterative (most of them are just variants of the oats n whey meal replacement formula which has been available from diet shakes and bodybuilding supplement vendors for decades).  There's a fairly decent explanation of the difference in ingredient quality here: http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/31unfz/whats_with_the_price_difference_between_soylent/  Right now, if you want something that fits the bill of Soylent in Europe (a long-term alternative to standard foods), your best bet is to DIY or use a reshipping service (expect to pay about 75% extra in fees on top of whatever the Soylent costs)  If it's just for the occasional meal replacement, Jakeshake (the only one in Europe who have outsourced their production to a proper food supplement manufacturer), Mana, Joylent etc will be OK."

One good thing is that I've never had anyone report getting keto flu using keto chow, guess the electrolyte levels are good.   Tip: mix up as many blender bottles as you have on hand at a time to take advantage of economies of scale. Make sure you shake them up a few minutes later and maybe even a third time so the psyllium husk doesn't have a chance to clump before becoming fully hydrated.   Weigh yourself and take a couple pictures. You'll be glad you did later."

The coconut oil I'm using which is manufactured by Carrington Farms, the same company but not the same bottle as you show on your website is making it difficult to enjoy. I'm blending my shakes and night and putting them in the fridge, however the coconut oil is solidifying and making it very enjoyable. Does the bottled version you linked from amazon solidify as well? If it does, could it be supplemented with more whipping cream? Thanks! btw this stuff is more delicious than I expected."
soylent,38z52q,omgitsvenom,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:36:17 2015 UTC,You have to either:   Get the one that's liquid coconut oil mix some canola or other oil into the normal (solid at room temperature and more-so when refrigerated) when it's heated so it will stay liquid Get MCT oil.   The liquid Coconut oil is kinda in between the regular coconut oil and MCT oil as far as what's in it; they removed some of the fatty acids and it ends up liquid. I used to buy the liquid stuff at my local wal-mart but lately I've been using a massive 64oz bottle of MCT that ended up being slightly cheaper per day.

Queal indeed happens to contain no GMOs based solely on the fact that all of our ingredients are European-sourced and the EU is extremely stringent with their GMO regulations. The reason we include this on our site is because we are aware that many of our customers (who are European) do care about consuming GMO-free products, so why not let them know that we (incidentally) offer this.

Now looking forward to trying it :)  Well, yeah, I understand you're simply responding to consumer demands in our society. Still, I worry about baseless trends, and the ""GMO-free"" is one, and it's growing. But it's especially futile here in Europe where, as you say, GM crops are virtually absent anyway, and if present, are strictly labeled.  I also understand it's hardly the job of a commercial company to change mentalities. But hey, if Ben & Jerry's can propagate fear and confusion about biotech, companies that take a stance to do the opposite are, sadly, lacking... I'd be one in a million, but I would instantly support a product that said something like ""we're not afraid of GMOs"". One day, maybe."

It could very well have disastrous consequences if not properly regulated, but we europeans rock at regulating."

soylent,38zp2b,intisun,2,Mon Jun 8 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"As snakeofsilver suggested, try letting it sit for a few hours.  I usually mix mine up the night before I want to start it.  So, first portion is consumed about 8 hours after mixing.  Last portion, 4 days max to avoid spoilage.  This probably isn't an issue, since you mentioned no matter how you stir you have the powder issue, but make sure you add some water to your container of choice, then powder, and then top off with water.  Going powder first, then water, always left a small portion of compacted powder at the bottom of my shaker bottles.  Shaking and/or stirring wouldn't always do the trick.  No problems since I started adding water first."

soylent,38xb9w,PirateNinjaa,3,Sun Jun 7 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"Did you switch ""cold turkey"" or transition slowly? What made you stop using Soylent?  Thanks for your time! :)"
soylent,38xb9w,PirateNinjaa,2,Sun Jun 7 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"if you are addicted to food mentally, cold turkey might be best, if you have had a bad diet, if you go cold turkey you might have physical symptoms like headaches and such, so must slowly transition.  I transitioned slowly, but noticed I craved food the least on days I was 100%.  I haven't stopped using soylent."
soylent,38xb9w,PirateNinjaa,2,Mon Jun 8 08:15:21 2015 UTC,"Physically I feel way better: no more stomach pain, higher energy levels, more interested in physical activity. I'll have to see what the headaches do - I tend to have cluster headaches, but they were not triggered yet."

soylent,38xb9w,Pokebalzac,5,Mon Jun 8 13:01:23 2015 UTC,"Some junk foods have borderline addictive qualities, so you can expect a period of adjustment (""withdrawal"") on stuff like cravings.  I took a long break from coffee at the same time I started Clean Fuel and it was a bit rough for similar reasons.  24 hours is not very long, you could have a couple of smaller snacks to ease the process or just tough it out, up to you!"

The supermarket is a small walk through the forest, so I'd always say ""you finish this part of work, then you treat yourself to a nice walk to get a snack"", often a few times a day.  I'm thinking about investing in running gear and switching the snack walks for power walks :)"
soylent,38xb9w,checkup21,2,Mon Jun 8 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"The first week I mostly drank joylent I was craving mostly fatty protein rich foods, like smoked salmon, sausage or steak. It was so extreme I felt like I would starve, until I finally gave in. The second week the craving got weaker and the third week it was almost gone.  Now I sometimes indulge in some junkfood (the good kind), eat in a restaurant or cook something really good whenever I want something tasty (not that joylent tastes bad, but it only covers the sweet side of the spectrum), but not out of sheer craving."

Now I'm on Soylent and protein shakes almost exclusively.  Make sure you let your Soylent batch sit overnight in the fridge before drinking-- gives you a much more ""full"" feeling than if you drink it immediately after preparing it.  Best of luck -- I was starting to flunk blood pressure and cholesterol tests, so switching to Soylent and sticking with it is a big motivator."
soylent,38y3wd,JadelyJade,5,Sun Jun 7 20:51:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to write this review! Anxiously waiting for mine to arrive - I also have a hard time meeting my daily caloric requirements so I'm sure this will help!   Did you feel any increase of energy then you normally do?
soylent,38y3wd,TriaBow,4,Mon Jun 8 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"Wow,  This is a such a thorough review. I'm actually surprised that people aren't minding the taste (even liking it) - and that the texture is still so highly rated (by that, I mean not 3/10). Really, in order to have a proper blend - this is something that needs a blender - for now.   As much as I can surmise personally, I drink it because it's healthy, but the texture has gotten to me a little so now I'm somewhat dependant on adding flavour packets from Canadian protein (I am texture sensitive so that may be an issue). The extra energy is good, and the consistency of diet is good (because I miss way too many meals without this, to a scary degree). I actually enjoy the ability to ""easily"" make pancakes out of them, to change the pace a little - and because I love pancakes.  Next time ordered there will be instructions - that along with the site (and recurring orders) was the update this weekend. I think I may have assumed some things by not including instructions!  All in all I'm enjoying the reviews coming in with pictures (lots of them!), and I'm listening more (though talking less these days)."

soylent,38yu1w,fn0000rd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, most people are in a constant state of dehydration. If you only drink water after you start to feel thirsty, this might be true for you. In which case, once you start to become better hydrated, your body will begin getting rid of the ""water weight"" it was hanging on to while you were dehydrated. Which might be why you have frequent urination.  In general terms, you want your urine to be a very light yellow. If it's a distinct yellow or darker, you aren't drinking enough water."

Just like one last bit of innocence that wasn't knocked out.  The only part of pee that comes directly from what you ingest is water. If drinking one liter of water more than normal is making you pee constantly, I'd recommend seeing a doctor."

I even occasionally use the vanilla in my.. vanilla flavoured keto chow... but mostly I use caramel and lemon, actually. Good way to mix it up. If the joylent reacts like keto chow, do not try cinnamon powder, horrible lumpy mess resulted."
soylent,38wema,realthecaffiend,2,Sun Jun 7 15:36:49 2015 UTC,Carmel and lemon? I should try that too. Where did you get those? I'm not finding them searching Google

They're not sweetened, so it just gives huge flavor for 1/4 teaspoon for 1.5l of Joylent.   I've had success with raspberry, marshmallow, sweet cream, apricot, and peach. I have yet to try black berry, red velvet cake, orange cream, or eggnog. Lemon custard was a total loss."

Flavour  As for flavour, I usually add 4-5 grams of sweetener and a dash of salt. For the vanilla flavour I also add some cinammon.  Make them the day before and let it rest overnight. Some flavours need time to diffuse properly.  Texture  Dunno if it helps though I generally have my joylent through a straw.. I don' t really mind the texture all that much, maybe you should try adding more water."
soylent,38vbs0,misterrunon,7,Sun Jun 7 03:28:57 2015 UTC,"I've been a long time customer of Joylent now and I'll agree they've had a lot of problems over the time.  That said though, they're still the absolute best taste, quality, and price that I've come across.  I do believe that many of their problems have been ""growing pains"" and while we're probably not out of the woods yet, I do think they'll get it all sorted eventually."
soylent,38vbs0,dalebewan,3,Sun Jun 7 08:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can forgive all the other issues.. but the last straw for me is the taste. There's no information or disclaimer that their formula is different, and now the product makes me want to gag.  I feel like I went through all of this shit (1 month of waiting without word, having to send them multiple e-mails, having to pay UPS $10 for the overweighing, and now not getting a scoop/cup that I was supposed to receive) to get a product that makes me want to gag.  Message to Joylent: If you really want to get big, you need to clean up your act."
soylent,38vbs0,DuzAwe,2,Sun Jun 7 09:43:57 2015 UTC,add salt...seriously. It makes them taste more like they did originally also mix and drink straight away.

soylent,38vbs0,Lucius_Martius,2,Mon Jun 8 07:45:18 2015 UTC,"I got sent my 90 meal shipment twice. After pointing out their mistake to them they offered me a discount from 150€ to 110€ if I kept the second box, which I took. Both boxes didn't include the (free) scoop I ordered with it but that's fine because I already had a scoop from my Veetal order.  So yes, it seems like they haven't got their logistics straight, but they are decent people with a fast and accommodating customer service.  That all was before the recipe change though, I am not sure if I will buy again if it tastes as horrible as people say. I will probably try out a 30 meal package but there is also the similar Purelent I am very anxious to try out."

soylent,38w0p3,DavidMcCarlie,3,Sun Jun 7 08:25:12 2015 UTC,"I can't fathom why so many newer European soylent producers are simply copying the oats n whey formula, as seen in numerous bodybuilding meal replacements,diet shakes etc. and Joylent.  Joylent, like it or not, has already got that market cornered.  Some enterprising Europe-dweller should produce something which actually resembles the Soylent formula (rice protein, algae oil etc.) and shares the focus on avoiding allergens, digestibility and minimising environmental impact.  I'm probably not alone in saying I'd pay good money for that."
soylent,38w0p3,ImmaculateJackson,2,Sun Jun 7 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Diversity and competition is always good, I guess, but Joylent costs only half of what 1food charges and seems to be the same.  I like that they're far more serious in their marketing than Joylent - but I hate how they're claiming that ""genetic engineering"" == ""bad and unhealthy"". The soylent movement is, at least in my opinion, also about making informed decisions and promoting a sustainable way of producing and consuming food. Without genetic engineering, there is no way we could sustain the world's population. I'd rather give my money to someone who does not spout anti-scientific rethorics."

soylent,38uc8k,MontyTheMooch,2,Sat Jun 6 22:14:14 2015 UTC,Just placed my first order since 1.0. Looking forward to it. Did they change the scoop size?
soylent,38uc8k,play150,3,Sun Jun 7 00:58:11 2015 UTC,A while back.  I'd highly recommend getting a cheap gram scale on Amazon and just measuring.
soylent,38uc8k,play150,2,Sun Jun 7 01:45:12 2015 UTC,Sounds good! I just wish the protein and fiber didnt get cut (again) :c
soylent,38uc8k,play150,4,Sun Jun 7 09:14:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the protein, but the consensus about the fiber is that you dont need as much on a fluid diet. I'm all for 100% but not at the expense is reason and science."
soylent,38uc8k,zylli42,-1,Sun Jun 7 17:23:41 2015 UTC,Personally I find that I need to supplement Soylent with fiber to stay regular. when I don't stay regular I immediately start breaking out. It's happened a few times and it's like a switch.   No fiber -> no regularity -> start breaking out straight away.  I think fiber is probably still important on a liquid diet for the sake of its other health benefits like the production of short chain fatty acids in the gut and anti-inflammation.   I remember there was an interview somewhere showing that the reduction of fiber was made to address gas issues amongst Soylent users
soylent,38uc8k,play150,2,Mon Jun 8 02:30:25 2015 UTC,Personally I find that what I need is to remember to drink more water.   Fiber was one of the things that they did to reduce gas. They also took out some ingredients and reduced the amount of oat flour (which is known for gas).
soylent,38uc8k,deathteat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:55:36 2015 UTC,I've always wondered about water! But drinking soylent already covers that aspect for me haha (I drink soylent at a 4:1 water:powder ratio)

soylent,38smj6,TheHumpalot,4,Sat Jun 6 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"Just tried it - mixing exactly as stated. 3.5 scoops to 500ml of water. Only just fits in the shaker. Without refrigerating first, I'd say it tastes fine. In fact easier than before, less bitty but maybe the amount of water to mix it with is more. I was previously doing 3 scoops to the 600ml line of the shaker."

Unlike the silver pouch, the powder doesn't get into the zip mechanism while the pouch's being filled so it zips back shut perfectly.  On the other hand, the opening on the side is too small to use the scoop directly into the pouch. Either way, it's nice that they're working on packaging. That said, packaging has been fine for a while now and it's the least of my worries. I'd prefer they work on producing Joylent that tastes the same every month. ಠ_ಠ"

soylent,38sybz,dejayjohn,8,Sat Jun 6 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'm in Europe, but I've tried both. Soylent is very neutral in its flavor, made so to make it as easy as possible to flavor it as you want to yourself. Joylent comes flavored (Starberry, Banana, Vanilla or Chocolate as of today). I personally preferred Joylent, but it's down to personal preference really.  Nutrients are quite similar, aiming for 100% RDI of everything, but they differ in what they use to provide it. Soylent has a more ""advanced"" formula that arguably might be considered ""better"", but I prefer the already flavored Joylent.  Shipping from Soylent should be faster and cheaper if you're in the US, since they ship from there (no customs fees) but Joylent seem to ship pretty fast too, but at a cost (Soylent is free shipping).  Kind of hard to tell which you'll prefer or if either will help you, easiest is probably to buy a small pack from both and compare yourself."
soylent,38sybz,snakeofsilver,-6,Sat Jun 6 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"Soylent doesn't aim for 100% of everything anymore - it's now high sugar*, high fat, low protein and low fiber.   Or high-carb, if you want to take their position that the sugars they use aren't really sugar."

soylent,38sybz,googlyeyespy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that the body seems to adapt well to a variety of diets and benefits from them e.g. Low carb for epilepsy and now for people who like ketosis. You read anything published before or around it and they make it sound like carbs are essential. You watch TV and it sounds like dairy is the only source of calcium. There is quite a difference between what the body needs to maintain itself and what is recommended. The minimums don't seem to change very drastically, but what doctors recommend can be influenced by what they were taught and how old that knowledge is as well as who is paying them. It's not malicious, it can often just seem like they are saying there is only one way to eat and we have seen that to be very wrong."
soylent,38sybz,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, but aren't you just arguing against Soylent here? Which offers a specific and comparatively inflexible dietary intake?  When we're discussing the average RDA for a healthy person, especially in the context of a single fixed ratio food source, we are intentionally ignoring personal optimal variation on the norm.  And again, you still seem to be minimising the scientific establishment's consensus on RDA by suggesting they aren't in disagreement, by describing them as ""some"" and associating them to TV dairy adverts. Though I guess on the dairy front you're pretty spot on in the US, where there's dispute amongst the scientific community and the FDA over how much milk children should drink (not so related to RDA but still)."

If by saying that nutrition can be varied is what you mean by arguing against soylent, I guess. I'm perfectly happy with whatever they have chosen to do so far. I'm happy they aren't focused on what the average consumer thinks is healthy yet and don't bow too much to anything other than taste and easibility of consumption. The fact that they don't need to follow one path of nutrition is great, I mean across the board micros are pretty similar, it seems to just be the macros that can have some variability to them. I think that is a bonus to soylent as it allows them to be flexible and try new things."
soylent,38sybz,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"Who's arguing against Soylent? Excluding when you pointed out that dietary intakes vary significantly, I don't see anything that would be critical of the product."

I ordered a 1 week mixed pack, so I could try all the flavors.  I ended up not liking any of the 4 flavors, and finishing each bag was a struggle (just finished on Thursday).  I'm happy to be back to Soylent 1.4 and looking forward to try 1.5.  Joylent shipping to the US was a tad expensive ($30), which put it inline with the cost of a single week of Soylent.  However, since it is being imported to the US, UPS will send you a bill later for import tax (mine was $10).  In all, my 1 week experiment with Joylent cost $100.  I'm not sure how the import tax scales with larger shipments of Joylent."

Just eat chicken breast or something else healthy and high in protein daily. You wouldn't need vitamin supplements. You get all that from the soylent. Just need the extra calories and protein.

I personally have been drinking Soylent since 1.1 and found 1.4 to be by far the worst tasting version, basically undrinkable without adding something else to it for flavor. The previous versions had subtle amounts of vanilla or cocoa flavor, but this one tastes like drinking oat paste.  1.5 was just released, so maybe give that one a shot."

It didn't fully dissolve and tasted so bad (both the drink and all the crunchies). Now I add tons of water and 2-4 tablespoons of chocolate syrup to make it palatable. Still doesn't taste good in anyway but can get it down.   Edit 2 - I checked my bag and have one of the infamous ""C"" lot batches. What is yours?"

Helps increase your water intake so shouldn't be bad.  Two as I just found out just now, not letting it sit overnight in the fridge stops the slime texture."

soylent,38sr1e,Vladamir_PoonTang,3,Sun Jun 7 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"So, generally it's 3.5 scoops per bottle, as three bottles of this is a full bag. It's up to you really, i like 4 meals of 2 scoops.  Try blending in some strawberries to enhance the taste, usually I just put an extra scoop and less water.  It will take awhile for you to get used to the feeling of not being ""full"". Try a day with only Joylent and maybe some chewing gum for something to chew on. This will give you a good idea about not being hungry, but not exactly being full either. 6 scoops is a bit excessive, especially if you're eating solid foods aswell.  A little bit of water, then joylent, then water again helps stop the powder sticking to the bottle.  Some people like coffee Joylent, others just but the cappuccino flavored one on the website. I only ever use water. :)  If you mix it and drink it straight away it will feel grainy. What I do is drink one, then immediately make the next one and stick it in the fridge. After I drink that one, I make another and put it in the fridge. I find it much more pleasant after its been in the fridge for a few hours. :)  Enjoy!"

Sometimes I might skip breakfast and lunch completely, and eat a huge meal when I get home, and yesterday when I did that with Joylent (~5 scoops) I had to eat a hefty meal an hour later because I felt tired and hungry, does it just take longer for Joylent to digest or did I eat too little of it?  How long does Joylent stay edible in a shaker during the summer? e.g. can I take a shaker filled with Joylent (Joylent+water) with me and eat it 4-6 hours later or does it spoil before that?"
soylent,38sr1e,chrisevans1001,4,Sat Jun 6 14:52:13 2015 UTC,"You just need to eat more regularly. 3 x 3.5 scoops of Joylent a day, spaced out, if perfect for the average person. After a few days you will barely notice not being ""full"". What most people do is eat joylent for breakfast and lunch and then eat a solid food dinner.  As for how long it lasts, I'm not sure. I would be alot more confident in bringing the water and joylent separate and mixing it on the spot, than carrying around a bottle of it mixed for a few hours in the summer."
soylent,38sr1e,chrisevans1001,3,Sat Jun 6 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"3.5 scoops in 500ml of water is what the latest packaging recommends.

Soylent has fiber, so that next paragraph is pointless.     Protective substances. Whole foods contain other substances important for good health. Fruits and vegetables, for example, contain naturally occurring substances called phytochemicals, which may help protect you against cancer, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Many are also good sources of antioxidants — substances that slow down oxidation, a natural process that leads to cell and tissue damage.     Phytochemicals are not essential, there have been studies showing potential of some to have beneficial effects but this is by no means a reason you should be adding them to a product people consume daily.

Are there things a body needs that we get through a regular diet that Soylent lacks because of its precision? Soylent at the very least appears entirely safe for replacing a meal or two.

What is not understood that well are some other aspects of nutrition:   What are acceptable sources for the nutrients we need that in turn do not provide any health risks on their own? What optional substances provide real health benefits? What effects have common and uncommon deseases and conditions on required nutrition?   Obviously those are much harder to study and much harder to provide definitive answeres for. And so far it basically is a personal guessing game as to what fulfills these aspects better, food that's chemically as pure and as simple as possible, or diverse ""natural"" food that contains a multitude of additional substances (natural or artificial) that may or may not be beneficial or detrimental to your health.  I'd personally ideally go with the most simplistic food that fullfills the most basic nutritional needs (soylent or Joylent in my case) and then cherrypick other substances and ingredients that are known to provide health benefits (like olive oil, garlic or tea). Of course sometimes I also just want to enjoy good food. Health is not everything."

soylent,38mdbs,Matty_22,11,Fri Jun 5 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"The sugars in Soylent are (in descending order of quantity): isomaltulose, trehalose, and sucralose.  Most of the sugar comes from isomaltulose, which is a low-GI sugar, so it does not cause rapid changes in blood sugar. Only 10 grams come from trehalose, which has a similar GI to table sugar. Only a very small amount of sucralose is included (just enough to mask the flavor of the vitamins). Even then, virtually all the literature on sucralose says that it is safe for human consumption.  This means the 60 grams of sugar in Soylent would not have the same effect on the body as 60 grams of table sugar, HFCS, or food sugars. I would imagine the AHA recommendation was created with added HFCS/table sugar in mind.  That said, out of the Soylent alternatives from the sidebar, I think PowerChow is the only one with neither."

The reason you're supposed to avoid them is because almost all of them have a very high GI load, but this is a convention and not a rule.  Honestly, if I were you, I would talk to a dietician about Soylent."
soylent,38mdbs,synn89,4,Fri Jun 5 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"whether they're slow releasing or fast releasing and where they fall on the GI isn't all that important to me   Most everything you eat is sugar. A big plate of spaghetti is basically a giant plate of sugar. The difference is that it takes time for your body to break it down into glucose so you won't become diabetic from it.  That's also the difference between eating a fruit and drinking fruit juice. Orange juice is a common treatment for hypoglycemia while eating oranges isn't, because drinking the juice delivers the sugars to your body immediately while eating one takes your body longer to process them because of all the fiber.  So fast releasing vs slow releasing does matter. Now whether or not isomaltulose is a good or bad sugar I can't really comment on. But I wouldn't have the label of ""sugar"" turn you off alone. It's just a name picked by the FDA due to its source."

soylent,38mdbs,realthecaffiend,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"TL:DR: You'll probably be fine. If you want more research look up isomaltulose.    From the 1.4 release blog post:   When reviewing Soylent 1.4’s nutrition facts panel, customers may notice what appears to be a significant spike in the labelled amount of sugar: from 6 g/pouch to 44 g/pouch.  In fact, Soylent 1.4 actually contains less sucrose (table sugar) than previous versions: 2.7 g/pouch. How is this possible?  The answer is isomaltulose, a new ingredient and carbohydrate source in Soylent 1.4. Isomaltulose is a derivative of sucrose, but the similarities largely end there. While sucrose is a fast-digesting carbohydrate that causes rapid and unhealthy changes in blood sugar levels, isomaltulose is a far healthier source of carbohydrates and is absorbed into the bloodstream at a much slower rate than sucrose.  Because it is chemically similar to sucrose, the FDA requires isomaltulose to be listed as a sugar on nutrition facts labels, rather than a carbohydrate. We feel this could confuse customers, as it skews Soylent’s labelled nutritional profile and falsely causes it to appear unbalanced. Soylent’s formula has always been engineered for balanced nutrition, and version 1.4 is no different."

From Rosa Labs perspective, they are probably trying to change the formula to get as many purchasers as possible.  Since many people complain about gas the first few days, and they don't want people to stop buying the product, then they cut the fiber.

Where they stand to lose customers is if people continue to have issues after a reasonable adjustment period. I've done 1 meal a day (5 days a week) of Soylent since this fall and until 1.4, I always experienced some amount of uncomfortable bloating/acid reflux after consuming soylent. I could keep it to a minimum if I drank the meal slowly, but I had pretty much accepted that as something I'd have to live with. 1.4 is something I feel I could actually switch to for all my meals if I wanted. 1.5 looks to be a pretty minor change, so I expect no issues with that."

Right now they are still working on the formula. They have to look at trying to lower the cost to manufacture while improving bioavilability AND finding a flavor and consistency the bulk of people can actually tolerate and possibly even enjoy. They are also presumably still getting more new customers each month and may have to temporarily abandon a preferred ingredient due to manufacturing capcity of a supplier.

Millions of people, especially the elderly and disabled are on liquid diets. This is a question that has been asked many times, there is no need to guess. Try googling it and doing some quick research before you start spouting nonsense you have no reason to spout. Food consistency has very little to do with digestion speed. Fiber doesn't just slow digestion time, it regulates digestion time. If you're constipated, it speeds things up, if you have loose stool it slows things down. Look at the studies where indivuals are on an iron fortified diet, transit time decreases (counteracting the constipating effects of iron) with the introduction of fiber. It's essential to digestion, a process that is complex enough that chewing your food up and puking it into a strainer to reveal it's mysteries, as you suggested, is idiotic."

Lets face it: nobody has experimented with food on the scale that Soylent is now attempting. If they can improve on the USDA numbers, I want them to have the freedom to do so! I do NOT want to arbitrarily limit them because of a estimated number determined 60 years ago.  So feel free to critique the amount of fiber, but do it based on experience and evidence like ""I'm constipated"", or on some kind of scientific rational. But don't reject it just because you don't like the number.  Also remember that Soylent strives to be a maximally efficient food source. This means having as little of everything as possible. If something isn't needed, it should be removed, not kept around just in case. Otherwise, Soylent is missing potential efficiency gains.  All the above also applies to the protein discussion I've been seeing recently."

They won't get to the future if people are refusing the by the product because they are afraid of sharting their pants or having painful bloating.  Should it have your RDA? Sure.

When I switched to it the gas was extreme. After a few weeks my gut adjusted and it wasn't so bad. I still had more gas than when I was eating the standard American diet, though. If you eat a healthy amount of fiber you're going to fart more than when you are eating a diet of mostly refined grain flour. This is one of those things I wish Rosa Labs would take a stand on instead of catering to potential customers currently eating an unhealthy diet."

soylent,38ildf,asifinperson,3,Thu Jun 4 17:03:08 2015 UTC,The banana and peanut butter were for both taste/texture. I work construction and the protein helps hold me over until lunch more so than without it.
soylent,38ildf,GoldenChrysus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"Banana probably for taste, whey likely for both protein and taste, and peanut butter could be for protein, but it also adds fat, so it might just be flavor unless he needs the extra fat. When I make my own DIY, I have to always add two bananas and 75% of the protein I added was flavored, otherwise I cannot drink it. I think you need something like 8 bananas to get your daily potassium intake, so the extra banana(s) are hardly doing anything nutritional."

soylent,38oohi,Dubandubs,7,Fri Jun 5 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Which chicken sandwich do you get?  Also, you need to standardize the foods to compare them on a per calorie (or per 100 calorie, etc.) basis.

If you look at the table, a few things pop out.  The spicy deluxe sandwich has higher saturated fat and sodium compared to Soylent.  The grilled sandwich has less total fat, still more sodium, but also much more protein.  I should also mention that a serving of Soylent has a much more balanced vitamin and mineral profile than either sandwich does, but that amount of depth is too much for this comment.  TL;DR - Chick Fil A is fine to have in moderation, but choose the healthier options (grilled, no sauces) and you will be making a better choice for yourself.

soylent,38mrke,ImmaculateJackson,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome... thanks for the answer and further info.  I can anecdotally say that I have not experienced any mental performance deficits since switching to an almost all soylent diet, but when I stumbled across the article, it did raise it as a potential concern for the future.  Your answer and link to the study has definitely shed a different light on the article.  I think I might do a bit more looking in to creatine in general though, as the results of this study do seem to indicate there is definitely a relationship with mental performance/health but it is nowhere near as straightforward or clear as the article makes out.  I would like to answer one point of yours specifically though.  You state ""The human body, unless it is severely ill, produces its own creatine in sufficient quantity."".  To be honest, I don't like this kind of answer in general - primarily because of the use of the word ""sufficient"" without defining for what it's sufficient.  The human body is a highly complex machine, but is far from being well designed from an engineering perspective.  It's basically the ""good enough for survival"" result of evolution and has a lot of baggage and poorly fitting but 'good enough' pieces.  While I have no doubt that the human body does produce enough creatine to survive happily for a long time, I would take issue with any statement that it's unequivocally ""optimal"".  I personally view soylents as being the first steps towards a better kind of food.  Right now, they're focused mostly on recommended daily intakes, because there's not much else out there to tell us how to build the best food.  I would anticipate and hope that in the future, soylents will help us redefine the intake ranges, including for substances that are not traditionally considered essential such as creatine (bearing in mind this does exist in most people's diets, but is missing from my current all soylent diet... whether this has any effect or not remains to be seen; but I wouldn't dismiss it out of hand)."
soylent,38jy3v,ChiefWilliam,22,Thu Jun 4 18:44:25 2015 UTC,Soylent can't claim that it can help you lose weight because of legal issues. If you eat less calories of soylent than you burn you will lose weight. It's really that simple.

soylent,38jy3v,Subvers1on,4,Thu Jun 4 22:10:46 2015 UTC,I'm the same. Used to put down multiple burritos in one session. Major binge eating issues.  Soylent I've been totally satisfied with a bag (or less) per day. It's changed my life already.
soylent,38jy3v,Subvers1on,9,Fri Jun 5 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yes!  I eat 1500 kCals of Soylent per day, and maybe a small snack (fruit), totaling no more than 1600 kCals each day.  Following this plan on MyFitnessPal puts me at leasing 1 lb per week.  I replace some Soylent meals with normal food, keeping calories in mind.  I'm 3 weeks into doing this solid, and have lost nearly 5 lbs.  I plan on continuing this for another 5-10 weeks (when I expect to complete my weight goal) and then moving to the full 2000 kCals to maintain weight and to start building muscle.  If you are doing less than a bag of Soylent a day (like me), you will want to take some time to figure out if you will be deficient in any micronutrient areas.  I'm getting slight deficiencies in a few areas with strictly Soylent, so the occasional normal food is filling the gap for me and I have not noticed any problems.  Also, throw in some proper cardio in the mix, and you should be on a decent plan for weight loss.  The key is tracking your intake and output, and MyFitnessPal is a great help with that.  I'm certain future posts will point you at a ketogenic soylent for weight loss, but I want to highlight that it can be done without cutting out those beautiful carbs (I love bread :0)  Good luck!"

In honesty, I doubt I was meeting these RDIs with my diet habits before Soylent, so I have not been concerned.  EDIT: I did some quick comparisons again.

When I started with DIY a little over a year ago, i noticed an immediate improvement that has only gotten better since starting 1.2 and now with 1.4, my psoriasis is completely gone with the exception of one or two spots on the driest part of my hands, and those go away after a couple of days.  For me, the changes I made, including Soylent, have had an amazing and completely positive change on my life!  That being said, everyone is different and YMMV.

I got my Soylent after I had moved (twice!) and about when I expected to.  It's. A. Kickstarter.   You might as well be giving to charity. I liked the idea, though, so I jumped in. I'm glad I did, and I still remember the progress videos and blog updates that took us from start to actual business launch.   This is real life. Shit happens. Live. Learn. Give Julio a break.  Nice article (if formatted a little awkwardly for those quotations)."
soylent,38g2gk,w3djyt,10,Thu Jun 4 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Lot of critical comments in here, rough crowd.  It was a fun read, I enjoyed it. I imagine starting a company without an infrastructure in place has a lot of challenges to address, this interview goes into one of them. Sometimes you just need a stopgap solution until you get your bearings straight, and this $500 setup seems like a pretty damn good compromise. Obviously it wasn't ideal, but getting rid of all those tiny annoyances goes a long way in buying time to get a proper infrastructure laid out.  The negative comments about this seem to be missing the grander point - this solution was supposed to be temporary and it helped reduce a few of  the early issues. It's not uncommon either, you can find solutions like this all over the professional world. Band-aid fixes to stop the bleeding until a proper solution can be made happen all the time. And look at Soylent now! Infrastructure in place, products shipping and such pretty damn fast. Sounds like the band-aid worked great."
soylent,38g2gk,nosjojo,10,Thu Jun 4 05:15:25 2015 UTC,"That sounds absolutely terrifying, but I love reading about bootstrap solutions like this. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it certainly got them where they needed to go.  I can't say I'm upset or anything about customer experience like some others in this thread. I waited months as well, but I'd also read up on everything I could about the product and had a pretty good feel for the fact that it was a tiny staff with a crazy idea and barely any infrastructure. Couple that with sudden massive demand and shit's going to happen.  This is pretty creative problem solving while under fire as far as I'm concerned."
soylent,38g2gk,userexec,4,Thu Jun 4 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"I made a company and shipped about $1m in product in about 9 months and it was just myself and another guy - no fulfillment company, no knowledge of Python.  Its really not a big deal. We use ShipStation as well. The program can easily handle any sort of volumes needed to get a lot of packages shipped out, and shipped out quickly. The article makes it sound like its some sort of mystical, uber-entreprenurial thing to find programs like Shipstation, SellBrite, and other programs that can import .CSVs and churn out shippable results.  At one point, myself and another guy were packing/shipping 200 orders a day - and he was part time.   $500 is about right for the solution.. The label printer - Dymo 4XL - is about $150. Then the PC/Mac, and then software (which is about $65/mo). If anything, that article is a promo for ShipStation.   I don't know if the article is trying to be a case study, a promotion for their resourcefulness, an ad for ShipStation/ShipWire, or that LTL fulfillment centers really don't like to handle consumer goods.   Disclosure: I have no stake in Soylent in any way. I randomly saw this article and thought Reddit would be discussing it. Just making a comment on the actual function of order fulfillment."

soylent,38g2gk,The_other_Cody,2,Thu Jun 4 16:22:13 2015 UTC,I think it clarifies that they are actively working on that development and that they will be sure to announce it as soon as they have the capability.
soylent,38g2gk,hugecock6969,9,Thu Jun 4 16:02:28 2015 UTC,Lesson learned here is that you get what you pay for.  Nobody got their soylent for so damn long. I had to wait almost six months and I was one of the original kickstarter backers too.
soylent,38g2gk,Satros,12,Thu Jun 4 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"supposedly it was because they had picked one supplier of one ingredient which was a higher quality than the competitors (ground finer to be less gritty, I suppose) but this supplier had delivery problems. and rather than ship a lower-quality product they delayed and delayed and delayed, and failed to update the website to give people realistic expectations on when the product would ship.  the fulfillment issue was different - that's when people would get charged but not receive product, etc."
soylent,38g2gk,_ilovetofu_,3,Thu Jun 4 02:03:41 2015 UTC,I waited for a whole year. It took longer than most because first they sent me an empty tracking code which never got any information filled into it or updated...
soylent,38g2gk,hugecock6969,6,Thu Jun 4 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Haha I figured this would be the first comment. Yes, a brand new company saved money and delivered a product and was able to better use that funds getting 1.1 and extra resources to minimize potential delays and we still have people not happy from a year ago."
soylent,38g2gk,_ilovetofu_,0,Thu Jun 4 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"well, other than the fact that they charged people months before the product shipped and failed to give any kind of accurate estimate on when they'd get the product they'd paid for, yes."
soylent,38g2gk,ShatteringFast,10,Thu Jun 4 02:04:50 2015 UTC,"No one that bought into it after the Kickstarter should've expected it before the Kickstarter people did. They were frequent with the updates and shipped pretty quickly. People were also complaining they were doing faster to those who had already ordered. Someone is  always going to be mad, but I think they chose the lesser of two evils pretty much every time."
soylent,38g2gk,daknapp0773,2,Thu Jun 4 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"I started reading the article and came across this:   ""If you opened it in Excel it would truncate it, because it would be like, “That is a 24-digit-number. We should store this in scientific notation.”   So...none of you guys knew how to Format Cells to display a Number in Excel?"
soylent,38g2gk,SparklingLimeade,3,Thu Jun 4 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"Ya I read and thought this too, although I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that the shipping company sent them files from excel that were saved as .csv files. This would mean that Excel converted to scientific notation and then since it was saved as a .csv, there would be no way to convert it back."

soylent,38g2gk,Subvers1on,-1,Fri Jun 5 06:59:42 2015 UTC,There's a number of elements in this writeup that overall seem to make it not worth publicizing.   Main takeaway that I got: they saved a ton of money by going with the cheapest fulfillment option at the expense of their customers' overall experience     Edit: Why not engage me in a healthy debate if you disagree with my opinion?
soylent,38g2gk,casual_observr,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't exactly sound cheap to me when you factor in their time.  Rather, I read this more as just growing pains of a startup.  In the early phase of Soylent (which this article covers), I assume they had a bevvy of other problems they were facing outside of shipping.  If they would have had more time/resources available, the likely could have put a proper system in place from the beginning.  However, this is rarely how startups function - everything is usually full steam ahead in a short period of time."
soylent,38g2gk,Subvers1on,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"I gave the post a 2nd read after some time and I do have to say that some of the things that jumped out to me the first time I saw it weren't as significant.  For one, I came away with a feeling that there was a great deal of negativity spouting about the capabilities of Heritage. But looking back, there's a number of quotes praising their flexibility and willingness to accommodate Soylent's business and their unique fulfillment needs.  I also may have gotten caught up with the timeline comparing the time frame of this situation with the timing (and eventual delivery) of my order. [FYI I ordered in the first week of May and received it in the first week of November.] But again, looking back at it, they hacked their $500 system together in April '14 after 3 weeks of issues with Heritage and they rode that for 3 months until it made sense for them to switch over to Shipwire.  For what it's worth, that new system and new production facilities are really working for them. It's certainly fair to say that it's an enduring sign of success for Soylent to have navigated the rollercoaster ride of the past year and to end up with +$20M in funding from top VCs and a production/fulfillment system that's now on point.   One extra tidbit: I received a notification from Shipwire at 5:41pm yesterday informing me that the labels for my latest subscription order (1.5) had been printed and the packaged arrived at my office before noon today."

soylent,38g2gk,sharkerty,-12,Sun Jun 7 23:04:48 2015 UTC,What a fucking joke. They have the balls to tout this as a success? Fuck them. Their customers waited for fucking ever to get product they paid for a year in advance. I'm glad I cancelled my order. TI'd be doubly pissed at this point if I had continued to support these pricks.
soylent,38g2gk,sharkerty,6,Thu Jun 4 03:32:59 2015 UTC,The point of the article was to show that our beginning was struggle that we overcame when faced with overwhelming demand. I apologize if it upset you.
soylent,38g2gk,upta,-10,Thu Jun 4 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"It reads as if you are bragging about the money you saved at the expense of your loyal customers. It's kind of a slap in the face. The first 6 months were a customer service nightmare and I'd like to see how much this ""savings"" cost you in customers and future orders."
soylent,38g2gk,sharkerty,11,Thu Jun 4 03:43:21 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the first 6 months we were just 5 employees. The demand was never anticipated. When we started earning that money went straight back into the company allowing us to expand distribution. But again the demand for Soylent was over whelming. Its a key reason we have taken expansion outside of the US more slowly.
soylent,38g2gk,threepio,-11,Thu Jun 4 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. You had taken a years worth of orders before you started to ship. You knew exactly how much soylent you needed to ship and when. The problem was you tried to save money, customers be damned. And now you are flaunting as a great strategic business decision when in fact you lost tons of customers and pissed off most of them. You can't use the excuse of having a small staff. It is pretty simple to hire folks, especially customer service and shipping folks. And still, you are trying to make excuses for terrible decision making which proves your team didn't learn shit from this experience. The title of this article should be ""How a $500 shipping package cost us hundreds of customers and thousands of dollars in sales"". Instead of bragging about it, you should apologizing to your customer base for stringing them along."

soylent,38g2gk,Subvers1on,-8,Thu Jun 4 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"I order a months worth during the initial kickstarter. I really liked the idea and was hoping that they would be successful. I contributed to the forum almost every day for months as they progressed. Their terrible execution and downright refusal to address their issues made me realize they were in it only for the quick buck.

soylent,38k0tv,Throwaway25713,4,Thu Jun 4 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Although I don't generally condone the use of most nootropics it really depends what your goal is and what specific nootropic you are referring to. Generally speaking the same approach should be followed that you would with traditional food.   Some nootropics need to be taken on an empty stomach (such as amino acid isolates and derivatives). Others such as say, caffeine or natural drugs, can be taken with food.   I would suggest against mixing any particular nootropic with your daily soylent and consuming it that way. Because if that nootropic has any idiosyncratic behavior with other digestive enzymes or neurotransmitters, which MANY nootropics do - such as cytochrome p450 inhibition produced by a myriad of nootropics (St. John's Wort & Cranberry extract) or dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors (such as EGCG found in green tea extract) or huperzine-a (cholinesterase inhibitor), it will occur every time you consume your food and increases the risk adversely affecting either your absorption of the food or your bodies natural enzymes and neuro-chemicals. Where-as if you just take that nootropic on it's own your body will restore any imbalance when the drug is no longer present."

Certainly if you were to say, pop open an Adderral pill (I know this is a prescription drug, just an example) and mix the powder in with Soylent you wouldn't receive any of the desired effects because you wouldn't be taking it all at once but rather fractions of it throughout the day."
soylent,38k0tv,ChiefWilliam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"Agree with Tim - depends 100% on what you're taking. Some nootropics are fat soluble, some are water soluble, some are better on an empty stomach. I'm using piracetam + aniracetam + choline + green tea extract, but the racetams and green tea are pills that I take before consuming soylent (DIY high fat lower carb variety). Extra choline bitartrate makes the soylent a little more sour/savory than sweet. Everything is working great so far, better on 100% soylent days actually. I notice the effect of the racetams ""hits"" my bloodstream more noticeably after digesting some calories. Maybe it's placebo or I'm mistaking blood sugar levels for drug effects.  Haven't noticed any smell, but I'm a regular shower-taker and deodorant-wearer, so YMMV..."

soylent,38jqre,CALibertarian,2,Thu Jun 4 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"You could bottle the MCT oils into smaller containers, but if the traveling is for short-term, then the MCT oil isn't super necessary.  It's just another oil to raise the amount of fat in the product, but your body won't shut down if you are lower on fat for a few days.  You can also just use more of another oil to make up for the missing MCT oil.  As an aside, I have found MCT oil at Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Sprouts, Vitamin Cottage, and Lassens.  If you don't have any of those near by, then you might be out of luck."
soylent,38jqre,dreiter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm traveling again next week, so I'll see if I can find smaller bottles by then. I've been able to find MCT at a number of places nearby (and amazon), but nothing small enough to last a few days or to get through security.  Good to know on being okay in the short-term without oil. I guess I could up the amount of heavy cream for those few days and see how it goes. Thanks!"

soylent,38jqre,chrisbair,2,Fri Jun 5 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"username mentions in the body of the Original Post don't notify, do it in a comment and it does. Kinda weird.  Anyway... MCT oil is handy for ketogenic diets because your body will convert it directly into ketone bodies. I've seen some n=1 experiments over on /r/keto where they tested their blood ketone levels while eating too many carbs but consuming a bunch of MCT and they got a positive (though low) readout. Anyhow MCT will get you into ketosis faster and keep you there quite well.  It isn't absolutely necessary to enter or maintain ketosis though, otherwise the Inuits would have had issues =) So if you're far far away taking a plane then use whatever oil you have on hand. Canola or Olive oils are better than soybean; on occasion you may even be able to find liquid coconut oil (they carry it at walmart) which is like 50% MCT IIRC.  You can also get a bit crazy and skip the oil entirely in favor of MOAR cream. Clone the recipe, zero out the oil and play around with the cream until you get the calorie total where you want it.  I've taken keto chow camping (with a travel trailer) and it worked out OK. Haven't had to fly with it yet, that'll be interesting when I go to Dreamforce in September. I suspect I'll just do what I recommended to you: ditch the oil and use more cream."

It's just that without additional details or context to explain why you're looking for alternatives the phrasing inevitably makes it sound like you may not know Soylent is vegan. The second form doesn't help due to uncertainty about how the word ""also"" is being applied. It's now clear that you intend it as ""Soylent alternatives that are vegan like Soylent,"" and not ""Soylent alternatives that are vegan in addition to being Soylent alternatives.""  ... if that makes sense.  English is a pain. In this case it's easiest and most natural to clarify by including context as you did by saying that you've tried Soylent and are merely interested in branching out."

Here is what I found (all double-blind, placebo controlled):  A study published in The Journal of Nutrition:   Results of surveys and of clinical challenges with MSG in the general population reveal no evidence of untoward effects. We recently conducted a multicenter DBPC challenge study in 130 subjects (the largest to date) to analyze the response of subjects who report symptoms from ingesting MSG. The results suggest that large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG. However, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent and were not reproducible. The responses were not observed when MSG was given with food.   A newer, widely cited study published in the Food and Chemical Toxicology journal:   The study used a rigorous randomized double-blind crossover design that controlled for subjects who had MSG after-tastes. [...] Subjects mostly had no responses to placebo (86%) and MSG (85%) treatments. Sensations, previously attributed to MSG, did not occur at a significantly higher rate than did those elicited by placebo treatment. [...] An exhaustive review of previous methodologies identified the strong taste of MSG as the factor invalidating most ‘blind’ and ‘double-blind’ claims by previous researchers. The present study led to the conclusion that ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome’ is an anecdote applied to a variety of postprandial illnesses; rigorous and realistic scientific evidence linking the syndrome to MSG could not be found."

soylent,389y8b,Skycakes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  50mg/g * 80g = 4000 mg of lysine per 2000 calorie serving (although not all of it is digested).  Similarly, the DRI for protein is 56 grams per day for a man and 46 grams per day for a woman (71 grams per day during/after pregnancy).  The general requirement is 0.8g/kg for a sedentary person, or .36g/lb. Here is the article on Wiki.  Therefore, Soylent 1.5 provides enough protein for the average sedentary person.    The PDCAAS value is simply a measure of the 'quality' of  a protein source with respect to the ideal human needs.  This can be useful for those looking to lose fat and/or gain muscle.  For example, studies have shown benefits up to .64g/lb of protein intake, which would be 130 grams per day for a 200lb person.  This page goes into detail regarding those studies.  So, up to .64g/lb per day can be a useful intake, and it helps to know the limitations of the types of protein in your diet."

Minimum daily intake of article  Essential amino acid:       Estimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years. The following table lists the WHO recommended daily amounts currently in use for essential amino acids in adult humans, together with their standard one-letter abbreviations.  Food sources are identified based on the USDA National Nutrient Database Release.  The recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. Cysteine (or sulphur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.    Various attempts have been made to express the ""quality"" or ""value"" of various kinds of protein. Measures include the biological value, net protein utilization, protein efficiency ratio, protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score and complete protein concept. These concepts are important in the livestock industry, because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on feed conversion ratio. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a supplement of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.

soylent,388dyg,BuffyCreepireSlayer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"""Nutritionally complete"" is not really feasible. What's complete for a sedentary person is not going to be complete for an active, in shape person. You can certainly survive off Soylent alone if you really want, but there is no 1 size fits all when it comes to food, you need to be able to tailor it to your needs."
soylent,388dyg,bobertoq,4,Wed Jun 3 03:44:29 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously. That's not the question, though. I could survive off pureed potato for quite some time if I really wanted to, but the question is whether I'm then getting a baseline of healthy nutrition. The idea of Soylent, as I have always understood it, is that it's intended to be a healthy, complete meal replacement for the average adult human. Individuals might obviously need to make a tweak here and there for any number of variations in biology or lifestyle, but Conor up there saying ""We don't actually advocate only consuming Soylent"" in response to concerns about the nutrition of the product makes it sound like it's NOT intended to be a complete meal replacement for the average adult human.   That would, in part, explain why they're doing things like dropping salt, fiber, and protein content in favor of taste. After all, if you're not supposed to eat Soylent alone, you'll probably get plenty of salt from other food.   For someone who almost exclusively eats Soylent, this is a pretty important distinction."

soylent,388dyg,Brentnauer,3,Thu Jun 4 04:40:27 2015 UTC,Only has 48% your daily value of fiber    That would explain a few of the issues I'm having...
soylent,388dyg,lapinrigolo,8,Tue Jun 2 18:51:36 2015 UTC,The reduced fiber content is because Soylent is liquid food - You need less fiber to move it though your system.

At a certain point, needing to add things to make up for the deficiencies defeats the purpose of buying the complete product.   Sigh, I should probably look at some of the competitors."
soylent,388dyg,BuffyCreepireSlayer,2,Tue Jun 2 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Here's their rationale for the salt:   Slight Decrease in Sodium Chloride  In order to provide the most neutral flavor profile possible, the salt (sodium chloride) content has been reduced to 3.2 grams per pouch. This effectively reduces the total sodium content to 1,520 mg, on par with the Institute of Medicine’s daily recommended intake of 1,500 mg of sodium per day."
soylent,388dyg,Poop-n-Puke,5,Wed Jun 3 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I don't think that's a good rationale, though.

Anecdotally, I get sick as hell on 1.4 if I don't supplement salt, and I'm not the only one. This just makes it worse."

soylent,388dyg,diox8tony,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"? I think you misunderstood me. I only claimed that isomaltose was the first-listed carb-only source, i.e., the maltodextrin doesn't count because it's part of a compound ingredient that contains more than just carbs. However, I also suspect that they've changed the way they categorize isomaltose. For example, they may only count a certain fraction of it as sugar now."

The answer is isomaltulose, a new ingredient and carbohydrate source in Soylent 1.4. Isomaltulose is a derivative of sucrose, but the similarities largely end there. While sucrose is a fast-digesting carbohydrate that causes rapid and unhealthy changes in blood sugar levels, isomaltulose is a far healthier source of carbohydrates and is absorbed into the bloodstream at a much slower rate than sucrose.  http://blog.soylent.com/post/112067551237/soylent-1-4-begins-shipping-today   Also:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22172468"

IIRC, their reasoning on the fiber seemed fairly solid, as reducing fiber meant the testers reported feeling much less bloated. Keep in mind too, that fiber doesn't actually have any nutrition of it's own, and so it's not nearly as important as the actual nutrients themselves, and there is still more fiber in Soylent than most people probably get from their normal meals."

soylent,387rke,AliceTheGorgon,4,Tue Jun 2 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"How low was the ""low"" intake in those studies? I suspect that Soylent still contains more fibre than most people get anyway.  As for the ""10 Snickers bars"", we both know that's not remotely the same situation, and that the Soylent team is not ""targeting suboptimal nutrition"". In response to ""just because some people aren't used to eating healthy"", I'll simply point out that you are massively jumping to conclusions there about the diets of the testers involved, and the competence of the team doing the testing."
soylent,387rke,Skycakes,4,Tue Jun 2 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"I doubt people will feel better eating 10 snickers bars a day.

soylent,387rke,ryanmercer,2,Tue Jun 2 13:56:20 2015 UTC,What do you mean by supplementing fiber?  I'm talking about a healthy RDA of fiber in the OP.
soylent,387rke,dreiter,7,Tue Jun 2 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"The fiber in soylent is from oat flour which in theory should be fine, but supplementing fiber (specifically from psyllium) may actually CAUSE cancer. I'd view just about everything in Soylent other than the oat flour as a SUPPLEMENT not food as it's all extracted/powder/synthetic etc.   Nothing in 1.4 gives me any concern though but as far as the fiber argument. Get your fiber from natural food sources not some supplement. If you feel you need more fiber pick it up with vegetables not adding something like psyllium to your soylent.   As far as RDA's. RDA's are a joke.    human beings are not machines and we all are different. Requirements of many things vary wildly by genetics, a 4ft tall person will need different amounts than a 6ft tall person, a man will need more of something than a woman and a woman will need more of something than a man. An active man will need something more than a sedantry man, a pregnant woman will need more than a pubescent athletic male.  We poorly understand the human body as a system, we poorly understand each organ for the most part. We've very little clue what optimal nutrition looks like for any individual, let alone for every human being.  Gut micro biome further complicates things, some things will get absorbed better by some individuals.    As far as fiber, i've not seen any good science that gives a definite answer on what you need. You can put two people on an identical diet and they'll likely experience differences in bowel movements and psosibly even type of stool. You can put two people on nearly identical diets giving one more fiber than the other and it might make a huge difference or no difference.   And for fiber, depending on what group you listen to, the number ranges from 18g to 35g of fiber for adults... that's a pretty big difference. Fact is, we have no idea.  I'm qutie fine with the lower fiber, increased fiber (even over several weeks of steady increased levels) gives me terrible gas and cramps. Eating 'real' food I get very low amounts of fiber, have perfect and frequent bowel movements, rarely have gas, rarely have any discomfort, jump my fiber up to recommended levels for a month or two and I'll have gas and painful cramps the entire time as well as constipation and clay-like bowel movements."
soylent,387rke,ryanmercer,3,Tue Jun 2 15:11:32 2015 UTC,Do you have any studies indicating that psyllium contributes to cancer risk?
soylent,387rke,DavidMcCarlie,-5,Tue Jun 2 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"I recall seeing one a couple years ago I believe, I think the data was fairly suspect but I remember it getting turned into link bait everywhere.     END CREDIBLE SCIENCE, ENTER MY INFORMED OBSERVATIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INSPIRE YOU TO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND PONDERING  Point I'm getting at, psyllium husk isn't something humans really consume a lot of naturally. I'd try to get my fiber from whole food (or flours) first.   Seeds generally have defensive mechanisms to discourage animals from eating them or to encourage the animal to expel them faster so they survive. Apple seeds have trace amounts of arsenic/cyanide compounds, tree nut/soy/peanut allergies show theirs in in humans with those allergies, some will have isothiocyanates which are very bitter in taste (and toxic to various insects and animals) etc.   I personally do my best to avoid seeds and products from seeds for the most part anyway (I love peanut butter but I probably eat less than half a jar a year, it regularly gets thrown away for being a bit older than I'd prefer it to be) as seeds are the single part of the plant that's meant to survive at all costs. In animals and insects a lot of these things can be fatal, in humans they might just cause irritation. Irritation can = inflamation, inflamation seems to be a culprit for many less-than-ideal-effects on overall health and possibly even an increased occurence of cancerous cells (you have cancerous cells, everyone does, usually our body is just good at taking them out, but it's probably best not to encourage their development, if I can blanket avoid seeds and reduce inflamation from many of them... sure why not do it?)."

soylent,384jew,JadelyJade,2,Tue Jun 2 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"Typically, when a company of your size and sales does an international product roll-out, are they able to ship to big population centers for the same price as US shipping, or is it inevitable that it costs a lot more?"
soylent,384jew,tyluy,2,Tue Jun 2 09:13:19 2015 UTC,We will probably actually do the production in any large market we enter into. Instead of just shipping from the US. Our goal is to have Soylent be the same across the board.
soylent,384jew,aeriis,2,Tue Jun 2 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"On the Facebook page Soylent in a comment said that they'd be working on shipping to Canada next, so I feel like they're just waiting for shipping to be settled for a couple of months before they begin that, and will prepare similarly for the rest of the world.  Thankfully Canada has 1/10th the population of the USA and I expect Soylent will be a lot more prepared in terms of supply than they were in the USA. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw it overseas before the next fiscal year."

soylent,384jew,dreiter,12,Thu Jun 4 03:20:58 2015 UTC,They incorporated trehalose! Pretty cool
soylent,384jew,UberChow,11,Mon Jun 1 20:24:45 2015 UTC,What's trehalose and why's it cool?
soylent,384jew,dreiter,27,Mon Jun 1 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to being a slow-reacting sugar as the Soylent page shows, it's also non-reducing and cannot participate in Maillard reactions. Because of this property, there's several research labs that have shown it prevents neurodegeneration, which is caused in part by protein glycation.  It was the central major ingredient change that my Uber Chow was designed around several months ago."
soylent,384jew,dreiter,8,Mon Jun 1 20:37:30 2015 UTC,Looks like it's an antioxidant as well.  Although Wiki says it is nutritionally equivalent to glucose due to being rapidly broken down by the trehalase enzyme into glucose.  So it still seems like it would raise blood sugar like any other simple sugar would?
soylent,384jew,superamit,11,Mon Jun 1 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what they mean by 'nutritionally equivalent'. It is broken down into 2 glucose molecules, but you could say the same thing about starches. Is oat flour nutritionally equivalent to raw glucose?  Also interesting about trehalose is that the enzyme to break it down is only found in the small intestines, which is why it has such a slow absorption. So unlike glucose, it doesn't get broken down all over your body and easily taken up into the blood."
soylent,384jew,autowikibot,6,Mon Jun 1 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer.  Looks like that's a plausible explanation.  Since it's a disaccharide it would be digested quickly, leading to a rise in blood sugar like sucrose, lactose, etc., do.  However, if the enzyme is only found in the small intestine, then digestion would be slowed and the blood sugar spike would be minimized."
soylent,384jew,ChuckL3M0str3,4,Mon Jun 1 20:59:43 2015 UTC,Wiki has a good page on it.  Not sure why /u/UberChow thinks it's cool though.
soylent,384jew,kyuz,2,Mon Jun 1 20:30:02 2015 UTC,Yeah was just reading that but didn't see (or perhaps understand) the significance. Hopefully someone can explain. :)
soylent,384jew,kyuz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Trehalose:       Trehalose, also known as mycose or tremalose, is a natural alpha-linked disaccharide formed by an α,α-1,1-glucoside bond between two α-glucose units. In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye,  and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from trehala manna, a substance made by weevils, and named it trehalose.  It can be synthesised by bacteria,  fungi, plants, and invertebrate animals. It is implicated in anhydrobiosis — the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. It has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food and cosmetics. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles, by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/rehydration cycle. Trehalose has the added advantage of being an antioxidant.

You've got to consider other things. Soylent is tackling the concept of food as a whole, and that includes questions about production and distribution. These engineered solutions will become all the more important and impactful as the project expands globally and hopefully reaches some of its more utopian aspirations.  There are any number of indicators - water usage being a really topical one at the moment - that point towards plant-based diets being the rational future paradigm."

There's just too much wasted energy/resources involved in raising animals.  And that's coming from someone who still loves steak, bacon, eggs... but also sees solving starvation as a more important goal.  So while it may make more sense from a consumer perspective to want them to go cheaper if possible, from Rosa Labs perspective, going after short-term profits hurts the long-term prospects for the company."
soylent,384jew,realthecaffiend,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Does it, though? Keep in mind they can change ingredients at the drop of a hat (as these version changes demonstrate), so if the prices change in the future they can instantly switch back to vegan powders."
soylent,384jew,ryanmercer,3,Wed Jun 3 02:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it means they're missing out on an opportunity to develop the expertise needed to make a complete nutrition, fully-vegan food product.  I actually think they might be doing all these version changes just to test out how different tastes/textures/nutrition sources are received, as well as testing out how flexible production is with them.  But, I do wish they'd start ""branching out"" the available mixes. I'd prefer something higher protein, and perhaps a little higher fiber, too.  Still early days. It's actually pretty impressive they have it as cheap as they do, considering they're quickly changing and mass-producing a consumed product. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for them."

This is a huge percentage of the population (about about half of the U.S. population and the majority of adults, according to the CDC). My father occasionally consumes Soylent and falls into this group, so based on what I have read, I am glad for the change. I'm happy to supplement sodium if necessary.   I would hope, however, that Soylent would officially advise its customers to supplement sodium if necessary. If young, active, healthy adults need more sodium than the individuals in this sodium-restricted group, this is important information to know."

soylent,384jew,n1tegoat,0,Tue Jun 2 03:22:45 2015 UTC,"No one eats 100% McDonalds with the expectation that they will be fully nourished. It's a very different (and potentially dangerous) case with little precedent. If not legal obligations, one could argue there are ethical obligations.

soylent,384jew,dreiter,0,Tue Jun 2 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"If not legal obligations,   But that's the problem, once they start advising you seek this outside thing along with their product they are now giving nutritional advice along with their food and they open themselves up to all sorts of legal  & regulatory issues as well as moronic lawsuits.

Nope, I managed to do the above on accident myself (full story here) and it would be pretty damn easy for someone to do something idiotic like that then go 'oooh they told me to add salt, let me call a lawyer!!!'... and someone could make similar idiotic lawsuits up over any other thing they recommend adding on top of it to hit RDA.   As it stands now, Soylent is a food and they legally have no obligation to recommend you supplement with this or that.

Obviously everyone will have different macro-nutrient preferences, but at least a couple options would be nice.  My second issue is less important, but as a meat eater I wonder whether Soylent could be even more nutritious and taste better if you didn't restrict yourself to vegan ingredients.

The ""complete protein"" concern is a misunderstanding from a book written decades ago. The author fixed it in subsequent revisions of her book, but pop science never caught the redaction.  If you're still worried you can read the ~15 page report by the ADA on vegetarian and vegan nutrition. The conclusion is that veg diets are appropriate and healthy and may confer additional health benefits for people at all life stages (infant, children, teen, adult, pregnant women, and elderly), and it goes into detail any potential concerns people have and the studies backing it up.

B12 can be easily supplemented and at the end of the day, even B12 comes from bacteria in dirt, not any animal product. Eating some unwashed organic vegetables solves that problem.   I could look at the countless vegans with tons of health problems from lack of umpteen things   Knowing a couple of unhealthy vegans doesn't suddenly invalidate the health benefits of veganism. Anecdotes don't count as fact. The research is out there if you look, vegans live an average of 7 years longer, are the only group of people with a healthy BMI as a whole (in the US), and have the lowest incidences of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer (which are the biggest causes of mortality)."

Relevant section:   A meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that supplementation with vitamin D3 had a significant and positive effect in the raising of serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with the effect of vitamin D2 (P = 0.001). When the frequency of dosage administration was compared, there was a significant response for vitamin D3 when given as a bolus dose (P = 0.0002) compared with administration of vitamin D2, but the effect was lost with daily supplementation.   You also don't have to add fish oil, since the benefits that come from taking fish oil are in the EPA and DHA fatty acids, both of which are present in Soylent due to the choice of oils and the added algal DHA."
soylent,384jew,Skycakes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:19:56 2015 UTC,"Regardless of uptake issues, I do need to supplement with D3 as Soylent doesn't have enough vitamin D in any form to meet my dietary needs. It's possible the D2 is a fine form, but as I've had some nutrient absorption issues in the past I prefer to hedge my bets.  Fish oil is something everyone should be adding, as Soylent doesn't have any EPA. It has DHA, and it has ALA. ALA does convert to EPA/DHA, but the conversion rate is minimal and studies show that direct consumption of EPA/DHA is vastly preferable. Sauce, More sauce"

soylent,384jew,6ThreeSided9,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure if any long-term health studies have been done for that specific issue, but there are a few papers discussing conversion rates and intake.  Most studies show positive health outcomes for both vegan and fish-eating groups, as compared to omnivores, so overall I believe more research needs done (as always).  This paper discusses conversation rates and intakes:   In conclusion, this study found substantial differences in status and detailed intakes of n−3 PUFAs and their sources in different dietary-habit groups in a general population of middle- and older-aged men and women. The precursor-product ratio of ALA to circulating n−3 PUFAs was significantly greater in women than in men and in non-fish-eaters than in fish-eaters, which indicated a potentially greater estimated conversion. There were smaller differences than expected in status between fish-eaters and non-fish-eaters, which may also be explained by the greater estimated conversion of ALA to LC n−3 PUFAs in the non-fish-eaters. The implications of this study are that, if conversion of plant-based sources of n−3 PUFAs were found to occur in intervention studies, and were sufficient to maintain health, it could have significant consequences for public health recommendations and for preservation of the wild fish supply.   This paper discusses recent literature regarding conversion rates:   Several case studies involving n−3-deficient patients reported that intervention with ALA results in marked increases in plasma concentrations of both EPA and DHA (50, 51). In addition, vegans who consume ALA but not EPA and DHA in their diets have low but stable concentrations of DHA in plasma (52, 53). Together, these findings suggest that humans can convert meaningful quantities of ALA to EPA and DHA, particularly in the presence of a deficiency or a background of low n−6 fatty acids. However, consistent with the isotope-tracer studies, the vast majority of the ALA supplementation studies show a limited conversion of ALA to its long-chain n−3 derivatives. These studies have been performed in healthy individuals consuming typical Western diets generally high in n−6 fatty acids. Chan et al (54), for example, studied the dose effect of ALA supplementation on plasma phospholipid n−3 fatty acid concentrations and found a small but significant dose-dependent increase in ALA and EPA concentrations in phospholipids, but no increase in DHA. Notably, a high ratio of LA to ALA in the diet reduced the conversion of ALA to EPA. Others have found increased amounts of ALA and EPA but not DHA after supplementation with 2–3 g ALA/d (55, 56)."

American Dietetic Association  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  Dietitians of Canada  A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  The British National Health Service  With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  The British Nutrition Foundation  A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  The Dietitians Association of Australia  Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  The United States Department of Agriculture  Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  The National Health and Medical Research Council  Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

soylent,3871oz,Soylentconor,2,Wed Jun 3 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"The blog post introducing Soylent 1.5 mentions the following:   In this release, safflower and flaxseed oil powders were removed and replaced with canola oil powder. This new fatty acid source is supplemented with the existing high oleic sunflower oil and algal oil.   However, when going to the lipids on the FAQ page, there is no mention of high oleic sunflower oil at all. Does high oleic sunflower oil not contribute to the lipids in Soylent 1.5 or is the lipids page not updated yet?"

Well within the WHO 10% recommendation.

soylent,382nd0,ShippingIsMagic,0,Tue Jun 2 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting to get downvoted for such an innocuous comment.   Ha, I was thinking the same thing. I think reddit does random downvotes occasionally I forget the rationale for it though.   Unrelated, but I would find it fascinating for someone to compare experiences on regular ketogenic vs ketogenic Soylent diets for weight training and endurance training results.   Yea, I agree that it would be interesting. People typically cite the value of soylent or meal replacements as primarily the convenience/efficiency factor that it introduces but the advantages hardly end there. A carefully balanced and well designed meal replacement offers more than many foods in terms of utility for the body. Although it does diminish the variability of eating different foods (which may have some value - still unclear).  I am definitely in the process of running an N=1 on myself in terms of how ketogenic soylents can assist in weight training and weightloss. My results so far are good but they generally confirm what we already know which is that ketogenic soylent can be very effective in inducing weight loss (fat loss).   I'm now more interested in the potential to create muscle and maintain an ideal muscle mass/body fat composition by using ketogenic soylent. I'm still testing this out but so far things look very promising. I will probably document and write more on this as I go."
soylent,382nd0,ShippingIsMagic,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"In my own N=1 testing, the big difference switching from regular / official Soylent and ketogenic soylent is the amount of fat loss as a percentage of total weight loss. With official Soylent I had 68% of my weight loss being fat loss (lost 10 pounds of lean mass). With ketogenic soylent, it has been closer to 95% thus far.  I don't know how this would compare to a ""regular"" ketogenic diet, but being able to have the exact same food, calories, and carbs every day has made it much simpler to understand what is going on. :)"

soylent,384brw,BuffyCreepireSlayer,2,Mon Jun 1 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"Salt. If you're sitting on your ass and eating Soylent you need to supplement your salt, but if you're exercising on Soylent you oughta be chugging salt water like it's your life force.  I got sick right after starting Soylent. I felt weirdly dizzy and weak and tired and crappy. It was the salt."
soylent,384brw,FBomher,2,Tue Jun 2 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"You might want to consider other powder food alternatives that are geared towards people living a more active lifestyle. I believe Axcho has ""Athlete Fuel"", 100% Food has the ""Double Protein"" version and there is a company called JouleFuel which I believe is one of the only ones made w/ whey protein. Athlete Fuel and JouleFuel also have higher volume of calories per bag. It may be beneficial to check one of them out or to just supplement your soylent w/ some whey protein.   One other thing to consider is how many calories you actually need. Before I started on the powdered food diet, I checked out an RMR calculator which said I needed 3k calories a day just to maintain my weight, I definitely wasn't getting anywhere close to that which explained why my energy would drag through my workouts and afternoons. I personally workout 5 days a week at a 5am Crossfit class and run on the weekends. I now use JouleFuel for about 85% of my meals (100% during the week, and I eat a couple times on weekends). Now that I use powdered food it's much easier to reach 3k calories, thus my energy is improved both in my workouts and throughout the day."
soylent,384brw,fudgemania,5,Tue Jun 2 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"not on 1.3, but in 1.4 they cut protein a lot because soylent is made for ""average"" people.  lord knows if there's one thing we should be doing it should be aspiring to be average.  you will need to supplement significantly with protein on 1.4."
soylent,384brw,Subvers1on,4,Mon Jun 1 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"I do not view the Soylent philosophy as 'aspiring to be average'. Rather, it is about the average amount needed to survive and be healthy.  I'm going to get on my soap box for a minute, as I see a lot of fitness gainers on here complain about lack of protein in Soylent.  A lot of us do not need that extra protein, and are quite happy where the recipe is currently.  Please stop viewing Soylent as a fitness product first and a food stuff second.  It is a food stuff that happens to be convenient for managing fitness goals that also allows a higher level of control in these areas (by not needlessly over providing macros)."
soylent,384brw,ghostmeatloaf,3,Mon Jun 1 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't even go that far, I'd say that if you want more protein in your soylent, it's very easy to add it yourself."
soylent,384brw,dreiter,2,Mon Jun 1 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"You don't 'need to' supplement with protein, but I agree that a higher protein amount in the product would be nice for those of us interested in fitness and/or weight loss.  Personally I add more rice protein and ground psyllium husk to 'emulate' the 1.3 macros.  I end up with a bag being 635 cals, 45g protein, and 9.5g fiber (versus 500 cals, 21g protein, and 4g fiber)."
soylent,384brw,dreiter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"Well you just intake whatever works best for your lifestyle.  For example, I use Soylent to replace my breakfasts on the weekdays, but not lunch or dinner.  So 1 full bag lasts me 4 days.  I take a bag and pre-mix it with 90 grams of Nutribiotic rice protein and 18 grams of Yerba ground psyllium husk. Then for 1 portion I have 165 grams of pre-mix which gives the values I mentioned earlier.  It's not the most convenient, and I do wish Rosa Labs would offer some custom mix options (like a higher protein and fiber version), but it works fine for me and it's not too much hassle."

soylent,384brw,Skycakes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:58:04 2015 UTC,Going to 100% after just 3 days sounds a bit quick. Even the folks at Soylent say the process should be slow and gradual. So maybe it has something to do with that.

soylent,380mjo,Fluorescence,1 point,Sun May 31 23:48:21 2015 UTC,I didn't think I was getting all the vitamins listed before so I wonder what's up. I have my totals in the image. I don't think I was getting Omega anything beforehand so that's why I just left it low.I might try to increase Iron somehow. I mostly focussed on getting 100% in the main categories. Before this my diet was a series of Healthy Choice TV Dinners and an occasional bagel. I didn't think that was much more healthy than the People Chow.
soylent,380mjo,xsDaniel,2,Sun May 31 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something? Your totals are insane. You acknowledged iron is low (which is obliviously important for women), but more worrisome is how high some of the values are. You can overdose on selenium, for example (http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/selenosis).  You must have inputted the numbers wrong (micrograms vs grams?). Though I'm inclined to believe you didn't because you seem organized."
soylent,380mjo,xsDaniel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:57:52 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for responding! Yes I was using the site's converter so it messed up the values and trusted it because I was eating less than the recommended serving (It is a powdered supplement.) Here is a new image of what I was actually eating: http://imgur.com/ZPDuXP8
soylent,380mjo,xsDaniel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:24:16 2015 UTC,"The values for the original people chow value show you should have different values yourself? But going off what you have, in order of importance:   More Vitamin D, around 2500 IU is good. The government's recommendations are wrong, and higher amounts have been shown to alleviate depression and improve overall health. (http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/) (http://i.imgur.com/BY5V1Xb.png) Iron is too low. Omega 6 to Omega 3 ratio is too high. You want to strive for a ratio of about 3:1 (more Omega 3). Also helps with depression and overall health. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12442909) Phosphorous, Chloride, Vitamin E should be closer to 100%   As for head colds, maybe it's something from the list above. More likely, it's simply the fact you've taken such a dramatic change in your diet and your body needs to adjust. You can try to solve this by slowly introducing the food over a few weeks."

soylent,37urdn,MrWinks,4,Sat May 30 16:39:51 2015 UTC,This is the major advantage 1.4 has over 1.3 along with less gas issues for some people from what I can tell.  I always have 1.4 as a single serve made fresh while 1.3 I would leave overnight and consume the next day which was honestly more convenient than mixing each serve.  I just wish it didn't have the weird chemical smell and was more fulfilling like 1.3.
soylent,37urdn,fxfighter,3,Sun May 31 05:17:17 2015 UTC,I was very surprised to find that it tastes best mixed fresh and poured over ice. I couldn't keep it down the second time I had a premixed batch.

The way I was reading some of these posts (not all on Reddit, some on the official website) was like you were gagging to get it down and it was a horrible experience.  Needing a little cocoa powder wouldn't change that experience from that much of a positive into palatable."

soylent,37urdn,shpongolian,3,Mon Jun 1 00:44:51 2015 UTC,I just looked this up prior to saying it to make sure you still get the caffeine and apparently it works.  Instead of adding powdered caffeine why not throw in some ground coffee?  It might be a little grittier but it will add some slight flavor to it and give a bit of a boost.
soylent,37urdn,sork,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"If you have a French press you could cold-brew the coffee instead. Just put some grounds in the press and pour room-temp water over it, then let it sit in the fridge overnight and mix it with your Soylent the next morning.  I tried this once though and it tasted like ass. Grassy ass.  You could also try a 5-hour-energy.

Is Soylent really the worst tasting food you've ever eaten? Because if not, whatever that next-level food was, it sounds like you probably threw up on that one, since you could barely keep your Soylent down."
soylent,37urdn,coder543,0,Sun May 31 01:42:35 2015 UTC,I've gone through about a month's worth of Soylent so far and leaving it unflavored just doesn't work for me. That's all.   Vox made a video of people trying Soylent (with canola oil for some reason). I don't think the people who are saying they don't like it are being unreasonable as I happen to be one of them.
soylent,37urdn,Soylentconor,7,Sun May 31 02:07:20 2015 UTC,"""don't like"" is not the same as ""having to focus on not throwing up"" or ""inedible,"" at least not in my book."

soylent,37urdn,kronaz,5,Sat May 30 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"The flavor is kind of meaningless. It's so slight as to not be there. (I actually grew to like it over the course of 2 days). The texture is what I have difficulty with. The stuff is thicker and grittier than I imagined it would be. I've adapted by taking smaller sips, and that seems to be working well."
soylent,37urdn,numanoid,0,Sat May 30 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Have you tried making it single-serve? You end up with 600 mL per meal rather than the 500 mL you'd get from the pitcher. It's much runnier and easier to drink that way. Personally, I like it both ways, but if the thickness is your problem, try single-serve."

Anything as bland as 1.4 would seem horrible after something sweetened and flavored, I suppose.    Since I started with 1.4, I didn't have any complaints, other than it was boring.  I add a couple TBSP of cocoa powder (20 calories total) and a TBSP or so of Stevia, per pitcher, and it makes a nice, chocolatey treat."

soylent,37urdn,ken579,3,Sat May 30 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"The biggest hurdle for me was the entry-level cost. There should be a one-bag sample that you can buy to try it out.

soylent,37urdn,Subvers1on,2,Sun May 31 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna play double's advocate and summarize my experience, as a whiner:  I did a month of Joylent and then bought a month of Soylent. I could not finish my first two drinks of Soylent. It smelled incredibly sour and yeasty and bready to me. I was worried I got a spoiled batch until a friend and Soylent consumer checked it out.  But I believe I'm sensitive to those tastes and aromas. I can't eat a lot of white bread at once and I can't stomach sourdough.  Anyway, it was nothing like pancake batter. I don't know what kind of pancake batter you guys are drinking. I added coffee, sugar, and whey, and it still tasted awful.  I've adapted quickly and it's not that I now appreciate the flavor, but I simply don't detect as strong of an odor or taste the nuances I did before.  tl;dr humans adapt to inconvenient stimuli very easily, and if you're the kind of person that willingly buys and plans to consume Soylent, you can probably deal with the flavor for a few days until you get accustomed. whether you like it at first or not, it doesn't matter"

Don't finish your pitcher and then let it sit in the sink for a few hours. When you finish it, at least rinse the pitcher and the hardware with water for a minute, and it'll prevent dried solids that require soap and scrubbing.

soylent,37w4ie,funkyArmaDildo,2,Sun May 31 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"Just as an aside, I personally think it's best when consumed right after making.  So try it both ways and see what you like best."
soylent,37w4ie,funkyArmaDildo,1 point,Sun May 31 13:14:10 2015 UTC,I'll do that. Thanks for the advice.
soylent,37w4ie,funkyArmaDildo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:07:18 2015 UTC,Try it without letting stay. I personally like the fresh mixed soylent more. Also I suggest you get some milk splash or milk magic for flavoring.
soylent,37vwzj,rockyearth,6,Sat May 30 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"They're tested daily by most of us but the product is only a yearish old so that's the longest it could be tested. It's just food though, normal ingredients. There are always risks, the most common would be bioavailability for certain ingredients but that's the only thing I've heard so far that is a big concern as far as I remember."
soylent,37vwzj,_ilovetofu_,5,Sat May 30 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm no dietitian, but I'd rather chug soylent with a maybe-subpar bioavailability than eat pizza or ramen on a regular basis (nutritionwise; pizza is great occasionally)."
soylent,37vwzj,Seber,1 point,Sun May 31 10:44:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. Even if Soylent isn't perfect, my diet before was even farther from being perfect. Soylent is a step in the right direction, and I'm happy with that."

soylent,37vwzj,zaery,1 point,Sun May 31 03:36:10 2015 UTC,Plus which version of soylent you are applying to your eye will affect the taste.
soylent,37vwzj,chrisbair,3,Sun May 31 17:54:07 2015 UTC,Only for a few years. Everything in it is in other foods. It's only this particular combination and this application that's untested. Personally I'm of the opinion that it's less risky than other common food.  The closest thing you'd find would be any studies on medically prescribed meal replacements because they've been available for a longer period of time but Soylent is better than those products and results from medical meal replacement studies will likely be skewed due to the population that uses them.
soylent,37vwzj,SparklingLimeade,3,Sat May 30 22:16:52 2015 UTC,Maltodextrin is a high glycemic index (fast digesting) carbohydrate. For many purposes it may as well be sugar. That's all there is to it. Exactly how much maltodextrin is too much and to what degree the other components in soylent mitigate the problems caused by maltodextrin's high glycemic index are topics of hot debate.
soylent,37vwzj,SparklingLimeade,4,Sat May 30 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"If that's a concern to you, you can always go the the opposite extreme and check out some of the ketogenic varieties of soylent. As a general rule they contain 15-50g of carbohydrates per day with insanely low glycemic indexes."
soylent,37vwzj,chrisbair,2,Sat May 30 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"Not really, there are several different ones in the side bar. Personally I'm doing ketogenic soylent and it's working incredibly well. Whether you mix your own using the recipes on diy.soylent.me or not it's something you should look into if you are worried about the effects of soylent on blood sugar levels."
soylent,37vwzj,chrisbair,1 point,Sat May 30 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Besides, if I get into shameless self promotion the mods put me in time out."
soylent,37vwzj,chrisbair,-1,Sun May 31 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"The issue with high GI corn maltodextrin is that it when you consume only it, it absorbs incredibly fast and spikes your insulin.  Soylent contains a lot of fibre, and uses a lower GI tapioca maltodextrin, so this slows down the absorption, meaning no insulin spike for most folks. No worries"
soylent,37vwzj,ImmaculateJackson,1 point,Sun May 31 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"well, if by ""a lot of fiber"" you mean it's 40% deficient from the RDA, sure.  that is a change in 1.4."

soylent,37ul49,ryanmercer,2,Mon Jun 1 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"GOMAD is in addition to current dietary intake, so yes if you change nothing else and drop a gallon of milk... then in theory you'd lose a pound or so a day for a while."

soylent,37s648,PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK,4,Fri May 29 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend Hydro Flasks enough. They keep cold drinks COLD for 24+ hours. I have a larger one for ice water, and I regularly put ice + water in at 10am, and the ice is still there at 10am the next day.   This size hyrdoflask is almost exactly 1 serving of soylent, so its perfect for a lunch/dinner serving. No more worrying that it will get warm!"
soylent,37s648,senorjoo,1 point,Fri May 29 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a fan of the 32 oz. It's exactly half a day's worth, so I can fill it up and take it to work and have breakfast & lunch, clean it out, take it home, and fill it up again to drink throughout the evening for dinner. Plus - since I'll have at most one non-Soylent meal a day that I let be the other 'half' of my food - if I do have a non-Soylent meal for lunch, then the HydroFlask keeps my dinner (the other half of the bottle) cold until whenever I want to eat it at night. It's really been a near-perfect system for me. They also have a 40oz, if you're the kind of person that splits your Soylent into thirds. It's just shy of 2/3 of a day's worth, so it'd still be good for taking breakfast and lunch work (or lunch and dinner, you get the idea...). Anyway, I absolutely love this bottle. I can't recommend it enough, whatever size you choose."
soylent,37s648,JustAnotherCop,2,Sat May 30 11:07:28 2015 UTC,Hydroflasks are fantastic.  I've got 2.  This one you linked to and then 40oz.  Love them both.  Use this one for EDC and the other as a growler since it's airtight.

soylent,37si4z,vertthrasher,4,Sat May 30 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're not very different. My go-to comparisons also involve breakfast cereal, especially oatmeal and other porridges. A cereal company could make a soylent-type product if they did some broad fortification with micronutrients, protein, and maybe a fat source of some type (mmm almond slivers). Soylent could be formed into kibbles and eaten. It would probably taste about like the non-marshmallow portion of lucky charms I'd guess.  You see why soylent producers haven't done that. I'm not sure why cereal makers haven't made a venture or two in this direction. It's surprising in general how this niche was previously so unfilled though."
soylent,37si4z,SparklingLimeade,3,Sat May 30 06:26:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the main difference is that cereal doesn't pretend to be filling, nutritionally complete, or good for you, and I don't know where you get the idea that you shouldn't believe the nutritional information printed on the packaging. It's like asking how is Soylent different from flour, or toast, or corned beef - none of those foods are healthy or nutritionally complete.  Sometimes people compare Soylent to Ensure and that is a semi-plausible comparison."
soylent,37si4z,hugecock6969,7,Sat May 30 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Do you know regular people that eat entire meals of flour? toast? corned beef?  I don't.  Do you know regular people that eat entire meals of ensure? Not personally; not on a regular basis.  Do you know regular people that eat entire meals of cereal on a daily basis?  I do.  That's why I use it as an analogy for people who are unfamiliar or look down on it.  The more I use the analogy, the more I get to thinking that it has a weight of truth to it.  I just want to make sure that I'm not fundamentally wrong.  As a thought experiment, how hard would it be for Kelloggs to come out with a cereal that is actually nutritionally complete and cost competitive with Soylent?  Is there even a market for it?"
soylent,37si4z,ppphhh,4,Sat May 30 01:48:03 2015 UTC,As an aside it's fairly common in Britain for people's breakfast to be solely toast. Not that I think it's particularly well-rounded in terms of nutrition.

And then there is the Dilberito by the Dilbert comic author, who basically made a single-meal microwave food that can sustain you for 24 hours. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilberito It isn't like no one else had tried it.

soylent,37si4z,vagif,1 point,Sat May 30 16:30:40 2015 UTC,You are assuming that the form is a choice. It is not. It is a natural consequence of the raw materials used. Cereal is in the form it is because the materials used to make it allow for such form to be manufactured cheaply and on a large scale.  And the powder is a preferred form of various soylents because that's the most economically viable form to achieve the goal of combining all the required nutrients together.  For example first versions of Soylent had a separate oil bottle. This choice was dictated purely by the economics of production.  Later the alternative (algae powder) was discovered to be just as economically viable.  Perhaps one day someone wil discover a economically viable way to make fully nutritional cereals. But do not expect it to be easy. It will definitely be a more complex procedure than just combining powders.

The chocolate flavor doesn't taste bad at all to me; I actually like the crunchy texture, but I think that's where I differ from most people.

soylent,37lro8,slvspartan,1 point,Thu May 28 18:30:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I tried all 3 flavors and chocolate was the least gross haha. You should really try Soylent man. 100% Food's only advantage is that it's easier to prepare because it comes sorted in the individual bottles.
soylent,37lro8,adamrgisom,1 point,Thu May 28 18:33:54 2015 UTC,I switched from 100% food to soylent due to a price change and a recipe change in the original as I usually ordered half chocolate/original .   100% has only 3 servings(which I preferred as im using soylent like products to gain weight more easily) a day vs soylents 4. In addition 100% is generally sweeter than Soylent and has some textures to it.  Both of which can be pros or cons.  Soylent's salty / sweet and a little more bland flavor was hard going down at first but because the servings are smaller it wasnt a big struggle. I've grown to like the flavor and lack of texture a little more whereas 100% needed a lot more water than the recommend to go down smoothly.  Also the look of Soylent after it's been mixed is aesthetically pleasing. Soylent also offers a starter kit and free shipping which is a big plus  What 100% does differently that I like is the variety of flavors and recipes that cater to different diets (soylent doesn't have enough protein as I'd like). They also offered their product without the bottles to make it more affordable. If you'd like me to elaborate more I can.
soylent,37lro8,lasershurt,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, is a 100% food serving 670 cals? Because 670x3 = 2010cals ~= 500x4 = 2000cals in Soylent. Soylent ""servings"" are 500cals. It's a good serving size, I never consume more than 500 cals at a time anyway (about 2-2.5 cups). Do I feel just as full as 670 cals of other foods? That's a good question I'm not sure about yet."

soylent,37o94g,Guv_Bubbs,14,Fri May 29 02:35:13 2015 UTC,No. The rice protein was reduced for digestibility issues. There's a theory that it's one of several factors that contributed to the devastating gas. /u/axcho made a great explanation of it in one of his posts about his exploration of protein options.
soylent,37o94g,SparklingLimeade,3,Fri May 29 08:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that the main reason they reduced the rice protein was for better digestibility. If you want to talk about reducing costs, it's powdered oils that costs even more than protein. If they wanted to reduce costs, they would not have increased fat to 40% and used powdered oils at the same time."

Normal consumers don't care if someone doesn't also like a product that they like. It is weird to me how angry the responses I have been getting are. I want this to be a subreddit where people can disagree with each other without being disagreeable.   To make a comparison, I am also a member of the Tesla Motors subreddit. Many members (including myself) are fanatics about the car. However there are many threads where people have open and honest discussions about the negatives of the cars WITHOUT attacking each other.  It is questionable that soylent significantly decreased the most expensive ingredient after receiving a $20 million investment. Several posters have attacked me for asking this question and said these venture capitalists are different then regular venture capitalists. Telling me that venture capitalists don't care about cost savings hurts my head.   If they could make 1.3 available again I will eat my words and I will buy soylent again."

Take a fresh look at your comment. What you do here is name-calling.   And Rob dutifully obeyed his new master and replaced the protein with crapola.   You are calling a nutritious ingredient crapola. You are calling someone, indirectly, either a slave or a puppet.  It is routine, not weird, for people to respond angrily to name-calling."
soylent,37o94g,Unbathed,-4,Fri May 29 15:36:01 2015 UTC,I stand by what I said.  Here are the facts:  Fact 1: Soylent decreased protein content by 40 grams per day and increased sugar content by 30 grams per day.   Fact 2: If someone gives you 20 million dollars you are working for them.
soylent,37o94g,jctennis123,6,Fri May 29 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"Note that number 2 is not a fact.   Note that neither of these statements are ""I preferred 1.3 to 1.4."" If you received angry responses to ""I preferred 1.3 to 1.4,"" that would be weird."

I know several people are unhappy about the protein decrease.  But the rest of us are mostly indifferent to it. I'm still meeting my daily goals and am happy with v1.4.   Fact 2: If someone gives you 20 million dollars you are working for them.   Not quite.  Speaking as someone who has touched the startup world in a couple of facets, such investors would not want to inspire rapid change that would upset the community.  That's not to say that they will look to 'cheapen' the formula in the future, but it doesn't make sense (from a business standpoint) to do this right now."

Also, not for nothing, but do you have inside info on their purchase order and what kind of deals they are getting on ingredients? How do you know what they paid for brown rice protein? Honest question.  I'm not dismissing your opinion outright, it just seems like you are weaving a tapestry of assumptions and presenting it as fact."
soylent,37o94g,stevesy17,-2,Fri May 29 15:19:59 2015 UTC,Brown rice protein is about 3x more expensive than oat flour and 5x more expensive than maltodextrin from corn at retail. Maltodextrin and oat flour were the primary source of carbohydrates in versions 1.1-1.3.   Decreasing protein and increasing carbs and sugars is a Mcdonalds move. It's buying a burger but finding out the patty is smaller and the buns are bigger.
soylent,37o94g,jctennis123,3,Fri May 29 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"In case you were not aware, they actually reduced Maltodextrin and added Isomaltulose, which counts as a ""Sugar"" for the label but is a much slower-releasing substance which does not produce the characteristic spike in blood sugar that ""sugar"" does."

soylent,37nj0k,lasershurt,1 point,Sat May 30 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"You can definitely eat Soylent with your lifestyle, just adjusting for the fact that 2000 calories is only going to be a portion of what you need.  I've had good luck with dumping protein powder in mine, but make sure you get a good Protein that you know works for you. I got a different type recently, on a whim, and it has some digestive side-effects that I'm not thrilled about."
soylent,37nj0k,anothermomhere,1 point,Fri May 29 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not training but former triathlete/marathon/cyclist. I see no reason why Soylent wouldn't work, maybe not for every meal but for several during the training process. I'd make sure you are getting enough protein, particularly post workout but you can probably achieve that with adding protein powder. I would not use it for food while riding/running for a few reasons (such as it may not appeal to a stress challenged stomach, and I also like it very cold, fresh out of the fridge). I think it would be fine pre or post though."
soylent,37nj0k,kenzieone,1 point,Fri May 29 01:22:16 2015 UTC,"Bike tourer here. Currently going from San Francisco to Boston, 60-80 miles a day. I've been drinking about a third of a bag of soylent a day- one drink spread throughout the day during the ride and one drink at night so I digest it while asleep. It's great- I have a tough time getting the macros I need on tour. In fact, before I really figured out the logistics of getting soylent shipped to me across the U.S., I wasn't getting enough fat. At all. I ran out of fat, which for someone as thin as I am is a real issue.  Plus, it's way cheaper than other nutritional shakes, better for you, often better tasting, and convienent. I would however take a long look at soylents nutrition and your workout or exercise of choice and go from there- I take tons of fish oil with my soylent and aim for absolutely ridiculous amounts of carbs and protein with my normal diet, whereas a bodybuilder may want to avoid all carbs and especially fat and just go straight protein."
soylent,37nj0k,FBomher,0,Tue Jun 2 12:46:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a triathalete, but I do 5AM CrossFit M-F and run on the weekends. For the longest time I could not eat enough to maintain a consistent weight, mostly because I don't enjoy the whole food preparation process. Plus I would hit a wall in some of my workouts where it just felt like all my energy was depleted.  I've been on powdered food for about a year now, I use it for about 85% of my meals. Generally M-Th it's 100% of what I eat. My energy in my workouts has never been more consistent and I was able to get back to my ideal weight and now I maintain that weight (outside of normal water fluctuation).  I used an RMR calculator to tell me exactly how many calories I need to gain/maintain my weight, using the powdered food makes it very easy to count/manage calories.  I don't use Soylent though, I use one called JouleFuel. I like that it doesn't have maltodextrin and it has a quality whey protein, plus it comes in 2800 calories bags which is more in line with what I need."

soylent,37n4if,lasershurt,2,Thu May 28 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"How long did you let it sit? It's gritty at first, then after sitting (in the fridge) it becomes smoother and smoother (and clumps go away). After some time, it starts to become a bit thicker, too, so there's sort of a window for ""best texture.""  Personally I don't mind it thicker, and lately I've been drinking it right after mixing without chilling, so it's grittier - I think that after you're used to it, your tolerance for texture gets better because you're quite familiar with the flavor and general soylentiness."

That said, I've got a minute, so here are the short answers:  1.) Yes, lots of people use it to lose weight. It's super easy to control your exact intake, and to be sure that while you're controlling intake you're still getting the nutrients you need.  2.) Ease into it at first - don't go 100% soylent right off the bat. Most people have no digestive issues, but if you do it might be a bit of gas/changes to your BMs. Once you're rolling, though, most people notice no difference between soylent and regular food, and can switch between them (social meals, etc) whenever needed.  3.) Healthier is very personal - my health wasn't bad before starting, thanks to my wife, but if I were left to my own devices for food I know I'd be better off with Soylent. It really depends on how bad your diet is now, and what health issues you might have related to it. Some folks have had their bloodwork done and tracked health very closely, for quite some time, and never had any adverse effects."

Our study included 18 different measurements—weight, cholesterol, sodium, blood protein levels, sleep quality, well-being, etc.—from 15 people. That study design is a recipe for false positives. Think of the measurements as lottery tickets. Each one has a small chance of paying off in the form of a “significant” result that we can spin a story around and sell to the media.""   I understand this is quite off topic for this sub, but now that we are starting to be able to customize our meals with the exact components that we want, IMHO this is a quite useful knowledge to have."

Soylent only contains Soy in the form of soy lecithin.  Soy isoflavones contain phytoestrogen , but most studies say this has little to no effect on humans.

The other issue? 1 serving is 130 kcal so you'd quickly raise above your upper intake limits when you're going for say... 15 servings to meet calorie requirements. That and each serving is $4.30. Even if you don't go for a full daily meal replacement and only take enough for your vitamins and minerals, you're still looking at least 4 drinks(servings)/day for (to get that 9g of Iron)... that alone would cost you $17 + food to compensate for the lacking ~1500 calories. 30 days at $17 is over $500."

Soy can grow in a lot more soils, a lot more regions and under worse conditions than a LOT of other crops, you can be rest assured a lot of the disinformation/misinformation comes from interests groups funded by those that farm other crops or induestries that rely on other crops. This is in fact how marijuana originally was made illegal, cotton growers were afraid of hemp and did all they could to make hemp look evil anyway they can (they did this by targeting marijuana).   Just because you read something on a forum, blog posts, or hear Oprah's favorite doctor talk about it on television doesn't mean it's true. Soy is no where near as evil as people make it out to be.

soylent,37i28n,ZorbaTHut,2,Wed May 27 23:53:46 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love ketochow made with flavorless protein powder. This is because it is completely flavorless. You cannot get bored of it because there is nothing to get bored of.  And if you want to flavor it, you can go hog-wild and add whatever you damn well please. It won't conflict with the base flavors because, again, there is no base flavor to conflict with.  It's probably the most neutral thing I've ever tasted. At least to my taste buds, it actually has less character than water."

If I can jam necessary calories down my maw in the least offensive way possible, then I have more time for (and appreciation for!) food that I intend to actually enjoy.  Plus, if I feel like flavoring the stuff, I can do so without worrying about flavor conflicts."
soylent,37i28n,jd_edc,2,Thu May 28 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going through all four flavors of Joylent. I just kind of mix them together as I go. 2/3 chocolate 1/3 banana. Or strawberry-vanilla. I've kind of come to the decision that they all sorta taste the same. They might have a strongish flavored odor, but it doesn't really seem to change the taste that much. Kinda neat mixing it up though and feeling like I'm not just suffering the same thing over and over."
soylent,37hahs,captainflyte,7,Wed May 27 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"You might want to try preparing it with either more water or less water. The amount of powder you use is all that matters when determining a serving, after all. 50% more water would make it very thin; maybe that would work for you.  You could also try using distilled or spring water instead of tap water. I've read that making it with very cold water isn't as good as using room temperature and then chilling it after mixing."
soylent,37hahs,Hiten_Style,3,Wed May 27 17:27:08 2015 UTC,Tomorrow this is my plan. half the bag and a full pitcher of water. Im fine drinking more water anyway.  also I don't have tap water. I have unfiltered/unaltered well water. That could affect it I guess?
soylent,37hahs,Hiten_Style,2,Wed May 27 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"Before you give up on it, I would absolutely advise you to try it with another source of water. I'm no...hydrologist, but I could easily see the bad texture being the result of minerals present in the well water."
soylent,37hahs,thebandgap,1 point,Wed May 27 18:11:44 2015 UTC,this guy gets it. I'm a chemist and also a well owner. Well water has quite a few more mineral components then city tap water.  My first solent experience was very similar to yours. I would advise using a brita or any other water filtration system. I blend it with a banna too.
soylent,37hahs,MongolianTrojanHorse,3,Wed May 27 22:37:09 2015 UTC,Have you tried drinking it immediately after mixing? I prepare every serving individually and consume it immediately. I also find that it becomes slimy after a few hours in the fridge but drinking it right after preparation solves that for me.
soylent,37hahs,ryanmercer,2,Wed May 27 17:56:35 2015 UTC,"As others have said, play with the amount of water you are using to see if you can't dial in a consistency that you can handle."

soylent,37hahs,fxfighter,1 point,Wed May 27 17:22:51 2015 UTC,It's a pretty common response from people who dont blend the mixture and try to mix via shaking. Visit the discourse forums and you'll find a lot of identical responses.   I had the exact same issue where leaving it overnight turned into some mucus like substance and wouldn't go away without blending & additional water.   Since I dont want to use a blender I swapped over to making each meal in a blender bottle I have and haven't had much of an issue.

I drink 300 grams (prepared weight) for breakfast, pour 700 grams into a Thermos for lunch at work, then drink the rest (about 900 grams) for supper.  I have never noticed any sliminess.

soylent,37hahs,anothermomhere,1 point,Wed May 27 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"The texture is coming from the oat beta-glucans (many health benefits, but a slippery texture).

Soylent 1.1 had alpha-galactosidase and the addition of the enzyme reduced viscosity and ""sliminess"" caused by the oats."

soylent,37hahs,jctennis123,2,Fri May 29 06:08:10 2015 UTC,Too bad you didn't get to try 1.3. It tasted like a vanilla milkshake and had a high protein and low sugar content.  Contrast that to 1.4 which has a slimy texture and a salty taste.  It also contains 40 grams LESS protein and 30 grams MORE sugar. I find it unpalatable.
soylent,37hahs,timdorr,2,Wed May 27 19:21:43 2015 UTC,"I tried 1.3 and found it awful, but I really like 1.4 (what I had first). I find myself craving it now, especially when I've been eating solid food only for a few days. I like the taste and texture as is, but with coffee it's pretty good too."
soylent,37hahs,jctennis123,2,Fri May 29 01:10:29 2015 UTC,You really should read the blog post about sugar content.
soylent,37hahs,timdorr,-1,Wed May 27 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your unhelpful comment.  For the record, I've read all of their blog posts. I was a soylent fanatic until 1.4 came out. I read Rob Rhinehart's first blogpost ever over three years ago - the one where he described his idea and his experiment. This was before the kickstarter campaign and before it ever had the name 'soylent.'   I have some thoughts about what is going on behind the scenes. Rob initially took months and months to deliver the first batches from the kickstarter campaign. This is because none of his employees had this kind of business experience (manufacturing & distribution) beforehand. How do I know? If you looked at the list of employees it was all a bunch of other kids the same age as Rob. I believe inexperience was the reason for his initial delay. I ordered a batch in June and didn't receive it until November. Others waited much longer.   Additionally, right before the 1.4 updates, Rob received a big investment in order to increase his manufacturing and distribution capacity (he discusses this in a blog post). I believe this investor came in and used their leverage to 'cheapen' the formula. Why cheapen? Brown rice protein is 3 to 5 times as expensive as carbohydrates (depending on the source of carbohydrates). Whether this went on behind the scenes or not the fact is they reduced the amount of the most expensive ingredient in soylent (brown rice protein) by 40 grams per day.   I can picture an investor coming in and saying, 'Your margins are not high enough, we are going to invest in your company to help you meet demand but you have to find a way to lower the cost of production.' And Rob dutifully obeyed his new master and replaced the protein with crapola.   From wikipedia: ""The first shipments of U.S. orders began in the first week of May 2014.[5] In January 2015, Soylent received $20 million in Series A round funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz.[6] In February 2015, Soylent released version 1.4 with changes..."""
soylent,37hahs,jctennis123,9,Wed May 27 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"But you do know a16z led the previous seed round, right? https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/f1c8cfebb480d4df165dd36ecf23426b  There was no big new investor for the Series A. They were simply infusing cash because they believe in the plan Rob and company have in store for Soylent. This enables them to specifically not have to worry about cost-cutting measures. They can proceed with whatever plan makes sense from a company-building perspective.   A16z isn't packed with idiot investors. They're thinking of the next decade for this company. They're one of the top VC firms in the Valley for a good reason. They aren't Bain Capital. They're not coming in to turn a quick profit. They want to create a billion dollar company, and it takes time and careful consideration to do that.  I don't think 1.4 is the best, but I've not found it to be an untenable change. There will always be tweaking to be done. I think 1.4 fixed more than it messed up, so it's a step in the right direction. But hopefully 1.5 will come along soon enough to appease everyone..."
soylent,37hahs,technicalthrowaway,-6,Fri May 29 04:53:10 2015 UTC,I'm not going to argue with you. I have learned that is the worst way to change someone's mind. Especially on the internet.   What I will do is restate some of your assumptions:  -20 Million Dollars is a 'simple cash infusion' not a big new investment  -These venture capitalists aren't worrying about cost cutting measures  -These venture capitalists don't want a quick profit  -These venture capitalists think soylent can become a billion dollar company  -I don't think 1.4 is the best  4 of those 5 statements hurt my brain. 1 of those statements I agree with completely.
soylent,37hahs,Soylentconor,5,Fri May 29 05:12:54 2015 UTC,"You have the first point wrong. I said there isn't a new investor, not that this isn't a new investment. This is a simple fact. Andressen Horowitz (a16z) led both the previous seed round and the Series A $20mm round. The players are all the same.   Maybe you had a bad experience with an investor in the past, but the good ones don't try to run a company into the ground. They can't turn all that cheap Series A stock into boatloads cash if the company doesn't get acquired or IPO..."
soylent,37hahs,PoopMachin3,-2,Fri May 29 05:29:59 2015 UTC,I think my comments have made you agitated. I'm not here to say you're wrong and I'm right. That would benefit nothing but my ego but be otherwise totally useless.   I don't personally know soylents investors so maybe I'm wrong about my assumptions. It sounds like you have some pretty strong opinions about their investment strategies but forgive me if I don't take the word of someone I don't know on the Internet. If you can back up what you say with facts that would be a lot more helpful. My knowledge about how investors make decisions is from shark tank. Not the best resource but a pretty good resource nonetheless. They are always telling the entrepreneurs to get costs down. That's why I am surprised that you say soylents investors are different.
soylent,37hahs,jctennis123,2,Fri May 29 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"You made assertions about the investment and investors, but you just said you don't know much about it. I'm more inclined to believe the words of someone who at least indicates they're familiar with the investment over your word, because you've just said you don't know much about it.  Knowledge of the details of an investment is different from the opinion you're claiming it is."
soylent,37hahs,Soylentconor,4,Fri May 29 14:05:24 2015 UTC,Lowering the protein content was not driven  by cost cutting. It was driven by nutritional research. I'm sorry your 1.4 experience has not been satisfactory. Due to us targeting a neutral taste profile many people react differently to 1.4.

I order 90 meals at a time and that lasts me for 2-3 months therefore I ended up with 4 different recipes. I think the last one I received is the best yet. The first time I tried it, I was disgusted by it. It was my first time trying Strawberry and I really hated it and the consistency wasn't the same and I started wondering it all the flavours were going to be like that now. The next day I added more water and it was much better. Now Strawberry is my 2nd best flavour and I have no problem with it. As for the other flavours, I didn't notice any major changes in taste except maybe Vanilla seems to have been toned down which I like because I thought it was really too strong to begin with.    Overall, I'd say that with every order it always took me a few days to get used to the new taste of Joylent but that after 1 week or so it tasted really good."

One mug for breakfast at home, one mug for lunch at work, and one mug for dinner when I get home is 1500 calories.  Then I have other food for the other 500 calories at some point during the day."

It's hemp hearts and flax seed and chia and whatnot.  Just dry things you add water to.  The texture isn't for everyone though, as the chia usually makes people want to chew.

I take a bag with 2 blender bottles and three bottles of water in my truck. Around mid day I pour a bottle of water into one blender bottle, shake it up and drink it while I'm driving. Then I pour 1/2 a bottle of water into the empty blender bottle and shake it up and drink it. That cleans it out and helps to keep me hydrated. Then I shake up another bottle around mid afternoon/early evening and clean it out with the other half bottle of water.  Part of the reason I started doing Soylent was to lose weight. This method helps me avoid those gas station donuts and truck stop pizzas that were making me fat."

I've heard of people adding cocoa (sweet Dutch type) or adding fruits in a blender or some type of sweetener like honey or maybe artificial sweetener.   But the simplest fix may be to just add a little more water. I prefer my soylent extra thin.   Lastly, some people like to leave their mix in the fridge for a few hours. Soaking makes for a smoother (thicker) experience. Personally I like thin and gritty so I drink mine immediately after adding the water."

Seriously, unless you are a creationist... fruit would have been a treat in the wild for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of years of evolution leading to you and me. Go walk around some prairie or forest, not a whole lot of fruit even during the small window where it is produced and ripe each year.   Starting your morning off with that sugar is immediately replenishing your glycogen stores (which is right there telling your body 'screw drawing on fat stores we got suuuuugggggaaaarrrr baby!' which if you're trying to lose weight there is benefit to not replenishing those stores right after cardio if you don't plan on lifting heavy), it's also giving the (mostly) 'bad' bacteria in your gut a ready supply of sugars to start fermenting.   If I were you I'd drop the fruit, add an egg or two and fry/scramble those eggs in some butter (grass fed, not for the omega's but for the extra vitamin k... good for your teeth and bones) and I'd avoid any carb source until your soylent at lunch (carbless post workout has good science behind it if loss of adipsoe tissue is a goal)."

soylent,37citx,ryanmercer,-1,Wed May 27 07:56:51 2015 UTC,"No, the human body didn't evolve eating truckloads of sugar. The 'baddies' in your gut microbiome very much feed on sugars, which leads to them creating gas as a waste product. This leads to bloating. That's no bro science, that's science.  As far as the carbless post workout, there is plenty of science supporting it. It's primarily an insulin sensitivity thing. By consuming carbs (especially in quantity) post workout you lower insulin sensitivity (which has several complications related to adipose tissue), you also effect the body's ability/desire to draw on fat stores to replenish those glycogen stores via gluconeogenesis. That's pretty basic biology, bro."

soylent,37citx,Nicolent,1 point,Wed May 27 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"How is that relevant to whether or not it generates an insulin response in healthy people? If there is glucose in a diabetic's system after eating fruit it indicates that there wasn't a proper insulin response. You can infer that since healthy people don't have glucose spikes after eating fruit it's because we have a normal insulin response to eliminate the glucose.  But since you insist...here's another study done on healthy individuals with oranges, grapes and their juices. They were comparing insulin responses between fruits and juices, but all of them had a significant serum insulin response."
soylent,37citx,ryanmercer,-1,Wed May 27 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"Eating whole fruits    Orange juice isn't a 'whole fruit'.   Eating whole fruits doesn't generate any insulin respons at all. Google it,   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1395467  Just reading the abstract of the above paper, under-ripened bananas this may be true (green) however over-ripened (as in yellow, to yellow brown peel how people actually eat their bananas) causes about 60% of the response of white bread.   You also fail to acknowledge they are still a source of carbohydrates, which your muscles prefer to use as fuel. You work on depleting glycogen stores and then avoid carbohydrates and your body works to replentish them via gluconeogenesis from adipose tissue. Which doing this regularly, over a period of weeks or months adds up to noticeable loss of adipose tissue that otherwise wouldn't be taking place.."
soylent,37citx,ryanmercer,3,Wed May 27 11:12:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Here's what i'm going to do tomorrow for breakfast, tell me if you like:   Wake up at 6:45am, go for a 300 calorie run (approx. 40 minutes) (thanks apple watch) Come home, down 16oz of water, do yoga (for stretching) for about 20 minutes Eat 2 hard boiled eggs (no added seasoning) Eat 2 scrambled eggs, with a little grass fed butter) Eat half a avocado Drink another 16oz of water Shower start my day Drink 1 serving of soylent + Psyllium husk (slowly for 15-20 minutes) for lunch 500 calories + Drink 16oz of water Drink 1 serving of soylent + Psyllium husk (slowly for 15-20 minutes) for snack 500 calories (around 3pm) Drink 1 serving of soylent + Psyllium husk (slowly for 15-20 minutes) for dinner 500 calories + Drink 16oz of water (around 7pm) Go to bed around midnight   Do this everyday, taking Sunday off from the exercise and eating soylent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I want to do this for 3.5 months straight in hopes to get to 175 from 205. Thoughts?"
soylent,37citx,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue May 26 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"(thanks apple watch)   I hate you. I ordered mine about 5 minutes after they went on sale... it still hasn't shipped. Suppsoed to in the next 3-17 days.  1.) don't run for calories, cardio for weight loss is stupid. An everage adult male needs to run a MARATHON and then some to burn a pound's worth of kcals. If you like running, do some running do some walking do some all out sprints. There will be cardiovascular benefits there and you'll be expending more energy than sitting on your butt at home.  2.) Just eat. Some days if you are lazy have some hardboiled eggs, some days if you aren't lazy fry or scramble some eggs up. Have the avocado all or none of them. It's Friday and you really want some sweet... have a banana or some OJ it's been a week or two since you had one.   3.) I personally woudln't supplement fiber. There have been several studies showing high fiber SUPPLEMENTATION might be doing more harm than good. Possible culprit of colo-rectal cancer when supplemented in quantity. More and more science is pointoing to you not needed large amounts of fiber. Also, fiber itself can cause gas (depending on the type of fiber, your gut microbiome etc). Wait a month, see if your stool situation improves before adding in fiber and then do your own research before deciding on supplementing fiber or not.  4.) You are absolutely NOT sleeping enough for optimal health, especially for fat loss. If you fell asleep the second you hit your pillow you'd be getting less than 7 hours of sleep. Shoot for 8 hours for a while, if you notice a benefit creep up towards 8 1/2, if no more noticeable differences back down to 8. If you don't notice a huge difference at 8 hours, maybethe 6-6 1/2 you are getitng works for you but I doubt it does. Since you don't appear to be doing regular weight training you won't need to get to the 10 hour range, but 7 1/2-8 hours is probably going to make a difference in your life (recovery, appetite, lower stress hormone levels, improve sex hormone levels and various brain hormones etc)."

I think I've heard stories where feelings of bloatness (probably not a word) and upset tummy was solved by drinking it a bit slower. It can be tempting to gulp it down like a tall glass of water, but supposedly it works better taking it a bit slower, let it take 15-20 minutes to consume it all maybe? Worth trying to see if it helps."
soylent,37citx,Potat4o,3,Tue May 26 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think (complete hypothesis, no real evidence) that it probably has something to do with the fact that you blend/shake a lot of air into it right before you drink it. There are TONS of bubbles in there, so taking your time drinking it might help those bubbles come out a bit as you go."

soylent,37bner,JasonBratwurst,2,Wed May 27 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Like I said, my diet is mainly soylent right now. My other go to meal is raw egg over rice (don't knock it until you try it). And various junk-ish foods like hamburgers, pizza, chicken tenders and the like. Soylent has been a bit of a godsend, because while I'm not big on straight-up junkfood (soda, potato chips, candy bars and whatnot), I have trouble eating really healthy.  I workout with a kettlebell a couple of times of week, and go running and do martial arts on other days."

soylent,37c5uz,Iazu_S,5,Tue May 26 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Answers!   1) Remember, Soylent is made with a good amount of water. You'll still need to drink water outside of it, of course. But I've found that my water needs haven't changed dramatically either way since starting on Soylent. So, I'd plan on drinking the same amount of water you are currently.  2) Other people have addressed this. I don't drink often enough to know really.  3) Consider Soylent as real food, calorie-wise. If you're currently eating way over 2000 calories a day on regular food, then dropping down to a 2000 calorie bag of Soylent a day will definitely leave you with less energy.  4) Like above, if you're currently taking in food before you work out then just sub that out with Soylent."

YMMV. 2) I did one night of moderate drinking on just Soylent in my gut and had no problem. There's a lot of fiber in Soylent and it absorbs nicely. I did piss more than usual that night, but had no after-effects. 3) I'm a desk jockey, I can't speak to your physical needs.

soylent,37cx38,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue May 26 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"First I'd start doing some mobility work regularly, try searching things like ""CrossFit mobility"" ""power lifting mobility"" look for stuff that's targeting those joints. Most of it's going to involve resistance bands it might not help a ton but it should be noticeable after a while anyway.  For the knees, start squatting. Body weight squats at first and make sure someone competent is watching your form. Then alone I'd get a bar (doesn't even have to be an oly bar, just a cheapo bar and some cheapo concrete/plastic plates from craigslist or something) and you could start doing weighted front squats once your mobility and form are good. Unless you have some serious damage in the knees where something is actually grinding on something and even walking is risky... you'll probably start to see improvement in the knee pain with proper form and non world-record-breaking weights. Front squats would be the safest to do alone as it's easier/safer to ditch the bar from a front squat as you just drop your elbows and tilt your palms forward and step back at the same time. Google stuff like 'squatting improves knee pain' and variations of that for someone other than me's word on it."
