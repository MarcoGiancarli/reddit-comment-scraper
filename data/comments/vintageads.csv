vintageads,3dio6x,no-fun-at-parties,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"The traveling salesperson (TSP) problem solves the problem of ""in which order should you visit locations to minimize trip distance"". Google Maps / nav systems figure out the best routes between a set of already-ordered destinations; they tend to let you figure out the order.   TSP is an interesting problem because there is no perfect algorithm that doesn't take an exponential amount of time to solve - that is, suppose you have a program that takes 10ms to find the fastest order in which to visit 5 destinations. If you're a census-taker trying to visit 20 homes today, it doesn't take 40 milliseconds, it takes 2.72 minutes. If you're UPS trying to get 100 packages delivered, the time to calculate the fastest route is longer than the universe has existed.   There are many programs that get reasonably close to a perfect solution, and in fact can prove how close to a perfect solution they get (wikipedia says 'within 3% of the best possible route'), but do so much, much faster. These are what delivery companies use, sometimes with their own tweaks (such as UPS's famous ""avoid left turns"" routing)."

The natives are all exactly alike, since they're all the same color they might as well have the same face (except white people, who were allowed to have personalities and distinct traits). The depiction of the natives is that of curious, innocent children, of course - the good savages.  Anyway, this is from 1945. What we call racism today was just everyday life back then. We can analyze these things from our modern point of view, but this often leads nowhere. In historical context, the image makes perfect sense."

vintageads,30igma,coladict,2,Fri Mar 27 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting trivia particularly relevant to Non-Australians. The man in the video is ""Malcolm Douglas"", one of the true original TV ""Bush Expert"" characters on Television in Australia. In short, Steve Irwin's entire ""schtick"" was basically a dumbed-down, adrenaline filled version of Malcolm Douglas. If you search on youtube you can find episodes from some of Douglas' last episodes which aired back in around 2007 or 8 if memory serves. They're part wildlife documentary, part ethnographic, part bush cooking/survival skills and all charm. A much slower pace than Steve Irwin's stuff, but far more honest and down to earth.   And sadly, I say ""last"" episodes because tragically around 5 years ago, Douglas was killed in a freak accident where his famous trusty Toyota Landcruiser pinned him to a tree as he was trying to winch it out of a tough spot.   I had the personal honour of meeting, conversing with and actually doing some work with Douglas some years before he died. When I met him he was in his mid 60's, and had just beaten prostate cancer, as well as recently having survived his boat capsizing whilst he was sleeping in it in a king tide in far northwestern Australia.   He was a true icon, and meeting and conversing/working with him was a true privilege. I was so moved by his death, that I put together a tribute video in honour of his memory.   Americans loved Steve Irwin. But real Australians remember Malcolm Douglas with a deeper kind of fondness and respect."

You can hear, 'Doctors get rich off treating people's cancer, so they want people to keep getting cancer,' and see how that could make some sense.  But doctors purposely give children autism, because doctors just hate children that much. There's nothing in it for them, but they just like the sweet, warm feeling they get from knowing they gave a kid autism."

They were very plain cars with limited heat and they only just barely covered the metal parts on the inside with vinyl over press-board panels.

vintageads,2m3llz,gezelligpompoen,2,Wed Nov 12 23:27:12 2014 UTC,"I haven't worn those skirts before, but I think with many fashions you just deal with it and enjoy when you can finally take them off at the end of the day."
vintageads,2m3llz,honilee,2,Thu Nov 13 01:43:45 2014 UTC,I wear mainly high waisted skirts and they are nice if you size up rather than down. Gives you a defined waist without any uncomfortableness. Hers looks really tight.
vintageads,2m3llz,tinyghost,1 point,Thu Nov 13 08:02:16 2014 UTC,"Would an elastic/stretch waist help? I find that even when I size up in those skirts, I still have pain, but I've never tried a stretchy waistband. I find that my waist fluctuates during the day and that causes problems with a fixed waistband."
vintageads,2m3llz,gezelligpompoen,1 point,Thu Nov 13 13:02:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it would probably help. I don't love them because they tend to move up when you move around and I think the elastic part feels uncomfortable but if you flunctuate a lot they'd probably be better. A skirt where part of the waistband is elastic would probably be good as well."

Also, ""closer to stereo,"" not actually stereo. Smooth one, RCA. Although according to the ad copy the sets DID have two amplifiers and two speakers, so I suppose the ""more like stereo"" part was because MTS (the standard that allowed stereo television broadcasts) wouldn't be introduced until 1984....and according to Wikipedia one of the first sets to support real stereo was from RCA's high end Dimensia line--also in 1984--just two years before their bankruptcy.  *There were other proposals for color television at the time, but RCA's design won out."

vintageads,25h664,bathmlaster,0,Thu May 15 04:09:23 2014 UTC,After reading that article... I'm confused.  Is the ad from 1961 or is it a modern ad designed to look retro and ironic?  The machine looks more square and angular than the vintage Kenwoods.
vintageads,25h664,bathmlaster,1 point,Thu May 15 12:19:23 2014 UTC,"I don't know much about the Kenwood design but the overall ad, especially the image in the lower right, had me suspicious that the image was made recently in an attempt to recreate the retro look.  The tagline of the ad, use of hyphen and exclamation mark have me even more suspicious."
vintageads,25h664,Edna69,2,Thu May 15 14:05:49 2014 UTC,"No, it's pretty surely vintage. Here is a British version of the same ad(note the address card), which is also claimed to be from 61. IMO, there are too many versions of the ad out there with too many variations that only matter at the time such as layout, country of distribution, etc. for it to be a modern image.  Here is a modern picture of a Kenwood Chef on an old Australian ebay ad. The seller claims it to be ""early 60s"". Looks to be pretty much the same machine."

vintageads,255fj1,texanwill,10,Fri May 9 19:03:49 2014 UTC,"Content aside, I like the look of the ad itself.  Just looked up Lucky Strike on wiki, they were using ""It's Toasted"" as a selling point as far back as 1917. That ad isn't as striking.  I remember this from Mad Men, I didn't realize it was an actual ad.  Here's the transcript from the show:  Don Draper: This is the greatest advertising opportunity since the invention of cereal. We have six identical companies making six identical products. We can say anything we want. How do you make your cigarettes?  Lee Garner, Jr.: I don't know.  Lee Garner, Sr.: Shame on you. We breed insect repellant tobacco seeds, plant them in the North Carolina sunshine, grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...  Don Draper: There you go. There you go.  [Writes on chalkboard and underlines: ""IT'S TOASTED.""]  Lee Garner, Jr.: But everybody's else's tobacco is toasted.  Don Draper: No. Everybody else's tobacco is poisonous. Lucky Strikes'... is toasted.  Roger: Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you what you just witnessed here.  Lee Garner, Jr.: I think you do.  Don Draper: Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And do you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of a road that screams with reassurance that whatever you're doing is OK. You are OK.  Lee Garner, Sr.: It's toasted.  [Smiles]  Lee Garner, Sr.: I get it."
vintageads,255fj1,sarais,5,Fri May 9 21:19:11 2014 UTC,"Aw man--I've been thinking of watching Mad Men--I hear it's really good. But it's just that kind of historical inaccuracy that drives me crazy. Especially in the advertising world, which my posting history right on this sub should show my enthusiasm for.  ""It's Toasted"" goes back WAAAY further than Don Draper's days. This ad, which already has the ""It's Toasted"" slogan, is from the 1930s--you can tell it's a pre-WWII advertisement because the Lucky Strike pack is green--the pack changed to its current white in a famous ""Lucky Strike Goes to War!"" campaign.  On every pack of Lucky Strikes two things have been unfailingly printed for nearly 100 years--""It's Toasted!"" and ""L.S./M.F.T."" which the company said stood for ""Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco"". No truth to the vicious rumor the kids spread of it really being, ""Let's stop. My finger's tired"".   :P"

I just discovered this interesting fact within the last six months.  ""The more you know!""  Richard Deacon also portrayed the role of ""Lumpy"" Rutherford's father (Fred Rutherford) in the classic 1950's/60's TV show: 'Leave it To Beaver'   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Deacon_(actor) _________________________________________________________________________ Personal life of Richard Deacon: A lifelong bachelor, Richard Deacon was a gourmet chef.  In the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote a series of cookbooks and hosted a Canadian television series on microwave cooking.  He would stand behind a desk and say to customers, ""I'm standing behind here because in a moment of spontaneity, I sold my pants.""  Hollywood historian William J. Mann has called Deacon a ""gay pioneer"" in the field of American television.   *EDIT: (Spelling corrections.)"
