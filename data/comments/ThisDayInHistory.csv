ThisDayInHistory,3dqodh,fitchity,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"I saw a copy of this in an antique store last year and wanted to buy it.  I'm curious about it.  My grandmother's family was destroyed in concentration camps and I've spent a large portion of my adult life studying everything I can find.  I did not, however, buy Mein Kampf.  I was too worried about what the stranger behind the counter might think of me."
ThisDayInHistory,3dqodh,DIGGYRULES,2,Sat Jul 18 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"I am very sorry that your family suffered so, and I understand your misgivings. Ultimately, however, I think it is important to make efforts to read & understand how this arrangement of words, in this context, were part of a catalyst that changed history.  Understanding propaganda, and how it has been used, helps us to recognize and resist it today and here.  Go ahead and read it, and then watch for parallels from world leaders and those who wish to be so."

Made me feel angry at the perpetrators, strongly that we will not bow to these types of awful tactics, and sad that so little seems to have been learned or changed re terrorism in the past 10 years."
