The fact two seasons have them suggests they are all probably out there somewhere. I used the search function on the website you'll notice hosts both those links, but came up with nothing. I also found a custom made one (http://www.covertr.com/showthread.php?t=22700) that has Seasons 1-6, so if you look into that, the author may have made ones for the two latest seasons!"

bigbangtheory,3dh5s2,AngryMama5,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Usually they're ""wristband""  events.  Show up earlier in the day, buy the book and they give you a wristband.  Shows you bought the book and you're there for thr signing.  Seating is still on you so show up early, grab a good spot and the author does a bit of talking or reading, maybe some q&a then a somewhat orderly line forms, starting with the wristband bunch, and you file through to get you book signed, picture if they're down for that sort of thing.

He said there were some scenes done on a parking lot, so they were filmed earlier, but they showed them on a screen so they could record the audience laugh and reaction. He also said there was  a scene where Howard was laying in the bed naked, or something like that. They started the scene with a screen in front of the set so the audience couldn't see Howard, and then removed the screen at the appropriate time so could hear the the laughs/shocked reactions."

bigbangtheory,3dg7z4,GUSHandGO,3,Thu Jul 16 04:47:37 2015 UTC,"I have been to two live tapings... one in season four, another in season five.  I'd say about 75% of the episode is taped that night. Anything in a vehicle or on the Warner Bros. backlot is filmed before and then shown in sequence on the monitors to the studio audience.  Some scenes are one take and done. Most are 3-5. Complicated shots can take more, and many jokes are rewritten on the fly or different lines are filmed in the same scene to see which gets the best reaction. The crowd MC makes it clear that no matter how many times we saw a scene, we needed to pretend we were seeing it fresh each time."
bigbangtheory,3dg7z4,GUSHandGO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:48 2015 UTC,Very interesting. What sorts of scenes are filmed on the backlot?

Maybe they should follow up on that and maybe he could start drawing for comics and the guys could invest in him in some way."
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,Clestonlee,13,Sat Jul 11 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"This sounds awful, but I'd love to see Amy leaving him just break Sheldon.  Like gives his personality a hard reset to season 1, but only for an episode or two.  Then he'll have the opportunity to grow up emotionally and understand other people's feelings so he'll be able to deserve getting Amy back.  If he gets her back without changing his behavior I'll be very disappoint"
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,ohchristworld,5,Sat Jul 11 22:03:02 2015 UTC,That sounds good. I like the idea that she doesn't tell him she needs to see him grow a little but have that be the expectation and have the gang nudge him in the right direction. Actually I can see them trying and him being too obnoxious and finally someone (Leonard) breaks down and tells him why they've been nudging him and it finally clicks for him and he gets it all together.
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,DaddyCatALSO,5,Sat Jul 11 22:38:43 2015 UTC,I agree on Raj. Stop infantilizing him.
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,nbca,2,Sun Jul 12 02:30:38 2015 UTC,Interesting how early on Raj was sort of the sane half of his dyad with Howard but that went away when Howie got into a steady 'ship. Kinda-sorta reflects reality there.
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,indigoreality,4,Tue Jul 14 19:27:20 2015 UTC,Hopefully a Leonard/Penny break up so Leonard can get with someone better for him.
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,jagknife96,7,Sat Jul 11 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"That relationship is a train wreck, but they will never end it for good.  The Ross and Rachel style 'will they or won't they?' is the main driver of the series.  I predict they'll be apart for 4-6 episodes, in which they will (hopefully) explain why they are in a relationship in the first place.  As it stands now, the only reason Penny wants Leonard is because he is relentless in his efforts and he is devoted to her entirely.  But, now that he cheated on her, one of those principals is not true.  So maybe Penny will realize she shouldn't be with him.  And Leonard only wants Penny because she is pretty.  The only thing they have in common is an apartment building and a love/hate of Sheldon"
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,DaddyCatALSO,4,Sat Jul 11 22:08:19 2015 UTC,I'm seriously getting sick of Leonard's dependency and neediness. I understand his upbringing is the cause of his insecurities. I hope they have some character development for him.
bigbangtheory,3cy8pv,Buttstache,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:58:19 2015 UTC,I'm also sick of his constant condescension towards EVERYONE. Rewatching from the start only further fuels how much I loathe him as a character.  I also can't stand Galecki too so there's part of the problem there.

Sheldon singing the Christmas song during the DnD Christmas episode   Penny horribly singing ""Let's gohoo ouuuuttt tonight"" while practicing for her appearance in a ""Rent"" production.   Leonard singing ""Sorry Alex hit on me"" to apologize to Penny.   Howard singing to win Bernadette back at the cheesecake factory.

Just because it's in the news doesn't mean the show needs to suddenly make an episode out of it as if they're trying to make a social statement. A non controversial show that's just funny helps keep things light. Next it'll be Sheldon's mom invites everyone to Texas and some of the guys aren't sure how to tell her that the confederate flag waving in the front yard offends them. So they secretly take it down in the middle of the night and pretend they didn't do it. Tbh I've only been swallowing the whole concept of people slowly getting married because I figure they HAVE to grow up eventually, otherwise the show writers will run out of things for them to do that are fresh.

bigbangtheory,39s23n,Thejklay,5,Sun Jun 14 10:54:53 2015 UTC,there are definitely parts of Sheldon's personality traits that would be a great role model for autistic kids (like the ones OP pointed out here).  But there are definitely parts that aren't - particularly his completely self-centered and selfish side.

bigbangtheory,39s23n,geared4war,3,Sun Jun 14 06:24:50 2015 UTC,"I have OCD, anxiety, and, yes, I fall on the autism scale. I am 40, I control trains for a living, and I am happily married with three kids, one who is autistic. Autism affects the way we interact with the world but it isn't everything. I plan everything but I have come to realize I cannot control everything. That is when the OCD triggers are the worst. Those little things I can control make it easier to distance myself when I cannot. We tend, like Sheldon, to close those parts out, for a while, tune to the OCD channel in out heads and let the reruns calm us. Like Sheldon, though, we need to sometimes talk it out. My wife is only slowly coming to realize that a recent one of my issues is in others comprehension of me. In rail work communication is key to safety. It has got into my head to repeat everything I think is important. My wife tunes the repeats out and misses the content. This sets me into the little loop of anxiety that can lock me up. So I am trying to get it through to her, and others, that this is a trigger and will continue to be a trigger. By talking it out I can sometimes, only sometimes but its worth it, reduce the anxiety level to a bearable point. A point where she and I work together. Yes, she is a fucking saint and I love her dearly."

However, Leonard is his intellectual punching bag (after Howard). He always belittles Leonard's work and doesn't see him as someone who should even be a scientist. Sheldon always mentions than Leonard should go into teaching, for example. If Leonard were to make a contribution in string theory, the field that Sheldon failed in, then that would dumbfound him. It'll open up character growth opportunities, and will have lots of funny arguing between the two.  Howard has it worse than Leonard with regards to disrespect, but on the other hand howard is an engineer and they mostly don't work in string theory physics. Also he has been to space and Sheldon still didn't respect him really. He will never gain Sheldon's respect no matter what he does."

They spend weeks sitting on the sofa, watching the DVD of Beaches, and eating Ben and Jerry's.  He is trapped, has gained 20 lbs and now knows the script of the movie backwards and forwards.

The hanja (Chinese character) for Kim is 金, meaning ""gold"". The Korean pronunciation varies: as a common noun meaning ""gold"", it is pronounced [kɯm] (금, geum) but, as a surname or in place names,  it is pronounced [kim] (김, gim). Kim is the most common last name in Korea.  In Japan, some Koreans use the kanji 金 either by itself or in combination with other characters. This is sometimes read as Kin and sometimes as Kane- (e.g. Kaneda, Kanemoto) in kun'yomi, but not every Japanese or Chinese person who bears such a name is of Korean descent. The modern Mandarin pronunciation for ""金"" is jīn([tɕin˥˥]) but the modern Cantonese is ""gam1""([kɐm˥˥]/[kɐm˥˧]), which may be seen as more similar to the Korean and Middle Chinese pronunciation (/kɰim/) in some aspects.

My go-to has always been when Penny asks Sheldon if he's ever kissed a woman. He lists his mother, his sister and a nun who he saved on the bus.  He leaves out Leonard's mother even though she had  kissed him in a previous episode and it was probably the mist romantically-intended of all the kisses her mentioned.  Another redditor theorized that he probably blocked it out. But more likely the writers just forgot. Too bad since it would have been some good fan service.

bigbangtheory,37hdew,macgyverrules,17,Wed May 27 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think the show can go on for another 2 seasons. I would try and end it in the ninth season (yes I know it's been renewed for a tenth season). I really liked the early seasons when it was a bunch of nerdy friends having weird adventures and obsessions, and their sexual-tension-inducing neighbor who plays the straight-man to their shenanigans. But now the show can't go back to its roots, the characters have grown and changed too much. It would be weird if they all just ditched their wives/girlfriends and went back to playing Klingon Boggle and pining over women way out of their league.        I'd prefer to conclude all the character arcs and give everyone a happy ending. I've found myself bonded with these fictional characters and, even though it isn't as good as it used to be, I want them all to end up happy. I really liked how The Office ended its run. That show went downhill after the fifth season, and got worse when Carrell left. But they saved it with a passable 9th season and a fantastic Finale that concluded the story arcs perfectly. Not all the characters got what they wanted, but they all got what they needed.   I would:    Give Howard closure about his father, and end the season with Bernie getting pregnant (but no pregnant Bernie episodes or where Howard is a bumbling dad to the kid, etc.) Settle Leonard and Penny's off-again, on-again thing once and for all. Either Leonard grows a pair and Penny loses her weird commitment neuroses and they have a normal, fair relationship, or they break up realising they were not really meant for each other, and remain friends but find more suitable partners. Raj and Stuart become best buds, and wingman each other and have great adventures.  Sheldon and Amy break-up for a while, forcing Sheldon to realize that he truly loves Amy, not just because of a relationship agreement or because she does his every bidding. He embraces his feelings for her and they embark on a full relationship with each other. Howard (or Leonard) makes a significant contribution to string theory, stunning Sheldon into finally respecting him. Even worse, Sheldon makes a significant contribution to engineering (or Geology)."
bigbangtheory,37hdew,the_foxy_cow,2,Wed May 27 17:56:28 2015 UTC,Raj and Stuart could become a spinnoff series
bigbangtheory,37hdew,HeIsntMe,13,Thu May 28 12:03:02 2015 UTC,That sounds awful.

bigbangtheory,37hdew,Channer81,7,Sat Jun 6 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the women, except Penny. Bernie and Amy ruined the show, Howard sucks now and Bernie basically killed off his character, Amy is the Michelle Tanner of the show and Sheldon always has to apologize to her about something during an episode.. I love Leslie Winkle and Priya because they kept the main characters on their toes and challenged Sheldon like no one else could, I wish they could bring them back.. If the show started with the characters in the relationships they are in now it would not have lasted..  And I want a flashback episode right before Penny moved in and Sheldon and Leonard had the cross dressing cop living across from them.. Imagine the possibilities.."

To some extent it's natural, at least until the costs outweigh the comfort zone.....exactly why the ending this season and last season have been pushing him to his social limits.   I think he's realizing refusing to grow up is holding him back and he's running out of excuses..."

bigbangtheory,37hdew,ThiefofNobility,5,Thu May 28 11:59:37 2015 UTC,"What happens to Raj I think is the most intersting character ending. Emily will probably get the boot at the start of the next season, given we know virtually nothing about her. Hopefully Raj can ditch the ""I'm so lonely"" act now that he's been in a long term relationship and can embrace being single. His parents meddling in his love life can fill a couple of episodes. Ultimately, at the very end I think he will find love with someone else. Leonard and Penny. They'll end up together, no question about that. I still think that we'll see a proper wedding after they inevitably bale on Vegas. Howard and Bernadette. Probably a baby or two. Hopefully we won't see Berndatte as pregnant. Or maybe they decide not to have kids! Sheldon and Amy. They will have sex. Probably the very last scene of the show. On Sheldon's spot. Before that though, Amy takes a break from Sheldon. Few episodes on Sheldon getting over the relationship and trying to win Amy back. Amy goes out with Wil Weaton, making Sheldon renew his hatred for him. Final season Sheldon eventually wins Amy back. Stuart. Dies? Really think this could happen. Funeral would take an episode or two.  Howard's Dad to make an appearance. Possibly Leonard's Dad as well. I think in the final season we will see Leonard and Penny looking for a new house and Sheldon dealing with that. Amy moves in to Sheldon's apartment. Raj moves in across the hall and third wheels all of Sheldon and Amy's date nights for eternity."

Your take on Raj is in no way Raj-like at all.  *SHELDON: ”I am the one who knocks!” “knock knock rajester” x3.  First he wouldn't say that's what he does, he would just give her a look and take over and he would only say Raj. He rarely even says Rajesh, he would never say Rajester. Sheldon would refer to Barry as Barry Kripke or simply Kripke. SHELDON: “Ugh, okay.”  would actually be ""Ugh. Fine"" Barry is much more witty Amy's parts were completely devoid of Amy's personality. Bernadette's parts were bland and generic There's no Howard in Howard at all. Howard's mom is dead SHELDON: “That’s genius! Why would I throw them out in my office!” Sheldon is more likely to say ""That's brilliant"" He typically reserves genius for himself. Sheldon wouldn't bother to look at her research as he considers her line of work inferior and not real science.  Sheldon's entire exchange with everyone in his investigation is out of character for all them, too explanatory and dry, without the witticisms(which come across forced) in the right places. The entire monkey thing wouldn't happen, and undercuts how professional they are in their jobs. Amy has had small issues with the monkeys that didn't serve as a plot device.

Relationships are difficult and I for one, would like to see the dynamics of couple getting through the 7 year itch unlike ALL other shows where people break up because, relationships are not easy."
bigbangtheory,36uxz4,Lampmonster1,2,Fri May 22 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. Their relationship has a very weak base. What these characters were 8 years ago and what they have become now, with the paths that they have taken these past couple of seasons, I don't see them ending up together as leading to anything good. It'd be different if their relationship had become stronger with time, if they had built on their foundation, but I guess that would have involved a huge change in character. Penny and Leonard, as friends, compliment each other and have helped the other person improve their life. But, as a couple, they are way off."
bigbangtheory,36uxz4,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Sat May 23 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"The Leonard/Penny situation is one of the main reasons why this show is no longer watchable. This season's finale was just awful... by that I mean it was not funny at all. Add to that the unbelievable (within the context of the show) relationship stuff for all of the couples, makes this show now just terrible.  Honestly, BBT hit its comedic peak when in season 4, the show was solely the guys without Penny because Kaley Cuoco had to be written out of several episodes because of a broken leg. Those episodes were quite funny, and Penny's unexplained and unnoticed disappearance did not take anything away from the show at all. To the contrary, they were much funnier than many episodes (before and after) when she played her normal role at the time."
bigbangtheory,36uxz4,Lampmonster1,0,Fri May 22 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"You are talking about events written into the show for comedic purpose like they actually happened to a real couple. Also talking about them in general like they are a real-world couple.  There is a reason TV shows and movies have outlandish scenarios, and situations. It's called suspension of disbelief.  Looking at the series as a whole a main point is the failure to complete a mini-plot line. Literally hundreds of possibly horrible outcomes never come to fruition, along with many possible good outcomes. That is part of what makes the show fresh, and comedic. Think back to the great comedies, and I'll use Seinfeld as a quick single example. What happened when Kennedy's golf clubs were destroyed? No closure, lawsuits, or anything about the financial and personal repercussions.  There are some longer plot lines in TBBT, but the main comedy comes from the small ones for each episode. This is why the show has done so well, and continues to be funny IMHO. They have always stated there is no long-term story or guiding force to the show.  In regards to you hypothesis, I disagree. The first episode focused on the idea of Leonard and Penny having coitus. That held as a background for the shenanigans for 4 years. It was a simple concept, not a decided plot line, or outline. Once they broached that subject many other concepts have come and gone. Each of these are merely the kindling for a funny situation to put the characters into. I think they have done well with it, and will continue.  Think of it a bit like a Kevin Smith movie. No way Dante gets hot chicks to fight over him in real life, but it makes good comedy. In that vein Leonard and Penny are and end to a means. They could have a hick wedding in Nebraska with hijinks where the main characters get lost in rural Nebraska. They could have all of Penny's family come to L.A. and experience that madness. They could have the wedding in Vegas, then introduce Leonard's brother (I thought one was a lawyer) try and force an annulment. I'm just spit-balling dumb ideas, as I'm not a writer, but I think you get the point.  It's all about creating funny scenarios the characters could be put in. TBBT isn't a drama, and there is no reason to ever think of the characters are part of the real world. If you really want to gripe about a fantasy relationship that would NEVER happen then talk about Howard and Bernadette."
bigbangtheory,36uxz4,Dirty_Bird_RDS,2,Fri May 22 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"Suspension of disbelief:       Suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief is a term coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a ""human interest and a semblance of truth"" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance or lack of knowledge to promote suspension of disbelief.

bigbangtheory,36ixo6,drproximo,5,Tue May 19 23:48:30 2015 UTC,They will probably end up drawing up an Engagement Agreement
bigbangtheory,36ixo6,conallkeenan,14,Wed May 20 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think Amy is going to leave Sheldon. This will lead to a season of random dates. Maybe a new group member, Sheldon will be an asshole to him. Finally, after a season of Sheldon pining away and Amy trying to move on, 1 of 2 things. 1. They get into a fight and have a passionate kiss. 2. They get into a fight and end up in bed, which will probably be the cliff hanger scene for the season.  As for Raj, I think they're going to have the girlfriend go much crazier before it gets better. Maybe even a wedding that is either called off at the alter or goes through with a quickie in Vegas. This will culminate in either her dying in some random, but funny way (maybe a rubber chicken falls out of a plane and hits her in the head,) or Raj having to grow a sack and leave her. Another option is for her to go full crazy and be arrested. This would leave her open for coming back for revenge at random times. He'll probably end up back at Howard's house because of this. ""Temporarily"" of course.  Bernie/Howard baby train. They might not pull the trigger and get her pregnant this season, but it will be a topic. I doubt BBT will go down the pregnant and then miscarriage route, that's a pretty heavy topic for a show that tends to not have ""very special episodes."" Probably an episode or 2 of hilarity at Howard being too tired for sex, while Bernie is a rabbit. Maybe they decide to wait a little longer after a bunch of trying. Howard's dad will appear, maybe he ends up moving in, and he becomes the new ""Howard's mom"" gag, always yelling, etc.   Leonard/Penny. Here's where I think they have to tread lightly. I think a lot of people are really sick of the on/off again. I know I am. They basically said they're heading to Vegas to get married. They're going to get there and decide she wants family there, or that the kiss was too big a deal. That means that they'll either pull the trigger and REALLY get married with family/friends later in the season, or they have to be done for good. I think that if they do opt to stay together but not get married in Vegas, they're going to lie about it and let everyone think they're married. The secret might come out a few episodes in.   Stuart. I think he's the wild card. Either he'll stay the same moochy character, OR the store is going to take off, he's going to be hoarding cash. Eventually Howard kicks him out, and it's revealed he's loaded. Maybe he'll get a girlfriend this season, he's now the only odd man and the ""geeks"" are now the ""cool"" guys.   Star Trek. At least 2 Wil Wheaton appearances. Maybe he takes Sheldon out and gets him drunk after Amy leaves. A ""big"" name would be good for sweeps, Shat or Stewart maybe.   I'm worried for the new season. I'm afraid they've painted themselves into a corner with all the pairing off and marriages. Amy/Sheldon splitting will only go so far before it's old. After everyone is married, where are they going to go? It's not like this is a Soap where everyone is divorcing every other week. Maybe they'll open a compound and all live together? Are they going to kill someone? That would be a little too dark, until Howard's mother's death, they really didn't go down the serious road, and the only reason that was done was because the actress passed. I love this show, and I will watch it until its last breath, no matter what. I'm hoping that the writers have a game plan to avoid the pitfalls of a long running sitcom."

bigbangtheory,36ixo6,loveinvein,3,Mon Jun 1 13:28:41 2015 UTC,"also, we have a married couple, and another couple which may or may not have eloped. if the subject of children is dealt with in the next season after 8 freaking years of these peoples' lives, can at least some of us agree that a baby-centric plot isn't automatically a case of jumping the shark, and might be a realistic reflection of the progression of events in the lives of these people?  I do agree that if a baby happens, they need to give the podling as little screen time as possible for the show to work (there's loads of precedent for this). if the baby becomes the most important thing in their lives, it might be a shark-jump; but if the thing is born because it probably should be, and then fades into the background as an excuse why Howard couldn't tag along on a convention road trip, I'm totally cool with that, because for folks like me who pretty much hate children, that's what they are, background noise in other peoples' lives that I accept as the natural order of things, and therefore tolerate as long as I'm not asked to babysit."
bigbangtheory,36ixo6,myh2oisblue,3,Tue May 19 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"If a baby happens on the series, that'll probably be the final straw for me. The series is already far from it's origins and now is more like a standard sitcom. Adding a kid to the mix tends to be the element that changes the whole dynamic to center around it.   It's just how the show has been. One person gets into a relationship, and the next few episodes focus on that relationship. This causes the others to talk about relationships, which causes them to get into relationships, then episodes about the relationship drama. Then marriage talks, then kid talk.   While the idea of kids in a series after 8 years is a logical and realistic step, this is BBT we're talking about. It's not exactly rooted in realism. Howard went into Space, Sheldon is a cartoon of a genius five year old in a grown up body. Heck, Penny went from having five dollars in her pocket to making more money than Leonard in a week from getting a job because her boss is afraid of Bernie. A lot of the character growth and changes they introduce into the show has been for ratings and to shake things up rather than a natural progression."

bigbangtheory,36ixo6,Ayendora,1 point,Wed May 27 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"I've said it before but I'll say it again.  Sheldon and Penny story arc.  Sheldon will be upset about Amy leaving, Leonard and Penny will arrive back from Vegas unmarried, causing Sheldon to turn to Penny for help in winning Amy back. it will then progress onto why didn't P + L get married, where Penny will tell Sheldon about Leonards kiss. P + S will end up having a friendly drink and comforting each other. at some point in the season Sheldon will realise he has feelings for Penny and will try to broach the subject with Leonard, causing friction between the two friends. in the meantime Penny will be thinking over what she really wants and decides that it isn't Leonard after all. Leaving a possible cliffhanger for a P+S will they won't they.  Amy + Stewart story arc  I reckon with Sheldon now turned away, Amy will become friendly with Stewart again. we may perhaps see them go on a few dates, with Amy eventually offering him her couch when Bernie and Howard pluck up the courage to kick him out.  Raj and Emily story Arc  I reckon this could be the season pin point, it would be good to see Raj finally overcome his fear of telling women how he feels and will end with him attempting to end the relationship. Emily will be upset and maybe lock him in her apartment, trying to convince him to give things another go. inevitably Howard and Bernie will have to come to the rescue.  Howard and Bernie story Arc  After meeting the half-brother I guess the next logical step is Howards dad putting in an appearance. maybe not knowing that Howards mom has passed away. it would make for an interesting arc as he could show up wondering why she suddenly wants his name off the deeds for the house. Meaning that Howard has to break the news to him. I'm seriously hoping they don't go the baby route with these characters. I'm starting to really dislike Bernie and she seems to be replacing Howards Mom so I think Howard finally standing up to her and telling her to back off would work. Maybe see them going through a trial separation.  Leonard and Penny Story Arc  I don't think they will get married in Vegas (as I mentioned above). I think this will give Penny cause to doubt their relationship again. Being faced with the fact that Leonard has been unfaithful to her (Even just a kiss), she will start to wonder if he is right for her, especially as she is now independent from him in relation to money. she now has a well paid career which is in some way thanks to Leonards support. which brings us to my Penny/Sheldon arc above"

His confession to his slight infidelity is what caused Priya to say she slept with someone else while she was in India, which effectively ended the relationship.  Season 5 Ep 7 ""The Good Guy Fluctuation"".  So I fully believe both the kiss and the confession are completely in character because it has happened to him before."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,RedShirtDecoy,10,Sun May 17 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"I thought it was it out of character too, at first.  But then I realized that I'm not sure Leonard has the ability to turn an attractive girl down that wants him.  Alice from the comic book store, and Stephanie are good examples."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,bakershalfdozen,3,Sun May 17 22:21:04 2015 UTC,He turned down Sheldon's assistant.
bigbangtheory,369cg6,macgyverrules,-4,Fri May 22 09:34:07 2015 UTC,Stephanie wasn't attractive....
bigbangtheory,369cg6,CisternaChyli,4,Tue May 19 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"N ot by Hollywood terms, but seriously."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,DaddyCatALSO,5,Fri May 22 14:24:48 2015 UTC,He felt so guilty about it he confessed right away.
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Thejklay,-3,Sun May 17 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"He and Priya were in a failing, long-distance relationship. The moment he decided he wanted Alice was the moment their relationship was over. In fact, it was over even before that when Priya cheated on him with her ex-boyfriend."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,RedShirtDecoy,8,Sun May 17 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"But that's not the context of the conversation is it?  OP said it was out of character for him and this proves it was not.    He and Priya were dating, long distance or not, and he made out with someone else then confessed...  He and Penny were dating (I remember he took a selfie of himself and penny to prove to everyone on the ship he had a hot girlfriend) , long distance for at least 3 months, he made out with a girl and confessed.    So the scene in question was completely in character with what he did before.  He is an honorable person and to him long distance doesn't matter, he was still in a relationship."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,RedShirtDecoy,-1,Sun May 17 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"The difference between both cases, is that there was a set time on how long he and Penny would be apart. Also, where one relationship started failing, the second one was getting stronger up until the trip."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,macgyverrules,4,Sun May 17 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"That doesn't matter.    The entire series Leonard has been a standup guy... or in nerd terms Lawful Good or Neutral Good.  He always seems to want to do the right thing and regardless of what stage the relationships were at he was still in a relationship, something he has proven throughout the series that he takes very seriously.    The fact he has done this twice is just proof that is in line with his character because it has been established before in a previous episode.    You are looking WAY too much into the smaller details instead of looking at his personality as a whole.  Especially when this show is known to lack continuity regarding those smaller details.    Bottom line... in season 5 he made out with someone else while in a relationship, felt guilty, and confessed.  The last episode we found out he made out with someone else, felt guilty, and confessed.    So it is completely in line with is character and I personally don't see it any other way."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,RedShirtDecoy,2,Sun May 17 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"Why did he confess almost immediately the first time, and wait many months before confessing for the second time?"
bigbangtheory,369cg6,ProfoundlyProfound,1 point,Fri May 22 09:37:18 2015 UTC,"Most likely answer is because it was going to be used like it was, to cause tension and a slight cliff hangar at the end of the season.    If you think about it each confession seems to be planned to cause another event.  The confession in the earlier season ended the relationship with Priya and opened it up for him and Penny to get back together and this one was used as a cliff hangar.    My guess is the writers kept it in their back pocket for just this reason.    Also, its important to remember this is a sitcom that only half cares about continuity and not every detail can be taken as literal.    So between the continuity of the show and the events the confessions started I 100% believe this was completely in character for Leonard."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,WilliamMcCarty,1 point,Fri May 22 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"You sure are rationalizing, parsing the details on morally shaky territory. Extenuating circumstances are important to better understand and empathize with a person's mindset, not to change the facts.   When I'm struggling to convince people of anything, or over-advocating a point so personally, I have to stop myself and see where I'm projecting. What's part of this character resonates with you?  the way I see it, Leonard's got low self worth and is easy manipulated, and that's a huge flaw that makes him less trustworthy. I think he kept it secret because he's more ashamed of what it reveals about him (that he's an unmanly sucker for anyone's attention and is deeply needy) rather than guilt of having overstepped relationship bounds (kissing). It wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't such a spotlight on his fatal flaw.   Guilt and regret are healthy in making good choices, but shame is a lot deeper and will keep coming up to sabotage happiness. That's why the mother episodes were so important (and kinda dark in my opinion, the whole idea of that hug was tragic)   Leonard's a lot more fucked up than Shelly in many ways :("
bigbangtheory,369cg6,ProfoundlyProfound,1 point,Tue May 19 05:40:32 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not projecting anything. I'm analyzing specific details, because it's usually one of two details that serves as a root cause. Perhaps I am over analyzing, but that's just in my nature. If there is any relation between me and Leonard it's that I too am a nerd in a science based profession that loves his girlfriend a helluva lot. Frankly, I'm still doubtful. When you consider how proud he is of Penny, his actions still seem irrational to me despite the good arguments against my point."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,movieman994,2,Tue May 19 10:48:22 2015 UTC,"consider how proud he is of Penny   I'm so glad you said this, I'd not thought of that angle before.  It's hard to tell between the comedy bits if the characters are proud of the 'idea' of the person or the actual person. Leonard showing Penny off sometimes feels like he's proud he 'landed someone out of his league' /'the 'popular girl' trope, rather than who she's become since that.  It rubs me the wrong way sometimes, just because many women can relate to that feeling.   I think Penny's inner motivations are more complicated than Leonard's. I wonder if he really gets what makes her tick..."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,macgyverrules,8,Tue May 19 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"He made out with the chick he met at the comic book store while in a long distance relationship with Priya, he had a bed buddy relationship with Leslie Winkle, he banged Dr. Stephanie even after discovering he really wanted her gone cause she was too clingy. He relished in Sheldon's assistant having the hots for him and tried to hide it from Penny.  TLDR: It's not out of character for him."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,movieman994,2,Sun May 17 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"He relished in Sheldon's assistant having the hots for him   Did he, though?  I thought the point of that was that he was completely oblivious to her attraction."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Gmajj,3,Mon May 18 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"He even comments that he likes the idea of somebody having the hots for him, but can't have him because he's in a relationship with Penny."

bigbangtheory,369cg6,dakboy,5,Sun May 17 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, that sounds EXACTLY like Sheldon. He hasn't started watching The Flash because he knows if he starts he will have to see it through to the end, no matter what. I don't mean this in a disparaging way, in fact it's pretty much the same way I am. It's just ironic."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,WilliamMcCarty,0,Sun May 17 16:24:54 2015 UTC,"No, not exactly like sheldon at all. The Flash has only a single season so far. He was using his supposed commitment to a show as a metaphor for marriage."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Ayendora,3,Sun May 17 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"That was the implication. But you have to admit once Sheldon gets involved in any type of TV show or movie series he sees it through to the end. So if he started watching The Flash, he wouldn't quit."

bigbangtheory,369cg6,fire810,2,Sun May 17 16:16:48 2015 UTC,They weren't dating at the time. I can see him keeping it a secret: he was uncomfortable and didn't want to jeopardize his chances with Penny because of what a drunk girl did.
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Trishlovesdolphins,9,Sun May 17 16:22:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they were dating at the time.  Didn't he take a picture of himself and Penny before leaving for the ship just to prove to the people he was going to work with that he was dating a pretty girl?
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Mike737,3,Sun May 17 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Not only were they dating at the time, I think the airport dropoff  before the trip was the first time Penny told him that she loved him."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,DaddyCatALSO,3,Sun May 17 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the first time, she'd blurted it out in the hallway a few episodes earlier.  They both almost cried so they walked away from each other.  The airport was the first time we'd seen her say it willingly and meaningfully."

bigbangtheory,369cg6,drproximo,3,Sun May 17 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"They were dating at the time....  They got back together in Season 5, not 6"
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Ayendora,2,Sun May 17 16:52:45 2015 UTC,I really think they're rushing all this. If Sheldon or Leonard get married someone has to move out. That'll change the shows main focus which was their shared apartment between two of the main characters. And once everyone is married off you've still got another two plus years because the shows been renewed for at least two more seasons until the end of 2016. I think they're just running out of ideas. It's tough not to have the characters grow as ppl yet we know in reality these ppl are in their later 20s or early 30s (and in reality most are nearing 40 and won't look their characters age for much longer). So they gotta have them progress as ppl w/o going too far. Because once everyone is married the only season cliffhanger left is who's having a baby next season.
bigbangtheory,369cg6,macgyverrules,2,Sun May 17 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"not out of character, but completely out of left field and shameless coincidence to keep the will they/wont they conflict alive. I mean this is like the 20th time they've doubted each other and gone back and forth like this. bleh. Just get married already and stop with the bs."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,Ayendora,3,Mon May 18 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm over the will they or won't they. I'm perfectly content with a long engagement, but to pull this as a last minute way to avoid the wedding train, I think it's bad."
bigbangtheory,369cg6,chrismichaels3000,2,Mon May 18 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Why it bothers you is because it's a retcon, last time Leonard was in this situation he was fret with guilt and couldn't last more than a day before confessing. Are we suppose to believe he's had this secret for 4 years and never showed any signs of it?"
bigbangtheory,367pp8,JosephSarkis47,26,Sat May 16 23:44:12 2015 UTC,It was a talk about how seriously he took commitment...

bigbangtheory,367pp8,DocNoob,6,Wed May 20 23:24:21 2015 UTC,It could be interpreted loosely that way

Personally I think it would have been way funnier to see them start hooking up.  But I think the writers are playing the long game - this is the push Sheldon needs to meet Amy's physical needs.

bigbangtheory,35q7h6,GetSomeShowerHead,2,Wed May 13 01:30:31 2015 UTC,Really? I didn't think it was douchey at all. It was better for him to confess what happened instead of keeping it a secret.  And props to Penny. She didn't over react at all.

Instead he brought it up years/months later (I don't remember the exact time frame) and confessed to it, which did nothing but hurt Penny and their relationship. Now instead of being something he learned from and moved on, it's an issue between them and they'll have to deal with it, and it could always hang over their relationship. Now if it was a full on affair I would say he needs to make it known because that's only fair to Penny to let her decide if she wants to continue the relationship, but as Leonard said ""there was some kissing"" and that was it. So why do further damage to their relationship and hurt Penny over something that as far she knew never even happened, and probably made Leonard more aware for the future?"

bigbangtheory,35oare,unreqistered,2,Tue May 12 04:41:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that his work is purely theoretical, but I wouldn't go so far as to not call it science. ""Science"" in the way you talk about it (hypotheses proven or disproven by direct experimentation) refers more to the scientific method in particular, an association that only came about over the past few hundred years.   Before that, ""science"" just referred to both the enterprise, and the working body of knowledge that together attempt to understand and explain the universe and all its contents. So both you and Sheldon Cooper are scientists.   The reason something like string theory is so difficult to ""prove"" using the scientific method is because its particulars are incredibly difficult to empirically test at our (humanity) current level of intelligence and technological process. However, it is still grounded in physics, which is a very real ""science"" by any metric.   I believe using established theories and an existing factual knowledge base to formulate new hypotheses that try to explain the unknown is also science.   All that aside, I definitely agree with others on here that his jokes about geology not being a real science and everything else about other fields just serves to emphasise his arrogant nature. Just don't think what he's doing ISN'T science."

bigbangtheory,35oare,macgyverrules,5,Tue May 12 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sheldon's disdain for geology or engineering is a reflection of the writers' feelings on those fields. It's more a way to enforce that Sheldon is a condescending, arrogant ass. Everything other than his field is lesser, only his field is important because he's in it.   Your post reminded me of this blog post by a geologist mad about all the ''dirt eople'' slurs on the show."
bigbangtheory,35oare,rcrracer,-3,Tue May 12 05:41:52 2015 UTC,Your most likely right macgyverrules. I wasn't trying to insinuate that the writers dislike those scientific fields. More that its comical that Sheldon thinks he is the ultimate scientist when in fact he is not even a scientist. I just don't understand why the writers keep reusing the same dirt scientist jokes over and over when they have that sitting in front of them. I guess they don't know enough about string theory.

That's not fair. It's not like she expected him to change overnight. She has patiently accommodated all his unreasonable quirks in this one-sided relationship for five years. In return he has barely done anything for her.   It's true that Amy went into this relationship with both eyes open, she knew what she was getting into. But, just like many people, she thought she could change Sheldon slowly, gently turn him into boyfriend-material. This isn't entirely fair of her, but it's normal amongst most people who get into relationships. And she hasn't demanded he change overnight. She has been very, very accommodating, very understanding.  I think the whole Flash thing was just the straw that broke the camel's back, They are celebrating their 5-year anniversary, and Sheldon is only kissing her due to contractual obligation.And he is still thinking about something else, not at all about her. 5 years of grovelling to Sheldon, and he still treats her like some object that's only meant to serve him (despite what he has said in the past). Anyone, no matter how understanding, would be pissed.  I think the writers have been very unfair to Amy with regards to this relationship. I think they need to break the Shamy up for a while, and let Amy get genuine love and affection from another suitor. Raj would be perfect for this. He would give her all the romantic attention that she clearly craves, and this would create conflict with Sheldon and open up new story possibilities. Basically The Zazzy Substitution but over a season, and without a bullshit conclusion.  There's no way of course that they'll stay broken up, this is a sitcom after all. Sheldon will learn the error of his ways and make it up to Amy."

Amy got into the relationship with him because of the way he was, and potentially she hoped he would change. There's nothing wrong with breaking off the relationship, but it seems like its an unfair requirement that Sheldon has to change to suit how Amy wants him to be, and quickly enough for her at that. I mean, if I wanted to teach social convention to a child with Aspergers, I'd be pretty pleased with any change in him, rather than be upset that he isn't improving fast enough."

bigbangtheory,35eu6k,newbubble2015,2,Sun May 10 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as OP pointed out, Sheldon was not leading her on to expect these things to happen anytime soon. Amy was asking more than Sheldon had said he would bring to the table from the get go, and that isn't fair to Sheldon."

Amy is not able to change Aspergers, yet several people regularly expected just that to happen.

It's a pretty big moment, you don't spend 5 years with someone you don't really care for. Amy has been dealing with 5 years of Sheldon's nonsense very patiently. And yet he kisses her only because it's ''social convention'' to make out during an anniversary, not because he really wants to. And he's still thinking about something else. Worse, he thinks he's including her by getting her opinion, when in fact he is once again using her to satisfy his own needs. Amy is monumentally frustrated.

Reality aside, sure, you're right. But just a shred of logical thinking and you'd see that (if anything) Amy's been mentally tormented for several years. It's like Leonard craving love from his mom; but never receiving it.   Like a baby crying for attention; but being left alone in the crib.  You've sunk so far down into the TBBT universe, that you've forgotten what reality is."

Its suddenly now that she has had enough when Sheldon has done far worse things to her in the past. When Amy was first introduced, she was an exact copy of Sheldon. The writers wanted her to be her own unique character, but in doing that they shoehorned her into an 'abused lover' joke for years.  It was funny at first, but damn did it get creepy and morbid later on."

Felt really, really bad for him though."

bigbangtheory,3591b8,Franco_DeMayo,12,Fri May 8 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. She said she wanted to take some time and reevaluate their relationship because he's moving too slow and she feels like she's not getting anywhere with her. He apparently decided it was the appropriate time to get engaged, likely because of Penny and Leonard's timline, and bought a ring I guess."

bigbangtheory,3591b8,newbubble2015,6,Sat May 9 17:17:45 2015 UTC,Normally with Sheldon you wouldn't expect any sort of obvious emotional response and some cheap joke. Instead you get to see Sheldon actually regret something he's done or in this case really hasn't done. Also the actors where just great at making every second count.
bigbangtheory,3591b8,tmow329,1 point,Fri May 8 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"I get that about Sheldon's character (it's been a while, but not that long), but I'm curious about the ring.

Sorry to be so dead cat; I can't help myself."
bigbangtheory,3591b8,Franco_DeMayo,5,Fri May 8 16:09:55 2015 UTC,The ring is really out of nowhere. Seems like. She just broke up with him and proposing would just make it worse?

bigbangtheory,3591b8,Franco_DeMayo,5,Fri May 8 18:15:36 2015 UTC,Sheldon mentioned that they went to a website that repurposed diamond drill bits into rings. Maybe that's the case?
bigbangtheory,3591b8,spazzycakes,4,Sat May 9 10:04:14 2015 UTC,"Season 8 itself has been full of miles stones of they're relationship. First you had Sheldon being proud of the relationship, then telling Amy he loves her, Amy baking Sheldon cookies with his grand mothers recipe and the two planning a future together.  The ring is out of nowhere. Most likely is, two of his friends are getting married. And for the third thing this isn't the first time Amy has stood up for herself. The relationship only really progressed when she threatened to end. Which is dynamic of the characters they're not sure why they're together but they're terrified of the alternative.   I think Sheldon thought he was going to fix everything by proposing. But after the break up scene he had a sudden moment of self awareness that the problem might not be something can be fixed. Instead that it may have been broken from the foundation and just going to the next level or attempting to would make it worse."
bigbangtheory,3591b8,tmow329,27,Fri May 8 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"I like how there's a question mark after spoiler, like it's somehow possible that the ending cliffhanger scene from a season finale wouldn't be considered a spoiler."

bigbangtheory,3591b8,Trishlovesdolphins,8,Wed May 13 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"Here's the only thing that bothered me about that scene. Sheldon has proven time and again, that when he wants to say something, he just does it. I would have thought it was far more in his character to say something like, ""But Amy, I was just going to propose, but you can't wait? Patience is a virtue.""   They better not break up Shamy. I'll be so pissed. Though, I do think this will be a good power shift in their relationship. Sheldon holds the power, and by showing she's not willing to tolerate it forever, she's played a very important ""card."""
bigbangtheory,3591b8,Nikoli_Delphinki,20,Fri May 8 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think Sheldon is a little more complicated than people think. A lot of what he shares he'd consider unimportant nor truly personal. The things that really matter to him he doesn't talk about or really outright say until he is pushed. We've seen it a number of times (him breaking up Amy and Stewart's date, Valentine's Day on the Train, the spiderman quote, her as the emergency contact, and him asking about The Flash).   The last example to me is a subtle one. Sheldon makes his own decisions and often merely asks others as a formality. However, he normally asks Leonard first in the process, but instead he asked Amy, which is a unusual. Hearing the exchange between Leonard and Sheldon about The Flash shows that Leonard ""gets"" Sheldon on the TV series issue. Some of the most trivial things to us or the other characters are a big deal to Sheldon (ex: Penny not caring about YouTube voting from star system to thumbs up down system).   Basically, Sheldon is much more subtle in how he shows he cares. He actively lets them influence his life or help him make decisions. It all might sound trivial to us, but thats kind of Sheldon's thing trivial things that are actually really important."

bigbangtheory,359lr1,Darkprime,10,Fri May 8 06:47:02 2015 UTC,Leonard and Penny get married after wasting a episode arguing in a Vegas backdrop. Hopefully some elements of the relationship are ironed out or something.  Coming home they're shocked about the break up. They're shock how Sheldon emotional repressed Sheldon is about the whole thing. Maybe some scene with Leonard discussing it with Sheldon parring with Penny discussing it with Amy. However in the end nothing changes.   Raj goes through the motions of his unhealthy relationship with Emily. And Stewart's relationship with the Holowitdz meets a grizzly end after it's played out for laughs.  After a few episodes it's revealed Amy is dating again. She dates Kripke who at the cafeteria brags to Sheldon about the night he had with Amy. Sheldon's emotional repression ends with him attempting to punch Kripke in the face. Leading to an anemic nerd fight.  Then there is a university disciplinary hearing ala The Menagerie in Star Trek. Like Jeremy Clarkson Sheldon is fired from the univerisity amongst for violence in workplace with years of political incorrectness in the background adding up. On the way out of the hearing he finds a crying Kripke in the toilet. Kripke confesses that Amy won't sleep with him and that he made it all up.   Sheldon tries to comfort Kripke saying he is a worthy foe and by shaking his hand. When Sheldon comes home he gets an angry skype from Amy about assaulting Kripke. She also finds out that Sheldon himself used to pretend that he slept with her. She tells Sheldon never to talk to her again.  Sheldon now unemployed struggled to find work in anything academic. However he refuses to leave Pasadena. Penny moves in with Leonard to help him pay the rent and they become mother and father figures to Sheldon even more so.  Penny arranges Sheldon with work at the cheese cake factory so he can maintain his expensive lifestyle while she pays for the rent.   EDIT running themes after will be a intense rivalry between Sheldon and Kripke. All the guys growing up into slightly more adult men.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,5,Fri May 8 09:31:23 2015 UTC,is there any way to save this for when the new season starts? I guarantee that at least half of that is going to happen.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,fire810,1 point,Fri May 8 15:39:58 2015 UTC,RES has a save comment feature
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,3,Fri May 8 20:15:15 2015 UTC,I like it!
bigbangtheory,359lr1,ApoDeftera,3,Fri May 8 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"while this is a good storyline, this is WAY too dark for TBBT.  Dealing with themes of depression, physical outbursts, and Amy dating Sheldon's rival are all, I almost want to say too mature for the writers.  While the show has tackled major themes like death in this past season, I do not believe the writers (or more accurately the audience) will be able to maintain this sort of change for a whole season."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,the_foxy_cow,1 point,Thu May 14 19:11:17 2015 UTC,His expensive lifestyle?
bigbangtheory,359lr1,coolkid1717,3,Fri May 8 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"The t-shirts (look them up), premium computers, electronics, AT&T data rates for skype, special edition blu-rays, console games, train trips, replicas, props, paint balling, board games, the massive two bedroom apartment in a central location and finally though it's called mystic lords of kahah he really is playing magic the gathering. And if anybody is to be believe on this site I'm sure that's like paying for cocaine.   I don't know about all you guys but they're lifestyle on the show would be way too expensive for me."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,1 point,Sat May 9 10:24:23 2015 UTC,"He does have extra money because he doesn't have car payments, have to pay for gas, car insurance, car maintenance. On top of not having to pay for anybody else but himself.  The average physicist makes up to $8,000 per month, and we're to believe that he's at least a little above average."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,coolkid1717,2,Sat May 9 16:46:15 2015 UTC,I doubt he makes that much because there is an episode where he mentions he can't afford the rent on his own
bigbangtheory,359lr1,DCanon,1 point,Sun May 10 12:42:46 2015 UTC,I was really was just looking for a way for him to hit rock bottom. After years of mocking Penny's work as a waiter now all of sudden its all he can do. It'll also be something he can be pretty terrible at which would be funny.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,2,Mon May 11 10:36:38 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the episode where he went to a temp agency and they thought he was a crazy person. The episode where he ended up in a ball pit at the end. It really surprised me that he bypassed a security system to break into that place. Usually he is very adamant about not breaking laws.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,coolkid1717,1 point,Mon May 11 18:14:27 2015 UTC,Thanks now I realize it's been done. But I'd like to seem his suffer a little more
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,1 point,Mon May 11 19:43:17 2015 UTC,I would change one thing  instead of Sheldon working at the cheese factory he spends next season tutoring math students at the university.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,pcpoet,3,Thu May 14 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still holding out for Shenny...  I think the whole Sheldon and Amy breaking up and Leonard admitting he cheated (even if it was just a kiss)... will pave the way for a new dynamic of the group with Penny and Sheldon turning to each other for support and advice. Which would be the sort of thing to happen as we have seen Penny and Sheldon turning to each other a lot over the last few series. (Probably dreaming and it won't happen but I would like it too).  Howard and Bernadette, i know it sounds bad but i'm hoping they will split up... I have a feeling that the writers will work it in such a way that Howard will feel that Bernie is trying to wipe his mother from existence with the house and so on and he will finally stand up to her nad tell her that she is mean and bossy.  As for Raj, I really hope he manages to talk to Emily about how he feels, the last few episodes I have just thought it was awkward, as Raj is obviously creeped out by some of the things Emily is into, and I think he needs to stand up and tell her how he feels before it's too late.  As for Stuart, I hope that the Comic book store takes off and is really, succesful and he'll tell Howard that he is moving out before Howard tries to kick him out.   Also I think we may finally meet Howard's Dad. which could be where Howard will sum up the courage to call Bernie out in order to save their relationship rather than walking out like his father did."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,Ayendora,3,Sat May 9 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"I ship 'em too, but I prefer Peldon.  Leonard and Penny return from Vegas unmarried and angry. They decide to take some time off (again). Sheldon asks Penny to teach him to be a better boyfriend so he can win Amy back, and in those interactions, their long-building love blooms.  Leonard ends up out in the cold, relationship-wise. Stuart decides to continue the date with Amy that Sheldon interrupted and again, love blooms.  Honestly, don't really care about what happens with the Wolowitzes or Raj."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,Ayendora,2,Mon May 11 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"That would be a brilliant way for Penny and Sheldon to end up together, as it would almost be a complete accident."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,macgyverrules,3,Tue May 12 06:13:59 2015 UTC,"I had similar thoughts about Howard and Bernie too.  There would be tension in their relationship,maybe Bernie continues to make more and more money and becomes unbearably dominant. Howard chafes at being under her ''command'', just like he was with his mother. He contemplates walking away, just like his dad did. But then he meets his father. And maybe after getting some closure and hearing about his dad's relationship with his mom, Howard doesn't walk away and Bernie becomes more understanding.  It ends with Howard and Bernie having a child, with Howard as a stay-at-home dad who babies his kid just like his mother did to him."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,memeticmachine,3,Tue May 12 17:39:17 2015 UTC,Sheldon goes on a magical journey
bigbangtheory,359lr1,fire810,2,Fri May 8 06:58:02 2015 UTC,yeah but didn't he go on a magical journey at the end of last season? I still don't know what he got from all of that
bigbangtheory,359lr1,antizeus,3,Fri May 8 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"Leonard and Penny don't get married in Vegas.  They agree to have a real wedding, and to put off setting a date until they're good and ready.  Sheldon and Amy spend some time apart, have at least one alternative suitor each, miss each other, and get back together without signing a relationship agreement.  Raj grows a spine, and breaks up with Emily.  He subsequently buys a house in the same neighborhood as Howard and Bernadette, and invites Stewart (sp?) to move in.  Leonard reconciles with his mother.  The last episode skips forward a few months, and opens with people getting ready for a wedding, and moving out of the apartment building.  We get some scenes which show how the various relationships have evolved over the past months.  Eventually it is revealed that the wedding is not for Leonard and Penny, but for Sheldon and Amy -- Leonard and Penny still haven't set a date, but they will be co-habitating in a different place.  The final scene ends with Leonard and Sheldon turning off the lights in a now-vacant apartment."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,Crazylondog,3,Sat May 9 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'll probably be the unpopular opinion, but I really don't like the direction the show has gone. In my humble opinion, it's become a relationship show, with dashes of what it used to be. It's becoming what Friends become later in the seasons. I still love the characters, the humor, but it's now a question of whether this person and that person will stay together, rather than what the original premise of the show was. I understand that just like in life, characters must and always do change and grow, but this is ridiculous. It's entirely too serious too often. Not a single ""Bazinga"" that I can remember from that entire season. Like I said, I love this show and it's actors, but I'm starting to miss my nerdy friends."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,macgyverrules,2,Sun May 10 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"Thing is, they can't really revert the show back to it's season 1-3 roots. That would involve Howard and Bernie divorcing, Leonard and Penny breaking up, Amy and Sheldon breaking up, Bernie and Amy either moving away from the group or disappearing into the background, etc. It would also involve the boys regressing a bit, losing some of their maturity.   I suppose they could focus more on the gang's nerdiness, but I think at this point the writers will focus on making the guy more mature, which to the writers means relationships."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,foughtfirewithfire,3,Tue May 12 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that Howard and Bernadette have a baby. I don't know if thats in the cards, but I really would like it to happen. Maybe then Stuart would stay as a nanny sort of?"
bigbangtheory,359lr1,macgyverrules,2,Tue May 12 01:42:54 2015 UTC,I think that will almost certainly happen. I hope Howard ends up babying his kid just like how his mother used to baby him.

bigbangtheory,359lr1,amish__,2,Fri May 8 12:55:29 2015 UTC,so what ross and rachel did in vegas...  i would hope they can do better than copying that.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,0,Fri May 8 13:47:03 2015 UTC,Even better. They're in the hotel room getting ready for the ceremony a friends rerun of that episode plays and they just go holy crap and compare each other to the friend's couple.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,pcpoet,1 point,Fri May 8 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"what would be funny is if next season starts with penny ,Bernadette, Amy , Howard, Lenard and Sheldon waking up in las vegas. and finding that Amy is married  to Lenard  and Sheldon is married to penny. everyone in the room except Sheldon got to drunk to remember what happen that night in Vegas.  eventualy  everyone figures out that Sheldon knows what happen that night because Sheldon does not drink. the gang starts to question Sheldon about what happened only to find out that Bernadette and Howard got a divorce that night. at this point the first episode of the season ends. episode two opens  with everyone arguing but Sheldon who then starts to tell the story of what happened. The night before  at this point we flash back to 24 hours earlier we have Lenard in the car with penny arguing at some point the two of them decide they need to have Howard and Bernadette at the ceremony as witnesses. Howard  and Bernadette start to leave to go to Vegas but get phone call from Amy informing Bernadette that Sheldon proposed to her. over the course of the phone call it is decided that the four of them will drive to Vegas.  in Vegas when they go to the chapel a mistake is made when Sheldon and Amy decide to get married also. the cha[[el accidentally fills the paper work out so that legally penny is married to Sheldon and Amy is married to Lenard.  the four of them contact the chapel  witch also does Quickie  divorces. the chapel has them fill out divorce papers. Howard and Bernadette help fill out the paperwork because they were the official witnesses to the weding. the two of them mess up on the paper work and end up divorcing themselves."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,tmow329,2,Thu May 14 20:10:27 2015 UTC,I'd love to see an episode where everybody goes paint balling. It worked in peep show. The guys vs. the girls with Emily going all psychotic and Bernadette becoming a over competitive monster. Show the guys getting massacred one by one with predator references. Throw in some metal gear solid 3 references too.
bigbangtheory,359lr1,gcatlin,1 point,Fri May 8 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"The predator massacres sound like a great idea. I would love to see the entire ""Dillon death scene"" re-enacted, complete with a fallen paintball gun still firing, all in slow-motion! Throw in a few quotes, like ""I can make it!"" and ""Get to the choppa!"", to round things out."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,Aardquark,1 point,Sat May 9 14:55:01 2015 UTC,I feel like they wouldn't do another paintball episode though since they already did one (even if it was without the girls).
bigbangtheory,359lr1,itdothstink,2,Mon May 11 12:33:05 2015 UTC,"Even though business interests will probably limit the promotion of it, I feel like the release of the new Star Wars movie must be a big event in season 9."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,macgyverrules,2,Fri May 8 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"Penny and Leonard don't get married in Vegas, they get into a huge fight and come back to Pasadena. They may uneasily make up but there will be a ton of tension between them. The writers will drag this out. Finally there will be a super-emotional scene where they break up. Leonard will be pathetically sad, Penny will go back to banging random ex-boyfriends that she doesn't really care about. Finally at the end of the season, Leonard will grovel and go back to Penny, and they get back together.  Howard and Bernie will continue to be very mean-spirited. They will get pregnant at some point. Howard will get a visit from his dad.  I'm not sure how they will proceed with Amy and Sheldon. They will definitely be broken up for a while. But at some point Sheldon will make a big emotional plea to Amy to come back, and she will. They'll get engaged.   Raj continues to be a sad sack because it seems the writers' favourite hobby is shitting on him.   Stuart will be about as sad as Raj.  They will introduce a new character that makes semi-regular appearences, just like Amy and Bernie in season 4."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,Jeallie,2,Sat May 9 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"I just hope that Sheldon doesn't walk out again and travel, I know he doesn't like change but still it's about Amy, and he should do something about it."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,styxtraveler,2,Tue May 12 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that we find out that Leonard did more than just kiss the girl on the boat, gradually of course, which causes them to break up again. I'm not sure I care enough about what happens after that because I'm sick of them screwing with Penny and Leonard."
bigbangtheory,359lr1,pcpoet,2,Tue May 12 15:39:41 2015 UTC,I think that Howard and Bernadette are going to have baby next season.

That doesn't make him a bad person, it's just his unique and different. and If a girl tries to force shit on my face that I have no idea about and blames me for not knowing, then i'd have said BYEEE!!! on the first day, so he's actually been patient. and Even if she dumps him he'll have more chance on getting someone who'll actually accept him for who he is :)  Over and out,"
bigbangtheory,358l7r,kerelberel,1 point,Mon May 11 12:36:41 2015 UTC,"I agree but I think the Sheldon character is a bit more flat than all the others.

I'm sure season 9 will pick up with penny and Leonard backing out and going back for a wedding with friends, Amy leaving the show (possibly due to her family issues) or Sheldon telling her he wants to propose, Stuart finally getting kicked out, and raj breaking it off.  There has to be positive in some situations."

Ya'll are infantilizing Howard more than he infantilizes himself -- we have no indications that he's not happy with her, and his own indications that he wants to act more grown up and take on more responsibility post his mother's death. In fact, each episode he's showing more Agency, which is the opposite of what emotionally abused people feel, learned helplessness and inadequacy.   Wanting to sell your husbands toys or get him to pick up slack, and saying so with wry sarcasm isn't abuse, even teasing him or being mean with the real talk isn't --it's mean or teasing. Even if she loses her cool and has a screaming fit, that's someone having a meltdown, not abuse. (and advocating divorce instead of communication or confrontation about the issue sounds naive...)  Non-physical abuse is systematic, undermines the person's self-worth to an extreme, makes them doubt their own judgement of reality,  and isolates them from friends, family, and ability to reach out for help or see other options.

bigbangtheory,35504u,RodneyOhebsion,18,Thu May 7 03:51:11 2015 UTC,"A few pages in... prelim notes:  First off, it should be formatted like a multi-camera sitcom.   There is no cold open. All BBT eps have cold opens -- a short funny scene that opens the show before the credits. (When you find a sitcom script example, it'll be obvious.)  Funny jokes, but they should be a lot snappier. Sheldon and Leonard have a ton of dialogue up front that could be reduced. The jokes feel over stretched. (For instance when Sheldon keeps talking about Sex & the City.) Brevity is the soul of wit! At least three jokes on a page. (Which is going to be even harder once you see the spacing on a multi-cam script). Literally almost every line the characters say in the show is a joke, AND it moves the story forward.  Stage direction. Boil that shit down to the bare bones.      Example: ""Leonard walks into the room, and sees Sheldon sitting on the sofa, videotaping himself clipping his toenails onto the floor. He clips the final toenail and turns off the video camera."" -- It's not important that Sheldon turns off the camera. If we're watching the show, we see Sheldon clipping his toenails first, then Leonard will enter. Sheldon clipping his nails in front of the camera alone is funny. Give us a beat on that.      Try instead:  ""Sheldon sits in his spot, clipping his toenails. He's recording himself with a camera on a tripod.  Leonard enters from the back, stops in his tracks when he sees Sheldon.                                 SHELDON                 I bet you're wondering --                                  LEONARD                 No. Nope. No siree. I am not wondering anything.""   If you can get your hands on a BBT script study it closely. The characters need to sound more like the people we know.  source: I'm a screenwriter.  ps: I'll keep reading."
bigbangtheory,35504u,mathemon,5,Thu May 7 05:40:20 2015 UTC,"Is Sheldon actually on LSD? Because that's very out of character.   I'm not sure I'm finding the story here. There are a number of things happening, but I'm not sure what anyone's goal is. Sheldon's just tumbling into being an actor... which also seems out of character. There doesn't seem to be any real tension between him and Penny -- she's the actor! She should be pissed!  Every episode of BBT has multiple story lines. A, B, C in descending importance. It allows all the characters to get their moments. This script has a single story.   The story beats MUST escalate.  Page 19. Leonard slips into an outright monologue. There's not time for this and would never happen on the show.  There's a lot of meanness directed toward Penny. Sheldon's not very mean to her on the show anymore, so he shouldn't be here. And Leonard telling her she'd make a good prostitute is borderline misogyny. We would immediately dislike Leonard for this. We need to like them all. Plus Leonard is way to smart to say anything like this.  Leonard (and everyone else) knows Patrick Stewart wouldn't be in a new Star Trek movie (the Next Gen movies are finished).  Pop culture reference jokes are disguising the fact that the humor isn't coming enough from the characters personalities.   Overall, there's not enough story here. The stinger at the end with the band playing comes out of nowhere and therefore has no real impact.   Start with structuring the A, B, and/or C stories. Jump back and forth between them. Chop down the dialogue. Keep the jokes short and sweet. Give the characters some desire or goal. Escalate the problems between them and that goal.  But definitely get your hands on a sample script of the show and read it."

TBBT is a very popular show, so the large volume of viewers increases the number of negative people in ""the fandom"". and some of these negative people feel strongly that recent seasons haven't been as funny. so they keep watching and keep whinging, and no matter how many others love the direction that the show is going, these negative people still need to remind us all how awful it is. and really, the ""it's just not as funny as it used to be"" sentiment is inevitable with any sitcom that lasts more than a few seasons, you'll never be able to please everyone."

bigbangtheory,34yjsf,drproximo,7,Tue May 5 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, I never realised how popular it was.    it depends on which metric you use, but it's generally considered to be the most popular American sitcom currently on the air. in Canada the fourth season opener had more viewers than the Friends finale. I'm also pretty sure it's strong in the UK but I don't know to what degree.   Many people have said it has bad writing. But I've never been given an example. Would you be able to?   a lot of it has to do with what people seem to think is ""out of character"" behaviour. they remember what Sheldon was like in the first two seasons, for example, and then use that as a basis to say ""Sheldon would never do that"" about something that happens in season 5 or 6.  There also seems to be resentment about the shift in focus. As in ""it used to be about geeks enjoying geeky things with their non-geek neighbour, now it's all about everyone and their girlfriends"". This, they have decided, is bad writing. I personally think this is nonsense, because geeky things are still represented strongly, but the addition of Amy and Bernadette has added more colour to the show, not removed or overshadowed anything else.  IMO it's partly a matter of development. I'm not the same person I was 4 or 5 years ago, and I don't expect my sitcom characters to remain unchanged as they live their lives, either.  (sorry if you wanted a more specific example like a particular episode, I don't make any effort to remember such ""hater"" arguments)"

The thing that I feel is the focal point of hatred for this show is what it has done to geek culture. Previously geekdom was shared by individuals who loved the things they loved... comics, video games, sci fi, etc... Then this show came out and geekdom had a massive invasion by people who started identifying as ""geeks"". This in itself wouldn't be bad. However, from what I have heard, the majority of geeks do not feel like the characters are relatable to the ""geek"" experience. It feels fake, and at times insulting.   Just to add one little exercise in perspective. Consider this... You are a geek. You grow up as a geek, get bullied, insulted, picked on for loving what you love. Life sucks... Then The Big Bang Theory comes out and becomes insanely popular. People who once picked on you for being who you are now love a show that is supposed to represent a geek demographic... but doesn't. Instead, you see people going around saying ""Bazinga"" and identifying as ""geeks"".   Now I'm not saying that this has been everyone's experience of the show. I'm sure there are self-identifying ""geeks"" out there who enjoy the show. I just think that people get pretty upset when they feel like something that they suffered through gets misappropriated and twisted into something else."
bigbangtheory,34yjsf,KruskDaMangled,20,Tue May 5 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"The show turned into a very dull dating show   In the beginning they lured in ""geeks"" with a lot of cool stuff and refrences and very good writing but over the seasons the show just came to the point where everything is about who is dating who? and what are they doing?  Character development and real plot goes down the drain aswell because its easy to produce endless episodes like that and CBS gets shit tons of money like that."
bigbangtheory,34yjsf,LegendaryGinger,8,Tue May 5 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"Another criticism would be that some of the focus always has been, or shifted towards laughing ""at them"" not ""with them"" in the sense that the show is making fun of them, because they are geeks, for the benefit of the ""average viewer"". Which is apparently fairly successful because the show gets pretty good ratings and Jim Parsons is in commercials now, and got a huge pay hike."

The show is also not afraid to throw in lots of cheap and obvious jokes.  I like the show in concept, and most of the time it's executed well, but it's not exactly any real king of television comedy."

I'm a fan, and though I feel It has lost its charm, I still watch it. But, It just doesn't make me laugh like it used to. Tbh, I didn't even smile for most of the later seasons, let alone laugh. I was kind'a excited for this ""MomVSMom"" episode. I've been wanting for it happen since its inception of TBBT, and finally I got to see it. It was good, but I thought it was way too short.

Now people are hating TBBT because they think what the show is doing is ""Nerd Face"" which is similar to black face in a way that it's actors who aren't actual nerds(except Amy) are portraying stereotypical nerds and geeks and showing only the negative sides of being a Nerd (ex. their love of science fiction/ Leonards asthma/ being socially awkward etc etc etc)   This is the main reason people hate this show."

Anything better?. It would be cool if lesser known things were featured that viewers could learn about through watching the show. Mystic Warlords of Ka'a sounded cool, but that was just fictional, although I heard they made a crappy app for it.  I'm not offended at all by supposedly ""anti-nerd"" writing, heck, I love it when people (like Conan O'Brien) and other comedians ridicule nerds. Unfortunately tBBT is just a generic comedy with a few science and geek references mixed in. Hey, I don't blame the producers, it has proven to be a successful formula that makes $$$.

I met a guy somewhat similar to Raj, but even moreso...well, he wasn’t effeminate but he was often thought of as gay.  (you know, he “sounded” gay, he “acted” gay)  He wasn’t gay.  Not even close.

bigbangtheory,34ojik,DevilishRogue,8,Sun May 3 09:29:01 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong I'm as much of a fan now as I have ever been an Penny is still way cute. It's just that the show has evolved just as life would after several years and to keep it interesting they had to slowly change the characters loved to reflect how people would grow over time. After six or seven years even if they changed nothing it might seen odd that their lives never change. And there are real ppl writing this stuff who would slowly look for other projects and move on if they couldn't write the show as something that resembles real life an it's changes. The guys are growing up slowly an if it stays in the air for a couple more years don't be surprised if Howard an his wife have a baby am we see how a new married couple with a child deals with the fact that dad is nerd who can't wait to take his kid to a comic con for the first time. When a show tells every story it can tell and can't evolve writings and key actors don't renew contracts eventually an move to other projects because they've made money and don't want to be typecast. I wish Penny would stop cutting her hair and she'd the soccer mom look and I wish they'd reference more DnD doctor who an Star Trek and a visit to a comic con would be nice too and hopefully they'll get back into that. But if the show doesn't evolve it'll end sooner rather than later. And in a big fan so I rather it end much later than sooner.

The writers an a lot of the cast feel 10 would be enough and it's got plenty of shows for syndication. They could go on for 20 seasons and I'd still watch. I like both the characters as well as pretty much all of the actors who portray the main characters. It's not as good as seasons 1-3 but the show still holds it's own and I'd still watch as long as it's out there to view.  http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-renewed-season-687949

bigbangtheory,34pi6o,MissBeePee,9,Sun May 3 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, watch in order, you won't regret it."
bigbangtheory,34pi6o,kieranvs,5,Sun May 3 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"I think you mean Penny and Leonard. Penny and Howard never dated. But to answer your question: a few things have happened (not going to spoil anything) that made a small impact to the rest of the series, but nothing really important (mostly relationship stuff). Apart from that, you can perfectly watch this show in any order you want.  In fact, that's one of the things I like about TBBT. You can just watch a random episode when you got some time to fill. Still, I would recommend to watch the first three seasons in the correct order, just because those were the best in my opinion."

bigbangtheory,34pi6o,dipsta,2,Fri May 15 13:13:43 2015 UTC,"Building on /r/morphinglight's comment, you can basically watch the show in any order, the only thing that will be mixed up is the relationships.   I do highly recommend watching the show in order though, that way you can see how the characters grow and evolve, particularly Sheldon. Plus, why not enjoy the show's entirety in order? It's awesome."
bigbangtheory,34pi6o,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,2,Tue May 5 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm from the UK, E4 always just show them in some random fucking order... Get started from Season 1 - Episode 1 and stride up to date... All makes sense and comes together :)"
bigbangtheory,34pi6o,chrismichaels3000,-7,Wed May 6 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"Watch them in order, but stop around season 6 or so. The last few seasons have been pretty awful. The current season (the 8th) has been absolutely atrocious and not funny at all. The last few episodes of season 8 have convinced me to stop watching it altogether."

""Did the listing actually say 'miniature'?"" ""Cocktail shrimp are $12.50."" ""You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?"" ""Oh, get over yourself. It's a high-tech toilet."" ""He's right. This is an important achievement for two reasons. Number one, and of course, number two."" ""Interesting, Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor."" ""You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?"" ""Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma     dude."" ""It's not superstition, it's practically Newtonian. For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch. Therefore     he is reborn as a banana slug. It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around."" ""If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my frickin' latte."" ""He can't figure out how to fix it."" ""I'm trying. But you have to admit, this is pretty damn funny!"" ""Howard, wait. Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?""

""Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."" ""You're so arrogant!

Wonder what she sees in Leonard?"" ""Where does your mom keep the Crisco?""

The general theme of the show seems to have become ""You need a relationship to make you happy, even if it means abandoning everything that you used to value...Having a woman in your life is more important than being who you are."""

Personally, I think the whole emphasis on getting everyone in a relationship (I'm guessing to bring in more of the female audience) has had an element of making it more like every other show. But I still enjoy the show. It's a sitcom, so I keep my expectations realistic. Any long running comedy show is going to have what made it unique watered down over time."

It's not better than the other episodes, so it's just good.  The conflict between religion and Science was a highlight. Of course, this should happen at some point. The conflict arose, the mothers realized they shouldn't be rude at each other's beliefs, and they forgave each other. It's a good lesson, but it's very much expected. But of course, how else would it end up without belittling one or the other?  Also, I love it when Leonard's mother finally realized her failure to give Leonard the unconditional love that he needs from her. But I also wish this would be on a separate episode to which this is the highlight, because I like this part and I wish there could be more factors that would make her see that she had always given Leonard a hard time.  About Howard, Raj, Bernadette, and Stuart, long explanation short, it's meh.  TL;DR: Read the first paragraph."

One example is when Sheldon listed the women who have kissed him he left out Leonard's mother.  Even though she had already kissed him by that time.

bigbangtheory,33urkx,Jaymez82,-2,Sat Apr 25 21:50:03 2015 UTC,Alot of it is writers trying to cram cheap jokes into every three seconds of running time. It's becoming incredibly repetitive with each season.  Many people say and probably correctly that a show like big bang theory can't handle quite dramatic scenes properly. But the show an excellent as with season 8 badly underused cast.  Simon Helberg and Mayim Bialik have great quite scenes like that which make the humor in the episodes much easier to digest. And this because you can starting caring about the characters a bit.   Sheldon himself is played as a massive narcissist. In real life it's a serious personality disorder that makes the lives of significant others and children /r/raisedbynarcissists/ being an example. Maybe try to mine some humor of him doing some therapy or support group sessions. Have him become far more considerate with hints of who he is still remaining by the end of season 10 on the verge of starting a healthy family life?

bigbangtheory,33pxw5,callmeroo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:16:51 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, never. The writers have already ruined his character so much over the years. It would just water down the weird character and make him more normal.  Temperance Brennan from Bones was ruined as a character when they wrote out the characteristics that made her weird and awkward. Bones, much like Sheldon, had a little charm in her weirdness. Now, she is a normal mommy scientist and completely uninteresting.   Sex isn't as life changing for everyone as it is made out to be. Adding a sexual component to his character wouldn't add to the show and it wouldn't benefit the character."

Neither of the stories were particularly interesting, but it had its moments. The Raj story with his dad and mummy was a bit disappointing. It could've led to some character development for Raj, but instead it's just back to ground zero immediately after some cheap laughs off him manipulating his parents. The bit with Leonard in that dress was hilarious. The speech itself was a bit eh. It's a bit curious why the trip was canceled, it could have had some interesting background on Leonard, perhaps finally meet his dad?"

This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform.

bigbangtheory,3396n9,Hylian49,2,Fri Apr 24 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It seems a lot of comedy shows (at least American ones) take this route.  They start off well enough, peak, and then drag on in this painfully slow decline in quality until you're just watching because you like (or used to) the characters (looking at you, HIMYM)... then they just fizzle out anticlimatically and leave you wondering why something once so great had to turn so shitty.  You can kinda tell it's turning bad when the laugh track goes from accessory to the main engine of the show's humor. I guess this was kinda inevitable given that BBT's turned into a bit of a cash cow for the producers since it's so popular, but it's still really sad :("

At the start it was more or less a unique show, but over the years it turned in to just another generic show where people deal with relationships. It's all about relationships nowadays. No more creepy Howard or awkward Raj, they are totally different people now. Leonard feels like a generic character who could be played by anyone.   It's not really a fair comparison because of the amount of episodes, but look at The IT Crowd. The people there did not do a 180° with their personalities and every episode was unique and did not fall in the generic ""spouse does something bad and the partner gets mad"" category.  Nevertheless i still love the show and look forward to every episode."

While I do miss the older comedic topics like Wolowitz chasing women, Raj being mute when sober, and the way everything seemed simpler and quieter in the first season, I do enjoy the newer story lines involving all the relationships and the chemistry between all the characters that have come aboard.   It's probably for the best that things have changed to keep it fresh and some new jokes. It seems the shows that keep the same characters and stories each week get stale from wearing out the same jokes and ideas.  And on a final note, since the Big Bang Theory (not the show) happened, we've all been evolving, so it's fitting that the show should change as it goes on."

They tried to have a blend of various personalities from the introvert perspective. It's hard to find the line of where a character that's created has a dismal view of life and himself and therefore feels down all the time, and know how far to go with it while still being funny. Think they just too far with it at times. I don't know how much of the show you've watched so I hope I'm not giving away a spoiler but during season eight while living with someone's mom he seems to if turned around a bit. He's still a lonely sad case but he's not talking as if he could off himself anytime soon."
bigbangtheory,332745,Jobcv314,13,Sat Apr 18 20:36:07 2015 UTC,it's a tv show.  Raj couldn't speak in front of girls.  Wolowitz was creepy.  Sheldon can't handle life.  His girlfriend would be suicidal if she didn't cling to Penny and Sheldon.  Penny is an alcoholic.  It's all played for laughs.

bigbangtheory,332745,SignInName,2,Thu Apr 23 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I like how they are writing her into a more positive character, like when they were in Vegas and she found out she had work to do, and got it at least started whine Amy and Bernadette were out partying, she's becoming a more professional woman. I think it's funny if they bring up Penny's shall we say ""colorful"" past from time to time, especially when there's a joke to be made, just not bringing it up constantly....."
bigbangtheory,332745,Chernabog93,3,Thu Apr 23 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Stuart wasn't terrible when he had short cameos as the comic book shop owner but when they tried to develop him, there wasn't a substantial character to develop.  As a result, he meandered on with the some lackluster performance but with a much greater scope of attention on him when they transitioned him into a key role."
bigbangtheory,332745,uhohspgto,2,Sun Apr 19 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"What sometimes disturbs me is how the other characters never really react to his suicidal behaviour like they would irl, even though I know that is part of how tv characters behave (as if they knew that he would never kill himself because it's part of the show, hence their lack of reaction. I wonder if there's a name for this kind of trope). But yeah, sometimes it's a bit of bad taste.   Anyway he's much happier now that he's living with spoiler, which I think is a pretty good twist."

bigbangtheory,332745,drproximo,2,Sun Apr 19 03:37:27 2015 UTC,I guess I'm in the minority. I think Stuart and his depression is some of the funnier bits of the show. And I've had periods of depression in my life. It's kind of like laughing through the pain.

""How are you doing Stuart?""  ""Oh, not so good.""  ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!""  not really a joke."
bigbangtheory,332745,Spaceboot1,2,Sun Apr 19 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"He didn't start out that way.   Through time, however, the character developed, and they decided he was funnier  when he felt excluded, and that led to his character being depressed.   His lines were both funny and sad.  He's different now, since the storyline moved him in with Debbie."

Wolowitz's sexual antics.  (Not impossible I guess but...really?)  And take Stuart.  ""I have the bone density of an 80 year old man!"" or sleeping on a cot in the stockroom, cooking his dinner on a hot plate.  It's an exaggeration of any real situation and as such it should be so unrelatable it's comical.  Maybe it doesn't always work but that's the idea."

bigbangtheory,32vbh0,w00tthehuk,16,Sun Apr 19 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty unsatisfying episode if you ask me. Amy was hardly in it, Raj and Leonard proved that they are incapable of getting something done without being ruled over and both storylines were pretty boring.   That being said, there were some good things about this episode.  Bernadette was a lot less bitchy than usual. I expected her to get really mean after Howard said he was a leader but she was only mildly sarcastic.   Penny and Sheldon have been my favourite paring lately, and this episode was no exception. I love how well they get along. They really show that they've been friends for a long time."
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,Sylvermoon,4,Fri Apr 17 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"I've been saying since season one that they'll end up together, and I'm still not seeing anything that'll prevent it."
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,Sylvermoon,3,Fri Apr 17 19:53:03 2015 UTC,I actually never thought of them as a romantic couple. I think they work best as really good friends.
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,obo888888,3,Fri Apr 17 20:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'm probably crazy, but I agree with you.  I think it might be a long con on the part of the show.  For one - Aron's 36 Questions to love (1997 study on personal closeness, explicitly introduced in a heavy story ep.). Lot of them are questions that have been answered in one form or another on the show for the characters.  Two: In many cases, that reveal has been Penny pulling it from Sheldon.  Three: Sheldon saying ""this is whooey"" is show code for: ""this is true""  Four:  As an upstream poster noted, nearly everything else on the show is acidic or laughs.  (I have to skip Howadette scenes these days) It's almost like they're trying to contrast true love...  Five: Penny just completed the last step of Aron's 36 Questions, near the season finale, with Sheldon, Not Leonard.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it seems pretty telegraphed.  If I was really hopeful I'd say that was the plan from the start.  Pretty girl follows broken genius' roommate home, has mostly physical relationship, but never discovers true intimacy.  Meanwhile, genius and pretty girl find true intimacy while never touching.  There, elevator pitch to a studio exec that also sounds like a koan."
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,obo888888,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:48:06 2015 UTC,"Very compelling. Although not the basis of my assessment, your theory hits many salient points.  I figure they're meant to be simply because they have better chemistry than Penny and Leonard. Leonard's relationship with Penny is lopsided. He's clearly more into her than she is to him, he constantly strives to change for her approval. Not so with Sheldon and Penny, they have a friendship based on something besides need - they just click together.  It has been my experience that friendship is key to a long-lasting romance. You have to have that core of non-sexual, non-manipulative appreciation for each other that's evident in Penny/Sheldon and woefully absent in Penny/Leonard."
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,shanghainoodle777,2,Sun Apr 19 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"""they have better chemistry than Penny and Leonard"" & ""friendship is key to a long-lasting romance""  That's why I think its a long con and the note about ""true intimacy without touching"".  They have always had better chemistry, friendly or otherwise - explicitly so.  The intellectual growth of Penny, and the emotional growth of Sheldon together (and their evil twins, the isolated desire of Leonard / Penny and Amy / Sheldon) has been the focus of numerous episode storylines.  I would argue its actually the main plot of the show.  What two characters have had the most episodes devoted to them becoming better people?  As well as callbacks to remind us of that growth (like ""Intimacy Acceleration"")?  Ex:  In competitive episodes (ex: ex: scavenger hunt) what is almost always the best team?:  Sheldon + Penny [or] Amy + ""someone who's not Sheldon"" (Leonard most recently, Howard in the scavenger hunt).  Also note, a lot of this is Dave Goetsch.  Seriously, go look at the episode list, and the plotlines of those episodes.  Every episode with Dave Goetsch as Story / Teleplay credit = downfall of Shammy / Lenny, rise of Sheldon / Penny.  (He even matches A, B, C story credit prominence)  A short list:  ""The Monster Isolation"", ""The 43 Peculiarity"", ""The Higgs Boson Observation"", ""The Scavenger Vortex"", ""The Hesitation Ramification"", ""The Indecision Amalgamation"", ""The Expedition Approximation"", ""The Intimacy Acceleration"", ""The Colonization Application"", ""The Communication Deterioration"".  Dave's inclusion is almost a perfect predictor of whether an episode is a Lenny / Shammy trouble + Penny / Sheldon wuv episode.  3 of the last 6.  This is a plotline, with a person who was put in charge of that plotline, it is climaxing, and I think we're going to get Sheldon physical intimacy, just not what people expect.  ""Sheldon!  You're kissing me!?""  (Penny is one of few shown characters with whom Sheldon has also already, voluntarily (no tricks Amy), initiated intimate physical contact, multiple times - a huge stepping stone to eventual coitus.)  What other pairing has anything close to ""soft kitty"", ""Spock's DNA"", ""I can't remember my life without you"" & ""he's hugging me!!"".  Oh right, Howard / Raj......Bazinga.  TL;DR - Penny and Sheldon sitting in a tree.  After 8 years comes love..."
bigbangtheory,32vbh0,fire810,8,Sun Apr 19 20:52:30 2015 UTC,Past seasons it seemed like most of the episodes involved the group together. This season it feels like a soap opera where the group is kind of spilt up into these mini events and they hardly ever crossover into another characters. It doesn't feel like the group anymore.

bigbangtheory,324lhj,saxy8485,31,Fri Apr 10 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"It's all a matter of perspective, as the viewer that is. It also plays a role in the comedic tone of the production.  Basically the main idea is that with a single-camera setup, the dialog from each actor's perspective is filmed separately (with one camera), and then combined into a cohesive performance through editing. These tend to feel more cinematic (sharper cuts, heavier editing), but run the risk of feeling stiff if the actors can't respond right without ""feeding"" off the other actors in a performance. Examples of single-camera shows are 30 Rock & Modern Family.  Multi-Camera sitcoms have everyone in the scene acting at once, with multiple cameras fixed on all of the actor's faces. This setup gives the sitcom a ""live"" feeling, because you get the reactions of the actors in response to the dialog they are hearing in one take (in real-time, not a lot of editing). They run the risk of being corny, or feeling 'forced'. Examples are How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory.

bigbangtheory,324lhj,saxy8485,3,Fri Apr 10 23:33:05 2015 UTC,Learned something today. Thanks.
bigbangtheory,324lhj,dpierrot,3,Sat Apr 11 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, on Reddit especially, they joke about anything. Literally anything: 9/11, Boston bombing, Holocaust, racism, sexism, etc... But make a few jokes about being a ""nerd"" and they get offended? Shit, I'm wondering what they are doing on the internet. I like the show (I used to love it with the earlier seasons) and I get quite a few laughs from each episode. I think it also has to do with how popular the show is and can't stand liking something that is so well liked."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,man_on_hill,2,Tue Apr 14 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"Oddly, I like TBBT, but I have a nearly allergic aversion to most sitcoms.  It's the reliance on formula: I watched way too many sitcoms growing up and now I can't unsee the formulaic plots. Big Bang Theory is one of very few sitcoms that fails to set it off.  It's odd, because TBBT is not really any less formulaic than other sitcoms. I'm just glad I'm able to enjoy it."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,Lurkndog,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:15:02 2015 UTC,I have never really felt that Big Bang was making fun of nerds but I guess I can understand why people see it that way? To me TBBT has enough insider jokes that I as a nerd laugh out loud at. My parents who really know nothing of pop culture or fandoms find it funny as well but also beg me to explain some of the more specific nerd jokes
bigbangtheory,324lhj,DisneyFreakk,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"This is a tough issue for me in my own social group. Everyone is a ""nerd"" of some kind. Some of the group never finished HS but they love the sci-fi and comic book humor, and then there is the group of us who have graduate level educations and we get the science jokes as well. Depending upon which jokes you get and which ones your don't, the laughter at the end could either be laughing with the guys, or at the guys. I still enjoy much of the humor, even knowing that in the same room, some people are laughing because they get the joke, and others are laughing because they don't."

Here are some problems that I don't have with the show:   the other kids were mean to me; boo hoo! high ratings means that it's bad somehow? I'm just jealous because I don't have my own TV show.   Aaaand for balance, here's a list of things that I like about the show:   my mom likes it, and it gives us something to talk about. while the nerd stuff is often shallow, they do the research. the characters are pretty likeable (even Wolowitz). I particularly like Amy, especially the creepy version. Penny in that yoga outfit.   My opinion of the show has mellowed over the years.  I used to think it was complete shit, and now it's kind of a guilty pleasure.  In any case, my disdain for the show never really transferred to its fans.  Don't take that shit personally, it's okay for people to dislike stuff that you like.  You are not a TV show."

I guess the fact that two of those three things are about her relationship to Wolowitz suggests that either she could use some character development, or maybe I should take a closer look at her."

bigbangtheory,324lhj,burst_bagpipe,17,Fri Apr 10 15:33:47 2015 UTC,They didn't. It's still a live audience. Hardest sitcom tickets to get.
bigbangtheory,324lhj,mathemon,14,Fri Apr 10 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"They never did. They ""remix"" the laughs, if that makes any sense. When you do 10 takes of the same scene with the same joke, it's unlikely to get a good reaction out of the audience every time."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,Zenben88,2,Fri Apr 10 16:11:30 2015 UTC,Yes they did. They even show it on the special about TBBT.  Edit: just reread your comment and understand what you mean now. I guess that makes sense.

bigbangtheory,324lhj,Hepcat10,6,Fri Apr 10 16:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm the only one of my friends who openly admits to watching TBBT (it's not my favorite show but I do enjoy it) and I get shit for it from my buddies all the time. Except whenever they come over my house to hang out and TBBT is on tv they all watch it and laugh so I guess most people either never watch the show or kind of secretly like it.

They have to constantly prove they're geekier or more intellectual then thou.   The Big Bang Theory for now is the most popular sitcom, and they feel the need to present themselves as some sort of brooding outcast with a strong sense of class."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,tmow329,12,Fri Apr 10 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"Sitcoms generally fall into two categories: laugh-at and laugh-with. In a laugh-with comedy, we're expected to see a part of ourselves in the characters. We empathize with what they go through, and laugh because we feel their pain. Laugh-with comedies are the ones which tend to feature character growth.  ""Friends"" is a good example of this.  The laugh-at comedy is one in which we don't empathize as much with the characters. We laugh because we enjoy seeing them suffer the folly of their own actions. We usually don't feel bad, because the characters usually have some character flaw - usually, they're just assholes. Most laugh-at comedies feature flat, two dimensional characters that don't grow or change.  Some laugh-at comedies will cross back and forth into laugh-with territory, generally to keep the tone from getting too dark.  ""Seinfeld"" was a good example of a laugh-at comedy.  I think a lot of people view The Big Bang Theory as a laugh-at comedy, and I've seen different reasons for it. Some feel the characters are crude or mean-spirited caricatures. Some feel (most) of the cast are two-dimensional, and never evolve.  And some feel the writer's attempts to make us empathize with the characters crosses way over into ""pity"" territory.  I, personally, disagree with these ideas...I see BBT as a laugh-with comedy. I empathize with these characters, and see myself and my friends in them. I see growth, and evolution of character...it's slow, and I think that's true to life for the kinds of people they portray. Like this week's episode, every time I'm ready to give up on Sheldon, every time I think, ""this person NEVER CHANGES!!"", we see a bit of growth...a tiny crack in the shell.  Even Sheldon grows and changes, possibly on a geologic time scale, but still...  But I think that's the key. If you feel we're meant to laugh with the characters on BBT, you probably enjoy the show. If you feel we're meant to laugh at them, you probably see it as cruel or unkind. Because they are more sympathetic than not. Sure, they're caricatures...characters in comedies usually are...but not (I feel) in a cruel or unkind fashion."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,inkblot14,9,Fri Apr 10 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"They all essentially encounter the same problems as anyone else, just with the added bonus (?) of them being considered nerdy or geeky. They have relationship problems, family problems, roommate problems, work problems, etc, so basically like any other show.   But they like Star Wars and Star Trek and comic books and video games. So instead of sitting in a bar drinking, or sitting in a coffee house, they use nerdy type activity as the filler."
bigbangtheory,324lhj,mitten-troll,6,Fri Apr 10 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"Nerd till I die and I love these characters. I feel like the last couple seasons have fizzled out a bit, but I really like that characters like Wolowitz and Sheldon have developed as characters.  It is like when I get to catch up with old friends every now and then (chemist, computer tech, geologist, and paleontologist) and I love that they are all still SO nerdy, but grown ups now too."

bigbangtheory,324lhj,DaddyCatALSO,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"Blackface:       Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used by performers to represent a black person. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the proliferation of stereotypes such as the ""happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation"" or the ""dandified coon"".  In 1848, blackface minstrel shows were an American national art of the time, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.  Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form in its own right, until it ended in the United States with the U.S. Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

And it happens that there are plenty of nerds on reddit, so you see the anti-TBBT stuff frequently.  But the main issue is that when a group is represented, like TBBT or Fresh of the Boat, if it's not 100% accurate then it's going to be controversial. Anything that feels 'off' to some members of that group will be offensive to some of them, because it hits close to home - ""finally they are showing us in a sitcom, and this is what they end up with?!"" etc.  So I think its easily understandable why some people hate it, and why they are a large group on reddit.

They make some joke about a character who watches ""The Big Explosion Hypothesis"". Must be bad if relatively mainstream media is in on it.

Whenever they teased and made digs last night at least there where relaxed smiles.   Though she's easily the best actor in the show I like that this time Bialik didn't overplay when Sheldon took the next milestone. Just had the character play it kinda cool trying to negotiate through Sheldon's fear of intimacy.

But as much of a fan as i'm of TBBT i really think they could have done Howards brother better all we know is that he lives in Diego and is an oceanologist. Instead of Howard showing off his magic, astronaut thing i believe if we learnt more about him and a few reasons as to why Sam wolowitz acted the way he acted, maybe have the brother quote their dad on how tough it was to live with Mrs. Wolowitz, what i'm saying is maybe Sam left howard not because he hated him but because he had enough of mrs wolowitz and then maybe have episodes of howard thinking whether he truly loved his mother or just loved the fact that there is lady taking care of him and treating him like a king around the house."

bigbangtheory,319gzy,fire810,10,Sat Apr 4 16:11:53 2015 UTC,This episode? She's been a bit of a bitch through the last few seasons.
bigbangtheory,319gzy,8ac9f701e815e08418bd,8,Fri Apr 3 20:34:00 2015 UTC,| bit of a bitch in this episode  Just this episode?
bigbangtheory,319gzy,WilliamMcCarty,17,Sat Apr 4 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah she is the ""I love you but I'll change every bit of you after I marry you"" type. I really don't like that character."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,Sertori,16,Fri Apr 3 08:20:56 2015 UTC,"She's been doing that from the very beginning. Like back when she wanted Howard to move out of his mom's, but he wasn't supposed to bring any of his stuff with him. Having been in a relationship like that when I was younger, I find nothing cute about it. The woman was an abusive, controlling cunt, and that's becoming the only way I can see Bernadette in this show."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,BAXterBEDford,2,Fri Apr 3 11:47:50 2015 UTC,As much as I don't like Bernadette I did think Howard should move out of his mom's house. He totally shoulda been able to bring stuff with him though. But he totally needed to move out.
bigbangtheory,319gzy,VulcanCitizen,6,Sun Apr 5 06:56:57 2015 UTC,I don't know a lot about Doctor Who but Bernadette was being a bit of a bitch in this episode season   FTFY
bigbangtheory,319gzy,the_foxy_cow,2,Fri Apr 3 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah i really don't care for her. She might as well not be in the show. I loved everyone else in the episode though, fun lines and kind of back to the roots."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,w00tthehuk,15,Wed Apr 8 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this episode sucked.  Also, what ever happened to Sheldon moving out? It was kinda a big moment like 6 episodes ago (they were at the mall and Sheldon flipped the fuck out when Leonard wanted to live with Penny and not him).    Also, in ping pong, you have to win by 2, and I'm pretty sure you can't win on your own serve, so Amy (or Raj) could not have won"
bigbangtheory,319gzy,the_foxy_cow,8,Fri Apr 3 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"Lots of normally changing circumstances were just put in for a single episode and the producers have been quite open about them taking on the series episode by episode, which means that they mostly start from the same status quo. Actual gamechangers are few and far between, despite several hints at them. Leonard should have heard about his tenure months ago, Alex vanished without a word and Leonard wanted to move Sheldon out. I don't know if it's the producers being practical since there are at least another two seasons to stretch a wider story arc over, but it has made the show devolve to Friends with popnerd culture references.  As for the ping pong it's probably a more accurate depiction about people who never played competitively. I know I never used any tournament rules for a quick game with friends, and the basketball match between Sheldon and Kripke wasn't exactly following olympic standards either."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,Firekracker,4,Fri Apr 3 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming everyone got a 'no' from the tenure committee.  And it is very possible that Alex finished her grad/doctoral work and moved on with her life, or realized Sheldon is not worth working with  (Although, Sheldon grilling her at her thesis defence would be a worth while story line)."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,the_foxy_cow,2,Fri Apr 3 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Most likely Alex just moved to another advisor, presumably an associate or full prof rather than research grantee."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,DaddyCatALSO,6,Sun Apr 5 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"I see Leonard moving in with Penny during the season finale, though, there isn't much story left. Penny / Leonards wedding, and Sheldon / Amy, sex or moving in together, and that's about it."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,Flokiyo,16,Fri Apr 3 13:44:16 2015 UTC,So they just destroyed a full scale Tartis so they could turn it into a door?
bigbangtheory,319gzy,Justice_Prince,10,Fri Apr 3 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who had issues with this technicality... Honestly that's the thing that irritated me the most, but I'm a big Doctor Who fan.  The bedroom door piece hardly looks like it could have even come from the same TARDIS in the garage.  I guess from the angle of Amy's bedroom, you couldn't do as Bernadette had suggested and placed it in front of the door, but it still annoyed me.    Then I realized it's a TV show and I was still entertained, so I needed to get over it.  Until I saw your post! Ha :)"
bigbangtheory,319gzy,OutdoorNerd,5,Fri Apr 3 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they were different props.  The full Tartis was likely something the rented, and the door might have been built by their own prop department.  I just hope the door stays through the rest of the series."
bigbangtheory,319gzy,Justice_Prince,5,Fri Apr 3 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree.  I just felt like it looked too different.  Again, weekly TV show, shouldn't expect but so much- I know."

Kaley is beautiful enough without having to make such wardrobe choices.  Low cut shirts and tight dresses are enough I think? It's not really a big deal to me one way or another, but fits in the same vein as cheap plot/writing ideas IMO. Probably will get downvotes, ;).

Overall just a boring repetitive episode with no real plot advancements."

bigbangtheory,31a1fe,SlowlyCrazy,19,Fri Apr 3 04:56:27 2015 UTC,"Do you judge a child to be a bad person because they throw tantrums and are very selfish?  Sheldon just develops more slowly. It took him like 3 seasons, but he is finally becoming more comfortable with and sensitive towards the feelings of his own girlfriend Amy.  He is very intelligent, but has the social skills of a very young child. He has grown noticeably."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,Ramin_HAL9001,35,Fri Apr 3 05:41:57 2015 UTC,He dropped everything when Penny needed to go to the hospital. He saved Leonards life and career when he stopped him from getting in the lift with rocket fuel. He loaned Penny the money she needed to pay her rent etc. He accompanies Leonard when they go to get Penny's tv from her ex.  Sheldon is a good guy who loves his friends dearly and has a lot of trouble with social conventions.  He is literally Leonards best friend and they spend ALL of their time together. You're just focusing on the things he does wrong.  Do you think Penny is a villian because she says something sarcastic to every geeky interest Leonard has and mocks him all the time? She's really the worst behaved of all the characters by far.
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,the_timps,4,Fri Apr 3 06:15:50 2015 UTC,He offered Dr. Lorvis a hot beverage.  He showed genuine concern when Leonard had surgery.  After Dr Proton passed he showed grief and embraced Leonard.
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,unreqistered,-2,Fri Apr 3 15:53:52 2015 UTC,All your examples are from the early seasons when he was a better character. Now he's just an asshole.
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,therobotking,2,Fri Apr 3 09:42:37 2015 UTC,Can you cite specific instances of him being an asshole?
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,unreqistered,4,Fri Apr 3 12:03:02 2015 UTC,"The itchy red jumper episode springs to mind. Spoiling Harry Potter for Leonard and his ""good!"" reaction when told it was a spoiler. His years of constant emotional abuse of Amy. Shall I continue?"
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,therobotking,2,Fri Apr 3 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Leonard agreed to wear the sweater.  Leonard's expectation that discussing a book published eight years prior would not involve context regarding the events.......and didn't he already see the movie?  Amys clingy needs?  I think you should continue, you haven't made any valid points yet."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,unreqistered,6,Fri Apr 3 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Oh you mean the episode where Amy tells Sheldon that what he did was diabolical because he set Leonard up? Sorry, he's an asshole.  Leonard clearly hadn't seen the movie because Sheldon being an asshole about the spoiler was the catalyst for him to try and move in with Penny. What did Sheldon do when he realised how upset Leonard was? Dump another spoiler on him as he was leaving. Why? Asshole.  Amy isn't needy, she just wants a normal relationship and as the show will not allow them to break up we must deal with Sheldon going out of his way to make her miserable. Remember the episode which ended with him going to her apartment and she thought he was apologising for being rude but it turned out he was talking about her and the episode ended with her slamming the door in his face? Asshole."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,therobotking,-1,Sat Apr 4 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Amy has been well aware that Sheldon is not into kissing/sex since they first met the only reason she wants Sheldon to be more romantic is because her two only friends constantly talk about sex and love. Also Leonard has been more of an Ass-hole in the past. Scaring Sheldon at work, letting him stay at uni despite finishing his research. Also the most ass-hole thing anyone could ever do use an electric can opener to make Sheldon think String Theory is working during the return from north pole episode he could have gotten his Dr license revoked and had Sheldon's PHD's mean nothing if anyone found out that sheldon based papers proving such a huge theory for science and mankind on a can opener."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,movieman994,10,Sun Apr 5 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Sheldon means well.  He's a little egocentric in the sense that he only cares what he thinks for the most part (and this has slowly changed over the course of the show) but his general lines of reasoning are:  1) ""I'm the smartest person on the planet."" 2) ""I want what's best for people and for them to be happy."" 3) ""Since I'm the smartest person on the planet, I can't be wrong."" 4) ""Therefore, my way is the best way for everyone else.""  It's frustrating and he sometimes delves into selfishness (see for example the Star Trek Transporter toy) but for the most part, he means well, and he tries.  That makes him a good person.  Tolerable?  Not always.  Well-meaning?  Definitely.  Good?  I'd have to say yes."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,sneauxoui,2,Fri Apr 3 06:32:26 2015 UTC,"Sheldon doesn't always mean well. Some of the time he is written as being very self-centered, bordering on egomania, bordering on supervillain.   Other times he is written as being aware of his own limitations, and somewhat vulnerable as a result.  He is much more likeable then.   And sometimes he means well and still does exactly the wrong thing, like the unfortunate scenes with his African American faculty advisor."

bigbangtheory,31a1fe,VulcanCitizen,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:05:54 2015 UTC,"I for one think that he was actually way more sophisticated and genuinely kind in the earlier seasons. During that time he genuinely didn't know social context, but was a friendly person. At some point around season three or four that changed into the loudmouth asshole that made his popularity boom in public. Now he knows what he is doing and gleefully puts people in awkward situations. The writers heavily rely on him during almost all episodes, there are obvious setups for him to just blurt out something inappropriate and everybody shaking his head at him. At some point they even began putting in mere reaction shots of a single character doing just that.   But the other characters don't get away much better in my opinion. Just like in HIMYM, over time the characters would occasionally pull off some sort of asshole move or act as extremely bad friends for a quick 10 second joke, and these instances add up qiockly. At this point I'd consider neither a genuinely nice person I'd want to be friends with, with the exception of maybe Raj who mostly is the butt of the jokes. Bernadette and Penny are a perfect example of it happening again in the recent episode."
bigbangtheory,31a1fe,Firekracker,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:35:35 2015 UTC,"At first, I thought of Sheldon in the same terms, and the ""caricature"" became more grating and not so funny. And to be fair, there have been some heartwarming moments he has brought about, paricularly in the last few seasons, so those would be good to catch up on.  However, I have begun to think of his character as someone who takes the science he knows as seriously as some people (like his mother and possibly memaw) take their faith/religion.  If Sheldon thinks that survival of the fittest is a core tenet of evolutionary biology, which we have no reason to doubt, many of his ""ruder"" actions make sense. Since the resources he wants and needs to thrive can sometimes be difficult for him to obtain, it makes sense for him to do whatever he needs to do to obtain them. If that means being generally unbearable to those around him (who are ultimately in this theory his competition), so be it, he has gotten what he wants, and seeing to their needs is only secondary at best. However, when the other characters call his bluff and are willing to match him, he becomes a lot more willing to get along, since that peace will benefit him in the long term.  About the only challenge to this theory is that so far he has no progeny to pass along these traits, so thus far this actions only benefit him and are pointless in longer terms.  Also, remember that he was raised in Texas, and as the stereotype goes, ""Don't mess with Texas.""  Especially in his less politically correct moments, he may be acting on latent thinking from his childhood that hasn't grown up with him.   Some of his actions may be somewhat expected in Texas, but are a little more dissonant in California."

bigbangtheory,30z0vw,jackonager,4,Wed Apr 1 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"Well, the main joke is that it is a ridiculous thing to say, since Daniel Boone isn't a controversial figure at all. Going deeper, Boone was an explorer, which may conflict with Sheldon's not liking to get out and try new things. And Boone was the one settle Kentucky, so it may be a bash at Kentuckians."

As a nerd, it's the same thing, you have non nerd friends, likely relatives too, where they just don't get a hobby you have or your work. When you see the show and a situation arises you can relate to it. You've been there.

Plus showing that Penny didn't have to give up her dreams of being a star just because she had a baby felt nice. My original plan for the ending was to have them moving out because Penny was having a second baby and they needed more space, but I read somewhere about Penny finally having her big break and I thought yeah she deserves that she was good in the play."
bigbangtheory,2zbsxq,hykolonic,2,Tue Mar 17 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the read, and I feel that the story is paced well throughout.  I like that Stuart (and Leslie) has a happy ending, but I think that it might also work if Stuart were to end up with Alex - along the lines of Sheldon sending her to the comic book shop to pick up a wedding present for Leonard.  I think Raj and Emily could be fleshed out a bit more, but I like the stuff you have there, especially not making sure they are married, but if they were to arrange a triple marriage, Beverly's plan could include Raj's parents (and maybe even Priya), so many of the main characters' parents could make an appearance.  Maybe even without the wedding, if Beverly's plan could include Raj's parents and Bernadette's, we could have a really full cast in the final season, but that might be reaching.    I nominate Roseanne to play Penny's mom (keeping with the appearances of other Roseanne alum, and also in reference to a crack Sheldon made about Penny's eating) and maybe John Goodman to play Howard's father."
bigbangtheory,2zbsxq,50doctorwho,2,Tue Mar 17 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"That is an excellent idea for Roseanne to play Penny's mom especially since she's blonde now. I was thinking about him ending up with Lucy Raj's ex since she was kind of skittish and he's kind of skittish they'd make a good pairing. He's willing to take anything so he wouldn't mind going slow for Lucy as long as he had a girlfriend. I also felt that Raj and Emily had only been together for like a year by the time everyone else is getting married where as Amy and Sheldon has five years under their belt and Leonard and Penny have the longest out of all of them even if most of that time wasn't as a couple. Plus Emily doesn't strike me as the kind of girl who wants to get married, she seems very lax and non-committal. She seems to have a good job but still has a roommate.Penny works at Cheesecake factory and she affords to live alone."
bigbangtheory,2zbsxq,Ando_11,2,Tue Mar 17 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with where they are in the relationship.  I think that, even if its not for marriage, some way for Raj's parents to be brought back in and maybe accept Emily would be a good way to complete their story, especially if for some reason they end up back together.  By the way, I really, really liked asking how Penny afforded the apartment and leaving it unanswered.  As a whole, I think your season would make a great ending to the series."
bigbangtheory,2zbzup,himmatsj,6,Tue Mar 17 09:06:52 2015 UTC,Turtle is an overarching term which includes tortoises.

bigbangtheory,2zbzup,Backstop,2,Tue Mar 17 14:18:43 2015 UTC,Turtles and tortoises are two different animals.  One (I forget which) lives on both land and sea.
bigbangtheory,2zbzup,bigyorkie,-4,Tue Mar 17 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the ones people keep at home are always called tortoises, as far as I know. Turtles are the ones that live in the sea."

bigbangtheory,2zbzup,sheepdawg7,2,Tue Mar 17 10:08:21 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Turtle, tortoise, or terrapin of article  Turtle:       The word chelonian is popular among veterinarians, scientists, and conservationists working with these animals as a catch-all name for any member of the superorder Chelonia, which includes all turtles living and extinct, as well as their immediate ancestors. [citation needed] Chelonia is based on the Greek word χελώνη chelone ""tortoise"", ""turtle"" (another relevant word is χέλυς chelys ""tortoise""),   also denoting armour or interlocking shields;  testudines on the other hand, is based on the Latin word testudo ""tortoise"".  ""Turtle"" may either refer to the order as a whole, or to particular turtles which make up a form taxon that is not monophyletic.

bigbangtheory,2zbzup,sheepdawg7,0,Tue Mar 17 10:08:29 2015 UTC,"Turtles generally live on both land and water, whilst tortoises live only on land. So you are right. Americans use the term turtles as an umbrella term. No idea why. They do some really unusual stuff like call tortoises turtles and use imperial units.   edit: you might also come across the term ""terrapin"" for some species of turtle. There is no definitive taxonomic definition of what a terrapin is"
