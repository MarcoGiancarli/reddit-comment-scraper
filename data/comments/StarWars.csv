StarWars,3e1i5c,BearBruin,277,Tue Jul 21 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Make it an homage to Sanjuro, the Kurosawa film.  Obi-Wan arrives in Anchorhead to buy supplies and finds that someone there is intercepting the town's tax payments to the Empire. He overhears group of locals, led by Huff Darklighter (Biggs's dad), tell an Imperial Inquisitor who they think it is: a moisture farmer named Owen Lars whose farm is near where the last shipment was ambushed.  Obi-Wan introduces himself to the group as ""Ben"" and tries to talk some sense into them and suggests that the Imperials are the most likely culprit since they are the only ones that know the route the shipment will take. The Imperial and his Stormtroopers become hostile and Ben and the group are forced to flee.  Assuming Owen (and more importantly Luke) is in danger, he and his new allies ride to their farm and find Luke (now the same age as Anakin when they first met) and Beru held prisoner by Stormies. Ben kills them (with a blaster), frees Luke and Beru and finds that Owen has been arrested and is being held at the local Imperial garrison.  Ben goes undercover as a bounty hunter to infiltrate the garrison, but he was followed by Darklighter and 3 others. They are captured outside the garrison by Stormtroopers who Ben has to kill as well. He has Darklighter's men knock him out, and when more Imperials find him, he lies and says it was Sand People. The Imperial Captain is not impressed and says he has no need for a Bounty Hunter who can't handle a few Sand People. Ben vows to find their camp.  He goes back to Darklighter and tells him his plan. After luring the soldiers out, he will set off a smoke flare on a guard tower which is the signal for them to rush the place.  Ben returns to the garrison and tells the Captain that he has found the Sand People, but it is a large group. So the Captain sends his men to take them out. As Ben sneaks up the tower to set off the flare, he is stun blasted by the Inquisitor, who puts him in binders. The Inquisitor tells Ben he has recalled the troops and they should be back soon. So, Ben uses the force to set off the flare, and Darklighter and his men rush in, take out the few remaining troops and rescue Owen from the dungeon.  Ben uses the Force to free himself from the binders and when the Inquisitor ignites his Lightsaber and attacks, snarling ""Jedi!"" Ben lops off his head in one stroke as he lights his own blade (for the first time in the movie.) Darklighter's men hail him as a great warrior but he tells them ""Wars do not make one great.""  The Captain was killed in the chaos and with the Stormtroopers likely returning soon, the group heads to the Lars farm. Before they arrive, Owen thanks him for the help, but tells Ben to leave him and his family alone. They want nothing to do with Jedi any more. Ben nods, puts up his hood and walks into the Jundland wastes as the suns set."

StarWars,3e1i5c,OccamsRizr,5,Tue Jul 21 11:42:22 2015 UTC,"I think what could potentially work would be Obi Wan unravelling a mystery using only his wits and lightsaber, kind of like we saw in Attack of the Clones. He obviously has an established relationship with Leia during IV, so it stands to reason that he wouldn't just sit watching Luke all the time, but rather he'd help the rebels when he had the opportunity."
StarWars,3e1i5c,DaEvil1,12,Tue Jul 21 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I sort of assumed she had been informed of Obi Wan by Bail Organa, who had possibly instructed her to send the message. But I'm no expert!"
StarWars,3e1i5c,eyewatchyousleep,2,Tue Jul 21 12:24:03 2015 UTC,"I always thought he had been doing missions for Bail for some time before ANH. He tells Luke that he's ""getting too old for this sort of thing,"" but nothing like ""I haven't done anything like this in years."" I think Bail and the Alliance had relied on him to do Jedi-things for over a decade, but he really needed someone new because there was no way he could stop Vader alone."

StarWars,3e1i5c,bdez90,2,Tue Jul 21 10:48:23 2015 UTC,"What about a plot where he tries to go save other Jedi? Each time he gets to a location where a Jedi was calling for help he finds them dead. During his travels he learns to communicate with Qui-Gon. On his way back to Tatooine he picks up one last beacon from a Jedi. He heads to the location to find the Jedi still alive. As they get ready to depart Vader, The emperor, or an army of storm troopers show up and end up having to battle. During the battle they get split up and the other Jedi is able to distract the Sith or troopers long enough for Obi wan to plan an escape. The movie ends with the Jedi giving his life so Obi wan can escape or something like that."

StarWars,3e1i5c,WV6l,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Since you seem serious, I'll take a stab at a serious answer:  Just as we see with the recent Star Wars Rebels series, there's plenty of things that Obi Wan can do. It's a big galaxy, and he doesn't technically have to lurk on Tatooine for 20 years...he could conduct clandestine missions on behalf of Bail Organa and Mon Mothma, help organize the Rebel Alliance in it's early years, etc.  The greatest storyline, in my view, would involve an explanation on why Vader didn't pursue his former mentor to exact revenge. For some reason, he just gave up the hunt.   There could be a pretty cool story told about how Obi shows up and lays waste to some Imperial plans and saves some folks, but Vader somehow believes that he was killed in the middle of the operation."

I really don't need a han solo one because we, as viewers, don't need to know Han's story before we meet him in the Mos Eisley Cantina but with Obi-wan. I feel there's so much more we can tell of him during the time between III and IV.   The fans want it, Ewan is up for it too, we just need Kathleen Kennedy to make the call."

StarWars,3e1i5c,OfficialGarwood,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"Speak for yourself bruh,  I am a greedy bastard, I want both!  The problem with a solo back story is getting an actor who can pull off a young Harrison Ford and endear himself to the audience.  You don't have that problem with and Obi Wan stand alone."

StarWars,3e1i5c,GoogleNoAgenda,133,Tue Jul 21 06:18:58 2015 UTC,Han Solo was my favourite character but I seriously don't want him to have his own movie. Ewan in an Obi-Wan movie would be amazing. He was the best part of the prequels.
StarWars,3e1i5c,DarkLake,30,Tue Jul 21 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"Hold on, you DON'T want a Han Solo movie? Of all the main characters in Star Wars, his is the story that is most varied and has the most room for an interesting movie. I love Obi-Wan, but we basically know his story. We know exactly what he is up to from Episode 1 to Episode 3, and we obviously know what he gets up to from Episode 4 on. The only room there is a tiny, tiny gap between Episode 3 and 4, and we know he spent most of his time on Tatooine because Uncle Owen and Luke speak about him like he has been there for a while.  Han Solo, on the other hand, could literally be doing anything in the time period before Episode 4, and with the way they have scrubbed the canon he could pretty much do anything set between the episodes as well(well, except the time period between 5 and 6. We know exactly what he was doing then. He was busy being a wall fixture in Jabba's palace)  My point is that most of the main character's stories are too confined to give us a good spin-off. Han Solo is a character who's life is bound to be interesting, even outside of the stories we have seen, and his part in the movies doesn't confine him. There is a lot of room to get creative with."
StarWars,3e1i5c,JackalKing,87,Tue Jul 21 10:16:03 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason people want an Obi-Wan movie more than a Han Solo movie is because it is a chance to see one of the original actors again. And not just any actor, but the best one from the prequels.  As much as we like Han Solo, seeing another actor portraying him is gonna be weird at first."
StarWars,3e1i5c,TheLieLlama,25,Tue Jul 21 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why I'm not ok with another actor portraying a younger version of Han Solo, but I was ok with it for Obi Wan."
StarWars,3e1i5c,Methylobacterium,39,Tue Jul 21 11:44:50 2015 UTC,"Difference being Obi-Wan was 30~ years younger, while Han couldn't be more than 10 years younger.  Easier to accept it in the former case than the latter."
StarWars,3e1i5c,TheLieLlama,44,Tue Jul 21 11:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think the big thing is that Ewan has not only put more time into the character than anyone else, but he started out by pulling it off so damn well. When I think of Obi-Wan now, I think of Ewan, not Sir Alec."
StarWars,3e1i5c,jrodx88,3,Tue Jul 21 12:16:29 2015 UTC,"Partially because Alec Guinness is barely in the original trilogy.  He is probably has the least lines of any main character.  We got to spend more time with Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan than we did with Guinness.  I think the age gap that LieLama mentioned is another reason.  But, partially, its because Harrison Ford IS Han Solo.  They are sort of one in the same.  Many actors could pull off the stoic British wise man, but Solo is a character that is unique to Ford's charming smugness.  It will be hard for another actor to capture that, and in the same way the prequels hurt the original trilogy, I don't want to see a lesser version of Solo on screen that would somehow affect my liking of the character in rewatching the original and upcoming trilogy."
StarWars,3e1i5c,moosecommander,6,Tue Jul 21 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"Plus his story is pretty complete, as far as movies go.  Personally, I want a TV show based on Lando's pre-rebellion schemes."

StarWars,3e1i5c,HDRed,4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:53 2015 UTC,It's pretty good. Nothing terrible about it and I personally loved the TV special they did with Vader recently.  With another season or two it will be just as good as the clone wars cartoon imo.
StarWars,3e1i5c,Daimon5hade,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"I thought it was ""ok."" During the first season. I didn't get much of a feel for it.  Now, this second season special they showed with Vader recently was the most badass thing I've seen in animation."
StarWars,3e1i5c,Greshloc,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:47 2015 UTC,It reminded me of the early seasons of the clone wars. It's very much aimed at kids. Still has some really cool references to concept art for the originals and if you've seen clone wars it kind of picks up were they left off.
StarWars,3e1i5c,HotforSega,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"They've got a comic out right now about just that, and it's great. Check it out when you can"
StarWars,3e1i5c,Snicker56,16,Tue Jul 21 14:08:06 2015 UTC,"Hold on, you DON'T want a Han Solo movie?    He already had a development arc from selfish scoundrel to caring team player in the original trilogy, you can't really go back earlier than that and have him grow in any useful way."
StarWars,3e1i5c,AnOnlineHandle,4,Tue Jul 21 12:26:45 2015 UTC,"I think he turned into a selfish scoundrel. He was more idealistic and noble when he was younger, certainly when he freed Chewie."
StarWars,3e1i5c,daria-darko,6,Tue Jul 21 12:57:26 2015 UTC,Is any of that freeing Chewie stuff even canon?
StarWars,3e1i5c,AnOnlineHandle,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:46 2015 UTC,Probably not :(
StarWars,3e1i5c,daria-darko,6,Tue Jul 21 13:17:07 2015 UTC,There's a 19 year gap between III and IV. That's a lot of time to explore.
StarWars,3e1i5c,OneFinalEffort,5,Tue Jul 21 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"tiny, tiny gap between Episode 3 and 4   20 years isn't exactly a tiny, tiny gap."
StarWars,3e1i5c,captainperoxide,7,Tue Jul 21 12:50:36 2015 UTC,"People just assume he stayed there for the entirety of that time, when if Disney wants that can be easily changed. The movies never stated he went into exile, only Yoda did.   Looking after Luke doesn't mean he had to stay there 24/7. He could have easily gotten involved into something and traveled for a while."
StarWars,3e1i5c,TheLieLlama,4,Tue Jul 21 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And hell, even if he did stay there, it wasn't like he just sat in his hut with a pair of binoculars keeping an eye on Luke. I'm sure he got into all sorts of adventures. Maybe some stormtroopers stumble across him, and he has to take them out stealth-mode before they can confirm he's alive. Maybe the Empire sends an assassin to kill him, a la Force Unleashed. Maybe he helps Jawas defend against marauding Sand People, I don't care. There's a million different things you could do with an open 20 years of Obi-Wan's life, whether he stays on Tatooine the whole time or not."

StarWars,3e1i5c,TheNintendo29,5,Tue Jul 21 14:05:48 2015 UTC,"While I mostly agree with you, that ""tiny gap"" is 19 years, more time than what we know Obi-Wan is up to.  There's only like 12 years across the whole PT and like 5 across the OT. There is more time we aren't aware of than what we are. Its not really a tiny, tiny gap at all."
StarWars,3e1i5c,darthkeagon,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"The only room there is a tiny, tiny gap between Episode 3 and 4, and we know he spent most of his time on Tatooine because Uncle Owen and Luke speak about him like he has been there for a while.   Still leaves that ""tiny gap"" to plot a movie in. You know that in some movies, the entire plot transpires over a single day, yes? Even a month is plenty of time for a fully fleshed out story."
StarWars,3e1i5c,LetsWorkTogether,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:06 2015 UTC,Why not have a Kenobi movie set between 2 and 3? Isn't everything outside of the movies non canon? So a new world could be made up that Kenobi gets stranded on during the clone wars.
StarWars,3e1i5c,Sanityzzz,3,Tue Jul 21 14:38:21 2015 UTC,That made me stupidly happy.
StarWars,3e1i5c,chriswearingred,8,Tue Jul 21 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, please. It could be very cool -- not just a desert action-type-thing, but a nice character study. Obi-Wan has seen some shit, and now he has to deal with the aftermath.   Plus, I'll watch almost anything Ewan is in, so there's that."
StarWars,3e1i5c,april_a,16,Tue Jul 21 13:20:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of a movie we just need a weekly TV drama. This would be Kung Fu with a lightsaber. Dude isn't looking for trouble. Trouble just finds him. He roams the country side doing odd jobs, helping people out, gathering supplies to live off of and making friends and enemies along the way as he sticks it to the man."
StarWars,3e1i5c,atducker,7,Tue Jul 21 11:37:54 2015 UTC,"Same here. It's about time Obi gets a movie where he's a main character, not a mentor trying to teach another young quickshot some sense."

StarWars,3e1i5c,wouldyoulikeanytoast,7,Tue Jul 21 11:28:34 2015 UTC,I'm sure one could come up with a lot of interesting stories that take place over the years he was exiled. I for one would love to see that.
StarWars,3e1i5c,oldwoodenship,8,Tue Jul 21 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"I've always imagined that there were plenty of times he almost got found out. I imagine that it took him years to come off as calm and collected as he did in Episode IV. The pain caused by what happens in Episode III would not be easy to overcome, even for a Jedi. A movie could easily be made with these themes."
StarWars,3e1i5c,theaveragenerd,6,Tue Jul 21 13:17:19 2015 UTC,Joel Edgerton played Owen in Revenge of the Sith. Get him to reprise the role of Owen for any Kenobi movie.
StarWars,3e1i5c,JuhisXD,11,Tue Jul 21 12:28:33 2015 UTC,Kyle Katarn spin-off would be perfect one too.

StarWars,3e1i5c,Taven,6,Tue Jul 21 12:19:32 2015 UTC,Who doesn't want a Salacious Crumb spin-off?
StarWars,3e1i5c,EDoftheDEAD,5,Tue Jul 21 13:24:24 2015 UTC,I remember a while back there was a rumour that Yoda would be getting a spin off film and it would be quite similar to Seven Samurai. If this was ever the case I'd prefer it if Yoda played more of a father figure role with a young Qui Gon Jin as a lead or even a young Mace Windu. They could find a young Obi Wan during the course of the story. I don't know but seeing Seven Samurai redone with Jedi would be pretty amazing.
StarWars,3e1i5c,SMB73,4,Tue Jul 21 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"The only spin-off I'm interested in. Don't get me wrong, I love Han and Boba, but this is the only story gap that I want to know about."

StarWars,3e1i5c,Player276,4,Tue Jul 21 15:47:36 2015 UTC,I feel like Obi Wan does not represent balance at all. He's probably the biggest Light side extremist there is.
StarWars,3e1i5c,BorkBjork,3,Tue Jul 21 13:08:13 2015 UTC,Maybe not a movie but a series of Obi-Wan's adventures between the third and fourth movies. Kinda like Samurai Jack but in the Star Wars universe. Protecting Luke without being seen and dispensing justice in the smaller scale of Tatooine.
StarWars,3e1i5c,expert02,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:40 2015 UTC,He looks like a Ghostbuster.

StarWars,3e1i5c,RogueLeaderJ,6,Tue Jul 21 10:43:54 2015 UTC,Nothing official.  AFAIK all we are getting atm is Boba Fett and Han Solo.
StarWars,3e1i5c,jtrot91,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:13 2015 UTC,When was Han announced? I thought they just said Rogue One and Boba Fett.
StarWars,3e1i5c,RogueLeaderJ,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:22 2015 UTC,A couple of weeks ago.  Here's you a link.

StarWars,3e1i5c,CommissarPenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"So, kinda like David Carradine's kung fu character?"
StarWars,3e1i5c,Kill_Welly,2,Tue Jul 21 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"I think that this could be a really good movie. It could be anything from a tale of personal discovery to a Western (I'm personally partial to another adaptation of the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven). But... it wouldn't be a good Star Wars movie. Obi-Wan never leaves Tatooine -- that right there rules out most space battles. He tries to avoid drawing attention from the Empire, so I don't think lightsaber duels are something we could plausibly see without really stretching plausibility. It would be missing most of what people want and expect from Star Wars, and as great as more of McGregor's Kenobi would be, I just don't think it's a good idea in practice."
StarWars,3e1i5c,AHMilling,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"Oh man i wish this comes true. Obi-wan is my favorite character, and Ewan did an amazing job.

StarWars,3e1i5c,jason_stanfield,3,Tue Jul 21 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"Y'know, if Obi Wan Kenobi was the main character in the prequel trilogies, the storytelling would have been much, much better. His was the most compelling story of any character in those films, but he wasn't the focus.  It's an even better story line than Anakin's, IMO. Kenobi starts out in training, loses his master and friend, is rushed to knighthood and forced to prove himself in a confusing war, fights to train a young adept against the better sense of the Jedi Council, predictably loses control of his student when he's turned to the Dark Side, then he has to nearly kill him before escaping the targeted genocide of all Jedi ... that's a great damn story. Not some bratty kid who misses his mommy and resents that he can't have a girlfriend.  Too bad ol' Ben wasn't the focus of Eps I-III. It could have been so awesome.  Fuck it.  Disney, you have my permission to declare Episodes I-III non-canon and create a new trilogy, even if they're not directly connected sequels (but rather universe-establishing films)."

StarWars,3dy17l,Nfc24,313,Mon Jul 20 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Back in 1982, how would you know? All you knew from Jedi back in the day was that (1.) they guarded peace in the galaxy, (2.) they were supposed stay calm when using Force, (4.) they were soldiers in the Clone Wars and (5.) they were later killed off by Vader and Emperor.   IIRC, back in 1995 Lucas was still planning on giving them military uniforms and making them some sort of elite soldiers before deciding they all dressed like hermited Obi-Wan in episode IV (which doesn't make sense, as it's pretty clear that Ben is dressed in traditional tatoonian clothes, as everybody else on the planet is dressed in the same way)."
StarWars,3dy17l,OWKuusinen,56,Mon Jul 20 15:44:32 2015 UTC,You forgot (3.) Yoda. He dressed just like Kenobi in Empire Strikes Back.   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back.png  Seems pretty clear what Lucas had in his mind as Jedi apparel back in 1982.   Here's a pic of Kenobi - same exact outfit as Yoda. http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Obi-Wan-Kenobi-Alec-Guinness-Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.jpg

StarWars,3dy17l,elljawa,28,Mon Jul 20 17:19:21 2015 UTC,yes they did - it was decided as far back as...Yoda...in empire strikes back. All Jedi (aside from Luke) that appear in the original trilogy have the same exact outfit.

StarWars,3dy17l,emmonster,25,Mon Jul 20 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"Well, if Obi-Wan wanted to hide Luke from the Sith, then why did he keep his surname, Skywalker? I think that's a way bigger plothole. The only reason Vader was looking for his son in The Empire Strikes Back was because he heard a kid named Skywalker blew up the Death Star, and he felt a connection to a Rebel pilot during the Battle over Yavin. Obi-Wan really isn't that good at his job."
StarWars,3dy17l,Sommern,14,Mon Jul 20 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"Then again, maybe vader thought it was unlikely he had a living kid that lived with his family"

StarWars,3dy17l,Nfc24,8,Tue Jul 21 05:45:21 2015 UTC,IIRC Lucas himself has said he changed the title because revenge was not befitting of the Jedi.
StarWars,3dy17l,The_MAZZTer,4,Mon Jul 20 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, as Lucas' idea what actually happens in the film got clearer.  Back when he originally decided the name was REVENGE he might well have thought that Luke would cut the Emperor/somebody else.  (Also remember that the original film states that the Emperor was just a Japanese-style puppet ruler, with his cabinet holding him as half-willing hostage. Tarkin, Vader and perhaps somebody else would have been the ""true evil"".)"
StarWars,3dy17l,OWKuusinen,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I did not know that, thanks. I recently rewatched ANH and the only place the Emperor is mentioned is in the dissolution of the Senate."
StarWars,3dy17l,The_MAZZTer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:26:26 2015 UTC,"The novelization (written by Lucas, actually ghostwritten by Foster) and based on the script had:    Aided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic. He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic. Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor, shutting himself away from the populace. Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot-lickers he had appointed to high office, and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears.[16]    This was supposed to be in the crawling opening, but it was apparently cut at the last moment. I might be wrong, though."
StarWars,3dy17l,OWKuusinen,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"Based on the movie and Lukes actions, I'd say Revenge is definitely the wrong word, everything he did was to reconcile with Vader not exact revenge on him."
StarWars,3dy17l,postapocalive,4,Mon Jul 20 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah they just wanted to make the Jedi seem like the good guy archetype. I would have liked Revenge of the Jedi better because it would have shown the Jedi as a ""clan"" also had flaws and were human(and non-human).  Jedi & Sith seem like minor evils in themselves because they are so powerful, but obviously the Jedi is the lesser of the two evils... But by no means should the jedi be ""100% Lawful Good"" as that simply doesn't exist."
StarWars,3dy17l,john-b,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:57 2015 UTC,I wonder why Luke has the black jumpsuit in RotJ then?
StarWars,3dy17l,flare2000x,12,Mon Jul 20 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to write an essay, but I believe the idea was to show how Luke (who was half-trained and in danger of turning to dark side in the previous film) was now ever closer to that fate. After all, we are introduced to him at Jabba's palace, he repeats Emperor's and Vader's mannerism, even uses Force to choke IIRC.    Later on he drops the cape and gains that (blue?) thingy on top, which makes him look very military and professional. I believe this was the look which Lucas believed all Jedi were supposed to have ""when at work"". But of course, at this point this all turns into fanwanking."

In fact if you look at Luke and Uncle Owen from A New Hope, Owen has three layers on while Ben only has two, and Owen's pants and boots don't match Obi-Wan's. And Luke is missing the brownish bottom layer shirt that Ben/Obi-Wan wears.  Basically, I think it's evident that while tatoonian clothes are in fact quite similar, the Jedi uniform is a bit more precise and specialized."
StarWars,3dy17l,Justinon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"I quite like the idea someone else posted on this sub a while back that suggested that Jedi intentionally wore common rural clothing as a part of their monastic tradition.

One explanation given is that the title was originally ""Return"", not ""Revenge"". After Kasdan convinced Lucas that ""Revenge"" would be more exciting, Lucas changed the title, only to change it back at a later date after realizing deciding that ""Return"" remained a better title."

The fans spent a lot of time trying to guess the names. I remember people had pretty good record for the second and third one.   It also helped that the films apparently channelled the naming conventions of old B-flicks.    1st 2nd 3rd    A New Hope Phantom Menance Force Awakens   The Empire Strikes Back Attack of the Clones ???   Return of the Jedi Revange of the Sith ???

Rogue one is about the Rebels stealing the Death Star plans, and the other two films will be origin stories for Han Solo and Boba Fett.  And of course, on top of that, there's the Holiday Special, Caravan of Courage, The Battle for Endor, and The Clone Wars.  Edit: What I'm really excited about is that all the new books are officially canon. I never considered any of the old books or video games canon, but more like an alternate universe, and they were never officially 100% canon due to how Lucas had different levels."

Anakin, however, definitely returns and maybe revenges against Palpatine more than a little bit.  It seems inconsistent and incredible to say Luke went to the dark side when we was goaded into protecting his sister from the idea of Vader corrupting her, while moments later, the Sith Lord Vader/Anakin, actually seeing his son being tortured to death, was purely on the light side when he destroyed the Emperor. He could have used the Dark Side to kill old Palpy and then switched to the light side after he felt the rush of finally being free of the Sith who had manipulated him for decades."

StarWars,3e37wu,InvisibleChains,13,Tue Jul 21 16:46:09 2015 UTC,Darth Sidious changed the way the Sith ran by creating the Rule of One.   You're thinking of Darth Krayt.  Sidious followed the Rule of Two.   He obviously didn't want there to be someone that would come to rival his skill.    Sidious explicitly stated to Yoda that Vader would become more powerful than either of them.  This was before the battle with Obi-Wan.  Sidious' plan was essentially that of Darth Bane.  Quasi-immortality was a fall black plan in case he couldn't find anyone more powerful than himself.  Bane only pursued the whole body switching thing because he didn't think his apprentice was strong enough to kill him.
StarWars,3e37wu,jandhyde,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Sidious followed the Rule of Two.   Are you sure that he did, though? Plagueis and Sidious worked so hard together to achieve immortality, so I don't really think that Palpy had any intention of honoring the Rule of Two and teaching Vader/Maul/Dooku enough to overthrow him. I know that Vader said that overthrowing the Emperor was his plan if Luke would turn to the Dark Side, but I don't think that Palpatine would've lost to Vader one on one."
StarWars,3e37wu,aatencio91,6,Tue Jul 21 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that he did, though?   Well, ya.  http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Palpatine   so I don't really think that Palpy had any intention of honoring the Rule of Two   He needed someone more powerful than him to do this, just like Bane.  Post E3 Vader wasn't more powerful than him.  Luke had the potential, Vader did not.  Dooku did not.   I don't think that Palpatine would've lost to Vader one on one.   This isn't just your opinion, this is canon."
StarWars,3e37wu,jandhyde,0,Tue Jul 21 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point. Yes, he had an apprentice at all times, so yes, there were two of them, but I doubt that Palpatine had any intention of ever divulging all of his secrets like he was supposed to. His goal was immortality so he'd have absolutely no motivation to train anyone to eventually kill him.  Yes, everything points to Palpatine following the Rule of Two on the surface (""Vader will become more powerful than either of us,"" ""kill your dad to become my new apprentice,"" etc), but if you look into Palpatine a little deeper, he has no reason whatsoever to willingly train someone on how to kill him, thus keeping him from his goal of immortality.  I think that Palpy broke the Rule of Two to an extent. He didn't tell Maul, Dooku, or Vader all of his secrets, it seems."
StarWars,3e37wu,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"He didn't tell Maul, Dooku, or Vader all of his secrets, it seems.   None of them were ever powerful enough to replace him.  Why would he tell them all his secrets?"
StarWars,3e37wu,jandhyde,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"The point of the Rule of Two is to teach the apprentice all that you can, and the apprentice is deemed ""not powerful enough"" when s/he tries to assassinate the master. If the apprentice succeeds, s/he's worthy of becoming the master. If not, s/he's not worthy of being a Sith at all and will be disposed of.  What the master teaches the apprentice isn't supposed to be at the master's discretion. The master should teach the apprentice everything, and the apprentice is the one who eventually proves himself or herself ""powerful enough."""
StarWars,3e37wu,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"So the argument rests on ""Sidious didn't teach all of his apprentices everything he knew even though he knew one had no intention of usurping him, another was just a pawn to get to Anakin, and another was a shadow of his former self?"""
StarWars,3e37wu,jandhyde,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"... No. The entire argument is that Sidious wanted immortality and therefore decided not to empower any of his three apprentices with the knowledge of how to stop him.  He resented Maul and never taught him many things. Maul was essentially a henchman and an assassin.  Dooku was extremely powerful (a former Jedi Master), and was instrumental in executing Palpatine's overall plan. Palpatine knew how powerful Dooku could be so he kept some information from him (Plagueis' immortality secrets, for example).  Vader could have been the most powerful Force user ever, had he not been maimed and constricted to his suit. The suit provided some limitations (no Force lightning, somewhat lumbering movement, etc) but Vader's mind was still as strongly connected with the Force as anyone's ever was, and Palpatine knew this better than anyone. Palpatine didn't want to be killed and he knew that Vader was the one person in the galaxy that could do it, so he kept information from Vader to try to keep him down.  It's all about Palpatine being selfish and greedy. It's not ""ah, Maul/Dooku/Vader isn't worthy so I won't teach them,"" it's ""They'll eventually kill me so I'm going to keep some things secret so I always have a trick up my sleeve because I don't plan on ever dying."""

StarWars,3e37wu,jandhyde,4,Tue Jul 21 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing about Darth Vader is the amount of new information that is coming out about his journey after Revenge of the Sith until the events in Return of the Jedi. They released Orientation/Lords of the Sith/Tarkin written stories to get a view of him 5 years after Empire Day, they released Rebels TV show to get a view of him 14/15 years after Empire Day, and they released Star Wars/Darth Vader comics to get a view of him 19/20 years after Empire Day.  I am curious what new things they will reveal about in in the future. He definitely channels the dark side, and has learned Sith knowledge, but they have been very picky at what he was taught."
StarWars,3e37wu,Sapitoelgato,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think Vader was a Sith. Keep in mind Sith was more of a religion to them. Count Dooku ( in my oppinion) was more of a dark,Jedi. I don't think him and palps agreed on a lot. About sidious he was afraid of loosing his control do,i probably did hold a bit back from Vader, but Vader was naturally strong and probably learned many tricks anyway."

There was also a brief time when the movie was officially called Return to Kashyyyykkk: Life Day 2, but LucasFilm will not confirm or deny that fact."

He gets a creative consultant credit, and I'm sure JJ and others call him with basic questions about the universe, but he has no say in things like story.  Supposedly, he gave Kennedy and Disney outlines for the new trilogy that they elected not to use after Michael Arndt (the first writer hired for VII) left and Lawrence Kasdan (current co-writer with JJ; also wrote ESB after Leigh Brackett's death and co-wrote ROTJ with Lucas) was brought in.  Personally, I think they're still mostly sticking to the overall outline Lucas gave them story-wise, but a lot of specifics are going to be very different (such as the level of involvement the OT cast has, the ages of the new main cast members, etc)."

(He really is thrown for a loop by a droid claiming to be owned by him.) Then you need to realize the ubiquity of droids. Sure, he knows Anakin had an R2 unit. Or was it an R3? R1 maybe?  Who remembers, it's been 20 years. And then, even if he thinks about Anakin having an astromech, what are the odds of this astromech being the one he had? Do you remember your best friend's car from 20 years ago? Now someone walks up with a car that might be the same model as it and says it belongs to you.

StarWars,3dy69i,Khajitoverlord,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:12 2015 UTC,I was there...
StarWars,3dy69i,tubachris85x,4,Mon Jul 20 15:09:42 2015 UTC,me too...hot as hell.
StarWars,3dy69i,jcrave,6,Mon Jul 20 16:04:44 2015 UTC,I was wearing my snowtrooper
StarWars,3dy69i,tubachris85x,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Seriously, how did you not die of heat stroke?"
StarWars,3dy69i,SithLord13,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"It was brutal. I've been trooping in it for about 6 years now, though I used to tolerate it better than I did yesterday, having worn it in 115 degrees once. They gave us a nice staging room with good A/C yesterday, so I spent the better part of the day in there after"
StarWars,3dy69i,tubachris85x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:26 2015 UTC,Unbelievably hot. Spent the entire game at the Captains Cove bar so I could stay in the shade.

StarWars,3dxj7k,Steebles1908,6,Mon Jul 20 10:31:30 2015 UTC,What are the weird brick colored pieces supposed to be?
StarWars,3dxj7k,roto_disc,5,Mon Jul 20 15:39:41 2015 UTC,If I had to guess I'd say asteroids. I hope OP has an answer though.
StarWars,3dxj7k,SithLord13,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:25 2015 UTC,Yeah - I'm confused too. Brown clouds maybe? Floating Sandcrawlers?
StarWars,3dxj7k,HawkeyeHero,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Hahahahhahah.  I really hope they're floating Sandcrawlers.  You've given me my first and probably only actual laugh out loud from the internet today.  Thanks, friend."

It's coming, whether we are ready or not. We hope we're ready.   And I guess it may not be all we hope for, but we'll be damn proud of it regardless."
StarWars,3dx3tp,RemnantEvil,22,Mon Jul 20 10:43:10 2015 UTC,God damn what an analogy.   I fuckin love Star Wars man
StarWars,3dx3tp,drax117,-14,Mon Jul 20 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the sentiment, but the prequels have shown that we will not be proud regardless. I suspect that TFA will be considered to be better than the prequels, and that alone is enough to get it a positive fan view, but if it is somehow bad we will never hear the end of it."

StarWars,3dx3tp,Do1Lar,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"Because I really like these movies. I am absolutely in love with this universe. But I'm not going to start personifying these movies. They are just works of art to be cherished. That's all. They aren't ""like my family""."

A subreddit basically made to laugh at others so we can all feel better about ourselves... this IS a Star Wars sub this is the last place anyone should be making fun of anyone...."
StarWars,3dx3tp,AllEyezOnMoney,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:15:16 2015 UTC,Eh. I don't browse cringe. But it is what I physically did when I read this post. I seriously just think its kind of stupid to compare star wars to your family. its basically attempting to start a circlejerk about how amazing the series is.
StarWars,3dx3tp,fistkick18,3,Tue Jul 21 02:24:03 2015 UTC,"""What I physically did when I read the post""  I admit thats kind of hilarious. But the funny thing is this post looks at the prequels in positive light and of course the extremely pessimistic part of the Star Wars Fandom that I absolutely hate comes out to tear that down which is incredibly played out I  my opinion regardless of their flaws. (oviously not talking about you)"
StarWars,3dx3tp,AllEyezOnMoney,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:57 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I do think it is the same type of people that are obsessed to their core with Star Wars that hate the prequels though. It's just a different viewpoint. I don't get the hate either. RotS is my second favorite after ESB.
StarWars,3dx3tp,fistkick18,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"They're not just movies.  They're art, man.  D:  But seriously, fiction has this power to really touch people in weird ways and I think it's pretty cool.  I get really wrapped up in things I like and I get this guy.  Just not quite as openly gushy about it."
