whatsthisbug,3e2uw9,Benito_Mussolini,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, there's still some active debate over how to exactly define this, but one of the most clear distinctions is that butterflies form the monophyletic suborder Rhopalocera - it includes three superfamilies of Lepidopterans (the order that encompasses all moths and butterflies), all descendants of one common ancestor where the taxon begins.  They have some shared traits, like being day fliers and having clubbed antennae. The way they fold their wings can often be an indicator too - these can be good rules of thumb, but I guarantee that there's some moth that also possesses one or more of any of these traits.  The reason for that is simply that Lepidopterans are crazy diverse, and the majority are moths - only the aforementioned three of more than twenty superfamilies are butterflies. Their relatively small numbers leads to a hypothesis that they probably just evolved from moths.  TL;DR butterflies are just a small group of specialized moths"

whatsthisbug,3e2uw9,gantzphere,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:19 2015 UTC,My limited understanding (and I expect to be corrected if I'm wrong) is that butterlies create a chrysalis rather than a silk cocoon and that butterflies tend to be active during the day while moths are more active at night.

It doesn't look like anything I could find when I searched.  http://imgur.com/Dc7cjqc,HgbvEi7#1  http://imgur.com/Dc7cjqc,HgbvEi7#0  the first one was about half the size of a ladybug but the one pictured was even smaller. They both seem to have stripes but the first one seemed to be brown and whiteish or beige stripes and this one seemed to have grey and white."
whatsthisbug,3e33hq,MrRoarke,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely NOT a Bed Bug, although there's not enough detail to say what it is. It has features of a Carpet Beetle, how does this compare? Can you take some more pics?"
whatsthisbug,3dy8oz,FemaleFingers,30,Mon Jul 20 14:46:17 2015 UTC,Definitely a Japanese beetle. Check your local garden store or home improvement store. There are a variety of remedies. If you're looking to go Chemical free they make a trap that will be much more attractive than your pea plants.
whatsthisbug,3dy8oz,CrosbingtonAugustus,27,Mon Jul 20 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"Don't set out any sort of traps!!! They commonly use phermones to attract the beetles and will cause these suckers to aggregate from miles away to your garden!   Best thing to do is spray your plants (and soil, because the juveniles live in there) with some sort of compound that will deter them from your plants, while still allowing them to grow."
whatsthisbug,3dy8oz,superscarf,31,Mon Jul 20 16:44:33 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. I used napalm so no need for traps or sprays. It did dramatically reduce the yield from my garden. Buyer beware.

whatsthisbug,3dy8oz,conductive,14,Mon Jul 20 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Seconding the recommendation to avoid traps. When Japanese beetles feed, they release pheromones that basically say, ""Hey guys--free buffet here!"", and that does draw more beetles...but not as many as traps constantly broadcasting, ""HEY GUYS! FREE BUFFET AND SEXY LADIES HERE!"" I won't use toxic sprays, and the adult beetles are tough to kill anyway, but in good news, they do congregate to destroy plants, so it's easy to knock groups of them off your plants and into a bucket of soapy water, especially if it's cool (morning or evening) because they're kind of slow and clumsy to begin with, and more so when they're a bit chilled.   Don't head off to the local nasty pesticide store quite yet; you may or may not have grubs/pupae in the ground. Having adult beetles doesn't mean anything, really; if this is the first time you've encountered them, you may not yet have them in the soil. Adults will fly a long way for food, and once they find a good free buffet, they'll almost certainly breed, and deposit eggs, but I'd try milky spore before anything else. It's good at killing grubs (applied at the right time of season), but won't harm your worms and other good guys. Look for Japanese beetle control for your specific state or one nearby to see when it's best to apply whatever control method you choose."

whatsthisbug,3dy8oz,brewdude666,9,Tue Jul 21 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"To repeat: DO NOT SET OUT TRAPS!  The traps were originally intended to track Japanese beetle migration and were never intended for eradication.  The best way to deal with them is to go out in the morning and pick them off the leaves and then toss them into a bucket of soapy water. Most sprays can have an effect on beneficial insects (albeit small) so they are only recommended if you have a significant beetle problem.   BUT, if you have a lot of beetles congregating, then it's time to spray. Insecticidal soap will kill the visible beetles (if you directly spray them) but will do nothing for prevention. Neem oil works great for prevention. Spray it every week or so and your beetle problem will start to go away. I buy the concentrate stuff and just mix one capful (about one Tablespoon) per 32 ounce bottle and spray the hell out of the leaves. You want to spray the underside too.   Neem oil can affect honeybees, which is why it should be used as a last resort. The bees will take the neem oil back to the hive and feed it to the brood which could kill the hive. I've read a bunch on this and typically neem only really affects small or weak hives and you have to spray the flowers pretty heavily in order to really cause problems for bees..   If they are really bad, look up how to kill Japanese beetle grubs and deal with them that way."

It takes a couple years to get the inoculation going but after that you won't have trouble anymore. Also if you don't have lots of close neighbors the traps are pretty effective when used in conjunction with insecticidal soap. Definitely a hassle no matter how you look at it.  If you do have close neighbors then you're pretty much down to the soap and physically removing them. I usually kill them with my garden shears when I'm deadheading flowers or harvesting.

Take this with a big grain of salt, but from the scale of the mosses and lichens I see growing on the bark, and the scale of barks in tropical climates generally (plants grow faster, therefore thick/brittle bark is selected against), I would estimate this is about 2-2.5 cm wide (about an inch, maybe a bit more than that), and about the body looks to be the same length.  So not small, for what it is, but not monstrous. I've seen insects like this- I mostly thought they were some kind of mayfly when I was there.

Some people recommend insecticidal soaps, but I've heard others get away with just small amounts of dish soap and water. I'm no gardener, so my only advice is to do some research there.  I can't speak for everyone, but I think what really gets us is when people kill bugs before even questioning it. Oftentimes they are predators keeping pests at bay and killing them really only makes your life harder.  I get that there's a strong cultural aversion to bugs and people do it out of fear/instinct, but it's not something that can't be overcome, especially if they are curious enough to post it here after the fact.

whatsthisbug,3dvpbd,Joseph_P_Brenner,2,Mon Jul 20 10:11:10 2015 UTC,"I don't!  E. osculans LeConte is quite enigmatic.  There is actually a subgenus of Eleodes, Tricheleodes which means 'Hairy Eleodes' - and there are at least 7 species with fairly long hair covering their bodies.  In general these species are found in sand dunes or at least in very sand subtrate environments, where the hair presumably helps them navigate through the sand or helps hold the soil to their body for crypsis (or some combination thereof).  My current molecular work places E. osculans in a group of hairy Eleodes which occur along the coastlines of California and Baja California.  Perhaps that is the habitat that they originated in?  But E. osculans certainly is abundant in pine forests above San Diego, where there isn't much sand."
whatsthisbug,3dvpbd,Sanluen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:17:31 2015 UTC,"Also, are you knowledgeable about Zopherini?  At one point, they were considered tenebrionids!  I had an isolated population of Phloeodes diabolicus in the backyard of my childhood LA home, seemingly emanating from the base of a live acacia tree, and I was perpetually concerned that my population of ironclads would one day be wiped out given how geographically tiny their home was.  Their biology was and is a still a complete mystery to me."
whatsthisbug,3dvpbd,Joseph_P_Brenner,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Most zopherids are found in dead wood, but I think I heard that Phleodes might actually bore into sound wood?  Anyway, as far as a small population - it is likely that the larvae were coming from the base of that tree (perhaps feeding on some burried wood or mulch?) and so that is where you saw them.  I have never actually seen a zopherid moving in the wild, but they certainly do.  I have walked down a hard-packed dirt road, and walked abcka nd there was one right in the middle (not moving) - so it got there somehow while I was gone.  Don't underestimate their dispersal abilities!  Also, flightless beetles seem to have very local abundance.  It is a mystery when you think about gene flow and dispersal across landscapes, but seems to work for them.  They seem to be robust to things like founders effect that Humans get in trouble with.  I have a colony of Ulomoides dermestioides which was started from asingle female and 2 males.  It has gone on through at least 50 generations, and other lab colonies like it have gone on for thousands.  No signs of a problem."

These guys are also robust against insect pins lol; many were bent over a single specimen in my collection!  These guys were also able to withstand the weight of a small child (i.e. me in elementary school)!  I've read that one of the factors contributing to honeybee colony collapse disorder is the lack of genetic diversity.  Maybe these beetles are specifically resistant to such things."

They also apparently can spray a chemical if they feel threatened, which can be painful if it makes contact with the eyes :( ; so, just in case, I would stay back until you can find a pair of goggles.  Although, if the spray does happen to get in your eyes, it won't cause any long-term damage :) ; but it is suggested that you seek medical attention : https://bugmastermobile.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/caution-poison-spitting-insect-two-striped-walking-sticks/  I hope that this information helps! :)"

whatsthisbug,3dlap2,SistaSabuda,2,Fri Jul 17 05:28:31 2015 UTC,Something bit me and then saw a little bug crawling towards head of bed.  Took apart bed.. could not find a thing.  Used cimexa around bed and found these little dead bugs.  It possibly could have been the bug I saw.  Do they bite??  I have found a few random bites on my body the past few weeks.
whatsthisbug,3dkm9z,linkintiara,4,Fri Jul 17 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"Probably an assassin bug of some sort. I am unsure of which kinds y'all have got over in Singapore.  I'll update if I'm able to narrow it down at all, but it's unlikely."
whatsthisbug,3dkm9z,tyrannoAdjudica,2,Fri Jul 17 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to cause alarm, /u/linkintiara; but I would suggest that your friend should possibly keep an eye on his/her bite :(    I'm not an expert, but apparently (if it is an Assassin Bug) the saliva of the Assassin Bug can cause an allergic reaction in some people. This involves itching, swelling, and can even involve anaphylactic shock.   Also, there is a type of Assassin bug, known as Triatominae or the Kissing Bug: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatominae and http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/, can carry a parasite that causes Chagas Disease: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/ .  However, while this happens in the Mexico and United States, it is relatively rare (especially in the United States); and I don't know whether or not Assassin bugs in Singapore can carry Chagas, so you likely don't have to worry about that :)  Anyhow, I would possibly suggest that your friend take an antihistamine if he/she feels that they should.  Also, here is an article about a type of Assassin Bug that is more common in Singapore :) : http://intothewildsingapore.blogspot.ca/2010/07/blog-post_5819.html  I hope that this information helps! :) And best wishes to you and your friend!"
whatsthisbug,3dkm9z,AquaSeerPerspectiva,3,Fri Jul 17 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"I am no expert on assassin bugs, but in my opinion the antennae didn't match that of a Triatomine, so I did not see fit to give the same warning.  OP's post mentions extreme pain as well, and Chagas disease is transmitted via contact with fecal matter if I understand correctly, so the chances of transmission are low.  I also think they tend to bite people in their sleep.  As for the effects of assassin bug saliva / nasty cocktail of digestive enzymes, absolutely tell your friend to disinfect that bite. Even without the other nasty effects, any bite can become much more complicated by infection."
whatsthisbug,3dkm9z,tyrannoAdjudica,3,Fri Jul 17 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I noticed that the antennae were shorter, too. :(  I know that it is more likely for a person to develop an allergic reaction to an Assassin Bug's bite rather than Chagas Disease; however, I thought that OP should know, just in case. :)  And I knew that Kissing Bugs tended to bite people in their sleep; but I didn't know that fecal matter played a role in the transmission of Chagas Disease! :) Good to know!  Thank you for the information, /u/tyrannoAdjudica!"

whatsthisbug,3dkm9z,AquaSeerPerspectiva,2,Fri Jul 17 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"You are very welcome, OP! :)    Your friend will hopefully be alright :) ; but I would disinfect the bite as /u/tyrannoAdjudica suggested; and possibly have him take an antihistamine as well, in case.    Also, if he develops any symptoms of an allergic reaction, I would suggest seeking medical attention.  Best of luck (and health) to you both! :)"
