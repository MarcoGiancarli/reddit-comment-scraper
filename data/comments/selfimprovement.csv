You wake up, ignore any tiredness or bad feelings and repeat to yourself you're going to seize the day. Tell yourself you slept amazingly and you feel great! Compliment yourself. Say it out loud if that's what it takes for your brain to believe it!   Then you just set a quick morning plan in your head that doesn't accommodate for checking your phone for an hour, e.g up, straight into the shower, get ready, straight to the kitchen to cook breakfast and off you go kind of thing. You just have to do it no nonsense and no excuses. It all starts with your thoughts. You have to banish any negative thoughts, which are probably second nature at this point and replace them with the positive driven thoughts :)"

The diet advice is outdated in my opinion (written in the fat-fearing 70s, he advises against avocados) and gets into other topics such as seasonal acupuncture (wasn't really applicable to me again).   Having said that, I think it does a really good job of stressing seasonal rotation of diets, seasonal exercises, attitude, energy levels, etc. The way you may behave in Winter will be different than Summer and the food required will be different.   It's kind of an East meets West kind of book as it relies heavily on Eastern homeopathic tradition combined with some of the science of the West.

After thinking about it for a while, I realized that I only played video games to pass the time. It sounds simplistic, and your reasoning may be different, but I think most people play video games for that reason. There are two things I would suggest.   1.) Think about how you could better spend your time. Playing video games really earns you no skills and it takes up the time you could use to do something productive. Consider how your life would be different if you put all that time toward something that would have a more positive impact on your life.   2.) Slowly drop the video games in favor of what you have decided as a more productive activity. It doesn't have to be all at once either. Maybe an hour less for a couple weeks, and then another hour less etc. After that time, you should be able to recognize some kind of difference or progress in the skill that you are developing and it wiill motivate you.

selfimprovement,3dzgq8,Bad_White_Shark,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Adjective - Name - Title trick is what I tend to use.  The trick I use is to get to know the person a little and tack on a title as soon as I get to know them. I usually include conversation starters as a way to describe them like ""Where are you from?"" would lead to ""Joe from Missouri"", but these titles get really generic, so I tend to couple them with descriptive features.  Let's say Joe is wearing a suit, or had slicked back hair, or is really tall, or smells nice. You can add something to remind you of the name. ""Fancy Joe from Missouri"" or ""Cool Hair Joe from Missouri"", or ""Tall Joe from Missouri"". Remember to stray away from embarrassing features so that you don't accidentally call them out on it.  It helps you recall your first encounter with the person, and it'll help them remember you as well.  I used this trick to remember about 50-100 names at a campus club during its first meeting. Something as simple as having someone remember your name in a crowded setting can feel so inviting -- it usually wins them over and brings them back.  Also, as someone else has already pointed out, repeating their name at the END of the conversation is a great way to remember their name and have them appreciate you as a listener."

Personally, I like to be in the middle of multiple long books at one time: right now I'm reading the second book in Mary Stuart's Merlin series as well as Ancient Mesoamerica Revealed. I think one to one is a fine ratio, especially when so many classic fiction books have inspired millions over the years.

You'll have to filter to find the ""useful"" parts.  IMO, it helps if your role models are dead and have written a lot. I wouldn't expect a current celebrity to merit that status, as they're usually good at being famous and not much else.   What is the line between worship and having someone as inspiration?   Well, many people throughout history have said useful things and you can learn from them. Or did some things that can serve as a useful example.

She had a really hard time making friends (I was living across the country), and she really wanted some friends in her area. She did end up meeting a couple of people she liked hanging out with. But one of the girls was really abraisive and sarcastic, and the other girl was, bluntly, very ignorant. I asked at one point ""Wow, they don't seem like the type of people you'd be friends with,"" and my friend said ""I can learn to appreciate people for who they are, and find the things I really like about them, and not be too harsh about the rest. We all have flaws. They don't look too closely at mine, so I won't look too closely at theirs.   This really helped me. We absolutely do not have to love everything about a person in order to feel inspired by them.   But there may be lines, and that is totally up to you to decide. For example, I used to really love Bill Cosby as a kid, but now that all of these rape allegations have come to light, with Cosby admitting he drugged women for the purpose of making them pass out so he could have sex with them, I can't look up to him anymore. There may come a time when I can listen to his stand-up or watch his old TV show, and separate my feelings for the person from the character, but right now, I don't want to see his stuff. So for me, that's a line I don't want to cross in feeling admiration for a person - I lost a lot of respect for Bill Cosby, and it was too much for me to like his material.     But now the comedian Jimmy Carr, he has said a lot of things in his act that have made me gasp in horror, and have even upset me a little, but I LOVE that about him. Years ago it was discovered that he hadn't paid some taxes. But to me, that doesn't bother me and I love his comedy that offends me while making me laugh at the same time. He inspires me to push the envelope.     All that is to say it's a matter of what YOUR values are, and what is important to YOU.   Some people think Kim Kardashian is a shallow, empty-headed bimbo who only got famous for shallow, stupid reasons. Other people are inspired by her ruthless self-promotion and embodiment of a certain kind of lifestyle. Others find her inspiring and tacky at the same time.

For instance somebody will see Schwarzenegger as a role model for his ability to workout, but why he should listen if he is giving relationship advice? That's the difference between worshiping blindly somebody and selectively gathering information from the persons extraordinary abilities.   Role models in general reached high accomplishments in an area that you would like to improve. But why do you want to like everything about him if you can't?

In some metrics I score as one person in 6 or 10 trillion people, more than 7 standard deviation from the norm, most notably for stress. There is no chance for empathy, and seeking it is detrimental to my conscience as I know the cost for other to try. No one has heard of this before. There are no precedents. I find help in the most unlikely of places, on the order of synchonistic 'magic', and virtually in no other way. But I have to try, yes? If I give up hope, I might as well check out. Dancing helps, so I'm studying Ballroom. But there's a sacrifice to my survival in that, and dancing, expressing joy for life, is incompatible with mere survival. Tough road. I'm a really nice guy, and hopeful, so I have to believe a remedy exists. But I can't get close to people, because my mind is too wide and I inadvertently drive others insane, literally. The only woman I ever loved, loved me back, bit had to flee for her sanity, because she began to empathize with me. It's the life of a monk, or Jedi Master, but not by choice. There's magic in the world, and accessible to me, but not enough to make the difference I need, not without the conscious cooperation other people.

So maybe this is a case where you have to be your own medicine man, and as you said, continue to be a nice guy, hopeful, and believe that a remedy exists. Keep seeking, as long as it is not detrimental to your sense of well-being. And you DO seem very aware of what might be detrimental, and that's a big step.    This is a long shot, and NOT a recommendation. But have you ever tried medicinal marijuana? For some people, like myself, it can mellow us out, slow our minds down, and relax us. But for your condition, I have no idea what it would do to you, and I'd only do it if it's medically legal in your state, and under the advice and care of a physician.

Take the shitty parts of yourself and replace them with things that you actually would like to have.   I was so fucked up I couldn't socialize with girls or had any friends. That was 4 ago. And I was like you, seeing the world as it is, just without any colors.   But I started to learn about socializing, how to make friends and maintain them, which was very unnatural at first, but by putting way better information into oneself, it gives you new results. It changes your perspective on things. My advice would be, to realize that everyone can change if they really want it. I did everything to get some friends and girlfriends, I went from a social retard to adept social person. But changes that you want to get requires massive action, and if you don't feel like doing that, maybe you really not want that, maybe it's the ego talking.   And guess what, I still don't feel satisfied. That's life. Even if you get everything what you want, there will be something else that will catch you attention. The main difference will be that you will have more opportunities, new people to choose to interact with.

""She needs to know that she did a bad thing thing!"") are just mental events. Just because you have these thoughts and emotions doesn't mean you have to act on them. Do a quick little meditation, maybe five minutes of just breathing, focusing on the breathing, and observing your emotions. Don't judge the emotions, don't try to fix them, just notice them.   Doing these two things can give you some distance and perspective on what's going on inside your head. It helps you take yourself a little less seriously in the moment, and might help you stop caring so much about something that doesn't really matter.  Hope that helps."

It's a lot less satisfying to just let it go, but that is the right thing to do. There is a little word lurking in the back of your mind, and that word is ""should"". She should have told you she was there. She should have told you she was leaving. She should have done things in a polite way. She should have at least texted. You have a little list of ""shoulds"" and you want to make sure she knows what you think she ""should"" have done. But in the end, those things don't matter.   You have done what you can do. You made the decisions you needed to make. That's great! Move along. How can you use this situation to be KIND rather than needing to be right?"

selfimprovement,3dl6m7,dolphinesque,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I understand, I think.   It helps me (at times) to see my ego as a separate entity, and one that does not have my best interests at heart.    True and I am going to be nice next time I see her.     This sounds like the real you, and I think it's awesome. That's the real human inside, who may be a little disappointed, but has the humanity and empathy to know that sometimes things don't work out, and you can still be nice to people. It made me really happy to read that.   But ego is really seductive. It's that voice that says ""But you deserve an answer! You're a nice guy and you shouldn't be treated that way. She should have at least texted you. She's such a bitch to do that to you. If only she knew what she did, and what she's now missing out on, she'd really regret it! It would feel so awesome to tell her off and see the look on her face."" Maybe not those exact words, but that ego voice is the voice telling you ""It's the principal of the thing!""   Part of your desire to know the answer may come from the desire to overcome her objections. If you just knew the reason, then you might feel inclined to make changes so that it would work. Or worse - you'll think ""She's wrong about me. I need to explain that her feelings about me are wrong, so that she'll like me again."" That stems back to the need to be ""right"", which is all ego.   I will say that letting go of my ego continues to be one of the hardest things I struggle with. When it comes to letting go, I meditate, I try to keep my mind off of things I shouldn't be dwelling on, and I just try to make progress every day on focusing on being kind.   Good luck."
selfimprovement,3djve9,orphan26,7,Thu Jul 16 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I am so sorry for all you've been through, and for dealing with cancer, and for losing friends whom you've helped so much.   You sound like me - a giver.   Here's the problem with being a giver. There are ALWAYS takers. There are ALWAYS people in crisis. And if you gave once, they will come to you again and again like you are a well of water and they have never had a drink.   If you really look, you can see a pattern. They are sweet, friendly, often charming people who just can't seem to catch a break. You know in your heart that if you can just help them out a little, that will be exactly what they need to get back on track. You don't even really notice how all of the conversations seem to center around them and their troubles, because you can tell they are in crisis and need help, and you're willing to set your needs aside until they get it together, and then you can enjoy the friendship you want. And when they have crisis after crisis, and you are mentally making excuses for them, and giving them more help, you are too involved at first to realize the resentment you feel. And if you do feel it, you squash it right down, because you're a nice person. And you just want to help.   It takes a while (for me, it used to take years) to see the pattern, and to realize that some people are, and ALWAYS will be, in crisis. They make shitty choices, again and again, and they have learned to use charm and guilt to manipulate what they want out of people. And they are so good at it, you don't even know until you are too deep in it. And as soon as you try to set boundaries to try to save these one-sided ""Friendships"" - they are gone. They will try every tactic they have, but if, in the end, you stick to your boundaries, they will get furious and leave. Because they had a rigged system, and boundaries destroy their one-sided system of taking, taking, taking.   So, there are a few key elements to this.   The first is to BE AWARE. You'll literally feel it in your gut - a person calls you and your gut tightens, because you know it's a call for some kind of help. It's never a call to hang out (unless it's to ask for money), or a call to see how YOU are. It's always a call, they are in crisis, and over time, your guy knows it and tightens up automatically when you see their name on caller ID.   Be aware of the other signs, too. If they can't seem to take responsibility, if they blame everyone but themselves for their life situations, if they always seem to be in crisis (and, when you think about it, their crises are always a result of poor choices they made), if they are unemployed but too good for the jobs you recommend to them, if they talk about themselves nonstop, these may be little red flags. Proceed with caution.   The second element is to SET HARD BOUNDARIES. The first boundary you set is to never give or lend money, ever, to anyone. Never. NEVER EVER. (Okay - 2 exceptions. A highly-rated and well-researched charity you believe in, OR an ANONYMOUS donation to someone who is in need due to a situation that was beyond their control, that you never speak of again.) Money no longer has any part of your friendships. I tell you - if you pick up the tab ONCE, you will be looked upon to pick it up every time, so never do it. Pay your own way, and let others pay theirs. People will ask you for money, and you must give a vague, but firm response. ""I don't lend money,"" or ""My money is tied up, I can't help you financially."" That is a complete sentence and does not require an explanation, or excuses, or apologies.   Another element is to research co-dependency, and make sure you're not creating  a co-dependent relationship by giving too much.   A therapist friend explained this kind of thing to me. He said ""Have you ever seen a relationship where one person works, cooks, cleans, and dotes on their partner hand and foot, and their partner is cruel, or ambivalent, or even abusive? And that just seems to make the giving person bend over backwards even more, trying to do more and more for them?"" There are psychological principles behind these behaviors. The person who is a giver desperately wants love and attention, and feels that if they can just do more and be better, they can make their partner change and be more loving. The cruel or ambivalent partner is almost deliberately mean, usually because they themselves feel crappy. They think ""I treat him / her so badly, and yet they stay. What kind of person has so little respect for themselves? What kind of person would stay with someone like me, who is so mean to them?"" So the mean partner is really resentful, and has zero respect for the person being nice, because the person being nice isn't acting in a way to earn respect. So the mean partner is even meaner, out of burning resentment, and STILL the nice person stays, and internalizes it, and thinks ""It must be ME. No sane person would treat me that way, so clearly I am the one doing things wrong. So I 'll just do more, and work harder..."" and it becomes a hellish cycle.   So the key here is respect. If you feel (in your gut) that a person is not treating you with respect, it's time to set hard boundaries. And if they stick around, and respect your boundaries, then that's the sign of a good potential friend."
selfimprovement,3djve9,dolphinesque,2,Thu Jul 16 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"To add to your excellent reply, I'll remind people that finding true friends is really really difficult. If you find one, hold on.

Cut everyone who isn't willing to support you at this step, and keep those who care enough to ask you more about the small concern you shared.

It can have three different causes:a low level of attention (""blanking"" or ""zoning out"")intense attention to a single object of focus (hyperfocus) that makes a person oblivious to events around him or her;unwarranted distraction of attention from the object of focus by irrelevant thoughts or environmental events.  Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of attention and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as ADD and depression. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.    This is pretty much me in a nutshell"

I have a weekly planner that I like to tick off tasks, review and jot down new stuff, every night before going to bed. I should mention that its a nice hardcover book that sits at my night stand, no apps for stuff this important.  I also have smaller note pads for a list of tasks for the day, this I carry it everywhere in my back pocket as a constant reminder so when I have any short intervals I make the required calls."

selfimprovement,3dgbl9,damned_throwaways,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the answer you've been hiding behind is no longer a functioning politeness cloak; your friends can see through it. What would happen if you told your friends ""No, I'm busy that day""?  Sometimes being a good friend means sitting through functions and events you'd rather not be a part of. If an event seems very important to a friend of yours (their shitty band is opening for a group they love, they've got a speaking role in a community theatre show, whatever) it's sometimes worth prioritizing that event to support your friend.  Personally, a lot of this goes back to only saying what I mean. I can't back up a ""maybe"" commitment with anything but wishy-washy ""maybe"" actions. ""Maybe"" is the Schrodinger's Cat of event invites, and only Bjork can make ""Possibly Maybe"" sound good. A yes or no reply soon after I receive the invite lets the person who sent the invitation know how many people to plan for. Planning for ""maybes"" who never show up means leftover hummus nobody wants.  People are usually understanding about schedules. If you say no and your friend seems disappointed, like they really wanted you to come, you can hit them back to say ""you know, I looked at my calendar and I can make your event after all"". I've never once been asked to explain myself for changing a ""No"" to a ""Yes""."

As a perpetual people-pleasure/approval-seeker, I tend to say yes to an event/get-together quickly without double checking my schedule.  I've learned to stop myself, ask that someone wait while I double check my calendar/other obligations, and make sure it's something I can really do.  It's so easy to say yes, and so disappointing to have to tell yet another person that you can't follow through. Star/flag all of the emails that you want to reply to and set a weekly time for yourself (say, Sunday at 4pm) to make sure you responded to everything you wanted/needed to the week before.  If you didn't, take an hour (or two) before dinner to make it happen.   Hope that helps and good luck!"

Paying close attention and focusing on the task/person at hand can actually be quite difficult.  It is a skill (and some are naturally better at it than others, sure), but it's something most need to practice and work at, rather that something that comes without conditioning.    In a nutshell -- it sounds like when you get overwhelmed with work you become self-conscious rather than other-conscious (That is, you become too focused on the self rather than the other person in the equation).  One tool you might find useful is meditation, where you practice the art of acknowledging your interruptive thoughts and setting them to the side.  This has worked for me -- perhaps it'll work for you: I keep a notebook at all times so that I can jot down the important thoughts/inspirations when they hit, but otherwise I put that aside and work to stay focused on the person in front of me.  I try to understand what s/he is saying, how s/he is communicating, how this connects us to each other and/or what I can contribute to the conversation.  The more I consciously make it about learning about/understanding another person/their point of view and less about myself (how to behave/respond/feel/etc.), the more engaged I am.    This may not hit the nail on the head either, but hopefully something resonates."

Then go to the next thing.  A good second thing is to do one thing that will improve your confidence.  Being healthier and having better confidence/self esteem will cascade throughout and start improving many aspects.    *Edit  I say one thing, because if you try to do many things.

selfimprovement,3dgozb,mcagent,2,Thu Jul 16 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"As the other commenter said, do not compare yourself to other people. You will always find people who are somehow better or worse than you in some ways. If you live in the western world and have access to internet, you are in the top % of the world with such a privilege, but does this fact make you any happier? Probably not, because there's someone in the .0001% that is better off than you so that makes you a ""failure"" in contrast.  I would wager that if you looked at Elon's history you would also see a streak of many ""failures"" and ventures that did not become successful. Did that stop him? Just because we see the highlight reel, we don't see what his life was actually like and how much he may of had to struggle to get to the level of success that he has. Consider re-framing ""failure"" as learning lessons, not as excuses to stop. There is no such thing as an overnight success without many learning lessons on the way.  Secondly, consider that maybe what you recognize in him, his genius, his creativity, his vision... and any other qualities that he possesses, are qualities that you actually have in yourself as well. We can only recognize things in others that we ourselves have. (Or have the potential to achieve) Let his success be something you get inspired by, not something that should stop you from pursuing.  I would compare myself to people like Bill Gates when I was younger and think ""well he made his program at 12 and I did mine at 14... that means I'm already behind and will never be like him. So why bother..."" Sounds ridiculous doesn't it?  We all have our unique gifts and talents that we can bring into the world and it's no coincidence (in my view) that you are born in the place you are born with the gifts and talents you have. Your mission is to believe in yourself and figure out how you can serve others with those gifts.  Your ego is quite clever and makes it all about you... but really if you look at what Elon is doing, he is doing it for the collective, for others. He wants to serve humanity with his gifts of forward-thinking innovation and vision.  Success is a by-product of doing something meaningful... money or fame, or any ""external"" measure of success is a not really something that is inherently going to be fulfilling on it's own.  Keep focusing on yourself and continue to grow. You are still young and you will figure it out. Take small steps and things will become clearer for you as time goes on.

The fact that you're attending university and don't have to work is a huge convenience for you that a lot of other ""hungry"" people don't get to enjoy.  I think some of you not being hungry has to do with not really having to work. I assume your school is being paid for, or your deferring payment until after graduation, and so the actual 'need' to work hard to pay that tuition bill/rent/food/entertainment is non-existent. It does sound comfortable. It's not a bad thing (hell, that's a great place to be!) but it's hard to be motivated when you have so much going for you without having to work for it.  You say you'd like to exercise more, and eat better - why do you want to do these? Because people say those are good things to do? That's not much of a motivator.. There's not a goal in that for you. So set a goal. I was 80+ pound overweight when I graduated college. I justified my lack of exercise as ""I need to focus on school"" and once I finished, I had no more excuse not to get into shape. My goal was to go outside and play basketball every day that summer to lose weight. I dropped 30 pound over the next 3 months because that was my goal.  I can relate on the food part - I started eating better and learned how to cook because A) my family has a bad track record with diet-related illnesses and B) I heard that women like a man that can cook. My goals were to decrease my chances of diabetes and increase my appeal to women that I dated.  The want to buy your mother a house is a noble goal, and a large one. You should break that down into many smaller, more manageable sub-goals and knock them out one by one. Getting this first job is a start. Working your way up through that company, or using it as a stepping stone to another position/company are incremental steps that you could take to make that big purchase a feasible option. Budgeting is a huge part saving/spending money  too, I'd check out /r/personalfinance for suggestions on how to make that goal (a common one) a reality.  Cheers, Eric"

Now how do you start? That's the big question. I'll recommend that you involve yourself in something productive as soon as possible (a job, a degree, whatever). And while you're at it, explore your different interests. You will soon find a direction in your life.   Hope this helps a bit."
selfimprovement,3dccub,ProAnonMan,6,Wed Jul 15 08:16:10 2015 UTC,"I never knew what I wanted to do, at age 18 I dropped out of college and got into work. At 27 I realised that I somehow ended up doing work revolving around a single interest (it/web/design/dev). It wasn't my only interest, as I too had picked up and shelved many things, but it was my primary. After realising this I have been able to decide consciously what I want from life and make a plan for how to get there. I turn 30 soon and glad to say I've started my own ecommerce business to gain financial freedom, because that's what's most important to me.  Identify that one interest you are drawn to (it can be vague), visualise a lifestyle based around it and make a plan to get there.  Also it's really cliche but a lot of this comes down to positive thinking. You MUST avoid useless negative self talk (beyond initial acknowledgement of your circumstances). And I don't mean ignoring problems, but reframing them;  ""I have no friends"" -> ""I want to have great friends""  ""I have no job"" -> ""I want to have a job that pays me £XXXk a year""  etc.  And keep reminding yourself on a daily basis of all the good qualities you have and you will feel better about yourself and more willing to build a better life for yourself."

selfimprovement,3dccub,HenryFuckinger,2,Wed Jul 15 08:08:23 2015 UTC,"At 21 I was mortified that I didn't know what to do with my life. That I had somehow drifted to where I was without making any real choices to do so, and that I was in no position to take ownership of it and move on. I had finished college, but had no plans on what to do for work, and no sense of who I wanted to be.  I think a great many people feel that way. I think the people who don't at 18-21, will feel it later, worrying they didn't make the right decisions.   Here's the thing though, there are no wrong answers. What you do now can set you up for later, but unlike school and anything that came before, you aren't going to take finals at the end of the year that will grade you on what you've done to this point.   It's easier to avoid the hard questions by putting them off. I could get an honorary doctorate in that. But the little things you do consistently, bit by bit, they make your life what it is. I'm 30 now (notice how many of us 30 year olds are telling you it can get better) and I think what I've found is that the things I didn't think too much about are the ones that made the most impact on my life being in a much better place. The things I worried about, didn't really matter (what am I supposed to be doing?)  But I do want to give you a practical piece of advice, because I think that's important to have. Like someone else said, do something small. Pick something you are going to see through, and do it every day. This isn't a big goal. Do you floss everyday? If not, try that. Do it for 30 days.   Why? Because it proves you can see something through and make new habits. It proves to you that you can change how you approach life daily.   In The Power of Habit, Charles Duhig calls this a keystone habit. Researchers have found that people who have made massive changes in their life (for the better) usually have some keystone habit they started with, which snowballed to a lot of other things. There is a really great story in the intro of the book about a woman who turned her life around starting with a similar and very simple habit. It was amazing.  So, it seems kind of silly, but I can speak from experience. I started with making my bed every day. Once that was a habit, I started to think of other things that seemed a little harder. Then I was writing a 1000 words daily, I was reading a book a week, without much effort.   You can still do whatever it is you want. You don't know what that is? Do whatever is going to open the most options up for you (or leave them open for as long as possible.)  There is a lot of good advice in here. You can do it. Start small, be forgiving to yourself and remember that you have so much in front of you. You just have to take that first small step... and one step at a time after that.   Before you know it, you won't believe how far you've gone."

selfimprovement,3dd434,Nohopeloner,2,Wed Jul 15 09:32:50 2015 UTC,"You're right lifes short. If you really want to get better you have to keep this mind set and not let yourself just slip into doing what you're used too and being comfortable with it. I'd make a schedule. There's nothing wrong with playing videos games or netflix but it is easy to start and end up spending more time than you originally wanted. I'd set a timer or alarm for 1hr and then get up move around do some pushups or something more productive. With a schedule of what you're doing and alarms to keep you on track it's a good way to not get lost in time. There's less guessing of what you're going to do next and so it'll get done more efficiently   for exercise if joining a gym is out of the question there's /r/bodyweightfitness  If you want to lose weight you'll have to eat better foods and count calories. Calories is what's important but eating unhealthy foods will probably leave you hungrier then you should be. high protein diet and lots of water helps.  If you want you could even find places to volunteer at this would probably be a good way to meet some new people as well. Soup kitchen, red cross, walking dogs for the pound. This will get you out the house and doing something good while having something to put on your resume.    You could go see someone for the depression its not always an easy thing to deal with by yourself. If you don't have any friends I'd stay off facebook. Really no reason to look at strangers/ people you used to know timelines. It's just their highlight reel and it won't do anything to help you besides make you feel down. It'll make you compare yourself to only the good things they post, it's not good to compare yourself to anyone besides who you was yesterday.  I'd suggest learning a new language or programming. Theres tons of free online material to do it with. Or trying a trade school to learn something specific that you want as a job. Or finding out as much as you can online about a job and requirements that you'd want to have.  But hey at the end of the day it's your life. Any motivation you find today could easily leave you tomorrow. Motivation isn't something to rely on for getting anything done. You have to make it a MUST DO instead of a want to do. If you make exercising your MUST DO. you HAVE to do it before you sleep everyday no excuses. It's NOT OPTIONAL. You're in complete control over what you do. Its amazing but we look at things such as sitting around as we're stuck but look here. Hold your hand up, wiggle your fingers now stand up walk in a circle. Guess what YOU told yourself to do that you control your whole entire body. The only thing holding you back is yourself.    Close your eyes imagine you're 65 years old and the only things you've done in life is the things you've accomplished up to today. Im sure you'd be disappointed in life never following your dreams, never getting a good job, staying overweight and having health problems. Its sad how you end up when you give up on yourself. Now open your eyes and realize you have 44 more years to work at making your future better than what you just saw. Just do it because when you are 65 you'll thank yourself for it."

Then I finally realised I needed to lose this bad habit of screen to accomplish anything in life.  I decided not to watch anything any movie,  tv show or play video game from now on.   For first few days it was horrible.  I would kill my day staring the birds out of window but I still did not get to what I really needed to do.  At day 4 I started going out of house.  I would walk on streets for no apparent reason. At week 2 i was so bored, i started a diet plan. And started reading those books.   Diet plan worked great I started losing weight so fast, It boosted my confidence. I started taking interviews but it did not go well.  But good thing was, I was getting out of house everyday and was talking with people. I started feeling better about myself.   I had so much time now that I joined a gym and made some friends there.

You chose your one worst habit and nixed it, and stuck with that until things started happening for you.   I was in a similar situation, and made a similar choice. TV was ruining my morning routine. Actually I should say I basically had no routine, and so would end up rushing through ""breakfast"" and getting ready for school at the last second/minute and be all angry and frustrated.  One day I cold-turkey'd screen time before school. I'm not even sure why I did it, except as you describe I felt like I needed to lose the habit. After a couple of days of feeling frustrated every morning, out of sheer boredom I started cleaning out a dresser/buffet in the living room that had been ignored for years, and was full of junk.  It seemed like a stupid way to waste some time at the beginning, but actually turned into a fun project, and resulted in a de-cluttering morning routine that has now served me for years.

Maybe the first one you went to didn't click. Or maybe you didn't understand that just like physical therapy, mental / emotional therapy takes a few sessions to get the ball rolling.    The bottom line is that your issues are so big that it may take a professional. No one on the internet can fix you. So please, please seek out professional help, and see that as the first step in getting healthier. It REALLY helps.   The second thing I recommend is for motivation. I could tell you 100 reasons why you would want to make changes, but those would be MY reasons. I suggest getting out a sheet of paper, and for the next 20 minutes or so, writing out all of the reasons you want to make changes. Everything, no matter how seemingly small, shallow, or insignificant. They don't have to be politically correct reasons, or ""socially approved"" reasons - just ANY reason you can think of to make changes. And don't be afraid to delve. You want your own apartment - why? What would you do there? How would you decorate it and make it your own? How would you feel if you spoke clearly and confidently? What makes you want to speak that way?   This is all about baby steps, and small wins. Those little things will give you small self-esteem boosts that will start an upward spiral of motivation and more esteem-building activities.   Please update when you can!"

Second time screwing up stats means you can't take it again, right? Your options are probably limited to taking it at a community college or trying to CLEP out if that's an option. You should look into whether your school counts those CLEP credits. Your professor's remark amounts to, 'if you weren't lazy, you could have gotten a better grade, you had amble opportunity and squandered it."" Are you having trouble with the material? Or is this an issue of work ethic? or both?  You say, disappointing everyone else. Sometimes that's fine motivation, but you've admitted that smoking weed and hanging with new friends has contributed to your academic decline. Probably wise to try and not worry about disappointing them.  You have a vague goal. First it was pre-med, then it was economics, now poli sci which I get that you love. Are you interested in any of these in a meaningful way? Is it love or just something you enjoy a bit? Or are you interested only in the end game of being a lawyer? I think this is somewhat important for enthusiasm towards the work itself.  You don't need to self-hate and mull on your failings. Everyone fails, it's how we stand back up that matters. So what I would recommend, to help you get back on track, is list out your goals (I know this is common trite advice but it's good advice all the same)   List your major goals on a piece of paper. List your minor ones. List medium goals. Organize this. Mull over each one. ""I want to be a lawyer"" Why? Why not? Write down your answers. Then write down what are the steps to get there (Pass the bar, get into law school, pass lsats, etc). Do this for most of your goals, not just academic, not just big. Some could be ""Meet a girl"" What matters is thoroughness. As you answer and mull over each one, new goals will obviously form. New things you need to do. Some goals will be abandoned, changed. Some will be added. But you'll be able to look at a map of who you want to be and the steps you need to transform yourself. That's just a useful thing to have.  Ex. Goal: work around stats. ""why?"" Because I need to pass it for x y z. How do I pass it? (research/talk to counselor, etc) Be thorough.  As this happens you'll probably see two things. Many of your goals are far off onto the horizon. Second. The smaller goals are more manageable.   Look, 2.5 isn't great and you know this, but, you seem really concerned about your grades and that bodes well for you shaping up. I think you're going to be fine if you work hard and make things happen. You seem like a smart guy who made some miscalls. It happens. Just work hard and you'll be fine."

A big party with tons of new people may be too far out of your comfort zone right now, which is why you had the panic attack.   A gratitude practice can quickly help with the self-confidence and, to a lesser extent with the social anxiety. Keep a written journal of 3 things every day that you are grateful about, and be specific.  Lack of social confidence can come off as creepy without anything else supporting the creepy-factor. If you work on loving yourself and becoming more comfortable with who you are, by yourself as well as around other people, you will become more socially fluid and engage more comfortably with other people.  I don't know whether you're a creepy person either, but the fact that you're worried about it is a good red flag to work on self-love.

I believe there are several reasons for this: they want to be nice or hurt your feelings, they see an incomplete picture, etc... If I was going to ask them anything, I would ask them simply ""If there is one thing you think I should work on, what would it be.""  Or, ""if there is one thing that I should improve with myself, what would it be.""  Honestly, I wouldn't focus on generating a giant list of flaws that you should improve.  I would find one flaw, right now, and work on improving that.  Then go to another, etc..  Start taking care of the flaws that you know you have, as you start taking care of them, you will notice that improvement on these will improve others.  If you get a big list of flaws, it can be hard to know where to start, or could even be depressing. Good places to start are: one thing to make you more healthy, one thing to improve style or give you confidence, one thing to improve social skills.

selfimprovement,3dauid,wifree,2,Tue Jul 14 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"Hi, I cannot directly relate to you, however my sister is about to graduate in December with her B.S. in CS cum laude. I'm a sophomore, and have gone through my own struggles with picking the right major, but she has stuck it out from the beginning. We're pretty tight, so I think I -may- be able to help.  Here are somethings that she has told me that I feel may relate to you: 1) She tells me all the time that she isn't head over heels in love with Comp. Sci. and that she has no idea what she wants to do in it (she's taken two internships in our home state that have been well-paying and mostly good experiences at two different companies), but she's going to graduate with it because it does offer so many opportunities. The CS degree is unbelievably versatile in many ways -- she has outstanding interview offers at Goldman Sachs, Activision, Dell, and AT&T in an assortment of positions from financial analyst to technology development. To her, it's enough to continue. 2) Neither of us has ever really dated either, even though we could, and we've discussed it at length. It's just where we are in life. College is an interesting time because of the choices it affords you. We both dated a little in high school, and then just dove into our studies in college. If dating is important to you at this point in your life, maybe take away a little from your studies and give it more of a shot. Coming from a college guy, many of us are sitting there waiting for an opportunity to talk to an interesting woman, but are either unsure if their interest is there too or are unwilling to make the first move in fear of being shot down. If you ever go out to coffee shops, sit at communal tables. Alternatively give parties a try. You have to meet the person before you can date them, no? 3) You're only a rising Junior. My sister tells me this is the toughest year, but also the most rewarding. She didn't begin to see internship offers until the end of her Junior year, and she still had time to take two of them. If anything, just relax and prepare for the coming year as best as you can. 4) If you absolutely loathe your major, there certainly has to be some alternative that would not impact your financial aid. At our university (US), the scholarships are College-specific. Neither of us qualified for any, but one of her friends changed from CS to EE, and his scholarship wasn't affected. Also, I understand how motivating financials can be in these situations, but in many cases, you have to just kind of do what you -want- to do. People always say that you have to major in something that nearly guarantees a job, but I disagree. If you're smart (which clearly you are), and are witty enough to CREATE opportunities, then it just becomes a matter of getting your foot in the door. A CS degree is incredibly sought-after, yet my sister can't wait to get out of school in 5 months and be done with it. 5) This is my own personal advice to you. Your post seems incredibly all over the place. You seem like you've hit a point where you just have a whole bunch of potential directions to pursue but instead feel trapped by all of it. College is hard as hell. My sister and I both come from an environment where anything other than A's are unacceptable. Sacrifices have certainly been made at times, stress-induced insomnia has occurred, and tears have been shed. I know what its like to feel like crap, to feel like there is no time for anything but practice problems and problem sets and spreadsheets and lab reports and presentations. To combat these, I would suggest to keep a few constants in your life. Surely you must have passions outside of school, no? I require that I try to read an hour a day, and on clear weekends I go stargazing. I think that maybe you just need a mental reset on a daily basis that you can look forward to and give meaning to all the hard work you HAVE done. Also, there is NEVER any shame in doing what you have to do to give your life meaning. If anyone EVER degrades you for working in a restaurant, they do not deserve the privilege of being in your life. We all have different wants and needs and dreams, and no one follows anywhere near the same route to them as the next. This also applies to dating as well. I also assure you that comparing yourself to your peers will only add to your misery. I can almost guarantee you that these ""awesome tech-company internships"" aren't quite so awesome as people say they are. College, unfortunately, is a breeding ground for dick-comparisons. Just do what you can now to make yourself as attractive to employers as possible, within reason. Don't kill yourself just to have a resume that shits gold--a good GPA can get you in some places alone, extracurriculars just add a little fluff. But you also want to become as well rounded as possible, and the only way to accomplish that is by branching out, which is something it feels like you would really like to do.  I wish you the best of luck. I'm certain that you can do whatever it is you put your mind to. Somethings require more time to be resolved than we intend, but more often than not things work out the way we want them to. This is a strange and confusing time in our lives -- there is A LOT to work through in only 4 or 5 years. In times of doubt, just think about where you see yourself in 5 years. If you're not doing something daily to achieve that end, then maybe you need to make some simple corrections to your given course. Good luck!"

I live in Ecuador, and although things are not as bad here as they are in Venezuela (mostly because our national currency is the dollar over which the government has no control) It can be very hard to remain optimistic about the future, expending effort to improve your condition can seem as a useless waist of energy. I dont have a cookie cutter answer to your question, but I have experienced the same problem and this is what I have found useful. I am building a lifestyle were I am not subject to the government's whim and subjugation. I used to study medicine, but I dropped out because being a doctor in this situation is not a very smart call. I became an entrepreneur focused on online internet based services, which allows me to work on the margins of government control and work in the international markets as well. I accept bitcoin as payment and have a bank account in Panama which allows me to work with people all over the world, and I never bring back the money to my country. Having your hard earned money confiscated by the government through taxes and inflation is one of the worst blows to your motivation, it drains your will to work hard and make something of yourself. We cant do anything directly to change our goverment, but you can protect yourself and put some of your wealth outside their reach, specially through bitcoin. In case things get really ugly, having money outside the country is always good and makes it easier to leave. I hope you find this useful, Ecuador is following the same path as Venezuela and there is not much we can do about it other than prepare ourselves accordingly"

selfimprovement,3d2qvw,stilllearming,9,Mon Jul 13 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Just want to say I'm proud of you for working toward a more healthy relationship with pornography, if you choose to view it at all.  For me, I know that I can't get rid of any of my bad habits until I address the root of them all, my mental health. I can spend 4 hours shopping, comparing prices, getting lost in the moment. I can eat too much. I can drink and feel happy for the moment. I know those are all vices for me; things that if I'm not careful, I can really overdo it.   So for you, I'd suggest finding things to fill that role now that you no longer seek out porn. The reason any of us go back to our addictions are because they make us feel better for the moment, and they work, even if they are damaging. For me, I try to call a friend if I'm upset or bored. I try to meditate and get more exercise. I know that if I don't address my real problems (anxiety, boredom, compulsion), that they will find a way out somehow.   It's my job to make sure I'm addressing them in a healthy way, rather than ignoring them and ending up back in my old habits.   Good luck friend. I'm happy for you."

Porn addiction is 100% not real.   You are hating yourself for absolutely no reason. That is the real issue here. You are stuck in a cycle of guilt that feeds itself, and traps you inside it.  I highly recommend you watch this video: Dr. Darrel Ray: The Myth of Sex Addiction  Then, check out Dr. Darrel Ray's book Sex & God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality.  ""I still feel confused about how to approach women. They have mostly approached me. I feel I don't know what to do.""  Just... be yourself. Be authentic, nice, and try to be funny. Whatever you do, don't follow what you have seen in ""Pickup Artist"" videos.  In my opinion, this is much ado about nothing. Relax, enjoy what you like to enjoy, stop beating yourself over the head with guilt, and talk to women like a real human being."

selfimprovement,3d1aam,texture,3,Sun Jul 12 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"Happy to see a comment mentioning Buddhism. OP could really benefit from its teachings. Definately subscribe to r/buddhism.  A lot people really have a skewed view on what is taught through this practice and similar Eastern practices. Contrary to popular belief, the primary teachings of Buddhism are not very ""religious"" in a Western sense so much as they are practical.   Basically, Buddha was just a dude that, like OP, suffered a lot even when there was no logical reason for the suffering, so he dedicated his life to discovering why he suffered and creating following a pathway out of that suffering.   Through intense self-examination (i.e. meditation), The Buddha basically concluded two things. First, suffering is not logical and is therefore an illusion. Second, that our natural body and the sensations that we experience through it are our greatest tool for experiencing our existence, not our minds.  In fact, Buddha argues that our mine mind is the source of our suffering. He says that the mind creates suffering through a myriad of different illusions or delusions, the primary of which include the illusion of the past and future and the illusion of seperateness.  1. The Illusion of the Past and the Future- Our sense of time stems from our ""objective"" understandings of our lives. Man invented language and writing and from these we get his story history. We view these stories and writings and say that it is ""objectively true"" that these things happened. We then carry with us the past in our mind as a kind of quick-reference book to help us navigate through the present and future, or in other words, to help us survive. So objectively, these stories can and have be useful to help humanity get to now.  That said, our individual physical experiences are not objective, rather, we only physically experience the subjective. From our own subjective perspective, we have no real connection to this history, it is just stories after all and not physically real. In fact, we know that history is often misrepresented or outright wrong. Science tells us that even our own memories are often misleading. Furthermore, in our society, most people do not encounter ""survival situations"" very often in their subjective lives. So why do we keep all these stories playing on repeat in our minds? Well that's the kicker. We don't have to. In fact, Buddha found that these stories can make us biased and sour our perspectives on what's happening now.    Perhaps this is what's happening to OP for he is experiencing undoubtedly good things in his life, yet cannot enjoy them because of the way he views himself and his past stories.   2. The Illusion of Separation- The Buddha says our mind has another way of keeping us in a state of suffering in that it attempts to define us. When we ask ourselves, ""Who am I?"", we might say, ""I am my body"" or ""Well, I'm me."" What we fail to recognize is that these labels are limiting in that they draw boundaries. To say that I am me is to say that I am not you. All of our language draws boundaries in this way.   For instance, if you place your hand on the leaf of an Aspen tree in a Forrest and I asked you what you are touching you'd be correct to say ""a leaf."" Yet that leaf is part of the whole tree so you'd also be correct to say, ""I'm touching an Aspen tree."" Yet that Aspen tree, like all Aspen trees, is likely connected at the roots to the surrounding trees so you'd also be correct to say, ""I'm touching the forrest."" Yet that forrest is clearly connected to the soils that it rests upon, therefore you'd also be correct to say, ""I'm touching the Earth."" Yet the Earth is a part of the cosmos, therefore you'd also be correct to say, ""I'm touching the Universe.""  It is in this very way that our mind deceives us into believing that ""I am just me"" while preventing us from seeing that ""I"" implies ""you."" Now, you may say, ""InfinityPoolBoy, you can't really expect me to believe that I am you or that you are the same as me."" To which I'd respond, ""Of course I can!"" After all, even science says we all come from the same spark of life that was the big bang. The bible says we are created IN God's image, not out of it. Jesus said he is ONE with God. All of these imply connection, not separation.   Isn't that THE ideal scenario? If you are not just you, but rather everything is you, than you have nothing to fear. Why would you put yourself through this life if it wasn't something you could handle? If you are, on a fundamental level, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING that you have ever and will ever encounter, is that not immeasurably beautiful? You shine as bright as a sun. You fly as free as a cloud. You sing songs that can bring nations to tears and you fight wars to feel the relief of peaceful years.   So, how do you FEEL this way?  Well, the Buddha says you must learn to stop the illusions/delusions of the mind. You learn to quiet the mind by practicing mindfullness. You learn to live for the now by accepting the past and future as both necessary and inevitable. You learn to stop feeling disconnected by practising compassion. You learn to love your body by treating it well and you learn to love your mind by giving it a rest so that it can be better used when you are the better you. You turn the dial to a higher frequency and you wave wake UP to a better life.  Remember, life's a journey, but there is always a path. It's true, nothing good was ever had without hard work, but come on man, we're taking about PRACTICE. :)"

That way, whether you succeed or fail, you can be proud of yourself for working on it. Or even small things, like slowly learning a language or travelling more.   When I feel like a boring, undirected shit I think on all the stuff I have done, and am doing, and know I am doing pretty fukken ok - even if the choices I made in the past didn't lead me to the life I wanted, just gotta pick a new path and commit to it and graft until you feel good about how hard you are working. And if that path doesn't work out? Fuck it! New goal! And you can look in the mirror and say ""I did this, I am doing this, and it is good."""

After reading your post, I think you've had your share of shit, for sure, but to be able to love yourself and not think lowly of yourself has to come from within. Don't dwell too much on the past, and if you do, learn from your past experiences and failures.   Ask yourself; what do you enjoy doing? Find meaning in the droning events of everyday life and start working from there.   To feel content with yourself though, honestly? Find value in yourself. By this, I mean evaluate yourself and think, ""what do I bring to the people I interact with?"" Small steps man, think positively beginning with yourself. Don't say ""other people have told me...""

selfimprovement,3d1aam,TheCovenant,2,Mon Jul 13 02:55:04 2015 UTC,"I don't mean your post is a sob story. You're simply sharing your past experiences and it makes sense as to why and how you've come to where you are now.   You say ""Yet I feel like there's something else I should be doing, something that's missing, but really there isn't."" this is fine. It's fine for us, as humans, to always have something missing. Once we're content with what we are, we sort of stop trying to be better than what we are. So channel that ""missing"" part of you into something positive. Channel it into wanting to be the best that you can be, not because you want to be content with your life, but maybe because you should BE that way because you can. Believe in the never-ending goal of human perfection; even though this is impossible. Idealistic, even.   You tell us, the viewers, that you KNOW but you don't FEEL that way. I can't say I can empathize with this, because I personally doubt myself all the time, but I can say this; Is that who you want to be? These traits you list about yourself, can you love yourself if you were someone else? If no, then you have a good idea on how to change. IF you find that there is no problem, then what's holding you back?  I can't answer this question for you, it has to be from within.  Yes, believe in yourself and your judgement, but don't forget to question. We're humans, we aren't perfect, we're never always correct. It is good to seek perfection, but it's OK to be imperfect."
selfimprovement,3d1aam,MountedCzarina,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"Man your advice is amazing!   I've often managed for periods at a time to channel it into something good, like at the gym, or working towards goals... I should try to make that a permanent thing. Continually striving for betterment, for improvement.  As a whole there isn't much I'd change about myself that can be changed, and what can't be changed has to be accepted, and 99% of the time I can do that by now, sometimes I get caught up, trying hard not to. But I'm friendly, always respectful (unless it's unwarranted and necessary not to be), honest, all the good stuff, and I always have good intentions. So really I wouldn't change that.   The only thing internally I want to change is how often I get miserable about silly things that are in the past. For example I bought that car for a reason, it suited my needs, my wants, and my budget plus I like it a lot. No reason to look back at that choice, it's done for. Same thing with my lease and so on.   With college I think it's best I stick to what I' doing because I enjoy what I study and I'm very good at the subject, so I have potential to go far there. I've decided however that if some sort of amazing once in a lifetime chance comes up I will possibly postpone my studies. Maybe not the best idea but it's an agreement I am okay with, provided the right chance comes along. I can live with that.  I've also decided to maybe either put a break in my studies or after I get my degree going to a tech school to learn the vocational side of another subject that relates to my major and ties in well with what I want to do in life, to give me a better perspective and a more well rounded view of things and a change of scenery. Also it provides me with a vocational safety net. I think that's an appealing idea.  Questioning rather than doubting seems like a healthy attitude, no one is ever perfect."

A couple suggestions;    Try finding some good role models and ideally some good friends who really put themselves out there in a similar way to how you wish you would. Pay attention to them and try to imitate some of what they do. Put your own personal spin on it, of course. Seeing others uninhibited will give you a kind of ""permission"" to have fun and let loose. READ some books. I'm reading the Charisma Myth right now and I'd highly recommend it. It breaks down social fluency and teaches you how to achieve it. I also recommend No More Mr Nice Guy. Not sure if this book will help you as much as it did me, but it changed my life and confidence.  Learn to laugh at yourself and make fun of yourself. Some of my smoothest moments come when someone TRIES to give me a hard time but I just let it roll of my back.  Don't underestimate FORCING yourself to be silly. Hoot and holler, jump around, act like an idiot on purpose. People tend to think their actions follow their mental state, but you can absolutely get yourself into a different mental state by changing your PHYSICAL actions   It's like going to the gym, all you can do is get out there and chip away a little bit everyday.

In that case, I totally disagree. Speaking in conversation is a skill to be cultivated. It puts me people at ease. Cold silence does not.

But to do so, you have to ask the question that will pique their interest and follow up to show you're paying attention. It's a back and forth with a generous helping of giving back your attention but adding something to the exchange. I think the author's point is, ""Don't try to impress.

I feel like I've been getting away with it for too long, but if I keep doing it, it'll hurt my career and social life.  I know that I should shut up and listen, say less and communicate more - but I feel completely powerless sometimes and end up kicking myself later. Usually I'll make a good impression, but start to chip away at it the longer I'm in the situation and not knowing when to stop. I get such a rush from it, it feels good to talk. I know I'm taking advantage, I know I might be dominating the conversation - but it's hard to remain self aware in those moments for me.  Are there any specific exercises I can do which will help me learn to get my exuberance (which I believe is rooted in deeply masked insecurity) under control?

Seriously this is just so backwards it doesn't make sense.

Changing is awesome and if you are ready to exert a lot of will power, determination and persistence you will achieve lasting change in the long run. The way I started was simply by watching inspiring, motivational content on youtube, I'd urge you to check these two channels out:  https://www.youtube.com/user/elliottsaidwhat  https://www.youtube.com/user/ActualizedOrg  Once you have gotten started with watching these, aka managing your influences, tons of other good things will come to you as a byproduct. Watch, take notes and make a commitment to get a little bit better in every area of your life during EVERY SINGLE DAY. Small, steady growth over a long period of time is what enables you to expand and grow yourself most effectively.   Start looking for self-help books like ""Awaken the giant within"" by Tony Robbins or ""The power of now"" by Eckhart Tolle. These books could take you so far if you embrace them that it's scary.   Begin to cultivate some resourceful habbits. Start small, drink a few  extra glasses of water every day, do some yoga or stretching, take a walk. Celebrate the small progress that you're making to get yourself into a ""loop"" of positive feedback and momentum to keep going.   At last, start reframing everything that happens in your life by viewing everything as a reference experience, an opportunity for you to learn something and grow yourself. You either get better, or bitter, it's that simple, really. Theres tons of great information and motivation to be found out there!

If you think of the cup half full instead of half empty, you'll interact differently, you'll be more cheerful, you won't be defensive, etc.  As for selfish, I'm not sure what exactly you mean as everyone has a definition. There's nothing wrong with being self-interested and looking out for your well being/success/whatever.

selfimprovement,3crdqs,AcropolisScholars,2,Fri Jul 10 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"It can be tough to stay optimistic and positive, but it's something you work at. You won't be perfect, but little by little your life will feel better.  As for defensiveness, I think looking at things like the 'glass is half full' helps. Someone making a comment isn't necessarily a jab at you. Half empty is thinking it's a jab. Assume the comment is made with the best genuine goal.  Not saying that it is easy. There is one fact in life that I know, and it's that I can only control myself. I can't control other people. I can't make them think a certain way or submit to my stellar argument, no matter how rational it may be. You'll run into knobs. You'll get cut off on the road. Your co-worker might snap at you. Other people have their own shit going on. The snappy co-worker could genuinely be having the worst day of their life, independent of you.  If you have truly toxic people in your life, you need to remove them.  All these points are good, but they all serve something. There is one inherent thing, I believe, a person should get out of life; happiness. That's what you're trying to do with your life. I've found I've gotten much better at focusing on this and ignoring the rest as I've digested more philosophy (or it could be that I just keep getting older).   In this world, you can only control, what you can control. You can't control, what you can't control. Don't sweat a dick comment, or getting cut off, or making an ass of yourself. All you have to do is control yourself and control yourself in such a way that you extract the maximum amount of happiness out of your life.  I know you would like some tips and specifics, but really it's a mental game. That's why philosophy is so good. It's not that it's dry and boring, it changes the way you think about things and the way you approach the world. It takes time and practice, but you'll get it.  Best of luck to you."

selfimprovement,3crdqs,davosa500m,2,Sun Jul 12 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"Three things I would look at first, as these are vital (and often overlooked) in any approach to personal change:  1) Relationships: the people around you influence your thoughts, feelings & behavior; do they make you into the kind of person you want to be? Perhaps a change is in order. 2) Scripts/Rules/Self-Talk: Do some reflective journaling to gain a little more self-knowledge about the stories and scripts that run ""in the background"" of your mind that you tell yourself about yourself and others. Are your internal monologues about others or yourself more negative, disparaging, or kind, cool, and confident? Note - this one improving depends on the other two improving too. 3) Aesthetic Environment: The physical space you inhabit and the clothes you wear shape your psychological state and biological rhythms. Is your home/room/office clean and organized, giving a sense of peace and stability? Do you keep the interior climate comfortable or uncomfortable? Do you spend more time in front of a screen than in the fresh air?   As a more personalized note, my professional intuition (as a behavioral psychologist) is that you may want to address the need for greater stability in your life and for finding a source of strength which allows you to become more confident. I also recommend taking up a practice of mindfulness for 1-2 minutes every morning as a place to start. I think you find that if you get a few basic systems in place regarding the above items, you'll begin to notice some significant change over time.

Currently seeing a psychologist to try and get off them. He recommended a book called 'Hope and Help for Your Nerves"" by Carol Weekes, which has been helpful by just learning more about how anxiety/panic attacks work. But in the meantime, take the prescription when I can predict I'll be in an anxiety-inducing situation or when I do have a panic attack I wasn't expecting. While I'm waiting for them to hit a couple big things that have worked for me is extra big deep breaths, mentally repeating that there is nothing medically wrong with me and that it's a flush of adrenaline, and remembering humorous past experiences.   If she asked you out I would say she likes you. Have you explained that you get anxiety around her? I know everyone is different, so there's not a one-size-fits-all fix, but it thoroughly helped my previous relationship to explain anxiety to her, both because she understood afterwards that it didn't mean I was weak or overly-sensitive, but also because it was a lot easier to say ""I'm sorry, I need to get out of this situation because I'm having a panic attack, I'm going to go have a smoke/get some fresh air."" A lot of the times she was helpful by vocally reassuring me that I wasn't about to drop dead and we could talk through it, basically get my worries out of my head by saying them out loud.

I recently bought Phenibut, a central nervous system depressant that apparently works wonders on social anxiety, but is highly addictive and builds a quick tolerance in the body. Because of these facts I don't use it much, and plan to only use it during stressful events ex. a party, social gathering, etc.  Its recommended dose is 4grams/week at most and no more than twice per week.  Ironically on the day I had a panic attack in front of my crush, I contemplated taking Phenibut before leaving the house but decided against it. :s Regret it so much now and wonder how our encounter could have gone if I had actually used it. I wasn't expecting to see her that day though. :s   If she asked you out I would say she likes you.    Haha, I thought that's what it meant too but her actions towards me after I unintentionally rejected her don't really show me that she had any serious feelings towards me. She's proven to be flaky and uncommitted right now. I'm still open to being her friend, but whole 'asking me out' thing and knowing that she was physically attracted to me changes the dynamic of our friendship a bit and makes me more anxious than I used to be around her. :(   Have you explained that you get anxiety around her?   I think she may have figured out I get it around her, you can read about it in more detail if you click the link in my original post. But she asked me 'what do you have to be anxious about??' and then I started tripping up my words and panicking and she was like 'aww, I made you - "" Before I cut her off. So I think she knew that she triggered it at that point. :s  How did you explain anxiety to your last girlfriend? I was caught off guard in my situation and that's why I began to panic. I didn't know how to explain what made me anxious and what it really was. I fear now that she thinks less of me, thinks I'm weak/over-sensitive and will feel the need to be extra nice to me. :s I don't know how to repair this.  I'll add Carol Weekes book to my reading list and I'll try to remember your method of breathing deep.   Thank you for reaching out to me. :) I'll definitely keep you in mind. <3"

Benzodiazepams are also considered addictive, but can be taken as needed up to a certain amount that I suggest asking your doctor since I'm not one. In my case, half a pill does the trick and I'm on 1mg. Anyway, I agree with changing the dynamic, but maybe try to keep in mind that you're not weak. Anxiety is nothing you decided to turn to or agreed to. Remember that you didn't choose this, genes/fate/God, whatever you believe in is the cause, not any form of weakness in you. So what if she needs to be extra nice to you, if she's truly your friend she's not going to think less of you. And in my case with my ex, I told her within a few days of us meeting. I just said ""I'm feeling really anxious right now, sometimes I get panic attacks and I'm having one right now."" Or at least something along those lines, it's been nearly 3 years now."

At my mom's, I can always visit him. He adapted extremely fast and he is very happy. Try a place you can visit once in a while to show yourself that he/she will be ok. Because this is about your feelings ultimately. You have already admitted that you know that dog will most likely adapt, as he/she WILL. You won't regret it. Traveling young was one of the best experiences of my life. I remember it everyday. DO IT!   Remember - dogs are NOT people. Your dog will not feel the same thing you do when you give him/her a new home. They just need attention and love. Ask the new owners to see the dog on maybe weekends or a set date, or get someone close to you to adopt. You won't regret it!! Good luck to you."
selfimprovement,3coykx,Noodes,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"Hey man  Thanks very much for the reply.  The thing is, I'm thinking about travelling to quite far out places which would mean that going back to see her at weekends etc would not be possible.  I mean she would still live with my mum and dad. Still, on a practical level, they couldn't give her the exercise she needs etc.  I'm seriously considering taking her with me travelling!"
selfimprovement,3coykx,Noodes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:58 2015 UTC,"If you take her with you, the expense might be worth it if you think you'll be better off knowing how she is. make sure you look for accommodations for dogs before hand - hotels and things that allow them. Good luck!"
selfimprovement,3coykx,dolphinesque,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"You're in a tough situation. I guess my thought is ""Why would someone get a dog if they want to travel?""   I want to travel too. And I have three dogs. If I go away, even for a weekend, I hire a professional pet sitter at $25 per visit (so at three visits per day that's $75 a day) to take care of them at home. It's expensive but I made a commitment to these dogs when I took them in. So, as much as I want to just take off for a month, that's not an option for me.   If you DO choose to travel with your dog, I recommend getting it tattooed or microchipped (for identification if it gets lost or stolen). And make 100% certain that she is permitted to every place you want to go. So if you are planning ahead, you can choose dog-friendly hotels and modes of travel. If you want to do a ""fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants"" style of wandering, I don't think it's great to subject a dog to that, as you could end up in a bad situation with nowhere that will allow your dog. I'd also recommend  that you have proof of her vet records and vaccinations (in case you need to board her in an emergency).   Maybe you need to consider rehoming the dog with someone who is ready for the responsibility and commitment. If you adopted the dog from a shelter or rescue group, usually they have a clause in their contract that if you must give up the dog, it has to be returned to the shelter / rescue group. So that way you could travel, and they'll work on rehoming the dog. And then maybe don't get a dog until you are fully ready to settle down and commit to giving a dog a stable, lifelong home."

selfimprovement,3cnzql,Schlooop,6,Thu Jul 9 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"Here's something I learned just from being with my husband, who is loving and wonderful.   Manipulation is what we do when we think we can't get what we need any other way.  But what we can do is use more loving and assertive ways to get those needs met, instead of resorting to manipulation.   9 times out of 10, when I was spinning out of control, and frustrated, and miserable, and acting out, what I REALLY needed, more than anything, was a hug. I wanted to feel loved and nurtured. And I didn't even really KNOW that, but I realized that every time I'd fly off the handle, my husband would get up and put his arms around me, and tell me how much he loved me, and it calmed me almost instantly.   At first, pride messed with me, and I'd do the whole ""leave me alone!"" thing. But that was counter-productive, because in the end what I wanted, needed, more than anything, was that hug and those loving words. Pride, and ego, and that self-righteous desire to just BE MAD were driving that away. So I had to ditch that terrible way of interacting, and learn to say ""I really feel insecure and lonely right now. Can I please have a hug?"" And I ALWAYS got the hug I needed so badly. What a beautiful change from screaming and crying.   For me, self-harm was usually a reaction to feeling overwhelmed, possibly resentful, and needing attention, but not knowing how to ask. It would usually happen if I was taking care of others and neglecting my own needs. So, I have learned to identify when I am getting overwhelmed, and nip that in the bud. I am learning to say ""no"" to people, because that is a form of self-care - I need my personal time and sometimes that means I can't help others at those times, and that is not only okay, but important. And I rely on my husband as a partner. He is not my adversary. When there is a problem between us, we discuss it as a team. We work on a solution together.   I'll admit, it is REALLY satisfying to the ego to NEED to be right all the time, to NEED the attention and drama focused on me, to know that with a few simple threats I can get what I want. But that kind of satisfaction is the worst, it is short-lived, and highly detrimental to relationships and personal growth. You ultimately will not be able to respect a partner who gives in to your threats. So subconsciously, your thoughts become ""What kind of idiot would put up with me? Why won't he leave?"" So then the whole cycle of self-loathing perpetuates. You behave worse and worse, always escalating, to push him away. The more he stays, the more you loathe him for staying. It can ONLY end badly.   So...stop the cycle! You don't need drama and self-righteous ego satisfaction.  You need love, hugs, and nurturing. You need understanding and compassion. From yourself as well as your boyfriend!"

selfimprovement,3cnzql,jdarbuckle,16,Mon Jul 20 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hey there. My name is Jordan, I run an online mind-body-life academy. And I used to be like this too when I was younger, so I'd love to help :)   A.   How cool is it that you just became aware? Do you know how many people never ever become aware for their entire lives, and stay trapped? So celebrate that for a second. A close family member of mine I've been talking to just became aware about manipulation in our family, so they are about to reach freedom too. Sent an email the other day and they said, ""I'm turning 50 but I'm counting this as year one.""   B.   Manipulation is tricky, because all of us are manipulating when we interact with people. We want to be loved and respected, and get what we want. And that's totally awesome!   Manipulation is not bad by itself. There is good and bad manipulation. You know why Mother Theresa personally touched everyone she met and never took anything? Because she got her kicks from it, haha!   (And you can too, try giving to someone every single day. You can't be touched by negativity.)  C.   Just drop the whole self-harm thing. Your default reaction to that is ""I can't."" But you've got like 80-ish years on this amazing planet to enjoy all the incredible things we get to do, so don't waste any more time NOT making progress with self-harm (I mean it's in the name, right?), is that an acceptable rule?   By the way, make rules, not habits. Habits are things you break over and over again, but making a rule happens in a moment, usually after some big source of pain in your brain. Like right now, so this would be a great time to just flip the switch. ;)   D.   We are all terrible communicators with other people. Everything is misinterpreted, wrapped up in your own ego, and then you send something back out that gets misinterpreted again. So, the only REAL way to fix this challenge (and many other challenges like this) are to just communicate out of love.   Communicating out of love is really, really hard. Sometimes my girlfriend and I have to sit down and say, ""This is going to be weird, but let's get through it"".   And just say those really difficult things that you hide behind passive aggression. And say them out of love, remember? No ""you do this"", always ""I feel this"".   And then guess what happens? Your partner is so relieved because they are feeling the exact some way. And if they can communicate out of love too, say goodbye to real ""fights"", but say hello to something even harder, which is just honesty and truth.   I've got to roll, but I have office hours over at cnqr.co if you ever want to talk about anything. Get in on our fitness campaign right now too, it's super easy, fun, and helps you with respecting yourself and your body while getting strong!"

selfimprovement,3cnzql,Smartare,3,Thu Jul 9 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"I seem to be saying this a lot lately, but maybe that's not a coincidence.  What I think could really help you out is empathy. I think you need to practise putting yourself in the shoes of the people you do these things to. I used to have a similar problem whereby I would feel that my needs weren't being met and thus, nobody else's needs or feelings mattered. It's not healthy but it doesn't have to be permanent either.  The best thing that worked for me was empathy. When I started to consider what I would want if I were in their situation. Or, how I sometimes WOULD be in their situation and I would be much less tolerant and kind (and WAY more selfish) than they are. Or even sometimes I would imagine they were me and I were them when reflecting back on things I'd done wrong or situations I had manipulated to get myself out of trouble, and I would realise how badly I would have taken my own behaviour etc. It sounds simple because it pretty much is, all it takes is a bit of determination and some practise, really.  Do you struggle with apologies and showing remorse in general? That might be something you could work on too.  As silly as it might sound, just practising these things will make you better at them, it's no different than practising any other skill you might want. The fact that you have recognised it is an incredible feat in itself. And the one real thing that anyone who wants to change needs in order to do so. The people here are right when they say that you've already achieved the first big step.  Don't be too hard on yourself either, that won't help. Now you're being honest with yourself about what you see, just start being honest with others. If they love you now, they will only love you more for your desire to make it better."
selfimprovement,3cnzql,Smartare,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:51:19 2015 UTC,"Funny you should mention empathy. My boyfriend's favourite word is sonder: the realisation that everyone has their own complex life with struggles and whatever. Lately I've been feeling the opposite of that. I've been finding it really hard to think about how other people feel and I think I know why.  My confidence has been pretty low. I felt like my friends and family just tolerate me and started feeling guilty all the time about everything I did. It was really stressful and overwhelming so I decided fuck it I'm just going to worry about myself, I need to look after myself first.   Yeah it's not ideal but that spiral of feeling hopeless, becoming more depressed, accomplishing less, feeling more hopeless etc. was awful. Thank you for reminding me I need to find a balance."
selfimprovement,3cnzql,tiny_meek,2,Fri Jul 10 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Hey. I noticed that I can be pretty manipulative too (and pretty good at it). If I'm in an argument with a loved one I might end up hurting (verbally) the other person by controlling the conversation. The only good solution I have found is that often you kinda realize that you do this and then it can be hard to backtrack but its the only way: for example if you are acting hurt/angry at the other person and you realize you only do this to hurt the other person its best to just be like ""hey, I'm sorry I overreacted and I'm not mad anymore"". Same thing with this: Sorry, I wrote that I wrote I would cut myself it was an overaction. The first couple of times you do this you will end up looking a bit unstable for changing your mind so quick but after a while your mind kinda learns to just do this kinds of manipulations less and less."

But make them realistic, manageable, and enforceable.  So you might have a goal of ""Get 6 pack abs"". Okay good. But is that realistic if you are 5'11 and 265 lbs? Nah. A better goal at this time would be ""Get down to 250 lbs.""   You can also have many goals, but again, make sure they follow that setup. You might be like ""I need to workout today, go to store, drop off dry cleaning, practice a new language, cook myself dinner from scratch, read my book, practice my instrument, get 8 hours of sleep."" Which all can be very valid goals... but is it realistic to expect yourself to be able to do all that every day? Or even all in one day? Rather, break it down... you might not be able to do all that... but you might be able to manage workout, drop off dry cleaning, and cook.  Also, this is important, if you find you aren't reaching your goals, whatever they are, ADJUST THEM. If you start failing at your goals, MAKE THE GOALS EASIER. You want to be able to SUCCEED at them, even if it is kinda ridiculous what you have to do to start succeeding. For example, say you have the goal of writing a page of your 10 page essay due 2 weeks. You find that you are really struggling with writing one page... so change it... be like ""okay, if I write a single paragraph, then I can reward myself by ordering a pizza and playing video games."" It seems like a ridiculously low bar to reward yourself, but you HAVE to start somewhere and be successful. Also you will find that if you do that you will probably end up writing more than JUST a single paragraph once you get started.  Also, if you are starting multiple goals at once, taper them. Get one under your belt before you add another right away. So say your goal is read the newspaper every morning... find the time to get into that habit... and once you establish your routine where reading the paper fits... then add in something like ""do 25 pushups in the morning"" and find out where to add that in. Quick changes tend to not be as solidified as slow gradual changes. So while the results won't be as dramatically fast, they will stick with you if you take your time on each one."

selfimprovement,3citbc,knowledgeisop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"There's a fantasy I've had for a long time that I'll one day be completely free from these kinds of thoughts.   First, you're not alone in having these kinds of thoughts. Facebook is great at making everyone feel this way at some point.   There's a balance to be found between working on yourself so you can be genuinely proud of your life, and accepting these kinds of thoughts and feelings as just a part of accepting yourself as you are now.   You already know that they're not really realistic or rational thoughts. And you know that they'll pass, and you'll have more victories on your journey. Like you say, it's a ""mode"" you get into. So it's okay. Let the thoughts be there, and let them be temporary. Try not to contribute to the hate spiral by blaming yourself for hating yourself.   When you feel yourself slipping into a spiral, you can practice CBT-style intervention (ie. reminding yourself of more rational things that you know to be true, like everyone feels this way sometimes, I'm not alone, I am loved, I have my own goals and victories. It's a good idea to write these down when you're feeling positive to cement them in your mind) or mindfulness-based interventions (ie. using physical sensations like breathing to try and disconnect from the emotional impact of the thoughts altogether). If you practice these interventions it might help you to get over the dips more easily, or to see them coming and head them off.   Know your triggers. If Facebook is a trigger for you, you don't necessarily need to delete it altogether (unless you want to), but it helps to be aware of it - try to stay away from it, but if you do use it and you start feeling like shit, then you can externalise it, blame the trigger, say ""Oh Facebook always makes me feel like this, stupid Facebook!"" and then turn it off and go do something else to distract yourself :)   Also, it might feel like one step forward two steps back right now, but it's probably more like two steps forward and one step back.

selfimprovement,3citbc,drew_tattoo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"If there are certain areas where you feel you are lacking, I'd recommend attempting to improve yourself in those areas. If, for example, you feel less intelligent than other people, get a stack of books and start learning and educating yourself. If you feel unattractive compared to shredded hunks at the gym, then start exercising and eating healthy. Etc.  Start living the lifestyle that you want to live. Ask yourself: what are the things that you want to accomplish? Spend every day striving to become that person.  Continually reflect upon yourself, and find flaws and imperfections. Whichever flaws are capable of being remedied, strive to remedy them. This, it would seem to me, is the very essence of self-improvement.  Additionally, try not to worry so much about how others perceive you. Instead, try to do the things that you think are important and worthwhile.  You must also come to grips with a basic fact about life: there are almost always going to be people that are superior to you in certain areas. Whether we're talking about physical beauty, general intelligence, specific knowledge about a certain field, amount of money, list of accomplishments, etc., there are people alive who have surpassed you in those fields. This shouldn't discourage you; if anything, it should motivate you, because those people are proof that you can better yourself, and you can improve in the areas that you currently are insecure about your success in.  In that sense, comparing yourself to other people can benefit you, not hurt you.   Nobody is perfect. However, we can spend every day bettering ourselves and improving ourselves, allowing us to slowly inch towards becoming the person that we ultimately want to be.  I posted some general advice a few days ago, and many of the points there seem relevant and potentially helpful to your specific situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/3cml5o/several_pieces_of_advice_i_have_for_everybody/"

selfimprovement,3cg7xy,kr8,19,Tue Jul 7 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"From personal experience, I can tell you that I have always assumed this and it has applied exactly zero times. I always assumed if I let them finish and say what they want they'll return the favor but no instead they just assume you don't have anything to say and just keep talking.  The only useful advice I have to OP is that there are different kinds of people, ones that interrupt and ones that let you talk. The only effective ways I've learned to counter people that interrupt is to either call them on it, or literally interrupt them interrupting you by just continuing to talk directly through what they are interrupting you with slightly louder than them."
selfimprovement,3cg7xy,elsimer,7,Tue Jul 7 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"I almost never get interrupted. I'm not a badass super confident public speaking guru or anything. Also I tend to interrupt people a lot myself and I'm trying to cut down on it. But I know what can cause people to interrupt others. My advice:  Be sure you have thought through what you are going to say. That will help you avoid stuttering or long pauses where you try to figure out how to phrase things or remember what you were going to say, which is often where people interrupt. Get to the point quickly or people will start trying to finish your statements for you. And if you and another person start talking at the same time, and you have something you've thought through that you know will be worth listening to, feel free to be the one who keeps talking. Then when you're done but still have people's attention circle back to the other person who was going to say something.  Be sure to give other people the chance to talk once in a while. Otherwise they will just interrupt you when they wanna say a thing.  Also be sure to look at others as the conversation is going and see who seems eager to talk. Right after someone has finished talking at a bit of length and is all talked out is the best time to say something you want to say uninterrupted as they probably don't even have anything to interrupt you with.  Watch how you phrase things. If you use a lot of rhetorical questions, people are going to be answering some of them. If you say ""Hey, remember the thing that happened last month? I think--"" you're practically asking them to start telling you their own thoughts on that subject, not to listen to yours.  Don't forget to listen to people and consider what they say. In a discussion if what you say properly addresses what the other person last said to you, then you are much less likely to be interrupted because the other person feels listened to and like they got their point across. If they don't feel like they did they will interrupt whatever you are saying to clarify their point before the conversation moves in an unwanted direction. Even if what you say has nothing to do with what they were saying, if you can frame it as a response to something they said you are less likely to be interrupted.  Try to be engaging when you're speaking. Use colorful phrases, look people in the eye, use hand gestures if you're comfortable with that. Look at public speaking techniques and apply mini-versions of them. ""Say what you're going to say, then say it, then say what you said."" If you start off with a little hint as to why what you're going to say will be interesting then you are more likely to be listened to. ""Hey that reminds me of this one time when..."" is alright because it shows what you are saying is linked to something the other person said. But something like ""That reminds me of the craziest person I ever worked with..."" tells people you have a particularly interesting and relevant story to tell. Even if it's not amazing it will be elevated above the average chit-chat. Don't go saying this stuff all the time but when you think something is worth a little hype go ahead. Your stories will be better received when nobody interrupts the flow of the narrative and everyone listens to the whole thing, after all.  Lastly, don't interrupt people. If you interrupt others then they'll take that as license to interrupt you, either because they'll think you don't mind or they'll do it to get back at you. It is easy to interrupt people without noticing but still get mad when others do it to you. So pay attention to when you are talking and when other people are!"

There's soo much more that goes into properly holding a conversation.  1 rule though, If people interupt just don't fucking stop talking. This is gonna feel weird, but aslong as you asert yourself, the other person will eventually quiet down.   Many times the persons gonna try to interupt, however as you never let him interupt you with bullshit, hes going to stop doing it, as betas tend not to know how to handle an non verbal power struggle.   The overall view of you and your social status within the grup, Will also influence on whomever the group decide to focus their attention on."
selfimprovement,3cg7xy,Alfapsycho,2,Wed Jul 8 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"One thing I've done, is when someone starts talking over you or interrupts you, look them straight in the eye, and just keep talking. Half the time they will realize they are being rude, the other half its incredibly awkward and obvious to everyone else they are being rude.  If they don't get the hint, you can say something snarky like ""Oh no, please continue""  Then everyone laughs nervously."
selfimprovement,3cg7xy,271828182,3,Wed Jul 8 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"Is it one or two people who keep interrupting you?   Or do you find that lots of people interrupt you?   If it's one or two people, then the problem is likely with them. It is acceptable to interrupt THEIR interruption, and say ""I wasn't finished,"" and then finish your thought. You will no doubt need to do this again and again, which will seem rude to you, but it will get their attention. It's also fine to politely say ""I notice when I am speaking, you interrupt me frequently. I don't like that and I'd like it to stop. Thanks.""   If you find that you are getting interrupted a lot, by all different people, in different situations, then it is likely that you are the problem, and you may be unaware that you're talking too much (forcing people to interrupt you, just to get a word in or to stop you going off on tangents.) In this case, I recommend focusing intensely on removing the words ""I"", ""me"", ""my"" and ""mine"" from your vocabulary. You can't get rid of them entirely, but cut those words out as much as possible.    The simple fact is, and it's hard to understand, but nobody cares about your stories. You're not holding attention,  because people want to be listened to, not talked to.  Practice listening. Ask people for THEIR stories. Ask them follow up questions. Get to know them. Because while they are sharing their stories with you, as you actively listen, you are learning about them. And they are learning about you. And what they are learning is that they like being around you."

If you have something to input, wait for the momentary pause after someone has finished and then add your insight. Starting by saying ""well i think/in my opinion"" will also get people to listen. If you find there's no pauses in the group conversation, well just know there is always an appropriate time to step in. You gotta take the opportunity though. I find that when something comes to my head and I wait too long to say it, the opportunities gone and it becomes too awkward to say what I wanted to before the people are on to the next topic."

selfimprovement,3ch2r9,whoopf,13,Tue Jul 7 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"Been there, done that. It's a real struggle and had a huge grip on me for many years. This idea of seriously desiring a relationship with the belief that it will significantly improve my life in some way because my life right now is somehow lacking or missing some pieces that I can't do without. My mind very cleverly rationalized this in ways such as ""If I had regular sex, then it would boost my mood""... ""the physical contact would give me more oxytocin and I'd be more balanced and focused..."" etc... And frankly, most of these things are true, however, I also used them as excuses in some ways to prevent myself from discovering ways to supplement these needs (for physical touch) with other possible ways besides a ""relationship"".  The way I began to overcome this influence was to actually begin imagining that I already had the relationship and what that would look and feel like. What would I do with her? How often would I see her? What would we talk about? What kind of activities would we be engaged in? And in some ways, I started to appreciate my singleness much more because I realized that I have so much freedom and joy in my life already that I take for granted.  Additionally, ironically, as I began to let go of seeking a relationship (letting go of this neediness and lack), I actually began to feel way more satisfied in my existing friendships and relationships (especially with the women in my life), and noticed that they all began to be much more attracted to me naturally without having to do anything.  The issue as far as I saw it was that there is a hole or need that needs to be fulfilled within you but seeking a relationship is like trying to grasp for a solution outside of yourself which will never leave you fulfilled... instead I shifted my focus within by focusing on myself and my real passions (what turns me on)... and letting that energy radiate out to attract a partner as a result. (Nothing is more sexy than a man who's on purpose and passionate about something) If you're looking for a woman to create this zest for life, it will be short-sighted and leave you ultimately disappointed as I have discovered several times."
selfimprovement,3ch2r9,MorallyQuestionable,4,Tue Jul 7 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a different take on this.   I think that it's actually not a bad thing to use a potential relationship as motivation. We have a drive for companionship, and a powerful, biological sex drive, and these things can power us to be better people.   Think of it - a few decades ago, before internet porn, and Penthouse magazine, if a man wanted to see a naked woman with any regularity, he had to work at it. He had to groom himself, dress appropriately, have income prospects, and develop a good social circle. He'd have to muster up the courage to ask a woman out, then he'd have to plan a date, and work at trying to get a second date (which meant being interesting or funny, and kind and polite.) A woman had to dress well and take care of herself too. Both had to develop skills that would help them with their life goals and family goals. While the desire for marriage, children, a home, and stability were motivating factors, no doubt a HUGE motivating factor was a basic sex drive. Men and women wanted to get it on, and society in those days had an established pattern for getting to that point, and it required a lot of hard work.   Nowadays, we can meet our social needs on Facebook, get instant gratification from ANY kind of sexual thrill we desire on our PCs and phones, and snuggle with our pretty, silent, non-demanding waifus at bedtime. Relationships are practically obsolete.   So...I think that what you are experiencing are normal biological urges fueled, if not by a sex drive, then at least an innate human drive for companionship.    That leads me to another thing, and that is life goals. What's wrong with having a loving relationship as a goal? Just because society (and TV, and ads, and politicians) tell you that you need to make money your lifelong goal doesn't mean it has to be true for you. Your goals are just that - YOUR goals. If finding a person to care about is your goal, I think that is just as worthy as anything else. Maybe more so. So if bending your efforts toward that goal feels right, I don't see a problem with it.   If you feel that this is UNHEALTHILY affecting your life, then there are a few things you can do. You could look at other goals you have, and maybe spend some time and effort on those goals. You can pay closer attention to your activities, and ask yourself if you are doing it for you, or for a potential relationship. You don't have to change your activities - just figure out if it's really benefiting you or not. (For example, if you hate going to bars, but you find yourself in bars just looking for potential girlfriends, that might be an unhealthy use of your time.)   You said this is a childish obsession, but maybe it isn't. Maybe you just need to do some thinking, and maybe journaling, and write out what behaviors may feel childish to you, but what may actually be valid and helpful. Take the judgment and self-blame out of it, and look at it more objectively.   If you want to write, write. There's NOTHING ""unsexy"" about writing. The same goes for archaeology. There ARE female archaeologists, you know (I was an archaeology minor in college, and there was an even mix of men and women in the classes I attended). So pursue YOUR passions, and keep on meeting people. I don't think your desire for a relationship is silly at all. In fact, I have a lot of respect for it."

You're picking up archaeology because you are interested in it and want to know more about what history has done to the earth. So focus on that. University isn't a place for everyone to find a girlfriend or significant other. However, it is a time to experience new things that the independence of going to college allows you to do. Women very rarely help you keep on track while in school because you will be so focused on keeping them happy that you forget to keep yourself happy and forget to focus on what you need to do. Trust me, I've been there. There will still be women for you once you graduate, I promise. But for now, get your priorities in line, make sure you have a good grip on the amount of time you need to study before even thinking about relationships. Think of a relationship as another 16 credits of courses you are taking on top of the ones you are enrolled in for school. The amount of people who marry the girl they meet at uni is very very small. So focus on you first, and if it happens, it happens.  Best of Luck, Shark"

A guy who's really deep and fantastic at expressing himself is what a lot of woman are looking for.   I mean a lot of girls would love a cute guy shyly showing them a first draft of something he's been working on, because he really wants to know what they think about it. Then they get a few lines in and it's not super polished, but they feel a real connection to what he's saying or it makes them laugh. To a lot of women that is more of a panty dropper than six pack abs. Plus it'll probably lead to a more lasting relationship."

Whether it's new classes, a new career, a change in living arrangements - it's stressful.   And it's going to be awesome. Enjoy moving in and making a space your own. Enjoy being with your boyfriend. Enjoy your fun classes!   Issues will come up. There will be fights (some stupid, some not). You'll struggle at times. That is what we adults call ""life"" and it will be a constant for you, because life up until college is a piece of cake, and it's time to get used to facing adversity in the ""real world"". You'll have to learn to deal with stress, and money, and workloads, and living with another human being.    The great thing is, you'll be learning all of this with your parents 10 minutes away, and money to live on, and a fun course load. So for all the fights you'll have (you will) and all of the mistakes you make (you will) and all of the things that go wrong (they will), you have a great safety net. You will be FINE.    This is an adventure! You'll be in college, with a person you love, in your own apartment! LIVE IT UP!   To deal with the anxiety, take deep breaths. Do this 5 - 10 times throughout the day (whether you are anxious or not). Take slow, deep breaths, and feel yourself get calmer with each breath. Everything is okay. You're fine. This is life. You can totally handle this.   Years ago, before my husband (then boyfriend) and I moved in, I was a wreck. I remember having an epic, three-day knock-down, drag-out argument (over phone and email) about whether he would leave the cap off the toothpaste. Not that he DID leave the cap off the toothpaste - but whether he might possibly leave a hypothetical cap off of toothpaste. I USE FLIP-CAP TOOTHPASTE - you can't even leave the cap off.   But that was my anxiety, fixating on the stupidest of stupid things, because I was so nervous and spinning out of control. And we got through it, and we were fine, and soon we were too busy fighting over the dirty dishes to worry about toothpaste. And we got through that too. And we've been married for over a decade, and almost never argue, so things have gone pretty well for us.  They will for you, too. HAVE FUN!"

I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I think girls have a lot more leeway in how they can communicate and act.  If a guy has any kind of lilt at all to his voice, or if his mannerisms are slightly feminine, oftentimes he has to prove he isn't gay often, which I find ridiculous. Girls can compliment other girls on appearance, guys can't without other people commenting."

Stretching certain muscles daily, wearing shoes that fit, sitting in a chair that supports your back, these are all going to do so much more for your posture than an hour of cardio is going to do every day."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,TheDebaser,3,Mon Jul 6 10:14:52 2015 UTC,"All true, but I was talking more about weightlifting and strength than cardio. Deadlifts and various core/back exercises should help you sit up straighter without even thinking about it.

You need to find inner strength and through that you will project confidence. Finding inner strength is the hardest task a man can get, but what choice do you have? This is the curse of life.   Not that I've read much psychology but I can recommend you reading Nathaniel Branden, ""Honoring the self"". Also, try looking into mindfulness meditation, Zen and all that stuff, might give you something."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,dolphinesque,2,Mon Jul 6 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. confidence can be achieved by faking it. There is an expression, ""fake it till you make it"". When you fake confidence, you enter a social situation and deal with it as IF you are confident, you often find that people respond as if you are confident. Your social interaction is successful, and that gives you a boost of REAL confidence that helps you next time."

Not saying though that one shouldn't interact with others, but trying to fake it up to the top of the social hierarchy even though you suffer from anxiety must be the worst idea ever... Interact with others, but do it in an honest way."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,dolphinesque,2,Mon Jul 6 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"It's what worked for me. I went from being so socially awkward I would fake injuries just to get out of going to lunch with a friend, to planning and hosting networking receptions and social events for hundreds of people.   If you're shy and socially awkward, you're not going to wake up one morning and NOT be. It's not like you'll read a book or two and suddenly be brimming with the confidence you've never had. Reading, talking online or to a therapist can help, but in the moment when it's you, in a room, with a few other people, and they're looking at you, it's not like in that moment you're like ""I read three books and got great online advice, LET'S DO THIS!"" Of course not. You'll be just as scared and intimidated as you always were. So, you practice. Even though every instinct in your body is telling you to flee, you force yourself to smile (the whole time thinking ""this looks so fake, this looks SO fake.""). Then you take a deep breath and say ""Hi."" And someone else says hi, and you can't think of a single passage in any book that can save you, your heart is pounding, you are terribly uncomfortable. You manage to blurt something out, anything, something stupid about the weather, and you feel like an idiot. But then the other person smiles, and says something, like ""Yeah, this rain has been rotten, I work outside, it's been a pain to deal with."" And there it is - a little hook you can build on. ""Outside, huh? What do you do?"" And then they answer. And then you ask another question. And they answer that, and then ask about you. And soon you're going back and forth, asking questions, getting to know someone, having an actual conversation.   But until you practice, and fail, and practice some more, and realize that having a conversation is really not the terrifying thing your mind has built it up to be, there's no way to overcome that lack of confidence. You have to fake it, even if it's just to get your foot in the door. Otherwise you'll never be confident enough to even get the practice."

selfimprovement,3ca77n,DeusEx_OrdoAbChao,2,Mon Jul 6 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"Find a male figure, movie star, athlete, whoever portrays the type of confidence you would like to show. Look at how the sit, how they walk and how they interact with people, they way they smile, when they smile, how close they sit.. then practice, practice each small step, whether at home, study, work. Speak to yourself in the manner you would like to speak to someone else. When you go through a fast food  place, ask the person how they are, speak to them, compliment them on something you like about them. If they are wearing a nice ring, say "" wow cool ring mate"". Just speak to people with no motive other than to be a genuinely nice person. When you are out about look around and see who you deem to be confident, and who you deem to be arrogant, what are the confident people doing and what are the arrogant people doing. Copt the confident ones. Also find what makes you confident, everyone has there own thing. You need to find yours. You giggle like a girl? Fucking own it, who cares, your giggle is you, own who you are and your confidence will come.   I have also found that a lot of people with mental health issues or social anxiety try and hide them selves, they try and shrink down so that no one seems them and they develop poor posture as as result. Just stand up tall. When you sit, sit relaxed like you are at home, but sit up tall. Everyday look at yourself in the mirror, not in a vain sense, but look at yourself and see what you like and what you don't like, if you see yourself slouching then stand up tall, if you see where you can improve your muscle physique then work on that, you need to know your weaknesses in order to improve them. Looking at yourself everyday, even if you hate the person that is looking back at you.. why do you hate them? work that out, accept what you do not like and then you can fix it."

selfimprovement,3ca77n,thedorkening,2,Mon Jul 6 11:57:31 2015 UTC,"I have something that worked for me for social anxiety.  First a little backstory, my wife had severe social anxiety and I followed her lead.  After 13 years, I was afraid to go into a store, go for walks or anything.  If there was people around we normally went somewhere else.  Back in 2012 that all changed.  I won't go into the why here but it was bad.    So here I was, alone and severely overweight (Still am but working on it) and I was in a dark place.  I basically told myself I can either curl up and die or get out there and experience life.  I decided to live and made a pact with myself - if I am in a spot where I would say ""NO"" to something, I was REQUIRED to say ""YES"".  This lead to me going to a farmers market with my sister.  I was terrified but I did it and it was awesome.  and I kept on doing it.  I lost over 100 pounds (Still got a long way to go) and I have no fear of going places.  No more parking in front of a place and waiting for someone to leave to enter, no fearing if someone would make fun of me, no fearing the judgement of people.  I am at the point where I don't give a shit.  I can go to the movies by myself, I have even gone to a restaurant alone.  I hope this helps the anxiety, I think once you conquer that, a lot of the other stuff will follow.  Since then, I met an amazing woman and we go out and do things, we enjoy life and I am rarely home.  This weekend was the first weekend we stayed in in a long time."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,AcropolisScholars,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"I would recommend two things: work on just focusing on good posture (i.e. stand up straight and keep your shoulders back), and remain mindfully engaged in whatever it is you are doing. This will help you overcome some of the anxiety and nervousness and allow you to become a little more authentic (the source of good masculine charisma).   I also recommend you spend some time reading and meditating on the writings of Marcus Aurelius, which should be available in your native language."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,ProfessionalGeek,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Just a couple quick things I've done and seen success with here. One, just try to constantly remind yourself about posture. Sit up straight, shoulders back, etc. The more often you remember to fix your posture, the more often it will come naturally. Doing yoga and meditating can add some extra posture training for you. Second, focus on how you are walking to add more confidence in your step. Instead of leading with a front foot in each step, consciously push with your back foot for each step. This adds a little bounce to your step and helps you exude confidence. As for a facial expression, choose what you think is best, but I've personally had more success trying to have a more smiley cheerful face rather than a stern/disinterested resting face."

selfimprovement,3ca77n,ZugTheMegasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"struggling with severe OCD, Depression and Social Anxiety   I know this all too well; had all three since childhood.  Right now, your instinct is to play to your anxiety, and that's the wrong way to go. It's super common for people like us to make this mistake, and I can point to exactly where you're doing it:    I have seen that the way I carry myself is a total drain on confidence, self-worth, abnormal and ugly.   It is so tempting to find causes for severe social anxiety. We look around, and everybody else seems to only be nervous when they're supposed to be, while we're at near-panic all the time. So we try to emulate them and hope that then we'll be as confident as they are.  But that's not the case when it comes to mental illness. You are not anxious because of anything you're doing. You're not anxious because of how you stand or because people on the street don't think you're cool enough. You are anxious for no good reason, because it's irrational and caused by a disorder, and the urge to keep changing yourself is an attempt to control it. (And OCD will exacerbate this.) ""If I just do X enough, then I'll be good enough to be happy."" It's a lie you don't even realize you're telling yourself.  First and foremost, if you aren't receiving treatment for your illnesses, that needs to be your first priority. If you're already working on getting a handle on that, then you need to stop thinking about the sort of image you want to portray and start learning to like who you are already.  Read through your post again and you'll see that the problems you describe are internal (confidence, self-worth) while the things you want to learn are external (giving off the appearance of being cool).    If you want to be liked by others, you have to lead by example. You have to like you first. You need to believe that you're the kind of person people want to be around, and when you lack self-confidence and self-esteem, you don't believe that."
selfimprovement,3ca77n,gucci2shoes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"My best friend had the same problems with his self-image, but here are some of the things he did and I observed. I actually admire him for changing himself the way he did; you can see how much happier of a person he is.   I got him a membership at a local gym and got him to exercise. I was going through a depressive episode and I used exercise as a means of lifting myself out of it. We both went to the gym pretty regularly, but I eventually stopped because school got in the way. He... Didn't.   In fact, he became stronger and more toned than I ever was, he started walking around with more confidence, he would talk to people without any problems and he was actually getting the attention of attractive women. It was a complete transformation after a few months.   The thing is, he had to fight through his anxiety. Frequently, he'd tell me about his insecurities and I'd have to reassure him that it wasn't as he perceived it and tried to  make him understand that it was really all in his head. He's still waging war with his inner demons it seems, but he's winning battle by battle.   My advice would be: go to the gym, it does wonders for your ego and studies have shown how it can alleviate symptoms of depression as well. Seems like a win-win! Also, contact any friends and family for their support. It takes time, but it's so with it."

First one would be, just be yourself, find people who enjoy the way you are, sharing your humor or lack off haha. And the only chance to find people like that is well, being yourself.  Second one is, stay shy, controll yourself and avoid awkward moments and live a relatively normal life :D  And in third place, you could stop giving fcks about what other people think. It feels like no matter what way you end up going, you are not happy. And that seems to be the case because you weigh others opinions about yourself too high.  I was quite lucky to find friends who share my humor, as random as it may be. But I don't behave the same towards anyone, its not black and white.

For example, setting up my bills to be paid automatically out of my bank account, pre-planning and packaging meals for the week, that kind of thing.   You may need a sleep study. I was exhausted all the time, and it turned out I had sleep apnea. I would have sworn I was sleeping well, and soundly, every night. At the end of my sleep study, the tech asked me how many times I woke up during the night. I said ""None, I slept the night through."" In actuality, I woke up over eighty times. Getting treated for sleep apnea changed my life.  Just a suggestion."

selfimprovement,3c3ovf,i-strugglewith-women,16,Sat Jul 4 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a music teacher with quite a bit of vocal experience.   I'm gonna start you out saying that if you are looking to lower the tone of your voice from a tenor to bass, you just can't do that for your speaking voice.   Your body was crafted how it was crafted. You can extend your vocal range with practice but speaking is your bodies comfortable resting point. Trying to change that would be akin to doing awkward stretches wherever you go to be taller. It's just going to exhaust you and make you seem insecure and fake.   If you want more confident power in your speaking voice, I can help with that.   Breathe with your gut. Your shoulders should never move up and down when breathing period. That's an unnatural habit learned in childhood that results in quiet speaking and just shallow weak breaths in general. Put your fist on your belly button and try taking a deep breath to move it forward. Then inward on the release.   That's breathing from the diaphragm. It's what your body was designed to do and how you breathe when you sleep.   Practice doing your ""normal"" breathing patten with your diaphragm. Doesn't have to be deep breaths.   Once that becomes a more natural thing for you, then focusing on voice excersizes. Look up ""range extension"" videos on YouTube and ""siren warm ups.""  learning to sing will help you the most. You need to project, using air from your diaphragm, and have better diction. Both of those are goals of singers and actors. Also, getting in front of people, while nerve wracking, will help get more confidence in your voice and personality.   Good luck. It's easier and cheaper to do than you think. If you do take up singing, find your vocal range. And practice songs by signers in that range at first.   Own your voice. Don't be ashamed by where it's at. Make where it's at something to be proud of."

selfimprovement,3c3ovf,250lespaul,2,Sat Jul 4 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"Again, you can't change what your resting point is at. Unless you seriously damage it. Up or down. I would say having confidence in who you are is more important than sounding one way or the other.   Extending vocal range is one thing. That's how far your vocal chords can stretch. But once they are done stretching they will always return back to the same area. Nothing aside from maybe hormone therapy can even slightly change that."

Don't overdo it, you can really hurt yourself. Practice this every single day.  When you feel like you're ready (after a week or two) keep doing the same thing, but with your head tilted back so that you're looking at the sky. This will REALLY stretch out your vocal chords.

If you are feeling ashamed of your voice, that will have a physical effect on your body. If you've felt that way for years, that's going to have had a lasting effect on you - one that will have to be corrected with physical exercise and stretching.  Along with that, you will have to accept your voice for what it is. You have to be objective about it in order to improve quickly.  If you want a loud voice, learn to sing.  You can join a choir, do karaoke, take vocal lessons, get drunk on St. Patrick's day, or make Christmas carol videos with you and your SO and post them to Facebook just to annoy the shit out of your friends because we all know you secretly want to go viral and that would make you sooooo popular wouldn't it?  Having a technical skill over your voice is going to help a lot - in whatever way you decide to go about acquiring that skill.  The most difficult part is still going to be acceptance. That's what it is for most people. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. He teaches how to remain present in the moment, to rise above thought, and to accept reality for what it is."

You need to realise that you can't change overnight. Despite the hollywoodian interpretation of things you can't just decide one day to change and do it. I feel you, I've been there. And you need to realise what you really want, that's the hard part. For instance I thought I wanted to be a psychologist, but after some late nights thinking really hard about it I've realised I just wanted to feel accepted, to feel good about myself when telling people what I do and not the actual material. Seeing how self loathing you seem to be I believe you're just rushing into doing something just for the sake of not being a ""failure"".

I also know that procrastination and low motivation can also be due to underlying problems, like depression.  The problem is, my parents don't really believe in the disorder. They said I should meditate or exercise if I really feel like something is off, but even the motivation to do either of them is lacking.

You just need to get over that initial hump.  I would also recommend taking low starting standards. For instance, if you want to start drawing you should tell yourself that you only need to draw for 5 minutes and then you can do whatever the heck you want. Everyone can draw for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, your emotions will adapt and you'll (hopefully) want to continue drawing. Bam. You'll have effectively tricked your brain.

What about enjoying the process?  You can't just obsess over how good you'll be someday, but enjoy the doing itself.  The trick is that people who like what they're doing naturally do it more... and thereby get better faster.  And don't worry about how ""good"" what you produce is... A great artist friend told me that the key to improving is to stop freaking out about what others would consider mistakes.  I also agree looking into adhd might be worthwhile.  Sounds familiar...  working consistently was so hard for me at first and it took awhile to change. I find listening to music while I work is a MUST for staying motivated. Also,     having a dedicated work station - an ""art desk"" that you ONLY use for art stuff-- makes a massive difference. Finally, go easy on yourself!

No matter how angry you get, how much you want it, you can't change the past. Sitting around and beating yourself up about it only wastes time and energy. Accept that you are where you are, forgive yourself for not getting to where you'd like to be, and be serene.  The far future, 10 years from now? Also largely beyond your control. Not completely, but it's pretty damn distant. It's like the song - que sera sera, whatever will be will be, the future's not ours to see, que sera sera. Be serene in the knowledge that you might have a brain aneurism tomorrow and die, rendering all plans moot.  The only thing you can actually change? Right now. Have the courage to go outside, or least away from your computer and start doodling. Knowing that in your eyes you're going to suck, and that you may not follow up tomorrow.

selfimprovement,3c03tz,Speckles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with how to help people at my job improve for the past year. I work with mostly 18-20 year olds, and it is usually very hard to have a successful shift where I feel like I've made a positive difference in their enjoyment of work. Lately, however, I've actually felt better about most of my shifts. I was wondering why, and I think recently I figured it out.  I've been playing street fighter for about 6 years and still struggle almost every time I play. I still feel like I'm nowhere near where I want to be skill-wise! But I've been reading a book called Mindset by Carol Dweck, and i also read The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle. These books helped me to realize that Street fighter has actually improved my work at my job. Going online to look up new combos and watching tournament play have helped immensely, but only because I go into training mode and practice at least once a week. Instead of believing that my hands were the problem, or that the professionals are just that much better than I am, I keep going until I can hit the combo 10 times in a row.  Yesterday I realized that I'm not only practicing my street fighter skillz, but I'm getting countless reps of looking for new and different tools to use! At work I've been looking for different ways to explain why it's better to stay busy when the store is slow, and the biggest problem worker finally understands that if she stays moving, she can still socialize, but won't feel rushed or tired when customers come into our store. She also can take more pride in her work because the store actually feels clean and she knows that it's because of her.  My point is that if you find something that you truly enjoy, that challenges you and something in which you want to improve, it will leak into other aspects of your life. If you browse the Internet looking for different art styles, do it 100%! But you have to try to pick up at least one aspect every time you browse. It doesn't happen in one day, but you can accelerate your learning by practicing properly (The Talent Code) and believing that you actually want to and can improve (Mindset).  Once you learn how to practice new skills and look for new ones, your interests may (read: will) change to something else that may be more important to you, like getting in shape or improving at your job.  If you want to read either of these books but don't have the money or otherwise don't have access to them, PM me and I can give you access to my audible account. All I can do is give you the tools, all you have to do is try your hardest to use one thing from these books daily.  I hope this helps! Just remember, It won't happen overnight, but it won't happen at all unless you put these into action regularly. Good luck!"

I would try out a different hairstyle. It makes you look quite young. Either grow it out and add layers for some volume, or cut it back to an inverted bob would probably suit you.  Also, dressing feminine would do wonders for you. You have a girlish figure, but you straighten yourself out with the blocky clothing rather than accentuating your curves. The way I try to assemble clothing is wear one tight item and one loose item to accentuate either the ass or the boobs or the waist/hip ratio at a time.   You have dark eyes like myself. I would suggest trying white eyeliner on the inside corner of your eye to really bring them out like this. It really makes my eyes pop and I am sure you would feel the same way.

selfimprovement,3c1b71,MJDEATH,3,Fri Jul 3 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"You look beautiful. You really do.   I'm not sure what kind of ""look"" you are going for. For example, if you were really into punk and hard music, I'd recommend shaving the sides of your head, or coloring it blue or purple. If you are really into high fashion, I'd recommend a trend-setting haircut, and expensive designer clothes. If you are into athletics, then I'd say cut your hair shorter for a sportier look. You get the idea.   We don't know you. There are a million ways you could change your appearance. But there's a trap there. Because unless you are happy within yourself, then no matter what you look like on the outside, you will never be satisfied. You can get a haircut you love, but you'll fret about your clothes. You can spend thousands on a well-tailored wardrobe, then you'll fret about your facial features. You can have plastic surgery, then you'll stay up all night worried that your boobs are too big or too small. There will never be an end to your dissatisfaction.   And every advertisement, commercial, and many TV shows and movies love it that way. The more we dislike ourselves, the more we'll spend on gadgets, pills, and food to make us feel better. Have you ever watched a devastating story on the news? Immediately after, a McDonald's commercial comes on promising us a delicious McFlurry to make us feel better.   So while I understand that you want to change, I am telling you that you are beautiful AS YOU ARE, and the idea that you need to be ""better"" is a lie that is so ingrained in you that you probably aren't even reading this anymore."

I find this very attractive but it's not me -> Trashbin.   IRL I am very interested into geeky stuff. I'm a huge video games player, I really like new tech and eSport. I appreciate having a healthy lifestyle, although I'm not very sportive. I would describe myself as an artist, but definitely, my old jeans covered by paint and glue are not attractive at all. I really like Blackmilk clothing but it's a bit eccentric (I going back to France soon and here, if you wear something not like everyone else you're considered as a weirdo and you'll be trashtalked in the street. Wish I could stay living in London, people are so open minded there).   For the second part of what you've said, I definitely agree, but there's something you don't get. For few years, I've tried to be the uglier I could. No eyebrow waxing, no makeup, fucking ugly clothes... I did this because I wanted people to like me not because I am pretty (I feel unattractive, that doesn't mean I am ugly. I don't have major physical problem making me ugly, I just don't find myself attractive) but for what I am. But how do you want people to like you if you can't even like yourself? I'm tired to be voluntarily unattractive. It's not society, it's only me: I've chose to reject that idea that appearance is key in life and today I'm paying it high price. But I have no idea how to be attractive, that's why I'm here.  I don't know if it makes sense, but there's a reason I have specifically asked for advice and not for the ""LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU ARE"" bullshit.

My stocky thighs and potbelly are still there, but now I werk dat shit, ha!  You can only change your physical appearance if a) you know exactly what you want to change, and what you want to look like and b) have money and time to do it. You can exercise on the cheap, but anything else is harder. Instead, figure out the sort of person you would want to look like, and emulate that style. You might find it's not your appearance you hate, but you've just not found the look that feels right for you. In ""fashionable"" dresses and the like, I look like the dorkiest 12 year old nerd; in my thrift store skinny jeans with my piercings and undercuts, I look like the art-school punk I've always felt like, and my style makes me feel attractive no matter how much my uneven boobs and the rest annoy me. >:D"

selfimprovement,3c2mfk,nesshie91,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:09:35 2015 UTC,"This is terrible advice. The metric by which we measure the amount of knowledge we've acquired should not be the sheer number of books we've read. I constantly catch myself being guilty of this pattern of thought: counting how many pages I read in an hour, how much I read in a day, etc.  What matters is not the volume of text you have read. What matters is how much information you have acquired in the smallest amount of time. The two may seem the same, but they're in fact very different things.  The key to acquiring information is staying focused and eliminating distractions. For those with very cluttered minds, mindfulness meditation may help.  I read every single book cover to cover, at least the first time; I read every single word of every book. What I do is highlight as I read. Depending upon the quality of the content, I may highlight anywhere from 5–95% of the text. In order to save time, I don't actually highlight everything. I instead mark the beginning of the section to read next time and mark the end of the section with a brief highlight.  Then, when you go back to re-read the book, you've highlighted the information that you've deemed worthy of learning (which, again, could be anything from just a bit to almost all of the text, depending upon its quality.) If you're a non-fiction reader, this is the best way to do it, IMO.  If you're a fiction reader, however, this may not be worth pursuing."

I'm 24 and my hair is thinning and it depresses the shit out of me. I psycho-analyze my hair everyday, I stare and get jealous of people with lush thick hair, I hate on myself and blame my genes for my hair loss daily. But recently, I've had a thought come into my mind. My only problem isn't just hair, my issue is about self image. I find ALL of me ugly. I'm fat (40 lbs over weight), I have a lot of body hair which I should be trimming, my wardrobe is as old as huge hefner and I hate the way i dress.   So i came to realize that just getting a fresh head of hair won't cut it for me. I lack confidence. I need to build it. I'm only 24 and its time I do something about my self image. Hence i started losing weight, i feel much better already. It all comes down to working with what you have brother. How are other areas of your aesthetics? Do you need to lose weight? Gain wieght? Need a new wardrobe? Etc. My advise would be to build your over all self image, I'm sure in my case - after having a six-pack, being shredded and dressing like a GQ model, this hair loss issue will seem trivial."
selfimprovement,3byw6b,lucky001,3,Fri Jul 3 11:04:06 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for reaching out.  You have a great point, the overall self image; unfortunately, although I do think I could work on it, I don't dislike the rest of my body with maybe the exception of my ears at times.   I've always been pretty healthy, I've been working out most of the year for over 10 years now, I eat healthy, and I am in good shape because of it.  I like my face, and enjoy my personality - my problem is pretty much zeroed in on my head, and the scar, and the remnants of a failed transplant procedure.  I guess my hair cut does make me feel much older just because I have a weird version of that grandpa bald side hair look.    There have definitely been times where I get so fed with judging myself, I just say fuck it and it produces this ""don't care"" attitude for a week, maybe two if I'm lucky but it never lasts and the torment always comes back - especially if I see a bad photo of myself or didn't like what I saw in the mirror, or whatever.    I regret getting the hair procedure because I can't shave my head now, and I'm ashamed of it.  It's quite obvious what I had done, and even more it reflects to others poor decision making on my part, and also reveaIs that I care too much about what I look like - that I let my happiness depend on something so mundane.  People and family say things, honest things, that at times I wish I didn't hear - most of it is not intentional but just a reaction to what is without thinking through what they are saying and how it could effect me.    For example, my aunt, the sweetest lady you'll ever meet, said something that really stuck with me in a bad way.  At the time, I had just shaven my head and to my knowledge no one in my family (or friends) really knew about my transplant procedure except for a select few, and I was pretty low at the time because the scar was so ugly and huge, and I was embarrassed at what I had done to myself.  I dreaded having to go to a family event with my newly shaved Frankenstein head bc no one knew about it, and I would have to address why I had massive scar on the back of my head and I didn't want all that attention.  So, I took a picture of my scarred head in a mirror and group texted it to my whole extended family - explaining what I had done to get it out of the way.  This relieved some anxiety but my cousin, my aunts son, was basically in the same boat that I was with regards to losing hair, and my aunt - not thinking, group replied saying how awful it was and began forbidding her son from ever getting a hair transplant procedure bc it would mutilate his head (she replied in all caps.)  I mean I'm not saying she was wrong for saying that, she was just looking out for her son, but I'm the one stuck with this problem permanently and it just reinforced what I was already thinking about myself.  (FYI these days, the old way of doing transplants with a strip scar is beginning to fade, and now they do a method where there is no scarring at all - another thing I regret not doing for obvious reasons).  That was just one example of someone speaking bluntly in front of me about what a mistake it was or how bad it looked.  Other examples are more subtle but equally as painful.  As crazy as it sounds, part of me found comfort in hearing such harsh truths about my appearance because they affirmed that I wasn't completely insane for thinking such horrible thoughts about how it looked - they were saying the same thing I was thinking and it wasn't just in my head.  But that was a two edged sword because it also affirmed the reality of the situation.    If I was you, I would just buzz your hair and keep it as short as possible if not completely shave it and get used to your new identity.  But maybe listening to me isn't the best idea.  I'm sorry you have to go through this too.  My heart is with you.  You sound like you have it figured out, and that makes me happy."

At 21 and a 'party', what would it be? Drunk and loud? Jumping off of the roof? Flashing?  I've always worked on what I describe as ""the ambassador"" (this would be for more adult parties) where I can go around to anyone, talk with them and be personable. And be a person that knows how to make a person feel better for our conversation.  I don't know exactly what payoff you're looking for (every action has a payoff). Life of the party is somewhat shallow because it's essentially wanting people to be quite approving of you and seeking you out. Which means, you're seeking their validation.  Not to condescend, but maybe in 5 years you'll realize seeking out this validation isn't really helping with the bigger picture; such as being happy."
selfimprovement,3bvhm0,pearlsbswine,21,Thu Jul 2 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"I'm interesting enough   Are you really? I'm not asking to mock, I'm asking objectively.  Take a look at your hobbies, interests and experiences.  You have to take on a Hobby (or hobbies) that challenge you physically (basketball, snowboarding, etc.), mentally (chess tournaments, coding, reading self-improvement books, etc.) and creatively (creating music, singing, drawing, painting, etc.). The 3 categories can also combine for certain activities such as dancing (physical & creative) and martial arts (physical, mental, creative), etc. Basically, hobbies are activities that add some sort of value to your life. Participate in these activities at least once a week. Isn't it more attractive to say that you went snowboarding over the weekend instead of just staying in and reading? Note: Don't count ""weightlifting"" or ""fitness"" as a physical hobby. It is not interesting in terms of social value. It's become a very popular 'past-time' and is considered more like a 'norm' so-to-speak. That being said, if you're not lifting weights, you should start now. I notice that you're a girl, but trust me, lifting weights doesn't make you bulky. You'd have to try REALLY HARD to get bulky.  Your Interests have no value but are interesting on their own. Examples are video games, TV shows, movies, politics, reddit, etc. They're simply there so you can use them for conversation. Be careful of when you talk about your interests, as not all interests are created equal.  Experiences are pretty self-explanatory. Explore the world. Go on a cruise, go sky diving, travel the world, eat new foods, meet new people, etc.  This is how you become interesting.  As for the social aspect of parties, you must walk in with an energy level slightly above the rest of the crowd. You can't walk in with an energy level TOO high, otherwise you'll just appear obnoxious and be unwanted. But if your energy level is slightly below, you'll just seem boring. If your energy level is TOO low, you'll just appear very negative, and no one wants to be around the party-pooper. Having an equal energy level as the crowd just makes you blend in.  Last but definitely not the least: Take plenty of pictures of yourself participating in your hobbies and experiences. You have to let people know that you're having fun. People are attracted to FUN people. So show them. Oh, and surround yourself with other fun people. Get rid of the boring prudes and ""politically correct"".   Just remember: There's a time and place to be mature and immature.   EDIT:  I'll use myself as an example.  Male, 23 yrs old.  Hobbies:   Physical: Martial arts (I'm a black belt with 6.5 years of training in two martial arts, Hapkido and Escrima). I said not to list going to the gym as a hobby, but I can't not mention it without being hypocritical to my username. Mental: I like to read self-improvement books, business books and sociology/psychology books. I like to dissect social interactions and do so almost every time I socialize. Creative: I sing. I also like to write (not music).   Interests:   Game of Thrones Video games (although I don't play video games as much as I used to. I stopped the bad habits about a year ago). Sociology/Psychology (this subject can go hand-in-hand with the mental, as people like talking about relationships, both platonic and romantic with me). Listening to music, RnB, Hip Hop, Rock, EDM, etc. Anything but country. Yuck! Fashion. Yeh, /r/malefashionadvice is pretty dope. I like the 'classy-casual' look for work as well as the 'streetwear' for when I'm out and about, and often change between these styles.   Experiences:  Now here is where I'm lacking. But the lack of experiences isn't really due to me not wanting to do something, but rather job and $ constraints (I work full-time as a Junior Designer, creating 3D computer generated models of car parts and 2D 'blueprints' of them).   Been to a few cruises. Traveled to my home country in Asia for a month. Did a TON of things there, actually. I go clubbing often. I go to karaoke bars often. I take road-trips to cities a few hours away with friends pretty often (once or twice a month?) I'm actually about to go on my longest road trip today (16+hr drive!) to Florida."

Generally speaking, the people who do interesting things are people who really care about something- an activity, a cause, or a particular goal.   I took a class in college called Passion Based Leadership, which was founded on helping the students answer questions:  1) Who are you?  2) What do you care about?  3) What change do you want to make in the world?   Those are some good questions to start with to uncovering a motivation that will have you find success AND be someone people are interested in knowing when you're 30.   Some other good questions are:  What makes you come alive?  What's the most interesting thing that you do?  What do you do that no on else does?"

I dated one guy who was so funny and charming that not only did I want to jump on his fat, short, pale, balding body every second, but to this day I am residually attracted to guy who look like him.  (Before him I pretty much only dated 6'4"" toned babes.)    Make her blush and the work is done."

selfimprovement,3btudt,Life-in-Death,2,Thu Jul 2 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Haha I've heard that story from a lot of girls, how they met a guy who was charming and funny and they couldn't get their mind off them. Once people start talking to me they tell me I'm charming or teasing, but the only thing is that the people who see that side of me are the people that I actually get to talk to. On first glance I feel like I look like an average nerdy kid but then once they get to know me I become that fun guy. I guess what I'm more looking for is a way to get that initial first impression down."
selfimprovement,3btudt,dolphinesque,9,Thu Jul 2 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"The confidence IS the physical attractiveness.  Usually I would look for certain things in a man - smiling, sense of humor, decently-groomed, great-smelling, and polite and kind to others (but not a doormat).   Don't worry about calling yourself shallow. The simple fact is that people like what they like. It is absolutely reasonable and fine for you to desire sexual intimacy with someone you are with. That's not shallow, that is often part of the reason we want to be with someone romantically. If someone is not interested in having sexual experiences with you, that is 100% fine and their choice - and it means that they aren't a match for you, and there's nothing shallow about that. We're all entitled to need what we need in a relationship, and if the other person isn't on board with that, that's okay - it just means we aren't a match.  It's not really a great idea to stay with someone you're not compatible with. You clearly needed more from your last relationship. Some people just aren't into sex - that is totally fine. And they need to find a partner who is also not into sex, or is fine with having a non-sexual relationship. Since that's not you, it is perfectly acceptable to say ""Sexual intimacy is a big part of a relationship to me. It's by no means the only part, but if you're not looking for sex as part of a relationship, then let's stick to just being friends, since we wouldn't be compatible."" That's not shallow, that's honesty.   If a woman wanted a relationship with the goal of getting married and having children, it's not shallow of her to say ""You don't want marriage and kids? Then I guess we can't be together."" It's not personal at all. It's 2 people with different relationship needs.   When you are meeting people, or flirting, sometimes it helps to ""act as if"". Act as if you are James Bond (or whatever smooth, confident character you'd love to be). I like James Bond because he's polite, charming, and well-groomed, while also being confidently flirtatious, with a hint of mystery. And it's not about the looks. I watched Skyfall again recently, and Daniel Craig is never in 1,000 years a man whom I would consider attractive (to me). He is absolutely not my physical type, at all. But as James Bond, he is so damn smooth, that his physical looks don't matter to me, and I am drawn in by his charm.   It sounds like you are doing everything right. Dressing well, having a flattering, well-maintained hairstyle, going to the gym, these are all awesome things. Try a few samples of cologne when you go out to see if you can find a scent you love, some women (like myself) are absolutely insane for a great-smelling guy. I have dated men based on their scent alone. Don't swim in cologne - let a woman lean in to get a good sniff. :)"
selfimprovement,3btudt,dolphinesque,3,Thu Jul 2 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"This helps a lot, thank you!  The bit about incompatibility really hit me. It's something I wish I had learned way earlier, just to save both me and my ex-gf a lot of trouble. I didn't want to come off as a guy who was looking only for sex, and as a result ended up negating my own needs.  The ""not a doormat"" comment is one thing I do have trouble with. I tend to be a pushover (if my 2.5 year relationship with someone I wasn't compatible with says anything, haha) and put others before myself way too often. I've been trying to stop that, but I feel like I'm starting to drift too far into becoming an asshole, the player type that doesn't really care what a girl thinks and feels, and I DON'T want to become that.  I've been told I'm charming, I'm genuine, I'm sincere, I'm nice... But I think I've been too much of it because I portray it as my only qualities. I don't want to be just that genuine, dependable guy--too honest, too genuine. I want to be a guy that someone looks at and thinks ""He looks like he can be fun to be with."" To me it's all about first impressions, and first impressions are almost always what people see. I want to be the perfect balance between the sweet, genuine guy and the fun, mysterious type."
selfimprovement,3btudt,MorallyQuestionable,2,Thu Jul 2 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"I have similar qualities to you. I'm a woman but I am a people-pleaser, and I'm not as assertive as I want to be (but getting better).  You have to be careful not to fall into the trap of being what you think others want you to be. Many of us have this idea that ""If I can hide my flaws and be a nice person, then I'll be rewarded with attention, respect, and love."" We want to please people, so we hide our own needs, to try to play a role of the ""nice person"". What you needed was sexual attention, but you hid that need out of a fear of being perceived as shallow. While your intentions were noble, in the end, it was just pure dishonesty and that's a relationship killer. It's not fair to your partner to portray the ""nice"" side of yourself, when that is not your true self.   So the key in moving forward id to be honest, with yourself, as well as others. Instead of thinking ""I'm not that into this person, but if I don't ask her out again, she'll be devastated, so I'll tell her I had a great time and ask her out again so she'll think I'm not a shallow guy,"" you need to be honest. ""I'm just not attracted to her in that way. A second date would just be dishonest. She won't like it if I tell her I'm not interested in another date, but sometimes in life, we have to hear things we don't want to hear, and it's not anyone's fault. She deserves the respect of the truth."" It also helps to ask yourself ""What would a person with honor and integrity do here?"" A person with honor and integrity would not string a woman along under false pretenses. They would say ""I had a good time, and you're a sweet person. I didn't feel the connection between us that I'm really looking for in a potential partner, but I wish you all the best in your future."" That's direct, and tactful, and respectful.    Good luck!"
selfimprovement,3btudt,MorallyQuestionable,6,Thu Jul 2 15:33:46 2015 UTC,"You remind me a lot of what I was going through at your age and for most of my early 20's and couldn't figure out this whole balance between ""nice"" and ""attractive"". Needless to say, I've noticed a few trends and issues and have made peace with the fact that not many women find me sexually attractive and want to jump my bones despite how much I may want it or express it to them.  The approach for most people teaching seduction (PUA) and the advice I got from some close friends that are quite experienced with women all tell me to be more direct and clear about my intentions, ask for the date, and if she is not interested after the first date just forget about her and don't ever talk to her again. To them it's an ""all or nothing"" approach with very clear outcomes in mind; if she's not interested in sex/relationship, then she has no place in their lives.   The concept of having deeply nourishing connections with female friends doesn't really resonate with them as much as it does for me; in fact most of my friends are women who I spend time with regularly and have very satisfying emotional connections (deeper than what they even have with their BFs for some of them). I would often be told I am a ""push over"" or ""too nice"" by some of my guy friends because of this, but honestly I always enjoyed being around women more than I did with my guy friends as the openness and depth of connection is so much more rich and satisfying with women, even if I am not sleeping with them.  What I've noticed is that for women in your age group (19-26)... you will find a lot of them are very conditioned to look for certain external qualities and will have a heavy emphasis on your appearance/smell/etc rather than looking at actual character or being recognized for the real substance and value you can bring them. Unfortunately, until women reach their late 20's and after constant painful experiences with the ""attractive"" and emotionally unavailable men, they may start to look at looking for other qualities.  Attraction is a very complicated subject and honestly I could write an entire book on the subject speaking to the social aspects, spiritual and other conditioned aspects that influence attraction... but it's not necessary for this conversation.  What has worked greatly for me is a few things... firstly it's to focus on myself; in the sense of my own personal growth to feel good about myself; not for the purpose of ""being good enough"" for someone else. This meant focusing on my career and my passions. Women as they get older will become extremely attracted to a man who knows who he is and knows where he's going; has a life direction (purpose) and knows what he wants.  Secondly, in the mean time while you're working on yourself, you may still have desire for physical intimacy with a woman, which is totally NORMAL. My invitation is to learn to acknowledge and express this without any outcome or shame around it. For many years I would suppress my sexual desires because it would never be reciprocated and the unconscious story I created was that there was something wrong with my desire; so I tended to simply become very energetically ""neutral"" and ""safe"". Once I begun to explore my desire again, I didn't want to experience the pain of rejection again, so the approach I took was to express my desire WITHOUT attachment to any outcome.  The pain of rejection comes from the idea that if our desires are not reciprocated, then there is a certain disappointment (as the outcome was not desirable) and ultimately reflects back onto us in terms of our self-value (that we're somehow not sexually attractive or desirable) and speaks to our worth as a person. This is something that I struggled with a lot and realized that it has nothing to do with me as a person or my worth; there simply is no feeling of sexual attraction and that is totally fine. But it's ALSO ok that I have desire for them; as that is our inherent human desire which is beautiful and healthy.  My approach that works for me that I feel totally congruent/authentic with is to spend time with a woman initially and get to know her, and if in those initial meetings I notice any desire or attraction for her come up, I simply tell her. ""Hey, I just wanted to share this with you: I'm noticing how I'm really enjoying your company and find you very attractive; and there's nothing you have to do about it.""  This will fry the brains of most women that hear this initially, because when a man expresses their desire and they don't feel the same, there tends to be a disconnect and awkwardness can ensue (essentially she may feel less open to you).... the last piece in that statement pretty much handles this problem by providing the freedom for her to choose and let her know that you desire her (which women love to hear) and that you are not attached to outcomes (that she doesn't have to do anything she doesn't feel like). This will build huge trust with the women in your life because you are transparent and authentic with them about how you feel (which believe me, most men are not). This will win you big points over time as you get older.  Anyhow, there's much more I could say but I will leave you with this for now to play with. If you want more details feel free to PM me.  EDIT: Some humor for you."
selfimprovement,3btudt,Kitkat69,3,Thu Jul 2 08:12:42 2015 UTC,"Haha I relate to a lot of what you said... I definitely do have a lot more close female friends for the reasons you described. The guys I go to just for some simple fun, but the girls I go to talk and have open conversation with. It's different and I like it.  I've definitely lost some of my personal drive during my last relationship, and I've been trying to get it back. It's true, you really do learn to work for yourself rather than for the acceptance of others. I've been trying to readopt that mindset and it's been helping me a lot. I've also learned to accept that my desires and wants are natural, and that it's okay to have that desire and even break things off due to incompatible libidos. I'm glad I learned it now rather than much later.  Where I still have trouble is with seeing rejection as a reflection of my lack of self worth, like you said. During my entire relationship I would see how little my ex was physically attracted to me and I tried my best to repress my lust, and felt like there was something wrong with me for wanting it and something wrong with me because she wasn't lusting after me. It wasn't until other girls admitted that they were attracted to me that I realized that it was okay. I'm starting to improve on it, but my first general thought is always that I'm not physically attractive.  And haha, I definitely feel you on the transparent and authentic part. I try my best to be honest with everyone. The only thing is that saying that so flat out during the first few meetings seems... a little rushed. Totally fine if it was just for a hook up or casual fwb or something (and if that's what you were going for, ignore the rest of this paragraph) but for an actual relationship I'm not sure if I'd be okay with going that fast. I'm almost always honest to girls when I talk to them but that complete, 100% transparency with everything I feel only comes to me when I've either just met them and don't care about the outcome (as you've mentioned), or if I'm already completely close and comfortable to them.  This does help a lot though, thanks! Anything else you can share? I feel like the younger you is a lot like me now."
selfimprovement,3btudt,Redegar,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad my words resonated with you. This is a learning process and you're well on your way to getting a lot of things that at your age I was oblivious to. I grew quickly in my 20's and now at 26 I'm actually far beyond many of peers in my understanding of these different ways of being, which means that if you are getting this NOW at your age, you won't have to struggle and suffer for as long as I did to embody this wisdom.  My intuition tells me that if you are similar to me, you may have noticed some patterns in your life which involve lack of recognition of your genius and abilities by most people (including your parents perhaps), and especially mostly passed over by the opposite sex. There's may be deep desire to be recognized as part of your nature; which can sometimes come off (or be interpreted as neediness) but it's actually simply your desire to give yourself to others.  The other piece is that you may also have the capacity to SEE others in a way that others may not; and also have the ability to feel into other people and their experiences. You see the collective insanity of society and other people's behaviour and it makes little sense to you. You might resonate with terms such as Old Soul, empath, Highly sensitive... etc. (""Wise beyond your years"" could be something you've felt or heard about yourself potentially.)   As for the connection between the self-worth and physical attraction piece, this is something you will overcome in time as you continue to get to know yourself and your true value of what you have to offer to others and this question of feeling confident in your sense of self won't be as big of an issue. Any kind of self-knowledge system here could be of huge benefit to you. There are books on ways to get to know your strengths, skills, gifts, etc. I can make some specific recommendations if you are interested.  As for the piece about feeling ""rushed"", I get you. There potential is fear here of rejection/loss of something that for you takes time to build. You might find yourself in a courting process that takes longer than for most; which is totally okay for you actually, rather than the 1-2 dates leading to sex and relationship within a very short span. You might enjoy actually getting to know someone and being ""present"" with them; feeling them out over time, perhaps even the idea of ""friends first"" resonates with you.   ....I've either just met them and don't care about the outcome...   This is pretty significant, as there is a hidden implication that if there is the potential of a relationship, then you would care about the outcome; and potentially act different. This is a normal tendency which I used to be susceptible to, but I can tell you that it can also mess up your energy when you invest yourself too much into a specific outcome (i.e. having a relationship). The best bet is to learn to be unattached to any outcome WHILE still expressing desire. Having desire is OK and not having them fulfilled is OK too.   The premise here is that our hope to have our desires fulfilled has a certain level of ""control"" attached to it, in the sense that we want and need our desires met by influencing others' behavior without appreciating the other persons atonomy and freedom. (This is a very ego driven arrangement which is quite commonly taught via most seduction/dating experts). They see the other person as a means to an end (to meet the needs of their ego) within the context of a relationship (i.e. What can I get) vs. a Being-to-Being connection whereby you meet the other person at it's a mutual giving back and forth rather than taking.  These are pretty high level concepts here that I've shared, but I suspect they should be quite intuitive and self-evident to you.  My only advice in response to your concern about ""being rushed"" is that if your intentions are to explore a possibility of a relationship with a person you find attractive, then there it's never really too early to say it, as you will immediately know if you're both on the same page and are not running on assumptions which lead to potential suffering when you later realize that this person was not a match to you (as it was the case with your ex.) This may seem confrontational, but I can tell you that if you nail this, women may not like you (at first), but they will surely respect you for your boldness and authenticity.  That said... don't take my word for it, I am simply speaking from my own experience. Don't take on anything or listen to anything that doesn't resonate with you... check in with your inner authority and verify it with your own personal experience. You already have all the answers within you."

Hit the gym and pump like you've never pumped before (not your dick). Work hard and fake your confidence until it's real. Girls will noticed that and maybe attraction will follow. You can't expect to get every girl to be physically attracted to you unless you're Chris Pratt or some drop dead gorgeous celebrity but you can sure as hell attract alot more if you start building up that confidence.

Because your not helping yourself by being that shoulder to cry on.  For example: A girl comes to you to rant about the fact she has boyfriend issues and feels like crap, if this repeats overtime triggers will form. With a trigger I mean that every time she sees you she will think about the issues she has with her boyfriend. Would you like to date someone that reminds you of your previous crappy situation?.

The real life cool kid is always invited because they light up a room. How? Think about the coolest kids you've known: the ones who you always wanted to be around. They make you feel cool, not by mere association with their coolness, but because they are interested in you. They remember things about you that make you feel important. They give effortless compliments that just seem genuine and natural. They seem above the pettiness of trying to be cool.   So, you've got two areas to focus on: outer and inner. For the outer, follow the Dale Carnegie's Six Ways to Make People Like You:   Become genuinely interested in other people.  Smile.  Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.  Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.  Talk in terms of the other person's interest.  Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.  (from Wikipedia)   These tips apply equally in person as they do online, even the smiling! I was trained in school as a radio host, and we're learned how you can hear if a person's smiling or not. It comes through in text as well!   For the inner coolness, you need to change what words you use in your thoughts. The good news is this doesn't have to come naturally at first: you can catch yourself doing it wrongly, correct yourself, and it's almost as good as thinking this way the first time. What you are going to do the next time you see that post on Facebook is be happy for them. You aren't petty thus far, you've just been having a normal reaction as a social animal to feelings of exclusion that are a byproduct of the technology we live with. But now when you notice this happening, force yourself to say words in your head like ""that's awesome! I bet that was a lot of fun because Jake likes science, and Sarah likes sci-fi, and I bet they got along great!"" or ""that dinner looks great! They're so talented! I'm really lucky to be friends with these people."" And you can force yourself to associate positive emotions with these thoughts by forcing yourself to smile while you think them; our brains are silly and assume we're happy if we're smiling."
selfimprovement,3bry0d,Adjal,5,Wed Jul 1 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're going through. It sucks missing out or being left out of the good times, especially when I get so busy with life, working 2 jobs, being as responsible of an adult as I can, and still trying to find time to work on my dreams and goals. And then seeing those Facebook posts that seemingly scream, ""Look how much fun we're having and you're not here! You're not cool enough to hang out with us!"" You want to think that's exactly the concrete feeling, but that's just one perception from your subconscious. I bet somebody looked back at that good time and thought, ""I wish /u/suzanita was here, I wonder what she's up to.""  So the first thing I'd suggest is stop taking these things at face value. It's a lesson that took a while for me to fully learn and understand. The world is super complex and complicated, even when you look at an individual person. That individual person is made up of millions upon millions of cells, in that brain of theirs they have hundreds of thoughts that enter their minds daily, and so on. Then you add multiple people which forms a group of friends, even bigger is society. Things happen, I don't think people are intentionally leaving you out of social gatherings.  The next thing I would suggest is getting all that damn social media control out of your head. A lot of people, myself included, have compared other people's highlight reels (all those Facebook posts of people together without you) to their raw footage of life (the natural ups, downs, and middle ground). Now you don't have to get rid of Facebook and Instagram completely, they can still be useful tools of communication and the spread of ideas and creativity.  After that, contact those friends of yours that you saw had a good time without you, see what they're up to, take control into your hands and make those fun times happen yourself. Don't wait for an invitation, send out your own.  And don't worry about being a ""cool kid"". Be yourself, enjoy the moment, and make a complete goof out of yourself, because it's fun! Hopefully this helps you out in some way."
selfimprovement,3bry0d,MiNombreEsBread,2,Wed Jul 1 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't take what you see on social media as something people ALWAYS do. Social media is a great way to skew our perceptions on other people's lives and it creates a self-dissatisfaction with our own because it tricks us into thinking we are missing out. Who knows, they could be more in a rut than you are with this stuff, but you won't know unless they're extremely public and open or you reach out. Social media is a great way to disguise what our lives are truly like.  One thing I would try more of is reaching out if you want to do something. Being available and willing to do whatever has greatly increased the time I spend with my friends. Be the one to initiate contact (preferably calling!) and it's likely they'll follow."

After a year, her Facebook wall is full of photos, activities, new friends, co-workers, parties, and tons of new adventures. And I'm not a part of them.   All I could think was ""Why doesn't she email me? She never even texts any more. We used to be so close. Why do I have to find out about her life on Facebook? Why doesn't she ever invite me to visit? Oh, it's because she has her NEW friends now, and doesn't need me...""  Yeah, turns out, when I thought about it, I never invited HER to visit. I never called, or emailed, or texted.    So, I emailed her, and invited her out to visit. And sure enough, she came out, and we had a great time, and got caught up. I asked her why she never emailed, and she said she wondered why I never emailed. She thought that maybe I was mad at her for making new friends. That was never the case - I couldn't be happier!   Now we email at least weekly, and text every so often. It's been great.    So, reach out. BE the friend who does the inviting. It can make a difference!"
selfimprovement,3brvoi,thewhisperer_,2,Wed Jul 1 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"Not to be that person, but I think that you're overthinking what sounds like normal teen relationships. And don't get me wrong, that's not any wrongdoing on your part, it's actually kind of a part of the process.   Teenagers have long had a reputation for getting super-obsessed with romantic relationships. You see it in everything from TV commercials to classic literature. And why wouldn't they? Teen relationships are new and exciting; you're not just having an experience that you've always known you had to wait for (like driving a car), it's something that you didn't even knew you wanted up until then. So you get really clingy and talk on the phone all the time and ignore every other part of your life for a while, and then you feel completely devastated when it ends. It's normal, and people grow out of it once they've been through it once or twice.  Your concern isn't love; it's fear of being so attached to someone else that you lose yourself. Those are not the same thing, even if that's what it looks like when it comes to people like your brother. And even if that happens, it's not some sort of permanent damage. My brother did that too when he was 16; had a girlfriend who he'd run up $500 phone bills with, thought the world revolved around her, and she dumped him for somebody else. Yeah, for a while, he moped around and said everything was horrible and he'd never try being in a relationship again. Then about six months later he met somebody who he's been in a relationship with for about seven years now.   Life involves getting hurt and making mistakes and there's no way around it (trust me, I've checked). It seems devastating when it's the first time you get hurt in a particular way, but it fades as you see other people around you getting along after it, and when you realize that you're still okay even though things might suck right then. If you deny yourself life experiences (especially ones that are really major for most people) to avoid pain, you'll regret it at some point down the line.  Because you'll have still experienced pain, but didn't get any of the positive experiences (and I say this as someone who's done exactly that; don't do what I did)."

When I started self-improving I grew extremely ambitious, and I am afraid that being in love will either slow me down on achieving my goals, and maybe even stop me.   Regarding what you say about the fact that I fear of being so attached to someone else that I lose myself, you may be very right, but I fear that the same way I fear falling from a skyscrapper without a parachute.

I should be asleep but HE is on the phone and wants to stay up to talk.    HE loves Nirvana - I will now buy every Nirvana CD and listen to them nonstop.    I want to see a comedy movie, HE only likes action movies. I must now only watch action movies. It's what HE wants!    Fight in the a.m., fight in the afternoon, fight twice at night.    Sex in the a.m., sex in the afternoon, sex twice at night.     He LOOKED at a girl! Tears! Doors slamming! He hates me! We're DONE!     I LOOKED at a boy! Threats! Doors slamming! I hate him! We're done!     Sex. Sex, sex, sex, sex, tears, apologies, sex. I'm so in love.    Love 20 years later:      We have our own interests and hobbies.    We have our own friends, and mutual friends, and we make time for them in our lives.    We need our sleep - we'll talk on the phone tomorrow.    HE loves Nirvana, I love Tom Waits. We'll listen to a little of each.   I want to see a comedy movie, HE only likes action movies. We'll go into different theatres, see the films we each want to watch, and meet up after for dinner, and to talk about the different movies we saw.   Disagreements once in a while, we face them as a team and work toward a solution.   Sex a few times a week, and now that we know each other so well, it is long-lasting, gourmet, seven-course sex. (Unless you have kids, then....well, skip anything having to do with sex)    He LOOKED at a girl! She was kinda hot. We nod and smile at each other - we wouldn't kick her out of bed.    I LOOKED at a boy. He was kinda hot. I smile, he raises an eyebrow with mock suspicion and takes my hand - while he knows I'll never cheat on him, it feels so good to know that he wants me after all these years. We kiss.   Sex, sex, cuddling, laughter, support, some tears, some joy, long talks, loving words, shared silence, more sex. I am so in love, and I had no idea it could ever be so deep and fulfilling.

selfimprovement,3brvoi,Entari8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"I think by your definition of “love” (Loving someone with your whole being) you are one hundred percent correct. Love will only sabotage, and hinder your personal growth, but I do not believe this definition which seems to plague the world is correct. If you “love someone with one hundred percent of your being than it stops being love and starts being obsession, and obsession is never healthy. That being said I believe the actual definition of love should be that you will give the other person forty percent. They may be the most important person in your life but you still have a life. The majority of people who fall in love with someone fall because they like the other person's personality, physical appearance, habits, etc. Few people excluding the narcissists and those (insert expletive) red pill people want a slave, but when you “love” someone with all of your being that's what you’re giving them."

To link that with my own experience, I figured that even casual sex on a regular basis took me too much time and effort, enough to prevent me improving the way I wanted to. So being in love, even 40% in love, seems to me too much to maintain self-improvement. Though I may just be managing my relationship the wrong way, I do not have enough hindsight to judge that."
selfimprovement,3brvoi,Entari8,2,Wed Jul 1 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Frankly it always surprises and saddens me that people think loving someone with their whole being is normal. ( I have never left the US so I hoped this nonsense was contained here) Personally I blame whoever came up with the notion of soul mates. The idea that you can never be whole without loving another person has created a climate of codependency, and now that I think about it it also removes personal responsibility. The individual believes that they don’t have to fight to change themselves because all that is required is the “love” of someone else."
selfimprovement,3brvoi,Entari8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.

This friend I am talking about, she is just like that, her only goal is to find the love of her life and to have a family. This way of thinking is very present, everywhere in the world, I don't think it is that sad though, if that is what makes people happy, good for them, but I do not share this opinon, I want to do great things in life."
selfimprovement,3brvoi,Thoughtism_me,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"The reason I find it sad is because I used to be where your friend is now. I was in a bad codependent relationship that lasted far too long, and unfortunately just like your friend I too had no other goals other than love. I’m also saddened because I know the vast majority of the human race will never change themselves for the better. Now your friend is around your age, and from personal experience I know that it is more than possible to make yourself  the best version of yourself. All that being said I think you and your friend are at different extremes of the same issue. You have probably seen bad relationships all you life and have thus decided why even try? Your friend on the other hand decided that the others simply didn’t love each other hard enough so she throws all of her being into it. Once again speaking from personal experience I know that whenever something was hard, or if I was afraid to do something I would come up with all the reasons why I shouldn’t even try. At some point in my life I learned that I would rather say I failed ten thousand times than I never even tried. This is of course just one man's humble opinion based off of limited information. Also if you haven’t told her already I would seriously encourage your friend to walk the path of self actualization it always bothers me when the human race is in pain, and I’m powerless to aid it."

So I don't think I am afraid of love, I would actually be thrilled, excited and happier than I have ever been, but I want to make the most out of my current, neutral position, and be skeptic about the benefits of love. I have shared with my friend my point of view but she does not understand it just as much as I don't understand hers, but I don't think the people that think that way are in any kind of pain, if they say they are happy with their life as want to live it, then they probably are and I don't think we should try to convince them their vision of love is wrong."

selfimprovement,3bpq36,woodcell,7,Wed Jul 1 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the other posters about deleting FaceBook, as I think it defeats what you want to achieve. FaceBook isn't the root of your problem here, and deleting it just focuses a symptom rather than getting to the root of your problem. The fact is that you should be well able to browse through sites like FB without your mood changing for the worse, and it's the mood swings that you want to resolve.   The first thing is to accept that you cannot change other people, you can only change your reactions to what other people say or do. You are allowing other people to bother you so much that you get angry and annoyed, and ultimately it ends up affecting you by dragging you down into a bad mood. In a sense, you're giving away your own self control and power, and placing it in the hands of others, allowing them to sway your life one way or another. Why would you give that much of yourself away?   Your body and brain function at their best when you are relaxed and happy. The chemical effects of constant stress and bad moods last longer than you may realise, and can have a solid effect on your life and health. Cultivating a relaxed and positive mindset is far more beneficial to you both mentally and physically.  If you really want to examine why you think the way you do, I would suggest cognitive behavioural therapy. It will show you how to be aware of your thought processes, challenge the unhealthy ones, and replace them with a healthier frame of mind that will benefit you as well as the people around you.   If you're not into the idea of therapy, then at the very least look into stress management. There is a whole lot that you can do that will raise your general mood and help you to live in a healthier way. Allowing yourself to be happy, and learning to make yourself happy, is a far more beneficial way to live your life. It's self empowering and gives you back the control of your moods, as opposed to allowing others to dictate how you feel.   Mindfulness is also a worthwhile practice to look into, similar to CBT it will teach you to be aware of your thoughts and help you bring them back into your control. It also has a very relaxing effect and will help you feel less tense in general.   Next time you find yourself feeling annoyed by someone, stop and examine what it was that triggered how you feel and what exactly you're feeling. Learn to self examine. Decide if it's worthwhile continuing down that angry frame of thought or if it would benefit you more to let it go.   Good luck!"

Also, for self improvement, you can make a conscious effort to do two pleasant things for every ugly thing you do. 1:2 rule. If you find yourself getting mad over a youtube video, just breathe, let it pass, and look forward to how you're going to make up for it. Maybe leave a really nicely worded comment on the video, or go take your dog for a walk. Anything works, as long as you consciously do two good things to counteract every one bad thing.

Like imagine how much it would suck if there was no water in your house and you had to roll a barrel to the edge of town every day.   Also, read about the lives of other people, especially those with vastly different experiences, and think about them. Try to put yourself in their shoes. Read about stuff like: the lives of soldiers, the lives of subsistence farmers. Like try to get ""out of your head"". Watch a documentary, for example about people who join ""Isis"", think about, why would they do such a thing for example.

selfimprovement,3biw0f,pookiemon,2,Tue Jun 30 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"Hello..  I started my morning ritual for a few weeks now, and it's pretty awesome. This is what I do.   1) Smile when waking.   2) Take 30 deep breaths in/out while moving my hands up/down above my head. I do this 3 times.   3) Think of 2 small things I'm grateful, and I large thing. At the end of my 3rd 30 deep breaths I think of one thing I'd like to accomplish today. 4) Meditate for 5-10 minute. 5) Glass (1-2) of water. 6) Stretching (5 minutes)   7) While stretching I will say incantations and affirmations. I have a full list that I go thru. Learned this from Tony Robbins. 8) Look and read outloud my mission statement, power virtues, ultimate goals, and empowering beliefs. 9) Go thru my empowering questions and primary question. 10) Read a book (5-10 pages). 11) Celebrate peak state for a few minutes. Put on a good jam, and act like a fool for a few minutes.   12) Put together my day's schedule.   13) Quickly review my goals and task for the day. 14) Take action on my highest level activity. Brian Tracey would call this eating the ugliest frog first. You want to do this in the morning, and when you're at your peak state. 15) Hit the gym.    I know this sounds like a lot, and it is. With practice I am able to get this done in little over an hour. This is everything but going to the gym. I do this everyday, and it has worked wonders for my life. I tell people what I do and they look at me like I have 2 heads. They just don't understand. It works for me."
selfimprovement,3biqnk,RoscoesCheddar,3,Mon Jun 29 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"A few tips.   First, re: the future mother-in-law - I had issues with my MIL too. And it's tricky, because in-laws will be part of your life forever (or at least it will feel that way.) The solution that works for me is to avoid any controversy, and stick to common ground. I have almost nothing in common with my MIL, and she has views and opinions that are almost inexcusable to me. BUT - she is my husband's mom, and part of our lives. So, I just smile, nod, change the subject, and play a role that I would never play if I didn't love my husband so much. If I see it as me playing a character, it makes it easier.  Because it doesn't matter if I'm right, or if facts are on my side, or if her gossip is poisonous, or her ideas ignorant, or her conversation boring. IT DOES NOT MATTER. What matters is that she is part of the family, and out of love for my husband I will grit my teeth and I will smile. Not everyone can do it, but it is working for me.   As for the vacation itself, There are a few things you can do.   The first is to create your own adventure. So - let's say everyone wants to spend the day in a stupid, giant gift shop. Just the thought makes you want to jam a fork in your eye just so you have an excuse to get out of it. I know the feeling. Instead of thinking ""I will die if I see one more Cancun magnet or beach towel"", think ""I love my fiance so much. She's so pretty trying on sunglasses. I love her smile when she sees a gadget that delights her. I can get some good gift ideas for the future by watching her today."" Make it a game with her. ""Hey, ten points to whichever one of us spots a guy in black socks and sandals / a sunburned tourist / the most cliche tattoo"". Make it about spending time with the woman you love, and not about being in a stupid tourist trap.   I get burned out on ""people"" easily, so sometimes I just bow out. Everyone's going to the blahblah museum, I need a little time to myself that day. I stay in and play on my computer. You can't get away with it every day, but if you explain to your fiancee that you are a little more introverted than she is, and you really need a break from hours of social interaction in order to recharge your batteries, she may understand.   Another thing to try might be to research a tourist place that YOU would like. For example, a restaurant that seems appealing to you, or an activity you'd like (mini golf? Parasailing? Jet skiing? Fishing?) That way you're still doing stuff, but YOU are controlling what you do.   With beaches, they're easy. You carry a bunch of shit down into the sand, park yourself under an umbrella, and read a book for a few hours. At some point, you put the book down, trot out into the waves a little way and stare at the sea, tell your fiancee how beautiful she is with the wind in her hair, and then trot back to your chair and read some more. Sand will get into your stuff, but it shakes out. Sunscreen and an umbrella will shield you from the sun. And a few hours of reading is good for you.   I need to teach a seminar on vacationing. I love vacations."

In which case, do you think you could take something to surreptitiously work on while you're there?

Doable for sure, but not all too exciting IMO."
selfimprovement,3biqnk,Quantumfog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"I tried scuba diving in Cancun, and it was one of the most magical experiences of my life. Maybe you can find a way to reframe it for yourself. We are land creatures, and to be submersed in a completely different world, in beautiful silence, with creatures we never get to see in our day-to-day lives, is such a wild experience. To me, it was like being able to visit another planet and experience a few hours of life on that planet.  I love horses, and nature, I wouldn't be thrilled about zip-lining but I'd try it, but getting out of your comfort zone is a positive thing, and will help you grow as a person. So maybe instead of thinking ""Ugh, stupid zip lining, I don't want to go,"" think ""New adventure! Fun stories! Something I may not like, but will help me grow as a person."""

selfimprovement,3bg5bw,intetsu,3,Mon Jun 29 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"So, this is one strategy that works for me. As another person mentioned, yes, starting is half the battle. Once you get started the momentum that you gain starts to counter balance the fear of the hard work ahead.   Another trick I use, is I say I will ONLY work on this project for 15 minutes. No more. Then, when I do this, and keep my promise to only work on it for 15 minutes, I start developing trust in myself. (Don't be tempted to keep going indefinitely. This will work a couple times, but then your promise quickly starts to lose meaning). This also serves to break the ice."

By doing things when your assigned them or initially plan them, you will do a better job. And have more free time later. When you stress out and procrastinate because a task seems too big to handle initially, all you're doing is causing yourself more pain and stress and effort down the road . If you get it out of the way, it'll go by quicker and easier than when your stressed and crunching for time. Also reward yourself whenever you finish something early."

Take the time to think about what you really want and what feels good to you. If you found something then set a goal for five years from now. Search for the resources you will need to reach that goal and spend al your energy in reaching that goal. It will give you a purpose and a feeling of being control over your own life."

PS: what cult was it? could you tell us more about that experience if you don't mind?   (my previously posted advice:)  You are not your parents, you are not your upbringing. You and YOU ALONE can make your life whatever you want it to be. Want something more for yourself? Go get it. Don't blame your past or your family for any mistakes or shortfalls along the way, most self made people I know came from humble beginnings just like yours. Take responsibility for your own future. I hope you've chosen a field of study that has BIG EARNING capacity and lots of job prospects in whatever area you want to live in... if not - change majors now. Too many people become ""the only one in the family to graduate college"" only to get stuck in a dead end low paying job. The more you learn the more you'll earn, want to get rich? Read the auto biographies of people who did. Follow in their foot steps. Read books on self help, on positive habit forming, on personal finance. Write your goals down, future pace, commit it to paper. Your dad doesn't think 2 steps ahead of get beer, drink beer that's why he continues that cycle. Get a 5 year plan - make steps immediately towards it - adjust accordingly. Finally, if you really want a head start on life, don't just aspire to ""enjoy your 20's"" instead aim for a head start in life, surround yourself with successful slightly older people than you. Your income is almost always an average of your closest circle of peers. Meet successful people, ask them to mentor you. You've written down what you DON'T want in life, now focus on (and write down) what you DO. Make steps daily towards those goals. Rinse, repeat. Good luck!"
selfimprovement,3bfz8h,AhoyTelephone,7,Sun Jun 28 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"Hey man, sorry to hear you're feeling down. I was in your situation a few years ago - I'm 22 now and things have improved in some areas and stayed the same in others - you win some, you lose some eh? I don't want this to get into motivational speech territory, but I'll try my best:   In my opinion, regret is a redundant emotion - you did the best you had with what you knew at the time. I too spent many a summer staying in and playing videogames, but after similarly thinking it was a boring interest etc, I realised that I still had a lot of fun and it wasn't time wasted. Embrace your hobbies - they'll provide a great way to break the ice should you find yourself at some sort of convention/meetup. Also, fountain pens eh? That's intriguing - do you do calligraphy? :D Seriously, demonstrate some passion for the things you love - if people don't like them it's their problem and if they do then you're on your way to making a friend. Lamenting a lack of friendships is subjective - from what you've written you sound like someone who enjoys solitary pursuits/may be more introverted. However, if the opposite is true and you enjoy meeting people, I would understand why you may be down about not forging stronger relationships. You're still young though - that's one thing. The other is, that finding good friends is a lottery and it's very rare to find a good group the first time round. It's clichéd advice yes, but being better off on your own is the first step. Consider as well that devaluing yourself and your interests may lead to a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts. Also, don't be down on yourself for what you don't like either dude. If you didn't enjoy travelling, you didn't enjoy it - I hate going on holidays personally. If anything, you found something that you don't want to waste time on in the future and can concentrate on other things you like! There's a positive in every situation. I'm still in the same boat for the girls situation and sometimes it is hard having no experience. But you really have to own it - if anyone has a problem with it, then they're seriously not worth dealing with. Live life on your own terms and screw those who judge you for what you have or haven't done. Most of my friends are the same experience wise or aren't with a new girl every night, but the way they live with the utmost belief in themselves makes me respect them even more. And that far outweighs me keeping score for what they have or haven't done. If anyone does give you shit for it, just reply to them like it's normal - they'll soon realise they can't get to you. With the gym, expectation is the thing that kills the joy in it. May I suggest taking a log of exercises and trying to beat them even my just one rep per set. Even if you can't that day it could be due to a number of factors. May I also suggest bodyweight training at home - darebee.com has amazing programs. After hitting the gym for years and getting protein shakes I didn't get anywhere but doing that stuff at home has actually helped! Just find what works for you!   Tl;dr - Okay this ended up really long but I sympathise with your situation a lot and really wanted to tell you it gets better. But it doesn't happen overnight at all - I was 19 when I felt low and now 3 years later I'm in a place where I own myself, keep moving forward and am my own personal cheerleader. Sometimes I feel the burdens of shyness and being my own worst critic, but it all passes. Try to work out why you feel a certain way, or what beliefs you have about your interests, why you find it difficult to make friends etc to challenge any irrationality you perceive in them.  I hope it helps, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM dude. I expect to see a post a few years down the line saying how you turned it all around ;) Your happiness is the most precious thing in your life and don't let anyone stop you from getting it - especially yourself!"
selfimprovement,3bfz8h,Blues_OVO,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"The problem is, I know regret is a redundant and pointless emotion, yet I still have it. I am a bit of an introvert (getting a bit fed of the internet's obsession with classifying introvert/extrovert as a binary instead of a continuum but that's another story) but that doesn't mean I want to spend all day in my room talking to nobody. I do enjoy social interaction afterall.  Everyone seems to say it gets better but I can't see things changing unless I actively do something about it. I'm not sure that something for me should be though. I'll give bodyweight training a try though."
selfimprovement,3bfz8h,Blues_OVO,2,Mon Jun 29 09:22:37 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat it - there's plenty of things people 'intellectually know' but don't 'emotionally know' if you get me? Like you haven't yet felt why regret is a pointless emotion but know you don't need it. Unfortunately it's very hard to trigger the transition - look up coherence therapy as that helps quite a lot when trying to resolve a mindset you may find irrational.   And yes, the introvert/extrovert obsession is a problem nowadays but I used it here as a general term, just to get a feel for what you might like. Plenty of people like going out but favour staying in more so lie toward the introverted continuum. Sometimes those very people may feel that they're 'wasting their social lives' though they probably wouldn't have the capacity for a full, hectic schedule. So in that sense, it's best to work with yourself instead of against.  That is definitely true - however, actively doing something about it isn't just related to the physical side of things e.g. going out, exercising. With a personal example, it's true that bodyweight training helped me a lot BUT I consider it a coincidence compared to the real personal change that was happening alongside it.  A lot of the hard work goes on 'behind the scenes' in your mind and no one normally sees it or mentions it. Another thing is, people who say it gets better often forget what it looks like in the 'before stage' - these are the ones most likely to give you generic advice like 'be yourself' or 'it'll happen'. Or they may not be entirely self reflective and able to pinpoint mental transitions or what they used to be like. It's not a bad thing, but the source of advice is very important - you need it tailored to you. The irony in all this is that the generic advice does hold some truth to it - 'be yourself' doesn't mean don't change, but rather practice self acceptance because people find it difficult to deal with someone constantly beating themselves up. 'Don't look and it will happen' often simply refers to getting to a state of not expecting certain outcomes from your actions (means to an end behaviour) and being happy no matter what happens.  Self reflection/awareness and really analysing your thoughts etc is truly a laborious process and not something everyone routinely does. I firmly believe it'll help you make the transitions you want, but like the physical side it'll take time.   PS - the program I used from darebee was '90 days of change' - due to other commitments I couldn't do it every day but it definitely did help. MyFitnessPal is also amazing for helping you keep on top of your diet if you want to lose fat or bulk up or whatever.  Good luck!"
selfimprovement,3bfz8h,bubbles_says,3,Mon Jun 29 10:29:53 2015 UTC,"If you want to feel better all you have to do is help somebody else. Lend a helping hand. Look for ways to be of aid to someone.

You say you did therapy for a short time, and it sort of sounds like you got discouraged by lack of results from other things quickly too. I read one study that found takes six weeks minimum to affect mood, which agrees with my experience, and meditation took even longer to become really beneficial for me. This is why doctors often bring in mess as a first line of defense against depression, they take more like two weeks to start working and are easier to comply with than, say, running fifteen miles a week. If you haven't tried something for a solid two months, you may not have seen the full benefits. I also have a lot more luck with things when I do them with other people, it makes it way easier to stick with them, even if I only meet up with a group once a week.  If you can afford it, the best thing to do is see a doctor. We can tell you what worked for us here, but a professional seeing you in person can do way more. Do consider mess if they suggest it. It's not great, but they can help a lot with getting you up out of a hole and you don't have to take them forever. Good luck out there, if you can find a way to persevere, you'll find a way to improve your situation."

It'd be one thing if this was one jackass, but if every guy you're with says this, it sounds like it might be time to stop and get things sorted."

selfimprovement,3bdvh9,geGamedev,17,Sun Jun 28 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"Guys get bitter and vindictive when they get rejected.  I'm not saying all do, but it's a common thing.  It's a really immature self-defense mechanism.  I don't know if your taste in guys favors the type who will react that way, but regardless, their words and actions reflect on them and only them.  Their failure to handle rejection is not your fault, and their spiteful words hold no truth.  They are lashing out like children because they don't know how to handle their emotions (which is a sad thing in itself, but no excuse to be hurtful).  We (as a society) use ""whore"" and ""slut"" to shame women out of being sexually confident and open.  Words that in this day and age exist purely as insults, and have no power if not seen as such.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're not a whore just because some bitter guys said so, but even if you wanted to be, there wouldn't be a damn thing wrong with that.  Be who you want to be, in bed and out of it, because it's nobody else's damn business."
selfimprovement,3bdvh9,Wombat_of_Death,11,Sun Jun 28 16:09:03 2015 UTC,What?? Verbal abuse from people isn't your fault. There is no information in this post though. I think you need to work through the issues from your past in therapy. Enduring abuse can lead to complex PTSD which is a serious condition. Low self esteem can result in taking responsibility for others behavior (ie verbal abuse) and internalizing it. Revictimization is also a possibility that can lead to picking abusive partners reminiscent of the past because that's what is familiar.   Good luck x

selfimprovement,3bdvh9,oldSoul12345,5,Sun Jun 28 10:32:08 2015 UTC,"Okay there are a few issues here.   First of all, no matter what, calling someone a ""whore"" is abusive and shitty. There are tons of other ways a person could express their displeasure. They could say ""I feel really hurt right now,"" or ""I was hoping we'd continue our relationship, I'm really upset,"" or  ""I feel like you're making a bad decision - I care a lot about you and I'd love to work through this,"" or even ""Fine, we're done, I don't want to have contact with you anymore."" Name-calling is NOT APPROPRIATE.   During a breakup, tensions often run high and people may act out, out of pain or anger. It's not RIGHT, but it can happen. If a person lashes out and calls you names, you can ignore it.   That said, it can't hurt to consider your actions during a relationship or breakup, NOT because of what someone might call you, but for your own self. For example, some people will sling around the word ""whore"" if they have been cheated on. Now, cheating does not make someone a whore. But cheating IS a really hurtful action that causes serious damage to people. So if they are calling you a ""whore"" because you cheated, they are WRONG to call you that - but they would be right to say ""You betrayed my trust, and I am deeply hurt and angered by your actions."" If you sort of spring a breakup on a person, like if you know it's over, but you keep seeing them just so you can avoid a tough conversation, likewise that can bring on some anger, because people don't like being deceived.    All this is to say that if you are honest throughout the relationship, if you are assertive about your feelings and the pace of the relationship (especially if they want to move faster than you do), and if you treat them with respect (and make sure they treat you with respect), then a breakup is a matter of 2 adults discussing the end of things. Emotions may be high and people can feel hurt, but your honest and respectful actions can help minimize the pain and angry responses.   If you are not so honest, if you allow yourself to be pressured into moving faster than you want (making the other person think that you're as into them as they are into you), and you aren't clear and assertive about what you want, and especially if you look outside the relationship before ending it, then a breakup can hit your partner from (in their opinion) out of left field. It can leave them feeling angry, betrayed, and really hurt, in which case they might be more inclined to lash out and call names. It's NOT okay for them to do that. (And it's not okay for you to call names either - I am working from the assumption that you are not doing that.)    In the future, look for red flags - if they talk about their ex-gfs in a derogatory manner, they WILL talk about you in a derogatory manner. There is a big difference between a person saying ""My last relationship ended because my ex cheated on me, it was really painful,"" and saying ""My ex was a lying, cheating whore! She was a total bitch!"" One is okay because it's stating a fact and sharing a feeling. The second is a big red flag."
selfimprovement,3bdvh9,dolphinesque,2,Sun Jun 28 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"You should accept that you don't get to choose how another people feel about you or what what they call you. You can only choose and affect what person you are and what you do.  Sure, who you are does influence how others feel about you, but in the end it is their decision that takes more of their background into account than just you.  You can choose the people that you get close to and that will get the power to hurt you or to heal you through this closeness. If you keep getting hurt by your boyfriends, then there can be two sources for it: I don't know you and you didn't tell me enough about you... Is there something that you do that provokes theat response over and over again in different kinds of people (it's very hard to be objective about that)? If so, is this something more important to you than not getting hurt or would you like to change it? Option two is equally likely - you keep getting together with the wrong kind of guys. Look at your past boyfriends and consider how similar they were. Think about what was the reason you choose them for and what were the drawbacks of that choice. Don't you jump from one relationship to the other without learning anything? People generally generally don't do that, but it's always decision of that guy as well to start it... So they should know what they are getting into."
selfimprovement,3bdvh9,grepe,2,Sun Jun 28 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Guys will sling words like that just to hurt someone as they exit the relationship as a sort of twisted way of protecting themselves.  It's shifting the blame.    However, you've not told us enough.  Let me say immediately that it's never justified to verbally, emotionally, or physically abuse someone.  Ever.  But, is there some activity from your past that  they are aware of that causes them to react that way?  Have you been promiscuous as a response to being molested?  Basically, I'm asking if there's more to the story than you are telling us?  Again, their actions are never justified, but if you truly want to get to the bottom of it, you've got to tell us more than you currently have in the OP.    I have no clue what the situation is, has been, or will be.  But I do know that being molested isn't your fault.  But the best thing you can do is take full responsibility for everything AFTER that, be honest with yourself about it all, then begin repairing and fostering healthier relationships."

If you are having trouble ""letting in"" people in your life (due to your history), and especially if you are then also talking about your past, you'll put a lot of burden on your partner. That stuff is tough to deal with. When you then leave him, it's possible that he can feel cheated on or having been taken advantage of.  Are you dating guys as a method make yourself feel better?

The first thing to admit is that you don't know what other people are thinking. Flat out, you really don't. Even what people say don't necessarily represent their own thoughts. Realizing this, it'll help to cement the idea that your thoughts (and perceived criticisms) are personal and biased, rather than objective facts.  Secondly, what they say or do doesn't have any effect on you; who you are does not change intrinsically based on the labels people apply to you.  You do not become a loser because people call you one, the same way people calling you poor doesn't actually physically take away from your bank account. They're just words, and not to mention, people are often wrong, arbitrary, or ignorant. People who used to hate Coldplay now love them for whatever reason, people turned on President Obama, whatever; people are fickle, biased, and you have no reason to trust your perception of those biased people rather than your own perception of yourself, which should be positive.

selfimprovement,3b5jlg,seoreswandor,3,Fri Jun 26 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"Listen to your intuition.  Intuition isn't something exclusive to women. Men have it too.  Some people have intuitive abilities and others don't. Basically, what intuition means is that you should listen to the first 'voice' that pops up in your head when you need to make a decision.   If you have a good intuitive ability, just listen to the first voice in your head that tells you to do something. Forget about logic - the logical mind often screws things up (and it always comes directly after 'hearing' that first intuitive voice).  Intuition is the way to go. Been listening to it for over a decade now and I can't recall any mistakes after having followed its guidance.     Don't pressure anyone into anything, including yourself.  Once you pressure anyone (or yourself) into something, most odds are that that something would be long gone in a very short time. The more you pressure anyone into something, the further you're keeping them away from it.     Be a good person. Even if it means having to suffer sometimes.  They say good people suffer more. Considering myself as a good person, I'm pretty sure that's correct. Even if it means you end up suffering for a bit - don't let it get in your way of being a good person.  Eventually, good things will come to you."

selfimprovement,3b42ar,JuanGuillermo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in the industry. Not as a make up artist but I've met a lot.  Any job in film requires 1) being an expert at what you do - always learning, striving, thinking on your craft 2) doing it.  I don't mean to sound glib about the second one. What I mean is, people in film are surrounded by bullshitters - people who talk but don't deliver, people who want something but don't take the steps to make it happen.  Crews don't trust people who talk a good game. It doesn't mean anything when you're on a 16hr. shift and everything sucks. They want someone who will do what they're good at no matter what.  So volunteering on shoots is the way to go. Most towns have indy film scenes. Volunteer. Or on photo shoots. Anywhere you can. It helps you practice your trade and shows people that you work hard at it.  If you're good and you're reliable, they will try to keep you working because they know they can depend on you to do great work. The good, hard working people in indy shoots end up getting ahead.

selfimprovement,3b26d4,neurointervention,4,Thu Jun 25 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"My main thought is this. I went to college at age 17 and was told in no uncertain terms that I was not ever moving back home. After college I was homeless for a little while, and my Dad said ""That's too bad, get a job,"" and would not let me move back in. It was devastating. And I am a lazy, unmotivated person, too, so being forced to get a fast food job (which was soooo beneath a college graduate like me) in order to get a roof over my head was humbling. And hard. I did not have a CHOICE to be lazy and unmotivated - I had no place to live.   So my first thought is this. If you have a choice, if you have a roof over your head, and food on the table, then why not just be lazy and unmotivated? Just live the dream, man, because some of us have to work hard for a living, and it sucks. Just live home, rent-free, and play games all day. That's what I'd do, if I had a choice.   I mean, yeah, people will get on your case, and hassle you, but if the price of playing games all day and being a slacker is just words, then boo hoo, yell at me all day, I'll be playing Minecraft.   And yeah, there may come a time when all of that support gets pulled away, maybe you get kicked out, but then...problem solved, because you will be FORCED to get a job and find a place to live, just as I was, and your laziness won't even be a factor, because eventually you will need to eat.   That said, it's a lot easier to just suck it up and do what it takes to get a job NOW. Because when you're 35 and suddenly have to get a job after never having one, interviewers are going to have some serious questions about your lack of work experience."

I can live at home but I've put a time limit on it and it's no longer than a month till I get a job and a new place. Motivation is what I need and today it's coming.   The first few comments showed me the light, that it doesn't have to be hard you just need to work for it and that's the hard part!   I like your last comment about sucking it up!

Because I was young, entitled, and arrogant. I had job opportunities, but I turned them down because they weren't ""personally fulfilling"" or whatever BS excuse I made for myself. In reality, I was having a hard time dealing with the fact that employers weren't beating down my door to offer me cushy, high-paying management positions where I could express my creativity and only work with fun, easygoing coworkers. I felt like I had done the work and got through college, so now it was society's turn to give me what I felt I was entitled to. And...I was wrong. I had to take the crappy, low-paying jobs and work up to the good jobs. And that's what I did.    If my dad had let me live at home, I would have spent YEARS playing video games in my room, and going to bars at night, and telling him ""Dad, there ARE no jobs, I've BEEN looking, there just aren't any!"" for as long as I could. So I am really grateful to him, because by saying ""no"", he made me prove to myself that I was capable of doing it on my own. I went from homelessness to owning my own business. It took decades, but I did it, and I could not have done it if he had enabled my lazy, entitled attitude.    Good luck on the internship - say ""yes"" to hard work and you WILL be rewarded!"

And to juxtapose this I have a few friends that are unemployed and not studying. We figured, if there's no real 'why' no real impetus to kick ass, why would you? Someone posted a very insightful comment on get motivated; your aspirations and idealisations of 'success' are all in your head, meanwhile, you ignore what is right in front of you. I have a degree, a salaried job, I own a car, I have savings. I don't feel successful, I'm lazy, and I feel like I'm in a rut. When I first got the job (2 years ago) I felt it was a step toward success. Now it feels like a treadmill I want to get off. I don't think you ever 'make it', but having something to strive for combined with a real reason to do so will provide the stimulation to keep you going. There is no overnight solution, and unless your 'why' is solid you will slip back into the most energy conserving state; laziness. I have a plan, but if I was in your shoes I would distance myself from whatever is making you feel safe and comfortable, and out yourself on the line.   Good luck."
selfimprovement,3azv25,Mannykenneth,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"I've had similar issues with self-esteem and relationships in my life. Here are some things that have helped me. I'm not an expert by any means, but just another traveler sharing what might work.  These thoughts you're having are just mental representations, and not what they appear to be. Just because you have a thought doesn't mean it's true. Keeping a journal of them can be helpful to realize this and reflecting on them when your mood changes.  Self-esteem is influenced by your thoughts, actions and decisions. A good place to start is to reflect on what you pursue versus what you find genuinely praiseworthy. What would happen if you pursued what you found praiseworthy? Volunteer, donate. Do something that you really believe in.  The key is to choose very small steps and build on them incrementally. Spending a minute a day doing something praiseworthy is a great step. Then the next day, do 65 seconds, etc. Just keep at it and remember to plan on having set backs. That's when the real growth occurs."

I only recently figured this out, but writing is kind of like talking without needing another talker. Like playing tennis against a wall. It doesn't mean it useless! By writing or sketching things out, I can make sense of it, and get it out of my head. I don't even have to agree with what I've written out afterward as a whole.

selfimprovement,3axiik,Waterish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping a journal for over 3 years now, writing everything I do. This is what I've found:    Just recently I started rereading them just to collect some of the ideas I've put down. Going through them, some of the trivial information about day to day activities didn't seem relevant when I was reading but I also realized that when you do write about these things you're forced to  remember everything you've done that day. Understanding what you do on a day to day basis will help you identify points that you feel like you can work on your goals instead of doing something that sucks up time (civ 5 for me). To your point though I don't think you have to write about everything. Just pick out the details that stuck out to you, things that surprised you, confused you, made you happy, sad, because those are the important details. It has helped me become very introspective and reflective in understanding my personal strengths and weaknesses. Write down what works and what doesn't. What you like and what you don't.  Use your writing when you're confused. Whenever you're trying to figure something out about why you're angry or sad or feel off about something, putting it into words helps your brain work through what's really happening. It calms me down to find a sense of clarity in my writing."

If you want someone to do something for you, that person has to want to do it. You want your spouse or partner to do something, then figure out how to make them want to do it.   Example: You tell your wife that you want to be able to spend more quality time with her, so you ask her to get started on dinner before you get home (or have it ready when you get home). Contrast this with, ""Make me dinner, woman!"" Both approaches essentially are asking for the same result, but one will likely get you thing you asked for."

HTWFAIP is a primer on general social interactions and a very good one at that. If you are looking for good general advice on making platonic friends it's a good guide.   However it's not meant to be applied to romantic relationships which operate under there own special rules and conventions. If you're male and you try to use HTWFAIP in a romantic relationship you will come off as a ""friend"" because that's what the book is aimed at.   If you're already in a relationship I would recommend one of the books from the ""Men Are From Mars..."" series as being a similar level primer with solid advice tailored to romantic relationships.  If you are a single male then HTWFAIP will not help you. HTWFAIP will not tell you (if you're a guy) that you must lead each interaction with a woman. You must initiate everything including physical touch and kissing. That showing ""sincere appreciation"" can actually backfire. The best primer on all these topics is Magic Bullets by Nick Savoy."

It makes it a lot easier to overcome shyness or lack of confidence when you have common ground.  After some practice it will come naturally.

Caring too much about comments is not the problem, but just a symptom of something else happening to you... You're looking for approval (worrying about someone else liking you, or being mad at you...), but reality is you don't need approval (at least not in that way).  You're right now the very best version you can be of yourself. As /u/StoicMagician said, try to tackle the problem from another perspective.  Also, the book recommended by /u/kirbydeerwood in a comment below is a great place to start tackling things in another way!"
selfimprovement,3auohx,MarcusNotVerySmart,6,Tue Jun 23 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion and experiences, being 'over-sensitive' and unable to filter things out comes from a very controlling attitude and people like you tend to worry a lot, even about the mundane things in life. You have to remember to take a deep breathe ask yourself 'Why do I care?"" and ""How does this matter to me?"". From there you can see where your problems really come from and what kind of things trigger your over-sensitive personality.  For example, someone just cut in front of you at a cashier or while you're driving. Instead of thinking, 'wow this fucking guy', you can think (or force yourself to think) 'oh, he must be running late'. It's often best to give people the benefit of the doubt since it'll be easier on your mind and train yourself to be more open minded about future encounters with people of all sorts."
selfimprovement,3auohx,screenwblues,3,Tue Jun 23 18:55:42 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've been working on giving people the benefit of the doubt. I noticed that my assumption that people mean a comment or action as a personal attack is really just judgement on my part. I'm judging them and assuming they are being mean.
selfimprovement,3auohx,screenwblues,5,Tue Jun 23 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"""We don't see things as THEY are, we see things as WE are.""  I've struggled with this as well throughout my life. Some people, like myself and maybe you, have a sensitivity that others do not. It's a blessing and a curse. What makes you hyper sensitive to others allows you to better understand them and situations sometimes. It can also leave you raw because you feel more than some and read too much into things you notice that no one else sees.  Here is one tactic that I learned. When you feel an emotion, take a moment. Literally step away from the stimulus that caused it. Then feel that emotion - honor it. Try and figure out where you can feel it in your body (sometimes it's your stomach, your chest, your head). Recognize what it is doing to you (rapid heartbeat maybe, shallow breath, tears). Then stay with it. You don't have to do anything about it. Just feel it. No judging. You feel things for a reason so feel them.  Try to feel it as deeply as you can. Then try to feel it less deeply. Imagine a volume knob. Up and down. Deep and shallow.  Congratulations, now you know what you're feeling and where you are feeling it. That alone is helpful. You've also given yourself some space to honor that feeling and know you control its intensity. You can make it worse and you can make it better.  And you'll notice that it's in your body. It isn't in the world. The world didn't make it. You did.   Then guide your thinking away from outside yourself and ask why. Why do you feel how you do? Your feeling is not because of what happened externally to you. It's because of you. You created it - no one and nothing else did.  So why did you do that?  Don't be judgmental when you answer. Be kind. Understanding. Forgiving. Above all, be as objective as possible and curious. We just got you feeling less threatened by whatever happened, we don't need you feeling threatened by yourself.  Thinking about it will lead you to a place where you don't want to go but it's where you need to go. If you don't find the root cause of that feeling then it will just come back over and over.   The things we fear have the most to teach us. Explore them.  Usually when we feel something at that level it isn't the current situation that caused it. It's the culmination of all the times things like this have happened to you. Your past is coloring your impressions of today. And your past doesn't exist anymore so you don't have to listen to it.  It's hard. So hard. I hated doing this at first. It was almost impossible. I was so indignant, ""But you don't understand, it was them. Look what they did to me."" ""Or look at the situation, of course I reacted the way I did.""  It was true. But it didn't help. Gradually, after practice, I could do half of what I talked about above (and only sometimes). I'm still working on it.   I CANNOT tell you what a gift it has been for me. To find that distance. That little breath. There is a little contemplation now between when I feel something and I react to it.  I'm still trying. And it's getting better. Most importantly, I'm learning instead of being scared."
selfimprovement,3auohx,dandiddlydoo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:21:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for the full and in depth response. I really like the idea of exploring my emotions without judgement.

selfimprovement,3auohx,kbrugger,3,Wed Jun 24 17:07:15 2015 UTC,"I hear you on this; I think that being hyper sensitive comes from a good place—of caring and wanting to do right by others, but like all qualities, when it's taken to it's extreme, it can be excruciating for the person who feels it and can negatively impact relationships.   The reality is that if you're ever going to do anything interesting and meaningful in this world, you're going to piss some people off (sometimes because of mistakes that you're and sometimes due to circumstances that have very little to do with you), and you have to learn to be okay with this. To this end, one of my favorite quotes (adapted from Elbert Hubbard is): ""To avoid criticism: Do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.""   Okay—so how to not take everything so personally? I think the best thing to do is to ask yourself these 4 questions: 1. What is the message I'm hearing?  2. Am I sure that it's a personal attack (or am I maybe being overly sensitive)? (If I'm not sure it's a personal attack, then I try to have generosity of spirit and assume the best from the other person—i.e., that they meant nothing by it or that they're trying to be helpful/constructive because they believe in me—unless this is a repeated issue where I have mounting evidence that it's an attack) 3. If it is a personal attack, is it true? (If it's not true, then force yourself to ignore it—this is difficult at first, but gets easier fairly quickly). 4. If it's true, is it worth my time and mental/emotional energy to care? (Unless, you feel that listening to a personal attack will somehow make you a better person, then the answer to this question is probably no, and you, again, need to force yourself to ignore it).   Usually, if you ask yourself these 4 questions, you'll be able to make the decision to strategically ignore things that aren't helpful (or not ignore things that might help you to grow and learn). If you really really stressed about this, or are having a hard time with the ""ignore"" choice, then a licensed therapist can also be helpful (though in many cases this is not necessary)."

Just figure out what truly makes your life better by trying things. If they don't work for you, try something different. Embrace the disappointment when it arises and learn from it so you can figure out what you want to do differently.  Fighting things like this (internal struggles) makes them stronger because you focus on them more and more. It's not easy, but you can choose how you see things and move to a more positive and constructive thought pattern. Start with accepting that your feelings are not something to be ashamed of: They guide everything you do. Learn from them, and learn when they are misleading you."

But practically speaking, life takes effort. We are in an age where instant pleasure is all around us, but it's not lasting pleasure and it doesn't improve us in the long term. To look at the bright side of your particular situation - in a way you are better off not getting an instant fix from certain activities. It makes it easier to look into the long term, because for most people the instant pleasures keep them  from having the willpower and discipline to seek long term improvement. These improvements generate pleasure from higher self esteem, increased confidence, and peace of mind.  Willpower and discipline are hard to master. You need to start slow. Start building small habits. Try new things just to see what feels right, or doesn't. Don't destroy your body though - you only have one.  I have always battled depression and at times apathy. I have recently started working on willpower and discipline to get out of the constant cycle. I am 30, so be happy that you are tackling this at an even younger age.

selfimprovement,3ati8b,instantluck,2,Tue Jun 23 11:32:38 2015 UTC,"Most traits have upsides and downsides to them. My guess is that you may just have the kind of brain that's always ""on"" and always taking on information and making connections (even unconscious ones), which can appear as ""scatterbrained,"" but isn't necessarily a bad quality in every situation. Question: when you're doing something that you enjoy, do you ever get so ""engrossed"" that you actually focus? If so, then it could just be that you're easily bored with tasks that you don't perceive as interesting or worth your attention (again—this may be unconscious). If you're worried that this is limiting you, then I'd take CokeCanNinja's advice and make a concerted effort to focus (and—yes—meditation is great!). It could also be an issue of you needing to work on your interpersonal communication skills—we all feel distracted sometimes during conversations about things that we find boring or draining, but people with strong interpersonal skills find a way to hear the person out at least, and again—this comes with practice. I'm not saying that medicine won't be helpful, but I would explore all options so that you can weigh the pros/cons of each and make an informed decision."

Don't forget, even if they are in the same field, their path will never be the same, its all about personal development.

Usually when we get jealous of other people, we want what they have because we believe that will make us happy or happier than we currently are. If we are content and find happiness in not only where we are but how we're trying to improve, that goes a long, long way in eradicating jealousy.

On the right of my to-do list is a ""parking lot"" for items that don't need to be done that week, but should be on my radar. And lastly, I keep a ""things to buy"" list on my phone (I use Google Keep for that list). That would include groceries, and anything else I need to purchase, such as new socks or underwear, a new shirt, dog food, a new bird feeder, a new mouse pad, and so on.  Before I go out, I review the lists and calendar to see what I can bundle together.    ALL deadlines, assignment due dates, and appointments go into Google Calendar, with email notifications 1 week prior and 2 days prior. I also have notifications sent to my phone 40 minutes before ANY appointment.  And now, no matter where I am, if someone schedules an appointment with me, or sets a deadline, or there is some date I need to remember for some reason, I stop everything I'm doing and put it into Google Calendar (on my phone) right then and there. Because as soon as you start to say ""I'll enter it later"", or ""I'll do it when I am not so busy"", you'll forget. The ONLY exception to this iron-clad rule is if , for some insane reason, my phone is not with me (I forgot it at home for example), in which case I write the appointment in pen on the back of my hand. It's ugly and noticeable, so I won't forget it. But that is the level of commitment you need to have to the system. The minute you start slacking, and say ""I'll remember,"" you're done. Because maybe you can remember one thing, or two things. But three things gets tricky. And four things is a little confusing. And five, six, or seven things - you're just not going to remember all of those dates and times.  And this will help you manage your time better, especially having reminders in your email. (I NEVER delete an email reminder until the task is done.)   Try to automate some regular tasks. For example, paying bills can be automated.

selfimprovement,3ao9ck,dolphinesque,2,Mon Jun 22 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"I second this. If you feel like you don't have enough time to do stuff all the time it's likely you're just not organized. Google calendar is a great tool, but if you don't like using a program/app, try writing everything down into a physical planner/bullet journal.  One method is making a list of all the things you need to do, now until up to a week or so in the future. After writing that, prioritize that list from most urgent and important to least urgent/important. Then, circle the ones you decide, based on prioritization, that you need/WILL get done today. From there you can plan those tasks into time blocks, and once you know what you're supposed to be doing you'll feel a lot less rushed and overwhelmed. At the end of the day, take all the not crossed-off items and transfer them to the next day's list and repeat. This method works best if you don't usually have anything you need to remember to do past ~1-2 weeks"

The author talks about creating High Impact Tasks (HIT). Hit List items on your weekly ""to-do"" includes only 3-5 things that you love doing...or lets face it, need to do it. HIT list items are the things that drive you. Then there are everyday business items such as reading for school, emails, meetings, discussion groups. These are the things that you absolutely cannot miss. Then there is a Master List. This encompasses things that have no deadline, items that you would absolutely love to do, or big projects that will take weeks or months to complete. My HIT list incorporate all of those categories in an Excel document, landscape orientation. When things get completed on my HIT list, I start moving items over from the Master list. These new items are then broken down into component parts. For example, I move ""complete my dissertation"" over to the HIT list and set goals such as ""look up research articles"" or ""finish introduction section by June 1st.""  Hope that helps.

You'll make friends, develop character, have fun, appreciate down time and have some extra cash for school (or blowing if it makes you happy).

selfimprovement,3alyft,imaybeanidiot,2,Sun Jun 21 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"It's never too late to learn an instrument, or learn anything really. You just have to make a plan and stick with it. I personally went through something similar. I learnt piano as a child and got pretty good at it. But I stopped because my motivation, competition and admiration all came from my brother, who also stopped. It was about 7 years ago, and I had almost entirely forgotten everything except small snippets, but I don't know how it works together.  My advice is start with the instrument that interests you the most, start simple. Learn scales, learn to read sheet music and get a decent foundation of music theory. This will help you improvise, compose and play music as well. Knowing how a piece was written really helps on your ability to learn it and add onto it."

There are plenty of people outside thinking ""Ooooh I'd like to do this and this... but I'm too old"" Don't be like them.  I'm 22 and I started playing the piano two years ago. Even my own piano teacher told me I'm too old to start, but I didn't care, because as long as you feel the desire to start something new, nothing can stop you. And yes, the first months were tough but the hardest part was not the learning itself. The hardest part was to stay decisive. Learning to play an instrument includes patience, patience and even more patience. But trust me it is totally worth it. Certainly I'm not a good pianist, but I'm better than anyone who said ""I'm too old for this"" and never tried to learn it. So, if you really want to play an instrument, then just do it and trust yourself that you are able to do so. If no one comes from the future to stop you from doing it, then how bad of a decision can it really be?"

Connecting with another person is great, especially when the desire to share advice is mutual.

But if you think he might even slightly not want to hear the same advice from you, do not share it.  Sometimes friendships are better preserved by putting things in a positive light.  When people want and are ready to hear hard truths (e.g. you always procrastinate, are late to everything and are overweight), you'll know.  When they're not...it could ruin the friendship."

You will fail at a lot of things, sometimes publicly, sometimes terribly, sometimes in ways that utterly destroy your life as you know it.

selfimprovement,3aif2p,a_th0m,2,Sun Jun 21 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"(Real Answer Added) The challenge aspect is to break your mental blocks that prevent you from doing something this outrageous i.e. hopping into a freezing shower. It supposedly transitions to other aspects of life but I've only been doing it a short time.  Edit; Not a real answer but useful info.  Refreshes you, wakes you up a bit more, makes your skin and hair look and feel healthier. Increased testosterone in males, closes your pores, increased venous bloodflow and less hot water to pay for ultimately. It's actually really nice, I recommend it as well.  I always start warm, and crank it low as it can go after stepping in. Start off cold if you're going for that extra adrenaline. Trust me on this one. Warning: Do not attempt if you have a bad heart."

selfimprovement,3ai8zm,mattyjd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"True, but before doing what my friend told me to do, the urge to get some Coca Cola was stronger than me, even if there were 6 bottles of cold water in the fridge. My body was so used to all the sugar and caffeine that I used to actually miss it and feel like I need my hourly dose. I used to get back from school/work and just grab a cold Coca Cola, because I couldn't handle anything else.   I've been drinking this stuff since I was about 7. It was a way of life for me, pretty much. Even though I knew it was bad for me, I still kept going.   I'm sure there's a psychological explanation to all of this, and still, I find this MC2 Method incredible. I can't wait until I test it on a variety of other 'features' I'm planning on implementing on myself. :)"
selfimprovement,3ai8zm,solidxmike,2,Sun Jun 21 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, I quit drinking Coca-cola cold turkey in July of 2009 (age 18); I'll elaborate.  First thing, it was not easy. I was raised drinking coke, it was part of my life, family, culture - it got to the point where I couldn't eat anything without drinking coke. As a child/teen I recall drinking cans upon cans of coke in the summers breaks from school. In my late teens (17/18) I drank about a liter a day and knew that I was on the road to obesity and diabetes if I continued (since diabetes is prevalent in my family).   I quit cold turkey, and I still recall the last coke I had - eating Mexican food with my exgf hoping that this coke would be the last one I ever drink. I suffered from caffeine withdrawals along with terrible headaches that lasted for about two weeks. I remember how painful they were because all I wanted to do was sleep and stay at home. Fortunately for me, I had an exgf who was supportive of my goals to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.   After about a month I noticed I lost weight from quitting coke (soda in general) and doing cardio in the afternoons (about 1-2 miles of run/walk). Just as Winter arrived, I had lost about 40lbs from running, working out, eating healthier and having confidence through the roof.   I said to myself - 'If I could go 6 months without drinking coke, I can go a year."" And that's exactly what I set out to do. Pretty soon a year became two years, and then four years, and now I'm on my sixth year of not having a SINGLE DROP of coke. When I walk through the soda isle at the grocery store, I'm not phased at all by coca cola or any other product (Dr. P, Pepsi, MtwDew, etc). When I see a coke bottle in the fridge, I don't even consider it as a drink because it's been so long that I don't remember, care to remember, or curious about drinking it again. I've gone 6 years now and I'm not gonna drink coke just for the hell of it and throwing all that hard work away.   Stay true to your core goal, the path you want to live by and be diligent about it. This sort of mindset will rub off in other aspects of your life, if you achieved your goal of not drinking coke then you can definitely succeed anything else! Let me know if there's anything I can help you with, questions, etc.   TL;DR - Quit cold turkey, had withdrawals, terrible headaches, 6 months later I weighed 40lbs less, 1yr passed, eventually now in my 6th year and coke (soda in general) does not phase me at all, prefer and genuinely love water. Lost 65lbs overall (exercise, and living healthier). Best decision I ever made."

selfimprovement,3ahcb2,sts816,8,Sat Jun 20 04:40:16 2015 UTC,"To quote Wikipedia, they technically shouldn't:   Generally speaking, a person who engages in an activity solely for fun is called a 'hobbyist', whereas a 'professional' generally engages in an activity for reward and an 'amateur' does so out of personal interest in an activity. While an amateur may be as skilled as a professional, a professional receives compensation while an amateur generally does not.   And being an amateur programmer myself, I find it very important to have as well a hobby that brings instant realtime ""fun"". Sometimes in my spare time I feel like working on my projects, and other times I don't have the energy for it. That's nothing to blame yourself for.  The hobby's purpose is to fill up the zone between being engaged and productive and being a couch potato. It doesn't have to be mindless browsing, it can be something you can get good at it, too, such as sports or video games or any other activity where the process itself is enjoyable."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,lshevtsov,7,Sat Jun 20 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think you need to remind yourself that these small Nitty gritty details allow you to partake in the process of CREATION which I think is the one you really-like.  For example I'm a musician..and I HATE practising scales..but I also know they contribute to my overall goal of being a better player.  I think it's important when you feel ""bogged down"" to remind yourself of the big picture. Which is the WHY of learning these small details. The reason is because it helps you enjoy the big picture."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,Bofonic,2,Sat Jun 20 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"I feel that the kind of hobby you describe can sometimes feel like work. I experienced it with programming (games and other apps). There's usually a beginning of a project when everything feels like it's just flowing from my fingers and it's very low effort. And sometimes, the projects end in this phase, and it was just a nice little experiment. Sometimes, I want to push them further, and this is where it can turn into some kind of work. For example polishing a game that you feel is close to being finished can feel like hard work, but then it's also a nice and rewarding feeling being able to show it to someone and enjoy seeing them playing it.  There is a line there however, when it just becomes too much. Some years ago, I started dancing a lot, and over time transitioned into being an amateur dance teacher for the local dance community at university and other places. In the beginning, it was an awesome experience, seeing how much fun the people had learning and being rewarded by seeing how they progressed. But then it turned into real work, since it was hard to take breaks since I was expected to be in class, and by the point it had grown to three evenings a week, the feeling quite suddenly collapsed and turned around on itself. I got angry with myself when I had to run to get to the class, missed quiet evenings with my SO, and lost the fun of dancing for myself. Now, after being in a kind of limbo state for almost a year, I decided I would quit it completely for who knows how long to see if I can recover the old feeling.  I would say when your commitment is relatively low (you can either sit down and do some work on your project or not, instead of having a schedule where others depend on you), and you still feel ok with your work, and when there is some kind of end to it (i.e. you define what ""done"" means for you and how long it will take you to get there), you should be ok. Once you notice your feelings about the hobby changing as drastically as I described above, you might have to change your approach."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,SpookyFM,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:01:14 2015 UTC,"You're right about the last part. Its difficult for me to do anything when there isn't a defined ""done"". If things get too open ended, I start getting really distracted, lose interest, and never finish."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,intetsu,2,Sat Jun 20 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this,... this is something I am challenged with as well, and I couldn't quite figure out how to put these thoughts in to words. I am coming to realize that if I just want to do something entertaining with my time, I could just go read a book, watch a movie, buy something, etc. If I want to feel a sense of accomplishment, that is a COMPLETELY different enterprise. Accomplishment comes from overcoming a challenge, being able to look back at what you did or learned and feel a sense of personal pride. ""Entertainment"" starts feeling hollow and meaningless after a time. That is the dissatisfaction that I feel with myself when I walk away from a project.  So, how to overcome this? Start framing a goal for your effort. Don't be TOO ambitious, but do be directed towards, short term achievable ""steps"". Then each step will feel like an accomplishment, and you will move steadily towards a true sense of fulfillment."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,intetsu,2,Sat Jun 20 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"My problem is that things like reading books, playing video games, etc always feel like a waste of time to me even if I do enjoy them. They don't really get me any closer to my long term goals so I have a hard time putting energy into them. Things like electronics, for example, could help me get a better job in the future because I'm learning a new skill that's applicable to a lot of different stuff.   Part of me just wants to sit back and destroy some people in Call of Duty and another part wants to start modeling this idea for a product I have that I could have manufactured in China and sell on Amazon haha. One of those is clearly more work-esque and my mind tells me I should be doing it because its more productive, if less fun, than video games."
selfimprovement,3ahcb2,Ostirious,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same way. The ""hollow"" feeling that I described is the inability to enjoy entertainment activities because it is not moving me towards a bigger better life... BUT... The things we enjoy for their own sake are the best way towards a better and more fulfilling life... Not all the ""shoulds"" that we can never completely put ourselves in to. What are the things that you enjoy doing for their own sake? Because they give you a visceral pleasure? For me, I loved technology, playing with computers and networks ... and it lead to a successful career. Now I am looking for the next step... A ""hobby"" that I can enjoy for itself. Yet I am always nagged by the thought that my hobby should be serving some grand design, which actually makes every small thing I do intimidating and into ""work""..."

In my case is basically anything that does NOT use a computer screen. I'm kayaking, taking karate classes and looking to do some camping in the near future. I don't force myself to do any of them because I really enjoy them a lot and I actually look forward to the next kayaking trip or the next set of karate techniques/moves I will be learning.   My advise would be to start looking for a hobby that is not technical, but that will test your comfort zone. Any activity outdoors can be a good start."

Hobbies are supposed to be a kind of work, as opposed to those activities where you can sit and zone out for a while (eg reddit, reading, video games). Both are necessary. Your hobbies are difficult ones too, more logic intense and what not.   If you're also asking how to make them not feel like you're forcing yourself to do something, I've had the same problem.  What I've found helps is that you kinda have to be in the mindset of your goals. You gotta get yourself excited about what you're doing. It will seem difficult at first but if you have this idea in mind, say that website your talking about, you just let your dreams run wild a little bit, get yourself excited, and then you begin to actually enjoy the the process, because you're constantly improving and getting to your goals.   It's funny that this comes up now because I've felt the same way recently. Allow yourself to dream some more. Get excited about your work. It'll give you the energy to  make some awesome things.

selfimprovement,3agfzg,findingacareer101,2,Fri Jun 19 23:34:28 2015 UTC,"To make friends, be a friend.  What do you want in a friend? I want someone who's interested in who I am and what I do, who makes my life better by being in it, who has self-respect and is strong-willed, and who respects my boundaries and feelings — and I want to be that sort of person for them too. It's a hard balance, but gets easier as you do more of it. My strategy to get from zero friends to a handful of close friends and a heap of okay friends was to concentrate on just one person at a time. I started with one friendship and together, we approached more people and brought them into the group one by one. Now I'm confident enough to make friends by myself.  Probably the most useful advice is to be aware of how comfortable people are. If you're talking to a stranger and notice them getting antsy, excuse yourself (""Okay, I'm gonna get some food! See you later!""). If they're giving out signals that they're uninterested, and you notice them straight away and don't force your company on them, they'll be more open to talking to you again later. They'll know that future interactions with you will be pleasant, instead of seeing you walking over and going, ""Ugh, here we go.""  Doing favours and things for people is nice, but don't let yourself be a sucker. If you don't feel comfortable offering help, then don't offer. If you're asked to do something sucky, saying no is perfectly fine. For example, I don't 'fix computers' for people anymore because it's just a drag. If someone asks me for help I tell them, ""I won't fix it, but I can teach you how to fix it."" Most people are happy with that, but other people (who just wanted me to do their job for them) weasel out of it."

I'm one of the people that ""makes friends so easily"". I'm funny, and outgoing. These are things I'm told, anyway. In my own reality I am very shy and anxious. I over think, and over analyze. Just because it seems easy to other people it doesn't mean that it is. I struggle everyday with talking to people. It gets easier. Be hopeful, optimistic, and persevere. Push yourself a little bit further everyday. Give yourself a break on days what you're not forced to leave the house. Otherwise, try to talk to someone new everyday. Be kind, helpful, sincere, and respectful. Use context clues to develop relationships. Good luck out there!"

What pleasure and what benefit? I tend to look for truly compelling reasons.  Not just ""I want to be healthier"" but ""I want to look in the mirror and stop hating my body."" or ""To feel more attractive and attract a boyfriend/girlfriend"" Things that might really resonate  Similarly what are the painful consequences of not changing? ""Feeling forever ugly or being alone forever"" or ""Dying of a heart attack at 35""  3) What specific action can I take? AKA Finding the right Strategy. Also notice what is working and what isn't? If you haven't achieved yoru goal after a monthly review what about your strategy needs changing? We need WISDOM in our approach.  4) Condition the desire and make it a compelling vision- Review the Goal Daily imagining how good it feels when you achieve.

Just draw something pointless, get a colouring book, do something arty (even if it's tiny). The more you do it, the more you are geared up for applying yourself. I started journalling January 2014, and I've found that my journal entries nowadays get to 2,000 words without even trying... It's just consistency and practice. If you truly care about your art, you will say ""Yes, I'm not feeling like doing it but I know long term that if I force myself against all resistance and create SOMETHING art related, I will IMPROVE in the long term"". You're not looking for this perfect set of feelings, that's not reliable! You are looking to grow by any % possible. Fuck it, it's incredibly hard to quantify this stuff but even growing 0.001% in your art ability is better than growing 0%.  Push through the resistance is all I can say."

selfimprovement,3aallj,EricLanigan,2,Thu Jun 18 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"1): What do you REALLY want? - I want to touch the youth through fitness and nutrition. 2): Why do you want that?  I want to find a way to live my passion by giving to others and leaving a legacy. I believe that if you are not living your life to serve others, you are wasting your time on earth. I want to spend my time here wisely because I know my time on earth is limited.  3): If you had what you want, what would that be like? - If I had what I wanted, I would wake up in the morning, work on myself (Workout, research, and self improve), work on improving the lives of others ( reach out to youth, and maybe others older (whoever needs help)) then go to bed.  4): What's stopping you from creating what you want? - fear of failing, I have a full time job that takes up a lot of my time, myself, knowing the right information to get started. * Bonus * I recently was recognized for pursuing a dream of mine that I have had since I was a child. There is a man that lives down the street from me with Cerebral Palsy, and since I was a young boy I have told myself I was going to give his family the funds to take him to Disney World one day. Last year  (December of 2014) I completed this goal and dream, by giving his family what I had saved up since my first job. I gave them 2000 dollars towards the trip, and our local newspaper (The Toledo Blade) did an article about the deed, and with the community's help, the family was able to take the trip this March together. They had the time of their lives, and the connection I have made with the family is priceless. I know that not all deeds can be this big, but I also know that if everyone did something little for someone else, the whole world could change. I know that this is not the only thing I have in me to help others, and throughout my journey of life, I have realized that information changes situations. Not money, not resources, but information. With the right information, I know that I can change the lives of others, all I need is ACTION. It would be great to have a mentor to help me achieve my dreams, I would hope that I can help achieve his or hers as well. Thank you!"

If you know that you deserve respect than why would you worry about them? I think its worth thinking about this stuff because anger doesnt help you, it hurts you socially and in other ways.  Also you could try to figure out what changed a year ago."
selfimprovement,3a8prp,taovo1,3,Thu Jun 18 02:53:43 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it has to do with feeling self aware.  A lot of our behaviours whether we know it or not have been pre-scripted by our past experiences and people we may have learned or modelled them from. Thus these behaviours have become natural for us.  The thing is when we don't CHOOSE how we're going to respond we're being reactive like animals.  Stimulus= Something triggers you.  Response= You get angry.  As human beings though we have the beauty of being able to be self-aware and evaluate our behaviours and choose to respond differently!  Try this..For the next while watch yourself and observe your own behaviour and feelings closely like a scientist!   When you find yourself getting angry notice the feeling inside of you and Push the mental stop button. I've mentioned this in other posts but I like to give myself a pinch to bring myself out of my own head. After you do...resolve to handle the situation in a better way.  I would suggest even going as far as to rehearse it in your head...Think about to a situation where you overrreacted and imagine yourself handling the situation differently...even look in front of the mirror and rehearse what you would've said.  By doing this we can form new behaviours and responses in our heads and you'll be prepared for when it happens.  Think of it like a Musician practising the music before hand before the big concert! Except your big concert comes when you notice yourself starting the negative behaviour!  Hope this helps!

I live with someone who can be difficult at times and continually pushes my buttons so sometimes I don't know whether I'm a dick in general or just around them. It can be very stressful being around them but I have no choice.  I like the idea of rehearsal and will definitely try that one out, that's really cool!

selfimprovement,3a5km8,Wooden-boots,7,Wed Jun 17 12:05:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty useful understanding of willpower but I'd also like to point out going deeper into your actual mindset using things like habit formation, abundance, finding and allowing  joy in the process itself. Even mentally labeling an arduous task sets you back a ton. It's crucial to not look at the outcome or define it as being a means to an end. Habits and mindset are literally key to using no willpower at all.   I go to the gym consistently 3-4x a week to do heavy weight training whether I feel like it or not and at this point, I don't even think about it and I thoroughly enjoy it. Sure it was kinda tough at first but I always found something I loved about it and let a natural enthusiasm arise. I allow myself to feel good for the fact that I even went even if I have a horrible workout.  Even doing absolute mind-grueling tasks, try to find something about it that you enjoy. If you view it as requiring willpower then you WILL use willpower and find it just incredibly tedious.  The whole concept of willpower comes from a scarcity based mindset instead of abundance. You know you have a limited amount of it so that actually makes you frustrated and fearful. Your natural self talk comes in. ""Damnit I can't wait until this over, i can't focus anymore, I don't wanna do this anymore, this is boring, I have a long way to go"". But if you come from abundance, you believe that the experience in and of itself is just another experience. You'll make light out of it, and you'll naturally find joy and interest.  Realistically of course, there are a lot of things in life we really don't want to do but how you feel about it and view it is more important than defining whether the task itself needs any labeling. If I'm in a bad mood and in a negative headspace, even things I usually love to do will require will power.   If I'm in a positive mood, and I'm present then even boring tasks don't require any willpower because I know it serves a purpose to accomplish something. Instead of thinking ""Damnit I gotta clean my room and take out the trash"" -100 willpower. I'd think ""I'm glad I get to clean my room, I'm becoming an organized productive person."" Put on good music/something comedic, dance around, etc.  While I agree with OP that you must exercise willpower, you should also be aware of your mindset going into any task otherwise you'll make the simplest things a mountain to climb over."

selfimprovement,3a6ifz,JAshkin,2,Wed Jun 17 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"Try to focus on ONE thing at a time.  A lot of people I talk to have this problem ""I have too many interests"" PICK ONE FOR NOW and really focus on it.   But in order to do so ask yourself this  1) What do I want? - What's the specific measurable Goal? Is it to lose 15 pounds in 3 months?   Or is it to get X amount done on your project in 2 months?   What is your vision?  2) Why do I want it? What's the reason?   Will it help me financially? Will it help me socially? Imagine what your life would look like if you succeeded! How good it would feel and the kind of person you would grow into?  In contrast look at the consequences of failing? What does failure feel like? How doesn't your life change? Are you failing to live up to a standard? What sort of pain comes from failure?  3) The Plan! Find the right strategy that works for you. The thing with failure is that most people fail not because of a personal failing but because they try a few things that don't work and then give up blaming it on THEMSELVES.   How long would you give a baby to walk before you give up on it?...EXACTLY.. Sometimes we just need to keep changing our strategy until we find one that works. We have to be wise and Notice what IS and ISN'T working in our plan.  It's like when Edison failed for the 9999th time...he didn't interpret it as a failure he said ""I've discovered the 9999th way NOT to invent the light bulb."" for him failing was a learning process...There are no failures..only results.   In my opinion it's really important to get a clear idea of WHAT you want first..and WHY you want it and review that goal every day with real emotional desire. That way you condition it into your nervous system and body. There's a part of your brain called the Reticular Activating System that filters out the white noise and helps you stay focus...direct it on what you really want in life!"

My life has been drastically changed in ways I will carry with me until I die, and for that I owe to life lessons during college, professors, random moments i thought were insignificant but turned out to be life changing, having the chance to find myself internally without having to pack up and change my surroundings,  learning to be disiplined, learning about people and cultures and myself and what im capable of, work experience, just growing into a mature person overall.  I am not just paying thousands of dollars for a good transcript and a paper at the end. I'm literally paying for the biggest and most life altering years of my life, allowing the most brilliant minds to teach me more often than not life lessons next to scientific lessons, and in the process I gain the degree at the end. So fucking worth it that it makes me sick to think about where I would be without it. I'm so grateful for university it sometimes brings me to tears. I don't care if this is lame, I just want at least one person to know that college is not just a degree. It's one of a million things you earn during college. And it's worth the time and effort if you put yourself in the right mind set."

But, honestly, learning the concepts is more important than learning the languages (Knowing what's a variable, loops and flow control, object-oriented stuff, design patterns, etc) You can learn a new language in a few hours to a few days, but learning the concepts behind programing and how to apply them takes a bit longer."

He gave the analogy of crossing the street, if you walk into the street, suddenly get doubt that it's safe, stall, hesitate, then decide to go back then you have increased your chance of getting hit by the car. If you go or don't go then you're less likely to be hit by the car.   I started using this at work on a daily basis which rapidly improved my practice and started to eb into my life.

Everyone has so much going on, you're likely not high on their priority list."
selfimprovement,39y1jj,FlyingNarwhal,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"I love NYC. I feel like I ""belong"" here. Yeah, people will complain ""it's too crowded, it's smelly, the rent is too high"" (like someone else in this thread), and yeah, those things are true, but they don't outweigh everything that I love about the city. In a way, I kind of like the city for its flaws; if everything were perfect all the time, life would be super boring. And that's what I love about NYC, it's never boring. There's always a new adventure waiting for you 20 feet outside your apartment door, new things to do, new people to meet, new things to see.  The thing with NYC is that it is what you make of it. Often times the people who are miserable here are people who don't take initiative, and expect the city to hand things to them, and it doesn't. NYC gives you innumerable opportunities, but it's up to you to seize them, it will never give anything to you. If you just sit in your apartment, not doing anything and expecting things to happen to you, yeah, you're going to be disappointed and lonely. The people I've known who have had trouble making friends in NYC are the people who have never tried looking for friends, they've just expected that friends would come to them. No one's going to hand you life on a silver platter, you have to go out and look for it.  And as far as self-improvement goes, I'd say that's definitely the biggest thing that NYC has taught me. I've learned self-confidence; I've learned to stand up for myself, to be assertive. If you don't learn that, it's easy to feel run over by the city, like it's too big and too much to handle. It sounds harsh, but the truth is, the city doesn't care about you, it doesn't care about your feelings. Which forces you to do that, it forces you to assert yourself. And I'm actually really grateful for that, I don't think I would have learned how to do it otherwise. I spent so long being shy and passive, letting other people take advantage of me... and I quickly learned that you can't do that here. If that cab tries to cut you off while crossing the street, you say ""Dammit, it's my right to use this crosswalk!"" If you want something, you have to ask for it.  I definitely have changed in the 4 years I've lived here. I feel like I've discovered more about who I am. I've had to look inside myself and say ""okay, what is it I want?"", and have learned to go out and pursue it, instead of waiting for it to come to me. NYC has definitely changed me for the better."
selfimprovement,39y1jj,BCSteve,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't lived in a smaller city but I wager that making friends here in NYC is harder, not easier than in other, smaller cities. People have tons of options for socializing, so they often find what works for them and then keep their social circle fairly closed once established. You have to either 1) make a strong effort to break into an existing circle by providing value in some way or 2) be creative and find the places where other people are looking to build a circle. Running groups, social sports leagues, book clubs, alumni networks are some examples."

selfimprovement,39whoj,supper_salad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:58:16 2015 UTC,"maybe try HabitRPG? It lets you put a list of things you want to do daily, habits you want to improve, and a to-do list for the day/whatever you see fit, and makes it fun by making it into a game where you get points for being good."
selfimprovement,39whoj,brotatojones,3,Mon Jun 15 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"The app is awful though and often doesn't save my progress, this I would have to go online on my laptop or else I would die. I love HABIT RPG but the app sucks."

selfimprovement,39whoj,brotatojones,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:42:58 2015 UTC,I have been using the App for ages. Very little has improved and often the app just tells you to go to their website.

selfimprovement,39whoj,brotatojones,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"I use Way of Life. You enter the habits you're trying to do daily, and very simply say whether or not you did them each day. It allows you to see trends over time, so you can say ""I haven't had a soda in 3 months.""  It is good for not breaking a string of successes, because you can clearly see them."
selfimprovement,39whoj,kornork,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"I recommend Momentum. It is pretty basic habit tracker, but has a great design and widget."
selfimprovement,39whoj,Gouden_Eeuw,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone is using Wunderlist. I am giving it a try and growing to like it a lot. You don't need Internet either. Habit rpg is good. But you need to pay a lot to get the full experience, despit the owners claim. I am a subscriber and I find it unfair for those who are not. Also their app is terrible and needs data for it to work. Even then its limited, so unless you have self control and handle just going to their website and not end up dicking around online, then the website can be great.   The forest app is great to for e you to not mess around on your phone when you need to do work. You kill trees if you procrastinate."
selfimprovement,39ux28,kornork,8,Mon Jun 15 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's hard to come up with good database search terms for this topic, but it interests me also.   It sounds like it makes sense, but I think then also how people can be negative influences, in that we spend time trying NOT to be like them, in which case they still have an impact of who we are but in the opposite direction, depending on our self-image and our aspirations.  I've been told by someone who studied linguistics that your accent isn't entirely environmental but tends to be used to project your identity in certain ways. This also affects the use of vernacular, and many people change the way they speak without even thinking about depending on who they are speaking to.   In this way, it seems there is more to how you act than just who you are with, but also how you want them to see you.   The best evidence I could find for this was to do with a study on English as a second-language amongst Quebecois French-speakers and Mandarin/Cantonese-speakers in Canada - here  Other things I found: A study on the tendency of 3 or 4 year olds to imitate actions in certain ways based on who was in the room with them at the time.  - it suggests that while most of the time the children will choose to do something based on how efficient it is, if they're exposed to a greater number of other children doing it in a less efficient way, they will then conform to that.  When alone, they'll go back to doing things the better way.  That's interesting but not conclusive for what you're asking about.   This study looks at adult identity being formed in adolescence and suggests that peer group do influence one's perception of norms around what it means to be an adult.    Peers and family pop up in lots of studies on what influences young people to misbehave in class, smoke, drink, and participate in physical activity, having a strong influence there, but it doesn't seem to be measured on time, except for this one which just mentions in the conclusion that ""peers significantly influence physical activity behaviour over time"".   I'd take suggestions for good ways of searching for something more relevant to the OP.  I have uni access to the Web of Science database."

selfimprovement,39ux28,Lightfiend,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"This was the first thing to come to my mind too. There's no doubt that your immediate social circle has an influence on you and your habits. Being the ""average of the 5 people who you spend the most time with"" is just a simplistic way of putting it."
selfimprovement,39ux28,gelastic_farceur,8,Mon Jun 15 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"If it does and you are married with two kids, you better have two fantastic friends to make up the average."
selfimprovement,39ux28,daveodavey,3,Mon Jun 15 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"What if you spent all your time on your own? Like you where stranded on a dessert island or something all your life. Would you become ultra no one. Or become a spiney tree frog who lives in a nest near your camp. And you'd just hop around the island and try and stick your food to your tounge and eventually die because obviously you have a small not sticky tongue? What would happen then op, what?"
selfimprovement,39ux28,keerin,3,Mon Jun 15 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's supposed to be taken so literally. It's more of a heuristic for improving yourself through the psychology of social identity and group membership. https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Group_dynamics#Group_membership_and_social_identity  It's human nature to try be more like the group of people you spend most of your time with. You pick up both good and bad traits according to your social groups and these will be shared, along with ideas about norms and values, with the people you most associate with.   I'll find some studies that could at least be used to support the statement that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with."

selfimprovement,39ux28,creamybunny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any studies on this beyond what was already shared but I find your examples a bit funny since I used to be a shut-in/recluse and am technically now in the modelling industry despite not knowing anyone in it beforehand. I think it's more like people can and do influence others. We're able to figure out our identity because of how it differs and relates to other's actions and words. A person can change based on who (or what) they're around most but overall, a person is a individual. We all have our own ambitions and reasons. Because of that, I don't think it could be a statement. A possibility, sure, but in no way a rule."
selfimprovement,39ux28,UhBlake,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:42:09 2015 UTC,"Holds true for me, but with the five friends I spend the most time with. I guess close friends are kinda the family you get to choose, so maybe they're a more accurate reflection of who you are than just the five people you interact with most, which might not be your choice at all. (Parents, coworkers, etc.)"
selfimprovement,39ux28,waterpanther,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"I think you are over thinking it and trying to be mathmatical with it. For me this proved extremely true. I used to hang out with a lot of kids that partied too hard and didn't have ambition, i stopped hanging out with them and now hang out with really sharp people (post college) and it changed my life around. I just removed my self from them and try and surround my self with really successful people and I became more successful my self. Everyone im around eats healthy, works out, has a good job, loves to travel, and see music. We all push each other farther and harder as a team. There is my example for it being true."
selfimprovement,39ux28,waterpanther,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should be taken at face value as true. There are people using this quote as a reason for you to abandon your family, your close friends. If your network has no value, or if it's something other than your 5 closest associates that is truly the driver, it would be nice to know that before cutting ties to your mother."
selfimprovement,39ux28,Hillbillyjacob,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it says at all cut ties your your family its pretty much just means you will have a lot of tendencies of the 5 people you are around the most. I don't even know where you came up with your idea for what it means. People generally surround them selves with people with similar hobbies and interests so it makes quite a lot of sense that you will start to be a representation of them. This is obviously not a etched in stone rule and people always make excuses to ""cut ties with their family"" (seriously no idea how you came to that conclusion) based off a phrase they treat like a law."
selfimprovement,39ux28,HappyHerpes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"It's a popular quote by Jim Rohn. While I think cutting ties is extreme, I have heard it used as justification.  As to where I came up with the idea of what it means, I frequently listen to podcasts like The Art of Charm and Knowledge for Men, where the hosts and guests often bring it up as a truism."
selfimprovement,39ux28,cecilkorik,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:19:20 2015 UTC,This is absolutely true. I've severed contact with life long friends that I've just decided were poisoning my well.

selfimprovement,39ux28,glottony,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"I decide to still treat the word ""average"" literally so logic can be used to deduce that this is not true.  (1) Everybody is the average of the five persons he spends the most time with.  (2) Deduction: If (1) then a person that only interacts with one person is the same as that one person. -So if you are not a total shutin and you meet a total shut-in, the moment you do, he becomes a copy of you.... pretty weird.   (3) Deduction: All persons that are either the top or the bottom of the attribute in question have only persons among their 5 that are exactly the same as them in regard to that attribute. Otherwise they would not be the top/bottom. -This pretty much refutes (1), in regards to wealth as long as the richest persons are neither shut-ins nor do two rich people have exactly the same wealth."
