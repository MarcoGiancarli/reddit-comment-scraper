toledo,3e0qdz,wackybones,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"Oregon is a nice area, and Bay Pointe seems like it would be a good choice. If you are looking to save some money take a look at the eastern end of Northwood. There are some town houses off Curtice Rd which aren't too bad, though not sure if anything is available.  Oak Harbor is nice but it is pretty rural, not sure you'd be able to find much there.  I'd stay away from the University Area- it would be quite a drive.  If you are looking for something more cosmopolitan, you may want to check downtown as well. It's definitely on the up-and-up with a lot of businesses making investments these days (eg, Promedica).  Good luck and welcome to the area!"

toledo,3e0qdz,shitforbrians,2,Tue Jul 21 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"Hey! Funny stuff, I have a friend moving to Oregon so I've been walking the neighborhood looking for rent signs. Unfortunately this area tends to be pretty established families. There are a few apt complexes - two on Navarre St and one on Wheeling - both in safe areas, generally low crime. Both have a few openings which frankly I am too lazy to research. I'm sure the dog thing could be tricky, and I respect your honesty there, but worth a shot.  It seems Craig's is the best option for scouting. The only newspaper in the area is the Toledo Blade, if you want to check classifieds.  The UT population is dispersed and a lot of people commute. The area runs the gamut on safety, niceness, and party population. Didn't go to school there so someone else will have to weigh in. However the commute to Davis-Besse (I assume you mean the plant on the lake?) will be fairly long though.  If you want some man-on-the-ground help with Oregon stuff pm me."

toledo,3dmz4o,Passan,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:33 2015 UTC,Decriminalize generally means that if you are caught with a certain amount (like less than an oz) you get a small fine and your stuff taken. But you don't get a felony charge or any jail time. But it doesn't make it medically or recreationally legal.
toledo,3dmz4o,iREDDITandITsucks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"Just one point. While a drug possession under the current toledo municipal code can result in a driver's license suspension, it's at the judge's discretion and the judge never does it. Now a drug conviction under the Ohio revised code comes with a mandatory driver's license suspension."
toledo,3dmz4o,Beiki,3,Fri Jul 17 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"The bill includes a segment that says ""Prevent law enforcement agencies from reporting marijuana violations to any authority above the local city attorney"". So I'd imagine if its never reported on the state level you wouldn't have to worry about a suspension. Although I'm not a lawyer so I couldn't say for sure. I'm just excited for all the money the city won't be spending on marijuana enforcement."
toledo,3dmz4o,Beiki,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:20 2015 UTC,I would be interested to see if that would bar city employees from reporting drug violations under the Ohio revised code to the BMV. I'd vote for it however I don't live in Toledo.
toledo,3dmz4o,Beiki,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Just coming from my knowledge of medical marijuana rules, they usually allow the company to set there policy on the consumption of marijuana. Even though they're not breaking any laws they would still be breaking company policy and still get fired. For city employees though that would be interesting. Again though that's just my assumption."
toledo,3dmz4o,mjvasko,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:41 2015 UTC,That wasn't what I was talking about. I'm talking about drivers license suspensions.
toledo,3dmz4o,isaacsploding,0,Fri Jul 17 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"Ah I misread what you said, got it now. Realistically if there's no fines or jail time for any marijuana related offense I can't see them prosecuting anyone. Even if they did theoretically here it says ""The local ordinance protects from the suspension of Driver’s License due to any Drug Abuse Conviction as is currently required by Ohio State Law."" So that clears that up."

toledo,3dgzef,AskADude,3,Thu Jul 16 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"We don't have cable TV service, and my wife is home all day with the kids.  1080p Netflix can run somewhere around 4-5 GB/hr.  If we say 5GB/hr, that's 100 hours before we hit the cap.  I don't think it's a stretch to say that Netflix is on in our house 3 hours a day."

toledo,3daz3s,st1y_wan_kenobi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"I recommend you test that water that you're buying.  If its spring water, you might be surprised what you find for TDS readings.  Let me give you my experiences.  Toledo Tap Water: 226 PPM  Spring Water from Walmart (20oz bottles) 298 PPM  Reverse Osmosis filtered tap water: 16 PPM  You can genuinely taste, and feel the difference drinking properly filtered water.  Its overall cheaper than bottled, as you're basically paying city water rates (which are freakishly low compared to bottled) for water thats 90-95% cleaner than tap / spring.  If you don't have a Hydrometer to test the total dissolved solids ratings on your water, they're only about $10-15 @ Amazon.  I paid $189 for my counter top (yes, those in apartments, this is your best option) unit, its been wonderful.  I fill 1-2 1 gallon milk jugs every few days, fridge, and drink from it, takes about 20-30 minutes to fill a 1 gallon container.  I also use it for my plants, pets, and mixing in foods now.    Its really a huge difference, and these types of scares are not near a concern to me."
toledo,3daz3s,Ohmahtree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"well frankly the convenience of reaching into my fridge and grabbing a few bottles when i'm thirsty beats having to drink my well water.  what it takes to city water might be a cheaper alternative... but filtering my water to ""better than bottled"" is simply not an option. filter it all you want, you're still tasting sulfur... unless you want to drop a few grand on a proper filter and replace filter medium constantly.  i shower in well water, i use it to water my lawn, but drinking, cooking, or even brushing my teeth with it isn't all that appealing."

toledo,3daz3s,the0riginalp0ster,0,Thu Jul 16 13:11:17 2015 UTC,You realize most bottled water is just tap water from somewhere right?

toledo,3daz3s,st1y_wan_kenobi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"I do indeed.  I mean, because it's bottled water it must be safe right?  There's this mad rush because the lemonade stand guy at cedar point indicated that the water isn't safe.  However, before 8/4/2014 nobody gave it much thought, even though those conditions were almost certainly present and not test for in 2011 and who knows how many times before that.  I just don't think bottled water is a solution to this problem.  It adds a ton of bottles that need dealt with.  It involves shipping water possibly thousands of miles that could be sourced much closer.  Honestly - I think that the water treatment stuff needs turned over to a regional water authority or something so it isn't just Toledo in charge of it - especially when nearly half of the users of that water are not City residents."
toledo,3daz3s,jmslagle,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:45:15 2015 UTC,and when there's a recall on that water i've still got 7 cases of water to drink in front of it.  i keep everything in rotation so i don't have to worry about it.  and as far as your plastic concerns or your fuel consumption concerns... honestly i could give a fuck less about it. they can use the money they steal from me on payday to fix those problems instead of handing it out to non-contributors in exchange for minority votes.
toledo,3daz3s,st1y_wan_kenobi,2,Fri Jul 17 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"For everyone curious about the ""sheen"" on their water or in the toilet bowl, it's from carbon. It's a safe additive that governments add to water supplies to absorb and neutralize toxins. The levels they're adding to the Toledo water is still quite low and safe to consume. It's been done since 1974 across the country."
toledo,3daz3s,RarScaryFrosty,4,Thu Jul 16 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"The water is fine to drink. The film you are seeing is a result of increased alum in the water, a compound used to help make water safe to drink.   The water plant is making preparations to deal with any algael blooms that occur later this summer, so we should not see an issue like what we had last year. On the chance we do, you can be sure they will inform people."
toledo,3daz3s,fryamtheiman,0,Thu Jul 16 04:43:19 2015 UTC,"I am done drinking Toledo water.  Say what you want about it being ""safe"", but here is the deal - why did it take a full month for them to send out a notification to everyone that they have change the chemicals in 2% of our water supply because they simply ran out of money?  Do you not see something wrong with this?"
toledo,3daz3s,the0riginalp0ster,2,Thu Jul 16 13:16:25 2015 UTC,"Probably because very few people have cared about what went in the water until last year. Now they need to update people on every change they make?  Considering I know a few of the guys out who work at the water plant, when they tell me it is unsafe, I'll stop drinking it. When they tell me it is safe, I'll keep drinking it because I have no reason to distrust them. I'm not going to dictate to you what you should do, that's your choice. I'm telling you the water is safe to drink because it is right now, and I'd say don't drink it as I told people last year after I found out from those guys that the cyanobacteria levels were high. If you choose not to, that's fine, it's your money to spend how you please."
toledo,3daz3s,fryamtheiman,0,Thu Jul 16 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"You can tell me what you want, just like your friends can tell you what they want.  My point remains that only the people in that facility know what is going on in that plant besides what is now being force publicly.  Also, studies may have shown that adding certain chemicals in water are ""deemed safe"".  However, that can also be considered an opinion as there are many unexplained diseases or unexplained deaths every year.  Drinking bottled water does require the display of ingredients ."
toledo,3daz3s,the0riginalp0ster,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are trying to imply unexplained deaths, in part, are caused by tap water. Got news for you, I can link drinking water to absolutely every single person that has died, regardless of the cause. I'm going to bet unexplained deaths can also be linked to the air people breathe, or to exposure to various forms of radiation, or any number of other things.   Correlation does not equal causation. You are either on the verge of or are already implying a conspiracy theory, and we all know how logical those are. If you want to say you prefer bottled water, fine. However, you are implying, without any logical reasoning, that drinking public water is dangerous. Unexplained deaths are labeled as unexplained for a reason."
toledo,3daz3s,fryamtheiman,0,Fri Jul 17 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"I am not implying a conspiracy at all.  I am simply stating that I would not trust anything put in public water.  If you trust everything the government provides for you, then I feel sorry for you.  Just like all the people who have died from lung cancer before their was a surgeon general or the people who have died from working around asbestos.  A conspiracy theory would have a reasoning.  Mine doesn't have a reason but simply they just follow what someone told them was ""deemed safe"".  I am a firm believer in science, but I also can see very clearly that the wealthy Toledoans are not drinking tap water either.  So go ahead and enjoy your Toledo water.

We went around asking and they freely admitted was incredibly disappointing.  Only Stanley's were actually homemade perogie. They were good but I'll never pay to get into a festival just to be overcharged for something I can buy any day of the year at Stanley's Market.

I'm worried that instead of having Pac-Man VS and Street Fighter tournaments it's going to be 5 dollar domestic buckets and ""nerds"" with Star Wars shirts.

toledo,3cjn55,lostwookiee,-5,Wed Jul 8 12:48:45 2015 UTC,You need an ID to dump ?  This is disenfranchisement !  This is raciest stuff at its finest some people can't afford ID's and don't get utitlity bills.
toledo,3cjn55,wkdravenna,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:13 2015 UTC,If they can't afford an ID then they don't have a license and can't afford a truck or trailer and would have no way of dumping anything anyways. Your troll logic does not apply.
toledo,3cjn55,postal_platypus,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen many of toledoans with custom built trailers to follow behind their pedal bikes enroute to various locations such as omnisource on Dixie/Detroit/Telegraph. They might be able to have a similar rig, also I've seen many with carts. I just can't understand your logic sir. Do not attack me, we are discussing issues that matter.   This person you see we need to make sure they get fair treatment if they show up with a biked in trailer to dump. Equal rights for all citizens in concern to government matters.   Here is an image to describe a possible person you would turn away. Its socially unacceptable. ( http://realneo.us/system/files/Scrap-life-in-Cleveland-Ohi.jpg )"
toledo,3cjn55,wkdravenna,0,Wed Jul 8 23:10:28 2015 UTC,Another guy mentioned that an ID is $8.50 so realistically even a begger can afford one.
toledo,3cjn55,postal_platypus,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"Getting an ID is more compicated then that.  Applicant must provide proof of the following: Full legal name Date of birth Social Security number (if one has ever been assigned), Legal presence (U.S. Birth Certificate, valid U.S. Passport/Passport Card, Naturalization Papers, USCIS documents), Residency.  This means a person could be required to show other documents that they might not have access too. Meaning truely it costs more money then $8.50 cents. Especially if someone lost those documents in a fire, accident, eviction or other way. It can be very difficult if you were born far away to obtain a birth certificate for someone with little resources and lots of trash.   Obviously you don't care about the plight of some people that is fine. I just don't like how you just act like people who can't get ID's because of misfortune are second class citizens and are so willing to disenfranchise them."
toledo,3cjn55,wkdravenna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"Obviously there has to be ways to verify identitys to get an ID, I would have five different ones and be five different people if not. It has nothing to do with ""the plight of the common person"" and whatever. Last time I got a new ID also all I needed as a soc and a peice of mail."

toledo,3cjn55,wkdravenna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:34 2015 UTC,An ID card in Ohio is $8.50. If you can't afford an ID card then you have better things to worry about than dumping trash off.

A judge's personal or religious beliefs has no place in his or her application of settled law.  The Obergefell case really leaves no room for this sort of rationale - there is a constitutional right for same sex couples to marry civilly, and to deny them such a marriageis to violate their constitutional rights.    This is all quite disappointing, and while I am glad the court has a method by which there will be some judge available to marry same-sex couples, there remains no excuse for Judge McConnell's disregard of constitutional rights.  Calls for a mandamus action, imho."

toledo,3ci7wd,wkdravenna,10,Thu Jul 9 03:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's great that another judge performed the marriage. I disagree with your view of it being the court and that courts are slow to move.  In this instance, it was the judge that was the issue.  If his morals are that compromised by performing same sex marriage he should resign his position."
toledo,3ci7wd,Beagle_Gal,8,Wed Jul 8 03:26:56 2015 UTC,That's simply not good enough. What if some old bigoted white judge refused to marry an interracial couple? This needs more exposure and needs to be dealt with immediately.
toledo,3ci7wd,Spmckenz,-13,Wed Jul 8 10:53:29 2015 UTC,Government is the one who created these raciest marriage laws. They have no business being in marriage. All marriage should be outlawed in Ohio. Its nothing but a horrible financial tool that benefits one person when its over.    During several times in the Court due to being part of small claims the process is very slow.
toledo,3ci7wd,wkdravenna,7,Wed Jul 8 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're making an excuse for the judge by saying that sometimes the court just runs slow, but they flat out say they were told the judge ""doesn't do those types of weddings"".   Further, your argument about Ohio not belonging in the marriage game is pointless. It seems like you're coming at it from a place of cynicism, saying that all marriage is evil. It's not. If you're argument is that marriage is a religious sacrament and the government has no right to interfere, you're still wrong. Marriage is a social construct that surpasses religious meaning. Call it civil union if you want, it's the same damn thing."
toledo,3ci7wd,Spmckenz,-9,Wed Jul 8 13:16:24 2015 UTC,"So he should resign because of one mistake ? You guys are crazy,  people are people.  Moaning the government is dysfunctional in Toledo,  no way!"
toledo,3ci7wd,wkdravenna,9,Wed Jul 8 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't call for his resignation, but I certainly don't think it's out of line. This wasn't a snap judgement that he was put into at a moments notice. He consciously made the decision to deny people human rights based on sexual orientation. He has no business upholding the law if he cannot put aside his personal beliefs in favor of the law."
toledo,3ci7wd,Spmckenz,4,Wed Jul 8 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he should resign over one mistake.  I'm stating if performing same sex marriages (plural) while he is an elected official is an issue then he needs to think about tendering his resignation. I'm not going to see him to discuss his morals I'm there for him to perform a service and if he doesn't want to do his job, then he needs to quit.  I hold the same opinion with doctors that don't prescribe birth control or pharmacists that refuse to fill the prescription for birth control.  I don't give a flying fuck about your opinion.  You have a job, do it."

Furthermore, my political affiliation has nothing to do with this.  2 people have the right to marry as per the constitution now.  His religious beliefs have no place in his job, his job is to uphold the constitution which now includes marrying same sex couples.  Ive got news for you, whatever advisory he filed with the state Supreme Court about not wanting to perform these ceremonies won't be upheld, they will basically say get over it.  This isn't rocket science."

Academia does a poor job with anything that isn't dev IMHO.  The technologies side of things do a slightly better job, but many CS grads think that dev is the only way to go.  Incoming CS students are even more lost.  I teach at UT part time on occasion, and in a 1000 level java class, 2/3 of the class said they wanted to develop games at the beginning of the semester.  I think expectations need to be set - most developers aren't going to do games - they're going to do a piece of some backend server that an enterprise uses."

Moved here and found a job within 2 days. Cold called first day and had an interview, was hired the second day.  There just isn't any good CS programs in the state outside OSU.  No offense but I looked into UT's program because I wanted to finish my degree and it was just sad.  BGSU was ok but maybe 2 steps above IT Tech.  OSU is pretty nice, but I don't see a lot of people leaving Columbus for Toledo and more apt to head to NY, California, or Arizona.   Which leaves a nice hole for guys like me.

If you don't pay though you might get a Bench-Warrant and or Warrant block on your registration.   I'd call and ask to speak to a clerk though.
toledo,3c93le,wkdravenna,2,Mon Jul 6 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"Taking a day off work to appear would cost more than the ticket. TMC doesn't have any information on the ticket yet probably because of the holiday backlog so I can't pay it online even.  Well, it seems the $10 late fine and $15 bench warrant fee for not paying on time is actually my cheapest option."
toledo,3c93le,wkdravenna,2,Mon Jul 6 01:57:14 2015 UTC,They don't have information on a ticket you have to pay today ?   https://www.tmc-clerk.com/caseinformation/criminaltraffic/  You typed it in there ?

toledo,3c93le,Beiki,3,Tue Jul 7 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"You should be able to call down and request the court date be changed. I don't know if they will this close to it, but it is worth a try. Next best option would be to see if you can get your work hours switched around so you can go down there Tuesday and request the judge to make an extension on the time. Let them know of your circumstances and that you are willing to pay, you just need a little time to do so. Depending on the circumstances, the judge may even just throw out the ticket to avoid any hassle."
toledo,3c93le,Beiki,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:52:28 2015 UTC,"Called Monday and the clerk said there wasn't a record of me, only my prior ticket from 12 years ago. Today it wasn't online either but was listed under today's court docket so I was able to pay by selecting that."

toledo,3bs24n,BlacK--BearD,3,Thu Jul 2 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I could have sworn all of these (minus mobile devices since cell phones were still pretty new) were all in effect when I got my license. And I thought they stayed in effect during all of your probationary license. Which I think was until 18. I could be misremembering, of course."
toledo,3bs24n,SigPro49,3,Thu Jul 2 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"The restrictions:   No driving between midnight and 6 a.m., unless that driver is accompanied by a parent or a guardian. Those with valid documentation from work, school or church allowing for travel for activities between these hours are exempt; No driving with more than one non-family member in the car; All passengers must wear safety belts at all times; and No use of mobile communication while driving.   About the only one I think doesn't have as much to do with safety as control is the first one. The roads are pretty clear between midnight and 6 AM. I remember using those hours to get my confidence up on night driving before driving when it was dark AND busy (8PM-10PM).  If the concern was with having a less-experienced driver on the road, I would think morning and evening rush hour would be the time to restrict driving but that would be a MASSIVE disruption to anyone's life not being able to drive during those hours.  Ultimately, they all seem like reasonable restrictions and if you want your son/daughter/charge to get experience with night driving you can always go out with them during those hours."

As far as the claims go, they pay less than you actually need like most companies, but we get things done.  They also put ""incidents"" on your record just because you called to ask what a situation might cost to fix, not if you actually make a claim."

toledo,3b4xfc,CoreyX64,5,Fri Jun 26 00:21:32 2015 UTC,I'll post what I made in another thread about how I went and got my own modem. Originally they told me I could go to the closest office but you can only go to the Southwyck one.  My current modem I have been using since January.  The modem has to be DOCSIS 3.0 capable. You take it to the buckeye office at 5566 Southwyck Blvd and they test it there to see if it will work on the network.   (Why they don't just have a list of one's that will work and skip this if you have one is beyond me.)  Then you take it home and call them before you unplug your current modem and call again once the one you bought is in. Then just return the company modem to the office.
toledo,3b4xfc,brickx2,3,Fri Jun 26 01:21:04 2015 UTC,"They actually do have a list on their website now. Back in January this wasn't the case, and neither were the rental fees in place either. I read the replies to your thread and one or two people claimed to have been able to sign on modems manufactured by Netgear. These were AIO boxes (router/modem all in ones), which tells me they are either gateway customers (which require data-only boxes, no EMTAs) or don't have any landline phone service. Either way, it's an unapproved modem, and they let it on, so that's why I feel I'm being fed a line of BS. If it's a matter of driving to the old mall location and having them test it, so be it. As long as I dont get stonewalled because it's ""unapproved."" Comcast by comparison is absolutely horrible about this and when they say you can only use these XYZ modems, they mean business. The thing is, I tried this last Thursday and it worked great, sans phone service. This Thursday, not the case. So either the rep I got didn't even try to provision it, or they did blacklist these on their CMTS. I bought a 1602 solely for future proofing (16x4), but if it doesn't work, oh well. I can get every modem buckeye offers (with the exception of the 16x4s for the 300M service which I will never get) for $30 or less.  When I first activated mine, I called and they said to take it into the office. The website actually mentioned nothing about this, and their activation dept actually can test it over the plant. (Not really test, but they'll actually activate it directly), I sidestepped so many tiers by doing this. It worked great for awhile, but when I went to do it again he said they basically added scripts to their CMTS config that won't let unapproved modems on. Part of me believes this and they actually did shitcan them, and the other part says it's a line of BS.  I'll definitely take this to Southwyck and see what they say. My modem is more than capable of being supported, they just refuse to let it on. Oh well.  thanks for the message. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to jump the gun prior to the modem fees back in January?  Sorry for writing a book, I've had to deal with so much crap with them over the years kinda hard to contain. I've never had a problem with them service wise generally but there's too many politics surrounding it."
toledo,3b4xfc,brickx2,3,Fri Jun 26 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"I understand, we have had a somewhat ok experience with buckeye, minus the prices which is typical of cable providers.   We don't have TV so we may just not get the runaround allot of people experience. The data limits are a whole source of frustration though, especially when the pop-up appears.  For why we got our own modem, whenever I went to change any setting or remote restart on the modem they gave us, it was unbearably sluggish.   I have a router we used for WiFi instead but it still had to go through that crappy modem so I just decided to get our own and have it be the router as well since I was buying a new piece of network equipment anyway."

toledo,3b4xfc,AskADude,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:54:16 2015 UTC,It is. Some customers I've worked with have modems dating back to 2004 (older DOCSIS 2.0 models) and are getting charged rental fees. A modem that is over 10 years old has long been paid off.
toledo,3b4xfc,armymon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Buckeye isn't crashing the party, they're just 15 years late to the party. Every other provider has charged rental fees from day 1. They're so far behind. It's perfectly legal though. They didn't charge you for the equipment up front, you technically don't own it, so there's not a whole lot to argue. Not fond of the fees either, I just wish they were more flexible on the modem choice. They've been married to Arris for over a decade, if I want another brand I should have that right. Personally I like Ciscos. Good brand and the modems are a lot smaller."

toledo,3aphyv,Phil_James,4,Mon Jun 22 13:16:34 2015 UTC,why do they keep doing all these checkpoints in the holland/sylvania/springfield area?  my guess? even though they know they can catch far more drunks and warrants in other parts of the city... they know people in sylvania/springfield/holland are more likely to have the money to pay the fines.  proving once again that this shit is nothing more than a money grab... they don't give a fuck about public safety.

""vehicle inspections"" where they pull you over and give you tickets for cracked windshields and not enough tread on your tires.  they don't do that shit in the ghetto where everyone is driving run down shit heap beaters or cars with modifications that make them illegal...nope... they nitpick nice new cars looking for small little bullshit trying to nickle and dime the people with money out of it.  it's rather easy to see why... they know the people living in the shit parts of town can't afford to pay the fines. you can't pay a ticket with food stamps... so they go after the only people left with any money out in the suburbs.  either way, if it was about ""public safety"" these fucking pigs would do warrant and DUI sweeps on shitty sides of town where they would find far more people but they target areas of town with money so they can ""raise revenue"".  they don't care about ""safety"" all they care about is stealing money from people who work hard for it."

It seems like the technology still has a way to go before it would be viable, especially in more rural/spread out areas. I think wireless is definitely where things are headed though. It's amazing the speeds we can get with consumer grade wifi equipment these days (802.11ac is now more common- gets up to 1.2gbps). However, there is probably just as much bureaucracy (or more) involved in getting a usable wifi spectrum that scales enough to disrupt the current alternatives, let alone the technology for it... All the cell phone companies own those frequencies right now. You'd have the cell phone companies and cable companies lobbying against anyone ""brave"" enough to go against them.  Look at some of the new 5G stuff. We'll probably be charged by the kilobyte if cell phone companies have their way. Someone has to fund all the lobbying."

You take it to the buckeye office at 5566 Southwyck Blvd and they test it there to see if it will work on the network.   (Why they don't just have a list of one's that will work and skip this if you have one is beyond me.)  Then you take it home and call them before you unplug your current modem and call again once the one you bought is in. Then just return the company modem to the office.

toledo,3ad2y0,jmslagle,0,Sun Jun 21 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"this years weather is a lot different than the weather we got last year.  last year we had a long period of no rain, allowing all the algae food (lawn fertilizer, agricultural runoff, etc...) to accumulate. then we had a crazy deluge over the course of about a day and half washing all that into the lake.  not only did the rain storm break loose all that banked up algae food, but it overwhelmed the combined storm and sewer systems all over the region (toledo, detroit, ect...) and flushed a (pun intended) shitload of piss and shit into the lakes.  this was followed by a long period of hot sunny days...  this year however is starting out a lot different, we've had a long period of light rain, which in theory pushed all the same runoff into the lake... but it's more diluted.  also because we've had overcast and stormy skys while this diluted algae food has been dumped into the lake, the algae hasn't had as much of a chance to bloom.  ...that said... we'll still get an algae bloom, hopefully it won't be as bad as last years... it doesn't seem like it will but who knows.  another thing that made the algae bloom last year so bad... is after we cooked up that nasty algae soup... we had a storm come in from the north and blow the bloom right into the intake.  last year was about as close to a ""perfect storm"" as it gets for algae blooms... it would be hard to imagine that happening again anytime soon.  bottom line is you should always have a week of water in rotation. bottled water is better for you to drink than tap water anyway so it's a good habit to get into.  in the summer... keep a little extra just in case we get another problem popping up."

toledo,3a2huu,seannymurrs,0,Thu Jun 18 00:53:10 2015 UTC,What evidence do you have to support this claim? Perrysburg has always ranked higher than pretty much all other districts in the area.
toledo,3a2huu,billcom6,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a teacher in Toledo who has applied to a lot of other districts in recent years and I review the data for every district via the state school report cards.  If you compare the report cards for Perrysburg with other districts in the area (Sylvania, Ottawa Hills, Anthony Wayne, etc.) you will notice there really isn't a great deal of difference. Also as a teacher I realize that parent involvement probably plays the biggest role in student success, so as long as the parents are invested in the student's education they would probably thrive no matter what district they are in. A final thing I would be concerned about with Perrysburg schools is overcrowding.  Their buildings are pretty much bursting at the seems because so many people think like OP and are trying to get their kids in there."
toledo,3a2huu,seannymurrs,2,Thu Jun 18 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"Perrysburg is in the process of building a new 5/6 building to accommodate the growing population. Also, according to the most recent state report cards Perrysburg was rated higher than all districts in the area except for Ottawa Hills. I also am a teacher in the area and have taught or substitute taught in multiple districts in NW Ohio throughout my career. For various reasons I would recommend Perrysburg above all others, both as a place to work and also as a place to send my kids."

They replaced all the windows and sliders when I was still living there, so its decently efficient.  They have 3bd units also, that creeps up into the 750-770 range if not mistaken.  If you have any questions about the place, feel free to ask.  The management was, eh, so so.  The maintenance team was reasonable, if not horribly overworked.

We host 3 motocross races a year and an Indians Motorcycle Club weekend event. At the Indians event you'll see many old motorcycles. And at the motocross races you'll see modern and vintage off road bikes. But at all our events you'll see people having fun and enjoying each other's company. Our motocross races are always the last Sunday of the month in September, October and November. The Indians' event is father's day weekend. Come on out and ask for Teamrayray!  Pm me if you have any specific questions."

They have a variety of jumbo machines as well if you're into that sort of thing. No wifi there though.  Oregon Coin Laundry in the Freeway Plaza on Navarre is the same price, with wifi, but not 24 hours.  I recommend these places because machines usually work and the staff are helpful. Places to avoid can usually be determined visually if you have experience and some tolerance (even good laundromats aren't pretty in the city)."

It helps that I went from my wife and I paying Verizon 150 a month to roughly 45 a month with no change in usage.  Check them out as another option at www.ting.com  If you decide to go with Ting let me know and I can give you my referral code which will get you $100 towards a phone or in Ting credit.

It is far from the top provider thats for sure, like someone else said, AT&T and Verizon have a lot of the lower bandwidths, i go into any mall or decently sized building and i drop from 4g to 3g, but driving around through most of toledo/sylvania/holland i get great 4g signal, i stream music and will use my GPS at the same time with no troubles."
toledo,38j1xm,zunnol,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Even with AT&T going into any decent sized building can cause it to drop to unusable too. But most places that don't get good reception often have wifi, so I'm really less worried about that. I guess it's the evil I know vs. the evil I don't. There's a Sprint tower right down the street from my house so I'm not worried about lacking signal in my half basement either, but I also have wifi to alleviate that if it were an issue. I'm perfectly fine with switching, just trying to get my wife on board. She's been with AT&T for almost 15 years and feels loyal, but our phones have been shit since lollipop came out (the G2 has no business running lollipop) and they can't fix it. We both owe like $50 on our next plans and they won't even discount some cases to help us switch sooner. It's horseshit, really."
toledo,38j1xm,rniscior,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"I will say i am kind of in the same boat as your wife, ive had Sprint for around 10 years so i guess i feel somewhat loyal to them, they almost lost me in the last couple years but it seems like they have been stepping up their game a little bit on Toledo so i was pretty confident with sticking with them.  Even when their service sucked i still got decent customer service out of them. Was getting no connection in my house so they offered me a free booster, no charge for it and no monthly charge, to increase the signal, which worked great."
toledo,38j1xm,Hoberto,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"That's pretty awesome. AT&T had been great, but something changed lately. I stopped in the store earlier, told them if they couldn't help us out at all we were leaving for Sprint, they said corporate isn't even letting them discount accessories anymore and they're getting really strict on all price points.

Honestly, if you're inside the signal won't be as good because ATT and Verizon own all the lower bandwidth which penetrate walls better but I've never had an issue unless you're in a tornado shelter or basement. I still get LTE inside at work and at home. It's the bricked in bathroom in the center of the building and my basement that cut me down to 3g or 2g.

toledo,37iq4i,_brickhaus_,3,Wed May 27 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"I live there and really can't complain. I think people are playing up the cons a little.  I haven't seen a bum in the lobby in months, there is a security guard who sits in the lobby until 6AM.  The parking lot is small but if you really want you can pay for a parking garage space or park on the street since it's free on the weekends and after 5 on the weekdays. I can find a space 90% of the time, though.  I don't have any problems with my neighbors being loud in the hallways and can't hear them through the walls.  We just got new management a few months back and they are very quick to fix problems. They are actually renovating the lower parking garage right now.  Pros: rooftop patio, walking distance to uptown, warehouse district, Huntington center, fifth third field, not everything closes at 5.  Like I said, I really enjoy living here."
toledo,37iq4i,melkaynun,3,Mon Jun 1 13:04:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're still following this thread, but...  I was debating between LaSalle and CP as well and I just preferred the more spacious, high-ceiling units of LaSalle. I've known someone in the CP building and she was happy living there as well. Standart lofts are the newest and have the nicest interior but just bit too expensive and I don't remember if they had a gym.  There are two working elevators now and I haven't had any issues with them personally. I've been told that there are 4 functional elevators, but two of them are turned off to save energy.  I can't comment on the parking lot since I'm paying 45/mo for a garage spot.  As far as low income people, both CP and LaSalle take a particular group of low income residents. I'm not sure what it was called, but it's not section 8 and the rent subsidization is not as much as section 8 residents. You can find this information in some website. I believe both buildings need to have a certain percentage of low income residents as their renovations were funded by the government. Again, haven't run into any issues myself and it's been very quiet here but maybe it's different in lower floors.  Overall, I really like my unit. It's huge and open.  What I don't like is that there is no trash chute on each floor, so you have to go downstairs to throw your trash. Maybe that is because this is an old renovated building and I'm not sure if this is also the case at CP."
toledo,37iq4i,Sei28,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still here. Thanks for posting. Right now we like CP the best because of the parking, general building conditions, windows that we can black out (I work afternoons), and the price is the cheapest. They don't have any openings right now though. We are looking at Sunshine Lofts tomorrow, I think."
toledo,37iq4i,LurkMoarMcCluer,7,Wed Jun 3 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"Pros: The units themselves are nice for the reasons you've mentioned and good location to Mudhens,ñWalleye, etc.   Cons: Terrible parking lot, bums in the lobby, arguing in the hallways, everything nearby closes at 5 or 6 because it's a ghosttown when there's not a game.  Overall, an alright place if you're looking to be downtown."
toledo,37iq4i,LurkMoarMcCluer,1 point,Thu May 28 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"The free parking lot is pretty awful and it's so small that I'm sure it would be full by the time I get off work at 9pm. It looks like we will have to pay for the garage inside or they said there's a garage across the street for $45/month.  As far as bums in the lobby, I assumed they would lock the lobby after the office girls leave at 5, but they don't? That seems pretty sketchy and dangerous. I will have to ask them about that. Thanks!"

Maintenance is super quick, and they throw parties for us like on opening day and cinco de mayo. Our parking garage is only $25 and it's super safe. I think I've seen one homeless dude outside, but we have a night guard. Sorry I don't know more about LaSalle but if it's anything like CP you'll love it. Also living downtown is amazing."
toledo,37iq4i,3pmusic,6,Thu May 28 01:55:14 2015 UTC,"I too live in the CP but have had many friends that lived in the Lasalle previously and currently.   The CP is fantastic. I have lived there for about 4 1/2 years now. Great staff. Spacious units. Best bang for your buck downtown. New washer/dryers on every floor, awesome gym, parking garage (or lot), Veritas in the lobby. Downside = No rooftop patio, no pool. Quiet inside the units (aside from Fireworks and the occasional celebration in the street after a victory).   Based on friends currently living in Lasalle: Huge open concept units, large floorpalns, great for entertaining.  Rooftop patio is awesome.  None of them have really had any issues in terms of bums or safety concerns.   Downside = Pretty thin walls so you can hear a lot of things in the other unit.  Laundry facilities are mediocre. Parking situation is a bit of an issue.  Both are the same management company (Monarch) and they do a really good job for the most part with timely repairs when needed and are always approachable and nice.  Either way welcome to downtown!!  Also, lots of stuff to do after 5 in terms of going out during the week/weekends....sunday not so much.  And that is only going to get better once the construction on promedica starts and the other numerous projects get underway."
toledo,37iq4i,Natty_Ice,2,Thu May 28 13:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was bummed about the pool but I fell in love with the building the first time I saw it so it was an easy compromise!

toledo,37iq4i,buttrapebearclaw,1 point,Thu May 28 11:41:33 2015 UTC,I will do that for sure.
toledo,37iq4i,BrownAndOrange,4,Thu May 28 14:21:00 2015 UTC,"It might be full but I have lived at the Standart Lofts for a few years now and it is great. Free gated parking, washer/dryer in every unit. Rooftop lounge area with a large community grill. Everything is updated (new appliances, bathrooms, etc.).    I have taken tours of all other apartments downtown and IMO the Standart is the best but I am sure CP and LaSalle are great too. The only bad thing I heard about LaSalle besides some of the comments below is that they still allow section 8 housing in their building which you can imagine can sometimes bring in a sketchy crowd. When I visited CP, the downsides are that there are a washer and dryer on every floor, but it is located in a very small room in one of the hallways and costs money to use. Also, the parking garage is safe, but they use it for sporting events. Therefore if you need to leave home as a game is ending, it will take a while to get out. Or if you get home late and a game is going on, you will probably be parking at the top. I have friends who live in both CP and LaSalle and they love it. Downtown is the place to be right now so as long as the cons don't outweigh the pros for you, any place will be a great place to live."
toledo,37iq4i,Low4,1 point,Thu May 28 14:48:20 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention that because we were just there this morning. We LOVED them. The owner actually took time to hire a designer and paint the walls something other than white. They only have one 2 bedroom available on the first floor right now and it is awfully expensive. That is the main issue with Standart, the price, but we loved it so much we're thinking about it."
toledo,37iq4i,BrownAndOrange,1 point,Thu May 28 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"I agree it is a little pricey right now. I think that is due to their high demand. Although, if you factor in the cost to do laundry, and to park your cars every month at the other places, it probably isn't too much different. Good luck on your search!"
toledo,37iq4i,Phil_James,1 point,Thu May 28 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It looks like there are more units becoming available on June 1, but they are all one bedroom. The more I think about Standart, the more I love it. You are correct about parking; LaSalle charges $45-60/month to park in their super ghetto garage and Hillcrest charges $40."
toledo,37guwc,valkyriemissile,21,Wed May 27 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"Hey! I actually own a little craft beer bar on Airport Hwy called The Local and we focus on tapping kegs of harder to get stuff (We had zombie dust last week, and we're tapping grapefruit sculpin tonight!!). I'll be in on Saturday and have a few bottles of rare stuff I can throw your way if you're around, and we'll have live music. We will have Founders Rubeaus on all weekend and have been mixing it with a pineapple beer which is a favorite of mine. And if you're looking for great regional beers I think the best brewery to look out for is Jackie O's, which We carry their entire available lineup for $2 a can. But if you're not in that part of town there are a number of cool bars and bottle shops to check out.  For bars with unique taplists:  -Swig in Perrysburg, killer food always has oberon and at usually at least one founders handle on.   -The Attic on Adams downtown, awesome draft selection, and Amelia is a giant sweet heart.  -The Village Idiot in Maumee, love the total hippy vibe they're big on IPAs and music is always great.  -Barr's Public House, little bit of a more upscale feel to it but has been focusing a lot more on craft, food rocks too.  -Maumee Bay Brewing, Glass city pale ale ALL DAY!  -Black Cloister is our latest addition to the beer scene and Tom and the rest of the guy are class acts.  -Doc Watson's on Byrne and Glendale, Hot and Cold dip an awesome draft selection. Occasionally you'll spot a Three Floyds handle.  Bottle Shops:  -Any Andersons location is usually the best bet  -Marinos is awesome especially if you don't mind digging around  -Holloway Beverage recently upped their craft selection and do growlers fills. And they just posted that they have bottles of Three Floyds Yum Yum  -Churchills in Pburg has some rare bottles from jackie o's at the moment.   -My favorite secret spot that stashes a small run of cool stuff is Monnette's Market on glendale, but shhh it's a secret.  But if you have any more specific questions message The Local's facebook , or check out the Toledo Beer Aficionados page where people post specific bottle deals. CHEERS!"

As far as breweries in Toledo goes, Maumee Bay Brewing Co and Black Cloister Brewing Company are both downtown, and worth stopping at.  Maumee Bay also has excellent food, while Black Cloister is strictly a taproom (although they have menus for several local restaurants that are happy to deliver)."
toledo,37guwc,Dave_Laffs,2,Wed May 27 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"Most of what people have said here is good. My personal preference is Marino's Beverage Center on Monroe right off of 475. Big selection, and they have a sizeable walk in cooler if you're looking for something cold. I have gotten some skunky beer there before, you can usually tell based on the dust on the bottles :P Stuff in the cooler is usually pretty new. For growler filling, I would check out Holloway on Airport. Less selection, but love getting my growlers filled there.   Edit: People have mentioned Anderson's on Talmadge, but Anderson's Fresh Market up on.. Sylvania(?) Has a good selection as well. Also, for restaurants/bars you can go to Granite City brewpub down in Maumee. The Local is a pretty decent bar with a good selection. I like Doc Watson's as well."

toledo,37ctjc,TMIBH,3,Thu May 28 23:10:00 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just curious...  I drive past every now and again and it always intrigues me.  There's hoist or chain fall (or whatever) coming from the attic.  The lower windows are obscured by boards and there is scaffolding in the front.  It's been like this for years if not decades.

If you can get somewhere close to State Route 250 and you'll have a nice entrance to the turnpike - that's the fastest route to both Toledo and Cleveland.   Warning is that this takes you to SR 80/90 so you'll have tolls. If you opt for this, get an EZPass and you'll save a shit ton of money - literally half the cost if you were to pay in cash. It costs $.75/ month, but you pair with your debit card and it refills when your account gets low."

toledo,371r4y,stevewhitmer,1 point,Sun May 24 01:44:20 2015 UTC,She's working in the far west suburbs of Cleveland so it would be somewhat closer to Toledo than the actual city of Cleveland. The distance between her work and the campus is an hour and a half so we were hoping to try to find some sort of middle ground.  That's why I was looking into the Port Clinton area. It mapped out to ~45-50 min for both of us.

I believe you do get taxed extra though if you live in Toledo but work outside of Toledo (0.5% tax) but I could be wrong.  Additional reasoning to stick with Maumee at least for the next year would be the current construction situation everywhere. Commuting between the suburbs and city is pretty miserable for a lot of folks right now.  I pretty much always push Toledo over the suburbs, so this feels really weird."

toledo,36kh4n,laerie,9,Wed May 20 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"Toledoan here, who attended TPS (Toledo Public Schools), did a brief stint (3 days) of substitute teaching there, and went to college at BGSU.  I'll be honest. The TPS school district is rough. Much of the city is facing economic challenges, and the students you see in these schools are representative of that. Poor home life/support --> poor performance. The public schools are, I believe, union based, so teachers with the most experience move their way up into the areas of town that are somewhat more affluent and better performing, leaving the worst schools the newer employees. But anyway, here is a list of some available elementary jobs in the TPS system. I do have a few acquaintances who teach for TPS, and they seem to find it both rewarding and challenging (which I believe describes working with kids in any capacity).  Toledo is also home to a lot of charter schools, which the district provides vouchers for. You would have to do a Google search for the names; there's quite a few.  Bowling Green has its own school district, by the way. They seem to enjoy a pretty decent reputation. Here's their list of available elementary positions.  Really, I think most of the public school systems of the Toledo suburbs have decent reputations; some of them excellent. To name a few off the top of my head: Washington Local Schools, Springfield School District, Oregon City Schools, Maumee City Schools, Anthony Wayne local schools, Ottawa Hills, Sylvania. These are all in Lucas County.  Wood County (of which Bowling Green is the capital) has Eastwood, Elmwood, Lake, North Baltimore, Northwood, Otsego, Perrysburg, and Rossford.  All of these school districts seem to have their own webpages, and links to jobs.   My understanding is that certification/licensure is a must to get any of these jobs. Many of them also have extensive background/drug testing as well.   Based on my experience, if you have a Bachelor's degree, TPS is always looking for substitute teachers, and some of these positions can lead to long-term placement. (Obviously, benefits are lacking when substituting as these positions are per diem, but if you manage to score a long-term position, this can lead to benefits). I did substituting for high school, and was offered a long term position on my second day! (I quickly came to the conclusion that teaching high school at the age of 21 was not for me, and turned it down).  I've always been fond of BG (and BGSU) and I think that it's a wonderful town to live in, if you can a) afford it! and b) can stand living in a college town (lots of parties/rentals). Also, there's currently a ton of expressway construction around here and for the next few years, the commute from Toledo to BG doesn't look pretty.  Toledo is a lot more affordable, and has many more attractions to offer. Many other posts in this sub have addressed the best places to live and areas to avoid, you'll do well to browse through them, as nothing much has changed!  Anyway, I'll wrap up this huge lecture with a congrats to your husband on his new job, a good luck wish on your job hunt, and say, ""Welcome to Toledo""!  Edit: Forgot to mention Toledo Parochial schools, run by the Toledo Diocese. Not as big as they once were, but still a valid employer!"
toledo,36kh4n,helenkellerkitty,0,Wed May 20 03:32:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! Is BG really rural? I am NOT a country girl.   I figure with a move I'd have to sub first to make a name for myself, but was hoping I'd be able to get a full-time job given my experience and the fact that I am SO READY for a real job. Not really banking on that, but a girl can still dream."
toledo,36kh4n,delphine1041,1 point,Wed May 20 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"BG is a college town, so there's plenty of bars and restaurants and a small mall; they also have art festivals and sporting events and so on to fill the place up fairly often.  But it's surrounded by quite a bit of rural territory, and sometimes the edges leak."
toledo,36kh4n,jonwroblew,1 point,Sat May 30 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'm Toledo native and a student at the University of Toledo studying education. As such I've been trying to understand the school system in the city.   This is going to be an oversimplification and I'm on mobile and can't effectively link anything, sorry.   One major thing to understand is that the city of Toledo, and the entire state, has the Ed-Choice scholarship plan. This system allows residents in failing school districts, that cannot reasonably afford to send their child to a private school, to send their child to another school of their choice with the tuition costs paid by the state.   The issue then becomes that schools are rated in the city based on performance and the best rated schools receive the most funding. As you would expect the schools with less funding start to do worse and are eventually achieve the status of ""academic emergency"" after receiving low evaluations for, if I recall correctly, three years. Residents in the districts of schools that are in a state of academic emergency then become eligible for the Ed-Choice scholarship. This causes many students to leave that school sending their children to different private schools, as well as non-district public schools, as a result of the scholarship.   Schools that end up in this state dramatically shrink only condemning them to fewer resources and fewer parents to support the school. This cycle has completely crashed a few of the schools in Toledo already. With district schools closing and being torn down and students in those districts being sent elsewhere it is a bit concerning for a few reasons. This system has not been improving the status of the public school system and the students who transfer from the failing schools do not have the skills that they are supposed to have for their grade level forcing many schools to cope with the educational disparity.   Simply put, the city need some serious educational reform because its current model is not sustainable. While the Ed-Choice plan might be helping the students in the short term by getting them to schools that will hopefully improve their individual academic standings. However this set up is slowly eating away at the school infrastructure of the city by causing schools to fail faster and not attempting to solve the root of the problem.  Why do I bring this up? Any teacher in the city is in some way affected by this program. Whether you work in a school that is failing and losing students or a shook that is absorbing the students from other areas you are going to have to deal with unique challenges. At a school that is going downhill you will be forced to work with very few resources. At a school that is doing well you are going to have students at very different academic levels in the classroom.   This is a very basic overview of one of the issues affecting the school system, but I would recommend that you look into it if you are able.  The other posts have given you lists of the schools so I will not be redundant and also post them. Also, as you mentioned, troll through old posts from others asking about living in the area, you will find plenty.  As for finding a job it should not be too difficult considering you have experience, the city needs teachers.   As a university student who isn't even drinking age I'm probably not in your peer group, and therefore probably not a good friend candidate. I would, however; be interested in hearing about your experiences teaching somewhere that is not Toledo."
toledo,36kh4n,culby,-1,Wed May 20 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"UGH that sounds terrible. Syracuse schools are in a lot of trouble right now too, but I've been working in rural and suburban schools the past two years, so I haven't really kept up with it all that much. Thanks for the info. I don't have any experience in a city school, but if there's a supportive community I know I'd be able to make it work.   PM me if you wanna chat about my experiences in education in Central NY!"
toledo,36kh4n,NateCelery,1 point,Wed May 20 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"I will probably be the first (and only) commenter to say that TPS is starting to turn it around. Their new superintendent is probably one of the more dedicated people I've ever seen in education. There seems to be a different buzz around the system. Now the quality of education still varies from building to building, but it's not a complete loss like it has been.  (For the record, my kid is going to Springfield Schools this year, and is starting Toledo School for the Arts next year.)"

toledo,36kh4n,iREDDITandITsucks,0,Wed May 20 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Sylvania, perrysburg, maumee and Waterville are your surrounding area school districts and are highly preferred to send your TPS district and have three friends teaching in the system and it can really depend on the school and grade you're teaching. Some of the rougher area schools aren't bad if you get the young kids that haven't been pulled into the community bullshit. I think the best you can go for is the new Beverly school (k-8 if I remember). Last I knew they allowed no kids outside of the district (which is one of the better areas of Toledo) to attend.  You have a fair amount of schools available to you. Good luck."
toledo,36hl07,Rylon2008,15,Tue May 19 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"They did this whole chart on results of how many people said they agreed with the statement ""I always feel safe and secure."" which I feel is pretty misleading. If asked that I'd probably respond no, even though in reality I feel safe and secure 99% of the time here, including all the time I spend around home and the surrounding neighborhoods. Sure there are some areas I wouldn't walk through without at least a knife in my pocket just in case, but I haven't had to visit any of those areas in at least 5 years and I see no reason I'll ever have to again."

I had problems with people trying to intimidate me, a male neighbor (I'm female) threatening to beat me up, my brand new car was keyed a few times,.. just all kinds of bullshit. I lived by myself for a few months and put wood in all the windows, kept every deadbolt locked, didn't go outside unless I had to, never rode my bike around the neighborhood. It sucked. A couple houses were burned on my street while I lived there, a car was burned like two blocks over, and I heard gun shots a few times."
toledo,36hl07,crunchy_wumpkins,4,Mon May 25 15:28:19 2015 UTC,I think there's a lot of paranoia and misconceptions in Toledo too. I moved downtown and had several people ask how safe I felt and if I thought I would get mugged or raped or murdered down here. Like really? It's full of 20/30 year olds walking around all the time. People don't explore parts of the city they're unfamiliar with and just assume it's unsafe.
toledo,36hl07,Natty_Ice,2,Tue May 19 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"^ Nailed it. Toledo has changed quite a bit in the last decade-ish for the better, but it hasn't changed perceptions. Folks poo-poo that we point to downtown as a sign of better times, but that's the lifeblood of many, if not most, ""respectable"" cities."
toledo,36hl07,danceswsheep,1 point,Fri May 22 13:54:56 2015 UTC,I have pepper spray because I work at the mall and security won't walk us out. That being said you missed my point. Being aware and being scared are two different things. This survey was about people not feeling safe. People are afraid of what they don't know. Of course you should be aware of your surroundings (bad things can happen anywhere) but you don't have to run through the streets with your gun out popping around corners like a TV policeman when you walk downtown.
toledo,36hl07,Natty_Ice,3,Wed May 20 08:15:39 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised how much some people over-react to knowing a crime happened near them. My neighborhood has a block watch page where neighbors can discuss and report whats going on in the neighborhood. There are some people that anytime they see a 911 call (thanks eye citizen) they flip out and state how they can't believe how terrible our neighborhood has become. There is maybe 1 police report filed every couple months for crime that actually occurs in our neighborhood, the rest are just unverified 911 calls.  There are some places I wouldn't go at night in Toledo, but that is true most places. I also have no real reason to be in those areas either. I would walk up and down the streets of my neighborhood any time of day and feel perfectly safe."

Doc Watsons and Mickey Finns are interesting, as is the pool hall Miss Cue, where you can play pool, darts, or even ping-pong. Fancy micro-breweries? There's Black Cloister or Maumee Bay Brewing company.   Obviously the Mudhens and surrounding bars are a good stop, if sports are your thing. And there's the Maumee Sports Mall for batting cages, driving range, mini-golf.   Nature freaks? Try our world class zoo, or Wildwood park (which is one of the better). Walk along the Maumee river, go fishing!  If your friends are coming in summer, head on out to Maumee Bay State Park. Rent a ski-doo or go parasailing, whatever it is you kids do for fun on the water these days.  Like thrift stores/antiques? There's a nice antique mall in Maumee. While you're there, stop by Goodwill or Savers.  Video games? Try Nickel World! A tiny cover charge, and then it's free to play the arcade games. Plus little nickel skill games that you can get tickets for, and win lame prizes! I think that there's some bar out in Holland that used to have a video game night (Smash brothers, maybe?)

It's a mess because Safeguard can't find the contractors to keep up with demand, and the ones that do work don't want to and won't go to rough neighborhoods, for all of the reasons you said.

The big reason there is a lot of vitriol towards the heads of the auto companies and some of the other 'old money' tycoons is because they used their money and influence to get it made illegal to own the trolley systems and the power companies. They then bought up the systems for pennies on the dollar with the sole intention of dismantling them to force people to buy their product.

What you need to realize though is that there is a great divide in neighborhood quality not too far away. From the river starting at walbridge park to the zoo, over to the VA clinic and MCUT and working north to swan creek metro park. East of that divide not so nice, west quite nice. Or if you are not familiar with Toledo east of Glendale bad (minus the Harvard area), west good.  Hope it helps and if you have any other questions feel free to ask."

You tell them you need a car, they send one to you. You pay through the app and it includes tip and all that jazz right to your CC.   Awesome if you're drunk and on the town - tap, get the ride, get out, get in the house. Don't have to worry about paying cash or waiting for a dispatcher lying to you. You can track the car as it comes to you and everything."

What kind of drug convictions do they have ?   In the City of Toledo, to drive any vehicle for hire by the public to have checks done, these people are anarchist and aren't following this law.

The person getting the ride almost missed a flight because of this, and also was unable to contact uber for sometime as they make this very difficult. In another case, an uber driver took an intoxicated chicago woman back to his appartment instead of to her home where he raped her.  Uber is a shadowy company who's drivers run over children, are rapist and crash into police cars and that operate outside ohio law.

That being the case I don't think you can paint this as an issue specific to either of these companies. Same with stoner cabbies. A rider of any cab should exercise due dilligence.
