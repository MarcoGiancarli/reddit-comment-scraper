ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,sealcouch,57,Sat Jul 18 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"great score! I love when people post finds like this!  if you are planning on keeping it, might I suggest you change the mat to an acid free one? you can tell by looking at the colour of the bevel that the mat that is on it that it's just a paper mat-full of acid and badness that ruins nice art work.  source: I've been a framer for 25+ years"

ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,pamazon63,3,Sun Jul 19 00:14:52 2015 UTC,Op should do this whether or not he's going to keep it so the art stays fresh either way.
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,senses3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, but if he's just going to flip it the person that buys it will want to re-frame it to suit their taste. so spending good money to change the mat might not be necessary. unless he thinks it will bring more $$ when he sells it."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,pamazon63,19,Sun Jul 19 21:52:07 2015 UTC,That's a really pretty print.

ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,blakemake,18,Sat Jul 18 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, you got lucky!! I have 3 signed Harper prints, and I'd freaking faint if I came across this. People really will drop off anything at a Goodwill, won't they?"
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,waywithwords,22,Sat Jul 18 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"You get overwhelmed when a relative dies and you're tasked with clearing out their stuff, especially if there's a time limit.  My father died last year and I had two weeks to sort out his entire house/estate as I live in another country. At first I was being really careful, because he was a packrat and a very intelligent man who had had some money and loved collecting. I knew there was a chance that some of his weird hoard would be valuable, but much of it was outside my expertise.  He was a computer programmer back in the 80s and I just happen to know that people love mechanical keyboards so when I found a huge box of old keyboards from the 80s, I knew to set that aside, even though they were all so filthy and disgusting most people would have thrown them in the garbage.  So many things look like trash, but are worth a few dollars to the right person that eventually you get overwhelmed and don't care anymore. You just want the hoard to go away."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,CharlieHarvey,5,Sat Jul 18 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. It's impossible to research or know the value of everything you have to get rid of. I guess my question was really a rhetorical ""wow!"" kind of statement."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,waywithwords,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Lawyer here. I can't tell you how many times people have approached me with ""What do I do with the contents of the house?"" The problem is that once a relative dies, most people are unable to objectively assess values. Sometimes this is due to grief, or sheer ignorance. In addition, just because the relative stated ""X"" was worth money, doesn't make it so.  The easiest method is to take photos of various items (etc.) before the person passes. Recently I had a colleague show me some photos of ""some old furniture"" from her father's house that she was planning on donating to Goodwill. It turned out to be a complete Heywood Wakefield dining room set from the early 1950's. Because she grew up with it, she had no idea that it was worth anything."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,Hodaka,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Luckily this has become somewhat easier thanks to the internet. There are so many sources for appraising things now. Forums, eBay, auction house catalogues, etc. Now it's more a matter of how much time one has to slog through those resources."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:05 2015 UTC,I would just move it all to a storage locker or something so I'd have more time to go through it.
ThriftStoreHauls,3dqdff,senses3,3,Sun Jul 19 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Living outside the country and only having two weeks I didn't want to try to get involved in that, because then I'd be trying to remember to pay a monthly storage fee in a country I don't live in.  There's a lot of stuff still in the house, because I just didn't have time to finish sorting it. There was so much.  It's an ongoing source of stress and irritation.  Just an idea here for any hoarders who don't hate their loved ones who might be reading this. If you feel like you might die anytime soon, please, please go ahead and make a spreadsheet or a notebook or something (anything!) outlining what parts of your insane nightmare are actually valuables disguised as trash. Just simple notes like 'The dirt-smeared canvas full of holes under the guest bed is an original Picasso' or 'The ball-up cocktail napkin covered in indecipherable scribbling you found in a sandwich bag inside my toolbox is a birthday party invite Ernest Hemingway gave me once'."

And at least twice a person has tracked me down to give me a piece of clothing they didn't want after they tried it on.  /u/scabdick's approach is a civil one.  It gives the person an out.  That person was a jerkface indeed.  I'm curious though- what's everyone's thoughts on this?  Is thrift merch fair game until purchased?"
ThriftStoreHauls,3dpgva,shatnershairpiece,4,Sat Jul 18 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say regardless of the store, taking something from someone else's cart is bullshit. If it's an accident, that's one thing. But on purpose? No. I mean, I've followed people around, waiting for them to put something down so I could snatch it, but once it's in their cart, it's theirs. You might as well be snatching it straight out of their hands."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dpgva,scabdick,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"Merchandise in a cart isn't fair game but there are obviously unscrupulous people out there.  I've learned that if you have something good in your cart put it underneath an old shirt in the bottom of your cart.  I agree with you about complimenting an item.  I had one of those tabletop ceramic Christmas trees in my cart that people collect and a woman asked what section I found it in and went to check that area.  I wound up offering it to her after I noticed a chip on it and she was glad to get it.  Also, I had a new sealed Monopoly game in my cart and a woman came and picked it up and somehow managed to rip a large portion of the shrink wrap.  She was oblivious."
ThriftStoreHauls,3dpgva,tfortrishy,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"The one thing I learned while thrifting/shopping at the flea markets, is never put anything down. I've had people try to rip things from my hands before when I was just putting my hand on the shelf with what I had in it to look at the lower shelves. And if you out something back, and walk away, then walk back for it. It's usually gone. That was awful for that person to do they're probably just trying to make a buck off of it too, whereas you'd have probably wore that watch :("

So I walked over and picked the lamp shade up.  They both looked at me in shock.  Then I looked at them in shock because I didn't know why they were looking at me in shock.  Haha.  Turns out the woman was trying to decide if she wanted it and the man was discussing what type of lamp she might need.  So, I gave her the lamp shade, told her to hang on to it and everyone was friendly about it."

A sleeved Goonies 2, Grim Grimoire for PS2, Mario & Luigi Superstars and Lord of the Rings: The 3rd Age for GBA. Also, whoever dumped so much gaming goodness dropped some ephemera. A Sega catalog/poster, and a Nintendo Power Robocop/Faxanadu thing. A couple of other bits, like some sealed VHS tapes. Oh yeah -- the JFK assasination era magazines. Rather amazing! All for less than $20."

ThriftStoreHauls,3dlfb8,killerpoke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:17 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, and I could be wrong, they've fallen out of popularity since the rise of the smartphone. I've had digital alarm clocks before, just never a 90s-style clock radio until recently. A lot of small things we don't think about, like clock radio and desk calculators, have become less common because of phone capabilities.

ThriftStoreHauls,3dnb7m,blueruby808,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:24 2015 UTC,Wow - where is this? Why would your area price pyrex for so high? I even find my area high - around $3 to $10 per piece sometimes.
ThriftStoreHauls,3dnb7m,blueruby808,3,Fri Jul 17 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"They price things like this for brands they know about. Pyrex is usually like $15 - $40 depending. Le Creuset, they had one piece priced at $150+  I have my suspicions, but the managers work the registers alot and they ask if you resell and if it worth it and such. I overheard this woman who would buy these bulk lots of jewelry, broken pieces and such and she mentioned that she makes a killing from buying those. The next time I saw one of those jewelry lots, it had almost tripled in price.  So if you do resell, there are better people to brag to about how you make tons of money than the store employees who price the stuff you are buying."

When I found this one, I needed to buy it just for the note it contained, as a conversation piece with my family.  Plus the frame was decent enough.    So first, The note by itself is bizarre.  Second, I wonder why someone would take the trouble to put it in a frame.  Third, why wouldn't you take that s*** out of the frame when you box it up for a thrift store donation???  In case it's hard to read:  Liz,  Sorry again for trying to pee in your trash can, waking you up.  It won't happen again.  I'll buy you that Mai Thai tonight plus another. -Bobby  So many unanswered questions.  Thank you thrift store!"

They were well worth the asking prices if you had the cameras for them or were looking for the particular lenses, but none of them were exceedingly special. Was hoping somewhere in there there was going to be a Zeiss or something but nada. There were duplicates by different brands with the same mounts, lot of mid range quality ones, I'm guessing some camera store donated the whole lot. I'd have bought them all for 30% off if I had time to pair them with cameras but it would have been a lot of work.  I usually visit this store between once and twice a day.

The room-mate had sold it! Aargh, I loved that guitar! Not worth much, cannot even remember the brand name.

I bout shat myself when I saw it today at the Goodwill here in town. I had the pull string edition when I was young and thought that he would have it but he does not.     How can I get the marker off his face without taking his original paint off? I could sand it right off but his red lips and true black eyebrows will go with it. Any suggestions?

Thursdays and Fridays after I pick her up at 7 we hit garagesales on the way home. This generates as much ebay sales as her entire weeks income wiping old lady asses... (Which she enjoys, they love her there and she gives them dignity and respect.) then I hit thrift stores between taking kids to school and running errands. Basically every single item we own was garbage picked, garagesale find, or thrifted.   I would say I find much higher quality furniture in the trash than at goodwill. If you think about it.. Rich people with zero fucks throw stuff away... Thrifty penny pinchers donate shit to get tax write offs..."

Test them out before you put any treasured tapes in them. I've got 2 Beta players myself, belts are bad on both of them. Tape plays for about 10 seconds then -chomp - chomp - chomp - I'm taking it apart to get the tape out."
ThriftStoreHauls,3d5k3q,ALLKAPS,3,Mon Jul 13 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"In the 90s I made decent side money replacing those belts on vhs players. The local electronics store had a rack of them, usually 4 screws removes the bottom, the broken belt falls out, and after measuring the length you didn't even need to look up the model number.   Years later when he went out of business he told me I was the only one to ever buy those belts, and you can't keep the doors open on sales like that.  Do assume before ever inserting a tape that one or more belts is bad if you really plan on using them. And it's one of the easiest repairs to do, only now we can look up model numbers online to find parts.  I really hate that that old fart went out of business, too. A real nice knowledgeable guy. It was like a good radio shack on steroids."

Years ago my wife's aunt, who works at the local church thrift store, found two 10 GALLON tubs full of Lego bricks in their donation shed.  You could LITERALLY fill a bathtub with them.

She told the person with them that she'd like to give them to her nephew (my son) and since she was in charge was like ""eh, 20 bucks I think"".  The lady with her was like ""yeah, that's a good price"".  Suddenly she said, ""nah, the kids in the nursery will probably like these better"" and gave them to nursery.  Now.

It advocated economic and social reform and has been said to be essentially anti-industrial.    Its influence was felt in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s  and continued among craft makers, designers and town planners long afterwards.

ThriftStoreHauls,3cwigl,superthrust,2,Sat Jul 11 11:07:50 2015 UTC,"I visited Chicago right before Christmas and used YELP to figure out where to go.  For lunch one day we went to Girl & The Goat (owned by Stephanie Izard, the winner of Top Chef a few years ago).  So, we went to a few thrift shops near there.  The first was The Ark at 1302 N Milwaukee.  It was crammed and in my opinion, overpriced.  $10 for a 1 1/2 quart blue cornflower Corning Ware dish with no lid.   There was a lot of broken glassware in the shelves and it was like Jenga if you wanted to look at something.  There was a ton of furniture but I was looking for smaller things but some of it was pretty quirky looking.  The only electronics I saw were tired toasters and such. The 2nd place was the Family Thrift Store - 2160 N Milwaukee. I couldn't understand the pricing.  I bought a horse wall metal sculpture marked 50 cents, a Roseville pottery bookend marked $1.99 and a covered Pfaltzgraff vegetable server in my pattern marked $3.72.  I was charged $3.25.?  People in line around me had some really nice clothes.  There was a wall with a glass counter in front of it that had more expensive stuff and someone was stationed there.  Nothing caught my eye but I'm not a gamer. The last place was the Salvation Army at 2270 N Clybourn.  A BMW and a Jaguar were in the donation lane when we drove up.  This store was large and tidy.  I bought a like new Emile Henry 6 qt stewpot/dutch oven with lid for $25 - they allegedly retail around $300 but who pays retail?  I also bought ($25) and flipped a set of Franciscan Poppy dishes (16 pieces).  Note that my purchases added up to $50.  I was charged $44.?  The shoes and clothes were great in my opinion but I live in a financially depressed small town where the ""boutique"" section of my thrift shop is Wal-Mart clothing with price tags..."

I won't hold it against you that you put them in the dishwasher. ;-) Actually, the 80s bowls with the clear bottoms like these aren't so bad about getting ruined in the dishwasher (as long as you're careful). The type of soap is a factor too; some detergents are much more harsh and abrasive. But really dishwashing is more of a concern for the painted white glass bowls, I would never do it on those."

I instantly regretted ever giving it all up.   Cut to a couple years later when I was about 13. I'm browsing the shitty electronics at Good Will when BAM! There's a box containing a Sega Genesis, a Sega CD, eight controllers and about 50 games, all for $30. The best part? Some of the games had names on them. My name. I used to write my name on them because some of the kids from school would try to take them when I invited them over to play. Holy shit, I'd found my old Sega Genesis and it was pretty cheap!   There was just one problem. I didn't have the money, my mom wouldn't buy it and the staff said they couldn't put it away until I had the money. I went back the next week and it was gone. :("

I've got a few things I wish I hadn't bought, as I get more seasoned at thrifting, I get more choosy. I've re-donated a few things when I've found better versions. For example, I used to buy up nearly every hand-made pottery I saw, especially hand-made mugs. Now I've gotten more choosy and only buy them if they're perfect.

Fast forward 2 years and kid #1 is now train/Thomas obsessed and we ended up buying a used Thomas the Tank Engine toddler  bed off of Craigslist for $150 (even that was still a good deal, they retail for like $350)  He made the transition from crib to toddler bed in a single night without any issues because he was so excited.

My goal can be to fit into this beautiful dress.   It was gone. The mannequin was wearing some ugly sundress and the red and black dress wasn't on the racks. Just my luck. I was so mad at myself.

ThriftStoreHauls,3coq4b,ConvincinglyCanadian,4,Sun Jul 12 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"This is a piece from a creative writing class I took. If it's not entirely clear, the piece is autobiographical, true, and about a dress I got from a Goodwill. The assignment was to write about something I had lost.  *  Black Corduroy: Therapeutic Age Regression  It slipped over my head and hugged my waist, patted my paunch, and just barely flirted on my hips, the way an almost-not-stretchy dress should. My breasts were secure in the jumper, invulnerable. Two front pockets -- for what, pogs? -- and my hands slid down in them. It was a dress for playing by the creek, if I could find the key to relax enough. I wore it over a white Hanes tee, opaque white tights, and three dollar Mary Janes from Canal street.  The jumper has been gone for about ten years now, after it had the misfortune to end up in one of the garbage bags that wouldn’t fit in my mom’s minivan after I got kicked out of boarding school in Connecticut. I found it at the Urbana Goodwill -- that’s in Ohio, where people of full adult height and weight were wearing corduroy jumpers. Nothing had ever fit me so well. Trust me, I tried.  To say my obsessive, day-long thrift store excavations are just one emotional mission to find that jumper again would excuse me from the vulgar and selfish shopping addiction that has so much control over me. I’m not just looking for that jumper. I’m looking for anything that could fix me for today. I wouldn’t stop, if I found it. But it’s a thing I tell myself.  I didn’t have such a problem with having lost it until a couple of years later, when I was that size again. All of the other lost objects had been found -- the Prada bag, the Mad Bomber hat. There were bags that never got recovered, though, but knowing me, their contents were worth less than garbage, just the relentless need to accumulate and have. VHS tapes, hundreds of pens, curios from garage sales. Too many shoes.  But the dress never came back.  Like any good dress, it turned me into a different person. In that dress, I walked the line between desirable and naïve. If I found the dress again now, I’d be years too old to pass off ignorance that I don’t know what Loli is, although back then I genuinely didn’t. I was honest-to-goodness innocent in that dress, and goddamn anyone who argued, citing my bra size. The dress was a way to sink into a downy, plush safe haven where It is not my fault.  I don’t have the dress anymore.  I can feel the stretch and security, just tight enough to hold me -- really hold me, all off me, all of the embarrassment of having let him touch me, and him, and him -- and inside it, I was alone, singularly myself, with no room between my plump, fertile, 15-year-old confused flesh and that black corduroy like the embrace of a protector I wouldn’t meet for years…  I look for the dress. It has to be out there."
ThriftStoreHauls,3coq4b,Audiovore,3,Mon Jul 13 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"No no no.  Don't look for that dress.  Look for the dress that fits you now.  It's probably much more colorful and flowing and maybe even comfortable!  If you need a challenge, keep it under $10."

ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,Batteries4Breakfast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"More or less, yeah. In the Trackball Explorer's original state, the ball sits on steel ball bearings. After about 5 years of daily use, I had worn the faces of the bearings flat and the ball wouldn't move very well. I replaced the bearings and again after a few years they wore flat. Then I read about using zirconia ceramic ball bearings so I replaced the steel ones with those and they've been awesome. Supposedly they won't wear flat.  I picked up a Logitech M570 which is basically the wireless version of that Trackman Wheel. I keep it in my laptop bag. Kinda funky switching back and forth between thumb-ball and finger-ball, but it's a really nice trackball too."
ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,sentry07,2,Thu Jul 9 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"It works! When I saw it, I thought ""Hey! I could use a trackball. 99 Cents? Sold!"" I did not know what I had until I got home.

Made me go scrounge around and look for a couple that my mom had tried. She was the worst/best when it came to computer tech and peripherals. She would blow through them like a change in season, fashion, or weight can do to one's wardrobe..   I once swiped the ball out of her big old Microsoft (shame on me) after she'd abandoned it.    Just went on a tear though the house trying to find it.  Found an old Logitech Trackman and a Kensington Expert (neither wireless, however).  ..wonder what we did with the body of the Microsoft - I know I saw it months ago.   I'm cleaning out my late parents' house now, and am in the process of moving cross-country myself, so there's a lot of sorting and junking going on!  Gonna keep an eye out.."
ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,WASDMagician,2,Thu Jul 9 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"Keep hold of that expert, it's supposed to be a really nice trackball."
ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,Y-Cha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think I will. I was actually using it when I'd posted.  The scroll wheel is a little sticky, so I'd dismantled it and cleaned out a bunch of house dandruff and dog hair.  It's better now, but not exactly fluid -  is that normal and due to the magnet?  I kind of wish it could bypass the resistance like my Logitech MX5500's scroll wheel - with a flick - but, considering the design of the wheel and its location, I can see where that might not be ideal.  Do any of the smaller trackball mice have a scroll wheel that does that?  I think I may go look around on that sub...  Also, I'm not sure whether the bearings might need to be replaced or not, as I've never tried any trackball brand new.    Either way, I already feel like the transition to this is easy, probably due to its size and where the ball is located. I figure I'm used to utilizing most of my hand for a mouse, more recently an iMac's, and this is similar, just without pushing the unit around anywhere."
ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,Raib314,3,Thu Jul 9 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"Just curious. Is there a use for these that isn't ordinary home or office operation? I had to help fix a software problem on my bosses computer and I wanted to swallow the ball and choke to death on it, rather than use it another minute. For me, it was worse than a laptop trackpad. Am I missing something or is it just that some people are masochistic?"
ThriftStoreHauls,3clhxo,diego_montoya_jr,4,Wed Jul 8 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"It takes getting used to lol. I hated mine at first but I was determined to adjust.

Back when I was in the US I collected Hen on Nest dishes, but they're somewhat rare here in the UK, so I no longer collect those as the only ones I ever see in shops here are junk.  I also collect DVDs, VHS cassettes and vinyl records.  DVDs: I will buy anything that I think I'd be interested in watching.  VHS: Try to only focus on cheesy horror and sci-fi (even if it's not something I'd be interested in watching), in order to keep the collection as small as possible. I won't buy any massive blockbusters that are readily available on DVD (ie - I skip over Forrest Gump and Titanic). The only exception to this is I will buy my favourite childhood films if I see them on VHS and I will buy VHS copies of popular and readily available horror like Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street, because it goes with my overall horror theme.  Vinyl: I focus on artists I like and only buy things from that time period. What I mean is, I'll buy an Iron Maiden record from 1984 because vinyl still a common media back then. I won't buy a, say, TOOL album from 2006 because it just doesn't seem the same to me when an album's available at the same time on iTunes."

Fur pops up occasionally. Shape doesn't matter quite as much because I sew, so material is everything. It's my way of resolving the fact that I don't want to support cruelty and factory farms, but I also don't want most stuff I own to be made of petroleum products that don't do their job as well and will sit in a landfill for 1000 years after I'm dead.  When I was in college I would go to Goodwill, search for an item that had a tag in it and was 100% silk (or whatever) and carry it with me, comparing textures. I can tell the difference between most textiles at this point, and it's saved me a TON of money over the years, including on items without tags saying what they're made of.

I collect shoes and do this to swap labels onto new boxes if the original one gets crushed/damaged"

ThriftStoreHauls,3c9mg9,riveramblnc,2,Mon Jul 6 05:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah i hear ya, whats worse is when they leave the original retail prices on and then put their OWN price on the other side of the item."

Spotted these at Goodwill for ten bucks and had a good feeling. After I went home to do some research, I found I was having a hell of a time finding the shoe online!  It turns out John Fluevog used to manufacture shoes in Mexico, but closed down their operations in the 90s. There's still a few hecho en mexico lines, but their main shoe lines have been out of that market for more than 20 years! Considering how old these shoes are, they're in stunning condition. There's a couple of minor scuffs that I am sure can be polished out, and the tread on the bottom hasn't been worn down at all. I really can't believe how good my luck was here. I'm hoping to flip for 80-90 dollars.

My dress shoes are garbage so I definitely have a need. There's a lot of old money in Tulsa, though, so I've seen a lot of good brands at the salvation army. Goodwill was surprisingly light on dress shoes (it might be the area of town it's in) but was really heavy on athletics and sneakers. These were an odd man out, I noticed them immediately, as well as the condition they were in and grabbed them without knowing anything about them. I'm so glad I took the risk!"

I was disgruntled because I have super wide feet (they're practically like squares), so shoe shopping has always been a nightmare.   Not so at Fluevogs. These fucking shoes are amazing. My mom probably still has them tucked away somewhere, but I wore them for years until I just couldn't fit them anymore. They barely had any wear after daily use and dance classes."

With Steam games, you get a key, and install discs that need the key to work. The installer launches and then you are asked for a key.

Most newer games requires Steam, Origin, or Uplay to run, so used copies are worthless unless you just want the box to put on a shelf.  MMOs also fall into this category as the keys are tied to an account and cannot be transferred.  Although, for some older MMOs (Like Everquest, Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, etc), custom servers exist, so a used copy can be used on those private servers.  There are... ways... to install games that require Steam/Origin/Uplay by stripping out the Steam/Origin/Uplay components.  Doing so is technically illegal as DMCA prevents circumventing of copy protection."

ThriftStoreHauls,3c27g0,scabdick,7,Sat Jul 4 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"Thrift stores are really hit or miss. It's obviously more time consuming, but being willing to dig through the unorganized stores usually renders better deals for me. Like you, most people will turn away from the big pile of stuff so it's not going to be picked through like the more organized stores are.   I've been told that Goodwill stores pass items between stores so if you donate items to ""goodwill a"" those items might get sent to ""goodwill b"" to be listed. So going to a goodwill in a well-to-do town doesn't necessarily mean that the items there will be better than a goodwill in a poor area. However, with independently owned thrift stores, location does seem to matter more because they are accepting donations from the local community and then reselling them there.  At least, in my area that's the case.   Same thing goes with visiting yard sales - if there are city wide sales in your area some weekend try visiting the parts of town that have lots of big, new houses near each other. If your town has an ""estate community"" check for yard sales in those areas and the items will likely be nicer than in other areas. I like thrift stores as the deals can be good but yard sale prices are dirt cheap. My goodwill has adult shirts for somewhere between $3 and $4 a piece, but then they pull big name brands into this ""boutique"" section that is closer to $6-$8 a piece for items, so it's really not any cheaper than Platos closet. On the other hand, typical yard sale prices are usually more .50-1.00 for shirts or $2-$5 for jeans or jackets."
ThriftStoreHauls,3c27g0,Emmylu91,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm kind of interested in yard sales since I live in NYC and there are guaranteed to be a bunch of them nearly every week, but I have trouble going about how to find them. Do you just look around your community or do you do some sort of online search?"
ThriftStoreHauls,3c27g0,Emmylu91,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"I live in a pretty rural area so it might be different here, but we have several yard sale events such as city wide yard sales, memorial day yard sales, or sales for certain communities in the area (such as duck lake sales for people who live around the lake). Then there are also city festivals that include yard sales.  During any of the yard sale events I mentioned above, there will be lots of listings in the local newspapers. During the events, the local newspapers let people advertise their yard sales super cheap, and then they print a map of the city with little stars in areas where sales are listed. So we just get a paper and go to the areas that show a lot of stars and then there are always several more yard sales going on that just weren't advertised so sometimes we just end up walking or driving from one sale to the next instead of sticking to just the map.   Outside of those yard sale events that are advertised in the newspaper, the next best way I know of to find sales would be ones that are advertised on craigslist but in my area only a small portion of the sales that can be found in a newspaper are also listed on craigslist, so at least here the newspaper is the best way to go."
ThriftStoreHauls,3c27g0,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:30:27 2015 UTC,"They advertise on CL, community FB pages, in the newspaper, etc. Also, a lot of times you find them by just looking out for signs posted outside neighborhoods.  Going to yard sales in rich parts of town can be hit or mess as well, though, in my experience. A lot of richer people don't seem to really understand yard sales and price things based on some insane math they have in their head that doesn't exist in real life. One time I went to an estate sale in a wealthy part of town and they had a sticker on a statuette for said '$80' and when it looked at the bottom there was the original pricetag that they'd clearly missed for $59.99."

The ManU tee is as good as new.  Out of all the stores I hit, Goodwill seemed to be the only worthwhile store that I came across. Salvation Army was junk/had a very small inventory, Housing Works didn't have much of what I was looking for (clothes, electronics), and the others were just chipping away at my patience. Goodwill was the only organized store with a good inventory of items.  Didn't expect thrifting in NYC to be this hard; I'll probably go back in a month or two and see if my luck changes.

Playstation 1 consoles, outside of the so-called audiophile SCPH-1001, run for around $10 on eBay without cords all the time. Honestly, when the PS1 and PS2 can play 99% of the PS1 library, they became as worthless as CD boomboxes.

She'd go and agonize at the shop trying to decide which one to buy.  Then, they became so popular and grown ass women acted like fools grabbing handfuls of whatever was deemed most popular at the moment.  They'd even try to push her aside at the checkout line.  She's grown now and the only toys she liked enough to keep were Legos and Beanies.  They are cute toys if your child is into stuffed animals."

ThriftStoreHauls,3bk4jz,bamstout,15,Mon Jun 29 22:26:26 2015 UTC,Q: Who would spend 850-1700 dollars on that sweater? A: An idiot with money.
ThriftStoreHauls,3bk4jz,Raib314,11,Tue Jun 30 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"It's easy to balk at designer goods like this and think that they are some kind of scam perpetrated on the rich and famous, (or at least wannabe famous), but there is actually some sense to the madness.  Clothing items like these are the direct designs of said designer, and should be looked at more like an art piece than fast fashion. These are produced in limited quantities, often with very high quality craftsmanship, based on designs that completely change twice a year. Because the quantity produced and sold is low, The price per item in ends up being quite high. This is not to say that there is $1000 worth of materials in that sweater, but you have to factor in the entire design process as well, and in that sense it's hard to place a valuation on art.  This designer in particular, Thom Browne, has been regarded as one of the most influential menswear designer is in the world. I guess with that you get to charge whatever you want for a sweater, and people who are interested in fashion and can afford it, will pay.   I certainly won't be spending any of my own money on the stuff, but when I can find it at a thrift store, hell yeah.   Long story short, I consider things such as this ""wearable art"", where it has transcended serving a utilitarian purpose to become something quite different. we all have different tastes in art, so while some person might look at a painting and say that is the most stupid/ugly thing they have ever seen in their entire life, another will look at it and find it to be the most beautiful.  That being said, saying someone would be moronic to pay that much is like making the comparison of paying a lot for an expensive painting as being idiotic, instead of buying a inexpensive print at target for $15. The ""they serve the same purpose!"" argument doesn't really hold up in that case.  And paintings go for a LOT more than $850"

ThriftStoreHauls,3bk4jz,Plagueology,2,Tue Jun 30 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"It's not your understanding of the definition of the word, it's your assumption on how value is measured.  Diamond rings, for instance, have absolutely NO value outside of retail. However, people still see it as 'spending money on something' and not throwing it away, when in essence, that's exactly what is happening; You are throwing away your money in exchange for the feel-good effect it gives you to purchase something. Because once you take that seventeen-hundred dollar price tag off your sweater - or engagement ring - it'll never EVER EVER sell for as much, unless it turns out to be some limited whatever 20 years later.   [edit] having said all this, I would not drop $1,700.00 on a sweater, nor $170.00 - But I am not the target market."

ThriftStoreHauls,3bgp7g,_KanyeWest_,18,Mon Jun 29 01:53:29 2015 UTC,Every time someone posts a haul like this I have a hard time believing them just because the stores near me charge outrageous amounts of money for even simple shit.  Like a Wii or an N64 would be anywhere from 50-100 dollars and any game that isn't complete trash is 10-20. My goodwilll has copies of some old ass World of Warcraft expansion and tries selling them for 40 bucks each.
ThriftStoreHauls,3bgp7g,Worm_Whomper,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"This.  I'm willing to give OP the benefit of the doubt on being honest and all, but seriously.  This rarely happens at all, but all that stuff in a single weekend for those prices?  I need Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler to do a 'Really' segment on this  ;-)"
ThriftStoreHauls,3bgp7g,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:55:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Same.   I'm not saying that OP is lying, but with as often as hauls like this get posted I think a lot of people just gather up their collection of vintage stuff and then claim they got it all in one lucky swoop of Goodwill, when in reality it's probably stuff they've been collecting for a while from eBay and other sources.  It's like how on Antiques Roadshow everyone always claims they paid a dollar for everything. Every, single person who has ever been on Antiques Roadshow just happened to get lucky and found a Picasso for sale for a dollar in a junk shop.  It's way more fun to say, 'Wow! Look at this lucky discovery I made! Goodwill just happened to have every rare [item] ever made and they only charged me two bucks!' then it is to say, 'Here's my collection that I spent a year scouring eBay and the flea markets for and paid market value on.'"

The Goodwill I went to for the N64 still has a PS3 with no connections for $100, and a bunch of garbage games for so much more than they are worth.  Most of the finds were garage sales, with the oldest stuff being from one sale."

In high school I had this friend John, he clued me in on the Salvation Army having Sega CD games. I stopped down and picked up some I was missing and from what I recall, I was getting pretty close to a full set. (Which I now have ;) )   Anyhow, he had also mentioned his dad wanted this bright orange ugly couch from there. He was making fun of this couch so bad that when I went to get the Sega CD games I saw the couch and cracked up. I'm pretty sure the father never bought it as I had seen it there for some period after.  To make a long story longer, John and I had a little falling out after high school. But nothing too major from what I recall. He then moved, and eventually moved back to the area with a friend. I was supposed to see him that coming weekend and pick up where we left off.   John committed suicide a few days before, and I never got to see him and make amends. I'd like to think he had reached out to meet up because we were OK by this point.   Anytime I go to that Salvation Army all I can think of is my friend John and that silly orange couch. =)"
ThriftStoreHauls,3biurx,SegaCDUniverse,7,Mon Jun 29 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"I started thrifting and going to yard sales with my parents when I was very young. I don't remember the very first thing I ever chose for myself, but one of my early purchases was an elephant soap dish.   I picked it because I liked elephants, and I liked the little bird on the elephant's trunk. I've had this for nearly 20 years now, but I have never actually used it as a soap dish, since I know it would end up falling off the edge of the sink and smashing on the floor. It stands on a bookshelf."

I ended up in a shirt I'm sure a classmate wore. But later, as an adult, I went more often. My first real purchase that I wore a lot was a man's wool blazer in a really nice deep turquoise color. I wore it with a lot of things. Now a week doesn't go by that I've not been to at least one store near me, if not the three or four I usually hit."

Pleeeeeaaaasse""    I guess she didn't have the money to get it but gave them a few bucks to hold it till the next day. Next day we come back and they sold it.    Super sad."
ThriftStoreHauls,3biurx,humanman42,3,Mon Jun 29 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure this is a thrifting story but it's what got me started.  The lower rack on my dishwasher was broken and I was bummed at the replacement cost I had been quoted.  I was walking to the park with my children on ""big item trash day"". Each household could put one big item on the curb for free trash collection.  My neighbor had put a dishwasher on the curb and it was just like mine and the lower rack was perfect so I switched them out and got it free.  That neighborhood had lots of yard sales and I was able to buy big wheels, a turtle sandbox, roller skates - lots of good kid stuff for a fraction of the cost."

I remember the first thing I ever thrifted with my own allowance was a 70's telephone table when I was 8.. I don't even know what I needed a telephone table for.

ThriftStoreHauls,3bdgtm,frenchieRU,4,Tue Jun 30 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"If you're curious, here's a post detailing the differences between real vs knockoff longchamps. I thrifted a dark brown longchamp for $3 a few months ago, and realized it was fake because of that blog post. It's still a great bag, I've had no problems with it. No ragrets.  But your picture reminded me of the article because of the pattern on the leather(fishscale rather than crosshatch), the stitching connecting the handles to the bag(area the stitching borders is too big), and the lack of zipper(my fake bag was also missing the zipper). If you're interested, definitely check out the article. Might be relevant if you ever need longchamp to fix your bag - I imagine they wouldn't give many shits about a knockoff.   I have held/looked at authentic longchamps from a reputable retailer, and I definitely noticed that they had crosshatch leather and a flat handle - which makes me believe that the article writer didn't just pull that article out of their ass. :P"

ThriftStoreHauls,3bdgtm,_Administrator_,2,Sun Jun 28 22:47:50 2015 UTC,I never saw one before a friend gave me one as a gift last year.  I think I gravely offended her by saying it would make a good bag for shopping estate sales because it fold so nicely.  I've noticed other people with them out and about since then.  Apparently they retire colors annually and have a big following.  Mine has been useful as a shopping bag!
ThriftStoreHauls,3bdgtm,starshinesuckerpunch,2,Sun Jun 28 23:41:06 2015 UTC,It's a very popular bag. Lightweight but comfortable and roomy. Price is generally between $100 and $150 which is a little expensive but not really if you compare them to other common designer bags like Coach or Michael Kors which sell for two or three times that price.   I have a ton of purses and I keep going back to my Longchamp because it's just so perfect. I also like that it doesn't really go out of style. They've been making this same bag year after year without changing it too much.

ThriftStoreHauls,3b4np7,omnipotent-sloth,2,Fri Jun 26 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"I still have my Twilight Princess and Zelda Collectors Edition for gamecube, are these worth money now?"
ThriftStoreHauls,3b4np7,MoonPrisimPower,2,Fri Jun 26 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, they are first party nintendo games that are discontinued so as you expect most games like this will rise in price eventually... As for the collectors edition it only came bundles with a certain series of consoles so it's not as though everyone could have just found it on a store shelf when it was released. Plus it has 4 while games and a demo so thats a factor.  As for twilight princess its price is up there because when it was released it was released for both wii and gamecube as I'm sure you know. But with most people moving to wii, many opted for that reason as it had motion controls and such and they wanted to play that way. The gamecube version sold fine, it just didn't have as long of a production life as the wii version did. Also several player prefer the gamecube version so they can play it with a standard controller and not the motion controls."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b4np7,AdamsDJ,2,Fri Jun 26 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! The twilight princess for gamecube was a relitively small release.

Craigslist and eBay are also popular places where thieves put stolen goods. Some bigger thrift stores take your ID and stuff when you sell to them so they know who sold this item to them, and where to find them if the item they sold was actually stolen."

ThriftStoreHauls,3b5tk6,gotrich,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:10:26 2015 UTC,True you have to sift through the chaff to find some wheat.  I guess I should be more specific when I try to be subtly sarcastic :/  I've probably been thrifting and garage sale shopping longer than some of you guys have been alive. [yes...I'm old] I do it for the fun of the hunt and to find things to fill in my collections.  Occasionally I might find a really good bargain or collectible item and resale it in my Etsy store.   I'm under no illusions that I will get rich or make a living thrifting.  It is just fun.  But.  Mostly I thrift for the fun of it.  Sometimes you get a great score.  I sold these five chairs that I got for $20 each for $3000 for all five.   Mid Century Modern designer.  Arne Norell. Sometimes you get lucky!  Other times....it's old baby clothes and dirty toys.  Oh well.  Part of my vintage Fiestaware collection  Always looking for more.  The thrill of the hunt!!!

ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,ecoshia,17,Thu Jun 25 18:56:57 2015 UTC,Hahah I agree with your sentiment. This specific designer has an insanely high price point and I could never see myself paying full retail for something like this - though I guess that's why were in /r/thriftstorehauls and not /r/expensivemalefashion.
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,mrcloudies,8,Thu Jun 25 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, they don't look any better then clothes from Target or something..  Even if i was incredibly wealthy i couldn't see myself wasting that kind of money on a shirt when i could spend a fraction of the price, and i didn't even think any of those clothes really even looked that good."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,JustWiggl3s,13,Thu Jun 25 20:09:33 2015 UTC,They kinda do look better. Like way better.
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,mrcloudies,10,Thu Jun 25 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"this shirt is over $600  It doesn't look any better then a blue dress shirt from any place else. It may be better made, but from 5 feet away you aren't going to be able to notice a difference between the $600 shirt, and the $30 one."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,stanleypup,13,Thu Jun 25 20:47:16 2015 UTC,"When buying something in this range you are mostly doing it for quality of the materials, construction of the garment, overall fit and exclusivity of the brand name. At a certain point the material quality, construction and overall fit are going to reach a ceiling - from there on out it's all about brand name. So if you are someone who cares about the material, quality and the brand name of clothes from an Italian designer you should be pretty happy spending the $600 premium on a shirt. Otherwise the Target shirt works great (and can fit great too if taken to a tailor!).  There's companies out there like Outlier which max out material, construction and quality (though Outlier can double as utility as well), which I believe long-term are completely worth spending the money on. But it's all subjective and it's truly about what you are looking to get out of in a shirt."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,CineSuppa,2,Thu Jun 25 22:42:08 2015 UTC,"Glad you mentioned Outlier, beyond a certain point (Probably around the same prices as Outlier,) you're just paying for the designer name. In the case of these shorts, that's probably 80% of the cost."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,misskittyfantastic0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:37:21 2015 UTC,"I'd vote for simply exclusivity of the brand name. But it's still no one I've ever heard of, and for $600, I could get a bespoke dress shirt made and have enough money left over for a tie and a very nice lunch."
ThriftStoreHauls,3b3gm1,witheld,3,Fri Jun 26 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"I could definitely tell the difference between a $30 shirt and a $600 from five feet away. The $30 shirt may look okay in a photo, but it is not going to look that good on - particularly after it has be cleaned. I'm not saying paying $600 for a shirt isn't ridiculous; I'm just saying there is a noticeable difference in the two."

Just like if I was an artist, even though my ""modern art"" looked like a 4 year old painted a canvas one single color, it could fetch a price of thousands, while incredible, true talent art goes for a dime a dozen.

On that alone, quite a nice find.   Also, the item marked ""Trade Alpha Mark"" (or Alpha Trade Mark) is a shutter, something you'd usually see on a large-format camera and usually with lens attached to it. And these are likely the lenses that would attach to them: http://i.imgur.com/Buaifii.jpg  There doesn't appear to be a camera body or any other photo-taking apparatus in that kit."

Mostly there's just the files that tell you how safe they are, how to contain them, and (mostly) what they are. There's also stories to be found too, either connected to the file pages or on their own page. The best way to go through it is to wander around picking out ones that look/sound interesting to you; it doesn't have to be read in numerical order. Some are creepy, some aren't!

ThriftStoreHauls,3aj7mv,Janununuh,6,Sat Jun 20 18:46:24 2015 UTC,Why such a high retail?
ThriftStoreHauls,3aj7mv,TehSundanceKid,4,Sat Jun 20 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"It is a high-end chair for sure, and even at this price is marketed as Herman Miller's ""budget"" ergonomic chair. All the extra cash goes to little things. For example, the pivot point for the recline position is moved forward to be in line with the knee, so that your feet aren't lifted off the ground when leaning back. Once you sit in any truly ergonomic office chair, you really can't go back, it will save your back over the course of a work day.   That said, I still think the price is ridiculous, and couldn't really see myself ever buying one new."
ThriftStoreHauls,3aj7mv,vincent_vancough,5,Sun Jun 21 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"I think Herman Miller usually markets to design oriented individuals or to businesses, both of which are willing to allocate a lot of money for furnishings.  They are also pretty eco friendly, use quality materials and are manufactured in the USA which contributes to the price tag."

Then I picked up a Schecter bass for $80 on Craigslist and can probably get $200-250 for it easy. I think I'll keep it for a while though

Not only are the bags NOT Sonoma Small Bucket Zips, but the first digit ""P"" is completely wrong and would never be used on ANY Coach. Any bag with this serial number is counterfeit.""  I realize your serial number starts with an ""S"" but from the same ebay article they say that any Coach serial number that starts with an ""N"" thru ""Z"" is fake.  Go to ebay and search ""Coach 4907"" and see if your purse looks like a small bucket bag with a zippered top?  Just  from the Coach Creed you photographed I'd say yours is fake because in the authentic Coach purse with that number a flap does not come out of the purse."
