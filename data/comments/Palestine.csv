EU council also acknowledged Israel's ""legitimate security concerns,"" saying that rocket fire from Gaza must also end.   It's also worth noting that the Israeli authorities said in May that the demolition of the community's homes was imminent, as they cleared way for the expansion of the illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim."

Secondly, if Israel (and Egypt for that matter) simply stopped the blockade and allowed Gazans to open its seaport and airport for importing and exporting, and to finally be allowed to build up its economy and get their people living and working. There will be no need to retaliate from Israelis shooting at fisherman and farmers. There will also be no need for the tunnels, etc... That's not to say that there may be isolated splinter cells such as ISIS, who may continue but again. Hamas does not have the proper tools to deal with terrorists.

Israel would of course find something else to whine about as prolifically, I'm sure. But the point here is that regardless of your opinion of Hamas, they're not sociopathic children who do things on pointless whims.   It's also important to note that they have to deal with the results of Israeli attacks on Gaza, whilst Israel absolves itself of any wrong-doing or responsibility, and Israelis can effectively pretend that Gaza doesn't even exist."

As soon as Adam Wishart says ""During my time in a Zionist education camp as a kid..."" at around the 2:00 mark, I knew what I was in for, but what an absolutely disgraceful documentary this is. Totally one-sided - the documentary is peppered with footage of Palestinian violence against Israelis, while Israeli violence against Palestinians is completely glossed over.  The maker of this documentary interviews an Israeli property developer who is building homes on Palestinian land, and we are supposed to hail him as some kind of entrepreneur according to this? Note how Wishart uses the terms Palestinian ""neighbourhoods"" or ""areas"" - not ""land"" or ""the Palestinian country"". This man is helping Israeli settlers illegally occupy Palestinian land and we are meant to see this as a good thing!  Wishart also interviews a couple of vile Zionists who say things like ""Who are the Palestinians occupied by? Palestine is Jewish!"". A total disgrace and an affront to journalism, low even for the BBC. And some people are criticising him for not being pro-Israel enough!! Zionists are never happy."
Palestine,3e08sb,AndyBea,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm ashamed of how the BBC treats Palestine.  The PSC is sometimes pushing back against this fraud see - http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/amena-saleem/softball-interviews-israeli-ministers-breach-impartiality-code-bbc-admits  In 2006 the corporation’s own governors commissioned a report. The Thomas Report, as it became known, was quickly shoved under the carpet by the BBC and business continued as usual.  Its been made very difficult to find - I can now only see it (clumsily formatted) at http://web.archive.org/web/20081121214610/http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/docs/reviews/panel_report_final.txt  What did the BBC find about itself in April 2006? Why, that it was very pro-Israel ... however, you can't tell that from the summary - indeed, it starts off by lying about what it found:    ... Our assessment is that, apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias. On the contrary, there was evidence of a commitment to be fair, accurate and impartial. There is high quality reporting from location, some outstanding current affairs programmes and the website provides much valuable historical and other context.    You have to go to section 4.7 to find the actual results of their examination, and see the huge discrepancy:    4.7 Among the findings from the quantitative content analysis which the researchers judge to be most important for the Panel are these:  ... - that a disparity (in favour of Israelis) existed in BBC coverage taken as a whole in the amount of talk time given to non-party political Israelis and Palestinians;   that a disparity (in favour of Israelis) existed in BBC coverage taken as a whole in the amount of talk time given to Israelis and Palestinians; that there was a broad parity in BBC coverage taken as a whole in terms of the appearance of Israeli and Palestinian party political actors; that a disparity (in favour of Israelis) existed in BBC coverage taken as a whole in terms of the appearance of non-party political Israeli and Palestinian actors; that a disparity (in favour of Israelis) existed in BBC coverage taken as a whole in terms of the appearance of Israeli and Palestinian actors;   ... - that some important themes were relatively overlooked in the coverage of the conflict, most notably in the recent period, the annexation of land in and around East Jerusalem;   that BBC journalists generally did not provide historical context in their reporting of the conflict; that BBC broadcast news reported Israeli and Palestinian fatalities differently in that Israeli fatalities generally receive greater coverage than Palestinian fatalities (see paragraph 4.9 below).   ... 4.9 The research also included an analysis of the coverage of the fatalities in the conflict. In the research period, it appears from the most commonly used data (provided by the Israeli Government and by the human rights group B'Tselem) that the death of an Israeli killed by the Palestinian side was more likely to be reported by the BBC than the death of a Palestinian killed by the Israeli side. In the relevant period, the researchers found that there were some 20/23 Israeli fatalities and 98 Palestinian fatalities.     Nobody can claim that that is not systematic bias!"
Palestine,3e08sb,AndyBea,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:06 2015 UTC,"The actual content of the documentary seems to fit into the bias exposed by the report, most notably the lack of historical context provided. I wrote a complaint to the BBC about this documentary, I wonder how far this will get.   For those who can't watch the documentary, some highlights:    The maker, Adam Wishart, makes his bias clear from the start, referencing the time he spent in a Zionist ""education camp"" as a child. The documentary is, of course, peppered with footage of violence by Palestinians against Israelis. There is no footage of violence occurring the other way - it is not even mentioned! There is one Palestinian fatality mentioned, but this occurred at the hands of another Palestinian when he drove his car into passengers waiting for the train, killing three Israelis as well. This brings me onto the next point: One of the Israeli fatalities was a baby. No mention of dead Palestinian babies or children, even though they outnumber dead Israeli babies almost 20 to 1 (see B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, the UN) Wishart makes reference several times to Palestinian ""neighbourhoods"", ""areas"" or ""suburbs"". This is intentionally misleading. What he is actually referring to is the Palestinian land in East Jerusalem, which is being built up to provide homes to Israelis.  Wishart interviews an Israeli property developer who is building such homes for several minutes, but makes no mention of the fact that he is building homes in occupied territory under international law. Wishart euphemistically refers to the ""capture"" of East Jerusalem in 1967, making it sound like a justified act of war. What he is actually referring to is the illegal annexation of East Jersualem, as recognised by all countries except Israel (even the US does not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel).  He interviews several extremist Zionist who say blatant lies ranging from ""The Arabs all want to murder us"" to ""Who are the Palestinians occupied by? Dig down under the roots and Palestine is Jewish, there has always been a Jewish state there!"" Wishart does not correct these lies, which could lead to an otherwise ignorant viewer believing these statements to be facts.   I expected there to be some bias, but this truly astounded me - it was more like a North Korean propaganda film than a documentary. Truly a disgrace to impartial journalism.  ETA: Wishart also shows the wall put up in East Jersualem. What reason could there possibly be for this, he speculates? ""To cordon off squalor and deprivation."" Of course. Adam Wishart is actually taking a lot of heavy criticism for this - some faith in humanity restored, perhaps? Nope, he's being criticised for being biased against Israel! Couldn't make it up.  ETA2: I realise I have already made these points earlier in the thread, I was just pasting the full text of my complaint here."
Palestine,3e08sb,AndyBea,0,Tue Jul 21 17:01:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. It really is shocking how the BBC abuses its position.  Nor is it just bias - sometimes it lies.  Difficult to prove in a news context? Very difficult - but here's an absolutely blatant case which they refuse to correct.  The UN did a report on the 2002 Jenin Massacre, its at http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/FD7BDE7666E04F5C85256C08004E63ED  The UN report uses the word ""massacre"" 7 times - in every case, as if that's really what did happen.  What does the BBC report say? It's headlined ""UN says no massacre in Jenin"" at Jenin on 1 August, 2002 - see it at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2165272.stm  How come the BBC has flat out lied in favour of Israel?  There are many other shocking cases where the BBC covers up murder. Jane Corbin's account of ""Death in the Med"" interviews only the perpetrators, it says nothing about the cold-blooded killing of 1 American and 8 Turkish, along with the severe injury to up to 50 others!"

Also they probably wont allow the right of return, at least I cant imagine it will ever be willingly instated. But whered that question come from?   Maybe you didn't see the memo - the Zionists were desperate to join the UN after they'd been refused twice.  So desperate were they to renounce violence and be granted the right to dispute-resolution that they went back to the UN a third time in May 1949 and begged to be allowed to become a member.  On the third occasion they promised, almost as solemnly as they could possibly do, to let the people back to their homes.   Representatives of the new Israeli government did this from the podium to the entire congregated world body, and they did it in writing.  First in a personal promise to representatives of the whole world assembled in New York:    ... Mr. [Abba] EBAN (Israel) understood that the questions raised in connexion with Israel's application for membership in the United Nations were being discussed in the light of the compliance of Israel with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly... ""Israel held no views and pursued no policies on any questions which were inconsistent with the Charter or with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council"" http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/85255e950050831085255e95004fa9c3/1db943e43c280a26052565fa004d8174    Secondly and in writing, at the Laussanne conference - even the notoriously biased Wikipedia can't disguise the fact that this promise was most solemnly made:    ""On 12 May 1949, the conference achieved its only success when the parties signed the Lausanne Protocol on the framework for a comprehensive peace, which included territories, refugees, and Jerusalem. Israel agreed in principle to allow the return of a number of Palestinian refugees. This Israeli agreement was made under pressure from the United States, and because the Israelis wanted United Nations membership, which required the settlement of the refugees problem.""  ""Once Israel was admitted to the UN, it retreated from the protocol it had signed, because it was completely satisfied with the status quo, and saw no need to make any concessions with regard to the refugees or on boundary questions."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Conference,_1949    You can see the whole Protocol signed by Walter Eytan on behalf of Israel at http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4A5EF29A5E977E2E852561010079E43C  Note carefully the text of General Assembly Resolution 273 of May 11, 1949 admitting Israel into the United Nations, and noting Israel's stated agreement to comply with Resolution 194     Recalling its resolutions of 29 November 1947 [ie UNGA 181] and 11 December 1948 [ie UNGA 194] and taking note of the declarations and explanations made by the representative of the Government of Israel before the ad hoc Political Committee in respect of the implementation of the said resolutions ... http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/83E8C29DB812A4E9852560E50067A5AC    A few days later the same man who had put Israel's binding signature to the Protocol, Walter Eytan, explained how Israel needed to wriggle out of the promise that he'd just made, on behalf of Israel, to let the people back to their homes:    Walter Eytan, the head of the Israeli delegation: ""My main purpose was to begin to undermine the protocol of May 12 [Lausanne Conference], which we had signed only under duress of our struggle for the admission to the U.N. Refusal to sign would ... have immediately been reported to the Secretary-General and the various governments."" http://www.positivepractices.com/PeaceEducation/TheOriginofthePalestine-I.html - Published By Jews For Justice in The Middle East    Resolution 194 has been reaffirmed more than 25 times [28 times cited at http://www.ifamericansknew.org/history/origin.html ] - and confirmed more than 130 times over the past 55 67 years. http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/189/38197.html  Face it, the Zionists never acted honourably in the past - just as they refuse to act legally today.  Unless you tell me I've missed something of course ... but so many Zionists have run away from this discussion every time I've brought it up that I've come to think they're all frauds and hasbarists."

It must be returned, either to the owner/heirs of the owner, or put up for auction with the proceeds going to ""communal funds"" and a trust.  That's what had to happen to stolen Jewish property and that's what must happen to stolen Palestinian property.

Palestine,3dmu5n,AndyBea,-3,Sat Jul 18 06:21:21 2015 UTC,"Tell me: when the Jewish boycott of Nazis was in place did they stop using motor cars?   No - and the Zionists in the know brazenly profiteered from it.  This is a little something that appeared in the Israeli media a few weeks ago:    Apr. 14, 2015 - Calls for sanctions were resisted by German Jews and many in pre-state Israel.  ... ""We being Jews ourselves are astonished and disgusted with this propaganda against Germany, being based on absolutely untrue statements. The news of cruelties, murdering of Jews, men and women, etc., are perfect lies from beginning to end.   This news comes from and is spread abroad by certain traitors, literary men, who fled from Germany when the National Government was formed, and is supplied by communistic circles.  ""We would be grateful if you would do everything you can to stop the defamatory assault on Germany, to help to prevent the boycott of German products, and to see to it that the press in your country does not publish distorted reports on events in Germany,"" implored Wachtel in his defense of Hitler.  The letter, which has only recently been made public, was written to Erich Ney, a German-Zionist businessman who had immigrated to Palestine in the 1920s and cultivated close ties with dozens of German companies, mostly in the textile and fabric industry.  ... Within a few years, Ney had become a major importer of goods from German firms and a prominent Tel Aviv business figure. When Hitler came to power, however, he decided to promote a boycott of German products, despite the hefty income he had derived from his business dealings with Germany. The letter Ney received from Wachtel was but one of dozens he received in April 1933 from owners of German companies, all concerned about damage to their businesses as a result of an anti-German boycott by Jews. Ney was sent the letter after he contacted his German clients to express concern over the harassment of German-Jewish business owners.  The letters, translated from German with the assistance of a staff member at the Jewish Museum, Berlin, were recently transferred to the Massuah Institute for the Study of the Holocaust at Kibbutz Tel Yitzhak, near Netanya, with the involvement of Ney’s daughter, Ruth Peled, and the Association of Israelis of Central European Origin, of which Ney was a member. Peled, a noted psychotherapist who was also a sculptor and author, died last year at age 84. The Massuah Institute maintains a major Holocaust archive, with much of its content available online.  The German firms contacted Ney following a boycott of German-Jewish businesses that the Nazis organized for April 1, 1933, which in turn spurred greater efforts by Jewish communities not only in Palestine but also in the United States, Poland, and even Egypt and Morocco, to boycott German products. Dozens of letters sent to Ney contained denials that Jews were being harassed, calling the allegations false propaganda being spread by Jews outside of Germany. The German business people also assured Ney they were not anti-Semitic and were determined to maintain good relations with Jews.  A number of the letters were also marked by a sense of urgency. The owner of a Berlin textile company, for example, wrote the following to Ney on April 4: ""Since the boycott [against Jews] in Germany has in the meantime been halted and will not continue, we hope the Jews who are acting responsibly in Palestine, and who we are happy to see are not agreeing to a boycott of German products, will calm down.""  In Palestine, the calls for an economic boycott of Germany began a few days after Hitler was sworn in as chancellor on January 30, 1933. The first discussion of the issue by the Jewish community leadership in Palestine took place the following month, says historian Yoav Gelber, emeritus professor at the University of Haifa and the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and head of the Herzl Institute for the Study of Zionism and History.  ... As early as March 1933, with initial reports of harassment of German Jews, representatives of the U.S.-Jewish Congress met in New York for an emergency meeting and decided to launch a protest campaign, including demonstrations in 70 cities and a main rally at Madison Square Garden.  ... Although the Jews had difficulty getting their money out of Nazi Germany, under this arrangement they were permitted to deposit funds in German banks. The funds were used by importers in Palestine to buy German goods that were then sold to others.   When the German Jews arrived in Palestine, they got most of their money back, but the arrangement also spurred demand for German products here.  The arrangement was highly controversial and exacerbated the ideological divide in the Yishuv. However, it also generated a large inflow of cash that helped rebuild the local economy, which had been suffering an economic crisis since the late 1920s. In current terms, the total sums transferred amounted to 840 million British pounds (nearly $1.3 billion).   ... ""Formally, the Jewish boycott [of Nazi Germany] lasted until the outbreak of World War II. But in practice, it was not effective due to the [fund] transfer agreement and the fact that Germany was the Yishuv’s primary export market for citrus - and citrus was its main export,"" said Gelber.  ""What killed these boycott efforts were not only the transfer agreements, but also business initiatives by German Jews. By virtue of the agreements, they could get property and goods out. So, one immigrant from Germany brought 30 Agfa cameras with him and sold them, and then brought two Mercedes cars for sale in Palestine.""  The boycott enjoyed popular support among Jews in Palestine, said Gelber, and was featured in the local press, but had little practical effect here compared to in Diaspora communities. As noted, there was a major disparity that prevailed in Palestine between a Jewish community that supported it and a Jewish leadership that needed the funds generated by the sale of German imports. http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.652576    Why's it taken 80 years to discover that Stephen Wise and the AJC and the JWV set out to sacrifice the German Jews (99% anti-Zionist) for the benefit of Palestine?  Why do I have to read it in the Israeli media?  Or is this a question I must not ask?"

Look at the next part:    But following the meeting, the Yesha Council, which represents the settler movement, issued a scathing statement that “A government that does not build loses its right to exist.”    The settlers are stating the obvious - Zionism was always everything to do with land-theft.  Without it, the Zionist project is over all bar the shouting.  After all, if you cannot build profitable dwellings on land that is free then the whole of your economy must be worthless. A boon-doggle, a project that is simply haemorrhaging money."
Palestine,3di6pw,Garet-Jax,5,Thu Jul 16 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"From the linked article:  ""The watchdog reported 48 violations against media freedoms in the West Bank and Gaza during the month of June.  Over half of the attacks were carried out by Palestinian authorities, the remainder committed by Israeli forces.""    But it gets even BETTER!  Also from the linked article:  ""According to MADA, the year was the deadliest ever for journalists in the West Bank and Gaza, with 17 journalists reportedly killed by Israeli forces during the conflict in Gaza.  While around three-quarters of violations were carried out by Israeli forces -- 112 in Gaza and 239 in the West Bank -- MADA reported that violations by Palestinian security forces in 2014 were at their highest since 2008.""    Seems to me that Israel is the REAL attacker of media freedoms in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  They KILL journalists."
Palestine,3di6pw,WiseCynic,4,Thu Jul 16 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"They're not mutually exclusive.   Israel has a shitty and deadly track record on press freedom that belies its much vaunted liberal democracy status. It ranks something like #101 in RSF's press freedom index.   But the PA particularly is utterly craven in how it treats press freedom. I mean, I don't think one expects Hamas to be great liberal bastions of press freedom and they're not. But one can see how desperately the PA is trying to hold onto power in its approach to press freedom.   The PA is an organisation with foundations of sand and one can draw a direct line between its poor leadership, external support for its poor leadership, and the overall lack of democracy in the West Bank because of the lurching fear frustrated Palestinians would elect a party dedicated to fighting or resisting Israel."
Palestine,3di6pw,MrBoonio,2,Thu Jul 16 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not discounting the PA being a gang of cocks about freedom of the press.

Palestine,3di6pw,WiseCynic,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"The Palestinians need far more credit as beacons of decency than anyone has been giving them.  They've never murdered their own for ""political reasons"" (the way that Israel has sometimes done).  They've never used their children as human shields (as 100s of 1000s of settlers are doing).  Even their disgusting cowardly Judenrat, the PA, don't target and murder the journalists who might expose them.  In 2004, at the height of the massacres we still insultingly call an Intifada, they spoke out against using recruiting children to murder the barbarous invaders - even while Israel continued its long standing policies of recruiting, with torture, children as informers.  Racked by crime and violence as they are, they still do an astonishing job of remaining decent.  What they need from us is our full-blooded support for their just demands, return to their homes and lands.  Oh, and guidance in the ways of Western propaganda and hasbara - reminders that, if Sheikh Yassin ever put his name to the ""Hamas Charter"" (did he?), then it was for Israeli money. It is possible and necessary to denounce heroes for collaboration. Islamics are to be respected - but they can be corrupted and that's what obviously happened here."

Palestine,3dg3kq,Futurist110,8,Thu Jul 16 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're clear on the difference between East Jerusalem Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. The latter are Israeli citizens with, in theory, all the rights that come with that. The latter are the ones with a somewhat flimsy status which you sometimes hear about them losing, and in general they face a lot more discrimination and oppression.   If I had to guess, I'd say Israeli Arabs would be far more likely to prefer staying under Israeli rule (vs. a possible Palestinian state) than East Jerusalem residents, because their lives are a lot better and they get much more of the benefits already of Israeli rule. Israelis like to talk about how Israeli Arabs have the most freedom and best standard of living of any population in the Arab world, which is probably true (aside from Bedouin); but that's far from the case for lots of people in East Jerusalem and I'm sure that would influence their preference."
Palestine,3dg3kq,Zorro_Darksauce,5,Thu Jul 16 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am aware that the overwhelming majority of Israeli Arabs are Israeli citizens whereas the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Arabs are not Israeli citizens.

After all, theoretically speaking, it is possible that some East Jerusalem Arabs want to become Israeli citizens but are afraid to do this as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is unresolved in order to avoid being shunned by their families, relatives, friends, and acquaintances.   I know some had the option of citizenship when Jerusalem was annexed after the 67 war, but most didn't take it, similar to the Golan Druze.   Yes, that is correct; however, I am unsure that one can automatically conclude from this fact that most East Jerusalem Arabs prefer Palestinian rule over Israeli rule."

Palestine,3dg3kq,Garet-Jax,7,Thu Jul 16 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. As long as you are Arab (either Muslim or Christian) you are automatically discriminated against. The difference is easier traveling abroad without a visa. It's important to note that people immigrating into Israel from other countries automatically get Israeli citizenship and passport while keeping their original documents, while if an Arab jerusalmite is caught living in the West Bank their citizenship is withdrawn. You can see how unfair that is."
Palestine,3dg3kq,H_K_14,2,Thu Jul 16 11:10:07 2015 UTC,"Reddit as a whole needs to help folks like you who are very obviously reasonable make this kind of pointless Israeli assholery better known.   It's a big, complicated world, and maybe Israel can justify some kind of extreme stuff based on genuine national security concerns and terrorism phobia, but this kind of discrimination is just plain terrible. I don't think many Jews outside of Israel know about this sort of thing, and I don't even know if many Jews inside Israel really understand this.   Maybe this is the sort of thing where just making people aware of what's happening could lead to changes."
Palestine,3dg3kq,Garet-Jax,0,Sat Jul 18 19:22:41 2015 UTC,Arab jerusalmite is caught living in the West Bank their citizenship is withdrawn   That is incorrect. Most of the Arabs living in Jerusalem have Israeli residency and not citizenship. Residents who move out of Jerusalem are indeed stripped of their residency status after a few months. Citizens are never stripped of their citizenship by Israel based on where they live.
Palestine,3dg3kq,uncannylizard,4,Thu Jul 16 12:32:29 2015 UTC,But they lose this blue ID and get a green ID. What does that mean?

Palestine,3dg3kq,TAEHSAEN,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:21 2015 UTC,"I think that most Palestinians would prefer to live in Israel with Israeli citizenship, but would find it unacceptable if Israel only accepted one tiny extremely high value piece of land.

Palestine,3dg3kq,Rocketdown,0,Sat Jul 18 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"The problem (from the Israeli perspective) with annexing all of the Palestinian territories, though, is that doing this will very likely ensure that Israel will no longer have a Jewish-majority population."

Israel's reluctance to annex the land while exercising total military control of it,   the legal fiction that it is in any way autonomous,  the blaming of 'radical settlers' while funding and incentivizing their settling, protecting them militarily and enabling the religious loons that whip them up,   the claim that the Palestinians have no good leadership when several of their most promising candidates have been expelled or arrested,  the suggestion that 'disengaging' from Gaza was some sort of goodwill gesture,  the claim that 'it's not about the settlements' when much of it patently is, and even the most right wing American Presidents have denounced them,  even the 'our hands are tied' mantra by the Israeli left that claims not to support settlements while never acting decisively to put an end to their ongoing expansion much less existence.

Bush actually tacitly gave Sharon the go ahead on settlement building.   As part of a final peace settlement, Israel must have secure and recognized borders, which should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338. In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949   Bush also apparently gave secret assurances to Israel, agreeing to  construction inside settlement blocs.  Given that there are no 'new' settlement blocs - only the fiction of 'extensions' of existing ones, this is about as good a green light as it gets."
Palestine,3daele,MrBoonio,2,Wed Jul 15 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"You're right, thanks for the clarification- all I meant is that the settlement expansion is so patently wrong that even W had to pay lip service to the 'no new settlements' line, though from what you've linked to here that's just more phony plausible deniability for W while providing cover for Sharon's efforts to expand in the West Bank:   HISHAM MELHEM: There was some talk about contradictory signals from the secretary of state and the president, but I think the president set the record straight today. He said there was no such contradictions and that he’s clear on new expansion of settlements. But he admitted that this issue is not settled. He admitted that it is not going to engage Sharon with a confrontation at this stage. That’s why he talked about continuing dialogue with Israelis on this issue"
Palestine,3daele,garmonboziamilkshake,3,Wed Jul 15 16:30:43 2015 UTC,Totally agree on the lip service.   I don't think Bush was the first president to give strong signs that the US had little stomach for a scrap about settlements. Or we wouldn't be here.

Palestine,3daele,garmonboziamilkshake,3,Wed Jul 15 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting to see them all in one place. I would still say this:   The entire settlement misadventure is one long exercise in plausible deniability.   Also applies to the US though. By which I mean if the underlying will from the US to enforce 1967 lines was really there I think the pattern of settlement growth would have been very different.   Case in point: at Oslo the US extracted no guarantees from Israel on settlements at all and the agreements only made mention of Palestinian autonomy, not state building. Rabin made clear he saw Israel keeping major settlement blocs and saw Israel's security border at the Jordan.  Edit: .. because settlement blocs were always intended to be kept and the rest were intended to be used as bargaining chips.  That was considered a groundbreaking moderate position twenty years ago, fully endorsed by 'honest broker' the US despite warnings from wonks in Israel and the US that further settlement growth would materially impact the viability of a future Palestinian state.   Edit: and as we know, eventually the raison d'etre for settlements took on a life of its own. In the early nineties, Rabin compared Likud to Hamas for their demand that Israel be river to sea. But by supporting Rabin, and then Likudnik governments afterwards while settlements have effectively moved to a claim over all or most of the West Bank, the US has been entirely complicit in the intractable mess of 'facts on the ground' that we have now and which Netanyahu explicitly promised he would bring about to torpedo Oslo. It's not like there wasn't warning.  If and when the papers are released it will be, in my view, as embarrassing as colonial era correspondence has been for Britain and France. It will probably show a wide disconnect between public statements of opposition and private acknowledgment of either acceptance or soft endorsement of settlements."
Palestine,3daele,MrBoonio,3,Thu Jul 16 09:33:50 2015 UTC,if the underlying will from the US to enforce 1967 lines was really there I think the pattern of settlement growth would have been very different.

Which will probably find that resistance to colonialisation is legal   It will find that targeting civilians as the Palestinians have done for 60 years is illegal. It will find that Hamas rockets are inherent war crimes. You happy with that? You OK with supporting war crimes?
Palestine,3czudr,tadab,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"Do you think that would help the Palestinians?    Suppression of crime helps everyone. Well, except the criminals, lets ignore them and get on with delivering justice and protection to everyone.   Do you want all Middle Eastern governments to be judged by courts or just Israel?

It will find that targeting civilians as the Palestinians have done for 60 years is illegal.    Good - then you've nothing to fear, have you? Will you support me calling for prosecutions in a Western court according to Western standards and Western laws?   It will find that Hamas rockets are inherent war crimes.

Palestine,3czudr,strike2867,0,Tue Jul 14 07:35:53 2015 UTC,"Palestinians should first suppress their own crimes.   International courts deal with International crimes.  Such crimes might include the mass-murder of 250 Palestinian policemen, but that's still some distance away. However, that's the kind of action that might draw the attention of an International court (and indeed, might make people think that extermination was intended).    Of a far court? Not at all.    Good - I understand your statement as saying that you have nothing to fear from a Western court and Western laws, and would support my call for prosecution of rocketeers.   Meanwhile of course it is and will still be the Palestinians who suffer. But you are willing to extend this 10 or 20 years as long as you get a court decision.   I want to see justice under Western Laws - how about you?   Your court, I am sure.   Israel begged to join the UN, sign the UN Charter (renounce the use of violence, except in clearly defined circumstances) and become subject to the International Court of Justice (also known as the ""World Court"").  Is Israel going to comply with the court that it begged to be subject to?"
Palestine,3czudr,AndyBea,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:07:59 2015 UTC,International courts deal with International crimes.   So you are fine with continuing to commit crimes.    I want to see justice under Western Laws - how about you?   I'd like to see a better life for the Palestinian people. How about you? You seem to think that continuing to commit crimes will be good for Palestinians and that somehow waiting for a court to rule will help the Palestinians. What exactly do you think a court is going to do to help?

Palestine,3cu34e,thisusernamesfree,6,Fri Jul 10 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"Huge threat.   Israel attributes its total political control of the issue in the US to its investment in controlling the debate on campuses.   BDS is two things:   a sign that its control is waning; worse, it is being challenged by an authentic and decentralised grassroots movement that has nothing like the funding of pro-Israel movements.  a precursor of Israel becoming a full blown and potentially toxic partisan issue that destroys the current structure of pro-Israel advocacy in the US.    Another issue is that aside campuses, the two other major and most visible stakeholders in BDS are:   liberal American Jews. Still a minority, but one doesn't need to elaborate on how damaging would be if/when synagogues and Jewish organisations no longer support Israel and come to see Israel as not in line with their values as American Jews. churches. We forget sometimes how powerful Christian Zionism is. While Christian Zionism has a long history, its current incarnation is really a marriage of social conservatives, southern evangelicals and republicanism. It is fundamentally a political movement (duh), which is why snake oil salesmen like John Hagee head it. More churches are backing away from Israel and exposing Christian Zionism as the political, rather than religious, movement it is."

Palestine,3cu34e,AndSoItIs9,2,Sun Jul 12 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"BDS is making Israel more radical.   Undoubtedly. It is pushing Israel to self-isolate.  Leaving aside for a moment that modern Israel has been through to major waves of Aliyah from Russia and the Middle East that already took it away from its western thinking, I don't think one can lay the blame for de-westernization at BDS when one looks at who is the growing political forces in Israel: haredi and religious nationalists.   Their growing influence dates back more than 20 years and predates BDS by some time.   but the Palestinians are going to suffer from that as much as the Israelis   Undoubtedly, in the short term. This was the exact debate black South Africans had among themselves during apartheid.   As for Palestinians now, they faced the same dilemma and divisions. But nobody seriously argues that sanctions didn't ultimately lead to a significant change in the status quo.   So yea, you get the joy of having the world by your side    That's an especially trite way of describing people's motivations and what is at stake here.   I'm really not sure it's the right path to take.   You can forgive Palestinians for being exceedingly cynical at Israeli warnings that they are taking the wrong path.  For twenty years, the only path on offer via Oslo has been, at best, a disjointed, not-very-sovereign state at the mercy of the whims of Israeli nationalists in the future. I could go into what an abject joke the negotiations were, with dishonest brokers and zero guarantees against settlement building, but we can save that.  Before that, there was no obvious path on offer. Violence isn't the answer. Peaceful protest has been useless. There is no meaningful diplomatic pressure to apply from any quarter. The only route left, short of bending over and taking the deal that an increasingly ungenerous Israel decides Palestinians shall get, is to harness the one thing Palestine has in abundance: popular support."

Israel de-westernize process is not a by-product of the BDS movement, for sure, but 100% product of the growing animosity towards Israel and Israelis in the West, combined with the moral preaching by those (Westerners) who actually robbed the world out of its goods and resources over the past 500 years and now, comfortably located in their sofa in their quiet established suburb flat, with their fizzy water and oreo cookies, preaching morals to the whole world, including Israel.

Amid the rubble of dozens of homes that the Israeli army continued yesterday to deny demolishing, the wrecking of the tiny, but only, zoo in the Gaza Strip took on potent symbolism for many of the newly homeless.  The butchered ostrich, the petrified kangaroo cowering in a basement corner, the tortoises crushed under the tank treads - all were held up as evidence of the pitiless nature of the Israeli occupation.

That, again, has nothing to do with how long or short they've been living in their homes. Expulsion of people from their homes do not support the basic idea of human rights, this already makes this guy an idiot.    Thirdly, you are factually and historically incorrect. Your historical knowledge seems to be limited and/or biased to support a narrative that you believe in. The ""facts"" you've mentioned about the 5,000 years genealogy, Israelites and what they've become are completely fabricated and aren't supported by any (renowned and unbiased) historical account.      Fourth, ""Europeans who call themselves Jews are simply Jews by name only, IMO."" What a terrible phrase. Your IMO equals to Huckabee's IMO.

Fair enough, but you cannot brush history with your anecdotal color, and claim that it's a fair representative of the past. It's not. Does it even matter today? not in my eyes, at least.

I agree with everything you said but the right of return. Many wrongdoings have been done and wasn't fixed, by Jews, by Arabs, to Jews and to Arabs, to Aboriginals in Australia, to Native Americans, to Africans. This world has seen so many land stealing, expulsions and ethnic cleansing, that if we wish to have a healthier global eco-system, a line has to be drawn to mark the beginning of a new era, leaving the past behind. I realize you won't agree with me (and even be angry) as you are, historically speaking, on the ""wrong"" side of this line, but reality has it that we are living in a unique era in terms of morality, and we can try and fix things for the first time in history. Someone is already living where your grandfather used to live. Someone is already living where my grandmother used to live in Poland. It was taken from her forcefully as well. However we both have homes now. I don't ask you to give up on your narrative, however I strongly believe we should take advantage of the uniqueness of this era.

The claims to the land and right to form a state by new Jewish immigrants were always specious even if every single one was a direct and provable descendant of those that lived there 2,000 years previously. We might as well all lay claim to Africa if a 2,000 year hiatus maintains the right of statehood.   The point I think, or hope, you are trying to make is that a rights-based model treating people equally that finds a home for Jewish Israelis within Palestine/Israel but which also addresses the dispossession of native Palestinians is the way forward.  Which it is.  And I find it hard to see past an integrated state in the long term, whatever the many flaws. I think anyone that talks about a demographic threat intuitively understands that too. If 70 years have proven anything - in sharp contrast to Huckabee's idiocy - it is that these mythical Palestinians have proven remarkably attached to the homes and land they once had.   I think the underlying challenge is one is actually one of wealth distribution. When push came to shove, integrating black and white South Africans under one nation was the easy bit. There were enough people prepared to give it a go from both sides and I don't see why the same is not true for Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinian Israelis have managed it, belying the dark threats of people who mask their own racism under the ideas of civilisation clash.  The far harder bit has proven to be how to meet the expectations of the majority of people who believed that the bargain was that they were trading peace for economic enfranchisement.  Get that wrong and you just swap legal apartheid for economic one."

Many things lifted the Ashkenazi immigrants into Palestine far above the economic conditions of the Sephardic immigrants. But an important influence was the compensation from Germany.  Well, the Palestinians are entitled to compensation for 10 times more years of suffering and death - that will quickly equalise the situation (subject to careful stewardship, admittedly).   Get that wrong and you just swap legal apartheid for economic one.   I don't think that's our problem.

With data we get closer to understanding and accountability. Still, it is a remarkable effort.  The most interesting part, perhaps, is that they can categorise casualty data into whether there was a warning or roof knock before the strike, whether there was a strike on first responders, and whether there is an IDF investigation.

I am not particularly biased towards either a one-state or two-state solution, though I think two states along 67 borders is more likely and would probably work out better for the time being.   I don't call myself 'anti-Zionist', because the notion that Zionism means the Nakba, ethnic cleansing, and settlements is a recent innovation. See Noam Chomsky for an example of an 'alter-Zionist', if you will - he takes a firm stance, one that many would call 'anti-Zionist,' against the actions of the State of Israel; still, he is a fan of the idea of Jews congregating in their ancient homeland and reviving their dormant traditions and culture. Nothing ever predicated Jewish nationbuilding in the Eretz Tzion on the execution of the Nakba and of all the other misdeeds Israel has committed. Whilst we were herded into gas chambers, we sang of our dreams to be a nation again. Most, I suspect, would have been saddened that the Zionist dream has led through to the denial of the right of self-determination to Palestinian Arabs.  It remains a fact that many Israeli politicians claim that there is no such thing as the Palestinian nation. Patently false. You don't need to have had a kingdom in 500 BC to count as a nation. When exactly the Palestinian Arabs began to form a nation in their own right rather than as a section of wider Arab culture may be up for debate, but that they are a nation is not.   As a Jew, I naturally feel hurt when people deny that my people exist, and with that in mind, I would consider it beyond unacceptable to subject another people to such claims."

Palestine,3cjx5j,FAREEQAWAL,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:58:50 2015 UTC,Wow.  This is a powerful and informative interview.  Thank you for bringing it to us.
Palestine,3cje83,Mintyhalls,2,Wed Jul 8 11:09:48 2015 UTC,"I saw this on Twitter last week. Love the directness of it. Its fair to point out though he may not always agree on Israeli methods and may even disagree on some, he did vote in favour in the massacre of Gaza last summer, which he did draw criticism for."
Palestine,3cje83,FAREEQAWAL,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:25:52 2015 UTC,"This is news to me,  but it checks out. The only counter point I can offer to this is that last year many Americans assumed from the stories of Hamas that Israel was justified and excused from anything they did, and even I myself thought this way. I don't think I heard anything to change this viewpoint until earlier this year."
Palestine,3cje83,Rocketdown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:16 2015 UTC,I know they're not one and the same but let's face the fact that most jews in government are zionist no matter how just they may seem on other issues.
Palestine,3cje83,bradzeilwashington,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, colour me genuinely shocked; I would definitely have thought Bernie Sanders might be on the right side of this issue."
Palestine,3chzwg,lebeardnekk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"Great article.  This is the problem with hasbara and slick talking points: it can't compete with articulate human voices.  This is a young, church-educated, articulate woman who wants to stay in Gaza because it's her home.  Enough said."
Palestine,3cew18,ruskeeblue,6,Tue Jul 7 11:06:07 2015 UTC,"Hillary Clinton would promise anything to anybody to get elected.  Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on most of her positions (and sometimes back again) depending upon which way the political winds happen to be blowing.  Hillary Clinton is desperate to lock up American Jewish votes and campaign donations because she's afraid that she'll lose them to Bernie Sanders - the man for whom I will be campaigning over the next year.  Hillary Clinton is not to be trusted - by the voters or by those who are backing her campaign.  And as the linked article stated quite clearly:  ""Clinton does not care that the Democratic base is deserting her on this issue.""  While I no more trust the insanely right-wing Frank Luntz any more than I trust Netanyahu, his poll carries some weight nonetheless."
Palestine,3cew18,WiseCynic,7,Tue Jul 7 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on most of her positions (and sometimes back again) depending upon which way the political winds happen to be blowing.   While true, this seems to be the only way a Democrat can get voted in since Reagan, such is the anathema of actually fixing the yawning social and foreign policy issues that have been growing for more than 30 years. The great irony being that Democrats, not Republicans, are the party of fiscal responsibility. Democrats have proven unable to redirect foreign policy in a meaningful way. Obama has been no less hawkish than Bush in his second term, Israel still gets its billions, Guantanamo still exists etc  The great problem with Clinton is that she's a technocrat. She has no grand vision because she is petrified of being cast as dogmatic or threatening. She has no unifying plan for enfranchising American voters, no strategy for how America plans for being one of two superpowers within a decade.  On a separate note, Haim Saban and Sheldon Adelson are almost written as if by their enemies. As Anshel Pfeffer noted last year:   ""It was like a scene out of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Two immensely wealthy Jews, key financiers of the main political parties of the world’s superpower, discussing how to wage war on the enemies of the Jews, and control the media and presidents.""   But no matter who they are or what pet cause they lobby for, the idea of future presidents defining their policy positions by the wishes of billionaire funders is grotesque. It is symptomatic of a deep malaise in campaign finance."
Palestine,3cew18,MrBoonio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"Sanders sucks on Israel too. The best you can say about him is that he wouldn't go anywhere politically without taking the stance he does, but that's exactly the argument you are making about Hillary."
Palestine,3cew18,robshookphoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:15:38 2015 UTC,Isn't Sanders very very pro-Israel?
Palestine,3cew18,thekeemoman,0,Tue Jul 7 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"People will disagree with that. While Sanders is not anti-Israel by any means, he is fair at pointing out ""over reactions"" on the actions of the Israeli government. Though Sanders may be a Polish Jewish descendant, Israel would rather see Clinton as the President than Sanders.  It is also very fair to point out that he was in favour of the massacre that Israel did in Gaza last summer, which did draw out some criticism."
Palestine,3cew18,FAREEQAWAL,0,Wed Jul 8 12:41:32 2015 UTC,"It is also very fair to point out that he was in favour of the massacre that Israel did in Gaza last summer, which did draw out some criticism.   Amazing how polite your tone gets when talking about Sanders. I've seen you tear others to pieces for taking that stance.  People who would disagree on Sanders' pro-Israel stance are simply wrong. He's bad on Palestine, and not great economically either. His policies are nationalistic and capitalist.   Now he may hold alternative views in his heart, but his POLICIES are not consistent with those. We are voting for policies, not for heart. That mistake was made with Obama and it would be nice for the left not to make it again."
Palestine,3cew18,robshookphoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:19:12 2015 UTC,So who are you going to vote for if you don't mind me asking.
Palestine,3cew18,thekeemoman,3,Wed Jul 8 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a Democrat, so I'll vote for Sanders in the primary. I'm sure Hillary will win, and I'll vote for Jill Stein or some other third party candidate (again) in the regular election. Were Bernie to win the democratic primary, I'd reconsider my vote then - at the moment I just don't consider him a serious candidate or a real socialist and can't be bothered to put any more time into it.  Voting doesn't matter - I choose whoever makes the biggest statement. BDS matters. Being in the streets matters. Supporting Palestinian resistance matters.  Apartheid would have come down no matter who was in office - their hand was forced by massive uprisings."
Palestine,3cew18,robshookphoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:55:04 2015 UTC,Well said!
Palestine,3cg2yt,FAREEQAWAL,3,Tue Jul 7 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent debate that demonstrates in plain english with what many Palestinians would like and what pro-Israeli nut jobs think we want and how they attempt to propagate the world with the nonsense of ""Destroying"" Israel and their other BS."
Palestine,3cg2yt,AndyBea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"Ali Abunimah is usually very impressive. But this is a severe let-down, he should have been able to make mincemeat to Jonathan Tobin.  I'd have wanted to know what borders it is that Israel is claiming and when they'll deliver on their very solemn promises to let the people back to their homes."
Palestine,3cg2yt,AndyBea,2,Wed Jul 8 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"In this case though AndyBea, I feel that letting Tobin spew his hasbara garbage, and literally putting words in Abunimah's mouth, which was pointed out was brilliant IMO. Abunimah, on several occasions and even the host challenged Tobin to give examples and Tibin basically got caught lying, trying to spew out more Hasbara. Any intelligent viewer can see that Tobin is a liar, plain and simple."
Palestine,3cg2yt,AndyBea,0,Wed Jul 8 13:51:54 2015 UTC,Norman Finkelstein made mincemeat of Alan Dershowitz in their debate here - http://www.democracynow.org/2003/9/24/scholar_norman_finkelstein_calls_professor_alan  Ali Abunimah should have had no difficulty doing the same and worse to Jonathan Tobin.
Palestine,3cg2yt,AndyBea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:13:09 2015 UTC,Great video...
Palestine,3cg2yt,AndyBea,0,Wed Jul 8 14:43:50 2015 UTC,Ali Abunimah writes brilliantly and has ample material to make a devastating debator.  Just a shame nobody's shown him how to use it.
Palestine,3cffju,FAREEQAWAL,3,Tue Jul 7 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"You know what peace looks like?  When the default positions of Israel's leaders to Palestinian resistance and violence - in all its forms - is not 'because they want to push us into the sea/hate Jews' or this ludicrous pretence that Palestinians just woke up one morning and decided to bomb Israel for no reason whatsoever.  Before the rockets were fired in June last year, the IDF rampaged through the West Bank and arrested hundreds of Hamas members and supporters. It killed five people. It destroyed several homes. It did this despite its own intelligence strongly indicating that the teens were dead. There are several sources now counting the many, sometimes fatal, ceasefire violations Israel is committing in its blockade of Gaza.  Whether one agrees with rocket fire or considers it moral or immoral not is besides the point. My issue here is the fiction or perpetual Palestinian original sin.  The wider issue is a longstanding willingness to pretend the occupation does not exist or is benign, and simultaneously subscribe to racist tropes about bloodthirsty natives to explain away any and all violence as a consequence of that occupation."

Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,-6,Wed Jul 8 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"It is up to Hamas and the people of Gaza to decide if there will be another conflict. Just like the last conflict, and the conflict before that."
Palestine,3cffju,MrBoonio,4,Tue Jul 7 16:30:34 2015 UTC,It is up to Hamas and the people of Gaza to decide if there will be another conflict.    Sure.   They created and subsequently razed the Warsaw Ghetto for 'security reasons' and then blamed the Jews for having temerity to resist.
Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Those in the Warsaw ghetto were not allowed to leave and move elsewhere, and food and supplies we're not sent it. Nor did the Warsaw ghetto have a border with a second country. Nor were any of the residents of the Warsaw ghetto from there, they had all had their home expropriated and been forced to live there.  Quite different from Gaza"
Palestine,3cffju,MrBoonio,4,Tue Jul 7 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"Quite different from Gaza   lol, you are delusional.   Gazans are free only within their open air prison. Any people ""permitted"" to leave for whatever reason was heavily reported on by Israeli media... Gee, I wonder why?  Food, and imports are strictly controlled down to the very calorie count. Export is next to impossible. Even with the Flotilla ships, which were intended to export materials FREE for the Gazans were commandeered by Israeli pirates. Homes, schools and hospitals were systematically blown up, and yes Gazans ARE forced to remain there."
Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,3,Tue Jul 7 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Those in the Warsaw ghetto were not allowed to leave and move elsewhere   Unlike Gazans, who take their summer holidays on the Amalfi Coast? Just a brief flight from Yasser Arafat Airport, you know?   and food and supplies we're not sent it   And you don't think Gazans lack for basic supplies? Do you know how many Gazans died of exposure last winter?   Nor did the Warsaw ghetto have a border with a second country.   Of course: Israel's only blockading Israeli access to Gaza. Well, that, and Gaza's international waters. And its airspace.  Egypt's blockade is entirely independent, of course.  It is also a massive coincidence that the Egyptian military dictatorship receives considerable support from Israel's major sponsor, the US government - worth billions in aid each year - as it has done every year since signing the Camp David Accords.   Nor were any of the residents of the Warsaw ghetto from there, they had all had their home expropriated and been forced to live there.   Perhaps you could read up on how many refugees have ended up in Gaza and where their homes were before making such a spectacularly ignorant comment.   Quite different from Gaza   There are differences, sure. It's the similarities that are striking though.  The victim blaming is a remarkable consistent between the two."
Palestine,3cffju,MrBoonio,3,Tue Jul 7 17:31:44 2015 UTC,The victim blaming is a remarkable consistent between the two.   This is all we needed to say starting off this conversation. Great point.
Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,7,Tue Jul 7 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Israel has been violating and bombing Gaza for years before last summer conflict, without provocations and in fact it was Hamas responding to Israeli shelling that caused the conflict last summer.  Since then Israel violates Gaza ceasefire nearly every day, so in other words, another bloodbath a-la-Israel is not a matter of if but, when."
Palestine,3cffju,MrBoonio,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:40:35 2015 UTC,The article is filled with blatant lies. It makes numerous claims as to what was in the ceasefire agreement that directly contradict all the public information about the agreement and then uses those fictional terms then accuses Israel of violating the agreement.   The full terms of the cease fire agreement were never made public.
Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,8,Tue Jul 7 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"The full terms of the cease fire agreement were never made public.    From the article, FFS:  ""The August ceasefire deal brokered by siege-enforcing Egypt, while never made transparent to the public, reportedly called for the opening of Gaza’s crossings, allowing the entry of reconstruction materials needed to rebuild Gaza’s devastated neighborhoods, the extension of the permitted fishing areas off Gaza’s shore and the relaxation of access restrictions in the areas along Gaza’s perimeter fence with Israel.   These truce conditions are similar to those that ended twelve days of Israeli bombing — claiming hundreds of Palestinian lives in Gaza — in November 2012.""   By all means if you have other details of what the ceasefire was then feel free to share them."
Palestine,3cffju,MrBoonio,-3,Tue Jul 7 17:16:42 2015 UTC,"That is what the article claims but no other articles or source verify those claims.  As we agree that the full terms of the ceasefire we're never made public, it is ludicrous for a party that was not member to that agreement to make claims that those terms have been violated."
Palestine,3cffju,Garet-Jax,5,Tue Jul 7 17:28:07 2015 UTC,That is what the article claims but no other articles or source verify those claims.   Apart from:   The Guardian The JPost   etc etc
Palestine,3cffju,AndyBea,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"So lets look at those three articles. Each section will start with what Electronic Intifada claims is a violation of the ceasefire agreement, followed by a comparison with the other sources.  All of these come from a section of the article with the header: ""Like its relentless violations of that earlier ceasefire, Israel has violated the August agreement with total impunity.  Here is a brief breakdown:""  EI claims: ""Exports are not allowed out of Gaza.""  Do either of the other articles claim that opening in the crossings to exports from Gaza was part of the deal? No.  EI Claims: ""Gaza remains sealed. While the Israeli closure of all of Gaza’s other crossings remains in place""  So is the crossing with Israel remained sealed? No  EI claims: ""Field observations suggest that areas within 100 meters from the fence are largely inaccessible""  Other sources say: ""Israel is expected to narrow the security buffer along the inside of the Gaza border, reducing it from 300 metres to 100 meters if the truce holds""    So maintaining a 100m zone is not a violation of the ceasefire.  EI claims: ""Meanwhile, access to fishing waters “is restricted to six nautical miles from the coast.”  Other sources provides: ""Israel will extend the fishing limit off Gaza's coast to six miles from three miles, with the possibility of widening it gradually if the truce holds""   So a six mile limit does not violate the truce.   The final claim in EI's summary: ""Construction materials are not allowed in to Gaza.""...""only one percent of the estimated five million tons of construction materials required have been allowed in to Gaza..""  Other sources say: There is no mention about the rate of transfer of materials. So nothing conclusive can be determined with regards to the ceasefire agreement.  Edit: Down-voting in place of rebuttal. Exactly what I expected."
Palestine,3cffju,TotesMessenger,2,Tue Jul 7 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Do either of the other articles claim that opening in the crossings to exports from Gaza was part of the deal?   The conditions were the same as before, namely:   ""Opening the crossings and facilitating the movement of people and transfer of goods and refraining from restricting residents' free movements and targeting residents in border areas. Procedures of implementation shall be dealt with after 24 hours from the start of the ceasefire.""   I'm not going to bother crawling through the rest of your dreck if you can't do your own research properly."
Palestine,3ce80t,MrBoonio,0,Tue Jul 7 05:44:27 2015 UTC,Sad business that only men were able to attend.  Nor is it the case that this is a special for Gaza - such an event has been funded in at least 36 other countries before it reached the real suffering Muslims.
