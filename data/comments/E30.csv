E30,3e5ovw,WolfishWolf,2,Wed Jul 22 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how strong you feel the car is. Mine has 238,000 on it and I still rev it out to the limiter daily. M42s are very strong engines but it all depends on how comfortable you feel pushing it."

E30,3e5ovw,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Jul 22 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"Where in the world are you? If it's a 318i with a speedo using kilometres, it may have the feeble M40 engine instead of the robust M42 engine.  If you do have an M40, the fact that you can rev to 5000 is a good sign, as many of these engines cannot do this any more due to severely worn camshafts."
E30,3e5ovw,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:30:10 2015 UTC,Canada. It is definitely an M42. It looks exactly like this: http://www.e30zone.net/e30zonewiki/images/9/94/M42B18_Engine.jpg
E30,3e5ovw,xcerj61,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"In which case you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Just make sure your chain tensioner is fairly new, and that the sump bolts (upper and lower) haven't come loose, as you don't want to the chain to slacken or to suck in air if you're reguarly revving the car that high.  16v engines are usually rev-happy, so if you've got it you might as well use it. E30s aren't built to be driven by grandmothers."

E30,3e44xu,Narek_S,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:55:08 2015 UTC,Probably an M40 not an M42 as that was put in later models like the 318is. Not certain though. Maybe even an M10?
E30,3e44xu,mygfcallsmetree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"If you want it as a driver, it'd be alright. If you wanted it to make fast, the M10 cars are not good places to start. I know the 84/85 North American 318i's used different sized strut inserts in the front (45mm diameter inserts) as well as drums in the rear. The only way to use the later 318is or 325 suspension goodies (51mm diameter inserts) or convert to disc brakes in the rear was to swap that gear out from a 325i making the 318i's poor places to start for a performance oriented build. Now, this car might have the goods, check that.   Looks very clean though. Make a nice more or less bulletproof driver (that will get bad fuel economy)."
E30,3e4wan,Inter_instadent,3,Tue Jul 21 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"Timing belt, water pump, pretty much every rubber hose and bushing, brake fluid, oil change, new alternator/ac/power steering pump belt (because they're probably hard as rocks), tires (because they're probably also hard as shit), trans/diff fluid and probably coolant for good measure (and while I'm in there i'd probably do a thermostat too).   Oh and I wouldn't bother with the power steering fluid because it'll just piss out on your maiden voyage anyway."

E30,3e4wan,karmat0se,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:10 2015 UTC,Do you have some sort of estimate on how much that would cost? There are limits to my ability in the mechanic department. Not sure if it would be able to do a timing belt. I don't have a huge limit on budget cause time is not much of a factor. Also what would be better to take to a mechanic for?
E30,3e4wan,karmat0se,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"I have no idea on costs because I do all my work myself. I also have no idea what mechanic rates are like in your area. But, most of that is easy to diy. I'd probably have a mechanic do the tbelt, waterpump and thermostat. Shouldn't be more than a couple hours of shop time for a competent mechanic.   But if you are going to own an E30, you should probably at least own a basic screwdriver/metric socket/wrench set because having to have someone do all your work for you will bleed you dry. Especially if you're getting into one that's been sitting for a while. R3vlimited and e30tech are great resources that can pretty much hold your hand through any maintenance or mod you can think of. Working on these cars is very simple."

E30,3e4wan,Audiontoxication,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"No problemmo. I'd probably start looking at howtos on replacing the rear subframe bushings and trailing arm bushings. If the car is squirley when you get it, chances are those items will need replacing."
E30,3e2fxl,TheeOAB,4,Tue Jul 21 13:08:00 2015 UTC,"The anti-theft device can be defeated in seconds if you need to confirm that the engine runs. However, if it's been stood for a year then you shouldn't even attempt to crank the engine over without replacing the timing belt first, which generally means throwing a full service at it.  So decide whether you can afford $500 + $450 + $500 for a throrough service."
E30,3e2fxl,Grrrmachine,3,Tue Jul 21 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Do you need to rely on it? If yes, I wouldn't buy it. If you can get by day to day should your car die (and it will until you get all the gremlins out of it from sitting) It might be a good purchase if the body is in good shape. Also, if it's an automatic your fuel economy will be terrible. My E34 with M20B25/Autotragic gets about 14L/100KM.  /u/beefcakez has it right though. Don't pay that tow fee. Rent a truck and tow it yourself. If you go the Uhaul route, tell 'em your towing a FWD shitbox or they'll freak out and not want to rent you a dolly.

Then I had to tell them neither car had a driveshaft in it, yada yada yada. I ended up going back with my dad and having him tell them I'm towing a god damn Ford Escort because they wouldn't believe me. This was a Uhaul corporate location, not a franchise location. That might have had something to do with it."

E30,3e2fxl,ajleece,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:08:14 2015 UTC,I'd do an OBD1 conversion. I have a lot of bibs and bobs kicking around here from an M50 swap that didn't get off the ground when I was building my E30. TRM has an off the shelf tune for the 413 DME and Seattle Circuit makes a dohickey that will allow VANOS to work. It all comes down to how much money I want to spend.
E30,3e2fxl,karmat0se,2,Wed Jul 22 12:02:26 2015 UTC,can you go pick it up and save $450?

E30,3e2fxl,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"I believe you can reset the anti theft by unhooking the battery for 5 minutes (or longer, I'd let it sit for an hour). That's the stock unit.   I had an aftermarket one installed by the PO and found out that if I unhooked the battery, put the key and turned it 'on' without starting it, then hooked up the battery it would reset it.    The body is solid and in really good condition, although the paint is faded. The interior is close to perfect, except for the dash being cracked and the radio being missing.   If it's single stage paint, it can be buffed out. I believe metallics were two stage, but colors like Alpine white and Hellrot (sp?) and others were single stage.   As if it's a wise decision? Dunno, man. I have no knowledge of your financial situation.I think the base price is okay. However that towing fee is ludicrous. I wouldn't pay $1k for a car that doesn't run. See if you can borrow a friends truck and a trailor, or at least a truck. A UHaul trailer costs way less than that. Get a couple friends to come along and help you push it on."
E30,3e2fxl,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:50 2015 UTC,I have the money for it. It would be my first car. I would have to search around to try to find another option for towing it.
E30,3e2bay,Redlineraid,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:24 2015 UTC,"Ok well here is my thought.  The main relay powers the whole ABS module It's a red/yellow wire that comes off of the main relay. The main relay is in front of your driver's front shock tower near the coolant res (assuming late model). I believe it's the lower of the 3 relays in this set. It's the only 5 prong relay in the bunch. The other two are O2 and fuel pump FYI.  Regardless, here is the layout for the abs wiring. As you can see, it powers both the ABS control unit and the ABS hydraulic unit. Without power, both systems will not function.  I don't think there are any redundant systems that will freak out if you turn it off but maybe test it off first before you do anything. We are messing with the brakes here.   IMO. I'd run a relay for this. Pull some minor current from somewhere else to a switch and trip a relay that links this wire into the circuit. I don't know how many amps it draws and I don't like the idea of faulty wiring in the engine bay.  I would use a relay that is on until powered, then it turns off. Then have your switch on a power feed that is only on when the car is running. That way, if your switch wiring goes bad for any reason, abs will be on and not off. Relay reading if you're interested  Course I'm one to talk. I have my abs system totally disabled."
E30,3e2bay,protomor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:51 2015 UTC,"I've got some free time tomorrow to have good look at all of this info More in depth and gather a correct understanding. I've got to do some other minor work on the car aswell! But what you're saying seems right too me, I'm not the best at wiring. I can solder and correctly wrap wires to ensure no earth leaks or short occurs! But I didn't want to take the risk with brakes without asking around!"
E30,3e2bay,protomor,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"The short way to deal with this (if you're SUPER lazy) and want to verify what I said. Basically, cut that red/yellow wire, and tape it up so it doesn't contact anything. Then go drive around and see if it made any difference. Maybe find some dirt and slam on the brakes to see if the abs is truly disabled.   I've only seen the ABS work on 2 E30s so yours might not even be working to begin with. Which makes this all moot so try to verify it works first?"

Doesnt blow smoke, destroys everything in its path, starts every time. I kick the shit out of it too. Double your budget, do it right or kick yourself later! If you've got the dough get a built head from bimmerheads (i love mine). Dont listen to the naysayers. Ive got 5 buddies with m50/52 turbo cars and they're all not running now haha. Im the only one still going. Install is pretty simple and if your handy on the tools you can be done in a weekend. The most time consuming factor will be waiting on parts. DO NOT SKIMP ON TUNING, its the single most important thing of any build. Ive seen immaculate, very expensive builds blow the fuck up from shitty canned tunes and Ive seen ghetto builds last forever with a proper one.

I have no experiences with my own turbos, and I never managed to write a guide because there doesn't seem to be a confirmed reliable way to fit a turbo to an M20. Almost every project I've seen (that has documentation) is a non-stop process of fabrication, fettling and bottom-end rebuilds.  If anyone's got a link to a good turbo write-up, I'd love to see it."

E30,3dwj0f,RackedE30,7,Mon Jul 20 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a dick but this is wildly inaccurate. Even you yourself say you have no experience with turbos, so why post this? All you are doing is spreading misinformation.   There are plenty of ways to reliably fit a turbo to an E30. If you do the setup right it can go quickly and not take you very long at all.    You do not need a brake upgrade. I daily drive a 400whp E30 with stock brakes. More HP does not require better brakes, only faster stops from high speed. If you don't drive like an asshole the stock brakes are fine.  Turbo cooling system, what is that? Do you mean an inter cooler for the charge air? Do you mean oil supply to the turbo? You can run the stock ignition system up to mid boost with no issues at all  if you run with an engine management system it will have a MAP sensor built in 90% of the time, you will not need a MAF I was able to complete my first turbo e30 build in 3 weekends with full engine management and exhaust. Even with less experience 6 months is an insane amount of time.  People push moderate power on stock bottom ends with no issues for years. I am one of those people.    OP please do some more research like the e30tech link provided and disregard the parent post."
E30,3dwj0f,MattPro,0,Mon Jul 20 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate your post, I can't help but approach it with some skepticism.   More than doubling the power and torque of the already tail-happy E30 without addressing the brakes is seriously inadvisable, especially if you want to drive the car with any enthusiasm (which I would assume someone doing a turbo build would be doing). The fact that you do so doesn't fill me with much confidence. The vast majority of products (and therefore technical solutions) mentioned in the E30Tech thread are not available outside the US, and as such you either pay double to get them shipped or you have to do a lot more of your own fabrication. Add to this the unique problems of a RHD installation, and a lot of info in the thread becomes unuseable beyond the theoretical. Forgive me, but 3 weekends to fit a turbo sounds as wildly inaccurate as 6 months. Did you not encounter a single broken manifold stud? Was the engine management somehow in tune as soon as you fitted it all together? How many extra pairs of hands did you have helping you out? Whether you use MAP or MAF is really just a niggling point; it's still a chunk of cash you have to add to the price list, which is what OP asked about. As for the durability of the existing components (bottom end, ignition etc) - sure, some people run a moderate (how much is that?) amount of boost for long periods at a time with no issues. Others experience serious issues in a few thousand miles, such as the original engine in the E30Tech link. Considering the youngest M20 is 24 years old, it's impossible to say whether OP's particular engine has been maintained well enough to cope with the sort of stresses FI create. Telling him that there is no issue with boost when he's about to spunk over $6000 in parts is very unfair, considering it's not you who has to pick up the pieces if something does fail.   I do implore the OP to do more research on this matter; it may be easier to fit a turbo than I originally described, but I strongly doubt it will be as easy as you describe."
E30,3dwj0f,Grrrmachine,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day I have successfully built 3 turbo E30s from scratch and many more non-turbo builds. You claim yourself to have no experience. No matter what your intentions are without having any experience all you have is hunches. Everything I'm saying is backed by real world direct experience. That doesn't mean I'm right, but I just want others to keep these facts in mind when reading this thread.    On street conditions, HP and TQ don't really change your braking ability. The brakes aren't working to slow your acceleration, they are working to reduce your speed. If you drive like a madman and floor your car after every stop and are forced to mash the brakes in then yes, your brakes will suffer as their heat increases because you can reach high speeds faster. If you drive to the same speeds you do now you won't notice a difference at all. But I have DD turbo e30s on the street for 3+ years now on stock brakes. I'm not hitting 120 on side streets and mashing on the brakes though. Like I said, my current E30 made over 400 at the rear wheels and I have never had a scary incident on the street once.  RHD does make things a lot more complicated. And yes shipping time and cost does factor into that. You should take to a local shop and ask them what modifying a manifold would run you to get a good idea of what those costs may be. E30s are a huge platform though and I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have built RHD M20 turbos so do more research into what manifolds they use.  3 weekends and the car was driving, plus the next two weekends of making small adjustments and tweaks. Tuning an aftermarket EMS is not that difficult with the amount of base maps and information available for the M20 platform. Getting it dialed in will take time but making a car drivable is not difficult at all. If you have mechanical experience it is not that big of an issue to deal with the problems that come up like broken bolts.  $6k worth of parts? Once again you're pulling numbers out of air. Seriously, most people who boost E30s happily run 12psi on stock engines for many thousands of miles. Some people build and push much higher than that. Not every person out there wants to build a 700WHP 1/4 mile monster.    I understand you've done a lot of research but a lot of what you are saying is not accurate. OP please read more turbo M20 build threads and question threads and you will get a better idea of what you're in for."

I replaced the rear valance entirely which was a total pain in the neck, and I modified the battery box a little such that the battery bracket now slides down onto 3 vertical bolts and is held down by nuts.  This mod allows me to remove everything from the battery well should I need to clean it out.  Another place you will find rust is where there exhaust shield attaches to the frame.  The shield is aluminum, the car is steel, this forces the steel metal into galvanic corrosion.  Dealing with this is on my short list.  I plan to use a pot blaster and black aluminum oxide to spot treat the rusted exhaust bolt to frame areas and then weld build to fill the dime sized hols."

One more day of work and it should be finished.   The battery bracket will need to get blasted with aluminum oxide to clean up the rust pitting.

E30,3duotp,CutlassSupremo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"I've been looking into MIG brazing to join panels together. It's done in body shops and is pretty much perfect for the body work you and I are doing.   It flows at 1000 deg C (unlike regular mig wire which melts at 1600 C) so it doesn't melt the base metal.   If you already have a mig setup with argon, you can simply put in the bronze/silicone wire and you're good to go, afaik."
E30,3duotp,CutlassSupremo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:56:45 2015 UTC,"Bronze is the filler metal of choice for body shops. The tail pannel on my car had been replaced once before by a previous owner, but they did a lousy job of sealing the metal so it rusted in nearly the same places where you have issues on your car.   In my opinion, it makes little difference what joining technique you use on this panel because there will definitely be fitment issues and you will reach for the body hammer to give it some persuasion.  I've compared my work with an untouched e30 and, to be honest, BMW did a so-so job joining this piece with the rest of the car from the factory.  The bumper hides most of the panel anyways. The lower skirt is covered by stoneguard material which hides most of the seam.  The only seam that really shows is the portion below the tail lamps, above the bumper.   The trunk drip rail transition pieces, which are those triangular pieces above the tail lamps in the aft trunk corners, joining the tailpanel with the rear quarter panels, are made of a thinner sheet metal than the rest of the car. In factory form, these pieces are absolutely covered in seam sealer. And it doesn't really matter anyway because when the trunk is closed, you can't see them.  If you replace the tail pannel, plan on fabing up new transition pieces because the originals will likely get mangled.  Working on this car has taught me a great deal about welding and metal fab. It's almost equal parts education as it is a desire to have a cool car again....although, I am getting sick of working on this bastard and really want to finish this year.  Victory is when thus thing moves on its own again.  I'm not going to tear into this car again unless I have the replacement parts at hand.  Mechanical work is so much more enjoyable than body work, IMHO."

E30,3dvqap,AggressiveTuna,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:00 2015 UTC,They're ix's not xi's. I owned one.  I finally got rid of it.  They're cool and all but they are a fucking pain to work on though.  That also means that it's expensive to pay someone to work on them.  Either way that's a factor to consider. Prepare to pull apart the entire car should you need to remove your oil pan.    Unless you're dead set on an ix I'd suggest that you find a different e30 for a first e30 as it might spoil e30s for you.  May not be what's popular but it's a voice of experience.
E30,3dvqap,rustede30,2,Mon Jul 20 06:35:47 2015 UTC,I have to agree. My first and current e30 is my 89 325ix and although i love it to death despite its many cosmetic flaws I really have to say its probably not the best first e30 its gunna cost a little more there are quite a few model specific parts and with only a limited amount imported (in the us/canada) some of these parts can be really hard to find. Also the transfer case for the awd can only handle around 200hp from what i hear and its one of the pricier parts and generally not worth it. Engine swap will be nigh impossible without some pretty extreme mechanical work and possibly engineering. So pretty much what im saying is the ix is wonderful in the snow and looks great standing out from most e30s (with the fender flares and higher ride hight) but can be an absolute pain. Pretty much decide if you want a snow car or an e30 then decide if you want the struggle of both because your ix will never be fast and could cost you more than its worth and personally im 100% ok with that
E30,3dvqap,325ix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just sold an m3, speed isnt what I'm looking for at all, just as long as it is as fun to drive as it looks like it is. I wouldn't be doing any engine mod, so extra stress on the transfer case shouldn't be an issue.  I need a snow car, can't get around that, and would love to stay in the BMW family. Are they just not worth the money at high miles because of the difficult work/parts?"
E30,3dvqap,325ix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:02 2015 UTC,Its very fun to drive in my opinion. And as far as the high miles go I'm really not sure because ive only ever owned the one its just that higher miles mean higher chances of problems. I think the cost of parts isnt all that bad but i do all the work on mine but i can only imagine the cost of labor with there being a very high chance of a fix being something they've never done before requiring them to spend more time on it. Be sure to check out the ix registry its a little out dated because its from the 90's but its a newsletter a guy made for NA ix owners and has a lot of good info. Something different is probably a safer bet but it will never be an awd snow conquering e30  Ps good tires can make this car go from great to amazing
E30,3dvqap,protomor,2,Tue Jul 21 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"google for the ""jack test"" to verify the awd system is still working. Otherwise, it's just like any other M20 powered E30. Check for trunk/battery tray rust and rocker panel rust. If you want to be thorough, check for rust on the driver/passenger footwell near the drive tunnel. I've noticed them rusting quite frequently where the unibody frame meets the chassis."

It's a really primitive technology to start with, and the M40 is really not the sort of engine that will give you any gains whatsoever from using them. That lump was built for economy, not speed, and however much you throw at it will never give you the power of an M42, let alone a decent M20B25. In essence, the reason you got the engine for free is because the M40 is an unloveable piece of shit.  If you really want to mess around with fettling jets every sunday and fucking around with choke cables, then drop an M10 in; there's a million and one aftermarket parts for that lump that will give you the sort of rorty four-pot you're lusting for."

And, the guy I'm building it with and his dad have close to 75 years of building experience and both think that this path is viable And as for mucking around with carbys, my mate's got webers in his 02' with a m10 and his dad has been building formula ford engines for 25 years and has a fair idea on tuning them"

If you insist on upgrading but dont want to spend the crazy amounts of money on aftermarket you can get the front vert sway bar. It is just a tad bid thicker than the i model sways.

E30,3dtu3a,jj_autobody,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"I currently don't run a front or rear sway bar. lulz.   Links should be full spherical if possible. Otherwise, factory front links work fine. Rears have bushings so they tend to flex too much.   Plus sway bar advice isn't useful without knowing the rest of your setup and the purpose of the car. Most race cars have small sway bars and stiffer springs. Unless you're off roading. In which case, it's reverse of that."

I was told I could go under it and look but never got around to it.  I like the idea of beating the hell out of it until I find the right one.  It's a fun car even with it's issues.  Once I'm rolling it just feels special.  Even if the thing blew up I'd be content with the $750 I put into it just because of the fun I had in it.  If it doesn't blow up by the time I find the right one I can steal some of the goodies off of it that I'd want and part out the rest of it.
E30,3dk3w3,Narek_S,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:58 2015 UTC,It should be a 3.73 LSD.

E30,3dgo3h,Dzdimi14,3,Thu Jul 16 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"It's just your power wires, antenna wire, power antenna wire, and speaker cables. They're all going to be there. Just mark which wires go where on the head unit and reattach them to the new one.   Installing a head unit really isn't that hard. If you can wire a Christmas tree, you can probably do a head unit."
E30,3dgo3h,rainy0days,2,Thu Jul 16 09:12:09 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have a problem putting any standard size radio in the car.  The slot in the dash for the radio is generally know as single-DIN opening.  It's a worldwide, standardized opening that many, but not all, cars use.  Almost universally, every single aftermarket head unit made uses the standard in either a single or double DIN size with single DIN easily being the most common.  Many modern cars don't use it for stock head units, but there are adaptor kits for almost any make/model out there.  Fortunately, for us and our E30s, the DIN standard was created in the early 80s by the German standards group Deutsches Institut für Normung (hence The DIN acronym).  BMW was one of the first manufacturers to adopt it and still used it at least through the 2000s E46. In '84 the International Standards Organization (ISO) selected it as a global standard.  This is the same organization that defines things like USB, CD, DVD, BluRay, electrical outlet, light bulb, data cable connectors, HDMI, tire valve stems, and thousands of other things to ensure worldwide/regional compatibility.  They basically keep the world working on the same page.  Long story, short: any standard size aftermarket head unit should fit in an e30 without issue.  The stock radio was installed in a globally standardized opening that is still used by nearly every manufacturer of head units.    Just look for a radio that is labeled as a single-DIN and you shouldn't have any problems.  Stock e30 radios are fed through the left/right equalizer dial above the radio with the hazards and rear defroster buttons.  You usually have to bypass this, but if you have an aftermarket radio installed, it's already been done.      It really is as simple as just connecting all the wires on the unit to the correct wires in the dash.  The colors probably won't match between them, but the radio will come with a diagram of what each wire does.  An e30 wiring diagram that identifies the wires in the dash is a simple Google search away.  Just cross reference the two diagrams and wire it up.  The radios manual will tell you how to connect the power antennae, and it's just one more wire. It might take you a few hours, but it's not hard at all.    I tend to ramble.  Sorry."

E30,3dfk6j,deject3d,2,Thu Jul 16 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"I run 16x9 on mine and my car's very low and I hardly rub, but my rear is rolled a little.

E30,3dfk6j,Narek_S,2,Thu Jul 16 09:09:36 2015 UTC,"8 is probably the widest you want to go as far as width, and you can get away with a 225 tire if you roll your fenders.   The hardest part about finding wheels for an E30 is getting the correct offset and center bore. Both can be fixed with spacers and rings, though you want to avoid them if you can.   For reference, I use 16x7.5 et20 wheels with a 205/50(I think) tire. Zero rubbing on H&R's."
E30,3dfk6j,rainy0days,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:30:00 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with spacers, I run them up front to clear my coilovers. Only problem with them is they make it harder to put the wheel back on haha since e30s are lug bolts and not lug nuts (stupid design)."
E30,3dfk6j,Narek_S,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"They can work fine, but it's better to avoid them if you can. Slip ons mean you'll be getting less thread engagement from the stock lug bolts, and it can also make it harder for the wheel to center. And bolt on spacers are literally just bolting on unsprung weight and complications. It makes life so much easier to just get a set of wheels that fit correctly from the get go.   On a separate but related topic, you should look into converting to studs. I got an extended bullet nose set from Motorsports Hardware that have changed my life."

Undo the prop from the diff end first, but dont pull it off the studs. Then undo it from the centre bearing, then the gearbox.  When refitting, make sure you fit a new rubber guibo (which must be fitted the right way round) as well as a new centre bearing, which needs to be pre-loaded when you fit the shaft."

E30,3dc0d2,protomor,3,Wed Jul 15 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"It used to be. M30's are pretty sweet. Never ending torque band, raw simplicity just like the M20, and darn near bulletproof.   M5x/S5x engines are plentiful and are cheap to upgrade due to lots of aftermarket support. Pretty darn easy to intermix parts and get high horsepower out of them too. I.e M52 block & rods + M54 crank & Pistons = 3.1L stroker  Also, M5x engines get great gas mileage compared to the M20 and M30. Gas mileage of a stock m50 is around 29 mpg at 190 hp.   However, I love the simplicity of the M20 and M30.   Edit: Check out this response from /u/protomor on why it's not done more often:  https://www.reddit.com/r/E30/comments/3das7s/opinions_on_the_m30_swap/ct3i79n"
E30,3dc0d2,CutlassSupremo,2,Wed Jul 15 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"True that.  Now that I think about it, 10 or 12 years back the M30 was the go-to motor swap.  M50 swaps were rare, and S5x swaps were even more so.  One guy on the forum i frequented had a euro S52 with 332is badging and everyone fawned over it like it was something super special, which it was at the time.  Nowadays, as the late model E36s and all E46s age the motors are much more plentiful.  An M50 is essentially just an M20 with 24v and VANOS (only on post '98 motors iirc).  I think the MPG gain was mostly from the VANOS letting you keep the RPMs low.  But it does come with the price of increased complexity.  My '99 e46 was plagued with problems with the head.  During the last 2 years I had it parts of the VANOS system kept failing and was only functional for half that time, off and on as I replaced stuff.  I could be wrong, but I recall that someone did manage to fabricate a single custom 24v head for an m20, but it never made it into a car.    Edit: Here we are!

E30,3das7s,brice_v,5,Wed Jul 15 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"i have an m30 swap with 10,000+ miles on the build. I built it, no shop touched it in the process.  weight? unnoticeable. which goes to answer the handling issue, handling is hardly affected. You WILL need stiffer springs.  torque? gobs and gobs of it.  power? not that powerful. you want more horses go s5X  here's where the flaws lie with the m30: gas mileage is absolutely horrible. you need more fabricating/custom parts to make it work. driveshaft, motor mounts, exhaust."
E30,3das7s,single-needle,3,Tue Jul 14 23:12:36 2015 UTC,"Two downsides of the m30. Weight, and efficiency. They sound great and tend to be reliable, but I just don't see the appeal."
E30,3das7s,messier_is_ok,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:02 2015 UTC,M30s are heavy but have torque. They hang way over the front axle so they kill handling. You'll need lots of custom parts like motor mounts and a drive shaft while an M50 swap only needs parts you can get from the factory (unless you stick with the factory trans). It's also much easier to work on and much better power to weight ratio and much better after market.  The M30 barely fits in the car and will be more likely to have heating issues than an M50 (though those have it too).   Why do you want an M30? It's not that much more powerful than an M20. It has a bit more low end grunt but it's so damn heavy and doesn't have much top end.  You want torque? Go V8 :)

While I absolutely love my e30 it's not meant for winter and especially not Colorado winters. there is the 325ix that had all wheel drive, that model is special and has a bunch of unique parts not on any other e30 (plus I hated the way the awd worked on the ix I had).  On the tuning side, it is cheaper and easier to do up a Wrx then a e30.

E30,3d5lr0,drumsripdrummer,3,Mon Jul 13 18:31:06 2015 UTC,Realistically about 500+ dollars aka a 1/4 of the cost of the car. Swaps always seem do able until you get into little particular things. Check out r3v there are a ton of swap threads and many talk about the frustration of finding parts.
E30,3d5lr0,Clean_Send,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:28 2015 UTC,$2100 still seems like a decent deal to me. At least transmissions are an easy prospect on E30s.  Except that top bolt and the starter bolts. Fuck those bolts.
E30,3d5lr0,Deltigre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"I've never dealt with anything as big as a transmission swap, swapping starter/alternator, spark plugs, brake pads, basic kind of stuff. But I've heard there's a really really good community around e30s, and with it being a weekend car and being modestly smart, I think I could figure it out.  If that car I linked were a stick, what would you think a fair price is?"
E30,3d5lr0,Deltigre,3,Mon Jul 13 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell without miles and clearer pictures, honestly. It looks a little run down, but I'd expect at least $2500 with a manual this side of the state (I'm in the Seattle area).  I recently swapped a transmission with less miles in my car. The transmission is really stupid simple. Hardest part to ""figure out"" is dropping the driveshaft. Top bolts I'm complaining about are just hard to get to. I had to tip the engine with a jack and use 2 feet of extensions and a u-joint to get the socket on them. A helper is a big plus, I had somebody help get the starter back in my car, since it wouldn't stay in place for threading the bolts.  Obviously with an auto->manual swap there are accessories (like that pesky third pedal) that need to be installed in the car too."
E30,3d5lr0,Clean_Send,2,Mon Jul 13 20:59:06 2015 UTC,Those are the things that kind of get annoying. For a swap generally in my experience is you have to collect parts over a period of time. Rarely will you find someone selling everything for a clean swap and if by chance they are you'll be paying top dollar for their efforts. It's really up to you on how much time and money you want to spend in relation to how fast you want a running car.

E30,3d3ymz,Grrrmachine,2,Mon Jul 13 13:34:21 2015 UTC,"I wrote the guide you linked to. Remember that the Zone is a UK-based site, so things like steering linkages and exhaust manifolds are more critical issues for that market, since they're on the same side of the car.   As for the rest, ithe parts list is a comprehensive approach to doing the swap properly. You can cut corners, but you'll be left with a bodgejob.  As for running your engine on three cylinders - I'm sorry, but that's nothing short of dangerous. If you've broken something in the valvetrain then there's a very real risk of parts getting into the other three cylinders and killing them in a short amount of time, leaving you utterly stranded. If you've broken something in the bottom end then the imbalance will cause increased wear and stresses that may lead to catastrophic failure. Even without those, the other three cylinders are having to carry the parasitic weight of a dead piston, meaning your original 100+ hp is now somewhere around 60, not including drivetrain losses.  Without identifying the root cause of the dead cylinder, I wouldn't drive that car an inch."

E30,3cyzot,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,6,Sun Jul 12 06:26:20 2015 UTC,I got so fed up with mine I ripped out all the wiring for both wear sensors and removed the bulb from the cluster.
E30,3cyzot,Frizkie,3,Sun Jul 12 08:38:20 2015 UTC,I pulled the bulb as well.  I don't need a light to tell me when my brakes are worn.  I can feel and hear it just fine.  You can also just wire the two ends of the sensor together.
E30,3cyzot,Twaletta,2,Mon Jul 13 20:41:42 2015 UTC,Yes! The sensor was wrapped in the caliper. I noticed it when I changed the hubs and it was weird. But brakes are alright!
E30,3cyzot,Dzdimi14,2,Sun Jul 12 06:37:00 2015 UTC,"haha yea, I just stopped bothering about them."
E30,3cyzot,13515m0r3,2,Sun Jul 12 08:02:27 2015 UTC,It's a cold solder joint in the dash. The sensors have nothing to do with it. Try it by just testing the circuit. Doesn't matter what continuity it'll stay on in my experience.

I couldn't pass this up. 1986 E30 coupe with manual transmission and a m20. Clean title, and runs (kind of) for $100. I drove 4 hours there and back and towed it back home.  It was listed on craigslist, but in antiques! Only reason it wasn't gone.  I know it's rough but I thought this would be a good first project. Worst case, I salvage what I want and sell the rest.  I plan on learning everything with this car. I'm handy but never did big jobs before. Planning on restoring the car."
E30,3cz2la,hbrewitt,3,Sun Jul 12 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"Seats alone are worth more than $100. Good buy, and good luck with it. It should be a nice little project."
E30,3cz2la,Grrrmachine,2,Sun Jul 12 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"You got your money's worth, but I really wouldn't plan on salvaging that shell unless you really know your bodywork. You need a new rear quarter and rear valance for starters, and that's before you find the inevitable hidden rust spots.

E30,3cz2la,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's the plan. I'll try some body work for learning, but I don't plan on  pouring a ton of money into it."

E30,3czfc3,tokeonthis,3,Sun Jul 12 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"Immediately check the four bolts holding the differential to the subframe. These can work loose over time, leading to knocking.  It can also be ruined subframe bushes, a worn U-joint, a loose driveshaft bearing or simply tired exhaust hangers causing your rear silencer to knock against floorpan."
E30,3czfc3,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"CV joints could also do it, though usually you'll hear a rhythmic metallic ding that goes up and down with speed, as well as a knock when shifting/over bumps.  Maybe OP could give a little more detail as to the how/when.  A knocking in the rear could be any number of things."
E30,3czfc3,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"It's pretty constant, more like a rhythmic hammering but does get slightly faster the faster I got and when I slow down, it too, gets slower and almost goes away once I press the clutch. Thanks to /u/Grrrmachine, i'm thinking it's the rear subframe bushes"
E30,3czfc3,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"If it's really rhythmic then I would suspect something very simple, such as an incorrect wheel bolt catching on the internals of the brake drum (yes, you have drum brakes inside your rear discs), or a brake shoe has come loose.  Chock the front wheels. Jack the back end up so both wheels are off the ground (with jack stands). Put the car in neutral, then turn the wheels by hand. Feel for any momentary stiffness or resistance. If you find any, check the brake backplates and make sure that the tips of the brake shoe retaining pins are poking out and locking in the plate. Pound to a pinch of shit, one of them isn't."
E30,3czfc3,nerdcunningham,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, after watching a bunch of videos of worn u-joints, I don't think its that. My problem seems to be more of a rhythmic thumping which actually sounds exactly like this, so I think it's the subframe bushing."
E30,3czfc3,RackedE30,0,Mon Jul 13 21:31:02 2015 UTC,It's the u-joint on the drive shaft. Get a refurb drive shaft.
E30,3czfc3,unknownop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:20:32 2015 UTC,Is it dangerous to drive in the mean time? And should I buy a whole drive shaft or just the u-joint?

E30,3czfc3,RackedE30,2,Sun Jul 12 05:29:34 2015 UTC,Should I avoid driving it in the mean time?
E30,3czfc3,Twaletta,2,Sun Jul 12 06:02:02 2015 UTC,Don't listen to me but I've been on bad ujoints for a while now because money is tight. They're so bad the joints whine and it sounds like a cat is slowly dying under my car.

E30,3czfc3,beefcakez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:41:36 2015 UTC,Knocked everytime I depressed the clutch pedal. Sounded terrible.
E30,3czfc3,beefcakez,2,Sun Jul 12 21:36:45 2015 UTC,I would repair this sooner rather than later
E30,3czfc3,Twaletta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"What's your definition of ""not that expensive""?  It will probably run at least $400.  You can find cheaper, but I wouldn't trust them."

E30,3cyjgz,tvrdloch,3,Sat Jul 11 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"The most likely cause of leaks is the large rubber O-ring that seals around the fuel pump. This is a quick, easy and cheap thing to fix, so try this first.  Second part is the metal filling pipe, running from the filler cap down. This rusts and develop holes which can leak, and is easy to fix.  Unfortunately, if it's not those two things then it will be the seal around the tank, or the stub pipe that connects to the filler pipe. Neither of these can be repaired, so it will be time to buy a new tank.  If you DO need a new tank, then you will need to remove the prop-shaft (US: drive shaft) and the exhaust system. However, this is a great time to also take care of the corroded rear metal brake pipes that your (and every other) E30 definitely has at this point."
E30,3cyjgz,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:22:59 2015 UTC,The e30 gas tank can leak from the seam around the circumference. It can also leak from the filler hose connection at the back right side. Check them out. Both can be fixed with a new tank. But you might also be able to sort them out with epoxy applied liberally.
E30,3cyjgz,RusstyC,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"is it possible to check that without any ""service gear""? sorry i am really noob at this:)"
E30,3cyjgz,Audiontoxication,2,Sat Jul 11 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"All good need to check the leak would be a flashlight, and maybe a screwdriver.   To get the car higher off the ground without proper jack and jack stands drive it up on the curb with the driver side wheels on the sidewalk a bit. That way maybe you can get under there and take a look around.   Another place to check would be to pull the bottom of the back seat up and  unscrew the access cover(s) and look for leakage from the pump and level sender."
E30,3cyjgz,DoctorLondom,3,Sun Jul 12 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"Another place to check would be to pull the bottom of the back seat up and unscrew the access cover(s) and look for leakage from the pump and level sender.   Check here first. When I replaced my fuel pump, I had the o-ring that seals the whole assembly to the top of the tank slightly out. It smelled like fuel all the time and would leave a puddle if filled up all the way.  If all looks good there, check for rust on the tank or a rotten filler neck pipe. I think there's a little guard that you can take off to inspect it from the wheel well but I may be thinking of something else."
E30,3cyjgz,jrodp1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"I had a similar thing happen to me. In the engine bay on the driver side there should be the fuel hoses. Easy to see, check for cracks.

It's worth replacing the thermostat since they're like 20-30 bucks. Water pump is worth checking out too: if the bearing has any play at all (meaning it will wiggle even a little) just replace it. It shouldn't wiggle at all, only smoothly spin.  And word to the wise: if you need to add water, wait until it's cool. Never ever take the cap off the radiator when this engine is hot.

Suspension might need a refresh unless he's gotten to it, worth keeping in mind.   I'd say $1-1200 might be more realistic."

E30,3cmroi,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:55:19 2015 UTC,Yea my only concern is that I'm pretty shit with a drill. Plus if I am able to take it off clean I could probably sell it for more off the car than if I included it on the car.
E30,3cmroi,karmat0se,3,Thu Jul 9 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, an is lip with broken off studs is not going to fetch you much. I'd highly advise you do the job right. It's not that difficult.   Make a cardboard template of the holes and the outside diameter of the lip. line it up on your trunk lid where you want it and tape it to the trunk lid with blue painters tape. Use a centre punch to mark your holes. This will give you a nice divot to start drilling and keep the drill from wandering all over your trunklid and destroying your paint. Prep your drill bit. I'd wrap a bunch of painters tape about half way up your bit to prevent yourself from punching the chuck down into your trunk lid once you do break through the metal. Get some touch up paint and liberally brush it in the holes you just drilled to keep it from rusting and then fasten down your new is lip."
E30,3cmroi,jebner2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:54:16 2015 UTC,Yea im starting to think k that drilling is a better idea. Thanks for the advice!

E30,3cmroi,Twaletta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"3M's ""Heavy Duty Exterior Mounting Tape"" will hold 20lb/square in and be able to handle the heat of a car in the summer.  That said, I would be extremely wary of putting it on an E30.  Getting it off a Celica is fine and all, but it probably had paint with a clearcoat.  If you put any double sided tape on an E30's single stage paint, it won't matter how hard you try, paint is going to come off with it.  Just drill it.  Can you think of any reason why you would ever need to remove it?"
E30,3cmroi,pbsun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didn't know that the e30s don't have a clear coat. I'm just way about drilling it because I'm pretty shit at drilling haha. I guess I'll just measure 100 times and drill once haha."
E30,3cmroi,sunny_sunniest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:46:07 2015 UTC,If you drill the holes slightly larger you will have enough play to tweak the alignment of it.  Worst case scenario you have to drill them a little bigger still.  I've done it before and understand the hesitation in intentionally putting a holes in your car.  Just consider that it's how they do it at the factory and jump in.

E30,3ci4fq,tokeonthis,2,Fri Jul 10 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"/u/Keltarrant already linked a great article for the odometer. Now, for the tach. Have you noticed other gauges or lights not working in the instrument cluster? It is most likely the battery that powers the instrument cluster itself. My tach recently went out and I plan on replacing that battery soon. I've been going by ear but if you're not experienced with the rpm's then I suggest just replacing the battery which does require some soldering."
E30,3ci4fq,sunny_sunniest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"Correct. This is most likely the battery. If you're handy with a soldering iron, the batteries cost around $20 total. However, if the current batteries have leaked acid and other chemicals onto the board, you're going to have to replace the lower board which will run you around $150-175.     If you need the board replaced, here is where you should get it done: http://www.bavrest.com/si-boards.html"
E30,3ci4fq,thughes16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:26:55 2015 UTC,As it has already been said the gears are a common issue for the odometer to stop working. A quick google search will source them. The tach is likely the SI board batteries failing. Some of the later model boards have batteries you can replace. Older ones don't. You can swap the boards out as long as you keep your coding plug. Again a Google search will help you or pm me for some more details.
E30,3ciawk,Clay3304,3,Wed Jul 8 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"If what he says in the ad is true, then it sure seems reliable to me. Maintenance on these older BMW engines isn't too difficult and most of the stuff you could do yourself (if anything goes wrong). The asking price seems pretty reasonable and damn, that e30 looks pretty awesome."
E30,3ciawk,Narek_S,3,Wed Jul 8 07:56:12 2015 UTC,"So long as you do you regular preventative maintenance,  this will last a lifetime.    There will probably be some electrical issues from time to time but most often it's something like a bad relay or simply a blown fuse.    Just keep in mind that it's 25 year old technology and parts. It was advanced at the time,  but it's still an old car."
E30,3ciawk,beefcakez,5,Wed Jul 8 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"Note that he is running incorrect fitment wheels, with adapters, and openly admits that the bearings are shot. That's what you'll have to live with if you run that sort of setup.  Besides that, a 320i 4-door was never a valuable E30 (it was a weird model with the power of a 318 and the fuel economy of a 325i) so the value of the shell is nominal... especially considering the massive dent in the front wing. But taking a 28 year old shell and stuffing a 40-year-old engine (technology-wise) plus some aftermarket bling does not make this car worth the value of two decent 325iS's.  The owner didn't do the swap himself, so you really have no idea of what corners were cut or ""creative solutions"" applied in terms of making the engine fit, and you also have no idea of the provenance of the engine. I would want a full body check and an engine diagnostic (power output, compression test etc) before spending a penny on that car.  An M30-swapped E30 was a decent chariot back in its day, but it's been surpassed by the M50 swap which delivers comparable performance at a fraction of the fuel cost, with increased reliabilty thanks to the parts being 20 years younger. If an M30 isn't nestled cozily in an E24, it's not really worth buying."

E30,3ciawk,Narek_S,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"Adapters place an unacceptable lateral load on the suspension geometry, leading to bushing and bearing failure such as the one seen in the advert.  If you're using adapters to crawl your arse-dragging stanced ride to the local cars-and-coffee, you probably won't place enough stress or do enough miles to lead to that sort of failure, but if you add an extra 100kg to the nose of the car and 50 hp to the drivetrain (like an M30-engine'd E30), and bolt your wheels on via adapters, then you're asking for trouble."
E30,3ciawk,Grrrmachine,2,Thu Jul 9 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"If you have tools and can follow instructions, then you can work on an E30.

I'm currently in the middle of changing the oil filter housing gasket, and while it does take time to do the job, there isn't much to it as far as difficulty.

E30,3cfhn7,bmr321,3,Tue Jul 7 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"The E30 will have a lot more power stock, and with suspension upgrades will be about on par with a miata handling-wise. The E30 is a good bit more complex motor-wise than a miata, but it is still somewhat simple to work on, especially compared to a lot of newer vehicles. If you are doing a full suspension and tires, the E30 will be a lot more fun than a miata due to the extra power, however handling wise they will both be just about on par. I would truthfully say drive both and see which you prefer, there is no concrete answer here, the miata is much lighter and throwable, but the E30 has the benefit of power, and with a suspension upgrade they hold corners like almost nothing else.   If you are looking around, I would also strongly suggest looking at the E36, and the MR2 Spyder, both are also fantastic handling machines, and insanely reliable."
E30,3cfhn7,RaverDrew,3,Tue Jul 7 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"Ive owned multiples of both cars. My Miatas were honestly more reliable regardless of higher miles and more abuse they had received over the years. They were also dedicated autoX cars for awhile and responded really well to different tires and suspension mods and therefore outhandled my similarly modded 325e I owned at the time.  BUT.. In the end there is something about the E30 that I LIKE more. I now own a 318is and continue collecting E30s. Those Miatas are bulletproof and very fun little Japanese cars though..  Some people would argue E30's are bulletproof too but I honestly think the Miata has a stronger case for reliability and handling in the corners in my humble opinion. SO, you need to test drive both and see which one suits you better. You will like both. Guarantee it. Its just a matter of personal opinion, and of course the condition of the specific ones you look at."
E30,3cfhn7,Capwonder,4,Wed Jul 8 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"Let's start with the seat argument, while you say you won't notice not having a seat, you will definently catch you self using it. My first truck was single cab and I always claimed back seats were useless, till I bought something with some room behind it. So having back seats is a bonus. E30s are very forgiving road cars on stock suspension, but they stick like a mother on aftermarket. So, this gets important, while yes the miata can and will out handle the e30 in stock form, doing the same upgrades on either car (suspension, brakes) the e30 will really come to live. The e30 is a bit more ballsy than the miata, so exit speeds and entrance speeds will be better on e30, with supporting mods. If you do no engine work, and just suspension (like you said) e30 is the way to go. And personally I find the e30 muuuch more comfortable to just be in, it's not cramped at all and I'm 6'1"". I don't fit in miatas. Another thing to look out for is the community, I'll tell you right now, while the e30 community doesn't have as many people and isn't as thriving, it's way more mature, and the people who know their shit are easier to be found. Also, E30s are extremely easy to work on, and less fickle than a miatas engine. Neither engine takes mods very well. But you put a turbo on an e30 and holy hell...miata on the other hand isn't quite as exciting."
E30,3cfhn7,bmr321,5,Tue Jul 7 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"I used to have a Silverado with a backseat, and I used it a bit, but when I traded for my Miata I didn't miss it.   The other info there is great though, thank you!"

If the e30, get a 6.   An e28 is more of a cruiser, and it will never drive as nice as a miata/e30. It has a steering box, and the 528e is the same engine as a 325e.

There was a guy in a Miata that must have worked in the same area that took the same roads.  2 or 3 times a week we'd wind up on the road at the same time and we got into a bit of a rivalry.  For the better part of a year we'd go back forth, he would take me in the curves, and I would pull away in the straights.  The e30 was slightly faster, the Miata was slightly more nimble.  It was a pretty even match taken all together.    My e30 was pretty much stock.  The only upgrade was a set of Bilstein HDs, which are just Bilstein sports for stock height springs.  A little stiffer, but that's it.  I haven't a clue if the Miata guy did anything to his car since I never actually talked to him.  When I would turn off the road we'd exchange friendly waves and carry on til the next time.  I tried to drive a buddy's Miata one time, but it was a no-go.  I'm a lanky 6'3"" and just couldn't fit in it without my knees at my chin.  They aren't built for tall people."

E30,3cc8ud,YGOnewguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"Have you done a swap before?  I've been thinking of getting an automatic and doing the swap (to get all the experience) but I'm curious about the cost and if I require a car lift, if I could do it with just a pump jack/jack stands then that'd sway me into doing it myself  Cheers for any input"
E30,3cc8ud,Twaletta,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, hate to say, I haven't done a conversion.  I've done 2 clutches, and also swapped a busted manual for a rebuilt one.  I may have spoken too soon, but if you are relatively familiar with auto repair there is a lot of experience out in the forums to draw on.  Pretty much anything that can go wrong has probably happened to someone already.  But yeah, it does depend on your experience, and could definitely be a daunting task.  I was sort of shooting-from-the-hip there and not really getting deeper into the details."
E30,3cc8ud,YGOnewguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"I've done a swap with the help of a friend. Before the swap, I've done oil changes, fucked around with retrofitting HIDs into lights, swapped a steering rack, etc. I learned everything while working on my e30 (which ive omly owned for a year or so, so that should tell you it isn't too difficult). It's intimidating, but if you get the right tools, have someone to lend a hand (the auto transmission is heavy and certain bolts are hard to reach on your own) you should be fine. Budget a few days to do it. My swap took 2 full days but I'd say budget 3-4. Make sure you have 4 jackstands (although I used two and used two steel wheels to support the rear cause i was cheap), buy a wide variety of extensions, a good socket set, an inverted torx set, and some breaker bars at the least. Cost varies depending on where u live but i finished mine for $1000. New clutch, short shift kit, gear oil, etc. But I'm in Canada so if you're in california or texas or somewhere where older cars tend to last longer, it should be cheaper than that.  Make sure you read a few DIYs first and you'll be ok. E30s are pretty easy to work on. Goodluck if you decide to do it!  Ps. Writing on mobile so excuse the grammar and spelling lol"

The M20B27 is better than a lot of people give it credit for, but it isn't fast and it's not as fun as an M42 (I used to drive an E36 with an M42 in it, so I know).  That said, it sounds a lot more satisfying. The M20B27 has that throaty german I6 growl that a 4cyl just can't replicate."

It's a car you'll enjoy driving, and it's sympathetic to the mods and maintenance that you want to learn for working on newer cars (coil packs instead of distributors, an ECU with useable codes, chains instead of belts etc). It'll hold its value better, deliver many more smiles, and return better fuel economy into the bargain.  I would avoid all M20B27-equipped vehicles. Their very existence goes against the point of owning an E30."

E30,3c8dc0,AintNoJiveTurkey,3,Mon Jul 6 07:24:43 2015 UTC,"Assuming the car has the original single stage paint and it's not worn down to metal, you would be surprised at how much you can bring it back.  Single stage means the car doesn't have a clear coat and if a good coat of wax isn't maintained it tends to oxidize over time.  It is also more susceptible to bird crap staining the paint.    I used to do car wash maintenance as a side job and can say you also need to be really careful with automatic/coin operated car washes.  At the drive through washes they like to spray a degreaser on the front and lower portions of the car before it goes in to help break up road grime, and from personal experience I can tell you this is very bad.  It will almost immediately oxidize wherever it lands and the hotter the car is the worse it will be.  You've got to be careful with coin-op washes when using the 'tire cleaner' which is essentially just an eco-friendly degreaser like simple green.  On cars with decent clear coats you can actually use it as a pre-soak or even the primary wash.  The reason they don't tell you this is that it's much more expensive than the soap used in the standard ""soap"" setting.  I used to do it with my e46 with no problems, but the first time I did it with my e30 it got some really nasty oxidation all over.  I didn't know the type of paint made a difference at the time.  The single stage paint is why a lot of these cars look like the paint has just rubbed off at the edges of body panels like the hood.    Fortunately, if the car still has a generally even coat of paint, you can usually bring it back to life.  Dual stage paint is really hard to recover if the clear coat has worn off, because it's a separate layer that is integral to the finish.  Single stage is one uniform layer, so as long as there is paint there, you can usually work with it.  You'll probably want an electric random-orbit buffer, or be willing to put a lot of grunt into it.  Wash the car really well and then start with a full body clay barring.  Wash it again with a mild soap, and use the buffer to apply a deoxidizng product (can't think of a specific one off the top of my head, but one that does not have a sealant).  Then go at it with the buffer again with a good swirl-remover.    Finally give it at least two coats of a good wax.  I've used three coats Zymol Rouge on my red e30 and it was amazing, but that stuff is ridiculously expensive.  I think the smallest unit they sell is around $60, but a buddy let me use his.  Otherwise, I would have gone with something like a hard caranuba or maybe a liquid.  If you go liquid, Meguiars isn't bad, and neither is Zymol.  You've got to order the Zymol direct because the stuff they usually sell at wal-mart/auto parts stores is not the same stuff.  Granted, if you ask five people about the best waxes, you are likely to get five different answers, so do some research of your own.  The single stage paint requires more diligent maintenance, but can give you an amazingly deep shine and color.  My zinno-red e30 with a good wax can look amazing, especially at dusk when you can see some gorgeous purples and crimsons coming out of it on the bodies curves.  It's hard to describe without seeing it in person.  tl;dr - If you have a solid coat of original paint, don't despair.  We have the technology.  We can rebuild it."

Well, I think so. I reinforced mine with the subframe out.   Here's a picture of one that has a reinforcement welded on (I have no affiliation with Garagistic, btw).   I don't think it's a huge problem. I think you could repair it while the subframe is on the car.

E30,3c7zfq,RackedE30,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:54:55 2015 UTC,"It likely is the throwout bearing.  You have to pull the transmission to replace it and is usually replaced as part of a clutch job along with the pressure plate.   Compared to many cars, the e30 transmission is relatively simple to pull, but it's still a pretty big job as far as repairs go.  It is definitely doable by most driveway mechanics and doesn't require any special tools other than some female torx sockets, a clutch alignment tool (which comes with most clutch kits), and a lot of socket extensions.  Do you know how long it's been since he replaced it last?  I've done two clutch jobs on these cars and each time the throwout bearing sounded perfect for ~15-20k miles and then started to rattle again.  Personally, I would say it's not that big of a deal and that its just one of the things they do.  Mine currently rattles a little but I'm holding off until I need to do my clutch.  Throwout bearings can take a lot of pressure and abuse.  It would be hard to say how much you should worry without actually hearing it in person, though.  If you do end up taking it apart it is a really good time to replace the bushings for the shift linkages, driveshaft center bearing, and guibo (the bushing between the driveshaft and tranny)."
E30,3c7zfq,Twaletta,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:49:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure the last time he replaced it but he said it was new.
E30,3c7zfq,Twaletta,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"It could also be the input shaft in the transmission is a little worn so the bearing (which just slides over it) isn't sitting perfectly snug on it.  Again, I personally wouldn't think it's too big a deal.  As long as the splines on the shaft are mating to the clutch disc properly it shouldn't be a problem.  Edit:  Here is a few pictures if it helps explain.  The first is the pressure plate, the second is the whole transmission with the input shaft in the center, and the third is the exploded diagram of the clutch assembly.  The throwout bearing is #4 and the pressure plate is #1 and the clutch is #2.  The back of the pressure plate is like a solid cone with slits cut into it to act like a spring.  The bearing slides over the splined shaft in the middle of the transmission.  When you push the clutch in the bearing moves off the the spring part of the pressure plate.  Without the pressure the noise shows up because it has a little play.  The shaft can be slightly worn where the bearing sits on it (the smooth part behind the splined shaft) which will make it rattle slightly when not under pressure, but as long as the splines are tightly meshed with the clutch disc, it shouldn't affect the function.  I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker.  http://imgur.com/vG9aqhM http://imgur.com/CE71apc http://imgur.com/mEtGq1J"

It took me about a month and a half because of  the delivery times and I had never done something like that before. But it was well worth it...  And no. Eventually, it will just kick out for good.

A friend of mine ran hubcentric spacers of either 15 or 20mm to make them work for track wheels though.Unless you have someone to turn down some spacers for you, it's probably cheaper to find some Euroweaves. is weaves are 14"" and I'd advise against. Better tire selection in 15"" and up."

If your offset is +15 then you'll need a 5 or 10 mm spacer up front to clear the shock housing. If you don't want to worry about rolling your fenders, get 15x8 +20 (I believe) offset all around with 195/50 tires. My friend was running that on his e30 and it looked great."
E30,3bvg4f,beefcakez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"you asked for 15'"" BBS***, and those are the options that i know of immediately. as beefcakez said later on, the 15"" bbs options are pretty limited, I forgot that the IX weaves need spacers to fit properly.   other than the IX BBS weaves, the euroweave is named so because it was an option available to european models only. they fit perfectly without spacers though and are a pretty good choice for 15"" weaves. otherwise stick to 15x7 or 15x7.5 with an ET25~ wheel."
E30,3bvg4f,beefcakez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:07:57 2015 UTC,so any 15x7 et 25 should fit nicely without spacers/etc?

Cheaper to find either a nice 325i/is or a m4x 318i/is.  But if the body is clean and you want to trip down the rabbit hole of emptying your wallet, go nuts. M10 responds well to boost but is dog slow otherwise."

Comparing to a friends 325* my iX is much more playful even with more weight), a 318i (late models had a modern powerful 4 cylinder rather than a 2002 era 4).  Basically don't just get the first E30 you drive: you may like a 325i, 325is, 318i, or 318is more. At least try a 325i out I feel it's the most 'E30' E30, as in a peppy high revving smooth straight six.  *No offense eta motor guys but revving so low felt so wrong (4800 vs 6700 rpm).

E30,3bo7y3,Spearhead90,2,Tue Jun 30 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"the hood looks misaligned, has it been in an accident? will vibrations from a bent wheel really stop at a certain mph? surely it should get worse with more speed if the wheel is bent? is there frame damage causing the vibration or something?"
E30,3bo7y3,deject3d,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"They can fade out as speed increases.  It's kind of like the wheel gets moving so fast that the wobbles blend together and feel smoother.  Depending on how/where the wheel is off balance, it can happen at different speeds.    I would still bring it to a tire shop and have them confirm its the wheel doing it though. If it needs front struts, the vibration could be anything suspension related, like control arms or bushings."
E30,3bo7y3,Twaletta,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. If the vibration is from bent rims it will smooth out. In my experienced this happens between 55-65 mph, but it's shouldn't be noticeable below 40 mph. If there is noticeable vibration before this, could be motor mounts or any number of parts in the suspension."
E30,3bo7y3,sunny_sunniest,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"The only accident it was in to my knowledge was the 20mph impact with a snow bank. Which caused the damage to the front bumper, and could have damaged the hood as well. I got the VIN just a couple minutes ago, running a CarFax."
E30,3bo7y3,dream__weaver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:41:14 2015 UTC,I paid $2000 for my 89 325i with 120k original miles with absolutely no mechanical issues and cosmetically the only problem was the hood had no clear coat whatsoever.

E30,3bo7y3,sunny_sunniest,0,Wed Jul 1 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Does the vibration happen at all speeds up to 50 or does it occur around 40 and stop at 55-60? If it occurs at all speeds it isn't just the wheels. If it is indeed the wheels, I would take that deal for myself, but that is of course realizing I am willing to put in the work and money to get that thing up to par. A lot of people will tell you these cars are easy to work on, that's kind of true. What they don't tell you is that a lot of it isn't. There is so much repair and maintenance misinformation on forums, especially this one that are going to send you into loops trying to find the answer. You'll encounter a lot of: ""This worked for me"" fixes which are total crap. This is a car, a speeding death machine metal missile. It has to be taken seriously and a fix that has worked for some random person for the last 2,000 miles isn't a fix that is tried and true."
E30,3bo7y3,Twaletta,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, no.  Compared to most other cars out there, these cars are remarkably easy to work on.    You say ""a lot of it isn't"" easy to work on.  Could you give us some context?  Also, you say there is a lot of misinformation on the forums, ""especially this one"".  Got some examples?  These cars have been around for a while.  There aren't many ""fixes"" out there with only 2k miles on them still waiting for verification."
E30,3bo7y3,sunny_sunniest,0,Wed Jul 1 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"Hope this doesn't come off as argumentative, I am just trying to be clear. Discounting more modern vehicles where everything is jam packed, yes they are easier to work on, but I wouldn't say easy. Their design is simpler and there is more space to get access to what you need, however, E30s are typically 25 years old or more. That comes with bolts that have never been touched, bolts that have been put under a lot of strain and will easily break at their head, and electrical connectors that will literally fall apart in your hand just from being touched. Have you ever had to or looked at what is involved in replacing a starter on an M20? Unless you plan on pulling the transmission, it's a nightmare. The ""witch clip"" above a Getrag 260 when all you are trying to do is replace some simple bushings, with the tranny on, it's the least fun thing to do...next to the starter. Electrical gremlins too, a mis-cared for E30 can have a lot of them, even from a previous owner who ""has taken great care of"" their E30 with ""regular oil changes."" ""Easy"" in ""easy to work on"" means a lot of different things to a lot of people. Many redditors asking for help often say they are in high school, on a limited budget, and have limited or just a little mechanical skill. ""Easy"" is such a subjective word and is going to mean something very different between a seasoned mechanic, someone in high school who grew up working on cars, and someone in high school who goes to shop class and knows how to solder.  In regards to misinformation, there are a lot ""fixes"" where the damage won't show up for tens of thousands of miles and even then, if the person isn't aware of it in the first place, they won't understand what went wrong and will chalk it off to wear and tear and not their mistake. As an example, I've seen everything suggested on this forum from using non distilled water in the cooling system, not using spring pads so they can lower their car more and look oh so cool without doing it right (Yes, I know this won't break the car but 10k miles later the driver is going to keep wondering what that sound is). I've spent hours and hours pulling parts of off E30s at salvage yards that weren't in accidents and am sometimes able to see how they ""broke"" their E30 when really it was them or their mechanic not understanding what they were doing. The thing about people and forums, is that they typically don't come back and report their catastrophic failures and like I stated, many times, they don't even see the connection in the first place. Hell, even BMW didn't get everything right in their technical manuals. If you have an M42 and you're looking at your valve timing and other important engine something something that I don't recall at the moment, you are going to want to read the M42 section in the E36 Bentley (yes, for your M42 powered E30), as the E30 Bentley was published before some issues were discovered. To be honest, I stopped reading the ""I need help threads"" as people more often than not offer suggestions instead of known solutions or focused troubleshooting. I went through the past couple of pages to find another example and there was a redditor looking for help with a starting issue. Yes, these can be difficult to diagnose, but not a single person even offered up the most common and easy fix, replacing one's ground wires. $10 at Home Depot versus what they suggested; a new starter and a throttle position sensor. /r/e30 is just not the best place to find that information. Bimmerforums, R3V, M42club, and many others have much more of an existing knowledge base than this sub does. (Honestly, I wish a mod would link these websites in the sub and suggest looking at them first. It's much safer).    POST EDIT: Also, the word ""work"" means a lot of different things to different people. To some people that means oil changes, to some it means rebuilding an engine, and to some it means fixing whatever goes wrong with the car. POST POST EDIT: In regards to starter replacement, some E30s have starter fasteners that enter a threaded transmission housing while others do not, making it much more difficult."

E30,3bi1wa,sensation_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"Trust me, there are way more PITA things on an e30. It's probably not the relay since they are designed to almost always fail in a neutral position with no current flowing.  If the wipers are blowing fuses with the correct rating it is almost always a bad wiper motor.  It could maybe be some kind of physical interference causing the arms to not move, but these wiper motors have some really soft gears and will usually just strip a few teeth off them if it gets stuck and cause it to not initiate the sweep.  The wiper motor will just sound like its vibrating until you manually push the blades up a bit.  It could be a short somewhere in the wiring to the motor, but unless you were recently messing around near the wiring, it isn't usually likely."
E30,3bh496,tireq,2,Mon Jun 29 04:19:24 2015 UTC,More details.  Is the engine reving and the car not moving?  Is the engine dieing back to idle?  Is it only after a corner?  Can you recreate the fault in any other conditions?  Is it an auto?

E30,3bh496,DeepMidWicket,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:30:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, sounds clutchy. next time your in your car pull the hand brake on as hard as you can (dont try this if your hand brake doesn't work), put the car in 5th, rev it to about 3k (or in your case have a guess) then dump the clutch like your trying to do a big skid. if the clutch is good the car will stall immediately, if you can hold revs on the car then this will mean the clutch is no good, only do this in 5th gear, this wont damage anything its just a quick test, but dont sit with it reving for ages if it can or you will burn whats left of the clutch out.  If you aren't able to ascertain things like what the engine is doing with out the help of a gauge, then I would strongly recommend having a trusted mechanic look at the car to at the least confirm your diagnosis. As inexperience or misunderstanding a symptom can lead to expensive, unnecessary repairs, I'm not having a dig either I've just seen a lot of people caught out like that."

E30,3bh496,DeadlyPixels,2,Mon Jun 29 14:38:18 2015 UTC,"Try getting the car to about 30 mph, put it in 4th gear, and floor it.  Even without a working tach you should be able to hear if the clutch is slipping by listening to the engine.  It it sounds like the RPMs surge higher than they should without a significant increase in speed, then it's slipping.  I had a car that would surge close to the redline in 4th at low speeds from a worn clutch."
E30,3bh496,HWKII,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:49 2015 UTC,I'm thinking clutch also? Not that I have had one die on me yet - a mechanic should be able to tell you pretty quickly if that is the problem.

Wondering if the power steering system isn't robbing you of power somehow. On absolutely full lock, Reverse behaves a bit like this for my car.  If the clutch was slipping then the engine speed (RPM) will increase faster than wheel speed (it will Rev and Rev and never really accelerate)."
E30,3bh1z4,Audetat,2,Mon Jun 29 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Well the main pros are that these cars are very fun to drive and are rear wheel drive. If maintained properly, they can be pretty reliable. But they are 25+ year old cars, they're bound to have problems here and there. Some e30s will have more problems than others but parts are cheap and most problems you could fix yourself. If you're going to have to resort to a mechanic shop for every problem the car gives you, then this isn't the car for you."

E30,3bfj5i,Narek_S,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I would think a clogged fuel filter would cause a power loss from a certain point all the way up through the RPMs.  Since higher RPMs require more fuel delivery it doesn't seem like the issue would disappear after 4.5k, instead it would get worse.  Did your car have a constant hesitation after a certain RPM, or did it go away after a certain point in the range?  My initial thought was my fuel pump since I did run out of gas twice in a month.  But again, it doesn't seem to make sense that it would go away at a point where the engine needs more fuel.  It's a cheap part, so I might just try either way."
E30,3bfj5i,Narek_S,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"My car just randomly did it, didn't matter what RPM. It just hesitated because it shut off and basically kick started itself each time, but very quickly."

Check the engine coolant temp sensor for the dme. Those occasionally leak internally to the contacts with the wiring harness and can cause weird issues.

Do you still have the plastic cowling/splash guard that goes under the bumper and radiator? How are your ABS and brake wear sensor cables? Might refresh your transmission and rear differential fluid in case anything got in the vents."
E30,3bch98,Deltigre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'll try to get pictures tomorrow once it's in the garage.   I don't think I ever had a splash guard in the first place, at least not one I remember. I do have a big ass aftermarket skid plate though.   I did a quick check of the cables and sensors, and everything seemed ok. Good idea on the trans and diff fluids. It should be time to change those anyways."
E30,3bb1tq,Redlineraid,2,Sat Jun 27 14:37:52 2015 UTC,Depending on which year you might have an internal pump or an internal transfer and an external pump.   I found the walbro in the external position to be a little too noisy for me. I ended up going back to stock bosch.   No need for upgrade if it's stock. No benefits to be had.
E30,3bb1tq,single-needle,2,Sat Jun 27 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"I've done this on a past E30 and am likely about to do it again.  My fuel gauge was out for a little bit and I accidentally ran out of gas twice, and now it is giving me some stuttering at higher pressures/RPMs.  It's a simple job and unless you are running boost there isn't a reason to upgrade.  Bosch is OEM, even if it doesn't have the BMW roundel on it.  As vital as the fuel pump is, I wouldn't go generic.  If you don't finish the job, keep an eye on your car.  If you leave your windows down overnight (because of the gas fumes from the exposed tank) you might get woken up at 2:00 in the morning because the police caught some teenagers in your car trying to steal your radio/CDs.  True story."
E30,3bb1tq,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"I replaced my worn Bosch pump with a TRE unit for $60. Pushes 255 lph which is more than enough for the m20.   Don't worry, it's spec'd for the M20.   http://treperformance.com/i-656-bmw-255-lph-fuel-pump-many-years-and-models.html  Took maybe an hour to install but that's because I had to walk from my apartment to my car a few times when I forgot tools, etc."
E30,3bb1tq,beefcakez,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:11:55 2015 UTC,What year?   I went to a walbro when mine went out.  Was kinda a pain doing the modification and would probably just go oem if I had to replace it again.

E30,3b8nn8,uselesspeople,4,Fri Jun 26 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"I found there to be a surprising amount of space in the back for the size of the car. Climbing in and out of the back really isn't much of an issue with the larger coupe doors. 4 adults fit fine if the driver doesn't mind moving his/her seat foward a wee bit. I've had 5 average sized adults in my E30 at one point, it was tight for sure, and I wouldn't want to go on a long road trip like that.  All that said, I rarely have more than 2 people in my car, and that's how I like to keep it."

I'm 5' 9'' and I fit comfortably in the back with the driver seat in my driving position. That being said, I wouldn't want to be back there for a long journey, but it isn't unbearable. Getting in and out isn't difficult either, if a bit undignified. If carrying more than one passenger is a near daily thing, I would skip it and go for the sedan, but for infrequent extras, you can do a lot worse"
E30,3b8nn8,SabreLilly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I often have 4 people in the car, including myself so I'm probably going to just end up getting a sedan."

E30,3b8nn8,CHOLTZY,2,Sat Jun 27 02:20:47 2015 UTC,the last time I had a back seat  passenger he sat sideways. Its pretty snug back there but I can lay back there and take a nap if I need to and I'm 6ft 1
E30,3b8nn8,BMW_325is,2,Sat Jun 27 02:42:44 2015 UTC,If you're decoding between a 4 door and a 2 door the only difference is getting in and out. They have the same amount of rear seat space.
E30,3b8nn8,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"It also depends on how tall you are.  I'm 6'3"" and that basically means I only have one rear seat for an adult, and one for a child.  It is tight regardless for an adult.  Anything beyond 30 minutes is going to get uncomfortable for those involved.  Coupe vs. sedan makes no difference as far as available space. It may be a little easier to get in a 4 door, but it's a minor concern compared to the space we are working with."

These were the first years with plastic pumps and rubber timing belts and are known for failing. My ETA also caught fire due to I'm pretty sure fuel pump issues. Again, they are great reliable 6 cylinder engines, but you should expect putting the same amount you've paid in the next year to make her pretty reliable. My E21 cost me 1400 and I've put about that much in to make her a decent car. They are old cars though unless you have 5 grand and 2 weeks time, don't expect an immaculate car. It's all about the fun of owning a vintage BMW and figuring out and fixing issues yourself as they arise. Finally if you do buy the car, the first thing to do is invest in a Bentley manual. Don't rely solely on forums and random internet sites! Good luck and expect quite the hospitality from fellow enthusiasts if you do buy"
E30,3ba03y,gaboy101,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feed back.  But as I went to check it out earlier today, I was pushed into reality.  Aside from the things he mentioned wrong with the car, the straw that broke the camels back were 2 things.  First being a cracked oil pan. After jacking the car up, I was in disbelief with the amount of oil that covered the under side, not to mention the oil dripping.  Second was the sudden vibration of the car that started in the high RPM's of second gear and low third gear. The vibration was not felt as much in forth gear, however it was still noticeable.  Fixing the oil pan would not have been that much of a problem for myself, however I was really worried that the vibration was due to the transmission."
E30,3ba03y,gaboy101,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"Well it's good you didn't make a rash decision. Yes, the oil pan could of been a pain but doable, but the trans is an issue. It could of just been a bad flex disc, but I fooled myself with my e21 as fourth wouldn't engage easily when I bought it. After 18 hours and 400 dollars, I did replace it, but it was definitely the biggest job I've ever done. Keep looking. There are always good vintage BMWs at the right price, but you have to be patient and really look."

E30,3atwb2,yeowoh,2,Tue Jun 23 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Exterior probably won't need a respray. It looks like the front passenger side fender was replaced and repainted so it faded differently.  You can polish out single stage paint like this to a factory finish usually
E30,3atwb2,Chinampa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, single stage paint takes a little more effort to maintain but is a little more forgiving when it comes to fixing minor blemishes.  When waxed it gives a level of depth that dual-stage paint just can't match.  If that fender was painted with dual stage paint, which is more common these days, it will never be exactly right.  That being said, a mismatched fender is not a disqualifier on a mechanically sound car."
E30,3atwb2,Twaletta,2,Tue Jun 23 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"That car looks pretty great, actually. I would definitely check for rust and take it for a test drive when you go to look at it though."

Since it has a sunroof, double-check it's seals, coz once they start leaking it's hard to fix them without gluing the whole sunroof with silicone or whatever.

But if you dont already have your particular vehicle you want to work on, and aren't completely obsessed with how they're assembled, then you're going to need to understand some general automotive concepts.  Seeing as you come from a nice 2000+ nissan, what other cars have you driven? oil changes? help out a friend with their car?  help us know your experience level a bit more, and we can probably point you in a better direction :)"
E30,3ao2s2,toerrisbadsyntax,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:55:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I've added a bit to my op
E30,3ao2s2,beefcakez,3,Mon Jun 22 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for 9 years. We've been through a lot together; good and bad.   My advice is to keep a reliable second car around as you'll undoubtedly be working on the e30 [a lot]. It's old; things are going to wear out and need repairs/replacement. It's just a part of owning a vehicle.   Don't worry about it being hard to do. If you have a mechanics set of tools, you're able to do most of the work on it, even if you're not mechanically inclined. Honestly, this is a great car to work on and learn how to wrench.   You need to buy a Bentley Manual for this car. It's your E30 bible. It will teach you nearly everything you'll need to know about repairing things. Except electrical gremlins. Those are just a PITA.   If you have questions about what's going on with your car, just do a search on r3vlimited or e30tech. Someone else has already had that problem 99% of the time and most always it's been documented in a thread. Also, you could ask here in /r/e30.  Good luck! I hope you buy an E30. I love mine!"
E30,3ao2s2,happygetaway,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's a great car, I'm sure you'll love it even more when you get one.   My suggestion is to get one in good shape, since you're not mechanical inclined. You're going drop a bit more though. This will be best because you won't be overwhelmed with repairs and you can slowly begin to change and learn things about your car.  If your looking for a weekend car, something to take around the corners I would go with a 325i(s) or a 318i(s), if you don't care about speed or like good gas mileage go with an eta(325e sometimes just 325). Either way you'll enjoy it.  Good luck and welcome to the club!"
E30,3ao2s2,FistingMona,2,Mon Jun 22 04:56:30 2015 UTC,You will want to join r3vlimited.com and e30zone.net they are the best forums for E30 BMW information. If you have a question or need to know how to do something the answers are on there. I just bought my E30 before last winter and spent the winter months reading writeups on there you will learn a lot about the car. They are great to work on fairly simple design for most things on the car.

Yellow light is actually a bit more effective at cutting through fog than white (I've been told) but for that to really matter it would be better to go with a yellow bulb than a bit of plastic.  The kit to do it was $10 on Amazon...  My next cosmetic project will be converting the headlights and fog lights to projectors and putting modern bulbs in there. For now, I think it looks nice."

I had that motor with just some cheap headers and an intake in a Volvo 242 and it was a riot to drive. I bought my motor for $250 with the wiring and accessories still on it, the T5 trans shouldn't cost you more than another $200. Ignore anybody who says its only worth swapping in an LS motor."

E30,3ajdgh,toerrisbadsyntax,2,Sun Jun 21 07:50:08 2015 UTC,"The two biggest problems besides the size of the engine itself is brakes and exhaust.   The engine interferes with the stock brake booster enough that it's impossible to fit a booster in the stock location which leaves you with a setup like v8 e34's had, wilwood boosterless setup, hydroboost, or some crazy remote booster in the trunk...  Exhaust just has to have custom headers to clear steering on the drivers side.  I like the swap but it's just the brakes part that's keeping me away from it."

My first was an 87 325e and while I LOVE it to death, I can't tell you how much time, money and work went into making it as fast and as good looking as a plain 89i or similar.   As far what to look for u/PocketChant has a lot of good info. Rust sucks, don't deal with it if you can help it. For me the interior was important, which is just a quick visual. Also, despite the fact that e30 owners are all do it yourselfers, you don't wanna be chasing down 100 oil leaks from top to bottom. You should be able to tell a lot by just popping the hood... Check out the plug wires, check out the hoses and intake boot, you don't want any cracks. Take a peek under the car and look for any serious oil leaks, shifting should be fairly stiff/mechanical, even if it's all stock linkage.   Most of all, welcome to the family and enjoy the ride."

I didn't really get a chance to give it a spring once-over this year yet short of an oil change so I'd like to sideline it for a week or two. Everything on the car is more or less new though so I'm not worried at all about it mechanically. My E30 does not get winter driven. I don't like having to rely on my E30 because it's hella uncomfortable and not very good over speedbumps, etc but right now I don't have much choice.

It's essentially racing equally, slightly upgraded e30s.  I knew a guy that did Spec Miata and he always had a blast.    Performance upgrades are limited to mostly suspension setups and everyone has the same.  Other than safety mods like rollcages, they generally strip them down for weight savings, but there is even a limit to how much you can lose.  Other modifications are heavily regulated.  It's basically serious auto racing for regular guys without having to spend huge amounts of money.   Someone told me once you could easily set up a car for SpecE30 for $5k, give or take."

E30,3a5pgg,bmwe92toe30,4,Wed Jun 17 12:57:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't really an E30 question, is it? It's about financing, your need for a car (200 miles in 8 months?), and the economic sense in trading a relatively new car for a really old one.  So should you sell the E92? In my opinion, sure - modern BMWs are mostly soulless turds designed for corporate fleets, not individual drivers, and there's no point owning one if you're not inspired to drive it. Only you can decide whether the resale value now, plus whatever it costs you to pay off your loan, is financially viable, but you should anticipate how much the next three years of finance will cost you, and how much the car will depreciate by then. As an idea, look at how cheap you can get a 2004 3-series now - that's how much money you stand to lose by selling in 2018.  As for buying an E30 - why do you want one? If you're in the city, the constant stop-start traffic will get very tiring very quickly compared to modern cars, and combined with the constant need for maintenance (these cars are 25+ years old now) you may find that it's a lot more work than you'd thought.  To offset this, the E30 is an appreciating classic. If you think prices are high now, prepare for them to potentially double over the next 3 years as the rotten ones go to the scrapyard and the cheap ones get crashed by teenagers. By the time you sell your E92, the price may be too steep for it to be a sensible option.  I haven't made any real attempt to answer your question, but I hope I've given you more angles from which to look at the issue."
E30,3a5pgg,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"I understand your point and yes, this is probably more of a question about financing. I thought about where I would get the best information and since I don't own a E30, this was the place to go.  Why I want a E30.. I think it's all about the feeling of not trying to stick out too much about having an expensive car and also to drive something that looks amazing in my eyes. Right now they prices are good for no rust, well serviced e30s. I can find really nice ones for about €5000-6000.  Your answer made me think and I thank you for it. My second option is to just, ""fuck it"" and use my car and just not care about the selling price in 3 years ahead, just enjoy what I already own."
E30,3a5pgg,RackedE30,2,Thu Jun 18 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"If it's going to be your only car, having the e30 on the side might be a good idea. Unless you sell your e92 and have 10k+ to throw at an E30 and have it completely gone through at a shop. Then I say go for it!"

E30,3a5pgg,joshamania,2,Thu Jun 18 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"You have the reverse of a dilemma I recently fixed for myself.  I just got a new job that pays rather well after being broke-ass for years.  I'd started considering leasing or buying a new 2-series because it's now well within my budget.  But then I started thinking about what would happen in six months.  One impetus for me having another car is so I can do some major work on my e30.  I want to replace the front suspension...the whole suspension, really.  Do any rust work needed, replace the exhaust.  Timing belt, tensioner, water pump, thermostat...new brakes all around.  Clutch, replace all my hoses and gaskets...basically a complete overhaul on the car.  There's not much of this I cannot do in my own garage...thank you to all the e30 owners on Youtube.  The only thing holding me back is the need for another vehicle while I'm doing major surgery.  I'll still need to get to work and back and forth to whatever when I'm ordering parts half-way through a particular job/fix...because we all know that will happen.  If I take apart the suspension to replace the struts and springs and discover that I need new strut housings...I'm not gonna put it all back together so I can drive while waiting for the mail for 2 or 3 days.  So say I spend all this money on a new 2-series and spend the next three to six months making my e30 rock solid...what happens after that?  I decided what will happen is I'll have a $600/month paperweight sitting in my garage while I hoon around in my like-new e30.  There's almost zero chance I'll not keep driving the e30...even in the snow.  It's my daily driver now and unless I win the lottery I don't see that changing any time soon, for any reason.  What I ended up deciding is that I'm not going to get a new 2-series...or anything right away.  I'm going to rent a car a week at a time while I do certain projects and at least in the short term not even bother with having a 2nd car that will just sit in my garage but for maybe a couple of days a month.  Were I you, I'd sell your car now, while it's worth more, and take the dive...but I have hindsight telling me what to do.  I absolutely love my car.  It's like having a first car again after 25 years.  That said, you may not have the same experience.  If you can buy an e30 first...do that...so you can figure out what you're really going to end up doing...but keep in mind the value of your current car is going to do nothing but drop.  You'll get a lot more for it now than you will in 3 years."
E30,3a5pgg,joshamania,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is that I've never owned a ""cheap"" car.. my first car cost me €15,000 and was a E90 325i and the one I got now is even more expensive than that. Ive had a nice job for the last 7 years where I only walk 5 min to get to work and I live in the middle of the city so Ive never needed a car in the first place.  A car for me have always been something to care about, making sure its keeping its quality. But.. right now it's just not worth the money for me and I'm thinking that maybe owning a E30 would be more of an enjoyment. Taking care of it, driving it outside of the city, not a daily driver since I dont need one.  The selling the car right now part is a bit tricky for me since I got a loan on it for 3 years a head, I've never really sold a car that Ive had a loan on before and can say that I am inexperienced in that matter.  Buying a new 2 series would cost you $600/month for you? That's what I pay for my car currently and its 7 years old. Damn.  Thank you for your well written response, its got me thinking a whole lot."
E30,3a5pgg,karmat0se,2,Thu Jun 18 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"Damnit, now I'm looking at it again and drooling...must...stop.  Leases in the US are kinda cheap right now...they can start at as little as $400/month.  So if I did that and the added insurance I think I could keep it under $600 if you include the $3500 down payment over the length of the lease.  As to selling the new, ish, car...I don't really know how that would work.  http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/car-tips/215870/how-to-sell-a-car-if-the-bank-has-the-title.jsp  I'm assuming your loan isn't through some bank you can just walk through the door to, though.  Certainly find out what your payoff amount is.  Hopefully it isn't more than what you can get for the car.

E30,3a3dou,Twaletta,3,Tue Jun 16 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"The fuel pump is accessed through a panel under the rear seat.  You might have a bad gasket that's letting the gas vapor seep into the cabin.  To check it, first disconnect the battery so you don't blow yourself up.  Then just grab the rear seat cushion and pull it up.  A little force and it will pop out, no screws or anything, just clips.  The fuel pump is on the passenger side underneath a small cover held on with a few screws.  With the cushion off, you should be able to tell if that's where it's coming from pretty easy.  The smell will be a bit heavier without the seat if that's the problem.  It's likely either the gasket that seals the pump from the tank, or possibly a hose/hose clamp coming off the pump itself.  And seriously, disconnect the battery first!   Gas and electricity don't mix, and a frayed wire on the pump can seriously mess up your day."
E30,3a3dou,karmat0se,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, I'll definitely be doing this tomorrow. Will report back!"
E30,3a3dou,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"IMHO, just replace that gasket on the top of the tank. I find when I pop fuel pumps that gasket never goes down right again or is too mooshed out to be effective anymore.  And fwiw, on my old gas tank, the vent line on the top of the tank was rusted and had holes in it... Also when I got the car, the filler inlet on the tank itself had pinholes. I patched that with some aircraft grade sealant and it was fine until the vent lines crapped out.   And FWIW, the Spectra Premium 55L tank is pretty good quality should you decide you need to actually replace the tank. I got mine on RockAuto for a screamin' good price."
E30,3a3dou,Twaletta,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"Best advice here. However, if you can't find the leak at this point, be prepared for a small rusted hole on either the filler pipe (generally on the side facing the inner wheel arch, where mud accumulates), or the stub pipe into the fuel tank.   Unfortunately the only practical solution is to replace the part if that's the case, but definitely check that fuel pump gasket first - it's just a big O-ring, and a replacement costs pennies."
E30,3a3dou,joshamania,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:35:51 2015 UTC,"Didn't even think to consider the filler hose, which is strange because that's the only place I've found any significant rust on my car."

E30,3a01kb,JustinYeeSparkman4,10,Tue Jun 16 04:09:54 2015 UTC,Is it a 318is you are swapping? Don't mean to sound mean but if its a 318is 2door  with a good M42 it will be worth much more then the original engine.
E30,3a01kb,dethkarz,2,Tue Jun 16 04:15:13 2015 UTC,It's not about the worth I just want the m20 because of the additional horsepower and the option to turbocharge it in the future.
E30,3a01kb,rainy0days,12,Tue Jun 16 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"There's next to no reason to go from an M42 to an M20. You can still turbo an M42, and the M42 is lighter overall. You're not going to see any significant advantages to swapping in an M20, just a lighter wallet and a lot of time in your garage. If you want to do a meaningful swap then do an M50 , S52, or literally anything else."
E30,3a01kb,lando9000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:29:05 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I drove a 2.5 the other day (quite a high mileage one)  and was very underwhelmed at the power compared to my M42. Made me bin the idea of swapping in an M20 later.
E30,3a01kb,perfecttttt,5,Tue Jun 16 08:56:24 2015 UTC,"I am with rainy on this one. The M42 is actually a pretty good engine, so it wouldn't be worth it to go to an m20. You should save and go to an M50 instead."
E30,3a01kb,Grrrmachine,5,Tue Jun 16 07:12:15 2015 UTC,"Horsepower isn't the be-all and end-all. The lighter engine, the increased valves per cylinder, different weight setup, transmission gearing and engine management are what make the M42 a real screamer, and far more chuckable on country roads than the comparitively clunky M20 engine.  If you go M20 it will feel sluggish off the line and a lot more nose-heavy, so you should only do this swap if you have the turbo, manifold and engine management solutions all ready figured out. And if that were the case, you certainly wouldn't be asking us about ""basic"" things like an M20 swap."
E30,3a01kb,protomor,3,Tue Jun 16 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, it's not a hard swap. You'll need a drive shaft, trans, engine, harness,ecu, and all the M20 bits. But otherwise, it's pretty plug and play. The only issue is that the C101 connector by the fuse box might be different."
E30,3a01kb,Grrrmachine,2,Tue Jun 16 13:00:01 2015 UTC,I think the M42 engine bay also needs a few brackets fitted in order to mount everything up.
E30,3a01kb,Narek_S,3,Tue Jun 16 14:12:18 2015 UTC,M10 swap seems like a good alternative 😂.
E30,3a01kb,PocketChant,2,Tue Jun 16 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, don't waste your time and money. Either turbo the M42, or swap in a M/S5x"
E30,3a01kb,rb2369,2,Tue Jun 16 21:33:25 2015 UTC,I appreciate the feedback.
E30,3a01kb,rb2369,2,Tue Jun 16 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"Are you the guy who asked about this on the R3v/E30zone FB pages? Either way, I'll say the same thing that I said there. The M20 is a pointless swap from an M42. You'll net maybe 20 HP, and it honestly won't be any better on boost. You're much better off doing as the others said, and swapping in a 24v motor. Otherwise you may as well spend the money/time to modify the M42 and have more power than the M20 would anyway."

Engine/tranny mounts, hoses, gaskets, belts, etc. would qualify.  I got burned with several parts with my first e30 buying cheap rubber.  They just won't last.  You can definitely do upgraded performance versions of bushings, mounts, and hoses, but never generic versions of OEM.  I'm not sure if I would be willing to buy generic shocks, either.  Shocks are one of the most abused parts of the car and the original Boge brand are not that pricey."
E30,39zh1e,Twaletta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:07:59 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily need to buy the ""Genuine BMW"" part. I often figure out who the OEM supplier was for that part and buy the version that doesn't have the roundel stamped on it. Same part, usually cheaper. Over time you'll get a feel for who made what. For example, Lower control arms in the front. The ""Genuine BMW"" part and the Lemforder part are the same thing but one has the BMW roundel on it and costs $20 more.  .. One thing I will say though, for bearings only buy FAG or SKF stuff. Everything eles (especially Meyle) is shit."

E30,39us46,riffraff100214,2,Mon Jun 15 01:13:35 2015 UTC,That's what I did. Bought a manual e30 without knowing how to drive it. Had it checked out first of course. Drove a few laps the night I bought it and took it to work the next morning.
E30,39us46,OldManHenry,6,Mon Jun 15 07:23:54 2015 UTC,"If it's youra first car, and you have a limited budget, and you need an automatic, then there's no point having an E30 - you're taking away all the fun of owning one of these cars. You're too young (i.e. inexperienced) to drive it enthusiastically without putting other road users at risk, you don't have the budget to keep the oily bits running right, and you'll never know the pleasure of throwing it into gear like a sniper loading a bolt-action rifle.  It's perfectly possible to own one of these cars as a young, new driver. But don't kid yourself; if you want safe, reliable, trouble-free motoring on a budget, buy a Honda, not an E30."
E30,39us46,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Jun 15 05:04:39 2015 UTC,"This is tough love right here.

The best way to learn to drive a manual is to buy one and spend a couple of hours learning. It's really not too difficult- and it's so much more fun and engaging!  You gotta buy what you want, what makes you happy.   If you don't buy one now, you'll just be that much older when you finally do."
E30,39us46,inthefriendzone,5,Mon Jun 15 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"Get an manual and teach yourself, as has been said it'll take a couple of hours but it's well worth it.   As for running costs, they're pretty good. Most parts are available cheap online or at the wreckers and they're really easy cars to learn to work on. I got mine as a first car at the start of the year and have been slowly fixing little broken things.   The drivetrains are pretty much unbreakable, so my main issues have been brittle plastic parts and standard consumables/perishables such as bushings, brakes and the clutch (car has 440,000 km's though)  Get yourself a few manuals (the Bentley publishing ones are supposed to be good), a tool kit and you'll pick it up really quickly."

The kilometres and the way the car's been treated all play a huge role in the preservation of a engine.  I recently purchased a 325i with 80,000kms, the body and engine were straight but every now and then a little issue crops up. For example when I purchased it, I had to reconnect the door handle to the latch mechanism, replace a few bulbs and patch an exhaust leak but thats about it. Just small little jobs that only take a few hours to fix.  The big things to look out for are engine knocks, shunting when changing gears or breaking and mechanical grinding or loud whines. They're all an indicator that something costly may soon fail and you should either avoid that car or be willing to spend money on parts.  So in reality, they don't break down a whole lot more than any other car of the era. As far as E30 costs, they're cheap. You can pick up a good example for $5000 and parts are very cheap and easy to come by, but you need to involve yourself in some E30 forums and Facebook pages, it helps to know people who are into them.  I'd also reconsider the decision to get an auto, they're more expensive and complicated to fix. A manual is a great way to learn how your car behaves and how to control it."

E30,39us46,ToastitoTheBandito,2,Mon Jun 15 12:00:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get an automatic E30 unless you plan a swap or physically unable to drive a stick. It's not worth it and it won't be nearly as fun to drive. If you do get one, get a manual and put a clutch stop to help you out. Teach yourself. It's not that difficult.  My advice to you though, would be not to get one as a first vehicle. If you aren't working on it yourself, you're going to pay a good bit more than a bunch of other cars. It's not more expensive than a current BMW, but it's a good bit more expensive than most vehicles its age and some that are newer.  Again, don't buy an automatic unless your intent is to do a swap. It's very uneconomical on fuel in auto form and it's not worth much that way either."
E30,39us46,beefcakez,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:41:34 2015 UTC,How difficult/expensive would a swap be?
E30,39us46,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:06:57 2015 UTC,If you have the tools it will be the cost of a transmission and some seals likely. If you don't I wouldn't recommend that route. It is much easier to buy a manual. The cost is hard to predict. It is not a beginner job.

But $4k is a lot for a car sitting on bog-standard 14"" bottletops, which needs welding (that rust will be a lot worse than it looks right now), and there's no mention of any service history or, crucially, that the timing belt has been replaced.  It looks alright in the pics, but there are no engine bay shots, and no close up pictures of the roof skin, the wheel arches or the rear valance (all rust hotspots). But it does look clean and tidy, so you never know, it might not be that bad.

E30,39e5xm,kaihau,5,Thu Jun 11 03:32:58 2015 UTC,"You should buy an E30 on the condition of the shell, and the shell alone. The oily bits can be swapped over in a matter of hours, and trim can be sourced from a junker for pennies, but rust, dent and paint defects universally cost time and $$$ to fix so that should be your buying criteria.  If you've owned a 325i then you will find a 318i underwhelming, particularly one with an M10 unit. But even if it's a non-runner, $500 for the shell and $500 for a replacement engine will make a very pleasant E30, whether it's an M20B25 or an M42B18. You'll certaintly not find a rust-free running E30 for that sort of price these days.  And that's an AFM, not a MAF. Subtle difference, but an important one, and it's broken because someone's tried reseting the sweep arm to solve a potential running issue. It's a symptom of the engine problem, not the cause."

I'm really looking for a reliable car, or something that needs minimal work. This one needs a few thousand of work I think.  I've also heard the 318 4 cylinders have weaker frames than the 325 6 cylinders. Do you know if this is true?"
E30,39e5xm,Grrrmachine,3,Thu Jun 11 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"You won't find a sub-$1000 E30 that's reliable. Despite being well-made, most are well overdue for suspension and brake overhauls now, so anyone who's done that work will want to recoup the cost.  In terms of shells, there is not an iota of difference between 4- and 6-cylinder cars. However, the front struts are bigger on 325i's to cope with the heavier engine."
E30,39aor9,ryu34,13,Wed Jun 10 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"Before I give you my opinion on chipping, let's explain the E30's engine management a bit:  Motronic Overview  Motronic 1.3 is a primitive system to control fuelling and ignition. Based on a map inside the chip, it reads the amount of incoming air from the AFM and the temp of that air to calculate air volume. Based on the stoichiometric ratio, it then pulses the injectors open for a predefined amount of time to allow fuel into the cylinders.  Depending on the age of your car and your state's emissions requirements, you may also have a lambda switch to measure the exhaust. If the switch detects no unburnt fuel, it increases the injector open time until the switch detects fuel, then it leans the fuel back again - over and over.  However, the system has NO idea how much you're opening the throttle, although it does know that the car's not idling and when you have your foot to the floor (called WOT or Wide Open Throttle) - this is because the TPS under your throttle body is just a switch (or really, two switches), not a sensor. The system also knows when the engine is not at running temp, so that it can give you a richer mix for cold starts, and it also manages the ignition advance/retard using a best-guess scenario of engine speed and TDC position of piston 1.  This means the system is incredibly dumb. It doesn't really know how much throttle you're using, or whether it's getting pre-detonation (knocking) from incorrect ignition timing and bad fuel mixes, and the lambda is so crude that Motronic 1.3 is essentially an Open Loop system - it has pretty much zero info on how it's running, and therefore can't adjust itself to improve things.  Becase of that, BMW make the maps in the ECU a little bit conservative; they figure it's better to have a map that'll keep your engine running at both sea level and in the mountains, in winter and in summer, on a car that hasn't been serviced for a while, with no long-term risks to the running of the engine. And considering the primitiveness of the technology, they eked the absolute best they could out of the system.  Chip Operation  So when you buy a chip, how could it possibly improve things?  Well, what many chip coders assume is that if your foot is at WOT it means you want the full beans, maximum fat with an energy drink on the side, so in the WOT-part of the fuel map they crank the injector pulse open as much as they dare and fuck the consequences. Trial and error (and gas analysers if you're really lucky) tells chip tuners when that leads to engine flooding, so then they trim the maps back until the car seems to work. More fuel = more power, right?  Generally, yes. On a cool day at sea level with an engine fresh from the factory (or at least identical to the one the chip was written on) you may see a modest benefit of 1-3hp. But in any other scenario, such as a rainy day or at a different altitude or with the absolute tiniest of air leaks, you'll just have fuel pissing out of the exhaust valves and sizzling on your catalytic converter, thereby destroying it, and there's fuck-all your lambda can do to stop it because it doesn't have that capability. And even this scenario assumes that your injectors are pumping out the amount of fuel the chip's map is telling it to, but you can't be sure because the engine doesn't know - it has no feedback on the flowrate through the injectors. Therefore if one injector is sticky and not opening, or worse, stuck open and not spraying properly (which is pretty much guaranteed on a 25-year-old engine), all your chip has done is increased your fuel usage and reduced your engine life, for absolutely zero power gains.  Conclusion  There's scope in the original Motronic 1.3 map for the most modest of power gains, or even economy gains if that's what you want. But to release them you need to take YOUR car to a dyno place with an exhaust gas analyser, and have a Motronic expert sit and configure YOUR map for YOUR engine based on your requirements. The room for improvement from any off-the-shelf chip is pratically nil, diminishing exponentially as the engine ages.  Bare in mind that with a more agressive cam, some straight headers, a big bore throttle body AND a chip, Alpina - whose entire business model is about getting more performance from BMW engines - only managed to get 10bhp more from an M20B25. If you think there are people out there who can somehow match that performance without the mechanical requirements, or have found a way to make the Motronic brain (conceived in the late 70s, don't forget) more adaptable, then you clearly don't deserve to keep your money and ought to pass it on to the chip seller in exchange for a shiny silicon caterpillar.  And don't get me started on pod filters."
E30,39aor9,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Jun 10 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"Are they really bullshit though? There are plenty of dyno graphs showing repeatable performance on stock engines. There are reputable chip makers like Jim C, Mark D, and Dinan who have spent a significant amount of time making daily drivable chips tuned for unmodified cars. Sure, they're in the realm of 8-10 rwhp and ft/lbs peak, but that isn't so bad on a car that makes something like 140 at the wheels stock, not to mention the extra redline that you can pick up.   If anything, they're simply taking advantage of modern fuels to get reliable improvements. By stepping up from 87 to 89 and 91 octane, there are reliable and repeatable gains to be had.   Now, my 325is is running on a stock 173 ECU, but I've got a JimC chip in my 318is, and it's quite an improvement, with no downside (so far) apart from needing higher octane fuel."
E30,39aor9,RusstyC,2,Wed Jun 10 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"a) 8-10 rwhp from a chip is not going to happen. See my point on Alpina. b) Yes, octane can allow you to retard the spark a bit, gain a little more compression and boost the power output. But without knock sensors you are also increasing the risk of pre-detenation and increased engine damage. Bare in mind, BMW decreased the compression in the M20B25 during its lifespan. Your choice. c) Increasing the red line is a nice advantage, but bare in mind the M20 is quite susceptible to valve float, so you don't want to be redlining it very often anyway.  The ""driveability"" chips you mention are not about power gains in terms of total BHP, but about shifting the torque curve so that you've got your grunt sooner, at the expense of fuel economy and feeling a bit out-of-breath at the top end. These are the ones that feel like they've improved the power output.  As for your 318iS; that runs Motronic 1.7 which is a fraction more sophisticated than the setup mentioned above.  IMO there really isn't any point chipping any BMW ECU until you get to Motronic 3.1, which is M5x territory."
E30,39aor9,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Jun 10 19:34:39 2015 UTC,As for your 318iS; that runs Motronic 1.7 which is a fraction more sophisticated than the setup mentioned above.

How did they get red plastidip all over the engine bay and the headlights, andstill end up with such shit coverage on the outside?  I wouldn't bother. Even if the mechanicals are alright (and judging by the overall care of the car, they won't be), that shell is in such desperate need that it'll be a complete money pit. As an example, the trim around the rear windows is missing - there are four holes per side there, which are now dumping water into each trunk pocket, where it will be sitting, festering and rusting tasty holes through your floorpan, rear valance and inner wheel arches.   It's well-specced (13-button OBC, aircon, cruise control) but the fancy extras are offset by the old 14"" steel wheels which are guaranteed to be the wrong offset for an iX, the torn leather, and the godawful piss-yellow lights (which are so tasteless that the French like them).

E30,394jjs,Firebat-15,5,Tue Jun 9 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"I looked into this extensively since I don't want to spend a ton on a paint job but have steered away from it.   Here's why I decided not to go through with it:  The rear quarter panels and the c-pillar are one piece, which is no big deal because that's how it is on practically every single car. But the tricky thing with the E30 is that the rear quarter panel and c-pillar are also joined with the roof and a-pillars with no cut off. So what you would need is basically one giant piece of vinyl in which would literally need to be large enough to cover the entire top and rear quarter panels...but this size doesn't exist. The largest size that most vinyl distributers offer are 5 feet high and will go to 24 + feet long and they they really pricey at lengths longer that 6 feet long. I'm sure if you really beg and search everywhere you can probably find someone with a large enough vinyl, but its unlikely, and if you do it would be just as much as a paint job.   Now, you can overlap separate pieces of 5 x whatever vinyls so that you may cover everything, but then it'll look botched and unprofessional. What I would suggest is looking into dipyourcar's new high gloss top coat which is most likely the route I will be going. If you decide to wrap your car then please share with us!

E30,38wkdv,russianprofessional,5,Sun Jun 7 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"No way it's 85, unless they welded whole rear and panels. And there is the mtech?"
E30,38wkdv,russianprofessional,3,Sun Jun 7 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"technical papers say 85, VIN checks says 85..  about that Mtech.. well i am not sure to be fair, previous owner told me, I dont know enough about e30 to tell what is mtech what is not.. the vin check says M sports steering wheel, mtech back spoiler, mtech chassis.. sorry if the tittle is misleading, sadly there is no way to edit it"
E30,38wkdv,russianprofessional,3,Sun Jun 7 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"I can see two options here: either it was a total wreck so they redo the whole body or someone took nice ""stolen"" '89 and welded VIN from his wrecked '85.

I hope:D"
E30,38wkdv,russianprofessional,3,Sun Jun 7 15:26:28 2015 UTC,And he didn't tell you that body don't match the year in papers? It's THE first thing to notice and to ask seller about.  Article about the convertion: http://www.e30zone.net/e30zonewiki/index.php/Convert_a_pre-facelift_to_a_facelift  Check for mentioned things on your car. Also look for a VIN sticker under rear seats and on engine ECU. BTW if the engine is m40 it was also not available in 85.
E30,38wkdv,Ninja_Guin,2,Sun Jun 7 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"maybe it went through such facelift conversion before the repaint? I will check the engine and VINs for sure, thanks"
E30,38wkdv,Ninja_Guin,2,Sun Jun 7 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"There would be enough evidence of such conversion and no one do it just for fun. If you can send more pictures I can pinpoint some of them, but from the one you posted it's just whole car redone. I oversaw one such conversion project and it surely leave some hints just because of sheer amount of work it requires. BTW paint doesn't look 23yo either, for me like 5yo."
E30,38wkdv,AintNoJiveTurkey,2,Sun Jun 7 17:11:06 2015 UTC,VIN number on e30 can be easily cut and welded in with no or minor signs. As far as I know the process costs 500-1000 EUR.  I personally saw 3 cars with messed up VINs and it's not obvious if it's done right.

E30,38o6i2,MidshipRunaboutSW20,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it'll be intimidating the first time. Just take it step by step and follow the directions, you'll be fine."
E30,38o6i2,MidshipRunaboutSW20,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:45:48 2015 UTC,I've done valve adjustments on DOHC 4 cyclinder engines with shimmed lifters. Was just curious if I can easily get rid of my valve noise in my m20. Sounds easy enough.
E30,38o6i2,Twaletta,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"Adjusting the valves is a pretty simple process.  If you've done something similar in the past, it won't be bad for you.  Just want to point out, though, that while you may reduce the valve ticking noise slightly, it's unlikely it will go away.  It's just what M20s do.  Learn to love it.  If you aren't running a heavier oil (which you should) like 15w50 or 20w50, valve noise is also going to be a tad louder.  It should also be noted that the injectors on these cars also make a ticking kind of noise that is easily confused with valves."
E30,38o6i2,rustede30,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:20:42 2015 UTC,What was the cost? Or more correctly what will be the end cost?   I think that when my m20 goes I'm gonna do the s5x swap instead of fixing it. In the end i don't think it's going to be worth it to me to keep the 12 valves.

E30,38nzuf,ryu34,3,Fri Jun 5 13:23:51 2015 UTC,You can't just slap on plastic bumpers without modifying them to fit with models '88 and prior. Euro bumpers are pretty pricey so if you're tight on a budget then you can always tuck your bumpers which look pretty good imo.
E30,38nzuf,tokeonthis,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:43:39 2015 UTC,Is it a relatively simple process or is it something I should have a professional take care of?
E30,38nzuf,Twaletta,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:12:14 2015 UTC,"The ECS euro bumper kit claims to be a direct fit without modification.  Frankensteining a set of plastic bumpers is not such a simple process and can be a daunting task without some bodywork experience.  Tucking the bumpers isn't that hard.  The reason for the aluminum bumpers is that the US had strict specifications for what a bumper should be able to handle without damage.  They required it to survive a 5 mph impact, and BMW put small shock absorbers behind the aluminum to take the hit.  Tucking the bumper is just a matter of pulling it off, drilling a hole in each piston, and collapsing it to your preferred length.  Drive a heavy metal screw in to lock the shock in place and reassemble.  The only downside to this is it removes the cars 5 mph impact protection.  I tucked mine as part of a rebuild after hitting someone at about 10 mph.  Honestly, if I had tucked them before the accident the car might not have survived, or at least would have had more extensive damage.  Tucking is a slight risk, yes, but anything above 10 mph will probably either kill the car, or have insurance total it anyway.  This is also assuming that these bumper shocks, which are all at least 27 years old, still function properly to begin with.  One of mine didn't collapse, and I had to rebuild the mounting bracket that got pushed back instead of the shock."
E30,38nzuf,tokeonthis,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"with models '88 and prior   Are you sure? 1988 is a transition year. Mine has early model bumpers, but late model everything else (arches, tails, etc). I've read that the plastic bumpers bolt straight on to 1988s with no modification.   But I agree, with OP's early model, plastic bumpers require a lot of modification."

I think you might be best trying to find someone salvaging their post-facelift e30 so you can cut off the rear valance and then weld it on to yours.   In the meantime, you can tuck your bumpers so they don't look like a friggin duck bill. Also, color match painting them to your body color looks pretty good."
E30,38nzuf,Twaletta,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry to ask but if you didn't like the bumpers on the car (biggest difference between e30s) why did you buy the car?

ASA AR1's are cheap-ish and can be bought from TireRack.com.  If you don't mind heavier wheels, then Style 5's (two piece) look killer on e30's.

You're going to want to get the Bentley manual, it's $50, but it will literally tell you everything you need to know about your car. You'll also want to get comfortable with google. Searching for ""e30 coolant gauge not working"" led me to this post: http://www.bimmerforums.com/forum/showthread.php?1273135-Water-temp-gauge-problem  With this advice:   With the engine not running, disconnect the electrical connector from the temperature sending unit. With the ignition on, use a jumper wire to briefly touch the connector terminal to ground, simulating a high engine temperature signal to the gauge. If the gauge needle moves upward, the sending unit is faulty. If the needle still does not move, either the wire to the gauge is broken or the gauge is faulty.    That advice was pulled from the Bentley manual.  TBH, my money is on your temp sending unit being bad."

E30,38etrl,Sinrulez,3,Wed Jun 3 19:14:26 2015 UTC,You might need to do a valve adjustment. Make sure you're also running the recommended weight oil for your climate. M20s are noisy motors though.

E30,38etrl,seymoredjibouti,2,Wed Jun 3 20:16:23 2015 UTC,Mine also sounds like this. Apparently valve adjustments are easy on these motors.
E30,38etrl,MidshipRunaboutSW20,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:09:08 2015 UTC,I noticed there was a ticking sound coming from my engine bay. And as far as I can tell with my knowledge it's coming from my engine? I thought it may have been the heat shield or my fan.  Any suggestions on what to do? Send it to shop to check the engine?
E30,38etrl,Twaletta,2,Wed Jun 3 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, ticking valves are par for the course on M20s.  Most of them do have at least some.  If your valve clearances are too large it can make it a bit louder.  A valve adjustment is a pretty cheap project assuming the rockers are within spec.  I've adjusted the valves on four different E30s and haven't yet needed to replace any.  Also, in my experience with the same four cars, switching to a nice synthetic oil has had a noticeable effect in valve noise.  I could actually listen to it happening right after starting the car and revving it directly from the throttle body a few times.  But really, M20s tick.  It's just what they do."
E30,38etrl,Frizkie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"The PO has had the engine run on 5W30, so thats whats its running on atm. Is switching to a different oil better for the engine? Let's say 5w40 or even 10w40?  Valve adjustment sounds pretty straight forward. I'll look around for someone to do that for me. Maybe that helps."
E30,38etrl,Twaletta,4,Wed Jun 3 20:31:16 2015 UTC,Lots of people use 20W50 nonsynthetic.
E30,38etrl,Cat4lyst,2,Wed Jun 3 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"I usually run 15w50 here in north Texas where we generally get at least 30 days of 100+ temps, and almost twice that is not unheard of.  I think BMW actually suggests 20w50, but honestly it's hard to find 20w50 in anything but 1qt bottles, which really jacks the price up.  I've never had a problem with it, though.    If I lived somewhere with really cold winters I would probably do something like 10w40 in the winter, but stick with 15w50 in the summer.  The heavier oil also burns less and is less prone to leaking with aging seals and gaskets.  I would be paranoid running 5w30.  It just seems to thin for my liking.  I wouldn't rush out and change it immediately, but it wouldn't be a bad idea at the next interval.    If you aren't running synthetic, I would also switch it over as well.  If you change it yourself, the extra cost for something like Mobil1 is almost negligible.  Synthetic also burns less and degrades slower.  Wal-Mart usually has 15w50 in 5qt jugs for under $30, which is enough for one service.  I usually run about 10k miles on an oil change with synthetic with no issues, and the only reason I don't do 15k is that I don't trust a filter that long.  I had an '99 323i that you could change the filter without dumping the all the oil, and would run 15k with a filter change at 7500.  For a filter I run a Wix brand which are made in Poland.  I don't know if they still are, but Wix air and oil filters were OEM BMW for years, and usually cost half the price of ""premium"" brands.  The only brand I will outright avoid, though, are Frams.  They are just really cheaply made."
E30,38etrl,dethkarz,2,Wed Jun 3 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you need to get that oil out of there. It's too thin. Mine was the same when bought from po. I had signs of bearing damage when I changed it, gold flakes. Run the 20w-50. It really quiets the tick. The tick is also normal, these engines sound like that. Also valve adjustment just to be sure, this is an every 10k to 15k maintenance procedure."
E30,38etrl,Grundy9137,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what mine sounds like, I've adjusted the valves and it seems if anything it got noisier.

E30,38etrl,tom_echo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot of material rubbing in addition to the ticking.

E30,38dx62,DeepMidWicket,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want.   I'd recommend upgrading to a solid bushing at the very least. Whether you want poly or rubber is up to you. I can't say about the poly ones as I've not put them in mine. I stupidly put in oem e30 bushings last time.   If you want some more caster and high speed stability at the sacrifice of a [slightly] harsher ride, you can go with some solid control arm bushings from Treehouseracing or maybe bimmerworld. They're not cheap, but I've heard your steering is razor sharp afterwards.   Hopefully someone else can chime in on the ride quality of poly bushings or on the solid control arm bushings."
E30,38bq7j,JustinYeeSparkman4,3,Wed Jun 3 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"Requires modification of rear plastic bumper (needs to be cut then plastic welded back together), needs paint, need bumpers in fair condition.   All can be had at different costs depending on your resourcefulness.  Don't forget to pad that cost with new bits and pieces that might be needed."
E30,38bq7j,single-needle,3,Wed Jun 3 04:53:05 2015 UTC,I thought the modification was only for cars prior to 1988. 1988 doesn't need any modification as the rear arches are the same design as the plastic bumpers in the later years.
E30,38bq7j,Beej336,2,Wed Jun 3 05:54:01 2015 UTC,All cars after 88 came with plastic. No modification from plastic bumpers to plastic bumpers.
E30,38bq7j,single-needle,2,Wed Jun 3 08:08:41 2015 UTC,I think hes talking about swapping the bumpers specifically on the 88. 88 was a weird year where they had short metal bumpers but the body is the same (arches) so late model plastic bumpers are just an unbolt and bolt on affair.

E30,389ajc,Twaletta,10,Tue Jun 2 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"It is an LS1 and T56. It does change the car completely. Not just making it loud and fast, and fun, but it is more violent, and less refined.  The power doesn't come on at any point. It is just there.  The brakes are not sufficient anymore. You have to baby first and second gear.  I also did the E46 rack swap after the motor swap and that helped a lot. I did not put in many miles with the v8 and the original steering but it felt like so many old muscle cars I've had. Lumbering and lazy.  Now it feels like a ex MMA fighter that also has a meth addiction.

I'm thinking about buying an e30 and doing a swap, but I wouldn't want to do it, if it ruins the character and charm if the car, If you could go back in time would you do the swap again? Is it too much power?"
E30,389ajc,Twaletta,2,Wed Jun 3 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"I used the kit made by Garrett and his dad   http://e30ls1.com/e30-ls1-info/  There is a huge write up on r3vlimited  I found all the parts to be strong and well made. I didn't use their radiator mount. I cut the bottom out of the support and had a big dual pass radiator made then made a mount to slip into the core support and tie it all back together.  ( it takes 10 minutes of driving before the fan ever kicks on)   This allowed me to use a puller fan so I've got tons of room in front of radiator for an oil cooler and AC compressor and another fan maybe.   I think some of my issues with ""refinement"" I could address.   I used a single 2 in 2 out flow master.   I love cars but it is too loud for me.   I may add some hawk pads and new rotors, I think that will help with the braking.   I did keep the abs.    It has more power than it can use right now. I've got a 205 tire all around. And it is not enough. I would roll the fenders and focus on doing everything possible to get the widest tires possible   It is not my daily driver and has always just been a toy for me so these issues don't ruin it for me just change it.  Is a practical thing to do? No... Would I do it again?  I don't know. I spent a fortune building it. I had a ton of fun with my friends.  It was a good experience, and the car is extremely fun to drive.   Edit: Grammer and content"

No large amounts of computer stuff and bus systems and all that jazz.   Swapped cars are a mixed bag. Some things are easier, some things are harder. An oil change on an M5x motor is stupid simple compared to an M20. Pulling the oil pan? Yea... no thanks."
E30,387j4g,protomor,2,Tue Jun 2 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the owner swapped it from an 04 ZHP. He originally bought it to be a daily/track car but decided he'd rather have a two cars."
E30,387j4g,protomor,9,Tue Jun 2 12:43:45 2015 UTC,Damn. That's very rare for a swap.
E30,387j4g,SelfMastered,4,Tue Jun 2 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"No, i bought it as my first car and did a lot of work on in my self, never having worked on a car or motorcycle before. Do keep in mind that if the car has been sitting for long periods of time, most bolts will be seized and you will need a lot of patience to get them free. Aside from that, make sure you have enough space and tools to do the job, as certain things can't be done with jack stands if your bolts are seized."
E30,387j4g,Twaletta,3,Tue Jun 2 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"No? Really?    The general design of this car is so amazingly simple.  It's what makes this car so appealing to me.  Pretty much any front wheel drive car is going to be more difficult to work on, so right off the bat it's easier than probably 75% of the cars out there.  It has a huge engine bay relative to the size of the motor which gives you plenty of room to swing a wrench.  The suspension is a simple, tried and true setup that is easily modified.  Basic maintenance, like the timing belt, cooling system, valve adjustments, etc are a breeze.  Spark plugs and wires are a fifteen minute job.  Sometimes I'll even pull the radiator out when it isn't strictly necessary because it takes 15 minutes and can make things simpler.  Parts are also reasonably priced and easily sourced.    Yeah, they are older cars so you do run into some stuck bolts and such, but honestly, any car more than ten years old will give you those issues.  Keep some PB Blaster, a tap, die, and extractor set around and you can get past most of them easily enough.  If you look around and find a nice example with minimal body rust then chances are you won't have as many issues with rusted mechanicals.  I would consider the e30 to be a very easy car to work on.  It's definitely better than my first Honda Accord I had back in the day, a friends V6 mustang, and most other cars I've worked on or helped work on.  I learned most of what I know about car repair on an e30."

E30,387j4g,Twaletta,2,Wed Jun 3 17:29:09 2015 UTC,Well that is definitely nice to know! Thankfully it seems to be in pretty good mechanical condition as the motor was swapped from an 04 ZHP.
E30,387j4g,beefcakez,2,Tue Jun 2 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"I said this in a different comment as well but that m54, while a blast to drive, will somewhat negate a lot of what makes an e30 an easy car to work on.  It will also be harder to work on than that m54 would be in its natural environment due to custom fitments and such.  Engine swaps generally seem to have higher a likelihood of persistent gremlins as well, making them not necessarily the best choice for an inexperienced mechanic."
E30,387j4g,Twaletta,3,Tue Jun 2 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as non-engine stuff, it's all pretty easy. You can do almost all repairs with a simple tool set and some ingenuity. If you're in the U.S. you can rent specialty tools from your local auto parts store (Auto Zone, Oreilly, etc) for the more difficult work.   There will be electrical gremlins since everything is old as hell. However, it's all pretty accessible and there are some wiring books for this car specifically out there for download.   No idea about that m54 though."
E30,387j4g,beefcakez,3,Tue Jun 2 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"They are easy to work on, but half of that ease comes from the simplicity of the engine.  That m54 is a really nice engine, but it is much more complex than an m20 because of all the electronics.  Having owned an e46 with an m50 I would say that most non-engine work on it isn't that much different than an e30.    I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, an e30 is an easy car to work on.  However, that m54 replaces the primary factor that makes it easy to work on, with something that isn't quite so easy."
E30,387j4g,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:26:14 2015 UTC,Exactly right.   All of the electrical problems you'd most likely have with the e30 come from the M20 wiring harness.
E30,387j4g,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:30:49 2015 UTC,What are some general tools I should get and keep handy? I think I might look for a manual for one of the cars the M54 originally came in.
E30,387j4g,badharrow,4,Tue Jun 2 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"Some staple items you'll need:   Metric socket sets - short and deep sets  Breaker bar and ratchets  Metric wrenches - short and long sets  Torque wrench Screwdrivers    Some of the other work may require some specialty tools for things like suspension work:    bearing puller/pusher (can rent from auto parts store)  ball joint separator (either pickle fork or a pinch type one you can get from Harbor Freight) for front strut repair you'll want a spring compressor (again, another rental item)   I'm probably missing some things, but really this is all you should need to do most repairs. If you tell us what the repairs are, we'll probably be able to tell you exactly what you'll need.   Edit: Removed valvetrain adjustment tools since OP has an M54. You m20 guys need some gap measuring tools though."

E30,387j4g,username2110,2,Tue Jun 2 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"No problem. If you want to make it really simple, go look for a 'Mechanics Tool Set' and a screwdriver set (unfortunately, some don't come with this). It'll have almost everything you'll need to get started. You won't have to go and buy SAE tools separately as this will have both metric and SAE sets.   I'm not sure how much you're willing to spend. I've been accumulating my tools since I was 10 years old (27 now) so I have a couple thousand dollars worth of tools if not more. Once I have a garage I'm going to buy a heck of a lot more. You can never have too many tools! ;)   Oh, just sayin', a metal toolbox with drawers is the bees knees."

E30,386k8f,Goner10,0,Tue Jun 2 20:48:45 2015 UTC,The e motor is actually great for any driving situations on the road. The wide their curve allows the driver to leave the car in third gear on a back road and focus on braking and cornering. In stock form none of these cars have enough power. The e is certainly not just a cruiser. I can keep up with my friend in his 2013 wrx on most back roads in my stock 325e.  I think the price of this case is probably a bit high but it really depends on your part of the country. It's likely a fun car that will last you a long time.
E30,386k8f,e3027,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"The eta engine really works well for driving around town with lots of low end torque.  When I had one I didn't even bother with first gear half the time and started off in second.    Nothing against your friend, but he must not be that good of a driver.  A WRX should be able to waste an E30 in pretty much every situation.  In a straight line they are faster than any stock E30.  It would also be very difficult to make an E30 handle as well as a WRX, no matter how much you try and upgrade the suspension.  They are extremely nimble little machines and Subaru's AWD system really shines."

OK, checked the idle speed adjuster, OK. Changed the ignition distributor. nothing helped At this point I was getting pissed. So we blamed it on a airleak at the intake System. But we searched by spraying igniteable gas around the intake and nothing happend. We took it apart, and here comes the fail. We only took apart the top piece, reassambled it, then a little more and more. If we just ripped of the whole thing we would have seen it at once. The sealing gasket between the engine block and the intake was ripped apart.  If we had checked this at the beginning instead of changing parts wildly it would have took us maybe 5 hours and little money.  We spent like 40hours in 5 weeks. 300 € on different parts.

I wasn't much of a mechanic at the time and my only experience with car repair was some spark plugs and an ignition coil on my first car, a Honda Accord.  That 325 needed a new center support bearing, but being not so mechanically inclined I didn't think that weird thumping noise when I first accelerated was a big deal since it went away after 10 mph.   One day I'm driving and the thumping suddenly gets much, much worse and after about 1/4 mile I hear this awful clanging sound.  Then I hear two or three really powerful thumps and the sound of something metal hitting the ground.  I got out of the car and found two halves of a weird metal ring under the car.  But the thumping stopped. Being stupid about cars I thought that it was awesome that it stopped.  Fast forward two months and I'm clipping along at about 50 mph when suddenly the car went nuts.  The thumping came back with a vengeance, followed by a god-awful metallic clanging.  It sounded, and felt, like the car was trying to tear itself apart.  I felt one huge bang and the car coasted to a stop along with a rhythmic ""ding-ding-ding-ding"".  The car wouldn't move, it would only give me that dinging.  I found out that my driveshaft had snapped in half at the u-joints because the CSB had failed.  The first incident was the CSB tearing itself off the car, and had I actually paid attention at that point, I could have gotten away with a $50 fix.  Since I let it go another two months I wound up spending about $600 bucks on a full driveshaft.    After the fact I looked it up online and realized that a CSB is such a common problem  and that ten minutes of proactive research would have saved me $500 bucks.  This was the catalyst that got me into working on cars, so I guess there is a silver lining, but I learned an expensive lesson about ignoring problems.  I was stupid when I was 21."

Sensors, filters, injectors, everything was getting replaced.   I eventually got around to replacing the thermostat. I screwed it all back together, poured in the coolant, and it was leaking like a sieve.  I panicked, and tightened the thermostat housing bolts. It didn't completely stop the leak, so I tightened more. Snap, off came a full third of the housing, and there went a bucket of coolant all over the lane!   Turned out I had sat the thermostat backwards in the housing when I replaced it.   Slightly off topic, but another great screwup was on my old Camry. I was even more of a newbie at that point. I tried to change the air filter, and didn't realize the AFM plug had a spring quick disconnect. It's almost identical to the E30. I unscrewed the entire plug housing from the side of the AFM, and pulled. Out came a half dozen wires, still attached to their contacts! Completely borked the sensor."

E30,38670l,davvik,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:25:28 2015 UTC,Depends if your friend is at all mechanically inclined... a convertible with winter tires on it is kind of a red flag though.

E30,383a9m,ericxfresh,6,Mon Jun 1 15:26:03 2015 UTC,Way too high for an m10 e30. The trunk is misaligned so I'm going to call bs on the no rust part (look under the spare tire). I'd keep looking.
E30,383a9m,rustede30,3,Mon Jun 1 18:12:59 2015 UTC,Salvage titles can be nightmares of legalizing depending on the type of title and your local laws.  That alone makes the car worth maybe $1500 max.
E30,383a9m,Twaletta,0,Mon Jun 1 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm in Kansas and have a few friends who own tow companies so titles don't really mean anything to me. I know other states are way more difficult with titles than Kansas."

E30,383a9m,Twaletta,2,Tue Jun 2 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"The salvage title is a red flag. The M10 is also a red flag. Look for an eta, or a 318 with the M42. Great little motor!"
E30,383a9m,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,2,Mon Jun 1 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"The front quarter of the car, including strut tower and rad support had to be replaced.  It's got drum rear brakes. It's got the m10 engine, not the m42.  The seats are worn, and they're mismatched with the interior.  This wouldn't be a problem if the asking price was $1500, or maybe even 2000, but he wants 4500."
E30,383a9m,RusstyC,2,Mon Jun 1 19:11:14 2015 UTC,The price seems too high for a car with a salvage title. I would never trust someone on Craigslist on why their car has a salvage title

E30,37z6ae,LincArro,3,Sun May 31 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to sound rude, but is she actually helping in any way? I understand rally is a thought-intensive sport, but this track seemed pretty straightforward.   I would really like someone to clarify what she is actually doing, without being condescending, please."
E30,37z6ae,ggill1313,6,Sun May 31 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Think about it like this:  This is a relatively simple run and the driver is probably looking at it as practicing/training.  It helps prepare him for the real complex stuff that he would encounter elsewhere.  Part of that practice is being able to follow the instructions of the co-driver.  Also, even if she isn't 100% necessary on this track, she also needs the practice and conditioning to stay at her peak.  The two have to be able to work together as a single unit and this helps them stay on the same page.  They can later talk about things they can do differently to make the info flow more smoothly between them.  Even if he didn't really need her on this run, they still need to practice/train as a team."
E30,37z6ae,Twaletta,3,Sun May 31 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"We actually did 8 different stages this rally and you are only allowed to predrive the stages 2 times using a normal road car on slow speed. So even though this stage looks pretty straight forward, there is no way I can remember all the corners for every stage by driving over it slowly 2 times the day before.  It is pretty important to know how sharp a corner is going to be and what distance there is going to be to the next corner to determine where you should brake.  So how we normally do it, first time we drive the stage I tell what notes she needs to write down, second time she reads back what was written down to check if it is correct allowing for some small corrections if needed.  And then the next day you have to drive as fast as possible right away, no practice at speed. You have to be fast right away."
E30,37z6ae,ggill1313,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I guess that makes sense, that when it is competitive, you need every bit of help you could get, and the preparation for entering and preparing for turns/corners would help."

It's hot.  I don't want the reminder.  I know already.  I'll gladly take all this rain we're getting now over the coming summer.  I can sympathize.

E30,38051w,jrodp1,2,Mon Jun 1 00:39:12 2015 UTC,I keep mine on time. How do you reset the mpg?
E30,38051w,jrodp1,2,Mon Jun 1 04:09:44 2015 UTC,On the AVG MPG and AVG MPH you reset the data by holding the SET-RES button down for a couple seconds.  An interesting thing is that you can use this to get a (usually) more accurate reading of your actual speed by looking at what it shows immediately after resetting it.  It's always been a lot closer to the speeds I've gotten read from those big digital display radars you see around school zones and such.  My speedo shows about 5 mph higher than my actual speed in the 65-70 mph range.

E30,38051w,davvik,2,Mon Jun 1 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Just an alarm a couple minutes before the hour.  According to the owners manual it is to remind you to tune your radio to your news station to get the latest weather reports.  Typical German OCD engineering.

E30,3807ig,protomor,9,Sun May 31 23:27:11 2015 UTC,It's not manual
E30,3807ig,RackedE30,5,Sun May 31 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others, it's pretty much just boring to drive. There's literally no reason to not to. Can't drive one? Doesn't matter. E30's are some of the most forgiving cars for learning stick on, and there's a reason why so many of them are still around. I learned to drive in my dad's 85 325 (long gone ;_;) and it's still the most fun, to date, I've had driving a car. I hopped in a friend's auto E30 and while it was still an E30, it was just point A to point B. Stick makes it a point A to point Z with a whole bunch of fun in between. Plus, you've got a built in anti theft device."

Like protomor said, factory hatching on the cylinders and all that.  Also had a 180k 2.5L that was just as nice.  The m20 is an amazingly robust motor."
E30,37xrw3,Twaletta,2,Sun May 31 21:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yessir, those motors are bulletproof if maintained properly.  My dad always brags about how his ""little old bimmer"" can still break traction shifting into third gear."
E30,37xrw3,jbmonheim,2,Sun May 31 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"There is something to be said for Mobil 1, though.  I've changed four e30s over to it from normal oil, and every time it has a noticeable effect.  When I first started them up every one had a easily noticed change in just the way they sounded.  As you blip the throttle a few times you can actually hear the valves quiet down and the ticking smoothing out a bit as the oil makes its way into the channels.  It's almost magical.  Maybe it's just any good synthetic and not specifically Mobil 1, but still, synthetic is the way to go."
E30,37xrw3,JamesFuckinLahey,2,Sun May 31 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's been running synthetic since he got it running."
E30,37xrw3,jbmonheim,4,Sun May 31 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"Although they didn't factor in the additional wear of starting and stoping the engine hundreds of thousands of times, this is still impressive. BMW's drive trains are bulletproof."
E30,37xrw3,--------Link--------,1 point,Sun May 31 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This test (as far as I can tell) only captured the high cycle wear on the engine. The low cycle wear - start/stop and waiting for oil to drain - is a large factor on bearing wear. I work in an industry that uses oil journal bearings that get billions of cycles on them. What we rate for is number of start/stop cycles, not number of rotations.   The reason is that when the engine is turned off, oil drains out of the head thus making the parts minimally lubricated for the first few seconds after starting the engine. This has a much larger effect on the overall wear than running billions of constant cycles."
E30,37xrw3,e3027,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:12:41 2015 UTC,Cold oil also strains the engine more. Overall start/stop testing seems to be the better test for strength.
E30,37xrw3,--------Link--------,2,Sat Jun 6 15:38:02 2015 UTC,I want that e30 to go into supersayan mode.  The ODO in my e30 has been busted for years...mileage isn't really a factor anymore.  I just keep track of oil changes and gas fill ups to ballpark estimate total mileage between major upkeep like timing belts or pumps or plugs etc.

E30,37xrw3,1percentof1,2,Mon Jun 1 04:49:41 2015 UTC,Removing the cluster is not really anything to worry about. I have done it 3 or 4 times and it usually only takes about 15 minutes. Of course I imagine it might take linger with an airbag equipped car. I broke one of my tabs and superglue seems to have fixed the problem.

A couple of them looked as good as a proper paint job.  A few looked awful with pits and bubbles.  If you take the time to remove the trim, tape some areas like windows, and wet-sand the heck out of it you can get a decent finish.  We're talking about 20-30 hours of work.  The only personal experience I have is from when I sanded and painted my bumper trim with Rustoleum (zinno red is really close to Rustoleum Regal Red).  I got the trim sanded really well and it turned out pretty good.  It took maybe 3 or 4 hours of sanding for them all by hand."

For example, most e30s don't have maplight rearviews, but the harness is always there in the roof but not attached to anything.  If you haven't yet, scrutinize the harness on the old mirror.  See if any of the wires dead end into nothing.  An example of that would be pre-facelift US headlights.  They all have 3-wire connectors, but on the high beams they only have two wires attached.

E30,37cuj2,Vythix,2,Tue May 26 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"Here is about the only person I've been able to find online who actually took his build to a dyno. Personally I'm not too interested in upgrading to a lot of power. I just think it would be a fun job and would probably help the longevity of my e30, but the added bhp would be nice."
E30,37cuj2,cum_box_on_fire,1 point,Tue May 26 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure, I haven't even researched incorporating the megasquirt. I'm just sticking with the 1.3 conversion."
E30,37cuj2,cum_box_on_fire,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think an 885 can bolt onto a block with an eta crank without swapping the pistons out, with SETA pistons of course. If you're planning on using the stock pistons i think you actually need to import an EU 323i head (aka: the 731). The 323i had the same piston/combustion chamber shape as the eta, but with a shorter stroke.  You'll probably find this helpful."
E30,37cuj2,modmodmodmodmod,1 point,Tue May 26 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the 885 would bolt up to the 86 eta with new head and exhaust bolts. There seems to be a ton of speculation on the forums about the 2.7i of 327i build, but nothing too definite.   I'm trying to avoid replacing my crank and/or pistons, but I'd like a new head. I guess I won't know for certain until I pull mine."
E30,37cuj2,dvkota,1 point,Tue May 26 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"Basically the problem, and some don't see it that way, is that the 885 head is designed for pistons which aren't flat at the top of the block. This means you're losing compression ratio. That might be a good thing, if you want to look at a turbo kit. If you don't, it means that you're not going to see the same gains as you would if your pistons were shaped properly for your head. Basically it's not going to turn your eta into a supereta, but it will get it somewhere in between.  If that's what you're looking for, I'd probably consider going with a megasquirt instead of a motronic 1.3. If motronic 1.3 is what you're looking for, you should totally get a whole harness from an i, in fact, I think you pretty much have to. I'm not sure about the injectors though, I think the stock injectors will work just fine unless they're old and busted, but don't quote me on that."
E30,37cuj2,e3027,2,Tue May 26 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"I just finished my swap, flat pistons with 885 head and Motronic 1.3. It's really fine. 8.4:1 is plenty, the thing still pulls like an animal, feels like a chipped eta up to 3000 then really comes on cam, hang on baby. Motronic 1.3 with a chip and M50 injectors is totally fine, not worth the trouble of megasquirt imo."
E30,37d7hk,OldManHenry,2,Tue May 26 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"Judging by all the E30's out there on XXR002 wheels, they will most likely look good no doubt (IMO). But the best I could find was Here  Assuming you have the right size and offset, just incase you may not you should get over to R3vLimited Wheel Info thread  You can also go through their member's ride section and troll through the E30's on 15s / 16s thread to see if anyone else has done it before."
E30,37c9a7,SelfMastered,5,Tue May 26 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"I did Vancouver to San Diego and back in a '91 318is.   The noise isn't terrible, but it's obviously going to be worse than your average modern car. If you actually think it's going to bug you, just bring some earplugs. The stereo was enough to drown it out most of the time. Hell, we had to crack the windows and sunroof a bit once we hit SoCal - no AC! Still liveable.   Our total trip economy was something like 11l/100km, or 22-24 MPG, but that's because we were trying to stay around 150-160kph, and had three guys plus gear in the car. Efficiency would have been better down around 120kph.   Note that the 318 is geared with a 4.10 rear end, so it does sit a bit high in the revs if you want to hit a fast cruising speed. If you're a DIYer, there are usually cheap E30 open diffs on craigslist, like 3.25, 3.75, or 3.91, which would tone down the buzz a bit.   Sport Seats are kind of hit or miss for long trips. The car we took down was nicely broken in, and the bolstering was very soft. My personal E30's seats are friggin hard, and the knee cushions sometimes cause my legs to go to sleep if they're adjusted out too far.   The nice thing is, they're really adjustable, so you can find a good position, or keep switching it around.   P.S. - I know to check bushings, and flush the coolant and do an oil change.   I would suggest that you check the fan clutch function, replace the termostat, and bring duct tape, hose clamps, zip ties, and a little extra oil and coolant mix. If you're feeling bold, replace the water pump or bring a spare. Obviously bring your metric wrenches and sockets.   You are going across the continent, after all. I didn't have to use my emergency kit on our trip, but it felt good to have it."

I snagged a full engine, harness, ecu, transmission, driveshaft, and exhaust for $300. Did the swap in a day. Took a long time because I did some cleaning and other shit at the same time.

E30,379vgt,Twaletta,2,Tue May 26 02:03:46 2015 UTC,Yeah and that does nothing. First BMW. First car this old. Quite confusing
E30,379vgt,Twaletta,2,Tue May 26 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"It could possibly just be bad bulbs.  Try switching the plugs between the high and low beams.  The harness should be the same on an '87 for both, other than one just having one less wire going into it.  See if the low beam works with the high beams on when it plugged into the high beam harness."
E30,379vgt,Twaletta,2,Tue May 26 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"If the bulbs are good, then my guess would be fuses or relay.  Each of the four headlights has its own fuse.  If both low beam fuses are good, I'd be looking at the relay."
E30,379vgt,M0bius_1,1 point,Tue May 26 03:03:36 2015 UTC,Do the running lights work when the headlight switch is pulled out?
E30,379vgt,Twaletta,1 point,Tue May 26 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't matter.  I was thinking that myself, because if they don't its a bad switch but then the highs wouldn't work either.  And just as I typed that I realized that the high beams are are only switched to the wheel stalk. So yeah. Check the running lights.  If they aren't on then it's probably the pullswitch or a relay."
E30,379vgt,Twaletta,1 point,Tue May 26 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"Me pulling and pushing that in does nothing, the only way I can make the high beams turn on is to push the lever to the very left of the wheel. Even then it's a huge hassle to drive like that. If I need to elaborate let me know. Also the car has been overheating every know and then and when it does it loses power. Fluid is clean, I have enough. Car is properly oiled. Running 89 octane, no explanation why for me. But it does it usually after I Rev and burp the throttle at a stop oddly enough"
E30,379vgt,Deltigre,2,Tue May 26 03:26:32 2015 UTC,"The switch does nothing, including the side markers/tail lights?  If so, would be looking at the switch as the likely problem.  If you can pop the switch panel out, you can check if there is anything wrong with the wiring harness/plug.  Maybe something snapped on the clip.  27 year old plastic tends to get pretty brittle.  Did you try switching the high/low beam plugs to see if the bulbs work?  As for the overheating: When does it happen? Only when idling or driving slow? Does your A/C work, and if yes, are you using it when it overheats? Does the electric auxiliary fan come on when you hit the A/C button?  When you run the a/c it should automatically run the auxiliary fan.  If the A/C doesn't work, then you can use the A/C switch to turn on your aux fan as a temporary solution.  Also, turning your heater control all the way up with the blower on high will cool the car down some.  Uncomfortable in warm weather, but better than a blown engine.  Just don't consider it a fix.    Any time the gauge goes more than a little bit past the center mark you should worry a little.  Overheating in and of itself is not usually going to hurt power, but can cause some things to expand and create an intermittent vacuum leak, making the throttle less responsive and the car seeming like it wants to die, especially when idling.  Check the rubber, L-shaped boot that comes off the air filter housing for cracks.  Actually take it off as some cracks on it can be really hard to spot with it on the car.  I had an '87 that did exactly what you describe, but only when warmed up because of that.  The overheating could be caused by the fan clutch on the motor-driven fan up front, the thermostat being stuck, an air bubble in the system, or the aux fan not turning on.  Look up ""e30 fan newspaper test"" on Google for a way to test the fan clutch.  To test the thermostat just open the thermostat housing and put it back together without the thermostat inside.  If the car stops overheating without it, then yours is stuck closed.  Also, while you are looking at the fan clutch, check the upper coolant hose that is really close to the top of the fan and make sure it doesn't have any signs of hitting the fan.  Pre-1988 e30s tend to do that sometimes.  That won't affect the overheating, but older hoses tend to swell as they heat up and contact the fan, making a bad day of overheating even worse.  Also, save yourself some cash and use 87 octane.  Unless you've done some major work on the engine to increase compression (like a turbo) you'll get no benefit whatsoever from running 89.  89 octane might even make the car run worse."

Then once you've got it replaced you can tell your car that you're sorry.  Let the car know that you feel horrible for getting mad at it and then do something nice for for it.

It's a pretty straight forward swap i wouldn't over think it. Also m3's have 3 turns lock to lock and z3's have 2.7. I have an a z3 and the steering is fucking awesome on it. I recommend it. I have a z3 rack i'm putting in my e30 which i havn't done yet but it seems straight forward. this write up seems very helpful http://www.r3vlimited.com/board/showthread.php?t=66247. These guy bend the subframe tabs but i'm prolly going to take the subframe out and hold the engine up with a crane or a jack so it doesn't damage the tabs. Either way works though. I hope this info helps

E30,36ynor,paintkilz,1 point,Sat May 30 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't it obvious?  Drifting significantly increases the chances of rolling your car over as well as the possibility of being ejected.  I can tell you from personal experience that, even though I wasn't drifting, rolling a car is not a pleasant experience.  Without a roof over your head you risk literally losing that head.  I'm not a fan of drifting, but to each his own.  If you drift in a 'vert with anything less than a full roll cage, 5-point belts, and a helmet you are a fool."
E30,36ynor,SmileyVV,0,Sat May 30 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"so from personal experience that wasnt drifting you can tell me rolling a car is dangerous, even more so in a vert?  you are aware there is a difference between actually losing control of a vehicle and the ""uncontrolled"" slide of a drift right?  i understand what youre implying but im not a teenager bouncing off curbs, corner to corner.  im not the typical BMW owner. i bought my car to use at the track mainly..a full cage is planned(and helmets are required) for summer after i finish rebuilding the m50 i have on the stand."
E30,36ynor,SmileyVV,1 point,Sat May 30 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"No.  I'm not telling you from non-drifting personal experience that sliding a convertible is more dangerous.  I'm telling you that from basic common sense.  Don't be intentionally dense.  Regardless of whether you are a dumb kid or a skilled drifter, on a track or the street, the fact remains that you are significantly more likely to wreck when sliding, intentionally or not, than when you a driving in a straight line.  And doing that in a convertible without the proper safety equipment is absolutely more dangerous.  I wasn't implying anything.  I was actually being pretty direct.  If you are drifting without the proper precautions you are a fool.  If that didn't describe you, then guess what, you're not a fool."

E30,36juup,helalo,1 point,Tue May 19 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"Use a screwdriver or something as a stethoscope and try to pinpoint where it's coming from. Is it coming from the front/timing chain cover, or is it coming from the valve train?   If it's coming from the front, change the tensioner. If that doesn't do it, it's probably time for a timing chain overhaul(guides, sprockets, chain, etc).   If it's coming from the valve train, well that's pretty standard on these engines as they get old. The M42 has hydraulic lifters that start to tick when they get gunked up or collapse. On the bright side, it doesn't really hurt anything. You could try seafoaming the engine to clear it up, but usually you'll just have to replace the lifters if you care that much about the tick."

Basically the coolant drops a few inches in the reservoir every few hundred miles... And the whole cooling system is brand new.

Don't want to wait too long for the two of them. How could I deal with that rust?  I don't know, it just seems that $1500 for ""all that"" is so low. But it's either that or this. I haven't seen the E30 in person yet but the Merc is in absolutely immaculate condition (plus it's a couple hundred cheaper, he'd even drop to $1000 for me). The E30 on the other hand, while not the greatest condition, is probably more fun and better aftermarket options. Both are so tempting! Pretty biased place to be asking this though ha.."

E30,36b9dp,rustede30,5,Sun May 17 23:55:48 2015 UTC,I don't know about where you are but in kc the only e30s that cost 1k are parts cars or rusty parts cars. I was lucky to basicly steal my 325ic for $1400 a year ago and its the cheapest that ive seen since or before for a while and i had to drive three hours to get it within 10 minutes of it being posted.    The car looks pretty clean. Its a 5 speed. But it's also an m10 so that means a 2l crank and boost or a motor swap if you ever want to be kinda fast.   I'd offer $1500 for it and see what he says.  Try to get it lower but it don't seem that bad.
E30,36b9dp,bmr321,1 point,Mon May 18 01:41:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply! Ill take your advice and see what i can do! Hopefully itll happen! I will keep you posted!

However,  I think it was my fault because the lug bolts I bought weren't long enough even though they threaded in a good amount and lasted two weeks before coming off.  The guys at discount tire refuse to work on a car with spacers and several have told me that it's just a matter of time until your wheel does come off.  I still have the 10 mm installed and they are fine so just make sure that you get the largest bolts that'll fit and understand many people won't work on your car while it has spacers.

E30,366pik,el_principito,3,Sat May 16 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Well first, I've literally never seen a getrag fail without boost/non M42 motors. What makes you think it's dead?  Assuming it's dead, you need a new getrag 240. The 260 will work but will be tilted off, some of the bolt holes won't line up, and the shifter will be cocked off unless you mod it.   Not a bad time to do the clutch too."
E30,366pik,protomor,2,Sat May 16 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"Really? Maybe there's hope. I've checked the fluid and it's fine.   At times I can't shift into reverse, 1st, or 2nd. And when I do it sounds like horror-movie special effects.   When I'm able to shift into 1st, it grinds. Then 2nd is completely impossible to shift to so I go to third and over-rev.   3rd has also started to give me some trouble when I try to shift into it.   I was recently hit while parked and had it sitting on first gear. I'm thinking that when it was hit, it might've done some damage?   I do plan on replacing the clutch"
E30,366pik,perfecttttt,4,Sat May 16 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"My friend has an '84 318 where he thought the transmission was screwed because of the same reasons (except he could get first easily). You should make sure that it isn't the linkage, because that was his problem. Check where it attaches to the transmission, it shouldn't have any play where it mounts."
E30,366pik,protomor,1 point,Sat May 16 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well mine was able to get to first easier than the rest. I'll definitely check that out.   Thanks!"
E30,366pik,protomor,2,Sat May 16 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like either a shifter or clutch issue. But I'll agree, this could be the trans. Stare at the shifter first. Likely, when you got hit, stuff tore and is just not working well in the shifter area. The other thought is that your clutch could be going and not wanting to disengage the trans fully. Which causes your grinding."
E30,366pik,protomor,2,Sat May 16 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"So, it looks like I'll order the clutch anyway and check out the shifter during the installation.   If I were to replace the clutch and the transmission turns out to be bad, will it cause damage to the new clutch?   PS - don't ever park your car near a u-turn friendly zone everybody :("
E30,366pik,Ifreakinglovetrucks,3,Sat May 16 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"If you replace the clutch and the trans is bad, the clutch will be 100% fine. Though, it's a huge pita to take the trans in and out lol. I'd replace shifter parts first and maybe bleed clutch fluid before getting a new clutch. You might just have a dying master/slave."

At some point I plan on letting my hair grow for a minute, then having my hairstylist sister give me a mean feathered mullet.

Also, where'd you get the cover that comes off the distributor guiding the wires around to the plugs?  I've seen it on a few e30s, but none of mine ever had it. I always figured it was a stock part that eventually breaks and wasn't really necessary to replace."

I haven't driven it much but if feels much more powerful than the eta it used to be, certainly a lot more responsive and it just wants to rev, rev, rev. It has a misfire at idle on cylinder 6, I think it's because I cut and spliced that wire to get the cylinder ID sensor on it. Sounds nice, starts up hot or cold with no hesitation, but it still idles like ass. Hopefully a new wire fixes it, the rest of the ignition components are new, the injectors are rebuilt, the head has 10,000 miles on it (rebuilt), new gaskets, hoses, the works. Heh.   That part?

E30,362bjo,GohnGalt,7,Fri May 15 14:33:33 2015 UTC,BluntTech is active in the E30 community and has great prices and excellent customer service.  Bavarian Autosport is another good vendor too.
E30,362bjo,this-is-my-work-acct,3,Fri May 15 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a fan of BavAuto.  Ive had issues with both customer service and quality of some of their parts, plus they usually seem more expensive than others.  I get their catalogs still, and it always seems like they cater more to the ""ricey"" side of the aisle.  The last two times I ordered from them they were out of stock, and didn't tell me until past the date they claimed it would arrive.  But your mileage may vary.  My go-to sources are usually Autohausaz and FCPeuro.  Autohaus is probably one of the more commonly used sources.  Good pricing, decent selection, reliable service.  FCPeuro used to have a really bad rep, but has been making big strides to repair it over the past 4 or 5 years.  They started clearly listing the parts manufacturer, and significantly increased the manufacturer selections.  A lot of things on there have 3 or 4 different brands, priced accordingly.  Customer service has also gotten significantly better.  They actually seem to give a shit now.  Five years back I wouldn't even consider them; today they are one of my primaries.  I usually check PelicanParts, but rarely wind up buying from them these days.  Pelican's site is a great resource of options.  They sell lots of ""kits"" that include everything, which I look at primarily just to see what I might need beyond the primary part I'm replacing.  They also have a pretty good supply of customer reviews regarding different parts and the different suppliers.  BMW of South Atlanta usually has the best price on harder to find dealer-only parts.  Also, some of the more indie/specialty retailers can have some pretty good prices on a more limited/random selection.  For example, Ireland Engineering usually has solid prices/quality on things like complete hose kits and wires, albeit with a slower order fulfillment.  Other places include Turner, ECS Tuning, Abrahams, and UUC.  If you are looking for poly bushings and such, these are usually the places to look.  And always factor shipping and special promotions into your sourcing.  Many places have promos for free shipping on a minimum purchase or percentage off specific brands.  Autohausaz might have a better item price, but FCP may have a cheaper overall cost with shipping.  UUC likes to do ""Buy 'X' get a free 'Y'""."
E30,362bjo,Twaletta,2,Fri May 15 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, FCP has definitely improved. Everyone on the Volvo forums generally had at least one bad experience with them. They're really trying to compete with eeuroparts now"
E30,362bjo,BMW_325is,2,Sat May 16 12:44:25 2015 UTC,Blunt is a great guy. I have spent so much money buying parts from him. His customer service is second to none.
E30,362bjo,michael_lis,2,Sat May 16 16:54:12 2015 UTC,No affiliation.  But as the owner of two e30 verts and an e90 wagon I keep going back to autohausaz
E30,362bjo,audimann,4,Fri May 15 17:26:37 2015 UTC,e euro parts and fcp euro are the shit. Both websites ship very fast. I ordered control arms from e euro got the free economy shipping and it was at my house the next day. furiousmethod.com is the best for finding cheep parts. You type in the part number which you can find on realoem.com and it searches like 15 website and you just buy the cheapest one.
E30,362bjo,Twaletta,1 point,Fri May 15 20:14:36 2015 UTC,Agreed.  FCP used to be the absolute worst.  They have improved service and quality significantly over the last 4 or 5 years and I use them probably 50/50 with AutohausAZ as my main sources.
E30,362bjo,beefcakez,1 point,Fri May 15 22:37:41 2015 UTC,Fcp and eeuro are both great on shipping and they put together some fantastic kits. Eeuro tends to be cheaper. I get a ton of parts for my Volvo from them.

Even then, you probably won't see a difference unless you are running a turbo or super.    The best, and cheapest, thing to do is probably having them cleaned/rebuilt.

Also, let me know if you need new orings. I bought a bag of 50 and used 12. I could snail mail you a set."
E30,361cib,beefcakez,1 point,Fri May 15 12:20:13 2015 UTC,The stock ECU will adjust to compensate for the slightly increased flow.   How exactly will it do that? The dumb Motronic ECU has no way of knowing what the flow rate of the injectors is.
E30,361cib,Grrrmachine,1 point,Fri May 15 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"The ECU can and does adjust fuel trim based on O2 feedback. However, if your O2 sensor is bad, it won't know what to do.    Bosch Motronic 1.1/1.3 BMW Copyright Equiptech  ""Adaptive function""  The ECU is adaptive to changing engine operating characteristics and constantly monitors the data from the various sensors (ie MAP, ATS, CTS and TPS). As the engine or its components wear, the ECU reacts to new circumstances by adopting the changed values as a correction to the basic Map.  When the adaptive map is used in conjunction with the OS, Motronic is able to respond much more quickly and retain tighter control over the changing gases in the exhaust system. During closed loop operation the basic injection value is determined by the values stored in the map for a specific rpm and load. If the basic injection value causes exhaust emissions outside of the Lambda value (ie 0.98 to 1.04 AFR) the mixture would be too rich or too lean and the OS would signal Motronic which in turn will correct the mixture. However, this response takes a little time and so Motronic learns a correction value and adds this 'Adaptive' values to the basic map. From now on, under most operating conditions, the emissions will be very close to Lambda and so, after reference to the OS signal, the ECU will only need to make small corrections to keep it that way.  Adaption and correction of the map occurs during the following engine operations.  CFSV operation  ISCV operation  Idle mixture adjustment  Part load mixture adjustment  Operation of the CFSV introduces a combustible mixture to the engine that is compensated for by the fuel evaporation adaptive correction >values after detection by the OS.."""
E30,361cib,beefcakez,2,Fri May 15 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware of this, but you should also be aware of just how limiting this is. The O2 sensor in these cars is little more than a switch; it's not that the sensor reads a range - it simply cuts off the fuel if it gets too rich, and increases the fuel if it gets too lean. At WOT it won't even take those into account; it'll simply run the injectors at what it considers full-duty, however detrimental that may be to the performance.  My point is, you really can't ""upgrade"" the injectors without upgrading the system that runs them."
E30,361cib,Grrrmachine,1 point,Fri May 15 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"it's not that the sensor reads a range - it simply cuts off the fuel if it gets too rich, and increases the fuel if it gets too lean.    You're right, but isn't that how all fuel injectors work? The ECU increases or decreases the duty cycle until reaching stoichiometric conditions? It's not like fuel injectors have variable flow rates without having a variable fuel pump/pressure regulator. There's a certain flow at a certain pressure and that pressure is fixed from the factory. The ECU tells the injector how long to stay open based on the O2 reading.   The adaptive function of the Motronic does exactly that. The only question is how much does the duty cycle change at one time? I don't believe the Motronic is a PID controller in that it will measure the error and calculate a new output until it's perfect. Instead it will just change some determined amount. If the duty cycle changes too much, yes, you will have instability and it'll run less than ideal.   Anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise, as many have done this without issue. Not saying it's perfect, but neither is a clogged stock injector only putting out 10 lb/hr, but I digress. . . .    At WOT it won't even take those into account; it'll simply run the injectors at what it considers full-duty, however detrimental that may be to the performance.   Yes, you are right. Definitely a detriment. At full duty this will be pretty rich.   OP should buy the 15 lb/hr Bosch III fuel injectors instead. P/N 0280155847 or save that money and get a chip specifically tuned to run 17 lb injectors.   At $60/each for the 15 lb/hr injectors versus $70 a set (my purchase price) of the 17 lb/hr injectors + $150 chip, I'll go with the latter.    Regardless, I don't think anyone can dispute that a 4 hole design is better than the single 'water hose' design of the stock M20 injectors.   So, I guess I should retract that going to the 17 lb/hr injector is an upgrade. It's just one option that would require other changes to work perfectly.   An injector upgrade would be the 15 lb/hr injectors (pretty much stock) with the new design spray pattern."

See how the fuel rail hole is off center? I used a dremel and cut it a little bit upwards to make it an oval instead. Fits fine now."

E30,35qj0m,kts262,2,Wed May 13 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"The lamps themselves, as long as they come in their plastic frames, should just bolt into place using the three mounting screws per light assembly. They may look a little daft with the US grilles, but I have no experience with that. The lights themselves should plug right in if your car is from Sept 1987 onwards; on earlier cars, you'll have to chop up your loom or make an intermediary cable to make the plugs connect.  For a HID kit you need a 35W H1 kit (any no-name Chinese set will do), at no more than 4300k. You drill out a decent sized hole in the plastic cover to run the cables through, clip the HID bulb in place, and find a way of connecting the two existing bulb wires (yellow and brown) to the two spade terminals of your HID ballast. I mount the hids on the plastic cover plates for the lights using self-tapping screws.  Be aware that although the projector of a Euro smiley is OK for HIDS, you don't have self-balancing lenses and hardly anyone has washwipe. Therefore its really harsh for any oncoming cars due to the dazzle, so much so that fitting HIDS to these lights is illegal in most of Europe. Make of that what you will.  Obligatory Wiki link."

If you don't get it right the first time, it's gonna be crooked forever.  Ones that clip to the sunroof channel will allow you to take it off from time to time, not every time you wash it, but at least when you wax.  That will let you keep the paint underneath at least a little better than if you can't get to it.  I'm curious what people respond with for specific brands/models though.

They are usually slightly opaque and tinted to act as a sun visor when the the sunroof is open.  The only drawback is that they can, if not properly installed/cared for, scratch the paint under its outer rim if dirt and dust collects.  Also, over time the paint under the edges can be discolored as the rest of the cars paint fades slightly in the sun over time.  My thoughts on it are that I don't care too much about the paint under it, since I would always have it covered anyway. http://imgur.com/NztZTOc"

E30,35ocrg,Twaletta,1 point,Tue May 12 10:34:02 2015 UTC,It is only used on cars with a sunroof.  It just makes the cabin less noisy/turbulent when you have the sunroof open. The car in the photo has a sunroof.  The pic is just washed out and it's hard to see it with the lack of contrast.  Almost 100% of american e30s came with a sunroof.

E30,35n30q,Twaletta,1 point,Tue May 12 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"Poly mounts are supposed to be more stable in hard driving, but they also transmit more vibration and noise into the cabin.  I just put some on and don't think they are too rough, really.  I did use harder rubber transmission mounts since they are supposed to have more noise/vibration than the engine mounts, so I didn't want the really solid polys there.  They are stiffer than stock, but not quite as much as polys.  Granted, I replaced a lot of other related stuff at the same time, so it's hard to say for sure exactly the effect any one part had."
E30,35n30q,Twaletta,2,Tue May 12 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"First, if your fan is chewing on the radiator, you probably need to replace your engine mounts.  On heavy braking weak mounts will let the engine tip forward and contact the rad.  On pre-88 e30s it will shred a hose, but later models like yours were updated, but the radiator is still vulnerable.  That said, if you look around on all the forums, you will find people that love/hate every radiator brand.  I've not really seen a consensus form on the matter.  One guy will say Nissens are great, another says they are crap.  Same with Behr and Mishimoto.  I've gone with the Behrs on two different cars and had no issues.  I don't know about later models, but my pre-88 had a Behr as the OEM radiator.  Regardless of the radiator though, check your mounts.  See how much play you've got with them.  If you can easily rock your motor back and forth towards the front, you need new ones.  You don't want to have the new radiator fail for the same reason."

The first time I did that oilpan it probably took me 5 hours of actual work.  That car had a really low suspension and I kept cracking the oilpan on the road.

E30,35jl2d,1percentof1,6,Mon May 11 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia: ""BMW South Africa's Motorsport division created the 333i in 1986 by fitting the 3210 cc M30 ""big six"" (""M30B32"" of the 733i E23/ 533i E12/ 533i E28/ 633CSi E24) engine to a 2-door E30.[16] The resulting 333i was a major success in saloon car racing in that country and is now a collectors' item. These cars, built with help from Alpina in Buchloe, Bavaria, Germany, featured some interesting compromises like forcing the buyer to choose between air conditioning (vital in South Africa) or power steering (because of lack of space due to the large M30 engine). They were only built in small numbers in 1986. BMW South Africa provided the following specifications for the 333i: Powerplant - M30B32 6 Cylinder 3210 cc [17] 145 kW (197 PS; 194 hp) at 5500 rpm. 285 N·m (210 lb·ft) torque at 4300 rpm. The cars were fitted with a 5-speed manual gearbox and limited slip differential. Braking was enhanced by 296 mm (11.7 in) Alpina dual ventilated grooved front disc brakes. ABS was optional. The cars were fitted with 16x7J Alpina wheels and Pirelli P7 (195/50/VR16) tyres.[18] BMW provided performance figures were impressive, with a top speed of 228 km/h (142 mph). 0–100 km/h in 7.4 seconds, and a standing kilometer in 27.7 seconds at sea level. Actual South African Car Magazine road test figures were a top speed of 231 km/h, 0–100 km/h in 7.23 seconds and a standing kilometre in 28.08 seconds. The test was carried out with a driver, passenger and a full tank of fuel. Only 204 of these cars were produced.[19]"""

The grille is in a heap of parts. Headlights have been jacked as far as we know, kidneys are broken. I really, really hope I'm overestimating the amount of rust I think this thing would have. It's been under cover ('cept the ass) so I hope it's fine, then again rust is rust and rust is a bitch. Don't even get me started on the interior. It's in good condition except for the fact that half of the exterior parts are sitting on the inside (Oh, and the dead cat in the back seat - kidding). Door cards are gone. Dash is probably cracked to hell and back.  Know what the worst thing about it is? Not even the fact that it's in shambles. This thing has been the nesting grounds of my worst enemy... Spiders.  He's got another cabrio in the back behind it, as you can see, but it's been sitting for the same length - if not longer - with the top off so it's caked in dust, cat paw prints, and an assortment of various animal feces and remains.

E30,35cyf5,Twaletta,2,Sat May 9 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"Those do look nice.  I've not usually a fan of striped tires like that, but they actually seem to help the darker wheels stand out on a black car.  The only thing I'd do different is tires with a higher sidewall.  Different strokes, though.    The black tuck/paint also looks nice.  I've been debating repainting the aluminum from its current red to black on my '87iS"
E30,35cyf5,RoRo56,1 point,Sat May 9 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with the higher side wall, that was an older pic, and I'm back to simple black tires.  Thanks, as long as you know how to prep bare metal to paint, i say do it"
E30,35cyf5,Twaletta,1 point,Sun May 10 06:39:04 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, most wheels (e30 or not) almost always look best in the metallic grey that the 'weaves came with.  There are a few exceptions, such as black rims on a white or grey car.  Polished chrome only works on basketweave type wheels, as well.  To stray slightly off topic, only a Subaru WRX is allowed to have gold wheels.  Again, this is just my personal aesthetics."
E30,35chf1,PUNishrr,2,Fri May 8 23:57:28 2015 UTC,Auto has the Trans cooler in it so the factory manual one is definitely an upgrade.

Why anyone would go from a manual to an auto is beyond me, so it's not an issue, but whatev.  What is the actual difference?  Would it really just be a weight thing and you just wouldn't hook up the auto parts?"
E30,35chf1,Twaletta,3,Sat May 9 00:54:12 2015 UTC,Well I mean there's the section of the rad used for transmission fluid and not coolant. The manual would be only coolant.
E30,35chf1,protomor,2,Sat May 9 00:59:22 2015 UTC,It's a very small section of the side of the radiator. I don't think it would hurt anything being there.😘

E30,35a86c,RackedE30,8,Fri May 8 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Depends what car you're starting off with. But the most effective is to get the car back in the condition it left the factory; rebuild the injectors, fit proper spark plugs and a fresh distributor cap and rotor (or coil packs), change all the filters and replace the bushings with OEM rubber.  Most attempts to upgrade a luxury sporting German sedan of this era will only end in bruised egos and empty wallets."
E30,35a86c,Grrrmachine,2,Fri May 8 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"Junkyard M50. My local pick n' pull charges $200 for a complete engine. ECU I think is separate (but super cheap too).   Getting lots of power from an M20 is expensive.   Reuse the G260, build your own trans brace, and make your own wire harness adapter to save money.   This is all speculation, of course, as I haven't done it myself, but it's always the top response when you ask in the other e30 forums.   I do plan to build a 3.0L M50 for my e30 later (after it's back on the road for a while and I have my own garage). I'll have more feedback then."
E30,35a86c,beefcakez,3,Fri May 8 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"An m50 swap isn't cheap as most people make it out to be. Sure, the engine is cheap but its all the extra stuff that gets you . You have maintance items, gaskets, cooling parts, engine mounts, brackets, a modified shift leaver and exhaust. I think im in around 1.5-2k for my obd1 m52 swap. That's with a $180 engine. Then you need the tools to do the swap. Overall I put more money into my car than what its worth but its a hobby and learned a lot in the process. Cheapest/easiest would probably be an eBay power chip followed by a higher ratio diff. Next would be a 2.7l highbred using an eta bottom end and 2.5 head."

I started my restomod with a $1k budget. I'm $4.5k in and still buying parts. Thank goodness I do my own labor!   You are absolutely right about an m50 swap not being cheap. I've read tons of threads about it and the consensus is that it's always a $1-2k job at least. Nothing is as cheap as you think it will be. Not with these cars, at least.   I read OP's question as: What's the simplest, cheapest, and/OR best way to give your e30 more power.   Throwing in a more modern engine as compared to building up the M20 is a much more reasonable plan.   However, I should've just suggested an S62 or one of the V12's!  That's some power!"

E30,359gts,HWKII,2,Fri May 8 05:54:14 2015 UTC,"I've not driven a 318i, but I imagine it could be fun with the m42.  I hear it's got some smooth, even power delivery.  I've had a pair of 'e's.  One had an auto, which really sucked.  Given gas prices, I think I'd be willing to try the m42 if given the choice."
E30,359gts,Twaletta,2,Fri May 8 07:21:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the US M42, but the euro is pretty slugish up until 3.5-4k rpm. But above that it really comes alive and you can have a lot of fun.  Can someone explain what the difference between the US 318i and iS? Over here the 318i has the M40 but the iS has the M42, but that doesn't seem to be the same in the US."
E30,359gts,Probablythefirst,3,Fri May 8 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"The US never got the M40 engine, because they couldn't import enough Toblerones for the camshafts."

E30,359gts,Probablythefirst,3,Fri May 8 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"For the US, the iS is the two-door version and comes with an LSD. The plain ""i"" is the four-door version, but was available with an LSD as an option. I don't know if the iS came with the M-tech suspension (15mm spring pads and Bilstein shocks, basically), but I expect so.  For the rest of the world, the M42 engine only appeared in the 318iS. All the other saloons, cabriolets and tourings got the woeful M40 engine, which started BMW's checkered history of good/bad four-pot engines."

E30,359gts,cosmicandshit,1 point,Fri May 8 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"True - I'd get closer to 25mpg when I'd drive I-5 beween Seattle and Portland, but that's all interstate driving. On the other hand, from Mt. Hood to the Coast along HWY 26 and 30 (which is absolutely the way to do it) I was easily averaging above 30mph due to the lower speed.  It's also true that the engine really comes in to it's own when you keep it at or above 3,500 RPM, but I never found it ""sluggish"" so long as I was specific with my gear selection. No question, the 325i, especially with it's wider gearing, has more pull, but that's what 30ft/lb of torque gets you."
E30,359gts,HWKII,1 point,Fri May 8 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"Plus if you're putting your foot down and getting the sensation of sluggishness then you're straining your engine and shortening it's life. Keep the revs up, more power, more oil circulation, less strain on the bearings"

What if we throw in some variables? Like an auto 325 but manual 318?   Then absolutely the 318i.  The only plus sides of the 325e are:  a) They're cheap, because no-one wants them. b) For someone with reasonable mechanical ability they can be modified to something approaching 325i performance. c) The remaining ones were usually owned by pensioners who looked after them for most of their lives. That said, point A means that many have fallen into the hands of clueless penniless teens now.    Really, the only downside of the 318i is that it may affect your choice in socks."

You would have to tap into each wheel's ABS sensor, install some kind of electric throttle control system, and then create/program a processor to do the work.  If you wanted to get really crazy you would have to use a custom ABS pump and brake lines that could independently control the back brakes. It would definitely not be worth the effort."
E30,358wfn,MattPro,3,Fri May 8 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"To any car, or your car in particular?  For any car, as long as it has ABS and some sort of computer-control in the differentials, you can get piggy-back modules for the ECUs to add traction control. However, most cars with ABS and electric diffs have this feature already.  For your car: Haaaaaaahahahahhahahaha. Sorry. But really, good joke."

I'm assuming this is some sort of hypothetical question, as you only have the 325e? If you swapped and s5x from an m3 maybe you could retrofit its traction control?"
E30,358wfn,dethkarz,2,Fri May 8 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"Traction control comes in the form of fender flares, 16x9s, and 255/40s. Have fun!"

Spent hours and hours rewiring/rebuilding parts of the ECU and it turned out to be a blown ring causing a lean misfire in one cylinder.   I would also check how all of the plugs look after a little while, you might be able to narrow it down to specific cylinders if the plugs look bad on some but perfect on others."
E30,358goa,MattPro,2,Fri May 8 03:46:17 2015 UTC,I had the same issue with oil in the spark plugs. I replaced the rocker cover gasket only to find out the spark plug gaskets themselves were worn. Very cheap and easy fix.

In Texas, my car is past the 24 year mark that doesn't require a smog test, but they are still supposed to do a visual check for a cat.  It's definitely a negotiation point, since I assume you will have to get one on there.  Also, removing the cat doesn't really give you any power gain, unless the cat is clogged to begin with."

E30,3577xe,tokeonthis,1 point,Fri May 8 00:59:09 2015 UTC,"Most likely your car is still required to have a catalytic converter.  You may not be required to pass an emissions test, but that doesn't mean it can be legally removed.  Most vehicle inspections still require a visual check, but most inspectors don't bother to do it.  Beyond that, Federal regulations trump state, and any car after 1990 (might be off by a year or two) is still federally required to have one, and the fines aren't pretty.  First offense will be relatively low ($500ish), but second offenses can skyrocket into the $25k range.  If you happen to come across an inspector that actually does the proper check, the best case scenario would be having it logged and not being able to pass inspection there, or anywhere else, without correcting it.  Worst case, your car gets impounded, depending on the state/county regs.  That said, I'm not suggesting people absolutely must run off and have one installed if they don't have one now.  I am suggesting that anyone removing one because they think it's a performance gain is wasting their time.  You might get a negligible gain in the range of 1, maybe 2%, but it will significantly increase the cars pollution.   Back in the 70s they were more restrictive, but they got significantly more free flowing through the 80s.  Call me a bleeding-heart tree-hugger, but personally, I can't rationalize the excess smog with my car.  You are free to do as you will with your car.  Also, I'm not directing this personally at you, Toke.  I'm just jumping on a soapbox.  No hatin' here."
E30,3577xe,Twaletta,2,Sat May 9 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. I didn't do it for performance gains because it obviously does not provide any, but simply because I just love the sound of it. I don't daily this car so I don't mind as much, I would like remove the cat on my daily driver."

It is, however, still technically illegal. I just did my last Washington emissions test this year (24 years, testing is every other year).  I don't know the process for getting Canadian cars of any vintage into the US.  Also, the ad is light on details. You'll need to actually inspect and test things to tell what condition the car is actually in. 231,000 mi isn't terrible; 231,000 km is fantastic. My car's at 253,000 mi and still runs great, though I finally figured out the slop in my drivetrain is my dual-mass flywheel.

E30,3577xe,el_principito,1 point,Thu May 7 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yep.  If you don't know how to work on cars, e30s are a good platform to start with.  The combination of an an inline 6 with RWD makes them much easier to work around than anything FWD.  The engine bay is cavernous for a car this size, and most everything, from hoses to plugs, is easily accessible.  Being RWD makes transmission work a (relative) breeze.  No fancy electronics or overly complex systems to confuse and frustrate you.  Plus, as old as they are, you are virtually guaranteed to always have something to fix and learn about; though that's more of a 'silver-lining' kinda thing."

E30,3562mt,Twaletta,3,Thu May 7 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno, some strange things with the description.  He says the PO messed up the hood.  The original picture has good paint and a normally mounted hood. Later shot is bad paint with the hood held on with clips.  Seems like he may have messed it up.  What about the trunk paint?  Did the PO do that too?  Really, just the fact that the featured picture is wholly inaccurate makes me skeptical of the whole car.  He says it's got BC coilovers, but that shot of the rear suspension is not coilovers.  No interior shots.  Even with an s50 and some issues fixed, there aren't many non-m3 e30s that would value near $10k like he says.  I'm actually starting to wonder if that first picture is even the same car.  What happened to the valance?  He says it's gone, but where?  Also, where did the trunk spoiler go?  The first shot looks like 15 or 16 inch basketweaves, the later shots look like stock 14s.  Seems sketchy."

E30,356tr5,Twaletta,2,Thu May 7 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Year/model?  My first guess would be a vacuum leak.  Assuming you have the six cylinder, the first thing to check is the intake boot.  It's the corrugated L-shaped rubber boot coming off the air filter box.   It's prone to splitting/cracking and can be hard to see while still on the car.  I had a car act similar to that once.  It would run fine, but get rough and want I die when idling.  After time it started doing it while a was driving.  You can pull it off in less than five minutes.  Get the two nuts holding airbox and unclip the wiring harness o. It.   Then undo the two big hose clamps holding the boot on."

As for the AFM, it's not a bad idea to move the contact arm to fresh resistor anyway. You could have someone else refurb it for a hefty price (Bavarian Restoration does it for $180).   I'd upgrade to a 255 lph fuel pump (when your other one craps out). I have one from TRE and it took maybe 30 minutes to install. Only cost $70 or something like that. A new BMW fuel pump is hundreds.   Anyway, as for the issue. Make sure you check for vacuum leaks everywhere. I had an intake manifold gasket fail and progressively get worse. I didn't find it until it was so bad that I couldn't run the car more than a minute or so.   Edit: stuff"
E30,356tr5,beefcakez,1 point,Thu May 7 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"Replace everything listed.    No no no no no. Not only is this a pointlessly expensive approach to problem-solving, but you have no assurance that the new parts are in better condition than the old ones. What's more, blindly replacing parts can introduce new issues, especially considering the fragility of associated pipes, gaskets and electrical connectors on a 25+ year old car, which makes the troubleshooting process nigh-on impossible.  There is also no need to upgrade anything here, and certainly not the fuel pump (which is already far stronger than the FPR or injectors need)."

I suggested that because my own vehicle is under a semi-full reconstruction and I'm replacing things left and right. It's easy for me to say it because I'm not a broke ass college kid anymore like 90% of e30 owners.   OP should do things one at a time.   Only upgrade the fuel pump when your old one craps out. That's why I changed mine. Never in hell would I pay a couple hundred bucks for a fuel pump. Ludicrous.   The other stuff is pretty much maintenance. Relays are $10-$15.

E30,354zmj,tittties,1 point,Thu May 7 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"Just did this last month.  It's not too hard. Without a press you would probably need a decent vise.  Take the tie rod nuts off first.  You'll need a jack underneath them to provide some upward force or the ball joint will just spin.  Then you can get the middle nut, which can be a pain to reach.  I had to loosen my engine mounts and jack the engine up a little to get the clearance for a socket.  Depending on your socket set, you may need to get a 22mm socket.  The rest were (I think) 17mm, 19mm, and 15mm.    The way I removed the old bushing from the bracket was by cutting through the surrounding rubber to get the center part out, then I put the bracket in the vise.  I used a reciprocating saw to cut a groove almost through the metal around the bushing, but not into the bracket.  You can also use a hacksaw if that's all you have.  Then with a screwdriver/chisel you can use a hammer to bend the metal inward.  It will just fall out once you break the metal surround.  Admittedly, I goofed and cut a slight groove into one of the brackets, but it's not really a big problem, the new bushing will still hold.  Getting them in is the trickier part.  I used a heavy vise to get them started straight.  I sprayed the inside of the bracket, and the outside of the bushing with wd-40 to give it some lubrication.  The wd-40 will dry out on its own pretty quick once it's all pressed in.  Honestly, I think that's the only thing I've used wd-40 in years.  Once it was pushed in enough that it stayed (a couple millimeters in, maybe) I took it out of the vise and went to work with a 2 or 3 lb baby sledge.  I used a wood block on either side and just pounded on them, adjusting where I I hit it depending on whether one side was higher/lower than other to keep it even.  You'll probably destroy a few blocks of wood from the pounding.  I also have a pretty big vise this time.  I tried once with a woodworking bench-vise and broke the vise, so be careful.   Alternatively, you can probably find a local shop to press them in for you.  They shouldn't charge you more than $20-$30 bucks, as it only takes a few minutes.  The first time I did this years ago I got one wedged in at an off angle, and my local BMW dealer just pulled it back out, and pressed them in for no charge, but I'd have paid them if I needed to.  Getting the pressed bushing on the arm isn't too hard.  The first time I did this the service tech at the dealer said they use aerosol glass cleaner as the lube for that, so that's what I used.  Spray the arm, spray the inside of the bushing, get it at the correct angle, and then with another wood block pound it on.  I had a piece of PVC pipe about the right diameter that I used to pound it on once it went past flush.  It took me maybe 2 hours for the first one, and maybe an hour for the second.  It's not too hard.  If you have the time, get the car on jackkstands the night before, take the wheels off, and spray the big 22mm center nut with some PB Blaster and let it soak in overnight, just in case it wants to be difficult.  It also wouldn't hurt to order new tie-rod ends.  Even if the ball joints on them look good, there's a 30-40% chance you might shred the boots taking the old ones off. If that happens, just count how many turns the old ones needed to take off.  You probably will want to get an alignment when all is said and done.  Edit: Probably should also mention, for these parts, don't get the generic ebay brands.  Did that the first time I did this years ago, and I was replacing them a year and a half later.  The control arms I got this time were Febi brand and seem to be good quality.  I was getting some other stuff from Ireland Engineering and the guys there swore they would hold up, so I tacked them onto my order.  You don't have to buy from Pelican Parts, but they do usually have the different brands with reviews that you can check out.  For the bushings I would only go with genuine BMW, but you can source them online reasonably cheaply.  I used the E30 M3 bushings, but I was setting up a pretty aggressive suspension.  If you have a stock suspension, the stock bushings are fine."
E30,354zmj,Twaletta,1 point,Thu May 7 04:44:46 2015 UTC,I was taking a look at it yesterday and didn't see why taking the tie rods nuts off would help. I already have Lemforder (spelling?) control arms and oem bushes. Thanks for your input.
E30,354zmj,Twaletta,1 point,Thu May 7 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right.  When I did mine I was replacing the entire strut along with the control arm.   In my head I was just thinking of the things that gave me issues with that job, and that came up."
E30,354zmj,Grrrmachine,1 point,Thu May 7 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't know how long your current control arms have been on, then you'll want a fork-type splitter and a decent hammer. If you can, get a long extension onto a socket. Use that to loosen the subframe nut for the control arm, then smack the top with your hammer to drive it down and out of the subframe.  Remember that besides jacking up and supporting the car, you'll need a jack directly under the control arm ball joints to stop them spinning while you undo the nut.  For the bushes, a pair of M3 eccentric rubbers are infinitely preferable to polybushes. Besides that, here's an article on how to fit the lollipop bushes."
E30,354zmj,Twaletta,1 point,Thu May 7 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Is it worthwhile to use M3 bushes on a stock suspension?  I thought it only made a big difference on lowered cars, but I admit I can be wrong."
E30,354zmj,Grrrmachine,2,Thu May 7 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"This is the only M3-specific bush on the car, and the eccentric setup just gives a bit more steering response and tighter turn-in than the standard ones.  The only other non-standard bush is the E46 M3 top mounts for the rear shocks, just because they're much beefier than the E30 ones."
E30,354zmj,Twaletta,1 point,Thu May 7 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"I knew they increased caster, but thought they also helped correct camber.  I can picture it in my head, and now that I think about it that makes sense. If the control arm mounted higher or lower it would push the strut out, but all it does is turn it in slightly since it's pretty close to the center of the wheel."
E30,354zmj,CHRISpyBaconIsGood,1 point,Thu May 7 07:49:35 2015 UTC,"I am just going to own up and say that as a mechanic, I simply bought a new arm with bushes and ball joints already fitted. It really wasn't that expensive if you want to look at going down that road, but if not good on you. Be very careful that you use correctly sized dies (or whatever home brew tool you may have) when using a press, and that everything is straight. You can really make a dogs breakfast out of stuff if not careful on a press.  I unfortunately cannot remember much detail about how complex the arm on my car was as I do so many, but just persevere if you find it difficult to put back in place, and if you get really pissed off just take a minute and try to think about how it came out, and the fact that it did come out.  One last thing, this car is obviously German, be nice to it and treat it with OEM or better parts.  Any problems just reply to this with details and I'll try and help when I see it.  Edit: Also, one very important point, when refitting the arm ensure that the bushes are clamped in place at a rotation angle that is as close to the car sitting normally as possible. basically when you jack a vehicle up the arm lowers where its connected to the hub, but the position/angle of rotation of the inner tube of the bush that is clamped to the sub-frame stays the same due to the thin metal they use either side of the bush on the sub-frame. This is done on purpose to clamp the bush at a certain angle & stop it rotating whilst driving. If you just simply do up the through bolts securing the bushes to the sub-frame while the car is jacked up then lower the car down these bushes will be permanently twisted. Instead you must find a way to get the lower arm into position before doing these through bolts up tight. if you have ramps this is a perfect way. Fit the arm and do up the ball joint tight to the hub, put the through bolts into the sub-frame/ bushes and put the nuts on until they are just touching the sub-frame tongues, then fit and tighten all other shit. drive the vehicle onto the ramps and then clamp up the bushes to recommended torque.  Excuse all spelling mistakes, I'm a fucking tired pleb."

E30,352zl4,Twaletta,3,Wed May 6 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan of convertibles in general, so I'm biased in the wrong way for you. But I'll try and cover both sides of the story here.  If you've driven any other E30 already then the cabrios do feel a bit floppy, especially if you're used to chucking your car around corners on country roads. The whole car was an afterthought from the factory (released 5 YEARS after the first E30 model), and as such the roof mechanisms (especially the electrical ones) are particularly weak, the top-down drive isn't as refined as more modern softtops, and the bolt on hard top (if you can find one) is rocketing up in price these days. Combine that with a nose-heavy driving style in six-cylinder form, and you'll find it particularly underwhelming on the track compared to other weekend toys.  That said, they are wonderful afternoon cruisers. The M20 engine doesn't have much low-down torque, but on the right road with the roof down you get to appreciate the burble of a straight six in the sort of style that they just don't make any more. With your aviators on and New Order's ""Blue Monday"" on the stereo, you can see why people lap these cars up.   It's a real shame the US never got the M20B20 engine; it's the perfect cruising motor for a ragtop E30. As it is, you're stuck with either the fizzy rev-happy M42, or the aforementioned 2.5 engine. If you can, get the small M42 - it'll make the car feel that little bit more sprightly, despite being 30hp less.  So overall, if you live in a geographically charming place an E30 convertible is a great choice for the summer. But if you want a track toy you're going to be underwhelmed."
E30,352zl4,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed May 6 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"Blue Monday.  Good call.  I also find that Kraftwerk's ""Autobahn"" is a fine match for these cars."

I wouldn't drive a mile more than I absolutely had to on those idiotic tyres though, and they're one of the reasons the car feels ""floaty and light"" (i.e fucked). That and the cracked steering reservoir (which is what, $10 for a used one?) means that the owner simply ran out of cash.  I can't comment on price since I'm not in the US, but you can probably sell those wheels and tyres on to some deluded fool in the stance scene, fit some decent 15"" rims with correct tyres, and still have cash left over to make that car into a proper driveable cabrio."

E30,352zl4,OldManHenry,1 point,Fri May 8 02:54:43 2015 UTC,As a 320i convertible owner I have to agree. Everybody rags on the M20B20 but it's got tons of low end torque to get the heavier convertible going and it's got a really smooth power curve.
E30,352zl4,kmoran1,3,Fri May 8 09:10:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, i see a lot of love for the verts.  They may not be as popular on the track, but people recognize that for a weekend/daily driver it's a really good compromise for those that want a convertible and handling.  I love my coupe, but in the warmer months I have to admit to at least a little envy for the convertible owners.  And as far as convertibles in general go, they have some really clean lines as if the car was designed as a convertible from day one.  The convertibles may not be quite as stiff as a coupe or sedan e30, but as far as convertibles go it is pretty good.  Things like the lower door sills are significantly beefier on the 'verts to compensate for the lack of pillars and I believe they had heavier swaybars.  An e30 (6 cyl) with a decent suspension setup is not going to handle quite as well as a Miata with a similar setup.  I used to know a guy with a Miata and the cars were reasonably evenly matched overall.  By that I mean the Miata handles better in the twistys, while on the straighter roads my e30 would pick up the slack and even it out.  I can't say much on direct experience in a Miata  since I couldn't actually drive it.  At 6'3"" with long legs I literally couldn't fit in the drivers seat without kissing my knees.  Check this out, someone posted it a week or two back: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J3aHWq4zcJk"
E30,352zl4,porkface31,2,Wed May 6 19:28:35 2015 UTC,Excellent feedback. Thank you!  I don't even need to keep up with miatas as if I got serious about the track again I think a dedicated build might be better for me but I would like to go to the odd track day and have fun.
E30,352zl4,nosleeves82,3,Wed May 6 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"If you want to stiffen the chassis, get a cross brace to connect the subframe to the body underneath the cab.   It came standard in e36 M3's as well as Z3's, etc. I found an oem unit in a junkyard recently and picked it up for $10. A new one is $200.   It will make the car much more rigid."

E30,351f9e,Chinampa,1 point,Thu May 7 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard the complaint that they crack or or warp too easily, but really, they cost ~$100, so it's not that big of a deal.  For the money they are a damn good, lightweight wheel."

E30,351f9e,Chinampa,1 point,Thu May 7 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"If you drive them hard they can.  A buddy of mine that was doing SpecE30 told me they were somewhat popular in that crowd, but seemed to be prone to cracking under those conditions.  No one cared too much though, because they are pretty cheap and easily sourced.  I'm not hating on them, they are what they are.  You've got six thin spokes on a pretty lightweight wheel.  They just don't have much substance.  Given the price, though, they are awesome wheels.  If I have to replace one every couple years, big whoop, they cost a bill.  Most decent wheels with that kind of weight cost quite a bit more.  Just google 'kosei k1 crack'.  It's not uncommon."

E30,35145x,daruma3gakoronda,3,Wed May 6 06:32:42 2015 UTC,"probably best to get a new used one and rebuild that. If your current lsd is burnt, you can't replace the center so you're fucked anyway.   Takes a lot to kill a factory diff though. Unless you got over 300whp."
E30,35145x,protomor,3,Wed May 6 11:24:45 2015 UTC,Untrue the LSD friction plates are just worn. same as how a clutch wears.
E30,35145x,paperboy91,2,Wed May 6 13:32:43 2015 UTC,Good condition factory diffs are tough. 25 year old factory diffs that are still running their original clutch and pressure plates could probably be killed with a single overenthusiastic doughnut like OP tried.
E30,35145x,Grrrmachine,2,Wed May 6 15:16:30 2015 UTC,Lol I was trying the doughnut to see if it WAS the LSD... I think it happened after I changed the rear end oil

E30,35145x,Grrrmachine,2,Thu May 7 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"That's not the right one at all - that's more of a transmission oil for FWD cars that have the diff built in.  You need a 75W-140 specifically designed for plate-type LSDs, such as Castrol Syntrax Limited Slip 75W-140."

E30,35145x,paperboy91,2,Wed May 6 13:11:11 2015 UTC,OOOOOOOO pick me I have got this one. Wrote this few weeks ago for just such an occasion. Includes way to test it and how to rebuild/upgrade.   http://buildraceparty.com/diy-tech-how-to-rebuild-a-bmw-e30-differential/
E30,35145x,paperboy91,2,Wed May 6 13:31:50 2015 UTC,"It's a good little guide, but I have one comment:   Starting from the top you have the carrier bearing. Can be replaced but requires pullers and presses. I opted to skip that.    If the diff is being rebuilt because it's broken (as opposed to just a service) then this bearing will be contaminated with metal particles, and it's crucial that it be replaced. If not you're just asking for the diff to lunch itself imminently down the road, destroying your new (and expensive) clutch packs in the process.  It's a good guide for improving the lock-up, but not for renovating a dead diff like OP's."
E30,35145x,Ifreakinglovetrucks,2,Wed May 6 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"Excellent point! But Dead is different from no longer locking. I agree new parts are always better and I would have replaced the bearings with out hesitation, as they are cheap, but as stated I did not have a press. Diff was still in working order just was not as solid locking as it once was new.   Op states his diff is not as well locking as it once was so refreshing the plates should do him (her) well. But new bearings would be highly recommended. I will say that his question is not very descriptive so neither of us know what is really going on unless he takes it apart and reports back."
E30,35145x,paperboy91,1 point,Wed May 6 15:49:40 2015 UTC,I believe the plates are just worn. It's just not locking up how it used to... I'm gonna go with the three plate setup with the o-rings I think

E30,35145x,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed May 6 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"depends on what you want to replace. Minimum is carrier o-ring, diff bolts and two friction plates coming in at 155$. things recommended if you dont cheap out would add 2 new dog ears at 35 each. bearings at 37 for boths. 2 other seals for 50$(these are usually fine) shaft seals. and obviously new diff fluid at ~30$. so pick and chose from that. http://thayermotorsports.com/ is easiest ive found so far(no i dont work for them)  If you are good with a jack and familiar with the e30 rear end you can get this all done in a day."

It's an '87. Very light surface rust in on the passenger side wheel well towards the bottom of the car where the paint came, which you can only notice if you are looking for it. Some paint chips like nearly all E30's, but some of the cleanest paint I have seen other than that. Mechanically, it's sound. Just can't seem to figure out the misfire. Checked to make sure the plugs are good; they are. Cap and rotor recently changed. New crank position sensor. Swapped DME's and that did nothing. Spark at the coil... There is some monkey business from the previous owner who cut some wires in the engine bay and and taped them together that was, presumably, for the the lights when it was being towed.

E30,34sm4e,Banshee424,3,Mon May 4 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"The absolute #1 rule with these cars is to buy in bodyshell condition. Engine choice is secondary, mechanical condition is nowhere near as important, and things like fitted options, paint colour and mileage are really just price negotiation points.  These things rust (I don't believe a rust-free E30 exists), and they rust in very hard-to-see places, so if you see a little blister it's normally 10% of what's really there. Check every wheel arch, all along the bottom of the car, around the towing eye, and the front corners of the floorpan. If there is a single drop of rust on the roof, even the tiniest blister, then walk away.  For the mechanicals, you want to know that suspension bushes have been replaced recently, and ideally NOT with polybushes. For the iS specifically the owner should have proof that the chain tensioner has been replaced, or the price reduced accordingly.  This particular car spent most of its life in the hands of a caring owner (based on the paperwork), but is now has a less-than-diligent owner. The rear valance has been nailed on badly, the front lip is missing, the bonnet (hood) edge is rusted, that front seat and steering wheel desperately need a retrim, the washer fluid bottle looks empty and capless, the front fog is smashed, and it's got fucking M-badges on it. Whatever you pay for it, make sure you have another $1000 in cash to fix the inevitable problems caused by neglect."
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,2,Mon May 4 05:58:58 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you very much!  I thought the bumper looked a little off but I wasn't sure.  I'll definitely check for rust everywhere before I buy. I want my first E30 to be a memorable one for the right reasons.   If you don't mind, would you look this one over too?  http://tampa.craigslist.org/pnl/cto/4974419562.html"
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,3,Mon May 4 06:13:03 2015 UTC,"This one has spent most of its life outside, which is why it's gone pink instead of red. A good T-cut/polish might bring it back to life, but check a detailing forum to confirm. The lip's still missing and the front brake vents are the wrong colour, but those are very minor things.  On the mechanical side it doesn't have aircon, but what's there has been very well looked after, with an immaculate interior. The owner clearly cares about the aesthetics since you could eat your dinner off the engine, but that pointless cone filter needs to be swapped back to the OEM one ASAP (they don't do the M42 engine any favours whatsoever).  If the faded paint can be brought back to life, that car is a much more sensible purchase. Having said that, it's not perfect. Chipped with an electric fan conversion? This car has been molested needlessly, or as a result of cheapness (misguidedly thinking an electric fan is ""better"" than fixing the viscous unit). So it's been owned by someone enthusiastic but whose mods may have done more harm than good. The headers and suspension are a tradeoff though, so you get some good to balance things out.  Still, I'd trust this car more than the first one you linked to."
E30,34sm4e,Twaletta,3,Mon May 4 06:40:35 2015 UTC,"The only thing I want to add is regarding the AC and PS ""delete"".  It seems, at least from what I've seen, many times this is really the result of the PS or AC failing.  Then, instead of taking the time/money to fix them correctly, it gets ""deleted"" and claimed as a ""performance mod"".  The reason I say this is because the gains to be made from these deletes are negligible, especially the AC.  When the AC isn't running the compressor has a clutch that lets it spin freely with very little leeching of power.  The only real plus to it is losing maybe 40 lbs of weight, assuming they pulled all the components beyond the compressor.  Few people in their right mind would intentionally delete a functional AC system because it is really nice to have.  If it was a legitimate mod for a non-track car then used and functional compressors should be a dime a dozen, and they aren't.  AC isn't always a cheap fix.  The PS has maybe a little logic behind it, but still doesn't give much gain either.  The only time it's really drawing much power from the engine is at low speed (under 10 mph) and when you are physically turning the wheel. I had two e30s that I ran without PS, and honestly, it was because the pump failed and squealed and I cut the belt to shut them up temporarily.  The car does seem to have a better feel (subjectively, I admit it could be in my head) without PS at speed, though anything under 5 mph is a royal pain without it.  Again, I don't know the situation with this car, but aside from some weight savings, the effects are negligible.  It implies, but doesn't guarantee, that the owner might have a tendency to half-ass some repairs instead of fixing them right.  Just keep an eye open for rigged ""fixes"".  Also, these cars used a type of painting process that didn't have a clear coat.  It's basically up to the owner to keep a good coat of wax on it to make it shine nice.  The downside is that when it's not waxed it can look really dull and faded.  But, with a couple nice coats of wax, it can look absolutely gorgeous.  My car is that same red, and even though I'm not a fan of red cars, it does have amazing depth and tone when it's waxed up well.  A waxed zinno-red car in the light at dusk looks fantastic, with the angles and curves diffracting some brilliant purples and oranges.  It's difficult to describe, you kind of have to see it.  If the paint doesn't have any significantly worn through sections, you can probably work with it very well.  Also, don't take it to touch-free car washes, the chems used can leave oxidation 'scars' that take some serious grunt work to buff out.  I know this from experience."
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon May 4 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"What's the current status in the US with A/C refridgerants? Most E30s had an R12-based system, but that was banned in Europe decades ago. Some cars were switched to R134a, but you need to tear down the whole system to do that conversion.  So if R12 is banned in the US too, I expect this iS had its A/C ""deleted"" when it needed regassing."
E30,34sm4e,Twaletta,1 point,Tue May 5 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"That could be the case.    Except for a very short list of exceptions, R-12 is banned here as well.  Last I paid attention, R-12 was going for $25 to $50 /lb. depending on the quantity.  I believe you have a license to sell it or refill a system as well.  Yeah, converting a system is a bit of a PITA, but it's not really terribly expensive.  Either way though, I tend to be a bit skeptical with most ""deletes"" of that nature on a street car.  But yeah, it could be any number of reasons."
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,0,Tue May 5 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"I was a little bummed about the lack of A/C but i can live with that. I read about the cone filters on here before, let's in too much heat.   So basically change the filter back to an OEM filter, find and install an OEM chip, and change the fan back to a stock one?  I'm pretty new to working on cars (my main car is a Ford Ranger and it hasn't given me any major problems in 3 years), how difficult would it be to change the fan back and what are the drawbacks to the current one (other than not being legit)? Would any of this be a good reason to just walk away?  Again. Thank you very much!"
E30,34sm4e,Twaletta,2,Mon May 4 07:01:25 2015 UTC,"Returning those parts to stock are an afternoon's work using a mix of new (viscous coupling) and used (filter, chip, fan blades) components. You might even break even by selling the filter and chip on to another clueless teenager who thinks he can eke more power out of the engine than BMW could.   It's certainly not bad enough to stop you buying the car, but it's a warning as to what the seller will tell you when you view the car. Take any comments on ""tuning"", ""increased reliabilility"" or ""baby M3"" with a huge pinch of salt."
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,2,Mon May 4 07:26:59 2015 UTC,Ok. That doesn't sound too bad.    Thank you very much for all of your help!
E30,34sm4e,Twaletta,2,Mon May 4 12:12:43 2015 UTC,"Since you generally seem to know your stuff, may I ask what your concerns are with chips?  I completely understand that a lot of the eBay cloned chips people buy/sell may be somewhat risky in the sense that they could be tampered with or modified by people without any idea of what they are actually doing.  With that in mind, I had an '87 325e with a genuine Conforti chip in it for a few years, and the difference was quite noticeable, and never seemed to have any negative impact on the car.  Yeah, I paid a little more for gas since they require 91 or 93, but I was used to that from having an e46.  An Eta with a chip, 4.10 diff, and manual transmission is a reasonably cheap build that can almost hold its own against a 325is.  I also had an '87 325is with a genuine Dinan chip in it.  While the difference wasn't as dramatic as it was on the Eta engine, it was noticeable, again with no negative impact as far as I could tell.  For people running more hardcore/heavily modified setups like turbos/supers/cams there is definitely a benefit of running a custom programmed chip, but I'm not really asking about those guys.  They are in a different league than people running close to stock.  Since you seem to know your stuff maybe you could elaborate on your thoughts?"
E30,34sm4e,Grrrmachine,2,Tue May 5 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"The Motronic versions used in E30s is primitive - really, it's dinosaur-level in terms of DME.

Because of that, any chip you can buy for an engine of this period can only do two things:   Increase the amount of fuel going through the injectors Retard the spark to increase compression   Sure, those are exactly the things engine tuners did to carbs back in their heyday. But with carbs, you have to be there physically, and adjust the fuel needle and distributor advance to that particular car, since each carb will flow ever so slightly differently, and each ignition setup will need a degree changed here or there to match that engine's current compression.  An M20 or M42 engine is no different. You need to tune to that particular engine, because Motronic 1.X is so primitive that it cannot adjust itself to compensate. It has no real idea how much fuel is going through your injectors - it simply has a predefined value based on a working injector. So how can you map the ECU to ""tune"" that flow, if you have no idea what the flow is in the first place, since there's no feedback from an E30's injector?  Since I've never seen anyone here say they've had their injectors rebuilt in the two years I've used Reddit, I can only assume that most E30s are now running gunked-up, sticky or dribbly injectors, that don't flow anything like they were supposed to. I have seen plenty of people claiming improved performance with bigger injectors (from fords or whatever), but this is simply beacuse a new injector will flow better than a 25-year-old one that's never been refurbished.  As for the ignition side of things: sure, a tiny shift here and there might yield a tiny boost. But that's because the tuner's delete the part of the maps that cover high-altitude driving, or cold-weather starts, or any other less-than-perfect driving conditions. So you get a few more horsepower on a flat road on a cool day, at the expense of increased carbon buildup, lean starts, ruined spark plugs and potential engine wear on all the other days. So if you buy a chip, you have to hope you have exactly the same climate as the guy who programmed the chip, and that your engine is running in the same condition, with the valve tolerences set to the same level etc etc. How many teenage chip fitters own feeler gauges and know how to set the clearances on an M20? Not many.  All in all, if your injectors are in as-new condition and your block has the right compression, a chip can't make any improvement without reducing engine life (by lean running etc). If a chip does make a difference, you'd get an equal or even improved performance just by having your injectors rebuilt to flow properly. For the really ""powerful"" chips, you're putting your faith in the tuner's skill, the condition of your engine and the quality of your fuel, because the M20/M42's lack of knock sensors will result in a blown block if something goes wrong. I don't trust a bloke with a laptop 2000 miles away that much; do you?  The guys who go boost use aftermarket ECUs (Megasquirt etc) which overcomes all these problems, and I've also seen Motronic 3.3.1 fitted to an M20 for a modest improvement. But IMHO, any plug-in-and-go chip for any E30 engine is a complete waste of time and money.  EDIT:    An Eta with a chip, 4.10 diff, and manual transmission is a reasonably cheap build that can almost hold its own against a 325is.   Pfft. They might pull away the same, but since the 325i has 2000RPM more, the Eta doesn't stand a chance."
E30,34sm4e,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,2,Tue May 5 04:45:45 2015 UTC,"Do I trust some random guy with a laptop?  No, not on an ebay cloned chip.  But I do trust Jim Conforti.  I'm just going from personal experience here.  I suppose it's possible that the chip gains in my b25 were just a placebo effect, but I do think it made a difference.  However, I can't concede that possibility on my b27.  The difference was significant and easily noticed.  Im not gonna argue that there aren't many factors that can be adjusted.  You do know more about motronic than I do, but it does seem (at least on an eta) that even those few factors can make a noticeable difference.    Off the line, my 325e with a chip and a 4.10 would take an 'iS' up to around 35-40 mph.  But once the 'iS' got into third gear the contest was over.  That's what I meant by ""almost"".  Again just drawing on personal experience.  I'm not gonna chip my current 325is, but a 325e? I absolutely would.  I just wanted your thoughts on them since you always seem to have some well reasoned thoughts on these kinds of things.  Also and finally: E30Zone? Thank you for that fantastic knowledge base."
E30,34sm4e,yelsnia,1 point,Tue May 5 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I don't know much about the 325e, since they're really a US-only car. But since they were built for economy the maps could be tweaked for power. It's still lipstick on a pig though: your 4.10 diff is why you could pull away fast, since the ""e"" head is far too restrictive to give you any top-end performance.  With a MAF, a proper wideband O2 sensor and a throttle position sensor, not switch, then a chip might make sense. But if you were fitting those, you'd just leave them bolted to the M50 engine they came from."

It can't be converted to LHD without destroying most of Hartge's work on the car, since the exhaust headers are RHD specific and the cam/chip don't work without the matching exhaust system. Unless, of course, this is just a standard 325i auto with a few Hartge extras bolted on by Birds, like the badges, wheels and body kit.

E30,34qq7z,DrekHusky,3,Sun May 3 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"I have seen the same thing in several e30s/m20s.  I've been told by a few sources that a little bit of this isn't really abnormal.  Since the vac system loops back on itself in a few places, it's just particulate oil condensing in cooler regions.  I've seen it likened to chattering valves as just something these cars do.  My current car had a little last time I had the AFM off.  When was the last time you had it apart and might have noticed?   I would suggest cleaning all the oil out and then running it for a few weeks to see how much collects in a short time.  It could be years of accumulation that you are seeing.  I could be wrong. If so, I'm sure someone else will chime in, but I wouldn't worry too much."
E30,34qq7z,Twaletta,2,Sun May 3 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"Some oil is definitely normal. Your crankcase is connected to your intake system to keep it under constant vacuum, so some oil will make its way into the intake system.   If you have excessive oil you may have worn piston rings allowing excessive blowby or another crankcase related problem. I would definitely clean it up and check it after a couple weeks of daily driving."

Your issue could be an electrical draw issue. It likely has nothing to do with the ICV. It's more possible that either the areas feeding all those things are over burdened (likely due to rust/corrosion) or they all share a common ground set and THOSE are corroded/rusted.   Basically, you need to find a wiring diagram and find the common components and replace/check appropriately.

Harbor Freight has a cheap tester, or you can rent one from an auto parts store.

I was quoted $400 for new rear seat vinyl too. Dunno about door cards.   Not trying to dissuade you,  but just let you know how much to set aside.   So, assuming cost isn't an issue, I'd go with the factory seats, but that's because I'm partial to them. Those updated race seats look killer though! I've seen them in a lot of M3's and they almost always look awesome."

Particular types of pearlbeige (houndstooth, for example) are pretty much non-existent.  Based on that, it may not be up to you to go OEM, if the fabric simply doesn't exist. Of course, plain leathers are easier to source, but you'd be mad to stick with beige or dysentry-brown when you could have Cardinal or Oxblood instead."

E30,34h6ue,Grrrmachine,3,Fri May 1 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"Options:   Hot/Cold: Get a blowtorch and some compressed air. Heat the bolt up cherry red, then blast it with air to cool it down. The thermal shock will loosen it. Imperial sockets: a similar-sized imperial socket can get a good tight fit on a worn 13mm nut. Use 6-, not 12-sided sockets: they'll grip better File flats onto two sides of the nut, then use a wrench Candle wax: heat up the bolt, then rub it with a plain white candle. The wax works down the threads via capilliary action and helps loosen the nut. If you have the space and skill, weld a bigger nut around the smaller one. You'll have good metal to wrench on, and the heat will help loosen the bolt."

E30,34h6ue,Grrrmachine,1 point,Fri May 1 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, these were so weak that even an 11mm 6 point socket isn't holding on too well. Would a really small 12 point socket hold well? these are pretty much completely round."
E30,34h6ue,Twaletta,2,Fri May 1 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"a 12-sided socket will just round the corners off even more. And annoyingly you can't hammer on a 7/16, as it's already slightly larger than an 11mm.  I'd suggest filing three sides until you can smack on a 10mm socket. You won't need many passes with the file to make it fit."
E30,34h6ue,Narek_S,2,Fri May 1 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem here is that these nuts are probably copper.  Copper is used for a few reasons.  They shouldn't corrode or seize as badly as steel, but after 25+ years of hot/cool cycles it might not help.  The also have the benefit of being less likely to snap a stud off, since copper is significantly softer than steel.  Unfortunately it means they are much more likely to round-off on you.  Grrrrmachines (that enough 'r's?  Not gonna count em) suggestions are probably your best shot.  The heat/cool shock combined with a slightly smaller SAE socket might just do it.  I've got a box of crappy old sockets that I use solely for abuse.  One that is just slightly too big will make it on with a hammer, and might take it off.  If that doesn't work and you don't feel like waiting and ordering the extractors, you can probably find an Irwin brand set at Lowe's.  Lowe's started stocking them and had two different sets maybe a year back when I still worked the tool dept there.  They actually were ramping up their automotive tool selection for a couple years, so they are generally a much better shot than HD for repair emergencies.  Worst case scenario you can try to cut the nut off with either a dremel or small hacksaw blade.  Get a small slit on it, the try to split it with a chisel/screwdriver.  That's last-ditch though.  You need to be really careful not to damage the thread much.  A tap and die set can fix small thread problems, but too much damage and I wouldn't trust it.   Granted, this isn't a head bolt, so even a bit of damaged thread might not matter as much and a copper nut would probably make it on with a little extra grunt.  But it will be harder to take off if you still have the car 15-20 years down."

If you unfolded a decent brand paper filter for these cars (like a Wix) you would see that they have a significant amount of surface area.  They allow more than enough air through for these cars.  You might consider sanding the paint off the raised parts of the valve cover/intake manifold to provide some nice contrast, but that's just my personal preference."

I've seen stretched tires blow out in a hard turn and take someone else's car with them when they spun out in an intersection.    I'd have no problem with a law requiring tires and wheels to fit properly.  I wouldn't be surprised if they already exist, but are never enforced; like when people ""upgrade"" to cheap-ass HIDs without an auto leveling system or proper lenses (I sorta prefer being able to see at night, ya' know, just a personal preference).  Have some concern for the rest of us that have to drive on the same roads as you.    And don't pull the excuse that it's the only way your wheels will fit.  Just buy wheels that actually fit.

E30,347afm,tittties,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:11:44 2015 UTC,They lower the car an imperceptible amount and don't really go that much stiffer than stock. Even the race springs felt soft to me.
E30,347afm,protomor,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"When it comes to shocks/springs, the options are many.  The first question to ask is, ""How much are you willing to spend?""  The most basic setup would be to replace just the shocks.  You can go with something similar to stock, or for not a whole lot more something like Bilstein HDs, which have the same dampening as the bilstein sports, but with the correct travel for stock height.  I had a 325is with the HDs years back, and it was fun without risking a cracked oilpan.  A lot of people go with Eibach or H&R springs to lower it a little, with either Bilstein sports or Konis for the shocks.  They will give you a bit stiffer ride and less roll, with a drop that's not too extreme for most roads.  Something like that is probably the most common setup people go with.  And then you also could go with a coilover setup, with adjustable height and usually much wider range of spring weights to choose from.  Those can range from simple, generic setups around $600 (for only the shocks/springs), to really pricey systems pushing upwards of $3-4k.  I've got a Ground Control setup that ran me about $2k, with the stiffest springs they offered and Koni adjustable shocks.  In retrospect, I spent more than I should have, but they are nice and I do enjoy them (my passengers don't enjoy them near as much). Were I to do it all over, I probably would go with something for about half the price, without the adjustable height.   Also, regardless of what you get, realize that you will probably need to spend a couple hundred extra to refresh things beyond just the struts/springs.  New spring pads are a must.  Depending on the state of your cars suspension, you'll probably want to replace the control arm bushings, and possibly even the control arms themselves.  The bushings on the swaybars should also be checked.  Tie rod ends, cv joints, wheel bearings, and such should be considered as long as you are in there.  And remember to keep a little extra cash for an alignment when all is done.  But we could fill page after page with suspension info.  An e30s simple and adaptable suspension is one of the things that make these cars so fun, and there is tons of info and options."

They are amazingly fun under ~40 mph.  The stock b25 always feels awkward when cruising at 30ish.  2nd gear seems too much, 3rd not quite enough.  The Etas are right at home.  With all that low-end torque, who needs first gear?    And gas mileage.  The b25 is pretty good, the Eta is amazing.  Also, a manual Eta with a 4.10 diff is a blast."

Propane is too whimpy.) to get the knuckle off the steering shaft can prove helpful. The last two I've done have been really stuck.But be careful, there's fuel lines nearby. A pickle fork or small prybar might also be a good thing to have on hand."
E30,343gea,karmat0se,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:00:29 2015 UTC,I do believe mine is stuck.. There only two 13mm bolts that you need to loosen to get it off correct? Where would I buy such a heat source?
E30,343gea,robobular,1 point,Sat May 2 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"On the knuckle? Should be. Just one on top, one on the bottom. Then the two fasteners holding the rack into the subframe. So yeah, go to the hardware store and grab a torch and a bottle of fuel. Blue is propane, Yellow is MAPP. MAPP is what you want. Heat the top part of the knuckle being mindful of the fuel lines that are right there and try and separate the knuckle from the steering column with a pry bar. Opening up the knuckle should also help.   If that doesn't work try the BFH and some kind of extension from the top side and bash away at it. A nice 3lb hand sledge and your longest 1/2"" extension you don't give a fuck about should do the trick.   Good luck!"

E30,341lop,pav413,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"I couldn't believe they cost $28,000 back in the 1980's."
E30,3410kz,karmat0se,6,Mon Apr 27 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"Cool old video. Definitely a press car being tested though, since it had the pearlbeige check cloth instead of houndstooth (which was only available on six-cylinder models), plus a digital clock and a 7k RPM speedo, which wouldn't have been standard.  It still seems weird to me that this pokey little 4-pot was released in the US, but the 323i wasn't."
E30,3410kz,Grrrmachine,2,Mon Apr 27 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I thought it was pretty cool. They also have one up for the '86 325e/635i (I think) as well somewhere. Nothing on the 325i/is though. Good spot on the options. But fwiw, my '84 318i had a digital clock and a 7K tach. Actually, I have the tach from it right here on my desk at the office. I had the digital clock in my 325is for a while before I got a 6-button OBC and then just deleted it all together.   Anyway, yeah. I agree that the 323i should have been released here but it was probably an emissions thing."
E30,3410kz,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"The best part was when they were initially describing it as ""dare we say, Japanese?"".  Maybe back then, but these days the e30 just screams 'European' to me."
E30,3410kz,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"Probably more about what sort of imports were available in the US at the time, rather than any particular styling aesthetic. The European Ford Escort was rebuilt for the US market, as was the Renault 9/11. I don't think you even got the Peugeot 305, and GM certainly wouldn't import the Ascona when it had so many American alternatives. The E30 is also light-years ahead of the contemporary Merc W123, and the Audi 80 (4000) was released a year later, so comparing a BMW to Japanese cars isn't a huge surprise really."
E30,3410kz,protomor,2,Tue Apr 28 07:00:32 2015 UTC,2400lbs? damn.
E30,3410kz,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Apr 27 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"Then add another 50lbs if it's got an auto box, and another 50lbs if it's a 4-door, and another 220lbs if it's got a proper 6-cylinder engine..."
E30,3410kz,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but back in the day BMW was all about 4 cylinders.  They even built their headquarters as a 4 cylinder."
E30,3410kz,protomor,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:02:19 2015 UTC,The weight became painfully apparent when towing it. A few years ago before my car could move under it's own power it had to find storage for the winter. My dad also had a 240Z that couldn't move under it's own power so we decided to split some storage and rent a tow dolly to move both cars on the same day. The tow vehicle had no issues moving the Z but was very lethargic with the E30 loaded up.   Just overbuilt I guess.
E30,3410kz,Twaletta,5,Mon Apr 27 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"the 240z is only 100lbs lighter.  I was saying ""damn"" more because it's so light. My E46 was 3400lbs. Most cars these days are 3500 or over."
E30,3410kz,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Apr 27 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  My '87 is 2750 from the factory.  An m20b25 isn't really super powerful, and it's really the lower weight of these cars that gives them halfway decent power.  It seems like the only performance oriented cars you see these days, with lower weights, in significant numbers are Miatas.  Years ago I used to play with a guy in a Miata on my drive home from work for a couple years.  We'd wind up next to each other once or twice a week on the back roads we used.  He'd take me in the twistys, I'd take him in the straights.  All I knew about the guy was that he worked nearby, and got off at the same time.  It was always friendly, but I never even knew his name,"
E30,3410kz,lastvegas,2,Mon Apr 27 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"hah, I misunderstood. For comparison, the Mk III Escort and the Opel Ascona, which were in the same class (if not luxury level), were only 1700 and 2000lbs respectively. Although I suppose E30 buyers would have looked at the Cortina instead of the Escort."

E30,3406al,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Apr 27 10:20:03 2015 UTC,This is the greatest news! I had a feeling that would be the case but I just wanted someone to confirm it. Thank you so much! :) can't wait to officially join the crew with my own beast
E30,3406al,fuckthepoliceagain,2,Mon Apr 27 10:55:47 2015 UTC,Look for signs of cracking before you buy enough direct sunlight and you're right back where you started if you find one on its way out. re-trimming is also an option may cost a bit more but it will also last a hell of a lot longer if you get it trimmed in real leather. Just my 2 cents
E30,3406al,Twaletta,5,Mon Apr 27 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Recovering with some nice, stitched leather can look really nice.  I've seen a few and it had almost an E46 kind of feel and look to it.   The cost might even approach the figure for a new OEM, assuming they are still available.   If the costs are close to equal, I would probably opt for the leather.  Like I said, it can look really nice, and doesn't seem out of place.  It's somewhat unique and very tasteful if done well, and I think it's easier to care for long term.  Here's a few examples I've found.  http://imgur.com/nq6v0QU  http://imgur.com/uMLp2kb  I've also seen a couple that adapted an e36 dash.  One looked pretty good, the other did not.  Don't have pics of those at the moment.  It would be significantly more work than any other option though.  Honestly, beyond the ""look-what-I-did"" uniqueness, it's not worth it."

E30,3406al,beefcakez,2,Tue Apr 28 01:48:25 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out that the state of the dashboard is probably the absolute lowest priority when buying one of these vehicles. Shell condition in terms of rust is by far the most critical, closely followed by lots of paperwork for services/repairs and a good lack of modifications. Little things like interior trim can be replaced in an afternoon, and even the dash can be swapped in a single day."
E30,3406al,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I'm aware of that. My boyfriend is a qualified crash repairer and works on euro cars day in day out. I won't have to fork out for panel work. But I am looking for something in decent condition - no rust is a must. As is service history, especially when some of them already have super high kilometers on the clock. I just want to know that I can get a new dash out of any E30 and it will fit :)"
E30,3406al,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"Uncracked dashboards can be somewhat rare, at least where I am in the south USA.  The heat and time just kills them if they weren't perfectly cared for over the years.  New ones from the dealer are listed around $800-900, and every one I've seen at junkyards had cracks.  We are also hitting the point where BMW is started to end production on some parts for this car, so I wouldn't count on a new one being available.  Again, I'm in brutal 100+ degree Texas.  Canada, just for example, might have a better pick at the yards.  If you get on the boards and forums, some people have actually done some sanding, filling and painting.  The end result can look really nice, but it is quite a bit of work.  I've also seen a couple dashes that were recovered with stitched leather that looked really nice, but it's not cheap to do.  A cracked dash is about the only major problem with my interior.  There are covers available too.  Even my PO (who was obsessive about upkeep) had his crack and put a hard cover on.  He was keeping an eye out for a good dash and actually seemed slightly embarrassed by it, but honestly, it doesn't look that bad.  Most of my passengers didn't realize it until I pointed it out.  E30 fans notice, but cracked dashes are so common that it's one of the first things we (well, at least me) check when we see an e30.    If you find more than one decent one at a wrecker for a good enough price, it could possibly be worthwhile to pick it up and resell."

It was a '99 323i with the sport package.    The thing I miss most about it was the m50's double VANOS.  It was akin to getting the best aspects of both the e30 325i and and 325e's in one engine.  It only had something like 185 f/lbs of torque, but you had access to more of it in a wider range...  But then again, every time I sorta miss that car I think of the royal PITA it gave me with the electronics, and that  replacing said electronics was usually far from cheap.

E30,33xyk2,Dr_octopus,4,Sun Apr 26 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm guessing it's 325es.  There's no vents in the valance for the oil cooler.  I love my 87'is, but for around town the Etas are really a blast.  Under 30mph those Etas have some go.  And, Doc Oc, I've had an alpineweiss 87is valance in my attic for almost ten years if you are looking.  Can't remember it's exact condition, but if you are interested, I need to get up there anyway before the Texas summer kicks in.  And, yeah, they do make the front end look a lot better, but then you wind up thinking the rear end looks naked without the apron the later models have.  And then all the aftermarket aprons make you start thinking the sides need skirts... And then you lose the 50 lb advantage the early cars had...   (I know it's only 50 lbs, but let me think it matters, please)"

E30,33xyk2,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 26 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"My first e30 was an '87e (no 's').  I paid $1200 for it with 250k miles, and I was both a noob to e30s and cars in general.  It had some issues.  Lowered with cut springs, center bearing on driveshaft was shot, horrid 3 spoke 17"" wheels.  The best description that I heard was that it looked like ""a Jamaican drug dealer's car"" (apologies to any Jamaicans here). But, it had some bonuses.  Beautiful black cloth Recaros, maplight mirror (I miss that the most), momo steering wheel, OEM 'is' valance/trunk spoiler, and a very nice and cleanly done setup to hold 6"" 2 piece component speakers all around.  Anyway, once I got the suspension back to stock height with Bilstein HDs, it was so much fun around town.  I think the Etas are one of the best 'grocery-getters' around.  All that low end torque was amazingly fun.  It blew a head gasket at 275k and I transferred all the goodies into a 160k 87is with a clean body/interior that I picked up for $800 with shot synchros on the tranny, which I swapped over.  The 'i' cars are nice at 35-40+ mph, but I still kind of miss the 'e' around the 'burbs.  As a bonus, the 'e' cars do get better MPGs.  Also, the 'i's m20b25 is a very durable motor, but I have a feeling the 'e's m20b27 will outlast most of them.  /end rambling/"
E30,33xyk2,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 26 23:00:28 2015 UTC,"I picked up this 87 es with 160k in MINT condition, plus 2 motorcycles (one that is a half finished cafe racer build) for 3 grand!   Head gasket timing belt and water pump and exhaust has been done. Not a single spot of rust anywhere. Aftermarket stereo and speakers and original black leather seats.   It's been a week and I still can't wipe the damn grin off my face.   The only issues it has is a seized window motor and it occasionally hesitates. I think It needs a new airflow sensor.   Other than that I've been looking smug as hell driving this around town.   Edit: It's an 86."
E30,33xyk2,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 26 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"Heh, anytime anyone tries to claim that BMWs are near perfect, just point out their track record with power windows and cooling systems...  My e46 that I had for 6 years blew a window motor or regulator, almost on schedule, once a year.  And anyone that goes off on a kick about how you should only do/use ""x"" or ""y"" with the cooling system because that's how ""BMWs engineers"" designed it, should be laughed at.  Cooling is the weak point on a lot of bimmers."
E30,33xyk2,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 26 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"Good to know I'll watch out for cooling problems. Water pump aside, what else goes bad? Old hoses? Clogged radiator?"
E30,33xyk2,Dr_octopus,2,Sun Apr 26 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"On a new (to you, at least) e30, I would say to look at anything and everything that's made out of rubber; bushings, hoses, belts, seals, gaskets, cv/ball joint boots, etc.  There are decent aftermarket parts suppliers out there, but generally (imho) if it's made of rubber, go OEM or equivalent.  How many miles does it have, and do you know when the timing belt was changed last?  If you don't know when, the timing belt should be priority number one.  A failed t-belt is a guaranteed engine rebuild."
E30,33xyk2,ggill1313,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"It's got about 160, but the odometers broken. The head gasket water pump and timing belt were replaced by the previous owner, so that's some good news. I've been going through the thing looking at all the hoses and such. So far I've only noticed a crack in the intake boot after the air box. I thought it was causing hesitation and power loss around 1500 rpm. I taped it up and cleaned out the airflow sensor and the problem went away, but came back with a vengeance yesterday. The weird part is that the shuddering only happens intermittently, and went away after a few minutes of driving."
E30,33xyk2,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"Things expand once the car warms up, and issues like that can temporarily vanish.  The intake boot is the first place to check when you are having idling issues, and you will have idling issues at some point.  I once fought with a rough idle for a month before I realized it was the little o-rings on the dipstick, so simple it was easy to overlook.  It could be the fact that I live in TX with brutal summer heat, but the intake boots are a common failure in my experience.  There are a few online sellers that make quality  'universal' boots in many, many different fitments that can be adapted cleanly to replace the factory boot.  That's my plan when mine cracks.  You can do a smoke test to find vac leaks.  Another quick option is to use carb cleaner from any auto parts store.  I would only use that if you suspect you are leaking from a specific spot, just spray it with a few quick shots and listen for a surge in the idle.  I've seen people go all out and start hosing every vac hose/connection with the stuff and I can't imagine it's all that good on the rubber, but if a hose looks like it might be a problem, its not that bad to confirm with it.  And it doesn't always work."

Just wanted to say that all the different forums (reddit, r3v, e30tech, bimmerforums, and others I'm missing) are incredible sources for tech issues, but if you've got $50 get online and order the Bentley manual.  The Hayne's and Chilton manuals, combined, don't have a third of the info of a Bentley.  I get so much use of mine that the binding wore out, so I had it put into a three ring binder (was like $10 at kinkos, and being able to open flat is a really nice plus) Even with nothing to repair, it's an extremely interesting read as it breaks down each section into the theory and implementation of all the ways the car is engineered."

E30,33wisp,choppysmash,3,Thu May 7 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"If the motor spun backward it likely screwed your timing up (timing belt is only held in tension on one side, the other side is naturally tensioned when the engine is spinning the correct way, if this direction is reversed the belt will get loose and jump several teeth.)   If you're lucky it is just slightly out of time and can't run, if it jumped a lot of teeth valves probably hit Pistons. If you can crank it over does is sound normal or does it sound like it is cranking over with way less resistance? Pull the oil cap and watch the cam while cranking. If it doesn't spin, valves hit pistons and the belt snapped. If it does spin take the timing cover off and see if you can set timing back in spec (use a new belt, do a water pump and everything else while you're in there if you haven't in a while.   Also learn how to automatic better lol."
E30,33wisp,fjacobs1000,2,Sun Apr 26 15:02:04 2015 UTC,It sounds like it turns over fine. I was afraid that your answer was going to be the answer as to what happened.

E30,33wisp,choppysmash,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:39:09 2015 UTC,You should be more worried about damage to the box.

Whip lashing sudden jerky stop?

In that case, crank the back end up, chock the front wheels, put the car in neutral, and then turn a wheel while counting how many times the propshaft (US: driveshaft) turns. That's your ratio.

It works a treat and conveniently fits into the boot tool kit.   Edit: I've only just realised that pelican sells these, I still recommend making your own, it is easy af."
E30,33oqow,Twaletta,2,Fri Apr 24 06:56:10 2015 UTC,"I've found that the simplest way to remove the fan is to get your wrench on the nut, and then hit the wrench with a hammer.  The sharp whack will almost always loosen the clutch enough that you can just spin the fan off the water pump by hand.    Since the fan spins opposite to the clutch thread's, its usually under very little torque.  Every time the motor is running it is essentially continuously re-tightening itself.  The only way it could spin off on its own would be if the motor somehow ran backwards.  It may speed up the process of reinstalling the fan clutch a little, but again, it doesn't really need to be on all that tightly.  I can usually thread it by hand at first, and then just spin the fan quickly (by hand, no hammer) just enough to get the blade moving relatively quick.  It's basically just using the a wrench in a similar way to a low torque impact wrench and doesn't hurt hurt the fan itself.  Anyway, do you think you could make yourself a thin wall wrench to get around the nut in the first place?  That's always been my problem with it."

E30,33hesw,hardclay,2,Wed Apr 22 15:27:17 2015 UTC,I would stay away from an ebay turbo kit. Some kits have been known to come nastily welded with bits of metal on the inside of the pipes that can break off and can wreck havoc on you engine.

Also the exhaust leak but you'll be replacing most of that system anyway with the turbo.

Everyone else will post some BMW variant knob that I'll see a few times at most meet ups and they're all great but I really prefer a unique one.  Shifting difference? Not really noticeable as it just feels like you're shifting and have good grip on it. A more heavily weighted one might be slightly better but I haven't tried.  Link"

E30,33dhhx,karmat0se,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:47:41 2015 UTC,E34 is still a pile of shit but it's gonna get worked on starting next week. Got a new space to wrench so I should be able to make short work of it. All parts are in so it should be quick.I got my E30 out now though so I 'm driving that full time for the next bit.  My cooling system is rad. It never overheats with the crazy ass low profile Spal fan I have and the GSP aluminum rad. I'd feel just fine driving in Toronto traffic with it (and that's without a shroud!). The only thing I don't like is my car bogs when the fan turns on because of the amp draw when it initially spins up. Only way I can figure to fix that is to add a capacitor though.
E30,33dhhx,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:34:03 2015 UTC,On an unrelated note.... We were doing wheel bearings on my e30 tonight and we can't get the outer race to separate from the part of the hub/arm that's connected to the car.... any tips?
E30,33dhhx,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:51:08 2015 UTC,"It's stuck in the trailing arm? What were you using to drive it out? I have this tool to essentially press it out of the trailing arm while still on the car. Works amazing. Also, make sure you've removed the circlip. If you haven't removed the circlip you will not get the bearing out.   Also, consider using heat on the trailing arm side. Not propane.. Something like MAPP gas. Propane won't get hot enough."
E30,33dhhx,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's stuck in the trailing arm and yes we removed the circlip. We used a tool very similar to that but it was something we made out of washers and threaded rod. The washers just crushed, I'm going back to the hardware store today and buying a bunch more washers. Used MAPP gas and an air hammer and it didn't budge.  On another unrelated note, the backingplate also won't come off, it's stuck under the guide for the e-brake cable. We unbolted that but it won't budge, does the e-brake cable need to be removed to pull that off?"
E30,33dhhx,dankpink,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:11:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah... you might have to stack up several washers to get something that won't just flex out. Or come grab my kit. The dies that came with my kit are at least 1/2"" thick and do the job fine so maybe aim for that. Also, maybe you could try and run some weld around the washers to beef it up and keep things together depending on the O.D. of the washers.   If you can't get it out on the car, you'll have to remove the trailing arms and take them to a machine shop to be pressed out with a press."

To me most of the rear aprons out there just don't look quite right unless you are willing to do side skirts as well.  Not many choices that are as simple and seamless looking as the later ones have stock.  The earlier e30s do have a lower wheel well on the rear fender, which I think looks better, but that's just personal opinion.  They also have chrome trim and shiny aluminum bumpers.  Those can, and should, be painted.  Again, though, personal opinion."

However, if it was run like this, I'd question it if you're wanting a ready-to-drive car now. If not and you plan to do a motor swap, then whatever.

Aside from the head gasket, that motor was still running strong at 280k.  The m20 is a seriously solid little engine.     Also, I had 2 radiators from '87s do that exact same thing.  Pretty common failure point."
E30,33a27t,Dzdimi14,3,Wed Apr 22 21:22:04 2015 UTC,radiators are pretty easy to swap out so id say yes for the right price.

Either way you need to pull it all apart, manually crank the roof back just enough to slide the headliner panel back, remove the sunroof panel (be careful with those screws, the brittle plastic side rails are likely already cracked there and may break), and then remove the plates that cover the cable tracks (held on with philips screws).  I'm not sure how the power sunroof works, but there should be some way to drop the motor and release the gear from the cables, and then you can pull the cables out and inspect them. Replace whatever's broken, lube it up (white lithium, or some use bicycle grease) and slap it back together  There are detailed how-tos on the internet for all this, and stuff in the Bentley manual (available on torrents if you don;t have the loot for one), but none of them are completely clear so if you have specific questions let me know and I may be able to help.  If you don't quite know how the sunroof mechanism works, what helped me best was going to a junkyard and tearing one apart there before doing it on my own car.

Lots of things seem to go wrong at that age.  Really low mileage cars may not be up to spec.  An average car puts maybe 10k on a year, and a lot of scheduled maintenance assumes that to some degree.  Time can wear some parts as much as mileage, and it has twice the time most cars with its mileage do.

E30,3350kn,Dasweb,5,Sun Apr 19 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"That's a complex question.  In my opinion mileage on these cars is not as important as maintenance.  My current car had about 170k when I bought it for about $4k, which may seem high, but it also came with a 2+ inch stack of maintenance papers/receipts going all the way back to it's first service inspection at the dealer.  It had two owners, the original buyer who sold it to his cousin and then bought it back several years later, and was dealer maintained for most of its life.  My first e30 (a 325e) had 300k on it and blew a head gasket. The only reason I didn't fix it was because I bought a family members 325is with a bad tranny for $800 with a better body, and then used the old one as a parts car, making one nice car out of two that were ""ok"".  I pulled the head and block from the 300k car to sell to someone and it was still almost perfectly in factory spec.  Anyway, my point is that high mileage isn't necessarily a big deal.  The m20 is an extremely solid and reliable little engine (I don't know shit about the m42s, though) .  If the motor is in good shape, don't worry as much about mileage much beyond the timing belt.  Instead, pay attention to the body (rust, paint, etc), the interior, and rubber components (bushings, hoses, seals), and other wear parts like shocks and clutch.  For cars that will have a minimum of 24 years on them, high 100s is actually pretty reasonable.  Look at condition and maintenance first if the mileage worries you.  I drove six hours across two states to check out and buy my car after a 30 minute Q&amp;A with the owner about the cars history.  Mileage does matter, yes, but it can be reasonably superseded and overshadowed by other factors."

I've gone through them enough to know what it's basic story is.  My PO was damn near obsessive.  Even has copies of emails sent to resolve issues with parts suppliers and a little book detailing his last 7+ years of refuelings, along with the mileage and MPG calculations each time and notes as to why he thinks it would fluctuate.  It is comforting to know it was previously loved.  When the odometer failed at 153k he immediately had the dealer fix it in the correct, legal way, with the sticker in the door detailing the info.  Considering the records he kept, I have no reason not to believe him.  I bought it with about 25k on the new one, and have put another 30k in two years.  If it wasn't down for 6 months I probably would have put another 10k.  Granted, 7k of that were trips back and forth to CO from TX.  Yeah, I put lots of miles on cars.  I enjoy driving more than a little.  /End tangent."

Really, one of the big reasons many people sell their lower mileage e30 is because they know it's about to start turning into a money pit."
E30,3350kn,Twaletta,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:41:13 2015 UTC,"I made this mistake buying an E36 M3 2 years ago. I found a very nice (""nice"") condition 100.3k mile 1995 M3 for a decent price. Seemed like a steal. After a pre-purchase inspection by a BMW specialist who found noting alarming, I offered $500 off of the asking price expecting a hard counter. The dealership took it immediately. I thought ""that was odd"" and I went on my way.   I enjoyed the hell out of that car with lots of spirited driving, some autocross, and turning of wrenches, but over my 2 years of ownership I spent just under $4k in parts. Nothing major (no drive train issues) just all kinds of worn out rubber and plastic. If it was non-metal it needed replacing.  After all, I found the experience fairly rewarding. I learned a tremendous deal about cars replacing all of those parts and I had a good time doing it,   But that 100k mile marker doesn't mess around."

The only real difference is that the top of the 'wings' isn't as straight as a genuine BMW one.   BTW, you don't have to buy a support for pre-facelift models only.

Like I said, the only difference are the hooks (actually loops) for towing. The one you linked has them on it, so it should be an identical fit.   You can see them here right under the bumper shocks  I'd go ahead and buy that one you linked. I don't think you'll find a better price.  Also, if you're going to replace it, make it removable for future engine work. Check my build thread for how I did it to mine (Part 2, IIRC).   It's totally worth the [very little] extra effort to get it that way. Working on timing belts or pulling engines is a breeze now."

Edit: I see another guy here with them for $100. Probably your best shot.    Edit 2: also, if the welding is done properly and they are in good shape, you can probably find a buyer.  Ground Control charges about $100 per (not counting core deposit), to give you a basic idea of the value.  They do powder coat them for the money, but still, you could probably get $50/each."

I put the stat back in, and it acted like every other thermostat the first time it runs.  It creeped up to about half, I hit the throttle to give it a kick, and it dropped right back down to 1/4.  Edit: hmm.  It might be the 75 degree thermostat doing it.  I'm gonna just hold off a month and see how it handles a Texas summer.

E30,32ynyg,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:52:13 2015 UTC,Weird I've never heard of that before. I'm in a 318 with an M42 though so maybe there's only one thermo for this engine? Am I wrong
E30,32ynyg,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know much of anything about the m42, but it probably does have a couple different ones.  Most cars have several thermostat options that open at different temps depending on your climate.  I went with the lowest temp (75) thinking it would help with Texas heat since I had cooling issues last summer, and I overcompensated. I believe the m20 usually came with a 80 degree (c) thermostat.  Extremely cold climates can usually get ones that open later so the car can warm up quicker and stay at the preferred temp range.    95% of the time the 80 degree is fine if your cooling system is up to spec."

E30,32wvdq,fuckthepoliceagain,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question to answer. I've only had my 318i for about 1 month and I've looked into it a little but there's still plenty more to go.   If it's rebuilt with everything well within tolerance it should potentially double the life or even last longer than that depending on the motor, how many bugs worked out and who did the work.   It definitely helps being meticulous but you will need the right tools and machines as well. The work you can do yourself is disassemble it all and clean everything as best as possible. Then hand it over to a shop to do the decking, valve, and cylinder work. And get the crank and cam shafts polished. You should be able to reassemble it, especially since you saw how it all came apart . You will need special tools for putting the piston/rings back in as well as the valves/springs. Auto part stores may rent out the tools. They shouldn't be that expensive. If you're feeling a bit risky then you can use zip ties to compress the springs and reinstall the retainers. I've done it on a 1.5l Honda but these springs are probably a bit stiffer so I don't know if I'd recommend it. If you're careful, you can use plasti gauge like any other shop would to measure what size bearings for the crank you will need. Not sure if different sizes are available but most makes will give you a hand full of different sizes varying by a couple thousandths of an inch to choose from so you can get the best fit. You might want to replace the rod studs too as those will stretch the same as head studs. Forgot to mention, just replace all the valves for longevity. You'd have to pay to pay for the labor and machining on the old valves anyways. The valve seats will need work either way  Thats about all I can think of off the top of my head while I'm on my cell killing time in the dmv."

He went with black pleather, and I think he said he redid the padding on the two front seats.  I could dig through the big pile of maintenance receipts/records, but I think I recall that he paid ~$650 for the covers and installed them himself.  The front pic is conveniently cropped to ignore a cigarette burn, my fault. The rear is because it's been in the garage for six months from when I did the subframe bushings.  Haven't gotten around to popping it in after I got her going this past week.  It's just covered in sawdust.  http://imgur.com/LStHVaj http://imgur.com/SJBOhlb  My PO was the original buyer (well, actually Red Adair owned it for about 1k miles first), sold it to his cousin for a few years, and then bought it back.

E30,32q6jr,Twaletta,5,Wed Apr 15 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"The DIY clutch stop.  Many of you guys have probably already done this, but for those who haven't, you should.  I was putting mine back on and figured I'd put this out there for the uninformed.  You can find premade clutch stops for $20-30, but this does the exact same thing for less and without waiting for a shipped order.  Go to Lowe's or Home Depot (Lowe's usually has a slightly better selection of metric fasteners) and buy this stuff, usually in the drawers in the hardware aisle.  If it costs more than $8 I'd be surprised.  Up on the front firewall behind the clutch pedal you will see a flat (probably worn down pretty good) round piece of plastic, which is the factory (wholly inadequate) clutch-stop.  You can see it without taking anything apart.  Unscrew it.  Assemble the parts in the order they are shown, and screw it them in most of the way.  Don't tighten the nut down onto the lock washer yet, leave it loose.  Find a flat and level spot in a parking lot or driveway.  Push the clutch in all the way and slowly let it out.  When you feel the clutch start to engage, adjust the new stop up or down.  Repeat until you have it at a point where the clutch engages just little ways after you start letting off.  Tighten the nut down onto the lock washer to lock it down and take it for a spin.  Make absolutely sure the clutch is completely un-engaged when the pedal is in as far as the stop allows, otherwise you will be essentially riding the clutch every time you shift.  It will seem a little strange at first, but you will quickly realize that having virtually zero play in the clutch pedal will give you faster, tighter shifting and takeoffs.  Everyone that has driven my car with this has loved it after a few tries to get the hang of it.  As time goes by and your clutch wears in, you will have to adjust it down a small amount, I usually check it 3 or 4 times a year and usually adjust maybe once out of those times.  Your clutch will wear in slower as well, since you don't have the slop.  Ideally, if you don't mind a wait, you can probably order the m10 bolt in an ""elevator bolt"" with a much bigger cap (probably won't find one in the States), but honestly, it probably won't make a difference in the end, other than eliminating the plastic cap which can wear out.  Those caps usually come in 4 packs, so it's not really a big deal.  Combine with a short shift kit for an amazing experience."

E30,32q6jr,Shigidy,2,Thu Apr 16 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would say to hold off putting one in until you're comfortable with a manual.  The extra play without one makes the clutch a lot more forgiving for a beginner.  With a tightly adjusted clutch stop anytime you stall it the car is going to jump and buck a lot more forcefully.  It will be harder on the transmission, driveshaft, guibo (a bushing on the DS), and the differential.  My first car was a manual Honda and my training consisted of ten minutes in a parking lot with my pop, and then getting thrown to the wolves for a 45 minute drive to a class the next morning.  You'll have the basics down, no problem, within a week.  After 2 or 3 weeks it'll start to feel completely natural shifting up and down through the gears.  Put a clutch stop in once you find yourself cruising around and shifting smoothly without even thinking about it, because then you'll have to start thinking about the stop instead.  Basicly, don't force your head to have to think about more than one concept at a time.  Once you've got running with the clutch stop figured out and are completely comfortable, get online and look up ""heel-toe rev matching"".  That's where the real fun kicks in.  .....and shit.  I just realized I started driving 17 years ago....  Half my damn life...  Getting older sucks."

Also my oil sensor to the OBC is disconnected bc the PO put in a third part gauge and my windshield spray/head light wiper is non functional atm and both light up my check lights... my check light is forever flashing.

E30,32l9qh,e3027,3,Tue Apr 14 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I'm trying to remember if the one 4-door I had did that with the window or not.  All three of my coupes had it, so I know it's not just a problem with mine.  I suppose it could be a 1987 thing, as all of mine have been the same year..."
E30,32l9qh,cosmicandshit,4,Tue Apr 14 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"Just went to check. I have an 85 euro sedan. The window drops all the way down but leaves 1/4"" up, but that 1/4"" up is covered by the 1/4"" of bottom weather stripping so I've almost never noticed it. It is tapered, so the side closest to the lock sticks up just barely past that weather strip and then disappears into it about 1/3 of the way in."

E30,32l9qh,Deltigre,2,Tue Apr 14 19:20:12 2015 UTC,The window on my 84 coupe looks exactly the same as it does on the other 84 coupe that I know of. Maybe this is an American market coupe issue?   The thing I dislike most about my e30 is its lack of power. 121hp is really not enough.
E30,32l9qh,protomor,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:29:09 2015 UTC,But the Etas have all that low end torque...  They are fun in their own ways.
E30,32l9qh,fuckthepoliceagain,2,Tue Apr 14 20:00:51 2015 UTC,The eta is definitely a lot of fun. It is the most fun street car I have ever driven. I think it would be just about perfect with the e to i head swap.
E30,32l9qh,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"The Etas are really fun around town and in situations with more stop-and-go driving.  They've got a little more torque than the 'i's, and it's right there from the takeoff.  Without knocking them, I think they are fun little grocery getters.  To get anything out of the 'i's you've gotta keep those RPMs up near 4k, the Etas have a lot of power right off the line.  I have a feeling that most eta engines will outlast the 'i's, and with better gas mileage to boot.  A friend of mine used to joke that he really wanted to put a trailer hitch on his eta just because the car had the torque to handle small trailers.  It ain't always about the horsepower.  I might be wrong, but wouldn't you lose a lot of what makes them fun if you swapped the 'i' head?  Wouldn't the final result would be an engine that acts like an 'i' but with increased displacement?"

E30,32l9qh,dream__weaver,7,Wed Apr 15 00:53:17 2015 UTC,The engine bay is huge when you have half as many cylinders :P

E30,32l9qh,BMW_325is,3,Thu Apr 16 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"FWIW, My '87 window goes all the way into the door. Just sayin'.  As for things I don't like about my car specifically...    My seat (a Corbeau Forza) needs a little more rake in it but I'll pull it out and shim it up eventually. Or install my Momo Starts.... But that requires fab work. The exhaust hangs a bit low because one of the midpipes was a bit cocked when the vbands got welded on so it's not tucked up as much as it should be. But the BavAuto headers hang low anyway so I'm not sure it would have made much of a difference. My bumper is silver, my car is black. It's been like that for four years and I'm too lazy to fix it.  My Hello Kitty horn button stopped working. Bit of a shame, really.  That god damn decaying and sticky as fuck hockey tape around the entire wiring loom. The trunk lock is fucked. Again, i can fix it but pure procrastination keeps me from caring. The headlights are horrid. You can't see shit with the low beams but the highs would light the entirety of North Korea. I really need to get on an H4 upgrade.    .... But the thing I hate the most is that the E30 is a fucking dude magnet.   Edit: I also forgot how much I hate the window switches and that I need to wire in my E36 switches sooner than later. Central locking can also lick my sack (when it decides it wants to stop working)."

E30,32j6x9,cosmicandshit,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:40:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and thanks for the feedback, guys!  I agree the product is positioned at the higher end of the market, but I really feel that once you've seen and used it, you'll love it. I built this to be the cup holder I would want in my own car. The material is a carbon-fiber filled ABS composite that has a very unique look and feel, yet this is subtle, so the cup holder looks like it really belongs there from the factory.  I like staying caffeinated and hydrated, and as far as I looked, there's actually nothing out there for an E30, or any car for that matter, that can securely hold both a Nalgene / Klean Kanteen or a Red Bull, and essentially everything in between in the same design. During development, I drove around town one day to buy popular drink containers and to collect cups from every single food place. Some just gave me the cup, some made me buy a drink, and some even had a separate SKU they could ring up for a cup with no drink inside. I distinctly remember having to pee a lot that day.  This will hopefully be just the first in a complete suite of products for the E30. I'm really excited about what else GearSwitch has in the works for E30s, and can't wait to show them.  Please let me know if you guys have any more questions about this product, about the pre-sales, about GearSwitch in general, or about even what my favorite beverages are. AMA. Thanks!"

E30,32j6x9,zanmiller,2,Tue Apr 14 12:46:14 2015 UTC,wow. I have one of those crappy screw in cup holders crudely attached to my console (previous owner). This looks like a fantastic idea!
E30,32j6x9,Tristan_96,2,Tue Apr 14 16:11:21 2015 UTC,I would recommend selling a whole kit together and also a downgraded version with all the attachments sold separately so a price can be more pocket friendly

You're responding to all these posts with a formula of self promotion and peddling it like damn billy mays, but uh hey, yeah $99 for a cup holder is more than I'm willing to spend. Cut that number in half and you'd be in business.   How much does it cost to produce one of these? What's your markup on them because I know a roll of filament itself isn't close to that price."
E30,32j6x9,Twaletta,3,Wed Apr 22 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"When I first got my E30, one of the very first things I missed from a newer car is simply having a cup holder. So I did the only thing I knew to do and I fired up the CAD program and designed one that I felt would be proper in our ""Ultimate Driving Machines"".  After lots of hard work, over two dozen iterations, tons of testing, and lots of process improvement it's time to show this to the world and offer it up for pre-sale.  The GearSwitch E30 Ultimate Cup Holder. Pre-sale / crowdfunding is happening now, and shipments will begin in May. $99 fully-loaded for early pre-sales buyers. http://gearswitch.us  I've been working very hard on this, and hope that this is the first in a line of highly-customized, direct-digitally-manufactured products for our E30s.  Thank you!"
E30,32j6x9,cosmicandshit,6,Tue Apr 14 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"It looks like a lot of thought went into the design, especially with the sizing inserts.  The only significant issue I see is the price.  100 bones seems a little steep.  Granted, I don't know the production cost for you, so maybe it's unavoidable.  How does it lock in place?  Is it just a pressure fit?  Also, since you seem to have the manufacturing capability, do you have any thoughts on modifying the basic design for other functions?  For example, many years back in my first e30, I managed to forgive the lack of a cup holder, but really missed an having armrest and didn't want to drill into my console to mount one.  I made one out of a piece of a 4x4 wooden post (it may have been 6x6 post, though).  Added I used a piece of pvp pipe for the bottom insert, some padding on top and some simple upholstery and, bingo, I had an armrest.  Maybe it's a weird mod, but whatev.  Just something to think about.  But anyway, it looks pretty damn good, reservations about price aside.  Edit: I also kinda liked the /r/wheredidthesodago -esque intro.  Seriously, those things amuse me."
E30,32j6x9,jgv,2,Tue Apr 14 06:36:54 2015 UTC,The one in my car is leather and handmade and was less expensive :/ Inserts into that little slot the same too   I get that this is a preorder though and it's more of a way of supporting this guys good idea.

E30,32j6x9,89bmwm3,0,Wed May 13 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the questions and feedback!  One of the key design considerations I had when I made this is absolute ease of installation.  It has a foam backed automotive-grade tape on 5 spots in the base, which comes shipped with the backing still in place. So it stays in place in one of two ways:  1) Just drop it in and it will press fit. It is very very secure this way. I've been testing it in spirited drives on twistys with a Nalgene and Super Big Gulp both totally loaded and just press fit, and it stays totally put. 2) Take off the backing on the tape, and the installation is then semi-permanent. The top removes from the bottom after removing two screws to allow taking off the bottom without damaging anything should you sell the car and decide to keep the cupholder.  I'll see if I can mount up a camera and do a one-take video with mounting the cupholder using the ""just drop it in"" method with some big full cups and go find some twisty roads or even an autocross to drive.  The small pocket at the rear is there for storing coins, receipts and such, but also serves as an anchor point for a future arm rest upgrade.  Thanks!"

E30,32ipxf,skottles,3,Tue Apr 14 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"Never heard of them, but a lot of those parts sites are owned by the same companies with different addresses to try diversify there visibility.  You can try searching Google for the site with 'review' in it, and you might find something.  Also, a lot of those sources generally sell aftermarket parts with dubious quality and they may not tell you the brand.  Have you checked 'AutohausAZ.com"" or 'FCPeuro.com'?   Those are my go-to parts sources, and (sometimes) I use PelicanParts.  Years ago FCP had a pretty crappy reputation over parts quality and customer service.  Over the last 4 or 5 years they made some significant changes.  Now they clearly state the brand, and for many things they have multiple brand choices and pricing to pick from.  From my personal experience they have improved customer service as well.  Check those guys and factor in shipping.  One is usually a bit less than the other, depending on the specific part."

E30,32iml4,lastvegas,2,Tue Apr 14 03:43:48 2015 UTC,I would not buy it at all if it wasn't running properly when I test drove it. For reference I bought my 1984 325e with an engine that was running perfectly for $2000. It sounds like this car has potential to be a money pit.
E30,32iml4,e3027,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:43:08 2015 UTC,"How was the body on yours? This one does not have one single spot of rust. New head gasket, water pump, timing belt intake boot and exhaust. Only thing wrong is the passenger window motor is broken and the dash is cracked slightly. I drove it again today, it drives like a dream. He wants $2,500. Is that too high? What could it resell for?"
E30,32iml4,e3027,2,Thu Apr 16 03:07:36 2015 UTC,My car has not rust on it at all. The paint is very faded but that is pretty much the only issue. The dash is cracked a little to but not enough to really bother me. The value does depend a little on where you are in the United States. I would say that $2500 is probably all right. I would try to get it down a little bit more to $2200-$2300.   Resale is based on the demands of the market so if you buy the car for between $2000-$2500 I would guess you could turn around and sell it for the same price. I hope this helps. Good luck!
E30,32iml4,rudbri93,2,Thu Apr 16 04:00:48 2015 UTC,If hes wrapping E-tape around the intake boot god only knows what else hes doing to it. If the body is clean then Id say its probably worth a grand.
E30,32iml4,joshamania,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:21:32 2015 UTC,"He said he was going to replace it. The point of the electrical tape was to show me that the intake boot was the cause of the rough idle and power loss, and it was an easy fix. I actually think he spends some time and money on this car because when I met him I was buying another car he had listed and just happened to ask if he would sell his e30. He was in it replacing a window electrical switch. So at least I know he does something instead of just let it sit there.   I'm gonna look really closely at the car before I buy it, but I like $1000. That's the price I had in my head when I saw it, but I wasn't sure what these old things were worth. Figured I better ask the experts."

E30,32dh38,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 12 21:49:50 2015 UTC,"My 1987 325is (Husker) is rolling again.  I rear ended someone (my fault, totally) and after some body work on the front I figured since she was out of commission why not do some other stuff.  I installed 440f/750r GC coilovers, Remus exhaust, control arms/bushings, wheel bearings, timing belt/WP, hoses, fan clutch, radiator, poly engine/tranny mounts, guibo, subframe and trailing arm bushings, and a few interior repairs like dome lights and OBC backlight, etc.  I'm probably forgetting some stuff I did, but it's been a minute.  Somehow I forgot to get a front strut brace, but at some point I will.  Also got a UUC Short shifter with DSSR.  It is absolutely fantastic. 10/10 would reccomend.  Probably my favorite upgrade. A little notchy, but tight and crisp.  With some help from the collision, I tucked and painted the front bumpers, the rear is next on the list, and I still need to mount up all the front trim, like the kidneys and headlights, valance, etc.  I should probably put the hood back on as well.  I happened to come into a bit of cash, so I went a little nuts.  Normally couldn't afford this kind of overhaul.  She's not legal yet, but I still took her for a spin.  Like a whole new car.  I still need to play with the suspension to figure out exactly where I want it, but initial impressions are great.  Here's the before: http://imgur.com/u4bYuqp  And nothing here is actually bolted on, but you get the basic idea of what it's going to look like: http://imgur.com/2KiTZjY  This coming week I plan on pulling the front seats out and giving the interior a hard core cleaning.  The previous owner recovered the seats about 3 years back (I've had her for 2) so she looks good inside."
E30,32dh38,brahbarian,2,Sun Apr 12 22:05:16 2015 UTC,Love it.  Beautiful car.  How does the 750 rear feel? I'm running 540 front and 600 rear. A bit bouncy. I'm on bilstein sports.
E30,32dh38,zacrl1230,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"My initial impressions are from only about 30 minutes, but I dig it so far.  It's got some bounce, but I haven't really played with the setup much and I also have construction on literally every major road I commonly use here in north Texas (Plano/Frisco area). I might dial down the single adjustable konis a little bit to compensate until some of this construction ends.  I might also bring it up just little higher.  I love the '87 'is' valance, but it does hang lower than the later plastic bumper versions.  I didn't get heavier swaybars (yet) because it might be a bit too much with my current roads.  I'm about to mount the grills/headlights/hood so I can be less of a cop magnet and maybe get some more road time.  It's insured, but not registered/inspected.  I can get out of those tickets, but I'm just asking to get pulled over with it looking like this: http://imgur.com/wTa4VUE"

If the timing belt and water pump were recently replaced, you should be good. If you're really cautious you could have it taken to an auto shop and have them do a thorough inspection for $50 or something."

Love that is hard to give it when your at school while you're worried about a midterm, the hot blonde in bio 1, and everything else.

E30,32beq6,nakdamink,2,Sun Apr 12 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"Do not buy an e30 for college, especially if you're a really busy student with academics and sports. You won't have the time to repair the things that are surely going to be crap on a 20+ year old car. Plus, you need to spend your money on other things that are more important.   Buy a Toyota or Honda for cheap. Sell it to some other college kid when you graduate and then buy the e30."
E30,32beq6,beefcakez,2,Mon Apr 13 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"Do not bother unless you have plans to do preventative maintenance. A LOT of it. I've done these in the past four months:  -Valve adjustment  -Valve cover gasket replacement  -New springs and shocks  -Oil change  -ATF change  -Diff and Brake fluid change  -New O2 sensor  -New headlights, foglights and taillights  -All bulbs replaced  -New wiring harness  -New air/fuel/oil filters  -Coolant flush and change  -New rear bushings for the suspension  -New tyres and wheels  -New hoses, ICV and battery  The last thing I need to do that's crucial, is replace the timing belt, water pump, cam seals, thermostat, and the tensioner.   E30s are old and simple, but they need love and care. Sometimes you need to throw money at them, but once you have done everything necessary, something will still pop up. It's an old car. However, if you take care of it, it will not leave you stranded."
E30,32beq6,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,2,Mon Apr 13 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"As you're well aware, most of this was covered in the other thread.  For your specific application: Four adults trying to cram themselves and their sports kit in an E30 is not going to be fun after the first time. It will be slow, thirsty, hot and cramped. And if you don't have a toolkit or any mechanical experience, you're simply asking for trouble.  Own a 20+ year old car if you like a hobby and fancy a weekend adventure. DO NOT buy one when you, and especially other people, rely on it for daily transport. This applies to all old cars, not just the E30."
E30,32beq6,Grrrmachine,2,Sun Apr 12 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"20 years is about the time everything on the car becomes a wear item. Rubber degrades, plastic degrades, paper gaskets degrade. Oil leaks are normal, and you may risk catastrophic coolant loss our water pump failure without preventive replacement.  I bought my car with the expectation is still mostly be commuting by bicycle and bus, and while it's been very reliable the last couple of years as a daily driver and occasional track car, it's taken a significant amount of preventive maintenance to keep that reliability."
E30,32beq6,Deltigre,2,Sun Apr 12 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"What the others said.  Also, unless you have a pile of money to throw at the car for a major restoration or overhaul, you can't really plan on learning to be a mechanic in a few months.  Even if you could do that, it will consume you're entire summer.  You need something to fix before you can fix it.  You could learn the basic theory of how engines and stuff work, but until you've gotten your hands dirty (literally) you won't really know what you're doing."
E30,32beq6,Twaletta,2,Sun Apr 12 17:59:16 2015 UTC,I live in the East Bay and I go to college in LA. I DD and e30 and it is really not a problem. Yes things wear out and need to be replaced but if you keep up on maintenance it is very reliable. A civic/corolla is probably a better idea but if you really want to you could have the e30. You just need to make sure you have spare cash for when things break. It is an easy car to work on and you can definitely learn to work on it yourself. I would say you need to have at least $1000 of oh shit money if your going to be DDing an e30. Economically an e30 as a DD is probably not the best decision but it is so much fun especially on back roads.
E30,32beq6,e3027,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"I have one as my college car, DD, whatever you want to call it. Have had it since I was 13 (been caring for it with the intention of it being mine at 16) and I'm 19 now. Love it. It's been great for me.  Just plan on spending $500-1500 realistically to make it as reliable as a newer car. Because it's getting older, most of the time you'll have to get your hands dirty or start lightening your wallet. My car has been super reliable while meanwhile my friend's newer cars (Mini Cooper S and STI) have had significantly worse issues in the past few months.  Disclosure: I'm an engineering student and know how to fix it. I've done car repairs all my life. YMMV"
E30,32beq6,13515m0r3,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"I DD my e30 and take it to college (almost) every day. My commute is 5 miles there, and 5 miles back. As others have said, it's not the most reliable car. Lots of things could go wrong with these, and if you can't fix them yourself, it'll be a money pit. I've changed the oil filter, the oil (a few times), air filter, fuel filter, fuel lines, coolant (a few times), radiator, radiator hoses, thermostat, shock mount, valve cover gasket and have done a valve adjustment. I've also changed a few sensors.  A mechanic has changed my water pump, timing belt and head gasket (bought the car with a minor head gasket leak so it needed this eventually). The car is pretty reliable for me now. The only time I couldn't really take it to school was last week when my exhaust fell out of place when I was driving, but that was fixed the next day. The car is really fun to own and a great DD if you know what needs to be changed, but I assume you won't have a lot of time to work on it since you're going to Berkeley, so I wouldn't suggest getting one."

Does it seem a bit overpowered in the chassis or to carve canyons? I would hate to have a so much horsepower, that its unusable."
E30,32b7w8,cosmicandshit,3,Sun Apr 12 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you took the instrument cluster from a bigger-engined car. Some models had 63litre tanks, others only 55litre, and the fuel gauges are matched to the tank size. You need to fit the fuel gauge from your old cluster into your new one.  I've not heard of a slow odometer before; it's normally the tachometer that goes wrong when people swap clusters, because the wrong coding plug is fitted (the white plastic block in the bottom left corner)."
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:24:43 2015 UTC,I've read that it's sending the gauge an incorrect voltage etc  The fuel gauge is apparently a common problem but tonight I got in and the whole cluster just stopped working except for the speedometer   I started it and the rev counter fired up and then just dropped to 0 after a sec. Also the anti-lock and battery lights stayed on for a few seconds  Then everything stopped working and now nothing works at all it's just back lit
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,3,Sun Apr 12 08:39:28 2015 UTC,"As I said before, E30s had two types of fuel tanks. The bigger tanks had two level senders with a combined resistance of 120 ohms, and a gauge to match. Smaller tanks used a single 60 ohm sender, which is why you're getting the wrong reading. There is no fix to this - you have to fit the right gauge for your tank.  For your other problems, are you sure everything's plugged in correctly? There are only two plugs on the back (three if you have OBC) so if one is loose you'll get all sorts of screwy issues. Of course, if the SI batteries are old and have leaked, then their acid may have ruined the circuit board, making this cluster complete scrap."
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:56:42 2015 UTC,"What is obc?  Also, since I didn't fit this cluster, is it possible to replace just the fuel gauge alone?"
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,2,Sun Apr 12 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"OBC = On-board Computer, the 6- or 13-button clock.  The fuel gauge just unscrews once you have the back of the cluster off, so that's simple enough. To get the cluster out, check this guide.   But before you start disturbing all that, check that your reverse lights work. If they don't then Fuse 10 has blown (which kills your instruments), and this is normally caused by damage to the reverse light wire around the gear lever."
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:07:01 2015 UTC,"Oh my god thank you!!!! The funny thing is, I asked my friend to get out and check my reverse lights, and no dice. I'm like , ok weird, then the instruments go haywire.   Ok one last little problem. When comparing my speedo to my friends 2007 325i on the freeway, his read about 7 mph slower than mine. Any chance this is also because my cluster is from a different engine?"
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,2,Sun Apr 12 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"This is more likely that you have different sized tyres.   Every time the rear wheels go round, the differential also turns. Inside the diff is a ring of metal that looks like a daisy - every time a petal sweeps past a sensor, it sends a pulse to the speedo. The speedo is calibrated to match X pulses to Y miles an hour.  If you make your tyres bigger or smaller than the original 205/55R15 tyres, then you'll change the number of pulses per mile, which buggers up your speed reading. So either you or your friend have gone the cheap/stance/lazy approach to buying tyres."
E30,32b7w8,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:02:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. Yeah the wheels were just replaced before I bought it. I'm playing catch-up with all the work that's gone into the car. It's had a ton of resto and it's in great shape but there are little things like this that are really irritating. I assumed the tires would have been the right size. Frustrating.  Is it very complicated to recalibrate the speedo for diff sized tires?"
E30,32a0ej,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,4,Sat Apr 11 23:02:43 2015 UTC,A 10mm socket will take apart like half of your car.
E30,32a0ej,rainy0days,2,Sun Apr 12 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"Sockets - from 8mm up to 24mm. Spanners of the same range - crescent and box type. Ratchet spanners are SO helpful in tight situations if you can stretch the budget. Various socket extensions. There's a few larger sockets required, but I can't recall what for. For 90% of tasks the middle range will suffice. E30s have lots of 13mm nuts.  Try and buy towards the better end of the quality spectrum. It's mildly irritating when you're in the middle of a fiddly task and the ratchet clockwise/anti-clockwise locking tab floats from one side to the other because it's cheaply made. Nice tools make working on your car a lot more pleasurable (so you only have to swear at the car, and not the tools as well).  A good sized breaker bar can come in handy when tackling stubborn nuts/bolts.  10mm box wrench is recommended if you need to adjust valve clearances. And a thin skinny hex/allen key (3mm) to insert into the back of the rocker eccentric to hold it in place - or just a stiff piece of wire...whatever works.  Itty bitty 7mm crescent spanner for the brake bleeder valves.  Replacing tranny oil requires a 24(?)mm male hex bit - something to add to your socket set collection. Check this before buying as there's a few different drain plug configurations.  Oil pan magnetic drain nut is 17mm (if memory serves).  Oil filter wrench to loosen/tighten the oil filter when replacing. Feeler gauges for gaping plugs/valve clearance. Shop towel to wipe the dipstick when checking oil levels. A good quality middle-of-the-range torque wrench (<150 ft/lb) will cover you for most tasks.  As others have said, start with a good quality socket/spanner set and go from there. You may discover that a particular size offset box wrench makes your life much easier for one task (eg, undoing the 4 nuts on the centre exhaust clamp, or getting between the transmission and the vibration damper on the front of the drive shaft).   Water pump replacement is easier when you have the special pulley holding tool. Not something you're going to need immediately (unless you plan on replacing your fan clutch/water pump sometime soon).  Consider a good range of hex/allen keys (or sockets attachments) as a next purchase. Each brake rotor has a little (5mm?) allen screw.  Jack stands, trolley jack...set of garage overalls. Plastic containers to keep stuff in. Zip lock bags, Sharpie. Decent camera you don't mind getting dirty if you want to take photos for a more involved task.   A good digital multi-meter is useful for diagnosing electrical gremlins and checking the health of some parts.  At some point you might need internal/external circlip pliers. Not a common tool for 95% of tasks.  A good digital micrometer? Again, not something you're likely to need for most tasks.  Your toolkit should develop based on your choice/taste/needs (and budget!). I spent a fair number of $s on a Stahlwille set of spanners, they cost more than most but they're an absolute pleasure to use - and I feel confident I'm not going to round the top of the nut, like some cheaper no-name brands can do. Buy what you can afford as and when you need it."
E30,32a0ej,SgtMajorZero,2,Sun Apr 12 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately too late, or way too early, but if you can hold off until the Christmas season you can get some really good prices on mechanics tools.  Lowe's usually has a 200+ piece (1/4, 3/8, and 1/2) socket set for $100.  I used to work there, and although I'm not happy with the company due to the method of my departure, they have (imho) the best hand tools for the money (comparing craftsman/husky/kobalt and ignoring matco/snapon/mac) During Christmas most of it is half-price.  For the most part you can ignore SAE sizes and focus on metric.  As previously said, 10, 13, 17, 19 mm are the big must haves in various styles.  I probably have 5 or 6 of each in deep, 6 and 12 point, different drive sizes.  If you can swing it, having several different 3/8 drive ratchets is really useful.  Some exhaust parts use a 12mm (I guess to help distinguish that they are different, being copper) and a 22mm and 36mm shows up in suspension work.  I know autozone loans the 36mm, but so does my neighbor.  A transmission seal is 30mm.  10 and 13mm are probably the best to get ratcheting wrenches in, though I wish I had a 17mm here and there.    Body panels and trim are mostly 10 and 8mm.  I've been doing a bit of that lately and an 8mm ratchet wrench is really, really, useful.  Specialty stuff is on an as-needed basis, and many auto parts stores will loan the non-bmw specific stuff.  There are also guys out there on the forums and boards that rent out the expensive specialty stuff.  I paid something like 50 bucks for the puller/press tool that does subframe bushings a few months back. It was worth every penny.  I've never had a problem with needing the water pump locking wrench.  I've always just put a thinner crescent on it and smack it with a hammer quick.  The fan clutch will almost always come loose like that, and it doesn't need to be all that tight when you reinstall the fan clutch, given the direction it rotates."
E30,32a0ej,Twaletta,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:07:48 2015 UTC,Big +1 on the deep and 12-point versions of sockets/spanners. Always grateful to have 12 point on-hand when working in tight spots. Deeper sockets are essential for certain tasks (don't ask me which - buy/loan as needed). Agreed on the tool rental/hiring if that's an option. For the crankshaft bolt I hired a mother of a 500ft/lb torque wrench for the weekend. Shop rep said they typically only hire them out to people putting cranes together. Think I paid $40? Did the crank bolt and all 4 wheel nuts. Saved a huge amount of money/time and felt good knowing I had the bolts all tightened to spec.
E30,32a0ej,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"10mm or 14mm (both sizes were used) Allen socket attachment for diff drain/fill. You also want the 5mm as a socket attachment, not just a bent Allen wrench.  Fan wrench could be nice.  Agree that specialty tools can wait until you need them. I'm going to want a crank pulley holder, cam holder, and TDC pin for my timing chain soon."

E30,3280xd,tvrdloch,4,Sat Apr 11 11:53:27 2015 UTC,"Taken from the Wiki:  ""As these cars age, the latch mechanism can get sticky. When this happens, the latch occasionally jams in either the open or closed position. When you try and close the door, the catch on the pillar smacks into the latch, and the door doesn't close or worse, the latch is jammed open and won't click shut.  To solve this, spray the latch with some penetrating lubricant (such as WD40). Then use a screwdriver to prise the latch arm outwards - it can help to pull the door handle at the same time to help free the mechanism. With some wiggling you should be able to free the latch arm so that it springs into the open position, and closes properly when it hits the door catch."""

E30,3280xd,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of good forums out there, each with different attitudes.  R3V caters to a younger crowd that seems a bit more open to experimenting and pushing limits; turbos, body kits and whatnot.  The R3V forums are the one that all the other forums like to hate on, but that's mostly older guys that don't like the kids messing with what they think a BMW should be.    Bimmerforums generally is a bit more purist, good for restoration type projects.  E30Tech has some really good old school knowledge, but good luck getting an email address verified to get an account.  Anyone else remember the roadfly forums back in the day?  They were just all around good ten years back, but it's a ghost town now.  I usually just throw ""e30 <current project/problem>"" into google and usually get a mix of the forums in the results.  Whatever problem you run into, chances are someone has already been there.  My Bentley manual, while wonderful and detailed, has slowly become my last resort after checking the forums."

Also, when it doesn't run, I have other options for transportation. It's definitely a car that needs some regular TLC, unlike a Corolla or Civic which will just run, even on neglect."
E30,326rd1,kpcnsk,3,Sat Apr 11 03:25:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't have workshop experience and a decent toolkit, don't daily an E30. They're excellent daily drivers IF they're well-maintained (which simply means doing the BMW recommended jobs at the appropriate intervals with OEM parts).  But these are 25 year old cars. Something like replacing a brake line, which is supposed to be a quick job, will take a whole week when you find the steel lines are corroded, the hose nut is seized solid and you rounded off the hex face because you didn't have the right wrench.  They're wonderful cars with enough modern conveniences, power and comfort to keep up with modern traffic. But don't buy one if you need to depend on it day in, day out, unless you're prepared to pump in some serious cash to bring it up to standard."
E30,326rd1,Grrrmachine,2,Sat Apr 11 08:24:15 2015 UTC,"Ive been daily driving my current e30 for about 3 years now, and had a few before this one as well. I do just about all my own work.

E30,326rd1,rudbri93,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"If having a shop do the work, find at least a euro specialized shop to do it. Preferably one that has experience with older german cars."

E30,326rd1,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic car to learn on.    It has a lot going for it when it comes to doing your own work.  The first thing it has going for it is the RWD layout, which frees up a lot of room in the engine bay since the transmission is behind the engine, rather than under.  The M20 is a reasonably simple and very durable engine.  If you pull the air box and coolant reservoir out (takes ten minutes) you have lots of room to swing a wrench on most components in there.  Its a pretty basic design by modern standards without a lot of electronic crap to go haywire.  I had a '99 323i for six years and, compared to my e30s, it was a bitch to work on, mostly because of electronic gremlins.  The only downside about them is the age.  You will have things to fix.  I suppose it could also be a plus if you look at it as being forced to learn something new every couple months.  You may not have payments on an e30, but I would factor into your budget about $100-125/month for maintenance/repairs (assuming you do it yourself).  Parts are generally not too bad in cost compared to other cars.  They are definitely cheaper than modern BMWs for the most part."
E30,326rd1,rudbri93,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:21:20 2015 UTC,"I can definitely work $100-150 a month, and I was figuring it would be a decent beginner-enthusiast car because of the mechanical aspect of it versus the electronic aspect. The ones I'd be looking at would probably be around 4500 or so, for possible aftermarket treats (though I am aware of the problems coming from modifications) or just a more reliable vehicle."
E30,326rd1,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:15:14 2015 UTC,"As others point out, also consider if you will be completely reliant on the car.  Parts are not necessarily expensive compared to other cars, but they will almost always take time to get.  Dealers don't keep a lot in stock, and what they do is not going to be easy on the bank.  Dealer prices can easily be 4-5x the cost.  To get decent prices you will be ordering online, with 3-4 days to ship.  The only things I get from the dealer are things that might cost under $50; hoses, gaskets, nuts and bolts.  Things that if they have in stock, I'll pay the premium out of sheer convenience."
E30,326rd1,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"Right right, good point; that was my main concern as a DD. I was kind of figuring that, being german and older, parts/shop-done-maintenance wouldn't come cheap. Now I'm sure I could borrow my parents' car in the meantime, but it would be a pain to be waiting days to drive my own car. That's why I'd see about having the car inspected by a certified/specialized mechanic before considering the purchase. I don't want it to turn into any more of a project than I can handle."
E30,326rd1,drumsripdrummer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:46:53 2015 UTC,Its one of the cars I learned on. Get a Bentleys manual and a good set of tools and you will be fine.
E30,326rd1,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"+1 to learning on an E30. Before rebuilding my engine the only thing I'd worked on was a 2-stroke dirt bike, and that was just basic stuff. The E30 is an absolute treat to work on - nothing complex whatsoever (provided you stay out of the transmission, but even that can be done if you have the time/patience/tools)."
E30,326rd1,drumsripdrummer,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking it'd be like! I feel like I'd enjoy slowly converting it to some modern perks; plus, my dad has always wanted to start a project car with me, so why not kill two birds?"
E30,326rd1,PoacherPoacher,2,Sun Apr 12 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Whether you can DD an e30 is a combination of factors.  If you can't work on it yourself but make decent money, it will be fine.  If, like me, you aren't the richest guy around, but can do the work yourself, it could also work out fine.  It also depend on the car.  My first e30 was a mistake for me.  I paid $1200 for it (back in '04 or '05) but within 6 months had all kinds of things fall apart.  The only thing that saved me financially was a family member selling a better condition e30 for $800.  I turned 2 cars, one bad and one decent, into a single good car.    My current 87 325is cost me $4200 two years back, but it was in fantastic condition and came with a stack of maintenance papers 2 inches thick.  It had been in the previous owners family from 2k on the odometer to around 175k, and dealer/reputable shop maintained the whole time.  If you are an average broke college student, I would only suggest getting one if you can verify its condition and are willing to put the effort into doing the work yourself.  This is coming from a broke post-college guy, so I ain't hating.  After my last car, I seriously considered a new $10k Kia with a nice warranty and $150ish monthly payments, but asked myself, ""Where's the fun in that?""  I just factor in maintenance in place of payments.  Also on that note, insurance costs are pretty good on them."
E30,326rd1,stabsthedrama,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:38:00 2015 UTC,"That's one of my biggest draws as well, insurance. Most of my other car options, while lasting longer, would 1) require monthly payments and 2) most definitely cost more than an e30 would to insure."

E30,320e78,Supradupraserg,4,Thu Apr 9 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"There is zero information on that advert to help you make a decision. There are no bodywork photos (a black car inside a poorly lit garage is not a photo), no mention of any service or repair work, and nothing but an unverified mileage to make a valuation.  What the pictures DO tell you is that this car is completely unloved, with a shagged-out interior and cheap aftermarket wheels probably sporting perished tyres. That's not the sort of owner who does 5000 mile oil changes or who insists that his air filter is OEM, so make of that what you will.  If you're prepared to pay $3000 for it, make sure you have $1000 left over for immediate repairs; you will need every penny of it."

E30,320e78,Narek_S,2,Thu Apr 9 20:17:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pay that much. The exterior's pretty clean but it has the metal bumpers :/ and the interior's horrible.

E30,320e78,Narek_S,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"I mean it's not bad but you'll still need a transmission and the mileage is kind of high. I wouldn't buy it personally as I just don't like the bumpers and the interior's not that great, but you can't really have high expectations for it since it's only a grand."

I just put mine on that came with the car and they stick out about a foot from the clamp.  edit: the racks are really good at head hunting so I've been thinking about cutting them down Maybe I should include a picture for laughs when I get home   Really digging those wheels too. Perfect fitment

E30,31yqq8,fadelakin,3,Thu Apr 9 04:59:09 2015 UTC,I think the fact that the e30 m3 has skyrocketed in value has definitely pulled 325i's and 318i's up in price. If you're planning on getting one for $1800 you should be happy because it has a chance of being worth more than that down the line. As far as what to look for besides rust; I'd look into making sure the timing belt gets changed at proper intervals since the 325i has an interference engine. These cars are pretty bulletproof overall though.
E30,31yqq8,PuroBugatti,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"Between now and the end the month, I wouldn't worry too much, but in the long run, yes.  I've been watching E30's since high school and in that time the prices really haven't increased too much. Especially for the lower trims like the E models or Sedan models. Usually I E30's in the 1000-4500 range, with the latter being a cleanish 325i and the former being a sedan 318e. I got my 318is for about 2000.  My biggest regret will always be not buying an m3 for 6 grand a few years ago. It was for sale for a while, and I haven't seen a real e30 m3 for sale in my area since."
E30,31yqq8,Shigidy,0,Thu Apr 9 14:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. These are now of age that they don't really have a blue book value any longer and solely go by market value. Depending on where you are, they can go for a good sum. Since they are now classics by age and by cult following, they should only go up. They've gone up in price since I bought mine in 2007. The same car would've cost me another ~$2500 on top of what I paid now.   Watch out for ""minor rust"". This shit is hidden well. I thought my car only had a couple spots since it's been well cared for and never saw salt on roads, etc. I've replaced a bunch of metal in mine. I'll have a build thread update soon that shows some of it.   Talk the guy down to at least $1500 if possible (have cash in hand) and use the rest of it to make her road worthy. The usual stuff like timing belt, preventative maintenance, etc. I'd suggest replacing your rubber suspension components with oem or poly. I went oem rubber because I'm driving long distances and want a smooth comfortable ride."

I used to think it was something wrong but I repaired everything it could be and it still made that noise.   As for the whining sound, do you happen to have an aftermarket stereo? Is it there when the radio is off?"
E30,31xal0,beefcakez,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yes there is an after market stereo, and i noticed that at times when i accelerate, and the stereo is turned on but not playing, it makes a louder hissing the more i accelerate. I will try to get a sound clip."

E30,31ugp5,spacecore13,3,Wed Apr 8 06:18:56 2015 UTC,"Sucks to see another one of these cars go.  I've had one go that way, though not quite as dramatic as yours.  A 17 yr old kid was accelerating to get out of a backed up exit for a 4th of July fireworks show and (in his words) ""forgot to turn the wheel"".  Rear ended me at about 30 mph and killed my '87 325is.  Nine years, two e30s, and one e46 later, and I'm still a little grouchy about it.  Was my all time favorite car, that one.  Are you planning to get into another?"
E30,31ugp5,Twaletta,3,Wed Apr 8 06:49:42 2015 UTC,I would love to get another one but I need to see how much the insurance company is going to give me the worst part about this is that it was the first car I paid for myself now I don't have a car. But could be worse.
E30,31ugp5,Twaletta,2,Wed Apr 8 07:01:49 2015 UTC,"That sucks, man.  At least you're okay.  When mine got totaled the insurance gave me about $3400 (9 yrs back).  It blue-booked (by my evaluation of its condition) at about $4700, not including the $3k I put into it over a year getting it up to spec.  My neck was a little sore, and I mildly sprained/jammed both my ankles.  I saw him coming in the rearview and instinctively stomped the brake and clutch with locked knees.  The force bent my ankles a bit more than they are designed for.  Walking hurt for a few days and they gave me another $1250.  I am absolutely not saying to make up an injury, but if you are a little sore you might just mention it to the adjuster.  I just hinted that I was kinda sore and I might want something for it, and they very quickly offered $1250.  I guess they figure that were I more unscrupulous I could sue for quite a bit more.  I wouldn't have, but since it evened it out to what I thought it was worth, I took it without arguing.  Here she is.  I still miss her. http://imgur.com/aXoip7I"

Did you use z3 inner and outer tie rods? or did you use e30 or e36? Looks like the z3's that came with it are trashed so I'm trying to figure out which ones I want to use. My old ones off the e30 rack are still good."
E30,31na57,karmat0se,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:10:01 2015 UTC,"I used E36 inner/outer tie rods because they're a bit beefier. That said, I'm going to look at adapting a Mini (non S) rotor instead of the Corrado rotors I'm presently using so I might switch back to E30 tie rods because they'll allow a bit more room for rotor (if it even fits.... it might be tight).   Also, don't freak out when you discover there's no tie rod locking plates on the Z3 rack. There isn't even a part number for them. I just used a bit of blue locktite and called it a day. Two years and many track days later I've had no issue."
E30,31na57,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"Good to know, man. Thanks for the advice. I think I'll just put the e30 tie rods on since I'm wayyyyyyy over my budget anyway ;)   Are you running Mazda calipers? or something else?"
E30,31na57,karmat0se,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"Budget? What's that? I gave up on trying to keep under one of those ages ago. So much sunk cost. Either tie rod will work and if your E30 ones are in good shape, totally reuse them.   I'm using Wilwood Dynapro calipers. I was looking at the Mazda setup and after pricing out good rebuilt calipers around here it worked out cheaper going with the Wilwood setup. Getting brake pads is a bit of a pain in the ass though. Another reason I went with this option was to avoid fitment  issues. I've got a lot invested in 15"" wheels."
E30,31na57,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"Lol. Yeah, budget's gone. My wife says ""get it if it'll make the bimmer safe to drive"" which I hear as ""buy all the things!""  Those calipers are nice! I scored a great deal on mazda calipers and work with machinists who can make the adapters (and any sort of bushing/spacer will ever need) for me, so I couldn't pass them up.   We'll see about my wheels. I planned on going with some 16"" or 17"" in the future. If these brakes don't fit, I'll have to expedite my purchase."

I don't have one on my E30 currently, but I've had both on all other cars I've owned since 1992. I'm more of a Yak fan, because that's what I bought first and I like their bike racks better. I owned a Thule for my Jetta and hated the bike mount as it was always fussy. Anyway, I'd recommend that you look at the attachments necessary for what you plan to carry, and buy into a rack system to match."

I started messing around with the throttle body and cleaned the ICV and that didn't do anything either, but tightening the the throttle cable did fix it for a little while (a minute or so). I started fearing for the worst and thought my timing was off but you know what it was? The fuel filter... the stupid fuel filter was clogged.

I paid $3k for the car, but had easily put another $3.5k into it.  That was like 7 years back, though.  If it wasn't your fault you have a little extra leverage with the insurance company, but you will need to fight tooth and nail."
E30,31ftju,ggill1313,4,Sat Apr 4 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Couldn't tell you where to get one but I do not envy you for having to replace it. It's not difficult but doing all those bolts takes forever.  The method you probably saw is to lift the engine from the bottom just enough to get the pan out. I can confirm that works, I used it when I replaced my gasket. Loosen the nuts on the motor mounts so that they will lift up but not come out. Jack up the engine at the A/C bracket (or was it power steering? Definitely double check that one) and there will be enough room to get the pan out. The other trouble spot for me was the oil pump shaft thingy in place with the pan in position to be reassembled."
E30,31ftju,performedbeef,2,Sat Apr 4 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, awesome! My father was concerned about the ""doability"" of it all without a lift, but frankly, I just don't have the money to pay someone to do something like that for me, when people have done it on their own.   How much did you loosen the engine mounts? How far did you jack it up?"
E30,31ftju,performedbeef,3,Sat Apr 4 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"In the end it really only goes up like 1.5, maybe 2 inches. It's more than it sounds though, I remember I had to go back a couple times to loosen the nuts up a little more."
E30,31ftju,performedbeef,2,Sat Apr 4 19:43:10 2015 UTC,Cool. I am just worried about the engine falling on me. I don't want to accidentally loosen it too much and be unaware of it. Is this a real worry that I should have or am I overthinking it?
E30,31ftju,Twaletta,2,Sat Apr 4 19:58:35 2015 UTC,As long as you don't take the nuts all the way off the motor mounts - just loosen them - it can only fall right back into place on the mounts. Definitely use stands and be sure the jack is seated well under the bracket.
E30,31ftju,Twaletta,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about the engine falling.  If you just loosen the engine mounts you still have the weight of the transmission at the other end to sort of balance it out a little.  With the mounts off you can lift the engine up and down by hand so it's pretty tough to get crushed.  Use a decent set of ramps to lift the front, they are a little safer than jack-stands.  The only injury I received while changing an oil pan was a wasp sting on my ankle while I was lying underneath, which also led to a cut on my forehead when I jumped from the sting and smacked it on the steering rack."
E30,31ftju,Twaletta,2,Sat Apr 4 20:17:18 2015 UTC,"Some people might disagree with me, but I think an oil pan is one of the few things where buying the cheapest, generic, non-OEM part is perfectly acceptable.  My rationale is simple:  a genuine OEM pan is going to crack almost as easily as a generic ebay one.    Depending on the damage, you can TRY to patch it by cleaning it really well and using JB-weld, but it's far from a permanent solution.  It will leak, but you might get a month (+/-) out of it.  My first e30 was lowered to a ridiculous amount (with cut springs) and I tried patching it 4 times over 6 months.  When I finally decided to swap the pan I picked up a used set of stock springs for cheap and new shocks and raised it back up to avoid the problem altogether.  I can also confirm that an oil pan, aside from being messy, is not hard to do.  I got pretty good at taking them on and off in an hour or two with a set of ramps.  Ten years later and I'm on my fourth e30 (all 87's coincidentally) and am in the process of installing GC coilovers, so I'm sure I'm gonna be doing an oil pan at some point in the relative future."
E30,31ftju,Dr_octopus,2,Sat Apr 4 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am looking fora  cheap one. Know of anywhere to get one?"
E30,31ftju,karmat0se,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:57:10 2015 UTC,"Best I'm seeing right now are a couple used (assuming you have the 6 cyl m20) on eBay for ~$160.  Just search ebay for ""e30 oil pan"".  Make sure you don't get the one for the 4 cyl m14.  You could maybe find one at a junk yard, but that's hit or miss and also a lot more effort.  I wouldn't hold my breath.    And make sure you get a new gasket for the pan.  I'd check ""autohausaz.com"" or ""fcpeuro.com"" for it.  Sometimes ""pelicanparts.com"" will be cheapest.  Make sure you factor shipping into it, the cheapest part price might not be the best overall with shipping.  There's also ""bavauto.com"", but I'm not too fond of them.  I think I paid about $130 for one, but that was also 7 or 8 years back.  When I would do them (and it's been a minute) I think I just removed the bottom nuts on the engine mounts completely, leaving the top still bolted on, letting me lift the motor some but some people say not to."
E30,31ftju,beefcakez,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:05:58 2015 UTC,"I couldn't give any advice as to how you'd change the oil pan, but I have heard that you can directly swap out the e30's aluminum oil pan for the e34's steel pan which would just dent instead of shattering"

If the car's a keeper, it's a good idea to buy a scrap pair of arms on ebay, and have the new joints fitted to those - then you keep your current ones as spares, to have new joints pressed in a few years down the road. That keeps the car's off-road time, as well as your parts expenditure, to a minimum."

Beyond service records, I'd expect receipts for significant component teardowns, including a rebuilt diff and knowing that all suspension components including every single bush have been replaced with OEM quality parts.

If you're thinking investment that leads me to believe you want to sell it years down the road. Consider the cost of keeping the car mint over the years of appreciation. It can't just sit.  Honestly, unless you have boatloads of cash floating around this car has already appreciated past the point where it's a good idea to buy.  If you could've grabbed one in the late 90s or early 2000s it would've made a lot of sense to get it. Now I'd be looking at E46 M3s for cars that will be due to appreciate in the future.  This is just one man's opinion though. There's always going to be some guy out there with more money than sense that would probably snatch it up if you're in the right place at the right time.   I'd generally advise against purchasing cars as an investment though, because in almost every case, they're a bad and very risky investment. Say for example you have this M3 and you're driving it around on a Sunday and some asshole plows into you. Boom investment is gone. That car is now essentially only worth whatever the insurance company is going to try to shake you down for and I guarantee they'll hit you hard on that mileage number, even with a rebuild.  If you want an E30 with speed, I'd recommend going the S52 route and getting a good suspension setup. It's cheaper and arguably more fun to drive.  Best of luck with whatever you decide. If you do it buy it, let us know and take pics. :)"

A decent 5-lug swap that retains the current suspension geometry and bearing loading will cost you $$$.

Depending on the condition of the vehicle and the mechanical skill of the buyer, you should have $1K to $5K on hand to just bring things up to working order once you own it. I've seen so many classic cars of all kinds get snatched up at a bargain, with the buyer discovering 3-6 months later that they don't have enough cash to do a fraction of what the car needs to get it running safe and well. So it becomes an abandoned project, often parted out because it's no longer running. That's sad, and avoidable."

But it's hard to say since most people here have probably only experienced ""manual"" racks as in power steering racks that have had the pumps deleted/bypassed. It's all about preference though. You should see if you can find anyone who will let you drive an e30 with p/s, you may end up preferring the manual rack."
E30,306et2,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"In theory, a manual rack offers better feeling than a power steering rack.  In practice, fitting a power steering rack from an E46 offers far superior steering than any of the standard options."

E30,306et2,karmat0se,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:01:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really like power steering or the stock power steering rack in the E30. If you're going to go to the trouble of swapping in a steering rack, do yourself a favour and at least get an e46 rack. It'll make the car much more nimble feeling.  Me personally, I dumped power steering after my rack started leaking and I started liking the feedback I got after I disconnected the ps pump. I then swapped to a Z3 1.9L rack and the difference is incredible."
E30,306et2,lando9000,2,Wed Mar 25 19:24:20 2015 UTC,Have you deleted the power steering on the Z3 rack? (2.7 ratio?). How is it? I always thought it'd be incredibly heavy in comparison to the 4.4 in my manual car.
E30,306et2,karmat0se,3,Sat Mar 28 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have. Used the Condor Speed Shop delete block. Works great.  It's a bit heavy at very slow speeds, but otherwise it's really no different than the stock rack with no power steering as far as weight goes. Otherwise, it's hella agile. Great upgrade."
E30,306et2,joshamania,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:26:15 2015 UTC,A comment and a question:  My PS has a leak so when I bought mine I dumped a coupla bottles of fluid in and it worked for a few minutes.  I have to say it was kinda nice...but I also like the feel I get when it's empty and have left it that way.  Question:  PS delete?  Should I cut the belt?  It's been this way since previous owner so I don't know if there's any more damage to be done by leaving it alone.  It's not caused me any problems in the 18 months I've owned the car.
E30,306et2,karmat0se,3,Wed Mar 25 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"Sure, cut the belt. No point in ruining the pump if it is in fact still working. You can delete the entire system with a delete block. Garagetastic, Condor Speed Shop and a few other places sell a delete block."

E30,2zywsw,SgtMajorZero,2,Mon Mar 23 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"Looks like she's in good condition. As others have said, rust is your biggest concern. Everything else mechanical can be swapped/rebuilt/replaced. Cutting out sections of sheet metal, shaping and welding is a royal p.i.t.a (and I only had to do a smallish section of the driver-side foot well - no painting required). If you're going to get someone else to do the chopping and spraying, factor that into how much cash you're prepared to part with. Reconditioned brake calipers can be had from turnermotorsport. Alternatively you can do the caliper rebuild and replace the seals (for which you'll want an air compressor - makes it much easier...)  http://www.turnermotorsport.com/BMW-E30/c-82-bmw-brake-calipers.aspx  http://www.e30tech.com/forum/showthread.php?t=39965"

E30,2zwgf4,Armonster20,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"You're right, tires do affect the fitment. And that's usually why people test fit at first with just the bare wheel itself, to see what size tire they can get away with. There's also other issues to consider, such as the clearance of the inner wheel touching the strut or gas tank filler in the rear. And also you're right about the suspension, usually when people test fit they will try to make the suspension fully compressed with the wheel on so they can see how it'll all fit when you hit a large bump or take a turn hard. So you were definitely on the right track with all of those things."

E30,2zmwbn,SelfMastered,3,Thu Mar 19 22:25:51 2015 UTC,Your AC is leaking green love and is most likely shot. Kill it.   The oil leak might be the cam seal or the valve cover. It's not that bad of a leak.
E30,2zmwbn,protomor,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Ya i know about the AC. When i checked my oil level, it seems like it is over filled. (there are 2 indents in the dip stick, and it's above the second one)"
E30,2zmwbn,Deltigre,2,Fri Mar 20 00:19:14 2015 UTC,"That could almost literally be anything. The answer to how bad it is is: how is your oil level when you pull the dipstick? If it's within tolerance, just top it off if it's getting low.  Then, clean up the area and try to check regularly before it gets everywhere. You'll have a better sense of what's leaking.  Mine was the oil filter housing o-ring, but it covered the timing case, power steering pump, and front main crank seal areas."

E30,2za3zh,Gregarious_Raconteur,2,Mon Mar 16 21:52:20 2015 UTC,I've had my '86 325 for maybe 6 months now and have spent 250ish dollars on replacement parts alone. It all depends on who the previous owner is and how well they maintained it. I know a guy who's spent 800+ on repairing his e30 that fried his ECU and engine harness plus other stuff. So I think its about how dedicated you want to be to the car. They run smooth as a whistle if everything is well kept.
E30,2za3zh,Hannnnn_Solo,2,Tue Mar 17 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"once everything is in good condition, it should cost you like a couple hundred dollars a year."
E30,2za3zh,SelfMastered,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"Regardless of purchase price, set aside at least $500 to do some immediate repairs. This will deal with the regular wear items of rear subframe bushes, front control arms, and a leaky gasket somewhere. You also need to know the age of the timing belt and water pump, and if that's unknown or three years old, swap them too.  After that, they become very reliable. Just keep them serviced regularly (fluids and filters, sparks and belts) and they'll plough on for years."
E30,2za3zh,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:10:15 2015 UTC,Mine isn't very expensive. I do have to replace the occasional part here and there but I find when I do it isn't much more expensive than parts for other cars I've owned.
E30,2za3zh,Shigidy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"I've owned mine for about 3 months now and have probably put around $400 but that's just; rear seat, bumpers, front panel, and a few other little things.

E30,2za3zh,tokeonthis,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"I bought an e30 two months ago. Drove great for a month, but the fuse blew for the window circuit breaker, and on my last drive, the clutch pedal lost all pressure and my gear shifter is now loose from trying to get it in gear without the clutch. Spent just a bit over $1k usd for new clutch cylinders, gear shifter bits (z3 shift lever upgrade), ignition rotor and coil, spark plugs, distributor?, timing belt kit and accessory belts (no waterpump), fuel filter, antifreeze and engine/tranny oil), crankshaft position sensor, thermostat... Probably forgetting a few bits too. At this point I'm trying to play it safe. Who knows when a tie rod will break, or your steering rack fails. These are old cars and as well engineered as they are reputed, over time, parts will become frail and break. These posts you see saying have an additional 2-3k to spend on parts after you buy the car are true."
E30,2za3zh,rb2369,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:01:25 2015 UTC,It's kind of a difficult question to answer really it depends on parts availability in your area. Oem parts are available for sure but shipping costs can add up quickly. For some items like a transmission you will have to source a used one since the getrag 260 is expensive to rebuild and I've been told they are hard to find the parts to rebuild. It also varies on how your car was treated if it was well maintained it should be a fairly reliable car but just because it's not lowered and multi coloured like the civics doesn't mean it hasn't been driven hard. Rwd is always tempting to have some fun with. All that being said a well cared for e30 is a great car I would recommend going to r3vlimited.com and browsing the forums for more info it's the best forum for e30s

E30,2z9oro,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:29:45 2015 UTC,No leaking fluids related to the power steering that i've noticed.

The MOMO hub is the other good option if you don't want to go the slim/quick release route.  Most hubs use a 6-fastener pattern. This is the standard MOMO pattern. Grant uses a 5-fastener pattern and require a special hub. NRG makes one for the e30 but that's all i've found."
E30,2z7ta1,karmat0se,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:06:36 2015 UTC,"So the hub, whether I go quick release or not, has to be specific to the E30?"
E30,2z7ta1,karmat0se,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"Correct. The hub has to have the correct number of splines and the right pitch to fit. The E28, E30 and non airbag E34 use the same spline."

Then just match up the old style connectors to the new style via a wiring diagram and it'll work just fine. It'd also give you a lot more options for factory radios as that big plug was used for most of the 90's.  Me personally, I'd just go get a nice Kenwood (or your manufacturer of choice) head unit and call it a day. I have a Kenwood KDC-BT848u in my E30 and have a KDC-BT855u to go in my E34. They don't stand out and look like they belong. You can also set them to Orange backlight that looks almost identical to the cluster backlighting.

Same advice would apply though - new oil pressure switch (I know at least on my 4.0 it was like a $10 part), and while you're at it clean out the oil pressure switch hole with a small caliber handgun wire brush a bit, and also get an oil pressure gauge kit at HF for $25 and put it on.    Drive it til hot, shut it down, put the mech gauge on, and let it idle for awhile again.  See what pressure is at idle and high rpm's - google or use FSM to check against spec numbers.    Not 100% all of that is relevant to e30 engines, but at least the mech gauge part is."

Rinse the rag in a bucket of water. Repeat in a new section. If you want to get more of the residue out, you can rinse it with a hose and clean water.

E30,2yrls3,toerrisbadsyntax,5,Thu Mar 12 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if this is the only car you have, or you'll be working or learning on, then you'll get by okay with a standard 3/8ths metric set from 8mm up to about 22 or 24mm (very few bolts or nuts will be larger than this.....)  Grab a similar set of wrenches, a stubby racheting box end set will pay off good too....  you'll probably need a basic set of what I call ""Grip tools""... vice grips, NN vicegrips, NN Pliers, channel locks, a good pair of wire snips, any really anything else that can be gripped by hand.  As a footnote - quality will show with the price of the tools you buy here.  Tooth profile and jaw design mean a lot, you'll find this out on the next major set of tools you'll buy (this also goes for sockets and wrenches too)  your first set of screwdrivers (or whatever you can rummage together) will be fine, don't need anything special. but eventually you may need much stronger metal in the shank of the driver to get out rusted bolts.  Brake rotor set screws can be a bitch - when you get to this point in fixing your car, consider looking for an impact driver and bits... you'll thank me later.  learn how to solder properly, don't make cold solder joints, get a soldering GUN.... not an iron....   Gunna do your own brakes I suppose? Don't fuck around with brakes... keep yourself and other motorists safe.... get the proper tools... /u/Vythix is right, get channel locks to retract the piston in the rear calipers, Line wrenches grab more and turn brake fittings better than a standard wrench, even cheap ones work pretty well and save you from stripping old rusted fittings.... It wouldn't hurt to make a pressure bleeder, maybe if you do the work yourself, invest in some speed-bleeder nipples (4-8 bucks a piece... turns a 2 man job into a 1 man job)  after you do a few thousand brakepads, get a micrometer and learn to check disc runout, (this comes at about the same time as the impact driver set)  by this time, you'll have just about everything..... but... if you're going to be doing LOADS of work on this car... and you want to lower it.  Buy a nice low profile - high rise jack RIGHT NOW.  The sooner you have one, and the higher you can get a lowered vehicle for service, the better off you'll be while working.

Of course crimp connections will break if they're not done properly.  You may be thinking of ""cold welds"", which is what you get when you properly crimp a connection, and that is exactly what you want.  There is a reason manufacturers don't use solder.

E30,2yrls3,joshamania,2,Thu Mar 12 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"You can buy a full set, but ideally you need:   8, 10, 11, 13, 17mm and 19mm sockets and spanners (wrenches for you) 8, 10 and 13mm ratchet spanners 19 and 24mm sockets A decent breaker bar (mine's 75cm) A decent set of screwdrivers   With that little lot you should be able to reduce an E30 into pretty much its complete component set, barring a few odd one-use tools."
E30,2yrls3,Grrrmachine,2,Thu Mar 12 19:48:56 2015 UTC,I have a craftsman kit from before they started making them in China and it is the best quality set of tools I have worked with. I think they still have a lifetime warranty if I'm not mistaken.   Buy deep sockets and a torque wrench harbor freight.  I would suggest buying everything with a 1/2in driver because a lot of the bigger tools use it. Along the line I'd recommend getting a 25 gallon compressor and an Ingersoll Rand pneumatic impact wrench with sockets from harbor freight.   Buy a decent jack and beefy ass jack stands.  I'd also get like a 1-1.5ft pipe that can fit around your ratchet for those stubborn bolts. It's also good to have a can of PB Blaster around.
E30,2yrls3,bigdaddyEm,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:52:49 2015 UTC,"Craftsman would be nice, but  yeah, they're no longer made in the U.S.   However, they are still a lifetime warranty (on hand tools), so you could break something and get a replacement for it easy. I have a bunch of Craftsman and they're great, but I got mine years ago.   Husky is a great brand with a lifetime warranty which you can get at Home Depot. I forget the store brand at Lowes, but it's good too.   However, I'd just recommend going to Harbor Freight tools and getting tools from there. Lifetime warranty on hand tools so you can beat the ever loving sh*t out of it and get a new one. Plus, they're dirt cheap so if it does break, whatever. You won't worry. I've yet to break a single one of mine yet, and I hit them with hammers all the time.   I wouldn't get a full mechanics tool set. You won't need a lot of those tools. Buy smaller sets of what you need as they come. A simple metric socket set (deep sockets and short) and some metric wrenches will do almost everything on an e30. Also, a screwdriver set, of course.   I would invest in a nice toolbox, though. I have 5+ large portable toolboxes with my tools in them now. I would love to have one with drawers so I don't have to dig around. That sucks."

Rubber will need replaced. Ball joints go bad. The usual. I've spent ~$6k in parts alone so far (initial car cost was $3k) for my restomod.

It has no airbags, so it's relatively less safe than other newer, more common vehicles on the road.   As for cost efficiency... that's a whole other matter in itself.  Yes, it's probably going to have a cheaper operating cost (Monthly insurance will be cheap) but when things do go wrong (and they will) it's a slippery slope with obtaining older parts from or for a specific vehicle.  Especially when you live in a rural area with a dwindling selection of European vehicles and spares to pick from at the wreckers - this is assuming you do ALL your own work!  I wouldn't say this to discourage anyone like /u/longbowjake from getting an E30, but they should be prepared for old-car ownership.  Especially if it's going to be their first car."

Run the VIN and make sure it is what the seller says it is.   Buying or passing on this car depends on what you want it for. It looks like it's in good condition, and if the seller has a good maintenance history, then the mileage doesn't really matter.

E30,2ypnmb,unknownop,3,Wed Mar 11 20:14:53 2015 UTC,It depends: a lot of enthusiasts don't like the 325e as it's somewhat slow and an automatic would just make it slower. These cars are so much more fun with a stick.  If it's a truly clean shell then maybe. I'd personally pass and try to get an 325i/is (or ix. Sorry 4 cylinder guys just preference of an engine design of the century contender (BMW I6 as a whole)) with a manual that is clean.  On the other hand if you wanted an automatic that is a great commuter car with the efficient engine. It'd get good mileage and not cost much in the long run.
E30,2ypnmb,tokeonthis,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"I want a manual, but the rust free portion was what lured me in. There are some ix on the market too, but they are around 4-5k."

On the flip side, it looks to have an incredibly clean body, been well maintained and owned by a genuine appreciater.  So it won't give you the phenomenal noise and tail-happy kick that six-cylinder E30s are famous for, but it is a well preserved example of 80s German engineering. What's more, you wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt about ripping the motor out and fitting something with much more grunt (M50/S54), since the shell is absolutely gagging for more power under the hood."

E30,2yiv9r,rb2369,3,Tue Mar 10 04:08:28 2015 UTC,"1) You replace the shifter linkage from under the car. As you can see in this tutorial, the shifter rod connects to the gearbox with a knuckle bush (third picture, top right corner). As soon as you undo that, the gearstick will become floppy and loose so it doesn't matter what gear you were in - the alignment of the new knuckle and the shifter rod will force your new gearstick into the correct position.  2) The hood is adjusted by loosening the clearly-visible bolts that attach it to the hinge. It's a good idea to remove your headlights first, then drop the hood down and adjust it in the lowered position. Use cardboard strips as packing material to push it away from edge fender, so that it doesn't chip the paintwork as you re-align it."
E30,2yiv9r,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:37:42 2015 UTC,Do you have a tutorial for a early model shifter carrier by any chance?

E30,2yiv9r,SgtMajorZero,2,Wed Mar 11 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"Ahh, the bitch clip (2nd picture). How I hate thee. As Grrrrrrmachine has already said, you need to get under the car. First remove the exhaust, heat shield and drive shaft. This will expose the underside of the shifter and selector rod. Also helps if you yank the shifter boot up from the inside to see what's going on. Actually, you'll need to remove the shift knob (try not to hit yourself in the face) and shift boot.  It doesn't matter what gear the car is when you do the swap, or if you have to change gears to give yourself enough wiggle room during install of the short shifter. It'll only go back together one way.   I would suggest also buying a rebuild kit and replacing all of the other parts that make up the shifter + linkage (confirm compatibility):  http://www.ecstuning.com/BMW-E30-325i-M20_2.5L/Drivetrain/Shifter/2  If you need to remove the bitch clip to replace bushings/washers in the front end of the linkage I suggest making a visit to your local superstore's cutlery/bbq aisle. You want some reasonably thick metal meat skewers that you can bend into a long hook shape, with a slight twist/offset. You feed the pointy end up over the top of the transmission and rotate it while also pulling - with a bit of luck and swearing the bitch clip will pop up and you get to do the ""I beat the bitch clip"" dance. Also helps if you undo the transmission support brace and lower the tranny down an inch or so (while supporting it on a jack).   As always, be careful/paranoid when working under your 1.3 tonne car. Stay safe."

That's kind of absurd"
E30,2yiqbx,kmoran1,2,Tue Mar 10 17:48:08 2015 UTC,Can you do it yourself is big question here.
E30,2yiqbx,paperboy91,2,Tue Mar 10 03:53:14 2015 UTC,3.5k sounds like a lot. 1.5k for parts is reasonable but that's a lot of labour. Even if you're not comfortable doing it yourself I'd check with local forums and see if someone can help you out. Even if you pay them it would be a lot less than that shop.
E30,2yiqbx,Bipin93,2,Tue Mar 10 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Nothing is more fun than a manual, but that's a pricey swap.  Find a mechanically savvy friend to help with the labor.

If you are strapped for cash, and looking for a quicker/easier solution, I've got an auto trans in Philly- 300$ picked up, I will load it for you (we have a loading dock).

E30,2yiqbx,Grrrmachine,4,Wed Mar 11 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"The question is: are you prepared to do what it takes to keep a 25-year-old car on the road?  Old machines need love and attention; they need regular maintenance and the occasional repair to keep things moving. With an increasingly dwindling number of mechanics who know how to work on these cars, it's really up to you to get your hands dirty and do some of the work yourself.  By all means, if you have the cash you can pay other people to do this work, but money alone isn't the argument. You're proposing to replace this car with another E30 of the same age - another old car which is just as likely to need serious mechanical work in the very near future. You will have no guarantee that the gearbox will last in that one either. In this case, it's better the devil you know.  So your practical choices are either sell it on and buy something newer and more reliable, or suck it up and pay the $3.5k, or preferably, source the parts and spend a chunk of cash on tools, and learn how to do these jobs yourself. There are plenty of guides out there to help you, and with a buddy and dry skies you should get it done in a weekend."

My center support is bad, maybe that's it? But it's very loud from about 20-30mph and stops around 50 and is very low pitched at 5-10mph if that helps"
E30,2yio6u,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"I just recent did hub swaps   Can you explain this? You replaced the bearing and the hub, or you replaced the entire front strut assembly, or what?  I would strongly suspect a wheel bearing, especially if you've recently done work in that area.   Another option is that you've changed wheels and the wheel bolts are now penetrating the hub to a different depth and are catching on something (particularly common on rear wheels), or that the brake dust shield has become bent and is rubbing on the brake disc. If it's coming from the rear, a broken brake shoe retaining pin will cause the brake shoe to rub inside the drum.  To confirm, jack each wheel up in turn and give it a really sturdy yank in four directions. If there's wobble, it's probably a bearing. If not, spin the wheel by hand and feel for notchiness or stiff points."

E30,2ygpwj,olek2012,4,Mon Mar 9 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"It's all about preference.   The reason the 318 is 'more fun' is because you can really rag on the engine and feel like a race car driver in the upper RPMs while not really going all that fast. It's 'easier' to drive for a novice. The little bit of weight reduction up front helps with the handling characteristics.   The 2.5 straight six can be very tail happy coming out of corners with little effort. This scares most new drivers, hell, even experienced ones when they aren't expecting it.   The semi-trialing rear suspension on these cars make snap oversteer a very real thing to live with, regardless of engine lol.   But that's the point! RWD! hahahaha"
E30,2ygpwj,username2110,2,Mon Mar 9 18:15:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I usually drive FWD cars or my Jeep. Is it hard to transition to and learn the dynamics of a sporty RWD? I drove my buddy's E36 a few times and it didn't seem too challenging
E30,2ygpwj,ggill1313,3,Mon Mar 9 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"Hard to learn? Nah. Different? Yeah.  In most situations, you'll be fine. But as /u/username2110 said, the end will snap out a lot more quickly than a FWD car. It is effortless to get the thing sideways, which is can be a lot of fun. There are tons of back roads near my house that are fun to drive at 35-40 mph just because of how little is required to get the thing a little diagonal. You might not be going nearly as fast as a race car driver, but you certainly feel like you are.   It's something that's hard to explain someone who hasn't ever driven one before, but it's actually amazing at how fun yet simple the car is.   Unfortunately, you do need to be cautious because of the dynamics of the car. A little too much gas around a corner can be a misstep, especially in the wet. But it's a double-edged sword, because that's the same dynamic that makes it a blast to drive.   You'll pick up on what the car can and can't do after playing with it a little (responsibly, of course)."
E30,2ygpwj,beefcakez,2,Mon Mar 9 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"Not hard to transition, really.   I test drove an e36 once (325is) and thought it was crap compared to my e30 (which was basically stock). Made me love my e30 even more. The m50 may have more hp, but it felt sluggish and didn't have the same 'tightness' my m20 had. Dunno. I'm hoping it was just that car.   Anyway, the e30 is a choppy little thing and has lots of room for inexpensive upgrades (well, if you go used parts, that is) which will improve handling and steering response.   The stock m20 will spin the tires in 3rd gear which is awesome :)"

E30,2ygpwj,deViatel,2,Mon Mar 9 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"E36 has a different rear suspension setup that allows vertical movement with minimal change to camber geometry, which means more tire surface area contact with pavement throughout suspension travel.  The semi trailing arms on the E30 cause the camber geometry to change with vertical movement, resulting in the tire's contact area constantly being changed.  This is why they can be tricky at first."
E30,2ygpwj,deViatel,3,Mon Mar 9 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for an e30 myself, from looking in my area (which is very sparse from what it seems) I've seen them anywhere from 2k (with a lot of km and rust) to 10k (for modded and little-norust). you will more than likely need to save up more.

E30,2ygpwj,tokeonthis,8,Mon Mar 9 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"Alright let's break it down from lowest cost to highest cost.  Diving Board Bumper up to 1987  318i - M10 engine (I would avoid)  325e - Economy M20 with good torque and better economy, lower power. (Can be found for very reasonable prices)  325es - Could be priced above a 325i, but still the same as above with all the sport trim, so the nicer seats, front lip, etc.  325i - M20, good power and pretty affordable if you can live with the ugly bumpers.  325is - M20, best one to go for prior to 88 as it gives you LSD, good trim package and the power you want.  1988-1991 Plastic Bumper Era AKA the one you want  318i - M42 engine, typically a sedan and typically not sought after. It can be had in your price range.  318is - Available only in 1991 and considered the poor mans M3, Arguably the most balanced of the non-M3 E30s. Can come with LSD which  makes it a dream. Has the M42 engine, which on the plus is economical and has high revs which make it feel faster than it is, also a lower maintenance timing chain vs the M20 timing belt which needs to be watched closely. (probably not going to find a good one in your price range unless you're very lucky, I haven't seen a decent one go for under 4K)  325i - Pretty much the same as the above 325i except with the facelift. Absolute good buy if you can find a rust free example.  325is - This the one you want. All the bells and whistles and speed too. Except that I've never seen one that wasn't a complete pile cost 3000 and even then you'll be putting several thousand more to get it running right, unless some grandpa makes you a lucky man and sells it way cheap.  There is also the allwheel drive 325ix and the droptop versions.  I'd say for the price you're looking at you might find a good 325e or 325i diving board. You could also get a facelift 318i for that money and not have a bad car, but  it won't be worth much long term."
E30,2ygpwj,following_eyes,3,Mon Mar 9 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"That's a great breakdown, but the thing about aesthetics is that if you're anything like me, you're probably going to end up swapping so much that the only thing E30 that remains is the shell."

I'll add that as far as I can remember, the big difference between the coupé and sedan is the number of doors, and maybe some weight.  Convertibles are the heaviest and not as stiff of a chassis (although I doubt that will ever make any serious difference unless you're driving the car to the limit.).  I'd try to find a 318i/is with the m42 engine, or a later year 325i/is.  The e's and es's are popular for turbocharging reasons, but it doesn't sound like that's in the near future for you."

I wouldn't even attempt it unless you are very mechanically inclined and at least have a rudimentary understanding of EFI forced induction tuning (N/A tuning is different as far as AFRs and ignition timing) as you will want to get a standalone ECU and upgrade the fuel system to properly tune for it.

A 2 liter turbo with small boost output will not work on a car with 30% more displacement (or whatever it winds up to be). It'll spool like hell but it'll choke very fast and blow your head gasket.  Short answer, no. I wouldn't do it."
E30,2yagyo,protomor,2,Sun Mar 8 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"Not even with an 885 head swap? Which I was planning on doing anyway. I guess I'll sell the turbo and put it towards an hx35 turbo, I've heard some good things about them."

That will tell you if it will fit.  But regardless, it's based on literage. Changing the head won't change your displacement. You're still going to be pumping more exhaust gas into that hot side than it was designed for. So many other things... but just KISS with this. Don't do it chip.

I would like to mention that in addition to the turbo coming off a smaller displacement engine, as a general rule factory turbos are ""small"" compared to what we typically see used in an after market application. The goal of a oem turbo is usually low end torque. Makes people feel like the car is fast.The turbo is going to spool up quick and typically get close or do run off the efficiency island at the top of the rpm range of the engine. That is not the case for all oem turbos but it is for most production cars and is for the wrx. Now you want to increase gas flow by 25% across the turbine. You will be looking for a new snail a week after it gets running as you won't make any top end power and that is the point. It will however still make awesome swoshhhh noises. :-)  Learn to how to read compressor maps and plan this out. No turbo is created equal."

It would kill my cruise control with it, then when I hit the dash it would come back on.   Turns out my issue was that the material used for the cluster circuit board expands with heat and it had broken some of the solder points for the tach. I went in and reflowed the solder on my cluster and it's fine now. You'll have to bust out a magnifying glass to see the cracks in the solder sometimes, but that may be the issue. I added solder to some of my light connections while I was in there.   Of course, take a look at the SI board too. It might be worthwhile to buy a refurbished one with new batteries just for peace of mind. Or, you could get new batteries and resolder them in yourself.   You can get a refurbished one here: http://www.bavrest.com/si-boards.html  I recommend this seller. Bav. Restorations makes cool stuff and is great at communicating with you.   Well, I don't know about buying an engine harness. I have a spare one I got in case I screwed mine up while I'm doing my restomod. I'll be cutting and splicing wires so that it's hidden from sight as much as possible.   Removing the engine harness isn't that complex. I'm biased though, since my car was already disassembled for the most part when I pulled mine out. Anyway, tyu could pull it out and use a multimeter to test the wires for continuity.   This site has all the wiring schematics from BMW's from 1982 to 2006. Download your specific vehicle and look at the schematic to see which wire is which. Test each one, and replace the wires that are broken.   http://wedophones.com/BMWManualsLead.htm  It'll take a while, though.

Points are sprung-loaded bars inside a mechanical distributor, which send the spark from the coil to the plugs as soon as they make contact. No E30 after '84 had this system. Instead, the rotor makes contact inside the distributor cap, but the spark is electronically controlled via the ECU based on crank position. Distributor cap =/= distributor.  I've had to repair points on a '78 Vauxhall by the roadside with candy wrappers - I'm extremely grateful E30s don't use them."

I never have any problems. Parts availability is good, there's a wealth of support information online, and no special tools are needed.  However, this part troubles me:   How hard is it to keep them running while turbocharged with low boost?    Don't do this. The M20 engine is not some asthmatic japanese 4-pot. It was not designed for forced induction, and any off-the-shelf kit you find will be a chrome-plated bodgefest. If you're looking for reliability, don't even consider going for a home-made turbo kit; leave that for people obsessed with 1/4 mile track times, who run their cars for sixty seconds at a time, not six hours.

E30,2y3pul,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"Hold up there. I can agree no one should use an ""off-the-shelf kit"" for turbocharging their car, but that is an across the board rule of thumb. I really think that you are off about these engines and turbocharging though.   One of the biggest problems these engines faced was flow, and unless you are willing to do some massive porting and polishing the best way to overcome that is forced induction.   Also the stock internals are know for being very high quality. So high quality in fact that most suggest using the stock head gasket with a set of o-rings for forced f/i. The thing most people are worried about when going f/i is that they will snap a rocker.   I suggest doing a good bit more research before making ungrounded claims. And what is up with all the name calling? Lets keep this forum professional."
E30,2y3pul,Koniec24,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"You're entitled your opinion, of course. But I do have more than a modicum of knowledge on these engines, and know their weak points. The 885 head on the M20B25 is already engineered to its limits; as you said, the rockers are fragile, but the casting itself is also particularly weak between the cylinders, and the material around the ports was already thinned to pretty much its limits. Going forced induction on these long-term is not a clever idea at all, and since OP's primary concern seems to be reliability, then I hold to my advice of not stressing these engines any further than needs be.  As for name-calling; I don't think I've insulted anyone here, have I?"
E30,2y3pul,Koniec24,2,Fri Mar 6 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"From my latest experience, the mechanics won't ravage your wallet depending on where you go and where you're at. It's an extremely easy car to work on, especially with the huge engine bay with plenty of squeezing room to get in there. After a bit of studying on my part, I can safely say even as a novice, I could work on it without much hassle.   The common problems that seem to plague E30s are leaks, electrical gremlins, and rust in the wheel wells, battery tray and the footwells among some other problem areas. As with any 20+ year old car, a lot of rubber is gonna need replacing, namely the timing belt. The moment that thing snaps, you can say ""bye bye head."" The water pump and timing belt will need to be replaced the MOMENT you get that car. Doesn't matter when the PO said it was done last. Preventative maintenance is key to keep the car rolling and healthy. Depending on where you live, you can invest in rust prevention and repair with a nice undercoating. If you treat your E30 right, it'll treat you right. It is a BMW, so it might be a bit stubborn at first to work with you and cause you some trouble, but in time, it'll warm up to you and you'll want another one."

First when you are going to take the head off, back each of the headbolts off a little at a time, in an evenly spread pattern to prevent the head from warping.   Also you are going to want a new set of head bolts, or alternatively head studs. If you get head bolts you really are only supposed to use them once, however if you did spring for a set of head  studs from arp, they can be used multiple times. Also I would suggest getting a full oem head gasket kit. To be honest I am sure it has been a while if ever since the other gaskets, such as valve stem, and water pump gaskets were done.

If I'm in an accident, I'll just fix whatever's wrong with it, so long as it's not completely destroyed. However, it's not my daily driver any longer so I don't have to worry about speed in my repairs.   Anyway, not to be rude, but you're complaining about regular maintenance work on a car? That's all stuff that you have to replace on any vehicle eventually. It's just unfortunate that it's all bad right now.   Shit, you got a great deal on a car it seems. With a little work, she'll be a nice ride. E30's are now classics by both opinion and by age (now that they're over 25 years old). As such, there is no 'blue book' price for them anymore and cost is completely at market value. I expect it to be harder and harder to find cheap E30's for much longer as they are recognized as a great car to drive, but also to track. People are snatching them up now as it's the cheapest way to get into BMW's. . . for now. If you were to replace some of  those parts, you could probably make a small profit.    New shocks - if you want cheapo's, you can get rears for $35 each at Oreilly, fronts for $50/ea with a lifetime warranty. If they blow, trade them in. Repeat.  Tires - depending on the size, you can find them around $70 ea (that's what I pay for my Kumho's 205/55/15)  Fuel pump - upgrade to a TRE 255LPH pump. Costs around $69 and is a 20 min job, compared to the $200 BMW one. Link Here"
E30,2y0nwl,beefcakez,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the info. The fuel pump and tires i can do myself but im absolutely clueless and without tools to put in shocks.

The decision now is to spend a few hundred to have her somewhat roadworthy and see what i can trade her for in my area. This wont be my last e30  Edit: i spent around a stack on the car and they wanted 2800 (actually 3300 now that i remembered, was not worth it in my head) a year to insure, definately almost full coverage i think. How does liability work? In my head im thinkin that its something where i surance will cover the damages to the other party if i crash but not me? Thanks again for the information though"
E30,2y0nwl,beefcakez,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:06:08 2015 UTC,"The rears are really easy. It's three bolts total. Two on the shock mounts (reach these from inside the trunk) and one bolt on the trailing arm. Just jack the car up and unbolt them, replace.   The fronts are more work. You need to remove the entire strut which includes removing the tie rod and control arm, compress and remove the spring, then unthread the part of the strut that keeps the strut cartridge in. You might be able to do it without removing the tie rod and control arm, but I don't like to lean my strut outside the wheel well like that.   Harbor Freight has great deals on tools ;) You can rent a spring compressor and ball joint removal tool from your local auto parts store for free (you have to put a down payment though, in case you break it).   Anyway, yeah. Liability works like that. Injuries and repairs to the other party are covered by your insurance, but not on your car.   Well, if you decide to get rid of her, that's cool. I understand completely. It's just a car, after all. Don't screw up y our finances and such because a bunch of guys on the interwebz want you to keep her ;)"

And don't get me wrong, I love these cars but for some reason I can't bring myself to liking convertibles.

If you can't afford to insure it you may as well sell it, or make it your track car. Doesn't sound like junk to me though. If it had tires and a fuel system it should be worth closer to 1000.

But if you can afford to fix the suspension and put some part-worn tyres on it ($500? I don't know American prices for these things) then you should be able to sell it for a decent price.

The real money is spent on the equipment to do this work - 60gal air compressor, air-tools, mig welder, primer, seam sealer, spray guns, paint, clear coat, lots of other little things, and TIME...lots of your time.  I would not be doing this to the car if I didn't have another vehicle to drive while this is on-going.  I'm learning as I go, so it's often two steps forward, one back to fix my mistakes.    Fixing a car / body-work, is kind of a bucket-list item for me.  I did not think this would be quite such an undertaking, but it really is."
E30,2xuujc,CutlassSupremo,3,Wed Mar 4 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"No joke, the parts are nothing in comparison to the tools. I'm borrowing everything I can to repair the rust in my e30. Floor pans are toast in areas. Panel fitting takes a long time for me as I've never done it before and am teaching myself along the way."
E30,2xuujc,beefcakez,3,Wed Mar 4 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the good news is that floor pans are not cosmetic, so you don't have to do a world class job at welding because ultimately it is all hidden under stuff. Just make sure that you cover all your work with a good layer of epoxy to seal it away from the world. That self-etch crap that comes in a rattle can sold at harbor freight is practically useless. It is basically a lacquer but is also semi-permiable.  I recommend DP90LF. It's not cheap, but it hangs on to bare metal like the original epoxy dip these cars recieved. It's good stuff.   You also have to remember to mix the primary before combining it with the activator because it has pigment that separates out: I learned this the hard way as the first batch I mixed did not do a good job of hiding what I sprayed so I finished the first coat, put a stir stick in my gallon of primary and hit a muddy bottom. Shit! The tech sheets said nothing about mixing the pigments which settle. So I tossed what was left of the first batch and made a smaller second batch for my second coat. It went down like butter using my cheap home depot gravity feed HPLV gun.  These are the things that ya learn as you go along.  Reading forums helps, but there is no substitute for experience.  I wish I could find a local guru.  I had rust in my battery box and tail panel and that's what put all of this into motion for me. I stripped the car completly - even the windows are out. I hope I can remember where it all goes.   Also, along the way, I aquired a mini pot blaster to tackle the pitting/rust in the trunk and floor panels. I HIGHLY recommend one of these. It makes short work of surface rust and you must eliminate all of this before you seal the surface or your repairs will be short lived. I used black aluminum oxide as my blast medium. Wear a resporator. It's worth the ~$45.  Also, do your blasting outside...my garage has never been the same.    One more thing, if you remove your interior, you WILL find rust on the passenger foot well where the exhaust shield attaches to the frame. The shield is Aluminum, the chassis is steel; therefore, galvanic corrosion at each attachment point. Blast the spots and weld fill the holes you make in your car.  Be ready with a wet rag because the weld heat will likely start a fire on the under coating. Don't let it get out of control."
E30,2xuujc,CutlassSupremo,2,Wed Mar 4 23:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the guidance, man!   I'm also doing an engine bay smoothing, but that's nearly complete as far as metal work goes. Just need to remove the fusebox and weld in a panel underneath that. I may just leave it as is. . . .  Glad you suggested DP90LF. I saw a build thread on R3V where someone had used that and it was awesome! I couldn't remember what it was, so thanks. I had been racking my brain for that for a while.   Lucky for me, my brother is a body-guy and has all the necessary tools and such for us to knock out the paint and bodywork. However, he lives 5 hours away so it'll have to be in segments. First off, we'll finish the engine bay so I can put it back together and drive this thing again, if only for a little while. Then we'll start tackling the outside, eventually repainting this in the original Lachssilber Metallic.   I'm planning on shaving the side trim and antenna hole for sure, but everything else will be left essentially stock.   I bought a soda/media blaster recently so I could blast my Mazda RX7 calipers before getting them painted or powdercoated, so I'll hit the trunk with that as well. Like many other E30's, my battery box is complete crap, so I'm replacing that as well.   So much to do. Oh yeah, did I mention I told my wife I'd be driving it again by May? ;)"
E30,2xuujc,beefcakez,2,Wed Mar 4 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"That engine bay looks very nice. I'm super jelly. Are you doing an engine swap too?  I did some modification to my battery box, specifically to the bracket that the battery trey sits atop. I popped the spot welds that retain the bracket for access to the metal below the bracket. In place of these spot welds, I welded (3) stainless steel bolts virtically to the deck in a triangular arrangement in locations where three spot welds had previously been. The bracket now slides over these bolts and I retain the bracket with washers and nuts.  This allows me full access to all surfaces in the box should I have a spill or whatever and need to clean or flush it out. I also plan to go with gel / fully-sealed batteries that can't leak...because why chance it, ya know?  http://imgur.com/xU8Vm6o  This is looking backwards / aft inside the box. These bolts have tape over them to keep the DP90LF over spray out of the threads. I sprayed this immediately after sandblasting with the old tail pannel out. This was the first weekend of January this year.  My dad visited later that month and we hung the new tail pannel and plug welded / tacked it to the frame lip in the trunk floor. I'm still working on sides of the tail pannel, attaching them to the rear quarter pannels...one hour at a time after work, when I can spare it.  Edit: tell me more about the door and Antena shaving you plan to do. Sounds interesting. Are you deleting the black bumper trim and making the pannels and doors completely smooth?"
E30,2xuujc,CutlassSupremo,2,Thu Mar 5 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"No swap right now. I really like the old M20's for some reason. I do plan to build a stroker for more power later. Who knows, maybe I'll boost it too. For now, just cleaning up the M20 and putting her back in. This is part of my inspiration minus the ITB's. I'm doing a full wire tuck and will relocate all my hardlines to be barely visible wherever possible.   Thanks, man. It took me a long time to get those welds looking as good as they did because I'm using a cheapo Harbor Freight flux core welder with no temperature control on it. Gotta do overlapping spot welds with it or it'll blow through. My brother has a nice mig welder he's going to bring down when we get ready for paint in the engine bay. I'll put up another build update in the next couple weeks once I have the floor panels done.   That battery box idea is awesome. I'll have to do that myself. I haven't done anything with it yet, but the entire section closest to the wheel is gone and the back right side is only being held together with seam sealer :/ A new battery tray panel is $35 from the dealer, so I'll get that if I can't salvage this. So far, this has been pretty fun, but I'm ready to be done and driving my car again!"
E30,2xuujc,beefcakez,3,Thu Mar 5 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"So far, this has been pretty fun, but I'm ready to be done and driving my car again!    DITTO!  That M20 looks awesome.  I think I've seen this photo before.  I think what makes that particular M20 in the photo look so good to my eye is the valve cover.  It's just so clean and mechanical looking - no plastics, all metal.    I do love me some M20's, especially the sound they can make.  Mine has the M42, which is gutless, but it is a somewhat spritely little engine.  It loves to rev.  3700rpm @ 75mph all day like it's no big deal.  When this car is back together I'm going to start searching swap options while I drive the hell out of my little 4-banger.  I want to make mine howl like this thing does: http://youtu.be/Y8tBGppPSTk?t=17s I almost don't really care so much about the horsepower - most any 6 will do - I just want the sound and the thrill."

They were optional in 325e, and may have been optional in 325i various years. Most/all late convertibles seemed to have them, as did Mtech cars."

I'd pay $750 for a proper set if I could find them, they're all either tan or beat to shit.  I just passed on a $450 set that had been partially redone but had issues, I want something I can bolt in and forget about.  And I'm in SoCal, I could imagine how hard they are to find in less populated areas."

E30,2xrx79,leafman96,4,Tue Mar 3 10:45:27 2015 UTC,"The costs of fitting a 325i engine are relatively straightforward - here's a complete guide including a parts list for more info. Since it's a bolt-up-and-go conversion, the cost purely depends on how much you can find a used engine and drivetrain for (this varies wildly from country to country), and what tools you have at your disposal.  As for swapping in those other engines: begone, foul heretic."
E30,2xrx79,Grrrmachine,0,Tue Mar 3 11:25:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, no jdm inside of a euro car. But it is your car to do what you will with (although us bimmer guys will make fun of you). If your going to buy a 1jz why not buy an s50? They're the same cost and relatively the same power but the swap is well documented. Then later you could turbo the s50 and make crazy power."
E30,2xrx79,rustede30,0,Tue Mar 3 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"why an s50? If going through that much trouble, might as well s52/s54. And why a 1jz? not a 2jz?   it'll be way cheaper to do a m20 swap. people can't give them away."
E30,2xrx79,daruma3gakoronda,0,Tue Mar 3 18:39:31 2015 UTC,S54 cost more and the s52 is not as good as the s50 in my opinion.

E30,2xmrtn,FDNERGY,5,Mon Mar 2 03:33:38 2015 UTC,"You really need to do some independent research to comprehensively answer some of those questions. There is a wealth of information about these cars all over the internet. R3vlimited is a good start.  Ideally, you want a 325i with a manual transmission, '88-91, with little-to-no rust. Whether or not you can find such an example for $5000 is up to where you live. In many areas throughout North America and Europe, that amount of money will get you a decent E30, but it won't be perfect. If you're in Australia it won't buy you shit.  As for where you should look to buy one, again, this depends on where you live. If you're in North America then you're in luck, because the E30 is in relatively high supply and you should be able to find a number for sale on various sites (Craigslist, automotive sales sites, enthusiast forums such as R3v, etc.).   Whether or not they're as fun to drive as they look is a bit of a subjective judgement, but most E30 owners agree they're a blast. They're not fast by modern standards, but they handle well and you feel far more connected to the car than you would with any comparable car made in the last 15-20 years.   Do some Googling and read up on everything that you find. It's also wise not to spend your entire car fund on the car itself, because E30s are properly old and most of them have components that are on their way out. You'll be spending some money on maintenance until you can afford to do a complete refresh, so it helps to have some cash set aside and to do as much of the work yourself as you can."

E30,2xfkvm,Dr_octopus,3,Tue Mar 3 05:45:16 2015 UTC,Woo! 87 Zinno Eta 4 doors ftw! (I am also the second owner of mine) I love mine as a daily. I had an 89 325i before and I find the torque curve in the Eta to be so much more usable on the street. I put a conforti chip in mine and it filled in a couple weak spots on the power band and made it even nicer. Not fast by any means but it's nice to have a daily you can take to a twisty mountain road and still have fun in.
E30,2xfkvm,choppysmash,3,Sat Feb 28 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah I have the same conforti chip in mine! I agree the linear power band is really awesome, makes it feel like even though there isn't a ton of power, you're getting full access to the engines potential.

I agree that the 318is/320is e30's were damn sweet, and can be found for a fraction of the cost of an m3 obviously, and are very close to simply being a non-wide-body version of an m3, but still... the e30 m3 was the greatest sports car ever built.  I mean c'mon now.  I got my e30 318is in Germany for $1500 when I was over there, and loved every second I got to spend inside of it.  I even had a German in an e30 m3 drive by and stop his car, come out and shake my hand and talk to me about it for awhile as I gawked over HIS car.  It was one of only 2 I've ever seen in person.

They dropped zinc numbers due to sensitive emissions controls being damaged by it."

Oil analysis showed they were all good at protecting at 3, 4, and 5 k intervals and I've used all 3. No additive necessary with at least those 3. It would cause legitimate harms rather than good.  On a budget I'd go with M1 HM 5w30 in general (depending on climate). Amsoil and Redline are a bit more expensive but work very well and are well regarded. I'm trying liqui moly from Bavauto (February sale) to see how it analyses.  I know that M1 has 1000 ppm and redline and amsoil have roughly 1500. Above 1800 is bad for the car."

E30,2xd4d5,Dzdimi14,0,Fri Feb 27 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"That does look like a good car (OBC, sports seats, clean paint etc) but $6200 is strong money. There's wiggle room for negotiation (where did the front fogs go?) but based on the work already done, you're dealing with an E30 enthusiast who knows what car they have, and won't sell it for much less.  As for first cars; this is a 28-year-old example of precision West German engineering with enough power to lose you your licence.... or your life. If you treat it for the tail-happy sports saloon it is, are meticulous with your servicing regime, and use branded OEM replacement parts instead of cheap knock-offs, then it will pay you back with miles of smiles. If you treat it like everyone treats their first car or worse, start ""tuning"" it, you'll end up with a $6000 driveway ornament."
E30,2xd4d5,Grrrmachine,-1,Fri Feb 27 18:59:48 2015 UTC,you should be an enthusiast buying an e30 over an e46
E30,2xaxqh,KeysandClicks,3,Fri Feb 27 01:45:58 2015 UTC,you will find the IX specific parts are harder to find then the regular RWD I parts
E30,2xaxqh,FistingMona,2,Fri Feb 27 14:24:25 2015 UTC,And more expensive.
E30,2xaxqh,r3vOG,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"And its 10 times the car of a standard E30.    I <3 My IX.    Maintenance is a little bit more intensive, but as long as you stay on top of boots, and fluid changes, you'll really enjoy conquering massive grades in the snow, without any drama.   I'm still not quite sure why the IX gets such a bum rep.  I think its because people buy shitty ones and expect them to be good.    There's a bunch of IX specific groups, so finding ""hard to find parts"" isn't hard at all, just a little more pricey than your typical E30.   TL;DR- if you have the means, get an IX, but not necessarily THAT ix."
E30,2xaxqh,I_AM_BISON,2,Mon Mar 2 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"There are sketch reviews of car monkeys out there (but that's normal for everyone right?). You can find decent condition - running - relatively rust free - examples for around 3500-4500 if you wait and look. The IX has 0 details on it (the hood looks off color, the driver door isn't aligned and it doesn't even have basketweaves) and the engine, also has 0 details and 0 pictures. From everything I've read, if you get anything that's not working well or defective at all, they won't ship it back on their dime. Not to mention that's way overpriced. I'm pretty sure running motors with lower mileage run for $500-800. Probably not a good deal."
E30,2xaxqh,_kanon,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:16:07 2015 UTC,well i talked him down to 1200 via email. Going to look at it on saturday. If i could get it for 800 should i do it. And do you know any websites that sell the e30 motors?
E30,2xaxqh,_kanon,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:29:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert by any means - I've only owned my e30 for a few months. I'd say 700-800 sounds okay (the side skirts in good condition will go for at least 150, maybe 200) if it's non-running and the shell is okay. The biggest things I'm usually worried about are body condition - check underneath the carpet if you can (repairing rust gets really expensive unless you do it yourself - and I'm not sure the cost/time saving is going to be the worth it if there's a lot of it) and mechanically sound (but you're looking to replace the motor anyway). I would hunt for a part out or another IX if possible. Worst case, figure out what needs replacing in the blown motor. It might end up being less than 1600 to rebuild it. Could just be a cracked head for all you know."
E30,2xaxqh,beefcakez,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"800 would be a great deal for a rolling shell, but there will always be guys out there who manage to find running e30's for less than $400. I don't know how, but they do. Anyway, you can find used M20's on r3vlimited all the time from guys who are doing modern engine swaps. You can get a running one for $600 or so. Maybe even less if you're lucky."

I would suggest waiting for a manual to pop up.   As a first car, I think e30 would be a great first car. My first car was an e28 then moved onto an e30. I think it really teaches you how to drive."

E30,2x99o7,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,3,Sun Mar 1 22:12:31 2015 UTC,Just out of personal preference I would say get a RWD E30 and a manual is a MUST have especially for that vintage.
E30,2x99o7,Flagynar,2,Thu Feb 26 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, I've owned both an automatic and a manual E30 and believe me, you want a manual, hands down... As far the the IX, yea they're rarer and therefore more expensive, but for over 5k, that car better be near mint, zero rust, leather seats, virtually no mechanical issues to speak of... Don't forget, it is nearly a 24 year old car and shit will start to fall apart, and you will have to spend more for maintenance as time goes on.. My advice is wait for a manual 2 door, trust me, you'll be glad you waited.. Cheers..."
E30,2x99o7,Mostcallmejustin,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"Must be Texas, they make it sound like you need AWD to drive in the rain (hint: I live in Seattle. You don't.) Not that E30s make that much power anyway.  As a first car? Price seems fair if a little high (auto transmission means it should be cheaper, but iX's are rarer...) and it's an iX which means if you ever intend to work on it there will be some iX-only parts and twice as many axles to deal with. The fact that the center diff was replaced sounds good, since viscous LSDs do tend to wear out.  My personal opinion is look for a manual, especially in the case of an enthusiast car like the E30, but to each their own. I don't think a manual swap on an iX is as simple a proposition as it is for all other RWD E30s."
E30,2x99o7,Deltigre,2,Thu Feb 26 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think a manual swap on an iX is as simple a proposition as it is for all other RWD E30s.   I did one last summer. It's identical to swapping a 2wd E30 just the transmission assembly is heavier because of the transfer case.   Anyway, I agree with your post 100%. iXes are fun but auto iXes aren't nearly as fun. Swaps aren't entirely easy to find. Price is a bit high but if it's sorted that might not be such a bad thing provided you actually wanted the auto. Personally, I'd be looking for a nice 5-spd 325is coupe or at a minimum a 5-speed iX. Old automatic transmissions are horrible."
E30,2x99o7,karmat0se,2,Thu Feb 26 18:48:05 2015 UTC,It's because Texans suck a$$ at driving. I live right on the border but head into Dallas all the time. I-30 has like 3000 deaths alone each year. It's ridiculous.

The iX might make this one worth a bit more, but 5200 seems high.  Personally, I'd have a hard time recommending an E30, let alone an iX, to anyone as a first car. I love my 325is, but they can money pits, especially at the outset when you're fixing all the things the previous owner neglected before they finally deciding to sell it. Hope you've got some spare scratch (above and beyond the asking $5.2K). You will spend it.  But what do I know? I'm a grumpy old man who has been known to shake his head at kidsthesedays."

From my research I have gathered that it can be: CV, center support bearing, guibo, diff. Seeing as there is no way that there is that much play coming from the support bearding, or the guibo, its the CV's or diff. You should still check the guibo and center support though, they are culprit to many sounds, vibrations, and clunks."

E30,2x2j3g,Vythix,2,Wed Feb 25 03:58:39 2015 UTC,"It's the H&R Sport spring set, as well as the Bilstein Sport front struts and rear shocks. All together it cost around a grand in Canada, of course that's with me doing the work myself. I don't know how much it'd cost if you took it to a mechanic. When I took my front struts out they were leaking oil pretty bad so I don't really have a perfect reference for a stock setup, but I do love this new setup a lot more than I liked my stock suspension, it's a lot stiffer but not too stiff. Daily driverable stiff. It's great though. I just need to replace my control arm bushings and get an alignment and it'll drive like a dream.."

E30,2x2nys,supermansocks95,2,Wed Feb 25 03:48:49 2015 UTC,I'd just chuck a used box in it and then tinker with the one you pull. A used box should cost you about $200~300ish and would take a weeekend to install with hand tools. Just get some really long extensions and etorx bits. Dropping the engine down on the front crossmember makes getting the top bolts a bit easier.

E30,2wxyjf,flapaflog2516,6,Tue Feb 24 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously we can't tell you more until you post the link, but let me give you some general advice.   If you need to really scrounge together the cash to pay for the E30 then you shouldn't buy it. These are old cars, and most of them are home to components which are well past their use-by date, and may just be hanging on by a thread. There's a good chance you will have to buy some replacement parts in the first year or two of E30 ownership. Some E30 parts are surprisingly expensive unless you can source decent refurbished/aftermarket examples, so if you're blowing your bank just getting your hands on the car then you might end up in trouble.   You will also have to do your research when sourcing parts because a lot of aftermarket suppliers of E30 parts have problems with quality control (i.e. their products are total shit). Sometimes there might not be much feedback available for a particular aftermarket part, and you may decide to take a gamble on it (usually because it's significantly cheaper than OEM) only to find out that it's low quality or defective. This can be a costly mistake, particularly if the seller is uncooperative, but when the OEM part is double the price it should be, sometimes the gamble can be worth it. This is just one of the pitfalls of sourcing parts in a low supply market.   The cost of parts is compounded if you're not capable of working on the car yourself (required skill and necessary tools are the two key factors here) and have to pay someone to do it. This is something you can learn to do yourself, as everyone starts somewhere and you learn through experience. The problem is that you're planning on using this car as your daily, so if it's out of action while you're teaching yourself how to fix it then you'll be relying on public transport or friends/family to get around until you complete the work.   Don't let all that turn you off buying an E30; they're an excellent car and a lot of fun if you take good care of them. You just need to understand that it's not always going to be a smooth ride if it's to be your only car. Vigilant maintenance goes a long way, but no matter how careful you are there's still a good chance you're going to be contending with the issue of perishing components. You need to be prepared to either blow some cash or spend the time teaching yourself how to work on the car, and carefully sourcing well-priced parts and tools.   If I were spending ~5k on an E30, personally, I would want another 2k kept aside to help me keep it on the road long enough to get a feel for what needs work and address whatever issues arise in the short term."
E30,2wxyjf,yeahnahokay,4,Tue Feb 24 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"To add to this: the iX was and is a lot less common. The parts that are specific to them are hard to find and expensive. Working on an iX is harder too, or more expensive if you pay someone.  The price for an iX can vary quite a lot, because of their scarcity, but I wouldn't be afraid of jumping into a new adventure, if you can take the bus ever now and then."
E30,2wxyjf,perfecttttt,2,Tue Feb 24 04:11:05 2015 UTC,My ix was a money pit and was the biggest pain  to work on.  My ic is easy and nowhere near as many problems and parts are cheaper/more common.

Honestly not bad for maintenance as long as you change fluids and grease splines (Icould explain more iX specific stuff if you need) as soon as you get it! After that it's rarely worse than a RWD E30.   You can buy just the joints to save massive amounts of money.  Front inner  Front outer  If you want to do it yourself (pretty easy would reccomend) and you have another car so you can take your time, front ball joints for both sides would cost $104 instead of $480."
E30,2wxyjf,13515m0r3,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:57:10 2015 UTC,(I'm not OP I have an 88 iX already)  For poly bushes I'm not particularly worried. I have purple (street) powerflex bushings and NVH improved if anything. (When I did have front race hard poly bushings it did suck)  The price isn't great (I got my 88 (some say most desirable year I won't speak on that) for $4k with 110k miles in better condition and no mods in 2006) but I was more speaking for the iX as a model probably should have specified that. Agreed that the fuel cell makes me question things and the wheels etc.
E30,2wxyjf,yeahnahokay,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't pay more than 3k for that E30.  The addition of a race-spec fuel cell and all that poly would be enough to make me cautious about the car's recent treatment, and the poly bushings and CABs mean you're going to feel more vibration and harsher feedback, especially if the roads in your area aren't great.  Add in the fact that the owner is trying to take some parts with him (wheels and spoiler), leaving you with holes in your trunk and wheels that don't suit (Porsche phone dials), and the deal worsens. If you can't talk him into leaving the E46 steelies, be sure to inspect the condition of the tyres on the Porsche wheels. If they're on their way out then the price needs to drop again.  Then you've got the stupid shit you'll have to pull out like the meme gauge and aftermarket gauge surrounds (unless they're to your taste). Plus the cost of fixing the front control arms (and whatever the owner hasn't been completely honest about - trust me there is always something). On the plus side, it's a coupe, and has the pop-out rear windows (though check the seals for leaks, and the sunroof seals too).  In the end it's your call. You could do a lot worse for $3k, but I'd be hesitant to pay much more than that.  Edit: I've just noticed that the driver's side door also looks like it could be sitting a bit dicky in this pic. It could simply be the angle the photo was taken from, but the panel gaps between the door and the body aren't usually that pronounced. That might be something you want to investigate if you end up inspecting the car. Be sure to check the VIN for any accident history."

Easy part done. The front struts though are kind of annoying.. What I did was I took the control arm ball joint and tie rod ball joint out of the hub assembly. (again those were a bitch) used heat, pickle forks and a sledgehammer. I also took the break caliper off. I then took the whole strut assembly out with the rotor and used a strut compressor to compress the spring, take the strut mount off, uncompress the spring, spring out, take out the seized strut inserts, put the new struts in, seat the spring, compress the spring, strut mount back on. Then you just out it all back in and together. Do that on both sides. Took about 4 hours to do the whole thing, a lot of messing around though.   Final product feels a billion times better than my old worn out oem setup, even before an alignment."

E30,2wojnn,protomor,2,Sun Feb 22 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"The whining is likely the two input bearings. The problem with that is that you mess with pinion depth and has to be done with special tools. $1000 to rebuild it sounds reasonable to me actually. You can get rebuilt ones online for $2k.   If you look through my post history, I have a bunch of youtube videos going over bits. But nothing on the input bearings as even I won't touch them."
E30,2wojnn,protomor,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:16:58 2015 UTC,So how can the pinion depth be messed with? I haven't done anything with the diff and it's been there since I bought the car. I'm asking because I don't want a rebuild diff to go back in there for it to start making the same  noise again.
E30,2wojnn,zoucet,2,Sat Feb 21 20:48:51 2015 UTC,pinion depth is related to a crush washer between the two input bearings. You tighten it to a certain point and check pinion depth. Too tight and you have to remove the crush washer and get a new one then start over. FUN.

E30,2wmc1z,dahabit,2,Sun Feb 22 01:14:42 2015 UTC,People have transplanted the f20c (9k red line monster from the Honda s2000) and I think some people have swapped in VAG 1.8l turbo engines.

E30,2wmc1z,protomor,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"As a daily driver, it is much more comfortable and feels really solid. The thing that goes wrong to make them handle badly is the steering. The E34 has the recirculating ball steering instead of rack and pinion, which is fine when it works, but when it hasn't been maintained, you end up with a very vague steering feel.  To even out driving this bigger heavier car, I also have an E21 which is even more visceral drive than the E30."

E30,2wmc1z,13515m0r3,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:19:16 2015 UTC,Apparently an electric fan isn't very popular among some forum users because a clutch fan is better. My electric fan is awesome. I wired it up to a switch so I can turn it on whenever I want. It's off almost all the time when I'm driving and my car's temperature hardly even reaches the quarter mark.
E30,2wmc1z,Narek_S,1 point,Sat Feb 21 07:32:58 2015 UTC,Quarter mark? You know it's supposed to stay half way right? It's running too cool and yes there is such a thing.
E30,2wmc1z,13515m0r3,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:50:05 2015 UTC,Well once I changed everything in the cooling system that happened.
E30,2wmc1z,Narek_S,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"What thermostat? Is it stuck open?  Cause I upgraded to an all aluminum Mishimoto radiator, new hoses, everything (and I mean everything outside of new engine passages) and I'm at the half mark.   Having an engine run to cool lowers efficiency and can result in the same damage running an engine without a full warm up can cause (think carbon deposits on valves etc). Potentially your gauge could be miscalibrated as some weird electronic result of the fan? But I doubt that."
E30,2wmc1z,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sun Feb 22 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"It ran like this before the fan. I've got new hoses, a new thermostat, and a new water pump. I doubt the thermostat is stuck because it ran like this before I changed it too."
E30,2wmc1z,Narek_S,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:30:20 2015 UTC,"Nah I'm sure it isn't and not really referring to that.  BMW intended on the temp gauge staying within 5-10 degrees of half way (as in straight up). It's undamped (later generations were dampened so as to appear more solid) so it should be a gauge or the coolant temp sensor.  Since the thermostat is new and didn't change after you replaced it, I'd guess it's the coolant temp sensor.. This may* also be feeding info to the ECU and it could be giving the engine misinformed calculations. If there's no bad symptoms I wouldn't worry that much.  *Some E30s have 2 sensors one for the gauge and one for the ECU, and some have 1 AFAIK"
E30,2wmc1z,daruma3gakoronda,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:05:21 2015 UTC,I changed that sensor ~2 months ago :/. My friend's e30 runs at the same temperature as mine does and he too has changed his whole cooling system.

E30,2wka4k,protomor,4,Fri Feb 20 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm 89? It looks awesome! Great color!   How's the interior?  As a new E30 (and more particular iX) owner, here's some tips:  Timing belt every 50k miles (not 60 like rwd e30s).  Right now (as in ASAP) take the shaft from the TC to the front axle and grease those splines real good! That is the primary weak point in the otherwise excellent and very durable AWD system. It can be done without a lift and is very easy to do.  Replace the drive train fluids. At the very least do the front axle and TC as they are very pricy!!!   More general E30 stuff:  Make sure coolant isn't old. Replace hoses or you'll get stranded/warp a head. I had my coolant jacket on the throttle body fail and thankfully it didn't strand me!  After that stuff: enjoy it! It looks awesome!"
E30,2wka4k,13515m0r3,3,Fri Feb 20 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pointers. I am looking for a clean dashboard for it, sadly this one has a crack. Other than that the interior is in really good shape.  Thankfully due to European inspections the car is very sound mechanically."
E30,2wka4k,13515m0r3,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear.  Still make sure that you grease that spline: for some reason it wasn't done from the factory and a Transfer case is $600+ if it doesn't just damage the joint. And I don't know if euro inspections check diff and TC fluids, if so ignore, but it's inexpensive enough ($80 for all fluids at most) that I'd personally do it. It takes an hour if you have a pump nozzle and drain pan.  EBay dash is about $360. Most do crack it seems..."

E30,2wlen2,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,3,Fri Feb 20 22:44:02 2015 UTC,I've opened up my valve cover twice for valve adjustments and I can tell you that it's very easy to get it off. Just buy the gasket and replace it yourself. It's 4 or so bolts to detach the intake manifold from the valve cover and I believe 8 bolts to get the valve cover off. $900 is a little less than the amount you would pay for a head gasket change. Don't pay that much for a valve cover gasket change.

E30,2wlen2,kts262,2,Sat Feb 21 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"It's really just a bunch of 10mm bolts to remove the valve cover and replace the gasket. I could probably do it in under 10 minutes. But while you're in there you may as well do a valve job, which should take about 3 hours at the most, less if it's a ""professional"" shop. You should never take your car to this shop again, and tell everyone how bad they tried to fuck you. 7 hours is a headgasket and a timing belt, not a valve cover gasket. ""Because it's European it will take longer"" Wat. My dad has a 94 oldsmobile, can't get more american and simple than that, right? Wrong. Took 4 hours and having to jack the motor up off of a mount to replace a valve cover gasket. Pro tip though, if working on your own car isn't really an option for you, perhaps moving onto something cheaper and easier might be a good idea. Owning and maintaining an e30 as it should be maintained would get very very expensive if you don't work on it yourself. But it isn't hard, E30s are simple, parts are plentiful and the community is great. Buy a Bentley manual, make a r3vlimited account and have some late night study sessions and before you know it you'll be changing timing belts like it's nothing. I knew next to nothing about cars at 16, now at 19 I am converting our new family car, a 325i 4 door, to 5 speed. It's not as scary as most people think."

Ask about the timing belt, the water pump, the last time the fluids were changed and the shape of the suspension/brakes. Leaks are common on E30s.  Also, ask if there's any electrical problems. Yeah, it's an older car, but an electrical issue in an E30 can be annoying as all hell to solve. Check all the lights and bulbs. If it has any maintenance history and documents of going to a shop, check them.   If you're concerned about rust, refer to this: E30ZoneWiki"

E30,2wjef6,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"Oil pan gasket, the differential and the gearbox seals/guibos, sometimes the power steering rack. I'd personally recommend shelling out extra cash for a Pre-Purchase Inspection from a specialist."

E30,2whm4r,dumbbirds,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:18:17 2015 UTC,Eh some engines tick worse than others. My iX ticks pretty loudly but is adjusted correctly while my friends higher mileage i ticks more quietly.   And yes I've torn apart the top end and checked for wear. It's good.

E30,2whm4r,perfecttttt,2,Fri Feb 20 03:10:18 2015 UTC,That valve tick sounds seriously loud to me. Have you taken the valve cover off?
E30,2wiifk,StuntedJet,4,Fri Feb 20 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"That is a horrendously unloved turd, and I wouldn't touch it with yours.   Those sort of paint/wrap jobs are used to hide serious defects in the paint and bodywork. You have no clue what the shell is really like, and with these cars condition is everything. The cause of the oil leak may be minor (loose sump bolts leading to a slipped gasket) but the effects can be devastating; the most common form of oil leak leads to air being sucked into the oil pump, leading to oil starvation and serious engine wear. No A/C system ""just"" needs a recharge. You've either got a failing gasket/O-ring (labour intensive) somewhere, or one of the (expensive) components has failed and needs replacing. Piss-yellow lights, missing trim, no front lip, torn interior... It's been in a front-end collision and the panel-gaps haven't been fixed? Meaning the shunt was so bad the gaps can't be fixed.   Really, that is a joke of a car. You'd be utterly mad to throw $3800 at it."

E30,2wfm8d,r3vOG,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"I put together my album on how to reupholster sport seats using the kit you can buy off Ebay months ago, but I only did it on one seat and it didn't include the seat repairs which took a few months for me to acquire the parts and repaint my sliders. It's a nice kit that's easy to install. You just need some snips, hog rings and pliers, some wrenches, and a razor blade to cut holes. However, for anyone looking at buying this, I'd ask them to use oem foam in the seatbacks at least. The new foam used in this kit is really thick and now my seats no longer 'hug' me like they used to as it pushes you too far forward and out of the side bolsters. I might pull the skins off of these and reuse the old foam if the foam doesn't break in after a few months.   As for the repairs. I'd recommend replacing the seat pistons for sure. All four of the seat tilt pistons were shot. Also, buy new cables for the seat recline/release too. I bought mine oem from BMW of South Atlanta. Having non-stretched-to-crap cables makes using the handles much easier. Install the new cables before you put the new upholstery on. I didn't, so I could only replace half of the cables. You can cut them out, but you won't be able to tilt them enough to thread them into the holes."
E30,2wfm8d,RackedE30,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:00:10 2015 UTC,Total cost to do both seats?
E30,2wfm8d,Narek_S,3,Thu Feb 19 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"Too dang much! Nah, not terrible.   Seat upholstery kit (German vinyl) plus replacement driver bolster foam: $548.98  (4) seat pistons (from ebay guy): $86  Mtechnic seat badges (2 front): $24.50  Seat release ropes: $58.58  Total: $718.06 (Shipped)  It would save to use non-German Vinyl, but if you look back at my upholstery album you can see how thin the aftermarket stuff is. German is much better.   It was pricey, but cheaper than having someone else reupholster them for me and since I did it myself I was able to repair and replace every bad part in there. Also, I believe you can get this guy (zoomzoomzooming) to make you a custom kit too if you want different material or special stitching, etc   Edit: forgot the kit price included replacement bolster foam for the normal wear spot on the drivers upper bolster"

E30,2w4j1v,deject3d,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Iv heard it's very hard to find a 318is with an lsd. Pretty much the only difference between the late model 318i and 318is is suspension, which after 24 years, is usually replaced, and the front lip and rear spoiler. Go for the 318i. with the money left over you could get a great suspension if its stock now and an is lip and spoiler"
E30,2w4j1v,redreda123,1 point,Tue Feb 17 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"For starters, posting here as a Brit is going to confuse lots of Americans. The American market never got the ""standard"" 318i with the awful M40 engine that you're talking about, so their models (318i, 318iS, 318iC) all use the same M42 engine, which is what you're looking for.  Now to business. Your idea is perfectly valid: dropping an M42 into a bog-standard 318i is child's play, and if you can pick up a rot-free shell for 1400 quid you've done well, since rust is a critical factor when buying these cars.  However, 1400 notes for a manky 318iS is a waste of cash. If the car's as bad as you say it is then there's nothing worth carrying over to the 318i: brakes will be seized, suspension will be shagged out, and so on. You will be able to find all the 318iS parts you need (engine, manifold, suspension legs, rear discs) from reputable traders and breaker's yards for a lot less.   Check out the E30 Zone (NOT the facebook group) for more info, including the Wiki on Engine Swaps.  As for the diff: an LSD is nice, but a 20-year-old one that's never been rebuilt will not do you any favours."

As for your other questions:    If you want a simple drop-in solution, get an M20B25 engine with Motronic 1.3 management, a Getrag 260 manual gearbox, a Type 188 medium-case LSD (rebuilt) with 3.91 ratio, some eibach -35mm springs or the H&R cup kit, and some Bilstein B4, B6 or B8 shock absorbers depending on the ride stiffness you want. You MUST also replace your rear subframe bushes with genuine OEM RUBBER (NOT poly) bushes by Meyle, Febi or Lemforder, as well as your engine mounts and shifter linkage bushes. If you just want your car to look like all the other unloved turds dragging their arses around the the local track drift-day event, then fit some cheap coilvers, pointless polybushes, some 17 inch rims and a pod filter to impress your mates. If you want a serious road weapon, do some research into fitting an Motorsport (M) engine, such as the S50/S54 family of engines.   EDIT: Just read your post on /r/BMW. You're thinking about buying this car because $400-$700 puts it in your price range? Walk away. Walk away from E30s now, and come back when your budget is closer to $3000."

E30,2w23n4,13515m0r3,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"Poly slips, twists and squeaks, and adds friction where none should exist. Rubber bushes are designed to twist to absorb the forces; polybushes by their very nature don't, leading to a very unpleasant driving experience.  If it was just something like ARB bushes then poly is fine, but for something critical like the rear subframe I wouldn't trust them at all."
E30,2w23n4,protomor,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:01:31 2015 UTC,Disagree.   It's firmer but NVH is the same if not better than before. Would it be smoother with rubber? Yes but honestly a stiffer rear end is way nicer than that.   Upstate NY cold and there's no squeaks. I don't know what you mean by friction because its not a rotating assemble and it has significantly less friction than rubber in rotation anyways.

The relays are under the black plastic cover, between the battery and the fusebox. The bulkhead is the wall between the engine area and the passenger area.  But I do not think fuses and relays are your problem. I think this sensor is the problem. To confirm, check that your spark plugs are working. If they don't, then replace that sensor on the front of your engine.  More information on the sensor."

E30,2vvbm5,leafman96,1 point,Sat Feb 14 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of thought into what I would do to an E30 to make it into a drift car. Idealistically (if it were me) I would choose a 2 door coupe series 2. Although the choice of 318i/325i would be depending on whether you would put a different engine in it. Don't bother with an ""is"" as you would be taking out the better suspension setup for coilovers etc. and the body kit really isnt going to be the top priority IMO......   If you are not planning an engine swap, then go with a 325 coupe. As  I am pretty sure its the same engine a a 325is (""is"" is just suspension, body kit, sporty interior). As the 318i, from experience, is lacking power, and the 318is (this ""is"" is double cam instead of single) coupe would probably be the same for drift purposes...   If you are planning on doing an engine swap, just find a coupe (personal preference, although I've also heard the sedan is more rigid) and dump whatever engine pleases your kilowatt/torque needs :D."
E30,2vvbm5,shakystart,2,Sat Feb 14 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Actually I am going to disagree just a smidge. I think he should go for an is just because they all came with an lsd stock, and yes you could swap one in, but why do more work when you can buy an is with one already installed?"

Welding your diff is like $50 from some random dude while an LSD can go for around $2k.   Factory E30 LSDs on the other hand can be found for $200-300 (usd). It's cheap enough that welding isn't necessary. Though, because they came factory, many are worn out inside and will one tire fire upon occasion.

Still 1.8 liters. still slow as balls. If you aren't going to swap motors, you want a 325i or 325is. is preferred since it'll save you time sourcing an LSD.   Coupe or sedan makes no damn difference. It does but it won't make a difference to you until a decade from now. Plus, roll cages alleviate any need for a sedan B pillar. Sedans weigh more. Blah blah. I like the rear doors because, if you drive your car to the event, it's easier to load and unload.   If you want proof I'm not some internet doof. This is me in december and this is what I did today"
E30,2vvbm5,protomor,1 point,Sat Feb 14 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"shit, nice man. what engine mods would be worth doing first, also would a 320i or 323i  be worth it"
E30,2vvbm5,protomor,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:49:43 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you about a 320/323 as I've never driven one. Even the 325 feels gutless to me. For 2 liters, the 1.8 M42 seems more worth it since weight will even it out.   Engine mods are simple. Free flowing exhaust, chip for the ecu, and literally nothing else but maintenance. Those two mods will probably give you 15whp if your engine isn't too tired. Everything else is just 0.5hp at best. Even the cone filter mod has been known to actually lower top end power."

E30,2vvbm5,protomor,1 point,Mon Feb 16 09:58:56 2015 UTC,Man I did every stupid mod under the sun to get power out of that M20. Then I did an M20 turbo. Which was fun. Blew that up. M50 non vanos turbo. Blew that up. S52 turbo. Sold that (didn't blow that one up). And now I have an LS2.   I did help with a JZ swap. I'd rather turbo an M5x based engine just for packaging. Just felt like so much work and it still had heating issues and no power assisted brakes.

E30,2vo807,yeahnahokay,2,Sat Feb 14 04:10:29 2015 UTC,E30s always do. There's so much glass on the car that it just looks dicky when tinted. Big clear windows suit the classics much better.

E30,2vm4m1,tokeonthis,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:32:49 2015 UTC,I've wrapped an E30. The hardest part is where the c-pillar meets the rear body panels. It's difficult to deal with the seam there unless you do it up high. We solved this by using a different colour for the roof.
E30,2vm4m1,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:08:21 2015 UTC,Yea that's where I thought I would have trouble doing but the hardest part is finding vinyl large enough to cover the whole area. Do you have any pictures of it?

We did the roof teal and the c-pillars white. Made a template of a curve to match both sides and just kinda followed the roofline. It looked okay. I'm not sure how you'd do it with a solid colour though."
E30,2vm4m1,karmat0se,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"My guess is I would have to do one giant piece that would be able to cover the roof, c pillars, and rear panels. It will take time but it should be worth it"

I have faced setback after setback from hoses that needed to be replaced, to my crankshaft chipping as I was going to put it in, and finally when I though I was all set, I was putting the head back toghther, and was screwing the cam deal back on to Bentley manual specs when I noticed my wrench wasn't resisting any more. And lo and behold this bugger had snapped.   I fealt 100% defeated. I was sure I was going to have to pay some insane amount for a shop to pull this out. After sitting down and praying about it though I figured I would at least give it a shot. And would you believe it after 2-3 minutes of work I was able to get it out. It's such a small victory to be honest but to a man who feels like he has been beaten down by failure the whole way this really has lifted my spirits.  Edit: God loves you all too.

E30,2vdofu,SoundByte,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only reason I think I want the kit is because of the cool knob it comes with. Comes out to about the same price as a ZHP knob + short shift stuff if you price it  individually."
E30,2vdofu,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:35:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm just saying that if you already had a knob you liked, you could accomplish essentially this setup with like $20 and a trip to the scrapyard. But if budget isn't a serious concern for you, this saves on the logistical end of things, and you get to support a grassroots tuning shop at the same time!   I ordered my delrin shift carrier bushings from garagistic, but they seem to be pretty much indestinguishable from the condor bushings."
E30,2vdofu,r3vOG,1 point,Sat Feb 14 10:57:59 2015 UTC,I already purchased the rebuild kit from Turner Motorsports. Thanks though!
E30,2vdofu,r3vOG,3,Sat Feb 14 11:10:43 2015 UTC,"Good gracious that seems expensive for that kit.   You can get a short shift kit with the z3 1.9 for less than $90, then buy the shifter from Condor at $115 or the ZHP knob for $75.   The rear carrier bushing, shift lever bushing, and shifter rod joint can be pieced together cheaply as well. I got delrin bushings from Garagistic and the shifter rod joint from ECS (didn't get OEM though).   I'm actually doing this upgrade right now myself. Unfortunately, I overpaid for mine because I didn't shop around well enough. I don't want you to make the same mistake."

E30,2vd2uv,GulleyCat80,3,Tue Feb 10 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, BBS makes some 4 lug wheels but they are expensive. I would recommend finding a set of basketweaves online that came on an iS car or an iX car, they're not too hard to find and usually go for around $400."
E30,2vd2uv,ConverseToothbrush,2,Tue Feb 10 04:58:18 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up though, the usdm is weaves are 14x6.5 which isn't exactly optimal. The iX weaves are 15x7 which is great but they're et41 so you're going to need spacers. I can't remember exactly what size of spacers, but spacers are required. And fwiw, I wouldn't run spacers on a track.   In Europe though they did have a 15x7 et24 basketweave that is commonly referred to as the ""Euroweave"". It's the one you want if you're gonna go this route (imho) but they're tricky to find if you're in North America.  Good luck in your search!"

""This is the shit you do to the second car, finish the one in the garage first."" But he's there to help when I annoy him enough.   The stuff you want to do does seem to be rather nominal though. You don't need to do a ""rust inspection"" if you have rust cut it out and weld in new metal. I'd probably save and get a second manual if you wanted one, it would be easier than swapping and would leave your daily driver alone. You could get one that needs work and learn to work on them that way. Have you ever worked on a car before? An oil change is dead simple all you need is a Jack and a wrench (you should use Jack stands to be safe but that's on you). I wouldn't trust the idiots at valvoline (or whoever) to change my oil because they hire retards who don't care about your shit, plus it's cheaper to do it yourself."

Changed the timing belt and water pump, did oil changes and fiddled with the botched wiring from its PO to solve a stereo issue with it not turning on the moment I started the car. You would have to wiggle it. The problem is that my dad doubts me too much. My priority is getting it bulletproof and working every possible problem out just like my Sentra.

E30,2vckx0,single-needle,4,Wed Feb 11 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"5speed swap is great. not as easy as it looks but not rocket science. Still easier than say, a head gasket job. Rust, don't worry about this now. Unless the rust is so bad that the floor boards are rusted through trunk seals and window seals, YES YES and YES. do this.  E36 seat swap, don't. those seats aren't worth it. Cover what you have now if they're beat to shit and think about other seats or have yours redone. It's about $1000-1500 for front and back jackstands / ramps / jacks. yeah, you definitely need those. definitely do your own oil. i don't trust those 10min oil places to use a new crush washer and/or NOT strip your drain plug.   In regards to the boy racers on forums, he's kind of right but also wrong. There has been so much documentation on the e30 online because of it's age and popularity that you can't help but realize that there really is some great information on the forums. Caveat emptor though, with that same mentality, there is a hell of a lot of shit info on the forums too."
E30,2vckx0,joshamania,2,Mon Feb 9 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"Your last bit there, I think, makes e30's one of the best cars to learn to work on.  There are TONS of videos and online resources for fixing & maintaining these cars."
E30,2vckx0,single-needle,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:05:04 2015 UTC,i agree wholeheartedly. miata's are like legos too. super easy to work on if not easier than an e30. i prefer my e30 over a miata but that's my choice.
E30,2vckx0,joshamania,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:21:34 2015 UTC,That's probably my next one...a Miata.  It'll be a toss up between that and a 325i (if I can find one cheap enough).  It seems to me that it's either a Miata or an e30 as the go-to cheap race/track car.
E30,2vckx0,single-needle,2,Tue Feb 10 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"oh man, the Miata by far is an easier track car to maintain cost wise and simplicity. it's more modern and parts are abundant. lots of track data from others. Dare I say it might be superior to the e30 as a budget track car. Sure as hell doesn't look or sound as cool as a good ol' 325i though.  one of my best friends runs one and he's done quite a bit modestly and the car is a powerhouse due to the power to weight ratio. It's still hard for me to NOT make fun of him driving a ""cute"" little roadster."

I didn't think that it was going to turn me into a car guy, and now I do every repair/mod for myself short of machine shop work. If you want a car to motivate you to learn about it and and tinker with it, an E30 is a great car for that. It's a lot of work, and usually plenty of money, especially on a long enough timeline, and maybe your dad just wants to make sure you're serious about it. If you are, go for it!"

E30,2vckx0,beefcakez,2,Tue Feb 10 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. Don't be afraid, just do it. Your father should respect your intrests honestly. These are completely reasonable things to do to your car.

E30,2vckx0,Chinampa,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"Wow. Seeing this really makes me appreciate how awesome my dad is.   I agree with your reasoning for those modifications. This vehicle is continually increasing in value now as it's now become a classic. Those modifications will only increase the value. Well, not the e36 seats. Please don't get the e36 seats. Get a pair of sport seats and reupholster them or something. Vaders look ridiculous in E30's, IMO. I just reupholstered my sport seats and they're awesome.   As for the cluster, look for one on ebay that has broken odometer gears. They run for cheap. New gears can be bought from Garagistic for less than $20, IIRC. I have both the VDO and Motometer clusters (for a spare). Extremely easy to replace the gears. You can change the service indicator batteries while it's apart too.   Also, I'd take a close look at the solder points on the circuit board. The board material used kinda sucks and expands as it gets hot. If you have broken solder points, this will break the electrical continuity and cause it to go haywire. I reflowed every point on my cluster recently just to make sure I didn't have that issue anymore. Definitely helps to have a spare.   Your dad doesn't want you to change oil or sparkplugs? Good gracious. He must not know anything about e30's. They're seriously the simplest engine to change plugs in, and the oil change takes minutes.   Anyway, I'd just keep doing what you want on the car and let him respect your decisions in time.   Good luck, OP."

Yes, using the gear installed makes turning the cam much easier. Wrap the old timing belt around it and tighten with a vice grip. Coat everything with oil.

E30,2v2qbj,Radl00se,3,Sat Feb 7 08:10:19 2015 UTC,"It's hard to make out the condition of the shell from the pictures, and this is the most important thing by far. 26 year old cars will have rust, and the location and severity of this will be far more important than what wheels it has.  Looking at the facts:   It's got an M20B20 engine. That's not great - same power as the 1.8 M40 engine, same fuel consumption as the far more powerful 2.5 M20 engine. A pleasant cruiser, but nothing inspiring. Safe for a new driver though. The engine's been swapped. What happened to the old one? Did the previous owner forget to swap the timing belt, so it snapped and trashed the engine? Probably. Has the new engine been treated to a new timing belt? Probably not. What lesson do we learn here, children? That interior is heavily abused. Rear seat covers, aftermarket front seats, cover masking the cracked dashboard and a ropey old gearknob - this car has not been loved at all. New springs, but the arse is dragging along the floor?   Basically, from the awful pics it looks like an awful car. In the flesh it might be straight, but DO NOT buy this if it eats up all of your budget. Spares for these cars are very expensive down under, and that one will need plenty of work to turn it into a reliable vehicle. I would honestly expect to throw close to $1000 at it almost immediately to fix whatever issues it may have (and it will have them). You need to know what oil was used in the engine and what spark plugs were fitted, how old the tyres are, and when the timing belt was last changed. If the owner doesn't know, or doesn't have receipts to show when any of that work was done, then the car needs a significant price reduction."

The 325i uses a 6-cylinder M20 12v belt-driven engine to put down 170hp.  The 325i (the ""i"" is really imporant here) definitely has more power, but the 318iS has much better throttle response, and the lighter engine is what gives it the go-kart feel.  There's also the 325e, which is an asthmatic strangled M20 engine with a rev limit of 5000 and the same horsepower as the 318iS. Avoid this at all costs; it's no fun to start with, and it's worse knowing that are two far superior engines available.  Beyond that, the 325i and 318iS both have the same brake and suspension setup, and were available in 2- and 4-door versions so there's no other real difference."

E30,2v2mem,Avinn,2,Sun Feb 8 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"all good points, might as well throw in some opinions too! I will say relative to the 2 cars the 318 maybe more ""go-karty"" but the e30 in general is small and fairly light, the 325i handles great as well. if we are talking stock engines i think the extra torque(throughout the powerband) outweighs the go-kart feel. also the sound of the m20 is fantastic! the stupid belt is probably the biggest negative.  if you're doing a turbo build, my preference would be with the m42 though."

The 318 is lighter up front and it revs up quicker, so you get the impression that it accelerates and handles better. But once you wind the 325i over 4000rpm it really is a faster car that you can do a lot more with."

I just have a couple more questions if it's no problem  What are the advantages/disadvantages of having a chain driven engine over a belt driven engine?  When you say that the 318iS has a better throttle response, are you talking about how you can feel the responsiveness of pressing down on the accelerator?  Can the 318 be worked on just as easily as the 325, in terms of messing around with the engine and performance upgrading?   In addition to the last question, which is the better ""tuner"" engine to work on?  With your last point, I'm guessing that the body styling and trim are the same for the 318 and 325 right?  Cheers!"

E30,2v2mem,Grrrmachine,2,Sat Feb 7 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"What are the advantages/disadvantages of having a chain driven engine over a belt driven engine?   Chain will probably never break on you. Chains were chosen for their reliability. They can stretch though, and may need adjusting  Belt might, but if you change them every 60k miles, you're not gonna have a problem. Manufacturers went to belts because of cost, noise and driveline loss improvements. Most manufacturers went back to chains because too many people were not changing their belts.   When you say that the 318iS has a better throttle response, are you talking about how you can feel the responsiveness of pressing down on the accelerator?   yes.   Can the 318 be worked on just as easily as the 325, in terms of messing around with the engine and performance upgrading?   Both engines pretty much suck to mod. Don't waste your energy and money trying to make them faster, unless you wanna go turbo.   With your last point, I'm guessing that the body styling and trim are the same for the 318 and 325 right?   Yes. There is a rare version of the 318 which does not have a sunroof in the USA. These are known as slick tops, and some people like em.  I'd go for the 325. the torque is awesome."

E30,2uxlx7,insomiagainz,4,Fri Feb 6 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"There are four main engine families for the E30:   M10 (4-cyl) M20 (6-cyl) M40 (4-cyl) M42 (4-cyl)   From these, there are a number of available displacements. All the 4-cyl engines are 1800cc, but the M10 and M40 also exist in a 1600cc flavour. The only 4-cyl worth having is the M42, which is chain-driven  with 16 valves,coil packs and a reasonably modern ECU.  All the flavours of the M20 engine use the same block design, but three difference heads were used. All are belt-driven with an interference design, so if the belt snaps your pistons will smash your valves and kill the engine. These engines were available in 2000, 2300, 2500 and 2700cc flavours, but the first two aren't really available in the US.  This leaves the 2500 (M20B25) and 2700cc (M20B27) engines. Oddly, the smaller of the two is far more powerful (35hp more), but is a bit more fragile. Overheating is very likely to cause the head to crack, and since the head is unique to that version it can be very expensive to source a replacement. In contrast, the more robust M20B27 is simply not worth owning if you are racing; it's severely restricted, low revving and designed for economy, not speed.  TL;DR: You want an M20B25, but you must look after the timing belt and cooling system religiously, or an M42 if you want light and fast-revving."

E30,2uxlx7,DaveLeon,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"There's no easy way, since there were quite a few six-cylinder models out there. Simplest way is to read the part number off the top of the AFM, and check it out on realoem.com to see if it fits the M20B25.  Otherwise, get under the car and look for the engine number. It's stamped on a flat face of the block, just above the sump gasket by the oil dipstick tube. But 25 years of rust might have made it hard to read."

E30,2us5nv,rustede30,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:12:06 2015 UTC,With a chip  you're buying one specific  tune that's set up for a stock  motor. If you buy a megasquirt then you are getting a whole new ecu. You can have it tuned to anything and everything  you change on your motor such as your turbo or new head.  You can also have a boost  controller in the megasquirt  I  believe.

E30,2us5nv,MattPro,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"With a swapped head you could definitely make 300 at the crank. Depending on how reliable the tune is (I believe they provide you a safe ""base"" tune then recommend you have it professionally tuned) and if your motor is well maintained (good condition rings/crank/bearings) you can be pretty safe around that output, but it is definitely on the trailing edge of reliability without being built. You will need ARP head studs and have to decide on whether you want to o-ring the head and run a stock gasket or use an MLS head gasket. I haven't looked at the kamotors kit in a long time but I remember them being priced highly for what they are but for many the convenience is worth it. Also, keep in mind you may want to consider upgrading your clutch as the stock was not designed for that kind of power output."

You can't really get the assemblies anywhere other than second hand like here http://www.r3vlimited.com/board/showthread.php?t=300920  Ps. If you're in Canada check out http://www.essexdistributors.com/ for the h&r race Springs and their partner company for bilstein, http://www.bilsteincanada.com/ You'll have to pick each part out but that's not too hard. They are located in Richmond bc and are pretty close to US prices surprisingly, as well as free shipping I believe. I just ordered the same kit from them and am about to do the install soon!"

E30,2uj6jl,mitchmatch1,2,Mon Feb 2 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"Like a glove.  I was reading some of your threads about this car and noticed you changed your mind and decided to put in the s50 instead of building up your m20. What was the main reason you decided to do that?   I'm in a similar boat to the one you were in; I have an e21 with an m20b23 and I'm still not sure which direction I want to go with the engine. A turbo m20 would be the most practical (cheapest) option, but an N/A s50b32 (available here in Aus, just fucking expensive) would be undeniably awesome."
E30,2uj6jl,Helmet_Juice,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"For me, here in the states, it was cheaper to buy an S50 than it was to make a bulletproof m20. Also, I'm glad to be rid of the timing belt and valves that need constant adjustment. All day I spent 4k USD to get this current setup on the road. I would have spent 6k building an M20 and I still would have only had about 225 rwhp. With the modded s50 I have about 275 rwhp."
E30,2uj6jl,Helmet_Juice,2,Tue Feb 3 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. If I were to go the s50 route I'd be paying anywhere from $7-10k just for the engine, which are relatively rare here to begin with. The m20 or even m50 turbo options are a bit more sensible.  Your setup looks awesome though dude! Have fun with it :)"
E30,2uj6jl,brianao34,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:33:12 2015 UTC,I just drove a turbo M50tu setup the other day. I highly recommend it!!  Good luck with you building.
E30,2uj6jl,stabsthedrama,2,Tue Feb 3 00:49:42 2015 UTC,If you put 6k into a turbo M20 you could be making over 500rwhp. Easy.
E30,2uj6jl,brianao34,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly, but you'd still have a timing belt and valves that need regular adjusting. Also, there is no replacement for displacement."
E30,2uj6jl,CHRISpyBaconIsGood,2,Tue Feb 3 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"there is no replacement for displacement.   While I usually agree with this sentiment, a 250hp difference is a replacement.  I still agree with the decision to go with the easier to maintain, higher displacement engine though.  It's what I'll be doing."

E30,2ujk81,FistingMona,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:44:09 2015 UTC,thank you!
E30,2ujk81,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Feb 3 08:10:17 2015 UTC,"That is the most basic E30 you can buy, which in my opinion is good for a first car. It will be slow compared to modern cars, but you must enjoy it for what it is - a clean example of a standard 1980s saloon.  1600 euros seems a lot though. Negotiate the price down a little by saying:   the rubber lip is missing at the bottom of the front valance the rubber intake pipe is perished and needs replacing (this is urgent) there are signs of rust on the rear valance around the towing hook the bottom of both front wings (fenders) have rust at the bottom, and this rust is visible all along the sills. You MUST examine this rust very carefully to see if it has created bubbles/blisters in the metal. all the window winder handles have been broken off. Why???   TO CHECK:   test that the air-conditioning (klimatyzacja?) blows cold. If it doesn't and the seller says ""it just needs new gas"" then don't buy this car: it uses the older R12 gas system which is incompatible with the newer R134a. R12 is banned in the EU. those rear mud flaps are rust traps - look VERY carefully there for signs of rust. remove the front seat covers and check the condition of the seats. I expect they are torn/ripped on the test drive, make sure the engine will turn over 5000RPM, and that it doesn't sound like it will explode. If it has trouble around 4000-5000RPM, or it is making crazy metal noises, then do not buy it - the camshaft is worn and will need replacing.   Overall, this is the simplest, most basic, least desireable E30 that was ever produced. You CANNOT tune/upgrade/improve the engine in this car to make it go faster - this is simply not possible with the M40 engine. But it is a very clean example, so if you take care of it and don't buy stupid lowering springs and stickers for it, you will be able to sell it for a higher price in a year or two. The problems I have mentioned (except the rust/aircon) are very simple to fix using spare parts from ebay/allegro.   And your English is great!"

E30,2ujk81,SoundByte,1 point,Tue Feb 3 08:15:05 2015 UTC,"Hey man, for me the operating words are 'limited budget'... Whenever you get into the Bmer ownership game you gotta realize you will be paying money down the road for all sorts of repairs... On top of that, it's is a 25 year old vehicle so parts will not be cheap man... To give you an example, my first E30 was a 1990 325i which I got for 1,000$ (I'm in Canada).. It was not in great shape but for 1,000$ it was a steal... However my first repairs (strut inserts and tie rod ends) cost me upwards of 600$, most of which was parts and not even labour... My second E30, the one I own now, cost me 4,800$, and for a 25yo car it's in damn good shape (I have a pic up in my post history somewhere if you want to check it out).. But things begin to wear out and break down and I have had to make investments in repairs (right now I'm fighting with a tranny leak)... My point is when you deal with an older vehicle you have to expect yearly maintenance and budget for it accordingly (for me I figure about 1500$ year).. I don't blame ya for wanting to own one of these babies, they are fun to drive, look good and get loads of attention, but they are not easy on the wallet... If you are dead set on owning one now, the most common things I would look for, other than what the other redditor already pointed out, are rust in the wheel wells, just underneath where the fender folds in.. It's a good spot to judge how good or bad the surface rust is... Another common 'hidden' issue you have to be aware of is any electrical glitches... E30s are notorious for electrical problems (I'm not kidding, they can be tempermental)... Look at all your guages, check the warning lights and be sure they work properly (In my first E30 literally every single red light was on and the owner had no clue how to fix them)... Make sure the alternator is working properly and test by turning all lights on, and using any electrical switches at the same time and see how car reacts... Underneath the hood, the duct tape on the air intake boot makes me question how well taken care of the car was and how knowledgeable the current owner is about upkeep (If he threw on tape here what else has he done you don't know about, right?).. Check for rust and cracks around the strut tower mounts (If there are cracks, it's possible water seeped in)... When you test drive, go through all the gears and check how car reacts at higher RPMs (exaclty what the other redditor said)... She may get a 'second wind' around 4,500 on first gear and that's totally normal but other than that anything out of the ordinary is a red flag (transmissions are not cheap to fix bro so be careful)... Look for any and all leaks since these can end up costing you a lot more down the road... Since it's clocked over 200k ask the current owner if he's ever replaced any belts... That's all I can think of off the top of my head... If you are dead set on this one negotiate the price down (1,600 euros is far too much for this car)... I see it as a good car for you to start out on, learn the ropes, start doing your own fixes and eventually invest in something with more vroom down the road... Hope this helps man, if you got any questions pm me...  Edit: your English is awesome, ne ma problema :D"

E30,2ubc5e,rudbri93,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"Then theres a bad connection to the light, which the charging system needs to properly charge the battery."
E30,2ubc5e,rudbri93,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:13:34 2015 UTC,Is there an easy way to trace the wire? I pulled the cluster again today and all the connections to the bulb seems fine. We did have to replace the ring terminal for two blue wires connected to the back of the alternator when I replaced it. Could that have something to do with it?
E30,2ubc5e,Pumacaine,1 point,Sat Jan 31 23:12:06 2015 UTC,If the connectors werent installed properly that could certainly impact the charging abilities of the alternator. find a wiring diagram and follow the wires that lead to the light.

E30,2u8ueb,Grrrmachine,2,Sat Jan 31 08:24:31 2015 UTC,"If a sheared bolt is your only issue, then I would buy this car.  ANY E30 you buy should have another $500 spent on it almost immediately, or you're driving on borrowed time. For the M20 engines (which is an I6, there's no such thing as a V6 E30) this will be the timing belt, water pump and tensioner - even if the PO states they swapped it recently. For an M42 you'll want to swap the tensioner for the M44 unit as soon as you buy it. And any spending on tools is not a cost, it's an investment.  If the current owner states that he's replaced the rear subframe bushes, and there's no visible rust on the car, then those are far more important factors. Mechanicals can be replaced quickly and cheaply - it's the condition of the body shell that is crucial when buying an E30."

I thought that the console cutouts looked similar, so I bought it.   It was close, but not quite a drop-in replacement, so I simply removed the metal surround from the alfa boot, and glued in the plastic base from the E30 boot. You could also easily just cut about a half inch in circumference from the alfa base, and bend it to fit the E30 console.   In any case, it's a huge improvement over the stock vinyl E30 shift boot."

It was missing the alternator and has a power drain somewhere. the drain is still there but i have an alternator on it now. Now lets move onto my third BMW. I bought another e30 last year. a 1985 323i. It had a centre bearing beyond done, so i changed it out, but did something wrong. At the moment its been at the mechanics for 2 months because the mechanic is a lazy drunk who cant be bothered. but my car is in pieces so i guess ill have to get him to finish it up.

None brand new all from craigslist with a few problems. Anyways there are 6 cars and they're all BMW and here I am finally turning 18 and in need of a car. So my dad got me a Ford mustang. Man I was heartbroken but whatever I didn't care about cars all that much. Later that year my dad took me up to the BMW dealership which we have one of the nicest (global imports Atlanta) and I fell in love with BMW. I had to have one it just had to happen. But it wouldnt, not for another year at least. Spring break 2014 and we flew out to California to visit my dad's side of the family. My uncle drove an e30 and it was beautiful. I wanted one just from looking at it. Then we drove in it and basically none of the gauges worked. haha my uncle didn't care he drove it like a madman and I loved every second of it. I told my dad I wanted one and he told me my uncle was trying to sell his. All he wanted was 1500. I never wanted anything more in my life than my uncle's car that was falling apart. But they live in California and we live in Georgia so that was the problem. We flew back no BMW and about a month later my uncle called my dad and told us he scrapped it. Heartbroken I wanted one so I scoured craigslist daily till I found one and we drove about an hour to go and get it. It took 7 months of looking and I found a beautiful red 1987 325i convertible and I loved it. We bought it drove it back home and so far I've been driving it since December :) it's the best car I'll ever own and I don't think I'll try to get other cars.

E30,2tsbsl,beefcakez,3,Tue Jan 27 03:43:13 2015 UTC,"There is no cheap way to convert to 5-lug.  To do it properly, retaining the correct suspension geometry, involves fitting E36 M3 or original E30 M3 parts, together with E36ti or Z3 components. This will run you well over $1000.  You can try using adapters, but these put unnecessary strain on the bearings that lead to premature failure, and are not designed for spirited driving. The only adapters I would ever trust come from Germany, and are $$$, and even these will lead to offset issues with many wheels.  If you are a skilled fabricator you can make up your own bearing sleeve, hub nut and wheel spacer, and machine some E46 brake discs to fit. Even then the stock metal and time will cost you thousands, and if you don't do it perfectly you'll get horrendous wheel judder.  Overall, fitting 5-Lug just for a cosmetic choice of wheel is utterly, utterly pointless. It's far cheaper to find the wheels you want in a 4x100 pattern to start with, without risking mechanical failure or having your car off the road for a month."

E30,2toc9b,WBizarre,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Haha, I went through the same thing. As I was looking for one it was ""damn this e30 bubble!"" And after I bought one it was ""come on, come on, climb!"""
E30,2toc9b,kmartin5104,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:24:44 2015 UTC,Knowing the year and the condition it's tough to say but that's still a bit high for an e30 with rust.
E30,2toc9b,SelfMastered,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"no 3500 isn't fair. i will tell you were to check for rust.   remove the trunk liner and check there (wheel wells, and the spare wheel, as well as the rear licence plate holes.). remove the back seat and lift the sound proofing. look at the seat rails.  check the rear differential and rear subframe, as well as the front control arms.  oh, and check the front wheel wells, as well as the front engine mount rails.  Don't forget the sunroof (if it has one) and the hood.   Edit: words"
E30,2toc9b,RocketJohn5,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:59:57 2015 UTC,Front strut mounts too
E30,2toc9b,joshamania,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:22:19 2015 UTC,You could do worse...but that does seem a bit on the high end.  As to the rust thing...it's an e30.  There's gonna be rust.  Tough call.  If it were me I'd come back at 2500 and see what happens.
E30,2toc9b,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"If there's visible rust, then it's 10% of what the car has. Specifically for this car, run your eye very carefully around the side skirts and rear arches, and look for any signs of rust. Even a hint of orange discoloration will mean a big fat blister under the bodykit.  Since it's an iX, you really need to take it for a drive and listen to it. Any rattles or knocks from under the car will be the transfer case chain failing, or the front driveshaft splines wearing down and slapping about in the front diff. These are verrrrrry expensive repairs.  For general E30 questions:   When was the timing belt and water pump last changed? Have any suspension bushes been replaced during your ownership (especially rear subframe bushes) What oil does it use? (don't ask ""do you change the oil?"" as people just say ""yes"") How old are the tyres, brake rotors and pads?   You need to hear that this car was maintained properly. As always, budget $500 for immediate repairs after you buy it no matter what the owner says, because it's still a 25-year-old car and will have gremlins to deal with."
E30,2toc9b,shaboogabooo,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:46:27 2015 UTC,"$3500 seems like too much for an e30 with no exhaust. That being said, just because the exhaust rusted out doesn't mean the car itself has a rust problem. I'm in MA and the least rusty e30 I've had (out of 3!) had the exhaust rust out while the frame and body were in great shape. Cheap aftermarket exhausts rust quickly too, so maybe he had one of those.   My bigger fear with the car is the reason behind the interior being out in that picture. I've removed mine several times to get to the water trapped under the carpets. E30s can leak from many places.   Check the sunroof area for rust and understand that if has anything substantial, your car probably has a very short life ahead of it... That or you're in for a ton of work.   Being an ix, you'll also want to ""jack test"" it... Google this or search r3vlimited. Basically you're lifting the back wheels to test if the expensive and rare front wheel drive components are in working order.   Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions."
E30,2toc9b,shaboogabooo,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I was just wondering, if it's just missing an exhaust, everything is relatively clean and there really is no rust, how much should I offer? If there is rust should I offer something different, or walk away and find something further south?"
E30,2toc9b,e3027,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:29:50 2015 UTC,"I just bought an '88 ix for $1200, but that had some actual holes in the floor and the owner didn't know anything about the car... I got pretty lucky with the price.   It really depends on what the rust means to you. Is this a car you're going to drive for a couple years or something you want forever? My daily driver has a rusty roof, but I only plan to have it for 3 years or less... so I'm not too worried about it.   The $1200 Ix I just bought has some rust on the floor pans in the front corners and in trunk by the the battery/jack...  basically they rust out from the wheel wells. There is no rust on the frame itself, so I considered the car worth buying. If there is any rust on the frame rails or anything structural, the car is trash. Always ""play up"" the rust though if there is any, it's the easiest way to drive down the price.  Be sure to check for other common ix problems, which you can search forums for... they're a special breed of e30 and BMW didn't make any other models with AWD, so it can be pricey to fix the IX specific parts.   $3500 is definitely within the market for these cars, but at the top end of it. If I were going to pay that much, I'd need a full breakdown of all repairs and proof that it's been taken care of (oil changes, tune ups, etc.). It would also need to have plenty of upgraded parts. It's not worth 3.5K with all of its suspension being 25 years old, and with no proof of a timing belt/water pump change. The tires would have to be good as well. ""Top of the market"" price means to me the only immediate investment I need to put into the car is gas... Obviously stuff with come up a few months down the road, but at $3.5k you should be able to drive it away worry free."
E30,2toc9b,Mostcallmejustin,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"I would check to see that all of the proper maintenance has been performed on the engine, particularly the timing belt. The original owner of my car had the timing belt fail due to an improper service interval very early in the cars life which resulted in bent valves and damaged pistons. It is an $800 job to pay a shop to replace it so I would check to make sure the proper 60,000 mile service interval on the timing belt has been performed. I'm from California so I don't know anything about the potential rust problems."

From wikipedia:  M20B27 The 2693 cc M20B27 was designed for efficiency (thus the e for the Greek letter eta in 325e) and low-rev torque.[21] Compared with the M20B25, the stroke is increased from 75 mm (3.0 in) to 81 mm (3.2 in).[20]  Power output is 164 hp (122 kW) at 4,250 rpm for M20B27 engines produced up until 1987 and 127 hp (95 kW) at 4,800 rpm for the ""325es"" model produced in 1988.[20] Peak torque is 170 lb·ft (230 N·m) at 3,250 rpm for M20B27 engines. In 1987, the fuel injection was upgraded from Motronic 1.0 to Motronic 1.1/1.3.[20]  Applications:  1982–1988 E30 325/325e/325es 1982–1988 E28 525e (or 528e in the US)"

Mine says 325 on the boot lid but 325e on the VIN sticker .. ultimately, doesn't matter. Just a status distinction."

Most E30s are beaten favourites, so they're bound to have their fair share of troubles, especially now that they've aged into classics. It's just one of the tradeoffs of owning one of the greats. Until you can afford to do a complete refresh, just keep on top of the maintenance and be prepared to take it off the road if something fails big-time-styley. It sucks, but it's all part of the experience."

But that's the sound of an old(er) man talking.  In practicalities, if you live in a place with serious snow, you don't want:   a powerful RWD car a car with relatively low ground clearance (especially with fragile body kits) a car with a camping tent for a roof"
E30,2szxqa,Grrrmachine,3,Tue Jan 20 06:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, did you decide you don't need an AWD car?   What exactly are you looking for in a car?  I would recommend against an e46m3 especially due to maintenance costs. People might suggest a 335xi or a 535xi which is in your budget, but my wife's 535xi has all these little annoying issues because of the complexity of the electrical system.  If not dead set on an AWD car, get a new Ford Fiesta ST. You can get a fully loaded one for 25k, it's possibly the best performance car you can get new for under 25k.  Or, if you're dead set on getting a BMW, and you like e30s, get a RWD 325i. The maintenance costs are a lot lower than a e46m3. You can get a really clean e30 for 7-10k, and you have 15k plus to fix whatever you need to fix. Then you can have pretty much a new e30."
E30,2szxqa,daruma3gakoronda,0,Tue Jan 20 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"I did decide that I didn't need an AWD car. Honestly after doing research, I feel a RWD car with premium winter tires is as good as an AWD car with all season tires, especially with sandbags in the trunk. Also everyone in my last thread basically said it would be stupid to get an E30 with a budget like that. When it comes to the ST, I like everything about it except for how tall it is."
E30,2szxqa,daruma3gakoronda,2,Tue Jan 20 02:21:57 2015 UTC,"Then you'll have to either budget for 2 sets of wheels, or you'll have to budget for swapping tires every winter."

E30,2szxqa,Grrrmachine,2,Tue Jan 20 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"If you can afford extra wheels, getting extra wheels is a better deal long term.  If you switch tires every season, then you'll pay 60+ to get the tires remounted every season, plus you'll have to put the extra tires in your car, and drive over to the tire shop, and shlep them back home.  If you buy the wheels, you'll have to pay more because you'll have to buy new wheels (duh), but you'll mount them once and you can swap the wheels out yourself with a jack and a torque wrench.   Snow tires you'll probably want to keep no more than 4-5 years, because rubber degrades."

Any experienced driver will tell you that that there's a night-and-day difference between AWD and RWD-plus-rear-weight.   As for tyres; that's a false argument. All-seasons are shit all year round, and any car with summer/winter tyres will be better than anything running all-seasons. So an AWD car running summer and winter tyres will utterly dominate a RWD car with bags of sand in the back.  I live in Poland. We have some serious winters here, and even on the flat Mazowian Plain BMWs have all sorts of problems, sliding around and getting stuck in ditches. Once you get closer to the mountains the problems are even more obvious, with even new BMWs needing a tow up the slopes from the local tractor. And we have insurance-mandated summer and winter tyres."

E30,2szxqa,FistingMona,0,Tue Jan 20 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"FWD is better than RWD because the extra weight of the engine pushes the front tires to the ground better, right? So sand bags in the back of a RWD car can add the extra weight it needs from my understanding"
E30,2szxqa,youtubefactsbot,5,Tue Jan 20 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, weight has something to do with it. But also, you're pushing the car if it is RWD. FWD will be pulling the car, which is almost always better when traction is low."
E30,2szxqa,Dzdimi14,2,Tue Jan 20 02:44:44 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of moving backwards and forwards. Roads also have these funny things called corners, and when you lose traction to the front wheels a RWD has no way of compensating for that (unless you're particularly experienced). In contrast, a FWD has power and differentials on the steering wheels that help claw it back into the right direction, and AWD has the advantage of both: pushing AND pulling power.  In snowy/icy conditions, RWD really is the worst way of getting round a corner."

VANOS will eventually have issues.   If you get a SMG, it's a question of when it'll fail not if. You can get a 6MT, but you'll have to learn how to drive stick, if you don't already.

E30,2swg6r,rustede30,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"Switched the stock airbag wheel for this newer 3-spoke wheel. Also bought a ZHP M shift knob. I got both for about $100.  They are for my first BMW, a 91 Calypso 318iC. I got it for $1,000 almost two months ago and I'm currently in the process of restoring it to good condition.

E30,2swg6r,rustede30,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:15:25 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the stock (non airbag) wheel to this one.  I just like the little bit thinner grip. What made you switch?
E30,2svz51,rustede30,3,Mon Jan 19 01:36:48 2015 UTC,What's the state of the interior? Does the transfer case still work? I'd say in parts alone you could make quite a bit of bank.
E30,2svz51,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:02:15 2015 UTC,The interior is in good shape except the driver seat is seperating at a seam about two inches long.  Everything on the car works except the oil pressure.  I would really prefer not to part it out to save time/hassle.  That's probably the best way though.  If it were a stick I would just swap the motor and keep it.
E30,2svz51,CaptainTeemoOnBooty,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't think they made automatic IXs, and autos still have potential. Honestly, the best thing you could possibly do is put it up on the cars for sale threads on R3v, or you could part it out if you don't want it collecting dust. I'm sure plenty of people are looking for an IX. Try putting it up for sale around 1500-2000 and see if you get any bites, and if not, be negotiable."
E30,2svz51,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Jan 19 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"Based on your description, this is more of a parts car than a project. The engine would be quicker to solve by swapping in a working M20 of known provenance (with your original sump, of course), but the rust and damage around the rest of the body shell severely reduces the price.  Fortunately for you, the iX shell is so specific that you can't just swap the drivetrain to a standard E30, so even in its crusty condition it still has value. Based on that, I'd list it for $2000 and be happy to get $1500 for it. However, it might take a while to sell, especially at this time of year."

E30,2suweu,Dzdimi14,4,Sun Jan 18 21:28:20 2015 UTC,Eh. Good enough.
E30,2suweu,FeistyMonkey,6,Sun Jan 18 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"No E30 came with airbags, plural. The late 1990/1991 E30's came with a standard single steering wheel airbag. Nowadays, it is probably more safe removing it. 25 year old airbags aren't the best to be driving around with.   With that being said, E30s are generally pretty safe cars due to their strong boxy frame."
E30,2suweu,Grrrmachine,4,Sun Jan 18 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"Theoretically it's a safe car; there's ample crumple zones and very strong roof pillars. But the single airbag (if the car has it) is more likely to add concussion and chemical burns to your injuries. Not all cars had ABS, none had traction control, and being light and RWD means the back end will kick out quickly if you don't know what you're doing.  Each E30 also has to be treated on a case by case basis. 25-year-old spot welds, rust and unknown repairs can severely compromise the structural integrity.   All in all, it was a great car compared to the other vehicles on the road in the 80s. Now, when it shares the road with SUVs, massive pick-up trucks and Mom's minivan, it's guaranteed to come off worse in any sort of collision you can imagine. It's not a death trap, but it's not safe in any way compared to modern vehicles."
E30,2suweu,kpcnsk,3,Mon Jan 19 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"The point about the other vehicles on the road is important when evaluating the safety of the e30 platform.   Also, it's worth mentioning that the structural integrity isn't the only thing that affects the safety. The entire seatbelt system (webbing, lock mechanisms, latches, attachment points) may all be compromised given the age and of these vehicles, and the particular ownership history of each car."
E30,2suweu,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Jan 19 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"Fully agree, especially in the back. The mounting holes for the seat belt clips are exposed underneath the car, and are a common corrosion point. In a fast collision with a fat passenger, I wouldn't be surprised if the force was enough to tear the seat belt clip straight out of the floorpan.  That also goes for the mounting bolts for the front seats, but since the holes are only on the front of the rails (the back has studs) it's a lower risk that you'll be launched through the windshield."
E30,2suweu,protomor,4,Mon Jan 19 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"90/91 models came standard with airbags. I personally rolled mine going about 50mph. The roof only dented in about an inch. I walked away with a bloody eyebrow and that's it. My first E30 protected me so well, I was very fine buying several more since then."
E30,2suweu,Bipin93,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"I believe it was only late 1990 E30s that came with airbags, but yes. Mine is a '90 and it has no airbags and the chrome window trim, so there must be a specific month when it changed."
E30,2suweu,shedby_budwin,2,Sun Jan 18 21:26:07 2015 UTC,Perhaps a previous owner changed it to a non airbag wheel.

E30,2soo4k,SelfMastered,5,Sat Jan 17 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"Others have identified that this is drivetrain noise rather than an engine noise. What you should now do is jack up the front end and spin the wheels by hand. Feel for any resistance or jerking that may be the source of this noise. If you find nothing, drop the front and lift the back in neutral, and repeat the process. Get a friend to spin the wheels for you if necessary while you get your head under the car.  Someone stated driveshaft bearing, but if that were loose or broken you've have a horrendous banging noise rather than that tick. I'd expect something more innocuous, like some wire wrapped around the shaft, or a nail in a tyre, or the brake dust shield bent and rubbing on the rotor."
E30,2soo4k,Grrrmachine,1 point,Sat Jan 17 08:22:31 2015 UTC,"how would a nail get in a tyre? also i did change the tophat washer for the brake dust shield on my rear right wheel when i did the brakes, and adjusted the handbrake shoes (which it seems i did incorrectly cause now the hand break won't even stop the car)."

E30,2soo4k,ocell,2,Sat Jan 17 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"Does it change with the RPM of the engine? That's different from changing with speed.  Listening to your sound file: It sounds like the ticking changes with the speed of the car, but does not follow the speed of the engine. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Makes me think it's the center support bearing for the drive shaft (drive shaft changes rotation speed directly with your car's speed) and not lifter tick (that would change with engine speed only, and would keep happening when the car is stopped.)"

E30,2soo4k,perfecttttt,3,Sat Jan 17 00:28:38 2015 UTC,Ok. Check the center support bearing and the guibo on the drive shaft. The noise is probably the drive shaft hitting the tunnel.
E30,2soo4k,perfecttttt,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:33:02 2015 UTC,"ok, but wouldn't it sound louder? also, i did do one things recently.

E30,2soo4k,ToastitoTheBandito,-1,Sat Jan 17 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be road speed-related if it was the driveshaft, because it would slow every time he upshifted."

E30,2so62f,Chinampa,1 point,Sat Jan 17 06:53:55 2015 UTC,"Once you lower the back end of an E30 past 30mm (so 1.25"") you really start messing up the tyre geometry, so it's best to keep it there unless you like buying new tyres regularly.  As for rust protection: spray cavity wax everywhere you can get, keep the car clean and wash out the wheel arches as often as you can."
E30,2sky6j,jedfilmsstudios,14,Fri Jan 16 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"I would advise you not to buy an E30 for these reasons:   You live in a cold weather climate where it snows. Rust is one of the biggest problems with E30s. Snow and E30s don't mix well. With a budget of $24,000, surprising for a 15 year old, why buy a rust-prone E30 when you can buy a much newer car? When I say newer I don't mean a 4-5 year old car. I mean a late 90's early 2000's car. Newer cars come with a myriad of improvements ranging from safety to performance   If you want an AWD car good in the snow, what about an 05-07 Subaru Impreza WRX or STI? If you want a nice project car, what about a turbocharged 98 Volvo S70 or V70? What about a GTI? There are so many great options with that budget.   Don't get me wrong, E30s are awesome classic cars. Given your situation, I just wouldn't get one."
E30,2sky6j,FeistyMonkey,3,Fri Jan 16 05:04:15 2015 UTC,"I second this completely. I'm in my twenties and I own an e30 but I also have another car that is my daily as well. When working on a 20 year old car you're going to hit problems when you work it, nothing on an e30 happens first try. With limited knowledge I would recommend something newer where you can learn basic maintenance on, brakes, oil, coolant etc. The drive and desire you have to be a gear head is phenomenal, buy a good used car and save the rest of the money and a few years down the road get a good shape e30 and go crazy."

The volvo's are kind of ugly, as are the golfs. Honestly I'm looking deep into a 2015 Mustang Ecoboost (a little over budget), but rather than a new car I want to see what my options are for a hobby car. E30's are iconic hobby cars. They are easily modable and cheap and come in 4 wheel drive which is why I made a post about them. Thanks"
E30,2sky6j,DeepMidWicket,3,Fri Jan 16 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"The problem your going to have with any car of the e30 era is the rust seeing your in a snowy area, so prepare your self for body work.   The other thing I haven't seen mentioned, E30's are a bmw, bmw are a prestige automobile, the parts for them are still the same cost as when they where new but now they can be much harder to find.  As for your budget, if for what ever reason the money is solely for the purchase of the car for the love of God don't spend that much on an e30, I have resantly restored one that was in okish condition 4k to buy it and I'm in for about 14k all up and now it's mint, this gives you an idea on budget.

E30,2sky6j,Grrrmachine,5,Tue Jan 27 02:31:53 2015 UTC,"/u/FeistyMonkey has given you the most prudent advice in this thread. With such a large budget, such limited experience, the rareity of the 325iX and how old these cars are, this isn't the best choice you could make. Only 15,000 of these cars were ever made, and the youngest ones are already 23 years old. The iX also has a hundred parts that are exclusive to that model, so finding spares (even simple things like wheels) becomes a real chore.  They are lovely cars to run and the M20 engine is a smooth, reliable engine, but it feels underpowered in the iX version and upgrades/mods are NOT easy or cheap. There are a myriad bunkum and snakeoil products online to ""improve"" the M20 engine, but the only real ways to increase performance are a combination of intake-cam-exhaust, forced induction, or increased displacement. These all cost serious cash.   Ultimately you could spend $24k and end up with a lovely iX, but you'll always get asked why you didn't buy an Impreza or Quattro instead and you won't have a real reason why, since Audi's and Subaru's AWD systems are far superior to BMW's agricultural design.   On top of all this, any ""learning"" you do on an E30, while fun, is ultimately trivial compared to modern vehicles. These are cars built in a completely different era (the design is from 1982), so the things you learn won't apply to newer, computer-controlled cars. Yes, it makes the E30 very simple to work on, but you can quickly reach the limits of what you can do due to how primitive the design is compared to today's cars.  I strongly encourage anyone to get their hands dirty, and an E30 is a great place to start, but for what you want and with the money you have, you could have so much more than a rusty old German saloon."

If you're going to buy an old clunker you will encounter most common problems. If you don't know when the timing belt was done (assuming m40) that is the first move. water pump while you're at it. But i haven't done those, so i cant explain the difficulty. Honestly i reckon you should definitely go for one. But that is just my opinion. In the end its entirely up to you. These guys here are/will be more than happy to give you advice/guidance if you get stuck."
E30,2sky6j,Dzdimi14,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, right now my understanding of engines is limited, but to get it 'running like new', would I have to replace the timing belt, spark plugs, clean out the engine with pipe cleaners and other stuff like that? Thanks for your help btw, and do you maybe have an estimate for how much it would cost to get one 'running like new' before there are any mods?"
E30,2sky6j,Reysup,4,Fri Jan 16 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"Running like new would basically mean pulling the engine out and doing a whole bottom end rebuild. With limited knowledge its hard but it is also easy to learn (haynes manual is a must). You have to remember its a 25+ old engine. all you need really is to do is what you stated, keep the oil changes up and you wont have a problem. it wont be running as new because its old. but all you need to do is keep her running. she doesnt need to be running as new Its an old car. you will have problems that develop. These engines are a stock horse. they are basically impossible to kill. My first e30 i got from my brother, he didnt change the oil once in 3 years, didnt even top up the radiator. the engine still ran when i got it. It wasnt pretty but it ran. The key to keeping her running is maintenance, good scheduled maintenance and she will run for as long as you want her to."
E30,2sky6j,CamptownRobot,1 point,Fri Jan 16 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"Solid. Another question: Given a $24.5k budget in this day and age, would you even go near an E30 or would you go for something else? I'm thinking sporty and AWD, with 4 seats."
E30,2sky6j,Reysup,3,Fri Jan 16 02:57:05 2015 UTC,I am head over heals in love with e30s but 24k would almost get you an m3.  If you want a very clean e30 (im not sure on american prices so bare with me here) id say probably 15-20k. That would get you a very clean stock e30 here in australia. Probably cheaper in the U.S.

E30,2sky6j,lastvegas,0,Fri Jan 16 03:54:56 2015 UTC,Your budget should be no where near 24k for a e30. You could easily get a really clean one for 7k. Thats 17k on mods or a daily car or both!
E30,2sky6j,shedby_budwin,2,Fri Jan 16 08:35:05 2015 UTC,"I would not get one, but for a different reason than most in this thread. If you do not have much experience working on cars, you might find out that you hate it. You might like it too, but there are cheaper ways of finding out than buying a 30 year old BMW.  I would do some basic maintenance (like an oil change) on your parents cars first to see you like it. You get experience, and your parents save money. If you like it and want to challenge yourself and learn more, then by all means go for it. If it turns out that it is frustrating and miserable, then you can get a newer used car and save yourself a potential headache."

I bought a clean one two years ago for about 3k after scouring craigslist every day for 5-6 months. As soon as I got it home, did timing belt, water pump, accesory belts, spark plugs, coolant flush and an oil change. It took me a couple weeks of working on&off and because I encountered a lot of stripped hardware, but I got it done.  Since then, I've put a 5speed in, new seats, amp and stereo with sub, springs, shocks, and brakes. The only thing I had a shop do was essentially the 5speed swap. It's a really rewarding car!"
E30,2sky6j,I_Am_Genesis,1 point,Fri Jan 16 09:12:49 2015 UTC,"I bought an 84 318i for my first car. Within 2 weeks I spent 3k on it just to keep it running. Timing chain snapped, oil pan broke, head gasket leaked, intake system was messed up, new tires, wheels, had to replace the interior (seats), radiator blew, brakes seized, went through 2 exhaust systems....   Point is, no matter what the previous owner says was done to it, you won't know until you have it..  The money I spent on that car could have been used as an insane down payment on a newer car, or a house for that matter, or I could have bought my girlfriend an engagement ring...    No I spent it on the car. Granted I miss my car and how easy it was to work on. I don't miss having to drive around with my trunk full of tools because my car was unpredictable in terms of something breaking. You will blow through your money faster than you think. Buy a car that is more reliable...   You have more than enough money to buy a cheap e30 as a secondary car and buy another to use as a daily while you work on the e30. Just don't make the e30 your daily. I was left without a car for a straight week because my car broke down and I had no way of working on it... I finally bought a 2011 GTI and haven't looked back."

E30,2sj9z5,Tii741,3,Thu Jan 15 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"ESM 002R owner here, aka the BBS RS replica wheel. It is very cheap. I got a full set of 4 for less than $450 brand new. I put them on my 1972 2002 tii. For a replica, they've been great. They look good, but they're pretty heavy and I'm not sure about long-term reliability. There's lots of examples of replica wheels bending/cracking from pot holes much easier than real or OEM wheels would.  I've put less than 1k miles on them due to current restoration. About 6 months after I got them, I got OEM Style 5s (just like the RS minus interchangeable lips) for my E28. After seeing real RS-type wheels, I really don't like my ESMs as much anymore. The fake mounting hardware for the fake lips just kill me inside.  I wish I saved a few more months and got real wheels. Don't make my mistake. But for cheap wheels they're fine."
E30,2sj9z5,Chinampa,2,Thu Jan 15 21:40:57 2015 UTC,Yeah the fake bolts make them look really cheap. I wish someone would make rs-styled wheels without fake bolts/ fake 3-piece and in a variety of sizes

The ad doesn't say it's rust free, so look. don't feel bad asking to peel back carpet or look in the battery tray in the trunk.

E30,2sgxdw,daruma3gakoronda,1 point,Thu Jan 15 05:19:24 2015 UTC,The fact that its smogged is apparently a big deal in The Peoples Republic of California   The seller cannot legally sell the car unless it has passed smog within 90(?) days.
E30,2sgxdw,joshamania,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:13:58 2015 UTC,Idk about that but I do know that the buyer has to have the car re-smogged upon purchase unless it has been smogged in the last 50 days.
E30,2sgxdw,daruma3gakoronda,2,Fri Jan 16 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"That is wrong information.   THE SELLER has to smog the car. It's never the responsibility of the buyer.  from: http://dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/vr/smogfaq#BM2537  When a car is sold, who is responsible for the inspection?  The seller is required to provide the buyer with a valid smog inspection certification at the time of the sale or transfer. Smog certifications are good for 90 days from the date of issuance.  The inspection is not required on a transfer if a biennial smog certification was submitted to DMV within 90 days prior to the vehicle transfer date (a vehicle inspection report may be required for proof of certification).  NOTE: Smog certifications are not required for transfers that occur for a gasoline powered motor vehicle that is four or less model years old. (Determine the oldest-qualifying year model by subtracting three from the current year) the four or less model years old rule does not apply to diesel powered vehicles. A smog transfer fee will be collected from the new owner.  Personal thoughts:  If you're buying a car that wasn't smogged in the last 90 days, you can negotiate that into the sale.   OR  If you buy a car from someone and they didn't smog it and it fails smog, the law is on your side, and while you'd probably have to sue them, you can make them take the vehicle back and return your money."

Unfortunately, no e30 is.  from the dmv site:  Does my vehicle qualify for a smog exemption?  Smog inspections are required unless your vehicle is:  Hybrid  Gasoline powered 1975 year model or older  Diesel powered 1997 year model and older or with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating (GVWR) of more than 14,000 lbs  Electric  Natural gas powered with a GVWR rating of more than 14,000 lbs.

When I bought my current car this summer I bought it with intentions of completely building it, and everything besides the gas tank and outer body panels have been removed and replaced at some point. Full interior, drivetrain, entire suspension. Just like with bodywork, not many people have the desire to completely tear a car apart.

Fixing this car gives me that created outlet I need but don't get at my 9-5.  I honestly thought I would be further along than I am but...whatever. Why stress?  This isn't some silly race.  This is a hobby...and when it is done, who else will have a car that looks this good? (That was the day after I bought it on Ebay in Louisville, KY,  May 2013.  The following day my brother and I drove it back home to FL.  800 miles in a car bought over the internet.  Good times...my brother probably disagrees, but I enjoyed our trip.)"

However it punched a hole in the head so bought a low milage head off eBay.   I am really just looking to have a bit of fun with it, so low boost application. I will likely set the cap between 6 and 8 psi. I am going to be running a new oem head gasket, but got new arp head studs, water pump, t-belt tensioner, and thermostat, to prep the car a good bit.   I am looking to do everything the right way the first time though so I will be doing stand alone management, however I don't really care to spend $1000+ on the turbo itself.

E30,2sc4r5,carnvalOFoz,1 point,Wed Jan 14 04:43:30 2015 UTC,"If you're going to stay with the stock head gasket I would highly recommend ""o-ringing"" the block. Without doing that the stock head gasket can be sketchy even with studs.   I ran the H1C @ 12psi on my stock motor with ARP studs and an MLS head gasket. It's a little bit bigger of a turbo but there's a lot of potential in it. If you're looking to stay around 8psi you should definitely consider a turbo on the smaller side though.   But good choice with going full EMS, it really makes the whole job a lot easier and safer."
E30,2sc4r5,nakdamink,1 point,Wed Jan 14 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"I may consider o-ringing the block actually. Initially I was thinking about o-ringing the head, but was warned my a mechanic that if my head warped it would be really difficult to redo the grooves and resurface. My only issue is getting it to a shop that can do it to be honest. Do most shops require you to remove the block and bring it in or could I get my car towed to a shop with the block in to have it done?  If I got it o-ringed though I would definitely go with a bigger turbo though, because why not you know? I just want to have that security before going bigger."
E30,2sc4r5,Thelazywaffleman,1 point,Wed Jan 14 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, I've never inquired. The only potential issue I can see is that the o-ring tool might not fit on the back cylinder if the block is in the car. Besides that o-ringing the block isn't that difficult of a job to do in car. If you feel confident you can rent the tool yourself as well.  Also, you may want to consider an MLS gasket. It is more expensive, but if you do the job right you shouldn't ever have to replace it. I did have a slight oil leak from the front passenger corner of the engine, however besides that I had no issues and was happy with mine."

E30,2s0xow,Grrrmachine,2,Sun Jan 11 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"I don't want to piss on your cornflakes, but this mod is senseless. The Motronic 1.3 that manages your fueling has no way of knowing how much fuel it's injecting in, so increasing the flow rate is just going to lead to rich running and coked-up spark plugs - or bore wash if the injectors have a significantly higher flow.  Yes, they might spray better if the original injectors haven't been rebuilt or cleaned in the last 25+ years, but the cost and time of fitting wrong injectors, compared to cleaning up the right ones, makes this mod pointless.  Where did you get the idea that this was a good thing to do to your car?"
E30,2s0xow,13515m0r3,1 point,Sun Jan 11 08:26:34 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/gYx18Bl.jpg  So if you look at my dyno, MY car (I can't speak for other people's cars), is running really lean from 15 to 14 air/fuel ratio where it should be around 11.   The fact that the Motronic 1.3 does know what it's injecting is why it doesn't correct the lean problem in the first place. Putting a marginally higher flowing injector, in my case, would help with the lean problem. By what I researched it should a 6.6% increase in flow.  Now on the second point. As you can see on the pictures, the e30 injectors have a single point to inject as opposed to the e36 injectors that have 4 points. This gives the engine a finer and more consistent fuel mist/spray and better atomization. The cost? $0. They were given to me by a friend. The time? I spent an hour maybe an hour and a half. The power delivery seems a lot smother than it was the last time I did that track.  I will admit, I I'm not claiming the car made huge power gains just that the power delivery and engine operating seemed smoother than before. I won't know anything for sure until I dyno it again which I plan to do again in the near future.  Edit: I rather have the car run a little rich then how lean it was running."
E30,2s0xow,13515m0r3,0,Sun Jan 11 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"I do concede that the mist spray will in theory be better, but you're still comparing 25 year old worn injectors to 15-20yo ones. Furthermore the Motronic 1.3, without a live remap on a dyno, will be unable to benefit from better-misting injectors, so you'll simply be flooding the cylinder.   In your case, the power delivery may be smoother simply because the E36 injectors were not as gunked up as the originals. However, you'll probably find an equivalent gain, or even improvement, by having the originals refurbed.  My point here is simply to dispel the myth that bigger-flow injectors are a cheap and easy performance boost. In many cases (particularly yours) there is a noticeable gain simply because the original parts were underperforming, but all you're doing is masking a flaw with a band-aid.   If it's a track slag and the cost was $0, then fair play to you, but I'd hate to see people ruin good engines with bore wash and rich running just because they slapped some Mustang injectors in."
E30,2s0xow,Reysup,2,Sun Jan 11 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, a real test would compare new e30 injectors with new 36 ones otherwise I'm guessing and using my butt dyno (and let's be honest it's probably not that accurate).  I also agree that the 19lbs injectors seem too big for a stock setup with no tuning. Around 25% fuel increase with no turning sounds no bueno."

To the point that my dad driving it asked what I did to it without any knowledge that I modded it. I also swear they're a little quieter and idle smoother. Those could be more of placebo effects I'm not sure. Another note: my original injectors were rebuilt a few months earlier so they were fresh.  I got them so if I choose to do other things to the engine they won't be the limiter in AFR. If I don't, they still eke out a mpg or so more due to spray pattern (after 1000 mi average) which is great as well."

Looks like a cheap, fun, & rwd car ;)   In the states, I wouldn't pay more than $2k USD, if that, but you guys in Kiwi-land pay exorbitant prices for e30's, it seems. Anyway, my initial thoughts:  The pictures don't show anything really useful. Yeah, it may look good from 15 feet away, but it might look like complete crap up close. Anyway. . . .   Looks pretty straight, save for that bend in the drivers' front door. Looks like it may be an issue with the door hinge causing the door to sag and catch on the fender when it's opened. Ugh. Anyway, do a thorough inspection for rust in the battery box in the trunk as well as at the jacking points at the front of the passenger area.   Interior is okay. Passenger seat is crap though, but the dash seems to only have that one crack. Look at this closely as these are prone to crack and a new BMW one will run you close to $800 USD or more. You can find a used crack-free one for a few hundred online on occasion.   Things to ask the owner:  When was the last timing belt change? Water pump replacement? Oil service history? When was the clutch last replaced?   If the timing belt isn't recent and the owner doesn't have proof of it being changed in that time, change it ASAP. These are interference motors so it that thing breaks, you're going to have to most likely replace the head, if not pistons as well.   Gearbox issues? Slipping? The Getrag260 is nearly bulletproof though and you can find a working one in a junkyard fairly easily (at least in the states).   As for things to look for:  These cars are notorious for electrical gremlins. Relays and switches go bad all the time and often times diagnosis is, lets say, troubling, sometimes. I've replaced tons of unnecessary things in efforts to pinpoint the true issue.   Rust, of course. Battery box, footwells, and at jacking points, etc.   I'm at work and really busy right now, but I'll try to come back and write anything I feel others have forgotten. Best of luck."

E30s rust in a few very predictable areas: * Floor pan corners - there are squares of metal here used by the factory robots to move the shell around. People think these are jacking points, so they use them. This damages all the sealant, and leads to rust * Bulkhead - the area under the windscreen is a Toblerone-shape void made of three metal layers. The seam sealant here dries out over time and shrinks, leading to gaps that let water in. This is made worse by a blocked drainage tube in the engine bay * Sunroof cassette tray - impossible to seal from the factory due to construction technique. Any rust here will eat through the roof skin and make the whole car worthless    All the other rust spots (and there are many) are caused by simple road wear: winter salt, stone chips, lack of regular washing and waxing, leading to bare metal and rust. If people are cheap they try to fix the underseal with bitumen-based substances, but this just makes things worse as it traps the existing moisture in."

As for the repairs:   Reverse light - check the bulb?  Flasher relay may have gone bad - replace Gear shifter sloppy - replace the rubber bushings with oem rubber or maybe delrin. Shifting into 2nd might mean your transmission synchro is bad. Might be simplest to get a working tranny. ..  Engine idles high - sounds like a vacuum leak - do a smoke test to see leakage  Valve adjustment on e30's is a regular mainteanance item - Use the Bentley manual for directions Timing belt - REPLACE THIS ASAP I'd replace water pump at the same time since it's right there - see Bentley manual A/C issues could be anything. Bad O-rings, bad compressor, etc.  Drivers seat loose - dunno. Never heard of this before. Remove seat and look at it, I guess.  Rust - if you want it completely gone, cut it out and weld in new metal. Paint.  Wipers - new blades?  Leaks - car is 30 years old. It will leak until you replace all the rubber everywhere.  Bushings - need new rubber Diff seal leak - new cover seal. Need to inspect the hub seals and replace if necessary.  Control arm bushings - press in new ones - easy Wheel bearing - will take a while, but it can be done. Need some tools to do it though.  No antifreeze?? - WHAT THE F&$K? I'd be skeptical as heck about this. Could have a blown gasket or maybe a warped or cracked head as a result.    It's not worth $6900 in my opinion. Maybe half that based on that assessment.   If you do buy this, immediately buy the Bentley repair manual and look over at r3vlimited.com, e30tech.com, and bimmerforums.com for how-to's. Everything that's wrong with this one has been repaired before and someone has most likely documented it."
E30,2rpwwe,beefcakez,2,Thu Jan 8 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the comprehensive list. I found this manual, but it doesn't cover the 320i engine.

I plan on using this as my daily driver as soon as possible, and will keep fixing the little things as time/money permit.   I'll be paying ~US$4,500, which I think is a pretty fair price in NZ"
E30,2rpwwe,beefcakez,2,Thu Jan 8 08:35:24 2015 UTC,"No problem. I hope it helps.   It should cover the engine. The 320i is still a straight 6 M20. Just that it's 2.0L rather than 2.3, 2.5, or 2.7L found in the other models.   Everything else should be the same, save for some trim, I think.   As for the repairs, the timing belt and water pump are definitely needed ASAP. Hopefully that fixes the missing coolant too.   I'd make sure to inspect the steering stuff. If the bushings are bad, replace them. Steering is essential to make sure you stay on the road and stay alive. That being said, don't cheap out on these parts. Best to get Lemfoerder or Meyle parts, or even oem BMW. I use aftermarket on other stuff though. Anyway, the e30 is known for its suspension. It will be much more enjoyable if this is restored.   Behind that, I'd repair the idle issue. The intake boot is probably the culprit. These crack as they age. A nice silicone one would last longer, but is substantially more expensive. There are some other rubber hoses there and it would be best to replace them as well.   Everything else can be replaced as you want, IMO.   Dang, I didn't realize NZ.

E30,2rpwwe,Grrrmachine,2,Fri Jan 9 04:57:31 2015 UTC,"/u/beefcakez has done an excellent job of highlighting the faults of these cars. To fill in the gaps:   Reverse light may also be corrosion or breakage of the wire running from the reverse light switch in the gearbox High idle may be an air leak or the coolant temp sensor. Unfortunately this engine swap is the hateful Jetronic version which also includes a troublesome (and expensive) air slide valve. Driver's seat is either the common loose screw, or the more common sheared bracket caused by no-one tightening the common loose screw. A simple screwdriver or welding job to fix. Leaks - if it leaks from the sunroof area, run from this car as fast as you can. If it's just in the boot, it'll be the rear light seals or rust in the rear inner arches. All the other niggles are the usual things that happen when people spend their money on flashy wheels instead of regular maintenance. Fortunately, it won't hurt your wallet much to fix it.   As for the value of the car:   The respray may be a very high standard or a cheap blowover. If you view this, check for cellulite/orange peel in the paint and blowover on the rubber trims. Unfortunately the engine bay hasn't been painted, which does suggest this was a quick, cheap and low-quality job, backed up by the report you got. There's rust in lots of different places. Why wasn't this dealt with when the car was repainted? If that much is visible on the outside, there will be lots more lurking in other places (such as under the carpet). Swapping a 1.8 motor for a 2.0 is madness. They have the same power but the 2.0 uses significantly more fuel. The 6-cylinder is a lovely cruising motor, but it will feel very underpowered very quickly, especially since this is the shittest (KE-Jetronic) version with mechanical distributor, miles of vaccuum pipes and a neolithic injection system. Those 17 inchs rims are cheap heavy shit that will buckle quickly. Ask if you can get the car for a lower price without that gaudy tat You will need a new set of rear tyres. The current worns are heavily worn, most likely from driving oversized wheels on collapsed, sorry, lowered suspension. The exhaust work is utterly redundant, and completely for show. There is no way to squeeze any more power out of an M20B20 engine; many have tried, all have failed. Find out what lowering kit was used, and whether the car has retained its original 45mm front struts or whether they were switched for the 51mm versions. If they're still 45's, then other corners have been cut doing this conversion, which is a warning sign.   Overall, these cars are great for learning mechanicals on and very charming to drive. This particular one is a bit Marmite (vegemite to you) in that you love it or hate it. I'm in the latter category, but I can understand why others would be seduced by it, despite the lengthy list of required repairs. The 2.0 engine was never sold in the US so American forums don't often have much info on it, but the E30Zone is a good source of info, especially for the issues specific to right-hand drive cars."
E30,2rpwwe,offixial,1 point,Thu Jan 8 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"If the high idle is caused by either of those things, could it be a gateway for a huge problem if it doesn't get fixed immediately? If so, do you think it would it be relatively simple to fix (for a beginner)?  The seller has assured me that none of the rust is structural and hasn't been brought up by any mechanics when being serviced. Also, according to my knowledge, the lowering was done by a professional mechanic, so one would assume (or at least hope!) that no corners were cut...   Thanks heaps for your advice! I really like Marmite."
E30,2rpwwe,offixial,1 point,Fri Jan 9 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"Point by point:   High idle means increased fuel consumption and possible rich running, leading to coked-up spark plugs, increased oil deposits and increased general wear and tear on the engine. It could be a simple fix, but if it is the air slide valve it will be a very expensive one because they're no longer available new. It doesn't matter if rust is structural or not; it's there, and it doesn't go away or stop rusting. The only solution to rust is to cut it out, weld in fresh metal and repaint it. And once you start the rust hunt, you will find a LOT more lurking. Rust is the biggest possible reason not to buy this car. Lowering is not a difficult thing to do; often it's just bolt-on components. The trouble is that the E30 has a suspension setup at the rear that is not sympathetic to lowering, resulting in bad suspension geometry. If you don't know what that means, then don't buy this car."

E30,2rovs4,protomor,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"The best option is to remove the cancer completely via cutting and welding in new metal. This is the route I'm taking. I've found rust in my passenger footwell so once I'm done with the engine bay smoothing, I'll tackle that next, then the battery box.   You can wire wheel it and use some sort of rust converter like /u/protomor suggested/linked. That will be a good fix for the time being."
E30,2rovs4,beefcakez,2,Thu Jan 8 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"cut and weld is a last resort. If the metal isn't structural and it's just surface rust, you'll be fine with just a wire wheel. It you can snag fingers in pits after you wire wheel, yea, might want to weld in a patch."

If you have some idea about mechanical things then check it top to bottom, try and get a list of parts he used (as the swap can be done a few different ways). If it looks OK, take it for a drive, if it drives well then the last thing I would do is a compression test. As long as they are within ~10% of each other (I don't know the specific psi it should get) then the engine is in good shape, anything up to 20% between cylinders is not a huge issue, just means the engine is of moderate age and mileage.  good luck :)"

E30,2rlnwo,I_AM_MartyMcfly_AMA,2,Wed Jan 7 05:45:07 2015 UTC,"To address these issues sequentially:  a) Yes, the rocker arms between the the 325e and 325i are compatible. There's no problem there. b) When you fitted the head and replaced the timing belt, did you turn it four times by hand to confirm you had everything timed correctly? c) What do you mean by ""not turning on""? No electrics whatsoever? No engine cranking? No engine firing? d) When you replaced the head, what did you do about engine management? Are you still trying to run the original 325es ECU, or did you also swap over the injectors, harness and CPS sensor?"
E30,2rlnwo,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jan 7 06:48:30 2015 UTC,"b) I didn't replace the belt I just left it were it was at. I did not turn it four times  c) electronics turn on, the engine cranks, fuel pump and what not works but it just doesn't turn on  d) nothing at all I just straight replaced the head, took off the old e heads and put the I heads on with the switched e rocker arm, I am still using the 325es ecu, I didn't want to get the 325i ecu, harness and everything else because I don't know how to switch that stuff."
E30,2rlnwo,Grrrmachine,3,Wed Jan 7 07:00:51 2015 UTC,"b) not replacing the belt is really asking for trouble. They're not designed to be re-used, and if they break you'll destroy another head.  d) without the 325i ECU this will not run. The cam timing will be completely wrong for the engine management, and your compression is significantly lower."
E30,2rlnwo,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jan 7 07:10:21 2015 UTC,b) well I'll definitely change the belt tomorrow.   d) so it will absolutely not run without the 325 ecu? If so does it have to be from the same year as the heads.
E30,2rlnwo,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Jan 7 07:14:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be the same year, but ideally you want 1988 or newer (Motronic 1.3). You'll need the ECU, the engine wiring harness, injectors, crank sensor and toothed trigger wheel and AFM. The throttle body and intake manifold would also make sense, or you're strangling your engine.

E30,2rlnwo,protomor,1 point,Wed Jan 7 09:31:49 2015 UTC,Chances are your alternator belt will also be a different size. The smooth harmonic balancer has a different sized pully than the toothed balancer.
E30,2rlnwo,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:42:53 2015 UTC,Wait wait wait... were there not some early 325i cars that used the flywheel style cps? Couldnt he just get that ecu to avoid having to get a different harmonic balancer + CPS?  If he gets a different harmonic balancer then his alternator/fan belt will be the wrong size.
E30,2rlnwo,protomor,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt risk it. The early 325i was high compression (8.8:1), the 325e was lower and this ""hybrid"" will be even lower still, so the fuel maps will be all wrong."
E30,2rlnwo,wapner,2,Thu Jan 8 10:58:02 2015 UTC,"Judging by other comments made, you left the bottom end where it was, just slapped the new head on, put the belt on, and cranked the car? Did you make an attempt to align the belt in any form or fashion before you cranked the car over? You've likely just killed your head and maybe pistons."
E30,2rlazx,tokeonthis,4,Wed Jan 7 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"17s on an E30 severely compromise the suspension characteristics, because the tyre wall is a critical suspension component. By moving from 15"" to 17"" you need to keep the same rolling radius, which means losing a hell of a lot of your sidewall to compensate.  On top of that, anything over 9J wide will a) run a very high risk of rubbing on either the inner wing or against the suspension struts, depending on wheel offset, and b) tramline horrifically, making the car a really unpleasant drive.  There's a very good reason Alpina, Hartge and Racing Dynamics only made wheels up to 16""."

E30,2rhrw4,joshamania,2,Thu Jan 8 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"so where do I find gaskets that will fit?    The clue is the blue-and-white badge on the front of the car. While you're there, pick up new manifold studs and nuts as well; it's 99% guaranteed that one will break when you replace the gasket, so it's best to swap them all over now if you have the tools and time to do so.  As for your speedometer; this is most likely corrosion of the wires to the speed sensor in the differential. The fix is to get any compatible plug from a scrapyard car (E36 headlight plugs are a good source) along with 6 inches of wire. Cut the old plug off, solder the new wires on, plug it in and hey presto! A working speedo."

E30,2rf7gz,Vythix,4,Mon Jan 5 18:16:34 2015 UTC,Your thermostat is most likely stuck open and needs replaced. Replace the water pump and do a coolant flush while youre at it. Although i will say most e30s temp needles aren't exactly in the center of the thermostat
E30,2rf7gz,Pumacaine,2,Mon Jan 5 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"This what I came here to say. And you're right, my temp needle is always on the first line."
E30,2rf7gz,Narek_S,1 point,Mon Jan 5 18:53:26 2015 UTC,I guess while I'm at the water pump I should do the timing belt as well?

E30,2rf7gz,dtaivp,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:14:54 2015 UTC,If you are looking into getting a timing belt check out the gates racing belt. Although it has racing in the name it really is just a more durable part then the oem one. Also while you are changing the belt you probably want to replace the tensioner because they tend to fail as well.
E30,2rf7gz,Grrrmachine,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This has all the usual symptoms.  OP, if you replace the thermostat, make sure you get the right unit and that you really bleed the cooling system properly. M20 engines can be a bastard to bleed, and the heads are prone to cracking if they overheat. Ideally you want the 80 degree C thermostat, which should make your temp gauge sit between the 1/4 and 1/2 mark when warm."
E30,2rf7gz,protomor,2,Mon Jan 5 22:20:14 2015 UTC,Your ECU uses a separate sensor for temps so I don't think the gauge staying cold means anything.
E30,2rf7gz,perfecttttt,1 point,Mon Jan 5 18:28:42 2015 UTC,Could it just be corrosion or a bad connection then on the clusters end? Because I have issues with the lights as well. Sometimes the cluster lights are on and others they're not.
E30,2rf7gz,protomor,3,Mon Jan 5 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that there are resistance tests for the sensors. If they check out I would look into the cluster. Sometimes the service interval board will have a battery which fails and leaks acid, if so, then you need to fix that, because it'll cause problems. You can replace the board or you can use a wire to jump a couple terminals to ignore it."
E30,2rf7gz,Grrrmachine,2,Mon Jan 5 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"if the needle doesn't move, that makes sense. If the needle moves up just a smidge, it's probably reading right and your thermostat is stuck open."

E30,2rdo3g,navamaras,2,Mon Jan 5 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"For starters, is this in motion or does it also do it if you rev the engine in neutral? This will help isolate drivetrain issues from the rest of the engine.  Beyond that, examine the condition of the engine mounts, as worn rubber will allow a lot more movement at certain revs. If that's all good, assess the condition of the exhaust manifold and downpipe seals, as you may have a very slight leak that often sounds like tapping.  If those tricks don't help, don't be afraid to use a long screwdriver as a stethoscope while a friend revs the engine. That will help enormously in determining where the hum is coming from."

They can carry on for hundreds of thousands of miles like that, so there's no reason to sell a kidney in order to finance a rebuild.  However, I'd be more inclined to suspect the exhaust. Look at the state of the rear heatshield above the backbox (muffler for you). If that's not the problem, check the condition of the rear exhaust hangers as well as the gearbox/exhaust support arm, to make sure the exhaust isn't touching the car body anywhere."

E30,2qsqsw,tokeonthis,7,Tue Dec 30 08:05:46 2014 UTC,"Your Motorsport tuning chip will do the square root of fuck-all, like most chips. The early Motronic management is simply too primitive to achieve the quoted power gains. What these sorts of chips CAN do is either:  a) delete ""unnecessary"" parts of the fuel map, such as high-altitude/low oxygen fuelling and ultra-low temp scenarios, as well as shift the power band a little bit lower b) run the engine rich. This gives temporary and marginal power gains while seriously decreasing engine life (the Motorsport solution).  I've seen dozens of chips and countless dyno runs, and they're all the same eBay bullshit. If you do not make significant changes to the M20 engine (big-bore intake, high-flow exhaust manifold a la Racing Dynamics/Alpina, and a high-lift cam as a minimum) then a chip is little more than a placebo, or a band-aid for existing issues with the engine.  As for actual engine mods; get the donk running the way it should be to start with. Pull the injectors and have them ultrasonically cleaned, fit an OEM name brand filter instead of a useless aftermarket cone/pod one, and make sure every gasket and hose in and around the engine is replaced, so that you have no unwanted air or fluid leaks.  As for the link you posted; I'd ignore most of the advice on there. Bigger injectors on their own are a waste of money and fuel if you don't make other mods to compensate, and those mods cost $$$. Possibly the only decent advice on that page is fitting the 885 head from a 325i, as this is the cheapest way to build a M20B27 stroker engine. However, you may find that the costs of doing this are comparable to fitting an M50/M52 engine, which offers equivalent power, better throttle response and better fuel economy without running 25+ year old parts.  Most importantly, you are not going to get 200+ hp from this engine without going forced induction.  Sorry if this post is a downer on your plans, but over the years I've seen far too many newcomers to E30s spunk their hard-earned cash on pipe dreams and snake oil. The only real way to improve this engine is to build a stroker from it: for more info read this, this and this."

With the countless hours of research I did on the swap, it came to the conclusion that with the budget I have I wouldn't be able to have a guaranteed reliable swap and was more of a risk I wasn't willing to take since I have a perfectly running motor right now.

E30,2qsqsw,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:23:11 2014 UTC,"Ok, quick analysis:  There was never a Motronic 1.3 DME for the M20B27 engine. It IS a good idea to fit the M1.3 to older engines (especially 320i Jetronics), but you will have to source a custom chip - the 325i ECU will not have the correct map for an M20B27 engine. It's not a good upgrade in terms of power, but it's useful for fuel economy, throttle response and parts availability (no pesky gearbox sensors to fail/break). It's only really worth doing if you're making other changes to the engine, but here's my guide to the job if you want to try it.  As for the rest: a head swap on to the eta bottom end yields a wonderful torquey motor that's good for 190hp if done right, and can be more economical than the 325i. It all depends on whether you just want to fit a new head, or go to all the trouble of fitting 325i pistons too (which means refreshing the bottom end with new journals etc). It's not a weekend job and it requires some tool investment and having the new head resurfaced, but there are plenty of people out there running these engines. It won't be any cheaper or easier than an M50 swap, but it doesn't require any welding and your engine bay still looks ""original""."
E30,2qsqsw,SoundByte,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:57:06 2014 UTC,"I'd say that a 200 hp NA M20 is possible, but not without serious money into machine work, at which point a 24v swap is many times more economical.   Good info. Chips always seemed like a waste of time."
E30,2qsqsw,13515m0r3,0,Wed Dec 31 11:27:14 2014 UTC,"I disagree. Both MarkD and Squidd chips I've tried have resulted in a much more free breathing high rpm range (subjective). The eBay chip I tried for fun? Not so much. Granted I have a 153 ecu rather than the motronic 1.3 173 ecu. I tested through butt dyno (engineering student, learn to never trust) and then acceleration from 5-75 shifting smoothly (not as fast as I could because that could be less consistent) at 6000 (5800 is peak). I tested knowing auto adjustment/learning by driving for 200 mi before testing. Chips showed improvement of roughly 2-3 percent over stock chip, eBay chip showed losses... I tested as well as I could and the reputable chips never were slower than the fastest stock chip. I did have 19lb Bosch design iii injectors that were freshly rebuilt (19 lb chips) and a supersprint exhaust that I doubt would make any difference. My theory: chips tuned for the 93 octane I use vs 87 with stock chip allows more radical timing.  I agree that the essentials are more important than a chip though: gasket leaks, injectors, vacuum leaks, the air filter (stock box is surprisingly efficient contrary to all CAI junkies), AFM being clean, and making sure spark plugs and cables are in good condition (and dizzy occasionally) are more significant together than 2-3% from a chip.

E30,2qsqsw,protomor,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:27:37 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna mostly agree but disagree with /u/Grrrmachine You WILL NOT get 200hp out of that engine. With a chip and a nicer exhaust you'll get maybe 10whp out of the engine. But that's about all you can expect. IMO, chips are the best bang for buck mod to any M20. Dollar per hp anyway. I saw a 10whp gain on my b25 motor back in the day (tuner motorsports chip).  The rest I'll agree with. You can do an ""i"" head swap but it will still be less power than just putting in an ""i"" engine. But at that point, you might as well put in an M50 based engine and have tons more. Even S50/S52s are getting super cheap these days and START at/past your 200hp goal.   IMO - The eta engine isn't worth making faster. It's an mpg beater."
E30,2qsqsw,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Dec 30 14:04:10 2014 UTC,"If you saw 10whp from a chip on an M20, then your injectors were knackered and increasing the pulse width managed to increase the mixture to compensate.  The Motronic 1.3, let alone the 1.1 or 1.0, simply doesn't have the resolution to offer significant gains from chip tuning. It took Alpina a chip, a cam and a full exhaust swap to get ten more horses from a brand new M20 in 1988, so I highly doubt Tuner Motorsport have somehow improved upon that."
E30,2qsqsw,protomor,1 point,Tue Dec 30 14:16:35 2014 UTC,I'm just saying what happened to me IRL. I was always told the chip leaned things out and took advantage of higher octane to do so. Something about factory ran things rich for safety and the chip leans it since you're ok killing your engine.
E30,2qsqsw,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Dec 30 14:22:19 2014 UTC,"Yes, the factory map included things like running 85 RON at 20,000 ft, and deleting those settings may ultimately claw 1-3hp out of the engine if run at sea level at the right temperature. More importantly, you can shift the power band to get more torque lower down as well as raise the rev limit, which is what makes most people think they're getting more power.  But the dinosaur-tech engine management on an M20 doesn't have knock sensors, only a throttle switch rather than a sensor, and many cars don't have a lambda sensor either, so there's little to no feedback to the ECU to control fuelling. All it can do is retard the spark to get compression as high as possible (with the right fuel), and all that's going to lead to is burst head gaskets and bore wash from overfuelling.  Like I said, a chip is either a placebo or a band aid for fucked injectors. The $250 a Turner chip costs would yield much better gains if spent on a decent service, including rebuilt injectors, with change left over."
E30,2qrtq5,Kush_Incinerator,4,Tue Dec 30 02:09:17 2014 UTC,"Google ""m20 2.7 stroker build"" and read up. This is somewhat common for guys to build before going forced induction (turbo). Looks exactly what this guy was going for. Although, it's more economical to go M50/S50/52 these days. A stock M50 makes 190 hp or so and can be found in a junkyard.   Right now this motor is probably able to put down 170-180 rwhp if tuned properly. The parts list is impressive. The head alone is almost $2k. It sounds like this guy knew what he was doing when assembling.   Sounds like this car is worth what he's asking. I'd try to talk him down some, of course. Other guys in here are poor as shit college kids so they'll always say an E30 is only worth $1-3k ;)"
E30,2qrtq5,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Dec 30 03:56:11 2014 UTC,So this is essentially a stroker then? How reliable and quick is this compared to a stock 325i? I'm needing a daily so reliability is important.
E30,2qrtq5,Maximuscuntus,3,Tue Dec 30 04:19:43 2014 UTC,"Reliability wise, it'll be very similar to a stock M20b25, only marginally more stress on certain engine components (springs are the only real source of unreliability in a cam change on the M20's IIRC). Power wise, you have to ask are you comparing it to other 325i's on the market or a rebuilt 325i? The former, I'd say about 60hp difference, due to the rebuilt+power mods, but against a rebuilt M20b25 with stock spec I'd say about 40hp more.   I'd go for it, the guy looks like an enthusiast and that's an important sign. I don't imagine someone would put that much money into a dud. I'd jump on it, try work the price down of course but even at that value it's worth it."

He brought it in and got a quote and never came back for two years then signed it over.  The car has set for around 5 years total according to the shop owner but I think the plates are a little older than that.  I found insurance papers from 07 in it and the tires still hold air and don't look too rotted. I plan on rebuilding the engine once I get the ix in the garage sold.

E30,2q8fmo,messier_is_ok,2,Wed Dec 24 10:34:57 2014 UTC,"Temp sensor replacement is a legit first move on this situation, and is cheapest in terms of parts and labor.  I'd only fault them for not fully testing the car afterwards."
E30,2q8fmo,time_fo_that,3,Wed Dec 24 16:55:55 2014 UTC,"Who were you told your carb is going out by? I wouldn't trust them for any more advice, all it takes is a look under the hood to see that there's six fuel injectors right under the intake.   Are you getting any check engine lights? Try the stomp test (turn the key to the on position without starting the engine, press the gas pedal five times quickly, and count the flashes, Google it for more detailed instructions) to see if there are any errors stored.   It sounds kinda like a really bad vacuum leak. Something in the system isn't metering air or fuel correctly, and it could be the air flow meter (AFM), O2 sensor, idle air control valve, coolant temp sensors, etc."
E30,2q8fmo,messier_is_ok,2,Wed Dec 24 02:13:02 2014 UTC,"The person who told me that based it off smell. They told me after i drove of the last time it happened. I knew he knew little about cars, let alone BMWs. I know the SRS light blinks constantly, and the washer fluid light is always on. On top of that the brake light one turns on every now and again. Also, all the lights below the gauges glow bright the second I start it up.  Edit: I know when I took it into the shop they replaced all of the temp gauge sensors, and flushed the coolant. if that helps."
E30,2q8fmo,time_fo_that,3,Wed Dec 24 02:25:12 2014 UTC,"for what its worth, replacing the coolant sensor would have been my first thought.  i suggest that you consider doing an ignition refresh. spark plug wires, spark plugs, ignition coil. if that doesnt't help, replace the distributor cap and rotor to complete the ignition system refresh.  ignition systems going bad can be influenced by temperature, and will smell like unburnt fuel when you get a misfire."
E30,2q8fmo,jrodp1,1 point,Wed Dec 24 04:11:07 2014 UTC,"Forgot to reply, all the lights are supposed to come on right when you turn the key, then they go off.   Brakes, SRS (airbags), and washer fluid definitely don't have to do with it. I meant the actual light that says ""Check Engine.""  Seriously though, Google the e30 stomp test, it's not hard and could narrow it down."
E30,2q8fmo,lunchskate,3,Thu Jan 1 07:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a limb here, so take it with a grain of salt. And say to check your fuel filter to see of its been replaced. Ever. I had a similar issue with my car at temperatures below 50. Had to give it some gas to have it start. Replaced it and haven't had to give it gas. Granted it takes one to two tries of the key to start. But it starts. Also check the fuel lines to see if they're old and brittle. And the vacuum hoses like everyone is recommending. I'm still learning so I'm no expert."
E30,2q8fmo,OHoSPARTACUS,2,Wed Dec 24 02:46:33 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a vaccum leak. Sometimes when i had old hoses on any older car and outside temps drop I would get hesitation or no cold starts. What I would do is reset/reboot/recalibrate the computer. Pull the fuse for the battery or disconnect the battery for a couple minutes. The reconnect and turn the key.  What this does is compensate for the extra air or colder temps the car is trying start up at, when it was normally trying start with different air and fuel ratios. This could be why your car smells with gas. The computer is trying to add more fuel for the more air its getting or something. Pulling the plug could reset it. I've done this for friends and they think I'm a magician. Hopefully this is your case. Its a quick and cheap possible fix until you get that leak sorted."
E30,2q8fmo,protomor,2,Wed Dec 24 02:22:18 2014 UTC,I've been struggling with getting my e30 started in the cold for years and if disconnecting the battery fixes this in a pinch I'm gonna shit myself
E30,2q8fmo,karmiccalamity,2,Wed Dec 24 05:57:23 2014 UTC,"Simply put, your car needs some love. If they haven't been replaced try this: * Vent tube from valve cover to throttle body * intake elbow * ignition components (plugs/wires/cap/rotor) * vacuum line from manifold to fpr * Check the charcoal canister to throttle body hose/valve    I bet your car starts behaving after this."
E30,2q8fmo,karmiccalamity,1 point,Wed Dec 24 13:46:28 2014 UTC,Also intake manifold gasket and injector seals. Another common vacuum leak area.

E30,2q0p0m,Dyver_Finnigan,3,Mon Dec 22 00:24:07 2014 UTC,The factory E36 oil pan would hit the subframe on an E30. E34s are front sump so it fits perfectly. You can't get around it.

E30,2q0p0m,single-needle,1 point,Mon Dec 22 03:13:19 2014 UTC,Guy just wants it gone. He found an S52 so he doesn't want this motor. $100. I'm tight on cash and trying to finish the car before January first. She broke in September and it's been killing me to see her sad.
E30,2pzqim,asul596,3,Sun Dec 21 18:58:05 2014 UTC,That's the oil pressure dummy light switch. It should have one prong in it. The wiring actually comes from the other side of the block via the front wiring loom that goes on the timing cover iirc. Lots of turbo guys use that spot to pull a turbo oil feed.
E30,2pzqim,protomor,2,Sun Dec 21 19:04:18 2014 UTC,lol funny how i bought this car from the po and he told me its ready to be turbo'd but he didnt have the money for it and im just finding all this unplugged sh*t thanks though
E30,2pzqim,protomor,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:49:31 2014 UTC,Well... never trust POs lol. But yea. it's not that important and many of the M20s I've seen have had that wire cut accidentally on a pulley.

E30,2puhae,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sat Dec 27 02:54:53 2014 UTC,Mine was pretty rough from the beginning. Has the common surface corrosion on the frame and inside the trunk. Seems like the previous owner didn't wash off the salt after the storms would hit. I also own a '90 Integra that I purchased from the original owner that is super clean even considering it has been here in Salt Lake all of it's life. I wash it after every storm. That's all it takes is washing and waxing. I think you will be ok as long as you can handle that.

E30,2purq6,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sat Dec 20 05:21:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah I did that. They difference is that it makes the sound more when I first drive the car for the day. It starts to go away after awhile.  Also, before it goes away, the noise is the worst between 1000-2000 rpm.  I listened from outside the car while someone else is on the throttle and the sound is coming from the center of the car. The sound originates from what sounds like the catalytic converter, but that's also the general area as the CSB from what I understand."
E30,2purq6,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Sat Dec 20 16:17:07 2014 UTC,"If the car is stationary  and it's rattling, it's not the CSB. Since the CSB will only come into play with the car moving.

E30,2pskgh,I_AM_BISON,1 point,Sun Dec 21 12:35:52 2014 UTC,"They are direct replacements. The e36 are rater for a little more flow then the e30 ones but the e36 run at 3.5 bar fuel pressure as opposed to the e30 which run at 3.0 bar fuel pressure. At 3.0 bar, the e36 injectors still flow a little bit more fuel than the stock injectors.  If I remember correctly the e30 injectors flow around 15 lbs and the e36 flow 17 lbs. At 3.0 bar the e36 injectors flow around 16 lbs.  The other benefit is that the e36 injectors are 4 pin instead of 1 pin and provide a better spray and therefore a better fuel mixture. This provides ""smoother power"" from what I've heard.  There's no real guide since they are a direct replacement for the stock injectors. I plan on doing another dyno run after I replace them to compare to my base run and see if there is a big difference on paper and feel."

E30,2pskgh,karmat0se,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:36:04 2014 UTC,"I was afraid of that too so I did tons of research about them.   If you get the Z3 rack with the part no. ending in 031, it's the early Z3 rack with the 2.7ltl which is linear. The later ones are just rebranded e36 racks (3.2ltl) and are progressive.   I have heard they decrease steering angle though, so we'll see about that once it's in. It might upset me having to do 4 point turns instead of 3 though ;)"

E30,2pqh6x,tokeonthis,2,Thu Dec 18 23:48:17 2014 UTC,"I had to rebuild my drivers side door lock - it was totally seized.  Pulled the door apart and extracted both the lock barrel and the locking mechanism. It's not that hard, but it is fiddly and will require you to be something of a trainee contortionist. A good head lamp is recommended.  This is a really good guide:  http://www.billswebspace.com/BMWE30DoorPanelRemoval-LockCylinderRebuild.htm  Over time, the locking mechanism fills with dust/crap and loses its ability to operate smoothly. In my case, the lock had become so stiff the PO managed to snap off the small metal arm on the rear of the lock barrel. I found it lying in the bottom of the door.  After removal I dunked the locking mechanism in boiling water for a few minutes, then drowned it in carb cleaner then wd40. Repeated the process a couple of times and finished off with dry graphite lube. Now it's smooth as butter. I'll admit the boiling thing is a little odd, but I figured it would help loosen up all the accumulated crap. If I have to do it again, I'll probably just drown it in carb cleaner/wd40/dry lube.  Rebuilding the lock barrel is easy enough - just make sure you keep the sliding plates in the right order during disassembly!  No 27 is what you want (confirm compatibility):  http://realoem.com/bmw/showparts.do?model=1412&mospid=47283&btnr=41_0560&hg=41&fg=40  Probably the hardest part was putting it all back together. The central locking actuator, the small metal arms that connect the door opener to the locking mechanism to the door lock pin - took me a couple of hours. I suggest taking a few photos to make reassembly less stressful.  Depending on how many doors you want to pull apart, I would suggest buying about 10 of these:  http://www.ecstuning.com/ES154612/  They're the little bushings for all the moving parts and replacing them keeps it all slack free and moving smoothly. Mine were distinctly oval in shape when removed. If memory serves, you need about 4 on the actual lock mechanism and 2 or 3 on the door opener/lock pin.  Good luck :-)"

E30,2pqh6x,beefcakez,1 point,Fri Dec 19 04:46:31 2014 UTC,"Nope. I bought a rebuild kit and it took me about a half hour.   You can find the rebuild kits on ebay for ~$26.   Just make sure you have a clean area with good lighting. There are lots of tiny springs and plates that can easily be lost. I pulled each one out one by one and wrote everything down on paper.

E30,2pq8uy,protomor,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:36:22 2014 UTC,A bad clutch fan wouldn't cause it to overheat like that unless he is stuck in traffic for quite a while. I've removed my fan clutch and replaced it with an electric fan which I turn on with a manual switch. The fan is hardly ever on and my temperature needle doesn't even reach the middle mark. I only turn it on when there's heavy traffic. My bet is that the thermostat is stuck closed or there is a large amount of air in his cooling system.   EDIT: one letter

E30,2pq8uy,bimmerjim,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:25:28 2014 UTC,"I have yet to fix the leak, I'm pretty sure its the water pump but Im too lazy to take all of that off again."
E30,2pq8uy,perfecttttt,1 point,Fri Dec 19 07:19:13 2014 UTC,that very well could be the source of your overheating is that leak. puts and air bubble in the system every time it heat cycles. maybe double check the torque on the tater pump bolts? i think you could do that without tearing to much apart
E30,2pq8uy,Narek_S,1 point,Fri Dec 19 07:46:39 2014 UTC,"If air can get into the cooling system then the system will lose pressure and the boiling point will decrease. Also make sure that there is a little hole on the top of the t-stat, this will make bleeding much easier if there isn't a hole already.  Fix the leak, then tell us whats up. You could also check the pressure of the coolant system."
E30,2pq8uy,Tim_WithEightVowels,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:53:55 2014 UTC,Then what's the point of this thread if you're too lazy to fix the problem? Let it overheat.

E30,2pprkd,rustede30,2,Fri Dec 19 02:48:26 2014 UTC,"You may want to call a few upholstery guys in your area and see what they say. I just don't think that anyone is going to take it and sew in another window for much less than $250. Even if they fix it for $200 which might be reasonable but to me it would be worth the extra $50 to get a new top.  You might be able to patch it with clear tape and it might be okay. Personally, it would drive me crazy but if I didn't have the money it would make do. Call around and see. Might be able to find a used one from someone who's upgrading. Build a hard top."

E30,2pi7vt,Grrrmachine,2,Tue Dec 16 23:53:17 2014 UTC,The motor is installed wrong if you have to pull it up.
E30,2pi7vt,tspangle88,2,Tue Dec 16 23:54:00 2014 UTC,"It's not, there is no way to put it wrong. The rebuilt motor is too weak or the regulator is not smooth enough. I would need to spend $150 on 1 new motor when for that money I could convert 3 of my windows to manual"
E30,2pi7vt,Bipin93,1 point,Wed Dec 17 00:09:45 2014 UTC,"Most likely it's corrosion of the C404/C405 plugs in the door jambs. To confirm, remove the doorcard and apply power directly to the window motor. If the motor moves but slowly/jerkily, you need to apply some grease to the window runners.  Even if the motor is dead, it can usually be stripped, greased and rebuilt. It's very rare that the motors blow, even after 25 years."
E30,2phg4y,asul596,2,Tue Dec 16 17:13:54 2014 UTC,It looks like you've done work to the motor recently. The video isn't good enough to tell you where it's coming from.   Common places to check: Valve cover gasket Cam seal Head gasket

E30,2phg4y,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:54:18 2014 UTC,"Did you follow the torque specs and tightening sequence when installing it? I don't think you needed the RTV though. I've never used it and haven't had any leaks.   Can you take some pictures instead of a video? It's hard to see anything, especially sideways. I can't tell where it's oily or not, except around the oil filter and CPS. It looks like it may be some on the head, but I can't tell."
E30,2phg4y,SgtMajorZero,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:05:44 2014 UTC,"It's quite difficult to see what's going on from that video. Photos with lots of flash would help.  The area directly below the headgasket doesn't look too bad (ie, soaked in oil), so I'm not convinced it's that.  The oil filter adapter housing has a couple of servicable parts. The large bolt that runs through the middle has some o-rings that can be replaced (see #5 and #4):  http://realoem.com/bmw/showparts.do?model=1412&mospid=47283&btnr=11_4329&hg=11&fg=30  That's in addition to the seals that can be replaced in the link you posted. Make sure you've got a decent set of pliers as getting that locking ring back in is a bit of an arse.  There's also a honking great o-ring that mates the filter housing to the block (#2 in the above link).  The oil pipes to and from the filter housing also have orings on the end (#4):  http://realoem.com/bmw/showparts.do?model=1412&mospid=47283&btnr=17_0061&hg=17&fg=05  Suggesting these in the hope it's not actually the HG :(  Edit: or rocker shaft plugs, camshaft seal/o-ring, valve cover gasket..."

The only spot mine leaks is one tiny spot along my driver side window where my window and top do not quite seal. That's a pain though, as it leaks quite a bit when the water runs down the top.

E30,2p9q3r,MattPro,1 point,Mon Dec 22 06:53:11 2014 UTC,I ran the end of the lights between the door seal and body then have an extension cord that goes down the B pillar and under my seat where I have a very tiny (150w) power inverter. I just plug in the inverter whenever I want to turn the lights on then.   And it's actually Granit silver. It really looks like it's much lighter than it is in that picture not sure why.

E30,2p9q3r,ToastitoTheBandito,3,Sun Dec 14 20:58:00 2014 UTC,"Done that twice now...I've never had them come out smoothly.  Also get ready to do some drilling/chiseling. Usually when you use the lag bolt method some of the aluminum insert gets stuck in the body, and it's in a circle shape in the bolt hole. If that happens drill holes in it as much as you can then take a cold chisel and beat it until it comes out."
E30,2p9q3r,xXspoonfaceXx,2,Sun Dec 14 21:17:07 2014 UTC,Ugh. I'll be doing that soon. I've got a rear camber/toe kit that I'll be installing in the next month or so.
E30,2p9q3r,MattPro,1 point,Sun Dec 14 21:33:39 2014 UTC,"Remove rear seat, place rag over bolt holes, bash bolts up from underneath (the rags will stop them from breaking your glass) lower subframe as far as possible place something above the bush to push it out, Jack subframe back up and put as much pressure on the bush as possible, now get a heat gun or blow torch and heat the steal around the bush, try and do this evenly as it needs to get quite hot. Once hot enough the rubber will start to melt and the bush will be pushed out as you keep pressure on it."
E30,2p9q3r,xXspoonfaceXx,1 point,Mon Dec 15 04:03:11 2014 UTC,"I never bothered to remove the subframe bolts when I refreshed my rear bushings. Just undo all the necessary bolts/attachments and lower the subframe. Putting everything back together was pretty easy too, since the having the bolts in place made it easy to line everything up.  Also, subframe bushings were my least favourite part to replace. Ended up using a drill to and hacksaw to weaken them enough to push them out. Not fun. Putting the new ones in was a piece o piss. Heat them in hot water, apply some washing up liquid, use a threaded bolt and 2 dirt-cheap plastic (plumbing?) caps from the local hardware store - drill holes in them to feed the threaded rod through. Had them both installed in under 10 minutes. Satisfying but bloody hard work. Trailing arm bushings are a breeze by comparison."

It thinks you're just going to the grocery store.   Without that level of control, you'll have no idea where you are in the power band on track. Sometimes, it'll shift harshly enough to upset traction when you won't expect it.   If you don't have the third pedal, you have no place on a race track. It's like a knife at a gun fight."

If by 'American style' bumpers you're referring to the diving boards, they're actually only on the pre-'87 NA models; 'Euro style' bumpers are still available on the later models. I can't speak for Canada, but E30 pricing in North America is actually very reasonable compared to other parts of the world. You can get a 325i in good condition for around 7-8k which is a steal.

E30,2p4dr6,kmoran1,3,Fri Dec 12 22:44:34 2014 UTC,"It looks like you got a late model Cabrio, since only the 91 and 92 models got the plastic bumpers. I would recommend focusing on the relevant maintenance items for the car. If you don't know when the timing belt and water pump were last changed, they need to be changed immediately. I hope you got a maintenance log or some sort of receipts from the previous owner. If not, you may have some work to do. I would worry less about the appearance of the car unless there is any rust on the car.   I would:   Timing Belt if hasnt been done in last 60k miles or 2 years Check all fluids (oil, coolant, brakes, power steering) Flush transmission fluid and replace Flush Differential fluid and replace Oil change if necessary Brake pads, possibly do a brake fluid flush (BMW recommends doing this once per year)  Check all rubber hoses (radiator, intake, vacuum hoses) Check suspension bushings (rubber should be uncracked/deformed/falling apart) Check rubber flex-disk (guibo) on drive shaft (should be uncracked/falling apart) Check Center-Support Bearing on drive shaft Check engine, differential, transmission, oil pan for any leaks Check rubber boots on half-shafts from differential and steering rack Check shocks/springs - replace if stock or blown out   *Anything that is rubber and 25 years old will probably need replacing.  It also wouldn't hurt to do a compression test and leak down test on the engine to get an idea of the condition of the engine. This will tell you if your head gasket and piston rings are in good shape or are worn out.   Any leaks you have probably mean that there is a seal or gasket that needs to be replaced. These are 25 year old cars and unless the previous owners were very proactive chances are there will be plenty of maintenance items that need to be taken care of down the line. It's better to know what will need replacing.   Pickup a Bentley manual if you haven't already and check out the forums to find out how to DIY.   Some good reading: http://www.rtsauto.com/e30-bmw-buying-guide-translated-from-german/ http://www.billswebspace.com/bmw325es.htm  There is an article someplace about why retrofitting HIDs in e30 Smileys is not really a good idea. I would stick with getting a good set Smileys and decent bulbs."
E30,2p4dr6,5dmt,1 point,Tue Dec 16 05:56:30 2014 UTC,"Love the look on the bottle caps also, never seen that before. If you are going with bone stock, I'd go with smiley's. Suspension wise, definitely try find some low km springs. I'd rate it as quite important as the E30 I picked up not too long ago had only done 140ks (86,000 miles) but the suspension was already very soft and floaty, which was a right killjoy on the track. Another option, is that as beautiful as dead factory is, the 1.5inch drop you'll get if you buy some M3 springs will only make it look nicer (but not ricer, still lots of wheel gap) and greatly improve the handling.   However, if you aren't interested in handling so much as pure ride comfort, nothing beats the stock springs for me. I drove the car home 8 hours on rough New Zealand roads and it was smooth as anything."

E30,2p4dr6,protomor,1 point,Sat Dec 13 21:55:03 2014 UTC,"Look into euro Plate fillers, it would go well with the all red tails. If getting a filler is too expensive right off the bat, you could plasti-dip the space between the tails if you really like the look. If you want to keep a classic euro look, don't do HIDs, or LED license plate lights. Look into Euro trim, it removes the 4 corner marker lights. Or you could DIY it, this is on an e36 but its the same idea.     Also, look into doing something with wheels besides bottle caps.. look into getting a weave wheel of some sort? 14  inch basketweave off an iX or iS would look good, you could get actual 15 inch euro weaves if you're willing to spend extra money. That's if you want to stay oem, there are many aftermarket options that look great on e30s.   Look into getting a euro clock, or German check panel (If that part is different on verts, I apologize for my ignorance if that's the case. If you've got an air bag steering wheel (91? I bet you do if it's 100% stock) change it out for something else, M-tech 1 is my favorite, and easy to find for around $100.    Non Euro stuff, drop it a tad, look into getting a proper suspension, do a z3 steering rack swap, if it doesn't have a 5 speed it really is not that hard to swap it on your own if you're comfortable with that. Buy a Bentley Manual, and make an account on r3vlimited.    Obviously you want to do mechanical maintenance first."

E30,2p35y9,tokeonthis,2,Fri Dec 12 16:04:03 2014 UTC,That's why you grab it upside down (thumb facing towards the ground not up like you hold the shifter when changing gear) that way when it suddenly releases you're not pulling it directly toward your face. Just make sure no one is in the passenger seat because that's there your elbow will be rapidly moving towards.
E30,2p35y9,choppysmash,2,Fri Dec 12 19:55:19 2014 UTC,"This. Had the same issue on my E28, and used this technique to not hit myself. Nailed armrest of passenger seat instead. Good tip!"

I'd look for something that has a warranty. You can't go wrong with Behr (pricey) or even Nissen. I just bought a Nissen M42 to put in my car to clean up my bay, but it was $130 or so."
E30,2p1qzj,tokeonthis,5,Fri Dec 12 04:25:50 2014 UTC,its probably the contacts not the bulbs making a shitty connection.  the gray plastic contact board was a poor design and is always faulty  edit: i have the same problem

Are you just looking for a daily driver with a little more power than the M20? The M50 is widely available for cheap, and is a relatively easy swap.  Looking for a little more power? Then find an S50 or S52. They can be found easily too, but are more expensive. The S50 will be an easier swap than the S52, but there are pros and cons to swapping one engine over the other.   All said, it depends on what your goals and budget are. Do some research before you pull the trigger. Good luck."
E30,2ozs39,herzvik,2,Fri Dec 12 03:34:44 2014 UTC,"I'm wrapping up an m30b34 swap.  All in, I'm well under 1k.  Not a massive HP motor like an ls, but it's a proper period correct 12v lump that makes a good deal more power than the m20b25 it's replacing.    By using the m20 engine harness, and most of the m20 exhaust, it's as drop in as a swap can get.  Swap the oil pan and crank pulley from an e34, bolt on engine mounts, and drop it in.  The only cut/weld modifications are the exhaust and the shift carrier, which are both pretty basic jobs."
E30,2ozs39,username2110,1 point,Fri Dec 12 03:33:17 2014 UTC,I'm looking for a daily mostly.

E30,2ovjoy,beefcakez,3,Wed Dec 10 16:33:10 2014 UTC,I've used sach/spec. I prefer spec. I'd get a stage 2 sprung.   Stage 1 is shit. 2 is ok. 3 sprung is decent but kinda harsh for the street. 3+ isn't worth it on the street. 4 is fun.

E30,2oqn5n,Reysup,4,Tue Dec 9 09:05:52 2014 UTC,Check out the r3vlimited forums for forced induction
E30,2oqn5n,5dmt,4,Tue Dec 9 15:21:36 2014 UTC,"I've actually been researching this the past few days. I think you can safely run about 8-10 psi with no modifications. With head studs, to help not blow your head gaskets, you can go even higher. Forged Pistons/rods aren't really necessary unless you plan on going for BIG power. 250-300 is easily doable with little other modification, it seems.   Keep in mind that I'm just relaying information I've gathered. Do some research for yourself, there's a lot out there on the subject."
E30,2oqn5n,Ezzz49,1 point,Tue Dec 9 13:55:18 2014 UTC,This is what I've read as well. These motors are pretty darn stout as-is and are great for forced injection.
E30,2oqn5n,beefcakez,3,Tue Dec 9 15:44:45 2014 UTC,I've built a couple turbo cars now. With an MLS head gasket and head studs I pushed 12psi on a completely stock motor for 8 months reliably then moved on.   The most important part of running boost on a stock motor is how good your tune is.   Let me know if you have any specific questions!
E30,2oqn5n,MattPro,2,Tue Dec 9 17:31:57 2014 UTC,is it easy to learn to tune or can you buy pretuned ems?
E30,2oqn5n,N8bro,1 point,Tue Dec 9 20:48:08 2014 UTC,"It depends how complicated of a setup you want. If you go with a MegaSquirt setup you can find safe maps to start with online.

E30,2oqn5n,Chilezen,2,Wed Dec 10 02:46:34 2014 UTC,I went with a MegaSquirt 2 setup for my first car. There's a lot of support out there for MS and a lot of information and tunes floating around for E30s. My current car doesn't have MS but I plan on building an MS3 setup for it. I would highly recommend them because of popularity/price/quality.
E30,2oqn5n,MattPro,1 point,Wed Dec 10 03:08:35 2014 UTC,Did you keep the stock MAF sensor or or upgrade?
E30,2oqn5n,Chilezen,1 point,Wed Dec 10 03:19:13 2014 UTC,"I got rid of the stock unit and just used a MAP sensor. So the intake was free flowing until the throttle body. I also replaced the factory ignition system entirely, I used a coil pack on each spark plug setup as a wasted spark system."
E30,2oqn5n,MattPro,1 point,Wed Dec 10 03:38:00 2014 UTC,GM coils? Coil on plug or you use plug wires? Did you make a bracket to support them? Did you stay with the factory rec'd bosch plugs?
E30,2oqn5n,Chilezen,1 point,Wed Dec 10 04:51:28 2014 UTC,"I went with a custom coil on plug setup. I used M50 coil packs and made a custom support bracket for them on the valve cover. I then made custom length spark plug wires for the remaining distance. Because I was boosted I used non-stock plugs, but I ran the MS setup for a while before boost with stock plugs.

E30,2oqn5n,MattPro,1 point,Wed Dec 10 07:55:44 2014 UTC,"If you don't have a dedicated project car it can definitely take some time to get a setup like this running...it can get complicated and if you don't have a strong electrical background there is a learning curve. But yes there are shops that can do stuff like this for you...but since this is so custom it would probably be pretty expensive. I guess just talk to performance/tuning shops in your area and see if they would be willing to do something like this.    I'm not sure where you're located but there are some big-name e30 shops that do this all the time, if you search around on the forums I bet you could find some. There's also people on the forums who make megasquirt setups that are plug in play, if you contacted one of them I bet one of them would be willing to build you a setup for you to install. Finally, you can look around on the forums for used entire setups that already have all of this stuff. With the last two you still have to install them but at least the custom work is done."

Also so far from what I have heard 300 should be safe with new headstuds torqued to spec. Also it seems that the piston heads should be fine, first thing to go would be the connecting arms. Supposedly though on forged crank, pistons and connecting arms, 500 is safe. What turbo are you planning on using?"

E30,2opzxq,Rsurfing,7,Tue Dec 9 04:19:15 2014 UTC,"Here are 3 pages I  found useful and full of relevant information. I did a lot of research when I bought my E30 and it took me some time to find the right one. I highly recommend that you look for and buy an E30 from an enthusiast forum. I searched on craigslist for a long time and a lot of the cars I looked at were in poor shape and had unknown records.   Buying Guides: (Read me)  http://www.rtsauto.com/e30-bmw-buying-guide-translated-from-german/  http://www.bimmerforums.com/forum/showthread.php?826530-E30-buyers-guide  http://e30.iamgary.com/how-to-buy-a-bmw-e30/  I bought my car from a member of the r3vlmited forum and I was able to follow his restoration thread (with lots of pictures) and see exactly what was done to the car. You can also search forums for that users posts and see where they ran into trouble or were looking for parts. You are more likely to find an honest seller that has taken care of his E30 and is up front about what is wrong with it than sellers on craigslist.  I used craigslist to see local cars and get familiar with how they sound, drive, and their common issues. I test drove a few locally, but I ended up going to Chicago to buy the one I really wanted since the seller had rebuilt most of the car and I had photo proof via his forum thread.   Find yourself a good E30 with minimal rust and a clean body to work with. Most mechanical problems can be fixed inexpensively if you do the work yourself and source parts new or from salvage yards. Rust is much more difficult to combat. Make sure that the car you buy has as many maintenance records as available so you can gauge when/what has been replaced or repaired.    You want to check:  Body Rust/Paint -   if it's bubbling up, chances are there is a lot more under the surface on inside panels. Check the rockers, fenders, wheel wells, battery tray/jack tray in the back.   faded paint of cracked clear coat means you will eventually need a respray which is costly. (ask me how i know)   Drive train:  check the differential for leaks (input shaft and half shaft to each rear wheel), any leaks means you will need to re-seal the diff. Listen for a whine from the back when driving - this is common to LSD diffs and could mean it's worn out or has not been taken care of. Fluid should be changed every 100k or so miles and is a commonly overlooked maintenance item.  Check transmission for leaks (rear output shaft seal is common). Also take a look at the drive shaft - the center support bearing and flex disk (guibo) are wear items and will make a lot of noise (thunk or shake) when driving if worn out.   If automatic, check fluid color (pink is new, brown is old. beware of pink fluid in old car - people do a flush and replace fluid to cover up for transmission problems).   If manual transmission, check for shifter slop (looseness means you'll need to rebuild linkage which tends to wear out after 25+ years). Clutch engagement, does it slip or feel like its worn out? Listen to the transmission as well, the getrag 260 trans has a rattle that is common for its age, if its there when you clutch in the throwout bearing needs to be replaced.   Engine:   Timing belt. If it hasn't been done recently (2 years or 60k miles) do it immediately. Change the water pump at the same time.    Look for leaks in the valve cover, oil pan, head, crank shaft, etc. The passenger side corner of the valve cover is a common minor leak area. Minor leaks are to be expected but should be addressed.   Listen to the engine running, it should sound like a sewing machine (tap tap tap ... ) and be very even. m20 engines need the valves adjusted every 15K miles. It's an relatively easy process.   Check the oil - if it looks like mayonnaise it has a bad head gasket and needs a rebuild.   Check power steering reservoir/hoses/steering rack for leaks. Make sure to check the steering rack for cracks/rips in the rubber boots over the half shafts. The half shafts will need to be replaced if the boot is torn.   A/C will probably not work if it has not been updated to use R134a. Will need a new compressor and other parts for retrofit.  Interior  Leather Sport seats are desirable in good condition as is a crack free dash. Seats are easy to replace. Dash is not. Check for rust under the carpet on the floor boards. The headliner tends to separate under the visors where the leather has tightened and the glue dried.   Check the trunk. Check the seal and corners for water leaks or rust. Make sure to look under the battery try and car jack for rust. Very common area. Lift op the carpet and look under the spare tire for rust. Check the rear tow hook for rust.   TL;DR: Go to: r3vlimited forum: Cars for Sale/Wanted    Look For:   No Rust Mechanically sound with maintenance records  No major leaks   Optional:    Manual trans - good car to learn on Late model 88+ with plastic bumpers Avoid 325 / e unless you want better fuel efficiency but lower power (I get 32 mpg on highway in my chipped 325e)"

E30,2opzxq,MattPro,3,Wed Dec 10 03:26:15 2014 UTC,"The basics that everyone will say: - look for a car that has had all maintenance done on time (timing belt every 60k or 10 years is important, and things like regular oil changes should make you feel better about the car) - avoid very rusty cars, check the underside of the car for bad rust in the frame rails or floor pans  The most important thing with these cars is maintenance. If they are taken care of on time they will last forever, but if they are neglected there's a chance they won't for very long.   Start looking around on the e30 forums for buyers guides for more detailed things to look for. The major forums are: r3vlimkted, bimmerforums, e30tech.   Good luck!"

E30,2op0mh,tokeonthis,3,Mon Dec 8 22:59:31 2014 UTC,"I would definitely pull out the head unit and check out how it is wired behind it. Electrical issues are very hard to diagnose without being able to see them in person, but I would bet it's either a bad ground wire/connection or a bad power wire/connection adding in extra resistance. When the voltage of the car drops because of the blower motor or brake lights, the extra resistance could cause the voltage the radio sees to be so low it shuts off. Definitely take a look back there for any sketchy wiring."
E30,2op0mh,MattPro,3,Tue Dec 9 05:12:25 2014 UTC,"This. I'll add that modern aftermarket head units' wiring doesn't neatly mate up with the BMW stock wiring, so people often make a hack and slash job of it.

E30,2olimm,JayL1F3,4,Mon Dec 8 00:20:49 2014 UTC,"As an owner of a convertible that was sitting for a few years, I encourage you to be very cautious of a convertible that has been sitting for a few years. It gives things a lot of time to build up (rust, mildew, dust/dirt/grime) and to decay (rubber, gaskets, seals). A tarp is not totally weatherproof. Expect to replace lots of gaskets and hoses.  The turn signal stalk has snapped off? The same stalk also controls the high beams, so maybe it's just stuck in that position. If that's not the case, be prepared to track down electrical issues."
E30,2olimm,performedbeef,2,Mon Dec 8 04:01:40 2014 UTC,Thanks for the input! Lets hope the stalk is just stuck on high beam.  I figure for the price I'm being offered the car($900) I could afford to repair parts on the top and such if needed.
E30,2olimm,beefcakez,4,Mon Dec 8 04:06:30 2014 UTC,"Holy balls. Buy it. If the body is straight and rust free like you say, that's a steal!   Fog lights were standard on this car. The 318 came with deletes, but 325 cars had them.   The switch on the left side of the light switch is the OBC toggle. Pushing it inwards changes the OBC display from time, MPG, date, etc. (I didn't figure that out for a couple years because my OBC was broken)"

She may have heard that.   Otherwise, pistons don't really go bad per say.  Piston rings go bad, causing you to lose compression.  Cylinders can wear, causing you to lose compression.  Wrist pin bushings can go bad causing a nasty rattle/knock at 3k and up rpm's.  Con rod bushing can go bad causing a hearty knock. But like I said, pistons don't really go bad on their own normally.  If you want to put your mind at ease, take it to a trusted mechanic familiar with the engine, and have them look it over."

If you're not sure, buy yourself a cylinder compression gauge, and test each cylinder in turn. As long as each cylinder pressure is within 10% of the others, your engine's fine."

Also, the struts are probably shot. I had to replace 4 out of the 8 in mine. The mechanism wires tend to stretch out over time and make it really hard to disengage the seat position locks. You can remove the back cover and look at them if you like. Replacements are available from ECSTuning and probably some other places.   Anyway, what I'd do is pull the seats out (easy. It's only 4 bolts) and clean the sliders. I'd probably put some lithium grease on everything. If the seats won't raise or come back up after reclining under their own force, then the struts are shot.

Two-door non-sunroof manual 325's are the most desireable versions, and although this one doesn't have many extra features (it's got 14"" wheels, duckface bumpers, a lowly 6-button OBC, manual windows...) you can easily accesorise it later on with OEM BMW parts.  You need to ask if he changed the timing belt, and whether any suspension bushes have been changed (especially at the back end). Bodywise, feel for damp carpets, check the pockets in the trunk for water/rust, and look for signs of paint bubbling around the rear wheel arch and rear towing eye. Rust really is the ultimate deciding factor for these cars, so familiarise yourself with the Rust checklist before viewing.  If all's clean, that's a decent price for that car."

Also, some of the mods to the car are considered by a lot of people to be less tasteful...and that can sometimes reflect on how the car was taken care of but not always.

What else has been skimped on? No mention of any maintenance work, replacing bushes, checking if the fuel system and brake system aren't perished.

I have one fore my E30 and my E28, and it has never failed me.   I would also add a variety of different sized flatheads and phillips screwdrivers. And I would recommend an actual caliper spreader for brake changes vs a C-Clamp, as it is much easier in my experience and they can be had for ~$10."
E30,2ob4x2,Projekt535,3,Fri Dec 5 02:26:06 2014 UTC,"Buy yourself a set of metric wrenches and a socket set. You should be set for most repairs. Also, you'll want to get yourself a torque wrench so you don't strip threads when you retighten things.   If you're in the U.S. you can get all that stuff at Harbor Freight for dirt cheap. Don't expect much though. You get what you pay for, but I've had good luck with mine. I love having my nice tools, but the cheap ones are good sometimes. I.e. if I need a short wrench and can't find one, I can cut one of the harbor freight ones and not feel bad about it.   Nothing in these cars is too bad. Anyone with half a sense and can turn a wrench can do most repairs on this car.   You should buy yourself a Bentley manual too. Although, if you PM me I can email a digital copy to you."
E30,2ob4x2,beefcakez,4,Fri Dec 5 00:53:39 2014 UTC,"I'd say:   A decent screwdriver set 1/4"" and 3/8"" sockets from 8mm to 19mm 8mm to 19mm spanner set - make sure each spanner (wrench) is box on one end, ring on the other) 8mm, 10mm, 13mm and 17mm ratchet spanners 1/2"" 13mm, 17mm and 19mm sockets a good (2 foot long) 1/2"" breaker bar a trolley jack and a pair of jack stands needlenose pliers and wire cutters   With that toolset, you could completely dismantle and rebuild an entire E30 (excluding a few special bolts here and there). You don't have to buy it all at once, bust as you tackle each new job you'll have a reason to expand your toolkit.  In all honesty though, for the jobs you mention you just need some long screwdrivers and a 10mm socket on a screwdriver handle."

E30,2ob4x2,Grrrmachine,1 point,Fri Dec 5 07:18:29 2014 UTC,"Funny, I'd say the opposite. A test light is handy, but for most electrical system faults, a multimeter is better. Test lights can help diagnose whether there is voltage or not, but they tell you little about the quality of the circuit. Testing batteries, the charging system, the starting system, EFI, sensors, plus the instrument gauge circuits? You're gonna want to actually measure voltage or resistance.   True, the OP didn't mention any specific problems that require a multimeter now, but e30s have complex electrical systems that sooner or later fail. FWIW, I've got a cheapo, made in China MM that I paid about $30 about 15 years ago. Still works, and easily the best value of any tool in my box. YMMV"

As I said, the gas tank is the worst of it, but I did it on my first 318i with the rear subframe in place after much cursing.  And while you have the gas tank out, you can easily do the rear brake lines. Wheel bearings in the rear need to be done if you're gonna do the e-brake plates so it's a good time to get that done (I have the tool to do it). Seriously though, that's a Friday/Saturday/Sunday of work. Get it done and enjoy it. It'll kill you to stare at it while you could be driving it.   Get the gas tank from RockAuto (the Spectra 55L tank is great in fit and finish, I just installed one), get the rest of your parts from Altrom. They've got untouchable pricing ""locally"".

E30,2o576p,Grrrmachine,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:42:31 2014 UTC,"""Full renovation"" and ""rear beam refresh"" are worlds apart.  If you have 10 days off work, that's more than enough time to drop the rear axle, replace the fuel tank, redo all the rear brake lines and handbrake, as well as fit new rear beam and trailing arm bushes. You should always plan on doing these items as a job lot, as it's near impossible to do the rear brake pipes with the rear beam in place, and it all has to come off for the fuel tank anyway. Probably the only one worth outsouring is the rear wheel bearings, as it's much easier to take the trailing arms to a mechanic to press in new ones - this is a piece of cake if you've already got the back axle in pieces anyway.  These are the guides to help you:   Fuel Tank Handbrake Rear wheel bearing Rear subframe bushes Trailing arm bushes   All of this should be done on ANY E30 by now, regardless of future repairs. The back ends on most of these cars will have worn bushes and perished pipework, and tightening everything up with fresh rubber will dramatically improve the driveability, and therefore your pleasure, every time you get behind the wheel.  There is absolutely no point waiting 3-4 years to do this stuff, as in that time things will get increasingly floppy, rusty and generally unpleasant, until you no longer enjoy driving it. Why do that to yourself if you can overhaul the driving experience for a few hundred dollars?"
E30,2o576p,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:40:18 2014 UTC,"While you make good points, it hasn't been the most reliable car engine-wise. I sent some oil in for an analysis and it checked out okay, no excessive wear and it doesn't burn oil but it's been one thing after another keeping me from driving it. Fan clutches, belts, alternator, injectors, sensors all over the place.  That in mind, I do want to clean up the look of the engine bay with painting lots of the parts. I also need to do many new seals on the engine, transmission, and rear diff due to leaks. I want to remove the power steering as well and the interior is fairly trashed. This isn't my race car, I don't have a racecar. I do take this to the track on the odd occasion but it's my daily driver and ""show car"".  All of that in mind, this is a 325E, it's not a power beast. My winter car has a solid 50 some horsepower on it and it's lighter. (Although, nissans suck to drive as I have learned). I do want to do some of the upgrades such as the 2.7i conversion, updated cooling, possibly (not likely) turbo, fix/replace entire A/C system, and possibly a tune. I feel as though if I'm putting this much time and money into a car it would make sense to start over with a mint body, would it not?  Also, when I said I would wait 3 to 4 years to do that stuff, the car would be in storage for that time because I would be waiting to do a full restoration instead of just fixing a few of the broken parts.  In this response, I may have answered my own question but if you don't mind I would like to keep the conversation going a bit because I'm still not totally sold on keeping the car in storage and doing a full restoration. I am feeling as if I am still on the fence.  Edit: Just about every bushing everywhere on this car is toast too."
E30,2o576p,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:06:57 2014 UTC,"If this is the case, then I wouldn't kid yourself. Forget storage, forget restos, just sell it on now and buy something else that you want. We both know you're never going to turbo a 325e, and you're very unlikely to spend decent cash on welding and respraying arguably the least desirable model of E30. And having seen the pics, your car is in desperate need of a respray.  If your heart isn't in the right place before you start a resto, then it definitely won't be half-way through. It took me about two years and twice my expected budget to do my resto, and I did almost quit when I found the 19th place that needed welding."
E30,2o576p,Cakeyy,2,Wed Dec 3 16:34:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah fuck it. I'm just going to fix this shit and keep driving it. I will likely do the 2.7i and that's about it. I absolutely love the car and I worry too much about the body right now as is.  As for the ""desparate need of a respray"", I think you're wrong on that (unless you mean because you don't like the colours)  Just take a look at how she shines when you get a good polish and wax on her: http://i.imgur.com/WJfvk3Y.jpg  Also, if I were to do a complete resto on her I would keep the colours. I love it.  ""arguably the least desirable model of E30"" Man that's some hate. Engine swaps aren't that hard."
E30,2o576p,kpcnsk,3,Wed Dec 3 17:03:25 2014 UTC,"I'm not hating on your E30 (although the colours aren't to my taste). But even a fully restored 4-door 325e will be, well, not worth much compared to just about any other E30 model available in the US, so you can only justify the restoration costs if you truly love that car. If that's the car you want to own, more power to you.  If you need any help with the repairs; just ask. The pictures in the guides is of my own E30, and I distinctly remember which bits were easy, and which parts drew blood..."

E30,2o2ipg,tokeonthis,4,Tue Dec 2 18:48:51 2014 UTC,It really depends on what price you can get a good running motor for and your mechanical abilities.   If you can take care of the wiring by following guides online and can source a good running motor for cheap that budget could work...it is sometimes hard to find the right motor with all of the parts that are needed for the swap for a good price. A lot of that depends on your location as well.  Here's a good guide to start reading up on: http://www.e30zone.net/e30zonewiki/index.php/Engine_Swap_-_M5x
E30,2o2ipg,MattPro,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:57:37 2014 UTC,"If anyone has any questions on the guide linked above, just ask: I wrote it. It's written for UK readers though, which is why it addresses issues about the steering being on the right-hand side."

E30,2o2ipg,beefcakez,2,Tue Dec 2 21:59:54 2014 UTC,"You've missed out the sump gasket for a start.  Presumably you're also reusing the M20 clutch, gearbox and differential. This is the cheap way of doing it, which involves not only the (pointlessly expensive) transmission brace, but also bodging the shifter mechanism to compensate for gearbox tilt, and still leaving you with an old gearbox and used clutch. Remember that if the donor car is an auto then you'll also need a shifter mechanism and a pedal box, and it's always worth refreshing the clutch cylinders at the same time.  You haven't addressed engine cooling. The M5x heads are even more fragile than the M20 one, so cooling is essential. Budget for a new radiator and water pump, and also consider an electric fan swap; there is precious little space in an E30 for the M50's viscous setup.  Then there's the exhaust manifold (headers, as you Americans call them). You'll need a custom solution or be extremely skilled with a welder if you don't want to rob power from your new engine. This will be $$$.  Finally, using a used throttle cable on an engine swap is like booking a night with a $1000 hooker and then using a used condom to save cash.  All in all, you've approached the budgeting ass-backwards. Get your soldering iron out and make your own harness adapter for a lot less than $200. Spend the money where it matters on a decent E36 gearbox and differential, and appreciate the increased torque of the M50, which is the whole point of doing this swap. I've never even heard of the sway bar spacer, or why it's needed for doing this conversion."
E30,2o2ipg,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Dec 3 07:51:59 2014 UTC,"Shoot. I did forget a lot. Some of which I left off because they were part of my other work (radiator, electric fan) of which I'm doing now.   My build right now is all in preparation for a future swap.   I did plan on doing the harness myself, but put that in there for OP. As for the throttle cable, my bad. I did plan on buying a new one. Just didn't update it in my sheet (everything was copied from a sheet I put together months ago).   Anyway, thanks for the response. I definitely need to update my list."
E30,2o2ipg,beefcakez,5,Wed Dec 3 17:54:08 2014 UTC,"As with any motor swap, even uber common and well documented ones: Tally up what you think you'll need and double it. Something always comes up and those are the things that really kill ya.  Best advice I can make, buy a complete parts car. Something with a rough body that has the engine/trans you want. Part out the rest and try and recover some cash. Or do a 5-lug swap while you're in there."
E30,2o2ipg,karmat0se,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:35:39 2014 UTC,This is the most sensible advice in the thread (except the 5-lug swap; this only really works if you bought an E36 M3 parts car).

I've been down the turbo road with two e30s now, and if you don't have the budget for an M50 swap you don't want to turbo your car.

E30,2nqnk2,MattPro,1 point,Sat Nov 29 10:01:38 2014 UTC,Isn't the only real difference between the b27 and b25 the head so the head from an i would basically make them almost the same engine? Please correct me if i'm wrong.
E30,2nqnk2,MattPro,1 point,Sat Nov 29 10:54:37 2014 UTC,"No, there are other differences. Both motors have different pistons and a different stroke, so if you just switch the heads you will be left with a low compression motor that will make less power. If you use a ""super eta"" or just ""325"" motor with the head from a b25 you will make more power. That is the exception. But if your car says 325e and is not motor swapped you'll just be losing power by swapping heads.  Here's a good link to the specs: http://www.e30zone.net/e30zonewiki/index.php/M20"

E30,2nnlyz,pseudorandombehavior,5,Fri Nov 28 09:34:16 2014 UTC,"The engine and transmission are no different to any other standard 325i. It's the transfer box behind the gearbox and the in-sump diff that are specific to your car, and you should be able to swap those over very simply if you buy a replacement motor.  However, it's very rare that an M20 needs a rebuild unless it's been serially abused, and the Getrag gearboxes (assuming you have a manual) can't be rebuilt, in the sense that you can only get the parts under a blood moon on an anniversary of the E30s launch after sacrificing three Bavarian virgins. Getrag 260s rattle (especially the lay shafts), but they'll still soldier on for hundreds of thousands of miles like that.  The actual sale price of an E30 very rarely has anything to do with engine condition. It's ALL about the body shell, and since a) you haven't provided pics and b) the iX only came as the less-desirable 4-door, it's nearly impossible to give you a value. If yours does have rust, it's probably worth more in pieces to another 325iX owner looking for parts."

E30,2nnlyz,Grrrmachine,2,Fri Nov 28 11:29:02 2014 UTC,"Again, even the front and rear quarters are iX specific, so body issues are going to critically affect the price. And I never believe it when people tell me there's no rust; it's just all hidden on an E30 until you lift up the carpets...  In all honesty, with bodywork damage and a dead drivetrain, you'd be best off putting it on eBay for $1 and seeing what happens. I'd expect it to go around $1500, more if you're lucky."

E30,2ngc18,kpcnsk,2,Wed Nov 26 05:52:56 2014 UTC,A lot of that is phenomenally accurate...  ...except why the hell did you Americans call that one the 318i instead of the 318iS? You never had to suffer through the life of the M40 engine?
E30,2ngc18,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Nov 26 16:46:24 2014 UTC,I thought the only difference was sport seats and an lsd? My 91 318i has an m42  EDIT: Am american
E30,2ngc18,Pumacaine,3,Thu Nov 27 02:25:48 2014 UTC,"318is is also coupe only. Pre-'87 318i were equpped with the M10, and post-'87 were equipped with the M40 in every country except North America, which received them equipped with the M42 between '89 and '91."
E30,2nedcl,Gratuitousity,3,Tue Nov 25 19:12:20 2014 UTC,"That's a parts car at best, and I wouldn't touch the engine with a barge pole.   It's a nice basis for an engine conversion if you have 6 months and a couple of grand to overhaul the whole thing, but don't kid yourself; there are no simple fixes on this car. Even the ""head gasket"" won't actually be the problem here; it'll be corroded surfaces on the head itself, and you need a machine shop to skim it."
E30,2nedcl,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:20:53 2014 UTC,"Interesting point about the corroded surfaces on the head itself, I didn't consider that.  At that point, for these eta engines, I wouldn't want to take it to a machine shop.  Wouldn't really be worth it probably.  I suppose I could poke around locally to see what kind of engines I can get and for what price.  I have a reliable DD already so this can sit all it wants while I figure out what I'm doing  Thanks for your input!"
E30,2nedcl,DeepMidWicket,3,Tue Nov 25 19:29:56 2014 UTC,"M20 heads crack, 80% of the time that's the problem. Be prepared to spend $1000+ on a new head"
E30,2nedcl,Grrrmachine,2,Tue Nov 25 23:51:21 2014 UTC,"To be fair, it's only the ""885"" heads for the M20B25 that crack, because so much material is missing around the ports. This image should show you just how much we're talking about."
E30,2nedcl,protomor,4,Wed Nov 26 13:12:52 2014 UTC,"The headgaskets just don't ""go"". I've never seen a non turbo one do that. I think the head was taken off without reason. Probably just needed the cam seals.  For $1k, that's a good deal. Especially if you already know how to do a head gasket.  The eta motors will leave you wanting but it'll work for now."
E30,2nedcl,protomor,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:23:51 2014 UTC,"That's what I figure. If I can redo the head gasket (I did it on my Oldsmobile years ago) and get it running, I can shop around and find a nice engine for my first swap.    Thanks for your input!"
E30,2nedcl,beefcakez,2,Tue Nov 25 19:31:59 2014 UTC,"In which case, check the body for rust. That front fender area might be pretty bad. Grass and stuff gets in there and can rot. Other places to check are the rear wheel arches and the trunk lining. Some E30s like to rust on the frame rails where it meets the driver's/passenger's feet. You'll have to get pretty well under the car to see that though."

E30,2nbqlo,Chinampa,2,Tue Nov 25 16:27:26 2014 UTC,"Do you want the 325i/is look with the IS lip?   ""On E30 coupes and sedans the rear wheel arches were changed for the '88 model year. The arches are larger on pre-'87 cars and thus plastic bumpers will not fit on the rear without major modification.   The only metal bumper year that plastics are a direct swap for is '88. And I believe you need different bumper shocks to fit the plastic bumpers. If you get the plastic bumper cover, rebar, and shocks THE FRONT is a direct swap on all e30's, however with the cover, rebar and shocks the rear is only a direct swap on '88 model year coupes and sedans.   Now as far as cabrios go I believe, and I must stress I am not sure about this, that ALL e30 cabrios came with the smaller post-'88 arches. This would mean that plastics are a direct swap on all cabrios. Hopefully someone else can chime in on whether or not I am in fact correct on that but I believe that is the case."" Source  Hope this helps. In any matter, it's been done before. You can find body kits all over in any style you want, really.   Do you have any pictures of what you want?"
E30,2nbqlo,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Nov 25 04:10:27 2014 UTC,"Ideally a front bumper like this http://www.imcdb.org/i489235.jpg And the lower bumper cover http://smg.photobucket.com/user/jimmymoo/media/E30/DSC_1053.jpg.html as well as the trunk lip spoiler, but that should be very simple."
E30,2nbqlo,beefcakez,2,Tue Nov 25 04:48:27 2014 UTC,The front is the MtechII front end. You can find reproduction kits from many vendors. I think the most notable of those is Kopi.   The rear pic you show is actually just the stock metal of that car. Mine is the same.   The trunk lip spoiler is a stock 'is' model. You can find those in a forum for not too expensive.

E30,2nah2u,beefcakez,5,Mon Nov 24 19:24:35 2014 UTC,where did you get the rebuild kit?
E30,2nah2u,daruma3gakoronda,3,Mon Nov 24 21:31:45 2014 UTC,"Ebay    If you go with the German Vinyl, it's an additional $100. Not sure what it'd cost in leather. Much more, for sure."
E30,2nah2u,kpcnsk,3,Mon Nov 24 23:01:08 2014 UTC,"Link  Looks like the leather is almost twice as much. Still a good price for leather, assuming the fit is as well done as your vinyl seats."
E30,2nah2u,kpcnsk,2,Tue Nov 25 03:10:43 2014 UTC,"At first I was looking at those with a WTF? I didn't realize it was for the comfort seats and not the sport seats. Here's a link for the sport seat kit which is the same price.   Anyway, I'm too lazy to do the extra care it takes to keep leather in good condition. With vinyl, I'm not terribly worried if it gets damaged. I need to see if I can buy individual sections though as I expect to tear up that driver side bolster in the future as it's prone to wear.   Thanks for the link!"
E30,2nah2u,kpcnsk,2,Tue Nov 25 03:59:54 2014 UTC,"Doh! You're right. I was so excited to see the kit you originally linked that when I saw the leather ones I didn't look closely enough. In any case, the attention to detail is noteworthy. Other kits that I've seen are more expensive and don't have the vertical double stitching that these do. Hell, it's hard enough just to find any kit for the sport seats!   Again, great find and thanks for sharing."
E30,2nah2u,durtwagon,2,Tue Nov 25 04:10:28 2014 UTC,No problem! I was stoked when I found these. My seats have been trash since I bought the car in 2007. I've looked high and low for something that looked good and wasn't ridiculously priced. When these came up a couple years ago I saved the link for the future. Now I have [some] money and my wife is on board with me spending it on my car :)

E30,2n82sw,dtaivp,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:26:22 2014 UTC,yea i painted it in my garage. the lip is linoleum wall trim I picked up from Lowe's for $36 for 125ft of it. anyone want a lip $40 installed haha
E30,2n82sw,Dzdimi14,2,Mon Dec 1 15:36:00 2014 UTC,"That is kind of killer. I originally wasn't going to paint my car in my garage, but I think I might give it a shot now. Was it pretty difficult? And probably the easiest to install lip ever."
E30,2n82sw,Dzdimi14,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:01:50 2014 UTC,"No it was pretty straight forward, just have your car clean before you paint obviously. I scuffed some areas up with a green scotch pad and wiped it down with wet cheese cloth and let it dry then painted it. It's a super cheap alternative to like a $1500 paint job. And the lip took about 20 minutes with measuring and actually drilling into the valance. If you want any other advice let me know"

I like them the only thing that sucks is you have to cut the front tube assemblies and slide the coilover whats left of the strut tube and then have it welded. I had a friend of mine that i trust with my life to do it or I wouldn't have done it. but for the money they are well worth it.

E30,2n7po2,protomor,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:27:54 2014 UTC,"Good gracious. Don't spend that much on an ""e"" model. Keep looking for an ""i"". You'll be much happier, IMO.   As for the body kit, sorry. This is actually the least aftermarket looking kit you'll find as it was an original dealer item. They came installed straight from the factory on some cars in '90 and '91. IIRC, the 325iC models. The only thing I don't like on these Mtech kits are the side skirts. The valance cover is nice and looks great on cars without anything else too. However, I think a late model valance with the Reiger Infinity lip looks best, but that's my opinion.   Anyway, best of luck on your search."
E30,2n7po2,beefcakez,1 point,Mon Nov 24 13:16:44 2014 UTC,"This is a facelift m-tech bodykit, facelift front lights (fog and low beam) and front metal panel on a prefacelift car. Also side plastic parts of kit looks like two-piece (door and all else in one part) then it should be 4-piece. If seller cannot proof otherwise with pictures and leftover old original parts I will presume this all was done after a major front accident and kit may be cheap replica."

E30,2n54c6,supermansocks95,5,Sun Nov 23 04:45:03 2014 UTC,"There's a really hard bolt to get and hard to see, it's right on the top of the trans and has the transmission accelerator cable right in front of it.  http://www.pelicanparts.com/BMW/techarticles/E36-Clutch_Replace/pic61.jpg  The one on the left I believe.  Also, make sure you disengage the torque converter off the shaft when you're pulling out the trans (push it towards the rear of the car)  When I helped with the swap, we put one of the bottom bolts back in, took out all the rest and kind of levered it off the bottom bolt."
E30,2n54c6,Burzaa,5,Sun Nov 23 06:06:04 2014 UTC,"You always forget one or two lol. I wouldn't bother supporting the trans on anything when removing it. People say you might break stuff, but the only thing you'll break is the auto parts. You don't want those anyway.  My suggestion is to loosen the motor mount bolts a little bit Like half way. And just let the trans dangle. Take the brace and all that stuff off. It'll make it 10X easier to get to the trans bolts.   My other suggestion is to remove the sound deadening that is likely sagging a bit with age in case you ever have to get to that area again. It'll give you 1/2"" more space to get to those top two bolts.   There's also a small spot near where the oil pan cover meets the trans you can sneak a fat screw driver into to get some leverage. If you get desperate, you can take that whole cover off to see what's going on a little. Once that cover plate is off, there's really only 4 bolts holding the trans on. There's 2 for the starter but you already took that off and 4 BIG ASS torx (bigger than the others you took off for the oil pan cover). There's also a 10mm bolt facing the other direction (facing the rear of the car, not the front) into the trans that keeps the alignment plate to the trans. That will also have to come off.   Last and most important tip. That auto trans has been on there for YEARS. MOTHER FUCKING YEARS. You'll need to shake that fucker violently to get it to dislodge. I'm seriously not kidding.

Very unique and cool looking. But the prices are high. You're in Oz land and e30 things are hard to come by from my understanding. If everything is working and maintained they should last a while. The baur will be more of a premium because of its uniqueness. Don't know how available they are in Australia. Check for rust, temp, timing belt/waster pump."
E30,2mrvta,brahbarian,4,Wed Nov 19 15:29:34 2014 UTC,"Baurs are not so unique by production numbers and widely considered ugly as hell, in Europe they come much cheaper because of total lack of demand for these cars.  Also they come with most of convertible problems while not providing most of open roof fun. It's sort of a solution for only year-around convertible car for not so hot parts of Europe. I don't know why someone in Australia will want to buy it, if not only for it weirdness. In this particular pair of cars Baur looks much better in terms of condition and feels kinda sorted out, but have no power windows, no sport seats, and maybe some other extras. Conventional cabrio have visible dents (and all fenders/doors are unique for convertible) and miss some parts like lower plastic molding (also unique and not cheap)."
E30,2mrvta,russianprofessional,1 point,Wed Nov 19 18:40:12 2014 UTC,Agreed. Looking back at the Cabrio you can see the dents. Have you considered looking at a coupe of sedan?   Also the baurs are unique here in the states. Iv only seen one.

E30,2mrvta,Caspaa,1 point,Wed Nov 19 15:57:18 2014 UTC,"1) The one for $6800 is owned by an idiot. You get nice wheels and tyres and a fairly decent engine, but that's in a Baur TC2 shell (bleaurgh) and owned by the kind of retard who fits a K&N filter and the other typical bolt-on bullshit (check out the handbrake lever and steering wheel). NO mention of any critical maintenance or repair work, but I've already seen enough to walk away.  2) A fairly plain cabriolet with the 2-litre donk. This is a nice cruiser but it's very poorly equipped, running on mismatched tyres with some odd cover to mask an obviously cracked dashboard. The motor isn't going to rock your world but it's the perfect lump for a cabriolet, and the rest of the car has seen the right kind of attention in terms of maintenance. The price is also a lot more reasonable. The downside is the bodywork condition; you'll need a new front wing, for starters."

E30,2mpber,beefcakez,3,Tue Nov 18 21:14:51 2014 UTC,"I can't stand poly; they're essentially a bush that doesn't do the job of a bush.  For things like the rear beam, the rubber is supposed to grip the inner and outer metal linings, and the rubber itself twists to provide a damping effect. With poly, the sheer plastic just slides around the metal, offering very little suspension damping and a very harsh ride; it's a fool's compromise.  The only feasible argument for using poly is longevity; they perish slower than OEM rubber. However, decent brand rubber like Lemforder or Meyle will last 20 years - longer than the rest of the car, most likely. If you want a slightly stiffer back end, get some void fillers to press into the rear beam push cavities."
E30,2mpber,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Nov 19 07:10:45 2014 UTC,"This is what I was looking for. I've heard that about the poly bushings. I thought it would be a harsh ride. I found a set of poly trailing arm bushings for $65 compared to the $40 set for the oem rubber so I thought I'd get some input.   I've already bought the oem Lemforder subframe and trailing arm bushings (months ago, just hadn't taken the rear apart since I'm still working on the engine and bay).   Thanks for the input, man! I wanted good tracking, but my wife will be riding with me in this on occasion on our 40 mi work commute (windy roads :) ) so I don't want to make it unbearable.   Do you have any links to the subframe void fillers? I can't seem to find any."
E30,2mpber,protomor,1 point,Wed Nov 19 13:56:24 2014 UTC,Poly isn't all the same. I've seen poly bushings last 2 years. I also wouldn't get poly for anything that moves. Those need spherical.

It's this joint that normally fails, and surprisingly quickly too.   Poly really is a racetrack-only mod where you're expected to rebuild the suspension each race/season anyway.

I knew what you were asking ;)   This is my fun car so I plan to do a lot of thrashing (not like you, though) but it'll also be my commuter vehicle a lot of the time. My wife and I will drive it on our hour long trip to and from work sometimes as well as driving it back up to our parent's homes 9 hours away. I can deal with the rough ride, but my wife can't.   I wasn't sure about how the car will do with oem bushings and the weld-in rear camber/toe kit I'm putting in. Should be fine, but I'm just being overly cautious. I want to make sure it maintains alignment but isn't going to make me wince at the mere sight of a bump in the road."
E30,2mpber,Pumacaine,2,Wed Nov 19 15:10:48 2014 UTC,You're lowering the car? I've done a few of the weld in rear toe/camber kits and I don't think they really give you much adjustment if any at all. I'm actually much fonder of the raised subframe bushings.  I'd leave the trailing arm bushings rubber. The subframe will be fine with poly. You'll notice more noise but not much if your interior is still in.  Maybe drive around in my car and see what you think?

E30,2mn1di,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Nov 19 06:56:11 2014 UTC,"pop open gas cap. says what it needs in there. IIRC it says ""minimum 87. Recommended 91"" or something like that. I always give it minimum. Shit, my E46 said ""bitch gimmie 91. But I guess I'll take minimum grade"". Guess what that bitch got? Minimum grade. Guess what difference it made in my fuel economy and whp when I swapped? None.     Edit: Page 6 says 87 AKI 90 RON Edit2: That's M20s. Can't find M42s"
E30,2mn1di,protomor,1 point,Tue Nov 18 12:51:24 2014 UTC,"The rest of the world uses a different octane standard to the US and Canada, which varies significantly. What Euros call 95 on the RON scale is only 90 on the AKI index. That's our ""regular"" fuel, which is more than sufficient for a 318iS.  American ""Premium"" fuels (93 AKI / 97 RON) are utterly pointless in an M42 engine since it doesn't have any knock sensors to take advantage of it. The only improvement in using more expensive fuels is the increased quantity of detergents they contain, which may go a little way towards keeping your fuel system clean. However, in a 23-year-old engine your injectors are long overdue for rebuilding anyway, so those extra cents per gallon are just going to waste."
E30,2mn1di,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Nov 18 08:03:47 2014 UTC,"We only have 91 pump in California. the m42 is 10:1 compression ratio I believe. That is high enough to warrant premium. I don't get the knock sensor rational. The absence of sensors makes me want the safety of a high octane fuel in a higher comp engine. I mean they sense knock, the corrections are usually to retard timing/increase fuel. not sure what there is to take advantage of"
E30,2mn1di,Cat4lyst,1 point,Tue Nov 18 08:19:39 2014 UTC,"91's close enough; there's actually a degree of inaccuracy in the rating of each batch of fuel as it comes from the refinery anyway.  The point is that the compression ratio, valve size and combustion chamber are designed to work best with RON 95. If you're getting any advantage from using a higher octane, then something must be seriously wrong with your engine fueling (such as sticky/dribbly injectors or significant coke buildup) to need the ""safety"" of a higher octane.   If the engine is in decent working condition, the primitive Motronic 1.7 ECU has no ability to adjust its fuelling based on octane rating, and therefore anything over 95 (91 for you) is redundant.   The whole point of a knock sensor is to retard the spark timing so that the fuel/air mix can be compressed further, leading to improved detonation and more power. If you try to over-compress fuel, you get pre-detonation called pinking or knocking, so the M42 is set up to detonate at the amount most beneficial for 91 fuel. The delayed detonation of higher octane fuel is therefore utterly wasted if the M42 can't retard its ignition timing to take advantage of it."
E30,2mn1di,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Nov 18 08:25:07 2014 UTC,Point is op needs to run premium California gas.  Retarding timing does not typically increase power unless timing is way advanced already. It does the opposite. Higher octane fuel burns slower thus it resists pre-detonation. The knock sensor works to prevent pre-detonation/knocking/pinging/whatever you want to call it. It senses knock and the ecu then creates a safer operating condition by retarding timing/adding fuel or some combination of the two. Possibly other stuff in new cars. This does not add power. Its a mechanical safety feature.
E30,2mn1di,Cat4lyst,1 point,Tue Nov 18 09:14:27 2014 UTC,"I think you've just explained octane the same way I did, but you still haven't explained why OP needs premium gas (anything above 91 AKI).   If the engine isn't knocking with 91 fuel, then using anything with a higher octane won't make a difference. If it IS knocking with 91 fuel, there's a mechanical issue with the engine and using a higher octane is just masking the issue."
E30,2mn1di,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Nov 18 09:37:12 2014 UTC,"I'm glad we agree. Your response didn't read like that.  Its true above 91 probably won't make a difference. TBO I never suggested Op using anything higher. Truth be told older engines have a greater propensity for knock. Yes due to mechanical imperfections that have developed over its lifetime. Not everyone is going to teardown their engine to bring it back to new condition though. Minor issues can lead to increased likelyhood knock (like carbon deposits), the sound also may not be very easy to discern. That over time, as you to know, will fatigue the engine internals. You argue that it won't make a appreciable difference and that is fine. Personally I'd pay 10 cents more a gal for dat piece of mind if they sold 93 here in cali. By inverse logic, it sure won't hurt."
E30,2mn1di,Cat4lyst,1 point,Tue Nov 18 16:47:20 2014 UTC,The engine was completely rebuilt and in California the maximum octane is 91. Should I use that?

E30,2mitmg,beefcakez,1 point,Mon Nov 17 13:07:40 2014 UTC,"The z3 option is a good one. I think a grommet and antenna off a 318ti. There are a bunch of writeups on this, try r3vlimited.  There usually is a guy selling the base on there too. I did this recently was about 100 when all said and done with oem parts.  But if it still kinda works I would removed the whole antenna assembly and clean it up. Buy a new mast add some grease. will be the cheaper way to go, and you keep the o so 80's roll up antenna which is pretty bad ass imo"

E30,2mhzko,MrLsRealSon,6,Sun Nov 16 21:49:02 2014 UTC,"Yes, it has an S14 and the M3 Getrag, but it's missing the suspension, brakes, 5-lugs and wider wheels. So, not an M3, just an e30 with a S14... Which isn't a bad thing, but the Youtube title of the video is just wrong.   From M registry  ""What makes the E30 320is unique? The E30 320is is a special 3 Series model that was sold exclusively in Italy and Portugal in order to take advantage of the reduced taxes in those countries for cars with engines that displace two liters or less. It is powered by a 1990cc version of the four-cylinder S14 engine developed by BMW Motorsport for the E30 M3 and also shares its close-ratio Getrag gearbox with the M3. However, all other components are standard 3 Series items."""
E30,2mhzko,zacrl1230,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:04:58 2014 UTC,"Well in all reality the car isn't to far off considering 5 lug hubs with stronger bearings and adjustable sway bars set the m3 from its counterparts, with room for bigger brakes and more efficient cooling IIRC. Not ever driving one myself prevents me from having any real opinion on the matter, but I would think the drivetrain itself with the grunty little I4 and proper gear ratios would be a blast, not to mention all the other included mods."
E30,2mhzko,zacrl1230,2,Tue Nov 18 05:46:20 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. It's cool and rare-ish because it's an OEM 3-series with an M engine.  But the YouTube video calls it an M3, which it is not."

E30,2mi4d4,Kush_Incinerator,3,Sun Nov 16 22:35:10 2014 UTC,"Yes, the M20B27 had a 2.7l engine vs. the 2.5 of the M20B25 in the 325i.  It seems to be in fine condition based on what we are given to read. If the owner has had the car for 16 years,  it wouldn't hurt to ask him about things that a new owner might want to know, but he seems to have at least moderately looked after the maintenance. It does say it has a salvage title, so you might want to ask about that, though with an E30, that doesn't alarm me too much.   That being said, the M20 is a resilient engine that will likely outlast everything else on the car if cared for, so I wouldn't have any worries there, provided it has been watched after.  As always check for rust and rubber rot, which the former being a red flag and the latter being replaceable, but can get pricey.  That all being said, the price, IMO, is about a couple-three hundred too high. $1,500 wouldn't be low balling. The Eta's aren't as desirable as the regular 325i's, for performance reasons in my experience.   I am no expert, I just have a bit of experience with buying these things."

E30,2mi4d4,Sharino,1 point,Thu Nov 20 07:56:43 2014 UTC,Here is more info. I built one of these before and it was a fun car for cheap!  http://www.r3vlimited.com/board/showthread.php?t=100939
E30,2mg4lt,SulferAcid,8,Sun Nov 16 06:26:42 2014 UTC,"Firstly, if this is your first car and you're interested in learning about vehicles, then reassess your budget. Instead of spending 100% of your available funds on a car, spend 80% on the car, 10% on immediately replaceable parts (oil, filters, plugs, belts) and 10% on tools. If you own an E30, you WILL need them.  As for your cars:  1) This guy is living in a dream world. $7000 for a stock 325i with some bolt-on bullshit mods, a chipped hood and a cracked windscreen? It's got no cruise control, old aircon, 14"" wheels, headlights filled with piss and the famous ""no rust"" statement. Dream on.  2) Keen owner but lots of issues that need solving. That diff is completely the wrong ratio, and while it's got some nice features it has just as many downsides. That engine is burning a hell of a lot of oil (i.e replace it) and there's no aircon. You'll spend another $1000 on that car within a week of owning it.  3) Finally! A seller that admits to rust! A clean little 318iS with the rorty M42 engine - perfect for first-time buyers. ACTUAL repair work done instead of idiotic ""upgrades""; aircon, suspension, engine, clutch and brake work done using the correct parts. Great improvements (adjustable toe/camber plates at the rear, Z3 short shifter, and the stuff that needs fixing is easily doable by a novice (except maybe the welding). Even the grinding gearbox is no problem; Getrags get like that and can live for another 100,000 miles.  I'd say without a doubt that Number 3 is the one to go for. The seller knows these cars, has spent his money where it's needed, and isn't asking idiotic prices for the car."

E30,2mckz0,rustede30,1 point,Sun Nov 16 03:33:15 2014 UTC,lol it's my favorite motor so far. The LS has a few reliability issues but nothing too major. All motors have their down sides.
E30,2mckz0,protomor,1 point,Sun Nov 16 13:46:59 2014 UTC,What did you do to the suspension to accommodate the extra weight?
E30,2mckz0,rustede30,1 point,Sun Nov 16 17:41:30 2014 UTC,"Nothing yet. I'm thinking of lightening the front actually. The motor weighs about the same IIRC. Regardless, the V8 construction puts the weight farther back behind the front axle and lower in the bay so distribution is actually much nicer. Also, my last motor was an S52 turbo where the turbo sat at the very front of the motor. The V8 setup is much nicer :)"
E30,2mckz0,protomor,1 point,Sun Nov 16 21:03:47 2014 UTC,The v8 weighs the same as an m20? Is it aluminum? Why did you get rid of the s52? Really I'm thinking about building an m10 with a few s14 parts then going forced induction.
E30,2mckz0,rustede30,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:38:40 2014 UTC,I think about the same. At least close. Mine is aluminum yes.   The S52 turbo had a bunch of random issues. Loose piston ring gaps made is leak gas into the oil when it was cold and was loud. lots of random leaks. Lots of ish.

It's easy to get the wheels to spin just by letting the clutch out too fast on dry pavement, now think about what's going to happen when the road is slick.   Also it's not just the e30s, a lot of BMW people store their car for the winter. It's not just because of traction. It's due to a lot of things and yes rust is one them but   also because it's hard on the cars, people like to baby their bimmer and most importantly because other people just forget how to drive in the winter."

E30,2mckz0,Tim_WithEightVowels,1 point,Sun Nov 16 02:04:22 2014 UTC,"I would if that project would ever quit killing my soul... After changing the head to a rebuilt head it has no oil pressure so I'm pretty sure that it needs an oil pump.  Honestly I'm going to concede, pull the trim, take the wheels and then sell the car and let it torture someone else. Im going to switch the convertible trim with the flares and bumpers off the Ix which I love the styling of. Then I'm wanting to find a pre 73 2002 to work on while I drive my convertible. If only 2002's weren't impossible to find for a decent price in kc, especially a pre 1973."
E30,2mckz0,rustede30,2,Sun Nov 16 02:31:53 2014 UTC,"Oh man, I love 2002's. But the e30 has a good mix of modern features and classic style in my opinion.  That sucks, I'm really starting to like my 325ix. I know the oil pump is in a different position on the IX, but are the oil pumps themselves different? Do you know how hard it is to find one?   I'm actually just starting a big project on my e30. I'll probably end up replacing all the hoses, belts, seals, brakes lines, and rubber boots. It seems to run, I just hope there's nothing seriously wrong with it."
E30,2mckz0,Tim_WithEightVowels,2,Sun Nov 16 02:45:57 2014 UTC,"They are different, I found some but they come from Germany. It's only $80 shipped. But in order to pull the oil pan you need to basically disassemble the entire front of the car before you can even see whats really wrong. It's not a common issue, or at least it's not from what I've heard.   Truthfully I would fix it if I had the space but I only have the space for one project and with being a full time student I just don't have the time to just knock it out over a weekend. Really though if I were going to go that far into the engine I would just go for broke and rebuild it so I could go forced induction. But I want a 2002 and only have the space for one project and money for less than that. Also the ix is an auto while my vert is a stick.  If your timing belt hasn't been changed in a while that's more important than any hose or boot on your car. That's what initially happened to my ix (or so I was told). These are interference motors so if a timing belt breaks at speed your gonna have a lot bigger issues. While you're changing the timing belt you should change the water pump also if it's been a while, they're only thirty bucks and you're already there. While you're doing that you can delete the fan in favor of an electric fan so you can get a few hp while you're there. And then you can start your car and find out you have no oil reaching your head, FML! (You only do the last one if you have bad luck)"
E30,2mckz0,rustede30,1 point,Sun Nov 16 03:10:07 2014 UTC,"That's not too bad. I'll have to keep that in mind if I decide to do the steering rack and oil pan gasket.  Yeah, that's what I'm planning on doing next. I actually pulled the timing cover off today. Thankfully everything is in one piece, Lol. My last e30 was a 325is, and the timing belt was floating to one side of the pulley and had rubbed against the cover. It chewed away all but 30% of the timing belt. There was timing belt dust everywhere. I was so unbelievably lucky, I had to drive it 70+ miles a day for work."

E30,2m83uf,Sharino,2,Fri Nov 14 06:01:19 2014 UTC,Its the 6 cyl engine from a E34 M5. Its what the S14 (E30 M3) engine was derived from.
E30,2m83uf,rustede30,1 point,Fri Nov 14 13:17:06 2014 UTC,The s14 was derived from the m10.
E30,2m83uf,Sharino,1 point,Sat Nov 15 09:11:29 2014 UTC,Yes and No. It is more M88/S38 than it is M10 though
E30,2m83uf,rustede30,1 point,Sun Nov 16 05:05:34 2014 UTC,Is that why the s14 head can be put on an m10?

E30,2m83uf,protomor,1 point,Fri Nov 14 12:46:14 2014 UTC,how is the ls2 compared to a turbo m20 or m50 or s50 if uve done one of those
E30,2m83uf,N8bro,1 point,Fri Nov 14 20:48:38 2014 UTC,The turbo M20 with a small turbo was a freaking blast. Baseline M50 was there but boring. It felt like what an M20 NA should feel like. The S52 out of the box was awesome for anyone who just streets their car and wants some fun. The S52 turbo was an absolute MONSTER but had nothing but turbo lag/punch.  The LS2 feels like home. Power everywhere and factory reliability. Much easier to take care of than the S52 turbo and actually feels faster despite being 100whp less.
E30,2m83uf,protomor,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:50:36 2014 UTC,very interesting. would u recommend doing a turbo m20 build or s52 swap for street and autocross fun for a first timer? or an m30?
E30,2m83uf,N8bro,1 point,Fri Nov 14 23:33:34 2014 UTC,"Fuck M30s. Too much work for a heavy motor with not much more power. If you aren't very savvy with car stuff, I'd go with the S52 swap since it's so tried and true at this point. M20 turbo would probably more fun all around and more fun to tinker with but then again, it will require more tinkering than the S52.   As far as which is better for the street or autox, Depends on how you do the turbo. The S52 probably would be easier to drive but turbos are just so much fun.   Again, if you don't want to fuck with too much stuff, go S52. If you don't mind tinkering more, go turbo M20."
E30,2m83uf,protomor,1 point,Fri Nov 14 23:53:44 2014 UTC,whats the best turbo for 8-14 lbs of boost?
E30,2m83uf,N8bro,1 point,Sat Nov 15 01:06:20 2014 UTC,I have a fondness for the new EFR series turbos since they have built in wastegates/bovs and other stuff. They get pricey though.

E30,2m2eve,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Nov 12 14:32:06 2014 UTC,"It depends on the job. There's some stuff on the e30 that is a royal pain, but most jobs are simple. A 5 speed swap is dead simple on the e30 & a diff swap is too. Personally, I'd consider dumping the M20 at the same time. 24v swaps are simple, lower maintenance (no timing belt, no valve adjustments, no barn door AFM, etc), more economical, and more powerful."
E30,2m2eve,I_AM_MartyMcfly_AMA,3,Wed Nov 12 21:37:07 2014 UTC,"Despite what you hear, the M20B25 engine does not suffer from head gasket failure. It suffers from either corroded block faces due to lack of coolant changes, or a cracked head between cylinders 5 and 6. 95% of the time, if you find mayo under the oil cap, a head gasket swap won't fix it.  This car has had a cheap respray at some point, evidenced by the red paint on the under-bonnet sound proofing and on the coolant pipes. It may look clean, but I would be extremely suspicious of the quality of repair work done on the rest of the car based on that.  As others have said, body condition is everything. Check for wet footwells and trunk pockets, and be prepared to walk away if you find dampness in those areas.  The wobbling gauges is simply a loose brass nut on the back of the cluster that needs to be tightened. A nut on the other side will make the temp guage wobble."
E30,2m2eve,Grrrmachine,1 point,Wed Nov 12 21:01:51 2014 UTC,"Ok so I have that mayo/milkshake stuff on the head of my 325es, I've changed the head gasket twice and have done a oil and coolant flush about 3-4 times I was going to resurface the head but what do you think would be problem that the engine is having?"
E30,2m2eve,Narek_S,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:43:28 2014 UTC,"325es isn't the M20B25, fortunately and unfortunately. The weak point in the M20B25 is the head (series 885) which cracks when it overheats. The 731 head used on your M20B27 is a bit more robust, although it stifles gas flow as a result.  When you take the head off again, any pitting on either the head or the block should be clearly visible. If you find it you'll need to get it resurfaced, but it's also worth having the head pressure-tested to confirm that it's not cracked."

H&R sport springs if you want it a bit softer (If you're doing 95% street driving, these should be your choice). I have the H&R Cup Kit (sport version) in my car right now and it's too low. Ride quality is nice and it's not too bad on the track though with IS front sway and iX rear sway (read: Plenty of rotation!).   The IE Stage3 springs are the equivalent height to the cup kit but stiffer, so I can't recommend those if you have some big obstacles to clear. They're also lower than the H&R race springs.  As /u/tokentallguy has suggested, you can also install E90 drop hats if you want a bit more forward rake in your setup."

I was thinking about H&R Super Sport springs, for that extra low without the firmness of race springs. But I'm still a tad uncertain.   I'm not planning on taking this thing to the track or racing all that much. So would super sports be my best bet? Or should I stick with just regular Sport Springs."
E30,2ly5ji,karmat0se,1 point,Wed Nov 12 02:08:47 2014 UTC,"I think the Super Sport springs will be just fine. I have the 2.1""f/1.7""r drop with my cup kit (probably lower now that it's all settled over a few years) and it's never the rear I'm worried about. I love how the car looks on the low springs, but if I was going to do it again (and I am, soon... but probably Ground Control stuff), I'd probably go with H&R Race springs and Billstein Sport inserts just so I have to worry less. The IE S3 springs are a really nice option though.  Potholes don't scare me, it's the speed bumps. My BavAuto headers hang low."

That thing is very unloved and heavily used, and despite what the seller states it has NOT been maintained by a BMW mechanic. It probably saw a decent independent to have the head swapped, but that's it.  No mention of any suspension or bush repairs being done to compensate for the bad brakes. The bodywork is tatty and there WILL be rust lurking, probably in the front footwells and rear arches. That paint will not polish back to a shine, and the Aircon repairs will be extensive (expect to replace some rusty pipes, the receiver/drier and most of the gaskets as well as the dead compressor).  In all honesty, I wouldn't touch that with a barge pole. It's a $1000 car at best."

E30,2lwqk8,hbrewitt,2,Tue Nov 11 00:38:02 2014 UTC,"Something will come up, personally I spent just over 8months searching for mine.  Keep that 3k tucked away and keep an eye out."
E30,2lwqk8,dtaivp,2,Tue Nov 11 01:10:21 2014 UTC,"I am going to agree with /u/Grrrmachine here. I bought a car that was in nearly similar shape, and have put $700 into it so far in repairs. I bought mine for $1000 though so I would say it was worth it (also did the repairs myself).  Some things to look out for when buying one of these cars...   The odo gears break, and if they haven't broken yet they likely will shortly. Replacing the gears involves removing the gauge cluster, which in turn involves removing the dash. The gears are cheap but it is a deal of work.  The blower only works on full or off. This is the blower resistor. Pretty easy fix if you know how to use a wrench. I think it is labeled as a level 3 or 4 on pelican parts. (Meaning not very difficult)  Oil pan gasket. Not sure if this applies the the 318i, but for the 325i and is this is a big one. These have a tendency of leaking, and replacing it isn't for the faint of heart (involves either jacking the engine up or dropping the subframe) look to make sure oil isn't leaking around it.  Tie rods and control arms. These go out on any older car, so if they have been replaced already consider yourself lucky. And by go out I mean the dust boot breaks and needs to be replaced. Probably would cost $150-$250 to replace yourself.  The valve cover breather hose should probably be replaced if it hasn't already been. Costs like $25 and is pretty easy to replace.  Fuel level senders have a tendency of breaking pretty easily resulting in the tank always reading full or empty, you have to remove the back seat to replace them and they are fairly expensive to replace. The MAF gets gunned up easily causing some weird starting issues occasionally. You can check and see if the MAF is causing issues by unplugging the sensor, and seeing if the problem persists.    Those are just a few of the most common repairs on these cars I have noticed. Hope this helps a bit on your search. I know I wished I had a bit more knowledge before I bought mine."

E30,2lvgrq,ggill1313,1 point,Tue Nov 11 07:53:03 2014 UTC,"I stripped my rear seat and added a roll bar.  A feq quick tips:   Your roll bar literally holds your life if used.  Spend the money and have a reputable cage builder make it for you.  I got mine fabricated for 500$, custom made at a shop that specializes in cages for dirt track/late model racecars.  They lowered the price a bit as I stripped my back seat and trunk myself.  I went for a 4 point cage with harness bar using DOM tubing.  It made a huge difference in the dynamics of the car too.  Chassis is much more rigid now.  I've posted the car in this r/BMW before, if you have any questions shoot me a message.  Remember if you plan to track it-it must pass the broomstick test."

E30,2lvs6o,Dzdimi14,2,Mon Nov 10 18:42:32 2014 UTC,"I've bought new rotors and pads from my local O'reilly auto. Been fine.   However, if you want drilled or slotted rotors, you'll have to order them.   If I can't find parts in stock there (or don't like their price), I usually order from Autohausaz.com or Bavarian Autosport, but partsgeek.com or rockauto.com are just fine as well.   Really, you'll probably be fine wherever you buy from. Just make sure you seat your brakes correctly so you don't overheat them."
E30,2lvs6o,beefcakez,5,Mon Nov 10 20:59:51 2014 UTC,"It's worth pointing out that drilled and slotted rotors are utterly redundant on a stock E30, to the point of being a downgrade. Drilled rotors are more prone to cracking in extreme heat, while the standard vented discs with a good street/race pad will provide all the braking you'll ever need for an M20B25."

Unless you're doing serious wheel to wheel racing, the low mass and relatively low top speed of a stock E30 is easy to stop with stock brakes.  ATE Typ 200 and its blue brother Super Blue are what I use for fluid."

It looks like it's running a RRFPR with factory management, plus the welding is horrid and overall it's not a vehicle I'd touch without a sizeable budget. I also doubt that it has a ""large case"" 4.10 - probably a medium case which is bolt-in. Anyone looking at this would be better off buying a stock 318i and starting from scratch.

That's on top of all the maintenance that's clearly been missed. That thing will need a timing belt and water pump ASAP, the rear beam bushes will be shot, and it WILL have rust in either the rear arches, front footwells or the bulkhead (or all three).

It looks good to me, save for the rust, but I don't think you'll find a better one in your geographical area for the price. Those rusted areas are notorious on E30's and you can replace that with some sheet metal and a mig.   I'm doing the r134a changeover now and that alone is nearly $1k if you buy all new parts (my compressor died).   Anyway, it looks like a pretty good deal to me."

What I have decided I am going to do is fix up the one I just got, and if I like it enough after a few months I will give it a swap, otherwise I will sell it and get one that is manual.   Have to say despite it being automatic it is still one hell of a car to drive. That being said though I wouldn't drop more then 2k on an automatic. Mine was $1500, I put $500 in the way of parts in, and now it is in nearly perfect condition."

I bought the 325 IS (so it's a 4 speed) off the original owner and it was well cared for and rust free. Every so often I really get an itch for it to be a manual, and I think about converting it, but I've never found a suitable reasonably priced donor.

E30,2l4k5i,dbainerr,3,Mon Nov 3 03:34:29 2014 UTC,"Sounds like the seller is honest and knowledgeable.  Rare to come by. He also posted that car on bcbimmers.   From what I'm reading, he's done a huge amount of work to get the major issues sorted. The list of work to do is minute in comparison.   I mean, he's sorted the suspension,  the shifter bushings,  timing belt and done an ignition refresh. That's huge. You can go ahead and find a 3k e30, but by spending maybe 1.5k more off the bat here, you get what sounds like a well sorted car with tasteful upgrades.  In my opinion,  it would be worth checking out. Obviously you can attempt to negotiate."
E30,2l4k5i,messier_is_ok,3,Mon Nov 3 03:58:08 2014 UTC,"People pay far too much attention to the miles on the clock. On a 25+ year old car this number is irrelevant, especially on an old BMW.  Far more important is the service history, documenting that all the rubber parts (pipes, bushes and belts) have been changed, which is the case with this car. The important thing is the timing belt, but the sump gasket, gear shifter  and rear beam repairs are also good as they're a PITA to do on these cars.   Ask whether the LSD was rebuilt before fitting, as it's highly unlikely the clutch packs still work after two decades. Also why the spark plugs weren't changed when the distributor cap was, as it's been 40,000km. Critically, you need to assess the bodywork and knock off $200 for each body panel that has a dent, scratch or rust patch on it, as body repairs are expensive. Check out the Rust list so that you know the common rot points on these cars; don't be afraid to get on your knees and poke underneath.  I can't comment on North American prices as they're insane from a European perspective, but that one is owned (or maintained) by someone who clearly understands these cars."

E30,2l4k5i,FistingMona,1 point,Mon Nov 3 19:53:02 2014 UTC,"depends how much you drive it, I suppose. The $2000 dollar price difference on the car means that us Europeans can drive 12,500 miles further before the more expensive fuel hits our wallet ($5.7 a gallon in Poland, compared to $3 in the US).  Or to look at it the other way, an American buyer is effectively getting 47 free fill-ups with this purchase :D"

E30,2kzh3l,androoew,5,Sat Nov 1 16:14:04 2014 UTC,"This car is way out of the league of a beginner. You have to fit and install a motor that's never been heard running (and therefore you can't easily diagnose running issues), and you have to fix all the problems that come for a car that hasn't run for 13 years; completely perished pipes, hoses and suspension bushes, potentially rotten and split fuel tank, plus dried out and and corroded electrical connections.  Presumably you don't have a full set of tools for this job, or much of a budget to buy them. Because of this, I really wouldn't recommend it for a first-time wrencher."
E30,2kzh3l,Grrrmachine,2,Sat Nov 1 19:45:27 2014 UTC,"I've posted here before (didn't get the previous E30 I posted), but I still haven't jumped on the BMW train. I really want one since I think it'd make for a good car, and a great learning experience. With that being said, I'm a seventeen-year-old who doesn't know how to drive stick, and doesn't have a steady source of income. I'm willing to learn, and get a job, and yadda yadda to maintain an E30 though. To cut to the chase, I'm asking if this is a good first car for me, and if someone like myself--with zero experience in any mechanic work (or cars in general)--could get it up and running quick."
E30,2kzh3l,following_eyes,4,Sat Nov 1 16:20:06 2014 UTC,"If you have someone knowledgeable who can help you I would say yes and isn't too much of a challenge. But a few parts on these cars can still get spendy compared to cheaper used cars out there.  That's a fairly decent starting price for that car. I'd question the 100k original miles part, but it's not impossible.  It's not the more desirable 325i therefore most folks aren't as interested.  If he can tell you when the timing belt was changed then that would be a plus. If he has maintenance records going back years, that's also a plus. If he doesn't the price is too high. Rust will be a pain, but where you are unless you had a garage, you'd just have to deal with it.  I don't recommend this as a first car for someone who doesn't currently have income flow or some basic maintenance experience.  It's a good first BMW, because it doesn't have all the electronic bullshit on the newer cars(expensive fixes), but I'm not sure it's a great first car if it needs work or will need it in the near future.  Best of luck. Go check out r3vlimited.com Good group of folks there too."
E30,2kzh3l,following_eyes,2,Sat Nov 1 17:16:27 2014 UTC,"Decided against getting it. Many thanks. Can I ask why a 325i is more desirable? Is it just a better engine, or what? I found a nice 325e (which would be good on gas), so I'm wondering what the noticeable differences are for someone who doesn't spend too much time under the hood."
E30,2kzh3l,Cyrix2k,3,Sat Nov 1 17:42:50 2014 UTC,325i has more horsepower and is a sportier drive. It is also typically is better equipped. The 325e or eta is economical but not by a significant amount. It does put down more torque. However they also don't have great resell value. Same engine in both with slight mods to create more power or economy. In the long run 325i is going to be more fun. If you could find  91 318is those are a four cylinder and are a blast plus have economy.
E30,2kzh3l,following_eyes,0,Sat Nov 1 18:19:36 2014 UTC,"325e > 318i ALL DAY LONG.  As noted, 325i's come better equipped and late models have plastic bumpers. The HP deficit isn't a problem in normal driving - in fact, the 325e feels faster due to it's superior torque - and the e is FAR more economical, 10+ mpg better on back roads depending on driving style. If the stock motor isn't doing it for you, a 7k rev limit is only a head swap away which is dead simple on an M20. With a head swap, you wind up with a 2.7L vs the 2.5L displacement of the 325i. And because early models aren't as well equipped and have less crap on them, they're lighter. Finally, the 325e engine is GREAT for boost if you ever decide to go that route. I also prefer the early design to the late with euro bumpers, but that's me. I recommend avoiding the 318i. I've never driven an M10 car, but the M42 is a gutless POS that also lacks the I6 charm. FWIW, I currently own a 1985 325e & a 1991 318i. I've had the 325e in stock form, with a turbo, and now it has an M50 and a turbo. The 318i was purchased to be swapped and currently has an M50, but I experienced it stock."
E30,2kzh3l,Cyrix2k,0,Sun Nov 9 00:56:30 2014 UTC,I wouldn't recommend any 318i. Only 318is. There's a reason people like it. It's incredibly well balanced. 318is > 325e when it comes to the overall driving experience.
E30,2kzh3l,following_eyes,1 point,Sun Nov 9 01:06:13 2014 UTC,318is has the same motor which is a total dog. I was looking at them to swap.
E30,2kzh3l,Cyrix2k,1 point,Sun Nov 9 04:36:48 2014 UTC,"M42 is not a total dog. It's a high revving engine. If you don't push it, then it won't give you as much as it can. Put a chip and you add more power in 1st and 2nd and boom you've got a car that's fun to drive around town. Having a ton of speed doesn't always improve the driving experience. Good handling and the ability to maintain speed through a corner does, and the 318is is a perfect example of a well balanced car, certainly moreso than a 325e. Plus a 325e in most cases is rocking diving boards and I think we can all agree those suck."
E30,2kzh3l,thehazydriver,1 point,Sun Nov 9 06:06:34 2014 UTC,"M42s are dogs, doesn't matter what the engine speed is. I've owned an M42, own an M44, and have driven many others. They're SLOW (and mine was chipped FYI). The 325e is only better in stock form because it can cruise comfortably and accelerate without down shifting. It also has more potential for improvement whereas it's hard to get much more output from the 4 banger. And yes, diving boards are a crime against humanity. I like the early tail lights and rear quarters better than the late model cars though, plus early cars get pop out rear windows."

However, it could be a TPS issue as well; at closed throttle, the TPS sends a signal to the ICV to open, close, etc.   Anyway, I'd check this article by Pelican:  BMW E30 3 Series Idle Speed Troubleshooting  Also, just a pro-tip: drill a small hole in the center of your TPS to let the oil accumulation drain. Those things will fill up with oil and won't make the electrical connections."

I haven't tested the voltage yet, but the car does eventually idle steadily, I just have to give it throttle to 1,000rpm or so for 10 seconds or so first, then once I back off it settles into an idle.

Also doesn't help that I was working from home when I bought the car, then immediately had to take a job with a 70 mile daily commute.  It is very rewarding when it isn't pissing me off lol"
E30,2kogmr,rustede30,2,Thu Nov 6 21:49:25 2014 UTC,thank god for posts like this. Was so close to buying an uber clean 318is as a first and only car DD. Im only 22 and mechanically limited. I fell in love with the car on the test drive but ultimately it didnt make sense. Maybe one day

If not for living with an independent BMW mechanic and having hookups from working at two different local BMW racing shops I would have never considered buying an E30."

Either a really nice single color engine bay or something like graffiti.  For the motor I'm kind of torn. If I had an unlimited budget I'd go for something insane, like a forced induction v8. With a realistic budget I'd want a b27 bottom a b25 top end running something like 8-12 pounds of boost. Maybe just a carborated m20.

E30,2kogmr,protomor,2,Wed Oct 29 16:06:58 2014 UTC,No fair. Your car is badass!   Are those rear quarters riveted on? So you can easily replace/remove them when they get smashed up?
E30,2kogmr,I_AM_MartyMcfly_AMA,3,Wed Oct 29 16:12:19 2014 UTC,Yes they are riveted on. It's not specifically so I can replace them when they get smashed up. It's because that's how they came lol. I'd actually much rather have a bolt on rear quarter but that's not really possible since it's part of the unibody.

E30,2kogmr,protomor,1 point,Fri Nov 14 04:00:43 2014 UTC,The rears? Drilled and pop rivets hold them on. I'm sure you can do sexier ways but I need to be able to get them off when I crash.   Rear tires are currently 245s running a 17x9 et 20 with 25mm spacers. But I've run 255s on stock arches with just a fender roll. I bet I could fit up to a 295 as it sits now.
E30,2kk23m,Alexander_u,3,Tue Oct 28 10:43:36 2014 UTC,Those are the first aftermarket wheels I've seen in a LONG time that look good on an E30. Good choice.
E30,2kk23m,Grrrmachine,1 point,Tue Oct 28 16:28:14 2014 UTC,The RS wheel has been around since the dawn of mankind; as a style it's gone in and out of fashion at least three times during the E30's lifetime. And I'm not a big fan of it; it's unnecessarily complex for a basketweave wheel. The BBS Mahle or plain old RZ give a much cleaner look.

You can buy new parts.   The thing that fell out is part no 10 & 11  http://www.realoem.com/bmw/diagrams/p/t/2.png  It's what holds your brake shoe so it doesn't twist or rub against the spinning hub.
E30,2kl35f,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Oct 28 18:10:49 2014 UTC,AC tensioner. I have never seen one before.

E30,2kl35f,Grrrmachine,2,Tue Oct 28 19:53:06 2014 UTC,"The part that popped out is the handbrake shoe retaining pin, and its tension spring. The reason it's loose is that your backing plate has rusted out around that hole.  The complex fix is to fit a new backplate, which are very expensive and require you to destroy and fit a new wheel bearing. The easy fix is to use a lockheed washer to buy you a few more years of handbrake use. Follow this guide for more info.  As for the green stuff, this is leaking out of your AC compressor. Your AC system uses a special oil (usually PAG-46) to keep the AC compressor lubricated, and this often contains a dye to make leaks easy to spot. It seems that the dye is doing the job it was intended to do, and that you need to start looking for a new compressor.  In this case, it's worth finding out if your aircon system is the original R12 gas system, or the newer R134a, as the compressors aren't really interchangeable."

E30,2ki2uc,beefcakez,2,Mon Oct 27 21:14:25 2014 UTC,It will be and feel much quicker. The diff won't give you rpms. It will give you faster acceleration at the expense of top speed. Figure out also if it is an lsd or not.
E30,2ki2uc,Cyrix2k,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:17:20 2014 UTC,"Well, you bought the right car to learn on. The E30 is basically a lego of sorts.   As for these prices, they're pretty good. I'm going to do a M50 swap next summer. I'll be gathering the parts over the winter and prepping the body for new paint as well.   If you're interested in the M50 swap, I'd check out Protomor's post (he sent this to me yesterday). He's one of the guru's of engine swaps across the whole interwebz.

It's a great engine and working through the electrical gremlins will teach you everything necessary to get started.   Just buy the Bentley Manual and get to work!"

E30,2ki2uc,username2110,1 point,Tue Oct 28 16:06:26 2014 UTC,"The 4.10 diff is really short, so your the engine will be at really high rpm's at highway speed. I don't know what your goals are, or what diffs your cars already have, but personally I'd avoid the 4.10.  The 1995 M50s are the M50TUB25s, (TU stands for technical update), meaning it has the VANOS system. This is BMW's variable valve timing technology. It's not a bad thing, but I understand it is prone to failure depending on the milage and needs to be rebuilt. This is something you should consider.   Definitely check out r3vlimited, and e30tech for more information. They are the best sources of information."

Everything is there and it's a Vanos, making me think it's been swapped in there before (Vanos came out in93).   Looks like it would be the perfect candidate for my first (of potentially many) motor swaps. Maybe even a 2.9 or 3.0 stroker build (if I have any money).   My M20 is great, but since I commute 70 miles a day (all highway) I need something with better gas mileage. Plus, it's a lot easier to build on a M50 for more power than an M20."
E30,2kdngm,protomor,4,Sun Oct 26 16:32:19 2014 UTC,"Definitely a vanos. You can tell by the bump on the front of the valve cover.  Do a compression check. It'll work fine for a swap though.

E30,2k8o8w,beefcakez,2,Fri Oct 24 23:25:07 2014 UTC,It's kinda dark right now to take pictures but no they don't.

E30,2k8o8w,HighClassProletariat,1 point,Sat Oct 25 00:11:31 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure when they switched from the chrome bumpers to the plastic bumpers in 89 the brackets changed as well. I know there are write ups on how to do alter the brackets to make it work on some of the E30 forums online.
E30,2k8o8w,beefcakez,3,Sat Oct 25 02:08:10 2014 UTC,"My bad. I forgot that the convertibles didn't get a facelift to the plastic bumpers until 1990.   http://www.e30ic.com/mydiff.htm  The regular 325 and 318 cars got the facelift in 1987.   My mistake. I had to do a little digging. I'm not terribly familiar with the convertibles.   I thought he was just confusing the bumpers or something. Yeah, the brackets completely changed. The valances between the models are different so the mounting locations and brackets are all completely different as well."

E30,2k7o1s,SoundByte,2,Fri Oct 24 18:19:08 2014 UTC,I'm mixed. I hear it can hold moisture to the metal and make it rust faster. But the heat properties seem very useful. Ceramic coating would be best but that's much more money.

My general way of doing things is to add up what he has into the car and subtract a depreciation amount.   I recently sold my S52 91 with shit paint. I wound up getting less than half of what he's asking. Even had a GC coilover kit and lots of similar goodies.   I'd give him 7k honestly. I'm in the US too. Was just in dallas a bit ago.

Check the history of the vehicle. If it's been in Cali all its life you shouldn't have to worry about rust.   Overall, just from the pictures it looks like a pretty good deal. Looks like a fairly good condition, unmolested, E30.   Although, always trust your judgement, and definitely haggle. Always haggle price ;)"
E30,2k22tu,beefcakez,1 point,Thu Oct 23 02:54:23 2014 UTC,Agreed haggling is fantastic. Saved $400 on my e30. Point out the cars faults (if it has any that is) use anything you can to your advantage.

E30,2jzwlj,FunkyKitty,14,Wed Oct 22 14:54:04 2014 UTC,"Good gracious. If you have some simple hand tools you can do most of that yourself, if not all of it.   A hood strut is cheap. Like $15 dollars cheap.   For $800, I'd upgrade the steering rack to a quick turn ratio one from an M3 (e36 or e46) or Z3. Otherwise, you can find a refurbed one for cheaper, put on new tie rods and have it aligned for less than that.   Here's a refurbed quick ratio rack ($468 including $275 core charge). Stock e30 racks are 4.0 lock-to-lock, this one is 2.7 turns.   There are some really good DIY's out there for E30 clutch replacement. You can find an entire clutch kit for a few hundred dollars.   Definitely look at what /u/choppysmash said about prioritizing your work.   However, the steering rack parts would be my first thing as it's a matter of safety.   Then, I'd probably do the clutch.   The other stuff is cheap and easy so you can do them whenever."
E30,2jzwlj,beefcakez,3,Wed Oct 22 15:27:26 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to add, here's a DIY on the steering rack. The author thinks the whole swap can be done for ~$450, but that was in 2006. Still you should be able to complete this project in the $500-600 range easily.   Otherwise /u/beefcakes is right, most of the things on the list are easy to do yourself. Good luck!"
E30,2jzwlj,dermau5,3,Wed Oct 22 16:47:51 2014 UTC,"I did my Z3 rack swap for about $400 in 2012. That was with new lemforder inner/outer e36 tie rods, used low KM Z3 rack in good shape, rack spacers, and a Condor Speed Shop alu ps delete block.   Just be vigilant on ebay and you will find a deal on the rack itself. I bought mine from a scrapper with no core charge. This hands down was the best of many modifications I've done to my car since I bought it."
E30,2jzwlj,karmat0se,3,Wed Oct 22 18:00:02 2014 UTC,"This swap is now heavily out of date. Any E46 rack can be used (which are newer are therefore more reliable than an old E36 rack) and ALL that is needed is two 14mm spacers - you can use steel washers if you're cheap. Re-use the E30 tie rods, bend one hose gently and freshen up the crush washers, and you're good to go. I didn't even need to modify the steering linkage.  Total cost for my swap was the rack, which was about $40."
E30,2jzwlj,Grrrmachine,2,Wed Oct 22 19:38:33 2014 UTC,Commenting so I can come back to this. will likely replace my rack when I go to replace the dash...
E30,2jzwlj,dtaivp,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:33:07 2014 UTC,"I did the E36 rack swap for under $100 including fluid, a new reservoir, and the E30tech spacer kit."
E30,2jzwlj,SoundByte,4,Thu Oct 23 00:24:39 2014 UTC,Is the steering fucked up or the power steering just not work?  My power steering failed before I bought the car and I'm not sure now if I want power steering.  When I got new tires the car became much easier to turn.  I'd start with the clutch if it were me.  And the oil change...that's pretty cheap.
E30,2jzwlj,joshamania,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:36:58 2014 UTC,"The rack works it's just leaking fluid, probably a seal."

E30,2jzwlj,choppysmash,1 point,Thu Oct 23 05:39:29 2014 UTC,"That seems awful expensive for a hood strut. And that can be done easily by yourself with some pliers and a screw driver. And does that say $5000 or $50 for the exhaust? What's wrong with the exhaust and the power steering?  Is this a daily driver or a weekend fun car?  Depending on your budget the clutch and steering rack seem to be the most important things as far as being able to drive the car. Exhaust should be done if that is something you need to pass an inspection to register it.  Did you just buy the car or have you had it a while? Knowing the history of the car, the reason you need those things on your list (how bad are they worn/broken) and what you want to get out of the car will help determine what you should prioritize."

E30,2jzdgz,VainRib,3,Wed Oct 22 11:02:53 2014 UTC,"The price itself is high, but that's what you pay for in the Australian market unfortunately. Good clean shells are very rare in your part of the world.  Ask the seller what happened to the front foglights, and whether any work has been done on the engine (chain tensioner, upper and lower sump gaskets) - if the answer is no then the price needs to come down. You also need to know whether the aircon uses R12 or R134a, and if it holds a charge, because a black car with black leather seats and no aircon will be absolutely hell.  If it's had an engine swap then what gearbox is being used? Was the cooling system (radiator/hoses) replaced at the same time? What ratio diff is fitted? Where did those ugly wing mirrors come from, and what brand are the aftermarket rear lights? How old are the tyres?  I think the price was originally high because the joker thought all that bolt-on bullshit made the car more valuable, but check with your insurer that the M42 engine is a declared swap as the power increase (132hp from 110hp) may affect your premium."

E30,2julhn,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:18:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, it's a little work, but hardly any more than doing a replacement so long as you're handy with some tools and know a little about welding (or have a friend).   I know I don't want to drill spot welds ever again, at least not on the radiator support. This will be much better. I can modify a separate rad support to fit the new mounting holes and brackets I built.   I don't recommend doing it if you don't have a separate vehicle. I've had my car since 2007 and didn't buy another vehicle until 2012. The E30 sat for a year before I even drove it again (had crapped out which is why I bought my truck).   Yeah, the A/C system was a little pricey. I wanted to do a full R134a conversion so I had to buy everything new.   I didn't buy a new evaporator but I might need to. So far, the a/c system has cost me $450 in parts. I don't have the vacuum pump so I'll just take it to a shop to charge the system. That'll probably be another hundred or so.   I also plan to route the A/C lines through the fender so I'll be making custom lines as well. It's only money ;)"

It's gonna be painful if the love of my life doesn't at least understand, lol.  That is definitely a hell of a drive. Mine does 80 miles round trip. For two years, so far so good. It wears tires pretty nasty though, so I'm glad you're taking care of the camber. Just had to replace wheel bearings too. But I've got no doubt that the M20 can handle your commute!

E30,2jss79,StanleyTheGrown,5,Mon Oct 20 16:55:24 2014 UTC,/r/BMW   Why do you want an E30? They are old high mileage cars that required more maintenance than other brands even when new.
E30,2jss79,Sir_not_sir,3,Mon Oct 20 17:00:41 2014 UTC,"If you find the right one yes, but most will need alot of work. I paid 2000$ us and it need many many many parts to sort it out as well as many hours into it that if I couldn't do it myself would have cost way too much."
E30,2jss79,Thelazywaffleman,4,Mon Oct 20 17:10:10 2014 UTC,"E30s aren't that terrible to maintain, but you absolutely should be willing to do some basic mechanical work on it.   If you want a car that you can forget about maintaining, Toyotas are perfect."
E30,2jss79,messier_is_ok,3,Mon Oct 20 18:14:48 2014 UTC,"I just want an E30 that drives and don't need that much maintenance.   Anything you find for under 6k will need ongoing maintenance, some of it likely not trivial, and since you don't want to do that yourself, it'll cost you a ton of money.  I suggest looking at VW's built after 2005, perhaps a Golf or Jetta."
E30,2jss79,FF0000it,2,Mon Oct 20 17:47:36 2014 UTC,"E30s are great for learning mechanics and cars in general, but that's if you're willing to invest time into it.  If you're looking for something with low maintenance, you should probably search for something a little newer.  Every car has problems, and older cars can have tons of them.    While E30s have a good reputation for being durable, you'd still be buying a car that is at best over 20 years old, so keep that in mind."
E30,2jss79,kraguna,2,Mon Oct 20 17:15:54 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of blah blah blah here about don't do it and all that...do not listen.  Get an e30.  Will there be problems?  Yes.  Will it be worth it?  Also yes.  Just make sure you get one that starts easily.  There's nothing more shit than a car that won't start in the winter.  Other than that, save yourself about 2000 for new tires and do the timing belt/tensioner/water pump first thing...and whatever else seems needful on purchase.  Yes there will be maintenance and quirks, but if you do that timing belt up front there's not much to worry about.  If you want to be cheap and work on it yourself, they're easy to work on.  There's also a TON of videos on Youtube and etc because of the popularity of the car.  If you're going to have a car you have to work on yourself, an e30 is a good choice.  Parts are cheap and plentiful and there's a lot of public knowledge about how to work on them.  If you get someone else to do maintenance, it's not really going to cost you any more than a 10 year old car unless you miss some catastrophe at purchase.  Parts for my 1986 325es are slightly cheaper than they were for my 2002 Jetta.  Tires are WAY cheaper.  I recommend an ES model if you can find one.  Not sure of the badging in Europe, probably the same...economy-sport or some such nonsense.  Being an ES, it's probably not as thrashed as an i, it gets brilliant gas mileage and it's still a lot of fun to drive.  The E models...automatic transmission...are to be avoided.  The ES is a manual and makes a fantastic daily driver.  Today I drove 300 miles in my 28 year old car (that I paid $400 for 13 months ago) and it cost me all of about $35 in gasoline.  If I'm nice to it I can average about 35-40mpg."
E30,2jss79,joshamania,2,Mon Oct 20 22:19:56 2014 UTC,"Go buy a Honda and be done with it. You either need a mechanical inclination or $ to keep a 25-30 year old car reliable.  I'm joking about the honda. Sounds like something newer is a better option for you, whatever make it may be."
E30,2jss79,Cat4lyst,1 point,Mon Oct 20 23:21:18 2014 UTC,"Not sure what the local car market looks like for used e30s in your country but I would think that you could find one in great shape for around 6000.Anything you buy should be  taken to a competent mechanic for an inspection before you pay for it. Things to look for are maintenance records (complete and showing the major services), rust in the rear wheel wells (you have to pull out the battery and pull up the carpet), and how the electrical connectors are doing (made by Bosch and prone to dry rot)."

E30,2jss79,tvrdloch,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:02:18 2014 UTC,"A lot of the advice you get here will be from Americans, who are not aware of how cheap E30s are in Europe. 6000 Euros should buy you a very good E30 in most European countries.  However, these are old cars AND they are BMWs. That means they require regular maintenance - you cannot ""just"" drive them without doing something mechanical every six months. If your budget is 6000 Euro, then buy something for 4000 and expect to pay for some work within the first year. That work may be brakes, suspension, rubber bushes, or even some welding (E30s rust in hard-to-see areas).  Also, if you are a first-time driver, I do NOT recommend an E30. They are light, fast, RWD cars with no modern assistance mechanisms (no airbags, no traction control, very few even have ABS and the power steering is verrrry sloooooow). If you learned to drive in a Nissan Micra or a Toyota Yaris, then it will be a VERY different car for you to drive.  If you are not a mechanic, don't buy an old car - it is a very expensive lesson."
E30,2jss79,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:43:00 2014 UTC,"First, thank you very much for the answers! You really helped me out. I am a little further with my decision but not done yet. I'm from Germany and I searched the internet for an nice e30. My result is that there are plenty for like 2000-3000€ out there, but they are all in ""okay"" condition. As one of you said it's hard to get one without rust. I didn't even see one for like 5000-6000€. There only some for like 10.000-15.000€ but these cars don't have anything to do with an original E30.   My first thought was that these cars work with ""simple"" engines and that these engines just work for many miles without flaws. Another idea was to buy an E30 and an extra engine. Replace it by my local car service. It's not as easy as it sounds, isn't it?  Again, thank you very much! Great community!"
E30,2jssf8,dtaivp,2,Mon Oct 20 16:57:12 2014 UTC,"Are you going to do a five-speed swap as well? Bodywork should be taken care of to prevent rust from spreading.   I would also assume that the suspension needs a refresh, unless he's gotten to it.   Not a ton of mention about the condition of the engine besides the timing belt being done. Look out for misfires, wandering idles, and of course check to make sure it isn't overheating, no oil in coolant, no excessive smoke out the tailpipe.   Keep in mind that after you've put parts and work into the car, you'll probably be out the same amount of cash as it would have taken to just buy a nice condition enthusiast-owned car.   edit How can he guarantee it hasn't been overheating if the radiator sensor isn't even working?  edit2 You could always buy this janky thing as a parts car donor for this project...he claims 62k miles on engine and tranny.

E30,2jssf8,messier_is_ok,2,Mon Oct 20 17:24:00 2014 UTC,"I am planning on chilling with the automatic for a bit, and seeing how I like it. Havent had an automatic car for a long time, so we will see. The engine seemed really strong honestly. I took it for a test drive and no weird noises up to 70 mph. No excessive smoke, but I will check for oil in the coolant when I go to see it again.   What does a misfire sound like (I am assuming it would be nearly immediately obvious though)?   No wandering idle either. And I realize it will likely be the same as if I bought one in great condition, but I really want to say I made the car what it is. I also have a twinge of doubt that it is a 325i though. He told me he swapped the trunk, so I will have to be careful when I look over the title."
E30,2jssf8,messier_is_ok,1 point,Mon Oct 20 17:36:28 2014 UTC,"A misfire can happen at idle, evidenced by a shaking motion and lumpy sound. Under load it would be a cutout or hesitation. You would have noticed it for sure.  As for I vs e, the shape of the intake manifold and rpm limit are good indicators."
E30,2jssf8,Grrrmachine,1 point,Mon Oct 20 18:06:48 2014 UTC,"Not a bad idea. only issue is lack of driveway space, at the moment. If it is still up when I have the money I will though.  Edit: that was in response to your second edit."
E30,2js7ng,Aus_pol,4,Mon Oct 20 13:42:30 2014 UTC,"$7000 for a 320i? That's a 0 too many.  Rustwise, check this list.   Mechanically, ask about the cam belt, if the injectors have been rebuilt, and when the rear beam bushes were done. Visually inspect the brake lines, especially the area around the rear beam (which means getting under the car) and the condition of the rubber hoses.  Open the engine bay and look at the condition of all rubber parts. Any sign of decay/splits/cracks in the coolant hoses, and especially the big rubber intake boot, is a sign of neglect and that a serious service is needed.  Don't worry if the engine leaks oil, all M20 engines do that, but find out how old the exhaust system is. Obviously check the tyres, especially the rear ones for inner wear as its an indicator of a lowered or failed suspension setup.  Really though, that's an insane price for arguably the shittest-engined E30."
E30,2js7ng,Grrrmachine,3,Mon Oct 20 15:18:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the extensive dot points. I've saved them in my gmail as a reference guide.   I agree regarding the 320 engine, however a replacement should be quite affordable for me to source since my mates company imports motorcycles from the US. Hence shipping an engine will be $0 or something trivial.   :( downside of living in Australia is the prices (unless they fall at negotiation time).   Say even 5k (would be 5.5 with all flight costs etc)"

E30,2js7ng,beefcakez,3,Tue Oct 21 06:54:00 2014 UTC,"Good gracious. $7k?!?   Totally ridiculous unless it's darn near mint condition, IMO.   Do you have a pic or a link to it? (not sure if it's an online find or not).   Don't worry about not being a car person. This car is truly one of the best cars to learn how to wrench on. Just buy yourself a Bentley manual (or find it online) and you'll be good to go. Ask here for help or go to R3Vlimited or E30tech as well.   Pretty much any issue you'll have will have already been found and repaired by someone else.   Absolutely absolutely change the timing belt ASAP unless you know for a fact the previous owner has done it recently (less than 50k miles). Belts give no warning to when they break, and on this car it'll destroy your engine.   Don't want a money sink? Well, maybe this car isn't for you, my friend.   I made a post last week asking how much people have spent on their e30's so far.   I'm $8k into mine and it still looks like crap. It's structurally sound and reliable (spent all money on suspension and engine work) but I haven't touched the exterior yet."

E30,2jqls2,OhNoHumans,1 point,Mon Oct 20 06:36:17 2014 UTC,Autopartsway.ca is okay. Sometimes they say things are in stock but they really aren't though. Then you have to wait a few weeks for a fuel pump to show up and have no car in the meantime.    I typically order from ECS or Blunt though. Ship to a US post box and pick it up.
E30,2jpmce,supermansocks95,3,Sun Oct 19 18:40:34 2014 UTC,"/u/promotor will probably be your best bet to ask. He's done pretty much every motor swap possible. He posted some comment a ways back you could search for.   Anyway, in my opinion:  Boosted M20's are awesome.  Boosted M50's are awesome-er ;)   However, the decision really depends on what you want from your car. The M50 (stock) has better gas mileage than the M20 and has much much more room for adding power at a low price.   Why are you partial to boosting the M20?   Also, where is this motor located? If you don't want it, I do."
E30,2jpmce,beefcakez,1 point,Sun Oct 19 20:25:41 2014 UTC,"Well, it's the motor that already in it and I wanted to keep it with the same parts. But, I know this is too good of a deal to pass up."
E30,2jpmce,protomor,1 point,Sun Oct 19 22:18:54 2014 UTC,M20 turbo will put out more power than an NA M50. I'd rebuild the M20 and go. Sell the M50 for moneys.

E30,2jpmce,Chinampa,1 point,Mon Oct 20 19:26:35 2014 UTC,"Either option is good but I'm sticking with my M20's because it's half the cost to rebuild a head. Also, I love the sound they make more than the M5x.  And with everyone doing M5x swaps, M20's are very available for not much money. I have a few spare motors on hand from scraps I was able to get for free."

Your e30 is probably worth about 3-5k minimum with the tranny replaced. If you're planning on keeping it, forget that you bought the car for 1800, and don't think of it in that equation (it cost me 1800 so it's not worth dumping 2k into it).  That being said, do you have friends who are into cars? you can learn/do the swap yourself.  But if you're gonna remove your tranny, don't forget that you'll want to budget for a new clutch, a new throwout bearing, resufacing of the flywheel, since you're in there already."

Regardless, I'm thinking of getting a CAtuned tranny, since It ends the risk of buying a bad one from a junker.  Also, thanks for letting me know that I should look into budgeting for the clutch, flywheel, and bearing. I'll be sure to keep that in mind."

E30,2jobb9,Chinampa,2,Mon Oct 20 03:29:32 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, the Getrag trannies from this time period are not very rebuildable.   Mine is going bad and I'v4e looked all over for rebuild kits with no luck.   Turns out the entire tranny needs to be heated in order to remove the gears and synchros.   The synchros alone are ~$80-$150 each because they're made of Molybdenum, IIRC. However, some vendor (I can't remember now ) has a set of the original BMW die sets used to cast them so they've made sets from brass. Again, unfortunately they don't sell these separately that I could find.   You're better off just buying a new tranny. A new one from Metric Mechanic (G260) will set you back ~$3k but a junkyard one will only cost a couple hundred.   Here's the link to the rebuilt ones:  http://www.metricmechanic.com/product-prices/transmission-rebuilds/6-cylinder-getrag-transmissions/  I found one vendor that sells rebuilt ones for around $1k, but I can't find it now. I'll post it when I do.   Edit: The cheaper tranny is sold by CAtuned.com and it runs $955.   http://www.catuned.com/catuned-getrag-260-transmission-e30"

Can I get the transmission out from under the car with it up on jack stands? Also how do I get the flywheel re-surfaced? I'd want the clutch to mate properly with it and resurfacing it seems the way to do it, unless I replace it but a new flywheel is nearly as much as the clutch kit...."
E30,2jjtaw,mayor_ardis,2,Sat Oct 18 00:44:32 2014 UTC,"The first time you do it, it's a super bitch to get the clutch aligned and the transmission replaced on the motor. I spent hours fucking with it the first couple of times I did it.  The weird torx bolts that hold the tranny to the motor will be hell too, especially if they've never been undone before. You'll want a variety of extensions and wobblies, and an impact wrench or a wicked cheater bar. And a friend with hands.  I've done it in my driveway on jackstands, and so have people on this thread.  In the end, it's worth it because it enhances your connection to your car, making you a better driver and a better person."
E30,2jjtaw,username2110,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:35:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, jack stands are plenty high enough. All you have to do is drop off the flywheel at any local machine shop and they can mill it flat for you for a very small fee, typically less then $30."
E30,2jjtaw,protomor,3,Sat Oct 18 00:55:54 2014 UTC,Probably not worth 3k... A clutch job is something around $700 I'd say. I bet the hydraulics went bad and that killed the clutch though. So probably at least $1k in work.

E30,2jk2mx,A_frakkin_Cylon,4,Fri Oct 17 22:10:31 2014 UTC,"They get the value from other cars like it. If you find examples of the car that are around the same mileage and year as yours you can average them together to fight for a higher payout. Although a 325e isn't worth all that much anyways, but it's better than nothing. They don't go by KBB at all so ignore that. Just find 325e in your state in similar shape and if you can't look national.  States vary on laws with this though. I had to fight with my insurance company for a few months to get the money I wanted from my old 318is. I ended up getting more than 1000 dollars over what they had initially wanted to pay out. It was a big pain in the ass going back and forth."
E30,2jk2mx,following_eyes,2,Fri Oct 17 22:45:00 2014 UTC,Thank you! Very helpful!
E30,2jk2mx,Epic2112,2,Fri Oct 17 22:59:36 2014 UTC,"Take that advice.  The guy you'll be dealing with at the insurance company has one job: to pay you as little as possible.  Find out how they determined the value of the car.  Take that information, and look up the laws in your state about how the value of a car can be determined.  There's a chance that the ins. co. won't have even bothered to follow these laws, since so few people take that step.  Use those laws to come up with a better (higher) value for the car, and start negotiating.    This is a dance.  You do NOT have to accept their first offer.  My friend's crappy accord got hit a few months back.  There was damage to a couple of body panels, and the ins. co. told her the car was worth $3k or so, and the damage would cost more than that to repair so they were going to call it a total loss.  She learned about the laws, took the time to argue, and ended up getting close to $6k.  She was able to have the car fixed, and still have money left over.  You're obviously not going to fix the car, but hopefully you can get enough money to buy one in similar condition.  Good luck, glad you're OK"

E30,2jg2up,protomor,1 point,Mon Oct 20 17:11:31 2014 UTC,"Oh my dear god that is hilarious. How difficult was putting the M50 Turbo in? I am not really familiar with engine swaps, but am considering an engine and transmission swap for my next e30."
E30,2jg2up,dtaivp,1 point,Mon Oct 20 17:19:49 2014 UTC,Curious about the S52 turbo -> S52 (long story)!
E30,2jg2up,navamaras,1 point,Mon Oct 20 07:38:14 2014 UTC,"To keep it short, I really got tired of all the BS of turbo stuff. So much fabrication and so many issues. The turbo blew a seal at one point, poured oil onto the manifold while I was on track, and caught fire. After that, I decided reliable was more important than 500whp. Then the LS came into my head the week after I finished the NA S52"
E30,2jg2up,protomor,1 point,Mon Oct 20 10:19:57 2014 UTC,"Currently in the turbo m20 stage, however Im thinking of keeping this powerplant, seems to like boost. Althought ls2 would be oh so fun."
E30,2jg2up,Thelazywaffleman,2,Wed Oct 22 05:00:37 2014 UTC,I think an M20 with a small turbo is great. Anything more than 300whp and the motor just doesn't feel right to me.
E30,2jg2up,protomor,1 point,Wed Oct 22 11:30:02 2014 UTC,Im currently over 400 with a big turbo. Ive never driven an e30 without an m20 so Im biased but I enjoy it. Id really like to to build an m60b44 with a snail one day though.
E30,2jg2up,Thelazywaffleman,2,Wed Oct 22 14:58:37 2014 UTC,"Never saw the point in an M60 swap when an LS weighs less and puts out more power for the same BS. Get a drop on SC kit and BAM, tons of powa!"
E30,2jg2up,protomor,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:01:15 2014 UTC,"True but Id like to do it as more of a project than actually trying to have the best setup. Honestly right around 300-350hp is all an e30 really needs. Im fitting a roots supercharger to my m20 with the large turbo to go twincharged, should be done sometime in 2015. Unnecessarily complicated? yes, but It will be fun."
E30,2jg2up,Thelazywaffleman,2,Wed Oct 22 15:09:01 2014 UTC,"Ha! I really don't doubt that, man.   How many e30's have you gone through and how many different motors?"
E30,2jg2up,protomor,4,Thu Oct 16 20:05:06 2014 UTC,"I've built about 5 or 6 at this point. I've restored another 5 or 6 more. I've parted out about 5 or 6 as well.   Motors? Lots of M20s. I've done 5 M50 based swaps. I had a turbo M50, turbo S52, and turbo M20. Now I'm onto that LS2."
E30,2jg2up,Pumacaine,2,Thu Oct 16 20:06:45 2014 UTC,Do you break them often? Or is this just over a very long span of time
E30,2jg2up,protomor,2,Fri Oct 17 01:29:54 2014 UTC,"Probably over the course of 10 years. Sometimes I build them for other people. Some times I just help out but am the lead on projects. Sometimes I get a car, build it, then decide to sell it only to get another car and do the exact same god damn thing.   I've never outright destroyed an engine. Always got fed up with small stuff breaking. Like an oil seal on the back of a turbo that ran down the manifold and caught fire. Found it in time before any damage happened."
E30,2jg2up,brahbarian,2,Fri Oct 17 12:17:52 2014 UTC,How is a m20 turbo btw? Is it worth it? Or would a motor swap be more cost effective then a turbo m20?
E30,2jg2up,protomor,2,Fri Oct 17 05:26:44 2014 UTC,"I did a turbo M20 before M50 swaps were cheap and documented. If you have a way to tune it or can get a chip, it's definitely a nice way to go. For around the same amount, you can do an S52 swap these days. A bit less power but less of a headache all around.   Although, I do like me some LS swaps. Much more potential."
E30,2jg2up,brahbarian,3,Fri Oct 17 12:18:53 2014 UTC,Timing belt kit. Gc conversion kit. Bilstein sports. Oils. Lots of miscellaneous junkyard bits. Lsd  Differential. I'd say about or close to $800-$1000. Everything of course second hand but the timing kit.  Traded a 97 bandit for it.  http://imgur.com/rGCBNol http://imgur.com/vaSw14O
E30,2jg2up,Pumacaine,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:04:39 2014 UTC,How did you do the bumpers?
E30,2jg2up,brahbarian,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:15:19 2014 UTC,"Not I, the previous owner. He got it painted and all the chrome bits. I hate it. Looks tacky. The chrome bits weren't prepped correctly so it's peeling here and there. I have already got all those bits from the junk yard and have extra diving board bumpers laying around that I'm cleaning to swap out. Too much gloss. Would have been better a satin look instead."
E30,2jg2up,Pumacaine,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:33:14 2014 UTC,Yeah i dont really agree with painting over the chrome on the bumpers instead of restoring them. I was contemplating plastidipping the bumper shroud on mine
E30,2jg2up,SelfMastered,3,Fri Oct 17 21:12:32 2014 UTC,"So far about $4000 for the car +$1,500 for parts. And it still doesn't drive :( ordering parts to come to canada is a bitch!"

E30,2jg2up,Keltarrant,3,Fri Oct 17 02:02:01 2014 UTC,"Bought for 3grand just over a year ago, probably put 2k into it between winter tires, bilstein struts and hr springs, various bushings, shift knob, oil changes etc. Plan on doing a r134a conversion soon too."
E30,2jg2up,Keltarrant,2,Thu Oct 16 20:38:59 2014 UTC,"Haha indeed, its my daily so its one day or weekend projects at a time."
E30,2jg2up,Keltarrant,2,Fri Oct 17 01:58:03 2014 UTC,"Good choice on the a/c conversion. Once I've got the new radiator support in mine I'm tackling that next. The only thing I'm reusing is the evaporator, but I haven't inspected it yet to see if I have to replace that too.   I'm redoing the lines too so they don't show in the engine bay. Extra time and money, but when my engine bay is completely shaved/smoothed it'll look awesome."
E30,2jg2up,The_Gas_Man,2,Fri Oct 17 04:00:56 2014 UTC,"I was reading something about how since before i'm before a certain build date, i have to replace the lines since they cant handle the PAG oil."
E30,2jg2up,tspangle88,2,Fri Oct 17 02:06:30 2014 UTC,"Umm. Interestling.   Mine is an 89 so I don't have to worry about that, I guess. I didn't see anything when researching other than replacing the normal components and o rings, etc.   What year is yours?"
E30,2jg2up,tspangle88,2,Fri Oct 17 04:00:21 2014 UTC,"87, think the build date is 9/86"
E30,2jg2up,SoundByte,3,Fri Oct 17 13:01:24 2014 UTC,I bought mine for $1250 back in February and I've probably put in another $3000. All in neglected maintenance. And I'm still working on getting the ac to work again. It's a gigantic money pit. And I love it.
E30,2jg2up,audimann,2,Fri Oct 17 13:36:42 2014 UTC,"Yep. Money pit for sure, but a loveable one.   When it does run, I can't help but smile every time I drive it."
E30,2jg2up,Vythix,3,Thu Oct 16 21:55:17 2014 UTC,More than I want to think about.
E30,2jg2up,audimann,2,Fri Oct 17 13:05:06 2014 UTC,Ha! I know it. I regretted adding up all the costs immediately after I did it.   It's disheartening to spend that much and still have a car that looks like shit on the outside ;)
E30,2jg2up,FistingMona,2,Thu Oct 16 23:39:52 2014 UTC,"Or, in my case, spending so much (over $5k on a car I paid $800 for) on a car that looks like shit and has barely moved since I bought it two years ago...."
E30,2jg2up,FistingMona,1 point,Fri Oct 17 02:02:47 2014 UTC,"Ain't that the fuckin' truth. Of course, I still remind myself that a car that works well and looks like shit beats the hell out of one the other way around."

E30,2jg2up,Dzdimi14,3,Mon Oct 20 08:57:45 2014 UTC,"$200 for the car, $800 for parts (Some salvaged from friends wrecks) and about $10k worth of work. It pays off to be a mechanic."
E30,2jg2up,Dzdimi14,2,Fri Oct 17 00:02:12 2014 UTC,I bought mine for $3200 and spent about $4000 to $5000. $1100 alone on the current wheel set up and about $1500 on suspension. $250 for a chip and the rest on odds and ends. The shit adds up quick and It's prolly more than that. I threw money at the car for awhile and didn't know how to buy parts properly.
E30,2jg2up,username2110,2,Fri Oct 17 00:36:56 2014 UTC,I hear ya. I didn't know the proper vendors and bought overpriced stuff for the longest time.
E30,2jg2up,username2110,2,Fri Oct 17 05:53:09 2014 UTC,Probably about $9k + the cost of the car (2500).
E30,2jg2up,Reysup,2,Fri Oct 17 00:42:30 2014 UTC,What kind of stuff did you do to it?
E30,2jg2up,username2110,2,Fri Oct 17 01:59:10 2014 UTC,"It's almost embarrassing how little I've accomplished for how much I've spent on it..   Full vacuum system (the previous owner removed all of it)  AFM, ICV, and CSI  All new coolant hoses (twice)  Wide-band O2 sensor  Ash tray gauge cluster   Electric fan swap  All LED lights (except headlights)  New windows cranks  Lots of towing fees  New distributor  New ignition coil and spark plugs  Lug bolt to stud conversion  New wheel cylinders  New roundels  I could go on, but you get the point I'm sure."
E30,2jg2up,Reysup,2,Fri Oct 17 00:55:32 2014 UTC,"I know the exact feeling, well minus the towing fees (rented a uhaul trailer and borrowed my uncles F250).   It sucks to spend so much and it still look like when you first bought it, or worse.   This car is truly the ultimate money pit ;)"
E30,2jg2up,username2110,2,Fri Oct 17 01:59:23 2014 UTC,Bought my car for 850 from an older gentlemen and drove it away. Need to replace the front bumper plastic and the exhaust I've had my car about 3 weeks

What else was wrong that you needed to buy a new one?   Did you get rid of it entirely or keep it around for parts?  Edit: Saw your post below. Glad you kept it for parts.

E30,2j761b,username2110,3,Tue Oct 14 18:46:24 2014 UTC,"the 4cyl is also lighter, meaning a 318i can technically outbrake and outcorner a 325i."

And those ""eye-lids"" are just cheap ebay plastic..  I'm offer the guy half of what he's asking after pointing out the mods are all shit.   P.S.

E30,2j61ic,brahbarian,3,Tue Oct 14 13:14:10 2014 UTC,Definitely not worth it. Seems like it had cooling problems hence the head job. It's lowered on Raceland. The wheels are reps. Everything was done on a budget.  If everything goes checks out and is good I would pay no more then $3-3300 Maxx.

E30,2j6v7e,reptawr,4,Tue Oct 14 05:14:08 2014 UTC,Synchro?
E30,2j6v7e,modmodmodmodmod,2,Tue Oct 14 06:18:37 2014 UTC,I thought I read somewhere e30s don't have a first gear synchro.
E30,2j6v7e,thaidrogo,2,Tue Oct 14 06:52:49 2014 UTC,"It's also possible that the clutch is failing to disengage fully. This can be because there is some air in the hydraulics, which can be fixed by bleeding the clutch line. If it is only on 1st gear, you can try double-clutching - slip into neutral, blip the throttle, re-engage the clutch, then go into gear. Lots of old cars had no synchro on 1st, and many more developed weak synchros  with age and wear. I may be wrong, but I don't think a loose shift linkage - so common in older BMWs  - would cause it to grind."
E30,2j6v7e,Keltarrant,3,Tue Oct 14 07:01:44 2014 UTC,"I always recommend bleeding the clutch first, its fairly easy, cheap, and might fix your issue without throwing parts at the car."

E30,2j6v7e,Deltigre,1 point,Tue Oct 14 18:47:29 2014 UTC,"Mine does this cold and I think it's a combination of a worn synchro with a sticky pilot bearing. I've already replaced the clutch hydraulics but you can hear input shaft bearing whirr when it's being sticky with the clutch all of the way depressed.  I have a backup transmission and a new pilot bearing, but I haven't gotten to replacing those yet."
E30,2j6v7e,asul596,1 point,Tue Oct 14 21:19:57 2014 UTC,Its your throwout bearing
E30,2j6v7e,asul596,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:33:38 2015 UTC,Basically whats happening is the bearing is failing and when you fully depress the clutch it doesnt really disengage the mating surfaces so you get the grind
E30,2j6v7e,asul596,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"I've read that signs of a bad throwout bearing is a sound when you depress the clutch, but I don't really hear anything when I do it. How hard is the replacement?"
E30,2j62u3,funny9uy,2,Tue Oct 14 00:19:31 2014 UTC,"Shoot,  that's a darn good deal if all that stuff is true.    Oil leaks are sometimes a pain to locate. He probably just didn't really look too hard ad it might require taking the front end apart. The camshaft seal may be bad, the oil pan, crankshaft,  rear main seal. Who knows.

E30,2j62u3,beefcakez,1 point,Tue Oct 14 01:53:22 2014 UTC,Yeah. The oil leak is a cause for concern but I'll ask if he's throwing in the throttle

E30,2iyrgi,FunkyKitty,7,Sat Oct 11 18:56:26 2014 UTC,"First congrats.  Second if you're gonna do the shifter bushing (which is what I assume you mean that it's sloppy) then just replace out the shifter with a short shifter because it really does change the feel of the car. Exhaust is something you need to figure out if you're going to do a full exhaust from the headers, from the catalytic converter, are you going to delete the catalytic converter or do you just want a new muffler (which is what you're describing). Also remember to do all the preventative stuff first on your e30 before you start throwing money into mods. The million dollar question  for any new e30 I buy is, ""When was the timing belt and water pump done."" 9/10 times the previous owner doesn't know and that's first thing on the list to replace. Good luck, join forums but most importantly drive the living hell outta your car."

E30,2iyrgi,lemachin,4,Sun Oct 12 02:30:02 2014 UTC,"I will second what the other guy said: go over all your essential parts. Are they new? Do they need replacing? Would they benefit from a fresher part anyway? I spent my first year with the E30 replacing wires, gaskets, all this boring stuff that turns out to be essential to a good ownership experience in the long run.  For your shifter rebuild, the Z3 swap is pretty common. Check out the guide at E30zone.  Exhaust, sure. Personal preference, and there's also a range of options based on how much of the system you want to go.  I think the best upgrade for an E30, especially if you expect to use it on a track or in autocross, is a steering rack from a Z3 or E46."

E30,2itt6j,ScoobCrew,8,Fri Oct 10 04:17:31 2014 UTC,"""Last mechanic had over tightened the valve cover bolts. Which in turn made the harmonic balancer go"" thats the biggest load of shit I have ever heard, one is at the top of the engine the other is at the bottom. if you over tighten the valve cover bolts you pull the threads out and then it leaks oil, thats it, thats the only possible consequence of that. the harmonic balancers go on those engines when they get old, thats all there is to that.  If old mate really dose beleave this then I question the quality of the maintenance  thats been carried out on the car. its on old car chances are the ac wont work, the ac system on them is fairly simple and easy to work on so no biggy there.  timing gaskets are a piece of piss. its an e30 so the boot will leak, I have a new seal on mine. it leaks, its just what they do rust. check, the floor particularly near the pedals, the sills, the base of the a pillars, the base of the c pillars, the sunroof if it has one, around the boot seal, the compartment things either side of the spare wheel. 122,000 but stopped working about a months worth of driving ago, i call bullshit they never work. ive owned 3 only 1 has had a working one and the guy only had it fixed to sell it to me"
E30,2itt6j,DeepMidWicket,3,Fri Oct 10 08:51:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of that sounds like bullshit. I bet that odometer stopped working at least 20,000 miles ago, and what the hell does a valve cover do with the harmonic balancer? My AC works. Trunk always leaks, but it's not through the top, it's through the vents behind the bumpers into the low spots for the battery/jack. I hate it, but there's not much to do other than seal the vents (not recommended...) Don't worry about the timing profile gasket unless there's a reason to. Unless you find something that was never driven (and I mean never), the gasket will have already been replaced with one that isn't susceptible to the original issue.   And now that I realized this sub has no flair, I'll mention I own a 250,000mi 318is."
E30,2itt6j,Deltigre,3,Fri Oct 10 14:22:01 2014 UTC,"This man speaks the truth. If there is indeed no rust, I'd go for it. You'll probably end up upgrading the suspension and when that M42 dies, you'll have the lightest e30 they ever made as a platform for an engine swap.   Some fair warning, the M42 is a great engine and I loved mine, but its slow as hell. ""still has excellent torque-really goes"" is bullshit. Don't expect a fast car.  Some good news: I bought my M42 e30 (in great condition) at the same time my mom bought a brand new Audi Q5 and the only repairs I've had to do over the 3 years I've owned it have been replacing the oil pan (because my car is low as hell) and the fuel pump (both very easy to do) while she's had to go into the shop and get things fixed like 7 or so times. Its nice to have the most reliable car in the family.  I say go check it out (unless its a hell of a drive)."
E30,2itt6j,ToastitoTheBandito,2,Fri Oct 10 16:25:04 2014 UTC,"Not the lightest e30 ever made, that goes to the 84 and 85 318i cars, realistically once you swap in the new engine diff and transmission for whatever swap your doing your up to the weight of an m20 car.   That said people seem to love the m42 e30's to death, i'm not so sure i think they are worth the money people ask for them, especially considering the m20 motors are known to last hundreds and hundreds of thousands of miles (my friends 325es had over 400k when he bought it, as well as his current 325is has over 200k and runs like a top)."

I love every moment of driving my e30m30 swap. you DO need to fabricate or buy motor mounts. i bought mine from garagistic.  if you're buying the car with an m20 it's going to be cheaper overall. No need to track down a transmission, no need for driveshaft, no need to change your gearing.   If you do decide on doing a swap, I suggest taking your time and rebuilding/refreshing as much of the engine as possible. Otherwise you'll just be chasing gremlins."

The m30 is thirsty for gas at 17city/24hwy on good behavior.  I bought this car with no intention to swap it originally but then of course the bug got me. I spent $2000 on the car. $600 on the engine, $2000 in parts. The list for parts is so long it's almost unbelievable. I refreshed the block with as many brand new parts as I could afford so it's nearly a brand new engine. The e30m3 flywheel alone was $350 and driveshaft cut/rebalance was $200 so those 2 items ate a big chunk out of the budget.  With more patience and hunting you could do better than what I laid down.
