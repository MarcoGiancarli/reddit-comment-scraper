Wrasslin,34crnz,Future_Visions,2,Thu Apr 30 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"The rationale is as follows: As the current WWE champion, why shouldn't Seth Rollins be a fighter in Smash? Not only did he curb stomp Brock Lesnar on the grandest stage of them all, but he saved us from having to hear ""BELEEDAT"" in every major promo and main event since Wrestlemania. On top of that, Rollins RKO'd Randy Orton. This guy used Orton's famous finisher against him. Out of nowhere. I'm pretty sure nobody on the current Smash roster has done that before."

Wrasslin,336mb0,El_Specificbro,3,Mon Apr 20 07:04:37 2015 UTC,"If he had been in the main event at WrestleMania 28 against Jericho, that could have been a valid argument for headlining the show. Even though that points out another glaring flaw in WWE booking that the Royal Rumble winner that year, Sheamus, should have been the one to headline the event, not have an 18 second title match.  At WrestleMania 29, his feud with Undertaker was booked haphazardly which isn't his fault, but it still would have been a lackluster build to the main event of the show. You knew after WrestleMania 28 that the following year was going to be the final match in the Rock/Cena story, and nothing was being booked over that. Should Undertaker/Punk have been the main event? No.  At WrestleMania 30...he cried about having a match with Triple H, and instead he went home, because he thought he should have wrestled against Orton...again. He also said that wrestling fans don't deserve an explanation, and then finally said he quit because he was asked to work hurt. Now though he's saying wrestling's too fake, so I guess the only hurt was in his pride all along. Just like Steve Austin, I can't respect someone who walks away from a contract and unlike Steve throws a tantrum when they actually finally fire him.  TL:DR - WM28 is the only time he could have been in the main event with how he was booked."
Wrasslin,336mb0,ElRobZilla,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:01:13 2015 UTC,Or they could've given us the main event that a year's worth of storyline built at 29 and had him replace the Rock against Cena.  The Raw match for that spot is the main event we should've gotten.
Wrasslin,336mb0,SmacSBU,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"So you think Cena vs. Punk should have headlined WrestleMania 29? Interesting argument, honestly, I haven't seen that one often. That is the Raw match for the #1 contenders spot you're referencing, correct? I'm also just saying that the WWE's plans were pretty clear from 27 to 28 to 29, not that it was good but that it was understood where they were going with it. It's a common complaint and a valid one at that, that the build was clear yet not very well executed due to The Rock's schedule primarily. Would Punk vs. Rock III have been more compelling than Rock vs. Cena II? No not really, especially since it was basically a one man effort to build to the match in Rock's absences.  Looking at it from a wrestler's perspective, more on the booking side of it, CM Punk was on a downward slope after SummerSlam 2012. The booking wasn't great but after this point it was just downright terrible for a world champion. I think this would have been remedied with Punk admitting he hired the Shield for help; easy heel heat. They just made it clear CM Punk was there for convenience, not because they wanted to build a legacy.  The way things were booked, the only time he really could have been argued to be the main event was the match with Jericho at 28. Everything else is fantasy booking."
Wrasslin,336mb0,ElRobZilla,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Punk's feud with Ryback was weak and it only took place because Cena was injured, that much is pretty obvious. Those couple of months really took the wind out of Punk's reign though because there was plenty of heat on him coming out of Night Of Champions where he retained on a draw in Boston. He was playing a perfect chicken shit and getting away with everything so if they had carried that through mania without the Rock being involved and had Cena take the belt from him the booking would have made sense.  The plans for Cena and Rock were crystal clear but that doesn't mean we have to agree with seeing a part timer (who made a ton of media appearances and didn't bring the belt or mention WWE) and a guy who spent the year chasing the title unsuccessfully or injured main event Mania in a lackluster match with almost no build."
Wrasslin,336mb0,SmacSBU,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was good, and I'm also not looking to fantasy book here either. You also had Ryback really over at that point and could have made a solid argument for him to be a transitional champion if you really wanted to argue.  I'm just saying that no, WM30 was not his time to main event. WM29 wasn't the best time either. WM28 would have been the only time everything booked as it was would have led to a main event match. If we want to fantasy book, there's endless possibilities."

Wrasslin,300ixt,enigmaticevil,2,Mon Mar 23 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, i'm maintaining my apathy. There's just something about haitch matches I just can't enjoy. They're just kinda... dull"
Wrasslin,300ixt,Mr-Potz,2,Mon Mar 23 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"I hear you, and agree completely. Been waiting for Sting in WWE forever though."
Wrasslin,300ixt,enigmaticevil,3,Mon Mar 23 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"See I never watched wow,  it was before my time, and I never watched tna because the broad concensus was always ""ewwww"" so they'll have to bust something special out to make me care"
Wrasslin,300ixt,Mr-Potz,3,Mon Mar 23 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"And my worry is they aren't building up the match as much as they should. It's been essentially 15 years since Sting was a top-WCW guy. Many didn't watch TNA, like you said. So it's definitely a nostalgia match. That's why I think so many wanted Sting to face Taker but I can see Sting beating HHH. I can't see him beating Taker, especially at Mania."
Wrasslin,300ixt,enigmaticevil,3,Mon Mar 23 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"yeah anyone under the age of what, 25? aren't going to know/care who sting was. they're going in cold"
Wrasslin,300ixt,Mr-Potz,2,Tue Mar 24 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"Which is another problem. Outside Survivor Series and what little else they've done, HHH/Sting have next-to-no history.   They missed the boat, I think bringing Sting in for Flair's sendoff would've been best because they had so many great matches together, it would've been easy to build up one last confrontation."
Wrasslin,300ixt,enigmaticevil,2,Tue Mar 24 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"aye, I think they could've brought flair into the story a lot more. from what I understand they have a lot of history to work with. Build it up hot enough non physically, and they can take the actual match slower and more methodical, which would be more suited to an elderly sting"
Wrasslin,300ixt,Mr-Potz,2,Tue Mar 24 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"Jim Ross or Tony Schiavone doing play-by-play, please!"
