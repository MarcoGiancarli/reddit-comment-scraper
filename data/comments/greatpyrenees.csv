greatpyrenees,3dtnui,eatcitrus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:17:22 2015 UTC,"Brush her.  A lot.  I have a pure pyr, so I use a dethatching brush, like this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Undercoat-Rake-DeSheddingTool-Fantastic-Grooming-High-Brush-Cat-Grooming-Grooming/dp/B00CMJZ4TE/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1437337083&sr=8-8&keywords=pet+undercoat+rake&pebp=1437337091783&perid=1M5WFFZF1BHSD9ED7F99  You'll probably get enough for for several mittens.

greatpyrenees,3dl8gz,metamars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:24:54 2015 UTC,"Poor guy. I think it's just going to take him a while to adjust. Sounds like he's been though a lot. I don't really know what to tell you if you can't crate train him. Our GP loves his crate. He just goes in there to hang out sometimes, doubly so if he's in trouble or nervous/scared. You might try getting him a big crate and leaving the door open all the time, feeding him in it so he gets used to the idea of having his own little condo. Definitely pick one of the metal grate crates though, sounds like the big plastic ones would be too scary and dark for him."
greatpyrenees,3dl8gz,LazyRobot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:18 2015 UTC,I got mine a big plastic kennel and I just leave the gate detached entirely so he can go lie down there when he feels like it. He roams at night sometimes too but mostly just to find other places to settle and sleep. Maybe a night light by the kennel? Or classical music playing so he has some background noise. Good luck.  Edit: for hot summers I also got a cooling pad like this one in case his restlessness was caused by overheating

We run them at the park for a while, it helps to get some of the energy out, and they have a fenced in back yard at our home.  Our one would never adjust to crating, he would scratch and paw at it, drool like mad, and just generally go crazy the entire time he was crated.  I also agree that he will become adjusted, but a month in is probably just too soon.  It seems like he was better and is getting worse now?  There is a soothing dog sounds app that you can play on an ipod, worth a try at least....."

I might suggest an x-post to /r/dogs as well so you can get the whole community's outrage and take on the situation, but this enrages me to no end. I have nothing positive to offer except they should have fucking known better.   Sunscreen is a definite yes, and good on encouraging hair regrowth as much as possible, but those types of cuts can damage the hair follicle and stunt regrowth, as it's a double-coated breed.  Beautiful baby, by the way! I'm so sorry about the boo-boos!"
greatpyrenees,3dk23m,whileIminTherapy,6,Fri Jul 17 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh!!! Poor pup! I would suggest maybe contacting your local GP rescue (Great Pyrenees of Atlanta is great and always super helpful) and seeing if they have any advice. I know a lot of the time some of the GPs taken in are so matted and flea infested that the rescues sometimes have no choice, but to shave. I bet they will have some helpful info for you."
greatpyrenees,3dk23m,hithere87,2,Fri Jul 17 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there is not much you can do beyond what you're already doing. I am absolutely shocked that any groomer would advocate shaving. I worked in a grooming salon for a year and we would only recommend shaving if the dog was so severely matted that it was causing skin problems, or would be impossible to brush out. It does not look like this was even close to the case for your pup. I'm so sorry that they did this, you should make sure to leave a review complete with pictures to warn others away.  Hair growth will depend on the dog. If he loves to go outside, don't be afraid to get a t-shirt or something he can wear in addition to using the sunscreen! They make clothes that have UV protection in them, he's big enough that you would not need to get ""dog clothes"", you could probably just put a regular old t-shirt on him and tie up the excess fabric in the back.  I would also recommend looking for a food that will help support healthy coat/skin! If you have a natural pet food place around you, check something like that out. I think flax is also supposed to be really good for hair, so maybe look into some flax supplements as well?  Best of luck to you and Winston!"
greatpyrenees,3dk23m,r-u-aware-ur-a-cat,3,Fri Jul 17 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! He was far from being matted to the point where he needed shaved down.

Both my pyrs love people in general.  But they're very much a pyr with guarding their house or backyard.  Bark at anything and everything.   I've had neighbors come into our house to let them potty when we're gone for an extended day and they're very friendly.  However, dogs pick up on human demeanor.  If someone was busting into my house, i have no doubt that my dogs will protect the house."

If he gives a lick it's incredibly rare and usually only to my wife or if I've been on a work trip for a few days.  I can definitely say that as nice and calm as he is the few times something threatening has been near the house, coyotes or a jeohvah's witness for example, he gets into hyper guardian mode. Especially since my daughter was born I doubt anything or anyone that had ill will or nefarious designs could get near us or the house without first going through 115 lbs of Bear. I'd imagine your pooch would do the same. It's in their nature to guard the herd/pack/lands."

He's super friendly with other dogs, on walks, at parks, and thinks everyone is here to pet him... with one condition, I have to let you in.  We were having some contractors do some work once. The guy was in the kitchen and Murphy was on the couch with my wife. The contractors boss had to be called and he was coming over... but the guy just walked in the house without knocking. Murphy was over the couch and had the guy pinned in the corner, teeth barred before she could even get up.  He calmed down quickly but never trusted him.

greatpyrenees,3czlyb,codeninja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same story here, Pyr Anatolians, about the same age too.   No licking. In fact, no face time. Put your face near theirs, and they turn their head away. This is actually great because I have had dogs that are constant lickers and want to be in your face constantly and it becomes highly annoying.   If someone actually broke in... I suspect you'd be surprised. Your calm, gentle giant will show their other, scarier side, and it is startling when it happens.   The setting is important. Strangers who are not threats and you are at ease around will not pique your Pyr's interest. But the minute things get stressful, your Pyr will know and it will become incredibly defensive.   Thankfully they seem to be pretty good about knowing when it is appropriate to switch personalities. And even when they do go on the defensive, they do it with grace, and never over do it. If the threat backs down, they respect that and they back down a bit too, but stay weary.   I've never seen a Pyr be the aggressor or bully. Usually the Pyr will be the dog with the longer fuse, tolerating a lot of abuse before eventually taking a stand. And when the Pyr finally says ""ENOUGH!"" the other dog will usually get the picture."

If we are out, he is fine with strangers but he is a great guard dog for the house.

She was the reason my Dad paid thousands upon thousands to install a tall chain link fence around 4 acres of forested mountain land, and Sprite always figured a way out. There was no stopping the expansion of her domain. Sprite left the greatest impression on us as a consummate dog family, as she went on adventures and returned with many dead and decaying gifts for the family.  However, Sprite was deathly afraid of cameras. She must have thought cameras were simply put on this Earth to steal her mortal soul. We never got a picture of her that was more than a giant white blur.  Thanks for sharing this majestic beast!"

First, he was a livestock guardian dog, and I don't know if the farm went under or he was fired for being too small and too friendly, but Big Fluffy Dog Rescue picked him up after someone reported that he and two females had been locked in a shed for weeks without food or water.  (Maybe some neighbor was sneaking them water...but they were starved!!)  After he was healthy, they moved him up North where I fostered him for three months, after which he got adopted by someone who kept him in their city apartment and returned him for being vicious (a trait which I never witnessed).  I fostered him for another three months until he met a horse rancher who was looking for a male Pyr to play with his current male.  They played beautifully, but Griffin barked at a horse and was declined.  I realized how relieved I was that I didn't have to say goodbye again, so I adopted him for good and moved to a more suitable place with a big yard for him to rule over.  He's perfect enough for me!"

They are not only beautiful they also have a very steady temperament. They are very friendly and just great all-rounder in term of trainability, adaptability, care and grooming, and even exercise wise which I feel is your biggest concern also because of your set up.   They do need mental stimulation which you need to give them through outdoor exercise. This is because they are used to be around sheep, goats, farm livestock, as well of course as people.  Try and find out what training he/she has had so far if you are adopting him/her, it is important for this dog.  Best of luck, would love to know how you are doing.

greatpyrenees,3afwb6,batmanthegroomer,6,Fri Jun 19 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"This is so exciting! If you're familiar with big dogs and grooming pyrs, I really think you're quite prepared!   Breed specific things to keep in mind:   They're (generally) a little stand-offish with new people, so don't expect to get love at first sight. (There are exceptions to this...my girl is a huge hussy with strangers.) Give him extra some time to come around.  Also, Pyrs bark. It's what they're made to do. We have new owners come in occasional like ""What is up with this, how do I make it stop?"" Don't be that gal! The best you can hope for is to get him on a schedule (mine is a morning/evening barker. She does the rounds to make sure everything as it should be, and then chills.) and have a calming routine in place. I actually find my girl's patrol barks really comforting. shrug  As for hikes, my girl lives in Alabama and she enjoys hikes with me, even in the summer! They're very sure-footed and will go and go and go as far as I can tell, but at a slower pace than a high-energy dog. Mine's not expressed an interest in swimming, but has totally rolled around in a deep mud puddle at the advice of another dog on the trip."
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,gogogadgetpants_,6,Fri Jun 19 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there's no such thing as an off-leash Pyr.  They won't stick close by, they like to explore and wander.  Always on the leash outside!  The yard without a fence could be problematic.  You'll have to take her out for walks for all of her business.  But I guess you already do this with your current dog.  Also, Pyrs are naturally nocturnal.  At first, she may sleep all day and wander the house all night, barking quite loudly at every single falling leaf in your yard.  This can be trained out of them, though.  We got mine to a proper day/night schedule... but the protective barking.  That's just there for good, so learn to love it!"
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,Yeti_Father,3,Sat Jun 20 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, off leash is a never with a pyre. It's nothing personal, but your call to come isn't beating my need to survey and sniff this to know what's up, oh and that and yeah that over there. I'm just trying to patrol? Pyres are independent. They'll judge your commands vs what they think is important. They're stubborn. They're hard to train. Go with it, just be aware. Tricks and immediate command acknowledgement? Not so much. Positive training is key in any case.  The nocturnal thing is part of their breeding. It can be mitigated, to an extent, but you'll still have nights where they'll bark at whatever. You'll probably never know what.  Also, it's good that your current woof is a female and the pyre a male. I've never experienced it, but I've heard that female-female pyre households are challenging.  To end, give him time. Our lady only wanted out and away from us for several weeks. A month or so later she came upstairs for the first time. It was a good three months before I felt that she accepted us. Give it time and you'll be rewarded with a partner who'll always be there for you. Good luck!  edit: Also about water. My experience is that they don't really care for it. Others can chime in, but I've had Goldens which obviously do, but our wants nothing to do with it.  Also, check out http://www.greatpyr.com/forum/  Greatpyrenees on reddit is great, but you'll get more feedback there if you need help."
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,RaiderRaiderBravo,4,Wed Jun 24 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"The pyr rescues that I know of (in the Northwest) won't put a Pyr into a family without verifying that they have a legit fence that has absolutely no points that can be compromised. This is due to the fact that pyrs love to roam and will sneak out whenever possible to try and secure the area. In their minds, they'll wander to make sure there are no predators and eventually come back, but we all know the dangers there. So if you have one and don't have a fence, be very careful. They're stubborn and they are terrible with recall because they've been bred to think for themselves.  As for taking him to work, I think that's a slippery slope. Our pyr has been socialized since she was a tiny pup and is the nicest, sweetest girl wherever we take her -- because she's gone everywhere with us and met everyone we could have her meet.  But when she's at home, it's HER home and she'll let anyone coming near the house know it. Dogs walking by, people coming into her yard, etc. I'm afraid that if he continuously comes to work with you, he will feel as though the place is his own and it needs protecting -- and he will bark at anyone/everyone who comes in. Like ours, he may be totally friendly and fine once he gets close enough to say hello, but all the barking could be disruptive for you and any other clients.  And the other dogs might not react so well with a giant pyr barking loudly as they come in.  Just some food for thought..."
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,jgiza,2,Fri Jun 19 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we had to prove that we had a solid fence. We've been lucky and our yard and house seems to be enough for our woof, but I understand that they like to range."
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,RaiderRaiderBravo,3,Wed Jun 24 03:58:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have already said the main points I wanted to get across, but just to reiterate:  1) Pyrs love to roam.  We thought we'd be safe with an electric fence and living quite far from a main road, but that wasn't the case, unfortunately. (Our pyr still managed to go the main road and got hit by a vehicle. ):  Our pyrenees actually came to us by traveling fifteen miles OVER the mountains to look for their mom, who came to our house a day earlier by doing the same.  We were able to get a hold of the owners and they let us keep the puppy as a reward.)  2) They do make ""rounds,"" which involves a lot of barking.  You'll end up with little dirt/no grass paths that circle your property from their rounds.  Some do it on a schedule (mine did it in the morning and at night most of the time), but others do it when they see fit.  This makes for great protectors though, and they scare off a lot of animals, like deer, that would feed on our plants and shrubs.  3) They do like to sleep when they aren't making rounds and will dig holes to nestle into the cold dirt to cool off.  These holes can be pretty large, as they like to fit their entire body in them.  Some will even crawl under buildings (sheds and whatnot) to make such holes to make it even cooler, depending on how hot it is where you live.  4) Pyrs herd their humans as well as other dogs.  They'll stick their butt up against you a lot, especially if they think you're threatened.  Makes navigating a bit difficult, but not impossible, haha.  5) They are pretty stubborn and highly independent, as the other points hint at.  Ours would let us love up on him for a little bit but after a while, he'd just want to lie down and be on his own.  Made calling his name a little difficult as well because he would either be in the middle of his rounds and not want to stop, or he just felt like he didn't need to come to us, haha.  I know this all sounds like a lot of negatives, but pyrenees are really great dogs and I hope this doesn't scare you out of having one.  They're the greatest cotton-headed ninny-muggins' you'll find. (:"
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,havaita,3,Sat Jun 20 09:00:56 2015 UTC,"Good post. We've experienced all of this as well. I'm a little concerned for OP since our pyres first love is always wanting to go out to lay out and be a nosy neighbor monitoring everything with those radar ears. Without a solid, fenced yard, I'm not sure how we would manage.  edit: Cotton headed? Nah, they're just more aware of the threats that threaten you! :) Namely, the young pup that likes to bark two doors down (probably a wolf or coyote or worse!)."

greatpyrenees,3afwb6,m1n4,3,Sat Jun 20 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"Stopping in for a quick and un-happy update for any interested parties.  The place was a disaster. I was not permitted to take photographs, but perhaps if the news article that was being documented is put up online I'll link that for anyone interested.   The puppies are very ill, as is mom. There were two litters on site; the young ones seem to be between 6 and 7 weeks and the older ones were closer to four months or so. The older litter is highly frightened of everything, poor babies, and will need lots of care to trust anyone other than themselves.  The younger litter, unfortunately, seems like most of the babies have parvo. We were too late to save one of them, who passed sometime Monday evening or early Tuesday morning. The rest of the pups are now in ICU at the vet to hopefully survive parvo and get ready to survive the rest of this traumatic experience!  Obviously I did not bring 'my' pup home. Obviously. He's in ICU with his littermates, and it's much too early to tell if any of them will pull through.  I apologize that I cannot provide more happy news, aside from the fact that all the dogs were removed from the premises and are now getting medical care.   For the sake of not flooding the thread with unhappy news; I'll update again only if it's good. If any of you are personally interested in more updates---regardless of outcome---then just hit me up with a private message.  Thank you all again for your comments and tips. I wish I would have known before posting just how dire the situation was!"
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,mikachops,2,Wed Jun 24 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"They're really quick learners but  this require consistency and firmness. Never let them win, no matter how long you need to stand there. This is especially important when they're young. It might take a few months but they'll get into a routine and start to chill :)  Just don't underestimate a Pyrs stubbornness. Accept it early and you'll be happier for it."
greatpyrenees,3afwb6,codeninja,3,Sat Jun 20 14:12:09 2015 UTC,"Congratulations. You are now the proud owner of a highly independent and opinionated pup. you will do well now to give up your opinions and make life easier.  The one thing that I can say that worked for us is to establish dominance early in the areas that you really care about, like the bed. But allow the dog enough freedom that he doesn't feel restricted such as the couch.   It did take our new dog quite a few weeks to get used to the concept of being our dog. We almost actually took him back because this took us by surprise. And we didn't know what to expect. We didn't think he was liking his home. It wasn't aggressive he was just very standoffish. Give him time and he'll come around and be the loyal family dog that you are looking for.  As for training, just don't. He might sit, he might even lay down. But don't expect to walk him off leash. They tend to go wherever they want to go on their own. The first time I tried to walk him off leash and running in the park he decided to join up with an old man on a walk and followed him to his house before I could catch up to him.  That said leash training is vitally important. But I'm sure you know that having another dog already.  Another vital thing to do is to socialize your new dog. He will be loyal and faithful and loving around the family but he might be jittery and aggressive when new dogs are around or new people come to the door. Take him to the dog parks and practice door etiquette early. He will be a giant dog and nothing's worse than a giant dog crushing the mailman trying to deliver your fragile package.    Our ritual is they must sit on the carpet before the door is opened and until the door is closed they cannot get up. This often leaves me with my visitor at the door on pause while I reset my pyr. But nowadays when the doorbell rings he barks his head off but he's sitting before I can even get downstairs which is awesome.  To recap lose the couch, win the bed, control the door, and train your dog as best you can . the rest is just a fluffy ball of fun"
greatpyrenees,3a1myb,horse__tornado,2,Tue Jun 16 15:04:31 2015 UTC,Ha!  Isn't it crazy?  We take ours in the yard to brush him and end up raking up a bag of fur!
greatpyrenees,39ubdf,Angry_Apollo,6,Sun Jun 14 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, why do you want a dog door? Pyrs are great pets, but her outside privileges are something we have to heavily monitor because of roaming and barking tendencies. Maybe your dog didn't inherit any of that from the pyr side."
greatpyrenees,39ubdf,lexarexasaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:57:17 2015 UTC,I want him inside for the A/C being in central Texas. He didn't seem to get the double-coat. I want him outside because I'm away for so long in the day and if coworkers are going out I don't want to have to turn them down to go let my dog out. He doesn't bark much at known variables. Plus I may be getting a roommate with a dog anyway.
greatpyrenees,39ubdf,lexarexasaurus,2,Mon Jun 15 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I guess you would know by now if he was a barker. And that makes more sense, I live in a colder place so I didn't think about that :)"
greatpyrenees,39ubdf,jgiza,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:54:34 2015 UTC,Well supposedly the Great Pyrenees is super popular in central Texas to guard ranches. The dual coat acts as a winter coat and summer coat act as a/c from what I've heard. I just live in the city and have a mix Pyr though.

greatpyrenees,374d4q,Hambone505,4,Sun May 24 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"It will get better! Ours was just like this as a puppy and basically as time went on, she got more and more comfortable in her kennel. She now goes in there and hangs out on her on! It's amazing. I would just make sure it's a positive place for her and one of the biggest things we did was making sure we didn't only put her in there when we were leaving, so she didn't associate the crate with being left alone. So we'd put her in for a little bit while we were hanging out in there with her too! I think that helped a ton."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,truthislife,4,Mon May 25 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"Well done on taking her in and fixing her up. I hate to be the one to say this and I'm sorry if i sound like an asshole but this dog is a LSG and should never really be in a crate at all. LSG are very independent and need space to stretch and walk. Its like saying to Usain Bolt, there's 2 meters go sprint!   How long does she be in the crate for? Has she had the pups? Lots of good Livestock Guardian forums out there too that a really helpful."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,FlashTheGash,2,Mon May 25 07:45:06 2015 UTC,"Varies on the Pyr.  We started with a puppy.  We did the typical happy place approach and by month 4 or 5 he had enough of it.   Doesn't like being confined in.   Rescued a 1.5 yr old female.   I initially crated her for the first couple weeks and she was very content and kenneled on command.  But i prefer not to crate and she showed no signs of destruction.   From other owners I've known through the rescue, I say 25% crate.  Some hate it and break out and some don't mind.   I would say on average Pyrs hate crating more than any other breed.  The female is the boss, but the lap dog.   The male still has a lot of puppy energy yet at 2.5 years.   Both very protectant of their house/yard.  So i don't crate because they have the instincts to guard.  Different strokes for different folks, however."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,Fulmario,3,Mon May 25 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely make it a 'good' place. When you are home leave the door to it open and hide treats in it under a towel or something. You can also give her meals in it. Anything to encourage her to go in there on her own and be rewarded for it. Pyrs do best with positive reinforcement. Also since dogs are den animals keep that in mind for the crate, it should be in a low activity area and possibly covered with a blanket except for one side."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,retardedphoenix,4,Mon May 25 05:51:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking her in. What worked for us was to make the crate a happy place. Kept his favourite bedding in there, would always make sure a special treat was in there with the door open so he could come and go as he pleased when we were home. Also covered the crate to make it more cave-like. Took a while, but eventually he started sleeping in the crate on his own. You may want to ask one of the rescue sites Southern Ontario has some great members that may offer better advice."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,Curmudgeon,2,Mon May 25 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"Another tactic to use is to put her in the crate at least 10 minutes before you leave and not pay her any mind.  It would allow her to calm down and show that you leaving is not directly associated with the crate since right now she sees that crate = you leaving.  We had that issue with our dog, and now we can tell him to ""get in the box"" and he goes over and lays down in it like a good boy.  Though the next week he gets to roam the kitchen while we are gone since the vet put him on medication that makes me need to go potty more often and he has already had one accident in the kennel so far."
greatpyrenees,374d4q,gatowman,2,Mon May 25 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the input guys! It has already gotten better. The happy place approach seemed to help a bunch. Ive actually been physically getting in the crate with her for 20 min a day and calming her down. I can see her anxiety level drop. Ive slowly started putting her in there without me now. I'm still working on it, we will see how it goes in the next few weeks. Thanks redditors."

greatpyrenees,32r2ew,Chreeeees,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Poor guy hates brushing, wherever he needs it.  He'll let me furminate his back (which is easy), but the tangles really form wherever he sits on his tail or under his collar, and when I get to those areas, he scoots."
greatpyrenees,32r2ew,Chreeeees,2,Thu Apr 16 14:18:18 2015 UTC,"One of mine will sit still and loves it. Other, not so much! Haha. I used to use a Furminator, but I found it to be a bit harsh on their fur, and it wasn't nearly as effective as the Oster."
greatpyrenees,32r2ew,adgal617,2,Thu Apr 16 14:29:52 2015 UTC,He looks soo handsome! Corduroy has that bandana too. My favorite :)
greatpyrenees,32r2ew,adgal617,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Is Corduroy also from BigFluffyDogs? They rescued Griffin in Tennessee!  He was found in a shack, but had it rough beforehand.  http://i.imgur.com/CeG5zW0.jpeg  And we still use his face as a posterchild some days:  http://i.imgur.com/7PHRIuY.jpg"
greatpyrenees,32r2ew,Heanthor,2,Thu Apr 16 19:02:01 2015 UTC,He is from Big Fluffy Dogs. We are the second home they placed him with as I guess the first household couldn't take care of him anymore. He's from Tennessee too. Found duct taped to a tree. I don't have before pictures but I take a ton now:   http://packdog.com/corduroy  Griffin is gorgeous! I'm sure you guys spoil him rotten. He deserves it!

greatpyrenees,31ccu3,amndagbns,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"These pictures span from when we first got her, which was three weeks ago, to today. So she's 6-9 weeks old in these pictures!"
greatpyrenees,31ccu3,flignir,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"Uh oh, in #7, she's turning into a white walker!!  Somehow, I knew it would be a Pyrenees puppy that this happened to."

greatpyrenees,31b89v,Kimmie77,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"My pyr tore his ccl when he was 10 or 11 months old. Waited a while to fix it because we didn't know how bad it was. He could still walk and run but his leg would always be shaking after and I noticed as time went on he would put less and less weight on it. Anyway took him to the vet then a specialist. He was out for 2 or 3 months after the surgery with little to no movement, except rehab, which I recommend at least 2 or 3 times until you know the exercises and can do them yourself with your dog. The vet swore to us to lock him in a cage but he hated it so I would just leave him in a room with me and he was okay with that and did very little movement. The vet also said with big dogs and dealing with this injury that they are likely to tear the other one due to them putting their weight on it for so long during the injury. All and all it was expensive but I don't regret it. My dog is doing fine and running around and I have yet to see any problems so far. Hope this helped"
greatpyrenees,31b89v,GentlemanBaller,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"This sounds exactly like Dakota, he is still using it although when he stands he holds it off the ground and will limp when walking but when trotting/running seems to use it normally.  Did your dog end up tearing the other one as well?  I'm really concerned that will end up happening.  I was thinking along similar lines that if I restrict him almost completely during the healing process it will minimize the chance of him tearing the other one as well."
greatpyrenees,31b89v,GentlemanBaller,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"So Boe is now just over 2 years old and still no issues with his other leg and he plays and runs with no restrictions. I was told the same thing by our vet specialist about the possibility of him injuring the other leg, and I'm sure it's different for every dog, but I have had no cause of concerns thus far. Even during the restriction period I didn't really keep him completely immobile by locking him in a cage for most of the day, like what was recommended. But that was just because he hated it so much and would cry the whole time. I did do rehab but only 3x because of the price. After 3x I knew most of the exercises to do with him to strengthen his leg without injury and after that it just took time before he was back to normal. Let me know if there is anything else you need to know"

greatpyrenees,30u5ly,cheesedoodleempire,2,Mon Mar 30 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"Woof! What was that? It seems ominous, like a leaf or a zombie! Woof!...It's ok. Thank you good girl! Woof!"
greatpyrenees,30u5ly,RaiderRaiderBravo,2,Tue Mar 31 04:48:04 2015 UTC,I was so excited when I saw that pyr peeking through the window! My guy creeps all the time! He just looks and then goes back to something else while my other dogs would be going nuts at the window.
greatpyrenees,30sxt7,TanithArmoured,8,Mon Mar 30 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Great Pyrenees who are raised as household pets have a deep, deep attachment to their families. I know it sounds silly; they're described as ""independent"" all the time... but when people are their flock, that's all they've got.   Your new dog is probably super stressed out about her new surroundings AND deeply sad about her old family. What you can do to help is stick to a routine so she gets used to the way things work at your house. Have her meals and outside time at roughly the same time every day. Have a ""goodnight"" routine when it's time to go to bed. Have a leaving and coming home from work/school routines too! Offer her lots of pets and treats and/or toys if she shows any interest in you guys, but give her some space if she wants to be alone. She will need more than a few days to fall for your family, but once she does you'll have a friend for life!"
greatpyrenees,30sxt7,gogogadgetpants_,2,Mon Mar 30 14:42:25 2015 UTC,Spot on. We adopted a 4 four old from a rescue and for the first week or two she hide under the table and by a side door away from us as much as she could. 6 months later she can't get enough pets and attention.
greatpyrenees,30sxt7,RaiderRaiderBravo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you for the advice!"
greatpyrenees,30sxt7,Fulmario,4,Mon Mar 30 14:48:26 2015 UTC,Slow and steady just like what /u/gogogadgetpants_ said.  Thank you for taking in a Pyr in need.
greatpyrenees,30sxt7,Chreeeees,3,Mon Mar 30 15:06:58 2015 UTC,"Update: She is actually integrating really well! She's eating her food and was even running around playing with me last night! She seems like a really good girl and even though she is still shy, she is starting to become accustomed to our family (well me mostly ;) )."
