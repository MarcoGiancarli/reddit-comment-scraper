I am saying calling it Football makes sense and asking someone who had never heard of or seen either sport which one was football, the point of one is obviously to play with your feet, while the other uses your hands mostly, so oviously the one where you only use your feet to touch the ball is deserving of the title of football. One makes sense to be called football, the other really has very little justification for the name. Also, one is played all around the world, one in only a few places.

PerfectTiming,3dkd4z,timdesuyo,3,Sun Jul 19 12:33:09 2015 UTC,For those asking what she's holding its the box to a six pack of Budweiser with condiments in it. Most bars / sports bar / casual restaurants with out door seating will use the 6 pack box as a cheap condiment holder that people won't steal nor will it cost money if it gets damaged or dropped. Now beer companies often provide those type of restaurants with modified 6 pack like cardboard boxes made of plastic with pockets for condiments for free of charge as its free advertising for the beer company.

PerfectTiming,3cjk91,Mathify,5,Wed Jul 8 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"With a DSLR this is actually fairly easy to consistently achieve this without much effort. It is a general rule not to use a shutter speed faster than 1/200th of a second while using a camera mounted flash (speedlight) or you will wind up with pictures like this.  The shutter is already halfway closed by the time the light from the flash was able to travel from the flash, bounce off the subject, and get picked back up by the camera sensor.  I don't know if i would call this perfectly timed though. More like the photographer is new to using his speedlight and doesn't know not to use fast shutter speeds yet (I took plenty of shots like this when i first got my mounted flash which is why i say he is new)."

Source: had 7 bridesmaids/groomsmen at our wedding, and I genuinely would have felt bad excluding any of my gmen. Hell, there was one more I really wanted but fortunately he got to be our officiant which saved me having to cut one of them."
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,TheBrownWelsh,8,Mon Jun 29 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"Did you honestly feel that each one of your groomsmen deserved to be up there with you? Or were you just scared of making someone feel bad? That's the problem with wedding parties, they become friendship gauges. Too much drama."
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,TakeTheBlueTrain,12,Mon Jun 29 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly; every single one of them deserved to be up there with me, absolutely. Not just because ""they're my friends"" but because they've been integral both in shaping who I am today and because they're a big part of our relationship. They weren't just close to me, they're close to my wife too. Even the best man who had only met my wife once had taken the time over the years to get to know her from 5000 miles away. I don't have a lot of close male friends, but the ones I do have are extremely important to me. Like a genuine family bond, we love each other no matter what and go above and beyond for each other. Each one of those guys has at some point or other done something for me that I could never expect from ""just a friend"". Hell, just the help and support they gave throughout the wedding planning phase was more than I could have hoped for.  It might be hard to believe, but it's the honest truth; each of those guys are so close and special to me that I wouldn't have felt right excluding any of them. However, it did get a little awkward trying to choose just one Best Man from that group. That's when I got scared of making someone feel bad/drama. I was told that they'd understand if they weren't picked - nope. One or two got a little butthurt for a quick minute. They got over it but it was an awkward conversation I was not prepared for."
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,TheBrownWelsh,2,Mon Jun 29 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"Are you my fiance? He has 9 groomsmen. I was super against this - I was hoping for 4 or 5 on each side - but his answer was almost the EXACT answer you just gave. I just couldn't argue with that. I ended up with 6, I was able to ask a close friend who lived farther away and another close friend I had recently gotten close to. It's a great group of people, and we're having a rather large (close to 200 people) wedding so it won't look too weird."
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,girls_might_poop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"Ha, we had about 200 at our wedding last year too. The larger audience does help to make the wedding party not look too huge. My only complaint is that even though we had an even number on both sides, the pics are lopsided because the girls are smaller and therefore can stand closer together, so it looks like I've got way more on my side.  Good for you for going asymmetrical! My wife didn't get to be a bridesmaid for one of her supposedly closest friends because her fiance wouldn't abide by uneven numbers and he only had 4 people as his groomsmen. She's pretty bummed by it.  I honestly wanted one more person as a groomsman but he was so special that we had him marry us instead, which actually worked out better because out of everyone he was the closest to both of us (old roommate from before we were dating and just living together as friends). He was an honourary groomsman for the sake of all the pre-wedding celebrations and gifts and stuff.  Hell, we even had the cliche ""groomsman-and-bridesmaid-are-bitter-exes"" issue and even that went off without a hitch.  Congrats on getting married, and I hope your day is fabulous!"
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,TheBrownWelsh,2,Mon Jun 29 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"Lopsided, shlopsided. It's no big deal nowadays - I feel like people are going more lopsided than ever. It's supposed to be who you're closest to, not just to make the pics even. That's so great that you got your mutual friend to marry you!! That sounds so sweet!!  The only thing I'm actually concerned about is we'd like the wedding party to come out halfway through our first dance song (it's a long song.) Various people have significant others. I need to put together a list of who should dance with who, and hope for nobody leftover :("
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,girls_might_poop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty happy when people have lopsided wedding parties. Shows they went for the spirit of it rather than the look.  Not sure if this helps, but we wanted the exact same thing for our first dance. However, we didn't want to force people to couple up/dance alone, so we figured we'd cut our dance short and switch it to party mode halfway through.  We found both the original version and a techno remix of our first-dance song, spliced it together at a perfect spot, and instructed all our groomsmen/bridesmaids to just storm the dancefloor and go wild ""when the time is right"". When the EDM kicked in, it took less than 15 seconds to get all the wedding party and most of the able-bodied audience boogieing on the dance floor. Worked perfectly.  The thing that concerned us was the dinner table. Having 17 people in the wedding party at a single table was bad enough, but my wife didn't want members of the wedding party with SO's and kids to have to eat separately from each other, so we ended up with this giant ""Last Supper"" looking setup with about 25 sat around it. Looked ridiculous to me but again, with a large audience it seemed to look fine in the end."
PerfectTiming,3bhlrg,TheBrownWelsh,2,Mon Jun 29 20:22:00 2015 UTC,OMG the dinner table!!!

When you have this high of an aperture, moving forward or backward an inch will cause your shot to go out of focus. So this picture coming out good is implying that he fell PERFECTLY sideways.

PerfectTiming,3augw0,LaminatedSteel,6,Tue Jun 23 20:45:26 2015 UTC,So you do this... awesome.   Do you train in inlines? What are your pet peeves about this?   cheers
PerfectTiming,3augw0,masterwit,14,Wed Jun 24 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, mostly in inlines these days as lack of ice availability in my area makes it tough to train on ice. Plus, you can just go skate on an outdoor paved path if the weather's nice. More facilities are readily available when you don't have to rely on some giant frozen thing. :) Hmm, hard to say. I usually get asked the same couple of questions about the sport, and that can be a little tough. But overall, I'm happy to explain anything, considering it's a niche sport and trying to get people interested is always a plus. Here are three most common questions I get asked:    Q: You're a speed skater? Do you skate on an olympic track? A: There are all kinds of tracks, depending on ice or inline. What most people are familiar with (because they saw it at the winter olympics), is ice speed skating. There is short track and long track ice. Short track is a smaller track where 1 lap = 111.11m (9 laps = 1000m), and can fit on any standard hockey rink. Long track is a 400m oval, roughly the size and shape of your typical high school running track. In the U.S., there are only two indoor ovals - one in Salt Lake and the other in Milwaukee WI. As for inline skating, there's indoor and outdoor. Indoor has a 100m lap (10 laps = 1000m), and is done on roller rinks with wooden floors. Outdoor can be done pretty much anywhere that's paved, and the track can be pretty much any shape. Additionally, there are banked tracks of varying lengths and banked pitches. Q: You're an inline speed skater? Is that like ice speed skating? A: Basically, yes. They're pretty much the same sport. You are going as fast as you can, and turning left. When you look a little closer, you'll find that the two sports have small differences in technique, use some different equipment, etc. But in the grand scheme of things, they're quite similar. Q: What distances do you skate? A: This is entirely dependent on ice/inline, the event and the athlete. There are so many factors that go into this. When you get to the professional level, athletes generally train for either sprinting or distance. Even within those two, an athlete may only specialize in a single distance. If you're at a more amateur level, when you go to a race you just sign up for everything. Additionally, your age group that you'd race with will also determine how far your distances will be. Distances for short track and long track ice vary, as do indoor and outdoor inline. There are individual events and relays. It's all over the place.   I hope you enjoyed this wall of text, feel free to hit me up with more questions if you're interested.  TL:DR   Yes Not much"

PerfectTiming,3augw0,SloppyJoe33,4,Wed Jun 24 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I've finished several races with my front wheel slightly off the ground and nothing was ever said about it.  It is extremely beneficial to keep it as flat as you can though, because it will trip the light gate/timer that much faster and your time will be recorded that much sooner."

Not long after that, 5x90mm and 4x100mm popped up (also 4x90mm for smaller skaters).  To throw in something different, Bont made a 5x88mm setup (which I tried and liked, despite its heft).  It was then shown that the 4x100mm was rocking everyone's world.  I was setting personal bests with it, I was able to maintain higher speeds with ease, but hills became just slightly more difficult (but still very manageable).  I think the new thing is a 4x110mm setup.  I haven't competitively skated in about four years.  Feels bad, man."

PerfectTiming,3augw0,thanksforposting,-95,Wed Jun 24 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"He tried extending his leg but likely lost control after this picture:   The arch of the back rollerblade boot is parallel to the ground Their back knee is one inch off the ground Both of their skates are facing outward from his body. Front skate appears to be slanted at greater than a 45 degree angle.   So I think it is safe to say that his skin would at least touch the ground shortly after this pic and lost some control, thereby constituting a fall from a skating position."
PerfectTiming,3augw0,SPDSKTR,45,Tue Jun 23 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.  Like I said in another comment, many skaters use this maneuver to gain an extra bit of distance right at the line.  I, too, have done this countless times without incident.  To an uninformed spectator, it really does look like I'm about to eat shit."
PerfectTiming,3augw0,PM_ME_UR_JUGZ,-72,Tue Jun 23 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that skaters use the same maneuver at shallower angles - The only thing I doubt is that given the steep angles of this skater that I pointed out, I believe that this skater touched the ground or did not fully recover because this is steeper than any other inline skater I've seen, including these two skaters performing a similar maneuver from an inline marathon:   Left skater: Back foot's front wheel has clear contact with ground and is facing downward more than facing backward, whereas my pictured skater has their back foot facing nearly straight backward.  Front foot's angle is less steep than my pictured skater. Right skater: Back foot is same as left skater.  Front foot is completely flat with ground.   There are the thoughts going through the head of a guy like me who doesn't skate.  If you have video of someone successfully performing this move at the same or steeper blade angles than I pictured, then great - I'd certainly like to admire it and give respect to whoever pulls it off.  I just don't think this particular guy pictured pulled it off."
PerfectTiming,3augw0,vinnie_the_chin,41,Tue Jun 23 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"But some one who does the sport and has pulled off the maneuver is wrong, but you're right because you say so."

I happen to be giving greater weight to my logical obervations about angular steepness in the picture than I am personal ancedotes (e.g. ""I've done that move"") that don't address the steep angles pictured here."

PerfectTiming,3a6d5i,hinklefinkledinkledo,52,Wed Jun 17 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"When I was in High School, we did a production of ""Merlin's Tale of King Arthur's Magic Sword"" where I got to be in a sword fight.  The theater only had these swords that were basically 3 foot long lengths of 1/4"" steel that had been cut out with a torch from a sheet with a simple cross piece tack welded on.  The handle was just pipe insulation wrapped with electrical tape.  These things weren't sharpened, but they were ugly, jagged, unpolished lengths of nasty.  We figured out that glancing blows would make sparks and choreographed those into the fight sequence... but since we were kids, with no real training and too much enthusiasm, we banged the hell out of each other's hands all the time... to the point where we had to wear gloves (work gloves spray painted black) by the end of the run.  The sparks from steel on steel didn't look like those in the picture, there would be one or 2 really bright blobs that would fly off.  Exactly like if you glance a nail with a hammer (which makes sense since it is exactly the same scenario).  The look in the kids eyes in the audience when they saw us hit those swords together to make sparks was amazing.  I've never been famous, but damn, that made me feel famous."

PerfectTiming,3a6d5i,Ventrex,23,Wed Jun 17 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that is not true. Most historic documents teach to parry with the edge, particularly in European swordfighting, as this creates something called binding.  Additionally, due to the shapes of most guards, if one were to parry with the flat, they could simply slide their sword down the length of your blade and into your hand. Not so if you were to parry with the edge, where both the tension of the bind, and the guard, protect you.  Source: casually practice HEMA"

That section doesn't need to be particularly sharp because the part doing the real cutting is the farther two-thirds.  It was apparently a thing with broadswords as well."
PerfectTiming,3a6d5i,alterpanda,2,Wed Jun 17 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"When your fighting with swords, you really don't care about the edge of your blade. You care about killing the other guy.

PerfectTiming,3a6d5i,the_corruption,6,Thu Jun 18 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"You have very small nicks that will not ruin a sword in a single bout of combat. It will still slice through someone just fine.   Once you are out of combat you can resharpen the sword.   The damage a sword gets is like a quarter of a quarter of an inch. Its miniscule. Considering most unarmed sword fights generally last a matter of moments you have bigger concerns than the state of your blade.   A car is something you use for hours, days and weeks. A sword fight lasts moments. Your swords are going to contact like couple of times at most."

PerfectTiming,39rj1s,IsThisMeta,2,Sun Jun 14 07:16:15 2015 UTC,"The difference is the skin it has, android is an open platform so every company makes it's own skin of android, HTC has Sense UI, Samsung has Touchwiz, LG has something else, they are all heavy and big, think HP laptops vs macbooks, HP pre installs a bunch of bloatware. Samsung and every other manufacturer other than Motorola install uninstallable apps on their phones that slows them down. That's why many owners install custom ROMs on their androids(think jailbreaking your iPhone).    The galaxy s6 is one of the best smart phones but Samsung is still screwing it because they install bloatware in it, this year significantly less than previous years but still too much.    The Nexus lineup is Google made, they give you pure android, meaning nothing but Google apps pre installed, just clean and sleek, similar to the iPhone.    Honestly speed comparison is worthless nowadays because 90% of flagships perform flawlessly without lag, it's just numbers to boast how android is better. But we still have some losers, for example HTCs latest flagship the M9 is one of the worst phones this year and it costs 800€ off contract.    What makes a flagship? Remember the iPhone 5s and c lineup? In android world the iPhone 5s would be a flagship and the 5c would be the other wallet friendly phone. A flagship is the latest greatest phone with all the cool features and is thus the most expensive."

In all actuality, it doesn't matter, Samsung is basically TouchWiz. I just tell people, I'll never buy an apple product, but other people should, because I'll just scoop up shares and make money off that.

In any case, here's a fact about the behavior that I recall hearing, perhaps from the Blackfish documentary:   This is actually documented at Marineland or Seaworld as learned behavior that one whale taught to the others. (Maybe not this specific instance)  Apparently one whale realized that if he regurgitated the normal fish diet on to the surface, it would attract gulls. So he'd do it and wait under the surface for the right time. The other whales learned how and now they all do it in some capacity."

PerfectTiming,3917pd,muskrat42,147,Mon Jun 8 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"It basically comes down to the process of natural selection due to reproductive benefit. All worker bees (the ones that sting) are female, and because the queen is the only bee in the hive with the ability to produce viable eggs (except in the case of supercedure cells and the sort), worker bees have no reproductive purpose. They lose their stingers after they sting because that leaves the venom sack attached to the sting-ee's skin, which can keep on pumping venom in for minutes.

PerfectTiming,3917pd,gnualmafuerte,7,Mon Jun 8 22:29:01 2015 UTC,Solitary bees and wasps don't have barbs on their stingers (which is what causes the honey bees to disembowel themselves upon stinging) because if they die their genetic information is lost. But the honey bees are serving a colony and (if I'm not mistaken) wouldn't have individually reproduced anyway. At some point mammals evolved thicker skin and a barb proved more effective at delivering the poison more of the time.  Edit: Disclaimer - not actually beeologist
PerfectTiming,3917pd,IAmAPhoneBook,5,Mon Jun 8 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Because they didn't evolve to fight mammals. Mammals aren't really their enemy. It's mostly invertebrates they fight, and when they sting invertebrates they don't die, their stinger doesn't get stuck like that."
PerfectTiming,3917pd,fappyday,4,Mon Jun 8 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, this is a colony.   We don't yet fully understand altruistic behavior in terms of evolutionary biology, but when you are discussing a colony/hive social structure as with ants/termites/bees the colony itself, for all intents and purposes, can be treated as an organism in and of itself.   IF you can accept that these workers/soldiers themselves act as organs within a larger structure, you begin to realize why these individual critters are led autonomously by pheromones and instincts to defend their hive and, if need be, sacrifice themselves. They do so in much the same way that your body begins to shut down the organs that are not vital to your survival in the event that starvation sets in.   Remember, regardless of how stupid such an adaptation may look to us, it has led these creatures to be extremely successful. Hell, ONE ant colony essentially holds dominion over most of the Mediterranean.  That stinger had to evolve from somewhere and the cheif rule of evolution is that it can only build upon what it already has to work with. In the case of the common honeybee, it would appear that, for at least the last few millennia, having a stinger renders an evolutionary advantage that outweighs the cost of sacrificing those who sting.   Note that this is not the case with, say, hornets or wasps, which have managed to attain a similar evolutionary trait without that glaring drawback.  A great deal can be sacrificed for the good of the colony. This is what bees and ants do-- and they do it very well. They have for a long time now."
PerfectTiming,3917pd,muskrat42,2,Mon Jun 8 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"beeologists   apiarist, apiculturalist, or apicultural biologist  Honey bees have barbed stingers which are attached to muscles, nerves, and a portion of it's digestive tract.  Other bees have smooth stingers and can sting multiple times without dying.  As for why the barbed stinger evolved, who knows?  Maybe bees find barbs sexy and the bees with more pronounced barbs have a greater chance of mating.  Evolution doesn't always follow a rational course because there's no one steering it."

What you may not know about the Red Arrows is that there's actually 10 of them (or 9 at the time, as it was shortly after this :/). One of them (Red 10) keeps radio contact with the other 9 from the ground, and he arrives by helicopter.  Lucky me (and my colleague) got to be the ones who stay with the helicopter and look after it. It also happened to be landed at the bottom of a really big hill with an excellent view (AND SMELL!) of the Red Arrows.  I'm telling you now, the Red Arrows are absolutely incredible to watch when you're high enough to be able to smell their exhaust.  Here's a few photos I took.

PerfectTiming,369f1s,noodlescup,17,Sun May 17 14:59:05 2015 UTC,Yup.  Can also be caused when a flash from another camera goes off in the room.
PerfectTiming,369f1s,LiquidArrogance,-1,Sun May 17 15:06:06 2015 UTC,This is a flash from a different camera.  Edit: I don't think it's possible to do it with the cameras own flash because the flash and shutter are synchronized to whatever the shutter speed is.   Source: amateur photographer.
PerfectTiming,369f1s,alexhfl,1 point,Mon May 18 04:02:07 2015 UTC,Edit: I don't think it's possible to do it with the cameras own flash because the flash and shutter are synchronized to whatever the shutter speed is.   I agree that this is probably from a different camera (look at the shadows). However it is possible for this to happen with a camera mounted flash. I've done it before with manual flashes when I accidently set the shutter speed faster than the camera's sync speed.  This video gives a good explaination and has an example.

PerfectTiming,369f1s,browtines,11,Wed Jun 3 02:31:30 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.   The flash synced with the vertical shutter to me says the DSLR is turned sideways to frame the portrait.
PerfectTiming,369f1s,Anthaneezy,6,Sun May 17 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Either the camera has it's shutter set to a speed faster than it's flash sync speed (which is the fastest shutter speed where the first curtain opens all the way before the second curtain begins to close), or it partially sync'd to another camera's flash."

This is what's known in Australia as ""don't go in the fucking water"".  I'm a 6'6"" dude, pretty strong swimmer, and at least a small amount of experience in surf, and I went in the surf this summer at a beach where I wasn't willing to go past waist deep water. The water would rise and fall by 3' up and 3' down each wave - sometimes it was literally like this: the sand went dry all of a sudden, and I'd look around and there'd be a great big ""RUN AWAY"" wave....  Lot of fun.  But my kids were not allowed in past the very edge. But the water was so strong that my daughter was able to boogie board on the actual first wave. I'm not sure what the term is. It was literally a shore break. As in, she was being swept up the beach by a wave that had dry sand in front of it.  A group of Indian tourists were being idiots - the men were standing in shoulder deep water with their back to the waves (in their denim pants and t-shirts that they drove there in) and the women were all being sensible, standing WELL back from the edge of the water. Maybe getting their ankles wet. A wave came along and knocked them all onto the ground into 2' deep water, knocked them over like bowling pins, I picked two ten year old kids out the water who didn't even have enough water-savvy to be able to get their face of the water.

PerfectTiming,33v3u0,must_stop_frontpage,8,Sun Apr 26 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on a number of characteristics regarding the beach.  In certain beaches in Australia this is not uncommon, as there are powerful currents, called rips, taking water away from shore. In addition the angle of the sandbank and nature of the sandbar, can all contribute to creating 'dumpers' which are waves that break directly down rather than rolling in. These are incredibly forceful and when they break directly on very shallow water, which is what is being shown in the image, can cause serious injuries.  http://www.mybondisummer.com.au/Summer2014/surf-water"

PerfectTiming,33sqsx,nukefudge,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:36:37 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with this one is that someone went through the video material and cut something out of it. Not terribly immediate in character, you could say. In that sense, it's somewhat similar to freeze frames."
PerfectTiming,33sqsx,nukefudge,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:43:43 2015 UTC,"I cut everything that wasn't relevant out, and then linked the source in the comments. The source cuts away from the lightning where the gif ends.  What does ""immediate in character"" mean?"
PerfectTiming,33sqsx,nukefudge,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:51:25 2015 UTC,"Videos are a bit tricky to adjudicate, since it's a longer context than a single photo. If you think about it in terms of editing work, the less there is of that sort, the better. If someone was standing with a camera on ""autofire"" for a long time during a concert, and then went home to pick out some shots that looked ""perfectly timed"", it probably wouldn't live up to the idea of something unplanned. Cutting out the salient parts of a video, where something looks timed, amounts to the same thing.  My concern is that, with the recent slight increase in videos/gifs, we're reaching a slippery slope, where picking out stuff from material that has plenty of situations to choose from begins to undermine the idea of ""once-in-a-lifetime"", since it's very processed, and not unique at all."
PerfectTiming,33sqsx,baconhead,2,Sun Apr 26 06:03:47 2015 UTC,"The fact that the lightning bolt was caught on camera at all during a live show is pretty incredible. It's a reverse angle, one that isn't used very often. The fact that it occurred during the hook of the song is even more incredible.  And the fact that the viewer can tell the lightning is occurring during the hook (via the headbanging) really confirms in my mind that this is a very unique event and the timing of many separate factors was crucial in capturing it.   I can't be responsible for what the YouTube uploader cut out, but he in turn can't be responsible for the way the show was mixed live.   This is /r/perfecttiming material, and the fact that it garnered hundreds of upvotes over 22 hours proves that.  I would not have made this argument if you had removed it earlier, but it sat on the front page for an entire day with 90% upvotes. At what point does the community decide what good content is for the sub?"
PerfectTiming,33sqsx,redfroggy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:10:54 2015 UTC,"Let's leave aside the stuff about votes, since we regularly see irrelevant stuff upvoted. Visitors don't necessarily care about the sub.  Lightning is mentioned in the sidebar because there're just so many lightning images around. Having lightning in a video doesn't escape that commonality (I don't know the full video content, so I don't know whether it was the only time during the concert it appeared). You're right that the lightning lands at the same time as the headbanging, but does that make the portrait viable? We're still just seeing lightning, which is fetched from within a longer timeframe. Again, I liken this more to freeze frame than a single shot."
PerfectTiming,33sqsx,baconhead,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"We're still just seeing lightning.    We're not though! it's a lightning strike timed with the music at a rock concert. It's not planned and yet it's timed perfectly.   I have no idea the point you're trying to make about freeze frames. As I stated above there's three things happening here that qualify the post. Because a lot of other lightning posts are junk doesn't matter, they're not occurring during a rock concert in time with changes to the music."

Some companies only pad the bill because their customer is a gullible fop with rich parents.  The CLU is a glorified laser pointer. A range finder measures the time a laser pulse takes to reflect off a surface, then its just a GPS coordinate, a magnetometer baring, and a little trigonometry to get target acquisition. Admittedly the IR tracking is the cool part and does cost a bit (and is part of the missile, not the CLU), but  it certainly doesn't cost a quarter million to produce one."

PerfectTiming,339gvs,madnoq,4,Mon Apr 20 23:43:20 2015 UTC,It was actually a liner into the gap in right center. Opposing team only fielded 9 guys. Their right fielder was playing straight up and their center fielder was shading to left center. Huge gap in right center. Didn't have much height on it so the grass slowed it down once it reached the outfield. Got a triple out of it.
PerfectTiming,339gvs,Ilovepancakes55,2,Tue Apr 21 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"i suggest a groundball to between second and third. fairly hard descent, so not too fast/far. easy out at first, unless the third baseman has a weak arm."

PerfectTiming,339gvs,jmj919,23,Mon Apr 20 18:59:53 2015 UTC,I actually asked the photographer if he had video as I wanted to analyze my swing. Unfortunately he only took pictures.
PerfectTiming,339gvs,sportsziggy,17,Mon Apr 20 19:15:26 2015 UTC,I can tell you that you are dropping your back shoulder and locking out your front arm too early.
PerfectTiming,339gvs,SteelyDanny,10,Mon Apr 20 19:46:59 2015 UTC,Was thinking the same thing about the front arm. I was intentionally trying to hit to right center. Is the arm locking acceptable in that instance?   Edit: the pitch was on the outer half of the plate as well.
PerfectTiming,339gvs,nakilon,12,Mon Apr 20 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, if it isn't broken don't fix it.   But generally for balls on the outer half of the plate, you just want to let them get deeper in your stance instead of reaching out for them (which I know is hard in slow pitch). If you have a slight bend in your arm and lock it after contact it will give you more power. Try to focus on leading with your hands, letting the bat head follow"
PerfectTiming,339gvs,JustMe4455,8,Mon Apr 20 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"It's hit or miss (no pun intended) as you would expect a flawed swing to be. Some days it's working, some days it's not. I feel that bat drag is my biggest flaw though. If I can focus on keeping my hands inside the ball, I can usually be relatively successful."
PerfectTiming,339gvs,DontPunchBabies,2,Tue Apr 21 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"A good way to do this is think about throwing your hands at the ball, the bat will follow. Also just try to exaggerate keeping your hands in tight. The location of a pitch doesn't change your swing only the point of contact."
PerfectTiming,339gvs,MadMax808,4,Tue Apr 21 01:17:52 2015 UTC,All very true.  Something else that may help get some more power: try to get your back knee a bit lower/turn your back foot. The two will go hand in hand but it really digs down and gets as much power from your legs as you can.
PerfectTiming,339gvs,5krunner,2,Mon Apr 20 21:50:28 2015 UTC,"Also, for more power stay back in your stance just a fraction of a second longer. Your hips are a little in front of your arms. Ideally you'd be about 50/50 front weight vs. back weight when the ball hits the bat with your hips carrying you through the rest of the swing. You're out just a littttle bit early here. But this might just be a one-time instance and I'm being nit-picky."

And would try trials/speedway/flat track if given the chance, though I wouldn't spend money to try them.  Being in high school is a problem, but it's only a temporary one.

There isn't much you can do to make it safer when your body has no barrier but the padding you wear when you are being flung at up to 100mph or more across asphalt.  Here is a motosport crash compilation: https://youtu.be/EBFJ6YLPQ9I?t=7s   Also you should probably mute the volume on that video unless you like cancer. And stop watching after the first crash I linked because it's an awful video."

I am aware that racing (especially motorcycles) is very dangerous, I'm just surprised there aren't more accidents.  A testament to the technology and the drivers'/riders' skill clearly."
PerfectTiming,32jvza,askeeve,5,Tue Apr 14 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"I imagine that many don't make it to the level of racing that we see in the video, just like so many don't make it to the pro level in sports because of injuries. I remember hearing some statistic about how for every pro althlete that you see, there's another that would have been just as good but they sustained some sort of sports injury. But we generally don't think of those people when we are watching those who made it.  Also I remember my friend telling me about how it used to be common to see motorcycle racers hobble out to their bikes on the starting line, usually a few of them are limping and such. But as long as they can ride effectively that's what they care the most about."
PerfectTiming,32jvza,Numiro,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"Talent is obviously paramount at a professional level but longevity is just as important. Luck is one aspect but a lot more can probably be attributed to genetics, mechanics and their style of play.  Just as one example, there's a reason Nolan Ryan played into his 40's and Kerry Wood (sorry Cubs fans) crumbled in his prime when he seemed destined to be one of the very greatest and it has nothing to do with talent.   Anyway, just trying to point out that while some talents don't make it to the pros because of a sheer dumb luck career ending injury, most don't make it because of other factors that were never going to allow them to ultimately avoid that injury in the first place."
PerfectTiming,32jvza,comrade_commie,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about many people not making it to the pro level.  And I'm sure racers like many other athletes face all kinds of problems the longer they do their sport.  Racing probably requires slightly less from your entire body than a ""ball"" sport, so it would make sense that people could limp but still ride well.  I just know that even at the pro level there used to be deaths (plural) every season.  As far as I understand that aspect has improved significantly.  It is still obviously very dangerous."
PerfectTiming,32jvza,ball_gag3,3,Tue Apr 14 12:57:12 2015 UTC,"I am aware that racing (especially motorcycles) is very dangerous   This in general doesn't hold the same weight it used too, it's comparatively safe these days, where for example Formula 1 haven't had a lethal accident since 1994.   In motoGP, this is generally done by having plenty of run off area, if you fall of a bike you have a lot of momentum, but practically all of that force is going forwards, so if you have to slide through a few hundred meters of gravel and asphalt most of that momentum is going to be spent by friction. Sure, getting run over is bad, but that scenario is rare and the drivers are all elite drivers."

PerfectTiming,32jvza,woodhouse17,-1,Tue Apr 14 12:54:16 2015 UTC,Not sure where you get your data from. Motorcycle racing is actually safer than most auto sports. Since 1910 there has been 200 deaths due motorcycle racing while auto racing has accounted for well over 500.   A motorcycle weighs ~350lbs and carries maybe 4 gallons of gas. A car weighs ~3000lbs and carries up to 20 gallons of gas.  The later is a much more dangerous outcome when you lose control.  A typical motorcycle racing track will usually have a fair amount of sand between the pavement and any wall so on a motorcycle you typically won't crash into a wall at 150mph but rather slide on sand till you stop leaving you with maybe a rash and bruises.

The students all live in off campus housing and throw an annual party which basically turns a series of neighborhoods into one giant block party. The police decided that it had gotten too big and sent in riot police. Unfortunately, I didn't have my own camera (Nikon D80), but I had borrowed a friends point-and-shoot, so I started taking pictures of the riot police. I was promptly maced directly in the face by the riot police while wielding the mighty camera as my weapon. I didn't think I was overstepping my bounds, at least not to such an extreme degree, but either way, I got a great picture, so the hour and a half of feeling like my eyes and face were melting off were more than worth it :)"

Vanilla yogurt, a glass of milk, 4/5 tums, and an asthma attack stifled by an epi pen in the first 5 minutes.  He then was helped to rinse his upper body and face in the shower and collapsed on our couch for a hour.

It usually works well enough and long enough to get them to calm down so they realize it's probably not as bad as they think and to prevent them from hyperventilating. Stay away from water until it stops burning, and even then only lukewarm showers and use Dawn to get it off (most pepper spray is oil-based).    My mom was a correctional officer when I was growing up, I spent some time as a correctional officer, and my husband is now a CO supervisor. I've been exposed to pepper spray more than most. Even after training where I was sprayed in the face multiple times, the milk-soaked towel trick was taught to me by a nurse who had to treat an offender I sprayed, and I wish I had known it when I was a kid and gathered my mom's capsaicin-covered clothes into my arms thinking I'd be helpful by carrying them into the laundry room."

PerfectTiming,3296x6,addledhands,2,Sat Apr 11 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"Reddit's, and most countries', resentment of police was not a majority opinion back then.   I don't really get what you mean by reddit and most countries, but the public opinion towards police hasn't changed much at all in recent years. The ""resentment of police"" is still not a majority opinion and it never was. Hating cops is a typical reddit thing because of the right-wing libertarian leaning majority. The /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut subreddit for example is 6 years old.   On the other hand that same right-wing attitude is why reddit despises activists even more. You can look up any post made about OWS when it was happening in 2011 and the majority supported cops there too. That's what makes reddit somewhat hypocritical in that regard. They are anti-authoritarian except when authority is targeting the left.   One of reddit's favorite posts is the handcuffed woman getting kicked in the head by a cop. It gets posted every year including this year and always has top comments like these   Hate to be the one, but bitch had it coming   So no, I wouldn't say things here have changed much in the past 2 years."

Hey, most of us even work for the man in one way or another.  As far as why yuppies don't tend to associate closely with hippies, why don't you? Why don't your friends? Alternatively, why do they?

After three or four times I was fed up.   I did not say I found them unnecessary. I said I found it overly regulated for my taste. Obviously it is fine for most and I'm sure they evolved logically as needs were required to be addressed.   Still, I find it overly regulated. And that's my opinion, which will obviously be different. Note I never bitched about it without context. I saw someone else had the same experience and decided to voice my similar frustrations.

Kvochur immediately turned the remaining engine to full afterburner. However his speed, at 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph), was too slow to maintain stability on one engine.

PerfectTiming,30d3da,tenhotuisku,13,Thu Mar 26 16:50:25 2015 UTC,The ejection seat pushes him upwards negating (or lessening) the downwards momentum and the chute is designed to deploy instantly.
PerfectTiming,30d3da,JimmyT91,12,Thu Mar 26 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"I get that the seat ejecting upwards lessens some of the downward force. The thing I wondered was how fast the pilot is being ejected upwards to negate the speed of a free falling plane, especially when the parachute has next to no space to slow him down. It clearly works, I'm just amazed it can work at that low an altitude. Any idea on the exit velocity?"
PerfectTiming,30d3da,tenhotuisku,4,Thu Mar 26 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"I have no clue but you can see in the video that this was far from free fall or ""terminal velocity"". The plane seemed to have traveled pretty horizontally right before the seconds leading to the crash."

PerfectTiming,30d3da,Chalmun,10,Thu Mar 26 21:34:34 2015 UTC,I'm not totally positive but I believe USAF pilots have a 2 ejection lifetime limit before they can't fly fighters anymore.
PerfectTiming,30d3da,IndustWeTrust0,11,Thu Mar 26 21:52:57 2015 UTC,There use to be a limit to ejecting back in the old F-4 days. The Martin-Baker ejection seat could do damage to a pilots spine and the general rule at the time was no more then two ejections. That policy has been phased out for quite a while since the Air Force went to the Aces II ejection system. Other air forces might still have a policy like this in place.

You can buy flushable inserts that lay between the cloth and the baby that help everything fall off into the toilet. Generally you are supposed to shake off the poop into the toilet before you wash though. Also, although most people dont do it, you are supposed to do that with disposable diapers before you throw them away.   Baby poop isn't that bad until they start eating food though.   I used both cloth and disposable for 5 years between 2 kids. I'm just glad I never have to buy or wash another diaper."
PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,raanne,3,Sun Mar 22 23:54:26 2015 UTC,"They served us well. Basically a shell and a pad (insert), ours were hemp pads. Seriously, the wash machine does the work. If a pad is extra poopy, do a 5min. pre-soak in the toilet. It is super nice not having to run to the store for this sort of thing. You always have a supply (if you are on top of the wash). And, I always appreciated just changing the diaper on a schedule without worrying about wasting disposables/money. Had a diaper rash incident just once or twice. Potty training is a lot easier (because the kid grew up feeling a little wet and associates pissing with wetness, I.e. ""I did that""). Potty trained well before 24 months. Final benefit, sold our supply to a friend (so take that gain off the original cost, and it is a total bargain - plus no landfill)!   /ramble  Edit: oh, and the best bottoms brand are made in the USA, not sure about bum genius, etc. This was important to our family.

PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,YouLikeBarney,3,Wed Mar 25 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"I've used cloth diapers for my children for 4 years, however I'm not gonna be the person to tell you one is better than the other.  I like using cloth because it's cute.  I've also found that its saved us money as I've used many of the diapers again.  And cloth diaper resell is a thing.  So eventually I'll be able to make money back on this investment.  They say it's better for the environment and it's cheaper than buying disposables.  I say to each their own."
PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,bananatomic,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:59:56 2015 UTC,For environmental reasons. Think of how many diapers are thrown away for one growing baby. Those diapers take forever to decompose. Cloth diapers are washed and reused. They have much less of an impact on the environment.   Some are also concerned about putting diaper chemicals so close to their baby for so long at such a developmental age. The cloth diapers I used on my daughter are cotton.   Cloth diapers also tend to make potty training easier. In that they allow the baby to feel slightly wet when they pee. The superabsorbant plastic disposable diapers don't let them feel wetness making it harder for the baby to understand what sensations are associated with going potty.
PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,whatisimportant,2,Sun Mar 22 23:55:20 2015 UTC,Ten years from now he will hate that this picture exists. At least you'll get to let him know it got you a lot of karma on a website called reddit.

(Popolino) While I know that there is typically an extra inlay, by mine it is from normal cotton or weed. So they soak much, but are not really absorbant in the way the disposable diapers are. (In the meaning, thst the wetness got capsuled, so they feel dry again.)"
PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,Antiochia,2,Sun Mar 22 22:48:11 2015 UTC,Cotton or what?
PerfectTiming,2zxtpc,heebit_the_jeeb,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"Weed. Beside the marihuana plants that are cultured for getting high, there are others (without high THC content) that are used to produce cloth from their fibers. Actually it was quiet common beside sheepwool, before cotton took its place. Compared to cotton it soaks  more fluid, but does so slower. So you can combine that for the night diaper by using a weed diaper inlay and additional on the babyskinside a cotton one. The cotton one will quickly soak the urine, and then it will slowly pass on to the weed inlay.  If cloth Marihuana plants have another name in english then weed, sorry from my side."

The detonation causes the ripple and the pressure change affects the refractive index of the air in the wave, which creates the distortion you can see in the photo.

Lots of kangaroos and emus wandering around free, and you could feed them. This was before pellets and Purina Kangaroo Chow was available, so people just gave them potato chips.   There's me, all of 3 feet tall (I was really short then) when a lovely, friendly roo approached me, so I gave her a chip. She liked that, so I gave her another and another. Well, I guess I was too slow because she banged up against me with her forepaws, grabbed the little bag of chips, and gave me a fair kick with her back legs, knocking me down. She then went chip-wild, and stuffed her head in the bag, eating all my chips, with me on the ground, wondering what happened.   My parents managed to get the whole sequence in snapshots. It was really very cute.   Then I was attacked by that emu...but that's another story and another bag of chips."

We were inside a large fenced area and the deer were running around with us. My brother got a bag of feed and the owner said 'now make sure you hold on to that, they'll getcha!'. Five minutes in, bro is not paying attention because we're looking at other animals, deer sneaks up and bites the bag, rips the bottom, feed everywhere, suddenly deer everywhere. Bro is like 'Hey! What the...'. One of my favorite memories from that trip haha."

My teammate gave it too much power coming out of a slow corner and looped it around. It was low speed and his momentum carried him away from following cars, so it was pretty harmless.

PerfectTiming,2xp4lq,Renegade_Meister,12,Mon Mar 2 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"By Murilo Lins - Source pic  This picture appears to be taken just before the Caiman could chomp on it, unlike a different picture of a similar scenario in which the Caiman was presumed to have chomped on the Piranha at least once prior due to blood and markings on the fish.   This seem to have been taken shortly after.  EDIT: It was also a National Geographic 2012 Photo Contest nature submission"

PerfectTiming,2xp4lq,exxocet,2,Mon Mar 2 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"One of the most common species of caiman is the Spectacled Caiman, but interestingly they don't seem to like Piranha too much.   In the Pantanal on the other hand you get these guys, the Yacare Caiman, which pretty much specialize on piranha, they would be happy to eat it every meal.  Only last year did cooperative feeding and hunting in crocodylians really get attention, but since 1774 it was written about (before the American War of Independence!). Here is a picture of some cooperative feeding in Yacare Caiman from 1991, they all form a circle and block off a channel so fish can't escape, if they don't wait their turn and cooperate the fish swim away.   Of course you can talk about crocodylians for hours, using sticks as tools to hide under to ambush birds looking for nesting material, odd heart shunts to help produce stomach acid, unidirectional breathing, play behavior, fruit eating...what else?"

However, no matter how anyone feels about exposed breasts, it is utterly ridiculous to insist on covering the area where breasts will eventually be.  When I was a kid in the 80s, I normally took off my shirt outside because it was freaking hot in the summer, and we didn't have air conditioning. I guess someone complained about it at my daycare, because one day all the girls had to start wearing shirts outside and the babysitter showed us how to tie them up to keep the most amount of skin exposed but still cover our nipples. It didn't last very long though because kids are stubborn and the adults weren't very enthusiastic about it."
PerfectTiming,2x496n,explainittomeplease,2,Thu Feb 26 01:58:38 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you why a parent might have freaked. I work at a theme park, and one day this girl, had to be about 10-13 was hanging out in front of my kiosk with her friends and people... she had boobs. Not full on titties, but the softness was coming in and they were just starting to grow in. And she was topless. None of her other friends were, and when I asked what happened to her shirt she said ""it was hot so I took it off.""  I remember when I was growing my boobs. I was so self conscious of them, so part of me was like ""Fuck yeah, good for you not giving a shit about them"" and the other part couldn't stop thinking ""I know how many pedophiles work here and hang out here"". As soon as a guy stopped and stared I texted my friend in security to come handle it (you can't just tell guests to put on shirts, that's rude). He ended up getting her a free shirt, yay for her, and it stopped being a big deal. But come on. Where were her parents to tell her to put on a shirt. What's up with her friends not saying ""that creepy guy is staring at your boobs, put something on."" Maybe they were young enough to not be aware of it, in which case I envy them so much.  As soon as the areola starts getting puffy, that's when the shirt needs to stay on. At least while you're at a theme park. Not for your sake, for ours. It's So. Fucking. Awkward to see little girl puffs out in the open.  Not saying this is what happened in your case, just sharing my story."

Here's a video showing a test shot of each type: ->  Note also that these puppies have become smarter and smarter over the years. Today, they're capable of detecting your attitude and launching you in the appropriate direction - e.g. if you're upside-down, it fires you out the bottom, if you're right side up, you go out the top; if you eject at high altitude the seat stays with you to feed you oxygen, once you get low enough it automatically jettisons to allow a safer landing. All in all, they're pretty cool.  Now, I'm not arguing these should be fitted to Formula 1 cars, but technically they would be quite feasible - hook it to a GPS and it could even do things like avoid overpasses and so on. And I suspect it would be kinda cool to see a pileup start and all these seats start popping out - just sayin'..."
PerfectTiming,2w3ern,EngineerBill,3,Tue Feb 17 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"Safety thing. I'm no expert on F1 cars, but modern cars are basically a cage with the rider in it. In a crash seat belts keep the driver in the cage, protecting them from being thrown out of the car and/or being crushed.  On a race track if you eject, you might land on the track and get splatted by another car. Or your car could be flipped in which case trying to eject might kill you due to the explosive bolts.

Additionally, even though the length scale along the direction of flow is quite large the vertical length scale is not/* so it's still very possible for surface tension to play a huge role.  /* talking about2 different length scales in te same flow is pretty meaningless mathematically but is the easiest way to articulate it."

They were watching intently as the narrator told about the ""cute seal pups......swimming around....playing together....close to their mother.... ""  But then the narration got decidedly dark: ""but the pups aren't the only animals in the ocean today...""  And then...  BAM!    A shark came from below and violently grabbed one of the seals in a scene identical to OPs picture.  Both of the boys started to sob.  They were so upset, I had to turn the TV off.

PerfectTiming,2uj1mu,mike_pants,86,Mon Feb 2 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, there's a lot of confusion in this thread about Rays, so I'm gonna try to help. The animal in the photo is a mobula Ray. They are similar to manta rays, but small enough to be an adorable house pet. They also love to leap out of the water and flap their wings and generally look awesome. They, like mantas, have no stinger, so they can't hurt people. The lady killed by a Ray was hit in the face by a panicking spotted eagle Ray, which are common in aquariums, but do have a stinger.   Steve Irwin, according to reports, was killed by a large stingray that mistook his shadow for a tiger shark, and while panicking, stabbed him in the chest with its barb. Steve pulled the part out, which had backwards pointing spines, and he ultimately bled to death. This accident was very unusual, and normally sting rays will never attack a human. Most accidents are caused by people stepping on them, and them flicking their tails in panic. Their venom, though painful, is not particularly strong, and at most causes muscle cramps."
PerfectTiming,2uj1mu,OrsonSwells,18,Mon Feb 2 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"So do they shoot the barbs? There are many stories of barbs becoming stuck in someone's chests, do they use their tails to pierce it in? Does the barb grow back?"
PerfectTiming,2uj1mu,saysAverysmallman,22,Tue Feb 3 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Great question!  They can't shoot the barbs, and in fact brushing against them will not cause you get stung. They thrust them in when they whip their tails, and the barb, located generally near the base or middle of the tail, like in this picture, breaks off and becomes lodged in the attacker, releasing the venom. This picture shows the spines on the barb that allow it to stay stuck in an animal. And yes, their stingers grow back after a few months, and the stingrays you find in touch tanks in aquariums have them removed every few months or so!"

The way a digital camera or cell phone takes pictures is by ""scanning"" across the sensor, so the bottom (or in this case, right hand side) of the image is actually captured later than the top/left. In this case, someone else was simultaneously taking a photograph with a flash. Before the flash was activated, this device (camera/phone) was able to get mid-way through its scanning cycle, then the flash from the other camera went off, then this device finished its cycle capturing the final half (right half) of the image, which was, by that time, lit by the flash.

PerfectTiming,2sws59,IndigoCup,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Your feet hit first and, while maintaining forward momentum, you allow your legs to compress and absorb the initial impact. Then you tuck your chin into your chest, brace your arms without locking your elbows and roll over one shoulder onto your back. With practice you'll just end up rolling back onto your feet in most situations. This is a pretty far ways to fall though so just not breaking anything is a win."

Are you of the belief that cats don't deserve to hunt because they were introduced? Should we intervene on new natural phenomena because our previous interventions changed things? Is losing biodiversity in small bird populations so bad we should infringe upon ""cat rights""?"
PerfectTiming,2sjsp3,Verivus,2,Fri Jan 16 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"Cats, for all intents and purposes of this argument, are an invasive species introduced in a place they would never be if it weren't for us. Cats don't have 'rights' to anything. No animal does other than anti-cruelty laws and native, endangered species.   It is common practice around the globe to protect endangered species and attempt to destroy invasive, introduced species. Australia is a famous one for their rabbits. Florida is famous for their invasive snake population. Both of these places have/had huge programs to try and get rid of these invading species because they destroy the food web. There are many, many more.   Cats don't kill just songbirds; they kill lizards, rodents, reptiles, insects, anything that moves that they think they can kill, they will. They also hunt for fun and eat only about 30% of what they catch. So 2/3 times, these native animals are dying for no reason.  Losing even one part of the food web will greatly impact the entire web, including the environment in ways we cannot imagine. Recently someone had posted an article on Reddit talking about beavers, who were almost trapped to extinction, and how their population increases have resulted in the changing courses of rivers and streams. Who knows how things would be affected if we lost some species.  Also, domestic cats are on the top 100 list of 'most invasive species' by the IUCN. The best thing to do for native species would be to cull feral cats, just like we did with rabbits and snakes in Australia and florida, but people get upset about killing cats, so no one suggests it. Neuter and release programs don't fix anything because the cats are still hunting! They don't trap nearly enough cats to stop population growth.  I can't go on anymore, but if you still can't see how invasive species are bad then you're an idiot."
PerfectTiming,2sjsp3,Decapentaplegia,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"Both of these places have/had huge programs to try and get rid of these invading species because they destroy the food web.    This is what isn't fully fleshed out. Are cats doing as much damage to meaningful populations as snakes or rabbits? Or are they eating rodents and birds which only thrive because humanity has already removed the natural apex predators? NYC might have billions of rats and no hawks, are cats a threat there?  The snake and rabbit problems you refer to were disastrous in rural areas - they were wild animals. I agree that wild cat populations would pose a risk, so trap-and-neuter programs are effective and prudent. Domestic cats however are concentrated in urban areas - are you entirely against outdoor cats? Can you provide a reputable source that these lizard and insect populations are actually being significantly impacted by domestic cats? I can only imagine that harsh weather does more damage than a thousand tabbies.  In terms of ""cat rights"", it's less about the cats and more about the movement to discourage outdoor cats as an infringement on liberties for the owner. An outdoor cat is probably happier than an indoor cat, and telling someone to keep their cat indoors is an imposition.   Who knows how things would be affected if we lost some species.   This is a frustrating, hand-wavy argument. Conservation biology has a lot more to it than ""save every species always"". Who knows how things would be affected by anthing without doing a thorough study. The cautionary principle only goes so far, we have to make decisions at some point and I don't think ""ban outdoor cats"" is a goal worth striving for (but I could be convinced).   I can't go on anymore, but if you still can't see how invasive species are bad then you're an idiot.   Also, thanks for taking your level-headed and cogent argument and totally destroying all credibility with this line. I'm clearly not against dealing with the snakes or rabbits you mentioned. An introduced and pervasive species could have any number of benefits, it depends on the parameters you examine."

Just because domesticated cats have been around for 10,000 years does not mean that our local ecosystems have had 10,000 years to adjust to an invasive predator.  Furthermore, making the accurate observation that domesticated cats are not natural predators of our ecosystems is in no way absolving other impacts humans have on the environment, and in a large way outdoor domesticated cats should be viewed as one of those human-caused impacts. This isn't an issue of blaming the cat. It's accurate to say we should keep our cats indoors to prevent billions of native birds from being killed by invasive predators in their native habitats.

Species become invasive when there is a drastic shift in populations, which do occur naturally, but somewhat infrequently due to them being primarily caused by severe weather events. More often, these dramatic shifts are caused by human activity - in this case, humans arrive, generate a lot of food garbage, attracting rats, which in turn attract cats, which in turn kill native birds.  So really, it's almost entirely the fault of indifferent human civilization."

PerfectTiming,2si1jk,iamagainstit,5,Thu Jan 15 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"Most likely he was doing a dynamic move that created his swing. On an overhanging wall like this, your feet can cut which will straighten your body vertically and then some depending on the angle. So here he moved really fast to the hand holds, feet cut backwards, he wasn't able to hold his grip and the momentum of his legs kept going backwards to the point they are higher than his head.  He is not wearing sandals."

PerfectTiming,2sg0d2,alexhfl,10,Thu Jan 15 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"FYI, you didn't take a picture during the lightning strike.  The lightning struck while your camera was taking the picture.  I'm not sure if you knew that--just wanted to share for those who are interested.  When people are looking to get shots of lightning, they'll set their camera up on a tripod, focus to infinity, and set up a fairly long exposure (maybe 1-4 seconds).  Then they set up their camera to repeatedly take pictures of the lightning area from a dry place.  The lightning itself only lasts ~1/30,000 of a second, so you just have to hope that happens during your 1-4 second exposure (the time when your camera sensor is recording)."

(neutral density - like sunglasses)  Stick a dark one (or two) of those on... set the lens to f11 (small aperture, lets even LESS light in)...  You can take a picture for 3 minutes easily..... more than enough to get some super bright lightning.

The fact that she unintentionally captured a longdog in its native habitat makes the scenario worth mentioning, given that OP was likely going to submit it regardless.  There are times when reddit is critical, and times where it's just flagrant assholery for the sake of whatever neurotransmitter release internet people get from that. The second case applies here.

And of we're talking colors, the real benefit to a DSLR is raw mode. If you're shooting JPEGs your phone is pretty comparable.   What matters are airy disks and such. Cameras also have higher speed lenses ( f/stops), which means more DoF.   Also auto mode on some DSLRs is really bad. ISO is either too high or the shutter too slow.

PerfectTiming,2s1ktp,harrisonv,1 point,Sun Jan 11 12:11:55 2015 UTC,There appears to be two separate insects due to the size difference.  The first insect is a rather medium sized grasshopper.  If you freeze the frame as it flies away it is just ordinary sized.  Then he pans to the larger insect on the side of the house - that insect appears to be a preying mantis or a preying mantis-sized insect.  The bird that captures the large insect is likely a Mississippi Kite if this was filmed in the summer (breeding season) which is likely due to the abundant presence of insects.  Still an awesome capture on video.

PerfectTiming,2qstvk,DragonTamerMCT,2,Wed Dec 31 07:46:39 2014 UTC,"No, but yes.   You didn't capture the light flowing. However your camera did take a picture right before and after the lights went on.   This is caused by a rolling shutter. Half of your image was taken before the lights were on, half after. You did not capture light ""flowing/traveling"", if that's what you thought/implied.   Anyway rolling shutters create some really cool effects, people take pictures of fans and propellers with iPhones and such all the time and it creates a really bizarre warped effect due to the rolling shutter."
PerfectTiming,2qstvk,Beastabuelos,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:49:03 2014 UTC,"In simpler terms, the bottom half was recorded before the lights were on and the top half after."
PerfectTiming,2qstvk,jchenabc,2,Wed Dec 31 02:20:41 2014 UTC,"Camera sensor reads from top to bottom, left to right. If I am not mistaken, this happens when the flash went off. and the shutter at your friend's camera is slower than the flash sync speed. So the sensor in the camera read the top part of the image when flash is on. and the flash went away when the sensor is still trying to reading the bottom of the sensor. Note the camera exposed for the bottom part, since it is so dark, camera probably picked a slow shutter speed."

As she is convinced that she needs more and more things as she grows and enters her ""tweens"" (itself a marketing invention) and teenage years, all that will change is the amount of her parents income she is able to control.   This aspect of Christmas is truly awful.   And without a hint of irony, you are looking at the bedrock upon which is built the modern international order. This is where it all starts.

It says they used the plane's built-in retractable hook with a wire put on the runway to try and slow the plane down.  The hook was built into the plane and is evidently used for when a high speed takeoff is aborted.  The picture seems to have been taken in-between when the hook caught the wire on the field and when it hit the runway.  Pretty good timing if you ask me!

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,nuclearnoodle13,8,Fri Dec 19 21:58:19 2014 UTC,"Just some trivia, the F-111 was originally built to land on aircraft carriers, hence the tailhook. When they redesigned it for regular air forces, they left the tailhook on so it could be used for emergencies - as seen here. The F-18, which replaced the F-111, has a tailhook for the same reasons."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,DaWolf85,13,Fri Dec 19 03:46:59 2014 UTC,"No it wasn't, and that's not why it has a tailhook.  The F-111 was an Air Force aircraft, not a Navy.  While they shared the F4 Phantom, this wasn't a shared bird.  Naval aircraft are purpose built to land on carriers - the landing gear has to be incredibly strong to land hard.  F-16s and F-15s have a tail hook because of either aborting a take off or hot brakes - they can use it to stop by grabbing a cable before they get to the end of the runway. I believe all tactical (fighter) bases have these on their runways.  I use to crew F-16s and we had ""barrier"" tests monthly where a jet would go out and deploy the hook to test the cable across the runway."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,DaWolf85,7,Fri Dec 19 05:45:40 2014 UTC,"The original idea was that the F-111 would be for both the Air Force and the Navy, but after testing just seven airframes, the Navy determined the planes were too heavy for their purposes. They canceled their orders and went to work on a new, lighter aircraft, with many of the ideas of the F-111. That eventually led to the F-14."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,ragingxtc,6,Fri Dec 19 13:25:33 2014 UTC,"They built a naval variant, or attempted to, but it still wasn't built for the Navy and given to the Air Force.  There's a big difference there.     Either way, my main point was that tail hooks aren't somehow a remnant like they forgot to take off during the design phase.  Anything on an aircraft is ludicrously expensive.  I've changed a fair share of pads on the f16 tail hooks.  Those things do not land on carriers and won't."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,ragingxtc,2,Fri Dec 19 14:30:39 2014 UTC,DaWolf85's comment is valid.  The original requirements were for a shared platform for both the Navy and the USAF (much like the F-4).

I agree with you, the tail hook would be there regardless of whether or not the original requirements were written with the Navy in mind.  But, he is correct in stating the Navy's involvement in the original requirements.  And, while it is true that the final production design for the USAF would have called for lighter landing gear and a less significant tailhook (among other design changes), the overall design of the aircraft still incorporates a lot of features that were intended solely to appease the Naval requirements.  Swing wings, side-by-side seating (which forced capsule ejection), dual engines (to a lesser extent) and many other major design choices were compromises made to please the Navy.  Multi-service platforms are generally a bad idea.  Hence the clusterfuck that is the F-35."

There are a lot of people talking that don't know a whole lot about aircraft or tactical aircraft in general.  Yeah, it's expensive.  The stuff I've seen... it can do some pretty awesome stuff.

Shutting down the F-22 line at 187(?) aircraft was a horrible idea.  Cost overruns on the F-35 are partially to blame for that.  In the current theater of war, establishing air superiority with the F-22 and running ground ops with the legacy fighters (F-16, F-18, A-10, etc) would be the most cost effective while providing the same results (if not better considering the legacy designs are established and proven).  But the budgets are controlled by congressmen that want to protect jobs in their districts.  anyway, sorry for the rant, thanks for the discussion, and long live the F-16.  Even if it's as a QF-16!"

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,Undercover_Hitler,8,Fri Dec 19 22:45:25 2014 UTC,"If you're landing, you've usually had a chance to line up (well enough anyway) with the runway and scrub off as much speed as possible before you touch down, you've got the entire length of the runway to slow down. That or you're not at a runway, there's no wire, so there's no use for the hook.  On takeoff if something goes wrong, you're going bloody quick and you've already used the majority of your runway. Now you need to drop from whatever your takeoff speed is when you're fully loaded with fuel, to zero mph using just 20% of the runway.  The hook isn't really necessary in landing emergencies. It's absolutely essential in takeoff emergencies where the area beyond the end of the runway isn't nice flat ground for the next quarter mile.  Source: freshly certified aircraft mechanic with zero flight hours and zero experience directly relevant to these hooks. So take what I say with a grain of salt."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,downhillcarver,2,Fri Dec 19 07:07:06 2014 UTC,What does a massive jet do when it needs to abort a take off with only 20% of the runway left?
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,Undercover_Hitler,6,Fri Dec 19 07:48:51 2014 UTC,"It doesn't.  Serious answer: I don't know. Most planes are actually rated for a higher takeoff weight than they're rated to land at, so even if a fully loaded jet managed to abort a takeoff and stop safely, it would still need to undergo a hard landing inspection.  Honestly, I can't think of any good about options for fully loaded passenger planes. The only solutions I can think of are:   power out and aim for the clearest spot within 10° of your heading. If you try to change course any more than that during takeoff when you're so close to your minim airspeed, your ailerons will lose the ability to influence your roll and and you'll do this. shut everything down. Flaps out, gear out, wait till just before impact then deploy airbrakes if present and shut down engine.   Unless there's a decent amount of unoccupied space ahead of the runway, it's gonna be messy. Examples where takeoff abortions could end very ""well"" would be runways pointing over water or farmland. The Hudson River landing is a good example of this, though Chelsey Sullenberger had more altitude than you're picturing when he lost engines. Here's a recreation which shows the situation clearly and how well he handled it.   The altitude at which these hooks help is nearly zero. With a passenger jet the best thing you can do in the case of an abort at that altitude is not be in that situation in the first place. That's just one reason why these aircraft are so meticulously maintained."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,downhillcarver,11,Fri Dec 19 08:02:04 2014 UTC,"The Sullenberger landing was also incredible because he managed to keep the engines from impacting the water before the plane could be slowed substantially.  This is important because that's why water landings are usually death traps.  Next time you're on a speedboat or bassboat, reach out the side and quickly dip your hand into the water at speed.  The force at like 50 mph will get your attention real quick.  Now imagine that at 200+ mph.  That is why you don't see a whole lot of safe water landings.  Those engines clip the water and the plane can't handle that kind of force being imparted on it.  Usually this either rips it to shreds or makes it spiral (usually also ripping it to shreds).  When pilots take off, as they are speeding down the runway, they hit V1.  This is the technical term for the ""point of no return"".  At this speed, you must takeoff no matter what.  I don't really know what the FAA/NTSB/Manufacturers call for in order to ground abort after V1.  Most pilots are trained to takeoff and get altitude so they can turn around for an emergency landing.  And, in all fairness, there are very few problems that can't be solved this way.  The few times this approach hasn't worked were massive system failures (engine rips off wing, takes part of the leading edge with it, in the process it shreds the planes hydraulic lines) and the pilots have every reason to follow it.  Assuming you aren't on the 1 in 10,000,000,000 plane that loses hydraulics systems, major flight controls, all engines, etc, most problems can be solved with enough altitude.  And most planes can fly with partial engine loss.  But I've been rambling.  The only thing I would add is to your second point, and maybe you have a reason for not ""using"" it.  Let's say in the case of your second abort that there is semi-stable land off the runway.  Maybe a field with some trees in the distance.  Why not also throw the engines into full reverse.  It might not help a ton, but it's the reason why commercial jets can land on runways as it is.  Again, maybe you have a reason for not taking this approach.  Either way, you guys have me interested.  I think I'll fire up the simulator later on and try to abort some landings out of various airports/aircraft after V1.  Maybe there is a way to keep the aircraft ""safely"" on the ground the whole time, given a certain plane, fuel load, passenger load, runway, etc."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,DaWolf85,3,Fri Dec 19 08:56:22 2014 UTC,"Well said, good points.   Reason against using thrust reverse systems as you're coming in for an emergency landing that may run off the tarmac: you are very likely to end up on your belly, landing gear on passenger Jets doesn't handle rough ground well. Once you're on your belly, or even just bouncing across rough ground, you're quite likely to damage your engine pods.  I figured the pilots would (given the time and presence of mind to do so) prep the fire bottles for two reasons. IIRC, prepping the fire bottle by turning the T-handle 90° will cut off fuel supply to that engine, kill electrical supply to that engine, kill that generator, cut off hydraulic lines to that engine, basically isolate that engine from everything.  Obviously isolating the engine will shut it down, as it no longer has fuel. Thrust reverse systems are dependant upon engine power to operate.  By prepping the fire bottles and isolating the engines, you've done the best you can to remove fuel sources and spark sources from the engines. You've also now got the fire bottles ready to fire simply by pulling the T-handles.  That was really my only reason not to use the thrust reverse system.    Edit: a word. Excuse any typos I missed, mobile."

So grain of salt and all that.   Many Airlines won't even hire pilots who have their mechanic certification. Reason is, if something goes wrong midflight they want the pilot focusing entirely upon following procedures and getting the plane safely on the ground. Mechanics have a tendency to be trying to mentally figure out what's wrong with the plane and how to fix it."
PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,downhillcarver,2,Sat Dec 20 18:08:22 2014 UTC,"What happens when you abort after V1 is a runway excursion. That is the  idea of V1; if you try and stop after this point you're going to crash. Technically it's possible to have an abort just after V1 that doesn't go off the runway, just because it's not a perfect estimation, but it's a >95% chance you're having a nice little excursion in the grass.  But it's always better to crash on the ground, than to crash in the air. If you don't think your plane will make it back around for a controlled landing, then you'll want to stay right down here on earth."

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,MeccIt,3,Fri Dec 19 15:05:40 2014 UTC,"I assume you're talking about the first clip as the second is pretty standard procedure until the geese showed their true colors.   That's a military plane, so I'm not sure what is a normal angle of ascent for them. It does look pretty steep at first, however this is a military vehicle, I'm sure it's designed for a pretty aggressive rate of climb. That rate of climb did not look unsafe, but it was most definitely aggressive.   The problem came later when they attempted an aggressively banked turn at low airspeed. Never a good idea.   What appears to have happened is they attempted too steep a bank at too low an airspeed. The wings began to lose lift, and I'd wager that the ailerons (surface of the wing which moves to control a plane's roll) lost lift first, meaning pilots no longer had control over the plane's orientation and just continued helplessly sliding sideways into the ground.  Perhaps they were showing off. Perhaps they didn't take into account their takeoff weight. Perhaps the load or fuel shifted more than should be allowed. Perhaps perhaps perhaps.

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,Vinura,2,Fri Dec 19 12:29:32 2014 UTC,There's a shit-or-get-off-the-pot threshold calculated based on weight and takeoff speed. It represents the last moment for a safe abort. If you cross that threshold then you are taking off. There's no bailing out on a takeoff without enough safe runway left unless the plane just physically won't do it and we generally just call that a crash.

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,Bill_S_Preson_Esq,8,Fri Dec 19 06:27:43 2014 UTC,an ejection crash is always a total loss. this soft belly landing allows most of the major components to be moved to other airframes even if the frame is too badly damaged to repair.

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,sirkazuo,1 point,Fri Dec 19 18:36:11 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't it have been safer for the pilot to eject immediately after the plane touched the ground in case of a fire or explosion?

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,panzerkampfwagen,2,Fri Dec 19 23:34:55 2014 UTC,"This plane has a pretty interesting ejection system.  It doesn't use an ejection seat.  Instead it uses an ejection capsule.  The capsule is much heavier and requires a larger parachute.  This parachute needs altitude to open.  Additionally, ejecting causes some spinal compression,  usually significant.  This pilot was just out of flight school.  If they eject they risk losing the pilot due to back injury and writing off the cost of his training."

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,dc469,1 point,Fri Dec 19 23:36:40 2014 UTC,"The 'certain number of ejections = automatic end of flying status' thing is a myth. It all depends on the pilot's health and the factors that led to each ejection (i.e. if the mishaps are caused by pilot error then that's more likely to end a flying career, but there isn't a magic number of ejections that leads to no longer getting to fly even if you're perfectly healthy and they were all caused by extenuating circumstances)."

PerfectTiming,2pqgbg,thatsfinktastic,1 point,Fri Dec 19 07:50:38 2014 UTC,You need to be either at a certain altitude or avoiding certain death (nose first crash) to eject. Otherwise the parachute doesn't have time to deploy and slow you so you wind up at the least with major back injuries.  A controlled belly landing is something planes are designed for so they are actually safer inside than out.

Most of the year, and especially when the water is high, it is a relatively safe Class III rapid. Falling out of a boat is pretty safe as long as you are wearing a life jacket.

PerfectTiming,2pb0wd,DeDodgingEse,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:04:18 2014 UTC,I think it's less of the power of the wave and more of the other surfer's momentum that is causing the board to hit his face.

PerfectTiming,2p7o3n,Itroll4love,5,Sun Dec 14 20:02:11 2014 UTC,"It was a joint project (JSF - Joint Strike Fighter) with various Eu and NATO allies. Most of the proprietary tech is American with partnered countries footing the bill.   However the F22 Rapotor is an air superiority interceptor and will never be shared outside of US/RAF. As it currently stands, it's like 2 generations ahead of all other air-to-air fixed wings, even the F35. We don't need alot of them because even a current gen F18 already outclasses most fighter jets. At over 2400 kph, it's the fastest production fighter jet online now, and only 2nd to the SR-71.  Edit: I actually saw one in a hanger at Lockeed-Martin's test facility in Dobbins NAB when I was a kid. I remember thinking that we found a UFO. My dad worked on the base, and a lot of planes took off there, but you knew when the F22 was taking off, it sounds like a high pitched train right in front of you."

My family was on a bicycle tour of some towns and we stopped at a park to take a break. We asked the guide if he could go off this curb and he seemed confident enough. As he went off, he did not pull up his front wheel, and subsequently went over the handle bars. My brother and I did our best to contain our laughter until we were sure he was ok. Then my mom said she got the picture. And boy was she right."

While what you suggested happened is possible and has been done, the illuminated region would not be a perfect rectangle. Rather, it would be all points for which the sum of the distances from flash to point and from point to camera were equal to or less than some value, i.e. all the points which the light had time to reach from the flash, get reflected towards your camera, and reach your camera.

PerfectTiming,2odwk6,666pool,2,Fri Dec 5 22:38:23 2014 UTC,I don't get that video.  How can the camera see light moving?  Light has to hit the camera for it to be observed so how would it be able to observe it moving at a distance?
PerfectTiming,2odwk6,blackedout,2,Sat Dec 6 07:20:49 2014 UTC,"You are correct in that the camera cannot merely ""see light moving"" as it moves through the scene--the camera can only ""see"" something as it arrives at its optics. In this case, what you're seeing are reflections from whatever the light is incident upon reaching the camera. As the laser pulse travels through the scene, portions of it are scattered in all directions, a small portion of which reach the camera. (One of the cooler parts is that some of the light which isn't initially scattered or reflected towards the camera is incident upon other objects in the scene and is then reflected towards the camera, so you can see this wave of light expand outward from wherever the initial scattering takes place.)  According to the researchers' page on MIT's website, they use a device called a ""streak camera"" to record one ""line"" (i.e. one row or column of pixels, I'm going to assume rows for this discussion) of video at a time. The entire video you see is made up of hundreds of these ""lines"" joined together with a computer.   The streak camera has a reasonable field of view in horizontal direction but very narrow (roughly equivalent to one scan line) in vertical dimension. At every recording, we can only record a '1D movie' of this narrow field of view.   This means that the video you see must be made from hundreds of images of ""the same event"" being repeated. Because of this, the use of this type of camera is currently limited to observing static or periodic events. You can't use it to record an object moving around unless the motion is repetitive and your camera is synchronized to that motion. (Kind of like the ""rolling shutter effect"" but with more science.) Fortunately, pulses of light incident on a static scene (a ""still life"") will exhibit the same large-scale behavior, so you can repeat the pulse and the result will ""look the same.""   The streak camera uses a trick to capture a one dimensional field of view at close to one trillion frames per second in a single streak image. To obtain a complete movie of the scene we stitch together many of these streak images. The resulting movie is not of one pulse, but is an average of many pulses. By carefully synchronizing the laser and camera we have to make sure each of those pulses look the same.   The FAQs explain that the ""trick"" mentioned above comes from the use of a device called a ""streak tube"" (though not ""how"" such a device actually works):   We use a special imager called a streak tube that behaves like an oscilloscope with corresponding trigger and deflection of beams. A light pulse enters the instrument through a narrow slit along one direction. It is then deflected in the perpendicular direction so that photons that arrive first hit the detector at a different position compared to photons that arrive later. The resulting image forms a ""streak"" of light.   So, they have an instrument which uses mathematical science magick to separate light out spatially based on how long it takes to reach the instrument. There's probably a bunch of weird nonlinear differential equations or other unpleasantness involved, but the process is basically ""this photon got here in two femtoseconds, so it's going in this direction, but this photon took another femtosecond to get here, so I'm going to put it over there instead."" The output from this process is (I think...) something which either resembles a 2D image, or can be made into one through mathy computer nonsense, composed of sequential views of part of the scene (that is, each row corresponds to the same row of the final video, but imaged at a different time). Once every row of the scene has been recorded, a computer can ""slice up"" each image and arrange these slices into frames of the video you saw.  Because the light gets ""spread out"" predictably, in a manner determined by the amount of time it takes to reach the instrument, the image sensor does not need to be able to differentiate between events happening femtoseconds apart. This this information is encoded spatially in the ""streak image"".  Let's say you're making three frames of video, each a two-by-two grid of pixels. We'll need to take one image for each row of the grid, and pay attention to three ""strips"" of the streak image.  Our ""streak tube"" gives us the following images (each number represents the brightness of a single pixel -- this is a black and white video):  ""STREAK IMAGE"" 1 14 25 35  ""STREAK IMAGE"" 2 87 46 30   We can now ""assemble"" the video. To make the nth frame, stick together the nth rows of each streak image:  VIDEO FRAME 1 14 87  VIDEO FRAME 2 25 46  VIDEO FRAME 3 35 30   Sorry, got carried away."

PerfectTiming,2odwk6,Hulk_Dick,1 point,Sat Dec 6 08:20:36 2014 UTC,"It's the shutter, not the sensor. This can and does happen with film cameras as well, not just digital. So it doesn't have anything to do with how a camera reads data off the electronic sensor, but rather with the mechanical motion of the shutter.  At fast shutter speeds, the finite speed of the shutter is compensated for by making the ""curtain"" narrower. So if your camera has a maximum sync speed of 1/200th of a second, but is capable of taking photos with a 1/2000th of a second exposure, what it's really doing is moving that shutter across the sensor in 1/200th of a second, but only exposing 1/10th of the sensor at any given time.  Here is a gif of what the shutter looks like, and you can imagine how the curtains can be moved closer together so that the same shutter speed leads to a shorter exposure time.  The problem is that flashes are nearly instantaneous, so you'll need to choose a shutter ""speed"" that exposes the entire sensor at the moment the flash goes off."
PerfectTiming,2odwk6,SrirachaWizard,2,Sat Dec 6 03:37:58 2014 UTC,"I'm not convinced of that. This comment purportedly illustrates the same effect, but the boundary between dark and light is blurry, whereas OP's image exhibits a pixel-perfect sharp boundary between the two regions."
PerfectTiming,2odwk6,muntoo,1 point,Sat Dec 6 05:18:02 2014 UTC,"The comment you linked shows an example of the mechanical shutter covering part of the frame while the flash went off. The line is blurry because the shutter is not in focus to the sensor.  Op's photo is likely taken with a camera that uses a digital shutter (scanning pixels across a sensor) instead of a mechanical one similar to the above gif. The Digital shutter works similar to a flatbed scanner, activating and deactivating sensor pixels from the left side to the right side.  At the point where the flash is in effect in Op's photo, The Sensor already recorded the left side of the photo, then the flash went off partway through, exposing the remaining portion of the photo.  The line in Op's photo is so sharp is because it was taken with a digital shutter that literally exposes in rows of pixels. The comment's example photo has a blurry line because it has part of a mechanical shutter moving in front of the sensor that is out of focus and is blocking the light."

This is mainly seen because most CMOS sensors can not be activated and read all at once like CCD sensors.  This flash kind of effects happens a lot more commonly in video since in video they are shooting more frames and more frames per second than a photographer usually shoots, and all but the most expensive digital cinema cameras only have electronic shutters.

PerfectTiming,2odwk6,Cheesius,2,Sat Dec 6 00:33:20 2014 UTC,"If this was taken with one of those ubiquitous digital SLR cameras, this phenomenon is likely the result of exceeding maximum flash sync shutter speed. The camera which took this picture would have been exposing above this shutter speed.  When doing so, the trailing shutter starts closing before the first shutter finishes opening leaving a stripe of image moving across the sensor.  A flash, which is relatively fast compared to this speed, will be rendered as a stripe across the image if it occurs during an exposure of this shutter speed.  It is also possible to do this with a film SLR and it's not the result the serial reading of rows across the sensor."
PerfectTiming,2odwk6,tardis777,4,Sat Dec 6 01:17:32 2014 UTC,"This is a camera processing malfunction, not your camera capturing an image at 1,000,000,000,000 FPS..."

PerfectTiming,2odwk6,demented_doctor,2,Fri Dec 5 22:01:58 2014 UTC,"The plate is white and glaring in the light, so there are probably some extra pixels being shown, a bit of flash-bloom. Also this picture was reduced and sharpened, which added a dark line at the edge of the flash which adds to that effect. It's also possible that he was moving the plate slightly, note how the ""flashed"" side of the plate and spoon are crystal clear, while the other side is a bit blurry - I imagine that's motion blur."
PerfectTiming,2odwk6,Emocmo,1 point,Sat Dec 6 00:29:51 2014 UTC,I think the spoon just doesn't fit in the dip of the plate-it's sitting with each end on the lip of the plate.

PerfectTiming,2odwk6,LordSharpe,1 point,Fri Dec 5 23:15:34 2014 UTC,"That doesn't explain anything.  For example how has the light had time to travel from the flashbulb to the window frame and into the sensor, but not from the flashbulb to the left side of the plate and into the sensor (a much shorter distance)?

Other way around, a flash happened partway through the camera reading the image sensor. While what you suggested happened is possible and has been done[1] , the illuminated region would not be a perfect rectangle. Rather, it would be all points for which the sum of the distances from flash to point and from point to camera were equal to or less than some value, i.e. all the points which the light had time to reach from the flash, get reflected towards your camera, and reach your camera. The fact that the boundary of the region of the photo with flash is a perfect vertical line implies that the flash ""went off"" in between lines being scanned from the sensor."

She is paid to follow the man around for months and photograph him at every opportunity.  Short of lining up the sun and waiting for him to do this gesticulation, what is perfectly timed or ""once in a lifetime"" about it? She probably has sat through that speech enough times to know when he does that hand movement.  If Carolyn Kaster wants to do this shot again all she needs to do is sit near his shadow at the next outdoor rally and wait for the stump speech.

He KNOWS something is there. It is because of this that he could escape.   Yhea the person could have stopped the dog before he even went to the edge. We don't know the situation really I guess.

PerfectTiming,2mgen2,rangerjello,3,Sun Nov 16 18:22:05 2014 UTC,"These mortars are considered small arns. It's all about the fact that a person of average strength can pick up the weapon and walk away with it. While the mortars above 60 are large, they can still be picked up and moved around at a moment's notice.  Edit: These mortars are manned by an entire squad. So when the combined weight of the mortar, base plate, bipod, and tool bag is 41.3 kilograms (91 lb) for the m252 81mm mortar, the weight is distributed throughout the squad.

The movie brought Adams back into the limelight and won him endorsement deals. However at this time Adams failed to pay taxes for three years and then relapsed into his drug addiction.[16] In November 2005, he was arrested and sentenced to four years, after being caught on a wiretap acting as a go-between for a buyer and seller of crystal methamphetamine.

Back then, there weren't many skateparks in the PacNW and there were countless times that there were way more bladers than skaters. Me and my friends had a problem with bladers' ""marathon"" runs on the halfpipes. The bladers' runs took forever and most of the guys only did tricks they were guaranteed to pull off because it was so hard for bladers to get to the deck on the ramp. In other words, they didn't want to fall down because they couldn't get back to the top of the ramp. Add in the fact that the skaters were outnumbered and the bladers were constantly snaking us and we could barely get a 30 second run in every 10 minutes. I definitely didn't like riding the same ramp as bladers back then.  Nowadays, bladers are few and far between, so it's actually kind of fun to ride with/see somebody who's good."

This was like 15 years ago as well.  I mean, I know they are lame, but it was just something else to do in a boring town.    Never cruised around on them as we would be entirely too embarrassed to do it and skateboarding was more fun for that.  I think we brought one to the skatepark once to just be idiots.  We were pretty much mocking the scooters themselves, but it ended up being fun to progress at something other than skateboarding for a while."

Donovan McNabb broke his leg during a playoff game and played through it.  Jake Youngblood also broke his leg in the playoffs and played on it for multiple games afterwards.  Rashad Johnson had his finger ripped off from the second knuckle and played through it. When he took his glove off, the piece of finger remained in it.

PerfectTiming,2lvpmc,kvoges,43,Tue Nov 11 15:16:36 2014 UTC,"And for a rookie,  he's playing damn pretty solid in Minnesota. I understand the vikings have been comical for the past few years with Ponder but this team has gone through LOTS of distractions this year. Their rookies are showing up this year, Bridgewater,  McKinnon,  and Barr have been fantastic. Their defense is one of the best ranked in the league. And this was all achieved with the distractions of Adrian Peterson and with key injuries to their starting QB,  starting tight end,  and of course their best player not playing for 8 games.   If I had told you all of the above and then asked what do you think their record is,  most would say ""1-8 maybe 2-7 or 3-6 at best"" but they're not,  they are 4-5 and they're playing the Bears next,  could easily be 5-5. Their opening first few games they had to deal with Stafford,  Ryan,  Brees,  Brady,  and Rodgers.  I think the vikings are going to be a top NFC contender in the coming years."

Usually it is for comfort (helmets hurt), out of habit (someone like Aaron Rodgers who still wears the old school cloth chin strap), or to look cool.   They have to call out the play, and you can't do that when your teeth are fastened together.   Your teeth are not fastened together.  That would never work, as you wouldn't be able to breathe or talk at all.  Every player on the field is shouting at some point and breathing through their mouth, even with tight chin straps."

If that really was the issue then helmet manufacturers would have come up with an alternative fastening method. If you literally can't open your mouth to speak then your helmet doesn't fit properly.

The exposure time on the camera would have to be unbelievably fast. like one billionth to a trillionth of a second fast and not even 10 thousand dollar cameras have a shutter speed that fast. My best bet is that this image was caused by something having to do with how digital cameras form images. They form the image line by line from one side to the other. what probably happened here is that as the picture was taken, part way through creating the image, another cameras flash went off.   you can see another image affected by this here: http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2010/08/eyes.jpg  on the left the kid is blinking but on the right his reflection shows his eyes open."

So for the lazy,  Squid  A young motorcyclist who overestimates his abilities, boasts of his riding skills when in reality he has none. Squid bikes are usually decorated with chrome and various anodized bits. Rear tyres are too wide for their own good, swingarm extended. Really slow in the corners, and sudden bursts of acceleration when a straight appears. Squids wear no protection, deeming themselves invincible. This fact compounds intself with the fact that they engage in 'extreem riding'--performing wheelies and stoppies in public areas. Squids wreck alot. Derived from 'squirly kid'"

Squid bikes are usually decorated with chrome and various anodized bits. Rear tyres are too wide for their own good, swingarm extended. Really slow in the corners, and sudden bursts of acceleration when a straight appears. Squids wear no protection, deeming themselves invincible. This fact compounds intself with the fact that they engage in 'extreem riding'--performing wheelies and stoppies in public areas. Squids wreck alot.

PerfectTiming,2li71j,SpringbobSquirepants,28,Fri Nov 7 07:12:29 2014 UTC,"Fun little anecdote: apparently the pylons are much heavier than they look. Offensive lineman for the Raiders wrote an article for NFL UK that was pretty funny about it.  http://www.nfluk.com/news/article-1/Menelik-Watson-writes-for-NFLUKcom/3d1785ac-0687-48a1-82a8-41c29b778739?campaign=social_20140909_31270046   I was coming from all the way across the field which made catching him virtually impossible.  So as my angle proved to be insufficient I opted on making one of the worst decisions I have made as a pro, and kicked the pylon.  At first glance the pylon is as unassuming as it gets. It’s a little orange object at the edge of Endzone that looks like an enlarged glowstick. Nobody told me how heavy this unassuming object was.  When I kicked it, it threw off my entire balance and what ensued was an epic wipeout.  I stayed down… I wasn’t even hurt, I just felt it was necessary to take the time and reflect on why mum always told me never to make assumptions."

PerfectTiming,2lfeqa,Gurunexx,4,Thu Nov 6 20:23:54 2014 UTC,"Not much to it really. I was smashing away at a large wooden post in the ground trying to get it loose to remove at work. A good mate of mine who worked with me at the time asked if he could have a swing, I said no worries. I took a couple of steps back and starting chatting away with another mate.  He took a big swing, missed completely and it swung round and caught me on the forehead above the eye. Concussion and 12 stitches, had to drive myself to hospital bleeding all over myself as neither of my mates had their licence at the time. Probably wasnt wise, but still.  Hurt like hell, kind of lucky he used the blunt side of the tool as the sledgey we were using was what was called a splitting maul. If he been using the other side he probably would have killed me. Or if I was standing a bit closer it would have been a more direct blow. Was lucky. Protip - dont stand behind people swinging shit lol  edit - tool was very similar to this"

If he puts his hands down hard he'll have some leverage to roll off the fire quickly, which he is inevitably going to fall on.  Second: He looks like he has ingested too much alcohol to perform this maneuver effectively. Actually, that's likely what has led him to this unfortunate impasse. Let's dwell on that for a moment.  As a fellow drunk-asshole. I really feel for this dude. He's just trying to have a drunken laugh, riding around on his bike in a two sizes too small Robin costume on Halloween, and he makes one miscalculation. One miscalculation that is surely going to haunt him for a while. Even if he doesn't do this often, it's the sort of mistake he'll be judged on for years to come.  Next Halloween, people will discuss whether or not to invite him. Someone will inevitably mention that he fell off of a bike...and onto a camp fire last year. A shocking tale of a debauched man, out of control, even if that's not entirely or absolutely true, yet ONTO A FIRE they'll say....true enough.  And then, if Robin does get invited, he'll have to reassure his girlfriend that he's not going to get too drunk, like last year, when he accidentally rode that bike into the fire. Everyone will remember him as that asshole that fell off of a bike and onto a fire last year.  I swear to god, we're all one drunken midnight bicycle pleasure cruise  away from being labelled!

Look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go. You can see him looking at the car while turning and he just beelines for it.  Also, most bikes can lean/turn much harder than you think! On that kind of bike you'll start to scrape your foot pegs when you start to lean too much. It's scary as hell the first time you do it, but it won't harm you or the bike."
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,nitid_name,13,Mon Nov 3 21:04:45 2014 UTC,"On that bike, I think he might spark the pipes on the right side before he can get the floorboards pegs (who rides forward controls with pegs? That's like getting a pleather finish on your Lazyboy).  The worst part is that he isn't even leaning by the time he hits starts heading for the Corvette. He stands the bike up straight partway through the turn and then BAM, right into that poor guy's car."
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,daxpr,7,Mon Nov 3 21:24:32 2014 UTC,"You might be right about those pipes, I didn't notice that.

PerfectTiming,2l6qls,nitid_name,2,Mon Nov 3 22:28:36 2014 UTC,"The further you shift your center of gravity horizontally away and vertically toward your two contact patches, the tighter you will turn. Your effective lean angle is the angle between your center of gravity (including the bike), the closest point to your CoG on the line between your front and rear contact patch and a line perpendicular to the riding surface. Your turning radius should be the cosine of that angle times your ""trike steering"" turning radius.  Your bike lean angle will end up being less than your actual lean angle, since your wheels are rounded (thus shifting your contact patch toward the side you're turning on), unless you put your body into the turn.

PerfectTiming,2l6qls,daxpr,3,Tue Nov 4 02:06:38 2014 UTC,"It's all about controlling the clutch (don't do that in a car! a car's clutch is different) Basically, you need to use a little throttle and keep it even, and then let the clutch lever out to speed up. Want to go faster, let the clutch out more, and if you want to go slower just grab it back. It sounds simple, but it's a little weird compared to how you'd normally ride, and very different from driving a manual car. It takes practice to get used to it. If you're doing really tight or really slow turns you can counter lean (bike is turning/leaning right, you lean to the left, standing up) or drag the rear brake (just a little, too much and you'll just stop which might make you drop the bike if you aren't expecting it). You probably won't have to do that, though.  I'd recommend just practicing it in an empty parking lot, and if you get stuck somewhere and need to turn slowly you can just push the bike if you aren't confident. It all comes with practice, and every bike I've been on rides pretty differently. And it never hurts to do some practice on your bike, better to drop it doing some practice in an empty parking lot than to try something you aren't ready!"
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,TJ_McHoonigan,1 point,Tue Nov 4 02:53:36 2014 UTC,"Ah, thanks! I'll give those a shot. I'm comfortable turning at speed, but any time I have to make a tight, slow turn, like at four way stops, I feel like an invalid because I go through it so awkwardly."
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,daxpr,2,Tue Nov 4 03:10:30 2014 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with being a little awkward about it, more than likely no one will notice as long as you don't completely stall.

What? On a big bike, shifting your weight is going to do very little to change your course, especially at the speeds this guy is going. Countersteering man, that's where it's at. Maybe you feel like you're shifting the bike by dropping your shoulder, but what you don't realize your doing is Countersteering. Once you've realized consciously what you're doing, you can be more effective at it.  If you're countersteering, your body weight will be doing almost zero of the turning. The bike will be doing most of it thanks to the physics of countersteering."
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,nitid_name,2,Tue Nov 4 04:03:12 2014 UTC,"I counter steer my bike into a 30 degree bike lean. That's as much as my bike turns without scraping pipes (right) or pegs (left). That allows me to take an exit ramp at my work at ~44mph.  I drop my shoulder, suddenly I can turn at another few mph higher.  If I shift my left cheek off the seat and my right one to the edge of it, stand up a bit on the inside peg, and push my knee toward the inside of the curve, I can take the same exit ramp at 58mph. I can take that turn in the mid 40s with the bike nearly straight up if I throw my weight out.  On a sport bike, I'd just counter steer a little harder to turn harder. You don't have to start throwing knees, elbows, and shoulders to the asphalt until your bike lean angle is at 55-65 degrees (or slightly higher on some of the track bikes, but I don't know the numbers offhand). On a cruiser, you only get 22-30 degrees of bike lean before you have to use your bodyweight to get the rest of it.  My bike is a HD 2014 FXDB. It weighs 690lb wet. It's rated for 29.5 degrees bike lean to the right, 30 to the left. You can eek out another degree or three if you oil your pegs on the left side and don't mind scraping them up. I'll get a bit more out of the right when I change my exhaust to something a bit higher than my low pipes. I'm 240lb.  Maybe on a 1000lb FL cruiser your weight isn't super important compared to the lean of the bike, but on my Dyna, it definitely matters."

I thought you were talking about chanting your course by leaning, which isn't really a viable option. I've taken my hands off the bars of my SV650s (317lbs, I weigh 140) and leaned as hard as possible to one side, I barely have enough control to keep it on the road.   But shifting body weight to maintain a particular lean angle is very possible. Carry on!"
PerfectTiming,2l6qls,nitid_name,1 point,Tue Nov 4 18:16:35 2014 UTC,"Cruisers are weird. They are fun, often obnoxiously loud, a bit old-man-ish, and great for long trips, but they are nowhere near as nimble as other bikes. Their handling, particularly with passenger/loaded bags is on par with a car at best. That exit I was telling you about? My FWD econobox Nissan Cube can take it at a shade under 50mph (although it kind of skittered in the back end a bit, definitely not trying to go quite that fast on that turn in that car ever again).  I'm definitely going to get something that can handle a bit better for my next bike.

I was watching her the whole time, instead of looking where I was going. I could have saved it, if I didn't let fear kick in. Instead, I stood the bike up and was hard on the brakes, when more lean would have saved my ass. According to my friends, I spun through the air horizontally like a propeller.

PerfectTiming,2l6qls,nitid_name,49,Mon Nov 3 23:49:05 2014 UTC,"I think it was a matter of overdriving his skill level, not so much the road.  People go out and by a fast car and have this misconception that they will automatically know how to drive it.  This is why the older guys with Miatas make the younger rich guys in Ferraris look stupid on the track.  No one should be driving that fast on that road without extensive controlled-environment training, such as a track with plenty of run-off space when they eventually biff it."

Like clockwork, some new Billy Badass would show up in his shiny new 'Stang and think he's gonna show everyone up.  After about 3 slides offs and having to re-align the cones, Billy Badass would always huff and puff and storm out of there.  Then, one of the veterans walking around in jean shorts, socks, and sandals would suit up and rip off a lap about 25% faster than Billy B's fastest time in his 95 Miata.    Shit would always crack me up.  Power doesn't always equate to faster times, not every track has a bunch of mile long straightaways to goose it down."

PerfectTiming,2l6qls,binlagin,2,Tue Nov 4 03:04:33 2014 UTC,"None of you were there, for any of these crashes.  Imagine you'd been driving for hours, through the mountains and onto the Blue Ridge, then on to the Tail of the Dragon.  The tires were a bit too worn for full-on racing, you knew, but they were warmed up and gripping very well, with still very predictable drift at - and past - the limit.  After hundreds of curves that day you then make a very quick and hard pass along the Tail, then you get to the end and take a break at the Scenic Overlook.  Before dark, you go back the other way at a much slower pace, but the tires are now as cold as the air has become, and due to their earlier pounding, they offer far less grip than you need.  The first few corners were not taken fast enough to notice, and the corner pictured was not particularly difficult, nor were you driving too fast for it, at least in relation to the other fast drivers, at around 40.  The rear tires simply let go, without drifting, and without any warning, a feeling unlike anything you'd ever felt in that car, which always handled stunningly well.  The traction control was turned off, of course, and your opposite lock steering correction was too conservative, as you think about avoiding the other side of the road and thus going downhill after a whipsaw.  Putting on more gas was not wise.  After the slippery drift had started and widened so quickly, your ABS brakes were not enough to simply stop, nor were they actually contributing to the slide.  You let up on them, although the brake lights may still be on, and in the same split-second that all of this was happening, and despite the counter-steer, your front wheel seems to instantly hit into the muddy ditch, stopping the car and bouncing it back up, appearing from behind as if it were flying, but it wasn't moving forward very much.  You then fall flat on all four tires as if aimed, only a few feet further into the muddy ditch, feeling lucky - while you didn't opposite lock enough to avoid the ditch, you avoided far worse outcomes.  No one gets every corner right 100% of the time.  In the end, the damage was superficial, easily fixed, and nobody was hurt.  You know one split-second handling attempt to recover bad tires does not make you as a driver, nor does minor damage to a well-insured car break you.  You don't care what some two-faced mouthy photographer thinks, because kids like that are not living authentically, anyway.  Akin to vultures, such parasites make money by encouraging people who weren't there to laugh at someone's misfortune, and even after they pretend to be your friend.  You also find ignorant comments by armchair drivers amusing.  The point you know is this: You drive the mountain because you respect the mountain.  You'll drive it again and again in the months and years after in the same car and others because you know how to be as indifferent about the mountain as the mountain is about you."

PerfectTiming,2ksxhy,ImaginaryDuck,9,Thu Oct 30 20:29:02 2014 UTC,A lot of raft guides use a wave like this one to help them make the jump. You have to time it right and it works best if the raft is a little under inflated. I've guided on the New River in WV and the last rapid there is perfect for this. I would deflate my boat a little bit before it just to get more pop out of the waves.

PerfectTiming,2ksxhy,swcarter,18,Fri Oct 31 03:28:06 2014 UTC,I believe it's a common thing Whitewater rafting instructors do for a bit of fun. They know when the back of the raft is going to bump them upwards so they jump at the same time to get extra height. Bit like a double bouncey on a trampoline you jump way higher. I've seen it done at my local artificial ww rafting centre.

Cats are the worst invasive species, in the world,  besides humans.   Cats are indiscriminate killers, that hunt for fun, not just food.  Most outdoor cats will kill anything that is smaller than them.  This means birds, rodents, lizards, raccoon, possum, anything that is smaller than the cat, or even about the same size,  the cat will try and kill.   Cats can also reproduce by about 6 months of age, and can be pregnant again, within weeks of giving birth.  Which is why all the anti-Peta shit you hear is just propaganda.  For all the animals ""peta kill""  the stray animal population isn't going down any.  The reason they kill so many animals, is because of idiots that get 20+ cats, and then get them taken away.   I just recently rescued yet another stray in my area,  which was already pregnant,  had her fixed, and now have to deal with the 3 kittens left, that no one wants."

PerfectTiming,2kbr4x,nukefudge,10,Sun Oct 26 14:53:33 2014 UTC,"just because i feel like it, this one is gonna get an open analysis, because it's somewhere on the spectrum of a slippery slope i feel is important to address (i won't be wearing my mod hat for the exchange, since i'm primarily speaking as a generic chatty person).  so, we've had stuff lining up with a rainbow before. fair enough, it must be kinda hard to catch something like that. not much to the image apart from that, though.  we've also had stuff lining up with even trickier elements to it. same as before, but something needing more precision and timing to get a picture off. seems like a step up, but at this point we should be wondering if we were venturing into ""things lining up"" territory.  but then there's the adding of an additional element of surprise. that's gotta be rare! definitely more spectacular than the rest.  and then there's that case where something was indeed rather easy to set up but something special happened on top of it.  now... as for this post, the OP... it's a boat in a rather blurry rainbow. is that enough?... seems like there must've been plenty of opportunity to ""nail"" this picture. it's certainly not as precise as the first of the plane photos, and there's certainly no additional element as in the ones where lightning popped in. so what do we say?...  in the end, i think it should stay, if only to serve as a reminder of what the absolute end of the spectrum is, and as something occasioning reflection due to its borderline nature.  for anyone interested in discussing the evaluations that are employed in here, stop by the thread on the newly proposed rules!  /nukefudge, possibly recognizable as part of the friendly neighbourhood mod team"
PerfectTiming,2kbr4x,Ekanselttar,7,Sun Oct 26 18:04:34 2014 UTC,"seems like there must've been plenty of opportunity to ""nail"" this picture.   This is where I, as a fairly casual reader/observer of this sub, stepped into the comments section. For full context, I mostly just see the stuff that comes up on my frontpage, though I occasionally browse through the sub itself. I don't often jump into the comments, though, unless there's something especially interesting about the photo, and I don't recall the last time I commented myself.  But, well, the sub is called perfect timing. This is a case of a foreground object lining up with a background object. A mobile foreground object at that. Rainbows are a bit ephemeral, sure but a picture of a rainbow itself isn't perfect timing, and they can stick around for a good while when they do appear. The purpose of the sub, to me, is for shots where you can ask yourself, ""If I were in the photographer's situation, would I have gotten a similar picture?"" and the answer is ""Probably not.""  I couldn't just walk outside and take this picture, but given the chance - and neither boats nor rainbows are particularly rare - I reliably could. The alignment of a stationary background object, a foreground object moving quickly enough to change position without zipping right by, and a photography platform mobile enough to take advantage of parallax does not make me think perfect timing at all."
PerfectTiming,2kbr4x,nukefudge,3,Sun Oct 26 00:06:53 2014 UTC,"exactly. it's on the edge. but the context, as displayed above, is still there - can't run away from the history. i could've taken it down, but i decided to let it stay so we could have conversations like this.  and then maybe someone learns something, and maybe they remember it for next time, and maybe the quality of the sub is improved.  additionally, we sift through so much bad stuff on a daily basis (typically), that we might end up being happy to let something stay because it's similar to other existing material. or, we just get jaded, and throw most dodgy things out.  of course, i like chatting, so this is preferable to me over those other alternatives in that regard too."
PerfectTiming,2kbr4x,Aellus,2,Sun Oct 26 02:33:31 2014 UTC,"Exactly, the point of this sub is to celebrate those shots that the photographer didn't even realize they were capturing when they click the shutter. If you have enough time to spot the shot and take the picture, I don't think it counts as perfect timing. You need to be taking an unrelated picture when something unexpected happens in that instant, and then is gone.  OP was clearly watching this rainbow waiting for the boat to line up. This post doesn't belong here."

Few years back my friends and I ended up at Chuck E Cheese for our friends little sisters bday (she was basically our little sister too). We got a bunch of tickets and got a ton of foam rocket launcher things. Fast forward two hours and we're sitting at a table eating pizza and one of my friends is trying to take a picture and another (the fuckboy of the group) is trying to convince me to let him try and shoot the rocket into my mouth. I told him, ""Fuck no, you're going to hit me in the eye."" Multiple times. We take the picture. I made a stupid face that included my mouth being open. He went for it. Somewhere there is a spectacular picture of us, a foam rocket just visible in the corner of the picture before it hit me directly in the eye. I'm gonna need to try and dig it up for this sub."

PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,Mystharia,6,Fri Oct 17 16:56:27 2014 UTC,7 I enjoy seeing things aligned in a unique way as long as it appears unplanned.  9 I see nothing wrong even with planned water shots. They're still timed perfectly.
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,nukefudge,11,Fri Oct 17 18:28:35 2014 UTC,"7: that's what you go to those other subs for ;)  9: planned = staged. also, camera autofire is a thing.  you see, the more we allow for that kind material to flurish in here, the less we'll see of the truly unexpected. and then, the sub might as well just be a repost dump from those other places.  it's much cooler to be a niche, and a big one even.  EDIT: i'm commenting without my mod hat on because i think it's a discussion i'd like to have at a user level... or something like that."
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,aschult5,5,Fri Oct 17 19:10:03 2014 UTC,"I agree with Mystharia on #7. While there are subreddits dedicated to perspective illusions, they are not necessarily perfectly-timed ones. I think as long as we (you) filter out the stuff that is obviously staged, it should stay.  P.S. thanks for polling the community!"
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,korkow,5,Fri Oct 17 22:31:30 2014 UTC,"There seem to be other people like you who prefer less content segregation versus more - So we'll definitely keep an eye on how much feedback we get on that.  The rules have a common thread of supporting the sub's spirit of ""once in a lifetime"" shots.  We also like to curate unique & unexpected content, and to help do that sometimes we direct some types of content to other relevant subs.  Our rules tend to lean toward quality over quantity, so we certainly welcome feedback on that and what kind of content people want & expect from the sub.  With #7, when things are aligned well they usually raise the question of whether they are in the ""once in a lifetime"" spirit, or whether the photographer's position or circumstances are staged.  Examples: Put a dog in front of the leaning tower and have the dog stand up/lean back (stageable, not really once in a lifetime) and put a dude next to a falcon (staged).  As for #9, we welcome unexpected shots of stuff that happens to be ""on water"", so do you think we should make an exception for planned/staged shots that appear ""on-water""?"
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,dallashigh,3,Fri Oct 17 19:25:11 2014 UTC,"I agree that #7 is a little harsh. I think as long as it's completely unintentional, and would have not been possible a split second sooner or later, it should be allowed."
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,nukefudge,3,Sat Oct 18 00:12:51 2014 UTC,I agree with all of these rules. I've seen too many posts lately that don't fit the original intent of this sub.

Would this be allowed content?"
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,nukefudge,6,Fri Oct 17 18:15:59 2014 UTC,"I believe that is usually called the rolling shutter effect.  Yes, our existing & new rules as written allow this effect because it could be considered the unexpected element of perfect timing.  Would such an effect always be considered ""once in a lifetime"" in the spirit of the sub?  That's up for discussion.  The only rolling shutter picture I am aware of that has been removed was a fairly low quality picture where some people couldn't tell what was being photographed.  A little background on the update to #2: It was broadened to prohibit lightning because it has been difficult for at least some of us mod to determine the exposure length for the vast majority of lightning pictures, and there is a dedicated sub for lightning.  EDIT: Verbiage"
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,CB_the_cuttlefish,2,Fri Oct 17 18:39:34 2014 UTC,"I like these rules as written, and agree that the sub should be reserved for the 'once in a lifetime' type shots.

PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,iagox86,4,Sun Oct 26 00:44:04 2014 UTC,"I use Reddit because it's a media aggregation site, so it disheartens me to see each subreddit leaning more towards segregation. I don't have enough hours in my day to search for the niche subreddits for the content I like to see and upvote, so subs like this one that have good content, often from other subs, but that aren't inundated with posts are my lifeblood.   No gore, porn, memes, or photoshop are helpful to this sub, but most of the remaining things are what I want from this subreddit. That being said, the most upvoted item on this subreddits front page, the Hillary Clinton and fan picture is no more perfect timing than every photo from every convention meet and greet."
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,Jakeable,7,Fri Oct 17 18:14:48 2014 UTC,"You're not the only one with a willingness to essentially loosen some rules to see more content here, and that's an interesting point about aggregation & segregation - So thanks for chiming in.  The rules have a common thread of supporting the sub's spirit of ""once in a lifetime"" shots and we also like to curate unique & unexpected content.  Sometimes we try to support these by directing some content to other subs.  As for the Hillary pic, I agree with this assessment here that the unexpectedness of multiple facial expressions contributed to it belonging here.  Is there a rule you might propose to filter out this type of content, or do you believe that the picture just doesn't fit the spirit of the sub?  Do you believe this famous picture would belong in this sub?"
PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,nukefudge,5,Fri Oct 17 19:40:58 2014 UTC,"Reddit allows you to create your own multi reddits out of smaller ones, so your argument doesn't make sense. Having subreddits be more segregated allows people to tailor reddit more to their specific tastes.  Like illusions and lightening but not gore, you can make a multireddit for that. If those were all allowed on one subreddit, you couldn't get rid of the ones you don't like  Use reddit properly instead of forcing others to your personal tastes"

PerfectTiming,2jj2zk,nukefudge,2,Sat Oct 18 03:15:28 2014 UTC,"i think the point is that some pics fall out of collective consciousness, and instead of just linking to old threads - where votes and comments are no longer viable, due to archiving - sometimes, it's not bad to get the pieces to resurface.  we are of course aware that this sort of thing can be ""gamed"" by eager posters, but still, in the interest of reminding visitors of what there is to see, i think it's the best of the alternatives."

PerfectTiming,2jath3,iEATu23,3,Thu Oct 16 02:38:55 2014 UTC,"Watch the documentary called Waco: Rules of Engagement. Mr. Clinton and Janet Reno conspire to mass murder 100 men, women, and children over guns, so as to make a statement that no citizens are beyond the militant grasp of the government. Ultimately they chose to use a chemical attack to ensure people burned alive. Those that tried to escape were murdered, frequently shot in the back while unarmed. The only ones who lived were the ones who escaped the death squad, through flames, into direct sight of media.  President Clinton, Janet Reno, mass murderers of American men, women, and children. I somehow doubt Mrs. Clinton was upset to learn her husband is a mass murderer.  Edit: For those down voting, my statements are supported by congressional testimony and video evidence showing the death squad executing people. The congressional record also proves the ATF, FBI, Janet Reno, and Clinton all lied in their testimony and/or statements. The FBI's own video also shows them starting the fires which they will later lie, stating they were started within. The chemical attack is also part of the official record and have never been refuted; nor even an attempt to do so. According to Janet Reno, she and Bill were fully engaged in the entire plan from the very start.  If you doubt me, watch the documentary."

Now, we assume unplanned bird takeoff shot is about once in a half lifetime (1/(1/2) = 2/1) and bird on foot is probably about  the same (1/(1/2) = 2/1).  Having a girlfriend for long enough to take a picture is once in four lifetimes (1/4).  Through the multiplication principle in combinatorics, we have 2/1 * 2/1 * 1/4 = 1/1.

PerfectTiming,2irkpz,ephebic,12,Fri Oct 10 04:29:48 2014 UTC,"At transonic speeds, there are bits of flow on the airplane that break the sound barrier. This creates a shock wave that moves out from wherever the sound barrier was broken. These shock waves move away at the speed of sound. As the plane moves forward, so does the source of the shock wave. Imagine a circle of radius 1*speed of sound at 1 second behind the plane, another one with a radius of 0.5 at 0.5 seconds behind the plane, another one 0.25 at 0.25 seconds behind the plane, and so on. If connect the leading edge of the normal shock (the part that moves perpendicular to the direction of the plane's motion), you'll see the cone shape.  The pressure and temperature changes across this boundary, which allows you to see water vapor in the ambient air if conditions are right."

PerfectTiming,2iogf6,Killobyte,9,Wed Oct 8 17:55:27 2014 UTC,I'm not sure it would be possible as it was set up at 60. You would need to throw in the direction the car is travailing.
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,Apolik,3,Thu Oct 9 00:17:45 2014 UTC,If it was thrown fast enough its possible
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,reddells,65,Thu Oct 9 00:23:01 2014 UTC,"Let's do the math!  Assume the pitcher has roughly an 18 inch window through which to fit the ball (and I think that's a little generous). And assume the width of the car is 67 inches (width of a BMW 5 series from here). In order to succeed, the baseball has to cover those 67 inches before the car covers those 18 inches.  Width of car = 67 inches  Width of safe window = 18 inches  60 mph = 1056 inches per second  18 inches would be covered by the car in 18/1056 = 0.017 seconds  Now, how fast would the baseball need to move to cover 67 inches in 0.017 seconds?  distance = velocity * time  67 (inches) = ? (inches/second) * 0.017 (seconds)  ? = 67 / 0.017 = 3941 inches / second = 224 mph  So yes, if it was thrown fast enough it is possible, but you would need to throw it more than twice as fast as the fastest pitch ever recorded in a major league game."
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,jianadaren1,14,Thu Oct 9 00:43:17 2014 UTC,Oh thank god I was gunna do it but was way too lazy. Thank you  Edit: I would allow closer to 2 feet for the window opening. Of course thats best case scenario. With those parameters im getting 167mph. Still wicked fast
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,reddells,3,Thu Oct 9 00:45:41 2014 UTC,"But that means a reasonable car speed would be 15mph.  That'd require a 56mph pitch, which is in the average range a 18yo could do with a knuckleball."
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,jianadaren1,3,Thu Oct 9 05:36:30 2014 UTC,But this is also assuming the pitch is thrown perfectly. By this I mean the ball will nearly come into contact with the front of the drivers window and the rear of the passenger window. I would assume this guy is capable of throwing faster than that so there would be a larger margin for error.
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,aznpkmn,3,Thu Oct 9 08:36:11 2014 UTC,If he throws a slider or cutter he'll expand the window further by curving the ball with the car's movement.
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,Butthead8,1 point,Thu Oct 9 13:40:53 2014 UTC,You're right. I didn't think about that. It would also increase his window if he throws at an angle towards the direction of the car's travel
PerfectTiming,2iogf6,BeejRich,3,Thu Oct 9 15:34:29 2014 UTC,Would the pitch not move somewhat with the car - during the period it's in the cabin wouldn't the ball be experiencing ~60mph winds in the direction of car travel.

Considering he's not even halfway to the next building/wall, he is going to end up either having a bad time with a cat leap, he's going to fall on his ass, or he's going to be horribly injured by smashing face first into the wall, along with his knees possibly being shattered.

My hand came off the handle bar and my arm contacted the handlebar breaking both of the bones cleanly (no shards) in half, as I went down, my hand hit the ground and the momentum of me falling forced the broken bones, that were still attached to my elbow joint, almost all the way through the skin, I don't remember but my friend that I was with said there was about a quarter inch of my bone sticking out. when I came to, my hand was basically ""cupping"" my elbow. I rolled over and then the shock of the injury hit, we were messing around about half a mile up one of the many canyon hiking trails in the hollywood hills, I remember trying to hold my arm straight out my arm as I walked, and I was shocked that I could still move my hand, albeit not very well, even though nothing was ""connected"". my friend had already called 911. The paramedics were there in about 10 minutes. They put my arm in a cardboard splint as well as a bandage over the wound that the bone had left. Because the bone barely breached the skin, there was maybe a half inch wound on the top of my arm. it looked awful, but after it was cleaned up, it really didn't look bad. They used medical grade super glue to close the wound, which now is almost invisible under my tattoos. Once that was taken care of, the doctor set my arm in a shoulder to hand cast with a little window above the wound to keep it clean - a few months later I was right as rain. The only thing that I struggle with these days are aches when it gets moist out, as well as a bit less rotation than my left hand."

PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,wbgraphic,25,Wed Oct 1 21:09:23 2014 UTC,Holy shit. I never realized how scary that position is. How do they know where the other plane is to avoid bumping into it?
PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,BassheadPanda,31,Wed Oct 1 21:15:56 2014 UTC,"HIGHLY trained, flying precise aircraft with HIGHLY precise instrumentation. You're right in freaking out about this, as this would be the number one situation to avoid in normal formation flight (loss of sight of the lead aircraft is extremely dangerous, as you may have seen in the recent sky diving accident). Basically, I figure anyway, The bottom guy is flying at 50 feet on his altimeter, and the guy above him at 60 feet. It's really the only way I can see this happening, as they do not have glass bottoms on F-16s."
PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,prometheus5500,11,Wed Oct 1 21:26:03 2014 UTC,The question I always had is: when they fly in formation and are few feet apart from each other can a turbulence or a bird screw everything up?
PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,valgar7,28,Wed Oct 1 22:05:54 2014 UTC,"Turbulence would act on all of the planes in the same way. They would all buffet up and then down, say, 1 foot. The lead plane would do so SLIGHTLY before the plane behind him, but it would be so close that they basically hit the same turbulence at the same time. Like two boats driving next to each other in decent sized seas. They ride up the waves together, and back down the back side together. If the seas were super choppy, they would then NOT be hitting the same waves at (nearly) the same times, but instead would be buffeted about in a way that would necessitate more separation (increased safety margin).     If turbulence was bad enough on a day, they simply wouldn't fly. In most cases though, if the weather is good enough for a performance (no convective activity, not too many clouds, ect), then the turbulence is not likely to be an issue. I do not recommend flying close formation through a thunderstorm. Hahaha.    As for the bird. Yeah, if they suffered a bird strike, they would call it off immediately to asses the damages. It's unlikely that a strike would cause some chaotic movement though, so I doubt they would hit each other, as these are highly trained pilots who have their exit strategy very well planned. It would take a bird going through someones canopy to cause a midair, I'm thinking, as even a large bird through an engine or hitting a control surface wouldn't really cause any sudden flight characteristic changes that would result in a collision with the other aircraft in formation before a ""knock it off"" call could be made.    Granted, I'm a low-hour pilot with zero formation flying experience and zero jet time, so my window of knowledge is a bit limited."

PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,IVEMIND,2,Thu Oct 2 00:35:05 2014 UTC,"I doubt the altimeter would be used, more than likely the aircraft has lidar/radar sensors mounted specifically for this purpose, as that would give relative distance which is much more useful than an absolute difference. For example, if the wind changed and both planes were supposed to be flying at 1000 metres, and it gusted both jets up ten meters, it's not a big deal because they are maintaining 10 metres of separation. If it was based on altitude, the top pilot could correct earlier than the lower pilot causing a crash.   Furthermore, usually in formations, there is one plane/ship that is designated as the guide, and other planes are responsible for maintaining their position relative to the guide.. This avoids a double correction.   Source: formal naval navigation officer."
PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,Lovv,1 point,Wed Oct 1 22:30:11 2014 UTC,"Perhaps the inverted guy has a radar on the top (height AGL, and ""lead"" airplane), and the other has a radar on the bottom for height above the other aircraft (he would be the chase plane).    I was considering this possibility, but figured it was a bit far-fetched, but I really guess it isn't. They would just need some custom avionics/sensors, which would not be a stretch for a military demonstration team.    Great point about the double correction."
PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,prometheus5500,2,Wed Oct 1 22:37:16 2014 UTC,"Actually yes you are correct. The guide doesn't care what everyone else is doing. The guide is mainly concerned about where the formation is relative to the ground. I would imagine that number 5 here is the guide as his title is lead solo. And relative velocity is a huge part of military flying and an even bigger part of marine navigation. Rocks stay still, water moves relative to rocks, ships move on top of the water moving relative to rocks, winds push the ships at different strengths depending on size of the ship.. on top of the water that is moving relative to the moving rock.  Now add in 3 dimensions for a submarine!  It gets very difficult very quickly! Which is why I am a former and not current naval officer.   While many of these problems are removed today in the modern world when you factor in GPS, GPS won't likely be available in a large scale war.   Anyhoo I got a little off topic but I hope it's a good thought provoking read."

Now with space age tech, I'd think we have something similar. Whoever controls space, controls the war.... to some extent. GPS is just too damn useful for the military to abandon at any point, especially in a time of war."

PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,Lovv,1 point,Thu Oct 2 04:33:45 2014 UTC,"The F-16 has a radar altimeter but it doesn't work while inverted. Some ATFI (Advanced Fighter Technology Integration) F-16 platforms were outfitted with radar altimeter systems that could work at any pitch or bank angle, but for some reason that particular technology was never adapted to standard F-16s. I suppose it's possible that the Thunderbird F-16s have some modifications that can do that, but more than likely they use a pre-briefed MSL altitude (if they had radar altimeters that worked at all aspects, the infamous 2003 crash caused by an incorrect altimeter barometric pressure setting probably wouldn't have happened). The F-16's fly-by-wire system continuously trims the aircraft so that it would fly at 1G with no pitch input, so that probably helps a lot to be able to fly with perfect precision even when inverted. I'm sure having a HUD with a flight path marker also helps to maintain situational awareness while still making sure vertical speed is 0."

PerfectTiming,2hzxg8,Anticept,5,Wed Oct 1 21:44:36 2014 UTC,"That, and fighter jets have next to no camber, because they use angle of attack instead due to the speed that they fly.

Compared with previous executives Lincoln appropriated a lot of power.    I don't think it would be that out of line to call him a ""tyrant"" a la Julius Caesar.  This doesn't mean his reign was bad for the country; it only means that someone with a blacker heart could have abused that position.  Or Lincoln could have abused it himself had he lived long enough.  shrug Who knows, maybe the Wilkes assassination scared future executives into a bit of modesty.  Not that I at all advocate it.  Boiling it down to ""lol Wilkes was pro-slavery, how could lincoln be the tyrant"" is taking a deliberately simple view of history even if slavery is the logical conclusion of tyranny.

Also, those examples don't really apply with the possible exception of Kyrgyzstan (I don't know enough about their politics to say anything either way).  Russia - Putin's a democratic despot, and extremely popular with his people. It's impossible to know if it'll last, but he's been around for over a decade and has a pretty decent grasp on power.  Cuba's transition from Fidel has been quite stable - once again, who knows about the future, but so far there's been no state-breaking levels of unrest.  Egypt could be heading that way, except once again, ""the people"" have little to do with it. There's no real ""populist leader"" figure there - it seems like the options are military rule, extreme Islamist rule, or anarchy, although that's also making a good deal of assumptions. The disastrous transition from Mubarak to Morsi doesn't count as a revolving door of dictators yet - it's not impossible, but by no means a guarantee.  With this tho, the issue would be with relating the mess in Ukraine to ANY kind of real revolution. Maybe something like this could be more applicable to some states in South America (Dios sabe que todavía vive Perón en los corazones de la gente) a few decades ago, but that's not what this is.  It's just annoying and frankly ignorant to apply something like this to an unbelievably messy and complex crisis that - by the way - has nothing to do with deposition of Lenin (what with him being dead for years and all) or even any Ukranian leader for the most part (the conflict is much more rooted in NATO/former Warsaw Pact tensions than any political figure except Putin, who is in no danger of being overthrown in some kind of revolution, despite how angry some of the Russian left is) to try to make a statement or something like that.

PerfectTiming,2hcqvd,TVUpbm,3,Wed Sep 24 20:18:12 2014 UTC,"Everything is related to everything in taxonomy if you go back far enough. I don't think they're very closely related though.  You think they're similar because they share bright colors and elongated beaks. And they're both relatively small.   Bright colors in birds are often used in males as displays to attract mates (think peacock) while many females adapted darker more muted colors used to camouflage themselves while nesting.   The difference between the beaks of kingfishers and hummingbirds is very important. Kingfishers have spear like beaks while hummingbirds have needle like beaks. The spear shape is common in herons and other fishing birds, because it allows them the range to snatch little fishies without entirely submerging their bodies to reach them. Hummingbirds have long and narrow beaks so they can drink nectar from flowers.   This is all off the top of my head though. I'm working on a school project and don't feel like looking all this shit up. I just recognized the kingfisher and it's one of the most beautiful birds imo."

PerfectTiming,2gtpkn,bobovski,9,Fri Sep 19 03:30:10 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately it's in the range of Mach 0.8-Mach 1, so that's not a sonic boom. A Mach shock that creates a sonic boom has a much more acute angle, what you're seeing is the plane creating a pressure gradient that compresses the surrounding air enough for the water vapor in the air to condense.  You can tell the difference since this cone of vapor has curved edges, a true sonic boom is generally invisible and should be nearly perfectly straight initially."

They orchestrate themselves to swim simultaneously under small chunks of ice that the sea lion is sitting on, and swim in just a way to create a wave that crashes down over the ice.  Doing this is supposed to both break up the ice, further isolating their prey with no exit, and to eventually ""wash off"" their prey from the ice when they get tired and can't fight it/hold out any longer.  My mind was blown watching that segment. Orcas really can be bastards in the animal kingdom, but they're fucking intelligent.  Unrelated note: I loved watching that show if for no other reason than how beautiful the scenery is. Penguins can be pretty adorable too."

PerfectTiming,2gbv8e,Redected,10,Sun Sep 14 14:20:38 2014 UTC,"(...) almost 200 BASE jumpers have been killed during the modern activity from between 1981 and 2012, of whom 50 have died whilst flying a wingsuit (...) For BASE jumping it is estimated 1 death per 500-1000 jumps (...)     ^ Source  Also... This study and this article both agree on a 0.4% (4/1000) fatality rate per jump.  Edit: You could still be right, but from what I gather from a quick research, there isn't enough literature to say so, because non-fatal jumps rarely get logged. With a 0.4% fatality rate, if a participant jumped 173 times, they would have a 50% ""global"" chance of survival. And following the first (unsourced) statistic instead, of 1/1000 deaths per jumps, it'd be 693 jumps."

PerfectTiming,2gbv8e,boynxdor,2,Sun Sep 14 19:17:26 2014 UTC,Serious question: how come wing suits can't slow themselves enough to stall/land without a chute?
PerfectTiming,2gbv8e,AvioNaught,2,Sun Sep 14 12:50:23 2014 UTC,I know I don't have enough understanding of aerodynamics but I know that it you go too slow you stall and fall out of the sky. I'm just wondering if a wing suit can eventually slow to the point where they stall. If you could do that just short of the ground you would be set. I'm sure the military are seriously looking into this.   I'll look up your link above. Thanks!
PerfectTiming,2gbv8e,boynxdor,1 point,Sun Sep 14 14:06:13 2014 UTC,"The thing about a stall is that it can happen at just about any speed given the right conditions. A stall isn't only dependent on speed: your angle of attack, wing shape, wingspan, and a whole bunch of other things are taken into account. Because of this, every flying thing has a different stall speed. Wing suits happen to have a high stall speed because of their aerodynamic design.  The other thing about a stall is that it isn't an automatic ""slow me down"" mechanic. This is a misconception because stalls generally happen at low speeds. All stalls do is cause you to lose lift and therefore much of your control.   So a wingsuit can easily stall itself out. But that stall will happen at a very high speed and will cause them to drop out of the sky (because they lose lift) which would actually increase their impact speed! That's also why airplanes don't stall before landing. They lose control over their pitch and plummet the last few metres to the ground. Instead they get as slow as possible without stalling.  TL;DR Wingsuits can't stall to land because their stall speed is much to high."

PerfectTiming,2fqny7,threequincy,1 point,Mon Sep 8 12:13:57 2014 UTC,"Interesting. I've always associated these RV nose-over incidents with landing, not takeoff (I'm building an RV-8, sister aircraft to the one in the video, so this is of interest to me).  Anyway, this is a known issue with tricycle (as opposed to tailwheel) RVs. As this video shows, under load, the nosewheel leg tends to flex backwards. The nosewheel in turn, pivots front on front of the wheel (image). So if you plant the nose gear too hard, and leg bends far enough, that bolt in the pivot catches in the ground and suddenly you're a pole-vault passenger.  I know some tricycle RV drivers who avoid landing on grass for this specific reason. This is one of the reasons I'm building my plane as a taildragger, though the main reason is that it just looks cooler. (tricycle vs taildragger)"

PerfectTiming,2f41o7,Year3030,84,Sun Aug 31 23:50:46 2014 UTC,Someone asked why the shutter was moving faster than the speed of light. I have explained this and posting it here since that comment was deleted ;)  It was most likely scanning the CCD from left to right. So it's not faster than the speed of light. It had performed half the scan when the flash went off and captured the rest of the image with the increased light levels.
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,pcman2000,20,Mon Sep 1 01:24:47 2014 UTC,"CMOS, not ccd. CCDs have global shutters."
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,Pestilence86,-11,Sun Aug 31 22:04:37 2014 UTC,"And for those who might be confused by the word ""shutter"", in digital photography there is no physical shutter as there was in film.  EDIT: There are systems with shutters, yes, my mistake. But the general idea of digital photography is that you have a digital sensor that is a matrix of pixels, each receive a certain amount of light (in some systems they always do receive light), and what the processing unit does is read each of the pixels for a given time. In CMOS sensors, this happens pixel by pixel, row by row, like reading a page in a book. Although this happens really fast, it still means that the upper parts of the image are ""older"" then the lower. In OPs image (which was photographed by tilting the camera to the left) the left part of the image is older than the right."
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,thetacticalspycrab,9,Sun Aug 31 22:57:55 2014 UTC,What? Yes there is. What do you think is blocking light from touching the sensor?
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,1842,8,Sun Aug 31 23:21:24 2014 UTC,"It depends what kind of camera.   Digital SLR and compacts still have various mechanical shutters. Smaller cameras have digital shutters (Eg cell phones, Gopro)"

PerfectTiming,2f41o7,Pestilence86,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:52:36 2014 UTC,"There does not always need to be something blocking the light. The pixels on your cameras sensor might receive light without the camera making use of it. The camera actually only ""reads"" the pixels for a given time (exposure time). This is highly dependent on the type of camera though. And there are a large variety of digital cameras and sensors."

PerfectTiming,2f41o7,s2514,6,Mon Sep 1 02:54:52 2014 UTC,If it was faster than the speed of light it and took the whole image at once it would either have all the flash or none.
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,Year3030,4,Mon Sep 1 03:17:59 2014 UTC,"Cell phone cameras ""scan"" like a scanner. If it was 35MM the whole area of the film is exposed at once (assuming you aren't counting the mirror flipping)."
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,1842,4,Sun Aug 31 23:37:05 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily. SLRs had large shutter curtains that had to move. They weren't instant, and when firing at high shutter speeds (>100/s) the shutter would expose part of the film at a time as both curtains would be in motion at the same time.   This is why cameras had a flash sync setting - usually the fastest speed that the camera could fire at and have both curtains out of the way.  If you used a faster shutter speed than this setting, you'd end up with photos like this.   Cameras with leaf shutters (for film, these would be rangefinders, point and shoots, and disposables), they would usually have a slower overall shutter speed (compared to SLR curtain shutters), but wouldn't have trouble with flash sync."

PerfectTiming,2f41o7,s2514,3,Mon Sep 1 00:34:59 2014 UTC,"One that doesn't scan. My understanding is that it scans and in the middle of that the flash goes off so the other half is with flash. If it took the picture ""all at once"" without scanning wouldn't it be unable to take a picture like this? It would either be with flash or without"
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,timdesuyo,2,Mon Sep 1 00:38:14 2014 UTC,"See /u/1842's post. Even my older D200, which has an all-at-once CCD runs up against synch speed issues, and you get this sort of effect. I linked to an example of it elsewhere in this thread, but apparently I got downvoted for it."
PerfectTiming,2f41o7,1842,2,Mon Sep 1 00:48:02 2014 UTC,Yup. It happens when the flash sync isn't used (or if the flash happens to fire at the wrong time).   Example I found on Flickr: https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/darkness/4885773863/

I lost my reflection on holiday as a kid. We used to visit the beach often. I loved the sea; the salty air, cool breeze, delicious ice-cream. And the sounds. I could fall sound asleep listening to the waves.  I was never a strong swimmer, but I enjoyed wading in the shallows along the shore, as my dad picked about in the pebbles for fossils, and my mum lazed on a colourful beach towel, soaking up the rare British sun. But most of all, I enjoyed playing games with my reflection.  It stared back up at me from the rippling water. My companion, my sister, my friend. We splashed the water's surface, hands coming to meet in a lo-five just before her image dissolved in the bubbling wake. But then she'd be right there again, looking back at me with a most amused smile as the water settled. We paddled together, and she cupped handfuls of air as I cupped handfuls of water, and we let the elements pour through our fingers to meet once again at that delicate boundary between our worlds.  I looked away for just a second. My dad was calling, holding aloft some ancient rock with an intaglia of seashells and ammonites decorating its face. I turned back to the sea-- ""Come on, let's go look at what dad found!""  ...But she was gone. I peered into the water, and saw only my feet and the sandy shallows below me. Then, out in the distance, something caught my eye: a familiar shape, a young girl, all alone... Me? I waved my arms, splashing hard against the surf to get her attention, and the figure waved back, flailing, but it was too far away to reach her. As I trotted back up the beach towards Dad, I turned back towards that girl I had seen. She was gone. The waters were calm. Only a residual foam of her struggle remained.  I didn't say anything about it to my parents. Nor did they ever talk about that trip again. I sometimes wonder, did either of them see it? They seemed... different, after. Like they had lost something. My reflection never returned. I'd place a hand on the bathroom mirror, and see only my hand, and the wall behind me.  Sometimes, I can still smell it. The sea air. The ocean waves. As if I never left. And when I close my eyes, I see myself floating on an endless horizon."

Drill teaches you in how to trust in your partner, trust in yourself, and makes you learn how to train yourself to your utmost best so you don't accidentally fuck up and pull the gun a quarter of an inch to the right and bust open you own jaw. When I was in Drill, our sergeants took to pulling air horns out and blasting them in our ears at random times to keep us focused. If we didn't flinch, we kept on with the routine, if we did, we usually punished ourselves, ie bashing ourselves in the face with the gun because we screwed up."

If we worked hard enough to qualify and entered a tournament, he'd get us ice cream shakes, even if we had to drop out cuz we lost. If we won the tournament, he'd get us shakes so we could dump them all on him (kinda like the Gatorade thing in football)"

One downside is that they're all grunts, and combat is their main purpose. taking fully cocked grunts and telling them to flip rifles like the dog and pony show it is, is taking away from their ... call it ""purpose"" to go ""get some"" overseas. It can be a little precarious on account that these Marines are now smack dab in DC where they drink (because that's what Marines do), and some are itching to get violent so badly they'll start a fight almost/sometimes completely unwarranted.

Or it could just be spun up like a bullet, and gain stability that way.  Disclamer: I may or may not have any idea what the fuck I am talking about. I'm not quite sure which."
PerfectTiming,2dv852,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Mon Aug 18 21:44:36 2014 UTC,"It depends on if the rocket is HE or HEAT. Generally, HEAT doesnt get spin, but HE can. Most HEAT rounds have fins which stabilize spin, while HE can be spun in the tube, or in flight. Im gunna say though, that this doesnt look like a HEAT round, or thats the strangest way of firing an AT rocket Ive yet seen.   Also, they just might not care. Some systems, like the old Grad rockets, were useful not because they could hit a pinpoint target, but because they pulverized an entire area. The shooters may not care if their rockets are accurate, but just that they all explode when they hit the ground."
PerfectTiming,2dv852,pavester,1 point,Mon Aug 18 22:00:31 2014 UTC,"It depends on the ammunition used, the most common rocket used with the launcher. The HE-Frag rocket uses canted nozzles in the base to provide spin  like so"

Xbox Kinect detects movement (of people) in a 3D space over time thanks to its two cameras being stationary at a fixed distance & angle.

A lot of mentally challenged kids wear those headphones at things with lots of people to block out most if the noise because they normally can't cope with it and start panicking. Another thing is the face that he's making, I realize that that sounds kind of rude but no non challenged kid would make that face normally, especially when there's a huge event going on. And the last isn't as much evidence as a hunch but generally a non challenged kid wouldn't dress like that at that age, again, this is one is a hunch and I'll admit seems a big far fetched."

There are any number of reasons why they'd go with those over earplugs, not least of which is because kids often hate earplugs. Muffs like this are also more effective than traditional earplugs.  The shirt is brightly colored, great for going to a crunchy music thing. It also looks like it could be a sport jersey shirt (like for cycling or goalkeeping). It would make sense for a pre-teen-range jersey to have bright cartoony stuff on it.  And last, his expression is just one of sheer timing.

PerfectTiming,2dg9bw,SirDigbyChknCaesar,3,Thu Aug 14 14:00:15 2014 UTC,It wouldn't matter much anyway. That tank had no more than 38 mm of armor on it and an AIM-9 carried 20-25 lb fragmentary warhead designed to shred the MIG-17. Given that the Sidewinder could reach speeds of Mach 2+ the added kinetic energy to those fragments would easily pierce the hull of the tank.

Well the javalina side of the fence was right by where I went to get to the dumpster, and the fence was essentially a super heavy duty chain link fence. The javalinas slept in a big pile right up against that fence. One day I was walking past, and felt an uncontrollable urge to poke one in his piggy little side. So I did. He panicked, jumped up, which upset the whole pile. Seeing as they couldn't take their rage out on me, they decided to go after the bison. Javalinas are basically small warthogs. Way outsized by the bison, but there about 5x as many of them. What followed was a small bloody skirmish that went surprisingly well for the javalinas.

Back when I was a zookeeper I would have to tell people MULTIPLE times a day not to dangle their children over the bear enclosure.  One time a dad and his kid (the kid was maybe 6 or 7ish) jumped two security fences was was trying to coax the male lion to come up to the fence so he could feed him hot dogs though the chain link. Luckily lions are incredibly lazy. Something about being at a zoo makes people lose all common sense.
PerfectTiming,2dbua4,snoooogans,3,Wed Aug 13 01:16:33 2014 UTC,"At the smallish zoo I go to most often everything with teeth is behind glass, it amazes me that all zoos aren't like that. It's not even about keeping the animals in any more, it's about keeping morons and disturbed people out. And little kids are like ferrets when it comes to finding there way through barriers. I was at the Pittsburgh zoo about a month before that little boy fell into the wild dog exhibit a few years ago and it seemed pretty secure. Haven't been back since, I wonder if they ever reopened the exhibit."
PerfectTiming,2dbua4,Punkamonk,6,Wed Aug 13 02:21:48 2014 UTC,"The fact that the kid could have taken shots to spare the lives of the meerkats but the family refused, wow, how daft can some people be!"
PerfectTiming,2dbua4,I_am_spoons,1 point,Wed Aug 13 02:44:49 2014 UTC,"Getting bit presents some really fucked up choices.  If you get bit there is no accurate way to tell if you have the disease.  The antidote is very effective but also very painful.  I think there are multiple shots over a few days?  There is no reliable test to tell if you are infected.  If you wait to see symptoms the odds of survival are very very bad.  So if a wild animal bites you, your best choice of action is to kill it so an autopsy can confirm if it was infected.  If it gets away, you face the choice of getting the painful shots just to be sure, or rolling the dice with a terrible death.  The choice is harder when the animal is not just a squirrel but someone's pet."

I went to the place and ran to the back of the building because the firemen were yelling that they needed a ladder truck to rescue people who were trapped on the fire escape of the building. When I looked up there was a woman and a child in the emergency ladder and they were leaning to try to escape the heat of the fire that was behind them. Meanwhile, a firefighter climbed to the front of the building on the roof and saw the two on the ladder fire. He bent toward the stairs to rescue them, there the fire escape gave way. I was photographing when they fell. then I turned back. I understood what was happening and did not want to see them on the ground. I still remember the moment I turned the body. I shivered. According to firefighters, the woman broke his fall child. Diana died on the evening of the same day. “With this photograph Stanley J. Forman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975."

PerfectTiming,2cuoh0,Sir_Von_Tittyfuck,12,Thu Aug 7 17:59:49 2014 UTC,"Rolling shutter is when the camera doesn't take a picture of everything in the field of view at once, but rather by scanning across what you want to take a picture of. In OP's case, it's scanning horizontally, and you can see it quite well. That one is due to changes in exposure during the scan. Another familiar one is smearing, like when propeller planes are in the air and the propellers look like they warp instead of being clearly defined."

PerfectTiming,2cbmfh,siwhoaks,8,Fri Aug 1 18:15:06 2014 UTC,"Well, let's just try to get on the right scale of magnitude, here.  So, I'm going to assume the kid is 10 m away and the ball is 1 cm away (remember, scales of magnitude).  According to this, the average ball speed should be around 185 km/h. This is just a wimpy kid, so maybe half of that is more realistic and we want scales of magnitude, so let's assume 100 km/h.  Let's assume that air resistance at a distance of 10 m won't slow the ball down by a significant amount. Thus, we have a ball traveling 1 cm at 100 km/h. Let's convert the units: the ball is travelling 0.001 m at 27 m/s.   Thus, it'll take approximately 0.000003 seconds to hit the camera. OP is off by a little.  Of course, this is going to be slightly off due to the fact that the kid appears to be using a plastic ball and club. But if we assume that the ball is traveling only 10 km/h (very slow), we're still looking at 0.00003 seconds till collision."

PerfectTiming,2c1wy9,JLT303,212,Tue Jul 29 18:23:59 2014 UTC,"Okay. So I did some math. There are assumptions and my measurements are inaccurate, but it should give a nice ballpark estimate. Here it goes.   So using this gyf and using the shadow on the ball I saw the baseball went through the car in 10 frames (so I use frames 67 and 77 for my measurements). I looked up this car and the width is 69.9 inches.  Next I measured the size of the baseball when it entered the car and it was 14 pixels wide. An actual baseball is 3 inches in diameter, so we have a scale of 3/14 inches per pixel. I measured the car moved 40 pixels (8.571 inches) in the time that it takes the ball to go through the car.   Assume the man throws at about 60 mph, we get that the car moves.... 60 mph (speed of ball) * 8.571 inches (distance traveled by car) / 69.9 inches (distance traveled by ball)  A whopping 7.4 mph!"

PerfectTiming,2c1wy9,SpicyCornflake,12,Wed Jul 30 00:48:10 2014 UTC,It's a 2-seam fastball with sidearm action.  The rotation of the ball will make it start left and curve right.

PerfectTiming,2c1wy9,FX114,101,Wed Jul 30 00:45:37 2014 UTC,"okay. Did some more cases just for you. at a baseball speed of 60 mph, the cars speed is 7.4 mph at a baseball speed of 65 mph, the cars speed is 8.0 mph at a baseball speed of 70 mph, the cars speed is 8.6 mph at a baseball speed of 75 mph, the cars speed is 9.2 mph at a baseball speed of 80 mph, the cars speed is 9.8 mph at a baseball speed of 85 mph, the cars speed is 10.4 mph at a baseball speed of 90 mph, the cars speed is 11.0 mph at a baseball speed of 95 mph, the cars speed is 11.6 mph at a baseball speed of 100 mph, the cars speed is 12.3 mph     so we can probably reasonably assume the car is somewhere around 10 mph"

PerfectTiming,2c1wy9,Fred-Bruno,4,Sat Aug 2 00:16:36 2014 UTC,"Almost every picture here violates the rules.   Rule number 6 alone would decimate a significant amount of the content here if it was implemented. I wish mods would be more active about the rules but if the community here still likes to see a picture of someone firing a gun or a tank or a howitzer that is shooting or someone lighting a lighter or taking pictures of simple lightning for the 347.395 time, I guess there is no point in doing that (lightning is in this list as people who take photographs of lightning use either long exposure pictures (rule 2) or other equipment that turn let you do dozens of this ""perfect"" timed pictures in one night. Of course there are also exceptions to all of the above mentioned).  Still, I wish they (and we as a community) would be more picky about that. In my humble opinion, the current quality of this sub sucks pretty much lately.   That being said, I like this post although it is staged."

PerfectTiming,2b6vtv,imareddituserhooray,2,Sun Jul 20 14:38:44 2014 UTC,I didn't think about how people use long exposure with lightning. I can see the argument there.  One guy had a really good lightning shot recently where it looked like his friend was shooting lightning out of his hand. I suppose it depends on what the lightning is interacting with and if it's obviously long exposed.  Tough call. :/

PerfectTiming,2b1z31,lookxdontxtouch,10,Fri Jul 18 20:27:30 2014 UTC,"TL:DR: X Rays heat the air surrounding a nuclear explosion at nearly the speed of light, into a nearly perfect sphere of super-heated air.  The volume of this sphere is dictated by the yield of the bomb.   From Richard Rhode's Pulitzer Prize winning, ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb""    ...The radiant energy loosed by the chain reaction is hot enough to take the form of soft X rays; these leave the physical bomb and its physical casing first, at the speed of light, far in front of any mere explosion.  Cool air is opaque to X rays and absorbs them, heating; ""the very hot air,"" Hans Bethe writes, ""is therefore surrounded by a cooler envelope, and only this envelope""-hot enough at that-""is visible to observers at a distance."" The central sphere of air, heated by the X rays it absorbs, reemits low-energy X rays which are absorbed in turn at its boundaries and reemitted beyond.  By this process of downhill leapfrogging, which is known as radiation transport, the hot sphere begins to cool itself.  When it has cooled to half a million degrees-in about one ten thousandth of a second-a shock wave forms that moves out faster than radiation transport can keep up.  ""The shock therefore separates from the very hot, nearly isothermal [i.e., uniformly heated] sphere at the center,"" Bethe explains.  Simple hydrodynamics describes the shock front: like a wave in water, like a sonic boom in air.  It moves on, leaving behind the isothermal sphere confined within its shell of opacity, isolated from the outside world, growing only slowly by radiation transport on this millisecond scale of events.""  What the world sees is the shock front and it cools into visibility, the first flash, milliseconds long, of a nuclear weapon's double flash of light, the flashes too closely spaced to distinguish with the eye. Further cooling renders the front transparent; the world if it still has eyes to see looks through the shock wave into the hotter interior of the fireball and ""because higher temperatures are now revealed,"" Bethe continues, ""the total radiation increases toward a second maximum"": the second, longer flash.  The isothermal sphere at the center of the expanding fireball continues opaque and invisible, but it also continues to give up its energy to the air beyond its boundaries by radiation transport.  That is, as the shock wave cools, the air behind it heats.  A cooling wave moves in reverse of the shock wave, eating into the isothermal sphere.  Instead of one simple thing the fireball is thus several things at once: an isothermal sphere invisible to the world; a cooling wave moving inward toward that sphere, eating away its radiation; a shock front propagating into undisturbed air, air that has not yet heard the news.  Between each of these parts lay further intervening regions of buffering air.     edit: This book is my most recommended read of all time, hands down.  It is an epic work of history, but at many points reads like a Tom Clancy thriller.  It details the political, scientific, and intensely human developments that's end result is the atom bomb coming into the world.  It won the Pulitzer for a reason.  For a more strictly scientific explanation, this page is great: http://www.abomb1.org/nukeffct/enw77b3.html"

Some people are more susceptible than others.  The guidance in whitewater kayaking is to never let your elbows get above your shoulder to prevent an upward tug by the paddle from dislocating the shoulder.  Once it happens you're more prone to a repeat.  It is very painful.  The proper first aid for field relocation is good to know if you're kayaking in a remote spot (as is likely)."
PerfectTiming,2aj4gm,ImMadeOfRice,5,Sun Jul 13 00:06:43 2014 UTC,This has nothing to do with kayaking.  If this injury didn't dislocate his shoulder the next most obvious injury would be compartment syndrome.

PerfectTiming,2aj4gm,islandthyme,11,Sat Jul 12 20:52:04 2014 UTC,It is an exaggeration but I can definitely see a dislocated shoulder and degloving of his arm. Which would create a scene where it would be justified to refer to his arms as being ripped off.
PerfectTiming,2aj4gm,vincentvangobot,7,Sun Jul 13 00:24:34 2014 UTC,"My little brother has a friend they call Two Armed Dave. He was going on a zip line across a river and when he let go the line wrapped around his forearm and cut it off. They immediately got him out of the water and took him to the hospital. Well a guy fishing about half a mile down the river found his arm, put it in his beer cooler and took it to the hospital. They were able to reattach the arm and he now has about 65% strength in that hand."

PerfectTiming,2acluv,HOPSCROTCH,8,Thu Jul 10 23:43:09 2014 UTC,"in cricket they tend to wear helmets Balls tend to be a bit slower, but a lot harder"
PerfectTiming,2acluv,shashashaha,4,Fri Jul 11 02:09:03 2014 UTC,"I've always wondered about speed comparisons with cricket bowling vs baseball pitching and this comment finally prompted me to look it up.   Consensus on average in baseball seems to be 88-94mp/h with the fastest pitchers at 100-104mp/h. So actually very similar, since in cricket the really fast bowlers tend to be hovering between 85-100.   I just always assumed baseball would be a lot faster than that because of the throwing style. TIL.   They probably should introduce some sort of grill or face protection in baseball, or in juniors at least. But the cricket style helmet would be way too constricting to swing a baseball bat in."
PerfectTiming,2acluv,HOPSCROTCH,2,Fri Jul 11 03:08:03 2014 UTC,"I think a cricket ball bouncing would reduce the speed of the ball slightly by the time it reaches the batsman, compared to a baseball which doesn't touch the ground."
PerfectTiming,2acluv,kvltc0re,2,Fri Jul 11 04:41:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but one of the favourite bowling strategy in Cricket consists of delivering the bowl without a bounce, or make it bounce just at the batter's feet.  However it is still against the rules to throw the bowl higher than the batter's waist."
PerfectTiming,2acluv,HOPSCROTCH,1 point,Fri Jul 11 05:29:10 2014 UTC,"Yes I am aware of how cricket works. The one at the feet is called a yorker, the latter you describe is a beamer, and yeah basically those are only bowled as accidents when the bowler releases the ball too early."
PerfectTiming,2acluv,Cymry_Cymraeg,1 point,Fri Jul 11 06:26:15 2014 UTC,"I thought the same, which is why I expected a bigger difference. I guess bowlers having a runup and pitchers doing it from standing is what evens it out."

PerfectTiming,2acluv,randomly-generated,2,Fri Jul 11 05:52:22 2014 UTC,"No, they're not; cricket fast-bowlers bowl just as fast, if not faster than baseball fast-pitchers.  Plus a batsman in cricket stands more directly in front of the ball than a batter does in baseball."

PerfectTiming,2acluv,Perm_Coupon,0,Fri Jul 11 05:47:46 2014 UTC,Actually it's because the force of a soft-ball is much greater than that of a baseball.  Dumbass.
