And the reason they dont want to expand their staff has never really been explained so there is only speculations for that.  It seems to be some kinda mentality thing, that they like being a indie sized team that has close relations to each other and such, but again, pure speculations."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,ToGoodLooking,5,Wed Jul 22 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"The reason they don't want to expand their staff is for the same reason they don't expand the Minecraft staff. They follow a philosophy.  They want to avoid to become a ""big"" company in that regard, because they are afraid of becoming something similar to EA or Microsoft. They want to be a company where the devs make the games they want to make and not make the games that their bosses want. This may not sound like a big deal but if you are a developer then it is a REALLY big deal to have freedom in your work."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,kingsparis,6,Wed Jul 22 02:31:36 2015 UTC,"Sure, but what good is making games if they're just going to fail because you're not willing to put the resources towards making it work"
Scrolls,3e4qsl,fdagpigj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"I think they never wanted to make anything that would require too much resources (with Minecraft money they'd probably never need to), but what they didn't realise was that Scrolls was way too ambitious for a just-for-fun project"
Scrolls,3e4qsl,uff0,3,Wed Jul 22 10:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yep it's too bad. It's the best TCG I have played (and I have played lots of them), and there most certainly is a market for more TCGs than HS and MTG out there. Too bad Mojang / MS doesn't seem to wanna put in the bare minimum."

Scrolls,3e4qsl,LargeIcedCoffee,11,Wed Jul 22 10:21:52 2015 UTC,"If this is how Mojang handles its games, I have determined that this will be the last game from them I ever purchase (no surprise there).    Can you imagine if you were waiting patiently for the release of Scrolls (you may have been one of the five people who heard about its release) and finally purchased it, only to find out 6 months later Mojang is dropping support?  It's an absolute embarrassment.  Other companies seem to have no problem getting onto Steam, Ipad, advertising... Fucking Ubisoft games sign you onto piece of shit Uplay from steam and Mojang couldn't figure out how to get a game onto Steam?  Are you kidding me?  Same with iPad.  No other companies seem to have issues... Hearthstone works and I have to sign into my battle net account.  What, is a Mojang account sacred or something?  What kills me the most is that they waved things in front of us and just said, ""nevermind!""  Remember that long excel spreadsheet of Wild ideas and suggestions? Then Mojang just took it upon themselves to put in a change that wasn't listed, then it was such a joke they reverted it a bit later.  Single player campaign?  Nope.  Working really hard on the iPad vers... nevermind!  This was somebody's side project and I honestly don't think the team could be bothered with putting extra effort, time or money into this game.  Everything was, ""Welp, this seems like a lot of work and we have a small team.""  The only thing that truly shined throughout all of this was Carnalizer's art.  Dude obviously gives a shit about his work and is proud of it.  Good on him.  The least they could have done was just gone silent instead of making this damn announcement so we could have enjoyed the game for a few months.  They've gone silent enough throughout all of this that it should have been second nature.  I see like 60 people online, nobody from the top 100... It's funny, the biggest news to come out of Scrolls seems to be that Mojang is dropping it.  People didn't even know this game was released, but they sure found out it was dead.  So to answer, did they care?  Maybe at first, but once they realized how much work goes into a game... and then the whole microsoft deal to get paid just to stick around... I don't know.    The community seemed to care a hell of a lot more."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,chacer98,4,Tue Jul 21 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"I think I might be in the minority, but the vacation thing is what really rubbed me the worst about the team after a while. I get it, it's good to take a break, but it seemed excessive to me. I think vacations are actually mandated by sweedish law so idk if there was any room where they even could work if they wanted. But it just seems if they were really passionate we would get more than dead silence when they were on these 2 week vacations. And even more I would hope some of them would continue working even just a little during their off time. I have serious doubts there was anyone setting any real deadlines for the dev team, which in part might be why they seemed not to care; because they didn't have to."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,kingsparis,3,Wed Jul 22 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"The problem was that the company follows a certain philosophy. A philosophy that is built around the idea of being a small company and making games that the devs themselves want to make. Therefore they wouldn't get more developers to work on it.  Then it's also the fact that when it comes to determine how much money you are willing to invest and hope for profit, it's not as simple as just ""market more"".  And yes, vacations are mandatory in Sweden."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,bluej10013,4,Wed Jul 22 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"They made custom games instead of a single player campaign, which allows the community to build more content than they ever could."

They feel just as hurt as we do, I know it. The standard of the competition was way out of their league. How can 12 people max beat most likely over a hundred of Blizzard's team? It really was a war of attrition, but the des did fight it for two good years."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,JeyJ24,7,Wed Jul 22 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the gameplay devs themselves are fine.  But they didn't get the backend devs to support the new platforms (I know its a helluva lot of work, I work at a software company), nor the faith of the other arms of the company for changing up the business model or marketing tactics, you can see in the FAQ how quickly they gave up.    I don't know why Scrolls had such a hard time keeping player's attention though.  That might be the key thing, they did have some ample opportunities but it never worked for long.  Why is that?  Part of it to me is even when the game was more active, it quickly dropped off.  In almost all aspects it seems superior to Hearthstone in my opinion, although now hearthstone's pace of development is quickly making it more varied in its gameplay, so scrolls wouldn't of been able to keep up.  Howevver even with hundreds of new cards and several new game modes, hearthstone still feels a lot more flat strategically (though less so than before)."
Scrolls,3e4qsl,squiddybiscuit,5,Wed Jul 22 01:40:20 2015 UTC,"There is a twitch vod on here where Atmaz was explaining the situation we are in.  I'm paraphrasing a lot but he said this.... there was a big problem with player retention. It's obvious to see even with public sources. We (Mojang) wasn't prepared to build the game bigger. There were a lot of risks that we were not willing to make. The risks were too big. There are a lot of short comings... Like with the iOS release. The account system wasn't approved and it was a lot of work to revamp the system. Things early on weren't put in place for player retention. We didn't even have a way to notify users from email (the check box that says I want to receive email notifications). Scrolls required a lot more man power and changes at the time and that was a lot of risks that many good people just couldn't make.  If you listen to the whole thing you can get the just that Mojang, despite being amazing at making games, are extremely inexperienced. They got pushed into the spotlight kinda almost just through luck...  I love the devs, they made probably the best gamr I've ever played.  But it shows...  they know how to make games while falling short on management.  Things were not put into place from the very beginning to make the game self sustaining. They also followed a certain design philosophy that they didn't want to break.  Scrolls didn't take off because Mojang wasn't ready for it to.  Mojang isn't Blizzard status yet... It's frustrating yes. They made a couple pretty darn good games. Minecraft though was a godsend.  Hopefully what they learned is useful enough to make their future projects succeed. I don't want to believe that Mojang was a one hit wonder.  I'm hopeful though, maybe one day they can revisit Scrolls and give it the propper attention it truely deserves."

Scrolls,3dtqlg,ShoppedYourPost,13,Mon Jul 20 03:46:49 2015 UTC,"The announcement killed any interest that most of the top players had.  The game was on its last legs, but Mojang took away at least a few months of fun by announcing the game's death 6 months after release.  We at least had a little bit of hope that Mojang would pull it together; this announcement obviously shattered that hope.  We had about 150 people on before announcement, but at least many of those were in the top 100.  Now it's about 60-75 when I sign on and nobody in the top 100.  What's the point of playing?  Thanks, Mojang.    I'm playing Hearthstone a little, but mostly other genres as no card game is really piquing my interest.  I'm waiting on Duelyst before I make a commitment.  I don't want to pour tons of hours into it and take the time posting suggestions that never make it to the game for another alpha title... then the game gets dropped like a bad habit.  I still check here hoping that some indie developer will announce they are buying Scrolls and are taking over.  I realize that the chances of this are slim to none.  Even if the community gets this game up and running, would it be worth it?  Barely anyone will play and nobody will be able to do the artwork to add new things... we just don't have a community large enough to support something like that and keep it interesting.  I just beat Wolfenstein new order, was fun."
Scrolls,3dtqlg,LargeIcedCoffee,5,Sun Jul 19 12:33:37 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  Was it fair to let people know? Yes. Was it good for the game? No. I kind of switched over to duelyst but it is still at (for me super laggy constantly freezing) browser only stage. It is way harder to get all the cards (basically same grind like hearthstone) but I would have been completely fine with scrolls being similiar ""p2w"" (consider you still don't have to pay anything if you play enough so I don't think it is actual p2w just like hearthstone isn't) but just sustain itself in exchange. Scrolls is still very unique in terms of gameplay and that whole client/chat/replays/spectate system is very advanced and makes playing very comfortable.  I still don't get it and I don't think devs get it if they think rescuing the game wouldn't have been worth the effort. If you finally did it right it would have been. To me it always seems those devs were just working on what seems most fun to them (like creating new sets), not what was necessary/good for the game. Doesn't work that way, sorry."

If there is a way for it to be saved, the interest still needs to be there, and we need to show it off.   I definitely think that there are ways to save Scrolls, but if things don't change as they are at the moment, and nothing is done, and we have a low player base, it won't work out.

Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 07:17:31 2015 UTC,Steam Charger look more balanced then blood reaver. Love the ability.
Scrolls,3dtyiq,LordPhyriX,3,Tue Jul 21 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""and attacks again""? Would it simply gain +1 current speed? The only thing currently not possible is forcing the unit to move to the tile it attacked, and I might have that in tomorrow's patch (or whenever I push out the next one after today's one) (and I agree with flamerage here that Blood Reaver felt a bit too powerful, effectively a 3/2/4 for 4/3 with Rage, because Rage is a really powerful ability especially on high-attack units. I would do a last-minute nerf before rolling out the update that includes it in the default set, but I can't decide on how to change it)."
Scrolls,3dtyiq,LordPhyriX,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"1.) I wasn't certain how to balance Blood Reaver, but it's too much work to change, so I won't. 2.) It attacks and, if it destroyed the unit, moves to that space. Then, it attacks in the same direction it origionally did (up, down, left, right) with the exess attack. If there's any attack left, it repeats."
Scrolls,3dtyiq,LordPhyriX,3,Tue Jul 21 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, so if there's no target in the same line, it'd also stop, or would it still move as long as it has attack left until it hits another target or edge (or maybe it'd lose an attack point for every empty tile)? Would it be able to perform several of these attacks per turn (if it has the ap)?"
Scrolls,3dtyiq,LordPhyriX,3,Tue Jul 21 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"If it had no more target's it stops. It can move it's speed, and then use the last one to attack, or at any time you want to."
Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:04 2015 UTC,"I think I'll execute it by making it consume its current attack every time it attacks, so it could only attack several time per turn if it stops due to lack of targets or if it gets an attack buff after attacking, because that'd be the easiest to implement (not requiring any extra variables to keep track of the remaining attack and/or if it can still attack) and I think it might also allow for some cool plays"
Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what you mean, but I have an idea foor an ability (that might just be this.) Ram- Each time creature attacks, it's attack is deacreased by 1. If it destroys a unit, it may move and attack again."
Scrolls,3dtyiq,LordPhyriX,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that when it attacks, it loses current attack (current attack is reset to be equal to base attack at the start of each turn) equal to the damage it dealt to its target, then moves to the old location of the target and tries to attack in the same direction again (if it has more than 0 attack). That way it would end up with 0 current attack after destroying a few units and would then automatically stop even if there are still targets. But it would also mean it cannot attack again that turn (well, it could perhaps attack for 0 damage unless I disable that even for normal attacks). Edit: And that Ram ability is actually really easy for me to implement, all I need is an event trigger for when a unit attacks. It wouldn't be a trait but I don't think it'd be common enough to need its own trait (and it's actually possible to fake traits by giving it a trait that doesn't exist and leaving the description empty, since the game doesn't care if a trait is legal or not when rendering it)"

Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"Federal Soldier would be in Industry, while Hawkhelm and Hell lizards are in Aggression   good to know, the official lore page isn't all too obvious :P   Blade Automaton would die without gaining the bonus   That's kinda the point, it's a niche card that can only be taken good advantage of by attacking a 0 or 1-attack unit (yes, this includes structures, so it'd absolutely wreck structures) and/or charging straight for the commander :P But if you want I can make it more viable by changing it to a 4/3 or increasing the cost to not reduce the attack quite as drastically"
Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"Oh and regarding Clandestine Commander having Stealth, yes that can be extremely powerful esp. against aggression since it lets you completely shut down any early aggression, but keep in mind it means you also can't use your commander for attacking, and generally attacking low-health not-overly-high-attack units with the commander is the best way to deal with weenies. But yes, mostly it was just to have something unique, although admittedly atm neutral commander is just objectively weaker than the industry and clandestine ones"

Scrolls,3dtyiq,flameragee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know where the comment was (or if it was edited out) about the sand dunes, but I think we could, at a later date/patch, have entire maps. Rather than just rotating backgrounds, we could have terrain all over, representing the fact that the battles occur all over the world. Maybe we could even have an ability, or spells, that change small areas of the map to your advantage, or opponent's disadvantage. This is something that doesn't occur in Duelyst, and I think it would make Project Hallazen a unique game."

And a map cycle (or heck, a random terrain generator) sounds cool, I'll definitely look into adding that later on (after I have at least the basics for terrain manipulation in), it could indeed make gameplay more varied and is not something many ccg's explore."

Scorzen Freak (Zealous character) Ability: When a nearby unit is damaged, Scorzen Freak gain 1 current speed.  Dust to Coin (Industry Spell) Ability: Increase current coin by number of mana you have.  Slowing Sand (Zealous Spell) Ability: Create Slowing Sand Tiles that need 2 speed to move, in a 2x2 square.  Scorzen Trapper (Zealous character) Ability: Create a Slowing Sand tile that need 2 speed to move.  Defender Fox (Tradition character) Ability: Intimidate, if health is increased, then gain +1 attack.

Moon Mystic (Tradition character) Ability: When Moon Mystic comes into play, Target a friendly character, and increase it's health by 2.  Sun Mystic (Tradition character) Ability: When Sun Mystic comes into play, Target a friendly character, and increase it's attack by 1.  Hawkhelm flagbearer (Aggression character) Ability: While this character is in play, all friendly units have 1+ attack.  Bleeding Rage (Aggression enchantment) Ability: Decrease health by 1 and increase attack and speed by 1.  Bleeding Martyr (Aggression character) Ability: Whenever, Bleeding Martyr is damaged, increase attack by 2.  There are some suggestions, hope you like them and put them in the game."

Scrolls,3dlnym,bluej10013,2,Fri Jul 17 07:28:34 2015 UTC,why would you need all those ramp scrolls if you have unlimited wild? and whats the game plan with this deck?
Scrolls,3dlnym,ultioptimo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:01:23 2015 UTC,"I use it in games without unlimited wild as well. You could reasonably drop to one of each ramp or omit them entirely if you only want it for unlimited wild games. It can use as much mana as you can give it, though, with all the draw.  The focus is getting a construct with all the enchantments, or a couple good constructs if they're running oppressor's rule or expurgator. The first ten turns are just ramping, removal, and construct feeding. Once your construct is set up, you should be able to return to nature some sisters, draw your whole deck, drop some uniques, and win.   I think it's really fun to play, but I love control decks."

I agree with your points but I guess it sucks to work on a plan B as a dev in case of people not liking your game and it also basically might be wasted resources if it never is needed.  They also tend to put everything into rescueing plan A instead of starting to work on plan B if things look grim. Anyway EA is a horrible company. The way they handled battleforge was absolutely disgusting and no comparison to mojang. They literally start milking games that look ""weak"" in numbers so that they have no chance of recovering. Fuck EA. Seriously.  Also the idea behind battleforge was absolutely genious and I think it would work if done right. RTS genre took a hit but if a company like blizzard would for some reason make such a game it would be amazing."

It scratches the deck builder itch that Scrolls used to scratch so well. I need to try Duelyst again - I only played in a very early closed alpha state, and while I didn't have the best first impression, I'm sure things have come a long way in the last few months.   What is it about Scrolls fans that draws us to the games with the smallest dev teams and the smallest fan bases? We're just gluttons for punishment :) ."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,GFP_Smogan,4,Wed Jul 15 13:04:23 2015 UTC,Spellweaver is my pick so far. Its like MTG with a twist (speed) and no more manaproblem (well 75% less manaproblems).  I will say that if you play spellweaver you will have to drop som money on it sooner or later. 39 euros gets you going good and it¬¥s what I can pay for any 100+ h game.    edit: AND the 45 cards per colour is WAY to smal pool. Hope they add to doubble asap.
Scrolls,3ddb0r,PeeFuuScrolls,5,Wed Jul 15 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"I tried Solforge and while I didn't particularly enjoy it, it is a completely different game from MtG, much more so than spellweaver and Hearthstone.  I don't know where you're getting that it's a copy cause its mechanics are pretty unique and different from all other listed TCGs."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,Aj0o,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, when you're just starting out in SolForge, it doesn't seem all that different from M:TG mechanically."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,Falanin,4,Wed Jul 15 22:10:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I just don't see how. Compared with hearthstone and spellweaver where every turn you draw a card, and develop a resource that allows you to play better spells and creatures that go into combat with each other, Solforge seems pretty different to me.  You draw a fresh hand every turn and you're limited in the ammount of cards you can play with no ""mana"" resource. The scaling up of the spells and creatures is done in a completely different way where the cards you play level up and when you draw them again after reshuffling your deck every X turns they are more powerful making it so there's a new kind of advantage where a player can come ahead by basically developing a more powerful deck.  Now, I've only played it for like 2 months a long time ago but I think credit where credit is due and unlike most other TCGs Solforge was not trying to mimick MtG. I've been playing Spellweaver lately and for me in its essence it is a sleeker version magic with a more hearthstoney combat system and the additional speed and 2 lanes mechanics on top. I've been having a lot of fun and a lot of that I think it's due to it sticking closely to a proven formula whereas Solforge strayed too far and didn't really captivate me..."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,Aj0o,2,Wed Jul 15 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"Spellweaver feels very much like pay to win.  If you calculate the cost of a single rare card through unbinding and crafting, you reach a figure close to 3000 gold. If you consider that a MP game will only net you about 45-50g on average (assuming a 50% win rate), it's clear that you're never going to get a decent collection just by playing.  I already sank ‚Ç¨40 into it and I still can't build anything better than budget decks."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,zakatlas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:30 2015 UTC,Yes. No trading and the cost of crafting makes geting all the rares and epics hard to get. I'm no expert on the meta but it seems budget and close-to budget decks seem to be powerful so that they are playable in multiplayer. The cards seem much more balanced than scrolls so there are loads of good commons and uncommons.
Scrolls,3ddb0r,PeeFuuScrolls,2,Wed Jul 15 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rares & Epics might be expensive to craft, but I find that Commons/Uncommons are actually quite good on their own."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,GFP_Smogan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that the game is grindy if you want to play for free. A bit more grindy than I would like. But I think it is important to note that the quests and level ups are where you get most of your gold from, so 45-50g per match isn't necessarily representative of the time per rare.  Still, if your goal is a competitive deck that is anything but aggro, be ready to drop some cash or play a lot of matches. Paying players certainly have a big advantage over probably the first 100 hours (or more?) of game play."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,ho-tdog,2,Wed Jul 15 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say MtG is awful for new players. It's hard and expensive to play competitively sure, but you don't need to do that in order to have fun with it.   There is actually a new Free to play video game for it called Magic Duels: Origins. It's already out on iOS and Xbox Live and should be out on Steam and I think PS4 later this month. If buying boosters and hoarding insane amounts of cards has put you off from MtG, I would certainly give this a try. It's a digital adaption of the original and longest running TCG and gets expansions four times per year. It isn't in danger of being discontinued and it most likely won't get stale after half a year."
Scrolls,3ddb0r,Rahkeesh,2,Thu Jul 16 08:01:55 2015 UTC,"The ironic part is that the best single-player content (story mode) is 100% free.

I tried Spellweaver but I have to say that I'm not a fan of the resource system even though it is a big improvement over MTG and HEX. The thing is that having your resource in your deck means that you have to rely on luck as to whether or not you even draw it and sometimes that leads to situations where you're just sitting there for several turns watching your opponent play while you draw resource cards instead of things that might help you counter their strategy. That kind of situation is really boring and frustrating. :/

Scrolls,3dbx67,Kyleofgames,2,Wed Jul 15 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"After Scrolls I think I will leave TCGs for a while. I've been playing a little bit of Prismata recently and I think it'll be the game I'll be playing. They told you is like TCG with elements of strategy games like StarCraft but that's not true at all. It's not a TCG, it has no draw luck and anything like that it's just a strategy game where some of the units are randomly selected every turn (both players has access to it) So you have to play accordingly to the units presented to you every turn and that makes it a lot diverse and you're not attached to a deck (there are no decks) but if you're looking for a TCG experience with deck builder and stuff Prismata is not that kind of game.  Anyway Prismata is still in very early process and the population is quite low but I've been reading and watching some of the dev thoughts about the progress of the game, features, etc. and I just feel like they know what they are doing. So if you want some strategy I'll give it a try! :D"

I'd describe duelyst as a Scrolls Light version that's much more simplified and has quicker matches with a bit more rng. I will note that grinding in Duelyst is not as hard as in Hearthstone, but it's noticeable enough. If you haven't tried duelyst at all this might be a great time to get into it. I didn't mind the grind too bad the first time through, I just don't want to do it all over again. For a nonpaying player to really get a top tier deck in Duelyst you basically have to pick one of the factions and disenchant all cards from the other factions in order to have enough currency to craft all the cards you'd need. So in my mind that's also a negative, but it really does appear the Duelyst devs are on their shit. They normally have updates and balance tweeks going out once per week on Tuesdays.   Please note that I'm not sure as to whether or not you can still get keys or not as Duelyst moved from Alpha to Beta today. From what I remember they advertised alpha as being closed just like they are doing with beta so far and they never had a problem throwing out keys before. So hopefully that hasn't changed.

That said, people who are disagreeing with you, are often doing so because you're overly-critical, not-even-trying-to-be-constructive, hysterical jumps-to-incorrect-conclusions, always-yelling-at-people guy, not because you don't have a point sometimes (although you have on occasion just been irrational as hell).

If the service was free to use then it is nearly identical to it's real life counterpart. (which literally has more value)  In the past I have said that this upfront cost makes it fair because we value real life as ""fair"" as we all have roughly the same time we can work. In a virtual space it really isn't as fair. Some people will ALWAYS have more time than you can.  My idea here is that these trades people make are problematic yet we can't get rid of them, the are very necessary for the game to run. Instead we make the ""fairer"" trade more valuable of a trade to make. If playing a campaign mode gets you all the cards and teaches you the game then it is a trade that will more or less be taken by most people. Of course there always be people who have very little time for this hobby. We could allow them to pay for all the cards when they buy the game as well.  The issue at it's deepest roots is that the trades people make in scrolls are merely ""fair"" and never beneficial. If you could pay market price for a pair of pants then it's just okay. If you get a ""deal"" on pants then you've really gotten ahead right?"

Scrolls,3dcqgj,hearthstonerxj9_x4,2,Wed Jul 15 07:27:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair I have to root for Hearthstoner here. This guy was barely wrong and got a nice opinion on why this game failed or better said, he saw early what the core failures are that scrolls has/had. He just wrote it too provocatively and agressively for some (I personally like it, I'm a hothead myself and used to argument like that in the past, but I got more calm).  I would have liked it more if this game was more unfair, as long as I could get the cards I wanted without having to buy some ingame currency. Why? Because it feels awesome to achieve something without spending money - yeah it may feel like a grind for many, but that aside the big selling games are League (and here you can buy stuff with ingame cash and its a grind to unlock every champ) and HS (you all know that price model huh?) - this is like one of the key factors for an successful game + having a competitive scene."

Me and Smogan and Blinky really like it so far, it is a good improvement over Magic in a fair few categories and the only downside right now is that the card pool is limited as it is fairly early but it has great potential."
Scrolls,3d5x6n,squiddybiscuit,2,Mon Jul 13 19:50:25 2015 UTC,._. I don't want a fifth resource... at all...  -hides from squiddy's wrathful eye beams-
Scrolls,3d5x6n,Cradstache,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, I wish there was at least a 5th resource! But I'm happy with 4 too. I feel like 5 would have added a significantly more vast amount of variety!"
Scrolls,3d5x6n,uwlryoung,2,Tue Jul 14 00:28:42 2015 UTC,I've never really looked at Squiddy's stuff (sorry there) I'm just not really into fan-made content. But I always thought a neutral faction could benefit Scrolls. Just like neutral or color-less cards in other games as a way to make multi-resource more accessible. So instead of Wild functioning as a substitute for resources of all other factions have it the other way round with Wild scrolls being able to be played with any resource. I never talked about it because there were more pressing issues at hand but it did cross my mind every now and then. It works well for other games after all.
Scrolls,3d5x6n,Lem0nboy,3,Tue Jul 14 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'm the opposite: I absolutely adore fan content! I mean, it's always so interesting seeing the creative content that people come up with for mediums they're passionate about.  Create-a-card type endeavors are some of the best creative outputs for a TCG; my forum loves them, and we run competitions weekly :D  The thing is: your ideas on neutral resource units are a form of creative content as well! It doesn't matter if you're stealing from another game or medium; you've defined your own idea of how to expand on a game that interests you! This is fantastic, and shows how much you love the medium of the game! It's so damn amazing to see people passionate enough to do this kind of thing! :D"
Scrolls,3d5x6n,Cradstache,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be a party pooper, but there's a reason there's no 0-cost scrolls in the game. If you for example look at Gravelock Elder here http://a.scrollsguide.com/scrolls?id=1, you see the part that says """"costgrowth"":0,""costorder"":0,""costenergy"":5,""costdecay"":0""? Assuming that's what the game actually uses, there's no other value for determining which faction it'd belong to, so 0-cost scrolls would not belong to any resource (wild?)."
Scrolls,3d5x6n,fdagpigj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:33:55 2015 UTC,The 0-cost scrolls are tokens that are shuffled into your opponent's deck from one of the Chaos spells (which do have a cost).   They are indeed Wild-costed.

Scrolls,3d4uqr,Makes_Poor_Decisions,7,Mon Jul 13 19:39:35 2015 UTC,Well they did say originally that it would be done before that friday... which was like the 3rd.  So it's not a surprise that people are upset.
Scrolls,3d4uqr,ThePurplePanzy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:46:17 2015 UTC,Well the point I was making was more along the lines of the fat that people shouldn't believe developer nonsense. And that it's pretty standard for things to take far longer than expected from the scrolls team.
Scrolls,3d4uqr,Makes_Poor_Decisions,0,Mon Jul 13 21:25:25 2015 UTC,Indeed.
Scrolls,3d4uqr,ThePurplePanzy,4,Mon Jul 13 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"The only reason for this amount of delay would be that they are working out a sale. Other than that...no excuse.  Look up subnautica, kerbal space program and stranded deep just to name a few. There are stupid tiny companies that always have their consumer base in the loop be it frequent posts, trello activity or whatever. These are tiny studios with zero backing from a multi-million dollar company.  Sorry atmaz, I respect you bro but please stop.

They're an indie darling trying to be professional, but not knowing how; I love them for that, but it invokes a ton of ire from their fanbase, and perhaps rightfully so."
Scrolls,3d4uqr,Cradstache,3,Mon Jul 13 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"Let me ask one question. Where the fuck is the P.R. person? Regardless of seperate games / dev team, there needed to be a p.r. guy from mojang who worked directly with scrolls.   Yes I know mojang looks bad because of this but why do they care? They are all laughing to the bank. But here's the kicker...  Do you actually think that the gaming world will take anyone who was from mojang seriously ever again? I sure as hell hope that they invested their money properly because other than the direct minecraft devs (dinnerbone and Jeb) the rest of the company will be jobless for a while after their contracts expire.  Sorry to rant but I mean ctfo...  Bullet points just in case.   why did the game shut down? are you going to sell it? advertising???? what are the devs going to do now? will the source code be released?   There ya go...just a simple 2 sentence response to each question will suffice."
Scrolls,3d4uqr,SpiffyDrew,4,Mon Jul 13 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're asking me this: I'm not affiliated with Mojang in any way; but hey, sure, I'll bite at addressing your first three paragraphs:     Let me ask one question. Where the fuck is the P.R. person? Regardless of seperate games / dev team, there needed to be a p.r. guy from mojang who worked directly with scrolls.  There is no Scrolls PR person, although we do have an Atmaz.  I agree with you that PR is very important. I'm sure the devs agree too. Yes I know mojang looks bad because of this but why do they care? They are all laughing to the bank. But here's the kicker...  Of course Mojang cares about their games; don't be daft. You will find no company alive which holds no regard for their IPs --- oh, except maybe Konami, but that's mostly just their president being anti-gaming.  Your assertion that they don't care about the game contradicts a number of direct statement the devs have made, so I'm going to just disregard this as frustrated internet hysterics on your part. Do you actually think that the gaming world will take anyone who was from mojang seriously ever again? I sure as hell hope that they invested their money properly because other than the direct minecraft devs (dinnerbone and Jeb) the rest of the company will be jobless for a while after their contracts expire.  Do I think the gaming world (?) will take anyone from Mojang seriously again? Of course it will; it seems incredibly silly to me, to think otherwise.  In regards to the developers' hireability, the industry largely just cares about their skills and portfolio. Most developers have a number of failed games in their portfolios, many of which didn't even come close to the level of success Scrolls had. They have industry experience: they're quite hireable (although I will note there's no indicator nor reason to believe they'll need a new job anytime soon, just conjecture on your part).  And if you meant the fans (in which case, why bring up their job status?); well, that's going to be mixed. Most of us know the devs are pretty cool guys, but some people are definitely holding the decision to cancel that game against the individual developers. Thankfully, those people are a minority, and really hold any bearing on the livelihood of the devs. Sorry to rant but I mean ctfo...  Noted, and already quite chilled ;3 I'm responding to you from work, procrastinating writing up documentation atm.     As for your actual five questions...    why did the game shut down? are you going to sell it? advertising???? what are the devs going to do now? will the source code be released?   Well, those will hopefully be addressed in the FAQ that we're getting soon. Be patient-man (the slowest-to-action superhero!) :)  No worries about ranting; it happens. I just don't really understand where you got your initial three paragraphs from: to me, they seem to have materialized from that bizarro logic place that US Republican Senators get their facts from. Were they meant to be satirical?  Cheers!"

People who have other things to do. Let me just first say that the easiest thing for us would have been to not do any Q&A. I initiated this Q&A because I wanted transparency, and because we do care about the community still, even though our ability to do things will be small. We should be able to answer any question, because the Scrolls team have done their best, with the best intention, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.   This time though, some answers involve people outside of the team. For fairness, they need to see what we're writing. Hey presto, delays! More and longer delays than I anticipated for sure. Delay on the postponed 'date' as well. Things might work differently where you exist, that's fine. Where this Q&A exist, this happened. It didn't happen because of malice or neglect, but I can see that some of you are hellbent on reading that into everything since 'the announcement'. I get that. It's understandable. But, please guys, I assure you: Any team member you might interact with here, is also struggling to come to terms with what's happened, and is just as disappointed as you.  edit: paragraphs dudes"

Sorry to cause a commotion but communication is a 2 way street. If you don't want to talk at all then that's on you, but if you say it's a 2 lane road then it better be one or else there will be a head on collision.

Again, I'm making assumptions here, but people need to realize they are no longer dealing with the Mojang or Notch of old anymore.  You can't expect speedy or candid responses to delicate questions like a project's cancellation.

Scrolls,3d4uqr,WakeskaterX,2,Mon Jul 13 21:22:20 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a bit, and I could be wrong, but I'd say the biggest reason the devs have been thrown under the bus so frequently is their level of transparency. Take their announcement for instance, they titled it ''It's been a blast automaton!''... those cute little tittles are ok when you're updating the community on upcoming changes, but to do it when you're announcing the death of the game felt so disingenuous and disconnected. It's like if I went to a loved one's funeral and made a speech in a cheery happy go lucky tone... it would just be the wrong way to conduct myself. Now maybe people would have blamed them no matter how communicative they were, as it's only natural for people to want to blame someone or something for any negative emotion we feel. Hell, when I stub my toe I want to blame the object it came in contact with lol. Being fair, there are too many factors to consider to objectively blame any one party."
Scrolls,3d4uqr,Kyleofgames,4,Mon Jul 13 16:57:50 2015 UTC,Yeah communication was never their strong suit. I would not be so disappointed if they had made their intentions clear from the very beginning. But I never knew what their plan for the game was. So with my little knowledge of Mojang I had completely different expectations of where Scrolls was going and what I expected of the devs. It probably became apparent after the mediocre release that my assumptions were completely wrong but by then I was too invested in the game already and was grasping for straws.

Actually, even though it was a pun of a title for the death of a game, I'm actually glad it was this way. They are keeping their character throughout the end.

There are not enough of us left for it to matter much but we stuck with the game for so long that a little respect for the players would be cool at some point in time. I hate being so negative as I was always super positive about the devs all along and was always the first to tell Hearthstoner to shut up but this kind of stuff is really unprofessional.

Scrolls,3d4uqr,Lem0nboy,0,Mon Jul 13 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"The goal is always to get things done as soon as possible. At the same time, projects aren't done until they're done. Another goal is also to be as open and honest with the players as much as possible. Part of this process means sharing these project goals and when things are expected to be done. This is why promising specific dates to players is a double edged sword. If no date or time-frame is announced, players want to know when. If a date or time-frame is announced but is then not met, players want to know why. The why here is that this is important information, and the team is being responsible and making sure every relevant individual gets to look at it before it's posted. More individuals providing input means a longer time before it's fully prepared. Minecon interrupted a bit of its progress over last week. Mans is back in the office now, and it's a high priority for him.        a little respect for the players would be cool at some point in time        The entire reason this FAQ is being produced is out of respect for the players. It may not be finished as soon as a lot of people would like, but it's certainly not being worked on because the team doesn't care."
Scrolls,3d4uqr,Atmaz,9,Mon Jul 13 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"There is no need for lip service. It's better to not reply. The goal is not to get things done as soon as possible. The FAQ does not take weeks to do. You can do it in a few hours. Half a working day for once person. It's not like the questions are hard to collect, surely they know the answers to the questions, and then they can write them up. Anyone who's been to college knows you can write a paper in a day or two of moderate effort, nevermind an FAQ where the talking points are there in front of you.    projects aren't done until they're done.   This goes back to the lack of effort in hitting deadlines. I understand that development can have setbacks and a simple task can often take a long time and a complex task can sometimes be done very quickly but this is not a task that can have major setbacks. It's an FAQ. It does not take everyone in the company to write up. Why bother predicting when they knew Mans would be out of office to sign off on it? Either predict for when he's back or have two or three competent people put it together without him and put it out earlier.   No, man, this is not a mark of respect for the player base. It's a fucking kick. A small article is not a set of cards effort wise. Minecon can't grind the whole process to a halt so badly that nobody can write an article. Is Mojang's organisation so poor that they can't accurately predict when an FAQ will be put out? If there was somebody in charge who could run a company an accurate deadline would be set, it would be written and handed in before then and it would be signed off and released before then. No organisation, no professionalism, no respect for the player base. A real poor showing from a company I had a lot of admiration for 6 months ago."
Scrolls,3d4uqr,Raytional,7,Mon Jul 13 18:48:41 2015 UTC,Where is that super-like button?  Great point Raytional.  Something that hasn't been brought up as well and is Communication 101 - The FAQ should have been put out at the same time as the announcement.

Scrolls,3d4uqr,ThePurplePanzy,-3,Mon Jul 13 20:48:59 2015 UTC,You forget that Mojang is now under the Microsoft umbrella now. With that comes Microsoft's management and legal department which are anything but transparent.   A request for internal information about why a project was canceled? The management and legal department probably had a very good laugh at the concept before most likely choosing to ignore the request from now until the stars die.
Scrolls,3d4uqr,SimplyMonkey,-3,Mon Jul 13 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like the devs just don't care and are working on leaving mojang as we speak. They're trying to keep mojang's name clean but at this point it isn't mojang anymore. It's Minecraft, Microsoft edition.  You should have left when notch did. Fuck whatever money they gave you. You sold out in the worst ways possible. I'd be fine with it if it didn't demolition all the good will mojang had been harvesting for three years.  Mojang, your not motivated by the games you make or the people who play them. Your motivated by money and it's abundantly clear."

Scrolls,3cp8n6,Kyleofgames,6,Thu Jul 9 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"I think one of the major things that hurts this game (from the perspective of a new player) is the vast number of cards that can unpredictably turn the game in another player's favor. The game sells itself on its fun, tactical gameplay in which you try to outmanoever your opponent and get an advantage through positioning but this aspect is overshadowed by the overabundance of cooldown reduction cards and other surprise cards like necrogeddon (still basically a cooldown reduction card). These kinds of cards hurt the positioning aspect because you can never really rely on your knowledge of the board as it stands. You also have to consider the dozens of possible ways that your opponent could unexpectedly change the rules on you.   For example, you might need to move your units in to challenge your opponent's position, all of the enemy creatures have two or more countdown so you should be safe to do so...BUT you have to consider whether your opponent might have a blessing of haste, Roasted Bean Potion, Mangy Wolf, God Hand, Rallying, Bombard, Battle Dance... There are so many cards you need to consider that, on any given turn, you're often spending more time thinking about what your opponent COULD play than what s/he actually has on the field. Tactical skill is de-emphasized in favor of encyclopedic knowledge of all the scrolls in the game. You're playing more against what you think your opponent might have in his/her hand than against what you can actually see on the board.  This is ENORMOUSLY daunting for a new player. The amount of uncertainty you have about any given situation in the game is very discouraging and makes you feel like actually getting good at the game could take a very very long time. That's not the sort of feeling you want someone to start with from the second they play their first match. :/"
Scrolls,3cp8n6,NoisomePossum,3,Thu Jul 9 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"They certainly could have limited CD reduction more, but to remove it completely would require new mechanics needing to be added to counter the pure advantage a first turn would have given you. As a new player I used to hate removal much more than CD reduction and I still do to some degree. Though my noob experience was much different since nearly everyone was a noob when I was and the game was in a much different state. RBP didn't even give a CD reduction at that time. I do remember being very afraid of honorable general."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,NoisomePossum,5,Thu Jul 9 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get rid of all CD reduction either but I think the game would be better without such a huge amount of it. For example, Mangy Wolf feels ok because at least you have to commit to playing a lot of wolves if you really want to benefit from it.   The new Lynx from Echoes is also a nice mechanic since you know it's there (it's on the board already) and you can predict and even manipulate the CD reduction by deciding how many creatures you want to play. For example, if the Lynx is two rows away you can play creatures in order to bring its CD to 0 so it can't use its attack the next turn when it would be close enough to damage your units.   Gravelock Freak is another nice CD reduction mechanic that you can actually see and predict. More cards like that would have been better, in my opinion, than things like Bombard and God Hand."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,layextra99,2,Thu Jul 9 22:01:24 2015 UTC,What if every faction was limited to one or two CD reduction spells? Like growth only getting rally and order being limited to haste?
Scrolls,3cp8n6,4Robato,2,Thu Jul 9 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"Can't say I agree with this one. Any game without full knowledge (eg, cant see your opponents cards) has this unpredictable-swing possibility, mainly due to board clears and such. Yet that hasn't stopped Magic, Hearthstone, etc from daunting new players."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,NoisomePossum,3,Fri Jul 10 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Scrolls has a lot more core problem to retain players and I don't thinks it's due to imbalance. MTG is a lot more imbalance game for a new player and it has a lot more people playing it. Starter decks in MTG suck and so people enjoy the game.  Brood War was very popular but Korean scene was not that popular. Talk to anyone and it will tell you: ""Yeah! Brood War was amazing! I remember the epic turret defense!"" And not that they played competitive or anything else. Having Brood War meant a lot more than having an RPG because of the Custom Matches and here is where I wanted to come. I think Custom Matches are the most powerful thing to retain players they've added in the game but‚Ä¶ They decided that Echoes will not have a last chance.  What happened to Echoes? No new blood connected. Myself was tired of telling to my friends to connect because there's a new update I just leave it to Mojang to try to get new people in but they simply applied the Minecraft method: If the game is good people will come. We all know that this method didn't success and maybe it's too late to try to make a miracle happen.  But if I was a dev. I would try something to happen and I would make small changes that with some luck could have huge impact. This changes doesn't have to be about Wild or balance it has to be about enjoying the game and that means enjoying winning and losing. You've to be having a good time and it should be accessible for everyone so you could easily share your happiness with others. With that in mind I would:   Remove the Demo user thing. Make the game free to play. Block trading and Black Market: Make them only available to people who have spend some money in the game with shards and stuff. Make Scrolls Academy more useful for casual players: Add a section with all kinds of Custom Matches like: Spot the win, adventures, etc. Make everything in the store available with shards and all cosmetic things absurdly hard to get with only gold or just not available with gold. (You already win a tons of gold and there's no need to spend extra money in the game if you don't want to but let the people spend it if they want to.)   And now more personal things:   I would love some pressure to end up the matches quickly like: You lose 20g for each idols they destroy to you. That means that when you can end the game, you'll end the game to not lose some gold. Put the old login music back: You're open a game where you've to battle 1v1 and you've to be crushing people's precious idols so don't put a flute when you log-in, please.   This are all small changes that I would like that they just give it a try.

Scrolls,3cp8n6,4Robato,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"After listening to Atmaz talk, a lot of the problem had to deal with the conception of the game.  There are the things we know about like player retention and slow updating and not so spectacular advertisements.  The demo does not reflect the full game experience.  The business model isn't too bad... just measures for the game to be self sustaining weren't in place. They said that they didn't have the means to notify people that the expansion was out like email addresses.  They made the choice not to make the game free to play because they had a core idea in mind for a full experience in stead of a grind. Whether or not that would help the game may or may not make a difference at this point.  There are a lot of key features that could have been better. Implementation of Scrolls guide I think could have been multiple links on an in client page. I don't know if they could, but chat should have been recorded even when you were in game like some sort of clan chat in a separate tab. I think focusing players to play more with others should be emphasized.  Even the login system prevented the iOS release. The game in my opinion wasn't build optimally to scale for more players. Not many things were explained just like with minecraft... but this game isn't so simple like it.  From the beginning, I would say that Scrolls wasn't managed properly. I would even argue it wasn't given the proper attention. It doesn't mean that the devs are bad. They were scared to take risks and rightfully so. They couldn't put too much into something they had no idea would run.  By no means was the game a failure. It fell short, and to be honest, it shows that Mojang was not as experienced to begin with. I hope the devs take what they learn building a fantastic game so their other experience flourish like they deserved."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,uwlryoung,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:37:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you that it's not a single localized problem but that's why I suggest small changes so they are possible to make and if it doesn't work they doesn't lose anything.   They made the choice not to make the game free to play because they had a core idea in mind for a full experience in stead of a grind. Whether or not that would help the game may or may not make a difference at this point.   My point is trying to make the experience of gameplay equal as it is now but making all cosmetic things a revenue of money. Right now cosmetics are not even an incentive to put money in-game because you earn enough gold to buy it.  But yeah at this point I don't thing it will work tbh but I would like that they give it a try.
Scrolls,3cp8n6,4Robato,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:59:39 2015 UTC,"Put the old login music back: You're open a game where you've to battle 1v1 and you've to be crushing people's precious idols so don't put a flute when you log-in, please.   YES!!! I seriously loved that music! Although I like the new music, I really felt more in the moment and in the mood to battle with the original music! Music is a huge part of getting into the game and mood!   Make everything in the store available with shards and all cosmetic things absurdly hard to get with only gold or just not available with gold. (You already win a tons of gold and there's no need to spend extra money in the game if you don't want to but let the people spend it if they want to.)   This would ruin it for me, and I'd stop playing. One of the reasons I enjoy the game is because I don't have to grind like I hear you have to in other games. I just like paying once and doing as I please after that, as it is now."

I agree that I think the player base that hangs out in Scrolls are those that enjoy self-harm. Not literally, but fighting these awful awful decks like GO draw, MES, DG necrowatcher, etc etc is what only a broken person would do. Even just running a ""2 damage to all idols on deck cycle"" rule in the test server would have been enough for me to feel good about the issue, seeing a real response beyond some odd-ball counter scrolls, few of which get played.  Ultimately, regardless of HOW the issue is supposed to be solved, there clearly wasn't enough addictive factors to get players returning time and time again quickly. Daily trials and the whole offline experience helped a great deal in keeping people around, but the few playing ranked suffered immensely because of it. Player turnover was massive, with huge swathes of players coming in and not staying around, again because there wasn't enough to pressure them into staying. A small community saying ""hey we are pretty cool, come hang out!"" only goes so far, and then they play against a control deck or just a skilled player and quickly flee.  This has been talked to death, however. No matter how you approach it, the devs will say there were many factors involved, and any one could be true, and the players will say it was obviously X and X alone, and I'll keep humming passive-aggressively while staring at the washing up and wishing I were dead."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,Ravendil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps there weren't enough addictive factors, though they certainly could have done more, like release new scrolls every week or so to at least spark some interest."

Scrolls,3cp8n6,BerrySour,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:17 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not just advertising. Player retention has been an issue. Perhaps with advertising the game could have succeeded, but I'd make the point that if mojang actually backed this game it might have been successful.

Scrolls,3cp8n6,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"Not that your points are wrong, but the Brood War analogy isn't really applicable. Brood War had such a long life because it embraced casual players via UMS custom maps. UMS gave Brood War such an extended life because players weren't forced to be ladder players that were highly competitive, the majority of players never touched the ladder. So most players never experienced the weird mechanics of competitive play.  This is largely the reason that Wings of Liberty/Heart of The Swarm have not had the wide success that the original and BW had, it doesn't really appeal to the casual player. In a lot of ways, you missed the best comparison you could have made for Scrolls, because the problem with Scrolls is the same problems that Starcraft 2 has had, the inability to appeal to wider player-base. If you want commercial success and a large-playerbase, you have to appeal to the casual player.  Scrolls does not, and never has, appealed to the casual player. That is it's main failing, that is why it is shutting down."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"I was arguing that scrolls only appeals to a certain kind of hardcore player, the kind that accept broken mechanics and tries to work around them. The hardcore playerbase of both games are similar in that way. Brood War originally wasn't worried about being overly competitive, it wasn't until they seen an interest in the competitive aspect that they tried to balance for high level play, and much of the balance actually came from the community making maps that allowed for better games. Which also bears similarities to scrolls. Aside from hearthstone, blizzard seems to have been missing the mark for their 'newer' games."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"This game would have been far better off if balance was focused on mono resources.   This never occurred to me until recently - Atmaz also said multi-resource was not a big deal for new player retention, in his opinion. In retrospect, multi-resource received an inordinate amount of time and attention, was never implemented well, and even if it had been, would likely have not increased appeal or retention. It should have been dropped in beta, and I think the devs should have said ""this is a mono resource game, deck variety within each resource will be a design goal."" Like I said, it never even crossed my mind to suggest the team drop this ball entirely until now.    This would have allowed a simpler game for new folks, and also the ability to level up or get achievements in the resource you favor, and so on. All attractive things for new players."

Scrolls,3cp8n6,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"I would say overall the biggest issue has been mojang neglecting this game.

Too bad scrolls was never shown to those who would have really liked it, because overall scrolls is the better deal imo, since it won't cost you hundreds of dollars or weeks worth of grinding to complete your collection. It also has a higher skill cap and the gameplay is much more innovative. It's a real shame, but it is what it is."
Scrolls,3cp8n6,Sarik704,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Early Access killed it. They made it like Minecraft where the game was always ""out"" and release was just a benchmark. However Minecraft had a huge following and Scrolls didn't. So what we really saw was a game ""come out"" and then it's lifespan ended up being pretty much a year and a half and then after it was starting to fade they said ""Okay it's out but were done making updates"""
Scrolls,3cp8n6,Cradstache,0,Sun Jul 12 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"Blatantly overpowered cards > Burn (Number one by a long shot, yes I'm serious), Reloras (solid number two), Bombard (number three), focus, blessing of haste, Tempo Theft, old Puppet Nutri, Reloras, Rat King, Hired Smuggler Blatantly underpowered cards > uhm ... Vine seed bla bla? Arthri-something? Hey, I forgot the card 'Hymn' even existed Some of these cards are so unmemorable, they are truly awful. The only real rework that 'worked' was RBP, which is exactly what Order didn't need (CDR unfun mechanic). The rest of the reworks was slapping on the Replenish tag, and that certainly fixed the core issue... First turn advantage. Chess analogy is nonsense, and Im not gonna explain why (hint: Black wins when they draw, tournaments consist of multiple games). > No safe zone on the board. Each player should start with a 10-15 health 'wall' unit on their respective fifth row with Ward. This allows them to keep building up a board without getting it instant wiped. Or, simply a coin? But no, the stubborn devs absolutely don't want to learn from other games and wanted to reinvent the wheel. I'm genuinely surprised they even added mulligans. No strikeback. Only thing possible is Spiky. Good stuff, watching your big guy get stomped by a small guy with five buffs on him. Enabling draw decks > No punishment for recycling, draw scrolls unfun and overpowered. No way to come back, stupid uninteractive board clears, countdown increases, removal and die from almost empty boards.  But God forbid we have way to punish draw decks like Loatheb, right? Things like Watcher, Magic Resistance, Metal wonder etc were added way too late in the game. At that point, the game was ruined by its own toxic meta anyways. The game was worse than a deck full of archeomancers, charmbreaker devils and interrupts lol.  Unfun Mechanics > Charge coil, Hellspitter, Ether Pump, Burn, Watchergeddon, Countdown increase, Haste, too long base countdowns, all forms of inter-resource ramp, absurd card draw, token generation (this might be the worst one). Bad design and dev vision. > All ramp mechanics, Wild, Wombo combo, special shoutout to noaidi, and the ... kind person...that proposed that remake. Devs too stubborn to try new systems, only started communicating when the game was nearing its end. Game length > No explanation necessary. Games were decided by turn 4-6, but would drag on till round 20 and about 40 minutes in. On the other end, the devs enabled OTK's like corrode, God Hand and stupid necrogeddon nonsense. Total failure in insight. Simply not fun enough. Inward community, too much influence by certain individuals, downvote all the criticism, and now act surprised why 'their' game only appeals to a small group. Still downvotes 'unpopular' opinions, which is funny, since the vast popular majority voted on this game - with their feet.    ..       ..      ..

Scrolls,3cp8n6,s_pellegrino,7,Thu Jul 9 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, you're being a dick.  Second, a ton of your mechanic criticisms are really hollow.  Burn is a reason the game failed?  I don't know if you play other ccg's but OP cards happen... and Burn is not one of them.  It's incredibly valuable... but you have to have cards that are good... it doesn't break the game in any way.  Game length... games aren't 40 minutes unless you're playing with no win condition. In early beta, yes, recently?  Absolutely not.  How is watchergeddon an unfun mechanic?  It's easily one of the most hype moments in competitive play when someone gets a good one off.  Charge Coil?  No one has ever complained about this scroll.  First turn advantage is not a reason that anyone left the game.  This had been debated so many times and it was fixed by the introduction of custom games.  Heck, first turn is only really a big deal when playing aggro and some people liked having 2nd turn when playing Energy.  Strikeback.  What?  This game isn't built around that at all.  Would you want a rework of the entire game?  No one ever complains about strikeback.  It's not that kind of game."

Scrolls,3cn5tx,gabersen,5,Thu Jul 9 05:08:37 2015 UTC,I would reread all they scroll description texts. Try to focus on scrolls that were released around the same time.  Also look for cards that have other creatures in them. Mostly look for small things that connect the dots

Her attention falls upon you, backlit by the setting Dyrran sun. ""Oi, caller is ye? I gotta Excogtator with your name written allll over it, just 1,000 gold!""  You pay her no mind, and start wandering to a grouping of tables where dozens are gathered. Only four or five appear to be locked in games of battle, while the rest just sit idlely by. Some are watching, others are whispering between each other at the tables. You attempt to sit down and ask one to play with you.  ""OI! THIS HERE TABLE IS FER REAL CALLERS ONLY. NO DEMO CALLERS,"" the man barks. He stares you down until you back away a good distance.  You sit alone at the end of the tables, and review your collection of scrolls. A bunch of green wolves and dudes, but you don't understand them. You let out a deep sigh and ask out loud, to no one in particular, ""is game dead?""

Scrolls,3cn5tx,Sarik704,2,Thu Jul 9 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the main reason that hearthstone beat us was that blizzard has been in the business a long time.

Mojang just graduated last year and despite being a really low rank in their class they have a sweet band that has played a few gigs..."
Scrolls,3cn5tx,Cradstache,3,Thu Jul 9 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, yes. Comparing Mojang to Blizzard is kind of absurd.    Blizzard has been around since 1991 (~24 years in the business folks), and got started doing ports of others' titles. They had a slow build from Warcraft: Orcs and Humans onward to developing their core strengths with original titles and fleshing out company culture and strategy between their three ridiculously successful franchises. Oh, and throw in the oft-overlooked major accomplishment of forging an entirely free (as in it comes with the game) online gaming platform, Battle.net, which has stood the test of time and supported each new title with no major setbacks.    During the long ride up they've had canceled projects (Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans and Starcraft: Ghost) but most importantly they had the wherewithal to know when a project wasn't going to meet their standards for whatever reason and decide to cancel.   Mojang has been around just over five years, and has a single smash hit to their name, while the founder and key visionary for that title has left the company. The studios could not be more different, and the idea that Mojang could somehow meaningfully steal players from Hearthstone is pretty far-fetched -- which is not to say that Scrolls was fated to this early moratorium on development."
Scrolls,3cn5tx,mrgrumpyturtle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"So, as they are so different it goes to show that mojang wouldn't be in a position to make card games until they get the company straightened out.

I would love to have hundreds of Scrolls fans crowding into the arena, but that isn't reality - sorry. It was very well received at Minecon - but probably isn't for veteran players to listen to.

Scrolls,3cn2vn,Sarik704,2,Thu Jul 9 04:39:19 2015 UTC,OK so this always kinda bugged me and as a non-native speaker I want closure on this issue: What is a 3 drop?  For me it means something you play from your hand and drop it onto the board which costs 3 resources. That would mean it has to be either a creature or a structure.   It seems a lot of you refer to it all the time as simply a scroll that costs 3 resources so it could be a spell or enchantment as well.   What is the real definition of the term? Can anyone tell me?
Scrolls,3cn2vn,Lem0nboy,3,Thu Jul 9 10:53:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always refer to a ""drop"" as something that will be on the board. Not just 3 cost in general."

Scrolls,3ce4g8,Sarik704,14,Tue Jul 7 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone doesn't treat it's players fairly. Scrolls did in many ways. Players will spend hundreds of dollars on hearthstone and think its a better game than scrolls because ""it isn't wasting their time"". While a scrolls player might play the demo version of for 5 months and say that it takes to long to get cards and thus not worth their time. They might have even collected 40% of the cards in that time.  In these player's heads money isn't an issue. They just want to beat others, and complete their collection. Both of which is daunting to new players. In other words they don't get to feel as good as fast in Scrolls than in Hearthstone even though it's much more fair consumer wise to them. There aren't any Skinner Boxes, Variable Grinding, or Pay Walls that many players associate these TCG's & CCG's with. They don't feel their getting a good deal despite it being more fair.  Am I way off base in thinking this?"
Scrolls,3ce4g8,dswbg,9,Tue Jul 7 05:14:42 2015 UTC,"I really like how scrolls can be played without putting extra money on the table. The addition of the auction was house was brilliant.   I think it is more about the 'presentation' of the games. Everything in hearthsone appears to either be shaking, having particle effects or a voice actor. It's booms and splashes and yells and spins and... But imho you are right. Hearthstone is more likely to pull money from players pockets big time.  Edit: Money the devs can put back into development, commercials and maintenance."
Scrolls,3ce4g8,JeyJ24,6,Tue Jul 7 07:16:22 2015 UTC,"Fairness came with the payment model Mojang chose.  You can make a game without it being a wall of grind like hearthstone.  I won't go on about the details about the difference between models in f2p versus payment. They both have their advantages and disadvantages.  The comparison would really be for games with a similar model. You could even argue that Scrolls is a different genre than Hearthstone as well because it's more of a strategy game with a ccg elements.  What we can say is that Scrolls is indeed better in that regard of treating the players better. That should be a given when you pay up front.  What we can talk about is the factors of why Scrolls didn't fail... but for better words fell short:   The business model was not self sustaining enough Not effective measures were made to keep players   I found Atmaz in a twitch vod in another post. He said that there was some things that weren't thought about ahead of time for player retention (specifically a check box that would allow legal emailing for notifications of updates).  A hearthstone dev came on a youtubers show talking about why they didn't just outright buff old cards. One major point was that returning players would come to an environment that would be unfamiliar and maybe alienating them.... They didn't want that.  That little excerpt shows how much more experienced and planning went into hearthstone. I'm not saying that scrolls was not planned for our executed wrongly. It's just that there are a lot of little things that piled up to the game not going well.  My list of speculation is:   Mojang was very inexperienced in going into this game (resources and ideas were limited) Mojang had too few measures for the game to scale into high numbers or other platforms (the current account system prevented the iOS launch) The game felt very segregated and empty (with the chat being disabled during a game, you would return to general chat with nobody talking or no context to what was going on)"
Scrolls,3ce4g8,alvarpq,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree here, what I got from this video is that scrolls should have done better: if we look at hearthstone's progression, you get a card/2 every 2-3 games. Playing the tutorials and first few trials, you get 1 scroll/game, and some starter decks. While we can argue over which one feels like the better deal, the entry game in both hearthstone and scrolls is similar."

Yeah, out of the multitude of reasons for failure, the business model is certainly one. Though one could argue it's less of a problem with the business model itself, but rather that Mojang was trying to sell the game in a state where core parts to make the model work were missing (e.g. no demo for the longest time)."
Scrolls,3ce4g8,SmoteHisRuin,2,Tue Jul 7 13:01:25 2015 UTC,"There is some truth to the Mojang trying to sell the game in the wrong state, the core is that the business model was all wrong.  You cannot have continued, sustained developement with new content every 6 to 9 months and not have a way to take money from your players.  If you are simply relying on new players to fund sustained developement, that will not work.  That has only ever worked for one game ever and even that is coming to an end (though 20 million pc sales is impressive).

Scrolls,3ce4g8,hearthstonerxj9_x4,2,Tue Jul 7 05:06:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the reason. But I did give several complaints or suggestions that they encourage a more RNG style reward system.   The packs aren't as fun to get when you know they are ""controlled"" in a sense, because you always get 2 uncommons & 1 rare, never more & never less. When i was a kid I found it really satisfying to open YuGiOh packs, now i always compare it to a gambling addiction, that excitement stems from the random nature of the packs & the hope that any pack could have legendary cards inside.   They also ""controlled"" the rows in Judgement. They discouraged people from buying faction cards from the store, even though i understand the mark-up at double price it was just too much. All anyone bought two years ago was random packs, players couldn't choose what to spend gold on which made it sort of dull.   They did eventually get around to adding special card rewards when opening packs & winning ranked games, which is cool & reminiscent of the loot system."
Scrolls,3ce4g8,WakeskaterX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:47:42 2015 UTC,"Surprise, surprise this is something I complained about a year ago. Scrolls has little to no progression. Opening packs, playing games, buying cards, etc. does not feel like you are progressing or achieving anything. The backbone of a ccg is opening packs and seeing if you get lucky with a handful of random cards.   What does scrolls do?  At no point do you get a pack of cards as a reward. Sure you can buy one with the gold earned but that is not the same as earning a pack. Then when you buy a pack it's setup so you get x common, x uncommon, and so on which devalues it even more.   Hearthstone is effectively high grind, high reward.  Scrolls was low grind, low reward which for the purpose of attaining X made it feel like a grind. Scrolls felt like a grind because it felt like you weren't going anywhere.  Having the best of both worlds could have been achieved in scrolls if the devs weren't incompetent."

Scrolls,3cel5l,Makes_Poor_Decisions,13,Wed Jul 8 02:15:34 2015 UTC,"The Scrolls booth went exceptionally well, and it really was a joy to see people playing Scrolls for the first time on our Demo computers and having a genuinely good time. [...] our booth was always occupied with players experiencing Scrolls for the first time.  As an example: The very last day, ten minutes before the closing ceremony of MINECON, a player asked me in a pleading voice: ‚ÄúDo I have time for another Skirmish?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut you better hurry up!‚Äù He happily obliged and got right into the next game, trying to take a win off the easy AI after having a tough time against a Catapult of Goo. You could just look at him and see how fully absorbed he was in the game. There were many more like him, but he in particular will stick in my memory for quite some time. They came, they played, and they had fun.   Having fun rubbing it in? That's what I think when I read these lines. Yes the community knows there are a lot of people out there who would potentially enjoy playing Scrolls if they only knew about the game. I think it has been pointed out enough so I won't repeat it here. I just wonder why stress this point now after the devs have already made it perfectly clear that they won't try any further. It gives false hope in my opinion so I'm not sure what the reason was.   Otherwise good job on the presentation at Minecon, considering the circumstances I think you did the best you could."
Scrolls,3cel5l,Lem0nboy,7,Tue Jul 7 09:05:43 2015 UTC,"They came, they played, and they had fun.  Then we told them that the game was abandoned 6 months after release."
Scrolls,3cel5l,LargeIcedCoffee,-2,Tue Jul 7 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"My experience: Number of people who asked me or cared about future development: 0       Number of people who played the game and had fun, or watched the finals and had fun: Lots      I know being snarky is fun and cool here on reddit, but everyone I saw involved in the Scrolls activities had fun at Minecon. Let's put down the wet blankets for a bit, okay?"
Scrolls,3cel5l,Atmaz,8,Tue Jul 7 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"Null arguement.  The issue people are having is you show the fun and then say ""no more fun for you"".  Yes there is a year left but knowing the ending spoils the story and puts a wet blanket on the fun, to use your anology.  I think it also perfectly sums up why Hearthstoner says devs suck and why lots of people are disappointed as they go through the five stages of grief - this game was built for short term fun and with short-sightedness and not with long-term sustainability in mind.  The dangers of having so much money in the bank that you dont' have to worry about making it a financial success.  Until you do.  Then you pull the plug because you've had fun and now you're not because the real-world implications of making a financial profit and keeping your core players engaged becomes work instead of fun."
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,-6,Tue Jul 7 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"The issue people are having is you show the fun and then say ""no more fun for you"".        I don't really follow, here. The servers will be up until July of 2016. Nothing has been taken away."
Scrolls,3cel5l,Atmaz,8,Tue Jul 7 17:46:36 2015 UTC,He literally elaborated on that response of yours right after the quote you did from him. I am sorry Atmaz but this was a rather weak reply.
Scrolls,3cel5l,ToGoodLooking,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"This would make sense if the players who enjoyed the game at Minecon were upset. They weren't. I understand that many players are upset that an alternate future was ""taken"" away, but we - or maybe just I - am talking specifically about the Minecon experience. ""No more fun for you"" is not what happened at all there - and I can't see how anyone could make that argument without being there. Cheers!"
Scrolls,3cel5l,Atmaz,5,Wed Jul 8 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Of course they weren't upset, they had no idea you were showing a game whose date-of-death is known and has been announced!  They were obilivous and in that state the game IS still fun.  The reaction is that it appears you are going about like all is well, nothing is wrong or has been announced and proceeding as normal.  Lets demo, show how fun it is, give away codes, create a ""welcome to scrolls"" video and move forward like nothing has changed.  This feels very much like the blinders that have been on with other issues (like retention) and your working at evangelizing this game when its death date is known.  It feels wrong."
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,0,Wed Jul 8 01:27:20 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks for your thoughts :)
Scrolls,3cel5l,Atmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:28:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for listening and replying :)
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,5,Wed Jul 8 02:11:12 2015 UTC,No more features.  No more expansions.  No more content AND you give them the day Scrolls is going to die.  Not sure what you don't understand about that.
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,-3,Tue Jul 7 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"so? there will be balance patches if needed, and we played without new content before echoes for nearly a year, now echoes is still very new and people stopped playing because of this announcement. thats what i dont get"
Scrolls,3cel5l,ultioptimo,7,Tue Jul 7 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"They played for nearly a year because new content was going to be 3 months, then 6 months then 9 months.  We had hope.  There is no hope now as the death is announced and TCG games need new content.  There is nothing to hold out for as it is finished so why play a game with no future?"
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,-5,Tue Jul 7 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure where do you get those numbers and dates from? i cant recall any dates set by the devs on when they release echoes or other new stuff... if you did not enjoy it before and kept playing because you hoped for new content, thats weird but ok, your decision. if not and you enjoyed playing before that announcement, then it is still enjoyable now, because it is still the same game, only with a big amount of new content on live server only a couple weeks old and you can enjoy that for the next year."
Scrolls,3cel5l,ultioptimo,8,Tue Jul 7 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"They started planning set 7 July 26th, 2014... if you were on irc channel you would see the full history of when the set came, the expectations and then the delays.  There has been no committed timelines communicated - part of the problem that has been pushed for - but all communications about dates and plans were shared - publically available.  You also missed the point.  People played because there was a future.  There was more content coming, there were more changes, there were features added.  They didn't play because they hoped for new content, they played because they understood the current meta and framework around that would be for a shorter season as new content was coming and there was something to hold on to.  The meta gets stale awefully quick in current digital tcg/ccg (check out hs for how much new content is asked for and how quickly the standard decks become baseline).  The understanding that the devs were continuing to work and improve and add to the game is a big psyhcological component of buying into the game.  When that is announced, and the death, people are naturally going to have problems and have to get that out of their system like I clearly am doing today.  The FAQ is something that provides insight into ""behind the scenes"" and based on dev/player open relationships in the past is something really good.  It is frustrating as along with a very long list of other things, it is something they said they want to / would do and now it is delayed.  Again.  And again.  And again.  At least bring and give us solid closure on the death of this game instead of more delays and more ""oh the kids really like it, isn't this neat, validate me and my existance""."
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,8,Tue Jul 7 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"Chief ive talked about this topic with you before but i feel i have to reply here as well.  Not everyone is like you, not everyone enjoy the game for same reason as you, many enjoyed the game as long there was a future for it, i am not going to go all indepth regarding psychology but knowing the date when its over and nothing major will be added change the perspective many have on the game.  It is similar as when your doctor says you got 1 more year to live, nothing has changed since yesterday but this gives a completely new perspective to how you will approach life.  The difference of course is that this is a game and not life, in life you often decide to make the most of your time and live life to its fullest.  In a game you often have allready done everything there is to do, hence why you look forward what there is to come in the future, when there is no future well then there will never be anything new to do. If you have not done judgement or whatever then sure its fully possible you decide to test that before quitting, but otherwise most people decide to just switch game and move on to new exciting things.  I respect those who still enjoy the game for what it is and dont mind it wont be changed, i think you are in the few but there is nothing wrong with that, and i am happy you still find the game entertaining and want to play until the very end.  But when you say stuff like ""if you did not enjoy it before and kept playing because you hoped for new content, thats weird but ok, your decision."" so do i feel you are showcasing a lack of ability to put yourself in other peoples perspective.  Anyway i have not replied to you before this because i could not be arsed, but i keep see your pop up comments on all sort of threads with these kind of arguments with ""how has anything changed? if you enjoyed yesterday then why not enjoy today?"" and it is getting a bit tiresome so i felt to give my own input as to why."
Scrolls,3cel5l,ToGoodLooking,5,Tue Jul 7 23:45:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I enjoy this game.  I do not enjoy playing the same people all the time, being matched against people that are far below my rating all the time, and sitting in queue for 15+ minutes all the time.  I stayed on with the hope that the team will do something to bring players in, whether it be F2P steam release, fixing wild, whatever.  The announcement pretty much said, ""this game will never have a player base again.""   So that's why I stopped playing."
Scrolls,3cel5l,LargeIcedCoffee,6,Tue Jul 7 21:23:52 2015 UTC,This man is consistently spot on with his assessments.
Scrolls,3cel5l,knight_obvious,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:36:03 2015 UTC,"Having fun rubbing it in?        Wow. Cynicism overwhelming. I don't know how sharing a story about how a child enjoyed playing Scrolls is rubbing anything in. It's happened a thousand times before, but I had never seen it in real life. He didn't care or ask about the future plan for game development. He played the game and had fun. It's possible to do that still, you know."
Scrolls,3cel5l,Atmaz,7,Tue Jul 7 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Wow. Cynicism overwhelming.   I won't deny that but you know, I wasn't always like that. I was totally behind the dev team and their decisions in the beginning but as time went by I came to question a lot of stuff and I'm still awaiting their answers on a lot of things.  I'm not saying you did that on purpose of course, just that's how it feels to me at this point so perhaps try to be a bit more sensitive next time? ;) I can understand that experiencing this firsthand and especially without all the drama from reddit can be exciting and you want to share it but it just doesn't make sense to me. You present it like some great discovery when the community has been talking about this issue all the time. When the devs decided it makes no sense to pursue these potential customers any further. And now you tell us there are still people out there who'd enjoy the game? Duh.  This is nothing against you personally /u/Atmaz and I appreciate the work you put in to make Scrolls possible at Minecon."
Scrolls,3cel5l,Lem0nboy,2,Tue Jul 7 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"so perhaps try to be a bit more sensitive next time? ;)       Ah, okay. Ya, I know a lot of people are upset. All I can say is just try and enjoy the game while we still have it. :) We did it at Minecon, and it went well."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,flameragee,5,Tue Jul 7 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"Been laying down some card game theory as well, it's interesting to see what other people come up with.   Now for the feedback:   As others have already said, the ressource system might be a little too much. Three ressources per card is going to confuse people.  And what do you need them for? They should be here to accomplish specific tasks.  From here, it look like ""influence"" and ""threshlod"" have the exact same functions, arbitrarily separated for some reasons. (What kind of user interface would the player have to manage its ressources?)  Furthermore, the point of this system is to allow for easy multicolor decks. Are those part of the plan? How much of a mess would it be to have multiple ""influence"" and ""threshlod"" values on screen? What becomes of the starting heroes of a multicolor deck?  I'm not a super fan or faeria's coins (mana, for all intent and purposes) system. But that's me. Are you still following them and do you know if their ressource system is still the same? Fixed mana regeneration per turn might annoy people, and the ability to store it might lead to some weird things. And in faeria, you had to choose between coins and influence (lands).  You also said nothing about limits. One of Scrolls problem and reason for its long games was its lack of those. No hand limit, no maximum mana limit, no deck cycle limit, etc... (that and the units' cooldown mechanics.) Limits are important I think.  Your units have a move stats but no range one. Are they all melee units?   I'd love to know more about the context, your factions' lore, races, history, etc... A cool part of scrolls is how they managed to give a fresh look to the classical card game gameplay archetypes.  Hoping this was somehow useful. Have a good day. :)"
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Goklayeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:52:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback. I was thinking that the hand limit should be 7. And maybe I should replace influence and threshold with just a faction symbol to make only mono-faction decks. I am also thinking that ranged attack should be a keyword, but do you think they should be able to attack anywhere or within 3 or 4 spaces. Also the maximum limit of a deck is 40 and should not cycle in my game. If you run out of cards in this game. Then should the player commander lose life over time or should the player commander lose the game immediately if they run out of cards. Hope you like these suggestions I added. :)  Also I think the game Faeria have remove their coin system from the game, meaning that you only have to pay lands and faeria to play creatures and spells."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,3,Wed Jul 8 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"I don't quite get threshold, and I typically understand things great; is it the resource pools, or the cost on a card, or the amount of cards from a faction you can play per turn? Plz help!"
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Sarik704,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:13:17 2015 UTC,It's the resources pools.
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Namington,4,Tue Jul 7 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Way to complex and incoherent. No offense, I just thought that scrolls died because it was too hard on beginners. This would be hell for them."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,3,Tue Jul 7 04:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my main concern with this idea. I actually like a few of the basic concepts, and feel like there's room for depth and strategy here, but I also think that there are some areas that are too complex or overwhelming - most notably, the economy and the victory systems.  The victory system is, in my opinion, not that major, but it's still kind of confusing. Now, I get that you'd begin to understand it after a few games, but even then, the whole ""different victory choices for different factions"" makes the game more asymmetrical, more matchup-based, and more complicated for new players to understand the strategies. Perhaps making the present ""second victory"" mechanic just give significant bonuses (+1 attack across the board or something) rather that straight-out victory would be better - saying ""you win the game if this happens"" has quite a weight to it, and the fact that you're supposed to be playing to either this secondary victory or the regular victory while also preventing your opponent from achieving any of them is quite a lot to handle and get intimidated by.  Second is the economy. There's a reason Scrolls never adopted the threshold system, despite many prominent players wanting to at least try it out (besides the slight stubbornness of the devs) - it's already a complex system. Not only does your variant have a MTG-style with the income (coins)-threshold interactions, which is fine (if a bit confusing), but it also has an ""influence"" system which is meant to both interact and counteract the threshold system. I don't know if it's just the presentation or just me, but I'm not sure if I totally understand the way it works after re-reading it a few times.  I think a few ideas presented here are solid, but there are definitely issues with complexity and player understanding, as well as there just being a lot to manage (MTG has a complex threshold system and tapping system, but it makes up for it in that... there isn't too much complexity besides that (units don't even keep their damage taken beyond the end of the turn); ""Hallazan"" has a more complex version of this threshold system, as well as unique card effects, positioning, tactics, move values, alternate victories...). It's just too much for new players to get into, even moreso than Scrolls."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe i shouldn't add spells that can add in a secondary victory condition. Also What should i replace the economy system with?"
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Sarik704,2,Tue Jul 7 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe add some Prismata, having your units give you more coins per turn. This may also work for influence, like 'current' resources. Also, you could give gold across the factions, like Clandestine units sometimes giving 1 for each opponent unit destroyed."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Sarik704,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"That is a awesome idea. I might give that ability to ""Industry"" or some of the neutral units."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,Sarik704,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:18 2015 UTC,Prismata is pretty boss. You could also have them sacrifice attack for gold.
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are definitely right. So how do i shorten it and make it easier for new players?"
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:04 2015 UTC,"This won't be an answer anyone will like, but you need to break this idea. What do I mean? It's to focused on being fair that the game stops being fun. Why does magic work? Some decks are just better than others. Why does Call of Duty work? Some guns are just better than others. If a game doesn't have a clear and relatively normal path of progression it will be dropped."
Scrolls,3cdzm6,LordPhyriX,2,Tue Jul 7 05:03:36 2015 UTC,So some factions need to be better than other factions?
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,10,Mon Jul 6 15:13:22 2015 UTC,Because this was a hobby.  There's really no better way to put it.
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I just think they were inexperienced in key areas of development and production. It seems to me that the scrolls dev team has never had a production manager. It was sorely missed is my opinion. Is it a hobby? Not really. Was their job done well? Again, not really."
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,6,Mon Jul 6 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"I say hobby because many decisions were made with the motivation of working on a fun project than actually making a successful game.  As evidenced by abandoning the game 6 months after release.  I'm pretty sure most the devs were simply done by this point.    From team size, to marketing, to distribution, to time spent away from development... this was a pet project for Mojang."
Scrolls,3cb57b,knight_obvious,3,Mon Jul 6 20:50:07 2015 UTC,I think this is very very accurate.  It was a pet project for mojang but the dev teams gave it their all as it was their passion. The two prioritys did not align and one had to give.
Scrolls,3cb57b,Toastbrott,2,Mon Jul 6 23:58:42 2015 UTC,"I dont think they ever had a real drive to get the game a succes, they all were paid by microsoft only to stay one more year after the buy out and even before that time mojang only consisted out of minecraft."
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,2,Mon Jul 6 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"That seems not only subjective but also without evidence. They as a team of less than 10 people made a really good game. There issue wasn't with development, but with production. To say that a team doesn't have ""drive"" or other intangentials seems really lazy."
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,4,Mon Jul 6 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"You can have ""drive"" when working on a hobby.  But a hobby is something done for the enjoyment of the individual, not for the good of the consumer."
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,0,Mon Jul 6 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"When your being paid for something it's a job regardless of enjoyment. Drive isn't a qualitative or quantitative ""thing"". It's an abstract concept that is entirely subjective."
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,3,Mon Jul 6 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm not trying to make any kind of deeper statement on the definitions of the words.  I'm more making the distinction that the choices made in development were based on the interests of the individuals, not the success of the game."
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,0,Mon Jul 6 21:36:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm trying to say that isn't what happened. And, that your argument is valid, but without real object evidence."
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,3,Mon Jul 6 21:50:40 2015 UTC,"The evidence is small team, the lack of marketing, the long vacations, the unwillingness to distribute on steam, the questionable comments before the community managers cleaned up...  There were a lot of things that suggested the focus was not to make money and make this game a success.  Some of that is okay, some of it is sad."
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,0,Mon Jul 6 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"Your evidence is subjective. You have no idea what other marketing strategies were tried. How long their vacations were, how ""unwilling"" the devs were to distribute on steam. The small team is valid, but does not correlate to whether or not this is a hobby or job. The ""questionable-ness"" of the comments are in themselves debatable but I will take your insubstantial word for it. Even if all this evidence was backed up with more than just your claims it doesn't necessarily suggest the focus of the game one way or another.  We only know so much of the full situation at Mojang so let us not go and make assumptions about peoples livelihoods, okay?"
Scrolls,3cb57b,Toastbrott,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"With ""they"" I ment Mojang rather than the devs."
Scrolls,3cb57b,Sarik704,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:26:54 2015 UTC,You mean the devs that work at Mojang? Who are paid by mojang to make the game a success?
Scrolls,3cb57b,MAWL_SC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:30:33 2015 UTC,The devs absolutely were devoted to this game. You are wrong sir.
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:09:54 2015 UTC,Abandoning a game 6 months after release isn't exactly the best example of devotion.
Scrolls,3cb57b,MAWL_SC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"While Mojang choices may be in question, and perhaps the game was DOA as atmaz has suggested, the devs have been devoted to improving the game without a doubt. Scrolls has most likely been a running at a huge loss for a long time, the fact that they even bothered to release echoes shows that they are devoted to the players."
Scrolls,3cb57b,ThePurplePanzy,5,Mon Jul 6 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"Look, I was willing to defend the devs for a long time.  I honestly thought it was an upper management decision to pull the plug, and I was fine with that.  But the moment it came out that it was the team's decision, I honestly lost a lot of the respect I had.  There is just way too much evidence that displays a lack of devotion.  And I like the guys, I just, again, think  it was a hobby."

Scrolls,3cb57b,erwan,9,Tue Jul 7 05:18:37 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of advantages of having a small team, not limited to reduced cost (hence the bar to success is lower). A smaller team is more agile, needs less overhead, can innovate more easily...  Mojang was hugely successful with Minecraft, an indie game with a small team. You can't really expect an indie studio to suddenly turn into a corporate behemoth.  Finally, today there are many CCG video games so it appears as a ""mature"" market where polish is more important than innovation, but when Scrolls was released there wasn't that many CCG video games. Hearthstone was released about one later after Scrolls, for example.  We can discuss why scrolls failed and hearthstone succeeded, but that's a bit more complex than ""because they didn't do what I told them to do"".  tl;dr: they could have failed just the same with a bigger team. It would have been a bigger failure, because they would have spent much more money."
Scrolls,3cb57b,monkyyy,2,Mon Jul 6 15:50:15 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts. I agree with really all your points - if I had to speculate on what happened and the studio's viewpoint on it, this would be what I'd guess.    Just to be clear, I'm certainly not saying ""they did not succeed because they didn't do what I told them to"" - rather I'm curious on their rationale or their sentiments on the small team approach."

Scrolls,3cb57b,rupk,5,Mon Jul 6 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"You'll never get a straight answer from them. It's pretty clear they were misleading the playerbase in many ways up until the abandonment announcement. Promised ipad release, promised marketing, promised they could have had more devs if they wanted them and I'm sure there's much more I can't remember right now. I don't believe they were very truthful with us from the start which is a shame, but so many people bought in and despised any detractors that called them out on their BS so that's why companys and devs will continue to lie and mislead their fanbases."

Scrolls,3cbvo3,4Robato,2,Mon Jul 6 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"I looked into this when I first began playing Scrolls. More specifically, we talked about creating a backstory or promotional custom map using vanilla Minecraft mechanics.  The project didn't get any traction...mostly because the people I work with didn't enjoy Scrolls nearly as much as I did. Recreating Scrolls within Minecraft wouldn't be the most difficult project, considering what is possible with the front-end scripting language.  The biggest problem comes from creating the 3D assets, textures, and models...and finding someone who is passionate enough about this game and who is skilled enough with command blocks to create a playable version of this game within Minecraft.  It's possible, just not entirely feasible.  Also, the UI system in default Minecraft doesn't quite lend itself nearly well enough to effectively communicate ideas within Scrolls."

Scrolls,3c927e,KingMoonfish,7,Mon Jul 6 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"The time games take has come down a lot from that first video, unfortunately it's a stigma the game cannot shake.  You can easily choose an aggressive deck too that brings game time down more.  Most of my ranked games seem to be around 10-20 minutes.  Not sure about the trading misconception, as far as I recall player trading has always been in the game, the Black Market too now means I can sell scrolls to players when I'm offline."
Scrolls,3c927e,rusticdog_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:06:16 2015 UTC,I didn't know that - I thought it was similar to Hearthstone where you couldn't trade. Sorry about that. :O
Scrolls,3c927e,rusticdog_,4,Mon Jul 6 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"No need for the apology. Your post highlights one of the issues Mojang had with Scrolls, and that's reaching out to people who know about Scrolls but not much, or those who tried it and didn't like some of the early aspects of the game that have since been corrected."
Scrolls,3c927e,ThePurplePanzy,5,Mon Jul 6 05:00:16 2015 UTC,This problem was honestly mostly addressed.  Games simply don't take as long as they did during early beta.  It isn't board wipe after board wipe anymore.
Scrolls,3c927e,asraniel,2,Mon Jul 6 02:57:55 2015 UTC,"that is said a lot, but still, games are too long. It was never really accepted like that. The reason is that only people that like long games kept playing and gave their opinion. People that don't like long games stopped playing, thats why there was that biased opinion in the community. Everytime somebody comes here, like that poster, he gets told thats its not true. But sadly it is true, especially compared to hearthstone, which lets face it, is the reference in that type of games now."
Scrolls,3c927e,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:12:15 2015 UTC,"The poster in question played during early beta though.  I really don't remember this being a complaint of recent players.  Yes, it's still longer than HS... but that's just too short to chase after."
Scrolls,3c927e,ToGoodLooking,3,Mon Jul 6 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"The devs as well as the players has been fully aware of the issue, altough the 50min is quite a exaggeration, for veterans a avarage game take perhaps 15min, and for newcomers who struggle to close out the game so is it more around 30min.  But that is beside the point, many people still feel the game can be a drag yes, and there has been countless discussions and debates how to handle it.  There is no point to it now but thank you anyway."
Scrolls,3c927e,ToGoodLooking,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure a game's length should be determined by how good a player is - in the inevitable comparison Hearthstone is almost always 10 minutes or less, with the rare exception now and then, regardless of player skill.  Maybe that's the problem - if new players take so long to complete a game - they stop playing and move on to other things before learning the game completely."
Scrolls,3c927e,Sarik704,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"Never said it was a good thing that there is a clear difference in time gap between veterans and newcomers, that is of course not ideal.  The minor point were just that its not the first time people give feedback on that games are to long, it has been said several times over the years and worked on. But many outside sources do paint as if its normal for a game to take 50min, and i just felt to point out that is not the case, its rather uncommon for a match to take that long.  But as i allready said in my previus reply so do that not nullify the described issue, with games dragging on and which is not something new people enjoy, i merely corrected the time span."
Scrolls,3c927e,SethBorder,3,Mon Jul 6 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"Some things. The cost went down to five bucks, but many of us wanted free to play. You can trade and to my knowledge always have been able too. Totalbiscuit played around 20 matches if I recall. Recently matches take no where near that amount unless your still learning. I understand it's still a high barrier.  In addition to trading there is also a ""black market"" in game store run by the players. Thanks for sympathizing with us (no sarcasm, it means a lot). It's just a little too late."
Scrolls,3c927e,ScrollsMeUp,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"My view on this has always been that yeah, it's long for a card game - but Scrolls isn't really a card game.  The game times are perfectly reasonable for a game of chess, and that's what Scrolls reminds me a lot more of."
Scrolls,3c927e,Katter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"I like the long matches.  But I would prefer the rewards be more substantial.  Scrolls is a more cerebral, less casual game, and I really appreciate that.  It helped set it apart.  But I think you need to reward that investment more readily, more impactfully, in order to make the time investment worth it for some, particularly the more casual player seeking to get as many scrolls as fast as possible so they can create their fun, custom decks."

Scrolls,3c2hqz,hearthstonerxj9_x4,3,Sat Jul 4 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to think anymore. I was following a bit of the Minecon stream from Mojang today, because it was promoted on Twitch and I was kinda curious to see how bad Mojang is at this kind of stuff. But then I was totally surprised to see a very professional stream just like you'd expect from a reputable company.  They even had 3 separate streams covering different areas of the convention. One was showing the main stage were I suppose the tournament was shown? However the stream from the main stage went offline an hour before Atmaz started commentating the semi-finals on stage. There were no other events scheduled for the main stage that day. Why would they not continue to use this stream to show the tournament?  Again I was surprised to see how professional Mojang was handling Minecon, so now I cannot stop to think they deliberately did not want Scrolls to succeed."
Scrolls,3c2hqz,Lem0nboy,4,Sat Jul 4 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think there are some misunderstandings here. The ""main stage"" area is definitely not where we are hosting the Scrolls tournament. That stage is reserved for big things like the opening ceremony and the circus performers last night who were flying around the air shooting fire everywhere and generally being very dangerous. While I would love to have seen one of them dressed up like Top Reaver Thea - these events are almost certainly Minecraft focused. We are in what is called the ""tournament zone."" It's a cool little area with a smaller seating area where Minecraft events like ""Hunger Games"" are being presented. We share this stage for our events, of which there will be one more today. None of these events - Minecraft or Scrolls, are being streamed. The games are presented in a very very basic manner to an audience who, for the most part, has NEVER seen Scrolls before. We were able to stream some of the finals games because Blinky and I have a connection at our booth. We boasted 50-60 viewers there. There are ten thousand people at this convention. Math. There is another streaming area set aside with couches for interviews and what-not. It is at the other end of the hall and to be honest I have not had any time to go and see what's going on there. Today may be the first time I have to actually walk around. I will work hard today to get the tournament zone videos up asap. I have to get the recordings from one of the event organizers."

Scrolls,3c2hqz,Lem0nboy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"mojang(not the scrolls dev team)   Yeah exactly, that's what I meant. :) Funny story from the stream: There was a panel and a kid was asking Mojang employees something along these lines: ""Now that Mojang has ventured forth into another genre of video games can we expect another game after that? What are your plans for the future and what genres can we expect to see next?""  I was certain he was talking about what comes after Scrolls....turns out they were talking about a Minecraft Telltale game. In his answer the Mojang guy was talking about an upcoming Minecraft movie then...they are so focused on Minecraft I'm pretty sure not even all of the Mojang employees know about Scrolls. :P"
Scrolls,3c2hqz,Psychobeans,3,Sat Jul 4 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"There are over ten thousand people at this convention. Streaming would be nice, but the Minecraft events being held here in the 'tournament stage' area not streamed either. The event is targeted at communicating Scrolls at a very basic level.

Scrolls,3c15em,oslohung,14,Fri Jul 3 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Well, based on Carnalizer's post in which he stated this was Mojang's decision and they didn't ask for any assistance from microsoft... it looks like Mojang is not the team to turn to if we want to keep this game alive (duh).  They gave up on Scrolls and its community, and refused to take the necessary steps to make this game a success because it was too difficult or too risky or the team was too small or whatever else you can call it.    I can only see hope if a solid indie developer for whatever reason buys this game and keeps it alive, makes it free to play and puts it on steam... you know, the usual.  Some team that has people who are familiar in playing or designing TCGs.  There's probably a better chance that harry potter is real.  I'm just too tired of being disappointed in Scrolls to be let down again when nothing happens."

Scrolls,3c15em,Newbore,5,Fri Jul 3 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"This is our game, people. We HAVE TO fight for it.  They gave up on Scrolls and its community, and refused to take the necessary steps to make this game a success   I think this mindset is not a very good one, everyone has it right now, while it's nice that people show they care it is also creating a lot of negativity. It isn't true either. This is Mojang's game, they built it & made it as great as possible so we would enjoy playing it. It is our privilege to play & not our right. We did buy it, & they went beyond honoring our purchases, it was a great deal as far as I am concerned.  I didn't expect to see Scrolls stop so suddenly, but I certainly knew development would stop sooner or later. Every large patch i wondered if the next set might be the last. If they didn't announce its closing, what do you think the game would be like in 6 months time? I think it would have run out of players & been forced to close anyway...   So I say, play the game if you enjoy it (not for some ""great cause""), get your friends to play it if you want. If you are desperate enough then try to advertise the game in the hopes of a comeback. Ask the developers if they are willing to do certain things in the coming months. But please respect the fact that this is Mojang's game, if they think their decisions or circumstances made the game they spent years building into something unsustainable, then let them close it over the coming year with dignity.   Despite what everyone says, the Scrolls team did what they could for the game. They analysed each decision, they considered how much time it would take & whether they could afford it, they balanced many things that we never even imagined taking into consideration. Maybe they did make a lot of mistakes, but so many of these arguments i keep seeing are beyond words. Everyone is here because they enjoy the game, so many players are thinking ""they were too dumb & didn't care enough to make a good game, i know that because they didn't do what I told them to do, if they did then Scrolls wouldn't be shutting down"" which is just really immature to be honest.   As Atmaz said, the developers have been taking it hard, & a lot of people have been incredibly rude to them. What happened to the great community we prided ourselves in being, if it is really so easy for us to become a shit-throwing mob then maybe we were never that great after all."

I don't blame them for anything because i don't have any insight on the business side of things.   As for the shit-throwing mob: lots of people are sad and angry. I get that. I made this post to try and turn that sadness and anger into something positive. As I said - i believe this game has no future.

Scrolls,3byz95,SekusoTrez,6,Fri Jul 3 08:24:00 2015 UTC,"Card Hunter is an absolutely delightful game with some fantastic mechanics. The single player is fun and engaging with a metahumorist's storyline and some really weird and awesome mechanics thrown about throughout, particularly when you hit the ""beholder, but with tongues, not eyes!"".  The three weaknesses to the property are as follows.   A glacial update schedule. When the player-created content was first announced well over a year ago, they spoke of the joys of releasing a small series of the stuff every month. To date, we have five. This carries through most of the rest of Card Hunter. It's making enough money to stay afloat, but their plans have been tempered again and again rather than burn through the money. At this point, nearly a year to make six adventures of content (as opposed to the 50 or so of the original release), I really do expect that the devs have picked up jobs and do this on the side. Cards that roll dice for double the RNG! The collectable, nigh-impossible-to-pay-to-win nature of the game sets forth a time wall for multiplayer. The core community also means you'll get your face smashed in just like a newbie in Scrolls. Very hard to stick when you try playing it."
Scrolls,3byz95,InterjectionGames,5,Fri Jul 3 13:03:25 2015 UTC,"Isn't it astonishing that Scrolls is by far the most involved, polished and comprehensive CCG/Strategy that exists and it never even got to be on Steam?  It boggles my mind to see such bizarre incompetence."

Scrolls,3byz95,Bleachi,2,Fri Jul 3 13:34:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It was a truly great campaign, and it was actually pretty damn funny. But as you went along, you would constantly get harassed to pay real money. The worst example was the rewards screen. Oh, you would still get your rewards, but the best one there would get locked behind a paywall. Every time.  Once you step into multiplayer, you'll get crushed. And you'll feel nothing but regret for refusing to buy all those cards.  Still a great campaign, though. Everyone should give it a try. Last I checked, you could play most of the campaign for free in your browser. Just stay away from the clones, which are mostly on phones."

Scrolls,3byz95,InterjectionGames,2,Fri Jul 3 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's a game to play for a few days, then wander off. The PvP is... lacking, and when they make 6 new levels every 9 months, it's about as much of a joke as HEX PvE."
Scrolls,3byz95,Lem0nboy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the gameplay and I would totally give HEX a chance if it wasn't for that initial paywall. I'm pretty sure after you've learned the game it is a lot of fun to do drafts and you will be able to get your investment back in no time but as a new player with zero draft experience I'm not willing to risk my money at all. I wouldn't mind paying 20 bucks in total such as with Scrolls, but with HEX there is no guarantee how much you will have to spend until you finally reach that point where you can play without paying additional money. Especially since the community seems to be just as small and hardcore as with Scrolls. So I rather not even start."

Nobody likes to play against netdecks when they don't have the resources to make one.  I wouldn't worry about it, really. Scrolls had a number of good ideas, but they were mired in so many bad ideas that refused to change that it really did have to die.  Consider!  The Good  *Low RNG gameplay with a wonderful card sacrifice mechanic. *The 5x3 board was a delight. *Loved the animations  The Bad  *Wild design was awkward. *Cards that fed permanent resource gains had to be highly restricted, because too many of them allows a deck to rush past the design constraints of the game. This meant that people had few options, for there could only be a few cards that had that effect. This feeds into: *Entire deck archetypes were propped up by one or two cards, or were forced into certain cards because of the restrictive design above. Given the nature of the restrictive design, the resulting netdecks really couldn't shift much. You needed these features, and since those features are restricted, your deck support must include 10 of these 12 cards."

However; knowing there'll be an underground future for Scrolls could not only keep the current population, but might even entice some folks that just heard about the game through the recent developments."
Scrolls,3bv17l,gXxshock,8,Thu Jul 2 11:49:47 2015 UTC,The chance of Mojang releasing the code is slim to none.

It's probably a good thing though as it levels the playing field and gives new players a chance to fit in, provided that everyone gets access at the same time.  I am very skeptical about anything led by a community however. I fear everyone will want to have a say and the game will gradually become something completely different, splitting the community along its way. If your plan works out somehow I'd prefer a strict top-down hierarchy management to avoid this issue. Ideally I'd like another company to continue Scrolls however."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Tesserach,6,Thu Jul 2 12:16:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen a small group of community members split up into well-defined teams work well for a game with a similar fate (Dawngate).

Scrolls,3bv17l,pianobadger,6,Thu Jul 2 12:41:20 2015 UTC,We can hook it up to the scrollsguide database which is fairly up to date. That would mean you won't have to start from scratch.
Scrolls,3bv17l,wbmc,5,Thu Jul 2 15:02:34 2015 UTC,I think on a community server everyone should just be given all the scrolls. Just scratch the collecting part of the game.

Scrolls,3bv17l,wbmc,9,Thu Jul 2 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"I did have fun collecting the cards, however, I wouldn't want to do it again from scratch on a fan server. Most of the people populating it would probably be experienced players, so it seems unnecessary to have them go through that again.   Additionally if there is one community server, there will likely be more than one. It would be nice to be able to play on another server and not feel like you're locked into this one because that's where all of your cards are. Different servers would probably have different fan made cards added or different balance adjustments so it would be fun to try out more people's changes to the game without starting from scratch each time.  For new players, it's already tough joining a community of experienced players in a complicated strategy game. Why make it more difficult by also making them take months collecting cards to get on a level playing field? It's making it so fewer new players will want to join when the community is already small and player retention is a problem for the game."
Scrolls,3bv17l,pianobadger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true. Also, with the current size of our community I really hope we all end up agreeing on one solution instead of spreading out over all kinds of projects."

Scrolls,3bv17l,Riveted321,4,Thu Jul 2 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is different from one individual to another. Personally, my favorite part of a CCG is building new decks and trying new things out. Not having all the cards is (for me) a frustrating roadblock to that end. One of the things that originally enticed me about Scrolls was the fact that the card pool is sufficiently low that getting a full playset doesn't require that great of an effort compared to other online card games. I've tried other online card games in the past but the huge amount of time that you need to invest to get a full set (without spending a fortune) is the main reason I've never stuck around for any of those games for longer than a couple of months."

Scrolls,3bv17l,TheEarlGreyT,2,Thu Jul 2 18:49:12 2015 UTC,Rankings and achievements would still be objectives.
Scrolls,3bv17l,LiquidSilver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe people who donate get an amount of gold? Or Even Shards, But preferably gold."
Scrolls,3bv17l,kopasz7,3,Fri Jul 3 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"But, is it legal?"
Scrolls,3bv17l,Tesserach,4,Thu Jul 2 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"the emulator is build from scratch and wont require a piece of official code, so no problems on that end. assets and clients are a problem after the shut down, because you would have to steal them after mojang stops distributing them."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Trisongs,3,Thu Jul 2 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"A problem in the sense that it might have posed a problem if Microsoft cared about the game at all. All current players paid for it, so they have a right to the client. That leaves any new players who'd need a copy, but who has ever stopped a pirate?"
Scrolls,3bv17l,Mackleroy_Megafish,3,Fri Jul 3 11:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. You can't really stop a pirate. Torrent is the way to go then, when you won't be able to get it from mojang. And who knows if/when we'll have a server emulator might as well create a new client. I have high hopes."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Sarik704,3,Fri Jul 3 11:19:23 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, there are a few ways to keep Scrolls alive:   Creating a mod for another engine, such as LackeyCCG: This is probably the easiest option, since no game code has to be written, just scripts for the cards and the card art is already there. Reverse-engineer the server, and host a community server: This will provide a way for veterans to keep playing the game after the official server closes. But many of the gameplay issues will still remain, and so it might not attract new players. Option 2 + add content and gameplay updates: The issue with this is that is fractures the community, and might disappoint people as the game changes away from what they felt was the original vision. This also has legal issues regarding updating and redistributing the client. Create a new game that is inspired by Scrolls: There was a post on here a couple days back where someone found it ironic that Scrolls players had nowhere to migrate to. Maybe it would be possible to create a new game that incorporated what people enjoyed about Scrolls. It would take a lot of effort and dedication from everyone involved, however."
Scrolls,3bv17l,squiddybiscuit,3,Fri Jul 3 11:38:06 2015 UTC,"I have been part of this amazing community since alpha and faced and defeated many great challengers (Im looking at you carnalizer (you could probably beet me now though :P)). However just like alpha,beta, and even the test server (when it was originally was restricted to alpha players) the servers decayed (sorry for the pun but it is what I called it before the decay update). While the scrolls community is strong I do see this potential project fan base also decaying after the project is completed. However given how this game is online only I do see a project like this one of a few ways to keep this game and community afloat.  If you guys do wish to proceeded with the project I wish you luck with the coding as well as potential conversations with the developers and Microsoft.  I wish the ones who want to see the game thrive the best of luck, Trisongs"
Scrolls,3bv17l,LogTrapster,3,Thu Jul 2 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"Can provide the physical server to run it on, able to hold hundreds of people. I'm too lazy to find any good use for it, so just PM me if there's anyone capable of organizing."

Scrolls,3bv17l,Sarik704,3,Fri Jul 3 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"What would people want changed?  Personally, I'd like to see:   Threshold resource system 75 second timer Hard Hand size limit (any cards you draw beyond 10 are automatically discarded to the Discard Pile)"
Scrolls,3bv17l,Indomitable_Wanderer,6,Thu Jul 2 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe a few less cantrip cards. I know they are a staple for most card games, but with scrolls having the decks reset and with no cards being ""dead"" because they can all be sacrificed for draw. This helped make GO and DG stall and overwhelm decks too good especially with wild. They did do a good job balancing these out near the end though."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Sarik704,4,Thu Jul 2 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, here we go:   Threshold system with a hard resource cap (value to be discussed, I would start with 10). Effects that increased current resource could go above that. Hard hand size limit of 10, with older cards (from left to right) automatically discarded. Most of the cantrip removed and corresponding cards reworked. Balance change a lot of cards, too many to discuss. Nerf CD manipulation as a whole. It should be more expensive and situational. An example of a good designed CD reduction card is Battle Dance. A badly designed card is Tempo Theft, it's extremely toxic to the game as it stands. Removal should be more situational and ward should be removed. Rework 1 CD and 3 CD creatures. 1 CD tends to be overpowered and 3 CD underpowered. Buff non-growth enchantments. Fatigue like system: everytime you cycle your deck, your idols take X damage, where X is equal to the number of times your deck cycled (or something similar). Add turtle unit."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Sarik704,2,Thu Jul 2 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"I like tempo theft. We could also talke about making some cards have HARD deck limits. Like only two are allowed, or only one is allowed."
Scrolls,3bv17l,fdagpigj,2,Fri Jul 3 05:17:57 2015 UTC,I would like Tempo Theft if it only could be used on units you control.  Having any of your units getting their CD stolen and replaced by 5 from Watcher or Arby (which is the most common play) is extremely frustrating and there's not counter play to that.

Scrolls,3bv17l,omega0zero,5,Thu Jul 2 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"Nice, but I don't know the first thing about Java =(  What authentication method does your server use? Currently the new build of Relentless uses the old RSA method and not Yggdrasil."
Scrolls,3bv17l,Namington,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"i also dont know mutch about java, but (lots of ppl will not like this) its the same as c# (where rentless is written in). its in a very early stage: i can login (i use a bat file to start the scrolls.exe directly, so only the auth-token is sended, so atm i dont care about login servers), use chat, and start a game. but i think for users, creating up a java server should be more easy than a c# server."
Scrolls,3bv17l,benjadahl,3,Thu Jul 2 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"The Java Runtime is huge, a memory hog, constantly nags with updates, tries to sneak toolbars into the system with every update, and is not standard with any OS installation. I have never been happy about having to deal with Java either on my personal computer or in servers. And if you have a metered server, Java is pain. I installed Openfire (a Java XMPP server) on my server container a few months ago, and this is what happened:  RAM: http://i.imgur.com/pc5UG2x.png  CPU: http://i.imgur.com/2ykmTqN.png  The Java runtime used more resources than everything else running on the server combined (multiple Apache sites with PHP and MySQL with a few thousand users in the company).  C# will be far easier to deal with in Windows, and if enough care is put into building it, it should port fine to Linux using Mono."

They eat small rodents and vermin like rats and nogs. They live in the mountains between Khalie, and Dyrra. They are the scrolls equivalent of goblins.  They seem to posses the qualities of speech and sentient thought to an extent. Some are not immediately hostile to humans it seems; The gravehawk may worshiped as a some sort of god. They eat horrible food and like loud bombastic explosions.  Their culture is highly shamanistic and primitive. They may ally themselves with the reavers as they share in their love of fire, explosions, and raiding."
