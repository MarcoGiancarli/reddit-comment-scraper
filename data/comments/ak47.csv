ak47,3e4978,BabyWookie,2,Tue Jul 21 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"The unobtanium of modern AK mags are finally available from an online store!   These highly desired, rare mags have been practically smuggled into the country before and sold by some individuals on various forums for around $100, but I've never seen them for sale from a store like this.  What I don't get is where the supply comes from. On an official level, Russia is not in the business of dumping perfectly serviceable, current issue arms parts on the surplus market... at least not since the 90's (when everything was for sale). I would really like to know who no longer needs these and who got to make some extra cash by throwing them our way. It could be that some unit got more than they need, but then again, with Russia, you can never rule simple greed based corruption being involved - someone in the supply chain writing these off as lost or damaged and then exporting them with the help of American partners.  Any way, it's a lot of money to pay for a mag, but I might just get two (one to use and one to show off) to complete my SGL21's look! These are supposed to be the best, most modern 7.62x39 mm AK mags out there."

ak47,3e4978,superdude4agze,7,Tue Jul 21 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"They are not importable via normal channels and the total number of them that ever made it to the US is probably just barely into the 3 digit territory.

It's an Arsenal AKS-74u with a legal-length barrel for SBRing. He has one SBR in there already so I assume he's waiting on a stamp.  I'm too lazy to check but I think those are real Russian handguards, I bought a pair from the same guy he bought his from.  The one with the long brake is a Polish Tantal.  His 'triangle folding Krink SBR' is an M92. Not really a ""Krink"" (though that's a pretty generic term for any AKS-74u-looking rifle). The one you want is the funny-barreled SLR-104. I think he has the actual proper booster too - there's 'shorty' versions of the muzzle device floating around out there and they just look silly."

ak47,3dyqit,r870,4,Mon Jul 20 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, probably make you even sadder if I told you that it originally came off a Wilkinson Arms ""Linda"" 9mm pistol. However, it does a great job of hiding muzzle flash and directing the noise down range, so I keep using it. No permanent mods to the rifle, it just clamps onto the slant brake with a set screw.  Definitely a nice gun, quite a few thousand rounds down the pipe, and I don't recall it ever malfunctioning."

You can look at the front sight post and if it is shifted far to one side, then it's an indication someone was desperately trying to get it on target.

ak47,3dzmce,imweezle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"The fixed stock model doesn't appear to have the usual fixed stock tang on the trunnion.  I don't think this would mean you couldn't use other stocks, but it's something to perhaps read into further since it is different than standard fixed stock trunnions.  For what it's worth, I haven't had to modify my Saiga whatsoever to shoot target loads.  Just use Federal 3-dram stuff.  Cheaper ammo (Winchester) and non-3-dram doesn't like to cycle because it's cheap ammo/underpowered.  Saigas were designed around hotter stuff like what is used for hunting/police work (magnum loads, 00 Buck, slugs, etc.).  They can be hit-or-miss on the cheap, target loads, but Federal 3-dram equivalent seems to cycle well in all of them from what I've seen.  You could also get a drop-in, adjustable gas valve that offers a wider range of gas adjustment if needed.  Not sure if that's available on the Vepr-12 since it's self-regulating.  As for shooting clays and hunting with it, you'll want some kind of choke, because a cylinder bore isn't going to be good for much anything other than self-defense and skeet."
ak47,3dzmce,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Looks like I'll just have to do more research regarding the stocks. I've got a spare WASR stock at home, so if I can't figure it out before I buy one I can always just experiment myself.   Now regarding what you said about your Saiga, isn't the VEPR supposed to cycle any kind of ammo with no problems, including the cheap stuff? That was a selling point for me.   Regarding shooting clays and hunting, what's adding a choke like? Is it a simple as screwing a new muzzle device on the end, or is it more complicated? I don't imagine it's something I'd be changing in the field, so I'll have tools and stuff at my disposal, but I'm just kinda curious what all is involved to do that.   Thanks Jake!"
ak47,3dzmce,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"The Vepr is self-regulating, yes, so, in theory, it should be able to handle a wider variety of ammunition than the Saiga.  However, I have still seen some threads here and there (rare, but there) of people having issues with their Vepr cycling some of the real cheap target loads.  Federal bulk-pack 3-dram is pretty much the same price as bulk Winchester, though, so I just get Federal 3-dram equivalent and my Saiga's cycled just fine with it.  I think the Vepr is supposed to be able to handle the lighter stuff better, but it wouldn't really hurt anything to just get the 3-dram equivalent ammo from Federal, anyway, I guess.  Adding a choke should be as simple as removing the muzzle nut/thread protector and putting a different choke onto the shotgun.  Carolina Shooter Supply's website has a few different chokes available.  They seem to run around $50.00 a piece unless you get the three-pack which seems to be a ""buy two get one free"" bundle ($100.00 for all three).  The Saiga comes with a multi-tool that can be used to tighten muzzle devices.  I am assuming Veprs are the same way.  If not, just taking the washer/spacer CSS recommends to the hardware store and sizing a wrench to it should solve any issues.  It shouldn't come loose, but it wouldn't hurt to slip the wrench into a pocket and check on it after a few rounds to make sure."
ak47,3dzmce,BabyWookie,2,Mon Jul 20 23:42:40 2015 UTC,Thanks Jake. Informative as always. I appreciate it.
ak47,3dzmce,SovietUrsa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"Some 12-ga target ammo is so low-powered that it's simply not meant to cycle the hefty action of a semi-auto shotgun. With ANY semi shotgun, it's best to avoid target loads that are less than 3 dram and anything labeled ""low"" or ""reduced recoil"". Why even fuck with some non-standard shells/loads made in some third world country, when every Walmart carries Federal 3 dr target load as well a Federal, Remington and Winchester slugs and buck for dirt cheap? Just stick with that cheap brand-name stuff and you won't have a problem.  Any way, you are not going to be able to replace that fixed tubular skeleton stock without some pretty heavy gun smithing. To install a Magpul folder, you would probably have to remove the rear trunnion and replace it with a standard AKM one, which requires drilling, riveting and maybe even cutting or welding.  The Vepr-12 imported into this country are short-barreled tactical models, which are not particularly well-suited for hunting. Shorter barrels produce bigger spread at shorter ranges. However, there are a few screw-on chokes and adaptors on the market, which do remedy the situation somewhat. Vepr-12 has the same muzzle threading that Saiga-12 has, so all of the Saiga-12 chokes/adaptors will work. I would stay away from PolyChoke, as I found it to be nearly useless. If I decided to go Turkey hunting with my V12, I would probably look into one of the available Winchester choke adaptors or something."
ak47,3dzmce,SovietUrsa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I didn't realize that the ""cheap stuff"" ammo was low recoil garbage. My ignorance is showing. :P I was planning on using the middle of the road wal-mart stuff (federal, Winchester, etc.). In fact, the low ammo cost is what has me considering a VEPR-12 over a AK74 variant for my next purchase. Anyway, thanks for the insight."
ak47,3dzmce,SovietUrsa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"Everything Jake said is spot-on. I've got the folding stock Vepr, so I haven't really investigated what changing the furniture would require.   As for ammo, anything 3 dram or higher should theoretically work. I say theoretically because Winchester is inconsistent and may not cycle reliably even if the box says 3 dram. The Federal Multi-Load (TM) bulk pack in the red boxes cycles very well in mine, and 100 shells cost about $22. The buckshot and slugs I've tried cycled fine too. If you REALLY wanted to shoot the bottom-of-the-barrel cheap ammo you could get a lighter recoil spring for your gun, but that's only for if you never want to shoot heavier loads at all.  For hunting birds, you'll need a choke. Carolina Shooter Supply has lots of Vepr 12 accessories, chokes included. They also have magazines and US-made parts if you want to make your shotgun 922r compliant. If you'll only be hunting deer I'd just use rifled slugs.   If you'd like more info, check out www.vepr.org. There's a wealth of knowledge there, but Jake already hit most of the high points. If you buy one I hope you like it as much as I like mine. It's been a blast to shoot."

I guess I didn't realize 922(R) would rear its ugly head regarding shotguns :P These shotguns are 922(R) compliant out of the box right?  How do you like the folding stock? In your opinion, is it worth the $200 price difference? I thought having a folder would be nice in the event it ever had to be used for home defense, and being small and maneuverable was desirable. Other than that though, i don't know that it would add anything to my shooting experience. I'd like to hear your opinion though."

ak47,3dq5rs,AFlockofTurtles,3,Sat Jul 18 12:38:57 2015 UTC,Right. Not the greatest prices from what I've seen. And Atlantic Firearms wasn't too great of a solution as ffl fees in my area are 35 or more plus another 30ish for shipping. I think I was looking at 650 shipped from them vs 700 from a local gun store I'm a big fan of here.
ak47,3dq5rs,deerhunter429,10,Sat Jul 18 12:53:15 2015 UTC,$700 you got played like a fiddle son!
ak47,3dq5rs,AFlockofTurtles,5,Sat Jul 18 12:52:23 2015 UTC,I honestly do not doubt the price was a bit much due to tax as well. I kind of explained the cost deal above.   Atlantic 570+30 shipping +40 FFL = 640 with around a week of turnaround time.   LGS: 700 out the door with like 3 hours of pistol range time and 2 rifle hours.   Other LGS : in my area are up into 800+   Not too sure why our area is so expensive atm.

If you had to suggest the best manufacturers to look for (keep in mind i live in the US so i need to adhere to the laws) other than the QC inspected WASR, what would you suggest?

I understand that the QC inspected WASR is a great deal for someone beginning but if i can find something along the lines of (what i think) i want for just a few hundred dollars more, id like to just cut to the chase and spend on that.

ak47,3ds8vr,SpiveyArms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"If you had to suggest the best manufacturers to look for [...] other than the QC inspected WASR, what would you suggest?   A kit built by /u/SpiveyArms or an Arsenal SLR-107FR (or '104FR if you don't mind 5.45x39mm) if you can afford one.  Spivey can take a kit and make it pretty close to the issued rifle the kit came from.  Building from a kit like that would mean that everything is ""correct"" and that the receiver would just need some extra, superfluous engravings (fake full-auto marking) to get it more ""correct.""  He is working on a Polish AKMS for me at the moment, but I just want it to be ""shooter-grade.""  It's going to have his regular receiver markings and such since I don't care to get that detailed since it'll never be full-auto, anyway.  The Arsenals will be ""almost '100 series"" rifles.  The SLR-104FR will be, aside from one minor detail, an AK-74M clone through-and-through.  The SLR-107FR will be a look-alike to an AK-103, but in all actuality be more like an AKM (internal parts) configured like an AKS-74 (sidefolding stock, 90o gas block, 24x1.5mmRH muzzle device threads, etc.).  The only true AK-103 clones to reach US shores have been SGL 21-series rifles from Arsenal/FIME, but those are ~$1,400.00+ now, and that's just for the fixed-stock ones.  Even then, there's a few things that need changed to even get those to being a true '103 clone.  TL;DR:  /u/SpiveyArms could probably hook you up with a solid AKM or AK-74 clone from a kit.  About the only differences country-to-country between AKMs and AK-74s (1959-mid-1980s) was the furniture, and that's easily replaced.   [...]differences between an AKM/AKMN[....]   The only difference between an AKM and AKMN is the dovetail on the left-hand side of the receiver that allows you to mount an optic.  It's easier to find AKMN and AK-74Ns on the market today simply because they've been around so long it costs nothing extra to have that dovetail.  When the AKM and AK-74 were current-issue, though, the ""N"" variants of both were less common and typically only used by special units.  This was because back then about the only optic they had for them was a night vision scope when your regular grunt was most definitely not getting issued.   [...]and the AK-103 [.....] Can you explain the differences to me?   Sure!  This is not nearly as in-depth as it could be, and due to both of my rifles differing slightly from a true AKM and true AK-103, there's going to be some things that aren't quite right here, but here is a comparison of just that:  http://imgur.com/a/ryXxA  The biggest difference between a '74M/'100-series rifle and anything else, though, is that fourth barrel trunnion rivet on the left-hand-front of the receiver.  Russia is the only place doing those.  I don't know of anyone in the US that replicates it/fakes it, so for a '100-series rifle, you about have to have an SGL 21 as your base.  The early AK-74Ms didn't always have this, though, so an SLR-104FR could cut it there.  Since you're concerned with a wood stock, though, I guess AKM/AK-74 is more your interest, anyway, so this isn't a big deal.   [...]if i can find something along the lines of (what i think) i want for just a few hundred dollars more, id like to just cut to the chase and spend on that.   I would find yourself a parts kit and send it to /u/SpiveyArms.  As mentioned earlier, aside from factory markings on the parts themselves, pretty much any AKM/AK-74 is going to look so similar that only the furniture is a dead give-away on country of origin.  Polish AKM kits can be found on Atlantic Firearms right now, and the only major difference between them and a Russian AKM is that the Poles profiled their handguards a little different.  The wood also looks slightly different, but swapping furniture is pretty easy.  Surplus Russian stocksets are sub-$200.00, as well.  Russian and Polish AKMs were almost identical to one another, and Russian and Bulgarian AK-74s were almost identical to one another.  The only big differences you'd find are the factory logo as to who made it and the furniture.  The factory logo can't readily be changed, but the furniture is like a five minute process.  All just depends on how exact you want to make your rifle.  74uLLC also makes custom, 1:1 clone receivers for particular countries, as well, if you did go the parts kit route and wanted a ""correct"" receiver."

ak47,3ds8vr,GrittyHandjob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"The ""best"" depends on a lot of factors. The best for certain needs, the best for a certain budget, the best for collectibility.  WASR's are recommended most because most people asking are working with budget constraints. Is there a functional difference between the two you posted? Probably not. But the RAK has better parts, is assembled by people paying more attention, and will hold a better value than the WASR. You also can't get new *Saigas into the country now.   So the value is there for both rifles, whether one is the better choice for you is up to you.   *Are you happy now /u/Noveske!"

By-far the most effective muzzle brake I've ever used, but it has a huge concussion.  You can even feel it as the shooter.  The Ultimak also will not burn your hand if you're not dumb about it.  See the image in the top-right of the subreddit?  The one with the late Kalashnikov holding a '74M?  See how his fingers curl and ""clamp"" the handguard rather than try to wrap around the whole thing like you see with AR shooters?  Hold it like that and you'll be fine since your fingers/thumb will only ever be contacting the lower handguard.  If you shoot with gloves, it'll take a while to notice any heat, anyway.  Ronin's Grips makes a palm-swell, black polymer lower handguard for Yugo. rifles, by the way.  Might look into that.  The palm swell would further encourage correct finger placement."

ak47,3dqk2r,BabyWookie,2,Sat Jul 18 14:24:20 2015 UTC,I like that the Ultimak replaces the gas tube entirely and weighs less.  The gas tube is the weakest ink of the rifle and corrodes easily in bad weather.  They are commonly replaced in the military.  The Ultimak is much more resistant against corrosion than the standard gas tube.
ak47,3dqk2r,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"The amount of weight the MWI quad rail adds to the front end of the rifle is pretty substantial.  Good call on the Ultimak, and u/JakesGunReviews turned me on to the ZenitCo B-10M lower hand guard that looks like it works pretty well without adding too much clank."
ak47,3dqk2r,MarcusDohrelius,2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yep. My 2009 SGL21 came with the then brand new and great looking MWI rail. Seemed like a good idea idea when ordering it, but when I got it, I instantly realized that I've made a mistake, as it's Coke can-like weight ruined the balance of the weapon for me and that's without any accessories. The AK/M is already a rather heavy and not particularly balanced/ergonomic weapon, so literally every ounce counts. Zenit stuff is great because those guys are really in-tune with all these things and their designs are very well thought out as far as making the part lighter without sacrificing too much durability."
ak47,3dqk2r,BabyWookie,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:12 2015 UTC,Worth noting that ZenitCo items won't fit any Zastava-made AK.

Some exceptions are the models offered by Parabellum and TWS, though I have heard you will lose zero with the TWS as well if it is bumped while the cover is open.   An Ultimak or a side rail mount are the best options."
ak47,3dqoj6,VisPacmanParabola,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree except for the ultimak part. The two best options are the Troy Industries gas tube and obviously RS Regulate. The troy is better, because it is precisely adjusted for your rifle. Plus, if you snug it all the way down, you can tack weld the retaining nut in place so it'll never back out. The Troy also has better heat dissipation and you don't clamp anything to your barrel."
ak47,3dqoj6,Noveske,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"Those all seem to be good reasons, I just haven't experienced the troy rail and know basically nothing about it."

ak47,3dqoj6,MarcusDohrelius,3,Sat Jul 18 15:40:08 2015 UTC,The Zentico one seems to be rock solid. But they are crazy expensive. The TWS will hold zero but I have no idea if it would hold on during drops and drills etc. No real reason not to get a RS Regulate siderail if you are willing to spend over $100 for an optic mount for the AK.

So, by the time you get a ZenitCo LHG and the ZenitCo receiver cover, you're already into it ~$500.00.  It's cheaper and generally more reliable to just get a side mount or put something on an Ultimak gas tube."
ak47,3dqoj6,BabyWookie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it was big money to get something possibly solid.  I have no desire to get one, just wanted to know the overall opinion of them.  My local store is building AKs  and swear by dust cover rails, I think they use a TWS with a aperture sight on the back  - but they are trying to sell a product, one with no side rail.  I guess they have a 8mm Mauser prototype though...might get into that game if they release it.  I got my PK-01VS for around $500 - I would still be looking for an optic if I got the dustcover set up for that price.    Thanks for the input!"

ak47,3dqoj6,r870,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:42 2015 UTC,The ZenitCo B-33 is just built much more solid and doesn't replace the rear iron sight.  I think they're about all switching to the B-33s if they use cover-mounted optics now.

I do have to mention though that personally, there are a lot of purchases I could resist fairly well, but if you guys made a run of AKSU-74 clones for those who don't have things like time to build them themselves; well I for one am pretty sure I couldn't resist.

ak47,3dkmcv,ice445,8,Fri Jul 17 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"That's probably just the feed ramp of the barrel.  Please provide a photo if possible to confirm.  To replace grips, it's pretty easy.  Just remove the receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt-carrier assembly from the rifle.  Then remove the screw from the factory grip until you can pull it off of the rifle.  Dump the pistol grip screw nut out the inside of the receiver.  Drop in the new one.  US Palm grips are hollow and use a short screw, so it'll be kind of tricky installing it.  What I do for grips like that is have the rifle sort of on its side in my lap.  Then I place the nut in the rifle where it needs to go and leave it.  When I go to screw the grip on, the hand holding the receiver also holds the grip screw nut.  You'll have to guide the grip's screw with your screwdriver once you've got it started threading into the nut.  It'll be awkward at first, but I'm sure you'll figure it out."

ak47,3dl1bh,ChrisKilo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"Listen to the resident asshole here. I'm telling you right now, don't get an Ultimak. Those were for the days when there were hardly any side rail mounts. I don't understand the concept of not wanting to readily field strip your rifle. The thing heats up because it's aluminum and it's a very short barreled rifle. If you ever get that thing hot enough, you can cook off optics that way.  You want the real solution for something similar to that, but it's better insulated, you can field strip it, and durable as all hell?  http://www.manticorearms.com/Renegade-Forearm-for-Yugo-Krinkov-AK-MA-8100.htm  Mr.Gunsngear did a review on how dirable it is. Would rather get that. Plus as your barrel heats up, you can actually lose zero with an ultimak because the barrel actually elongates slightly forward as it heats up. Finally, clamping something on your barrel actually reduces the harmonics in an AK which is bad because it POTENTIALLY lessen the reliability since the AK was designed to elongate and contract to get debris away from certain areas; although, this is very unlikely."
ak47,3dl1bh,Noveske,2,Fri Jul 17 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"I've got UltiMAK's on 2 AK's and have for a few years. Neither have caused any loss of accuracy due to elongating barrels or any other reason. UltiMAK's are intentionally made slightly shorter to avoid any issues with swelling and shifting zero. As far as heat goes if you use an optic that is worth a shit it will withstand the heat but a shitty one won't. It's so easy to clean it with a brush without removing it too. I honestly can't think of any reason NOT to use an UltiMAK if you want a simple, reliable way to mount a red dot that will co-witness with irons.  It's even lighter than a standard gas tube is..."
ak47,3dl1bh,ChrisKilo,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"Can't think of a reason? Here's a few:   Can't thorough break your rifle down. Have to clamp something to a barrel no thread lock will adequately hold that. The Troy simply tensions against itself, you can then tack weld the nut in place. The Manticore Renegade is superior as well. It's better insulated."
ak47,3dl1bh,Noveske,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:01:23 2015 UTC,I'm saying I've been running them for years without issue. They're simple and they WORK. Like an AK ;)
ak47,3dl1bh,ChrisKilo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:14:35 2015 UTC,And the Troy is simpler.
ak47,3dl1bh,Noveske,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't the Troy tension between the gas block and front trunnion? If you are worried about heat swelling and contracting the barrel THAT will cause more change in your zero than a piece that clamps directly to the barrel and doesn't fully contact the trunnion OR the gas block intentionally leaving room for expansion and contraction. At this point we are just splitting hairs because the changes are probably in the thousandths of an inch, but I just can't see how you can scream ""DO NOT buy an UltiMAK!"" When it has a proven track record of being an extremely light, reliable and simple method of putting a forward mounted optic on.  I'm just saying, it's still a very good option for thousands of AK shooters."
ak47,3dl1bh,ChrisKilo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:52 2015 UTC,You are wrong. Does a gas tube sit against the rear sight block or the front trunnion? Obviously the rear sight block. And it's irrelevant a Troy still has better heat dissipating properties than an Ultimak does.
ak47,3dl1bh,Noveske,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:32 2015 UTC,"Lol my bad, sight block is what I meant to say. Seriously though...this is a ridiculous argument because there is STILL going to be more swelling between those two points than two barrel bands an inch apart directly on the barrel. My point is still that UltiMAK is fine, comrade. I'm sure the Troy is fine too, I just don't see why you have so much hatred for such a good mounting option, especially when it works flawlessly for anyone who owns one."
ak47,3dl1bh,RKobalt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't work, I just think that it's literally well over a decade old design. Let's start getting some free floating rails on an AK like the Tantal."
ak47,3dl1bh,ChrisKilo,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"Ultimak has over 10 years of use.  All of those concerns have been debunked or are rare enough to be ignored  The renegade clamps to the gas tube, which is not a stable object - mine wobbles enough to make it useless for this use. I doubt I have the only m92 with a gas tube that shifts, and relying on the polymer top hand guard cover to hold it down is bubbatastic."

I've just had too many problems with the 7 magazines I have that I'm sick of giving them shots. If the AR15 magazines function even 1/4's of the time that's statistically better than what I've experienced so far.  I have one Circle 10 magazine that works flawlessy. I have one the ejects a live round with every spent cartridge. One of them has trouble feeding. The other 4 hardly fit into the magwell after extensive sanding and still have difficulty feeding into my Romanian design. Frankly, it's enough to make me try something new, and if it bites me in that ass I'll take that snub.  I promised you guys a full review of the rifle when I first got it but I hardly have more than 200 rounds through it and my magazine problems have been less than stellar. With the one working magazine and accuracy-wise I'm very pleased so far, however. I'll get you guys that review soon."

ak47,3dgpek,TheMadAsshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:25:53 2015 UTC,So it is actually perfectly capable of getting a good grouping at 400m?
ak47,3dgpek,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think 400m is a stretch for any precise shooting thanks to the sights and bullet drop, but I am sure if you popped off a few rounds at a man-sized target at 400m, you're bound to hit it a time or two, which is combat effective.  Depends on what you consider a good grouping for a carbine with almost-pistol-sights and an 8in. barrel, really.  The Russian sight does have two settings, though:  battlefield (the ""n"" looking character) and ""4-5,"" which would be 400-500m.  I doubt it's ever used beyond a few hundred, though."

ak47,3dflgf,MethAintAllBad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"I used a grinder to reform the jaws on my bolt cutters then used a dremel to put a spherical divot in some angle iron to support the rivet head. Super easy, cheap, and works pretty well!  To get the barrel out I just used the vice jaws opened up enough to support the trunnion and then used a socket and a hammer. Took some pounding but it worked. I found if you add some kroil before you start hitting it it works a lot better.  Getting the barrel back in was easier because I could heat the trunnion while the entire barrel assembly was in the freezer.  I'd say the specialized tooling is about saving time more than anything else."

ak47,3de2r5,JakesGunReviews,0,Thu Jul 16 03:13:59 2015 UTC,Then you aren't training hard enough. Plus a forward mount like that is just stupid. You're adding weight to the front of your gun. I'm going to be getting an RS Regulate with an Aimpoint T2.
ak47,3de2r5,Noveske,0,Thu Jul 16 10:35:16 2015 UTC,An Ultimak plus an AimPoint Micro is maybe 5oz. of weight added to the rifle while offering a superior flashlight mounting position.
ak47,3de2r5,JakesGunReviews,0,Thu Jul 16 14:04:00 2015 UTC,It's 5 more ounces in front of your rifle though. Not including the weight of your flashlight that's mounted in a left-hand only configuration. I'll take a pic once I build my rifle of a better configuration.
ak47,3de2r5,Noveske,0,Thu Jul 16 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"I don't include the weight of the flashlight because mine is quick-detach and only goes on if needed.

ak47,3de2r5,A14,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"You could roll with a Magpul handguard. Mount the Inforce and VFG to the handguard. If you want an actual rail, look at Ultimak, Kreb's, Manticore, Zenit, K-Var, and Midwest Industries. The dot, you could mount in an RS Regulate side mount. But having used it, I just don't care for the added weight. I like the Ultimak a lot more.   Personally, I use an Ultimak gas tube for the light and dot, and a K-Var lower handguard. Again, Ultimak's own lower handguard, Magpul, Zenit, or Manticore would work with the gas tube for VFG mounting."

I put an optic on the Ultimak rather than on a side mount due to my sidefolding stock, but if I had a fixed-stock rifle, I'd use an RS Regulate like my girlfriend and use an Ultimak or just a simple clamp-on rail section for my flashlight.    Heck, now that I've realized how infrequently I fold my stock, if I had to do it over again, I'd probably get an RS Regulate for a rifle with a sidefolder, too."

A friend of mine used some no-name clamp-on rail segment and attached it to his gas tube once for a flashlight mount.  It positioned it similarly to how an Ultimak would position a light. I think either would work, but my preference would be for the one that can fit on the gas tube just because of the better positioning."
ak47,3de2r5,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:02 2015 UTC,So why would you not want to use the Regulate with a folding stock exactly? Any reason other than personal preference?

ak47,3de2r5,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:58 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
ak47,3de2r5,JakesGunReviews,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:51 2015 UTC,"I use GP-30 pads on everything now, for what it's worth.  It won't allow sidefolders to fold, either, so it's kind of a ""get whatever you prefer"" kind of deal.  The Ultimaks with an AP Micro (or similar) will weigh less, but it's a little odd getting used to a scout-style red dot.  The RS Regulates won't shift balance whatsoever (or could even move it rearward, depending on the mount), be more natural-feeling to use, but weigh a tiny bit more.  It is inherently quick-detach, though, which is the biggest advantage it has over anything on an Ultimak that allows a cowitness."

ak47,3d8khm,kebab_removal,3,Tue Jul 14 11:06:25 2015 UTC,Is the 7N22 and 7N10 rounds better than 7N6 terminally? Or did they go the M855 route and prefer penetration?
ak47,3d8khm,RafTheKillJoy,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:04 2015 UTC,If Wikipedia is to be believed 7n10 was designed to have superior penetration compared to 7n6 but had similar ballistics.  7n22 doesn't seem to be a lot more different other than slightly heavier penetrating core and overall bullet weight.

EDIT: also whats your favorite AK? how are kalashnikov concern ak47 different than one made in russia? do you like them? what AK would you recommend for a good middle of the road one? what do you think of the AK by DDI formerly owned by waffen works?

ak47,3d5hr2,skiier23,9,Mon Jul 13 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Most of the reason you (speaking in general) end up with something like this is because, ""I really like all the features I have on this AK, but I wish it had x-item different, but I don't want to necessarily change this rifle's set-up...  better buy another AK.""  I am not OP, but I will try to answer some of your questions:   i want an AK47 (and a glock) but idk which one i should get.   A QC-Inspected WASR from Atlantic Firearms and a Glock 17 or Glock 19 (used to save on price if you don't mind used guns) is a really solid set-up that's nearly impossible to go wrong with.   how are kalashnikov concern ak47 different than one made in russia?   Concern Kalashnikov is based in Russia.  They are a conglomeration of Izhevsk, Izhmash, and some other companies. Kalashnikov USA is in no way related to Concern Kalashnikov in Russia.  K. USA is simply RWC Group (former importer of Russian AK-pattern Saigas) under a new name.  They're trying to get themselves business by associating with the name even though they have nothing to do with the actual Kalashnikov factory.   what AK would you recommend for a good middle of the road one?   QC-Inspected WASR.   what do you think of the AK by DDI [....]?   QC-Inspected WASR."

WTF. more people need to know this. thanks man.saved me from getting one. cheers.
ak47,3d5hr2,JakesGunReviews,3,Tue Jul 14 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"There are some people theorizing that Kalashnikov USA is a rebranded IO since both IO and their other rebrand pioneer arms are total shit.  Since Jake likes to circle jerk the QC inspected wasrs hard I'll say some more options (though the wasrs are good guns, nothing wrong with them).  DDI makes a great AK, Arsenal makes a good AK, Zastavas are ok, wasrs are good (new production QC inspected ones.  Any other AK is ok to buy used, be cautious about buying an older used wasr), people seem to like the c39v2.  Id recommend sticking to a stamped AKM, the under folders have a rough cheekweld and the side folders get expensive.  The tapco g2 that comes with it is good enough, though the ALG AKT is really good.  For optics go with a side rail mount, you can save money somewhere else, actually spend the money on a good optic and mount.  RS regulate and an aimpoint or a more traditional eastern optic."
ak47,3d5hr2,Frostiken,-4,Tue Jul 14 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't ""get"" the appeal of Saigas. ""But it's Russian! It's, like, more legit!"" First of all, it would be legit if it were Soviet. It's not. The USSR hasn't existed for over two decades. Secondly, it's never going to be a proper AK without the giggle switch, and certainly not when you have to do all these modifications to make it not look like a ridiculous hunting rifle.  I have a Russian-made Makarov, but it's a commercial IJ-70. It's not a Cold War-era handgun, so it has no history and thus it's basically an emotionless lump of metal to me, no matter what country of origin is stamped on the side. Russia didn't make the Makarov, the USSR did. Russia doesn't even have a use for the damn things anymore - I'm getting shit just made for commercial purposes.  It'd be like paying extra for a katana that was forged in Japan. When you think of katanas and Japan, you think of monks in temples and climbing a thousand steps to the master craftsman who lives on top of a mountain and hoping he forges one of his legendary swords for you. Except that's not what you're getting, you're getting a piece of metal that's stamped out in a factory that could be placed anywhere."
ak47,3d5hr2,JakesGunReviews,4,Tue Jul 14 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"AKs don't have to be Soviet to be authentic. Exactly zero AK-100 series rifles were Soviet-made, to my knowledge, but I am taken aback by the mere thought of someone considering AK-101s, AK-102s, '103s, etc., ""not legit AK designs."" Saigas are literally the only AK-100-series rifles available on the commercial market.  Their configuration may not be AK-100 spec., as far as furniture and original trigger location goes, but their receiver, barrel, internals, and pretty much everything else's requirements as far as dimensions/quality are. They are made to Russian standards, which are the highest standards held for any military AK.  There is more to an AK than its outward appearance."
ak47,3d5hr2,BabyWookie,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the -105, which is the only -100 series AK actually used by Russia and the only way to probably get that specific hardware configuration, what exactly is 'authentic' about the -101, -102, -103 and -104? Russia has literally zero use for them, and the idea of a 5.56mm AK disgusts me. And an AK-74 with a 7.62 barrel doesn't seem like it's achieving anything productive at all. Hell, they're made for the export market, which basically makes them monkey models, and I can't even find anything about anyone actually buying the things.  EDIT: Apparently Venezuela bought some -103s and -104s.   Very few people actually gave a shit about buying Colt AR-15s ""because it's Colt!"", yet they were exactly as 'legit' as the -100 series AKs. If you were content with buying another brand of AR-15 and justifying it saying 'it's basically the same thing', then congratulations, you've proven my point.  I mean, look at the VEPR 7.62x54mmR thing. It's not a Dragunov. It never will be a Dragunov. It's closer to a PSL, and you might as well just buy a PSL. What are you actually accomplishing by buying the VEPR?"
ak47,3d5hr2,SpiveyArms,4,Tue Jul 14 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Russia uses the crap out of AK-103s and AK-104s.  Very often.  All AK variants given an official designation have passed the Russian reliability and torture tests.  Russia doesn't just adopt something willy-nilly.  Take the AK-12 for example.  They've been testing it for three or four years now and still haven't quite officially adopted it.  The Vepr and Saigas were configured for sporting purposes.  Their barrels, receivers, etc., are all held to the same standards as their military counterparts (RPK series, AK-100 series), to my knowledge, however.  What do you gain out of a Vepr over a PSL?  For one, something better than that #Cugir quality, and for a lesser price.  Veprs are outstanding rifles that are very overbuilt for their purposes.  Saigas offer Russian receivers, barrels, and other internal components made in the same factories as their AK-74Ms and AK-100 series.  Heck, even if Russia used no 100-series rifles, that would still have no effect on their quality.  '100-series rifles and the AK-74M have over 90% parts compatibility, so if it met military testing requirements with the '74M, those same parts are going into the 100-series rifles.  I don't mean to come across as a dick here, but to say the AK-100 series are ""monkey models"" is one of the most ridiculous claims I've ever heard in regards to the AK series.  It sounds like you have more reading to do if you think Russia has only used the AK-105 out of the century-series rifles and that the rest are, comparatively, turds."
ak47,3d5hr2,BabyWookie,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"The base weapon for the Century series is actually the AK-74M, which is used heavily as the general issue long arm of the Russian Armed Forces and had gone through some of the nastiest, poor conditions fighting in Europe since WW2 (see: Chechnya). The 7.62x39 mm models are certainly used as supplemental weapons by various ""spetsnaz"" units - the AK-104 is particularly popular with the guys, as this caliber still has its advantages.   AKs had always been designed and made in Izhevsk, Russia. No one test their AKs as thoroughly as the Russians - every little part is stress tested under every possible condition both by the factory itself and then by government contracted institutions which specialize in these things. You can be sure that a Russian gun is not made from substandard steel, is properly heat-treated, assembled, etc - won't break when mishandled or fall apart under continuous full auto fire.   I mean, look at the VEPR 7.62x54mmR thing. It's not a Dragunov. It never will be a Dragunov. It's closer to a PSL, and you might as well just buy a PSL. What are you actually accomplishing by buying the VEPR?   Other the fact that the PSL has an inherent design flaw which keeps it from (safely) being used with heavy ball ammunition, the fit and finish difference between Molot and Cugir/Century guns is rather obvious. Molot Vepr 7.62x54R is simply the best semi-auto rifle in that caliber that's not an SVD, which are prohibitively rare and expensive in the US."

The only thing that turns me off a Vepr 54R is the current mag situation - no mags over 10 rounds and the 10 round ones being single stack, long and ugly as hell. However, guys like CSSpecs are now working on high quality double-to-single mag solution for the platform.  Interestingly enough, I personally own a Vepr 308 (couldn't pass it up for $500 when Centerfire Systems that crazy Vepr sale), but I have a lot of .308 ammo - picked up thousands of surplus rounds from a local guy for a crazy low price once. I customized it just the way I like it and it's been a great gun for me:  http://i.imgur.com/qq8AvRm.jpg  I also own a customized Vepr-12 that's excellent too. Molot stuff really is top notch."

Not sure how their stuff is going to be.  Honestly, its hard to recommend a good middle of the road AK.  They are all pretty good.  There is always a chance you can get a lemon but its pretty rare.  I have never had a problem with my waffen werks rifles, I know they had some bad runs though.  The DDI would probably be fine although I think the KC Saiga is probably better.

ak47,3d7kzu,ClevelandReefer,3,Wed Jul 15 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"Fully steel reinforced in all the important places, lightest weight mags in their class. But more importantly, they're uncommon Russian magazines, and very collectible."
ak47,3d7kzu,azotos,2,Wed Jul 15 00:16:06 2015 UTC,Lighter than bakelite? Are they in 5.45x39? Are they rare because only a few made it in before the sanctions?
ak47,3d7kzu,ClevelandReefer,2,Wed Jul 15 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"The 5.45 counterparts are called true blacks. The sanctions have no effect on the prevalence of 103 magazines in the U.S. And I've never weighed them against Bakelite actually, because I don't consider them to be in the same class, so I can't say."
ak47,3d7kzu,azotos,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks for the information, I didn't understand what you meant when you said class. Do you sell them privately or thought a site?"
ak47,3d7kzu,ClevelandReefer,2,Wed Jul 15 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"I sell them all privately on different websites and forums. I'm not good enough at internets to set up my own secure web store.  By ""class"" I mean category. Bakelites aren't really polymer mags so I don't count them among 103 mags. 103 mags are the lightest in their class, meaning polymer, fully steel reinforced mags."

Albania left the Warsaw Pact in the late 50's, siding with China after the Sino-Soviet Split. After that, all their tech was Chinese as opposed to Soviet based."
ak47,3d7kzu,BabyWookie,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:31 2015 UTC,Haven't tried those yet. I'll have to see if I can find some.

Can't tell them apart other than color and smell (Albanian ones had cosmoline in them more recently, so they still have that odor to a small degree)."
ak47,3d7kzu,JakesGunReviews,3,Tue Jul 14 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"For 5.45x39: Bulgarian circle 10s 30 rounders.  There are very few choices already regarding AK74 mags, you basically have circle 10s, circle 10 45 rounders, bakelites, steel mags and tapcos.  Tapcos are garbage, bakelites are nice but expensive, steel mags are difficult to find, circle 10 45 rounders are super long, circle 10 30 rounders are just right, super reliable too.  For 7.62x39:  Cheapo steel mags.  There are plenty of polymer options available (bulgarian: good, magpul: good, tapco: shit, etc) but you can get some decent quality steel mags for under 10 bucks.  Nice, cheap and reliable, can't go wrong with that."

It's beefy, has a buttery smooth action, and has yet to give me a single issue. I feel the milled receiver does a slightly better job of absorbing the shock/recoil compared to my N-Pap, but I'll go on the record and say that it's most likely the placebo effect.

It's my favorite rifle, but it's my first and only AK so I can't say how it would compare to others.... I've put almost 1k rounds of Wolf and it eats it up like no other.   Pretty accurate by my standards, only thing to do is to slap a micro red dot optic with RS Regulate mount and a flash light, most likely using RS Regulate barrel mount.   I think keeping the rifle as stock as possible would help retain its value, (mine cost $1250 sticker price) plus the rifle is designed to be used in its factory set up.
