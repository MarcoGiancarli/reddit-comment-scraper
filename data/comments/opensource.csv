After that happens it's next to impossible to convince them their product is a lie because you're basically needing them to admit their life is a lie.  I watched a friend of mine try to demonstrate how cool the talking feature is on his xbox one. The whole time the system is getting his commands wrong and I'm just trying not to bust up laughing at him. He's already shelled out the money for the device and is invested in the fantasy of how it's supposed to work. He ended up blaming it on background noise but I'm sure if I checked the commercials would show rooms full of people.  This friend couldn't even come to terms with what he was seeing with his own eyes. No way he's going to be able to come to terms with what's happening far away in some imaginary land. I wouldn't be surprised if this friend said ""data mining isn't real"".and maybe for that friend it isn't. If he don't see how it effects his life maybe for him it isn't real.  I agree there is a problem, I'm just not sure what the solution is. The mainstream wants a talking selfie helmet that they can boss around. I'll want to take photos of how stupid they look and post it to their favorite social media site but that seems counter productive and a little hypocritical.

opensource,3d9669,rawfan,2,Wed Jul 15 07:40:35 2015 UTC,"sabre/katana focuses on contacts, calendars, task lists and files. ownCloud is a bigger tool which includes different features. ownCloud is based on sabre/dav though, just like sabre/katana but sabre/katana is based on a more recent version of sabre/dav which includes better performances, more features, better security etc.  sabre/katana does not aim to be a huge tool. We would like to respect the Unix philosophy: Do one thing and do it well. Contacts, calendars & co. are part of the DAV technology family. This is the one thing. The border is difficult to draw though (file permissions etc.) but we are planning to introduce extensions/plugins to extend sabre/katana features.  Also, from a basic point of view, sabre/katana is way lighter than ownCloud :-]. Oh and I forgot to mention that this is just a server, not a client. We are going to develop specific standalone clients in the future (do one thing…).  Finally, sabre/katana has an administration interface, which we are going to “extract” in order to be used on top of any DAV servers. Like the clients we are preparing, they will be server agnostic. This is the fruux philosophy actually: Push the whole industry, not just our own business :-)."

opensource,3d0pez,logicalmaniak,6,Sun Jul 12 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"I've taken and taught a course run by the OpenStack Foundation on open source contribution.  We spend most of our time talking about the social aspects of contribution:     Find an interesting project Is it actively developed? How many people work on it?  Are they all employees of one company? Where do people hang out (mailing list, IRC, forums)?   Once you've found an interesting project with an active community, you can start to engage immediately.  Follow any development ""getting started"" guides, and check their bug tracker for small bugs that you can fix, but don't necessarily fix them yet!  Introduce yourself, let the team know that you're interested in fixing the bug, and ask if there's anything you should know before you get started.    A strong community will help you.    Don't get discouraged if you don't hear back right away: open source maintainers are often doing this work on nights and weekends, and they can get behind on email.  You mentioned documentation:  that's a great way to get started.  It's an often overlooked component because it's not as exciting as code, and as a new person on the project, you'll be learning a lot about the code while you improve the docs.  In the OpenStack community, doc writers are treated the same as code writers to encourage people to write docs.   As for specific projects to work on, check out Open Hatch:  https://openhatch.org/search/    That organization is built to encourage open source contribution, and you can search based on language and size of bug.  Feel free to ask me questions.  I'll likely not know the answer directly, but I'm happy to help you find the right path."

If we can find a tiny doc bug to fix, that'll free up mental energy to focus on the version control and bug trackers involved.  Then your next bug can be a code fix, etc.  My first OpenStack bug was a spelling mistake:  I changed ""Restart nstances"" to ""Restart instances"" in a manual.  That's super easy, right?

I do agree many projects could have better developer on-boarding documentation, but...  I worry that you are looking for an ""easy way"" to get started. If you are unwilling to put the work into learning how to get started, then you are more likely to give up easily when the going gets tough (and it will.)  Programming (and getting your code in a good enough shape to be Open Sourced) takes a lot of work.  If you are focused on the reward (updating your resume), you are likely not to get there. Instead, focus on the journey: Pick things that you want to do, write features that you want to see, etc. When you get discouraged, you will be tempted to give up unless you're having fun.  So don't look for ""easy on-boarding"" projects. Look for projects that interest you, even if it is harder to get started.  http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2010/12/answer-to-will-you-mentor-me-is.html  Also, Open Source is all about self-motivation.  If you ""want to get into Open Source"", then Just Do It (TM). Pick something you are interested in, read everything you can, think of a feature it needs, take a stab at it, then post it on the mailing list to ask what people think. When you are knee-deep in code, people will help you much more than when you are sitting on the sidelines asking theoretical questions."

The program is organized by the Software Freedom Conservancy and was formerly organized by The GNOME Project and the GNOME Foundation.  It is open to cisgender and transgender women, as well as people of other gender identities that are minorities in open source, and to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender (a program for people in groups underrepresented in open source). Participants can be of any background and any age older than 18. Internships can focus on programming, design, documentation, marketing, or other kinds of contributions.  The program began in 2006 with a round of internships working on the GNOME desktop environment (which primarily runs on Linux), and it resumed in 2010 with internships twice a year, adding projects from other organizations starting in 2012. As of 2014, these rounds of internships have had up to 16 participating organizations, including Mozilla and Wikimedia. Funding comes from the GNOME Foundation, Google, organizations participating in the internships, and other software companies.

The value of instagram or what's app is in it's customer base and access to those customers habits. There is no way to know ahead of time which apps are going to go viral. Once an app does go viral it's next to impossible to get people to switch to a clone of it. Just because something is better doesn't mean people will switch to it. Check out this video of people picking a candy bar over a bar of silver. Those are the people you need to convince to switch from something they know to something they don't know.

opensource,3cl0li,fleker2,5,Wed Jul 8 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Open source is often mixed with proprietary to make a commercial product.  Some open source project's don't take contributions, and only develop from within a business model. The source availability provides a feedback loop in transparency and popularity. They commercialize with dual-licensing.  Then there is the good old donation model, where the people are on the copyleft, and beg for scraps. Useless model though, don't expect to sustain yourself on cold raw instant noodles while living in a cardboard box.  There are 3 main consumers to software - Customers who want a free version - Customers who want transparency and flexibility - Customers who want the best experience   These customers are not the same. Some people are tinkerer's, others are cheap, some are stuck using proprietary software as a industry standard, or they perhaps are the best implementation out there. There is room in the market for all these customers.  Linux tends to be for the free/tinkerer crowd, so 100% proprietary doesn't go so well. It's hard to put your stamp of approval on something as a company when you got millions of people changing the underlying layers constantly. Commercial support and standardization has benefits.  For example, a company has money to pay the best developers and dedicate their time to projects in a way that is best focused on the user.  Strict copyleft however needs to take what it can get. There are some incredibly talented people writing open source software, however, it's hard for them to organize and focus on the customer the same way a proprietary solution can."

Well, anyway, the idea of shortening even more the release policy seems really vague to give any conclusion. I do think that the 18 weeks cycle was very good for Firefox. If you use Firefox for more time like me and paid attention you may remember how the transition from Firefox 3.6 to 4.0 was a hell, delayed multiple times and with reduced funcionality than expected. The new release cycle matches what we expect from a modern web browser much better.  Now, the fact that they seem to want to remove XUL/XBL and use full web technologies to render the interface instead is great. So much time is spent to make HTML/CSS/JS and other web technologies fast, and they need to do everything again to XUL/XBL. I believe that modern browser UI should be just another ""web page"", something similar that what Vivaldi does (it uses Electron). After that, you simple render a window using any native widget (and should be easy, since is just a window) and you get a multi-platform UI that is consistent between OS for free, and fast since your browser should be fast in rendering HTML/CSS."

You're then secure everywhere else, since a MITM attack will generate a new warning.  Another benefit is that your Contacts and Calendar can also be hosted by the built-in ownCloud apps, so you don't need to hand your personal info over to for-profit third parties.  Whenever I take a photo or video on my phone, it's automatically backed up to my ownCloud, and you even have the option of only backing up over wifi.

You can talk about ""unauthorized copying"" or ""illegal copying"" instead.  In my opinion, the best way to fight unauthorized copying is to not sell copies of digital works, and to allow their redistribution. There are other business models that remain possible, like ""pay what you want"" or crowdfunding."
opensource,3bpmve,Calinou,3,Wed Jul 1 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"Haha, well, people do ""surf"" the web, so it could be compared to a large body of water. ;)  I hear you, and I kind of understand why you object to the word.  It's what I use for my own questionable downloading activities, so it doesn't offend me, and I don't think there's a problem with summarizing unauthorized  copying by hijacking the word for thievery on the high seas.  I just think of it as a colorful shorthand.  I don't think anyone actually thinks that software pirates operate anything like traditional ones... (do they??)  Pay what you want is exactly the kind of thing that devs could put as gateways to their free versions.  I'd like to add, that on a console that uses cartridges, there must be a very clear disclaimer that the downloaded game cannot be played without the knowledge and equipment required to flash it.  This would not only deter more people from going that route, but it would satisfy people who would, because they were going to do it anyway.  Now crowdfunding is interesting.  In theory, you don't have to sell the stuff you produce using crowdfunding funds - your whole operation could be based on convincing people to give you money to live comfortably and produce stuff and then give it away.  Is that the kind of alternative ""business model"" you refer to?  Crowdfunding can also be basically a way to pay other people to start their own business.  At that point though, crowdfunding's job is done, and ""normal"" business models take over.  I had to stop and think on ""don't sell copies of digital works"".  Because a video game is a digital work and you need to sell copies of it to make money - the only alternative is cloud-based gaming and that's never going to replace locally-computed gaming - that's 100% guaranteed.

Many useful lessons can be learned, and the biggest of all could be how valuable it is to come to consensus and learn to work together on one project, including helping where it most helps but deferring to the main developer's leadership even when you disagree with some details (voice the concerns but don't just insist on continuing the separate fork).

I think Chris sincerely thought that Gorhill was going to go and ignore everyone and discontinue feature development. I think Chris sincerely felt that he was on the spot to assert a strong future for uBlock and continue promoting it well so it wouldn't seem like it was a dying project. I think Chris saw himself as the unexpected lead of a major project and decided to boldly accept the responsibility. I think he handled many things poorly and then tried to patch things up by adjusting his presentation later.  I think Chris needs to now accept that the situation is not positive for the community now and should unilaterally work to merge the projects again and give up on his fork if he can't find a way to merge. I think he still has lessons to learn. I still think there is no real evidence of malice.  I disagree with you strongly that my saying Chris did not have malice means I am ""papering over the hurts of others"". I respect Gorhill greatly, but the situation was indeed confusing. Gorhill couldn't have expected this outcome, but he didn't communicate the situation well initially, nor has he handled it optimally since (although I don't think he's in the wrong really, he could do better in addressing the situation).  Chris said repeatedly that if Gorhill asked for the master back, he would oblige. Has Gorhill done that?

Really the main thing now is convincing indie devs to support it.  Oh and you're never going to beat piracy, well at least not without Microsoft/Valve level resources so don't even try. Go with a Patreon-type model (suggested $0/$1/$2/$5 month per user, proportionally-split to devs based on time spent in games) and maybe incorporate some TF2-type ideas like selling pure cosmetics. Heck it's a bit devilish but you could probably even sell the ""opportunity"" for supporters to be beta testers/ first access to new maps/content.  I think there is space for a completely free ""steam-like"" client on Raspberry Pi for little hobbyist games.  I think if someone tries to monetize it (""now I can quit my day job!"") it'll just end up as a worse-performing variant of the always-on DRM, in-app purchase hellscapes we already have."

It will also be far easier for people to distribute their games this way, which will attract more developers.   I think people would be very interested.  People have a lot of nostalgia for old physical media.  I believe we could make it easy for developers who want to bring back that special feeling of holding a game in your hands to bring something to market.  Is storing everything on a single SD card far easier?  It precludes multiple very large games, and I want developers to be free to make very large games.  There's no point to limiting them unnecessarily when storage is so cheap.  On the other hand, the biggest size card available is, what, 1TB?  And it's horrendously expensive.  People are forced to select a size ahead of time.  If you get a much more realistic 128GB card, that means 32 4GB games.  Not counting game savedata space.  Which I think developers would appreciate having as much as they want of.  Next, how does a purchase work?  Do you go online?  If it's on the device, this requires both game selection menu / file management program and a built-in store that must be run by someone, and updated regularly, at least for security purposes.  If it's on a PC, do you store the game on the SD card on the PC, or does it notify the server to download the game to the console which would install it itself?  If games are commonly in the gigabytes, a download is not attractive to a large number of people with download caps and slow internet connections.  Even I, having a good cheap internet service, don't appreciate failed downloads due to wifi issues, modem resets, internet and power outages - or slow downloads, due to congestion.  I wish I could order a game and have it on my doorstep the next day or even in the next hour.  I wish I could go to a real physical store where I can instantly try out games that they have behind a counter, and take it home right away to play with friends and family.  This experience is lost with online.  Third, it opens the door to malicious programs wiping cards or, in the case of there being a firmware, installing viruses.  On the surface, a single storage medium seems to save time and money, but if you dig into the idea a little bit, it's actually pretty questionable how much time and money is being saved, not to mention complication for the consumer and a general detached feeling to the experience.  Can we do it with physical media cheaply enough?  This is the question I'm pondering, and am most interested in.  Take that out, and there's no point!     I'm not sure that piracy should be a concern with a machine like this. Most of the developers attracted to a machine like this will probably want their games to be open source anyways.   Anything that gets popular enough eventually gets pirated.  It should attract many developers and everyday consumers, not just hobbyists, otherwise I'm not interested anymore.  So we need to be thinking about it.   USB should definitely be used for the controllers. Let people use whatever controllers they want, but have a controller that they can buy when they buy the console (either designed by you or use another companies controller).   USB would be nice.  Here is what concerns me though.  If you support any USB controller, driver support and button configuration.  How do you configure the controller?  Does the system remember your settings?  This brings a need for a firmware / internal storage, which I'm hoping to avoid.     A USB standard controller seems ideal.  USB is good standard tech.  Maybe XBOX/360 controllers can be supported in addition to a standard one that uses the exact same button assignments.  Everyone and their dog has an XBOX controller already, so why not.   I think you have an interesting idea here but I think you would have trouble attracting a large enough user base to make it work. If you ditch the physical games idea then I think you have a shot but at that point its basically just a cheap computer intended to be used for a specific purpose.   I see your point, but I think you're forgetting that computers typically involve a lot more setup and maintenance than a game console.  PC gamers take it for granted, but I think people will jump at the chance to buy something that promises simplicity and delivers higher quality games thanks to a singular focus on gaming in the SDK.  This is not so much to save developers from extra things like dealing with an OS or online things, but so that the SDK can be better because we the console developers focused on that instead of all the bells and whistles one associates with consoles (and PC games) these days.    That being said I do like the idea and would be interested in working on a project like this, or at least hashing out enough details to see if its feasible.   Great to hear!

People have issues running games, there are delays due to login issues, updates (both from Steam notifications and the OS bugging you), and the process for getting a game on the platform is tedious.    Not to mention there's been a sort of devaluation of games in recent years, with Steam sales leading to people buying more games than they can actually play in their lifetime.

Additionally, you can tune the shit out of both the JVM and UMS to reduce resource utilization.   This could save you a few cycles on VM startup and a few megs of memeory but not much overall. The reason being none of the heavy lifting (transcoding) is actually done in Java. This is shipped out to compiled C/C++ libs.   So what is eating memory is the actual buffer of media transcoded on the fly. This can be reduced via configuration or by just re-encoding your media to better match your playback device.   Same is true for CPU for the most part.   The JVM does have overhead for sure but so does C#/mono runtime. Both C# and Java are using JIT compilers and are managed memory. Additionally their performance is pretty comparable for the majority of tasks.   Being written in C# doesn't make an app less bloated or more efficient with CPU cycles just by being in C#.

Most DAWs will all do pretty well the same thing (at least in basic terms, anyway) just in different ways. Lots of it comes down to which software has the best workflow for you, and what you like the layout of.   I want to like Ardour, but the workflow just doesn't do it for me. You also can't use all your favourite Windows VSTs, so that is a huge knock against it or any Linux DAW.  I have used it many times for quick and dirty get an idea down without having to reboot into Windows, but for editing and mixing or recording that I actually want to spend time with it's all Cubase for me."
opensource,3arh2b,poppinsmac,3,Tue Jun 23 00:35:26 2015 UTC,"The carla-rack plugin has a windows vst bridge for linux. It's a bit of a workaround, but it's almost seamless to use with ardour, and it works with most windows vst's, I personally haven't found any that haven't worked."

opensource,3arh2b,SweetPye,2,Tue Jun 23 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"Reaper gets the upper hand automatically from me because of VSTs, but I think I prefer it in general too. Just a bit more intuitive to use, as well as a nicer look.  By nicer look I don't just mean icons, I mean how it's all put together. Looks are important in a busy program because it helps you easily find what you're looking for. I wouldn't say that Ardour is counterintuitive or anything, just that Reaper is a bit better - more polished feeling maybe. Reaper is also very lightweight both in file size and resources. I haven't put enough tracks at once into Ardour to know but Reaper is lighter than Cubase which is a plus.  They can both be used for free (price) though, so check out both and see what you like! After a couple hours with each you'll quickly start to gravitate towards one, but this is /r/opensource and I would assume most users here are Linux users. Reaper doesn't run on Linux, so if you don't want to be rebooting into Windows then Ardour is your only option. If you're a Windows user as well though get both as well as Cubase.   A Reaper license will cost you $60, Cubase Elements 8 is $100 so it's actually not that far off. Elements doesn't have all the full options of their full blown product, so try that trial out first to make sure it does all that you want it to do."
opensource,3arh2b,poppinsmac,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:12:32 2015 UTC,"I dual-boot with Ubuntu and Windows 7, so that's not a problem.  I actually purchased Reaper after I considered the Cubase 7 Elements that came with my audio interface (Steinberg UR-22) but it was way too limited than what I was used to on Cubase 5, so that's when I made the move to Reaper.  I was just wondering if Ardour has an advantage over Reaper besides being natively supported on Linux. I also think that Reaper can be run on Linux but Windows VSTs won't work, etc.  Now I'm torn between Bitwig (supported on Linux) and Reason 8 for making music.

I assume if you're talking about Reason and FL Studio that you are doing more electronic music? They are both different tools compared to Reaper and Ardour, but maybe FL Studio has come around to being a more fully fledged DAW, I just haven't tried it in a while so I don't know. Either way, if my assumption is correct then I don't have much advice as it's just not my area. I spend most of my time setting up microphones, getting good live sounds, editing and mixing to...extremely mediocre results. The electronic thing has never been my cup of tea, but I used to love playing with Reason (version....2.5 I think?) but it's never been my actual style.  The latest Cubase Elements does everyting I want it to do, but I can see it being too restrictive for others.  edit Never tried Bitwig, again becuase it looks more geared to the electronic artists, not the recording artists which leaves me with too many features I will never use and not enough of what I will, but I haven't actually tried it."

I have an Onyx 1640i and with Jack I can run in and out from 3 different points on the board and loop things back around. I send software synths and signals from Qsynth (fluidsynth) to my outboard compressors and synths all the time for example. It would be a much bigger pain without Jack and a real patchbay.

Take for example the fact that, when in a voting booth, we can be fairly certain that you're there alone, and nobody is forcing you to vote for anyone else than who you want to vote for.

My biggest concern with online voting is the security of the users machine, I don't know if I trust random users to use their own computers for instance. All you need is a reasonably sophisticated botnet to control a large portion of the vote, and with what is at play doing so would certainly be attempted. Would that outweigh the corruption at present though? I still don't think it would, and that also assumes there is no action, public, private, or via govt, to mitigate those concerns which there certainly would be. I kind of touched on it before, but I think the biggest mitigation of that is the ability to verify your vote by logging into the site afterward.   Now if you did that on only one computer, which is hacked, then it's untrusted, but most people have access to 2,3+ devices so all you need is one clean device to discover the flaw and through an automated process it would be rather easily to correct. That leads to a bigger problem though in that I suspect the masses would rather have a severely flawed voting system, so long as the flaws were hidden from them and they could pretend it was nearly perfect, than a minorly flawed voting system where every flaw was public knowledge and easily verified.

You just write code, then publish it under an open source license. That's how every successful project started.   Where can I find people which will start a project with me?   You don't find them, they find you. Or rather your code.   There are two reasons why open source starts with code, not an idea:  1) Before the project is coded, it's easy to talk about features and architecture, because everyone can imagine anything. People will talk endlessly because talk is cheap. Everyone has a (different) opinion, but you won't know who is worth listening to. 90% of the discussions will be a waste of time.  Once you have code, things are much easier: Ignore talk and only look at code. ""You should use an event loop"" is worthless advice because there are thousands of choices to be made, some of them could be worse than what you have. ""I rewrote it as an event loop, it was way more simple/complex than I thought"" is worth discussing.  2) Going from ""no code, all talk"" to ""code"" will cause massive churn in the people who want to participate in the project. Why? Coding requires many language/architecture choices. These choices will attract some coders and repel most others (""What, you didn't use my favorite language/framework/library?

If you don't have code, you're building a committee, not an open source project."

Then, post the code online and talk about it at meetups, hackathons, your work place, your Twitter feed, FaceBook, and just about every medium you can get. Also be sure to build enough documentation for somebody to easily get involved in the project, or at least to install it on their own systems."

opensource,3a89ip,daltonfromroadhouse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"There's an entry about this FSF's GPL FAQ:   If I write a plug-in to use with a GPL-covered program, what requirements does that impose on the licenses I can use for distributing my plug-in? (#GPLAndPlugins)  It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.  If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means you must license the plug-in under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and distribute it with source code in a GPL-compliant way.  If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.   That being said, I don't see how that prevents you from writing a GPL plugin that accesses a paid subscription service.  You'd need to publish the plugin source, but that doesn't mean you also have to publish your login credentials or API key for the service."
opensource,3a89ip,Rhomboid,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"I've always thought the whole ""if you fork then you are OK"" idea a bit goofy. Under that reasoning if the main app's plugin API doesn't fork a process then all you have to do is make a plugin that's loads a plugin via fork. This ""plugin plugin"" would have to be released under a GPL license but any plugin it loads wouldn't."
opensource,3a89ip,jecxjo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"A plugin running as a separate process can't make direct function calls into the main program, nor can it access the main process' memory, so it has to do all its communication over IPC, such as via sockets.  That means you have to invent a whole network protocol for all communication, and you have to serialize and deserialize all the data and commands passing between them.  And then you have to implement both ends of that, one in your out-of-process plugin and one in your GPL plugin stub.  That's no small feat, it's a lot of work.  It's not something that you get for free.  If you're willing to do all that work then you really have written a totally separate program that doesn't share any code with the main program and you aren't subject to its license.  (Otherwise it would be like saying that a browser and a HTTP server have to be licensed the same, because they're both speaking HTTP to each other.)"
opensource,3a89ip,Rhomboid,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"I understand the complexity of my idea. What I was getting at was that by just adding in this layer the rule changes while the actual functionality does not. By adding this layer have you now circumvented the licensing intent of the main application developer?  I think the best bet is to contact the original developers to see what they intended for library/plugin licensing. They should have a defined statement on how plugins can be licensed and if they don't then they should probably generate one.  As for OP's situation, the GPL does not restrict the sale of code as long as the license is in tact and all source is publicly distributed. This is how you can run GPL'd code as a service and charge for it. All the code has to be given to anyone who asks including your changes. So adding  a GPL'd plugin to a paid service shouldn't be a problem. Could someone download OP's plugin and make a competing business? Yes."

On one hand you want to support software and then you're talking about supporting YouTubers for videos..  Check out BountySource – it may not be exactly what you want now, but their Salt (beta) will enable recurring donations to opensource projects. In addition, you can post bounties or e.g. bugs etc. which get paid when the bugs are fixed straight to devs."
opensource,3a5ps5,MartinAllien,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:15:10 2015 UTC,I was asking if there is any service that functions like patreon does for youtube but instead of supporting youtubers you support your favorite software projects. I apologize if I phrased it in a way that was confusing.
opensource,3a5ps5,MartinAllien,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"Well it always depends on the devs themselves, what kind of donations they accept. I know devs that use Patreon, other BountySource, many accept Bitcoin etc.. and if they don't, just contact them and they'll find a way for you to donate, I'm sure :)"
opensource,3a5ps5,mlinksva,-1,Thu Jun 18 11:18:54 2015 UTC,Snowdrift.coop will be kind of like that. See https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/othercrowdfunding#subscription for some analysis of Patreon and other subscription-like options.
