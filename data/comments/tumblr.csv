It goes like:  It has been reported that some victims of extreme trauma, would retreat into a fantasy world from which they could not WAKE UP. In this catatonic state, the victim lived in a world just like their normal one, except they werenât in danger or dying.  The mind of the victim would often try to WAKE UP the victim by leaving hints that they were actually asleep.  Sometimes it would be a handwritten note, sometimes it would be something they would read on a message board.  It would tell them about their condition, and tell them to WAKE UP. Even then, it would often take months until they were ready to discard their fantasy world and WAKE UP.   Please WAKE UP.  Can you hear us?  Please.  Please just WAKE UP."

He can discern what others are saying if he concentrates and there's little background noise, but it's much easier for him to read lips or for others to sign if they know how to."
tumblr,3dvx33,cupcakefairy227,8,Mon Jul 20 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"Originally, Hawkeye was partially deafened in his 80s miniseries because he used a sonic arrow on himself to counteract a sonic weapon that made people bloodthiristy and psycho (the villain Crossfire was going to use it to cause the superhero community to destroy itself).   He, along with the Avengers and Fantastic Four, were sort of killed in the 90s by Onslaught (a fusion of Professor X and Magneto's psyches), but they were resurrected on an alternate earth (long and not very good story) and he had his hearing restored as a result. They were eventually brought back to the main earth, but his hearing was still fixed  More recently, he was stabbed in the eardrums, so he went back to hearing aids. I think it was later revealed that he always had hearing trouble, but I'm not sure."

I wish there was something else, though, because ""my pleasure"" sounds too groveling to me. When I worked customer service I would either say ""you're very welcome"" (which seemed to break the sarcastic edge) or ""no, thank you.""

tumblr,3dtg91,coldneverbotheredme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"I do agree with that, to a certain extent.

It's usually some variant of the intention of ""think nothing of it"", again, tending towards the whole ""any decent human would do this for another human"" vibe. Apparently, though, some of the older generations huff when such deeds are downplayed rather than acknowledged and accepted as an extension of oneself (like I said elsewhere in these comments, someone, I think it was my former landlady, come to mind as having reacted poorly to ""no problem"").  As for the ""you're welcome"" as sarcastic when an expected thanks is not given, I do that occasionally, but so do my mom and grandma, so I don't know if that one's as non-transferable."

If I never planned on buying the book in the first place, I don't feel so bad. My sophomore year I would just do assignments with friends who had the book or would borrow it from the library.

The whole course got the PDF and lot's of people learned cool stuff.   Illegal? Yes. Unethical? Probably yes. However as a piss poor guy I will always share knowledge because it's free power for everyone. Most respected computer guys from a non upper-middle class family learned through illegal ebooks... Actually I bought books I because of pirating... it's not too unfamiliar with music.

I've recommended /r/scholar to a friend in Biology after he hold me about the process to aquire a paper from a journal... Our small university paid 100kâ¬ to Elsevier to have access to a collection of journals that was hardly used... the journals that they wanted to have where not available... either you pay 100kâ¬ for the whole pack or leave it... that's scary."

If you're approaching it as the latter, the approach is to dive wildly across all the lanes at the last possible moment - left, right, or straight through depending on where there's least traffic, then spearing violently back the other way if there's any danger of having to give way. Advanced lunatics will do a sneaky right-lane-to-360 or left-right-wiggle across the center to force their adversaries to yield. I'm beginning to think it's part of some sort of secret competitive event, with prizes.

That's also how I would describe the term, but unfortunately a lot of people on reddit and the internet in general seem to use it rather differently - to the point where everything that talks about social issues/ racism/ sexism etc becomes ""SJW bullshit"". I've seen people react to ""Hey, maybe calling that person a faggot is kind of a shit thing to say"" with basically ""Fuck you, you SJW! Dont try to censor my free speech with your bullshit!"". Or people dismissing the concept of being trans because ""lol SJW"".  etc.   The term has become a parody of itself a this point, which is a shame, because the people it used to describe (teenage ""activists"" that totally miss the point and attack people like Joss Whedon, Stephen Colbert or Macklemore rather than real sexists, racists or homophobes) are apparently still a huge thing on Twitter, Tumblr etc."

tumblr,3dk6eg,Malak77,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"It contrasts trans. It comes from Latin (like Gallia Tansalpina is Gaul across the Alps, while Gallia Cisalpina is Gaul in the Roman side of the Alps.) In the 1990s people started using cisgender to contrast against transgender, cisman vs transman, ciswoman vs transwoman, etc. to avoid the cisnormativity of using plain gender/man/woman/etc., especially in sociological discussions, and the subtle transphobia of simply referring to non-trans people as ''normal.'' Basically, if you're cis, your gender identity matches your sex. It generally goes by primary sexual characteristics as identified or assigned at birth, so people with chromosomes that don't necessarily match their primary sexual characteristics (XXY, XYY, androgen insensitivity syndrome) are still considered cis."

tumblr,3dk6eg,Freddies_Mercury,4,Fri Jul 17 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Some of these answers are confusing, let me be a bit more clear. There are three concepts here. First is biological sex, which is determined by chromosomes (XY or XX) and physical anatomy. Then there is gender identity. In the past, the two concepts were interchangeable. Now that we understand more about psychology and human experience, many people recognize that one's gender identity may not match their physical sex. Caitlin Jenner is a transgender woman. She identifies as a woman, prefers female pronouns, but is biologically male. Most biological males identify as male. Such men are referred to as cisgender rather than transgender. The third concept is sexuality, or sexual attraction. Although many people may assume sexual attraction based on these identities, they are actually separate concepts. Caitlin Jenner identifies as female, but she may not be physically attracted to men. I say ""may not"" because I honestly don't know if she is or not. I know a person who was born biologically male, identifies as a transgender woman, and is sexually attracted to women. Some may say this makes her a lesbian, but I believe a lesbian is a cisgender woman who is attracted to women. I also know a biological male who is cisgender and is attracted to men. This is the complicated definition of a gay man. A straight man would be a biological male who is cisgender and is attracted to women. Sexuality is so much more complicated that the binary male and female. Some may be attracted specifically to transgender women who have retained their male anatomy, for example. Some people are bisexual, or even pansexual. Hell, some people are asexual.   tl;dr: Biological sex is your anatomy and chromosomes, but gender and sexual attraction are independently variable for each person."
tumblr,3dk6eg,jedimaster4007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"The trouble with this definition is two few people have had their chromosomes tested, and too many people just don't line up with XX or XY. There are many XY women, at least a few have even given birth. There are people with XXY, etc. etc. It's not as simple as male or female.  And I'm sorry, but why would a woman who is attracted to only women not be a lesbian?"
tumblr,3dk6eg,Rrroxy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:16 2015 UTC,"It's true, there are other possibilities with chromosomes besides XX women and XY men. It's hard to really cover all the complexity of sex and genetics without writing a dissertation. I only meant to keep things simple for the sake of differentiating between sex, gender, and sexuality.  Regarding the definition of lesbian, you're right, what I intended to emphasize was that if a trans woman is only attracted to women, a third party coming in to say ""so that makes you a lesbian, right?"" is kinda missing the point. A person's sexual identity is not decided by others, the trans woman in question may not prefer to identify as a lesbian, or she may.  The truth is, I'm really no expert by any means, but I am supportive of those who don't fit in the gender binary."

Ditto for sexism, homophobia, etc.  It's really hard to be white, straight, male, or cis without unintentionally picking up a significant degree racism, homophobia, sexism and/or transphobia respectively. Studies have shown that negative associations with race and gender persist even when a person consciously rejects the ideas of racism and sexism. It's probably safe to say that pretty much every white person (and many other people) carry racism with them in their subconscious. It's not a condemnation of them, so long as they do what they can to reject prejudice and oppression, but it's something we should all admit and confront in ourselves and those around us."

With that point and the point made in the quote about the one person in the world you are helping is yourself and that it's okay, I feel that is a little bit of a cop-out. I don't believe that every one has the ability or opportunity to make the world a better place, but I do feel that everyone should at least make some attempt at making the world a better place than how they got it for the future, and only worrying about yourself as the endeavor of this doesn't really push the world always forward, but it can. I will also point out that there is no self-less act, which must also be kept in consideration when someone is trying to make the work a better place, because in reality they will gain something through that process no matter the action. I also know by my opportunity and experience in my environment that someone is being oppressed through my benefit, which I don't feel I can totally cop-out of, but must understand that in my position as to why I experience benefit.

Further, those African and south Asian peoples which fought in the war did so at the behest of their European conquerors and their lands were used as battleground against the European powers. If their point was that it was a white European empire vs. white European empire conflict, then I see their logic.

tumblr,3de0im,Pickup-Styx,4,Wed Jul 15 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"I'm about 90% sure that the arrow thing was a clever line someone put in after they played as an archer.  I wound up with enemies with knees full of arrows. Because of the way NPC's crouch behind their shields, their entire body is covered by the shield. You could shoot their arm or the top of their head sometimes, but by far the easiest shot to land was therefore the leg. With a high archery skill, you'd wind up with opponents with knees full of arrows before they ever reached you.  Of course, the best shot by far was the one with the sneak attack bonus, but once that was spoiled, knees all the way. I didn't even realize I was doing it until most of the way through the game.  So I think there's more to that line than that."

tumblr,3db8el,Belrus,16,Wed Jul 15 03:04:36 2015 UTC,Perfect example of Pronoia:   Pronoia is a neologism that is defined as the opposite state of mind to paranoia: having the sense that there is a conspiracy that exists to help the person.
tumblr,3db8el,yurigoul,10,Wed Jul 15 10:55:05 2015 UTC,"For some reason, it never occurred to me that paranoia refers specifically to negative conspiracy..."
tumblr,3db8el,JackFlynt,8,Wed Jul 15 11:18:02 2015 UTC,"I think with paranoia you are overly careful and distrusting, with pronoia however you are always thinking someone is watching out for you so you get careless and too trustful for your own good. But if you look at it from an NLP perspective it might actually work .... if NLP were a solid thing that is....  Anyway - pronoia people might actually live happier lives, but the paranoia ones live probably longer lives.   Now, which one would you choose?"
tumblr,3db8el,yurigoul,6,Wed Jul 15 11:23:34 2015 UTC,Pronoia. Definitely.
tumblr,3db8el,BeaSk8r117,2,Wed Jul 15 15:38:53 2015 UTC,Good choice - you are now subscribed to pronoia facts - where invisible people try to help you.  Did you know that people with Pronoia live short but very happy lives?

tumblr,3db8el,BeaSk8r117,2,Wed Jul 15 16:18:16 2015 UTC,Did you know that right now your dead ancestors are floating around you so they can watch out for you and help prevent all kinds of things that could go wrong?  Start sacrificing to them now because they deserve it. Call 01-ANCESTORWORSHIP and order your very own altar (live goat not included)

tumblr,3dea2h,Lots42,5,Thu Jul 16 08:54:15 2015 UTC,"As a film student, I'm guessing he was a PA and the actor died of a drug overdose the day before production. With the budget and crew list already in place, the director looked at him and said ""you're on kid"". At that point michael began to complain about the blinding lighting in his eye. The director only replied ""Shut up and take it bitch"". And that's most likely how Michael Cera became a star."

Then the English teachers got them and thought, ""oh, cool"" and proceeded to use them as thousand-dollar projectors.

The commenter is just calling it how they see it, and they see rich white people getting away with stupid things when they shouldn't.

If you're feeding a family with such low amounts of money it's not just price, it's also time. It's easier to come home after ridiculously long work hours and throw stuff pre-made into the oven/microwave.   Now, there are a lot of work arounds. But I can sympathize with not having the time or energy to sit down and calculate healthier meals with the money available. I eat a lot healthier now that I have a decent job.

tumblr,3d6gsp,FedoraRepublic,7,Tue Jul 14 07:19:02 2015 UTC,Downvoted for lack of actual contribution.
tumblr,3d6gsp,TrishyMay,-2,Tue Jul 14 07:59:22 2015 UTC,I did contribute.
tumblr,3d6gsp,FedoraRepublic,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about how much things cost but is that enough money for food for one person? Or a whole family? Because my boyfriend and I spend about $50 a month on good and we eat relatively healthy stuff (that is, not all grease and junk). This seems reasonable to me, but I realize there are different situations for different people..."
tumblr,3d6gsp,Esosorum,6,Tue Jul 14 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"There is no way you can feed two people all their food in a day for $12.50 a week, where do you live??"
tumblr,3d6gsp,snellk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"Austin, Texas. $50 worth of veggies, meat, and rice/pasta lasts us awhile. Our preferences, needs, and whatnot might be different but a head of lettuce is like fifty cents and goes a long way.   Also I've never lived on food stamps so I don't know how it works and I'm not trying to say ""oh stop complaining, it's not that bad"" or anything."
tumblr,3d6gsp,Esosorum,7,Tue Jul 14 13:31:11 2015 UTC,You also have to factor in that many people especially in depressed economic areas live in food deserts. These are places where there isn't access to a place selling fresh fruits and vegetables within a reasonable distance for someone without a car to get too. It's really hard to eat healthy when you can't get access to healthy food.
tumblr,3d6gsp,RossPerotVan,2,Tue Jul 14 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, and a problem I've never had to deal with."
tumblr,3d6gsp,Esosorum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada and I have a relatively healthy diet. Lots of carbs- bread, pasta, cereals. Not much meat - too expensive. Fruits and vegetables. I try to budget for 200 a month, however I'm usually too poor so I wind up with 100 dollars worth of ramen and expired bagels."
tumblr,3d6gsp,missy_m00,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:27:37 2015 UTC,"""At least not in my country"". Yeah, yours. Cost of living varies immensely between countries, the USA's relatively high. Factor in that supporting not one person, but a family, and yeah. It's not much."
tumblr,3d6gsp,cheesestrings76,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:01:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought they were pretty similar. And I totally overlooked the family aspect. Yeah, feeding a family on that amount in my country is also pretty meagre.  I'm a student, so I immediately just thought of one person."
tumblr,3d6gsp,peachykeen__,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:23:06 2015 UTC,"hey i'm basically a socialist so I have no problem with addressing the income inequality issues in our country, but personally I spend $120 on groceries per month and I barely even try to keep the price down. If I was actually trying I'm sure I could get it even lower. And I live in a major city. This is for one person however.   Also this lady is an asshole."
tumblr,3d6gsp,aalitheaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean I spend a good bit less than that (around $75/mo. in Baltimore) and the way I read it that was part of the point i.e. another reason this bitch should get punched.   But you and everyone else saying they spend less than $133 is getting downvoted to hell (???) so I suppose I'm wrong. I've always lived within 45 minutes of where I currently am though, and food isn't scarce so I have no other perspective. I suspect $133 is a really tight budget most everywhere else, especially to maintain long-term."
tumblr,3d6gsp,coldinalaska,2,Tue Jul 14 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"Typically, food stamps/similar systems are for families. I'm guessing most of the people commenting (as this is a tumblr subreddit) are single and young without families to support.   I'm in college and I live off of less than $133 a month too, but if it was between me and a second person (or three, or four) I doubt I could keep it that low while filling stomachs."
tumblr,3d6gsp,Gallein,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's people who are mad they spend too much of their income on food? Who knows.   And I don't know about it being that tight, besides places like NYC and San Francisco or wherever.. I live in Minneapolis, and like I said this is me barely trying. I basically eat anything I want, and I keep it pretty healthy. I just don't eat at restaurants often at all. If I focused even more on beans, rice, etc. it'd be even more affordable."

tumblr,3dce0h,gereffi,3,Wed Jul 15 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"I think most people just don't care about the other people's comments. Unless you're purposefully looking to inject (your brand of) humor into the comments, you're not really going to have any reason to change them. It's too much effort for no gain.  There is a bit of a problem with people removing the OP's comments, especially on photos where the original caption is giving credit to the OP. (I've seen this a lot on the nature photography parts of Tumblr, where I spend most of my time.) So sometimes you'll see people add something to address that on the end of their caption -- something like ""Please don't remove credit."" People tend to leave those alone, but you'll always find users who just don't care and delete it anyway."
tumblr,3dce0h,ActualGuesticles,2,Thu Jul 16 20:53:15 2015 UTC,Seems like a pretty big flaw. I fail to understand the pros of having a system where a user can edit another user's comments.
tumblr,3dce0h,ActualGuesticles,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"I think the idea behind it was that people could add their own thoughts and everyone would contribute positively and it would be so great!! But instead people just take advantage of it. I'd say they probably won't ever change it because now it's a pretty ingrained part of the reblogging system. If you change if/how users add to posts, they'll throw a hissy fit."

tumblr,3d6aw5,Jokwin,2,Tue Jul 14 00:38:31 2015 UTC,My ex always talks about stuff like this. The whole topic does have some god points but the not coloring babies doesn't make sense. They look alike why not do something to separate them.
tumblr,3d6aw5,invalid_character,8,Tue Jul 14 11:34:59 2015 UTC,"Why do they need to be separated? They are babies. It's not like biological sex has any important effect on their world at that point. In fact, the only effect it does have is helping to establish gender stereotypes from day one. Which is really just useless."
tumblr,3d6aw5,CanadaHaz,4,Tue Jul 14 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with that in its entirety. But I don't think babies are enforcing any gender stereotypes and it should be looked on a case by case based if the level of gender specific roles thought is to the extreme. We have to remember that while in the search for equality, we should understand that it's not wrong for a male to want to do male things or a girl to do girl things. We should promote that it's available for them without judgement and not damn a parent for giving his son a truck. The baby doesn't care and probably won't remember."
tumblr,3d6aw5,invalid_character,6,Tue Jul 14 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"The babies aren't enforcing the stereotypes.  They having the stereotypes enforced on them. People treat babies differenly depending on the gender they think the baby is.  From day one, literally, they are told ""boys are x and do y"" and ""girls a and do b."" The objective behind gender neutral clothing for young children is to give them as much freedom to decide for themselves what they like before they are exposed to too much stereotyping by the rest of society."
tumblr,3d6aw5,CanadaHaz,4,Tue Jul 14 18:16:33 2015 UTC,Then teach the parents. We aren't harming society or helping it by changing the color of babies clothes. If that is going to be the big victory then that is disappointing. Fight the real fight for gender equality and go for the people who are paying women less. But changing colors on baby clothes? It's a big waste of effort for little victory.
tumblr,3d6aw5,invalid_character,5,Tue Jul 14 19:25:58 2015 UTC,It's not just the parents though.  What it comes down to is there is literally no logical reason why babies have to be colour coded. Little girls aren't going to implode if they wear blue and little boys aren't going to melt if they wear pink. And neither is really going to care at all for a few years.

We would also go fishing and camping and stuff like that :)   Edit: I thought I'd quickly clarify, man hunt is when you have one seeker and the rest hide. When the seeker finds someone they become part of the seeking team. We didn't hunt people with knives :P I swear...."

The thing is, I don't watch that stuff or it would have happened more times. I had a similar experience where my sister (who loves horror movies) was asked by her best friend to go to the movies with her and a guy because she didn't know him well and wanted to hang out with him but was nervous to go alone. We were fairly young at the time, my sister was around 14 which would have made me around 15. She didn't want to be the third wheel alone so she coerced me into coming. When we arrive I find out we are seeing a horror film called Black Christmas. Don't look it up I am warning you. Apparently this movie was awful and cheesy and not scary at all according to critics and also my sister. I spent half the time hiding my face and the other half watching in terror. I didn't sleep for days on end because of this film. I dreaded going to bed at night all through the day for weeks. This is an incredibly gory film but it takes much less than that for me to be disturbed. It isn't even that I think it will happen to me or something it is just that I get such an awful feeling and I can't stop thinking about it."

tumblr,3cwwvi,whippoorwont,21,Sat Jul 11 22:05:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Obama! isn't as bad as you might first think. It subtly communicates brilliant characterization though casual dialogue- you might want to read it twice to catch all of it - as well as featuring an incredible twist ending and memorable character arcs. I can confidently say that it's the best crossover within the Putin-Obama shipping circles. Here's an excerpt from the first chapter that I really liked:     ""wtf is putin doin here???????"" obama questionsed, but of course, thi s presedent aint gonna let his id fall into the hands of that loser.   This can be interpreted as simply verbalizing Obama's wrath towards Putin, but this excerpt in fact foreshadows Obama's insecurities when being around him.   If you didn't enjoy the story, I'd recommend vlad/barack one shot yaoi lemon M hot sexii, a coming-of-age/supernatural short story focusing on the life of a teenage Obama who has recently moved into the unfamiliar country of Russia, and his befriending of Putin, a man who has been given a second chance after death as a ghost. It's one of the more well-written stories in the circles (possibly enough to beat the aforementioned Thanks, Obama!).   I'd also like to point out that Dear God, I just saw Obama cheating on Putin! shouldn't be counted as a story, since the author clearly states that he/she posted the work for testing purposes only."

tumblr,3cv9nn,Peteolicious,78,Sat Jul 11 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"Cheating is defined by the relationship I think. For example, it isn't cheating if you're both swingers and are into that kinda thing. If one person kisses someone that isn't their partner. Knowing it would break their partners heart if they found out, it's cheating."
tumblr,3cv9nn,Alliewonka,61,Sat Jul 11 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"For anyone still having trouble with this, here's how it works, it's reaaaaally easy.  Cheating is defined as breaking the rules. The rules in a relationship are defined by its two (or more) participants. There. If you do something that your SO doesn't want you to do without his/her approval, that's cheating."
tumblr,3cv9nn,Teraka,6,Sat Jul 11 18:00:34 2015 UTC,This right here is the perfect answer!
tumblr,3cv9nn,besaolli,7,Sat Jul 11 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"The rule in my relationship is that if you feel like you couldn't come home and tell me about it, you probably shouldn't be doing it. Granted, I am poly so if my boyfriend came home and told me about a girl he met, I'd probably high five him."

tumblr,3cv9nn,kavien,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"Well yeah but that goes without saying I think. What I mean is, if you know (as in have permission) that your partner is ok with something then it isn't cheating. Sleeping with someone when your partner is all into that obviously isn't cheating but to other relationships that stuff will break it."
tumblr,3cv9nn,Alliewonka,5,Sun Jul 12 09:33:32 2015 UTC,I agree with this. My fiancÃ© has made it very clear that I'm allowed to kiss/sleep with women if I want to. In fact he often tries to encourage it. So if I chose to do that I wouldn't be cheating as he has expressly said it's ok for me to.
tumblr,3cv9nn,Weasley_is_our_king1,2,Sat Jul 11 09:28:00 2015 UTC,"My rule is if you aren't comfortable doing in front of your SO, then you probably shouldn't be doing it."

tumblr,3cv9nn,ToThePint,-8,Sun Jul 12 02:29:26 2015 UTC,The point is some people are more open to those things.   One man may be crushed (hurt) if his wife or girlfriend has lesbian sex. Another man may not mind at all. But a good slap hurts everyone; regardless of which hand is used.

tumblr,3cv9c3,Dontblameme1,11,Sat Jul 11 11:33:14 2015 UTC,Acctually you kind of got me wrong there. Or i said it in the wrong way. I don't mind people taking kids to church or pride parades. For some its part of their family life. But what i don't like is adults making kids wear signs spouting stuff or get them to say things that adults have obviously taught them to say.
tumblr,3cv9c3,roninjedi,-14,Sat Jul 11 13:54:49 2015 UTC,For some its part of their family life.   How is that a valid argument? What if being in a cult is a part of someone's family life? You are incredibly naive if you think indoctrination of children only starts at wearing signs or being coaxed into saying things.
tumblr,3cv9c3,Dontblameme1,9,Sat Jul 11 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Well if a kid grows up with two dads or two moms then the idea of gay parents, gay love, and the lgbt community will be part of their family life. Same if they grow up and their dad is a preacher. There is a difference between indoctrination and exposing the child to something that is a part of their culture or heritage."
tumblr,3cv9c3,roninjedi,-12,Sat Jul 11 15:01:06 2015 UTC,I still think it's harmful to expose children to religion.
tumblr,3cv9c3,Dontblameme1,7,Sat Jul 11 15:02:21 2015 UTC,Ohh so its only for religion and not for something like the LGBT. That seems kind of two faced.
tumblr,3cv9c3,roninjedi,-14,Sat Jul 11 15:07:10 2015 UTC,Nope. LGBT isn't about a fantasy man in the sky with these morals you MUST abide by. Countless people have not been killed in the name of LGBT. Religion is fucking harmful. LGBT isn't.
tumblr,3cv9c3,Dontblameme1,13,Sat Jul 11 15:08:54 2015 UTC,Ok mate we aren't going to agree on this so im going to extricate my self from this convo. Have a good day.

tumblr,3cv9c3,Dontblameme1,10,Sat Jul 11 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"I like how they say ""believing in gay marriage"", as if there's debate about whether it really exists. Obviously they mean ""supporting"" but it's still amusing.  Also since when is going places with your parents because they're your legal guardians considered being ""pressured""?   ""Sorry Dads I can't go to this rally because I don't support this social equality movement so I'm just going to stay home and drink juice"" - that four year old in the pic."
tumblr,3cv9c3,Prancing_Unicorn,2,Sat Jul 11 13:59:07 2015 UTC,Well they proably mean belive in the idea of it. like beliving that its equal and all that.  as for the second thing a lot of the /r/atheism crowd would argue that being taken to church was being presured.
tumblr,3cv9c3,roninjedi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I mean I get what you're saying for the most part it seems like pressured is completely the wrong word to use. To be pressured into something you have to want to not do it. You're not being pressured if you're just going with it because an adult told you. ""Indoctrinated"", maybe, but not ""pressured"". It's correct if we're talking about children who have decided for themselves that they don't ""believe"" in religion or marriage equality, but I think most of the time kids are just gonna accept what their parents say. If there's opposition from a kid about going to a rally or church it's probably because they want to watch cartoons, not because they morally oppose the event."
tumblr,3cv9c3,Prancing_Unicorn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:12:16 2015 UTC,I agree with what you are saying. I just don't like the word Indoctrinated. IT has such negative conotations and brings up images of malice and other things in my mind.

I live in NZ which is why I think it's cruel. We aren't as heavily populated as some countries. In my whole life I've known one family who has had their cat die from being hit by a car. Cats love the outdoors and aren't made to be cooped up all day.   You also seem to be confusing domestic cats with wild cats when you say there is no one to look after them.

To say that churches would have to have their own representation if they were taxed means that corporations and small businesses alike would have to have their own representatives since they already pay taxes. The fact is that a lot of churches participate in politics by rallying their members behind particular candidates or issues. Many churches already have a lot of political weight that they throw around. Take for example Prop 8. It passed in many states a few years ago due to the enormous push it got from the very large and wealthy Mormon church. There you have a clear example of a church getting its ideas pushed into law. In other words, they are already represented in government.   Now, I personally don't feel that churches should be taxed but for very different reasons. Most churches aren't out to make a profit. Most struggle to even continue existing. They also don't receive any services from the government and they exert little to no stress on infrastructure. Many churches make charity a priority also. Taxing them would mean there would be less money left for charity. There are churches that are clearly shams like the Church of Scientology which seems to exist just to make a profit. Those churches should be broken up and if they can't be broken up then they at least should be taxed since they operate more like a business than a church."

I liked it so much that when the day was done, I ripped it off the shirt I had been wearing and put it onto my shirt for the next day.   The day after that I did the same thing as well as the day after that and the day after that. Soon the sticker became wrinkled and the picture not as noticeable.  that didn't stop me though. I loved that sticker too much to give up after two and a half weeks.   What did bring me down where my classmates. They told me to just get rid of the sticker. They said stickers were to be enjoyed for one day only and that it was time to move on. They didn't understand the bond that me and the sticker had though. They didn't understand what it meant to me and what it represented!  To me it represented stability and something that would last. To me it represented fighting to keep something together! Everything had started to fall apart in my life. My parents were fighting quite a bit and I was afraid they would split, a lot of my friends were going to go to different middle schools after this year, and I'd just lost my grandma to cancer.   So I held on. I held on to that god damn sticker. And when the stickiness finally ran out I started bordering it with Scotch tape. And when the Scotch tape started to wear thin, I put scotch tape underneath that scotch tape and when that didn't work, I put on double sided tape. And when even that didn't work I started duct taping that motherfucker to my shirt!   By the time the last day of school came, that's all the sticker was. A piece of duct tape on my shirt. The two of us had prevailed though, right? They said that I couldn't make it last. They said that the sticker was gone... And they were right, weren't they?   I looked Down at my shirt. My beautiful sticker with no longer there. It was simply a piece of duct tape keeping together the wrinkled piece of paper underneath. It was time.  After coming home from my 5th grade graduation, I ripped off the piece of tape and took one last look at my glorious sticker. Tears ran down my eyes as I carried it over to the trash can. After all we've been through, I thought to myself that maybe the trash can was an insult to the stickers memory.  Then I realized that's what the sticker would have wanted. Because that's all the sticker was ever meant to be. A sticker. I'm thinking that you enjoy for a little while and then get rid of when the day is done.   With my old friend left behind in the trash, I headed back to my bedroom to ponder life itself and what middle school might bring to that life."

But I thought I had one or so I thought) So I demanded my phone back. They didn't give it to me so I pretended they didn't exist. Then the nurse put me in the chair and wheeled me to the car. As she pushed me passed some flowers I gave one to her and called her the most beautiful woman in the world. (I was informed, she was indeed not. But i'm okay with that. it made her happy). Then I grabbed a flower and put it in my hair and called myself the prettiest man to ever live.   Then I tried to walk to the car. Try to remember to not do this. Walking is not fun. You know that scene in wolf of wallstreet where he's trying to walk up the stairs while high on qualoods? It was exactly like that.   Then we got in the car and they tried to feed me some hard ass bread. I wasn't having any of that so I threw it at them. Then they all got out to go inside some building I can't recall for a moment and left me alone in a childlocked car. Immediatly I began trying to kick the windows out, but then stopped and removed my shoes. Because i'd realized that if I broke the window with my shoes still on, mom would kill me. So I tried to break it with them off... because... shoes would make her mad in my mind.   Then I got a banana slurpee and slept for a day."

I didn't get IV sedation because after eight tries they still couldn't insert the needle into one of my tiny, steel veins and at that point I was like ""Fuck it can we just do this if I promise to hold still?"" and the dentist was like ""ok"" and just gave me the local. We tried a little nitrous before I said I didn't like it (really I liked it too much and got paranoid about not being able to handle pain while high) and asked to take it off so I got a front seat to the whole thing.   It was a lot of fun hearing them drill and yank everything out. I laughed a little when he pulled the first one out. It was such an organic tearing sound and it was like I could feel it happening without any real pain. I vividly remember thinking ""Fuck, where does unfelt pain go?""  My oral surgeon kept fucking talking to me and asking inane questions the whole time though and I was like ""Uh, awhuly ue?""  Then they took $250 off my copay because I didn't get the IV sedation and I was like O.o. I might pay a little bit for that experience again and people are paying $250 copays to skip it?  My face was super swollen (hard to the touch and my mom couldn't tell when I took the gauze out) and it was pretty painful afterwards. Then it turns out I was one of the lucky 5% of people who don't metabolize the pain killer they gave me. I was working that night and doubles all weekend so I figured if it was really that bad I'd go get an alternate prescription on Monday. Never did. I just took ibuprofens for work and smoked a little of my brother's weed (thru my nose) to put myself to sleep whenever the throbbing was too much.  Like, the pain is bad but if you take care of yourself and avoid dry socket it isn't that bad. The worst part is the relentlessness of it and how much more sensitive everything in your mouth is when you're trying to ""eat"" so I just distracted myself as much as possible.

There are however benefits to feeding a dog meat, since it does benefit quite greatly from the nutrients. However, since dogs (again, strictly speaking) don't NEED meat I reckon it would be possible to engineer a meatless diet that cares for all the nutrients a dog needs.

tumblr,3ciark,MexicanGolf,5,Wed Jul 8 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to them, your argument was fine. And also true. Dogs can definitely be very healthy on a meatless diet, it's just going to take a lot of time, research, effort, and check-ups. But they certainly don't need meat to be healthy (unlike cats, as you pointed out). Reddit has just never been kind to anyone supporting any sort of vegetarian/vegan ideas.   Hell, someone got up voted in this thread for saying that a vegetarian diet for kids (not even a vegan diet, but just a vegetarian one) would be incredibly unhealthy which is an outright lie."
tumblr,3ciark,emsude,-2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:26 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a good argument, because his argument was essentially,""We can substitute it."" Also, he was not the one to point out the cat thing.  I don't think you know what you're saying anyways. You are generalizing reddit and its community down to a consensus you made. I for one support your right to eat whatever you want, but don't believe people should be able to force their beliefs upon others.   Lastly, you didn't add to his argument. Just contradicted things said, and your own statement neglects itself. If a dog can be very healthy without meat in its diet, why would it need the extra regime you've stated? Because it isn't healthy. Sure you can remove food from a dogs diet and it can live, but it will be malnourished as its diet relies on it. Same with humans, but we are capable of altering diet sources."
tumblr,3ciark,warhugger,7,Wed Jul 8 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you were down voted, but you're definitely right. There's nothing in a dogs nutritional needs that they can only receive from meat. It takes effort, research, time, planning, etc., but if done carefully, a dog could be just as healthy on a meatless diet as any other dog."
tumblr,3ciark,emsude,7,Wed Jul 8 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not advocating you just feed your dog whatever vegetables you have and go ""lol he'll be fine.""  It's much harder obviously.  Personally I don't think people should raise their dogs vegetarian/vegan.  But cats actually need meat, there is no possible way to raise a cat and not feed it meat.  It will die."

tumblr,3ciark,Azertys,-7,Wed Jul 8 11:32:27 2015 UTC,"Eh I guess, but needing to keep livestock medicated all the time is a result of the conditions we keep them in. You don't need to stuff rescued livestock animals on a sanctuary full of vaccines and antibiotics."
tumblr,3ciark,Sojourner_Truth,16,Wed Jul 8 11:43:19 2015 UTC,"If you keep a population of things together, humans dogs or cows, you have to vaccine them, period.     I don't care if it's immoral in your opinion to keep livestock in their farm, but as long as they are in they need vaccines to avoid the propagation of disease. In a perfect world where we're not 7 billion and can keep our few cattle grazing in their pasture, we wouldn't need to medicate them so much. But here they are, so we have to vaccine them. Stopping the medication is absolutely out of question and not the right end to tackle this problem."

tumblr,3ciark,darkly39r,5,Wed Jul 8 12:23:44 2015 UTC,"Technically, but dogs don't need meat in the same way an obligate carnivore (i.e. something that cannot survive without meat) does."

tumblr,3cj0qk,jonath_n,-5,Wed Jul 8 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"why are people acting like we should be able to live on minimum wage? its called ""minimum"" for a reason."
tumblr,3cj0qk,haitham123,12,Wed Jul 8 15:47:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. Minimum as in covers just the basic cost of living.
tumblr,3cj0qk,Rutawitz,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:00:31 2015 UTC,Yea and it does exactly that if you're only taking care of yourself.
tumblr,3cj0qk,haitham123,10,Wed Jul 8 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. Making 7.50 an hour wouldn't cover shit, especially when you consider the cost of living has increased while wages haven't moved at all.

tumblr,3cj0qk,Zlswoosh123,3,Wed Jul 8 22:12:03 2015 UTC,i guess the burden of proof is just on me right?
tumblr,3cj0qk,Rutawitz,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:07:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't a debate topic, burden of proof lies nowhere. Your welcome to do research or dabble in misinformation, doesn't really matter to me either way. It can even be argued that the minimum wage had(a degree of) racist initial intent since black workers were willing to work cheaper than white ones. A business would rather pay the cheaper person until minimum wage comes around and levels the pay playing field. For the same price, they would prefer the white worker. There's plenty more to go into, but I'm on mobile and don't feel like writing a research paper on my day off. Nor do you strike me as the type of person who changes their mind even in the face of facts. We aren't arguing whose right/wrong, were discovering truth and you don't seem interested."
tumblr,3cj0qk,Zlswoosh123,-4,Thu Jul 9 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. You are correct. The minimum wage was brought about so that a business couldn't abuse you by paying you next to nothing. It's the minimum wage for jobs that take the minimum effort and skill. It was meant for kids in high school and such to have some extra money. IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A LIVING WAGE, even though many seem to believe this. Those meant to live off their wage are supposed to have wages ABOVE the minimum. The minimum wage and inflation are often closely related. If a business is required to pay workers more, they'll just increase prices, effectively making the wage increase pointless. (Ultimately, this causes those with wages not at the minimum to make less and less every time the minimum wage is increased.)  Edit: Spelling"
tumblr,3cj0qk,jonath_n,4,Wed Jul 8 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's not true. If walmart was forced to pay is employees 12 an hour, prices would go up maybe a penny. And it's a fact if min wage increased, it would benefit local economy. Also, min wage has no moved with inflation at all. I was making 9 when I first started my retail job and ppl at my company where making the same amount 15 years ago. Adjust for inflation and that's a huge difference aka not the same"

tumblr,3cj0o8,Ouranos7,2,Fri Jul 10 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how, scientifically, would drinking blood achieve this? We know that without blood a vampire (supposedly) can die, but why would drinking blood prevent aging? Science can't explain that, therefore the only explanation would be some kind of curse, which science denies.   And is everyone ignoring a vampire's aversion to crosses? I mean, seriously. Why would they be afraid of something that doesn't exist? If there's a vampire, there's a God.  Shame this is all hypothetical..."

tumblr,3cgetf,drbatookhanxx,152,Tue Jul 7 18:34:14 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that Hermione would rip a page out of a book if she thought it would help her save people's lives.   I'm also willing to be that Draco would destroy other people's property for shits n' giggles.
tumblr,3cgetf,BasicAverageQueer,24,Tue Jul 7 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, and J.K. Rowling has said that Malfoy wasn't a good person, although he later turned out to be not as bad as everyone thought. This theory would seem kind of out of character. I think it's far-fetched. Nothing has ever implied that Draco had anything to do with this."
tumblr,3cgetf,Biebbiep,15,Wed Jul 8 09:29:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it's still pretty cool when things like this sorta line up and people notice them. Sometimes fan theories are pretty awesome."
tumblr,3cgetf,Alliewonka,62,Wed Jul 8 10:08:55 2015 UTC,It seems more out of character for malfoy to help hermoine than for hermione to rip a page from a book. Maybe it's just to help establish his character?
tumblr,3cgetf,yuuray,38,Tue Jul 7 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Knowing what we know about Malfoy's actions and character in the sixth book, I think its probable that he wouldn't want mass murder. He might say he does, but deep down he knows its wrong and just wants Harry Potter to acknowledge him, so that he has a friend who isn't a flunky or SS man."
tumblr,3cgetf,shrekter,9,Tue Jul 7 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"If he had the conscience in second year, he did a good job of burying it for the next three. Sixth year was when he finally got hit with what he had signed up for."
tumblr,3cgetf,longshot2025,20,Tue Jul 7 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think he had anything to bury. He was just a jackass to Buckbeak, not privy to Voldemort's or Crotch's plans during the Tournament, and wasn't taken along in the assault on the Ministry of Magic.  But even then, none of the examples deal with the mass murder of his classmates. Nor is there any evidence that he was aware of any of the other murder plots in between the books."
tumblr,3cgetf,shrekter,28,Tue Jul 7 23:38:22 2015 UTC,Crotch's
tumblr,3cgetf,Is_A_Velociraptor,3,Tue Jul 7 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if he doesn't know Voldemort is back in OOTP. It'd be in character for his father to enthusiastically share the news with his family. Yet Draco relishes in how Harry isn't believed by the ministry. If he had a conscience in COS, he acts like he's forgotten about how the same dark lord who went about possessing and trying to kill his classmates is now out and about (and telling his father what to do). Whether he knows about individual killings or not, he'd have to be an idiot to not assume they're taking place."
tumblr,3cgetf,longshot2025,6,Wed Jul 8 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, though, the fear of Voldemort even his followers had. Yeah, the Malfoy family would be happy he's back, but at the same time a child who is privy to information about the true extent of Voldemort's actions in the past and in the present, who's own family and families his is close with support 100%, is going to be terrified of anyone finding out he's not that much of a supporter.   We even start to see the effect this has on him in HBP."
tumblr,3cgetf,CanadaHaz,3,Wed Jul 8 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"The whole family get it eventually. Once Voldemort is actually BACK, every Malfoy when not performing in front of the Dark Lord is just desperately trying to keep their family members alive."
tumblr,3cgetf,Self-Aware,2,Wed Jul 8 11:13:14 2015 UTC,"Plus, he's twelve. I get that he was indoctrinated by his dad, but in second year he's had a year's exposure to people who don't think like his dad, and he's lived and worked with Muggleborns and halfbloods. Maybe the reality of actually killing these people has set in now that he's met some of them. I can't imagine that Lucius would have allowed him contact with Muggleborns, previous to Hogwarts, and very likely told Draco lots of stories about how unnatural they are. It's easy to be scared of/disgusted by something you've only heard about secondhand from a biased source."
tumblr,3cgetf,Self-Aware,21,Wed Jul 8 11:10:16 2015 UTC,"More like he'd rip it out of the book and give it to Hermione in the hopes of getting her, Harry & Ron killed, knowing they have a talent for getting involved in crazy shit."
tumblr,3cgetf,rainbowfish_13,13,Tue Jul 7 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"At the end of the series you could tell that he didn't actually want them dead, he just wanted petty revenge and was a simple bully."

tumblr,3cgetf,rainbowfish_13,14,Wed Jul 8 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think this scene is just more so showing Malfoy as a douche. As in, 'look at this asshole who just rips pages out of books what a dick' etc etc"
tumblr,3cgetf,KiraEatsKids,13,Wed Jul 8 01:14:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but this theory is so much more fun than that.

tumblr,3cgetf,Gamerboss123,2,Wed Jul 8 10:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought that she knew the basilisk was about to get her, so she ripped out the page and clenched it in her fist as a clue to whoever found her."

tumblr,3cgetf,Fumblo,11,Wed Jul 8 00:40:24 2015 UTC,She would have written that down after she found the page
tumblr,3cgetf,PM_ME_FACTS,2,Wed Jul 8 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"More likely that it would have looked odd for Malfoy to purchase whatever the book was. Maybe it was on particularly dark or complex magic, which would have been strange for a second year to be interested in (you might say he could ask his father but Lucius is trying to distance himself from ties to the dark arts at this point), or something regarding love potions or some such."

If I travel the money will manifest as equivalent amounts of the local currency. Only the wallet I currently consider mine will carry this effect. If I lose my wallet or have it stolen, the thief or finder will only get the first 625 and then the wallet will lose its magical properties and the next wallet I choose to carry will have the magical properties.

I will always appear to be exactly the age I choose to appear. My physical health will remain perfect regardless of my apparent or actual age. I will also be able to adjust the appearance of my body at will to look however I want. My body will always function perfectly. I will have perfect grace, strength, stamina, and dexterity at all times. I can heal from all injuries, I never suffer from mental illness, I suffer no illness. Until such time as I decide to renounce my immortality and then I can live and die as normal. I can change my mind and regain all of my physical perfection at any point after renouncing.   Feels just as perfect as the first wish. I'd probably save wish 3 for either eventually wishing for more genies, or if that's a no go then simply hang on to it for a rainy day or emergency."

Even if we calculated the drop rate so that even holding it upside down and as soon as the bills left the wallet, more would manifest, the dropping of enough cash would take more time than it's worth and isn't even feasible given the size of the bills and distribution bottlenecks.  Say we assume a quarter of a second for the bills to fall out fully, that's $2500/sec, $150k/minute, $9m/hr. Let's say to devalue the currency (just enough to be noticeable) we'd need to introduce 5% more currency into circulation that's 14billion in new cash. So that's 1500 hours of the wallet being open, or almost 65 days.

Saying that the people in your family will, and should, always be more important than anyone else in your life means that people are less likely to cut ties with the toxic people they really really need to leave behind. But saying that the relationships you choose are the ones that are most valuable gives you the freedom to live your life how you want.  The original saying most likely wasn't about the blood of the convent, but people place an unjustifiable amount of faith in ancient sayings. So instead of saying that a common phrase is bad advice because X reasons, people just say that there's an even older version that's actually correct."

tumblr,3cdpjv,rainbowyuc,62,Tue Jul 7 07:09:43 2015 UTC,You killed gentle giants and brought back an evil demon that was sealed away for good reason. What do you think?
tumblr,3cdpjv,Kitsyfluff,10,Tue Jul 7 10:45:01 2015 UTC,Some of them were gentle. Some of them were quite violent and aggressive. I also doubt Wander knew the demon would be released. Besides it all worked out in the end.
tumblr,3cdpjv,rainbowyuc,38,Tue Jul 7 10:50:39 2015 UTC,the violent ones were defending themselves because they're aware that wander is killing them all off. The colossi can see the beams of light across the forbidden land just as well as you can.  And wander knew exactly what he was doing because that was the point of the whole intro with him talking to Dormin and the deal being made.
tumblr,3cdpjv,Kitsyfluff,-14,Tue Jul 7 10:54:18 2015 UTC,That's just speculation on your part. I don't think they're sentient. To me they're forces of nature. I doubt they knew that Wander was systematically killing them off.
tumblr,3cdpjv,rainbowyuc,21,Tue Jul 7 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"But does non-sentience make it right to kill? The mere fact that you can kill them means they're alive in some respect.  edit: Did you never feel any remorse for killing creatures that didn't fight back at all, such as the  13th colossus?"
tumblr,3cdpjv,Kitsyfluff,5,Tue Jul 7 11:29:12 2015 UTC,"Well I tried to look at it from his point of view. To save someone he loves, he had to kill 13 'animals'. Would I kill say, 13 different kinds of dogs if it could cure my mother of stage 4 cancer (hypothetically)? I think I would. I know this is gonna sound callous, but animal life isn't worth as much as human life. Hercules killed a bunch of creatures too for his heroic tasks, and he did those things as atonement. Nobody called him evil.   And no, I didn't feel remorse, I was moved by the game, but because of how epic and satisfying it was to take down one of the colossi. And at the end when the girl was saved, I felt duly rewarded for my efforts."
tumblr,3cdpjv,rainbowyuc,7,Tue Jul 7 13:01:29 2015 UTC,"13? you must not have actually played the game, there's 16 in which case I see why you think that way, you're talking like the back of the box. Either that or you skipped all the cutscenes/watched only the fights on youtube. Each colossi had a personality and it was very clear that what you were doing was wrong from Avion onward.  in addition, 5 of them were not like animals, they were human.  also it's fairly sociopathic not to feel remorse for killing things, even doing it for good reason,  a normal person will still feel remorse"
tumblr,3cdpjv,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's been a very long time since I played the game. You said 13 so I just went with it. Also, it's a video game. I must have killed thousands of people playing various FPSs over the years, I don't feel bad about any of it. If that's sociopathic then I guess I am."
tumblr,3cdpjv,rainbowyuc,4,Tue Jul 7 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"it's also important to note that the colossi were vessels for Dormin's fragments, that were created for the sole purpose of making sure he was never reunited."

Besides, in things like temperature, absolute precision isn't really necessary, you probably would find it difficult to tell the difference between 70 - 75F, whereas a five degree difference is much more noticeable when measuring in Celsius.   I find Celsius to just be better for things like telling the temperature. It's much more well rounded, and while less accurate, still does the job fine, in an easier way."

I.e., it's absolutely fine by me to idenitify, dress, and act male, and thus you could be gendered as such, but would you still accept that pre-op you're biologically female and post-op you're biologically male?"
tumblr,3ccaee,eversaur,26,Tue Jul 7 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"That's a bit like asking someone with a bionic leg if they accept that they were born without that leg. Yeah, of course, but it's not cool to bring it up all the time or to define that person by it.   Also, someone's brain is as much part of their biology as the rest of their body. If someone's body looks female but his brain is male, that means not all of his biology is female."
tumblr,3ccaee,brauchen,12,Tue Jul 7 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's best not to bring it up, because it is a common argument used against us and is often a source of discomfort/anguish."

tumblr,3ccaee,broff,4,Tue Jul 7 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious because it's becoming more and more common for me to see people getting offended when a doctor asks for their sex, for medical reasons."
tumblr,3ccaee,eversaur,5,Tue Jul 7 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of anyone being offended because of that. Even so, if you're hearing about it on the internet, 5 people =/= more common. The internet just has a way of making it seem that way."
tumblr,3ccaee,Scurfdonia00,-8,Tue Jul 7 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"Being offended gives a nice adrenaline rush of moral superiority. It's in vogue at the moment as a way for people to feel better about themselves, I guess as an alternative to laughing alone with a salad."
