Brewers,3e5ken,allonbacuth,16,Wed Jul 22 11:13:44 2015 UTC,Tuesday May 19th. That was the last time the Brewers were only 10 games under .500. That day they beat the Tigers to run their record to 15-25.   Here we come!
Brewers,3e5ken,bamfra,12,Wed Jul 22 03:15:18 2015 UTC,Just sitting here waiting for homer.

Brewers,3e3pqk,smiles134,5,Tue Jul 21 18:46:33 2015 UTC,Bruce Seid was  a horrible scouting director.  This is one of many drafts that he pulled off poorly.
Brewers,3e3pqk,workthrowaway68,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"He had a rough first few years which really hurt the franchise given that we traded all of our top prospects in the Sabathia and Greinke (and Marcum) deals and those drafts didn't replenish the system with any talent.  Seid did get really unlucky with Covey and the diagnosis of diabetes right before the signing deadline in 2010 but the Arnett and Bradley picks and up until recently Jungmann are wasted picks.  Thankfully Jungmann has burst onto the scene and the top picks in 2012, 2013, 2014 drafts are starting to show some promise.  I really hope they do make it because it would really be a shame if Seid didn't have anything to show for all the work he did for the Brewers."
Brewers,3e3pqk,brewcrew2_2,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"I always felt that Jungmann was probably a #4 guy and although he has had nice results thats probably where he falls in line eventually.  Once there is a book on him he will get figured out pretty harshly is my guess.  They did pass on Blake Swihart in that draft to take Jungmann and that is a HUGE miss in my book.  I have no problem with him having nothing to show for his work, because I always felt he was a horrible SD."

Brewers,3e2y49,TheBause,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:50 2015 UTC,Anywhere immediately around Miller Park and you should be fine. I'm not sure which hotels provide shuttles but there should be some within walking distance to a pub that does. If I were you I'd look for something on Bluemound Rd. near the stadium in West Allis. Tons of bars in that area that provide shuttles to and from.
Brewers,3e2y49,necropaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"Well, of course there are!  As meltedlaundry said before, around Miller Park is 100% fine.  A very general rule of thumb is, unless you're Downtown or in the Third Ward, the lower the street number the worse it is.  Also, avoid streets that are plant names.  Vine, Cherry, etc.  I know it sounds stupid, but seriously avoid the plants.  As for Hotels, it depends on how close you want to be vs. how expensive you want it to be.  There are some great hotels Downtown that can be kind of pricey, but also have shuttles to the stadium."
Brewers,3e2y49,TheBause,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:14 2015 UTC,Im driving towards the Harley plant now and I'm seeing what your saying about the lower numbers.
Brewers,3e2y49,necropaw,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"I'd highly suggest getting to the game early and tailgating. Tailgating is an essential part of the Miller Park experience. The parking lot opens 3 hours prior to the start of the game (I believe). The old saying is ""If you're not 3 hours early to a Brewers game, you're late.""   That said, if you're not prepared to tailgate, no worries!  Stop by a local grocery store and pick up some Klements or Usingers, ask a nice Brewers fan to plop them on their grill for you.  Someone will almost certainly help you out.  If you're 21, enjoy some pre-game beers.  It's a giant party out there, have fun!"
Brewers,3e2y49,TheBause,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, im going to be there tonight as well!  I dont have quite the drive you do, but its about 4 hours down there, hehe.

Brewers,3e2y49,fly1ngorb,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"No, I got a ticket voucher from eating Palermos pizzas lol.   This was one of the available games."
Brewers,3e2zt8,CaptainCourteous,10,Tue Jul 21 15:48:44 2015 UTC,Getting a .500 record for this season would be bad for the team. Take advantage of both the awful start and strong resurgence to revamp the farm via trades and a high draft pick. Best of both worlds in my mind.
Brewers,3e2zt8,theamazingkiwi,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"They need to commit to a rebuild. Look at what the Cubs and Astros have done (admittedly, of course, some of it is luck and good training in the minors; e.g., I don't think anybody expected Dallas Keuchel to be the absolute beast he has become, especially given how unremarkable his first season was).  I half typed up who I wanted to see go, but honestly, I'm just going to say I'm open to just about anybody getting traded as long as the deal is good. I'm a bit more open to lesser deals with people who are at the end of their contracts who will serve as rentals (Lind, Parra, Ramirez, Cotts)."
Brewers,3e2zt8,SolidRambo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:04 2015 UTC,How I feel about the impending trades
Brewers,3e2zt8,silentjay01,4,Tue Jul 21 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"I'm scared to death that Doug won't make any significant moves. He never has been a fire sale GM.  I won't be surprised in the least when we get a lackluster deal for Neal Cotts on the day of the deadline and be done with it. He'll still have ""hope"" for the season because of this resurgence."
Brewers,3e2zt8,BrewCrewKevin,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you're right, but I'm hoping that Antanasio pushes for a different direction. Admit that this team can't win the World Series, make moves for the future."
Brewers,3e2zt8,adam7765,5,Tue Jul 21 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"Absolute best case scenario: Brewers never looked back and have an amazing second half. 85-77, sweep the Cubs in the last week to finish 1 game ahead for the second Wild Card.   More realistic: 75-87. Brewers go .500 for the remainder of season.  Trades: Jean Segura, Francisco Rodriguez, Gerardo Parra, Kyle Lohse for lunch. I see Doug Melvin being the same old rebuild avoiding GM he is and not commit to a huge fire sale."
Brewers,3e2zt8,silentjay01,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, I could see Melvin being told to take lead on a fire sale right before he is moved out of the role of GM so that any of the fan animosity generated from the trades will be directed at him and the new GM won't have to start by making a bunch of unpopular (but necessary) moves.    There is something to be said for the man that is willing to become the villain to protect the new guy but will Melvin have the sack to do it?"
Brewers,3e2zt8,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"DM will likely still be in the Org but you are right, he seems willing to bite the bullet for both the team and the new GM."

Brewers,3e2zt8,Pfloyd3333,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"Follow-up question... were the Brewers to turn it around and squeak into the playoffs, would it be considered one of the greatest season resurgences of all-time?"

Brewers,3e2zt8,adam7765,3,Tue Jul 21 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see it, but I remain cautiously optimistic. I'm a realist. Based on what I've seen, this is definitely a .500 team. If we made the playoffs, I don't think we could get past the Cardinals or Dodgers in the NLCS."
Brewers,3e2zt8,zjl3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"I love the Brewers as much as anybody, but I would much rather see them trade a few players for some good young talent and set us up for the future than seeing us squeak into the playoffs by a game and have nothing else to show for it."

I have a theory though, I do believe the generally more ""popular"" teams such as the Yanks, Dodgers, Angels, etc are ranked lower due to the fact that the majority of the city population just purely can't afford to go to games as often as Brewers fans can. The bigger market clubs have higher ticket prices, which may filter out the ""loyal"" fan more than the Brewers. The Cubs, however...well, you know."

Brewers,3dzgau,fly1ngorb,11,Mon Jul 20 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"""not especially interested""  This means they could be swayed. I wouldn't be surprised if they were. Fiers is 30 and we have a full rotation right now. Package him with Lind or K-Rod and get a good return, I think."
Brewers,3dzgau,smiles134,5,Mon Jul 20 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm reading it more as they are just waiting for an appropriate deal to pop up more than not wanting to trade him. He's still under team control well behind this year so there's no need to rush him out of the door."
Brewers,3dzgau,sjm1541,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"Lind aint coming back. K-Rod... maybe. Aaron Sanchez was recently moved from the rotation to the bullpen and he was amazing last year out of the pen, so our need for a late-inning reliever isnt as pressing. But having K-Rod in our bullpen? Damn that would be a great pen."
Brewers,3dzgau,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"Just for reference since I have read that the Jays are on a tight budget right now, how much money can the team spend this deadline? Or a better way to phrase it is, how much remaining budget do you guys have?"
Brewers,3dzgau,theamazingkiwi,5,Mon Jul 20 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"About $6m, according to various reports."
Brewers,3dzgau,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it might be tough for the Jays then to add everything they are trying to get, and K-rod is not cheap. This is why I figured Fiers is a solid for you all."
Brewers,3dzgau,theamazingkiwi,3,Mon Jul 20 20:38:22 2015 UTC,K-Rod is actually pretty cheap this year
Brewers,3dzgau,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"Whoops, I meant he is not cheap next year, which is why teams appear to be reluctant to trade for K-Rod, but yeah you;re right, I think k-rod is owed 3MM this year?"
Brewers,3dzgau,theamazingkiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/07/mike-fiers-trade-blue-jays.html Steve Adams of MLBTR is think the same thing, same for Cotts as well."
Brewers,3dzgau,theamazingkiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Cotts would be a good candidate as well. The Jays have really struggled in late inning relief this year. K-Rod would be a big improvement for them. So would Smith, but I think Smith would garner a higher return for the Crew, which would make the Jays a little unlikely to bite, in my opinion."
Brewers,3dzgau,smiles134,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"Jerk, I was just about to post this! :P  ...Anyway, If Fiers is not moved this deadline, then he will be next deadline or this Winter. A ton of Fiers trade value is based off his league minimum salary, which can also make it tough to move such an asset so freely, which is why Milwuakee does not want to deal him. However, I can't see a reason why the Brewers don't trade him before Fiers hits Arbitration, and the Blue Jays are a solid fit, so I can see a deal happening with these clubs. Maybe not at this deadline but sometime within the next year."
Brewers,3dzgau,theamazingkiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"I really like Fiers, but he's 30 and we're about to start a rebuild. I understand he's going to be cheap for the next few years, but this is probably his peak value. If we can get some pieces to help rebuild the minors, trade him."
Brewers,3dzgau,snackshack,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:39 2015 UTC,At least listen Doug come on he won't be around when we become relevant.
Brewers,3dzgau,fascistcheese,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:31 2015 UTC,"We don't have to trade anyone we don't want to.  The more willing we seem to give up someone, the less we'll get back.  This team has recently show that they can be competitive with good teams (8 game win streak + sweep of the Pirates).  If we don't get the deal we want, we don't trade anyone.  We're not that far off from being competitive and (dare I say) we could be competitive next year if we don't trade the whole team."
Brewers,3dzgau,Tuggernuts23,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"This is my thought and I think the hesitation in trading people right now. I think, perhaps you move a few guys who we would likely lose anyways. BUT, even if we don't get into the playoffs/make a push this year, the team has shown they can win and can compete. A few trades to get some guys shuffled around, and next year could be a good year."
Brewers,3dzgau,madman86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:42 2015 UTC,I wish I could get behind this but it's why we have been mediocre for the past 3 years. The more we think that we can compete by making a few trades the more likely we are to fail. We have been stuck in mediocrity for too long and the way to break out of it is to rebuild.
Brewers,3dzgau,MasterCashier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. Personally, I think it is time, but you're talking about a decrease in attendance and revenues. And this is a business. If you feel like you could sustain and get those revenues, it maybe worth the shot."
Brewers,3dzgau,madman86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is I don't think attendance is an issue. Look at this year for example, we are the second worst team in all of baseball and are still number 11 in attendance. We are pulling more fans on average than teams that have way better records than us and we are only 100,000 fans from 6th. We are a baseball town and always have been. Milwaukee will understand if we need to rebuild to be good again."

Brewers,3dy3tz,necropaw,9,Mon Jul 20 14:08:18 2015 UTC,Garza or lohse will be gone. I'd bet we are packaging them with parra or gogo. You want the stud? Gotta take the dud!
Brewers,3dy3tz,QAZZY10,2,Mon Jul 20 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"The problem are their contracts.  I guess maybe if we eat some of it, but even then.  A team doesnt want a shit starter.  I guess maybe a long man for when rosters are expanded.  I dunno."
Brewers,3dy3tz,jordo2323,4,Mon Jul 20 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"Lohse's contract is not an issue, only Garza's."
Brewers,3dy3tz,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"We'll eat most/part of the contract, I'm sure. It's a sunk cost at this point, we know Garza's got a high price tag. Unless we're being offered absolutely nothing for him, but I'm guessing /u/QAZZY10 is right, he'll be packaged with someone."
Brewers,3dy3tz,allonbacuth,4,Mon Jul 20 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think our best bet is to deal Lohse to someone, but if no one wants him, I had a thought. This could very well be unfeasible in actuality, but what do you guys think about a switching 5 man and 6 man rotation. Something like this  Day 1: Lohse  Day 2: Garza (Lohse rest)  Day 3: Fiers/Wily (Lohse rest)  Day 4: Wily/Fiers (Lohse rest)  Day 5: Nelson (Lohse Bullpen)  Day 6: Jungmann (Lohse pen)  Day 7: Garza (pen)  Day 8: Fiers/Wily (pen)  Day 9: Wily/Fiers (pen)  Day 10: Nelson (rest)  Day 11: Jungmann (rest)  Day 12: Lohse   This would allow us to use the 6 man rotation without a big of a hit to the pen. It hurts Lohse's arm the most (only 3 days rest before being available for the pen), and I don't see him playing here after this year, and allows us to keep our young arms practiced but rested.   I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to the inner workings of a team, but I thought it was a neat idea. Thoughts?"
Brewers,3dy3tz,Amoney8612,3,Mon Jul 20 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"I've always thought of going with a 5.5 man rotation when you have too many starters. Something like you're saying... Start Lohse on normal rest, but have your biggest question mark ready to come in after Lohse. It could save the bullpen, and limit innings. Lohse go 4/5 innings, pitcher 'x' goes 4/5 innings.   I know starters like to have their pregame routine long-toss sessions and what not, I don't know how doable that would be...but that's my idea."
Brewers,3dy3tz,mitch8ryan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:32 2015 UTC,Lohse's contract is up after this year. Teams want guys on expiring deals
Brewers,3dy3tz,BrewCrewKevin,5,Mon Jul 20 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Lohse is performing like shit. Nobody is going to want him.  I  could see him coupled with a more productive player, but I don't  think anybody will take his contract for the 2nd half of the year."
Brewers,3dy3tz,SolidRambo,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:17 2015 UTC,Give Lohse and Garza potara earrings from DBZ so they fuse into one. They might fuse into a slightly below average pitcher and solve the rotation problem.
Brewers,3dy3tz,prof_shine,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"Good analysis here: http://www.brewcrewball.com/2015/7/16/8963521/milwaukee-brewers-starting-rotation-jungmann-lohse-garza-fiers-peralta-nelson  I'm assuming nobody is going to want Lohse or Garza.

Brewers,3du9b7,messejueller21,5,Sun Jul 19 18:37:03 2015 UTC,It wasn't even Gomez's fault.  Mercer should have tossed it to the bag.
Brewers,3du9b7,silentjay01,5,Sun Jul 19 18:39:31 2015 UTC,Yeah their game thread is freaking out and talking about deporting Gomez and suspensions blah blah blah

Brewers,3du9b7,maltrab,5,Sun Jul 19 18:38:14 2015 UTC,If it was anyone other than Gomez it wouldn't even be an issue. If you look he is visibly upset that Mercer is injured.
Brewers,3du9b7,ShoopALoop11,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"Disagree, I have an issue with anyone who slides to take someone out 20 feet from the bag. That's just disgraceful."
Brewers,3du9b7,maltrab,6,Sun Jul 19 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"But it's part of baseball... If there is a routine ground ball double play you break it up, so instead of two outs there is one. I'm sorry Jody got injured but that happens from time to time."
Brewers,3du9b7,ShoopALoop11,-5,Sun Jul 19 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"A slide 20 feet from the bag is not part of baseball, and if it is, it needs to be removed. 5 feet or so? Sure. I can buy that. But that far from the bag? No, in no way was that defensible."

Brewers,3du9b7,quedfoot,11,Mon Jul 20 06:53:59 2015 UTC,at least the pirates announcers made it clear they don't think it was a dirty play.
Brewers,3du9b7,sdogg,6,Sun Jul 19 18:37:44 2015 UTC,It really wasn't. Mercer was a bit out of position and decided to go for the tag instead of giving the ball to who was covering 2nd base.

Brewers,3dt18o,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:59 2015 UTC,"Aw, you should have! That's really the way to do it. We all love when that stuff happens.  We just tailgated for Brett Favre's hall of fame induction in Green Bay the other day and ended up tailgating with like 3 or 4 other groups, even though we all had our own stuff. The guys next to us had bags, so we started playing there. Somebody else was low on beer, so they came over and bummed a few. A guy in the next row had a tricked out Packer Ambulance, so we talked to them for a bit.  Common practice when tailgating, honestly. Bring some meat and some sort of side, and anybody will welcome you in! ESPECIALLY an out of towner!"

Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"That picture they used for Favre on his banner is pretty much perfect.  Him having his fingers up in the air on it would have been even better, but oh well."
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,3,Sun Jul 19 01:31:29 2015 UTC,It's a good picture but I almost would have preferred the picture of him with the helmet off after scoring his first td in Super Bowl XXXI.  That's the image of Favre that is always first in my mind when I think of him.
Brewers,3drn64,silentjay01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, him running around like a little puppy was always so satisfying."
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:51 2015 UTC,What picture did they use?
Brewers,3drn64,brewersfan412,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:56 2015 UTC,"You'll have to find a pic online.  He actually looked a bit teary eyed in it, but that happy face he has."
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"Looking very proud, yeah I agree."
Brewers,3drn64,TheBause,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:32:23 2015 UTC,Where did ARam's homer hit?
Brewers,3drn64,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:27 2015 UTC,First row in the left field bleachers.
Brewers,3drn64,MasterCashier,2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I watched the video like three times and I couldn't tell where it landed
Brewers,3drn64,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:46 2015 UTC,Yeah at tough sometimes. I'm here so it makes it a bit easier to tell :)
Brewers,3drn64,MasterCashier,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"Damn, watching those people in green bay give Favre an ovation like this is almost chilling."
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,4,Sun Jul 19 01:07:47 2015 UTC,It's about time.  I hated the fans that booed him.  He brought the franchise to prominence and it was extremely short sighted to turn on him when he left.
Brewers,3drn64,jn2010,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"I was certainly not happy with him for a few years there, but i remember the night when it changed.  It was the fucking fail mary game, and i saw a picture on facebook that had favre looking like a puppy with the text: ""INTs count as TDs?  Im comin back!""  It just got me thinking about how much i loved watching him as a kid, and i couldnt be mad anymore.  I actually bought his jersey a couple years ago (finally), and wear it really often."
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"I don't care if it's Mahatma Gandhi lining up under center for the Vikings (or the Bears), I'm still going to boo their QB because he is playing for the enemy and its part of my job as a Packer fan to do so."
Brewers,3drn64,silentjay01,3,Sun Jul 19 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"If you were consistent in that, I have no problem.  But the vitriol he received was far beyond the usual level of hatred the Vikings get in Lambeau.  I hated that."

Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:00:45 2015 UTC,I just wish we would have been able to do the same for Reggie White.

Brewers,3drn64,TheBause,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"I want Jimmy to get a win so bad after that first inning.  Ill admit, i had kinda lost hope there for a bit.  Still kept listening though, and damn...what a game!"
Brewers,3drn64,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"You can do it, Brew Crew! Defeat them and rise over the Pirates."
Brewers,3drn64,Vanscoten,5,Sun Jul 19 00:47:43 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll try
Brewers,3drn64,Pfloyd3333,2,Sun Jul 19 00:49:02 2015 UTC,I don't know how to feel about this...  I guess we'll go ahead and win.
Brewers,3drn64,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 19 00:49:01 2015 UTC,"Serious question: Why would it make sense for the Brewers to trade Parra? Is 27 too old in MLB? This guy is hot. Seems like he kills it most games and makes the most out of at bats. If the Brewers stick to the theme of keeping young(er) players that are doing really well it doesn't make a ton of sense to me to trade them, as much as I know how much it will make the Brewers better in the coming years.  tldr I don't want to part with my favorite players I guess"
Brewers,3drn64,sniper84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"He's a FA after the year is done, so the Brewers could resign him if they wanted too, but it's logical if they don't. Plus, there is legitimate reason to believe Parra is not this good as he has looked, but that is another write up altogether. Lastly, his value is damn high right now and someone may overpay."
Brewers,3drn64,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"That's true as well, thanks for the explanation."
Brewers,3drn64,sniper84,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"Because his contract is up at the end of the season and his value right now is as high as it's really ever been, so we'd get a pretty good return on him"
Brewers,3drn64,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:00 2015 UTC,I guess that makes a lot of sense. Seems to me like when we start clicking he's a big reason why.. But it will be good to get a lot for him in the end
Brewers,3drn64,sniper84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"Rebuilds suck, but in the long run, we'll be better off"
Brewers,3drn64,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:03:47 2015 UTC,That's for sure. Makes more sense now that I know his contract is expiring.
Brewers,3drn64,sniper84,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:53 2015 UTC,"I love going into other teams subs and seeing them saying things like ""The Brewers are one of the worst teams in the league. Of course we're losing.""  Feels good."

That being said, you can still tailgate with only 4 people. I actually prefer to tailgate with a smaller party as the food can be better when you are only cooking for 4. Personally, I would get to the parking lot 3 hours before the game starts and tailgate. Tailgating at Miller Park is such a big part of the overall experience that I wouldn't want my guests to miss it."
Brewers,3dq448,Uhhhhdel,4,Sat Jul 18 11:04:03 2015 UTC,Absolutely!  You have to tailgate with them!

Brewers,3dq448,ANumenorean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:51:38 2015 UTC,The old German beer ball downtown might be cool but if they are from Germany they might want a different experience from a new city. Also I'm not sure they have a shuttle but I'm sure other bars close by would.
Brewers,3dq448,crazypostman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"You don't need a lot of people to tailgate. I've done it with 2. Mini grill, pack of brats, and a cooler and you're set. There are thousands of people surrounding you to help with the ambiance...."
Brewers,3dq448,throwaway52415,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"Realistically, we won't have enough people to tailgate ourselves   I've tailgated with only myself and my wife for more games than i care to count. It's not the numbers, it's the quality of the people. Plus, fewer people means more beer and food for yourselves. 4 people is more than enough. Honestly, while the bars are fun, tailgating is the best possible experience."
Brewers,3dq448,snackshack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:29:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are plenty of two-somes tailgaiting at Miller Park. Otherwise I would second the Bluemound bars although I'm partial to Steve's/McGinn's."

Brewers,3do2rk,necropaw,3,Sat Jul 18 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"Come what may with the down votes, but I would like to say something.  I think the Brewers still have a shot at a wild card.  It's a long shot, but not at all impossible.  The names on this team still hold a shit load of respect in this game, and together they can go on a tear.    The 06' Cardinals had 3 losing streaks of at least 8 games.  The Brewers have an 8 game losing streak, a 7 game losing streak and a 6 game losing streak.  That's about 40% of their losses.  ~40% of the Brewers losses happened over about 3 weeks.    There's 12 weeks to go and you guys have been right around .500 since June 1st.  It's not impossible.  This team does have a lot of the right pieces.  Your front office and minor league system does know what it's doing.    Win tonight, and the Brewers are 9.5 games out of the Wild Card game and 9.5 games away from being every baseball fan's best friend.  Stranger shit has happened.  Whatever happens though, Aramis Ramirez will always scare the shit out of me."

Brewers,3do2rk,theamazingkiwi,2,Sat Jul 18 02:46:58 2015 UTC,It bothers me that anyone would say that because it's such a long shot and I'd much prefer to trade away the valuable parts of our team and rebuild for next year.  Thanks for the kind words though.
Brewers,3do2rk,jn2010,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:42:03 2015 UTC,"http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/mil/half/1/milwaukee-brewers  Had they just avoided those losing streaks.  If they had won half those games, people would be talking about the Brewers buying and beiing a force to look out for.  ARAM, Lucroy, Braun, Segura, a rotation that can get on track and consistently get by and a decent bullpen....  I wouldn't be betting my car against you guys if you had split instead of losing out during those streaks.  You can't afford another one, though."
Brewers,3do2rk,Salesman89,2,Sat Jul 18 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"That's such an empty argument.  Of course if we had won more games in the start, we would have a better chance at making the playoffs.  That's not the reality though.  Congrats on pointing out the obvious."
Brewers,3do2rk,jn2010,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying ""It's gonna happen!""  I'm saying that you're not watching a bad baseball team.  You haven't done that since 2006.  Keep supporting this team like Millwaukee fans have been for a while now, the people in charge of your team are consistently playing the right hands.    I laugh at the Cubs' recent #Wearegood bullshit  I worry about the Brewers future in regard to my teams ability to succeed in this division.  I don't care if I'm alone in with that feeling, or if I'm wrong.  All I can say is, I smell something fishy."

Brewers,3do2rk,jn2010,3,Sat Jul 18 03:11:11 2015 UTC,I agree. If you say you like braun i'll take back everything shitty i've said about the cards.
Brewers,3do2rk,Pfloyd3333,2,Sat Jul 18 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"I've distanced myself from hating him.  He wanted to get the most out of his talent.  He is an extremely talented power hitter.  I hate how he reacted after he was all but completely exposed.  The guy can hit and run the bases better than most.  I just feel bad for that FedEx guy for having to put his story up against a former NL MVPs.  That had to be a shitty year for that guy.    That said, I'd like to see the Brewers do the right thing and cast him away after his contract is up.  It infuriates me that what the Cubs are TRYING to do right now is going to drown out what the Brewers ARE doing and HAVE been doing since 08'.  The Brewers have developed a full spectrum of talent since that time period and shown a damn good track record.   The Cubs haven't done in 107 years what the Brewers have done in the past half decade.  They've won one (1) single postseason series in the past 107 years.    The point is, don't blow this team up for scraps so you can hope and pray for 2 years from now."
Brewers,3do2rk,Salesman89,3,Sat Jul 18 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is, a lot of those guys that were talking about trading are only under contract for a year or two.  Rami is done after this year.  After next year its doubtful we can afford Gomez  Parra's contract is short.  If we can get something for him, maybe we can sign him in a year or two again if we want.  Luc is kinda a wild card.  We'd need to absolutely pillage another teams farm system to see him go.  Segura we can move because in a year or two we'll have Arcia."

Brewers,3dn009,ShoopALoop11,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:30 2015 UTC,Rivera and Sardinas will fill the gap.
Brewers,3dn009,smiles134,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Arcia doesn't come up until next year. We have two shortstops in AAA that will come up before him."
Brewers,3dn009,CasualCore,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"It's the same ""they might move [everyone]"" conversation we've been looking at all season so far. It's all speculation until we start getting the meaty rumors. I was hypothesizing last week about packaging Lohse in when we trade Parra, would be an interesting way to see him go. Not too much time left until July is over, something's gotta start moving."
Brewers,3dn009,necropaw,4,Fri Jul 17 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I wonder what we could get for Siggy.  he has plenty of upside, is fast, a good fielder (needs to be a bit more consistent, but coaching might be able to cover that).    hes also young, and has shown he can perform at a really high level in the past.  Someone might take a risk on him.  Edit: By take a risk, i mean maybe they'd give up a high quality prospect or something.  More than we'd expect to get for him."
Brewers,3dn009,brewcrew2_2,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"We underrate Segura on this sub (and by ""we"" I mean everyone but me :p ).  He's a young, everyday shortstop that will hit between .260-.280 and steal 20+ bases a year and still has potential.  There's less than ten shortstops in the league that can do that.  We'll easily get something real nice for Segura."
Brewers,3dn009,AhhhBROTHERS,4,Fri Jul 17 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, we probably overrate him a lot. In the last two seasons Segura has been one of the worst offensive shortstops in baseball, via wRC+. Also, his defense is decent but inconsistent. His return in a trade woulds be greatly dependent on their need for a controlled SS."
Brewers,3dn009,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:28 2015 UTC,How about the twins? I know they just called up their big guns but danny santana is terrible.
Brewers,3dn009,sjm1541,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"There's no denying he was disappointing offensively last season and has had periods of slumps this season.  But I don't think we can completely disregard his great 2013 season, to me that shows what his potential is.  The dude is still young and went through a lot last year and the fact Seg is hitting .270+ so far is pretty encouraging.  I personally think he has more value than many people here seem to give him."
Brewers,3dn009,brewcrew2_2,3,Fri Jul 17 20:35:12 2015 UTC,If you hit .270 but don't walk or hit for power the .270 doesn't mean much. He has the lowest walk rate of any full time SS in the league and is 19th in ISO. Even his average this year puts him 9th among SS and its extremely empty. He benefited from a big infield hit rate in 2013 and the power numbers don't seem to ever be coming back. His 0.3 WAR over his past 219 games has to be really concerning for any team thinking about taking him on.
Brewers,3dn009,MustBeNice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"I can't deny stats and I completely agree he doesn't walk and has been disappointing the last season and parts this season.  I do not factor these stats into his future potential though.  I believe Melvin sees his potential and will not trade Segura unless he gets the value deserved, and if not, Segura will continue to grow and will make a great 2B once Arcia takes over SS."
Brewers,3dn009,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:00 2015 UTC,"I vehemently disagree. Segura is highly overrated.  He had the one great anomaly of a season, but save for that year he hasn't even cracked a 1 WAR, topping out at .6, & currently good for a .2 this year.  Keep in mind, league average is 2.0 WAR.  He's VERY light hitting, honestly not as fast as you'd expect (Braun has more steals), he refuses to take a walk and he doesn't rate highly in the field.  He just looks like an all-world player when you compare him to Yuni B. Currently has 13 errors this season which is a little over halfway through.  Id be very surprised if there was any interest in him from a contender."
Brewers,3dn009,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"I said underrated on this sub, and as you can see in the comments, this sub considers Segura to basically be Yuni B. I'm saying that calling Segura a younger Yuni B is underrating him, because he plays better and has a lot of potential in him and I think Melvin knows that."
Brewers,3dn009,MustBeNice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Our recent drafting has left much to be desired, though I do finally feel like there are some real prospects I'm looking forward to.  They might not have the attention of MLB (yet) but I'm looking forward to following several prospects going forward, including Gilbert Lara, Monte Harrison (who's been mentioned several times here), Jacob Gatewood (who had a slow start but won the college home run derby as a shortstop), Kodi Medieros.  The farm could be on the upswing, finally."
Brewers,3dn009,mattwise15,4,Fri Jul 17 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"These last two drafts plus international signings have brought this system back from the dead, both drafts have been excellent.

Brewers,3dn009,Rules_row,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"Actually Gatewood was a high school junior when he won the home run derby.

Brewers,3dmc6v,Nadie_AZ,4,Fri Jul 17 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"the problem is getting rid of Lohse and garza.  Maybe we can trade Garza.  Might have to eat some of the money.  I just dont see anyone taking Lohse, though.  Could just DFA him, but at this point you might as well get some innings out of him vs that.  Its not like were contenders."
Brewers,3dmc6v,necropaw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with eating the money, he won't be on the books anytime near when we will be competitive.   Lohse could get dealt right at the deadline to a team who whiffed on other trade targets and are desperate to win now. His track record is solid enough to potentially have a club look past his bad performance this year"

Brewers,3dmc6v,QAZZY10,3,Fri Jul 17 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"I think the real problem with the rotation is that it isnt very good at all.  It hasnt been for quite a while now.  Lohse and Garze are guys they wont be able to get rid of because they were given ridiculous contracts.  Peralta and Nelson are guys they will hold onto but they are still a bit inexperienced.  Fiers is all or nothing and despite his results has stuff that is quite unimpressive.  We also shouldnt forget that this is the best he will ever get, as he is in his prime years and will get more expensive as he declines from the lofty heights he is at now.  And Jungmann although impressive as he has been probably wont sustain that ability.   Cravy is a AAAA guy and the team doesnt have any impact arms at all in the farm system above A ball.  Its a pretty ugly picture.  That is the problem."
Brewers,3dmc6v,workthrowaway68,2,Fri Jul 17 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"""Peralta still a bit inexperienced""  Yea.....no, 465 MLB innings pitched.  ""Fiers is all or nothing and despite his results""  One bad 22 innings stretch at the start of 2013 is all you can point to Fiers being anything but a solid mid/back of the rotation pitcher.  As for Jungmann and Cravy...well they're probably 4-5 types at best, but still valuable, as is Thornburg.  To say this system has no ""impact arms at all above A ball"" is ridiculous. Hobbs Johnson, Jorge Lopez, Ty Wagner, Taylor Williams, Wei-Chung Wang, Cy Sneed...all have the potential to be impactful as starters while guys like Damien Magnifico, Austin Ross and Mike Strong have been lights out for Huntsville's bullpen this season and could find themselves in the back end of Milwaukee's within a year or two.  Add Medeiros, Miguel Diaz, Marcos Diplan, Cody Ponce, Nathen Kirby, Devin Williams, David Burkhalter. There's plenty of high ceiling talent arms in the minors."
Brewers,3dmc6v,ANumenorean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"The names you mention in the last tow paragraphs are NOT impact level pitchers.  There is not one potential ace in the mix at all, not even a #2 for an upside."
Brewers,3dmc6v,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"lol, ok bud. Diplan was the prize of the Gallardo trade, there has been plenty said about his upside as well as Miguel Diaz. I don't even need to mention Medeiros and Williams, because if you've been following the Brewers prospects, you should already know they're both pretty highly thought of. Kirby and Ponce, well they're new draft picks so obviously the jury is out on them even more than Williams and Medeiros. The guys I mentioned tearing up AA all have the upside of mid rotation starters. Not necessarily an ""ace"" in any of them, but to say none of them are ""impact level pitchers"" is shortsighted and not at all accurate."
Brewers,3dmc6v,ANumenorean,0,Tue Jul 21 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"If we can't trade Lohse, send him down/cut him.  Garza has another season or two left, and it's possible he could rebound and still be trade-able in the future.  So if we can't trade him this season, he should stay in the rotation as long as he's healthy and has another year left.  I'd like to see a rotation of Garza, Peralta, Fiers, Nelson, Jungman.  Maybe Thornburg eventually if we do find a taker for Garza as well."

Yeah, Luc...ugh.  i dont want to see him go, but we cant compete while hes still catching.  We should be able to absolutely pillage someone else's farm system for him, though."
Brewers,3diujt,necropaw,3,Thu Jul 16 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"I really think we should try to follow a similar plan that the Astros have. They got rid of all the talent they had and got a lot of prospects for it. Sure they struggled for a few years, but slowly accumulated good prospects and had top 5 picks in the draft. Look where they are now"
Brewers,3diujt,zrob534,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if GoGo gets traded in the off-season.  Parra will definitely be traded.  A-Ram will be traded if a team wants him. He's heating up now, but it really depends on what is being offered. I say trade him if there's an offer.  I will be very surprised if Lohse gets traded.  Same with Garza, though I could see a team jumping at him to have him for a couple years.  Cotts has had a better year than I thought. I could see him being traded.  Luc will not be traded for a couple years UNLESS we get a top ten prospect offer for him, which is unlikely. He's on a team friendly deal and he's the kind of player you can build a franchise around. Very much a fan favorite and he will keep people buying tickets. He's young enough that he will likely be at the helm of a competitive Brewers team in the future.  Lind will most likely be traded.  I don't think any team will take Braun for what he's worth. He's sort of a team cancer, from a PR perspective, and his contract is pretty large. I don't think the Brewers will move him.  Segura is one of the likelier maybe traded players. But I don't think it happens until the off season. Shortstop is a position that we have a lot of organizational depth in, so I'm guessing one of either Sardinas, Yadiel Rivera or Segura gets traded to a team in need of a younger shortstop, one moves to third, and the other to second."

Sure, some people make sense, like Aramis and Lohse (assuming we can) but this team is showing that it can win baseball games.  We are not a sub-.500 team.  If we trade Lucroy, Braun, Gomez, we might turn into one.  I believe this team is very close to being competitive, if it isn't already, and trading all of our big players WILL set us back. We aren't just throwing in the towel for this year, but for the next 2-3 years while we truly re-build and replace the players we trade.  So, the only players that are a must trade are Lohse and Aramis, given that they won't be around next year anyway.  I still think Garza can come back and be an effective pitcher, and we only need to dump 1 to have an effective starting rotation of Peralta, Jungmann, Fiers, Nelson, and Garza."

How about we get rid of the players that are constantly playing bad instead of trading/letting go/ talking about go of players that are playing good?

Brewers,3diujt,franklin_stubbs,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this in the wrong way.  The Brewers rarely ever trade major league talent away. Someone remind me who we traded last before Estrada this summer for Lind. It might be Lorenzo Cain and Alcides Escobar in the trade to KC for Greinke. What we need to do now is trade away major league talent. The ones we need to trade are the ones who are playing above expectations right now (Lind, Parra, Cotts) who are also towards the ends of their contracts (Lohse, Gomez) and likely will not be retained by the team due to contract demands or other reasons (Ramirez).  All of those players I just listed will not be on the team by the end of 2016, if we kept them.  Our team is not talented enough right now to win. Our farm system is depleted due to a combination of poor drafting and short term trades. We need to trade away our major league talent to get young guys with high ceilings so that in a couple of years we can be competitive again. Otherwise by the end of 2016 we'll be left with a team of replacement-level players and no up and coming young guys to look forward to.  Edit: just spent a bit looking at the Brewers organizational transactions for the past few years. i had forgotten that we traded Axford for Blazek. And that we traded K-Rod for Delmonico. Both of those trades we were trading people at the ends of contracts for prospects. Good trades, except we released Delmonico this year. He's been switched to a 1B in the White Sox org."

Brewers,3ddobv,theamazingkiwi,2,Wed Jul 15 13:33:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for this writeup!  A few questions:  Isn't a ~20% K% pretty high?  What's the league average BABIP in Rookie ball? Clark's seems pretty high.  How old is Monte Harrison?  And I'm going to be really bummed if we don't sign Kirby. He looks to me like he will be a stud one day.
Brewers,3ddobv,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:35:10 2015 UTC,20.2% K% is average. (The 40% Harrison was at playing for Appleton would lead the league right now)  Average ML Babip is .297 for 2015. I don't know where I'd find advanced metrics for Rookie ball. Fangraphs or Baseball-Reference are both good places to find advanced metrics and minor league stats even though I prefer BR. There isn't any on Baseball Reference. But yes Clark's BABIP is very high. He'd be 3rd in the Majors for it only behind Dee Gordon and Miggy.  Monte Harrison was drafted out of high school last June so this year is his age 19 season. He turns 20 on August 10.  And I'd really like to see the Brewers sign Kirby as well.

Brewers,3db306,MustBeNice,0,Thu Jul 16 09:08:54 2015 UTC,"I did forget Michael Brantley, honestly,  But there were 2 others in the trade that didn't pan out either. So 25% of the players we traded worked out, and it wasn't even the ""best"" prospect of the 4.  So I think it helps my opinion more than it hurts it.  Some players work out, some don't.  It's very hard to tell which will/won't."

Brewers,3db306,Nadie_AZ,9,Wed Jul 15 13:40:45 2015 UTC,"I still think the Greinke trade was a good move.  We got to the NLCS with Greinke.  Trades are always gambles, at least that one worked.  Some GMs make huge mid-season trades and don't make the play-offs, like Billy Beane just last year when they traded for Samardjiza, and the other cubs pitcher who ended up terrible.  You guys can criticize Doug Melvin all you want, but he doesn't have the payroll flexibility a lot of other teams do.  Sometimes we have to trade our cheap young talent we acquired through the draft to get veteran players for playoff pushes.  Until there is a major structural change in the finance system of MLB, that's just the way it is."
Brewers,3db306,Tuggernuts23,6,Wed Jul 15 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"My only gripe is not retaining Greinke or even Sabbathia. I'd gladly trade Garza, Broxton, and K-rod (Those 3 total cost more than Greinke) for Greinke."
Brewers,3db306,cheezturds,3,Wed Jul 15 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"That isn't true at all. Zack might be making the same amount as them this season, but it took a lot more than that to sign him in the first place.  His contract is back-loaded, meaning that the team pays him more in his later seasons for more financial flexbility earlier in his contract.  There was also a $12 million signing bonus.  So just because we could have paid him the same this season, does not mean we were very close to signing him.  This is how his contract breaks down (via here):   $12 million signing bonus 2013: $17 million 2014: $24 million 2015: $23 million 2016: $24 million 2017: $23 million 2018: $24 million   Edit: just realized it's not 2013 anymore.  I also might have massively mis-remembered Broxtons contract.  Investigation ongoing.  Edit2: I did massively mis-remember the broxton deal.  So you might be right that we could afford Greinke.  I'm still not sure that paying that much for one player is a good idea with our salary.  It's easy to say that now, with Garza and Broxton struggling, but paying Greinke $24.5 million would have literally been more than a quarter of our team salary any year except this one when we broke a $100 million total pay roll for the first time ever.  If we had done that, I'm sure people would be complaining about ""our bullpen fucking sucks"" (I guess it might soon anyway if we trade K-Rod).  I guess I'll end edit2 with apologizing for the stats, that ended up proving you were right.  I do think the more balanced deal with 1 SP and 2 RP is a better strategy for success than 1 really really good starting pitcher, but at the point it's more of a personal opinion, and you are free to believe what you want.  This whole conversation makes me want to play a baseball simulation game.  Edit 3: Also, Sabathia only had 3 more seasons for ~3 ERA.  Would you have been willing to give him $23 million a season for ERA's of 4.78, 5.28, and 5.47 in his last 3 seasons?"
Brewers,3db306,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Jul 15 13:46:23 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd rather have a legit number one starter instead of 4-5 number 4-5 starting pitchers on anyone else's roster. And as antisocial as he is, having a guy like that around younger guys might help more than the obvious abysmal pitching coaches we have. K-Rod is like a bug and always seems to wind up back here anyway so I'm cool with getting rid of him. Honestly though, this team needs to start doing a better job of drafting and developing their own pitchers, it's quite pathetic. You're right with the third edit though, I wouldn't take Sabathia on that deal with his numbers. Although with less pressure here than New York who knows how well he would have done."
Brewers,3db306,cheezturds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think Greinke's sociability was a concern at all.  As far as drafting is concerned I do think we're getting better.  With Lohse and Garza struggling, we're teetering on the brink of having all of our starters being home-grown talent if Peralta (who just started rehab), Nelson, Fiers, Jungman, and Cravey/Thornburg get the fifth spot.  So we're getting better.   And I kind of disagree with your first point.  I would rather have an ace than 4-5's only because 5 fifth-rotation starters is basically a worse case scenario.  I would definitely take 3 #2 starters over a #1, though."
Brewers,3db306,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:44 2015 UTC,Both the Sabathia and Greinke deals have early opt outs for the player.  CC used his and parlayed that into a bigger deal.  Zack's about to do the same thing.    I would have gladly signed them for the big deal with the opt out and taken that risk of getting 3 more great years.  Then let them get another huge contract elsewhere.
Brewers,3db306,jmeks23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"I would have gladly signed them for the big deal with the opt out and taken that risk of getting 3 more great years. Then let them get another huge contract elsewhere.   You're saying you would gladly sign them to the same deal they got initially with the Dodgers/Yankees, with the opt out so that they can get even more money when they're done with us? Ok, so what happens if they pitch like shit and don't opt out.  Now w'ere on the hook for $20+ million over multiple seasons.  I just don't think the Brewers can take on that type of risk.  Every contract has some risk, but the Brewers are more of a 3-year, $33 million risk (Lohse) risk.  Imagine if we were paying Lohse 20+million for this season and next.  I shudder to think.  Those are the deals that are hard for small teams to recover from."
Brewers,3db306,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not wrong.  Every big contract is a risk.  Just depends if you thought CC or Greinke was worth the risk?  CC - 7/161m Greinke - 6/147m  As opposed to Fielder's 9/214m which thus far hasn't been all that worth it. Though he's doing well this year again."
Brewers,3db306,jmeks23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"I think evaluating the risk is relative.  For the Yankees and Dodgers, sure, I'd pull that trigger every time.  They can afford to recover if it doesn't work out.  The Brewers, no, I don't think so.  That could prevent us from contending for a title for (worst case scenario) 6 or 7 years."

Brewers,3d1obu,ultra242,8,Sun Jul 12 21:25:10 2015 UTC,Ooooh
Brewers,3d1obu,OneLegsTheSame,2,Mon Jul 13 01:52:30 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see what it's like at Busch Stadium this September.
Brewers,3d1obu,prof_shine,4,Sun Jul 12 23:11:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, he has it coming. He not only cheated, he was a scumbag about it. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing Braun get traded. I think it would be better for both him and the Brewers. Brewers could move on, and Braun could further disconnect himself from the past.  Still nice to get another Brewer jersey in the game."
Brewers,3d1obu,fly1ngorb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love the Brewers and everything, but I feel kinda bitter about that whole PEDs thing.  So now our two All-Stars are a [former?] PED user, and a domestic abuser. Great."
Brewers,3d1obu,Beginnerwithnoluck,10,Mon Jul 13 14:38:31 2015 UTC,Obligatory.
Brewers,3d1obu,Il_Tenente,7,Sun Jul 12 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"Love it! Didn't think he'd get many more chances. Replacing a Cardinal too, they must be just THRILLED down there in STL. #TheCardinalWay"

Brewers,3d1obu,AemenLeny,3,Sun Jul 12 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if we assume he doesn't fail any more tests, to me, it proves it wasn't the drugs that made him a good player. Nice to see him make the ASG. The dude is powered by boo's. The louder they boo the better chance he has of crushing a ball. We should start booing him at MP really."
Brewers,3d1obu,matthewryan12,5,Mon Jul 13 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"So tired of people whining and complaining about Braun, especially hypocritical fans from other teams. The situation was handled badly, yes. But if you get in trouble and have millions of dollars at stake and your team of lawyers says ""here's how we are gonna try and get you out of this,"" I dare someone to say they wouldn't go along. If anyone is still truly bothered by the situation I suggest a little introspection, because it's just sports. We live in an age when people are not happy, indeed angry, about life in general. They need somewhere to vent that anger. So they choose public figures or the cause of the week. I lament we as a nation have come to not believe in second chances. Say something stupid on Twitter or Facebook and you are fired. Use PED's and listen to your lawyers and you are vilified forever. Just be careful throwing them stones people. Someday you may need a little forgiveness."

Brewers,3d2xhf,silentjay01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"He might be up in September, but 2016 is his more likely MLB debut."
Brewers,3d2xhf,jordo2323,4,Mon Jul 13 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"Or will we do what the Cubs did with Bryant and, even though he is ready to be a starter on the 26 man at the start of the season, we keep him in the minors for the first 3 weeks to get an extra year of control over his rookie contract?"
Brewers,3d2xhf,fly1ngorb,4,Mon Jul 13 03:57:30 2015 UTC,Hopefully that's exactly what will happen. The Brewers have no incentive at this point to rush Arcia. We need to keep control of him for as long as possible.
Brewers,3d2xhf,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"That's what I hope to see as well, but my hope isn't guaranteed to happen. EDIT: Especially since if the Brewers waited to get Team control over Arcia during more of his prime."

Brewers,3d2qjt,BeHereNow91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:12 2015 UTC,It was an earlier game and the Brewers wanted us there early so we could go over assignments and whatnot.  We had to be ready by noon.

Brewers,3d2qjt,TheBause,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:36:25 2015 UTC,I did!
Brewers,3d2qjt,TheBause,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:36:48 2015 UTC,"You were in costume, but didn't post pictures of said costume? C'mon man!"
Brewers,3d2qjt,TheBause,3,Mon Jul 13 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately don't have any from that day.  I walked up and down the club level a few times before an inattentive fan slammed into the back of me, breaking a strap holder.  Here's one from Discovery World Star Wars Day last October (or the October before, I don't remember).  I'm on the left!  I wanted to wear my Lucroy jersey over it, but I have back pieces that jut out and it wouldn't have sit comfortably.  Come join us at Discovery World on 10/17!"
Brewers,3d0xpk,fly1ngorb,5,Sun Jul 12 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"This article shows, not only the quality of player Gomez is, but the quality of person he is. It'll be a sad day when we see his name in headlines for another club."
Brewers,3d0xpk,b-VW,2,Sun Jul 12 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"One more year on that deal is why I think he's probably our most valuable trade offering right now. He's not just a 2-3 month rental for a team in the playoff hunt, they can get another year out of him, and in the case of a team like Anaheim or New York, they have the ability to sign him long term."
Brewers,3d0xpk,bamfra,2,Sun Jul 12 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"Carlos needs to go. He has tremendous defensive value but the approach at the plate is only going to get worse with age. If Carlos' speed went, which is likely as he's about to get into his thirties, he'd be a problem economocally for any team that takes on his potential contract. He's an exciting player, one that shows his talents a lot of the time, but he's not likely to age well into that contract. Sadly, this is something the Brewers cannot afford to gamble on either."
Brewers,3d0xpk,jordo2323,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"This doesn't shock me, this article essentially shows just who Gomez is."
Brewers,3d0xpk,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:02:38 2015 UTC,I think it is interesting to hear both Lucroy and Gomez talk about the trade possibilities. Two completely different perspectives on what could happen to be the same outcome.
Brewers,3d0xpk,The_Bostache,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:37:00 2015 UTC,What a class act.
Brewers,3d0xpk,dcandap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:24 2015 UTC,This article reinforces how much I love Gomez. Really gonna miss him when he's gone (whenever it eventually happens).

Brewers,3d2820,Valleyoan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:26:56 2015 UTC,I'll save the Brewers millions of dollars: I'll take 1/3 of Broxton's pay and be just as bad.

Brewers,3czj2g,McCaber,8,Sun Jul 12 09:33:33 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say Jungmann has earned a stay in the show even after Peralta returns.  So Lohse or Garza need to get lost. Or we need to go to a 6-man rotation or something.
Brewers,3czj2g,Valleyoan,3,Sun Jul 12 05:20:16 2015 UTC,Lohse will be moved soon. Although then we have Cravy to consider.
Brewers,3czj2g,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:36:51 2015 UTC,Who's going want him though? He's having an awful year
Brewers,3czj2g,smiles134,3,Sun Jul 12 05:42:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think a better way for me to word this is he will moved off the team soon, which could just be him getting DFA'd. But some team out there may take a flier."
Brewers,3czj2g,theamazingkiwi,3,Sun Jul 12 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Peralta's estimate is at least two more rehab starts (after today, so at least 10 days plus ASB) so we're pushing to late July. Lots of time to give Lohse away or get a single-A outfielder for Garza. I wonder if someone gets one of those two as a package deal to take Parra..."

Brewers,3czj2g,smiles134,2,Sun Jul 12 05:17:32 2015 UTC,Do they think they are buyers?  They look about 5-6 back of the second WC and are 6 back of their Division.
Brewers,3czj2g,silentjay01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:22:04 2015 UTC,"It depends on how they feel about their team and their current/future outlook. I wouldn't be surprised if they went either way.

Brewers,3cy8yn,BeHereNow91,7,Sat Jul 11 21:29:29 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate, but yeah, seems like he's going to be an injury-plagued bench player for the rest of his career (which probably isn't going to last much longer). Happens to tall athletes with knee problems.  While we're on that subject, Rickie Weeks got DFA'd and later released by the Mariners weeks ago, so it looks like his professional career is probably over."
Brewers,3cy8yn,SolidRambo,9,Sat Jul 11 22:04:54 2015 UTC,"It's a shame. Those two were part of some of my favorite Brewers teams ever (late 2000s, early 2010s).  Weird to look at where they all are now.    Fielder's had success with a couple different teams, but not quite to the level he had with the Brewers.    Weeks and Hart have both seen their careers diminish after stints in Seattle, although Hart may still have something left as a bench player with his power.  Braun's obviously had a tumultuous few seasons but it looks like he's returning to form.  I think his MVP caliber seasons are behind him, though, as injuries keep nagging him.    Hardy's continued to have hot and cold seasons with the Orioles, as he did with Milwaukee.    Edit:  autocorrected Hardy to ""Harry"".  Yer a shortstop, Harry!"
Brewers,3cy8yn,SolidRambo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:51:30 2015 UTC,"Aye. Though a silver lining of our old squad is that Gallardo is pitching like a boss in Texas. Mid 2 ERA, second best FIP of his career. Actually, come to think of it, Axford is pitching incredibly for Colorado.. he's 16/17 for saves this year."
Brewers,3cy8yn,SolidRambo,2,Sun Jul 12 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"At 2.67, that's Yo's lowest career ERA by almost a full run.  Maybe Maddux is helping?"
Brewers,3cy8yn,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"Gotta be. Looking at his other stats suggest he's playing the best year of his career too (second lowest FIP, lowest WHIP, lowest HR/9... though his K/9 is the weakest yet). He'll probably get paid nicely next year; I could see him staying with the Rangers because it's close to home.  Good to see he may finally have taken the step up to a true ace."
Brewers,3cy8yn,gopher33j,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:05:20 2015 UTC,Did Maddux and Gallardo overlap when he was pitching coach for the Brewers?

Brewers,3cxp55,theamazingkiwi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the farm system looks strong right now, much better than it was a few years ago."
Brewers,3cxp55,theamazingkiwi,3,Sat Jul 11 18:53:00 2015 UTC,Let's make it even stronger by adding more prospects at the deadline!
Brewers,3cxp55,fly1ngorb,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"Don't get your hopes up for a complete fire sale.   I'd be surprised if they trade anyone more than Parra, Lind, Gomez, Ramirez, and Lohse if they can get anything."
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,3,Sat Jul 11 21:14:50 2015 UTC,I wish they'd just go to a 6 man rotation. There's nothing to lose at this point.
Brewers,3cxp55,SolidRambo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But Lohse probably isn't going anywhere; he is arguably the worst starting pitcher in baseball this year and trading him to a team that wants him in the bullpen wouldn't net much more than some very low level prospect. I mean I certainly wouldn't object to him being traded, but he either stays or gets released later this season ala Randy Wolf. I hope I'm wrong about that, though.  It really sucks for us. Give him an ERA and FIP that's average, even slightly below average (or if we're being greedy, somewhat above average like he was in 2013 and 2014) and he has trade value (e.g., Guthrie in KC has been pretty awful this year, as have other pitchers on competing teams like Tillman in Baltimore)."
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,-5,Sat Jul 11 22:25:01 2015 UTC,"The worst part is there's no chance for a silver lining, like say, a no-hitter or perfect game; because our defense is fucking pathetic. Ryan Braun and Khris Davis are not major league defenders. There are tons of bloops to the outfield that will fall for hits because they let up. And unfortunately their offense doesn't really make up for it.   I've said it before and I'll say it again, fuckin' trade or drop everyone over the age of 30. I'm sick of watching these jokers."
Brewers,3cxp55,theamazingkiwi,5,Sat Jul 11 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Dude you are really salty, read this article http://milwaukee.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2015/07/07/dont-judge-khris-davis-for-what-he-isnt/ Lesson: Khris Davis is a league average player despite his throwing arm."
Brewers,3cxp55,CJL13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:35:14 2015 UTC,But why put him in the outfield?
Brewers,3cxp55,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:58:03 2015 UTC,Apparently he can't play first.
Brewers,3cxp55,crewblue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:01:52 2015 UTC,They tried him at first in the Arizona Fall League a few years ago and it didn't go well.
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,-4,Wed Jul 15 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Please don't ever link me to a Derek Harvey article again, the guy is a baseball fuck-wad always cherry-picking sabermetrics to back his terrible arguments.   No, khrush is not league average 'despite his throwing arm.' His offense is league average, yes, but he is not. No he doesn't take good routes. If a ball is hit over his head he looks like a girl in PE class, but that probably explains why he's always playing back near the warning track and bloopers are always falling in front of him. The only time he takes good routes is when the ball is hit directly in front of him; like the sliding foul ball catch the other night. And Yes it is a liability when a guy like Pierzynski can go from first to third on a ball hit directly to him in LF. One of the slowest guys in baseball didn't hesitate to take an extra bag on him. That's a serious liability that doesn't show up in any score-keeping sheet or sabermetrics categories, only against the pitcher on the mound and the team as a whole.   Yes I am salty. I like guys that hit for average and guys that play great defense, it's a recipe for success. He is neither of those things."
Brewers,3cxp55,theamazingkiwi,5,Sat Jul 11 21:55:19 2015 UTC,"My apologies for linking an article from an Author you don't like, i'll remember that from now on. Anyways, My defense for Davis is that he is labelled as a 50 FV asset from Kiley Mcdaniel and is set to produce 2WAR/600 PA, which is a solid indicator of an average player. However, I can see why you would argue otherwise, since there are flaws that could cause others to see otherwise, especially if they do value OBP and plus defense as a whole. This argument becomes much more interesting then when you consider the ballpark in question, whereas, would Khris be valued less in a spacious ballpark like in SF when compared to his value at Miller Park."
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:37:07 2015 UTC,"lol sorry, just got a bit of a grudge against Harvey for the past few years, he likes to spew  false crap about guys he doesn't like sometimes, and I mentioned the cherry-picked sabermetrics already.  On to Khrush, I do think his value drops significantly in a pitcher-friendly park. His HR potential is his biggest upside, if you cut in to that at all, his value starts to diminish rapidly.   I'm very curious to see how statisticians use the new technology when calculating range-factor for out-fielders. I'm hoping it will bring value to guys who's skillset of getting good jumps on balls in play and covering a lot of ground were previously invaluable. And also hope it shows how bad some other guys really are."
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,2,Sun Jul 12 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"Occasionally Khris will make a spectacular catch and I think his defense is getting better. Then I watch him try to throw the ball! And last night I thought Braun should have tried a bit harder to get to Pederson's liner, but he made the safe play. And Braun goes full retard when he has to track the ball near the foul line for whatever reason. It has been a disappointing season in pretty much all respects."
Brewers,3cxp55,CJL13,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Davis' arm has to be the laughing stock of the league. It is the weakest arm I've ever seen in professional baseball, by far. I think it's safe to assume David Ortiz has a better arm than him. Last Tuesday night when AJ Pierzynski was on first base, there was a base-hit to left field.. and Pierzynski went to third on the play. That's just mind-boggling. It's a huge liability and his offense does not make up for it."
Brewers,3cxp55,Valleyoan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"My 15 year old brother could probably outthrow him, no joke."
Brewers,3cxp55,TheBause,2,Sat Jul 11 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"And yet people want to trade Parra instead, you know a guy with an actual arm."

Brewers,3cr4vm,DatWasStrange,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:01 2015 UTC,Amen to this. Had those seats for a 1pm game on a Sunday. It was the hottest day of that summer. I don't think I've ever checked the progress of shade getting to me more than that game.

Brewers,3cr4vm,BeHereNow91,3,Fri Jul 10 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite seats in the stadium. Terrace Reserve is a no brainer; the bleachers view just isn't that great. The crowds aren't a factor whichever way you go; it's rare that fans get too rowdy.  You want the lowest row you can get in the Terrace. Anything lower than 12 is really a treat, and the view is excellent. But if you're sitting in row 20, you'll feel pretty removed from the game.  If for a few bucks more you can upgrade to Terrace Reserve, do it. Fantastic view from those sections."
Brewers,3cr4vm,Nashwaukee,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:02 2015 UTC,I like the bleachers because I feel more involved in the game.  Terrace is just too far up there for me.
Brewers,3cr4vm,smiles134,2,Sun Jul 12 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"Howdy OP, for a Saturday night game, the bleachers are normally pretty belligerent, with your high schoolers and college kids and generally young people, Left Field moreso than Right field loge. Right field field bleachers are normally not too bad at all. Terrace is a mixed bag, you'll never know what you'll find up there. Terrace Box is generally pretty good anywhere upstairs, it still feels like you're ""close"" to the action while also being way far up and saving money on the lower ticket prices compared to the rest of the stadium!   If I had to reccommend where to sit though, I would pony up or try and find a good deal on stubhub/seatgeek for club level tickets.  Wider seats, nicer concourse and bathrooms, generally no drunks, inseat service if you're in 'club infield', a club level only bar, just so many great things that enhances a ballpark experience.   Of course, you may know all of this already if you're familiar with the ballpark, but I am not sure, so I figured I would try and help anyway! Have fun!"
Brewers,3cr4vm,Nashwaukee,2,Fri Jul 10 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Belligerent? I've sat left field bleachers on Friday nights plenty of times and I've never seen anyone being anything close to belligerent.
Brewers,3cr4vm,smiles134,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:24 2015 UTC,Friday nights are very different than Saturday nights in my experience.

Brewers,3cpd2c,brewcrew2_2,3,Thu Jul 9 18:46:18 2015 UTC,excellent summation and analysis.
Brewers,3cpd2c,BrewCrewKevin,5,Thu Jul 9 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"The season so far:  O god we suck. Sooooo bad.  Hey, we fired RR and are starting to play better, maybe...  JK we still suck.  Holy shit 8 in a row, where the hell did this come from. No longer the worst team in baseball.  Lose 2/3 to the Braves.  As far as the trade deadline goes, I'm thinking: for sure gone: Rami.  going to be interest, probably gone: Gomez, Will Smith, KRod, Cotts, Parra.  WTS: Garza, Lohse, Braun, Siggy.  I'm probably forgetting a bunch, just off the top of my head."
Brewers,3cpd2c,allonbacuth,2,Thu Jul 9 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"Will Smith might not go yet.  Theres a lot of time left on his deal iirc, not exactly a guy you look to dump unless theres a REALLY good offer.  Gomez probably 'should' be, but he still has next year on his contract, too."
Brewers,3cpd2c,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"With Alex Gordon going down for 2 months minimum in KC last night, I think the Royals just became interested in Parra or maybe even Gomez."

Ryan Braun (because while we may trade away a lot of guys No Team will want to pick up enough of that contract)."
Brewers,3cpd2c,silentjay01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:59:30 2015 UTC,You think we will deal luc?
Brewers,3cpd2c,allonbacuth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should make him off limits.  Between being an All-Star last year, his strong defense, and team-friendly contract, the Brewers could wrangle a Richie Sexton level deal with Lucroy.  I could see a team like the Astros (who are usually a sub .500 team) selling off the farm like the Brewers did a few years back and they just so happen to have a catcher who is barely hitting above the Mendoza Line."
Brewers,3cpd2c,silentjay01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"You know, its probably the right move but I would still be sad."
Brewers,3cpd2c,allonbacuth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:46 2015 UTC,Yeah they got Smith locked in on the cheap.  He won't go
Brewers,3cpd2c,Not_Kirby_Delauter,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:39 2015 UTC,"To sum up your season a bit differently:  O god. We suck. Soooo bad.  Hey we fired RR and started to play better! (meaning .500)  Woops, right back into a slump. Not so good afterall.  WINNING STEAK! Back to ~.500 under Craig! (still no chance)  Right on with the trades. Rami for sure. Gomez, KRod, Cotts, and Parra are also excellent trade bargains. I would hesitate to get rid of Segura I think, and I don't know if people will want Braun's baggage. And Luc is off limits if you ask me. Garza and Lohse are decent chips too, but doing terrible this year."
Brewers,3cpd2c,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"This is siggys last year on contract and I don't know if he will resign. They were not able to come to terms last year, and I kinda get the feeling he wants to be somewhere else. It's too bad because he is a great athlete, hopefully I'm wrong.  I don't think anyone will take Braun. Bad PR move and he is grossly overpaid for a long time (2018? 2019?). Still, I'm hopeful someone will need his bat.  At this point I would take a high five for Garza or Lohse. Huge contracts and we have Fiers, Nelson, and the Tyler/Taylor squad that are all looking promising and could use the starts."
Brewers,3cpd2c,allonbacuth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"""This is siggys last year on contract and I don't know if he will resign""  No. He has 3 seasons of control left."

Brewers,3cpd2c,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:14 2015 UTC,I'd like to believe that we can ship Parra and Rami off to the Mets or something.
Brewers,3cpd2c,TheBause,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Garza and Lohse are huge fucking mistakes. IF either of them is starting, DO NOT WATCH! I REPEAT, IF GARZA OR LOHSE IS STARTING, STEER CLEAR.  Khris Davis has the arm of a 12 year old girl.   Gerrardo Parra has been red hot the past couple weeks, so we bench him for Khris Davis.  Aramis needs to go, he's an absolute rally killer and runs as fast as a 5 year old.   Jungmann has been surprisingly good. Cravy has been surprisingly decent. They both deserve to stay in the rotation."

And I don't know if anybody would take Braun and his history. He's got some baggage.  Broxton I could see though. He is a vet that makes a few million and we only have him under contract 1 more year IIRC  here's to hoping! Honestly, I'm feeling repetitive, but I would have so much more fun following trade rumors and news on this team actively selling and rebuilding than I ever would watching us compete for 4th in the division."
Brewers,3cljrf,smiles134,3,Wed Jul 8 21:43:48 2015 UTC,His contract runs out after this year but there's a 2016 team option for $9mm with a $1mm buyout that any team would be insane to take. It's doubtful he gets moved unless it's for literally peanuts.

Brewers,3cm1uz,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic interview. Some really heavy questions, and Luc was insanely honest about them. Talking about how Ryan Braun was the last 1st-rounder to pan out 10 years ago, how the Grienke and CC trades cleaned us right out, and we're still the smallest media market. The guy gets it.   Obviously we all do, but it's refreshing hearing it from somebody who is somewhat on the inside of it."
Brewers,3cm1uz,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"It's always nice to hear honesty from somebody in Lucroy's position, but Nick Zettel from Disciples of Uecker did a pretty stinging rebuke:  http://disciplesofuecker.com/friday-round-em-up-trade-lucroy-attanasio-tanking/23487   I bolded one particular line that made me extremely angry: does Lucroy not understand that he was a part of one of the worst collapses in MLB history? Or is this his way of expressing that frustration? What I find extremely upsetting about that quote is that the Brewers were excellent last year! They were not only in first place deep into August, they were fighting the Nationals for homefield advantage for the entire National League playoffs! To hear Lucroy simply describe that under the guise of, “the last three or four years have been a battle” is disheartening. Perhaps you should have battled more to win last year? Where is the leadership to take a team that is fighting for the top spot in the NL in August into the playoffs at the end of September?"

And I don't blame him.   I am surprised at how perceptive he is with the farm system, though. He sounds like one of us when he's talking about the poor farm system management and poor drafting."
Brewers,3cm1uz,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:42:36 2015 UTC,Yeah... a little. He just wants to win.
Brewers,3cm1uz,The_Bostache,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:59:18 2015 UTC,Can't blame him but at the same time I think he was kind of spoiled by coming up to the majors when he did. I mean within his first two years they were arguably the best the organization has been aside from the 1982 team.

Brewers,3ck3q9,aaronaroma,0,Wed Jul 8 21:18:59 2015 UTC,because he has a love affair with Avilan. who i dont think should be on the team after last season. put him as my least favorite current brave in the survey thing

Brewers,3ck3q9,Itypedthesewords,0,Wed Jul 8 20:32:47 2015 UTC,its baffling really. sometimes Fredi monitors pitch counts too tightly. other times he just throws people out there and lets them flounder. with Teheran's road history and being blown up in the 7th inning before after pitching 6 strong... i have reason to question it.

Brewers,3cgakc,frakking-anustart,3,Tue Jul 7 18:45:49 2015 UTC,You'd think he'd at least be called up to AAA at some point this season.
Brewers,3cgakc,meltedlaundry,2,Tue Jul 7 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"He could honestly be a callup when rosters expand. Nothing really to lose this season, and there's a chance we offload some of the infield at the deadline."
Brewers,3cgakc,miamiflashfan,3,Tue Jul 7 18:55:13 2015 UTC,I think he'd be in AAA if our new affiliate didn't play their home games in high elevation Colorado
Brewers,3cgakc,sdogg,2,Wed Jul 8 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Probably stays at AA. Many teams have their AAA rosters mostly filled with career minor leaguers and so the play at the AA level can actually be higher because they are young, MLB-bound players trying to develop consistency."

Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:26:44 2015 UTC,I still hate him.
Brewers,3ch1b6,thekidfromyesterday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think we mostly try to pretend that that thing never happened.  Before and after it, he's just been really active in the city and I met him in 2011 and he seemed like a good guy, so it's just too bad that his reputation tanked.  I acknowledge that he acted douchey throughout the whole ordeal, and maybe he is just a huge dick, I don't know, but I'm just focused on him playing well now."
Brewers,3ch1b6,fly1ngorb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:32:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't heard anything about it since. He was kind of a douche through the ordeal, but after he admitted it I knew things would get better for him. Every player that has just owned up to it seems to have been okay afterward (Giambi is a great example)"
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,4,Wed Jul 8 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe he handled it poorly while the whole thing was going down. But the thing with that is, the fact that he was being investigated for failing a drug test was illegally leaked. That information is supposed to be confidential until the appeal is complete. Since he won his appeal, no one should even know about the failed drug test to this day. So yeah, he lied and threw that guy under the bus, but he never should have had to make a statement in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, I hate the fact that he cheated."
Brewers,3ch1b6,mistrbrownstone,2,Wed Jul 8 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"Good point about the leak and appeals process. I think the fact that he is generally pretty well liked aside from that helps his case, too."
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"He's stayed out of the spotlight for sure, and playing in Milwaukee definitely helps.  I won't lie, once in a while I think of how he handled it and get bummed out for a few minutes haha.  Rarely, really never, do we see  big time players sign huge contracts here so it would be nice if he had a clean reputation, but what can ya do."

Brewers,3ch1b6,jn2010,4,Wed Jul 8 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"Lol you seem kind of sensitive, I was just genuinely curious. I know you aren't a fan of us being over here, but honestly we are a pretty friendly group overall. We aren't mean spirited or anything... and hell, our team is currently under .500, so we aren't in any position to talk shit to people."
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,-4,Wed Jul 8 02:35:07 2015 UTC,Not sure how you got that impression.  I've expressed my annoyance with some of you but that isn't relevant to a steroid discussion.  I was merely explaining how bringing up a single player's steroid abuse is hypocritical because every team has players who have ties to steroids.  I'm sorry if my debate technique is too aggressive for you.
Brewers,3ch1b6,jn2010,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"Actually they are completely different scenarios. The Braun ordeal was huge because 1) he was active at the time the test results came out and 2) he had just won MVP and was widely regarded as the best player in baseball. The players you named were all either retired, or about to retire. Braun was the first young, star player to get hit with a positive PED test (that we know of)... not really sure how you can't see that they are different situations..."
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:45:02 2015 UTC,"Fine, look at Jhonny Peralta and the slew of names that were just released. People still signed them and the fans have forgiven them. The media makes everything worse. Peralta doesn't seem as bad because his case wasn't leaked."
Brewers,3ch1b6,MasterCashier,-2,Wed Jul 8 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"I gues ARod doesn't count then.  And getting caught after the fact doesn't excuse you of charges.  Good for them for finishing their careers before the hammer dropped, but no, I don't see the difference."
Brewers,3ch1b6,jn2010,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"A-rod is a closer example than the rest, but still kind of different. You're a salty one."
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:51:23 2015 UTC,I should point out that I have been very critical of Braun in the past few years.  I just think it's funny that you can throw stones when it's been an institutional problem for a very long time.
Brewers,3ch1b6,jn2010,4,Wed Jul 8 02:53:43 2015 UTC,Throw stones? Because I asked about what fans thought of him? Are we reading the same thread?
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,0,Wed Jul 8 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"So I should have just said that I view him just like every other PED user in the leagues history, including multiple Braves players.  That would have circumvented this discussion, huh?"

Brewers,3ch1b6,allonbacuth,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:16 2015 UTC,I like this example
Brewers,3ch1b6,Dizzydsmith,2,Wed Jul 8 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"It's a mix. What he did was awful but, I think he has paid his dues. He was suspended and apologized to the fans and the carrier. He's just like all of the other guys that have done it. His was made worse because of all of the media attention"
Brewers,3ch1b6,MasterCashier,0,Wed Jul 8 02:28:02 2015 UTC,i would be much more accepting of him if he had just not lied about it to begin with.
Brewers,3ch1b6,PickShark,4,Wed Jul 8 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"But if you look at it, they are all just as bad. They all lie when they take it. Braun's was made a lot worse due to the media attention. It was leaked against MLB rules."
Brewers,3ch1b6,MasterCashier,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"well... i mean there are more than a few who fess up when caught. it was the whole thing with appealing the suspension on tampering with evidence and whatnot. and it still being true. if he'd accepted the suspension then, I'd be okay with it. also would have cost him significantly fewer games in suspension  Edit: it should be noted that i'm really not condoning the cheating at all and it'll tarnish any player in my view. but the whole fiasco with Braun just grinds me particularly badly."
Brewers,3ch1b6,PickShark,3,Wed Jul 8 02:38:33 2015 UTC,Even though Braun actually did cheat that doesn't remove the carrier from the equation. That guy still screwed up and didn't do his job correctly. Braun used reasonable doubt like anybody would. I'm not saying it was right but he should have done his job correctly.

Brewers,3ch1b6,The_Bostache,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:44:11 2015 UTC,"Hey Brew Bros, I know y'all are having a tough season but I really don't know your organization very well.  Is this an expected 'in the gutter' season during a rebuild or is this a worst case scenario?  What do you guys have as far as expectations for the next few years?  I always have had a soft spot for y'all and Boston, because, eskimo brothers."
Brewers,3ch1b6,Crotalus_B,2,Wed Jul 8 01:43:49 2015 UTC,I expected about .500 this year. Sent a middling pitcher to the Jays for Lind at 1B and traded Gallardo for prospects but otherwise a largely stable roster. Braun's thumb isn't giving him nearly as much trouble this year so things were looking up offensively.  But both Gomez and Lucroy have been out with injuries and haven't hit their stride yet. Lohse has fallen off in a big way.  Next few years will be rough as Ramirez and Gomez (and probably Lind) will leave and be replaced by marginal players. I doubt management will sign many free agents because there will be so many holes to fill.
Brewers,3ch1b6,unmisunderestimated,5,Wed Jul 8 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"We weren't sure what to expect this season, but the organization still wanted to win now.  They kept the same team that was 51-33 through June last year and suffered a major collapse, giving them another chance.  So it's very disappointing and somewhat confusing since we finally have a productive first baseman.  They have talent, but it's time to accept that this group won't be a winner and enter a rebuild.  We're pretty anxious to see how the front office handles it, because when Mark Attanasio bought the team 10 years ago we were up and coming, and he's never been in a situation like this."
Brewers,3ch1b6,fly1ngorb,0,Wed Jul 8 01:48:23 2015 UTC,honestly you aren't in a much different position than Atlanta then. just  cursed by being in a better division. Our 2013 roster was obviously talented and won games. and then 2014 was largely the same team... but they stopped winning. I'm amazed we accepted rebuild mode so quickly and more amazed that it hasnt been 100% pure fire sale rebuild like most teams end up. they kept a few core guys and have pieced together a solid enough roster to hang around .500. with luck our recently acquired talent will hit the bigs and we'll start winning again. sometimes lightning rebuilds can happen. maybe it'll be you guys next.
Brewers,3ch1b6,PickShark,2,Wed Jul 8 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our farm system is pretty barren from going all out in 2011 and failure to draft successfully.  I don't think we've had a first round pick that has made an impact since Braun in 2005.  It might be a few years...it's just even more difficult because many of the guys at the Major League level aren't very old and are former All-Stars, but they can garner good returns at the deadline hopefully.  Uncertain future to say the least."
Brewers,3ch1b6,fly1ngorb,0,Wed Jul 8 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"if there wasnt such a huge concern with not drafting well, the best trades are taking on some dead salary for talent on the roster and getting early round picks. it would also be wise to save a few trades for the offseason to find the team trying to go all in on 2016."

Brewers,3ce9g5,CJL13,-1,Tue Jul 7 06:00:14 2015 UTC,"My major problem with Haudricourt has been that he always simply touts the company line when reporting on the Brewers, especially when it comes to prospects.  He lists almost every one of those players as potentially having a solid impact.  I have no doubt that the organization believes this, but there is tremendous risk in 90% of the players on that list, and the potential is there for them to top out in AA or AAA and never have any impact at all.  Arcia is the only guy on that list with a clear potential for big league impact."

Brewers,3cci0b,necropaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"Parra would probably come relatively cheap.    Will Smith though...pretty sure we have him locked down for a while, and on a cheap contract iirc.  That one would probably be a hard deal to drive."
Brewers,3cci0b,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Well, we traded a mid level outfield prospect and a mid level pitching prospect for Parra a year ago. Probably doesn't take much to pry him away now but he is hitting much better now than he was at the time the Brewers traded for him.  Defence has been OK; he's been moving around a lot since all of the Brewers outfielders have missed stretches of tone with injuries.  Smith will probably get stretched out next spring and get a look in the starting rotation. No reason for the Brewers to trade him now since he's still pre-arbitration unless you overpay."
Brewers,3cci0b,ANumenorean,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:17:10 2015 UTC,Are there any specific positions that the Brewers see as a pressing concern in the near future? Organizational weaknesses?
Brewers,3cci0b,ANumenorean,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"1B/3B there are no prospects of note even close to sniffing MLB and limited depth in the lower minors. Outfield depth is decent, but no high ceiling talent there outside of Clint Coulter. Lots of defensive capable shortstops and one all around stud in Orlando Arcia. There's a lot of pitching depth and a lot of pitchers performing well, some outperforming peripherals, some posting great ones, but overall no ""scout recognized"" front of the rotation type of pitchers in the minors at the moment."
Brewers,3cci0b,PocketWocket,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Would [Matt Reynolds] be enough for Parra, then? Second round pick, crushed the ball in AA last year but hasn't been as good at AAA this year."
Brewers,3cci0b,ANumenorean,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"Reynolds is a decent mid tier prospect and if the need was there it might make sense, but he doesn't do a lot for them because they already have Segura at the MLB level, and Arcia at AA. Arcia at this point is a much better future option than Reynolds. But on the flip side, depth is always good and you can't ask for that much for a rental of a player the caliber of Parra, even if he is raking right now."
Brewers,3cci0b,PocketWocket,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. Also, can Parra play CF?"
Brewers,3cci0b,crewblue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:48:51 2015 UTC,He plays CF when Gomez is out.
Brewers,3cci0b,ANumenorean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:49:43 2015 UTC,How'd he look out there?
Brewers,3cci0b,crewblue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:42:02 2015 UTC,"He's serviceable in CF, not a butcher and decent range/arm. He just won't make those insane how-the-hell-did-he-close-that-distance type catches."
Brewers,3cci0b,ANumenorean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"Disagree with the other guy, he's fast and has really good pick up on the ball and gets good jumps."
Brewers,3cci0b,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any position the Brewers couldn't use more of in the minors. Even catchers and shortstops, because they can easily be converted to other positions. The first thing the Brewers should be looking at with any potential trade is the player's talent and ceiling."
Brewers,3cci0b,silentjay01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"Catchers and Shortstops have tremendous value because they are premium defensive positions, if they aren't great hitters and are moved off of those positions, they become less valuable."
Brewers,3cci0b,silentjay01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:45:29 2015 UTC,Somewhat true but that didn't stop the Cubs from moving Addison Russell to second because they already had Sterlin Castro and Javy Baez at short. They traded for him anyways because he was a top 10 prospect.
Brewers,3cci0b,silentjay01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, but come on, there's no comparison between Addison Russell and Matt Reynolds. You don't turn down a player like Russell. Also, the Cubs were fairly well set at 1B/3B with Rizzo and Bryant coming up this year, a luxury Milwaukee does not have."

Let's just remember that this is the same team that started 51-32 last year, and if we go 50-28 the rest of the way, there is a chance.   Of course, we might lose the next 6 and this will look silly.  Shit this already looks silly, I know in the back of my head we dug too deep a hole. I also have no idea what to expect at the deadline.  Personally, I never expected a firesale.

Still 10 out of the wildcard, which would still amount to 2 games under .500 if everything were to go perfect the next 10 games.  the success is only leading to more candidates for trade at the deadline, so we'll have an even more gutted team come the end of July.  is this cynical enough?

Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 5 19:11:05 2015 UTC,This is fun
Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,3,Sun Jul 5 19:08:10 2015 UTC,I'm watching the Reds broadcast and after that Lind bomb they have entered into complete despair. After how this season has gone this road trip has been so awesome!
Brewers,3c73aw,Gritsandgravy1,3,Sun Jul 5 19:07:14 2015 UTC,You can see their perspective though.  We're suppose to be the worst team in baseball and we're crushing them.  I'd be pretty down too.
Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, and their tears taste so sweet!"
Brewers,3c73aw,Gritsandgravy1,5,Sun Jul 5 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"I may be getting a little too ambitious, but at least where we stand we're 3 games back of the Reds with them going into Washington for the next few games. We could realistically leapfrog them if we keep this up."
Brewers,3c73aw,Free_Willy24,2,Sun Jul 5 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think this team believes it can make a run for the second playoff spot. It's a really, really, really long shot, but if the players believe they can do it....  I just hope the front office is smarter."
Brewers,3c73aw,madman86,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"The front office is just killing us. Before this road trip I was completely sold that this team was crap and we needed to offload everybody, but I might be starting to believe."
Brewers,3c73aw,Free_Willy24,2,Sun Jul 5 19:56:56 2015 UTC,98th hit.
Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,2,Sun Jul 5 19:06:03 2015 UTC,We finally have a first baseman.
Brewers,3c73aw,BeHereNow91,2,Sun Jul 5 19:05:07 2015 UTC,Not for long

Brewers,3c73aw,BeHereNow91,2,Sun Jul 5 19:28:49 2015 UTC,I'm digging July so far.
Brewers,3c73aw,brewcrew2_2,3,Sun Jul 5 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"You know, it was almost exactly a year ago when we started to suck horribly.  Maybe we just had a 1 year curse on us for some reason."
Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"the curse of the fan's hubris, perhaps?"
Brewers,3c73aw,TheGobler,3,Sun Jul 5 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"If we combine the first half of last year and the second half this year so far, we're a real baseball team!  What's frustrating is it's been pretty much the exact same team."
Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 5 19:05:53 2015 UTC,So this seven game road trip so far: 97 hits and 53 runs.  Dibs on r/baseball post
Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 5 19:03:16 2015 UTC,Wait till after this game and 100 hits.
Brewers,3c73aw,tej88,3,Sun Jul 5 19:04:46 2015 UTC,Adam fucking Lind. My god.

Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,3,Sun Jul 5 18:39:15 2015 UTC,"Man, if we could pull off a 2015 Brewers-like run we might not be out of this race."
Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,4,Sun Jul 5 18:36:10 2015 UTC,Those 2015 Brewers really took off.  It'll make a great 30for30 on their World Series title.
Brewers,3c73aw,BeHereNow91,2,Sun Jul 5 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yeah. If we cant make it i'd at least like to beat the cubs up enough the second half to make them miss the wild card."

Brewers,3c73aw,TheBause,3,Sun Jul 5 18:32:27 2015 UTC,Like turn this into a Christian sub?
Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 5 18:33:24 2015 UTC,Something like that.  Or trying to ban all the subscribers of /r/chicubs at once.  *edit my phone auto corrects something to sething.

Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:29:37 2015 UTC,What kind of fastball does jungmann throw?
Brewers,3c73aw,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:27:43 2015 UTC,I think it's a four-seamer but it gets natural tail and sink because of his arm angle.
Brewers,3c73aw,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought but his velocity is lower than I'd expect, so I thought maybe he was throwing something else"
Brewers,3c73aw,smiles134,2,Sun Jul 5 18:33:11 2015 UTC,My favorite thing about Braun getting a hit is Rock's praising his swing and how good of a hitter he is EVERY TIME.
Brewers,3c73aw,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:24:37 2015 UTC,I'll take it!
Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:24:12 2015 UTC,That was a good double play
Brewers,3c73aw,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:23:40 2015 UTC,awwww yeeeah
Brewers,3c73aw,Vetro777,3,Sun Jul 5 18:23:26 2015 UTC,Our offense is too good. More RBI for Lind.   Lind ties franchise record with ninth game in a row with a RBI.
Brewers,3c73aw,TheBause,2,Sun Jul 5 18:23:25 2015 UTC,Yiss

Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,3,Sun Jul 5 17:47:23 2015 UTC,I don't know how much longer I can listen to these chuckleheads on the Reds broadcast.
Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,3,Sun Jul 5 17:42:01 2015 UTC,felt that the other night when the one guy decided to dedicate an inning to complaining about the women's national soccer team having white jerseys with green numbers

Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"6th Inning, that's still pretty early in a 3 run game."

Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:34:28 2015 UTC,Good inning but... getting contact 3 times makes me nervous.
Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"Rock seems pretty convinced that was intentional, but I'm not that sure. I hope it wasn't."

Brewers,3c73aw,DrinkWisconsinably,2,Sun Jul 5 17:19:07 2015 UTC,Their announcers are bitches. Have been forever.
Brewers,3c73aw,DEUCE_SLUICE,3,Sun Jul 5 18:18:19 2015 UTC,What did he do?
Brewers,3c73aw,smiles134,3,Sun Jul 5 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"He was just chatting with Votto at 1st.  You know, like you see most players do."
Brewers,3c73aw,jn2010,2,Sun Jul 5 17:22:41 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was his routine at the plate where he'd take his time between pitches.  It's petty though.
Brewers,3c73aw,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Jul 5 17:26:09 2015 UTC,Yeah it was both.  Right after I posted the first one he went on his rant about team fraternization and how it hurts the fans somehow.

Brewers,3c73aw,Pfloyd3333,4,Sun Jul 5 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just bitching about it on the air.  ""Well this is just getting ridiculous.  If Joe West were behind the plate he'd tell Braun..."" and then continued to complain after the walk."

Brewers,3c4ub9,Pfloyd3333,2,Sun Jul 5 00:48:02 2015 UTC,I feel it is one of the most underrated stats in the sport.  I'd like to actually see the pitch count include pick off throws since they take just as much of a toll on the arm.

Brewers,3bzqxn,adam7765,2,Fri Jul 3 15:19:45 2015 UTC,My guess is that they're trying to play Lind more for the scouts. Rogers will come back up in a few weeks (if/when Lind gets traded).

Brewers,3bve9q,necropaw,6,Thu Jul 2 13:53:39 2015 UTC,Miller Park should be spotless given the sweeps.
Brewers,3bve9q,machiavellism,3,Thu Jul 2 15:59:34 2015 UTC,Maybe he is going to play third base.
Brewers,3bve9q,jn2010,2,Thu Jul 2 14:09:31 2015 UTC,He's probably faster than Rami at this point.
Brewers,3bve9q,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know... I'd at least let him take tickets at the door. Or serve beer. YEAAAAH, Serve beer."

Brewers,3bve9q,brad153,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:37 2015 UTC,So he would still make a lot of vital decisions at this year's deadline.
Brewers,3bve9q,The_Bostache,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"There is the potential for that, but if Attanasio allowed something like that it would completely undercut the new GM whoever it might be.

Brewers,3bve9q,sjm1541,0,Fri Jul 3 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"He must have pictures of Attanasio's wife or something.  He needs to be gone completely, along with Schlesinger and Nichols and Ash, the whole lot of them.  Keep Counsell around and let Montgomery build his own staff.  Its going to be at least 5 years before this team is successful again and this ""move"" has been a long time coming."
Brewers,3bve9q,Valleyoan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:39:44 2015 UTC,I have to agree. I just feel as long as he is in the organization than were going to be doing the same thing we did before.
Brewers,3bve9q,madman86,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:17 2015 UTC,The Brewers have already set themselves on rebuilding so I'm not sure that's a concern. Melvin is fully behind it and it's Attanasio that needs the push in the right direction to get things moving. Melvin knows the business and the game and it makes sense to keep him on as long as the Brewers are fully committed to a rebuild which has to come from Attanasio.
Brewers,3bve9q,theamazingkiwi,0,Thu Jul 2 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Melvin deserves a large portion of the blame for the way things are, but let's not fool ourselves, Attanasio is the puppet master. He meets with players agents for fucks sake. He must think his last name is Cuban or something."
Brewers,3bve9q,crosszilla,2,Thu Jul 2 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"it is his money, but he is a business man, not a baseball man.  And there is a big difference between being a fan and the GM.  He needs to learn to get out of the way and let his baseball people do their job."
Brewers,3bve9q,crosszilla,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"I think it maybe a little late to hire a new GM before the (fast approaching) deadline. I know that is what a lot of people want, but I don't see it. It wouldn't be fair to the new GM."
Brewers,3bve9q,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Cubs sort of did it when they brought in Theo Epstein.  They allowed Jim Hendry to still be a part of the draft and run the team until Theo was available.  If they go with Montgomery, he will have full knowledge of whats going on and can step right into the job without the organization missing a beat."
Brewers,3bve9q,SoSublim3,0,Thu Jul 2 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"About 3 years too late if you ask me, but it looks like Mark Attanasio is getting ready to make some changes in the front office.

Brewers,3bve9q,b-VW,0,Thu Jul 2 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"Why all the hate? We knew what we were getting into when he made the trades that depleted our farm system and ended a 25 year playoff drought and had people thinking world series for a year. As a small market, that's hard to come by when your window is so short knowing your star players are ready to bolt for contracts your team can't afford. I thought being 2 games away from the World Series was worth a couple bad years, I got to experience an elimination game in Milwaukee (game 5 against Arizona)."
Brewers,3bve9q,cheezturds,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I have never liked him because I did not feel he has the mindset needed to run a small market baseball club.  And those moves you mention are and were incredibly short sighted that really did not work.  In '08 they backed into the playoffs because the Mets choked, and in 2011 they sold the farm to go ""all in"" and they did not get a pennant out of it.  Excuse me if that sounds like a negative attitude, but it was a failure, I dont want playoff appearances, I want titles.  As much as Brewer fans hate the Cardinals and ""The Cardinal Way"", they are the best performing and best run team in the National League right now and Jeff Luhnow is taking that philosophy to the Astros and turning them into a winner too.  I would much rather have that sort of organization to watch all year and go to the games than what we have now."
Brewers,3bve9q,b-VW,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:34 2015 UTC,"How much do you think that was Melvin versus direction from ownership? And in 08 we had a few injuries that gutted our rotation IIRC. We lost to the world series champ both times. We were right there.  Look no further than the Bucks, who were always in this ridiculously short sighted win now mentality until Kohl was already on his way out the door."
Brewers,3bve9q,Valleyoan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:13 2015 UTC,He's considering whether or not he wants to take his severance pay or whether he wants to gracefully bow out of the GM chair and still be allowed in the building.
Brewers,3bwqfi,RustyDarkstar76,5,Thu Jul 2 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"100% if someone is willing to take him at the deadline. The problem is he's injury prone, making 14 million this year and has a .684 OPS.   I'd imagine you can easily wait and see what happens and the deadline and base it on that. The Brewers won't truly be selling out any games this year and the last series will still have tickets available even if you have to go through Stubhub."
Brewers,3bwqfi,sjm1541,2,Thu Jul 2 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"The team is definitely trying to move him. Either way, you'll be able to buy tickets to that last series after the trade deadline is over. We're not selling out that often."
Brewers,3bwqfi,smiles134,2,Thu Jul 2 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"I would say 95%. Hopefully to somewhere he actually has a shot too. We have some infield talent that could be good a third, so I see no reason not to do it and allow that talent to get some playing time over there."

Maybe when i bought them there was an option and i missed it/dont remember checking it?  Can you print a parking pass?  I dont see it showing up with the tickets or anything.  I guess thats my main concern, since i know i can print the tickets (theres an option for that on the 'My Brewers Tickets' page)."
Brewers,3btst8,thatguyinthecorner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:06 2015 UTC,You cannot print a parking pass.  I bought one for electronic delivery on opening day and then StubHub told me you can't actually print a parking pass and they cancelled the parking pass order.
Brewers,3brbgf,gimmesomespace,8,Wed Jul 1 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"The offense has actually been clicking reasonably well overall, lately.  Gogo's in a bit of a slump, and Luc has been up and down, but overall the top of the order, and even into the middle has been solid.  Edit: Totally forgot Perez.  What a fucking find hes been!"
Brewers,3brbgf,necropaw,4,Wed Jul 1 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"Perez. What a strange thing. He was junk when Detroit tossed him off. He started out the same way. I've been impressed lately.  Also, Parra. I reeeeeeeeaaallly hate the idea of losing him."

Brewers,3bsi6i,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:21:15 2015 UTC,Just the turn over.  Chip traded or let go the best players on their offense.  Maybe he's a genius who knows exactly what he needs and it'll work out.  But the smart money is on the opposite outcome.
Brewers,3bsi6i,jn2010,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"I actually like what they did. They turned McCoy+his Salary into Murray and majority of Kiko's Contract, both of which fit their system better. Albeit this season may depend on the health of Bradford, but the Eagles are good at staying on the field with Kelly at the helm."
Brewers,3bsi6i,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"From a personnel standpoint, sure.  I can understand it.  (though they don't have anyone to throw it to).  But good personnel does not a good team make.  It takes time for players to gel with each other and that's more important than the stats.  Like I said, maybe Kelly is a genius and has a way to get players on the same page.  He has the advantage of having a very good Oline.  But I'll believe it when I see it."
Brewers,3bsi6i,jn2010,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Eagles are either going to be really good, or really, really depressingly bad.  Not quite Oakland bad, but still."

Brewers,3br6lz,necropaw,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Question, how is his draft history compared to Melvin's? I'm too lazy to look it up...   Cause I'm negating the free agent signing because the market size and amount of money they can throw around is different."
Brewers,3br6lz,The_Bostache,2,Wed Jul 1 17:43:10 2015 UTC,Melvin doesn't make the draft picks; that's the job of the scouting director who is now Ray Montgomery.
Brewers,3br6lz,JinxUW,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dont think DiPoto is the right guy for this job in Milwaukee.  They need an up and comer for the job, not a retread.  They already have someone in Ray Montgomery in house to fill Melvins spot.  Definitely time for Melvin to go, it has been for a few years now."
Brewers,3br6lz,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:47 2015 UTC,DiPoto was a top assistant to Theo Epstein in Boston and is a very respected front office guy. He was fired because of a meddling owner that took Mike Scioscia's side in a power struggle. He's hardly a retread.
Brewers,3br6lz,crewblue,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"The Brewers would be his third team in about 5 years though, that is the thing that worries me.  And Attanasio is sort of a meddling owner too, so that wouldn't bode well."

Brewers,3bodun,The_Gatemaster,16,Tue Jun 30 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"Plus, how often can you go to an opposing team's stadium and get a bobblehead of your team's manager?"
Brewers,3bodun,silentjay01,2,Tue Jun 30 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"Great, great point!!  Heck, I even loved the Lucroy t-shirt!  I love the idea of giving everyone one.  Not sure if they did it this year, but I had heard that there used to be alternative jerseys bobbleheads.  That's an even better one."
Brewers,3bodun,wegettacos,8,Wed Jul 1 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"A couple other points:  1) I loved going to get beer and taking a pee because I got to listen to the amazing Bob Uecker. 2) I'm glad that I got one game with the roof (partially) open the entire time.  Was disappointed the rain came a bit on Sunday. 3) Love the way the roof closes/opens. 4) I sat in the 2nd deck in left field this year (last year was up by Bernie) and thought they were great seats - despite being bleachers.  If I lived in the area, those tickets would be my choice (price v. sights) 5) Tailgating atmosphere is amazing...while I prefer Target Field's views inside the stadium and overall game field...Miller Park's pre-game atmosphere is awesome. 6) Summerfest!!!"
Brewers,3bodun,dannisbet,2,Wed Jul 1 00:12:50 2015 UTC,Bleacher seats are by far my favorite at Miller Park. Glad you enjoyed yourself. I've had nothing but good experiences with Twins fans who visit. I hope for the same when I eventually make it up to Target Field!

Brewers,3bodun,franklin_stubbs,3,Wed Jul 1 02:45:17 2015 UTC,I always enjoy when the Twins come to town. Your fans are some of the nicest we have through Miller Park!  Hoping I can make it up to Target Field for a series for the next go-around.

Brewers,3bjr5d,jn2010,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be due to health reasons, but it doesn't seem that way, so it's pretty shocking.  Pretty sure he recently signed a contract extension too.  I expected a few more years, but good for him.  Can't imagine it gets any easier as you age with the amount of stress involved."
Brewers,3bjr5d,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:03:36 2015 UTC,I have a feeling it has something to do with how the Badgers got screwed in the title game and the new rules decreasing the shot clock time. You don't go from signing a 5-year extension to retiring next year just like that.
Brewers,3bjr5d,CJL13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:02:02 2015 UTC,I didn't feel like we got screwed in the title game.  We just couldn't hit shots.  The shot clock reduction is really hard on his offensive style though.  I can see that.

Brewers,3bhq13,McCaber,7,Mon Jun 29 09:56:34 2015 UTC,"Not really. I'm alright with being 2nd worst.  I will however, be strangely upset if we have a player on the roster making over 5mil by the trade deadline. I'd love to see them all go."
Brewers,3bhq13,BrewCrewKevin,3,Mon Jun 29 15:01:47 2015 UTC,I think we'd have to give a team money to take Lohse off our hands though.
Brewers,3bhq13,Tuggernuts23,4,Mon Jun 29 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"No.  I'd always rather win a baseball game.  The MLB draft is such a fickle thing.  I'd be interested in seeing how likely a #1 overall draft pick is to work out versus a #2, #3, #4, etc."
Brewers,3bhq13,smiles134,2,Mon Jun 29 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"The draft next year is supposed to be stacked with talent, so I don't know if it'll be much different for us to have the 1st pick or the 2nd."
Brewers,3bhq13,Nadie_AZ,2,Mon Jun 29 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"You know what would suck? We get rid of all our big name players over the next month or so. Then in early August, when we are primed for a run at a good draft, our team decides to redo last year and go on a tear and win a ton of games to close out the season. It'd have the effect of screwing over our draft level and leave management thinking 'let's just leave the roster alone and see how we do in 2016'.   And then we'll repeat 2015 all over again.   This is my fear."
Brewers,3bhq13,allonbacuth,2,Mon Jun 29 20:19:08 2015 UTC,We could win every series for the rest of the year and still not even be close to making the playoffs.
Brewers,3bhq13,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"If we only win enough games to win every series for the rest of the year, we would finish at 88-74 which is the same record the pirates/giants made it with last year. Not saying that record would get us there (or that it is anywhere near possible to win that many games) but you can't say we would not be close."
Brewers,3bhq13,necropaw,2,Wed Jul 1 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in tanking.  What the Cubs and Astros did was disrespectful to their fans and the game and although things are looking up for both of them now, nothing is guaranteed.  We've shown since Attanasio took over that we won't tank when things are bad and I think that is why players like Lohse, Garza, Ramirez wanted to come play here (even though right now we'd prefer they weren't)."
Brewers,3bhq13,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"I think that is why players like Lohse, Garza, Ramirez wanted to come play here (even though right now we'd prefer they weren't).   Eh, i think a lot of it is the big contracts those guys got, tbh."

Brewers,3bgmtb,theamazingkiwi,3,Mon Jun 29 04:16:31 2015 UTC,I thought you were going to say that we have two relievers tired for the team lead in wins.
Brewers,3bgmtb,johnnynumber5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"Surprised to say the least. I was very against this waiver claim, but his K% has gone down and he's seeing the ball a lot better. I still think he swings too much for his Con%, but he's doing better than the Tigers thought he was worth, so there's that. I wish he had options still though, I'd rather him be in AAA but I guess it really doesn't matter at this point."
Brewers,3bgmtb,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think the main thing is that he's getting playing time to develop. It's good that we've been able to get him AB's, I think that has a lot to do with it. He wasn't getting any real time in Detroit, and that can hinder performance and mentality a lot."

Brewers,3bfarg,silentjay01,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"Essentially, he has good knowledge of the strike zone and makes nice contact as well, the lower that value, the better the plate disciple. Roughly speaking."

Brewers,3beb5x,orange_lazarus1,3,Sun Jun 28 12:34:35 2015 UTC,"To me, the real litmus test is Gomez. Even if they trade Lohse/Garza/Parra/K-Rod/Ramirez, if they don't trade Gomez (or Segura or Lucroy, but they're much less likely), they're not willing to do a real rebuild."
Brewers,3beb5x,wintva,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. The only issue I see is that I don't see a big market for Gomez. Most of the top teams have a decent to good CF. Rangers, Tigers, and Giants are the only teams I really see as having a need at CF. I wouldn't be surprised if they trade him in the offseason."

Brewers,3beb5x,BarcaBadger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:08:55 2015 UTC,Good call. I overlooked that he's not hitting very well. I'm hopeful one of those 4 teams will give up a lot to get him.
Brewers,3beb5x,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"For some of the more impactful player lets see what I can put together. Smith: I know that he is cost controlled, but that is why the Crew will get an offer they can't refuse for him. Lucroy: It would take a ton of time to work a trade for him, and I think it's best to wait for the offseason for that, but you never know. Fiers: His age should dictate the fact that he needs to be traded. Also, since he is a league average starter being paid league minimum this year, someone would want to pay. Long story short, it's an extreme sellers market and next years draft is loaded, blow it up and tank."
Brewers,3beb5x,silentjay01,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:36:14 2015 UTC,I still think some team is going to offer up a deal Melvin can't refuse for Lucroy before the deadline.  Some other GM is going to pull the trigger because he knows that only in a year when the Brewers are this far out of contention will a player of Lucroy's caliber be available.  There is blood in the water.  The sharks are coming.
Brewers,3beb5x,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:24:12 2015 UTC,I could see that he is really the only guy on their current roster who I think they could get a team over paying for but I do agree with the logic of the article of why you wouldn't want to trade him.
Brewers,3beb5x,crewblue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:53:57 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Tom here, the whole point of trades and loading the farm via every means is to stockpile young, quality talent that can then be moved for necessity later. Just look what the Cubs did when they traded for Montero."

Brewers,3beof2,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:43:56 2015 UTC,That was a good offensive inning despite not scoring.  Sets us up really well heading into the third.

Brewers,3beof2,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, he's really good with the fans and media.  Plus when you consider K-Rod has multiple assaults and Gallardo got a DUI when he was with us, he's not the Brewer people should hate."
Brewers,3beof2,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"I have forgiven him. No reason to hold a grudge. He may have acted like an asshole, but he is our asshole."

I understand heckling, and ""feels"", this has nothing at all to do with that. This is about walking through section 210 (or there abouts) and just yelling so you get on the air. That kind of act is disrespectful to the broadcasters, and the fans. You'll never hear that trash on Uecker's broadcast as he is a ninja with the mute button. He's literally 20 feet from the Fox sports WI booth, and this moron would have been heard on both.   This is about an idiot trying to intentionally disrupt a paid broadcast. That is my reason for annoyance. As a fan paying for the broadcast this is disrupting. It is irritating, and made me angry. I'm actually paying money to watch this game, and I have to listen to a drunk retard like that?   Yes a good answer would be closed booths. That does not bring justice to the broadcast of the game.   My point is someone who is only yelling something that has NO reflection on the game is there to intentionally be heard, and saying something inflammatory. It is the exact same as someone running out on the field. That person is there for their OWN attention. Those people are arrested, and sometimes even banished from the ballpark.  People yelling garbage to be heard on radio or TV for a live broadcast should be treated the same."
Brewers,3ba9jw,adam7765,2,Fri Jul 3 00:43:59 2015 UTC,Went to a game at County Stadium against the Braves in 1997. Sat in the bleachers real close to David Justice. He and Halle Berry had recently broken up so we taunted him with chants about it all night. Not a proud moment...

Brewers,3b2wl4,allonbacuth,2,Thu Jun 25 17:37:58 2015 UTC,I work as a sysadmin and the only sites we have blocked are remote meeting sites and you just need to ask to get to them. I would hate to be in a place that blocked sites because that just annoys people and then they've already got a grudge against you when something needs to be fixed.

Brewers,3b2ovo,zinger565,2,Thu Jun 25 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"You can't get into the stadium to see the Brewers do batting practice. They finish before the gates open. Also the Brewers do not, unless under rare circumstances, do batting practice for day games. So unfortunately the only way you could see the Brewers do BP is to catch them at an away stadium or work for the Brewers/Miller Park."
Brewers,3b2ovo,Tearnov,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, understood. We've always been 3+ hrs away, and this is the first game we're actually staying overnight before hand. Usually we just drive the day of, so we've never been able to get to the stadium early at all."
Brewers,3b2ovo,Tearnov,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:02:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I worked at Miller Park during college and I still work for them; do about one weekend a month. Your best bet is to either go to a Saturday game because they do autographs every Sat but that is a crap shoot who is signing. You could show up early and make it in at the gate opening. Usually the off day pitchers are throwing the ball around and do autographs near first base field level (don't need tickets to stand there before the game). However as far as Scooter? There really isn't a good way aside from luck during the game. You could try to get good seats for a couple hundred and get his attention but I don't find him as personable as Nyjer Morgan was.

Brewers,3b0n3m,biblioero,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:19:17 2015 UTC,I think we would have still made the playoffs that year. Didn't we win the division by quite a few games? Would have at least been a WC.
Brewers,3b0n3m,dusters,10,Thu Jun 25 17:46:29 2015 UTC,I would never give up the 2011 season.  We'd likely still be a sub-.500 team right now with this lineup.
Brewers,3b0n3m,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"Well the 3 players we traded away have a combined WAR of 6.3, and our players at those positions have a WAR of .7. You obviously can't just substitute wins like that, and we would still be a pretty bad team this year. However, our future would look a lot brighter as the guys we gave up all turned out to be pretty good players."
Brewers,3b0n3m,dusters,4,Thu Jun 25 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"it was a good trade for both teams. the brewers got what they wanted out of it - a trip deep into the playoffs, and the royals got what they wanted out of it - prospects to rebuild. win-win, just at different times."
Brewers,3b0n3m,ehrenj,3,Thu Jun 25 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"It was a trade that KC knew they'd win long term, where as we had won it short term. I think I'd do it again."
Brewers,3b0n3m,motivate18,3,Thu Jun 25 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't trade that playoff run for the world. The abysmal 90's and early 00's  really took a lot out of me.

Brewers,3b0n3m,theamazingkiwi,0,Fri Jun 26 11:39:19 2015 UTC,"I never wanted it done when it was done.  It was a trade that made a weak farm system completely obliterated.  And the whole argument about the team not making the playoffs if they hadn't picked him up if false.  They won the division by 6 games.  Greinke had a 1.5 WAR that year according to b-ref.  He won 16 games but it was because of the offense, not his pitching.  Lets not forget they also had to pay him $13.5 million that year on top of giving away Cain, Escobar, and Odirizzi.  It was just as bad of a trade back then as it is now."

Brewers,3az4ue,stingem3929,18,Wed Jun 24 17:45:48 2015 UTC,Between this and John Axford I'm wondering if the Brewers pitching coaches are the real problem.
Brewers,3az4ue,CJL13,11,Wed Jun 24 18:18:07 2015 UTC,I've been saying for years that I really wish they would get rid of Kranitz.
Brewers,3az4ue,xsists,9,Wed Jun 24 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"When Ax went to the Cardinals, I seem to recall them telling him that he was tipping his pitches. Cant find the link right now. I wonder if it's the same with Estrada.  But yeah, they're not great coaches"
Brewers,3az4ue,nior_labotomy,6,Wed Jun 24 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"With the assist!  Should have picked up on it sooner, too. Smoltz picked it up on a TV broadcast in 2010."
Brewers,3az4ue,BrewCrewKevin,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"Not that I believe Kranitz is a great coach by any means, but I don't buy the coaches being the problem. Correlation does not equal causation. Especially with Axford's pitch tipping...now if he indeed was doing that, why the hell was he so successful against the Cardinals? 2.93 career ERA vs. STL and 1.17 ERA in 2013, the year he was traded to them. Surely you'd think that if he was tipping his pitches they could have hit him better than that."
Brewers,3az4ue,ANumenorean,3,Thu Jun 25 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit strange that Gallardo, Axford, AND Estrada all get significantly better once they leave, especially when two go over to the AL. Sure correlation doesn't equal causation, but in this case it certainly suggests a causation."
Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,3,Thu Jun 25 17:42:59 2015 UTC,That's not really true at all though. Estrada has an ERA of 3.91 in the ten games he started this year. As a starter in 2012 his ERA was 3.76 and in 2013 it was 3.87. His SO/W was better both seasons as well. Obviously he was bad last year but that was more on his crazy HR rate than any coaching since he proved he could do it in Milwaukee before.  Gallardo has a better ERA but there's nothing to say thats sustainable. He's only thrown 87 innings with HR rate and BABIP well under his career averages.   Axford was great in Milwaukee for two years and fell off very quickly. 10 innings with the Cardinals and 21 inning with the Rockies don't change that he's struggled over long periods of time everywhere he's gone. He wasn't very good in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and he's coming back to reality in Colorado.
Brewers,3az4ue,sjm1541,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"It's a little disingenuous to compare Gallardo right now to his career averages. He doesn't have the same stuff he had 5 years ago, but he is still putting up good numbers. Sure, his XFIP is right around his average the last couple of years, but his FIP is significantly better. He is allowing a lot less HRs in an even friendlier hitters park while facing better batters. It could just be fluky, but it could also be that he is just doing something different.  And you can;t just throw out some of Estrada's innings like that. He's gone from reliever to starter multiple times in his career already, so if you are going to compare to his career numbers you should use all the data available."
Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,2,Thu Jun 25 18:07:57 2015 UTC,If you want to go by all of Estrada's numbers than it actually looks worse for the Blue Jays. His FIP/xFIP are worse than 3 out of 4 seasons in Milwaukee where he pitched more innings than he has thrown this year.
Brewers,3az4ue,sjm1541,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"""use all the data available""  Apply this to your logic. The only improvement in both Gallardo and Estrada's performance is due to their decrease in HR/9, nearly every other peripheral has declined for them. Not to mention they are both sporting career low BABIPs right now. If you are comparing their FIP and xFIP, combined with the lower BABIP it's more reasonable to assume that luck and perhaps a better defense behind them is a bigger reason for their ERA being lower over an arbitrary sample size. Again, not saying Kranitz isn't part of the problem, but you're using confirmation bias here."
Brewers,3az4ue,ANumenorean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Axford has been worth a total of 0.1 WAR since departing Milwaukee. We've seen Gallardo and Estrada perform even better than this over stretches before. Nothing in their pitch mix, velocity, release points or peripherals is significantly different enough to make the assumption that coaching was the issue. If you looked back just two starts ago for either of these pitchers, you'd have seen Estrada's ERA at 4.24 and Gallardo's at 3.45 would you have been so quick to blame Kranitz then?"
Brewers,3az4ue,ANumenorean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:49 2015 UTC,I'd just look at all of our starters ERA's and blame Kranitz.
Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:03:29 2015 UTC,Do you give him credit for last year when the pitching was outstanding?
Brewers,3az4ue,ANumenorean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"The pitching wasn't outstanding last year. Our best pitcher had a WAR of 2.6. It was pretty good, but a lot of guys had some unsustainable peripherals that have obviously come back down to earth. More often than not with Kranitz our pitching has been pretty bad."
Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"OK maybe not outstanding. But team ERA was 3.67. And normally, I hate the ""quality start"" statistic as it pertains to an individual pitcher, but the team was 3rd in MLB last season with 103 QS. The vast majority of the time they were in a position to win ballgames, it was the offense that let down Milwaukee last season. Look at their 9-17 September, staff ERA for the month was 3.14 with a 1.18 WHIP."
Brewers,3az4ue,ANumenorean,2,Thu Jun 25 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"While i cant dispute those numbers, see above"
Brewers,3az4ue,nior_labotomy,5,Thu Jun 25 00:46:01 2015 UTC,lets not forget Gallardo. His ERA is under 3 this year pitching in the AL. The pitching coaches are definitely part of the problem.
Brewers,3az4ue,jackmeriusIII,2,Wed Jun 24 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"You're probably not wrong. Axford had the problem with tipping pitches, so who knows how much of the coaching problem has seriously affected not only the bullpen, but rotation in general."
Brewers,3az4ue,machiavellism,3,Wed Jun 24 21:45:51 2015 UTC,Our pitching coaches aren't that good. How can you not win given our talent the last few years? We had some damn good pitchers. We still have some good young pitchers as well. I hope for their sake that Counsel takes a serious look at all coaching positions in the off season.
Brewers,3az4ue,madman86,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Gallardo has been having a great year too. 2.98 ERA, 3.53 FIP. I think Kranitz needs to go."
Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:41:47 2015 UTC,Look at his xFIP though. Second lowest HR rate in his career is leading to ERA/FIP that are most likely too good to be true. Could potentially be park factors but that doesn't really reflect poorly on the Brewers.
Brewers,3az4ue,sjm1541,4,Thu Jun 25 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"I just saw this.    What the actual fuck.  Of all the Brewers pitchers, marco is the guy taking a perfect game into the 8th.  I like Marco, but this is surprising."
Brewers,3az4ue,necropaw,8,Wed Jun 24 18:01:11 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Dave Bush.
Brewers,3az4ue,xsists,4,Wed Jun 24 18:44:44 2015 UTC,Dave Effin' Bush.   You missed a word in his name.
Brewers,3az4ue,IrkenInvaderGir,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:46:23 2015 UTC,It's not surprising. He always had great stuff but was prone to blowups about the third time through the order.

Brewers,3az4ue,dusters,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:02:26 2015 UTC,I think you aren't giving Estrada enough credit. He was pretty damn good in '12 and '13.
Brewers,3az4ue,MustBeNice,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"2011 he was great when filling in for Greinke.  This entire sub drives me crazy, they don't seem to know much about baseball"
Brewers,3az4ue,SolidRambo,3,Fri Jun 26 11:42:02 2015 UTC,Again? Didn't he do this like 2 weeks ago but was at like 100 pitches at the end of the 6th?  Edit: Went 8.2 with just two hits today. Great performance either way!
Brewers,3az4ue,fly1ngorb,5,Wed Jun 24 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"He did it in his last start.  Took the no hitter into the 7th, I believe."
Brewers,3az4ue,CasualCore,4,Wed Jun 24 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Pitching like he has the last couple starts is the reason why I liked Estrada so much. Hides his eyes, whips the ball in the strike zone. Obviously the ERA and HRs allowed wasn't good in MIL but glad to see he's doing well in TOR. Estrada/Lind seems like a good offense/defense swap right now."
Brewers,3az4ue,JasonYaya,3,Wed Jun 24 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"I always liked Marco, guy did whatever was needed and did it well until he gave up all the dingers last year. He did a great job when Grienke hurt his ribs at the start of the season."
Brewers,3az4ue,DICKSUBJUICY,2,Wed Jun 24 20:33:36 2015 UTC,everyone has always shit all over him and I have never understood why.
Brewers,3az4ue,smiles134,5,Wed Jun 24 18:44:28 2015 UTC,Because last season he had a HR/9 of 1.72. He was giving up almost 2 HRs every 9 innings. Plus his HR/FB% was 13%! That's really not good if you have a FB% of nearly 50% like he did.
Brewers,3az4ue,sjm1541,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was definitely time for him to go but it's not too surprising to see him closer to his career numbers this year. He brought the Brewers Adam Lind who has the potential to bring in a decent haul at the deadline. Ended up working out for everyone."
Brewers,3az4ue,sniper84,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:04:03 2015 UTC,Again?? Pretty sure he's pitched at least one other game like this. Looks like this turned out to be a good move.

Brewers,3awr2w,necropaw,4,Wed Jun 24 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"I was laid off last summer, so i caught a lot of games.  A fair few were up at our camper, so i had to catch them on the radio.  I know i listened to Darryl a lot, and thats why his voice was so etched in my memory.  So much of my sadness over this whole ordeal is because of his kids, who i can somewhat relate to (my dad died when i was just shy of 5), but now im feeling more and more sorrowful because i know ill never hear him call a game again.  He quite simply seemed like an amazing human being.  Someone i'd love to have some beers and talk about baseball with.  In short, its not fucking fair."
Brewers,3awr2w,TheBause,2,Wed Jun 24 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"Not fucking fair, and really fucking sad.  That about sums it up."

Brewers,3avk0y,Pfloyd3333,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:46:32 2015 UTC,What you know is that Ramirez has been shit all year.  I want to see Rodgers in for him too.  I can only assume they're sticking with Ramirez because they want him to get hot so they can trade him.
Brewers,3avk0y,jn2010,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:52:41 2015 UTC,Or that Rogers just can't play third. They tried him their earlier this year and it went very very bad.
Brewers,3avk0y,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:59:18 2015 UTC,Maybe Ramirez just really wants to end his career in Milwaukee

Brewers,3aqmii,ANumenorean,2,Mon Jun 22 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"I have a friend (Cubs and Bears fan) who has a criteria for buying a named jersey: the player either has to play their entire career with the team or else they have to have been on a championship winning team.  In Baseball, I'd go with adding a player who retires with the team. Or else plays the vast majority of their career with the team.  This makes buying new jerseys practically impossible as you just don't know anymore. Last August I figured Lucroy was a lock to retire a Brewer. In 2011, I figured Braun. You just don't know anymore."
Brewers,3aqmii,WIGutie,2,Tue Jun 23 00:14:01 2015 UTC,Ugh I remember that Hoffman BS....fucking Nick Stavinoha was the catalyst of Trevor Hoffman's swan song. Just another reason to hate the Cardinals.

Brewers,3aqmii,cweb96,2,Tue Jun 23 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is you need to buy a Garza, Lohse, and Aram jersey/shirt?"
Brewers,3aqmii,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:09:34 2015 UTC,I bought a Braun Shirsey after he was suspended for Biogenesis in 2013. I figured that'd be the low point of his career.
Brewers,3aqmii,cweb96,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"My parents got me a Braun authentic jersey for Christmas in 2011 that they bought shortly before the test was leaked.  It was also leaked the night before my birthday.  That was a rough month.  I was happy to have the jersey for 2012, then Biogenesis came out and it was stuffed away for a while, but I'm pretty happy to have it."
Brewers,3aqmii,necropaw,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:47:05 2015 UTC,Rough stuff. I wear mine proud and I've been a huge fan of him ever since he came up. He actually was suspended on my birthday. July 22
Brewers,3aqmii,cweb96,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Ive got a knockoff from walmart, but still wear my Braun jersey.    It sucks that he did what he did, and i really do hope it was 'just' to come back from an injury, but hes still a really good hitter, imo...and i respect him for signing a long term deal in Milwaukee."
Brewers,3aqmii,necropaw,2,Tue Jun 23 04:16:03 2015 UTC,What I think is that he is/was a great hitter bc most guys don't hit above .300 so the steroids really only affected his power numbers and not so much his average/OBP.
Brewers,3aqmii,cweb96,2,Tue Jun 23 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"I think were seeing those great hitting skills come back now that his thumb is better, tbh.  Once they get the injections for the freezing of that nerve figured out, i hope he comes back.  One other thing to note: I swear league batting is down now from where it was a few years ago.  It just feels like were in a bit of a 'lul' right now, which may be due to better pitching."
Brewers,3aqmii,WIGutie,3,Tue Jun 23 04:56:12 2015 UTC,I really do think it's cuz of the better pitching.
Brewers,3aqmii,SolidRambo,2,Tue Jun 23 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"Also that pitchers this year are visibly pitching around him to get to Ramirez. That 3-0 count he left the bases loaded vs KC would've been an RBI walk if he'd realized Royals didn't want to pitch to him. He's doing better for power numbers than the last two years, he just needs to stop swinging at everything with RISP and take a damn BB."
Brewers,3aqmii,necropaw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:27:00 2015 UTC,Got a Counsell jersey in 2008 which has worked out pretty well. Got a Braun shirsey in 2013 which I really don't wear all that often. I have a really old Sheets shirsey from High School in my parents house in my old bedroom somewhere too..  Honestly the next one I'm gonna get will probably be a Uecker jersey/shirsey; it's a safe bet.
Brewers,3aq4hk,brewisbrewin,4,Mon Jun 22 16:26:55 2015 UTC,You could take 'changeup' out of that title and it'd still be a good question.
Brewers,3aq4hk,necropaw,2,Mon Jun 22 16:31:37 2015 UTC,It almost isn't even a changeup anymore.  It's just a slow ass pitch that doesn't do anything but wind up in the bleachers.
Brewers,3ao0np,JSA17,5,Mon Jun 22 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"Lohse is a known troll. I can almost guarantee he was fucking with you.

Brewers,3ao0np,frakking-anustart,0,Mon Jun 22 03:27:01 2015 UTC,I really don't see what he was upset about. It was sort of weird. He seemed legitimately pissed about me shooting a picture.  And yes you did. The whole thing was just using up way too much of my free time. But hopefully it didn't get tanked (not that it was any good to begin with).

Brewers,3alsqi,milkhotelbitches,14,Sun Jun 21 14:47:10 2015 UTC,Last year at this time we were the 2nd best team in all of baseball. We also got to see a two run strike out and a three run wild pitch.  I'm going to go stare out the window for awhile.
Brewers,3alsqi,SolidRambo,13,Sun Jun 21 15:20:19 2015 UTC,RIP Brewers hype train.  April 2014 - September 2014  Never forget

Brewers,3alsqi,TheGobler,5,Mon Jun 22 18:08:23 2015 UTC,God dammit the first half of last season was so fun.
Brewers,3alsqi,smiles134,4,Sun Jun 21 15:34:42 2015 UTC,Segura was much better running the bases this day than he was in 2013 when he got caught stealing second after he stole first after stealing second.
Brewers,3alsqi,adam7765,3,Sun Jun 21 16:37:42 2015 UTC,That was a much happier time. I wonder when the Brewers will be the high caliber team of the the first half of 2014 again.

Brewers,3alsqi,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"I know everybody says ""heads up base running"" by Segura here... but I'd still be a little peeved as a manager. I thought that was reckless. Sure, he caught them napping... but the catcher was standing right on home plate. And if he tosses the ball in to the catcher and gets tagged out, then we're looking at the stupidest base-running we've ever seen."
Brewers,3alsqi,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:12:31 2015 UTC,Except for the time in 2013 when Jean got caught stealing a bag he'd already stolen.  Way dummer than getting caught the way you suggest.  There wasn't even a way to score his 2013 fuck up.

Brewers,3anigh,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously, that line isn't indicative of how he pitched at all.  Bad defense, broken bat hits galore, and a couple of runs given up by Cotts with runners he inherited."

Brewers,3amc9h,jn2010,2,Sun Jun 21 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"2018 is a club option year, iirc, at the very least. Honestly I don't see him going anywhere this year, but if he pitches well in 2016 I could see him being traded mid-season. It would be like a bootleg version of the David Price trade."
Brewers,3amc9h,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:33:10 2015 UTC,I have never seen a player called for interference running to first before this series and now it's called twice in 3 games.
Brewers,3amc9h,jn2010,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:17:28 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain that one?  Watching a Rockies stream (unfortunately) and those two clowns just kept saying good call without any explanation.
Brewers,3amc9h,DrinkWisconsinably,2,Sun Jun 21 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"The runner has to run in foul territory to first, apparently.  It was news to me when interference got called against the Rockies on Friday."
Brewers,3amc9h,jn2010,2,Sun Jun 21 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"There's a running lane you have to be in on the first base line. Siggy was out of it, so when he was hit it was an out."
Brewers,3amc9h,TheBause,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"That looked like a pretty normal run to first minus a terrible throw, but I'll wait to see a replay on that and keep this in mind. Thanks!"
Brewers,3amc9h,DrinkWisconsinably,2,Sun Jun 21 20:20:09 2015 UTC,It's a wierd rule that rarely gets called.  Its already been called twice this series.
Brewers,3amc9h,TheBause,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Rockies got screwed on that on Friday. We can't bitch about it."

Brewers,3amc9h,theamazingkiwi,6,Sun Jun 21 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I know I'm an asshole but I can't help it.  The Brewers posted a bunch of pictures today on their Facebook of players with their kids for father's day, and I swear to god, Broxton's kid looks like the spawn of the Michelin Man."
Brewers,3amc9h,smiles134,2,Sun Jun 21 17:16:32 2015 UTC,I laughed a little too hard at this.

Brewers,3aipm4,jn2010,12,Sat Jun 20 17:36:00 2015 UTC,They should take him before he implodes.

Brewers,3aipm4,DamienSalvation,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:40:15 2015 UTC,Haha don't worry there's no saves for him to blow!
Brewers,3aipm4,johncurtislynch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"He'd fit well in Toronto then. This year, their bullpen seems to blow close games before the 9th."

Brewers,3aipm4,itzjamesftw,4,Sun Jun 21 04:26:01 2015 UTC,They also need a starter.  Sounds like a perfect opportunity to package Garza's contract with K-Rod for insert prospect here.  Clearing Garza from the books is more important than locking down multiple prospects from this move.  Nay would be nice.  Edit: Partially redacted.
Brewers,3aipm4,cweb96,3,Sat Jun 20 20:51:36 2015 UTC,Gatto was drafted by LAA but everything else sounds good to me.
Brewers,3aipm4,itzjamesftw,2,Sat Jun 20 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"Ah good call, reading too many speculation posts and looking at way too many minor league systems today."
Brewers,3aipm4,cweb96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:08:56 2015 UTC,All good.
Brewers,3aipm4,johncurtislynch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:45:50 2015 UTC,I would love to see more Garza faces in the AL East.
Brewers,3aipm4,jmeks23,3,Sun Jun 21 04:00:15 2015 UTC,I just don't know what we could possibly get for K-Rod at this point.  He's seemingly only good on the Brewers and that contract next season...awful.
Brewers,3aipm4,madman86,2,Sat Jun 20 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Shhh, you'll scare them away!"
Brewers,3aipm4,Grizza,2,Sat Jun 20 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"He really fits well with the Brewers. I'd hope he would be effective for the Jays, but it's a big risk for them to take. At the least, I've always heard he is a very supportive teammate."
Brewers,3aipm4,cweb96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:50:21 2015 UTC,Mitch Nay and Dwight Smith look to be potential fits.
Brewers,3aipm4,cweb96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:35:11 2015 UTC,I'd say get a pitcher instead of Smith.
Brewers,3aipm4,zazu2006,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:07:26 2015 UTC,Reid Foley and Smoral then come to mind
Brewers,3aipm4,Ofreo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:56:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. I like Tirado as well but I'd like to see them get a guy a little closer to being ML ready so they'd have no problem trading Lohse/Garza. I really like Miguel Castro but he might be a bit of a stretch.

BA and Rock said that the runner has to have both feet in the 'running lane' in foul territory.

Brewers,3ahcqp,L3p3rJ0s1ah,18,Sat Jun 20 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"Don't force him to pay attention.  If he gets bored or antsy, take him to the games/play areas.  Easiest way to get him to hate baseball is to not let him enjoy himself at the park.  Also, get the stadium sauce on his hot dog.  This should quickly lead to an addiction if your son actually has a soul, thus continually forcing his return to the park."
Brewers,3ahcqp,Necatorducis,5,Sat Jun 20 04:54:22 2015 UTC,"Take him to Guest Services to get his First Timer certificate! And if you hang out by the dugout during batting practice, surely someone will toss him a ball.   I live in Kansas City, so we went to the games here this week, and Jeffress rolled a ball to my 1 1/2 year old daughter. She's too young to understand, but she was still thrilled."
Brewers,3ahcqp,flybymight,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:17:33 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping to get him a ball at the least. He is hoping for some autographs!
Brewers,3ahcqp,ksprzk,2,Sat Jun 20 05:21:26 2015 UTC,Head over by luc when he warms up the pitcher. He almost always signs after he's done. He took a photo with me as well.

Brewers,3ahcqp,Il_Tenente,3,Sat Jun 20 14:36:15 2015 UTC,"Bring a baseball with you to the stadium. When a ball is hit near you (doesn't have to be that close), reach up and pretend to grab it from the air and then give it to him. Chances are he won't know that it wasn't the actual one and it will make his day."

My dad recently passed away and though we didn't go to too many games together I would love to have something like that. You'd have to keep score for a couple years until he gauges interest im sure.

Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:52:46 2015 UTC,i guess.  But the fact that he had a chance to field it and bobbled it into the basepath and then got run over makes me think that he should have been safe.  But I dont know the rules so I assume it was the right call
Brewers,3ag5gw,followthelawson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's an alley that you have to run in on the first base line. He was out of the alley, but you don't really see it called often. Weird call by the HP ump."

Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,3,Sat Jun 20 03:21:14 2015 UTC,Went to T-Rats game at Miller Park.  Kodi Medeiros looked great.  Had a no-hitter through 5.2 IP and got the win.  Slider looked nasty and he touched 94 with his fastball.  Control is a bit of a question but he looks pretty polished for a 19-year-old.
Brewers,3ag5gw,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:09:49 2015 UTC,He's had a couple outings when he hasn't allowed his first hit for a few innings so...I'm excited too! He just needs to be more consistent with control.

Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"Great execution, but walking the next batter after makes it a questionable move.  The pitch out gave the batter a 2-0 count."

Brewers,3ag5gw,cweb96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:04:53 2015 UTC,The other side of Coors field is that pitcher's breaking balls don't break as much in thinner air.  Altitude is really bad for pitching.
Brewers,3ag5gw,jn2010,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:58:07 2015 UTC,I've always wondered who thought it was a good idea to throw a baseball team up there
Brewers,3ag5gw,smiles134,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Coors field is a beautiful ballpark and fans are quite loyal, so it's a nice market."
Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I was outside of the stadium last summer, it seemed nice. Just a less than optimal altitude there"
Brewers,3ag5gw,smiles134,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:02:59 2015 UTC,Well. Let's see if we can get off this skid with style!
Brewers,3ag5gw,the_bum_on_the_bus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:55:01 2015 UTC,Wait... WHAT?  I just tuned in.
Brewers,3ag5gw,jn2010,2,Sat Jun 20 00:53:39 2015 UTC,Coors field is one hell of a drug.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:53:56 2015 UTC,Were they legit home runs or Coors field HRs?
Brewers,3ag5gw,jn2010,2,Sat Jun 20 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Braun's was legit smoked.  Ramirez was down on the trademark and looked way under it, so that was Coors."
Brewers,3ag5gw,fly1ngorb,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:04 2015 UTC,Brauns was pretty legit. Ramis looked like a can of corn to right.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,2,Sat Jun 20 00:55:21 2015 UTC,Oh this will be fun!
Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,2,Sat Jun 20 00:52:17 2015 UTC,Holy fuck the Coors effect. That looked nowhere near gone.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,2,Sat Jun 20 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"Missed the Braun HR, but caught that one. Hell yeah"
Brewers,3ag5gw,smiles134,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:52:06 2015 UTC,Coors Coors Coors Coors Coors
Brewers,3ag5gw,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"Lol Coors, wow"
Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,2,Sat Jun 20 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"That shit was basically on the ground, Rami."
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:51:17 2015 UTC,Yippee!
Brewers,3ag5gw,2menshaving,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:47:55 2015 UTC,Was the game last Friday the last time we have had a lead?
Brewers,3ag5gw,KQ2eZPackers,2,Sat Jun 20 00:47:40 2015 UTC,They had a brief lead on Wednesday.
Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,3,Sat Jun 20 00:48:34 2015 UTC,"They had a 1-0 after the 1st inning on Wednesday, IIRC."

Brewers,3ag5gw,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"Damn, thought that should have been caught."
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:46:17 2015 UTC,"Literally waste our challenge on the first play, way to go."
Brewers,3ag5gw,CJL13,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:45:40 2015 UTC,Seems like a stupid review to me.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:45:25 2015 UTC,Don't think you can overturn that.
Brewers,3ag5gw,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:44:43 2015 UTC,Outtt.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:44:09 2015 UTC,God damn mountain time making the game later and shit.
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:44 2015 UTC,I'm predicting 51 combined runs scored in this three game series
Brewers,3ag5gw,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:20:35 2015 UTC,PLEASE JUST WIN ONE GAME THIS WEEK

Brewers,3ag5gw,BrewCrewKevin,2,Fri Jun 19 22:47:10 2015 UTC,How Ramirez is still in the lineup is beyond me.
Brewers,3ag5gw,jn2010,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:10:44 2015 UTC,What's going on with Dominguez?  Thought he was on the squad?
Brewers,3ag5gw,The_Bostache,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:23:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have preferred Elian."
Brewers,3ag5gw,TheBause,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:26:58 2015 UTC,Finally!  Lucroy in at Clean-up.
Brewers,3ag5gw,silentjay01,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:00:54 2015 UTC,I never would've thought we were this damn bad. 24-44? Yikes
Brewers,3ag5gw,jubjub2184,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"Do you think we will even get a sweep this year?  I mean, we DO play the Phillies in a little over a week."
Brewers,3ag5gw,silentjay01,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:02:56 2015 UTC,on pace for 57 wins... Damn. Yikes is right.
Brewers,3ag5gw,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:52:14 2015 UTC,Man that schedule on the right is depressing. Let's get one tonight Crew!
Brewers,3ad0dz,fly1ngorb,19,Fri Jun 19 02:50:18 2015 UTC,"Classic Yost causing the Brewers to lose with his terrible manager skills, hope the Brewers fire him soon. Wait they did?! Back in 2008?! And he just beat us four times in a row?!"
Brewers,3ad0dz,CJL13,5,Fri Jun 19 02:52:09 2015 UTC,Accurate.
Brewers,3ad0dz,DamienSalvation,5,Fri Jun 19 02:50:47 2015 UTC,Lol
Brewers,3ad0dz,TheBause,4,Fri Jun 19 02:51:29 2015 UTC,"I die a little on the inside after every game. By the way, does Ramirez know how to run?"
Brewers,3ad0dz,The_Bostache,4,Fri Jun 19 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"He knows how to run, just like we know how to play baseball."
Brewers,3ad0dz,Valleyoan,6,Fri Jun 19 05:15:42 2015 UTC,We officially have a 0.0% playoff probability
Brewers,3ad0dz,brewcrew2_2,2,Fri Jun 19 14:16:26 2015 UTC,Well that's one less thing to worry about
Brewers,3ad0dz,TurboShorts,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:44:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but so do the Phillies. Who's the real losers here?
Brewers,3ad0dz,ilovedasimps,3,Fri Jun 19 17:22:13 2015 UTC,Now to look forward to a sweep of the Rockies.
Brewers,3ad0dz,silentjay01,3,Fri Jun 19 03:00:34 2015 UTC,a sweep wouldnt even make me feel that much better
Brewers,3ad0dz,BrianTheLady,4,Fri Jun 19 04:27:03 2015 UTC,I need to quit drinking
Brewers,3ad0dz,Pfloyd3333,4,Fri Jun 19 02:55:05 2015 UTC,That 4th beer giving you trouble?

Brewers,3abwmr,smiles134,4,Fri Jun 19 02:46:20 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say BA made no friends with the Royals fanbase tonight.
Brewers,3abwmr,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:44:58 2015 UTC,Maybe he's trying to piss off the national audience so he stays with the Brewers?
Brewers,3abwmr,CJL13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:47:31 2015 UTC,Now that is the conspiracy!
Brewers,3abwmr,theamazingkiwi,3,Fri Jun 19 02:48:16 2015 UTC,We got this. Rogers will save us.
Brewers,3abwmr,Pfloyd3333,2,Fri Jun 19 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not often we are down in the 4th, but I like our chances on this drive....wait...."
Brewers,3abwmr,theamazingkiwi,2,Fri Jun 19 02:46:05 2015 UTC,Oh snap BA calling conspiracy.
Brewers,3abwmr,CJL13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:36:43 2015 UTC,"I missed it, what did he say?"
Brewers,3abwmr,smiles134,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:38:43 2015 UTC,He talked about how pumped the umpire was to call strike 3.
Brewers,3abwmr,CJL13,2,Fri Jun 19 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like Rogers should have pinch hit for Rami.  Also, high zone huh?"
Brewers,3abwmr,TheBause,2,Fri Jun 19 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I said, pinch hit in that situation"
Brewers,3abwmr,smiles134,2,Fri Jun 19 02:35:30 2015 UTC,Well... Ok.
Brewers,3abwmr,jn2010,3,Fri Jun 19 02:34:06 2015 UTC,This team performs with the bases loaded like a man in an orgy after he's been castrated.
Brewers,3abwmr,CJL13,0,Fri Jun 19 02:33:58 2015 UTC,This is a Christian sub reddit dude.
Brewers,3abwmr,Pfloyd3333,2,Fri Jun 19 02:37:37 2015 UTC,Judging by our record I'd say God has forsaken us.
Brewers,3abwmr,CJL13,2,Fri Jun 19 02:38:45 2015 UTC,Because of your comments
Brewers,3abwmr,Pfloyd3333,4,Fri Jun 19 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"Well, God can fuck off if he's that petty."

Brewers,3abwmr,necropaw,2,Fri Jun 19 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"UP and OFF the FUCKING PLATE.  Mother fucker, I'm pissed."
Brewers,3abwmr,jn2010,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:31:33 2015 UTC,I'm impressed you still care enough about this team to get pissed off. I'm incapable of getting upset anymore.
Brewers,3abwmr,Redtitwhore,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:33:12 2015 UTC,Pop outs in foul territory really suck...trust me
Brewers,3abwmr,theinsaneworld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:42:33 2015 UTC,I might have exaggerated a bit.  Fucking Rami legitimately pissed me off though.  Fucking idiot.
Brewers,3abwmr,jn2010,2,Fri Jun 19 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking Christ, Rami.  Put it in the god damn outfield.  Fucking piece of shit."

Brewers,3abwmr,jackmeriusIII,3,Fri Jun 19 02:39:10 2015 UTC,I'd feel much better if there were no outs.

Brewers,3abwmr,smiles134,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:26:56 2015 UTC,C'mon Rami!  Grand Slam will get you traded for sure!
Brewers,3abwmr,silentjay01,2,Fri Jun 19 02:26:49 2015 UTC,Shit.  There's no one here.  I guess that'll make my predictions meaningless.

Brewers,3abwmr,jn2010,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:22:39 2015 UTC,Do I need to start paying attention?  Shit's getting real tonight!
Brewers,3abwmr,jn2010,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:21:31 2015 UTC,I've got a prediction.  Lucroy hits a double and Braun is robbed of a home run by Lorenzo Cain.
Brewers,3abwmr,fly1ngorb,2,Fri Jun 19 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"Wtf.  You don't predict bad things.  Poor taste, man."

Brewers,3a8s68,CJL13,5,Thu Jun 18 03:21:58 2015 UTC,I got suspicious when they said 'if everyone performs like last year and everyone stays healthy and  we get a few breaks along the way'.  They hadn't fixed some major issues and hoped no one would notice.
Brewers,3a8s68,Nadie_AZ,2,Thu Jun 18 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"I mean....they did address 1B. What else were they supposed to do? Overhaul the entire lineup?

Brewers,3a8s68,ANumenorean,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue I saw last season was lack of hitting with runners in scoring position. Oh and bunting. Drove me insane.

Brewers,3ab33j,nior_labotomy,2,Thu Jun 18 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"""Francisco Rodriguez, RHP, Brewers  The Brewers were the first team in baseball to plummet to 20 games out of first place. So their sell-off could start at any time. But other teams view Kyle Lohse (6.44 ERA, about $6 million of salary remaining) and Matt Garza (5.07 ERA, with two more guaranteed seasons remaining, at $12.5 million a year) as ""Plan B or Plan C"" type options, said one exec. In other words, they're the kind of guys who inspire you to ""wait and see if you can do better.""  Rodriguez, on the other hand, is having another one of those years in which he proves that his doubters continue to underestimate him (a 1.13 ERA, 12 hits and 26 strikeouts in 24 innings). The Brewers have acquired him four different times now but have traded him in midseason only once (in 2013). And despite his great start and their appetite for moving him, he's still a tough sell.  One big reason is, he's not a rental this time around. He has $5.5 million guaranteed next season, plus a $6 million option or $4 million buyout for 2017. And the closer market appears very limited. But you'll be hearing his name a lot over the next few weeks.  Our prediction: Stays right where he is."""
Brewers,3ab33j,Valleyoan,4,Thu Jun 18 17:36:57 2015 UTC,My favorite part:   The Brewers have acquired him four different times now but have traded him in midseason only once (in 2013).
Brewers,3ab33j,Valleyoan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"Can't forget to mention the guy is a wife-beater. Do front-offices really care about that kind of off the field stuff? No way to tell really. Most will never admit it.   But there have been brewer fans that've come out and said they're against the signing of K-Rod (obviously mostly women) and if he goes somewhere else, it's a guarantee that someone will bring it up and it will stir negative discussion about him there as well.  That contract is a little pricey, but when you measure it up against someone like Neil Cotts' $3mil this year, or Broxton's $9mil.. it doesn't seem too bad. Especially considering the production.   So again I'll just reiterate that I think a lot of Krod's trade-ability has to do with his off the field stuff. I don't think anyone's going to come out and say it, but it has to play a role."
Brewers,3ab33j,workthrowaway68,2,Thu Jun 18 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"""Aramis Ramirez, 3B, Brewers  Lots of buzzing out there about which position players the Brewers might be willing to move. Carlos Gomez? Jonathan Lucroy? Jean Segura? Even if GM Doug Melvin is open to it, his owner, Mark Attanasio, is likely to have other ideas. But Ramirez, who has said he's going to retire after this season, is in a whole different category.  You could envision a team like the Giants taking a shot at him. But every team we've mentioned him to acts totally disinterested.  ""Who would take him?"" asked one GM. ""He makes a lot of money [$14 million]. He's not playing well [.209/.248/.382]. He can't play defense anymore. Unless they pay a ton of money, he's not going anywhere. That's my guess.""  Our prediction: That's our guess, too. Not going anywhere."""
Brewers,3ab33j,workthrowaway68,2,Thu Jun 18 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"No way we're going to eat any of the contract for someone else, unfortunately.   He needs to do the honorable thing and just retire."

Brewers,3a7k2k,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:11:08 2015 UTC,We should just DFA Broxton after this game
Brewers,3a7k2k,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:55:17 2015 UTC,They should have DFA'd him after he gave up the bases clearing triple.  Suddenly Counsell comes out to drag him out in the middle of a batter and he gives everyone hugs in the dugout.  I'd laugh.
Brewers,3a7k2k,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Jun 18 02:59:37 2015 UTC,Time to put in a position player as pitcher.  Why waste another reliever?
Brewers,3a7k2k,silentjay01,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"""Not sure if he's hurt or just not pitching well""  Yeah right BA"

Brewers,3a7k2k,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:51:34 2015 UTC,We'll need to give the other team a Klondike bar

Brewers,3a7k2k,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:52:11 2015 UTC,Why's that?
Brewers,3a7k2k,cweb96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:44:28 2015 UTC,because almost every Broxton save opportunity involved him putting the tying run aboard and trying to get out of that.
Brewers,3a7k2k,rbhindepmo,2,Thu Jun 18 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"Krod does that, but at least he usually gets out of it.  Broxton this year has just been absolute dog shit.  Actually dog shit could probably pitch better.  Look at his fucking ERA."

Brewers,3a7k2k,cweb96,3,Thu Jun 18 02:44:10 2015 UTC,Lol they ruled that a triple.
Brewers,3a7k2k,TheBause,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:35:16 2015 UTC,Well it'd be kinda ridiculous to be a three base error :/

Brewers,3a7k2k,smiles134,3,Thu Jun 18 02:48:20 2015 UTC,There is no fucking way that should be a triple.
Brewers,3a7k2k,necropaw,2,Thu Jun 18 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"It's basically because neither player actually dropped it. A high pop-up in the infield, where the runner keeps going all the way to third, and the fielders both let each other take it, is also a triple. An infield triple."
Brewers,3a7k2k,Dysalot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, i get it...but you still have to assign that to one of the players instead of the pitcher imo.  At some point you need to say: ""okay, the CF/RF should have had that"""

Brewers,3a7k2k,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Anyone else wish we could just see Fiers in long relief?
Brewers,3a7k2k,gobrewcrew,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:22:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  Hes got a better ERA than Garza and Lohse.    Nelson has been pretty good, and tbh that 'young guy' slot thats filling in for Wily right now has been decent.  I see Lohse/Garza being gone by the trade deadline (even if it is for a fucking klondike bar in Lohse's case).  I dunno, maybe they keep Garza for the 'lulz' factor, but if they get an offer hes gone.  If either of them get delt, Fiers is going to stay in the rotation i think."
Brewers,3a7k2k,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"I know he's going to stay in the rotation, but it's becoming disheartening to know that on a good night he might get into the seventh inning, but that normally he might finish the fifth.   And I'd take a whole Klondike bar to be rid of Garza and Lohse both."
Brewers,3a7k2k,gobrewcrew,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:41:13 2015 UTC,I'd let a grown man punch me in the face for them to both be gone honestly.

Brewers,3a8a3v,theamazingkiwi,4,Thu Jun 18 03:31:53 2015 UTC,It depends on who is traded but I'll go with a bit of a bold call and say Michael Reed.
Brewers,3a8a3v,ANumenorean,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Reed has been really hot in AA. He's hitting over .300 and playing good defense like we'd expect. I think if/once Parra is traded, then he should be the guy who comes up..."

Brewers,3a8a3v,smiles134,2,Thu Jun 18 20:19:05 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Orlando Arcia but thats probably not happening for another 1-2 years.
Brewers,3a8a3v,BeHereNow91,4,Thu Jun 18 00:53:59 2015 UTC,I don't think he's next but they actually need to add him to the 40-man roster before the Rule 5 Draft in December so I think that there's a really good chance that he'll get called up in September this season because they'll have to use an option anyways. However he won't be on the Opening Day roster next season.

Brewers,3a8a3v,Valleyoan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:07:18 2015 UTC,I don't know where you'd get the number but you could set up a workout for Melvin and he might sign you if you want to make the league minimum (which is probably a huge raise for you)

Brewers,3a8a3v,Valleyoan,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"lol all of those guys have already made their MLB debut.  The next to make his 'debut' is going to be either Yadiel Rivera, or Orlando Arcia."
Brewers,3a6tkp,brewisbrewin,14,Wed Jun 17 18:03:29 2015 UTC,Crasnick is correct. nobody is going to want lohse or garza unless they pull their heads out of their asses.
Brewers,3a6tkp,Hosko817,8,Wed Jun 17 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"I've got to agree.  And obviously they could be moved... obviously any player could be moved. But if they are of little-to-no value to any other team and the Brewers would end up eating it and not getting a sufficient return in prospects or whatever... then no, they can't be moved."
Brewers,3a6tkp,BrewCrewKevin,3,Wed Jun 17 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with OP.   We live in a world where Carl Crawford's untradable contract was indeed traded, so anyone could be dealt at any given time. Trading Lohse and Garza isn't likely, but it's not impossible."
Brewers,3a6tkp,Union76,2,Wed Jun 17 18:41:20 2015 UTC,And you look at the Josh Hamilton trade too. Anything is possible.
Brewers,3a6tkp,The_Bostache,0,Thu Jun 18 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"See, that's the thing.  OP was arguing grammar more than anything. Crasnick is correct in saying that those guys are untradable at this point. it's too easy to nitpick a statement that needs to be 140 characters or less.  Its like me tweeting ""This rain in Wisconsin is never going to end"" and somebody calling me out, telling my why, in fact,  it is going to end at some point."
Brewers,3a6tkp,Hosko817,2,Thu Jun 18 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"But writing ""they have almost no trade value"" is barely more characters and WAY more correct."
Brewers,3a6tkp,dusters,0,Thu Jun 18 21:10:53 2015 UTC,It's just knit picking.
Brewers,3a6tkp,Hosko817,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"It is literally not the definition of the word, that isn't knit picking"
Brewers,3a6tkp,dusters,3,Fri Jun 19 03:21:55 2015 UTC,If the likes of Becket and Crawford can be traded then Lohse and Garza can be traded
Brewers,3a6tkp,msgbonehead,7,Wed Jun 17 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm totally with Crasnick on this one.  What contending team in their right mind would take effectively the worst starter in all of baseball right before their playoff rum?   & Garza's contract is starting to look like it could be an albatross. I didn't realize he had THREE more years left on his deal after 2015.  And we forfeited a first round draft pick to sign each of these guys? Goodness this organization is in shambles...
Brewers,3a6tkp,MustBeNice,5,Wed Jun 17 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"garza    he has 2 more years ... 3rd year is a $13M vesting option if he pitches 110 games over the first 4 years, otherwise it's a $5M team option"
Brewers,3a6tkp,ilikebaseballbetter,5,Wed Jun 17 19:09:47 2015 UTC,Signing Garza did not cost a draft pick.
Brewers,3a6tkp,ANumenorean,5,Wed Jun 17 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"I still think Melvin has made a couple good trades, but overall hes been a fucking disaster of a GM.    he tried to keep this ship afloat for far too long :/"
Brewers,3a6tkp,necropaw,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see a lot change over the next few weeks too. Lohse isn't a different pitcher than last year but has an incredibly high HR/FB rate and a low strand rate which is inflating his numbers. Maybe he isn't locating as well, but the velocity is still there and I have a tough time believing it's that much more than bad luck.  Same deal with Garza. Ks are a bit down and walks are slightly up but he's not as bad as his numbers show. The contract will be tough to work around though."
Brewers,3a6tkp,sjm1541,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:54:49 2015 UTC,I think Lohse should be easier to move...one less year and a lotta less money but the return will be minuscule for either guy.
Brewers,3a6tkp,cweb96,0,Thu Jun 18 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"Also Crasnick's info is coming straight from the horse's mouth, an MLB executive is literally the guy who has the power to sign one of these pitchers, so I'd say his opinion counts for something.  What's your source? Your gut feeling?  Sorry bud, I'm with Jerry. I do like your blog, but there's such a thing as being TOO optimistic."

Brewers,3a1oj3,SoSublim3,37,Tue Jun 16 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"I've been to St. Louis once, a few years ago. That one time, I witnessed Wainwright pitch a complete game against us. Frankly, the stadium was beautiful and most of the fans ignored us, while others were gracious.  Except one guy. One asshole, who heckled me upon entering the stadium, saying Ryan Braun was once a cheater, always a cheater. Wishing our team would lose and that we're not true baseball fans for supporting Braun. Trying to ruin my time in their city.  I'm not just thrilled for this news, but I'm thinking of that one guy, and I hope I come to mind for him. If, somehow, myself and surely other Brewers fans that he's heckled over the years come to his mind today, I want him to picture me flipping him off and laughing in his ugly face. I want this whole mess to be dragged out for possibly years, with others reminding him of what an ass he's been. There are others like him, and they deserve this to be a shit-show. Sorry to the good Cardinals fans, you're just caught in the wake like we were."
Brewers,3a1oj3,indiemike,17,Tue Jun 16 15:50:11 2015 UTC,Apparently that ass hat didn't remember Big Mac? One of the biggest cheaters in the history of the game? I bet that ass hat was cheering his ass off when Mac blasted #70. I know I was as a kid.

Brewers,3a1oj3,smiles134,6,Tue Jun 16 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"Live in stl, go to every crew game I can. They boo braun before every at bat or time he touches a ball. They cheer peralta. I've had cards fans ask me how I could possibly support the brewers because of braun. I ask them about peralta and big Mac. They usually don't realize the hypocrisy of it. Or they say but braun was a total asshole during the investigation! That's when I just tell them well I'm not here to talk about the past."

Brewers,3a1oj3,stingem3929,6,Tue Jun 16 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sure more info will come out, but why the Astros?"
Brewers,3a1oj3,cyan101,5,Tue Jun 16 15:37:53 2015 UTC,Because Jeff L the GM of the Astro's use to work with the Cards and when he left to the Astro's he didn't make many friends apparently and this is a revenge type deal. Now because some people were pissed the Cards Organization is in trouble congrats guys.
Brewers,3a1oj3,smiles134,6,Tue Jun 16 15:54:09 2015 UTC,I really hope its a huge fine that makes them finish in last place for 5 years straight. That would feel sooooooooooo good.
Brewers,3a1oj3,necropaw,5,Tue Jun 16 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"And most likely won't happen. At worst, a few front office employees will be fired. At best they'll lose a competitive balance draft pick. TBF though, I don't really know what precedents there are for punishments in cases like this..."
Brewers,3a1oj3,crewblue,6,Tue Jun 16 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"MLB punishments are pretty unknown.  If the FBI can pin it on certain individuals though, i wouldnt be surprised to see some Martha Stewart shit go down."
Brewers,3a1oj3,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"They can't lose draft picks per the CBA. They can't be fined more than $2 million either. But outside of that, the commissioner has a lot of loosely defined leverage in doing what he feels is necessary. The closest precedent I can think of is when a few teams have been punished or warned about breaking laws when signing international prospects. The Dodgers, White Sox, and Nationals have had problems in recent years regarding this stuff but no one got a serious penalty beyond a few forced resignations."
Brewers,3a1oj3,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:02:50 2015 UTC,Hmmm that's interesting that they can't lose draft picks

Brewers,3a30rg,burts_beads,-12,Wed Jun 17 03:14:26 2015 UTC,Yeah no.  It kills me to see former Brewers do well for other teams.  Doug traded aoki for...Will Smith.
Brewers,3a30rg,MustBeNice,8,Tue Jun 16 22:49:14 2015 UTC,I still think that trade was a good idea.
Brewers,3a30rg,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Jun 17 00:22:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. We are hurting at outfield depth...
Brewers,3a30rg,ksprzk,2,Wed Jun 17 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"We were loaded at OF and needed help in the Bullpen. Yeah, Aoki has been great and still is great (and we could definitely use a hitter like him right now), but when we traded him, we did so to make room in the OF for Khris Davis.   Now, has Khrush developed into the feared hitter we'd hoped, probably not (not ruling him out yet though, Gomez didn't really come into his own until he turned 27), but after how he filled in for Braun during his suspension, we needed to get him in the field every day.  And we needed the bullpen help.  But we should still vote for him in the ASG. And for the Royals. And not for any Cardinals."
Brewers,3a30rg,Il_Tenente,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:55:00 2015 UTC,At the time the team had high hopes for Logan Schaffer too.
Brewers,3a30rg,quickstop_rstvideo,-5,Wed Jun 17 10:23:06 2015 UTC,I agree and was fully for them trading him. But couldn't they have gotten a 1B or 3B prospect for him? Will Smith just seems like a terrible return for such a coveted type of player.
Brewers,3a30rg,MustBeNice,6,Wed Jun 17 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"Nori wasn't that coveted when we traded him and had only one year left on his contract. I'd call him more of a niche player than coveted.   He also struggled at times last season, not batting above .260 for any of the months, May-July, before turning it on later in the season (as with the rest of the Royals).  Smith looked good after transitioning to a relief role and is considerably younger (he's not eligible for free agency until 2020).   Once again, I really do like Nori, but he was never going to garner a top-flight corner infielder in a trade."

Brewers,3a2hn6,smiles134,12,Tue Jun 16 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"..so keeping him WANG in the bullpen last year was pretty much for nothing if a team claims him?   I mean I get why they did this because if it doesn't work out, well, they're still not going to be any good. And if Dominguez does live up to his first round potential and something clicks, it's great for them. But I can't help but feel the sting of effectively playing with a 24 man roster most of last year.  Plus now there is little reason to post WANG any more if he's claimed. >:("

Brewers,3a2hn6,ANumenorean,6,Tue Jun 16 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"Davis has a lot fewer PA than most though, he has the highest walk rate on the team at 11.2%, that's way above league average...Gomez on the other hand, well we already know what he's about and we love him anyway."
Brewers,3a2hn6,MustBeNice,0,Tue Jun 16 22:57:24 2015 UTC,Interesting I never would've guessed. I remember earlier in the year he had gone like a month without a single walk. Perhaps it was 2014. But I always assumed he had a low walk rate after that. Thanks for clueing me in.
Brewers,3a2hn6,ANumenorean,2,Wed Jun 17 03:02:43 2015 UTC,IKR? I can't remember if it was this year or last either but that was a ridiculous streak of not talking a walk.

Brewers,3a2hn6,ClickClackHotHand,2,Wed Jun 17 03:13:06 2015 UTC,"the yankees and a lot of other teams have done this very thing. in 2010 the yankees took robert fish from the angels in a rule 5 pick, and fish was claimed off waivers by the royals in march of 2011. you could even argue that was a worse embarrassment for the yankees as the guy was cut earlier, not to mention cut again by the royals just a few weeks later.   you have to go back to 2008 and everth cabrera to find the last real name guy who made it as a rule 5 pick. since then there have been 105 other rule 5 picks by nearly every team.  the brewers took a chance on a rule 5 guy and it didn't work. makes them about the same as every other team in the league.  EDIT: i overlooked hector rendon, taken by the cubs in the 2013 rule 5 draft. make that 2 of the last 105 picks made a significant impact."
Brewers,3a2hn6,machiavellism,9,Wed Jun 17 13:20:30 2015 UTC,From the Astros huh. Better call the Cardinals to see what they know about this guy.

Brewers,3a2hn6,The_Bostache,4,Tue Jun 16 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"This is a weird move in my opinion. Dominguez was only hitting in the .250s in AAA this year, hit .215 with the Astros last year. Seems to be low-average, medium-power kind of guy. He's 25. People seem to be thinking this is a sign that the Crew are going to be trading A-Ram soon. Surprised we DFA'd Wang, though. If another team claims him, that Rule 5 selection will have been a complete waste."
Brewers,3a2hn6,The_Bostache,5,Tue Jun 16 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, someone should be fired if that happens.  The bullpen was screwed over last year with him out there.  The crew wasted a whole year and a major league roster spot for nothing."
Brewers,3a2hn6,ehrenj,6,Tue Jun 16 18:45:00 2015 UTC,Pretty much what I was thinking. Having him there was a big part of why our bullpen was gassed come the later parts of the season.
Brewers,3a2hn6,itzjamesftw,2,Tue Jun 16 18:46:26 2015 UTC,"So we have Perez, H. Gomez, Dominguez, and Ramirez? Hmmm my only guess is that Counsell must really like versatility and that Ramirez is on the way out soon."

Brewers,3a2hn6,BarcaBadger,2,Wed Jun 17 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"not trying to make waves but what makes you say the bullpen was gassed at the end of the season? in september (the brewers were still in first place until august 31) their bullpen's era was 2.54 - 3rd in the league behind only the mets and pirates. they pitched 82 innings that month, 3rd in the nl behind the cubs and dodgers. the bullpen had 3 wins and 3 losses, putting them right at the league average. while our starting pitching and offense disappeared in september, there's nothing to suggest keeping wang, who went on the dl around the all-star break and didn't take up a roster spot again until september callups, gassed the bullpen."
Brewers,3a2hn6,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"Just take a look at someone like Zach Duke's stats, or really anyone's and compare them from the 1st half of the season to the second half. Nealy everyone's K/BB went down, their FIP goes up. You could tell they were tired."

Brewers,3a2hn6,MasterCashier,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"as another person said, Ron had little to do with Wang being in the bullpen, that was clear because Ron hardly ever used him even in blowouts."

Brewers,3a2hn6,MustBeNice,2,Tue Jun 16 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"Well, we have no third base depth and no real option for next year since they don't seem to want to try Rogers out there.  Dominguez is 25 and could benefit from a scenery change.  Wang has a near 6 ERA and a less than encouraging walk to K ratio.  I know it feels wasted after holding onto him last year but, odds are he goes unclaimed and his numbers didn't show much improvement. For the first time in a while the Brewers strength is pitching depth in the minors.  I don't think this is a move to get all up in arms about."
Brewers,3a2hn6,itzjamesftw,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"Rule 5 selections in general these days do not turn out to be good players. It happens every now and then, but having a Rule 5 pick turn out to be a waste is the more common scenario."
Brewers,3a2hn6,necropaw,-1,Wed Jun 17 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"Why do we insist on grabbing players off waivers that are batting awful? I hope you are right about the Aramis trade, it's the only way this move makes sense in the slightest bit."
Brewers,3a2hn6,brewcrew2_2,6,Tue Jun 16 19:04:25 2015 UTC,This is very standard for teams that have little to lose. Grab on to former highly touted prospects and hope they can reform them.

A lot of prospects that we gave up on and have moved on to other teams and done very well. Even major league players have left here and gotten much better.

Brewers,3a24wu,unmisunderestimated,0,Wed Jun 17 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"trade them for what? lucroy's hitting .229 and slugging .305, just off an injury. gomez has missed 4 of the last 5 games due to injury and is below his career obp. i don't see a deal for either one of them now coming up with us getting the good end of the deal. on the other hand, segura and parra are hitting above their career averages and could probably get more value than they're worth. plus we have depth at shortstop in the minors, practically none at catcher now that clint coulter is an outfielder. i just don't see how trading lucroy makes us better in the years ahead if we have maldanado or some guy we never heard of in the minors hitting in lucroy's spot when we still have him through 2017."
Brewers,3a24wu,ehrenj,2,Wed Jun 17 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"Since when does injury make a player worthless? Lucroy's numbers are going to come back as health improves, he's still a 2-4 WAR player at a premium position. Also the fact that his contract is so owner friendly means that in a ridiculous seller's market he's worth top dollar since his contract won't weigh against his value. And are you actually serious about Gomez? His OBP is .004 less than his career OBP, which doesn't matter at all since he's still a 2-4 WAR player that would improve almost any offense in the league.  Do you actually think this team is going to be competitive next year? Newsflash, the farm system is terrible, if they aren't going to compete this year then we aren't going to next year. The best bet for Melvin is to tear down and rebuild while picking up as many top-tier prospects as possible this year to actually compete post 2016-17."
Brewers,3a0qoy,MustBeNice,4,Tue Jun 16 09:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think the issue (form our vantage point) is continuing to clamor for trades as the way to rebuild.  As your example clearly shows (OP), trades are not the means of doing it.  The draft is--and this new crop looks like a step in the right direction (finally).  Look at it from the Rangers' perspective: they would not have made the deal if they thought they were getting some crappy pitcher.  We need to expect the same result if we deal Lucroy, Gomez, etc., like everyone here wants to do.  Those guys are good players, and they are going to be good for the teams we trade them to.  They are almost certain to outperform whatever we receive in return, even in the long run."
Brewers,3a0qoy,phoenix9797,-2,Tue Jun 16 12:40:15 2015 UTC,"My problem isn't so much with trades in general, but more specifically the return Doug gets for his assets.   When the Royals traded Greinke, he had just had by far the worst season of his career, and yet they still received Jeffress, Cain, Escobar, AND Odorizzi. This is an insane return. Then they flipped Odorizzi for James Shields, and that core carried them to a World Series...lead by a manager Doug fired. And they have the best record in the AL right now. Doug trades Aoki, a vastly popular player and a massive asset to any team...for Will Smith. A non-closer average reliever, who may need to doctor balls to even be effective. Aoki is currently hitting .324 with 12 SB & 33 Walks. Will Smith is....wiping off his arm with a tissue. Let's see what his haul for Yovani was.  An established pitcher with a ton of value.  This is what Doug got: Diplan: He's a kid, he's 17, no one knows what this guy will be, it'd be a huge risk to even bet this guy will even get a cup of coffee in the big leagues, let alone be of any value. And even if he does, he's a minimum of 6 years away. Corey Knebel - Great. Another mid inning reliever. A dime a dozen. Luis Sardinas - The big star of the trade, the pies de resistance.  He's 22 and he hasn't hit at any level.  He had an eye popping .221/.243/.250 slash line in the big leagues this year. He hits for ZERO power and very little plate discipline. In 1537 AB's he has 5 home runs and 95 walks. For reference, Bryce Harper currently has 53 walks in only 200 ABs. I'll be surprised if Sardinas ever even becomes league average.   Now this is in a time when they had zero depth. Mostly unproven  Fiers, Nelson, and Peralta are gonna anchor the rotation? Making Yo expendable? It just doesn't make sense.   Sure he got Segura, but I truly think Segura is the most overrated Brewer. He had one good season and has been largely crap since then. His .285 average looks decent, but then you realize he refuses to take walks (6 on the year) and doesnt really hit for doubles or triples.  Not only that, but he already has 10 errors on the year and were not even close to the All Star Break. Also he shot himself in the foot by releasing to the public that he butted heads with Lawrie. Lawrie was a top 50 prospect and the return wasn't as good as he should've gotten."
Brewers,3a0qoy,necropaw,3,Tue Jun 16 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"When the Royals traded Greinke, he had just had by far the worst season of his career, and yet they still received Jeffress, Cain, Escobar, AND Odorizzi. This is an insane return. Then they flipped Odorizzi for James Shields, and that core carried them to a World Series...lead by a manager Doug fired. And they have the best record in the AL right now.   Youre completely ignoring what we got in return for Grienke when we traded him, some of which hasnt even made it to the majors yet (due to being young).  Youre also ignoring that he was the anchor pitcher on our run to the NLCS.   for Will Smith. A non-closer average reliever,   Dude, seriously?  hes one of the better relievers in the bigs, and apparently is 'doing what everyone does', which many players seem to be backing it up.  Hes just apparently too stupid to hide it well.    Dont get me wrong, Doug has tried to keep things afloat for far too long after selling off to try to take it all in 2011.  He needed to cut his losses then and restock the farm, but he continued to take aging pitchers on, which is unfortunate for us as fans."
Brewers,3a0qoy,necropaw,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:46 2015 UTC,"Dude seriously? he's one of the better relievers in the bigs   How can you say that? By what metric can you possibly defend that?  He was worth .1 WAR last year. Not 1, .1, as in a tenth of a win.  Keep in mind the average MLB has about 2 WAR. I can recall a stretch where he blew about 3 or 4 sure wins in a row. He is not good. He's not even average.  Calling him ""one of the better relievers in the league is insane. I mean I know we're Brewers fans, but look around the league.  Of pitchers who pitched at least 40 Innings last year, Smith was 208th in ERA at 3.70. Amongst the likes of Cesar Ramos and Justin Grimm. Ever heard of those guys? Yeah neither have I. There's a reason for that.  You seem respectful, so I'm doing my best not to come off as a dick. But the fact of the matter is that Melvin has been getting subpar returns for bankable assets, while at the same time has gotten rid of every decent prospect to come through the organization, a ton of which are now stars for other teams"
Brewers,3a0qoy,theamazingkiwi,2,Tue Jun 16 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smithwi04.shtml  Hes a young player, and only getting better.  Last year was a slight regression, though considering 2012 he wasnt used nearly as much (likely in lower stress situations) thats not terribly surprising.  So far this year the guy has a 1.59 ERA, though he hasnt been used very much at all. (not his fault, we just havent needed our good relievers because were in the gutter).  Also remember that hes a lefty, and they tend to go for a premium even without the best stats because of the L-L matchup typically being dominant for the pitcher."
Brewers,3a0qoy,theamazingkiwi,-2,Tue Jun 16 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"He's about to be 26, he's not super young anymore.  And sure he has a 1.59 ERA  in 22 Innings this year, not impressed. Finding relievers that can do that are a dime a dozen. Tom Gorzelanny had a .8 ERA last year in 20-something innings.  Tom Gorzelanny is not a good pitcher.  He has a 6+ ERA this year.  Dillon Betances, Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, Wade Davis, Craig Kimbrel. These are guys that do it year in and year out. These are top relievers. Will Smith not even fit to hold their jock straps."
Brewers,3a0qoy,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"Will Smith is pretty damn good by SIERA and xFIP. By those statistics Will Smith is beating out some big boy relievers this year including Wade Davis and Aroldis Chapman, plus Smith is left handed, so there is a lot more value there than you are giving credit for."
Brewers,3a0qoy,smiles134,-6,Wed Jun 17 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"Will Smith has a 3.13 xFIP, suggesting he's actually been really lucky this year, where Wade Davis has a 2.85 xFIP.  So no, even with your cherry picked stat, you're wrong. But nice try.  I swear I feel like I'm taking crazy pills on this sub sometimes."
Brewers,3a0qoy,smiles134,2,Wed Jun 17 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"I see you and I are gonna disagree for a while and I hate discussions that go no where so I'll end this here for both our benefits. Just remember this, Smith is a very good reliever, and SIERA is a bit better to measure that than xFIP. Yeah I should have worded that better and clarified my statement, but I'm not wrong and Smith has nice value."
Brewers,3a0qoy,smiles134,3,Wed Jun 17 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's also useless to look at relievers stats over a single season which ends up hurting your argument a bit, but you're right about Smith when you look at it in the bigger picture.  If you want to use xFIP, from 2013-2015 (when he entered the bullpen) he's 16th for all relievers and is 11th in k/9. There's not going to be a perfect stat to judge relievers by due to their low innings, but you're right that Smith is a damn good pitcher."
Brewers,3a0qoy,smiles134,4,Wed Jun 17 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"You have a very strange way of looking at the trades we've made...  Greinke, while, he may have had a bad season the year before, still had an FIP of 3.34, a WAR of 4.7, and the year before that had a WAR of 8.7. Then Greink came here and had a career year. That trade was the right move to make.  Aoki only had one year left on his contract and we traded for a guy with a lot of potential with 4 years left on a team friendly deal. Also, if you haven't noticed, Will Smith has the best FIP and K% on our pitching staff. He has a SIERA of 2.53 this year, and 2.73 over the last two, which is fantastic.  I don't know where you're valuing Segura at, but his OPS right now is only 40 points below 2013, and it's 100 points better than it was last year. He's got a good chance to bat at least as well as he did in 2013. His fielding isn't great, which is why he'll likely move to 2B if we don't trade him.  Edit: I didn't see you compare Harper's plate discipline to Sardinas. As /u/phoenix9797 said, that's just irresponsible. Not only does Harper have the most walks this year, he also has the highest BB%. It'd be fucking fantastic if Sardinas could walk at that pace, but that's true for literally every other player in the entire league."
Brewers,3a0qoy,phoenix9797,0,Tue Jun 16 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"Then Greinke came here and had a career year   Wait I'm totally confused. As per Baseball Reference   2009: (Royals) 2.16 ERA, 229 IP, 10.4 WAR [Won Cy Young] 2010: (Royals) 4.17 ERA, 220 IP 3.4 WAR Then after this subpar year, and right before Greinke's salary doubles, Royals smartly decide to trade him. 2011: (Brewers) 3.83 ERA, 171 IP 1.5 WAR .   You called his year with the Brewers a ""career year""? In what sense could you possibly defend that? 2 years earlier he had nearly 2 runs less in ERA, a full 9 Higher WAR, pitched 58 more innings (which is equal to about 8 more 7 inning starts...anyone remember that basketball injury Greinke suffered causing him to miss April?)  Compared with his ERA from the last 3 seasons:   2013: 2.63 2014: 2.71 2015: 1.95   Greinke did not only not have a career year in Milwaukee, he had one of the worst years of his 12 year career."
Brewers,3a0qoy,phoenix9797,2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"Bbref's WAR criminally undervalues pitchers. He had 3.8 WAR according to Fangraphs. His K/9 was better than any other year, and so was his xFIP."
Brewers,3a0qoy,phoenix9797,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"Well if their WAR criminally undervalues pitchers, that just makes his 2009 10.4 WAR all the more impressive. I got all the stats from their site, it's not like I cherry picked between different years.  Even if you use Fangraphs, he still only had the 6th best year of his career in terms of WAR.  K/9 looks sexy, but it's ultimately not really indicative of a pitcher's results. & FIP again is nice to look at a pitcher holistically, but when you've got Yuni B & Rickie Weeks kicking balls behind you, your FIP doesn't really matter in the real world."
Brewers,3a0qoy,quickstop_rstvideo,2,Tue Jun 16 22:33:42 2015 UTC,You can't talk about a player's value and then complain about the rest of the team. It doesn't work that way.
Brewers,3a0qoy,ANumenorean,-1,Tue Jun 16 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about that. Im talking about the team that Doug assembled.  HE took on Yuni B. HE gave Rickie Weeks a fat contract. HE's the one that completely ignores defense and instead looks for guys who can hit dingers. He's an old school mentality GM, in the worst way"
Brewers,3a0qoy,theamazingkiwi,2,Tue Jun 16 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'm all for firing Melvin. I don't like him any more than you do, but saying that the Greinke trade was a bad move is absurd."
Brewers,3a0qoy,EthyleneGlycol,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"HE's the one that completely ignores defense and instead looks for guys who can hit dingers.   What?  Lucroy, Segura, Gomez, G. Parra, hell--even Ramirez.  Those guys are more than solid on defense.  And only Ramirez would really be characterized as a ""dinger"" guy.  Are you specifically referring just to the the 1B position, or was your claim really that poorly thought out?"
Brewers,3a0qoy,theamazingkiwi,4,Wed Jun 17 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"I've argued the point several times in this sub: the Royals trade is really one of the very few trades--for any team--that you can point to as a success when one team is trying to recoup some value from a guy whose contract is up soon.  So saying ""Melvin needs to go"" and using the Gallardo trade as the prime evidence is not a solid position.  Very few trades of that sort work out for the team shipping away the MLB-level talent.  We should all expect the very same result if Gomez or Lucroy are dumped.  The other trades you mentioned--the Aoki, Segura, and Lawrie deals--are all perfectly fine moves for those teams at those times.  It is not legitimate to use hindsight to evaluate them as you did.  For example, Aoki was not going to be with the team this season either way, so citing his stats this season is irrelevant.  Also, comparing Sardinas' stats with Harper's is simply irresponsible on your part.   I get the sense that you weren't around for the really bad Brewers teams.  The teams that were put on the field before Melvin got here.  Melvin has brought the team to competitiveness, and expecting any GM to strike gold on every move is just unreasonable.  I think Melvin's made some moves that he shouldn't have, but I also know that I don't see any ""free agent GMs"" that I want to replace him with.  Who do you have in mind?"
Brewers,3a0qoy,crewblue,-4,Tue Jun 16 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing Sardinas with Harper directly, Harper was just context as someone with good plate discipline to show Sardinas has very poor discipline. In fact almost the entire team has very poor plate discipline so he'll fit right in. Khris Davis, Segura, and Gomez all refuse to take walks. Walks are a vastly underrated statistic, as they show plate discipline and a batter's ability to recognize pitches.  The Brewers are 13th in the NL for walks, only ahead of the Phillies and Rockies. Not coincidentally the Brewers, Phillies, and Rockies are all last in their division. Clearly there's a correlation here. Well if you admit it rarely works out for the team trading the proven asset...then why did he make the trade in the first place? Melvin thought he had put together a team ready to compete for the NL pennant! So why then trade your most proven starting pitcher for 3 underwhelming prospects (at postitions you're not even lacking!) You're correct in saying Aoki's stats this year aren't super relevant, but the point was he was a bankable asset with a super high OBP, something every team would desire. Yet the best Doug got for him was Will ""Sunscreen"" Smith. As far as free agent GMs, none! We need a young guy with a sabremetric centered mind. Doug Melvin has repeated time and tjme again that he doesn't care for any fancy statistics. He prefers the good ol ""eye test"".  That's literally why he fell in love with Wilm Smith cause he saw him in person and thought his stuff was impressive.  He's also been known to criticize proven MLB journalists, such as Keith Law, who called Scooter Gennet a glorified backup.  Well Keith doesn't look too far off with his prediction, even though Melvin shoved Scooter in his face as proof that Law was an idiot. They need someone with a Theo Epstein, Billy Beane mold. Past experience is vastly overrated. A new guy who knows his way around the Baseball Reference website could do miles better than what Melvin has done. Also regarding the terrible Brewers teams...that was a matter of payroll. Mark came in and opened up his checkbook and suddenly the Brewers were competitive again. This isn't Doug's doing, any GM coulda signed a bunch of free agents with the money Mark was ponying up. And don't even get me started with Doug's obsession with signing closers."

Yes, this is exactly what I've been saying: trades of this sort are not to be relied upon for a rebuild.  So I would have been perfectly fine with keeping Gallardo for the season.  That being said, the return is probably fair for the salaries and the caliber of the players involved.   A new guy who knows his way around the Baseball Reference website could do miles better than what Melvin has done.   It is naive to think that this statement could be anywhere near true.

Brewers,3a0qoy,tbe170,0,Tue Jun 16 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"How in the ever loving fuck are you comparing the return for Greinke to the return for Gallardo? OK so Greinke was coming off ""the worst season of his career"" (he wasn't), he still put up 4.7 WAR in 2010, and the year before that he put up a freaking 2.16 ERA, 8.7 WAR and won the AL CY Young. There is no comparison here...not to mention that Jeffress is back with the Brewers anyway, let's not forget the fact that Wil Myers (a guy that was essentially the consensus #1 prospect in baseball at the time and coming off a season in which he hit 37 HR between AA and AAA), not Odorizzi was the centerpiece of the Shields trade."
Brewers,3a0qoy,Tuggernuts23,4,Wed Jun 17 21:13:27 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, that Yovani trade was still a good idea, he will likely regress somewhat to end the year with a 3.6 ERA, this team would not be competing with him either. Plus, he was owed 13mil, so likely no K-Rod either, and the trade under these circumstances was quite a success, all this considered. Also, Fiers is very similar to Gallardo in terms of peripherals and he costs less with more years of team control. So trust me, this trade was necessary."
Brewers,3a0qoy,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. I agree the trading of Yovani was not the worst idea ever (although considering the lack of depth, if Doug actually expected to compete this year, which he did, and we all did, it's a terrible move)  BUT, it's moreso I have an issue with WHAT we got. Luis Sardinas, a no-name reliever, & a 17 year old kid is the best haul you could get for a proven commodity such as Yovani? He absolutely could've gotten a better deal on the market. But as a native Texan and former member of the Rangers, it almost seems like Doug was doing them a favor by making this trade."
Brewers,3a0qoy,sjm1541,5,Tue Jun 16 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"Luis Sardinas is a 22-year old kid who was a top 100 prospect in 2013 and 2014.  Even if he never develops into a good hitter he's still great on defense.  Corey Knebel is 23 and was a first round pick.  Diplan is a wild card but from what I've read he definitely has potential.  Considering Gallardo has devolved into an overpaid middle to back of the rotation pitcher, I think the Brewers came out pretty good in that deal."
Brewers,3a0qoy,sjm1541,6,Tue Jun 16 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yovani costed quite a bit for a 2win pitcher, and those players the Brewers got in return do have value."

Brewers,3a0qoy,Nadie_AZ,2,Wed Jun 17 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"The trades Melvin made in 2011 got us to the NLCS. We don't get there without Greinke and Marcum, and we don't get Greinke without losing Odorizzi. Don't forget the Royals also traded him away. And it takes more than 4 months to see value in a trade like the Gallardo trade."
Brewers,3a0qoy,wintva,-6,Wed Jun 17 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"You're totally right.  I hope you enjoy the next 5-10 years of awful Brewers baseball while watching teams like the Rays, Royals, Cardinals and Cubs be in the post season year after year. It was so worth it just to be able to have watched the Brewers lose in the NLCS 4 years ago. My mistake"
Brewers,3a0qoy,ecpackers,3,Wed Jun 17 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"So let's say your team has Escobar at SS, Lawrie at 3B and Cain in CF. Does that team ever make the playoff, much less make an NLCS? The Brewers have never developed the pitching to succeed and can't attract free agents above the level of Kyle Lohse/Matt Garza. I just don't really see where the winning comes from without trading for pitching."
Brewers,3a0qoy,ecpackers,-2,Wed Jun 17 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely I do. Casey McGeehee had an incredibly terrible year at 3B, while Lawrie had a ridiculously good rookie year. Although Nyjer Morgan had a great year, I think most would agree Cain by far the better player here. And Alcides Escobar over Yuni B? Are you kidding me? Night and day. Not to mention Odorizzi in the rotation.  It's absolutely plausible they make the NLCS.  Greinke missed the first month, and again I remind you, he had a 3.83 ERA. That's incredibly average. Marcum was good, not great, and he had a 15 ERA in the postseason."
Brewers,3a0qoy,CJL13,3,Wed Jun 17 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"Then what is your rotation? Odorizzi didn't break out until last year when he learned a new pitch from Alex Cobb. The sad reality is that Odorizzi probably never would have developed in Milwaukee. If you don't make the trades in 2011 your rotation is Gallardo, Wolf, Narveson, Estrada? Fiers? That rotation never makes the playoffs.   After that, Lawries ""ridiculously good"" rookie year was 43 games with a .383 BABIP. He's been below average ever since. Cain would have ended up either taking the place of Gomez or being replaced by him down the line and the advantage is to Gomez there. In 2011 Morgan would have been significantly better than Cain and Gomez has outperformed him since."

Brewers,39ylm0,jn2010,4,Tue Jun 16 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"How come I've got ""Brewers doom and gloom"" feeling again like in April? Two days ago I was feeling pretty optimistic."
Brewers,39ylm0,adam7765,4,Tue Jun 16 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"Whenever this team looks to get on a roll, they get set right back to their low watermark.  Just that kind of season."
Brewers,39ylm0,fly1ngorb,3,Tue Jun 16 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"Trent seems really mature for just coming out of high school, I have a feeling it won't take long for him to progress through the minors."
Brewers,39ylm0,fly1ngorb,2,Tue Jun 16 00:53:22 2015 UTC,So. Think he will be a Brewer for the long haul? Or will he end up being a piece of trade bait? Assuming he will stay seeing as we are entering a major rebuilding period
Brewers,39ylm0,the_bum_on_the_bus,5,Tue Jun 16 00:55:44 2015 UTC,Hes pretty used to wood now   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Brewers,39ylm0,MasterCashier,5,Tue Jun 16 00:28:09 2015 UTC,Good news: it's only the 1st inning  Bad news: it's only the 1st inning

Brewers,39ylm0,fly1ngorb,5,Tue Jun 16 00:24:43 2015 UTC,Are you fucking shitting me?
Brewers,39ylm0,necropaw,4,Tue Jun 16 00:24:36 2015 UTC,Fan. Fuckin. Tastic.
Brewers,39ylm0,the_bum_on_the_bus,4,Tue Jun 16 00:19:13 2015 UTC,I dunno if he was blocking.  There were a couple inches of plate out there yet.
Brewers,39ylm0,necropaw,6,Tue Jun 16 00:16:32 2015 UTC,...there were a lot of cheers for that hit. KC must travel well.
Brewers,39ylm0,the_bum_on_the_bus,4,Tue Jun 16 00:15:45 2015 UTC,Parra took his sweet time to get to that ball

Brewers,39w3dr,Nashwaukee,2,Mon Jun 15 14:10:01 2015 UTC,I had one of those. I think it was a giveaway from somewhere?

Brewers,39uzpt,MasterCashier,3,Mon Jun 15 00:43:31 2015 UTC,was that an auction item? how much did it set ya back?
Brewers,39uzpt,orangutan9,3,Mon Jun 15 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"It was an auction item, only set me back $375. They had a full set of Maldonado's catcher gear that he wore on Memorial Day so it was the camo design, that went for $1200"
Brewers,39t1i3,silentjay01,20,Sun Jun 14 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"I, for one, wouldn't mind a fire sale. Restock the minors. I can't be the only one who is a little sad to see all of these former Brewers prospects doing well for other teams."
Brewers,39t1i3,OneLegsTheSame,4,Sun Jun 14 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"I actively cheered for Cain and Escobar on their WS run last year.  Those two would be great Brewers, but I'd still do the Greinke trade in a heartbeat.  Other than those two, who else came up in the Brewers system that is excelling for another team?  Matt LaPorta? Brett  Lawrie? Marco Estrada?"
Brewers,39t1i3,squeakyshoe89,3,Mon Jun 15 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"Michael Brantley, arguably the best of them all."
Brewers,39t1i3,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:42:14 2015 UTC,Add Nelson Cruz to the list too.
Brewers,39t1i3,OneLegsTheSame,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:40:41 2015 UTC,Jake Odorizzi is sporting a 2.47 ERA this year for Tampa Bay.
Brewers,39t1i3,miamiflashfan,9,Tue Jun 16 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they're willing to trade Segura.  With the SS help coming through the minors, it'd be silly to hold on to him."
Brewers,39t1i3,pfelon,3,Sun Jun 14 21:32:38 2015 UTC,Glad to know I'm not the only one with that line of thinking around here.
Brewers,39t1i3,theamazingkiwi,4,Sun Jun 14 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"I cant see anyone taking Braun, at least without a ton of money. Better to just keep him.  Other than that, I am fine if any or all on this list goes, depending on who they get back of course. Wish they could pay Carlos long term though."
Brewers,39t1i3,Ofreo,3,Sun Jun 14 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to lean that way with Braun, as well.  I think it's a big risk to trade him and end up paying a bulk of his salary, especially if he finds his hitting ways again.  If we can't get a team to pay 75-80% of his salary, we probably won't deal him."
Brewers,39t1i3,BeHereNow91,2,Mon Jun 15 06:54:46 2015 UTC,"As long as Braun produces like he is playing right now, his salary is about on par for a good rightfielder. If he's hitting well he could be traded without having to eat any cash."
Brewers,39t1i3,crewblue,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"Well, his salary goes up to 20 mil the next 3 seasons then down until the end of the contract, so a team would have to be pretty confident he is in all star form without any juice before trading for him. It is a decent contract for the Crew if he plays well though. I still don't see too many teams willing to take him on without money, at least if they are offering a good return of players.   That is the great thing about baseball though, you just never know."
Brewers,39t1i3,Ofreo,4,Mon Jun 15 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"Hey look, it's literally everyone I listed in that one thread and that one guy called me an idiot. lol"
Brewers,39t1i3,smiles134,4,Sun Jun 14 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"I hope Lind doesnt go to the Cards, that would make me sad"
Brewers,39t1i3,BrianTheLady,5,Sun Jun 14 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the last trade the Crew made with the Cards has worked out great for us, lets keep it up and take more pitching."
Brewers,39t1i3,theamazingkiwi,5,Sun Jun 14 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, Blazek really has shown up as a really solid reliever and we've got him for this season plus five more. Lets hope the same happens with Lind (and then the Cards lose in the NLDS).  As a side note since we're on the subject of the Blazek trade, looks like Axford has finally found his stride in Colorado. 1-0, 11 saves and a 0.50 ERA."
Brewers,39t1i3,SolidRambo,4,Sun Jun 14 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"Woah, and in Colorado no less."
Brewers,39t1i3,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:39:53 2015 UTC,It's almost as if thin air really isn't that big of a deal.
Brewers,39t1i3,BeHereNow91,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:56:35 2015 UTC,I would have thought K-Rod to be much higher on that list - certainly above Braun.

Brewers,39t6lf,TheBause,2,Sun Jun 14 20:19:03 2015 UTC,Terrible call. 3-1 vs 2-2 is big.

Brewers,39t6lf,KQ2eZPackers,2,Sun Jun 14 20:07:39 2015 UTC,Carlos Gomez leadoff bunt hit next inning.  Calling it.
Brewers,39t6lf,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:07:16 2015 UTC,I see we're at the freebie strikes point of a no-hitter/perfect game.

Brewers,39t6lf,theamazingkiwi,3,Sun Jun 14 18:31:47 2015 UTC,Upon further review Gennett still made a pretty dumb choice.
Brewers,39t6lf,brewcrew2_2,2,Sun Jun 14 18:27:00 2015 UTC,This is why we need a replay official to look at every play.
Brewers,39t6lf,BeHereNow91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:26:58 2015 UTC,I wonder if this is the first time the first two outs of the game were overturned calls...
Brewers,39t6lf,smiles134,2,Sun Jun 14 18:26:46 2015 UTC,Let's try to get all outs from challenges.
Brewers,39t6lf,TheBause,3,Sun Jun 14 18:26:26 2015 UTC,So this is how Jungmann is going to get his outs eh?
Brewers,39t6lf,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"He's out!  Damn Scoot, you might be lucky."

Brewers,39t6lf,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:18:59 2015 UTC,So what do we expect Jungmann to do? I dont know anything about him
Brewers,39t6lf,BrianTheLady,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"If he can keep the walks down, he should do fine, but the Nationals are a good offensive team, so we'll see. Harper being out is certainly helpful for him."
Brewers,39t6lf,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:19:34 2015 UTC,Whelp Harper is out after the 9th inning HBP.  Predict when and where Braun is hit today:
Brewers,39t6lf,brewcrew2_2,3,Sun Jun 14 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"1st inning, Lind grand slam next pitch"
Brewers,39t6lf,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"I really hope that doesn't happen today.  We did retaliate against the Reds, but that series was full of bad blood.  This series going well - you guys knocked out our boy Jordan Zimmerman in four(?), and we got our rookie Ross a win yesterday.  Let's keep this series clean and see what happens!"
Brewers,39t6lf,theOnlyGuyInTheRoom,2,Sun Jun 14 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"At the game, guess we'll find out if I'm good or bad luck. Also, if at any point there's a crazed fan on the field try not to worry I'm just trying to rally the team"

Brewers,39t6lf,necropaw,2,Sun Jun 14 16:39:05 2015 UTC,Looks like the rain should clear up before game time. Its nice and partly cloudy here in Madison. Maybe they'll be able to open the roof.
Brewers,39t6lf,TheBause,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:49:39 2015 UTC,i think they normally keep it closed if theres any chance of rain
Brewers,39t6lf,BrianTheLady,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:52:15 2015 UTC,Thankfully we have a roof.
Brewers,39uc36,fly1ngorb,8,Sun Jun 14 21:10:30 2015 UTC,Scherzer deserved a no-hitter.  He struck out 16 and didn't allow a single line drive or hard hit ball.  Gennett's walk was the best at bat by the Brewers.  Absolutely spectacular game by Scherzer.
Brewers,39uc36,brewcrew2_2,3,Sun Jun 14 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"Gomez just said in post-game that he didn't enjoy getting that base hit.  Said he would have enjoyed getting a ""real hit.""  Pretty good on him.  Tough to lose a no-no on that kind of hit."
Brewers,39uc36,BeHereNow91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:39:52 2015 UTC,That's probably why he didn't bunt
Brewers,39uc36,theamazingkiwi,3,Sun Jun 14 21:52:28 2015 UTC,No way...Gomez would consider a bunt hit a real hit.
Brewers,39uc36,brewcrew2_2,3,Sun Jun 14 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bunting is different than making crappy contact and just happening to find the gap."
Brewers,39uc36,BeHereNow91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:59:18 2015 UTC,I'm sure he does. But it's still an unwritten rule in baseball that you don't bunt in a no-hit bid.
Brewers,39uc36,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Jun 15 14:47:44 2015 UTC,I was there.  Don't care.  Least I haven't witnessed a no hitter against my team.  :D
Brewers,39uc36,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"See, at those, I'm almost wishing for a no-no.  I was at one game in... probably about 2009 or so? The opposing pitcher (I'd have to look up details) had a perfect game going into the 9th. I think Gabe Kapler broke it up, then some Sept. Callup (might have been Mat Gamel actually?) got his first big-league hit for the 2nd hit of the 9th.  The crew was down like 9-0 or something like that though. Once Kapler got his hit, everybody left. I was really hoping to see a perfect game.  I'll have to find details of that game... one of the more captivating ones I've seen, unfortunately.  EDIT: Found it! Chris Young. Sept. 7 2008"
Brewers,39uc36,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:50:43 2015 UTC,Fuckin' Parra.
Brewers,39uc36,TheBause,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:13:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. I bet Rendon gets Sherzer a fat ass steak for not getting to that bloop.
Brewers,39uc36,jamesbutcooler,3,Sun Jun 14 21:32:58 2015 UTC,I just didn't understand why people at Miller Park wanted to Brewers to get no-hit. Like I get that it's historic but like really our home team your rooting against?
Brewers,39uc36,The_Bostache,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:37:20 2015 UTC,There were a ton of cheers when gogo got the hit fwiw
Brewers,39uc36,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:46:53 2015 UTC,Everyone around me wanted the no hitter to happen.
Brewers,39uc36,The_Bostache,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"I've got to say, man, I'm with them. At a certain point, you accept the loss and hope to witness history. It's harder in only a 4-run game... But I was at a game in 08 when Chris Young had a perfect game into the 8th inning, and the crew was down 10-0. I was hoping for a perfect game."
Brewers,39uc36,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"If we are going to lose anyway, it would be a cool thing to see first hand."
Brewers,39uc36,allonbacuth,2,Mon Jun 15 14:35:45 2015 UTC,When only having one hit still feels like a win.
Brewers,39uc36,silentjay01,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:34:35 2015 UTC,Remember when Gomez got his bloop hit it was still a perfect game.  I was there. I had accepted Scherzer was dominating and wouldn't be beat that day. A big part of me wanted to see a perfect game. Against my team or not.
Brewers,39uc36,muffin_man84,0,Mon Jun 15 19:28:25 2015 UTC,Our team is so bad a bat needed to die for our sins.

Brewers,39q0ro,necropaw,5,Sat Jun 13 21:52:48 2015 UTC,I can't stand when a pitcher can't regroup after a HR and allows another run because of it.  And with two-outs no less!

Brewers,39q0ro,KQ2eZPackers,2,Sat Jun 13 21:43:48 2015 UTC,Hard to throw strikes if there isn't a strike zone.

Brewers,39q0ro,KQ2eZPackers,-1,Sat Jun 13 21:38:17 2015 UTC,Both were balls.
Brewers,39q0ro,CornDoggyStyle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:39:25 2015 UTC,The first one was an obvious strike.  If you can't agree on that then I'm not even going to bother debating the second.
Brewers,39q0ro,jn2010,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:41:02 2015 UTC,They were both close according to pitch track but not strikes.
Brewers,39q0ro,CornDoggyStyle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"By 'first one', he's referring to the missed call before the HR in the 3rd inning, just to be clear.  I think."
Brewers,39q0ro,fly1ngorb,2,Sat Jun 13 21:43:56 2015 UTC,Yeah.
Brewers,39q0ro,jn2010,3,Sat Jun 13 21:44:27 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I was doing something else when Rendon walked. Didn't catch it. I'll take your word for it. Umps have been terrible this year.
Brewers,39q0ro,CornDoggyStyle,2,Sat Jun 13 21:47:39 2015 UTC,Umps have been terrible this year.   It has seemed really bad.

Brewers,39nzm7,ultra242,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:18:45 2015 UTC,My first game of the year was a good one.  Last time I watched them lose twice to the Cubs.
Brewers,39ph00,Arrys,5,Sat Jun 13 14:05:21 2015 UTC,They said last night he's still not running 100% (I believe on purpose as a precaution) probably the same with hitting. Lots of your power comes from below the waist.
Brewers,39ph00,ksprzk,4,Sat Jun 13 14:30:11 2015 UTC,The thing with Luc is even if his hitting isn't good he still calls a great game behind the plate which almost has more of an impact on the game.
Brewers,39ph00,orange_lazarus1,3,Sat Jun 13 15:15:51 2015 UTC,There's nothing to worry about Luc.  He had a dreadful start before getting hurt which was really shocking because he was killing the ball in spring training.  After the injury he's looked fine.  Still getting back to full strength but hitting .250 since coming of the DL and should be back to his normal self very soon.
Brewers,39ph00,brewcrew2_2,2,Sat Jun 13 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Realistically he won't hit like the did last year every single year. I mean he set the record for doubles.  And his foot is good enough to play, which doesn't mean is 100% yet.  Only he can really put a number on it. But to me it looks like he's in the 80-90% range.   He adds so much more than his offense to the team though and I think you can see that with how we've been playing since his return."
Brewers,39ph00,madman86,3,Sat Jun 13 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about Lucroy.  When he slumps he just doesn't hit anything and he has been injured the whole season so far.  He was on an absolute tear the other year too, then broke his finger and kind of limped out the season.  He's looking about 70% to me atm.  Hopefully they give him plenty of rest/1B days so that whatever is ailing him continues to improve."
Brewers,39ph00,Necatorducis,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:03:36 2015 UTC,I was curious as to the general perception of Mesoraco myself..
Brewers,39l66l,chefjerrygarcia,17,Fri Jun 12 14:30:18 2015 UTC,I had the controller of the Brewers come in to speak in one of my classes last month.  He sounded legitimately worried that the Brewers were going to lose money and have shit attendance this season.  As much as it shows the loyalty of Brewers fans I really tip my hat to the Brewers entire front office.  They've made it so Brewers games are a lot of fun regardless of the team performance and their interaction with the fans and the impact they make on the community really makes them a team fans want to cheer for and support even in the toughest of times.
Brewers,39l66l,brewcrew2_2,12,Fri Jun 12 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"Plus, you gotta love that they do all fan giveaways.  Most teams hand out bobblehead to like the first 5-10 thousand that come through the gate."
Brewers,39l66l,silentjay01,6,Fri Jun 12 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"My wife and I have both been Cubs fans since we were kids, but we only go to games at Miller Park, and it doesn't matter who it's against. I think we're attending 5 this year.  The Brewers have figured out how to make Baseball a true family outing. Ticket prices are reasonable, the facilities are fantastic, and the giveaways are a big plus. My kids are learning to be fans of the game, and the atmosphere that the organization provides is really fostering that.   They're doing a lot of things right, and I wish other teams would follow suit."
Brewers,39l66l,dirt820,6,Sat Jun 13 00:40:19 2015 UTC,Take your kids on sunday and they can run the bases after the game and you get to walk on the field while they do it.
Brewers,39l66l,quickstop_rstvideo,2,Sat Jun 13 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"We got to do that in May. Really a neat experience, and the line moves a lot faster than you'd think.   I couldn't come up with a good reason that they should let me run the bases with them, though...."
Brewers,39l66l,dirt820,-10,Sat Jun 13 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"The Brewers break even if they draw 3 million.  They only time the team actually makes money year over year is if they make the playoffs and get extra ticket revenues from that.  The further they go, the bigger the profits.  Its simply life as the smallest market team with a horrible TV deal.  I have never quite understood the joy over this anomaly.  I would much rather have a great team with crap attendance, than have big crowds and a bad team.  i think a lot of it has to do with the fact thta Miller Park is a big bar in summer and the parking lot as well."
Brewers,39l66l,workthrowaway68,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"Didn't they just renegotiate the TV deal with FS? I know FS is carrying almost all Brewers games this year (think there was like 1/2 a dozen that weren't on TV, and 99% of the TV ones were on FSWI)."
Brewers,39l66l,madman86,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"I was told by the controller that in terms of revenue, ticket revenues is #1 followed by revenue sharing at #2.  I'd imagine for most teams tv revenue would be top two."
Brewers,39l66l,brewcrew2_2,0,Fri Jun 12 16:43:53 2015 UTC,yeah until the Brewers can redo their current tv contract they will be getting screwed out of some good revenue.
Brewers,39l66l,unmisunderestimated,0,Fri Jun 12 17:33:46 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter when the contract is redone. Fact is that TV revenue will be limited by the Cubs to the south and the Twins to the west until true revenue sharing in MLB is implemented.
Brewers,39l66l,workthrowaway68,-1,Sat Jun 13 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"yes, with the changing tv viewership things like live sports are getting better commercial money.  The brewers can make more money with a better tv deal."
Brewers,39l66l,Beginnerwithnoluck,0,Sat Jun 13 04:31:46 2015 UTC,"I believe so, but since they are in such a small market its a very bad deal in comparison to what the other teams have."
Brewers,39l66l,brewcrew2_2,10,Fri Jun 12 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"I work in the ticket office and I can say a big contributor to this was the free tickets given out through the Pick N Save promotion. Without that promo we would have been in much worse shape through the month of May-- weekdays especially. The BP promotion is also a HUGE inflater of our attendance in bad years. It's still very impressive looking at our attendance compared to every other team in MLB and you have to wonder why other markets (Cleveland, ChiWhite Sox, Miami) don't get as creative in terms of promos. Or maybe they do and they aren't such a hot sell.  I also think the whole ""Brewers are scared to rebuild because they'll lose money"" is way overblown, because the money they get from attendance and concessions is peanuts compared to their TV deal and other income streams."
Brewers,39l66l,bamfra,2,Fri Jun 12 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"The pirates too, great team for the last few years and they are averaging 25,000.  Why don't more teams do these giveaways?"
Brewers,39l66l,xsists,7,Fri Jun 12 15:11:05 2015 UTC,"Gotta think the roof has plenty to do with this.  In these early months the weather could be crummy, but it doesn't matter.  I think that really helps people through the gate."
Brewers,39l66l,xsists,16,Fri Jun 12 15:11:59 2015 UTC,The roof was the best investment the Brewers ever made.
Brewers,39l66l,GetOuttaHereGone,4,Fri Jun 12 16:41:52 2015 UTC,It boggles my mind that any team in the Midwest or Northeast would build a stadium that doesn't have a retractable roof these days. Like Minnesota. What the hell are they doing? It could snow in June there and you've got an open air stadium?
Brewers,39l66l,CJL13,6,Sat Jun 13 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think location of the stadium has something to do with it too.  Look at some of the other teams that don't pull that great of attendance, some of those stadiums are not in great locations.  MP is easily accessible."
Brewers,39l66l,allonbacuth,7,Fri Jun 12 19:09:10 2015 UTC,People like to drink at Miller Park.
Brewers,39l66l,burts_beads,2,Fri Jun 12 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee has always been a great baseball city, even dating back to the record breaking attendance runs in the 1950's. I'm living in Phoenix now, so I can't attend the games, but I hope the next 5 years doesn't come with diminishing attendance. I mean, if they're still drawing in the top 10 THIS season, I don't see a huge dip, but I REALLY hope that the fan support means something to Mark and the rest of the brewmeisters. Perhaps meaning something to them so much that they want to make Milwaukee a contender for a few years in a row. Ah, that'd be cool. Then again, they might think they don't have to, seeing as how they do so well anyway."
Brewers,39l66l,quickstop_rstvideo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"I guess from what other people mentioned, the brewers do a lot of giveaways and ticket opportunities that other teams don't do.  As long as they don't play a broiling period of horrible baseball I think they will be fine."

I didn't realize you were the smallest market but then again nobody seems to know that STL is a small market and are pissed they got an extra draft pick for being one of the 10 smallest markets.  EDIT: And I don't want this to seem like a smug bragging post, I don't even live in STL. I'm just a fan."

Brewers,39ms5e,theamazingkiwi,4,Sat Jun 13 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"I'll take 76 pitches through 3 innings, holy shit."
Brewers,39ms5e,Valleyoan,3,Sat Jun 13 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'm watching the Nationals' broadcast (not by choice) and while Zimmerman has 76 pitches through 3 innings, they still for whatever reason feel the need to point out that Fiers has 18.0 pitches per inning, most in MLB. At least he doesn't have 76 pitches by the 4th inning..And only 2 hits compared to Zimmerman's 6. Nice start against a good team, so far."
Brewers,39ms5e,Redtitwhore,3,Sat Jun 13 01:19:17 2015 UTC,Still 2 more games in the series.  Let's bleed their bullpen.

Brewers,39nv12,yusuf69,2,Sat Jun 13 02:28:00 2015 UTC,Id go with number 4. Dunno if it shows up the same on your device. But number 4 is the all blue ball and glove logo with the yellow outline.
Brewers,39nv12,Amoney8612,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"God I hope it shows up the same for everyone. I've got this on all the subreddits I'm still missing hats for.  From your description it seems they are the same though.  I think that one is definitely the best logo, never been too crazy about the white M"
Brewers,39nv12,Amoney8612,3,Sat Jun 13 02:38:04 2015 UTC,Best logo in all of sports.   Off topic... But what I don't like for MLB hats... Are the hats that are neon green and pink. Or baby blue and purple. Not a fan at all.
Brewers,39nv12,Valleyoan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:42:51 2015 UTC,Oh man remember those late-90's neon-green jerseys/hats they did for every team. Gross.
Brewers,39nv12,gobrewcrew,2,Sat Jun 13 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"The retro ball and glove (it's my number four as well), absolutely. The current M is fine by me and I think most other fans, but the ball and glove will always be the best."
Brewers,39nv12,silentjay01,2,Sat Jun 13 03:44:55 2015 UTC,"As long as its the classic Ball & Glove logo, Im okay with whatever.  But, if I had to choose, I'd say #'s 1,4 or 8 would be fine.  4 is probably best since it seems you are trying to do all single colored hats."
Brewers,39nv12,allonbacuth,2,Sat Jun 13 08:22:05 2015 UTC,"I am in agreement with everyone else it seems like. Ball and glove no question, I think I prefer #1 to #4, but its a horse a piece really."

Brewers,39jbq5,brewcrew2_2,2,Fri Jun 12 03:10:06 2015 UTC,KRod 13/13 in save attempts this season. I feel bad for getting nervous every time he comes in to pitch.
Brewers,39jbq5,BrewCityChaser,2,Fri Jun 12 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, I got nervous when Axford came in in 2011."
Brewers,39jbq5,CJL13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:26:29 2015 UTC,I feel bad we've only gotten him 13 attempts.
Brewers,39jbq5,ccruner13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:32:39 2015 UTC,It's probably a good thing he's had so few attempts so far given his propensity to give up the long ball. The less homeruns he gives up this year the more desirable he becomes on the trade market.
Brewers,39jbq5,Gritsandgravy1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  But is it better to be 13/13 or like 25/27 or something?  I also wonder if his nonsave situation blunders were 'inevitable' or if he would have even better overall numbers if those tie games were save situations.  Plus, if we had lots of save opportunities/converted saves it would probably mean the Brewers wouldn't be fighting to not be worst team in baseball...."
Brewers,39jbq5,ccruner13,2,Fri Jun 12 14:55:55 2015 UTC,I am loving this bullpen right now. Buyers step right up!

Brewers,39grqq,domspart,3,Thu Jun 11 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"I hope we keep him, but I'd trade him for some solid pitching"
Brewers,39grqq,pfitz6,5,Thu Jun 11 17:01:29 2015 UTC,said every brewers fan every year.
Brewers,39grqq,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu Jun 11 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"A couple good prospects. He's good, but we're selling out this year.  He's been average. He struggled last year, but it was understandable because he lost a child, so I don't think his mind was right most of the year. His numbers are back up this year.  He was an all-star a couple years ago. His defense is great. I like him a lot."
Brewers,39grqq,SolidRambo,3,Thu Jun 11 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"Would our top LHP prospect (disregarding Noah Syndergaard) Steven Matz be enough to get this done? Check his numbers, he is destroying AAA in Las Vegas too nonetheless"
Brewers,39grqq,BrewCrewKevin,4,Thu Jun 11 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"Holy.. yeah.   I like Segura a lot, but we're/you're going to find out if he can repeat his 2013 success where he was brilliant or if he's just a little bit above average. It's hard to evaluate him last year because, yeah, lost his child. He's playing better this year than last, but still not quite as well as in 2013. I think he'll continue to improve though and should remain a good everyday player for some time to come.  In the mean time, we'll trade you Kyle Lohse for that half eaten hot dog over there."
Brewers,39grqq,nutty15,3,Thu Jun 11 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"probably 1 more lower level prspect too but yeah, we need starters."
Brewers,39grqq,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:11:00 2015 UTC,Yes please
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"Matz is a guy the Mets would throw in I think for a guy like Braun (along with a whole heck of a lot of Brewer money).  Matz could do it alone, but Segura has a lot of risk in his profile.  He has not performed this well at all, and is only on pace for 1.2 WAR.  His value lies in cost control.  Matz is a top prospect, the Brewers would have to contribute something big in order to get him."
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,-6,Thu Jun 11 21:19:32 2015 UTC,No unproven pitching prospect from AAA is going to be traded straight up for an All-Star major league short stop.  Do you even baseball?  :P
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,2,Thu Jun 11 17:12:06 2015 UTC,/s? Look at the other responses to my question
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"I was just joking about the ""do you even baseball"" of course but I'm not being sarcastic.  I see the other responses.  The top rated commentor seems to agree.  The Brewers will keep him unless they get 2-3 prospects out of it.  It doesn't have to be starters, we're perfectly fine trotting rookies out there as the team is obviously rebuilding. That's why they gave Counsell a 3-year deal right away.  I think they finally figured it out, even though it's a couple years in the making at this point.  EDIT: They're also only paying him $500k this year.  He's eligible for arbitration next year so it makes sense to see what he does with the rest of this season before making a decision."
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,2,Thu Jun 11 17:21:10 2015 UTC,Steven Matz is the 33rd ranked prospect in baseball and the Mets 2nd prospects. The quality of the prospects in a trade is so much more important than the quantity.
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,2,Thu Jun 11 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you, teams do not trade starting major league short stops for a single pitching prospect unless MAYBE he was a top 5 prospect in baseball or unless the SS has shit defense.  A defensive shortstop as good as Segura is valuable, even if he can't hit, which Segura can.    The Mets already had a deal on the table for a shortstop trade this past offseason and they didn't take it.  And it was gong to cost them A LOT more than we're talking about here for a worse player.  Reportedly a pair of top prospects, including right-hander Noah Syndergaard for Ian Desmond.  Ian Desmond is a free agent after this year, is 4 years older than Segura, his fielding percentage is lower, he makes more errors, has a ton more strikeouts, similar batting average, 1 all-star game each.  I know the Mets didn't take the deal but that is what was offered to them.  Two top prospects including the one OP pulled off the table straight away for shortstop who isn't as good or as young as Jean Segura.    EDIT: Oh, and Ian Desmond is making 20x what Segura is this year."
Brewers,39grqq,smiles134,2,Thu Jun 11 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it would be just him, but the Brewers would be doing very well to get Matz and a lower level prospect for Segura. I meant more that the deal should be centered around Matz with ""fillers"" rather than 3 prospects from 15-25 in their organization. Segura has shown some very concerning traits going forward and has already turned down extension talks with the Brewers.   I don't really understand the point of the second paragraph either. I understand the importance of the SS position but this only shows the Nats were being unrealistic with an offer for Desmond and the Mets turned it down. That doesn't really show the value or Desmond vs Segura. Teams make unrealistic offers all the time that don't represent what they would actually get in the trade market."
Brewers,39grqq,itzjamesftw,2,Thu Jun 11 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Well, OP asked if just Matz would be enough and that's what I replied to so i doesn't matter if that's what you were saying or not.  I never refuted that the Brewers would trade Segura for Matz AND 1 or 2 OTHER PROSPECTS.  OP asked if Matz was enough, I said I didn't think so and I explained why and I continue to stand by it because I think I'm absolutely correct.  And everyone replying keeps saying I'm wrong and then concedes that it would take another 1 or 2 lower level prospects.  We're saying the same thing...  I realize that the Ian Desmond example doesn't mean that's what a shortstop like Desmond is worth, I'm just saying the Nats sure didn't offer them Desmond for Matz straight up.  Their best offer required the Mets to give up nearly 3x that, including a guy with 5 years of minor league experience who was ready to make the leap into the Big Leagues (Noah Syndergaard)."
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,2,Thu Jun 11 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Segura made the all-star team once. Matz has a ton of potential, and yeah, we'll probably need a lower prospect in the deal, as well, but there's no reason to say that Segura for Matz wouldn't happen. That would be a great trade for the Brewers."
Brewers,39grqq,itzjamesftw,2,Thu Jun 11 17:29:19 2015 UTC,Big difference between unproven prospect and top 50 prospect.  Steven Matz gets the trade done in a heartbeat.
Brewers,39grqq,legit_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"Straight up, Segura for Matz?"
Brewers,39grqq,itzjamesftw,3,Fri Jun 12 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"The Brewers say yes so fast it's not even funny.  Matz has ace potential, and add the fact he's a lefty makes him even more sought after.  No way the Mets would part with Matz for Segura.  I doubt they'd part with Matz for Gomez."
Brewers,39grqq,SuddenRedScare,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Segura is a proven starter in the majors and is still under club control. This is something I think you guys are overlooking. It's been mentioned before, but even after arbitration he won't be making more than a few million for a few years. He's a talented young player and with his contract status in mind I think he's very valuable. A high end prospect and another decent prospect with some potential wouldn't be out of the question IMO."
Brewers,39grqq,madman86,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:33:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, Segura has a lot of value, it's just a matter of if he is not in the long term plan capitalizing when his value is at his highest.  If you get another season of 2014 Segura (albeit his hardships) you lose out on what could be a good return.  So it's kind of weighing when you pull the trigger.  The Brewers won't just trade him to trade him, they will get as much value as they can. Maybe that is now, maybe it's not.  But if the Mets are willing to overpay then you do it."
Brewers,39grqq,brewcrew2_2,0,Fri Jun 12 09:23:37 2015 UTC,You're wrong.
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,3,Sun Jun 14 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"Plus, we have Sardinas who looks like he is just about ready to come up and play. He definitely held his own while filling in."
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"Our biggest needs are left-handed starters (or starters in general), third base, and left-handed power.  Any trade discussion with the Mets would begin with Matz I'd imagine.  Mets have Conforto as a good left-handed power outfielder which the Brewers would also want in there but the Mets I'm sure would say that is asking too much.  So Matz and Conforto for Segura.  Or Matz and Duda for Segura.  Neither is going to happen but that's what Melvin will be asking for."
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we may have seen his ceiling already. In 2013 he was an above average hitter, 44 steals, very good defense and posted a 3.5 WAR but he hasn't been able to match that production since. He lacks power and doesn't walk which hurts him offensively but he's alway been a solid defender and can steal bases. He's still young and cheap but he is arb eligible next year and not the SS of the future so I think selling him is very realistic with a solid return."
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"What makes him not the SS of the future?  This season amongst all Major League short stops he currently ranks:  6th in Batting Average  9th in On Base Percentage  4th in Stolen Bases  16th in Runs  12th in Home Runs  I must admit, he hasn't fielded as well as normal this year so far but we all know he is excellent defensively.  I'm not sure what more you're looking for?"
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,2,Thu Jun 11 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"Orlando Arcia is going to take over the position at some point in the next two seasons and that is all but set in stone. Segura has refused an extension already and the Brewers will be left with three years of his service after this season. They obviously don't need to trade him, but a change of position is going to come at some point and he will want to play SS/be paid SS money. No one is going to argue that Segura isn't a good player but the Brewers can very easily cash in at some point and still be secure at the position for years to come."
Brewers,39grqq,02bluesuperroo,3,Thu Jun 11 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"Orlando Arcia isn't going to be in the big leagues until at least 2017, maybe 2018 IMO.  He hasn't even sniffed AAA yet and was in A ball last year.  He's also 20 years old and on average guys are more like 22-23 when they make it to the MLB."
Brewers,39grqq,smiles134,3,Thu Jun 11 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"That could be true, but he also isn't an average player. .834 OPS in AA from someone who was widely considered a glove first guy has forced people to look at him as a legit top 25 prospect in all of baseball. I wouldn't be surprised if he were up next year at some point unless he hits a big bump in the road."
Brewers,39grqq,brewcrew2_2,3,Thu Jun 11 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if he keeps hitting he might get fast tracked.  I agree with you there.  AA pitching is quite inferior to AAA though."
Brewers,39grqq,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:49:07 2015 UTC,I'm still hoping they move Arcia to 3rd.
Brewers,39grqq,itzjamesftw,2,Thu Jun 11 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"Arcia is likely gonna be a better fielder than Segura is.  Segura is more likely destined for 2B if he stays with the Crew, but they may put him at third if we can't find anyone else or Gennett/Sardinas takes over the 2B spot."
Brewers,39grqq,sjm1541,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. Riveria or Sardinas will move to third, then"
Brewers,39h2d0,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is, most teams still using a designated DH have much better options, and others are seeing that using alternating DH's (like how the NL teams often use them in AL parks) has the advantage of giving a player a day of rest without completely taking them out.  At this point I just dont see much of a use for Rami unless his bat can heat up.  hes looked a bit better the  last few days iirc, but bleh...i just cant imagine a team giving us anything for him."
Brewers,39fula,ksprzk,13,Thu Jun 11 13:07:39 2015 UTC,"It'd make sense to keep em around for a bit longer, if for no other reason than attendance, and to try to squeeze as much out of the other teams through negotiations as possible.  That being said, if they get an offer they cant refuse, theres no reason they couldnt trade now, especially to prevent the risk of an injury ruining the deal."
Brewers,39fula,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, teams might be willing to part with a little bit more if they can acquire someone a few weeks earlier, especially if they are in a pennant race."
Brewers,39fula,dusters,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:02:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, and thats where the 'offer they cant refuse' comes in.  Usually it seems those big deals come in right close to the trade deadline, though."
Brewers,39fula,necropaw,5,Fri Jun 12 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"I think it will be closer to the deadline. This allows more of our players to boost their stock and get us more prospects out of them. Plus, it will help us win a few games so that our record isn't historically bad and keep attendance up for a bit longer."
Brewers,39fula,Kobe_AYEEEEE,5,Thu Jun 11 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought it would've started by now. But I also thought Melvin would be gone two weeks ago.  FWIW, apparently the Mets and Brewers have opened trade talks, with the Mets looking at position players. I think they're inquiring about Rami."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,3,Thu Jun 11 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"Sports talk yesterday was rumoring a Mets trade including Segura. Which I thought was weird, because he's only a 500k salary right now. Arbitration next year still won't get him more than 2-3 million.  But I think Melvin and Co. are probably thinking Sardinas is a good backu p, and is even younger. So right now would be the time to trade Segura for more prospects, and Segura can start practicing up to be the franchise SS when we decide to be good again in a couple years."
Brewers,39fula,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"do you mean 2-3 million, not thousand?"
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:55:18 2015 UTC,Eyep
Brewers,39fula,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu Jun 11 16:20:55 2015 UTC,What makes you think arbitration hearings wont go in Segura favor? I think he'll ask for more than 3mil and be rewarded right around that
Brewers,39fula,Valleyoan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:46:47 2015 UTC,Isnt that the brewers move. Servicable SS? Ship him awayfor the young guy in Nashvile/Colorado Springs
Brewers,39fula,tyranic_nero,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, pretty much. They are just an ""Average SS Factory""."
Brewers,39fula,BrewCrewKevin,0,Thu Jun 11 20:15:58 2015 UTC,But I think Melvin and Co. are probably thinking Sardinas is a good backup   Yeah no.  Sardinas was sent back to AAA when they called up Jungmann.
Brewers,39fula,IrkenInvaderGir,2,Thu Jun 11 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"Because they had to move someone, not because he wasn't good enough. Hernan Perez and Hector Gomez can play second and they were out of options. We needed another outfielder, so they couldn't send Peterson down. They could've sent Goforth down like they did today when they brought Scooter up, but then Sardinas would've gone down today instead."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Sardinas couldn't be a solid SS, but he's just not ready. If Segura gets dealt, then yeah, he's probably it."
Brewers,39fula,IrkenInvaderGir,2,Thu Jun 11 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"According to Ken Rosenthal, those talks lost traction.  The Mets were looking to move Jon Niese, and the Brewers weren't interested I guess."
Brewers,39fula,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Jun 11 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"Good call, no reason for Niese right now"
Brewers,39fula,theamazingkiwi,-1,Thu Jun 11 23:42:44 2015 UTC,IMO they can just have him
Brewers,39fula,nickateen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:46:16 2015 UTC,Who realistically do you think they are trying to unload? GoGo? Krod? Garza? Rammy?
Brewers,39fula,the_bum_on_the_bus,2,Thu Jun 11 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"Rami, Gomez, Braun, Lohse, Garza, K-Rod, Lind, maybe Lucroy, maybe Segura, maybe Parra, Broxton if we can somehow. I could see them trading Smith, too."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,-5,Thu Jun 11 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"This kind of thinking is just stupid, why would we trade away our entire team for a bunch of prospects and B-listers. So the best car scenario is we become some middling team?"
Brewers,39fula,colesitzy,5,Thu Jun 11 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Really?  Seriously?  Okay, let's look at this.  Rami's on his last season. No matter what way you look at it, we're going to need to replace him at third next year. Might as well trade him when we're on a lost season and get some sort of value for him.  Gomez is under contract for next year, but after that he's going to be looking to sign a huge long term deal that the Brewers cannot afford. Trade him now and we'll rake in high caliber prospects. Or, hold onto him for next year and get nothing.  Braun is contract for 4 years after this season. He's a talented outfielder with a good bat. His positive drug test and what came after make him a little less trade friendly, but the Brewers could get a good deal if they hold out for enough. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't trade Braun for two or three years, but it really depends on how well he plays.  Lohse. This one is a no brainer. Well past his prime and not under contract for next year. Unfortunately, Brewers won't get much for him unless he throws like back to back no-hitters before the trade deadline.  Garza. Under contract for another two years, and though it's a pretty big contract and he hasn't really earned it yet, I could see a team looking for a middle of the rotation starter to make a playoff push selling a few prospects for him. Probably not a top 50 prospect by any means, but it'll clear some money off the table.  K-Rod - under contract for next year and a team needing a closer or a setup man for a playoff push would be willing to give up a few mid-tier prospects or maybe 1 high caliber guy.  Lind is only under contract for the rest of this season and the Brewers aren't likely to re-sign him. I could see this being a very valuable trade for a team who needs a big bat.  Maybe Lucroy because he'd have the highest return besides Gomez, but he's on a team friendly deal and is a fan favorite so I would be pretty surprised if they move him. He's young enough to believe he'll be a part of the Brewers rebuilt team. You can structure an offense around him, I think.  Maybe Segura because we have three solid infield prospects besides him right now and he'd yield a high return. But he's also young and on a team friendly deal.  Maybe Parra because if we don't move Braun or Khris Davis (and I don't think we will move Davis), Parra is only under contract for this year and I could see a team needing outfield depth or defense selling for him.  Broxton because he's awful and has a huge contract but some team might be dumb enough to trade for him (like the Brewers did last year).  Smith is a dark horse but he'd yield enough if the Brewers are smart about it.  Look at our team, man. The future isn't bright right now. We need to sell what we can and rebuild so that we don't become a mid-to-below-average team forever."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that if we trade away starting pitchers, we will have a bunch of young guys coming up to fill in. That makes Lucroy even more valuable IMO. He will help those young guys a LOT and that can have a huge impact on young pitchers (getting rattled young may make them lose confidence). I think they would have to get an insane trade offer to deal Lucroy at this point.  I think Garza is more tradable than Loshe at this point. He has playoff experience and seems to have figured out whatever it was the past few years that has made him under perform. His last few starts have been solid.   I really feel like Smith could be a closer so I'd hate to see him go. Blazek can takes Smith's current role, as he has proven he can be a shut down guy."
Brewers,39fula,madman86,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like Jeffress will be a better closer than Smith, but Smith is a great setup guy"
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Jeffress is good, but Smith is lights out. Actually, Smith projects to be one of the better relievers in the bigs this year."
Brewers,39fula,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"Isn't Jeffress older than Smith though? Not that it matters, but if we had to keep one, I'd rather keep Smith I think. Plus, he's a lefty. Not too many lefty closers that can bring it like he can."
Brewers,39fula,madman86,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like a year and some change. I've just felt like Jeffress' stuff is better than Will's."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,0,Fri Jun 12 14:23:52 2015 UTC,We have been a mid-to-below-average team for the 26 years I've been alive. Until we get an owner and a manager that are willing to do what it takes to win they're going to stay that way.
Brewers,39fula,cheezturds,6,Thu Jun 11 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"Since 2007 the Brewers have been within a game of the playoffs at some point in September 5 times. As tough as it is to make the playoffs, that's a pretty impressive run for a small market team. When Attanasio took over in '05 the Brewers opening day payroll was $40 million. It's been over $80 million for seven years running and over $100 for the last two. Obviously Melvin and Attanasio haven't had a perfect tenure, but they've done a lot to make the Brewers a respectable organization.   Anyways, most of those guys won't be on the team in two years anyways so it only makes sense to trade them."
Brewers,39fula,sjm1541,3,Thu Jun 11 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"To me it's not that he's increased the payroll, I mean that's great. But they seem to not spend it very wisely. There's a good amount of guys on this team that are overpaid. Not being able to grow any pitching talent at all and then gutting the farm for guys they can't keep doesn't help either. I agree if we aren't gonna keep them then at least getting something for them, but it sucks having to get rid of nice things."
Brewers,39fula,cheezturds,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"That's the price you pay for Free Agents, knowing that the back end of the deal will be an overpay, it works like that for a lot of teams."
Brewers,39fula,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the spirit."
Brewers,39fula,smiles134,5,Thu Jun 11 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"You sell them off for prospects that look damn good and have a good chance of being stars in a few years.  If you can get say, 2 of those types of players for each player you trade away (on average), you strengthen the future by selling off the present.    It happens a ton in baseball.  Shit, look at the Cubs/Astros.  They traded away good players a few years back, had a few horrible seasons to get better draft picks, and now that those players are in the majors, they look like pretty good teams, and theyre only improving."
Brewers,39fula,necropaw,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Probably won't be until the start of July. Think back to some of the major recent trades, like Price, Sabathia, Samardzija and Greinke. Didn't happen until July.   This is likely because most teams are figuring out whether or not they truly have a shot to get into the playoffs and where they have had weaknesses all season. The beginning of June we're only about 60 games in. You hit roughly around 100 games by the All Star break and are better position to make decisions about your competitiveness and weaknesses (and you're getting very close to the trade deadline, so you have to pull the trigger). I'm sure there are other reasons as well.  From a statistical perspective, it's comparable to finding the best fitting statistical model; the one with the most explained variance is going to best evaluate your theory (i.e.- we are x level competitive, or, gaining y player will improve us by z), which you (usually) get by having a larger sample size.  Of course I'm sure the Brewers are willing to move people sooner than competitive teams and they very well could if a hungry team REALLY wants a particular player, but I wouldn't count on a fire sale for a few more weeks."
Brewers,39fula,SolidRambo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:45:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if Melvin has already been in some serious discussions.  It just takes a little more pressure from the deadline to force the hand sometimes.
Brewers,39fula,Schlitz001,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:25:13 2015 UTC,Honestly they have shown some life by winning 2 road series against decent teams but we're still pretty far behind in the division. I would expect to see some faces leave and maybe some new faces on the field next month.

Brewers,39fula,daftparagon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:54:28 2015 UTC,I feel like with several of our pieces we'd like to wait a while to see if they can't turn things around and up their trade value a bit.
Brewers,39fula,wegottops,0,Fri Jun 12 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"After the All Star game. Get one or two guys voted into the game? Boom, now instead of trading an above average player in Milwaukee - you can market it as an All Star caliber player to build depth and more marketing possibilities. Teams that are in a division race will eat that up. Actually, every year they do."
Brewers,39fula,b-VW,2,Thu Jun 11 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"We already can, can't we? Braun, Gomez, Lucroy, Segura, and K-Rod have all made appearances.  We're not going to get much this year. MAYBE Braun. He deserves it based on his stats, but he's currently 13th in OF voting. Nobody else is even in the top 5."
Brewers,39fula,BrewCrewKevin,0,Thu Jun 11 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my point. Past All Stars carry some weight. The ability to say they were possibly, maybe a 2015 All Star during a 22-38 season means something too."
Brewers,39fula,b-VW,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"We won't get anyone voted in. The closest is Braun and he's like 9th or 11th or something like that. No, Braun will get in as a reserve."

As far as i remember all the prices were pretty much the same ($5.50ish a beer?). I will be drinking plenty of beer in the parking lot beforehand, and i want to get as much food and beer as possible for the smallest amount of money when i get inside."
Brewers,39iw1g,Necatorducis,3,Fri Jun 12 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"I think a beer is now like 6.50 small 8.50 large for 'craft', little less for piss water.  Food ranges from 4-20, most of it from the kiosks is around 5-8 I'd say, the restaurants will be a little more.  $20-30 should be enough to keep your buzz going through the game and still have enough to munch on something.  Prices, overall, are still cheaper than you'd expect for a stadium."
Brewers,39iw1g,Nashwaukee,3,Fri Jun 12 03:32:39 2015 UTC,A.J. Bombers Game Day Combo! $10 for a nice burger w/ fixings and an order of tots. That's a pretty good deal to me!

Brewers,39g6hl,jmeks23,2,Thu Jun 11 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"But they needed to move someone to bring up Jungmann, and they couldn't move down Perez or Hector."
Brewers,39g6hl,smiles134,0,Thu Jun 11 18:29:47 2015 UTC,He's hurting the rest of our young players by even existing on the roster. They need to option him asap.

Brewers,39g6hl,smiles134,0,Thu Jun 11 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"So what? Every AL team passed on him when they had the chance. And if any NL team is going to make a move at him, by all means, please do."
Brewers,39g6hl,Valleyoan,2,Thu Jun 11 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Thank you. I've been saying this since we grabbed him. It makes no sense. He had a lot of potential at one point, but it really doesn't seem like it's going to pan out. I felt like no one agreed with me."

Brewers,39brfx,SoSublim3,7,Wed Jun 10 18:15:32 2015 UTC,This would not happen but would be cool if David Lucroy was able to pitch to his brother in the bigs. Not going to happen but a cool thought.
Brewers,39brfx,TheGobler,2,Wed Jun 10 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"as someone not familiar, why do you say this won't happen? Too young? not good enough? lucroy to be traded?"
Brewers,39brfx,EthyleneGlycol,6,Wed Jun 10 19:21:22 2015 UTC,Because he's not very good.  Often teams will draft players related to someone on the team or in the front office in the later rounds.  A lot of those picks are organizational depth in the first place so it's a nice little feel good when they draft a relative.  I believe the Brewers drafted Ron Roenicke's nephew a few years ago.  Another user mentioned Ryan Braun's little brother.  The Braves drafted their GM's son (who now happens to be on the Brewers).
Brewers,39brfx,BrewCrewKevin,4,Wed Jun 10 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"Right.   organizational depth   Yes. To put it another way, they don't care who they pick, as they are all okay players, but not huge prospects. And at a certain point in the later rounds of the draft, it becomes less about having a winning team and the best players, and more about getting recognizeable names that will sell tickets at the lower MiLB teams.  So the thought is- even if he's not that good, he'll get a lot of publicity because of Jonathan. People will be at games going ""Hey, here he comes, Luc's little brother!"" and he'll get his name out there.  Again, same thing with RR's son a couple years ago. He was never good, but it a) shows loyalty to the current staff/players (not unlike hiring relatives for summer help in a plant), and b) gives people a name they recognize when watching A ball."
Brewers,39brfx,stingem3929,2,Wed Jun 10 21:15:57 2015 UTC,Kyle Wren (son of former Braves GM) was also drafted in the 8th round. I wouldn't say it happened because his dad was GM. It was a good pick in general in a round that still had top talent on the board.
Brewers,39brfx,TheGobler,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:19:07 2015 UTC,I knew about Roenicke and Melvin but wasn't aware of Braun and Lucroy.   Guess that's why they have 4 tiers of MiLB and college leagues though.
Brewers,39brfx,Valleyoan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"I believe the DOdgers did something similar in the 62nd round in 1988, they drafted some guy as a family favor.. I think his name was something like Pizza? Ya that was it, Mike Pizza. lol"
Brewers,39brfx,jn2010,6,Thu Jun 11 03:11:34 2015 UTC,Braun's little brother played for the Timber Rattlers.  He still might.

Brewers,39b9ui,necropaw,3,Wed Jun 10 21:45:40 2015 UTC,Anyone after the 20th round is pretty rare.  Most high schoolers picked 20+ don't sign and the college players are usually picked just to fill up lower level minor league rosters.  I'd say one player picked 20+ from each team in each draft will make it to Triple-A or higher.

Brewers,398o1t,ShoopALoop11,6,Wed Jun 10 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"7 I.P., 3H, 5 K, 1 ER, 1 BB. He works in the low 90s, but he touched 94 a couple times. He's really your basic sinker baller, when he locates his stuff well he's gonna be hard to hit, and he's gonna generate a lot of groundballs. Only had one mistake hanging a breaking ball, belt high, to Marte which he didn't miss and landed in the left field bleachers. He mixed up his stuff well and you could tell the batters were having a hard time picking up his stuff which you can attribute to his unorthodox delivery. It also helps that many Pirates were making contact early in the count which makes his efficiency look better. He only lost a little bit of control in the 2nd inning, but I believe Luc calmed him down and really called a great game from then on. Overall he impressed me and it's got to be a monkey off his back getting out of the pitcher hell that is Colorado Springs. Should be more to come from this young man. With luck and experience he can develop into a very solid #3!"

Brewers,396unv,jwt0480,5,Tue Jun 9 17:59:55 2015 UTC,Really? Huh. Picking up Perez still seems to be dumb.
Brewers,396unv,smiles134,4,Tue Jun 9 18:05:25 2015 UTC,Sardinas will still be around and you're not using up his options by moving him around the rest of the year. Might as well give Perez a shot since his 21 steals and .735 OPS in AAA last year shows there could be something there. Worst case is that he fails and the Brewers can cut ties with him and risk losing him on waivers.
Brewers,396unv,sjm1541,2,Tue Jun 9 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that, I just didn't expect it.  Either way, I still would have rather had Herrera than Perez. Yes, I know Perez is younger and has a higher ceiling, I just really don't think he's going to pan out."
Brewers,396unv,smiles134,3,Tue Jun 9 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the point of keeping a 30 year old around on a team that's losing and is going to begin a rebuild within the month. He was decent enough in his utility role, but with Gennett, Segura, Sardinas, Perez and the minor league MI talent they have, the Brewers will always be able to fill the positions. Even if Perez is a longshot to turn into a valuable player I think the Brewers still have to take that risk."
Brewers,396unv,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, I feel like that's exactly the reason to keep a 30 year old around. The team is going no where, so he's not going to hurt their production at all. He can play all the infield positions plus is a decent outfield backup if we need it. Gennett needs to spend time in AAA and learn to hit lefties (if he ever will be able to), and we only dropped Herrera to pick up Perez."
Brewers,396unv,smiles134,3,Tue Jun 9 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"If the team is going no where then you take a risk on the 24 year old that costs you nothing to get. It's about building for the future and the possibility that Perez develops into a decent hitter. I honestly can't think of a single reason to keep Herrera over Perez at this point. Perez is younger, players three infield positions, he can defend and is a good baserunner and is just as cheap."
Brewers,396unv,sjm1541,2,Tue Jun 9 18:51:45 2015 UTC,Because when you know you are going to lose it is almost always a better idea to take a shot on a young player over an old player when they have similar production.

Brewers,396unv,dusters,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:00:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. Thought Perez would be off the big league roster instead of Sardiñas.
Brewers,396unv,The_Bostache,2,Tue Jun 9 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Well they said this was because Perez is out of options, so he'd need to clear waivers first before he could get sent down. But I'm pretty sure he'd clear waivers eventually."
Brewers,396unv,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:16:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd say it's a good chance he'd clear waivers but I guess that's a risk Melvin didn't want to take :(

Brewers,396y5r,smiles134,3,Tue Jun 9 18:41:14 2015 UTC,I can only guess that he was too risky of a pick to sign for whatever his asking price was.  Maybe Melvin struck a deal to pay him in Canadian dollars instead.

Brewers,3948p5,BarcaBadger,4,Tue Jun 9 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"Baseball America scouting report on Trent Clark:   Clark’s batting grip is a little unorthodox. He eschews batting gloves and he holds his thumbs on the bat like he’s gripping a golf club. It has always worked for him and few who have seen him doubt his ability to hit. One evaluator called him the best high school bat to come out of Texas in the past five years. He’s battled blisters and ankle problems but has still managed to impress this spring, thanks to excellent bat speed and a long track record of performing both on the showcase circuit and internationally. Clark has 70 speed on the 20-to-80 scouting scale at his best, and unlike most of the rest of top of the prep outfield class, Clark should remain in center field for the long-term. He gets good jumps to go with his excellent speed and he has plenty of arm for center. He’s already pretty well filled out physically. He projects as an above-average hitter with future average power. He has an excellent batting eye that allows him to draw walks. He could profile as a top-of-the-order table setter who can get on base and steal, but he has enough pop to end up in the middle of the lineup. Clark has impressed for years with his feel for the game, his leadership qualities and his knack for performing on the biggest stages. He’s committed to Texas Tech.   Keith Law's pre-draft thoughts:   Another very advanced hitter in the mold of Tucker, Clark isn't quite the same athlete and may have to move to left field, although his swing and approach are reminiscent of fellow Texas product and current Cubs farmhand Billy McKinney.   Kiley McDaniel pre-draft thoughts:   Clark is a bit of a tweener defensively and his swing is a little unorthodox, but he's done nothing but hit everywhere he's been. His supporters see a center fielder with plus raw power that's the best pure hitter in the draft.   MLB.com pre-draft thoughts:   Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55   Clark reinforced his reputation as one of the best prep hitters available with his performance at the 18-and-under Pan American Championship in Mexico in September. He led Team USA to a gold medal by topping the team in nearly every offensive category, hitting .565 with three homers, 20 RBIs and five steals in eight games.  Clark has an unusual left-handed swing with a golf-style grip, but he makes repeated hard contact with his short stroke and above-average bat speed. Factor in his considerable strength and he should have at least average power. He also adds value on the bases with his solid speed and keen instincts.  While he's not a true burner, Clark has a chance to stay in center field as a pro. Left field would be his likely fallback position and the Texas Tech commit should have enough bat to profile there if needed."

Brewers,3948p5,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:24:20 2015 UTC,He does seem to have a really tight grip on that bat... wow.
Brewers,3948p5,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:00:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that's kinda funky. It looks like his hands aren't together on the bat or something.  Kinda Hank Aaron-esque.
Brewers,3948p5,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:24:24 2015 UTC,So as somebody who hasn't ever really followed the MLB draft all that close... what happens since he's committed to Texas Tech?  Does he have the decision to either join the minors or turn down the offer and go to college? Or does his offer stand for after college?
Brewers,3948p5,sjm1541,5,Tue Jun 9 16:02:40 2015 UTC,If he turns the Brewers offer down he will enroll at Texas Tech and become eligible for the draft again after three years. Possibly two years for him because they do let you leave if you turn 21 by a certain time before your third year and I believe he's old for a senior. This means any team can draft him when he would leave college and the Brewers don't retain his right.  If he signs with the Brewers he is no longer eligible to play amateur baseball and will join the Brewers minor league club they feel he's best fit for.
Brewers,3948p5,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Jun 9 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"He will almost for sure sign. It's pretty rare for people to turn down million dollar offers. It becomes more common in the later rounds. Also, as part of his contract, the tuition/cost to attend Texas Tech will be included. Therefore, if he fails to make it, he should have money to still attend college after."
Brewers,3948p5,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"Rookie contracts can be that much? I was under the impression that the lower ends of MiLB make next to nothing... not a million for sure.  So he will pass on college, but get paid for his tuition and costs that he would have had??"
Brewers,3948p5,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"There is a signing bonus that drafted players get, those drafted in the first round will get multi million signing bonus offers"
Brewers,3948p5,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"The slot value for the 15th pick in this draft is about $2.7M, which is the signing bonus for that player. Each pick in the first 10 rounds is assigned a value, and any pick after the 10th is worth $100k. So teams have a pool to assign the money as they see fit. Since Clark is coming out of HS and has a commitment to Texas Tech, they may need to exceed the slot value to sign him. They'll have to sign other players under slot to make up for any extra assigned to him.  Their annual salary is where they make next to nothing. So they players need to be smart and invest the money in the event they don't ever make it to the majors. This is much easier said than done.  I believe the tuition portion is in addition to the contract signing bonus. The league scholarship plan has been around since the 1960s. It's a way to get kids to go pro if the money they would have been given in a scholarship (which there are not that many of in college baseball) is included in the professional contract."

He’s battled blisters and ankle problems but has still managed to impress this spring, thanks to excellent bat speed and a long track record of performing both on the showcase circuit and internationally. Clark has 70 speed on the 20-to-80 scouting scale at his best, and unlike most of the rest of top of the prep outfield class, Clark should remain in center field for the long-term. He gets good jumps to go with his excellent speed and he has plenty of arm for center. He’s already pretty well filled out physically. He projects as an above-average hitter with future average power. He has an excellent batting eye that allows him to draw walks. He could profile as a top-of-the-order table setter who can get on base and steal, but he has enough pop to end up in the middle of the lineup. Clark has impressed for years with his feel for the game, his leadership qualities and his knack for performing on the biggest stages. He’s committed to Texas Tech.  Scouting report from Keith Law, ESPN, who had him 10th on his draft board: Another very advanced hitter in the mold of Tucker, Clark isn't quite the same athlete and may have to move to left field, although his swing and approach are reminiscent of fellow Texas product and current Cubs farmhand Billy McKinney."
Brewers,393nx2,trainwreck00,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"That first sentence is the thing that took him off of my list.  A funkiness like that may work now, but once they hit AA and real big boy pitching, it can be exposed and exploited pretty easily.  Its a very risky pick in my opinion, but if he pans out its a big reward.    I was hoping they took Mike Nikorak."

I don't understand what the umps think will happen.  This is stupid."
Brewers,392jpd,jn2010,2,Tue Jun 9 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything major imminent, in fact the radar is thinning out."
Brewers,392jpd,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:58:20 2015 UTC,So why delay now?  It'll be a constant rain for a few hours at least.
Brewers,392jpd,jn2010,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will even last that long.  But if they didn't stop it before, I'm not sure why they'd do it now.  It's not getting any heavier, if anything it's weakening."
Brewers,392jpd,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:04:43 2015 UTC,The front is right over the city right now.  More showers will develop to the west so it'll last longer than it appears.  It won't get heavier but we're still looking at consistent rain for over an hour.
Brewers,392jpd,jn2010,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"You're right.  This is dumb either way.  Oh well, it looks like a win."
Brewers,392jpd,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:11:58 2015 UTC,Could the game get suspended until tomorrow?
Brewers,392jpd,adam7765,2,Tue Jun 9 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"Not at this point, it is a Brewers win if they decide not to finish the game tonight.  A game is only suspended if:   Fewer than 5 innings have been completed The game is tied The inning was tied to start and the road team takes the lead in the top half of the inning but rain restricts the home team from hitting in the bottom hat."

Brewers,392jpd,fly1ngorb,2,Tue Jun 9 01:55:02 2015 UTC,Just got a SportsCenter update that the game is now delayed again
Brewers,392jpd,Vetro777,2,Tue Jun 9 01:54:54 2015 UTC,I don't understand that.  It's a steady rain.  Why they chose to delay now is stupid.
Brewers,392jpd,jn2010,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:57:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like heavier stuff is coming in.  Also they probably wanted to give the home team a chance to tie/take the lead.

Brewers,392jpd,CJL13,4,Tue Jun 9 01:37:18 2015 UTC,I remember a softball game I played in.  It was raining similar to this.  I got a pitch and drove it into the dirt/mud right in front of the plate (I'm not very good) and I beat out the throw to 1st.  I buried it so deep into the ground that the catcher couldn't get it out.

Brewers,392jpd,CJL13,2,Tue Jun 9 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Because we're the Brewers.  No one in the order knows how to take pitches.

Brewers,3919y0,lurtcho,3,Mon Jun 8 14:55:16 2015 UTC,There's a fair amount of bars on Bluemound Road a short drive/walk for that matter north/northwest of the stadium. There's more fast food and sit down places to the south of the stadium on National Ave.  I guess it depends on what you want. If you're going with friends I THINK you have an hour after the final out to leave the parking lots. I'm not sure if thats the exact rule so maybe someone else can confirm that. Plenty of time to have another drink or two and maybe fire up the grill if you have an electric one.
Brewers,3919y0,MurDoct,2,Mon Jun 8 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"Correct- you have an hour after the game. They don't give much time, and they will start to shoo people out.  Your nearby suggestions are good.  If you are looking for really going out and enjoying the night-life, Water Street is the place to be."
Brewers,3919y0,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Jun 8 22:41:47 2015 UTC,Water Street looks cool. That's the kind of thing I was looking for   thanks
Brewers,3919y0,umphreak2x2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man, there a lot of cool things in and around the Downtown area.   1) Go to the Safe House, it's a bit touristy but if you haven't been there before it is worth going for at least an hour.   2) If you're hungry, go to the late night ramen at Ardent. It's offensive how good their ramen is, and it has gotten quite popular.   3) Riverwest and the Eastside have some pretty cool dive bars. I really like the Bremen Cafe (they will usually have live local bands on the weekend) or try Art Bar for something a little out of the ordinary.  Water street is pretty 'bro-ey' and girls going 'Wooooo!' on the weekends. If that is your scene, that that is the best place for you. If you like the more dive bar scene and drinking with the locals, try the Riverwest or Eastside bars. Have fun man whatever you decide to do."
Brewers,38yzmf,zjl3,4,Mon Jun 8 01:06:22 2015 UTC,"Once upon a time, the Brewers were good at drafting and trading for talent.  That ended when Jack Zduriencik became Seattle's GM.  Things haven't been the same since."

Now our farm system is one of the worst, if not the worst, in the majors, and our FO hasn't shown the ability to draft well without Jack Z. So we're kind of fucked for the foreseeable future."

Why the fuck did we send him down? (I know needed an OF cause brauns thumb and we just had to grab Hernan Perez who probably wont ever hit above 200 in his career) But seriously, why.   Hopefully Jungmann has a good game and proves Colorado Springs/PCL is just baseball hell for pitchers. Then they keep both Jungmann and Cravy up."

Brewers,38wxmw,ChrisWebersTimeout,2,Mon Jun 8 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, Rami could be a good trade-deadline division push for some team. And he's a veteran who makes a lot, so we would probably get quite a bit in return.  Segura currently gets about 500k. He's arb. eligible next year, so that will go up some, but he's a mid-level SS. I don't see him getting more than 2-3 million. And he's young. He's the kind of guy you want to keep around. Obviously depends on the offer though. If you get 2 or 3 decent prospects, I'd be okay with it I guess."
Brewers,38wxmw,BrewCrewKevin,6,Mon Jun 8 14:55:54 2015 UTC,Ramirez would be logical move for the crew if he's willing Segura would be a tougher pill to swollow.
Brewers,38wxmw,orange_lazarus1,5,Sun Jun 7 15:28:46 2015 UTC,Wouldn't bother me. I see the upsides. Ship em both.
Brewers,38wxmw,muffin_man84,4,Sun Jun 7 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda stuck on Segura..he was originally a second basemen, he's hitting well again this year. Scooter is not the answer long term at second, why not move him to second, have Sardinas or Rivera play short, and Arcia move to third?"
Brewers,38wxmw,jubjub2184,2,Sun Jun 7 21:00:48 2015 UTC,Arcia has the best glove of that group.  He isn't moving off SS.
Brewers,38wxmw,SuddenRedScare,8,Mon Jun 8 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"This would be a great trade, depending on the return of course. I don't think the Brewers will be competitive next year, so losing Segura is not a big concern. They can fill SS with Sardinas and then call up Orlando Arcia when he is ready, some time next year."
Brewers,38wxmw,BarcaBadger,10,Sun Jun 7 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"It's insane to me how you guys want to hold onto Segura even though it's clear the Brewers are starting a rebuild.  I like the guy, but we're eventually going to have to pay him or hit his arby years."
Brewers,38wxmw,itzjamesftw,7,Sun Jun 7 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"he only 25 playing a position the brewers have struggled with for most of the 2000's. if we can sign him to a club friendly contract, why not?"
Brewers,38wxmw,sdogg,5,Sun Jun 7 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Because there is no need for him.  Arcia is two years away and it doesn't make sense to tie up money on someone for a rebuild. Segura is not going to come cheap.  The Brewers will not and can not compete in their current form.  It's time to jump ship and wait 3 to 4 years until our team looks something like Reed, Roache, Lara, Coulter, Taylor, Arcia.  Hopefully through trades have locked down a young starters core and will probably still have Nelson, Lucroy, Braun."
Brewers,38wxmw,itzjamesftw,5,Sun Jun 7 23:04:19 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing they'd part with Segura before Arcia is ready.
Brewers,38wxmw,drunkmilkshake,7,Sun Jun 7 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"They aren't playing for anything this year, and even though he will only be 21, Arcia should be close to ready for 2016.  I don't think it's a bad idea to let Segura go, considering he is actually hitting again.  *Obviously we would need a good return from the Mets."
Brewers,38wxmw,Schlitz001,2,Sun Jun 7 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"Mets have quite a few promising pitching prospects, wouldn't mind acquiring some of that."
Brewers,38wxmw,ChrisWebersTimeout,2,Sun Jun 7 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"This year any player the Brewers trade would not surprise me. (the exception being Braun because of his huge contract.)   After the All-Star game, I am ready to spend the rest of the season rooting for the Milwaukee Sky Sox - featuring Ryan Braun."
Brewers,38wxmw,silentjay01,4,Sun Jun 7 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"How in the fuck would anyone want Ramirez at this point?  And we'd have to absolutely rape their farm system for Siggy i think.  Arcia is the future, but hes still a little ways off."
Brewers,38wxmw,necropaw,3,Sun Jun 7 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"What makes you think Arcia is a ways off? He's top 5 offensive production in AA right now. I think he either gets bumped to aaa or the majors this year. They should do it this year to give him a little taste and create that extra hunger.   One of Segura, Yadiel Rivera, Sardinas, Arcia is getting traded, and one of them is moving to 3rd base. I would say make it Arcia because he's a little bit shorter than Rivera, who is also slightly a better defender.   He's hitting the cover off the ball though. his time is quickly approaching.    Also, yes, anyone would have to be so incredibly dumb to take Aram. He is so bad."
Brewers,38wxmw,Valleyoan,3,Sun Jun 7 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"I guess 'way off' isnt quite right, but im not sure i'd want him to come up quite yet.  Some time in AAA probably wouldnt hurt him.  I could see it messing with a guys confidence to go from AA to the bigs, and going from hitting .325 to .200."
Brewers,38wxmw,necropaw,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"True, and it's really a pickle because AAA could inflate his head and stats even more and make his ML performance that much more of a come-down. I know he was really eager to try and make it by the Twins series, he wants to play against big brother. And beat him. Gotta love that."
Brewers,38wxmw,Valleyoan,2,Sun Jun 7 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"And in all honesty, it seems Boloxi has a better team than the Skysox right now. He may be better off just because of the energy of a winning team, and being able to play with more successful players.  It's weird. And maybe I don't have the whole picture, but AAA is REAALLY struggling. And AA is killing it."
Brewers,38wxmw,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Jun 8 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yea I've watched a lot of both teams and there's is definitely an entirely different dynamic to both of them. I completely understand keeping some guys away from AAA for now just to save their confidence and baby them. Also, our AAA squad looks pretty pedestrian compared to most the others. Not a lot of guys on the team that you look at and think, wow, that guy is a beast. Just a bunch of early 30s aaaa guys to fill the roster. I've joked a couple times they ought to just switch the entire rosters and see how it goes.   However, AAA does provide a much closer representation of what to expect in the majors. There's a ton more guys who have seen the show there. The hitters are far superior to aa and the pitchers have way better stuff overall. They travel wayyy more than aa, actually flying around the nation. Its definitely more of a grind."
Brewers,38wxmw,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:40:38 2015 UTC,"True. Between having  national travel, and being able to play in different time zones with jet-lag, and having a wealth of guys with MLB experience (whether it be September call-ups or temprorary stints), AAA is better experience. Just kinda funny how Col Springs is falling apart at the seams, but Boloxi is in 1st place after not having a home game yet. Pretty strange to me."
Brewers,38wxmw,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:00:39 2015 UTC,I don't think any of the four you listed would work at 3rd Base since teams usually try to put a power hitter there.  None of our SS prospects are know as Long Ball hitters.
Brewers,38wxmw,silentjay01,0,Sun Jun 7 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"A guy that can hit hr is not essential for 3rd base. I'd rather have a guy that can hit 300 w 5 hr a year than a guy that'll hit 240 w 20 hr. The latter may be more fun to watch but the better average guy will help the team win more games. Matt carpenter is one of the best 3rd baseman in all of baseball and he's got 33 hr in 4 years. I dont think the cards are doing too bad for not getting much power from their 3rd baseman. Granted, he's been hitting hr this year."
Brewers,38wxmw,Valleyoan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"The Cardinals may not be the best example for your argument as their 2B and SS are two of their top three HR hitters so far this year (Carpenter being the other). That means that 2B, SS, & 3B are providing the most power for them.    The Cards have 22 HRs from those three positions' starters in a little over 2 months this year.  We got 28 from Rami, Jean, and Weeks last YEAR - total."
Brewers,38wxmw,silentjay01,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"When I heard about Wright, I thought the Mets might be interested in Ramirez. I guess we'll see what comes of it"
Brewers,38wxmw,smiles134,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:52:12 2015 UTC,Only way I give up Segura is if we get Matz back otherwise I'll wait until the off season to deal him.
Brewers,38wxmw,ShoopALoop11,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on whether trading Segura is a good idea for the Brewers. The Padres are the most natural fit, but they probably want to hang onto the top prospects they have left after this winter.  Second most natural fit could be the Athletics. On one hand, they're probably out of it... on the other hand, Segura has well under 19 errors... the third hand is Billy Beane's wild ride."

My family had just moved from New Orleans back to WI after 3 years.  We lived with my Grandparents for a few months and my Grandpa helped me out with this.  This is probably what got me hooked on baseball.  And oddly enough we moved to Tosa on 62 street and for a brief period Paul Molitor live a few blocks over on 63 street."

Brewers,38v3f7,hrrsnmb,3,Sun Jun 7 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"Nope, in fact, his swings have looked like that since he is not trying to pull the ball as much in recent days. That type of approach is important to his game so that he can hit more in strike zone pitches effectively."
Brewers,38v3f7,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:39:46 2015 UTC,He could probably use a day off. I don't think he has had one in a while.

Brewers,38r6rk,Valleyoan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"I will say though, we have some speedy and talented guys in the middle infield.  Siggy can play an extra step towards Rami because of it, which helps.  Rami still makes that play coming in on a ball to get a speedy runner out pretty well, too.  I mean, this is his last year im sure, and im not 100% sure he makes it through the year.  Hes probably not worth what were paying him, either....but hes not dead weight."

Homebrewing sweet, carbonated cider is rough because you have to pasteurize the bottles at the right time, but now that i have a kegging system its a high priority of mine to make a good batch of sweet, carbonated cider.

Brewers,38gzwu,Adjective_Animal,5,Thu Jun 4 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"Iron horse is close and probably one of the hipper hotels in Milwaukee. If you want cheap go by the airport. The pfister is where the away teams stay. It's downtown and apparently haunted. Hope that helps! Also, I visited Citi for the one game we won in the series. I gotta say, awesome stadium and super nice fans. Though my brother who lives in NYC said most people there don't really care so we can call them ""fans"". Regardless, welcome!"
Brewers,38gzwu,ksprzk,2,Thu Jun 4 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the help!  And I would definitely say since Citi opened there are definitely more people there to just check out the ""pretty stadium"" than there were when Shea was around.  Shea had a fan atmosphere that Citi will just never match.  However, us Mets fans are a passionate (and miserable) bunch and if you sit in the right section, you'll be surrounded by some crazy fans."
Brewers,38gzwu,ghobber,3,Thu Jun 4 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"Not much in the immediate vicinity of Miller Park.  There's the Woods View BW but it's a hole, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    Stay downtown at the Aloft or intercontinental in the Water St./ Old World 3rd/ River area if you're looking for post game bars and such.  Even if you aren't , plenty of downtown options.  I'm w the other poster if your looking to go a bit cheaper try to airport area, Brookfield can be pricey too.  Went to Citi last year for the 1st time and loved it! !"
Brewers,38gzwu,MiltownKBs,2,Thu Jun 4 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"Hey Man.  Have fun in Milwaukee!  Others have suggested spots to stay.  I would suggest taking a look at some of the historic hotels in Milwaukee.  I personally Like the Astor.  The Pfister is also nice but you will pay.  Hotel Metro is has a nice location with bars and food within walking distance.  Anyways, here is a link to other historic hotels in the Milwaukee Area to get you started. http://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsList-Milwaukee-Historic-Hotels-zfp235425.html  Also, See this link.  I contributed to this thread and so did others.  There are other ideas about what to when in Milwaukee.  Please check it out.  Also, PM if you have any questions.  I would be glad to help a fellow baseball fan gave a good time here. http://www.reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/30ulzz/cards_fan_herei_promise_i_come_in_peace/"
Brewers,38gzwu,Guano_Loco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"I would look for your standard chain hotel that you're comfortable with. Find the closest one to the stadium that you can.   They may have a shuttle, but if they don't, bus/walk/whatever to one of the bars on bluemound. They all have shuttles to the stadium and it's usually free of you order something.   You get to shuttle down and back for free after the game. Make sure to remember your bar.   Enjoy the stadium. It's pretty sweet."
Brewers,38gzwu,redman2532,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:53:13 2015 UTC,http://www.brewhousesuites.com/  Jackson's in the hotel and they shuttle to every game. You are downtown. I also suggest trying the Best Place across the street for Pabst Brewery tours
Brewers,38gzwu,crewblue,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"While the stadium isn't in downtown, it's actually not too far either. Any place you could find a good rate around there wouldn't be too bad. If you want to splurge, the Potawatomi Hotel sounds like a good idea as someone else suggested. Some nice accommodations closer to the park."
Brewers,38gzwu,gonegoogling,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"I stayed at the Pfister once when the Twins played the Brewers and we decided to go out bar hopping after the game with two other guys we met at the hotel that were also from MN. They left to go back to the hotel around 12:30 and long story short, they got into a fake cab and taken to an alley and robbed at gunpoint. They took their belts shoes phones and of course money and jewelry. The cops said it happens all the time and they target people wearing away team stuff at bar close.  Tl;dr Watch out for fake taxis downtown Milwaukee."

They also have a shuttle to take you to the game I believe.    We love to tailgate, LOVE to tailgate.  I would recommend if you have a car driving in to the parking lot.  you may not have a grill but bring beer and food, and if you bribe your neighbors with beer they will usually let you cook some food on their grill.   Parking lot opens 3 hours before the game, its always a great time tailgating."

Brewers,38gzwu,smiles134,0,Thu Jun 4 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"If you means of transportation and don't care about being directly in the city or near the stadium, I would check for hotels in like Oak Creek/Franklin area. It's like 20 minutes to the stadium and it will most likely be cheaper. (Maybe not quite as nice, but if you're looking to save money)"

We've lost 9 of our last 11. That seems like a pretty hefty tank to me.  I would argue we haven't seen this team's upside yet, if anything. THat ""hot streak"" when Counsell took over- look again. We were playing .500 ball. That's the best we've done. (Actually... ironically... the best we've done is our sweep of the cubs: Roenecke's last series)"

Brewers,38diky,luvdmb36,3,Wed Jun 3 19:04:30 2015 UTC,I guess those advanced stats were right about Nelson. I am surprised that they let him continue to screw it up for so long today. Hate when managers just give up on games this early.
Brewers,38diky,dirtyshits,2,Wed Jun 3 19:03:21 2015 UTC,Curious which stats you're referring to
Brewers,38diky,wygibmer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:10:04 2015 UTC,Let me see if I can find the message a buddy sent me. It was a week ago I think but he told me that balls were being hit hard against Nelson but luckily they were finding gloves(even though his babip is high). Basically he should have been giving up more runs/hits/homers . He has a high hr/9 rate but they havent hurt him as much as they should considering a lot of them were solo. He was due for a game like this.

Brewers,38diky,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have been more specific! I'm a new brewer fan, moved to Milwaukee for school a couple years ago and recently sparked interest in baseball."
Brewers,38diky,MinnieFan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"Well... it's a rough season. If you are watching/listening to this game, it's about par for the course.  We've been struggling, a lot. Fired Ron Reonecke as manager a month or so ago, and milwaukee-area-native Craig Counsell to manage. He had us playing .500 (equal wins and losses) for a while, but now we're in a tailspin again."
Brewers,38diky,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, I noticed it wasn't the best season ever. Is there still hope to salvage the season? Or is it pretty much over?"
Brewers,38diky,MinnieFan,2,Wed Jun 3 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"over. We're all hoping they start selling off big players soon, to get a few younger, less expensive players to develop for the next couple years.  Basically, in 2007 we made a big push for the playoffs, and traded away like 4 prospects for CC Sabathia for half the year. We made the playoffs, which is huge for a small-market team like Milwaukee. Then the team was alright for a couple of years, and in 2011 we made another big push. Sold off a bunch more prospects for Zack Grienke. CC and Zack were like the best pitchers in the league at the time. A few other smaller transactions, and we pretty much traded away what could potentially be a full lineup today. So it's tough...  We're hoping to do the opposite this year. Sell off a guy like Gomez or Braun for 3 or 4 nice prospects.  So I guess that's sort of.. the state of the Brewers right now."
Brewers,38diky,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:22:14 2015 UTC,Thanks! Is there a chance of new General Manager? If you're selling or buying and it doesn't work it would have to come back to them eventually right?
Brewers,38diky,MinnieFan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a good chance we get a new GM soon. There is a lot of controversy about Doug Melvin, and how good he has been over the past few years.  And firing Ron Reonecke (manager) is a sign that Doug Melvin (GM) is afraid for his job. Because basically, when a team struggles, either the GM or Manager usually takes the fall. Since Doug was Ron's boss, he fires him to make him a scapegoat basically. Happens a lot in baseball. But the GM reports directly to the owner, so that would be Mark Attonasio's call.  At the time, we were all hyped about a playoff run, so at least myself, I was really excited we were spending big and making a push. We dont' get that often. It was 1982 the last time we made a playoff appearance prior to 07. But now that's coming back to bite us. Expected, yes. But Doug Melvin may have been able to backfill with prospects over the last 5 years or so..."

I seriously think 2 of them would've been outs if any other 3b was on the corner for us. And don't get me started on his offense. He's swinging a wet newspaper and he's swinging it at the worst times. His presence is hurting us now, and in the future in that he's taking at bats from guys who need and deserve them. I'd rather see Rogers at 3b every day knowing that at least he's got a chance at a future. Aram is a black hole. I mean he already said he's retiring at end of the year so fuck it why wait.   And if were gonna trade Gomez, lets get that over with right now too. Just one bonehead thing after another. Teams down by 1 guy in front of him gets on and he pops out on a 3-0 count. Wtf u doing bro, you're not mark mcgwire, you're not Barry bonds, knock off the bull shit and help the team win. Dont fuckin pop out to right on a 3-0 count when we haven't even had a runner on 3rd base yet. That kinda shit is grounds for a benching. Of course it won't happen, but it should.

Brewers,3895j6,kaesekopf,20,Tue Jun 2 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"So a team's minor leagues are colloquially referred to as a team's ""farm system.""  In case you weren't aware, there are 7 levels of professional baseball. MLB, Triple A, Double A, Single A (Split into two levels, High-A and Low-A), Class A-Short Season, and Rookie ball.  For the Brewers, these are the Colorado Springs Sky Sox (AAA), Biloxi Shuckers (AA), Brevard County Manatees (Advanced-A), Wisconsin Timber Rattlers (Low-A), currently no Short Season team, and the Helena Brewers (Rk).  It was made good before the 2011 season (really before like '05) because the Brewers had a lot of high quality prospects ready to come up. This included Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, Corey Hart, Yovanni Gallardo, Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, JJ Hardy, and others (as you'll see, most of these players aren't on the team any longer). What happened was, these prospects came up and had a lot of talent, but not enough to push for the playoffs, so the front office started making short-sighted, win now types of trades (like trading for CC midway through the '08 season, or trading for Greinke), without making the drafts or moves that would replenish the farm system with talented prospects.  Now, we don't have the prospects like we did 8, 9 years ago to come up and replace the guys who have left. We're stuck with a few good players and roster-filling replacement level players. We haven't been able to draft the highly touted prospects in recent years (partly due to our scouting staff, in my opinion), or sign the international free agents (mostly due to our budget), and so now we're stuck idling while teams like the Cardinals are able to draft and develop stars.  What the front office needs to do is start making trades with teams who are in the win-now mode that the Brewers were in 5, 6 years ago to replenish the farm system. We need to trade away players like Gomez who will yield prospects that will improve the team - in the future, not now.  The tricky part about this is that casual fans often don't understand the depth of a baseball organization. They might be more used to football, where fans will see the immediate impact of trades. They might not want to support a team if they trade away their favorite player and get (in their eyes) nothing in return. Plus, the team will most certainly have several losing seasons during this rebuild. It's hard to make money and sell tickets to fans if the team is always losing (though, we seem to be doing alright in that regard this year, so far at least.)  Hopefully this was helpful. Please ask if you have any questions. I'm not the biggest expert on the Brewers minor league organizations (or prospects in general), so others may be more qualified to answer, or to correct me."
Brewers,3895j6,smiles134,3,Tue Jun 2 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Problem I have with this argument is that the Brewers haven't made the sort of high value trades that deplete a farm system in the last few years. The last was Grienke in 2011 and all the touted players from those trades are already playing in the Majors: Escobar, Cain, Odorizzi, Brantley, Lawrie, etc.  Also, you're giving the Cardinals to much credit. They've been selling off their young players like mad for short term rentals. Blazek to Milwaukee for Axford. Kelly to Boston for Lackey. Miller to Atlanta for Heyward. Also, the Cardinals have the ability to run about $140M in payroll so they can afford to keep a few more top players.  Bottom line is that there has been a failure of the scouting department. Drafting has been harder the last decade because the Brewers haven't been picking in the top ten like they did with Weeks, Fielder, and Braun."
Brewers,3895j6,unmisunderestimated,2,Tue Jun 2 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Blazek is young, but it's not like he was a highly toted prospect or anything. You aren't giving the Cards enough credit. They have maintained a really good baseball team as well as a really good farm system for a loooong time now."

Brewers,3895j6,bootybooty,2,Tue Jun 2 21:02:32 2015 UTC,Here are some links and notes by people far more qualified to talk about these things:  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/evaluating-the-prospects-milwaukee-brewers/  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/instagraphs/top-200-prospects-a-compendium/  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/taking-a-stab-at-valuing-the-farm-systems/  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/katohs-top-200-prospect-list/  I think that should give you an idea of where our farm system ranks (near the bottom) and a good overview of the top prospects in our system.

Brewers,3895j6,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:29:07 2015 UTC,They had to make those trades for Sabathia and Grienke because they couldn't develop starting pitching in their own system.
Brewers,3895j6,crewblue,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:51:53 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  Good post.  I would like to add that the brewers must start developing their talent that they do have.  Not picking high is a part of the problem, but the larger issue is failure to develop any talent in that farm system.  Plenty of good players come from the later rounds in the draft, but the Brewers cannot seem to develop anything.  Look at Cain.  He looked terrible when he came up for the Brewers.  His swing was off balance and not at all the smooth stroke we see now.  He did hit over 300 in a cup of tea for the Brewers, but he looked terrible doing it.  I do not think the Brewers would made him into the player he is today.  KC did a good job with him.  If he was in Milwaukee, he would be nothing more than a another guy like Scooter.  So I think the Brewers should start hiring coaches from other organizations that know how to develop talent.  Maybe they can offer a promotion to a single A coach to a higher level like AA and steal him from a successful organization?   Maybe then we can develop some payers that know how to put together a quality at bat instead of the crap we have been seeing for years now.  Fielder and Braun just covered it up and last year was all smoke and mirrors.  Also, maybe we can develop some pitchers that know how to work down in the zone and maybe throw some change ups?  What is with all the high fastballs in a homerun park?  Again, poor coaching and player development.    I have been a life long Brewer fan, but if they don't change soon, I might consider walking away from them.  I will not support a full re-build and I will no longer support Band-Aid solutions to players or coaches.  I want to see them win a WS before I die!"
Brewers,3895j6,MiltownKBs,2,Fri Jun 5 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"The only way this team is going to make it to a WS is with a full rebuild. You can't keep plugging holes. We need good players all around. And yes, that starts from within, but we need to bring in players who have potential."
Brewers,3895j6,smiles134,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:09:11 2015 UTC,Why is a full re-build necessary?  Why can't we avoid 100 loss seasons while still doing a complete over haul of the farm system and the go for broke mentality our pitchers and especially our hitters seem to have been trained to have?  How long would a full re-build take to reach contention?  7-10 years?  I can't take that and I will not support that.  I grew up by county stadium and remember the dark years in the 80's and 90's.  I do not want to go back to that at all.  There has to be another way re-build without completely falling off.  Because fall off we will.  We have no prospects.  Our MLB talent has no trade value.  IDK man.  Dark times ahead for Brewers fans?
Brewers,3895j6,MiltownKBs,2,Fri Jun 5 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"Because we don't have the talent in the minor leagues right now. Our farm system is ranked among the bottom 5 in all of baseball. We need to trade the people who we will not control in 2-3 years and invest in the future. Look at teams who have gone through rebuilds. Astros, Cubs, Tigers. They're all competing now. We need to get to that point.   I think we can get to a competitive point again in 5 years. Anything earlier than that is overly optimistic."
Brewers,3895j6,smiles134,7,Fri Jun 5 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Some people also blame the loss of Jack Zduriencik.   He hasn't been terribly successful as GM for the Mariners, so others think he just happened to be around for the Braun\Fielder\Hardy\Weeks\Hart draft years.  http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/ms-hire-brewers-jack-zduriencik-as-gm/"
Brewers,3895j6,fischsticks,3,Tue Jun 2 21:45:11 2015 UTC,I just think he was an excellent scout who put together an excellent scouting team around him.  When you're the GM you don't necessarily get to see the prospects with your own eyes nearly as much as the scouts do.
Brewers,3895j6,02bluesuperroo,0,Wed Jun 3 01:35:06 2015 UTC,The draft picks were mostly terrible before he arrived and have been since he left. Almost every home grown player of significance since 2000 was drafted under his scouting. I don't think you can call that a coincidence.
Brewers,3895j6,crewblue,4,Thu Jun 4 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Farm system refers to the minor league teams that the Brewers are affiliated with.  When a player is drafted, they start out in the low minors (rookie ball its often called), and work their way up over the course of several years until theyre ready for the majors (MLB)  Basically a farm system is made better through good drafting, and good trades (IE, we'll probably trade Gomez away this year since we wont be able to afford him when his contract is up, and hopefully in return we'll get a few good prospects in the minors)"
Brewers,3895j6,necropaw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"So, looking at the Wiki page for the Brewers, it looks like they've got:  AAA - Colorado Springs Sky Sox AA - Biloxi Shuckers A - Brevard County Manatees and Wisconsin Timber Rattlers Rookie - Helena, AZL, and DSL Brewers  So, do the Brewers ...  draft the players for these teams?  Or do the Brewers have any control over who the lower teams pick?  Or does the Brewers front office make the hirings for these lower-league team front offices?  This is interesting stuff."
Brewers,3895j6,necropaw,2,Tue Jun 2 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Brewers draft them and they 'belong' to the organization.    The minor league teams are often owned by outside ownership, though.  Up until last year our AAA team was the Nashville Sounds."
Brewers,3895j6,miamiflashfan,2,Tue Jun 2 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"Might be worth clarifying that not all minor leaguers are drafted by us. Minor leaguers can be acquired through trades, international signers, rule five draft, etc."
Brewers,3895j6,buckybone,2,Tue Jun 2 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Rule 5 draftees don't really count, as the team has to either keep them on the major league roster for the season or risk having to give them back to their former team."
Brewers,3895j6,miamiflashfan,2,Wed Jun 3 09:25:58 2015 UTC,You could send them down after the season though. Just saying it's possible for a minor leaguer to be acquired through rule 5.
Brewers,3895j6,itzjamesftw,2,Wed Jun 3 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Correct. The Brewers sign or draft players and then 'assign' them to a minor league level.  AAA being the closest to major league ready talent.  Typically a young drafted player will start in rookie ball and work their way up the ladder to A, AA, AAA by showing good play and progression in skills. The Brewers major league team can call up any player from any level of the minor leagues."
Brewers,3895j6,workthrowaway68,3,Wed Jun 3 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"Well, in 2011 the system was actually not very good, i would call it average, but they sent away 3 of their top prospects in trades for Zack Grienke and Shaun Marcum.  The system was really good back in 2004-2007 and it was good because they drafted well and developed hitting well.  In order to make it better, they need to trade away players with value like Lucroy and Braun and Gomez to get back good prospects, and they need to draft well.  Its going to take a long time, but without the commitment to this course of action, this years results will become commonplace."

Brewers,38978i,machiavellism,3,Tue Jun 2 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, i didnt really see that one coming."
Brewers,38978i,necropaw,3,Tue Jun 2 18:48:17 2015 UTC,Herrera didn't deserve this.
Brewers,38978i,adam7765,3,Tue Jun 2 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, it was a surprise when he had a bit of success with the Brewers in the first place.Never was going to be a long term answer."
Brewers,38978i,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"No, but a switch hitter off the bench with MLB experience isn't a bad thing.  He'll probably clear waivers and make it back into our farm system, and I guess we'll be in a full rebuild soon enough anyways."
Brewers,38978i,BeHereNow91,5,Fri Jun 5 04:50:08 2015 UTC,I really don't understand this move. Herrera is the perfect bench player. The dude can play from basically anywhere in the field.
Brewers,38978i,smiles134,5,Tue Jun 2 18:54:26 2015 UTC,except the batter's position
Brewers,38978i,quickstop_rstvideo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, bench players are never going to be guys who hit .300. Otherwise they wouldn't be bench players."

Brewers,38978i,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but they should probably be able to get on base at least .300 of the time. A .259 OBP isn't going to fly anywhere."
Brewers,38978i,dusters,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:36:50 2015 UTC,Herrera's career OBP is .304. That's the same as Perez's minor league OBP. Perez's MLB OBP is .189.
Brewers,38978i,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:42:16 2015 UTC,Probably thinking a change of scenery/approach could improve him. They know what they have with Herrera. at least with Perez they might think they can change something to make him better.
Brewers,38978i,dusters,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:02:55 2015 UTC,"yeee. Only explanation I've heard that's made sense is that Perez and Herrera have similar profiles, but Perez is six years younger."
Brewers,38978i,smiles134,2,Wed Jun 3 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, now im just confused.  This guys stats are...not good.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/perezhe01.shtml"
Brewers,38978i,necropaw,2,Tue Jun 2 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"I guess his stats in the minors werent so bad. http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=perez-001her  I guess the Brewers must have figured Herrera wasnt going to get any better, and seeing as the season is lost they might as well see if they can find some diamond in the rough type talent?"
Brewers,38978i,necropaw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"My thoughts too, might as well see what we've got. Could go all Josh Donaldson and really break out as a good player, but chances are he is just a cheaper/younger Herrera."
Brewers,38978i,SolidRambo,2,Wed Jun 3 01:23:29 2015 UTC,Good move.  This guy can play all over the field as well and unlike the 30 year old Herrera he's still only 24 and has a little upside going by his last few seasons in the minors.
Brewers,38978i,EthyleneGlycol,4,Tue Jun 2 18:57:48 2015 UTC,"damn, Herrera is 30 already?"
Brewers,38978i,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Too bad. Good luck, Elian. You and Falu were fun to watch in Spring Training the last 2 years."

Brewers,38978i,Nadie_AZ,2,Tue Jun 2 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"It's more about age than anything. We know who Herrera is and what he brings to the table, but a 24 year old who's been a top 10 prospect in the Tigers organization still has time to live up to his potential. More upside than Herrera and the Brewers have the time to wait on him."
Brewers,38ai5x,bericdongdarrion,2,Tue Jun 2 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like the other commenter said, Braun is the only one who deserves it really and there has to be at least one player per team on the all star roster"
Brewers,38ai5x,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:06:31 2015 UTC,"But there are still fans who I am sure, even if he was leading the league in HRs & Batting Average still will not vote for him because of his PED history."

Brewers,38ai5x,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"Braun has a wRC+ of 123, Lind a 131, and Gomez a 108. Braun and Lind are more in the conversation than Gomez and Lind has been playing more poorly lately. I think it's a little silly to consider Gomez and Lind but not Braun."
Brewers,38ai5x,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"But a fair majority of people fill these things out by just picking names they recognize.  Gomez was an All Star Last year and made it on to Sportscenter for his defense last year.  He'll get a fair amount of those ""Blind to the Stats"" voters."
Brewers,38ai5x,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:41:07 2015 UTC,No Brewer is going to win a fan vote. It's going to be a manager vote in.
Brewers,38ai5x,smiles134,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:52:45 2015 UTC,Fiers has the highest WAR but a guy like him isnt going to be selected by the manager or the players.

Because the ball was clear from one angle and the base on another.   I thought it was clear. Watch the ball angle and you could see he got the tag as his glove hit the ground. Then the base angle, you can see his fingers are like 6 inches away.   Tough way to end a game though too i guess"

Brewers,384425,smiles134,2,Mon Jun 1 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of people freak out by the high ERA. What they don't realize is that A-ball (especially low A) your pitchers are really working on one or two pitches. To the point where they could probably throw it with their eye's closed. Then they work on adding more, and getting better as they work their way up."
Brewers,384425,madman86,2,Tue Jun 2 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"I have season tickets to the T-Rats and make it to quite a few games of theirs. So I was really excited to see some of the top picks of the crew from last year and the year before.   Medeiros / Gatewood / Harrison / D. Williams have looked pretty good. Harrison has made some ESPN Top Ten type of catches this year also he looks good. I don't go to nuts with some poor performance at this point the're 19, 20, 21 year old kids they're going to continue to learn the need to catch a bit of a break."
Brewers,384425,SoSublim3,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:29:43 2015 UTC,That's good to hear.
Brewers,384425,SoSublim3,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Also some more info MLB pipeline just did a report to catch up with first rounders from last years draft this is what they had to say about Medeiros   The Hawaiian high schooler was challenged with an assignment to the full-season Midwest League, and he is striking out 10.1 per nine. Medeiros threw seven innings of two-hit shutout ball in his last start on Thursday."
Brewers,382y5f,BrewCrewKevin,5,Mon Jun 1 13:57:13 2015 UTC,Can we get THIS picture of Cravy on the sidebar? Everything about it says Brewer to me.
Brewers,382y5f,Valleyoan,4,Mon Jun 1 14:14:02 2015 UTC,Not unexpected.  Needed to get a fresh arm after that freaking game.
Brewers,382y5f,necropaw,3,Mon Jun 1 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"I am also a Jays fan, so I had to get a chuckle out of this sentence: ""With Davis going on the DL, it left first baseman Adam Lind as the only player from the original starting eight who had been physically available for every game."""
Brewers,382y5f,vincey12,3,Mon Jun 1 14:39:46 2015 UTC,And he say with back tightness. ..  Or pitchers have been good until recently though. We were the last team to use a 6th starter yesterday

Brewers,382y5f,TheBause,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:23:06 2015 UTC,We hat one of Khris Davis doing this last year. I love the double bubble hats.
Brewers,382y5f,EthyleneGlycol,3,Mon Jun 1 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"A lot going on right now:   Davis went to the DL late last week Tyler Wagner was called up and started Sunday's game Now Tyler Wagner was sent back Tyler Cravy was called up Will Smith's hearing is today about his suspension Adam Lind is having back tightness and will probably be out of the lineup tonight   Also... the article says ""everybody but unavailable Michael Blazek""... whats up with that?"
Brewers,382y5f,christianpowell416,3,Mon Jun 1 14:08:51 2015 UTC,Blazek pitched three innings on Saturday so I assume they didn't want to use him on Sunday.
Brewers,382y5f,smiles134,2,Mon Jun 1 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"He was warming up at one point. Just before Garza, probably like the 11th?"

Brewers,380o6v,Tasteful_Dick_Pics,5,Mon Jun 1 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"""That pigeon was an egg when the game started.""  I laughed pretty hard."
Brewers,380o6v,tacoguy1234,4,Mon Jun 1 03:10:56 2015 UTC,hah yeah glad someone else noticed that. it gave me a good laugh.
Brewers,380o6v,silentjay01,14,Mon Jun 1 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"Good thing Lucroy is back tomorrow.  After 17 innings, Maldy'll need to rest Monday."
Brewers,380o6v,jn2010,3,Mon Jun 1 00:06:48 2015 UTC,That's right.  Good timing.  I was thinking Cenato would be behind the plate but we get Luc back!
Brewers,380o6v,adam7765,11,Mon Jun 1 00:11:50 2015 UTC,12 game winning streak commences.

Brewers,380o6v,lilyth88,11,Mon Jun 1 00:11:44 2015 UTC,Loved the comment about the pigeon.
Brewers,380o6v,SocksandSmocks,9,Mon Jun 1 00:18:44 2015 UTC,We got 18 fucking wins and I'm still jacked as shit right now. Love it. Love the team
Brewers,380o6v,mistrbrownstone,3,Mon Jun 1 00:02:41 2015 UTC,Apparently you're so jacked that you counted a bonus win in there.
Brewers,380o6v,allonbacuth,2,Mon Jun 1 05:27:50 2015 UTC,Or he is from one day in the future.
Brewers,380o6v,Tuxedo38,7,Mon Jun 1 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"I watch five hours of this game, only to go upstairs for a couple mins then come back and see Sophia interviewing Maldy. I was the jinx, you're welcome fellow Brewers fans."
Brewers,380o6v,silentjay01,11,Mon Jun 1 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"Damn it, man.  Next time go upstairs after the 10th."
Brewers,380o6v,jn2010,5,Mon Jun 1 00:07:55 2015 UTC,Crazy fucking game.  I hope there isn't a hangover tomorrow.  That must have been hard on the players.

Brewers,380o6v,youreaturtle,7,Mon Jun 1 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"gg y'all, more entertaining than my game today"
Brewers,380o6v,wygibmer,4,Mon Jun 1 00:10:05 2015 UTC,less depressing certainly
Brewers,380o6v,youreaturtle,2,Mon Jun 1 01:38:45 2015 UTC,...right? I think /r/redsox may have just made it moreso... it was ugly today and last night
Brewers,380o6v,smiles134,7,Mon Jun 1 03:50:52 2015 UTC,That was like two full games. Garza got a win for a game he didn't start. Do you think we bring up a fresh arm from AAA for a fill in start?
Brewers,380o6v,coopswag,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:12:13 2015 UTC,sent wagner down today and fiers starts tomorrow so i assume it's more like a AAA guy to fill out the next round in the rotation
Brewers,380o6v,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:15:49 2015 UTC,CRAVY!
Brewers,380o6v,smiles134,2,Mon Jun 1 01:41:31 2015 UTC,"Haha holy shit, you were just one callup off. I guess we'll see if you were right and I was wrong soon."
Brewers,380o6v,dangersewagelagoon2,6,Mon Jun 1 02:18:28 2015 UTC,What a game. I hope Ueck enjoys his Meals on Wheels tonight.
Brewers,380o6v,gandaalf,6,Mon Jun 1 00:22:12 2015 UTC,All I can say is that I'm glad we left today in the 8th inning. Go Brew Crew!!
Brewers,380o6v,tACorruption,3,Mon Jun 1 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"I held out til the 11th, also don't regret it."
Brewers,380o6v,gandaalf,2,Mon Jun 1 00:13:02 2015 UTC,I feel ya. Once Trombone man got that homer I was out.
Brewers,380o6v,Puckfan21,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:19:57 2015 UTC,Made it to the 14th..
Brewers,380o6v,CJL13,6,Mon Jun 1 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"This was Gomez's plan all along, make Maldy the hero so he doesn't get benched."

Brewers,380o6v,madman86,3,Mon Jun 1 00:03:26 2015 UTC,Throwing Garza in there...man that is one of those decisions where had it not worked out but now CC just looks like a genius.
Brewers,380o6v,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"RR would have just thrown a position player in there because fuck it, the season is lost anyway."
Brewers,380o6v,necropaw,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:21:23 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure we had no position players to spare.

Brewers,380o6v,necropaw,2,Mon Jun 1 00:26:48 2015 UTC,How close was that foul ball to you?
Brewers,380o6v,TheBause,2,Mon Jun 1 00:48:02 2015 UTC,There were multiples within a section on either side.  That last awesome barehand was about 20 seats away I think?

Brewers,37yq6r,KQ2eZPackers,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:03:12 2015 UTC,Any idea why he didn't go in? Just overworked or is there an injury there?
Brewers,37yq6r,allonbacuth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:33:02 2015 UTC,Best guess is that they are saving him to start in Wily Peralta's spot in the rotation and he will have that spot until Wily returns

Brewers,37yq6r,WiscOrangy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:12:50 2015 UTC,i mean that he looked really good today... as opposed to when we roughed him up when he started against us earlier this year
Brewers,37yq6r,fightinchunk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:51:45 2015 UTC,Ohh ok. I should have probably remembered that he pitched against you guys.  I mean just about every player on the brewers have been roughed up this season so..

Brewers,37yq6r,zazu2006,2,Sun May 31 23:52:29 2015 UTC,"Not much. BA just said longest game in franchise history was in 1984, and you played in that one, right rock? And rock said ""that's right"". Didn't really get a story."

Brewers,37yq6r,SocksandSmocks,3,Sun May 31 23:41:33 2015 UTC,He does not have a feel for the outside edge.
Brewers,37yq6r,jn2010,1 point,Sun May 31 23:42:48 2015 UTC,Gomez lead-off walk  Rogers grounds into force out  Herrera base hit into left  Sardinas walks after a wild pitch  D-Backs bring in fifth infielder  Maldonado strikes out   Garza strikes out and we go to 17th

Brewers,37yq6r,SocksandSmocks,2,Sun May 31 23:25:19 2015 UTC,What's the record on consecutive intentional walks?

Brewers,37yq6r,SolidRambo,4,Sun May 31 23:17:14 2015 UTC,Braun walk off double in the 15th.  I'm committed.

Brewers,37yrl4,phirebug,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:42:56 2015 UTC,I would argue the mid-90's. The team was terrible but we also were scared to death of them moving to North Carolina.
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:47:51 2015 UTC,Idk. This has been the worst first 50 games in franchise history...
Brewers,37yrl4,smiles134,5,Sun May 31 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"But the sample size is just that, 50 games. 2001-2004 were terrible, with little light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not betting on it getting a whole lot better over the next 50 games, but so far this isn't so bad. The question was ""worst situation in franchise history"" not ""worst start to a season."""
Brewers,37yrl4,buckwheatie,3,Sun May 31 19:33:24 2015 UTC,True
Brewers,37yrl4,smiles134,-10,Sun May 31 19:39:34 2015 UTC,What's the point of supporting a team when they suck.
Brewers,37yrl4,Redtitwhore,3,Sun May 31 22:19:37 2015 UTC,Because then you have some perspective when they don't suck.
Brewers,37yrl4,allonbacuth,12,Mon Jun 1 16:26:19 2015 UTC,Mark A alone puts us in better shape than any year the Seligs owned the team.
Brewers,37yrl4,nutty15,10,Sun May 31 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Does the new ""Selig Experience"" have a game where people can see how little they can spend on payroll while still bringing in enough money in ticket sales and concessions to turn a profit for the year?"
Brewers,37yrl4,silentjay01,0,Sun May 31 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, the ""Selig Experience"" is the one in which a wealthy owner forces you to perform a dangerous operation in adverse conditions, resulting in the untimely death of 3 people because he wants to push forward construction rather than focus on the well being of the workers."
Brewers,37yrl4,walfredo_primavera,3,Sun May 31 18:25:27 2015 UTC,I don't see what Bud Selig has to do with the reckless practices of a contractor and subcontractor.
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,2,Mon Jun 1 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way: you can look at the obvious pinch point in the project which is the general contractor and say he had the ultimate say in this. But, Selig put as little money into this team as he could to extract maximum profitability while simultaneously acting as commissioner of the MLB. he couldn't right well lose his team to another city because of an embarrassing fiasco such as not putting the necessary repairs into County Stadium all along in order to maintain his public image as owner and commissioner.What does he do?  He puts forth an ambitious but unpopular project to build a premier stadium.  This project, whose ultimate aim is to decrease suspicion that he's a slum lord with profit and personal ambition over continued Brewer success falls behind production schedules. Unpredictable Wisconsin weather further hampers his aspirations and he pressures a questionable lift over doubts by directly levying his influence to the companies involved. Local business owners, 50/50 on the actual risk involved but nearly 100% motivated by the prospects of a successful lift that day contribute to a total failure. The 50/50? It was a risky lift. Techically feasible, but generally considered I'll advised due not to wind speed, but wind gust. That's unfortunately what happened and to me, unforgivable. I offer credit to the man, regardless of the process, for giving us the unpopular gift of Miller Park- truly one of the greatest of baseball stadiums ever constructed. But, given the circumstances, I offer no apologies for recanting my support of the sacrifices needed to obtain it. For the current support of the Brewers from the community, I offer my undying support to Attanasio, who elegantly rebuilt a dying franchise."
Brewers,37yrl4,walfredo_primavera,0,Mon Jun 1 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree with this statement.  Attanasio has put this team exactly in the position it is in now.  His lack of a stomach to start a rebuild two years ago, his insistence on signing Free Agents to bad contracts, and plowing money into ""fan"" things instead of the baseball side of the organization is playing a large part of what the team is doing right now.  The 2006 Houston Astros and the 2012 Milwaukee Brewers are VERY similar.  The Astros hired a new GM and they completely cleaned house in the front office and on the field.  They committed to a long rebuild, and they are finally now seeing the fruits of that rebuild and they are going to be successful for years to come.  The Brewers on the other hand, keep guys like Doug Melvin, Rick Schlesinger, Reid Nichols and Gord Ash around; the owner plays an active part in the baseball side of things, they spend money poorly; all for the sake of keeping fans in the stadium.  Better than Selig? Yes!  But a steaming pile of shit is better than Selig (in everything he ever did).  This team is poised to be even worse for quite a long time, and Mark A has played a major role in that."
Brewers,37yrl4,workthrowaway68,4,Sun May 31 21:02:36 2015 UTC,I'm definitely not saying current state is roses.  I'm just saying it's hard to say this is the worst situation in franchise history when the Selig era happened.
Brewers,37yrl4,nutty15,0,Mon Jun 1 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  But Attanasio plays a large part in what is going on, in my opinion."
Brewers,37yrl4,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Jun 1 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I know I like literally just said that A has my undying support, but you're right on! The number one money all issue right now is on getting back to basics and that's winning. The money invested in the Brewers right now should be poured into the farm system. Public statements should be: building, not ""re"" building, but creating. The essence is, BE BAD! Get the top draft picks for 2-3 seasons, all the while,  make VERY unpopular decisions. Gomez? Trade for draft picks and the very top tier AAA guys.  Khris Davis, Will Smith etc etc? Trade for prospects and NEVER go all 2011 by trading the farm ever again. You need to cultivate talert when you have no money,  not buy it."
Brewers,37yrl4,walfredo_primavera,8,Mon Jun 1 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"Probably won't be worse then the stretch of the  2001/2002/2003 seasons, where their records were: 68-94, 56-106, 68-94.  Those teams were just depressing. Selig's daughter had no idea how to run a baseball team."
Brewers,37yrl4,bamfra,2,Sun May 31 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"Dean Taylor proved to be an absolutely terrible GM, outside of his hiring of Jack Zduriencik"
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"I remember when he called up Nick Neugabauer earlier than he should have which made him arbitration eligible a year earlier which also nuked his arm. Then there was the crappy Jeffrey Hammonds deal. And hiring Davey Lopes.To his credit, the Richie Sexson trade was his move. Between him and Bando I'd call it a push."
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,-4,Wed Jun 3 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"Hold on to your seats, a repeat of those years is on the horizon for this team."
Brewers,37yrl4,workthrowaway68,4,Wed Jun 3 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"You know they went 13 seasons without finishing over .500 right?  This has been a horrible season but I don't think we've sunk to those depths quite yet.  As another poster mentioned, Mark owning the team puts in a much better position than when the Selig's did seeing as how he actually wants to win."
Brewers,37yrl4,EthyleneGlycol,1 point,Sun May 31 21:03:33 2015 UTC,How did Selig not want to win?
Brewers,37yrl4,EthyleneGlycol,2,Sun May 31 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he ""wanted"" to win, but he liked making and keeping money more.  It's not a coincidence that payroll stayed stagnant until he sold the team.  It's also not a coincidence that they held onto the team until the city, county, and state agreed to build Miller Park for them.  Selig is canonized in the local media for bringing baseball back to Milwaukee but they neglect the fact he did nothing for it once it was there."
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,1 point,Sun May 31 16:01:27 2015 UTC,He was too thrifty for his own good. I think he also held back spending to save face for the political issues of the strike and a new stadium.
Brewers,37yrl4,zazu2006,7,Sun May 31 18:23:23 2015 UTC,Well for the franchise probably not.  It used to be in  Seattle.  I would say some of the darkest days for a franchise is when it leaves a city.  That being said it isn't even the worst situation milwaukee baseball has been in.  When the Braves left it was a real blow to baseball fans in the state I am sure.  But we are going to have a shitty few years.
Brewers,37yrl4,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"It was only in Seattle for a year, so I wouldn't call that a very dark time"
Brewers,37yrl4,Beginnerwithnoluck,2,Sun May 31 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's really rough, but finishing .500 and missing playoffs doesn't do any more good than this (besides appease the casual fans). At least we already know we're out of it, and can construct a rebuild plan. We're in the position to be sellers and gain some pieces, and a top draft pick next year would be big too. The Bucks taught me sometimes you have to really lose badly to win."
Brewers,37yrl4,madman86,4,Sun May 31 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"It is the worst start if thats what you mean. Oh and our farm system is also ranked as one of the worst right now so....yeah I guess you could say it is the worst position we've been in for a while. I don't know about every. There was a stretch there where we sucked and there wasn't really any signs of getting better. I hope we aren't headed there again, and I doubt we are. I think our ownership is actually interested in winning so the rebuild will happen quicker than it did in the past."

Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,1 point,Sun May 31 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"No. Atleast this team has some talented players that could make the All-Star team and would be valuable commodities if they were traded (Braun, Gomez, Lucroy). I remember some years where the Brewers were terrible and didn't even have that. But maybe that's more my age than the state of the team."
Brewers,37yrl4,bluewho32,1 point,Sun May 31 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think our problems are higher up than having bad players or a bad manager. Having the third worst farm system in the league makes it really hard to field a good team, I mean the Brewers AAA team more or less got dumped by Nashville this offseason, that doesn't fill me with confidence. Kinda thinking (hoping?) we'll see a new GM before the start of next season."
Brewers,37yrl4,MurDoct,3,Sun May 31 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"Our farm system used to be one of, if not the best a handful of years ago. Now its gone to hell because Doug went all in to try to get us to the World Series, and we damn near did."
Brewers,37yrl4,crewblue,2,Mon Jun 1 00:26:44 2015 UTC,The post-Jack Zduriencik drafts have been terrible. The best players Bruce Seid's tenure has to show for are Scooter Gennett and Khris Davis.
Brewers,37yrl4,fly1ngorb,2,Sun May 31 16:01:39 2015 UTC,I read earlier that none of our first round draft picks since 2009 have made it to the majors.

Brewers,37wfb8,CJL13,2,Sun May 31 00:04:47 2015 UTC,My guess is probably Shane Peterson.
Brewers,37wfb8,adam7765,2,Sun May 31 00:07:35 2015 UTC,Shane Peterson actually has some good numbers in AAA. If he can contribute that would be nice.
Brewers,37wfb8,BlankJebus,2,Sun May 31 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He has looked pretty good. Watched him play on Thursday night against the 51's here in Vegas. He went 2-3 with a HR and 3 RBIs, he's hitting .323."

Brewers,37wfb8,madman86,2,Sun May 31 01:25:26 2015 UTC,Parra will replace him as every day. I'm guessing they will bring up someone who can play all three outfield positions or at very least the corners.

Brewers,37wfb8,silentjay01,2,Sat May 30 23:32:53 2015 UTC,"Well, make that 5 of the 8 Opening Day starters that have spent time on the DL."
Brewers,37wfb8,EthyleneGlycol,3,Sun May 31 01:23:19 2015 UTC,This probably helps us more than hurts us.  I don't wish injury on anybody but to be honest Khris Davis isn't very good.  The playing time will make Parra a more attractive trade candidate.
Brewers,37wfb8,dusters,1 point,Sun May 31 02:19:54 2015 UTC,"Davis isn't great, but the AAA replacements are worse. At least Davis can hit a little bit."

Brewers,37wfb8,dusters,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:59:12 2015 UTC,"So then it would be pretty irrelevant then? It's not like Parra is going to magically learn how to hit. He's a defensive first player whose defense is slowly declining, and will be a FA. Not a ton of value in that."
Brewers,37wfb8,EthyleneGlycol,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"We're not going to get a superstar, but what's the point of holding onto him when we could get a controllable depth player?"
Brewers,37wfb8,dusters,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:10:09 2015 UTC,"You are mischaracterizing my argument. I never said we should hold onto him. You said Davis getting hurts helps us, I said it doesn't because Parra is who he is and his value isn't going to really change much one way or another, and that the AAA replacements aren't anyone that is likely to be helped by some MLB AB's."

That being said, however the weather turns out tomorrow I'd never turn away a Brewers fan (especially one that brought beer) from hanging out at my tailgate and having a Usinger's.

Brewers,37szi8,necropaw,2,Sat May 30 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"Serious question: how is it that the Brewers keep using Broxton?  He's probably out of options, right? He's got a big contract, how long does it run?   It seems as though the team should cut him, but for some reason can't. Is that true?  I'm not pointing to him as the main reason the Crew lost tonight, this is just a question I've wanted to ask for a couple weeks now. Because it seems as though every time I check Milwaukee's box score, Broxton has been tagged for multiple runs. The guy cannot get hitters out this year, and I can't help but feel like the team and player just need to part ways.   If anyone can provide some insight here, I'd appreciate it. I'm a die-hard Wisconsin fan but also, by a cruel twist of fate, a Cubs fan  before being a Brewer fan. And I mean this sincerely: I hope shit gets better for the Crew, because I know how much it sucks to have utterly no hope for a season before June even arrives. The Cubbies had been that team for 3+ years...to say nothing of other years.   All of which is to say that I hope things improve, and that the Brewers can salvage some good young players if indeed a trade-off of some measure happens. Good luck, see you Sconnie folks in the Packer/Badger subreddits"

Brewers,37k3ou,Valleyoan,3,Thu May 28 05:22:41 2015 UTC,Just saw him pitch last night in Vegas!  I'm no scout but he was certainly shutting down the 51s all night and smashed a double off the wall.  If the season doesn't turn around I'm sure he'll get a chance
Brewers,37k3ou,ShakeNBakey,2,Thu May 28 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Went to the game tonight, so I missed Cravy's game last night, but was keeping tabs on his start last night. He looked great. Jungman looked good tonight as well. His speed and control was great."
Brewers,37k3ou,BlankJebus,2,Fri May 29 05:19:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you see in Cravy. He's had a FIP over over 4 in AAA, even though he has a BABIP that is enough below the average to be concerning (i.e., he's had a good enough defense to bail him out, or maybe a bit of luck). I don't think he's ready. He looks like he's pitched well in AA (thus, having a .86 WHIP over 14 games with a career best 4.27 K/BB), but all those numbers drop when he gets to AAA.   Edit: Just glancing at Taylor Jungmann's stats, his ERA is up there, but so is his BABIP... Jungmann is a better pitcher I think and has a better FIP in a hitter-friendly park."
Brewers,37k3ou,smiles134,1 point,Thu May 28 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of FIP when pitchers are throwing in parks where the ball absolutely flies. The stat gives too much weight to home-runs to be taken seriously when guys are throwing in places like Colorado Springs, where the air is thin and the wind is prone to blow out 20 mph. What would be a 280 foot fly out is instead of bomb over the scoreboard, and it absolutely wrecks the FIP. Maybe if the formula was adjusted for places like Colorado Springs, I'd be a little more in favor of it. But until then FIP = ((13HR)+(3(BB+HBP))-(2*K))/IP + constant of 3.1 just isn't a fair judgement across all leagues imo. If you take out 2 of the 4 HR cravy has given up this year, his FIP drops to 3.46. The stat is a little flawed.   Also, I've watched nearly every AAA game this year, and I can assure you Cravy's BABIP is not a thing of luck. In fact, if he actually did have a solid defense of outfielders with decent speed, it would be even lower than it is. The truth is there are not many hard hit balls off the bat against Cravy. He breaks a lot of bats, and gets out of jams when he needs to."
Brewers,37k3ou,smiles134,2,Thu May 28 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, well, look at his K/BB, then, too. You compare him to Fiers, yet Fiers had a K/BB that was double (and some years almost triple) Cravy's K/BB during Mike's minor league career. IDK, I'm just not seeing it. I haven't watched him pitch at all, so I could be completely wrong, but the stats just aren't wowing me."
Brewers,37k3ou,MustBeNice,2,Fri May 29 18:11:16 2015 UTC,You seem to know what you're talking about. I trust you.
Brewers,37k3ou,MustBeNice,2,Fri May 29 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that. Whether you're being genuine or not. I've loved baseball since I could walk. I love watching and analyzing it more now as I get too old to play. And I got a good feeling about this cravy kid. Wish the brewers front office felt the same way. Knowing brewer luck, he'll slip out of our grasp, land on a team that respects his abilities, and he'll shut us down."
Brewers,37k3ou,Nadie_AZ,2,Fri May 29 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"Oh no sarcasm at all! I loved the post, taught me a lot about a kid I had barely even heard of. And I knew about FIP but I never realized how much it overvalues home run rate, & I liked your point about pitching in Colorado Springs can really hurt a pitcher's FIP. Very informative.  Ahh knock on wood don't say that! But yes I agree, the front office has been terrible.  Anytime I see the latest Odorizzi stat line I can't help but cringe.  And don't get me started on Cain, Escobar, Brantley and even Cruz to an extent. Say what you want about Greinke, but the fact is we had him for 1.5 years, & he had one of the worst years of his career in 2011.  Plus he missed the first month. Marcum was arguably more important in leading the crew to the playoffs than Greinke.  But anyway....I digress."

He's a bottom of the rotation starter on a 2nd division team at best.  And if Fiers is his comp, then he really isnt anything special.  Because Fiers is the same thing:  Unspectacular stuff who gets away with deception and location.  We've seen what happens once hitters figure him out and the command disappears.  Too many subtractions lately is true, but too many soft tossers like this in the system is also true."

When Fiers is hitting his spots he doesn't walk anybody and is near untouchable.  The difference between the two is that Greg Maddux brought it start after start while Fiers is inconsistent.

Brewers,37hz39,nonstop87,2,Wed May 27 22:10:02 2015 UTC,I like Cravy a lot too. I think he'll eventually end up in the bullpen but I think it's a toss-up between him and Jungmann.
Brewers,37hz39,The_Bostache,2,Wed May 27 23:43:26 2015 UTC,I'd preferably like to see Jungmann get a chance to experience the bigs.
Brewers,37hz39,EthyleneGlycol,3,Wed May 27 19:59:29 2015 UTC,No reason not to.  He'll probably be taking over for Lohse next year so might as well get him a few big league starts before throwing him into it.
Brewers,37hz39,BeHereNow91,2,Wed May 27 20:22:47 2015 UTC,Especially low-pressure starts.  Getting into the middle of the season with the worst record in the majors means there's little pressure to perform.  Might as well give some young guys a chance.

What else do we do, get Jungman ready and have 4 young guys?"
Brewers,37hz39,EthyleneGlycol,2,Thu May 28 00:49:57 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, we're not probably not going to compete next year.  Why trade away more prospects and take on more salary for some middle of the road vet who isn't going to be enough to get us to the playoffs anyway?  Garza is a veteran, Peralta would be in his fourth full season, Fiers in his fourth, Nelson in his third.  None of them are that young really."

Brewers,37gq9s,TurboShorts,0,Wed May 27 19:46:54 2015 UTC,How long have they been putting pitcher in the 8th spot?  Since Gomez came off the DL?  A little known secret about Valentina is that it can reduce recovery time.  Apply topically.  Also available as a suppository.

Brewers,37fr8x,flkitten,5,Wed May 27 08:35:54 2015 UTC,"Well, let me preemptively welcome you to Milwaukee!   You can drink beer in pretty much any part of the stadium, there's only about 2 or 3 ""Family"" sections where alcohol isn't allowed. The cheaper seats, typically up on the 4th level or out in the bleachers, tend to be a bit ""livelier"" in my opinion. They're either families with a bunch of kids, drunk 20-somethings who can't afford better seats, or just people who don't really care about the game but showed up to drink anyways.   Before the game, I'd recommend you show up about 3 hours early in the parking lot to tailgate, or just hang out at some of the bars that offer a free shuttle to the game."
Brewers,37fr8x,dabarn,4,Wed May 27 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"You can drink almost anywhere inside the stadium. The ""livelier"" area question is kind of hard to answer as ballgames are usually more laid back than other sports. Obviously, the closer and more expensive seats are closer to the action. Personally, I've always like the right field bleachers. Great view of the field."
Brewers,37fr8x,crewblue,2,Wed May 27 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"You can buy beer anywhere in the park. They're pretty expensive in the game about $8 for a 16 oz, but they're widely available. A big part of the Milwaukee baseball culture is tailgating in the parking lot before the game. You may be limited on grilling equipment being you're on a road trip, but you could chill with your friend, have a few beers, play some drinking games, and try to latch on to a group you can grill with. As for seating in the game it sounds like you may like the bleachers. Bleachers seem to be the rowdiest section from what I remember."
Brewers,37fr8x,internetsurfer,2,Wed May 27 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"First off, get there early and tailgate. Even if you don't have a grill. Grab some subs, a 6 pack of beer, and hang out in the lot before the game. Grab a beer and walk around the lot- it's a lot of fun.  As for seats, you can drink anywhere but the 4 ""family"" sections, which are 217,308,309,417.   Seats- There isn't really a bad seat in the house. The stadium is 4 levels. Field, Loge, Club, Terrace. Obviously the closer you are to the field the better the view, and the easier it is to get into and follow the game.  As far as atmosphere, I would agree with the other poster that the right field bleachers are probably the most fun. The outfield bleachers are in 2 decks. I hardly ever sit there though because you can't see the scoreboard and it's hard to see home plate. I would just rather sit behind home plate somewhere.  And the club level is probably the least amount of fun. A lot of them are company tickets, so you get a lot of business guys that don't follow the game there.  Field level is fun and easy to get into, loge level is probably my favorite- still pretty fun and easy to get into. Club level I hardly ever do. Terrace level is fun, but sometimes can be hard to follow the game. But  tickets are cheap for terrace."
Brewers,37fr8x,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed May 27 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"loge infield box seats on the visitor side (left side) are always nice, they're somewhat pricey (50-75 per) compared to the usual seats, but if you're tripping from NY, price clearly isn't an issue."

I get injuries hurt a lot. Perhaps it is because they know their season is over already? And they are just trying to ""get through"" the next 120 games?"
Brewers,3791kr,madman86,2,Tue May 26 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of pitching underperforming at this point, especially the guys getting the big money it seems.  Lack of timely hitting has been a pretty big issue at times as well."
Brewers,3791kr,necropaw,1 point,Tue May 26 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"In April everything was awful. The pitching sucked, they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a bat and they were making, dumb, dumb mistakes.   The only difference now is that the hitting has come around, and the bullpen has become OK. But your starting rotation is still completely lost. Who would have thought that veteran pitchers would forget how to pitch simultaneously."

Brewers,3792mh,necropaw,3,Mon May 25 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"but he doesn't really seem to be ML ready right now.   Watch him throw an immaculate inning his first time out, then give up like 10 ER each of the next few.  Because thats pretty much brewers luck."
Brewers,3792mh,ksprzk,2,Tue May 26 01:18:38 2015 UTC,The fact that we don't have 1 SP in the minors that would be ML ready should terrify us all.
Brewers,3792mh,MasterCashier,2,Tue May 26 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there's Thornburg. I haven't kept an eye on what he's been doing since he got sent down, but that's about it. This is a big reason why a lot of people were counting the Brewers out before the season started. There's no depth to our pitching rotation. 0 depth. Literally no one. In the past, we've always had Estrada, Fiers, Nelson, and others ready to step in, but now they're either already in the rotation or off the team."
Brewers,3792mh,Valleyoan,1 point,Tue May 26 15:07:30 2015 UTC,We have Taylor Jungmann. He would be the next in line and is almost ML ready. I haven't seen what he has done this year though.
Brewers,3792mh,TweetPoster,1 point,Tue May 26 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"Not good. Not good at all. 6.9 ERA, 1.62 WHIP.  Best AAA starter has been Tyler Cravy @ 4.6 ERA and 1.37 WHIP.  The PCL, and Colorado Springs for that matter, is an absolute joke though. I've watched almost every AAA game, the strike zone is the size of a 50-cent piece. I'll go from the AAA to the Big league game and the difference in strike zone size is extremely fucking irritating for the AAA guys. It's no surprise every ones numbers are up. Jungmann was nearly 3/1 K/BB ratio and Cravy 4/1 last year. Now they're both around 2/1...  They're both top 15 in K in the PCL though, Jungmann at #8 and Cravy @ 14. But Cravy throws tomorrow and 5 K's separate him and 6th on that list, so despite the miniscule strike zone they're still getting batters to swing and miss. Therefore, I think there's something worthy of a call-up somewhere between the two of them.   Also, the AAA team defensively is fucking disgusting as well. Guess that's what happens when the entire team is old (3rd oldest roster position player wise) and slow. Worst part is, the numbers don't speak to this statement, because a lot of balls that should be getting caught or played well, are misplayed and ruled as hits. Again screwing the pitchers."

Brewers,377krf,the_bum_on_the_bus,2,Mon May 25 19:54:22 2015 UTC,that sounds good.  I should get some of my local krauts to do so (i live in germany ;) ).
Brewers,377krf,TheBause,2,Mon May 25 19:57:40 2015 UTC,Awesome!
Brewers,377krf,the_bum_on_the_bus,3,Mon May 25 20:00:12 2015 UTC,He is a legend around here. :)
Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,2,Mon May 25 19:53:39 2015 UTC,he should be.  I think his announcing in Major League (when I first heard of him) was the best part of the movie.

Brewers,377krf,Il_Tenente,2,Mon May 25 19:32:49 2015 UTC,Phil Cuzzi?  That was such a BS ejection.

Brewers,377krf,TheBause,2,Mon May 25 19:17:34 2015 UTC,If I were Davis I would've walked onto the plate with both feet and looked at Bochy.
Brewers,377krf,riverwestmke,1 point,Mon May 25 19:17:04 2015 UTC,Was in class. Did not expect this...
Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,8,Mon May 25 19:16:34 2015 UTC,How about a new sidebar pic of Davis stepping right in the middle of home plate?
Brewers,377krf,xsists,2,Mon May 25 19:15:17 2015 UTC,Yes please
Brewers,377krf,fly1ngorb,4,Mon May 25 19:16:15 2015 UTC,Fucking hilarious

Brewers,377krf,BrewCityChaser,3,Mon May 25 19:13:51 2015 UTC,Hit home plate!
Brewers,377krf,BrewCrewKevin,5,Mon May 25 19:13:44 2015 UTC,TOUCH HOME KHRIS

Brewers,377krf,Il_Tenente,1 point,Mon May 25 19:16:00 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you appeal the call that late. I mean Braun was already in the box FFS.
Brewers,377krf,tacoguy1234,6,Mon May 25 19:00:25 2015 UTC,I think every team would call out the other team for not touching home if they saw it.  Davis is just super dumb for making it that close.
Brewers,377krf,The_hezy,1 point,Mon May 25 18:52:54 2015 UTC,What a stupid fucking rule... He hit it out. Who cares if he touches any of the bases.
Brewers,377krf,xsists,3,Mon May 25 22:19:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't think so. Counsell seems like a good guy.
Brewers,377krf,MyHorseIsAmazinger,1 point,Mon May 25 18:51:24 2015 UTC,Oh yea didn't Carlos Gomez already set precedent last year vs the Braves/McCann that you don't have to touch home plate for it to be a home run?
Brewers,377krf,Briarsaunt,2,Mon May 25 18:46:03 2015 UTC,I think the McCann interference had something to do with that though.
Brewers,377krf,jn2010,1 point,Mon May 25 18:54:31 2015 UTC,welp I'll take it
Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Mon May 25 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Observation from 231: every time Lincecum throws to first, the third baseman moves back toward the base (from his shifted position) in case the throw back to the pitcher isn't caught."
Brewers,377krf,The_hezy,2,Mon May 25 18:43:13 2015 UTC,Lol @ Braun fucking with Lincecum
Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,2,Mon May 25 18:42:37 2015 UTC,Braun stealing bases is a thing of beauty

Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,12,Mon May 25 18:45:07 2015 UTC,I want the next Brewer to homer to fucking lick home plate
Brewers,377krf,xsists,8,Mon May 25 18:38:33 2015 UTC,I hope every home run we got the rest of the game finishes with the Prince Fielder shockwave celebration. No doubt he touches the plate then!  Edit: Davis didn't :-(  Edit: neither did Braun :-(
Brewers,377krf,cafe_anon,1 point,Mon May 25 18:37:50 2015 UTC,Didn't we do that vs the Giants too and they got super ticked and hit Fielder in spring training?
Brewers,377krf,tacoguy1234,1 point,Mon May 25 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Hit him opening day. I believe it was Cain who told the press he was going to do it. Should've been suspended for it.
Brewers,377krf,fly1ngorb,7,Mon May 25 18:52:12 2015 UTC,I want to see Braun hit a HR and walk from third to home while maintaining direct eye contact with Bruce Brochy.
Brewers,377krf,jn2010,3,Mon May 25 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Fuck off umpires, thanks for wasting 7 mins of my life"
Brewers,377krf,Tuxedo38,3,Mon May 25 18:37:09 2015 UTC,Well that was a giant waste of fucking time.  I hope Braun goes yard and makes a point to step on home.

Brewers,377krf,adam7765,3,Mon May 25 18:35:04 2015 UTC,They said Davis didn't touch home plate on the home run.
Brewers,377krf,KQ2eZPackers,2,Mon May 25 18:35:41 2015 UTC,I think he got the heel down.  Please have the heel down.
Brewers,377krf,smiles134,0,Mon May 25 18:34:59 2015 UTC,His heal touches the corner. I don't know how people think he didn't
Brewers,377krf,xsists,-3,Mon May 25 18:34:48 2015 UTC,This is very unprofessional of the Giants.
Brewers,377krf,brewcrew2_2,-1,Mon May 25 18:34:02 2015 UTC,No its not. Just a smart play on their part. Idiotic on Davis' part

Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,2,Sun May 24 18:28:29 2015 UTC,Finally getting the hard slider down.
Brewers,373ehm,theamazingkiwi,2,Sun May 24 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"If that wasn't Maybin, it could have been a triple play"
Brewers,373ehm,brewcrew2_2,2,Sun May 24 18:24:33 2015 UTC,Lol all the Braves chose the same walk-up song...that's awkward
Brewers,373ehm,the_bum_on_the_bus,2,Sun May 24 18:23:53 2015 UTC,Huge double play. HUGE.
Brewers,373ehm,theamazingkiwi,2,Sun May 24 18:23:49 2015 UTC,This anthem is the worst
Brewers,373ehm,brewersfan412,1 point,Sun May 24 18:21:55 2015 UTC,Tight zone today
Brewers,373ehm,11b328i,1 point,Sun May 24 18:19:58 2015 UTC,The Braves radio announcers sure talk a lot of shit and bitch s lot.
Brewers,373ehm,the_bum_on_the_bus,2,Sun May 24 18:15:26 2015 UTC,I was just thinking that. Cocky sons-a-bitches.
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,1 point,Sun May 24 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if your team is .500 you really can't talk shit. At least you shouldn't."
Brewers,373ehm,silentjay01,1 point,Sun May 24 18:26:50 2015 UTC,Start of the third: any predictions on who's going to get the first hit for the Brewers?
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,3,Sun May 24 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"Nelson with a home run. Brewers win 1-0.  Edit: Well, it wasn't a home run..."
Brewers,373ehm,theamazingkiwi,2,Sun May 24 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Well, he got the hit"
Brewers,373ehm,silentjay01,3,Sun May 24 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well, you got the player right, just not the distance."
Brewers,373ehm,silentjay01,1 point,Sun May 24 18:13:58 2015 UTC,I think Nelson would have to throw 8 innings for that to happen.
Brewers,373ehm,silentjay01,2,Sun May 24 18:12:48 2015 UTC,I'm picking Lind.
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,2,Sun May 24 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"Nice to know we could lose Ramirez, Lind, and maybe even Segura and not be screwed in the infield."
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,2,Sun May 24 18:09:50 2015 UTC,Hee hee. AJ mad.
Brewers,373ehm,fly1ngorb,2,Sun May 24 18:04:43 2015 UTC,Damn AJ is slow.
Brewers,373ehm,KQ2eZPackers,2,Sun May 24 18:04:38 2015 UTC,That pitch basically ended up being a pitch out. No chance for Maybin
Brewers,373ehm,the_bum_on_the_bus,2,Sun May 24 17:50:44 2015 UTC,Another beautiful pick-off. Damn Maldy ate his Wheaties this morning!

Brewers,373ehm,brewersfan412,1 point,Sun May 24 17:36:23 2015 UTC,That works. Could you post a link
Brewers,373ehm,the_bum_on_the_bus,3,Sun May 24 17:37:53 2015 UTC,Afternoon fellas.   Anyone happen to find a stream link from the home-town boys?
Brewers,373ehm,brewersfan412,2,Sun May 24 17:31:55 2015 UTC,stream link?
Brewers,373ehm,brewcrew26,1 point,Sun May 24 17:31:03 2015 UTC,I second this request
Brewers,373ehm,jn2010,6,Sun May 24 17:34:38 2015 UTC,This is the first brewer game I've been to since leaving Wisconsin. And I promise you guys a win!
Brewers,373ehm,TheBause,2,Sun May 24 17:27:35 2015 UTC,why no braun
Brewers,373ehm,TheBause,4,Sun May 24 17:03:20 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's just a rest day.
Brewers,373ehm,TheBause,0,Sun May 24 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, u right."
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,0,Sun May 24 17:05:11 2015 UTC,don't start with me.
Brewers,373ehm,jn2010,0,Sun May 24 17:14:41 2015 UTC,Y?
Brewers,373ehm,brewcrew2_2,0,Sun May 24 17:46:58 2015 UTC,I thought you were being condescending?
Brewers,373ehm,DamienSalvation,0,Sun May 24 18:08:29 2015 UTC,Nope. Just agreeing with you lol.
Brewers,373ehm,AemenLeny,0,Sun May 24 18:10:39 2015 UTC,lol gotcha

Brewers,373ehm,TheBause,1 point,Sun May 24 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I get to day drink and watch the Brewers!  I would have been day drinking anyway, but the Brewers are a bonus."
Brewers,373ehm,desertcombat06,1 point,Sun May 24 16:25:50 2015 UTC,Chance to go .500 on the road trip and our two most prestigious bats are on the bench.  This is Roenicke all over again.
Brewers,373ehm,TweetsInCommentsBot,0,Sun May 24 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"We need tradeable pieces, not to go .500 on a road trip. Gotta keep our guys healthy."
Brewers,373ehm,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun May 24 17:29:10 2015 UTC,That's the rub. We want our tradeable pieces to produce to get more value but when they do it gives hope for what this team can do. Hardest season in a long time for Crew fans.
Brewers,373ehm,theamazingkiwi,2,Sun May 24 18:46:00 2015 UTC,Counsell says it's a matter of days for both Segura and Lucroy
Brewers,3734jg,adam7765,3,Sun May 24 12:42:11 2015 UTC,"In the words of Bob Wiley ""baby steps"""

Brewers,3734jg,optifroculon,3,Sun May 24 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"Why not bring Ben Sheets out of retirement to try and get him his 100th win? He's sitting at 94, it would sound almost like a plot to a movie."
Brewers,3734jg,Il_Tenente,2,Sun May 24 17:08:23 2015 UTC,I'd go to his games. I was there when he came out of the dug out after his Olympics win before he played for us. He was a total goofball and a good guy to root for.
Brewers,3734jg,Guano_Loco,1 point,Sun May 24 17:55:48 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see Sheets come back!
Brewers,3734jg,cweb96,1 point,Wed May 27 20:10:19 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see Sheets come back!
Brewers,3734jg,cweb96,0,Wed May 27 22:43:47 2015 UTC,"The loss column is the one that counts.  You cant make up losses, and the Reds are 4 games ahead in the loss column.  They are playing better, but they need to start that fire sale as soon as possible.  The sooner they begin, the sooner it ends."
Brewers,3734jg,workthrowaway68,0,Sun May 24 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"My realistic goal is fewer than 90 losses.  The Brewers have a streak of ten seasons without a 90-loss season.  Only the Yankees, Blue Jays, Angels, Athletics, Phillies and Cardinals have longer streaks than that.  I think as a bottom five team in terms of market size this is a streak to take a little pride in."
Brewers,371hy6,fly1ngorb,7,Sun May 24 00:03:59 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no reason for Kintzler to be in the majors. He should have been cut/sent down a week ago.
Brewers,371hy6,The_Bostache,3,Sun May 24 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"He's so unclutch. He's solid in middle innings, or 3, 4, run games but awful in big time situations"
Brewers,371hy6,SocksandSmocks,2,Sun May 24 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"I just don't trust a guy that loses velocity. I mean he doesn't have good command and then couple that with his diminishing velocity, not good."
Brewers,371hy6,The_Bostache,-2,Sun May 24 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every guy in our BP is unclutch, except K-Rod, and that's why he's the save guy."
Brewers,371hy6,CJL13,2,Sun May 24 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't know we could still put ""clutch"" and K-Rod in the same sentence."
Brewers,371hy6,cookster123,1 point,Sun May 24 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"But he does keep you on the edge of your seat, that's for sure."
Brewers,371hy6,odie4evr,4,Tue May 26 22:27:41 2015 UTC,"There's no reason we should have nine men left on base or only two runs with ten hits either. Yeah, Kintzler is pretty unclutch, but if our offense produces, he doesn't even see the game."
Brewers,371hy6,machiavellism,4,Sun May 24 00:16:03 2015 UTC,Head over to /r/kcroyals  They're good people.
Brewers,371hy6,jn2010,2,Sun May 24 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"I've been gone for a while, since when did we become Royals fans?"
Brewers,371hy6,cookster123,1 point,Sun May 24 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"Since they hung out here to root for us beating the tigers for them, and now they play the Cardinals."

Brewers,371hy6,Infamous_potato,3,Sun May 24 00:06:18 2015 UTC,What are your plans for New Year's Eve?
Brewers,371hy6,whispen2,2,Sun May 24 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Had our chances. Also, still can't stand fucking kintzler"
Brewers,371hy6,SocksandSmocks,0,Sun May 24 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"Shit the bed twice with guys on third, have a potential game-ending ball hit the 3rd base ump. But no we don't suck, we're just ""Unlucky."""

Brewers,371hy6,DamienSalvation,-2,Sun May 24 00:11:36 2015 UTC,So we lost a game. We are still playing better than we were in the beginning of the year and we weren't exactly expecting a playoff caliber team.

Brewers,37065g,CJL13,1 point,Sun May 24 00:04:41 2015 UTC,How does losing this game prove we are bad?
Brewers,37065g,brewersfan412,1 point,Sun May 24 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"It proves our bullpen (Kintz) is shit, but overall our team hasn't performed ""bad""."
Brewers,37065g,ShoopALoop11,1 point,Sun May 24 00:07:25 2015 UTC,Our bullpen was actually pretty good except for Kintz; you can't expect them to never give up a run.
Brewers,37065g,brewersfan412,1 point,Sun May 24 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"bullpen did their job, but we had to put in Kintzler..."

Brewers,37065g,CJL13,3,Sun May 24 00:06:11 2015 UTC,It was an extra inning away game; the odds weren't in our favor. It was still a good game.
Brewers,37065g,brewersfan412,2,Sun May 24 00:10:09 2015 UTC,It was a good game
Brewers,37065g,brewersfan412,3,Sun May 24 00:04:33 2015 UTC,I hate kintzler
Brewers,37065g,SocksandSmocks,2,Sun May 24 00:03:53 2015 UTC,Annnnd he fucking blew it
Brewers,37065g,ShoopALoop11,4,Sun May 24 00:03:47 2015 UTC,We've been Kintz'd.
Brewers,37065g,TheBause,1 point,Sun May 24 00:03:35 2015 UTC,Seriously though I like our chances (of a clean inning) a hell of a lot more with that girl pitching from the AT&T commercial than Kintz.
Brewers,37065g,ShoopALoop11,1 point,Sun May 24 00:03:34 2015 UTC,Has anyone else noticed a streak of hits after Kranitz has visited the mound?
Brewers,37065g,jn2010,2,Sun May 24 00:03:19 2015 UTC,Extra-inning road games are the worst!!

Brewers,37065g,SocksandSmocks,3,Sun May 24 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"Well, that was a break."
Brewers,37065g,TheBause,2,Sun May 24 00:00:10 2015 UTC,Have we turned a DP yet today?  They should do that.
Brewers,37065g,jn2010,1 point,Sat May 23 23:57:46 2015 UTC,The bullpen is a time bomb.  Hurry before it explodes.
Brewers,37065g,fly1ngorb,3,Sat May 23 23:57:09 2015 UTC,"Kintz, I fucking swear. Dont blow this shit."

Brewers,37065g,jn2010,3,Sat May 23 23:49:44 2015 UTC,Having a neutral broadcast team is a nice change of pace.
Brewers,37065g,jn2010,1 point,Sat May 23 23:46:53 2015 UTC,My body is ready.
Brewers,37065g,Free_Willy24,2,Sat May 23 23:45:20 2015 UTC,You can't spell Knebel without K.  Or something.

Brewers,37065g,jn2010,1 point,Sat May 23 23:45:28 2015 UTC,Nice!
Brewers,37065g,pfelon,2,Sat May 23 23:47:10 2015 UTC,Wow.  That went from a really shaky start to a damn fine inning for Knebal.
Brewers,37065g,jn2010,2,Sat May 23 23:43:20 2015 UTC,That was awesome.
Brewers,37065g,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sat May 23 23:42:16 2015 UTC,This guy reminds me of Manny Parra.
Brewers,37065g,Redtitwhore,3,Sat May 23 23:42:13 2015 UTC,That could be great or absolutely terrible

Brewers,37065g,fly1ngorb,2,Sat May 23 23:34:20 2015 UTC,He fucking smoked that right to a first baseman playing in.  So fucking unlucky.

Brewers,37065g,SocksandSmocks,1 point,Sat May 23 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Broxton could pitch the next 10 innings scoreless and hit the game winning run and he still wouldn't redeem himself.

Brewers,37065g,TheBause,1 point,Sat May 23 22:10:55 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they're pinch hitting.  Fiers has been pitching very well and our bullpen hasn't.

Brewers,36y56w,necropaw,6,Sat May 23 02:32:15 2015 UTC,That's actually pretty common.  These guys know when they have to go hard into the base.  He clearly didn't' have to.  They'll often clear the base path for people coming behind them.

Brewers,36y56w,Tuxedo38,4,Sat May 23 02:33:10 2015 UTC,Starting pitchers have to go at least 5 innings.  Wily left with an injury after the 4th.  Sucks.

Brewers,36y56w,necropaw,3,Sat May 23 02:40:05 2015 UTC,I'm very disappointed there was nobody there. Even when we lose we do a post game.
Brewers,36y56w,zayde199,1 point,Sat May 23 02:45:29 2015 UTC,Is the Braves sub one of the smallest?
Brewers,36y56w,Tuxedo38,1 point,Sat May 23 05:11:01 2015 UTC,It's the 3rd largest actually
Brewers,36wb5b,smiles134,11,Fri May 22 17:30:39 2015 UTC,Eight seems like a bit much.
Brewers,36wb5b,machiavellism,3,Fri May 22 17:36:28 2015 UTC,Michael Pineda got suspended 10 games last year for the neck incident.
Brewers,36wb5b,BlankJebus,13,Fri May 22 17:38:34 2015 UTC,as a starting pitcher. Which is essentially 2 starts max.
Brewers,36wb5b,machiavellism,7,Fri May 22 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's a starting pitcher. At most he's missing two starts, whereas a reliever could easily make four or five appearances in that time."
Brewers,36wb5b,leftwingriot,3,Fri May 22 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"If you look at it by number of innings it's costing him, it makes a lot more sense. 2 starts to Pineda could be upwards of 14 innings while a few appearances to Smith is probably only 4 or 5."
Brewers,36wb5b,BrewCrewKevin,20,Fri May 22 18:20:01 2015 UTC,8 games is fucking ridiculous.
Brewers,36wb5b,allonbacuth,6,Fri May 22 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate and question the rule a little bit...  Rosin is allowed on the mound. There is a rosin bag there for pitchers to use.  Sunscreen, I have to believe, is allowed on the mound. Players are allowed to wear sunscreen to protect themselves from the sun.  So how is a mixture of 2 legal substances... a foreign substance?  I mean, in this case it was pretty clear intent since it's a big glob on his gloved arm. But where is the line there? If the sunscreen was spread out a little more, he could argue he just applied sunscreen, right?"
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,15,Fri May 22 19:47:58 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, a mixture of legal substances makes meth, an illegal substance. Not that that's entirely related, but still...  Who knows. Maybe it wasn't really rosin and sunscreen. It was clear it was there for him to use as an advantage. He didn't argue being thrown out, he was just mad."
Brewers,36wb5b,madman86,2,Fri May 22 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"Its a specific kind of sunscreen, that when mixed with rosin becomes very sticky. I'm sure there are not rules about sunscreen and rosin, but there are blanket rules about the stickiness (there is for sure a better word) of substances that pitchers can apply to their hands."
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,4,Sat May 23 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"8 games is way too fucking much. You give Pineda 10 games, that's one start. You are costing Smith at least 4-5 appearances. Especially since it wasn't pine tar either..."
Brewers,36wb5b,aresef,2,Fri May 22 17:39:10 2015 UTC,What was it?
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,2,Fri May 22 18:18:26 2015 UTC,A mixture of sunscreen and rosin. Pine Tar would have been much darker.
Brewers,36wb5b,aresef,2,Fri May 22 18:24:18 2015 UTC,Letter of the rules say it doesn't matter if it was pine tar or super glue. Just has to be a foreign substance.
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,2,Fri May 22 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but this rule needs to go. Everybody does it and it doesn't make sense to single out ones who are ""a little more obvious"". If both the batters and pitchers don't care why not just get rid of the rule?"
Brewers,36wb5b,aresef,2,Fri May 22 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Because umpires need latitude to toss guys for throwing spitballs and such. Perhaps the law could be tweaked, but teams would have to ask for something like that when Manfred is done with his stupid pace of game bullshit."
Brewers,36wb5b,THECrew42,3,Fri May 22 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"It helps with grip, not making pitches any better. Ask Carlos Gomez, Jean Segura, and Giancarlo Stanton about pitchers losing their grip."
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,2,Fri May 22 19:25:42 2015 UTC,I buy that. Hitters probably buy that too. But any rule adjustment should acknowledge what pitchers are already doing but avoid creating a new loophole players and managers can exploit.
Brewers,36wb5b,aresef,2,Fri May 22 19:37:19 2015 UTC,What's wrong with pace of play?
Brewers,36wb5b,THECrew42,3,Fri May 22 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Baseball is a game that is meant to take it's time. It shouldn't be sped up so younger people can not lose their attention. If they aren't going to pay attention to a 2 hour and 50 minute game, they aren't going to watch a 3 hour and 20 minute game.   EDIT: I realized I should have said that the other way around. Oh well, my point still stands, a half hour isn't going to make a difference."
Brewers,36wb5b,MasterCashier,3,Fri May 22 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"Baseball will not attract more fans by shortening games. People who don't like baseball just don't like baseball. Baseball shouldn't add clocks just to mollify them, because that won't do it. All it serves to do is piss off traditionalists."
Brewers,36wb5b,solumized,2,Fri May 22 19:35:23 2015 UTC,Why does it matter if traditionalists are pissed off?  Any rule change pisses off traditionalists.
Brewers,36wb5b,KEM10,1 point,Fri May 22 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"Not any rule makes traditionalists mad. Rules that help better the game are widely accepted. Only rules that hurt the integrity of the game are rejected. Pace of play happens to be one of those rules. They are changing the game to be something that isn't as good as before. Another example in my mind is the play at the plate. I think that rule should have stayed the way it was, the reason that rule changed was because Buster Posey tried to make a play he shouldn't have made."
Brewers,36wb5b,solumized,5,Fri May 22 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"In light of this incident, I have come up with a new job for MLB.  His title will be Mr. Obvious...You can call him captain of course.  His main job will be to check each and every pitcher that comes out of the bull pen for anything that can ""obviously"" be seen.  I will gladly be the first person to try this new job out.  And, I will do it for a lot less money than the pitchers would lose with suspensions.  I think $100k a season should be just fine."
Brewers,36wb5b,Iamthepirateking,1 point,Fri May 22 18:42:45 2015 UTC,It will only work if there is one Captain per game (how can you watch SF if you're in NY?). I will graciously fall on this sword with you for the betterment of my summer with paid games baseball.
Brewers,36wb5b,CJL13,2,Fri May 22 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking.  You would travel with the team, like a trainer, but you would be the ""guard"" before the bullpen door.  This creates 30 (well 28 now because of you and I) new job opportunities, as well as an ""insurance policy"" of sorts for teams to not have to endure the embarrassment of being caught.  Edit:  During ""off season"", same people can be employed with NFL to ensure all equipment is proper before going out on the field. I.E. shirt tucked it, proper kicking ball, correct psi...etc."

Brewers,36x0ia,MasterCashier,7,Sat May 23 00:59:53 2015 UTC,The Brewers have seen 104 pitches thru 4 innings.  Four
Brewers,36x0ia,messejueller21,3,Sat May 23 00:58:29 2015 UTC,Fuck the haters! It's still just damn fun watching a Ryan Braun AB.
Brewers,36x0ia,solumized,3,Sat May 23 00:57:54 2015 UTC,BA just said most runs in an inning all year.
Brewers,36x0ia,solumized,2,Sat May 23 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"Aw, its over.  9 runs on 6 hits today lol"
Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,6,Sat May 23 00:54:48 2015 UTC,what's this feeling? I'm having fun watching the brewers?!
Brewers,36x0ia,necropaw,2,Sat May 23 00:53:56 2015 UTC,Did Braun have like 6 RBI at the end of April?  Damn.

Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,1 point,Sat May 23 00:51:52 2015 UTC,Here's the website for the league.  Pretty widespread. Games sometimes get on ESPN.

Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,1 point,Sat May 23 00:44:02 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on the our draft?
Brewers,36x0ia,necropaw,2,Sat May 23 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"At first, I didn't understand it.  I still don't understand taking a WR in the 3rd.  But our team is built around the offense scoring a lot of points to force opponents to abandon the run.  Our draft kind of confirmed that.  Also, everyone we took have good special teams skills.  That was also a big consideration with each choice."
Brewers,36x0ia,jn2010,2,Sat May 23 00:49:21 2015 UTC,Yeah the ST angle was one I didn't consider until later but it's so important considering how awful we've been in that aspect
Brewers,36x0ia,silentjay01,2,Sat May 23 00:52:05 2015 UTC,Conformist.

Brewers,36x0ia,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sat May 23 00:49:24 2015 UTC,Hey.  It's all good if that was your intention.  I just got a bad vibe from some of the comments tonight.  They've felt aggressive rather than playful.  I'm sorry if I misinterpreted.
Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,2,Sat May 23 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, this happens to me alot lol. Maybe it's because I'm sober."
Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,2,Sat May 23 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Well there's your problem.  But seriously, that's been a problem for me as well.  (the misunderstanding of my comments, not the alcohol)  A deadpan delivery and a bitchy resting face will do that.  Don't sweat it."
Brewers,36x0ia,jn2010,2,Sat May 23 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm actually pretty shy/mellow in real life, so most of my humor is met with confusion. I think I'm hilarious though, that's all that matters... at least that's what I tell myself."
Brewers,36x0ia,BlankJebus,1 point,Sat May 23 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, that's what matters!  You've been great in this sub this year.  Don't listen to the opinion of one drunken asshole who wrongly took offense to some innocuous statements (that's me)."

Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,3,Sat May 23 00:40:35 2015 UTC,When's the last time we got a bases-loaded walk?
Brewers,36x0ia,necropaw,3,Sat May 23 00:42:07 2015 UTC,Heh.
Brewers,36x0ia,SocksandSmocks,2,Sat May 23 00:40:03 2015 UTC,oh sheeeeeeeit. Top of the order

Brewers,36vpzu,smiles134,12,Fri May 22 15:11:09 2015 UTC,I would be extremely mad if we did. There's no fucking excuse. Smith was a fucking idiot and deserved to be tossed.
Brewers,36vpzu,TheBause,4,Fri May 22 15:07:28 2015 UTC,"Smith was absolutely an idiot. Given, if Counsell sees any Braves pitcher doing anything that resembles getting at some pine tar, you know that he'll call him out."

Brewers,36vpzu,FriendlyFreeman,3,Fri May 22 18:53:21 2015 UTC,I'm against beaning a player in this scenario. But I would have no problem if one of our guys accidentally fires a 4-seamer into the dugout in the direction of Fredi Gonzalez.
Brewers,36vpzu,wegettacos,3,Fri May 22 16:19:02 2015 UTC,Man do people really think we would sink so low? We're truly hated in this league.
Brewers,36vpzu,CJL13,3,Fri May 22 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Which really makes no sense. Besides 2011 and like 3/4 of last year, we're never even relevant..."
Brewers,36vpzu,smiles134,-6,Fri May 22 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"The channel 12 sports director is calling for it on 540am ESPN and I fucking agree. I want them to plunk a dude right in the ass. Nothing to injure a guy, but as a fuck you. I miss when this team had some edge. I miss T-Plush. Between Braun and Gomez, yes the Brewers are hated. So fuck it, say hello to the bad guy."
Brewers,36vpzu,AemenLeny,2,Fri May 22 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. Staring down homers, getting chirpy and showing emotion on the field is VERY different than plunking people.   If they go down that road all the respect I have for Counsell is immediately gone. Not getting involved in beanball war bullshit was the thing that I liked about RRR the most."
Brewers,36vpzu,DEUCE_SLUICE,2,Fri May 22 18:03:25 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aarwqj6U2JU  This is how you do it.

Brewers,36vpzu,necropaw,1 point,Fri May 22 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"Intentionally hitting someone is the fucking stupidest part of baseball.  Let's see:  1) You could be off aim and hit someone in the face 2) If you hit them where you want to hit them, great, now you have a runner on base. 3) In this situation, you will likely get ejected and then suspended. Cool, really hurting the other team here. 4) Hitting someone isn't the end of it. If your pitchers will hit someone on purpose, the other team's will as well. You're just opening your own players to potential injury. 5) Could lead to a brawl, which will result in more suspensions and potential injuries.  How does that help your team in any way? No. The best way to retaliate is by not retaliating at all. Win the fucking game and move along. Like Counsell said, taking the series is the best retaliation."
Brewers,36vpzu,smiles134,1 point,Fri May 22 17:37:21 2015 UTC,Stop being one of the reasons we can't have nice things.
Brewers,36vpzu,desertcombat06,3,Fri May 22 19:11:17 2015 UTC,We don't retaliate ever.  There's not even a reason to write this article.
Brewers,36vpzu,brewcrew2_2,3,Fri May 22 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"The asshole part of me wants to play some bean ball, but it wouldn't be a very smart thing to do.  Whether you agree with the rule or not, whether everyone does it or not, it's still the rule and Smith broke it."
Brewers,36vpzu,jn2010,2,Fri May 22 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt mind if we caught one of their pitchers doing it (especially if its as common as people are claiming it is), but yeah...plunking a guy because of it would be silly."
Brewers,36vpzu,necropaw,1 point,Fri May 22 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"No, they shouldn't.  But they better have a guy watching each pitcher before the pitch to see if he keeps putting his throwing hand somewhere on his body to pick up any foreign substances."
Brewers,36vpzu,silentjay01,0,Fri May 22 16:58:27 2015 UTC,I cant help but disagree. However that is only my OPINION

Brewers,36vw2k,Thornbrow,2,Fri May 22 18:07:19 2015 UTC,Planned a camping trip out in CO and I'll be there as well!
Brewers,36vw2k,Thornbrow,1 point,Fri May 22 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"If you've never been to Coors Field before, it's pretty damn awesome. If you enjoy craft beer (I'm going to just assume you do), give yourself some time before and after to enjoy the plethora within walking distance of the field!  You've got River North, Great Divide, Epic, The Sandlot (where Blue Moon was first created, at Coors Field), Wynkoop, Jagged Mountain, Zephyr (newer, haven't been here yet), Ratio, Our Mutual Friend... those are all within 10 blocks of the field!"
Brewers,36vw2k,Thornbrow,2,Fri May 22 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, we will definitely be checking out the craft beer in the area. My must-see will be Breckenridge as that's one of my favorites, but to my knowledge they won't be doing any tours due to changing facilities. Cheers!"
Brewers,36vw2k,gromtown,1 point,Fri May 22 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think to include Breck! Breck's location next to the field is just a taproom and restaurant. Their actually brewery is on Kalamath, which is not really walking distance. I haven't actually been to the brewery before."
Brewers,36wsq2,silentjay01,3,Fri May 22 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"While I am a fan of Lucroy, I think with the way this season has gone, we need to just bite the bullet and go into full rebuild mode.  And that means entertaining offers for any player.  As soon as the Brewers put out word that Lucroy is on the block, the bidding will be furious."
Brewers,36wsq2,desertcombat06,2,Fri May 22 19:41:38 2015 UTC,I'd be sad to see him go if he is indeed traded elsewhere. I just got his jersey last year.
Brewers,36wsq2,BlankJebus,1 point,Fri May 22 20:30:06 2015 UTC,Same here.  I scored the All Star Jersey since I went to the game in the Twin Cities last year.
Brewers,36wsq2,workthrowaway68,0,Fri May 22 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"Id absolutely hate if they traded him. He is the one shining spot that came out of our farm system. I feel he's as much the face of the organization as Braun is. The fan base has been revitalized this month after being down all of April, trading him away would feel like they're giving up on the season and would be a huge downer for the team and the fans."

Brewers,36tv5h,gandaalf,2,Fri May 22 02:06:00 2015 UTC,That's because it's all been said. We suck/trade all the people. It's a tough year to be a Brewer fan.
Brewers,36tv5h,madman86,2,Fri May 22 02:06:51 2015 UTC,Sums up the Brewers. I say you did good.
Brewers,36tv5h,CJL13,2,Fri May 22 02:06:57 2015 UTC,There is literally no reason to keep any stars. Its becoming painfully obvious that this team is not very good.
Brewers,36tv5h,necropaw,2,Fri May 22 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"I personally cannot wait for the trades to start. Give these young guys a shot to show what they can do. They will play hard every day to try and make the team in the future. I'd love to see an infield of Gomez (3B), Segura (SS), Sardinas (2B), Lind (1B) with Herrara being the utility to give any of those guys a day off. And hell if they trade Lind, it'd be interesting to see what Rodgers aka mini-Prince can do at first."

Brewers,36tv5h,mistrbrownstone,-3,Fri May 22 02:41:56 2015 UTC,Craig Counsell: It happens everywhere in the league.  Way to make everyone hate our guts Counsell.  Now he's acting like the league is out to get us with all of the beanballs we've gotten. Yeah none of those were on purpose.
Brewers,36tv5h,KEM10,9,Fri May 22 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"Hes right though, and everyone knows it.  Fans can pretend like it doesnt, but theyre being ignorant.  Edit: not saying its right, but to pretend like its a unique thing is silly."
Brewers,36sbz1,brewisbrewin,8,Thu May 21 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Very happy to see this is confirmed by math. (Lol) It's seemed like he's hitting the ball hard all year, they'll start falling in soon I'm sure. But it really is great to see Braun driving the ball and PULLING it deep. He basically had to abandon his pulling of the ball, and that meant he lost a lot of power.   He's already have 10 homers this year, and he's hitting the ball hard and seeing it well right now. Those XBH will start dropping in too. Would love to see Braun get back to form and show the fans of Milwaukee and the rest of the league, that those PED's weren't the reason he was so great.  Edit: Spelling."
Brewers,36sbz1,jubjub2184,2,Thu May 21 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not to be dick, but isn't it possible he's doing PED's again? Anyways I love Braun and hope he keeps this up."
Brewers,36sbz1,unmisunderestimated,8,Thu May 21 20:43:18 2015 UTC,Anything is possible but it's more likely his thumb is actually allowing him to grip the bat without pain this year.
Brewers,36sbz1,nh984h439,11,Thu May 21 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"If you believe him, he only juiced to get through injuries. If he's healthy, he's not cheating.  Just look at the classic cases of guys that used for performance reasons, their bodies reflect the juice. Braun is as ""lanky"" as ever.  Edit: I do believe him myself and am a huge fanboy."

Brewers,36sbz1,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu May 21 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with this analysis is Braun, while he is hitting the ball quite hard often, is a fly ball/ground ball hitter. While his HR number were bound to go up (as outlined in this post) his BABIP might be a different story if he continues to not hit line drives."

Brewers,36smqb,CJL13,2,Fri May 22 01:17:28 2015 UTC,Yup..which means three or four more games where Cotts will be called on as the lefty :(

Brewers,36ojd7,tatertots87,2,Thu May 21 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be too difficult to make the mechanism work like the actual roof but I think the hard part would be ensuring you made the opening big enough. The fan style wouldn't leave quite as big of an opening to the cooking grates.  Also, you'd need to be conscious of the heat; I don't think traditional ball bearings would hold up but maybe some brass/graphite bearings would do the job."

Brewers,36ph4d,necropaw,4,Thu May 21 02:21:20 2015 UTC,Correct.  Winning 66% of our remaining games would put us at about 95 wins.  WATCH OUT BASEBALL

Brewers,36o343,jn2010,2,Thu May 21 01:45:18 2015 UTC,Why did we ever trade for Broxton? That was fucking stupid.
Brewers,36o343,jn2010,1 point,Thu May 21 01:44:19 2015 UTC,Broxton looks like a tank.  I want to see him check a runner down the 1st base line.

Brewers,36o343,jn2010,3,Thu May 21 00:47:54 2015 UTC,Close play.
Brewers,36o343,sikeston,3,Thu May 21 00:47:50 2015 UTC,I don't know. That was close. I fucking love baseball.
Brewers,36o343,jn2010,4,Thu May 21 00:47:35 2015 UTC,He's out. Don't think you could overturn it.
Brewers,36o343,jn2010,2,Thu May 21 00:47:24 2015 UTC,It was definitely close.  I agree that with what we saw you couldnt overturn it.
Brewers,36o343,fly1ngorb,3,Thu May 21 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"He might have been safe....  Edit: No, really.  Im not sure if that tag hit him."
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,5,Thu May 21 00:46:46 2015 UTC,"Damn, that was very close for a pitchout..."
Brewers,36o343,TheBause,4,Thu May 21 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"Whoofta, that was lucky.  Kinda felt like that right fielder could have tried a tad harder..."
Brewers,36o343,rustyknucklez,2,Thu May 21 00:45:43 2015 UTC,It's a dangerous play since the SS is running hard at it too.
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,3,Thu May 21 00:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats true.  Still, gotta call for it if you can get there."
Brewers,36o343,fly1ngorb,2,Thu May 21 00:47:39 2015 UTC,Yeah.
Brewers,36o343,jn2010,2,Thu May 21 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"Man, think of how many fewer pitches this guy would have had to have thrown.  He might be done after this inning now...."
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,1 point,Thu May 21 00:51:44 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  He's probably done after this and he might have had another few outs in him otherwise.  That could be big.
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,3,Thu May 21 00:53:28 2015 UTC,Is it safe to say I'm glad we don't have to face you guys again in the regular season? Can you mange to do to others what you did to us in this series?
Brewers,36o343,brewcrew2_2,3,Thu May 21 00:43:48 2015 UTC,I sure hope so.

Brewers,36o343,SolidRambo,4,Thu May 21 00:34:25 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is every player on their damn team like a streak of lightning down the first base line. Even routine plays are close. And I have no idea how that dude beat out that double play
Brewers,36o343,jn2010,2,Thu May 21 00:33:39 2015 UTC,That's what speed do? I never thought I would use that phrase when it came to the Tigers.
Brewers,36o343,TurboShorts,1 point,Thu May 21 00:35:24 2015 UTC,No kidding. I haven't watched the tigers at all this year until this series and their speed is crazy. I dont remember the tigers ever being a speed team.
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,4,Thu May 21 01:12:31 2015 UTC,The good news is we have their pitcher pretty high on the pitch count already.
Brewers,36o343,Redtitwhore,2,Thu May 21 00:33:14 2015 UTC,Good.  He's dealin.

Brewers,36o343,jn2010,3,Thu May 21 00:21:46 2015 UTC,Still don't understand how that wasn't a double play ball.

Brewers,36o343,fly1ngorb,5,Thu May 21 00:04:57 2015 UTC,It's good to see him finally pulling the ball a little bit.
Brewers,36o343,necropaw,3,Thu May 21 00:04:20 2015 UTC,That was my big argument on why it was the 'roids all along.  He didn't have the bat speed last year to turn on the ball like he just did.  Looks like I was wrong.
Brewers,36o343,sikeston,4,Thu May 21 00:06:07 2015 UTC,I thought that he was hiding a lat or oblique injury and that's why he wasn't hitting to left. This series though he has hit two big bombs to left and I like to see that. Now I would like to see some doubles return as well. I like the home runs but I'd like to see small ball too.
Brewers,36o343,smiles134,3,Thu May 21 00:08:30 2015 UTC,Braun finally looks back to form recently. Let's hope he keeps it up.

Brewers,36oak7,TurboShorts,1 point,Wed May 20 21:16:49 2015 UTC,Uhh what? Lol. What auction? This post is hilarious.
Brewers,36oak7,TurboShorts,1 point,Fri May 22 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"Charity auction they talked about a few times during the games. You can bid on some great things, such as being a reporter for a day, touring the roof at Miller Park, or doing pottery with Scooter Gennett."
Brewers,36nhm1,workthrowaway68,3,Wed May 20 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"I hate all this trade talk.  I got back into baseball last year since my GF is into it (was into it as a kid), so I haven't been through all this trade stuff.  I don't want to see any of them go.  Especially Gomez and Segura b/c I think they're the most fun to watch.  But lately some others have been a lot of fun to watch too.  Edit:  I don't mean to say I hate your post, as it's interesting to me.  I just mean I don't want to see some of my favorites get traded away."
Brewers,36nhm1,ultra242,0,Wed May 20 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the sad thing is that its not like the old days.  Players dont stay with the team that drafted or signed them, and its more of a bueiness now than a game that fans love to watch.  And the business side of things need to be addressed so that the product on the field can be worth watching year over year and hopefully someday be competitive and win championships.  But this year's team is a bad team, and they are only going to get worse in the near future.  So the way to make it better is to trade away known commodities and get bak big time young guys in return that can grow into productive, great players for when the team is ready to compete again in 5 plus years."
Brewers,36nhm1,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Wed May 20 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"In this case, I think the Red Sox are a great fit.   Why would Boston trade for a catcher when they have Christian Vasquez waiting in the wings? I know Vasquez's surgery is a major concern, but the dude still projects as a stud."
Brewers,36nhm1,necropaw,0,Thu May 21 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"If you can afford to give up the prospects because you are a large market club that can spend its way out of trouble, wouldn't you rather have the established catcher who is very cheap, and al all star at that, versus a guy who is projected as a stud?  I love prospects, but Lucroy's salary, his track record and the fact the Brewers aren't going to win with him, probably while he is with the team anymore, make him prime trade bait for a team that wants an upgrade at a position like catcher.  And Lucroy would be an upgrade for about 90% of the teams in the league."
Brewers,36nhm1,gimmesomespace,3,Thu May 21 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"This is one trade i know we could make a killing off of, but i'd never want to happen.  That being said, catchers get old quickly a lot of times, and if we can murder another team's farm system...bleh.  I know we should, but its hard to stomach.  It'd be similar to trading Aaron Rodgers to the fans of this state."
Brewers,36nhm1,necropaw,3,Wed May 20 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"I think their biggest problem trading lucroy is they would get crucified for it. Braun still leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth so Luc is the face of the franchise. If they trade him or Carlos, ticket sales will drop significantly and the front office will never hear the end of it."
Brewers,36nhm1,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu May 21 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"I think theyre going to have to trade Carlos in the last half year of his career.  Theres just no way they can pay him what hes going to make on the open market, you know?  Might as well get the potential next Gogo while theyre young."
Brewers,36nhm1,necropaw,2,Thu May 21 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"similar to trading Aaron Rodgers   I know you're just trying to make a point, but Lucroy is nowhere near Rodgers as far as popularity or production.  Letting him go would be much more rational than trading Rodgers, and I think fans would understand the move if we got a great haul for him.  Fans have to recognize that we're going to have to bid for this guy in a couple of years, and I'm not sure this organization should keep spending money on aging players."
Brewers,36nhm1,madman86,0,Wed May 20 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well think of it this way, even though the team isnt as bad right now, it would be like trading Geoff Jenkins or Ben Sheets in the early 00's.  Hes a good player on a bad team.  Its not like if you tried to trade Braun in 2012 or Feilder in 2008.  Rodgers is a multiple time MVP from a championship caliber team."
Brewers,36nhm1,gandaalf,1 point,Wed May 20 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"Again, not saying its the wrong thing to do, it'd just really suck for the fans."

Brewers,36hop8,nedoma56,3,Tue May 19 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really wish Miller Park could've been an open stadium, though I am definitely grateful for the dome.  I think Petco was the nicest stadium I've been to so far. Comerica was definitely the nicest I've seen a game at.   For as much as I love baseball, I'm like 98% sure I've only ever seen games at Miller Park and 1 game at Comerica. I've been outside of Wrigley, did a tour of the new Yankee Stadium, walked around and inside a bit of Petco, and I've been outside of the new Busch Stadium as well. I'm going down to Florida this summer, I might see a game at the Trop (yuck) or the new Marlins stadium."
Brewers,36hop8,smiles134,2,Tue May 19 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad list!  We've been to Miller park multiple times (usually 8-12 games/year), wrigley a couple times, Busch stadium (old and new) a couple of times, Minutemaid park in Houston, Both New York stadiums, Fenway last year for the opener, and... I think that's it. We try to hit 1 per year for an away game. Shooting for target field this year. And maybe US Cellular.  My dad always complained about that at Milwaukee County Stadium. It sucked to drive all the way down (from Appleton for me) when there's a chance of rain, because you don't know if you'll see a game. So I do like the roof. When there's bad weather, it doesn't deter me from games any more.  But the view sucks, and even with the open roof, it has a very enclosed feel to it. The concourse is all concrete and green painted steel, and has an industrial feel. Busch stadium is  beautiful. All outside, a great view of the skyline, and you walk onto the concourse, and it's like a mezanine on the outside of the stadium, and you can look down on to the streets. Sort of a ""porch"" feel to it. Beautiful."

Brewers,36hn03,workthrowaway68,4,Tue May 19 13:31:09 2015 UTC,"This analysis is probably spot on.  I still don't want to see Gomez go though, regardless of the reality of the situation.  It's easy to see the trade value of both Gomez and Lucroy, but don't you want to keep a few key pieces to rebuild around?  Granted, these two are about the only way we can get some good prospects into the system too...."
Brewers,36hn03,iheartschadenfreude,3,Tue May 19 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. Him and Luc are my favorite players, but they have to go if we want any chance at being good in the near future."
Brewers,36hn03,smiles134,0,Tue May 19 15:08:17 2015 UTC,"Well, my belief is that the team, if they do a solid rebuild, is at least 5 years away from contending again.  So to answer your question about retaining guys to rebuild around, my answer is that the guys like Braun, Lucroy and Gomez will all be past their prime at that time contention can happen again, so why hold onto guys who wont be useful when its time to condend again?  After I do one more of these posts for Lucroy, the guys who are left are the ones you keep around, like Peralta, Nelson, Davis, Segura.  Granted, those guys arent really a top notch core, but they are nice enough players to keep on hand while their value increases over those next 5 years, and when the team is on the upswing again, you deal them too when they get expensive.  Ijts just sort of how a true rebuild looks.  No one is safe."
Brewers,36hn03,gandaalf,2,Tue May 19 14:06:33 2015 UTC,I would be very upset if they didn't deal him by this year's trade deadline. They should be able to command a hefty price in exchange and there's no way we could afford him in 1.5 years

Brewers,36hn03,cweb96,1 point,Tue May 19 22:48:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it makes sense to trade Gomez during the 2015 season. Maybe at the deadline next year though...
Brewers,36hn03,Cubert_J_Farnsworth,1 point,Thu May 21 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"You do it now because his value decreases by trade deadline next year, not to mention the risk of him having an injury that impacts his speed or defense.  If you wait until 14 months from now, the return is nowhere near as good, and could potentially be almost nothing."
Brewers,36hn03,Cubert_J_Farnsworth,1 point,Fri May 22 03:01:04 2015 UTC,"I subscribe to receive a newsletter from the guy who runs mlbtraderumors.com and just got a newsletter on this topic with potential trades. I really like the idea of packaging Lohse with Gomez to bring back some young pitching. One of the options in the newsletter that really piqued my interest was a potential trade of Gomez to the Mariners for one of their highly touted pitching pieces, although the Mariner's outfield is a bit crowded right now. The trade I would maybe like to see that was suggested is Carlos Gomez packaged with Kyle Lohse for James Paxton/Taijuan Walker and maybe D.J. Peterson for 3rd or Alex Jackson for the outfield, although Jackson would be less likely.  Another option I saw that I thought was interesting was to the Angels  who are less stacked in the outfield. If we could package Lohse with Gomez to pull Andrew Heaney and Sean Newcomb I'd be more than happy.  TL;DR: Gomez + Lohse to bring back young pitching more interesting to me. Lohse + Garza to Jays for Paxton/Walker + DJ Peterson/maybe Alex Jackson, or Lohse + Garza to Angels for Heaney + Newcomb are some potential trades I like."
Brewers,36hn03,Cubert_J_Farnsworth,0,Tue May 19 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this last night a bit, and Carlos Gomez doesnt need to be packaged with Kyle Lohse to ""increase"" his trade value, or the value of the return from a trade partner.  Kyle Lohse being added to a trade like this would actually decrease the return because Lohse has a negative surplus value.  He makes too much money and doesnt justify his contract with production.  The Mariners do have a pretty crowded outfield, and with a healthy Austin Jackson, really have no need for a CF.  But they could use an upgrade if they made a playoff push,   DJ Peterson is more of a 1B though, but is definitely attainable in a trade for Gomez, and Walker might be attainable as well given his poor start to 2015.  But there is no way the Mariners trade away Alex Jackson right now.  And Newcomb/Heaney would be a very nice return as well for Gomez, but I just dont see it happening because the Angels dont really need a CF at this point, because they have best player in baseball at that spot."
Brewers,36hn03,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Wed May 20 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"I agree on Lohse, but I think that if we want that kind of pitching back we would have to include a SP with Gomez as the trade is going to thin out either teams rotation a bit, more so for the Mariners than the Angels I think. Maybe include Fiers instead? I'm hesitant on Peralta/Nelson but the rest of our SP seem like lame ducks in terms of trade potential to me.  I believe Jackson is having a down season this year, but he could be moved to a corner outfield position, as I think he was playing left field for Detroit? Not sure about that, though. It does seem like this is more likely to me than the Angels.  Also agree on Angels. I actually think I like Newcomb and Heaney more than Paxton/Walker, however the trade would require moving Trout to left/Gomez to left which would be more of a bother probably. Although, I think Trout played a little left field like last season, but I'm not sure how well that worked. I know the Angels had interest in Gennett earlier, although it would seem like that interest would have waned at least a bit by now. Maybe a package of Gomez and Gennett would be more interest than including Lohse? I think that the Angels would be OK without including an SP. Thinking about it I really like Heaney + Newcomb + a bit more for Gomez + Gennett, but I'm not sure how to make it work to be honest."
Brewers,36hn03,theamazingkiwi,0,Wed May 20 14:11:47 2015 UTC,"I am no fan of Fiers at all, but he is under team control still, and I would much rather keep warm, cheap bodies in place while a rebuild is undergone.  Plus I dont think he has a ton of value because of his lackluster stuff and inconsistency, and also his age."
Brewers,36fzn6,fly1ngorb,26,Tue May 19 02:22:26 2015 UTC,We're going to the playoffs.
Brewers,36fzn6,TheBause,16,Tue May 19 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"I love this sub.  After a win: ""We're going to the playoffs!""  After a loss: ""FIRESALE!""  I love it."
Brewers,36fzn6,BeHereNow91,14,Tue May 19 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"Realistically, I think most of this sub realizes we're taking apart this team soon enough."
Brewers,36fzn6,TheBause,11,Tue May 19 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, absolutely.  I just think its funny."
Brewers,36fzn6,AemenLeny,4,Tue May 19 02:33:00 2015 UTC,hehe.
Brewers,36fzn6,rustyknucklez,11,Tue May 19 02:34:24 2015 UTC,Congrats to Fiers. Hopefully this game restores some of his confidence. A close win against a good team can do great things for the clubhouse morale.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,2,Tue May 19 02:24:40 2015 UTC,Said the same thing after the first mets game...
Brewers,36fzn6,The_Courier,11,Tue May 19 14:48:08 2015 UTC,Just moved back to the great state of Wisconsin today. Really glad this was my first game back that I could watch on FSN.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,-25,Tue May 19 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Why, why would you come back. It's awful here (besides the sports)"
Brewers,36fzn6,rustyknucklez,15,Tue May 19 02:43:44 2015 UTC,It's amazing here.
Brewers,36fzn6,BubSwatPunt,-8,Tue May 19 02:57:22 2015 UTC,Yuck. Shitty weather ruins most of it for me.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,9,Tue May 19 02:59:37 2015 UTC,Summer is coming
Brewers,36fzn6,Cody1017,4,Tue May 19 03:10:27 2015 UTC,Most people don't even get to have 4 seasons where they live. We are lucky.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,-6,Tue May 19 03:32:07 2015 UTC,I don't want four seasons lol I want spring/summer and the ability to drive to winter or fall if I want to
Brewers,36fzn6,rustyknucklez,1 point,Tue May 19 03:46:59 2015 UTC,Move south then.
Brewers,36fzn6,teethteetheat,2,Tue May 19 15:51:50 2015 UTC,That's the plan. One more year until I finish school.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,3,Tue May 19 15:52:33 2015 UTC,Mainly because so I could buy New Glarus again
Brewers,36fzn6,SocksandSmocks,2,Tue May 19 03:08:07 2015 UTC,Check out Karben4 too! It's new and amazing.
Brewers,36fzn6,jn2010,0,Tue May 19 03:24:05 2015 UTC,Fair enough
Brewers,36fzn6,TheBause,12,Tue May 19 03:10:26 2015 UTC,Gogo too clutch. Also shoutout to gomez number 2 for standing tall on that last dp
Brewers,36fzn6,TurboShorts,12,Tue May 19 02:23:07 2015 UTC,Hell of a game.  7th inning magic.

Brewers,36fzn6,TheBause,6,Tue May 19 02:23:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  It makes me want to attend some KC game threads.
Brewers,36fzn6,indiemike,6,Tue May 19 02:40:19 2015 UTC,Maybe they can kill the cards for us :)
Brewers,36fzn6,necropaw,3,Tue May 19 02:48:23 2015 UTC,Drop on by anytime.
Brewers,36fzn6,UKroyalsfan,4,Tue May 19 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"Just noticed the Brewer's glove is an ""m"" on top of a ""b"". That is cool. Anyway, after I got mlb.tv, I had to pick some other teams besides the Royals to root for. You guys were my top pick because I love beer. The fact that you guys were playing the tigers tonight was just icing on the cake. I hope you guys sweep them. I am goign to have a lot of baseball to watch the next couple nights. Luckily, I can stream games at work. Watching the Royals, then you guys will make my 10 hour shift go by quick."
Brewers,36fzn6,brewcrew2_2,2,Tue May 19 10:45:51 2015 UTC,MB logo is best logo. We should just use it all the time.
Brewers,36fzn6,11b328i,9,Tue May 19 13:49:48 2015 UTC,I missed the entire game except for the final half inning. I'm just here to party and upvote you folks.
Brewers,36fzn6,Eddie_Truckin_Lacy,3,Tue May 19 02:26:55 2015 UTC,I feel asleep for the last inning or so.  good to see em pull it off :D
Brewers,36fzn6,MasterCashier,7,Tue May 19 13:03:16 2015 UTC,Cheers Brew Crew ! Just make sure to win the next two as well.
Brewers,36fzn6,FeckingShite,8,Tue May 19 02:51:56 2015 UTC,If that happens I will jerk it to a picture of Ned Yost
Brewers,36fzn6,Nebfisherman1987,4,Tue May 19 03:22:01 2015 UTC,I've never wanted this situation to happen... But I do now.
Brewers,36fzn6,smiles134,4,Tue May 19 03:33:26 2015 UTC,whew that game had small margins all the way through
Brewers,36fzn6,a_real_human_bean_,4,Tue May 19 02:27:45 2015 UTC,Good to finally see them win a close one. too many of our wins and losses have been blowouts.
Brewers,36e4mo,BeHereNow91,5,Mon May 18 17:50:17 2015 UTC,"Gomie's been my favorite Brewer for years now, love seeing him being a bro."
Brewers,36e4mo,TurboShorts,2,Mon May 18 21:25:42 2015 UTC,"I think most players and fans are understanding when this happens.  This is inevitable when you're trying to manipulate a ball to fit your fancy at thousands of miles per hour.  Still, good on Gomez."
Brewers,36e4mo,tACorruption,1 point,Mon May 18 23:07:50 2015 UTC,Except the Marlins fans who thought that Fiers was so jealous of Stanton's season last year that he aimed for his face so that he wouldn't win MVP.   Seriously.
Brewers,36e4mo,smiles134,2,Tue May 19 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"and then thought he was doing it intentionally when after being basically in tears he throws over the next guys head.   You can't throw at someone intentionally and have the reaction that Fiers did, you just can't."
Brewers,36e4mo,PeteyB53,1 point,Wed May 20 00:00:38 2015 UTC,Dang.  Imagining a time when players didn't wear helmets is crazy.  That little ear guard might have just straight up saved his life.

Brewers,36end8,ArtOfSilentWar,4,Tue May 19 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Royals are in first. THANKS TO YOU GUYS!"
Brewers,36end8,Jimothy_Riggins,6,Tue May 19 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'll let you in on secret. The Tempe Royals were in first place all night tonight. The 'Crews announcer said ""Brewers beat the first place Tigers"""
Brewers,36end8,ArtOfSilentWar,3,Tue May 19 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure how my phone autocorrected to Tempe.   Yeah, I was pretty sure we held onto first after last night's game."

Brewers,36end8,TheBause,3,Tue May 19 02:15:36 2015 UTC,I love gogos attitude
Brewers,36end8,jn2010,8,Tue May 19 02:14:30 2015 UTC,Ok.  Let's set the scene.  Our 40 year old closer who is prone to heart attack-inducing closes gets to face the best team in the league now.  He hasn't blown a save yet this year.  How is this going to end?  This is the stuff of a stephenie meyer book.
Brewers,36end8,fly1ngorb,3,Tue May 19 02:14:09 2015 UTC,Are we going to find out this game never even happens?

Brewers,36end8,Eddie_Truckin_Lacy,3,Tue May 19 02:14:49 2015 UTC,He's essentially 63.
Brewers,36end8,TheBause,3,Tue May 19 02:15:39 2015 UTC,Seriously?

Brewers,36end8,Jimothy_Riggins,2,Tue May 19 02:17:36 2015 UTC,Haha K-Rod has a huge chain.  I'd think you'd want to take that off before throwing your warmup pitches rather than right before going into game.
Brewers,36end8,jn2010,2,Tue May 19 02:13:15 2015 UTC,K-rod we need this

Brewers,36end8,Axulotl,3,Tue May 19 02:04:53 2015 UTC,That was definitely a strike.
Brewers,36end8,fly1ngorb,3,Tue May 19 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Yes it was
Brewers,36end8,TurboShorts,3,Tue May 19 02:05:20 2015 UTC,i'll take it lol
Brewers,36end8,SocksandSmocks,5,Tue May 19 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I think he was safe, but there were no definitive camera angles to show it.  I can't argue with the review."

Brewers,36end8,Eddie_Truckin_Lacy,3,Tue May 19 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, nice hat Louigi."
Brewers,36end8,SocksandSmocks,3,Tue May 19 02:03:45 2015 UTC,The camera angle they keep showing isn't definitive.
Brewers,36end8,TheBause,5,Tue May 19 02:02:03 2015 UTC,one camera angle was definitive. really bad call.  and that's coming from a neutral fan with no horses in this race.
Brewers,36end8,smiles134,2,Tue May 19 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Which one?  The one showing the foot, from the 1st base stands showed his foot coming down but not the ball in the glove.  The reverse angle showed the ball in the glove but not the foot on the bag.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but I didn't see definitive evidence on the replays."
Brewers,36end8,jn2010,3,Tue May 19 02:07:05 2015 UTC,Broxton's diaper just continues to fill up.

Brewers,36end8,jn2010,3,Tue May 19 02:01:26 2015 UTC,That was a fucking gorgeous double play

Brewers,36end8,Jimothy_Riggins,3,Tue May 19 02:01:06 2015 UTC,That's was close

Brewers,36end8,SocksandSmocks,3,Tue May 19 02:00:45 2015 UTC,YES!

Brewers,36d7wa,necropaw,6,Mon May 18 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I guess they're feeling good with Hector/Elian.  Scooter was sucking something massive so far this year, though."
Brewers,36d7wa,TheBause,3,Mon May 18 13:43:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it coming, but then again I'm not entirely surprised by this based on how he's been playing so far this year.  I hope Scooter can find it again down in AAA."
Brewers,36d7wa,Ripperz,6,Mon May 18 13:52:36 2015 UTC,So now 2 of the 3 players we traded Gallardo for are on the team.  Hopefully they both can contribute.
Brewers,36d7wa,Ripperz,9,Mon May 18 13:54:39 2015 UTC,At least they're acknowledging that Gennett may not be the answer at 2B. Was never that big of a prospect and played WAY over his head in his initial stint in my opinion.
Brewers,36d7wa,jordo2323,3,Mon May 18 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"678 plate appearances in his career against righties where he put up an OPS of .813. I think thats a big enough sample to say he can be a very solid platoon player. He'll never be an everyday player, but he can get 400ish PA every year and help this team."
Brewers,36d7wa,sjm1541,4,Mon May 18 18:47:47 2015 UTC,He was a big prospect in relation to your system
Brewers,36d7wa,frakking-anustart,3,Mon May 18 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"lol sad but really fucking true.  The thing is we have three really good options in the minors/majors at shortstop right now, plus two pretty good options at 2B. I'm guessing someone is going to be moving over to 2B and someone else moving to 3B."

Whether or not Baseball Prospectus valued Scooter or not, other teams did and stating he wasn't a big prospect is certainly hindsight bias."
Brewers,36d7wa,BurtDoyle,1 point,Mon May 18 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Teams ask for a lot of players, but that doesn't mean they were big prospects. Sure they were asking about him, but they weren't offering much in return."
Brewers,36d7wa,dusters,1 point,Tue May 19 01:21:15 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but that an a dime gets us a cup of coffee. He wasn't a big prospect from a larger perspective."

Brewers,36d7wa,dusters,3,Tue May 19 00:59:14 2015 UTC,Good. I still want Hector at 3rd. What an arm ... I never really felt Scooter was the long term answer at 2nd. Too bad. I wanted him to be.
Brewers,36d7wa,Nadie_AZ,6,Mon May 18 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've liked Scooter since we brought him up, but maybe it was just a counter-reaction to how much I didn't want Rickie Weeks to be playing."
Brewers,36d7wa,smiles134,2,Mon May 18 16:10:28 2015 UTC,I think this move is just to set up a blockbuster trade to re-acquire Rickie.

Brewers,369hf0,Redtitwhore,10,Sun May 17 19:06:07 2015 UTC,Any ideas for where we should have the /r/Brewers mass suicide yet
Brewers,369hf0,jubjub2184,3,Sun May 17 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Tailgate on the 30th at Miller Park. I'll provide Brats, Sauerkraut, Burgers, Cyanide-laced beer, and pasta salad."
Brewers,369hf0,SolidRambo,2,Sun May 17 19:22:29 2015 UTC,What a way to go out
Brewers,369hf0,SnipeyMcSnipe,4,Sun May 17 20:40:15 2015 UTC,We could all jump in a vat of beer?
Brewers,369hf0,ccruner13,5,Sun May 17 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"he said suicide, not party"

Brewers,369hf0,silentjay01,1 point,Sun May 17 19:31:46 2015 UTC,You should get more than first base for a headshot.
Brewers,369hf0,mistrbrownstone,2,Sun May 17 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's rough. I seem to recall when Stanton got pegged in the jaw by Fiers last year they actually wound up calling it a strike. Talk about insult to injury."
Brewers,369hf0,SolidRambo,2,Sun May 17 18:49:06 2015 UTC,Staten should have gotten 2 runs when we smoked him last year.
Brewers,369hf0,tACorruption,0,Sun May 17 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  And the Marlins should have got the win after Fiers hit the next batter. The second was on Roenicke, how do you leave a pitcher in after he caves in a guy's face?"
Brewers,369hf0,mistrbrownstone,2,Sun May 17 18:52:06 2015 UTC,Because you destroy his confidence if you pull him.
Brewers,369hf0,tACorruption,2,Sun May 17 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, thank fuck that both Segura and Gomez seemingly took the majority of the blow in the helmet. But two in one season... that's just absurd."

Brewers,369hf0,TheBause,2,Sun May 17 17:24:52 2015 UTC,Looked like Davis gave up on it.  Looked catchable.
Brewers,369hf0,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun May 17 17:24:28 2015 UTC,Is /r/mets really the mets sub? There's not even a game thread
Brewers,369hf0,killarufus,3,Sun May 17 17:16:46 2015 UTC,FYI you can click on the icons in the calendar on the sidebar to get to other team's subs

Brewers,369hf0,killarufus,6,Sun May 17 17:26:01 2015 UTC,We got this boys. All we need to do is score more runs than the other team.
Brewers,369hf0,MasterCashier,5,Sun May 17 16:38:36 2015 UTC,There's an other team??  Damn that cuts our chances of winning by about 50%
Brewers,369hf0,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sun May 17 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"So, third straight day of the pitcher batting 8th?  How does everyone feel that is working for us so far?"
Brewers,369hf0,silentjay01,3,Sun May 17 16:00:11 2015 UTC,It's either really good (7-0 win) or really bad (1-14 loss). So we'll see.
Brewers,369hf0,allmymoneygoestokpop,1 point,Sun May 17 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"They've used up all their runs so we have to win, right?  Right?!  Apparently it doesn't work like that."
Brewers,369hf0,ccruner13,2,Sun May 17 17:11:29 2015 UTC,Still optimistic because we can win a series against a first place team. It can be done
Brewers,367wp0,fly1ngorb,12,Sun May 17 00:55:00 2015 UTC,It's a shame the game got rained out.
Brewers,3672sj,BrewersBot,5,Sat May 16 20:10:07 2015 UTC,I had to get up and go to the bathroom. Did we win?

Brewers,3672sj,adam7765,1 point,Sun May 17 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Counts like that in the standings but what it means for the Mets pitching and hitting is massive.
Brewers,3672sj,islesandpizza,4,Sun May 17 01:02:12 2015 UTC,thats how none of us mets fans took last night we over reacted

Brewers,3672sj,isukatpunk,0,Sun May 17 01:39:21 2015 UTC,I would be pissed about the rain. It never goes good when your team is batting in the rain.

Brewers,3672sj,ccruner13,1 point,Sun May 17 00:36:05 2015 UTC,What did he comment that was so controversial?
Brewers,3672sj,adam7765,2,Sun May 17 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"Just a Mets fan commenting 'Holy Crap', probably in the wrong sub."
Brewers,3672sj,fly1ngorb,2,Sun May 17 00:39:02 2015 UTC,Lol.  Nothing really.  He just said 'holy crap.'  It was at 0 when I saw it so I don't even know why he deleted it.
Brewers,3672sj,ccruner13,3,Sun May 17 00:41:40 2015 UTC,we are the best team in mlb
Brewers,3672sj,fly1ngorb,2,Sun May 17 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"We've got you beat in starting pitching, tho."
Brewers,3672sj,PhnomPencil,2,Sun May 17 00:33:48 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be awesome if the game gets called and rescheduled because they can't get to the fith?
Brewers,3672sj,adam7765,4,Sun May 17 00:44:52 2015 UTC,This is horseshit. 2 inch strike zone as it rains. On the bright side this gives me an excuse to watch Rocky IV.
Brewers,3672sj,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun May 17 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"Just getting around to that one, huh"
Brewers,3672sj,isukatpunk,2,Sun May 17 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"Nope, I generally get an itch to watch a Rocky movie like once every other month. Sometimes that happens during baseball season and I secretly hope an absolute blowout in either direction happens so I can bail on watching and turn on a Rocky flick."

Brewers,3672sj,CJL13,2,Sun May 17 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"I think Matt is like ""Fuck this shit, I'm just pitching till they call the game."""
Brewers,3672sj,CJL13,2,Sun May 17 00:25:49 2015 UTC,"Opposing pitcher is 2 for 2 with an RBI and you gave up a slam to a guy who looks like he's a few years from shaving yet, nicely done, Matt."
Brewers,3672sj,gobrewcrew,4,Sun May 17 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"""Mistakes you can't afford""  You try pitching a wet ball with a small strike zone and see how far you go."

Brewers,3672sj,gobrewcrew,2,Sun May 17 00:19:17 2015 UTC,God damn it.  That annoying guy actually got people to join his chant.
Brewers,3672sj,ccruner13,1 point,Sun May 17 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"Was sitting behind four guys who where chanting and yelling at Braun literally the whole time, until they left in the 7th.  Oh and when they pulled him out of the game, it was ""Where-is-Brau-nie""  I get that taunting and teasing is part of the fun, but for crying out loud, you're grown men yelling at a baseball player.  Show some moderation and let other people enjoy the game."
Brewers,3672sj,Bernie_Brewer,4,Sun May 17 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"I hate it when it's downpouring, yet there isn't a delay because the home team is batting. Brewers never pull that shit (Cause if they tried their retractable dome would never let them get away with it)."

Brewers,3672sj,fly1ngorb,2,Sat May 16 23:53:02 2015 UTC,I wasn't really paying attention but why was our SS so far away from second on that play?  Seemed like he was closer to third.
Brewers,3672sj,ccruner13,2,Sat May 16 23:52:57 2015 UTC,"Bunt defense.  1B and 3B were likely charging to field bunt and SS would cover third.  But he didn't bunt, so deGrom found a hole."
Brewers,3672sj,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Sat May 16 23:43:51 2015 UTC,Good call.  I knew he was pitcher so I could only wonder how they had such a hitting report that they would shift that way.  Lol.  Not sure why I didn't even think of the obvious.
Brewers,3672sj,ccruner13,0,Sat May 16 23:46:52 2015 UTC,turn game on - garza walks pitcher - gives up RBI  maybe I shouldn't listen today

Brewers,366gaa,workthrowaway68,4,Sat May 16 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"It would be absolutely stupid to trade him for peanuts. Traded or not his salary is going to cripple a small market like us for the long hall. I just don't see the point in eating a chunk of his salary for a mediocre prospect package. Many of casual Brewer fans see him as a cancer, but I don't. He made a mistake and has served his suspension. Did he lie? Yes. Did he cheat? Very likely. Is he any worse than someone with a criminal record or serious drug problem? Hell no. Like it or not Braun comes to the ball park everyday giving his best effort on both sides of the ball. He also is a well spoken individual that is seem to be liked by the clubhouse. I just don't feel like a bunch of average minor leaguers outweigh his possible production on the field and in the clubhouse. Maybe I'm way off base, but I want him here if we're gonna rebuild the roster"
Brewers,366gaa,ShoopALoop11,1 point,Sat May 16 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, unless we get a really good prospect deal for him"
Brewers,366gaa,smiles134,0,Sun May 17 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"So first off, each of those players named would instantly become the Brewers top prospect and would have the type of ceiling that is higher than Jimmy Nelson or any of the young players currently on the Brewers, so they aren't ""peanuts"".    And are you saying that you would rather keep a guy with declining performance, and still pay him the $107 million he is due, if you could deal him for two very nice pieces and only pay $30 of that $107 million?  Because if that's the case, then you don't really know much about the economics of baseball."
Brewers,366gaa,s_rouss,5,Sun May 17 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Braun's radioactive.  No other team will want to touch him.  Between the PED's, the salary, and the injury issues, there are just too many red flags.  But I think it's far too early to say the Crew won't contend until 2021.  The farm system is below-average, but there are some promising players (Coulter, Tyrone Taylor, Arcia, Lara, Jorge Garcia, etc.), and they should have a fresh influx of quality young guys after unloading our current roster (Gogo, Lind, Lohse, Garza).  If they can hit on a couple draft picks - admittedly a long-shot given Melvin and co.'s recent draft record - there could be a bright future.  Add Lucroy and Braun (and Jimmy Nelson, Segura, and Scooter), and there's hope.  Depending on how well they handle this rebuild and how well the young guys develop, the Crew could be contending again by 2017."
Brewers,366gaa,The_Bostache,1 point,Sat May 16 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd like to see Segura moved to 3B, Arcia to 2B, and Sardiñas stay at SS. Have Hector Gomez be the utility man. Sure up the infield for a couple years."
Brewers,366gaa,smiles134,2,Sun May 17 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"See, I want to see Sardinas move over to third, keep Segura at short or maybe move him over to second"
Brewers,366gaa,The_Bostache,1 point,Sun May 17 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, I mean their arguably your three best infielders."
Brewers,366gaa,sjm1541,1 point,Sun May 17 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think Segura is better off as trade bait/moving to 2B than he is at 3B. He has the arm to play third, but you're really limiting his range and he has no power upside. If he does stick I think he moves to second base with Sardinas acting as a utility guy and Arcia taking over the SS role. Based on the the scouting reports, Arcia has a great glove and I think it makes sense to wait until he can take over the position whether that involves moving Segura to second or trading him."
Brewers,366gaa,theamazingkiwi,0,Sun May 17 03:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think a team that has a need for an above average bat will take Braun if they can afford the contract, which after the Brewers chip in is about a $15 million deal.  This 2017 date that some Brewer fans keep throwing out is highly naïve.  Lucroy will be in his early 30s by that time, and Braun will be three years older.  Nelson hasn't even completed a full season yet of MLB ball, so what he might be able to produce going forward is highly risky to count on 6 weeks worth of performance.  And Gennett is NOT a guy you should be relying on as a centerpiece for contention.  The problem with that timeline is that the organization doesn't have anyone worthwhile to replace players who leave when contracts expire or when they get traded away.  Add to it, that even if you believe that Arcia is going to be a big time player, he is most likely a rookie and in 2017 shouldn't really be relied upon to be a major contributor.  So how will you fill the holes?  Mid range free agents?  That's how the team go into the position it is in now.  The team NEEDS a long term rebuild, and its going to take at least 5 years to see the fruits of it.."
Brewers,366gaa,Honeydicked,1 point,Sun May 17 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"I will still disagree with your idea of Boston moving Margot, and especially Eduardo, but then again, who knows how the inflated demand will affect Boston's will. I do believe that the Mets would demand more calls between the teams, because that offer might be close."

Brewers,36391p,necropaw,4,Fri May 15 18:58:32 2015 UTC,Is it common to put lefties in a different color?
Brewers,36391p,Ofjuxi,6,Fri May 15 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Fairly, afaik.  For the Brewers lineup cards they always are (and switch hitters are light blue)"
Brewers,36391p,BlankJebus,2,Fri May 15 19:17:36 2015 UTC,I always like then they do this.
Brewers,36391p,BrewCrewKevin,2,Fri May 15 19:31:36 2015 UTC,I never really got the pitcher in the 8-spot mentality. The 8th spot gets 1 more at bat than the 9 spot 1/9 of games or so. I've always thought you should just put your best hitters first and thats it.
Brewers,36391p,BrewCrewKevin,3,Fri May 15 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"I guess the argument would be that by the end of the game youre probably using a PH anyways, so your pitcher is likely to bat the same amount of times anyways.  I dunno.  i dont care much either way.  Sometimes it'll work out well, others it'll screw you.  Same as a lot of things you can do in baseball."
Brewers,36391p,sjm1541,1 point,Fri May 15 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, I just have a hard time wrapping my mind around that logic..."
Brewers,36391p,BrewCrewKevin,2,Fri May 15 20:47:34 2015 UTC,It also allows you to move your best hitters up in the lineup and give them more at bats. I think the idea is that moving you 2-3-4 hitters up to 1-2-3 is a net positive compared to the hit you take flipping the 8-9 hitters. 9 hitter is essentially a second lead off hitter and will be on base more than the pitcher for the core of the lineup.
Brewers,36391p,DEUCE_SLUICE,1 point,Fri May 15 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"that's a good point. If you essentially start your strong rotation at batter #9 instead of #10, you net all those leadoff guys more at bats with RISP."
Brewers,36391p,TurboShorts,3,Fri May 15 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"You're essentially right - you should order your lineup in a way so that your best hitters get the most opportunities to bat. The reason for batting the pitcher eighth is so the likelihood of the nine spot getting on base before your best hitters is a little higher.   On a team where the guy who makes the most sense as a leadoff guy (Carlos Gomez) is also one of the best hitters on the team in general and a guy with some pop, putting a more typical ""leadoff"" type guy (low power, high OBP, good speed) in the nine spot makes some sense."
Brewers,36391p,silentjay01,2,Fri May 15 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"Considering the condition of our team, this is a fairly stacked Brewers lineup."

Brewers,36391p,smiles134,-10,Fri May 15 20:44:28 2015 UTC,Hitting the pitcher 8th is unnecessary and just a ploy managers use to get attention.  All it does is get your pitcher up in an important situation early and there's no evidence that hitting the pitcher 8th is better than 9th.
Brewers,364cdq,VirtuallyRealistic,5,Sat May 16 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for Miller Park, but I will say we did a few games in Appleton for the Rattlers (considerably cheaper). Totally worth it.  Net is not an issue, you might be a bit annoyed at first, but you get used to it and it's just a thing.   Not sure it'd be the same at the major league level, but the interaction you get with players and coaches is awesome. Playfully razzing the opposition is tons of fun, and they seem to enjoy it. Also, we had a great two inning conversation with the coach about life in the minors. Good dude. Got a couple of game balls.  All in all, a great time."
Brewers,364cdq,nior_labotomy,2,Sat May 16 01:24:07 2015 UTC,But your odds of catching a brat from the Bratzooka are greatly diminished when sitting directly behind the netting.
Brewers,364cdq,silentjay01,5,Sat May 16 07:37:04 2015 UTC,"I used to sit in 217/218 all the time, and it was a pretty good view.  The only times I would notice the net is on a foul ball.  Once you're used to it your eyes don't really register it as being there, since you're always focusing on what's going on beyond it."
Brewers,364cdq,BeHereNow91,3,Sun May 17 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"Sat behind home plate a few times a miller park and used to have season tickets in the  2nd row at county. I never even noticed the net as being an annoyance. It's like accidentally leaving your windshield wipers on despite the fact it's been done raining for 5 minutes.  With that said, I would rather spend the money near the on deck circle. Guaranteed baseballs and you have a better chance of hearing player convos."

Brewers,362a76,EricH7,3,Fri May 15 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"I really liked this article, in fact I am a Chris Mitchell fan in general. I thought he did a nice job outlining the big weakness for Orlando, yet it shows that Arcia is still doing a lot of things right. This being his impressive BABIP numbers, very low strikeout % and still doing this passing to good defense. Orlando is essentially the reason why I do not mind seeing Segura traded."
Brewers,362a76,theamazingkiwi,3,Fri May 15 15:10:14 2015 UTC,How about putting him at 2nd and sending gennet packing?

Brewers,360h7v,workthrowaway68,2,Fri May 15 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"Margot is considered a higher end prospect. If Boston moves him, it would be for Queto/Chapman/Lucroy and that bunch."
Brewers,360h7v,theamazingkiwi,0,Fri May 15 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"I think he is a very nice prospect, but he is outside of a top 100 ranking most likely and there is uncertainty in the bat and is a high ceiling, high risk sort of prospect at this point.  Apparently the Phillies have been looking at him recently but only because the Sox wont give up Swihart or Betts, and he would be one part of a package of prospects, in opposition to a ""must have"".    The Sox system is very deep and he is further down the list.  But if the big names came off the board like Hamels and Cueto or David Price and the Sox are left empty handed, there is a chance they would deal him for an upgrade.  he's definitely not untouchable."
Brewers,360h7v,theamazingkiwi,0,Sat May 16 03:14:34 2015 UTC,"I know he is not untouchable. However, he is worth more than Garza, even if Boston gets desperate, they know Margot is worth more than Garza even with eating some of the contract."

My joy knew no bounds tonight when going to the beer stand and seeing the familiar Stein tap back in it's rightful place! I remarked to the bartender how glad I was to see it back, she said so many people had complained that they brought it back within the first week. So 100 losses just got a lot easier to swallow.

Brewers,35vggv,FeckingShite,1 point,Thu May 14 00:21:07 2015 UTC,What's a DH?
Brewers,35vggv,silentjay01,2,Thu May 14 01:05:23 2015 UTC,The Designated Hitter is what the American League uses so that their pitchers don't have to take at bats.  This allows them to keep their starters out their longer instead of substituting them out for a pinch hitter thus removing a big level of strategy and letting AL teams keep an extra arm or two in the bullpen instead of bat on the bench.  And it has the added effect of prolonging the careers of power hitters who through injury or old age have become a liability playing in the field on defense.
Brewers,35vggv,FeckingShite,1 point,Thu May 14 01:14:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I didn't know any of that, because I'm a baseball scrub."

Brewers,35vggv,SolidRambo,2,Wed May 13 21:30:11 2015 UTC,7-5 all season long would be about a 93-win season.  I will take it!
Brewers,35uv5i,gagezettelmeier,10,Wed May 13 18:28:21 2015 UTC,"He had some memorable moments, but that contract we gave him was one of the stupidest decisions for this franchise in the last 15 years."
Brewers,35uv5i,smiles134,10,Wed May 13 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Bill Hall extension. Sure, it went terribly, but everyone was pretty stoked about that deal.  Jeff Suppan's deal, however, was widely panned from day one and for good reason. I think that was like waaaaaay more stupider."
Brewers,35uv5i,peckx063,11,Wed May 13 19:28:47 2015 UTC,I don't know if anything will ever top the Suppan deal. 4 years to a 32 year old whose top FIP was 4.29 and struck out about 5 guys per 9 while walking 3. Average fastball was under 88. Just so bad in every way.
Brewers,35uv5i,sjm1541,3,Wed May 13 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"True. I did say one of the stupidest, though :p That Suppan deal was just awful."
Brewers,35uv5i,smiles134,2,Wed May 13 19:31:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. Suppan's and Jeffrey Hammonds' contracts were worse.
Brewers,35uv5i,crewblue,0,Thu May 14 00:41:34 2015 UTC,agreed.  And he wasn't very well liked- in part because rumors came out that he wanted to be traded out of Milwaukee.
Brewers,35uv5i,BrewCrewKevin,2,Wed May 13 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand why he got added to the Wall of Honor last year. In 8 years here, he was only worth 9.4 wins, and almost six of those came from the 2006 year right before he got his big contract."
Brewers,35uv5i,smiles134,2,Wed May 13 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Aren't you part of the Wall of Honor if you meet the requirements? (They aren't that strict either, if I recall)  http://www.brewcrewball.com/2013/12/19/5227702/Milwaukee-brewers-wall-of-honor-whos-not-on-it"

Bill Hall and Wild Card banners looks so silly compared to the damn red birds like 20 WS banners..."
Brewers,35uv5i,DICKSUBJUICY,4,Wed May 13 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's about honoring players who played long enough to make meaningful contributions to the team. Innings pitched, plate appearances, etc. are all great ways to do that.   This isn't our Brewers ""Hall of Fame"" which is much more selective, it's a ""Wall of Honor"" to give a nod to those who spent 4+ years of their career with us."

Brewers,35uk5s,workthrowaway68,4,Wed May 13 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's going anywhere.  Maybe he'll get waivered when teams start looking for relievers for their playoff runs, and that's when we can get rid of his contract.  He'll be here past the deadline, though, unless he starts throwing like a $9mil reliever."
Brewers,35uk5s,BeHereNow91,1 point,Wed May 13 20:44:01 2015 UTC,That's about all I see happening with him too.. probably a reason why we didn't get him until the last days of August.

Brewers,35qcwg,madman86,1 point,Tue May 12 23:28:50 2015 UTC,throw in a tin of beef jerky chew and you have yourself a deal
Brewers,35qcwg,orange_lazarus1,1 point,Wed May 13 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"I feel as if any team would be willing to get Lohse if they needed the rotation depth. Despite the slow start there is still value there and the acquisition would be low risk. The Astros are another solid fit for Lohse, as well as the Dodgers. In either case, I would look for the crew to target a 45 FV pitcher in high A/AA, does not mean they will get one though."
Brewers,35qcwg,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Tue May 12 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty reasonable. Considering how poorly Lohse has pitched this season, I can't see us getting anything other than a decent low level prospect and Austin Dean seems to fit that profile. I can imagine Lohse may garner some interest because he would likely regress towards the mean and not pitch as poorly as he ahs been. Home runs have really killed him this season (on track to give up 40+) so teams with giant parks (Marlins, Astros) are probably the only ones who would be interested in a trade."

Brewers,35o5wl,orange_lazarus1,1 point,Tue May 12 15:02:04 2015 UTC,The most shocking thing I read in this article is that Casey McGeehee is still in the starting lineup of a major league team.
Brewers,35o5wl,gimmesomespace,1 point,Fri May 15 09:49:42 2015 UTC,"Ha--""Here are the Brewers' trade candidates: every single player on the team.  They are all good players, and they could really help a contending team.""  Wait, so why can't the Brewers contend with an entire team of guys who would play for a contending team?  Yet another reason why I think the recent (last decade or so) trend of ""trade all your good guys before their contracts run out!"" is largely hogwash.    It can be beneficial in isolated instances.  But we've somehow reached a point where it's fully expected that any team that doesn't have the best record in all of MLB should look to start trading any of its players with fewer than 2 years left on his contract.    It's like people are fans of the minor league teams rather than the Major League team, and they want to trade guys from the Major League team to make the minor league teams better.  It is the other way around!  People get so concerned when ""the farm system is bare.""  The Brewers have been in that state for nearly 10 years now.  And they're still pulling guys up from that ""bare system"" (Nelson, Peralta, Fiers, Davis, Gennett) that leave them contending at the Major League level."
Brewers,35o5wl,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 12 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"What's different about baseball is the very high turnover of players, especially in a smaller market like Milwaukee.  You'd never see this at the NFL level because contracts are generally limited by salary caps.  But we're looking at losing any player that a team would be willing to overpay for (and as you look around the MLB, you can see that a team will overpay just about anyone to fill a gap).    This team is out of contention this season, so trading guys who are towards the end of their careers makes sense (Rami, K-Rod, Lohse).  We're not going to compete for a couple years, if not longer, so trading guys who we think we'll have to overpay to keep makes sense, too (Gomez, maybe Lucroy).  I don't see us trading more than 5 or 6 players away, unless we get some seriously good offers.    If you want to look at how a rebuild helps, look at the Astros.  They've consistently traded away major pieces over the last few years, and now they're contending with a young team.  Or look at the Royals, who took two of our prospects and turned them into the anchors of their team.  Smart rebuilds work, and they're a necessary evil when it comes to long-term success.  You just can't win without a farm system."
Brewers,35o5wl,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 12 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"I understand the appeal.  But I've been on a soapbox about it for a few weeks here because the examples where it works are few and far between.  The key to rebuilding is the draft, not trades.  But I do recognize that in specific circumstances, a trade can make sense.  I think people get too crazy with it, though, and think that since it can work, it will work, so we should trade all of our guys ASAP.  In baseball, the line is very fine between horrible teams and really good teams.  (The worst baseball teams in modern-era baseball history would equate record-wise with approximately a 4-12 NFL team.)  Often, even not-so-good teams get the benefit of a playoff berth due to a hot streak, and really good, well-built teams miss the playoffs regularly due to poor stretches.  The Brewers started line gangbusters last season, held steady for a long while, and then hit one of the worst stretches in team history.  This season they've started the opposite--like gangwelders? ha--and we've seen them steady the ship and play decent baseball of late.  A streak only half as good as last year's opening would more than put them in contention: they sit only 5 games behind that second Wild Card spot.  So for me, I want to see what the team can do.  As I noted in my original post, the team is at least adequate at every position on the field.  That means they have the capability of striking a hot streak and providing some excitement."
Brewers,35o5wl,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 12 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"Well then don't look at it as a rebuild.  Look at us as being a team that won't compete with the roster we have now and one that will probably lose some of its top talent to free agency in the next couple of seasons.  Rather than straight-up lose those players, we might as well get something for them.  In the end, you're right.  There's no 100% foolproof way to go about this, and trading away Gomez, Lucroy, etc. could end up netting us prospects that fizzle out at the Major League level.  I still think a guy like Gomez will fetch more money in free agency than we're willing to pay him, so trading him seems like a good idea, even if we're competitive at the break.  If we're not competitive, I think we'll end up seeing a few other players get shipped off, especially aging veterans."
Brewers,35o5wl,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 12 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"Look at us as being a team that won't compete with the roster we have now and one that will probably lose some of its top talent to free agency in the next couple of seasons.   While I don't disagree that we will probably lose some of our top talent to free agency in the next couple of seasons (Lucroy after 2016, Gomez after 2016), I do disagree with you regarding this team's ability to compete with the existing roster.  This is largely the identical team that led its division for 150 days last summer, minus Gallardo (replaced with Nelson) and Reynolds/Overbay (replaced with Lind).  It is reasonable to expect that those differences are actually upgrades.  Players are 8 months older than they were during last season, yes--but that helps in some cases and hurts in others.  Brewers fans have been told for a long time by national columnists that their team and its farm system are both severely impoverished.  The historically bad start has caused them to believe it and feel resigned to the fact that the Brewers are a ""bad team"" without any chance of competing.  But last summer, the hot start caused everyone to keep those naysayers at bay.    I'm arguing that the results are causing people to clamor for making moves merely for the sake of making moves.  Perhaps--perhaps--consider moving Gomez this coming offseason, or during the trade deadline next season.  And for Lucroy, the same thing in the 2016 offseason / 2017 trade deadline.  If you move either of them now, you BETTER get several pieces that immediately, dramatically shorten the length of the ""rebuild.""  Otherwise, you're abandoning rare commodities that teams work hard to acquire for pennies on the dollar."
Brewers,35o5wl,orange_lazarus1,2,Tue May 12 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"Last season we were helped by a big April and June.  Every other month, we played sub-.500.

Brewers,35mi6t,smiles134,2,Mon May 11 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well TJ surgery is pretty common nowadays and the outlook is hopeful in most cases.  i would suspect a guy with the upside of Peralta/Nelson but who also strikes guys out at a very nice clip is a worthwhile return.  the fact that you might have to wait for him for another year to start AA shouldnt matter, since the timetable for this rebuild is more than 3 years out, its more like 5 to 7 years out."
Brewers,35mi6t,smiles134,1 point,Mon May 11 20:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think for me a lot of the hesitance is that you won't really know who the trade favored for several years. Which, I suppose, is true for most cases, but still. I just gotta buckle my seat belt and hope they know what they're doing."
Brewers,35mi6t,SolidRambo,3,Mon May 11 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much we'd get for him without eating a fair amount of his salary. You could make the argument that because he's done for after this season it may be a hard sell, but also make the argument that a team may just want to win now and is willing to sell of some young guys (and it's not uncommon for somebody to come over mid-season for the last year of their contract and bounce right afterwards). Guess it really will depend where he is needed come mid season and how well we can sell him.  As a side note, I really wish Lohse didn't pick this year to significantly decline, because we probably could've gotten. I would've liked to have seen him go to the Royals for any of their numerous pitching prospects. He probably would've fit in pretty well as a 3, 4 or 5 for them in their pitcher friendly park. Or if Houston is actually the real deal this season.."

Brewers,35mi6t,theamazingkiwi,2,Tue May 12 04:21:37 2015 UTC,I can see the Angels as a potential trade fit. Not sure yet on what type of return there could be though.
Brewers,35mi6t,orange_lazarus1,3,Mon May 11 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"maybe a pitcher like Nick Tropeano, who at best would be a mid rotation starter.  But he is already MLB ready.  maybe you get a better player long term if you ask for a guy in AA ball instead like.  But beyond that its a stretch.  Brewers are going to have to pay part of Ramirez' remaining salary no matter what, so depending on how much they pay will determine what kind of player they get back."

They get a good start to this season, after years of being in the gutter and their fans suddenly started acting like they are god's fucking gift to baseball. At least Cardinals fans have a history of success to back up their arrogance. The Cubs have fucking nothing. They've never done a single god damn thing. Literally the most notable thing that ever happened to the Cubs is Steve Bartman catching that foul ball, Moises Alou throwing a tantrum about it, and then losing to the Marlins in the NLCS anyway. But since they went to the postseason that year, they're clearly an amazing franchise and now they love to talk about how the Brewers always suck and the Cubs are so great. You wanna talk about historical ineptness? The Cubs, since coming into the league as the Cubs in 1907, haven't won the World Series since 1908. And Cubs fans, even more than Cardinals fans, all of the sudden love talking about how much of a shithole Miller Park is and how great Wrigley Field is. Fuck Wrigley Field. It's a completely personality filled stadium with no history of winning to match the team that plays in it. And even besides that, how the fuck would they know? It's not like Cubs fans go to games. Even when they were good, you'd go to a Cubs game and it'd be at the very least 50% Brewers fans. And anybody remember going to games pre-2011? There'd be 20,000 people there and 18,000 of them would be Brewers fans. Fuck the Cubs. I hope they lose 100 games this year. Actually, you know what, no, I don't. I hope they lose about 85, because losing 100 might actually clue in the management on what everybody else already realizes, that the Cubs are overpaying free agent pitchers to act as band-aids to cover up gaping wounds. They keep rebuilding when they need to add pitching, and I hope they keep trying forever. Fuck the Cubs. They shouldn't even be in the NL. But because they were Ricketts' personal plaything, they got special treatment all the fucking time. Montreal lost its team and the league didn't even try to fix the situation, and in fact made it worse, but there was never talk of moving the Cubs when no one went to their games. The Astros had been an NL team since their inception, but who got moved to the AL when Selig wanted to even the divisions? Not the Cubs, no. Fucking Houston, because Selig wanted his team in the NL. God, just fuck absolutely everything about the Cubs. I hope they suck forever."

In fact in years when we are out of it (or aren't in a close race with them), I actively root for them.   Back in 2010 I was in High School and living in Chicago for the summer. I went to a Brewers game at Wrigley and ended up sitting with some old time Cubs fan. They were not only nothing but polite and friendly, but I felt bad at how despondent they were. They had no faith in their front office, and were about as self-depreciating as you can get.  The Cardinals though? Fuck those guys. NL Yankees."

Brewers,35hvof,TheBause,2,Sun May 10 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, he kind of threw the elbow, but that's a pretty weak call."

Brewers,35hvof,TheBause,1 point,Sun May 10 20:56:14 2015 UTC,K-Rod has been pretty good so far this year.

The lack of either ""west"" or ""east"" in the name implies that they should be in the Central. But the rest of the teams are in the Midwest. Of these teams, the Cardinals are the furthest west, so QED Cardinals to the American League."

Brewers,35gcgx,FrostySack,20,Sun May 10 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"Probably the dumbest comment ever written. But it's his quote at the end that takes the cake -    Fuck the Brewers. They shouldn't even be in the NL. But because they were Bud Selig's personal plaything, they got special treatment all the fucking time. Montreal lost its team and the league didn't even try to fix the situation, and in fact made it worse, but there was never talk of moving the Brewers when no one went to their games. The Astros had been an NL team since their inception, but who got moved to the AL when Selig wanted to even the divisions? Not the traditionally American League team, no. Fucking Houston, because Selig wanted his team in the NL. God, just fuck absolutely everything about the Brewers. I hope they suck forever.           Seriously dude? Sure Selig was our owner, but the Astros were moved to the AL West because they're nowhere geographically close to the other NL Central teams! The amount of moronic comments in that post is off the charts. You wanna talk about attendance? The Brewers attendance is pretty darn good, thank you very much, especially considering that the Chicago metropolitan area is five times the population of the Milwaukee area.  Oh, what's that? The Brewers had a higher attendance than the Cubs last year?  That's what I thought. And one last thing:   You wanna talk about historical ineptness?   Yeah, I wanna talk about historical ineptness. Because the Cubs are by far the most inept franchise in MLB history. They've been around since before sliced bread and the last time they won the world series it would be over a decade until women could even vote.   So thanks for starting this /u/hawksfan81, we could have been friends and concentrated our hate on the Cards but instead you had to needlessly incite moronic vitriol. As my man Abe said,    Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.   Go Brewers."
Brewers,35gcgx,smiles134,5,Sun May 10 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"I hope they suck forever.   Well if anyone knows how to do that, it's the Cubs.  Maybe he will teach us the secret on how to do if for so long."

Brewers,35gcgx,king_dirty,3,Sun May 10 05:08:25 2015 UTC,"I guarantee he's a classic Chicago sports fan who can't handle the fact the Packers own the Bears and is taking it out on the Brewers. Cubs fans won't admit it, but the Bears are the heart and soul of Chicago sports and the team fucking blows, has done for the last 30 years, and only has more horrible years to look forward to when they finally give Cutler the boot and don't have a quarterback to keep them hovering a little over .500 every year."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Brewers,35byxf,jn2010,2,Sat May 9 02:14:45 2015 UTC,He's trying to win us over so he can sell us silk. He's obviously that Wong guy.

Brewers,35brl4,madman86,0,Fri May 8 20:51:36 2015 UTC,I think wooten  has potential
Brewers,35brl4,Not_Kirby_Delauter,2,Sat May 9 00:54:37 2015 UTC,29 years old with a career 5 ERA. he's basically a AAAA type of player. Kintzler has a career 3.26 ERA. He likely won't return to the type of year he had in 2013 but he's probably the better option.
Brewers,35brl4,BarcaBadger,1 point,Sat May 9 05:19:18 2015 UTC,"Ehh, Rob has better peripherals going back to last year, plus he is younger than Kintz. Albeit they are both below average, I would go with Rob more times than not."

Brewers,357v5k,rustyknucklez,10,Thu May 7 21:00:17 2015 UTC,Were still 4-3 in the last calendar week.  So theres that.
Brewers,357v5k,necropaw,7,Thu May 7 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, this isn't so bad. A split was good enough for me, and I still think they're still on the upside at the moment. Cubs beware of the shitstorm."
Brewers,357v5k,adam7765,4,Thu May 7 21:01:14 2015 UTC,Tough loss because it would have been nice to take the series but I can't be mad with the way that they have played over the past week. I think we are on an upswing so things should be better from here on out.
Brewers,357v5k,MasterCashier,2,Thu May 7 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Well, can't say I'm disappointed that I messed this one.  Still though, I'm so glad that we split this series."

Brewers,357v5k,BrewCrewKevin,8,Thu May 7 21:50:50 2015 UTC,.500!  But Roenicke was .750 over his last four!  COUNSELL HAS LOST THE CLUBHOUSE! /s
Brewers,357v5k,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu May 7 21:53:45 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, it was .500, wasn't it. For some reason I was thinking he took over for the 2nd game. But it was definitely the 1st."

Brewers,357v5k,SolidRambo,-1,Sat May 9 03:16:15 2015 UTC,Of course Fiers throws a perfect inning on a non-broadcast day when the awful Dodgers announcing crew made me opt to go to the gym instead of staying tuned in. >:(

And actually, for some strange reason, I am actually fine with how bad we are doing, now we don't have to worry about being let down come fall!

Brewers,356h41,chaosninja,0,Thu May 7 19:37:25 2015 UTC,Why isn't Jeremy Jeffress in Colorado Springs?!?
Brewers,356h41,Nashwaukee,1 point,Thu May 7 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"He was one of our best pitchers last year, and even this year his ERA+ is pretty good at 150 (before this game), though his FIP is is an unsightly 5.04 (probably high now after this game). I'm guessing his ERA is going to regress, but even then, he's one of our better bullpen arms. Certainly better than Neal Cotts."
Brewers,356h41,smiles134,1 point,Thu May 7 19:48:06 2015 UTC,He is normally very reliable. He s one of the better pitchers we have in the bullpen.
Brewers,356h41,MasterCashier,2,Thu May 7 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"welp... 2 outta 4 aint bad. Split the series.  I'll hold out hope a little longer, but it looks like they broke it open now."

Brewers,356h41,AemenLeny,3,Thu May 7 18:11:44 2015 UTC,You won't be watching for long. The Dodgers announcers are awful. Plus it's not on FSWI anyway.

Brewers,356h41,MasterCashier,1 point,Thu May 7 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Better off listening to Uecker and Joe.  Uecker was talking about Jerry Meals (crew chief) before; saying something along the lines of 'He doesn't look very big, looks like he's missed a couple meals.'"

Rock and BA are even handed and have a sense of friendship. Plus they learned from Ueck to have a little fun, too."

Brewers,353po5,muffin_man84,4,Thu May 7 02:34:48 2015 UTC,Just watching Davis's swing makes you understand why he strikes out so much.  The start of his swing is so slow and inefficient.
Brewers,353po5,jn2010,2,Thu May 7 02:28:11 2015 UTC,Davis started out so good too...
Brewers,353po5,fly1ngorb,1 point,Thu May 7 02:27:39 2015 UTC,It took a while for pitchers to realize that his strikeout pitch is a fast ball.   He's too slow to reach it when he's not looking for a fast ball.

Brewers,353po5,fly1ngorb,2,Thu May 7 02:02:46 2015 UTC,Yup. After Joc caught it and hit the wall he said it was gone. Anyone who only heard the audio would have thought he robbed him of a HR.

Brewers,353po5,jn2010,3,Thu May 7 01:57:38 2015 UTC,I think that was the right call. It looked as though Gonzalez caught it with his foot on the bag and as he fell to the ground it came off.
Brewers,353po5,muffin_man84,3,Thu May 7 01:54:31 2015 UTC,They must have some serious magnification to be able to say that's conclusive evidence.

Brewers,353po5,ccruner13,6,Thu May 7 01:53:07 2015 UTC,That seemed inconclusive at best.  Not sure I agree with the overturn.

We plan on tailgating and doing the Miller factory tour as well. Is there anything else we should be doing? Thanks for the help!
Brewers,353po5,cordel_walker,1 point,Thu May 7 00:49:31 2015 UTC,Milwaukee Ale House is good and reasonable prices http://ale-house.com/
Brewers,353po5,ilovedasimps,1 point,Thu May 7 01:16:22 2015 UTC,I like rock bottom brewery. They're pretty good.
Brewers,353po5,Pagoon,5,Thu May 7 00:56:44 2015 UTC,AJ Bombers has fantastic burgers.
Brewers,353po5,Pagoon,1 point,Thu May 7 00:54:33 2015 UTC,That's what I keep hearing. How are the prices there?
Brewers,353po5,smiles134,2,Thu May 7 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Not terrible considering the popularity and being located downtown.  Expect to spend 10-15 bucks for a burger, fries, and drink depending on what you order.  Edit: Here's the website: http://ajbombers.com/  Edit 2: Ok, the website sucks.  I highly recommend some deep fried cheese curds though."
Brewers,353po5,smiles134,2,Thu May 7 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on how fancy you want to get. I usually just eat at sonic before I go to the game, but I'm guessing you're going to want to do something different haha"

Brewers,353kb3,tlott,2,Wed May 6 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think Milwaukee has Uber, to address you transport question, you could always give them a try. Cabs are kinda random in Milwaukee, sometimes there's boatloads, other times its like trying to find the fountain of youth."
Brewers,353kb3,umphreak2x2,2,Wed May 6 21:24:09 2015 UTC,I live in a town that doesn't have uber and most likely never will. How exactly does it work?
Brewers,353kb3,umphreak2x2,1 point,Wed May 6 21:52:35 2015 UTC,You sign up through the app. You do have to enter a CC or debit card number because they just charge the fare right to your card. You can tip if you want (I usually throw the driver a fiver).   After you are signed up. Just request a ride. A driver usually shows up in like 5 - 10 minutes.   Edit: To address your bar and shuttle question. Where are you staying? Are you downtown?
Brewers,353kb3,umphreak2x2,2,Wed May 6 21:54:22 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm downtown. At the Hilton.
Brewers,353kb3,CJL13,3,Wed May 6 22:01:06 2015 UTC,The Hilton should have a shuttle and hopefully will take you there. Worse comes to worse. Walk east (towards the lake) down Wisconsin Ave and go to Mo's Irish Pub (on 2nd and Wisconsin). They have shuttles there that go every 20 minutes or so.
Brewers,353kb3,CJL13,2,Wed May 6 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"You could always go to a bar close to MP, they'll have a shuttle to and from the park."

Brewers,353a2u,BrewCrewKevin,5,Wed May 6 19:14:48 2015 UTC,"Nice try MLB! Seriously though, just search for ""mlb.tv dns"". Top result is the one that will interest you."
Brewers,353a2u,madman86,1 point,Wed May 6 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"lol  thanks, man. I am not sure how to do this. Maybe I'll try a monthly subscription first, and get myself a VPN router or something and see if I can figure it out before I cut the cord.  I just really don't want to go without Brewer games, but cord cutting is getting very tempting."
Brewers,353a2u,madman86,1 point,Wed May 6 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"You don't even need a VPN, just the DNS service. It won't slow down your internet connection and almost every router allows you to set custom DNS servers. This is the first year I've done it and I've not missed a game yet."
Brewers,353a2u,NBABUCKS1,2,Wed May 6 23:33:59 2015 UTC,adfreetime is a dns service and does NOT slow down the service.  DNS works differently then ip.
Brewers,353a2u,madman86,1 point,Thu May 7 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"I am technologically stupid... how does that work?  It looks really nice. And samsung and xbox are both supported, which is nice.  So... you need to connect devices to a different IP... what is that doing in laymans terms?"
Brewers,353a2u,allonbacuth,1 point,Thu May 7 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"It hides where you are requesting the site from. It basically sends a different IP request along to the site, and then when it gets the response from the site back, it gives it back to you.  If you have a wireless router you can just google how to put in custom DNS servers. It'll be slightly different for each router. That's it. No need to do anything else. The site has easy to follow instructions after you sign up (and there is a free 1 week trial I believe so you can test it out).   The one catch is that some ISPs restrict the use of custom DNS servers, although it is sort of rare."
Brewers,353a2u,allonbacuth,1 point,Thu May 7 00:28:20 2015 UTC,"Looks good! I think I'm going to try this next month then.  And by the way, if they start checking billing addresses I should be okay, too. I have a cousin in Minneapolis that has an MLB subscription (and now that I think of it must be doing this to watch the Twins), but if they check billing codes we'll just swap login info. I'll buy his and he'll buy mine."
Brewers,353a2u,MasterCashier,2,Thu May 7 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"You could always use top result: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=watch+sports+online  Not the best quality and you usually have to listen to the other announcers, but its fucking baseball."
Brewers,353a2u,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu May 7 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've done it before. Thanks, but no thanks.  I have money to pay for a service, and would like my Brewer games in HD. It sounds like DNS service may work- if that doesn't then I'm keeping my dish network."

Brewers,353a2u,MustBeNice,1 point,Thu May 7 15:37:16 2015 UTC,I think MLB.tv is changing how they track people using desktops or laptops now. I heard they were going to start using the billing zip code but I'm not positive on that.
Brewers,353a2u,PoshBarbaricFlush,3,Wed May 6 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"My billing zip is now 99501.  I, uh, moved to Anchorage recently."
Brewers,353a2u,RacerX2727,1 point,Wed May 6 20:28:10 2015 UTC,Sounds reasonable. I hear the weather is nice there!
Brewers,353a2u,PoshBarbaricFlush,1 point,Wed May 6 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"Still blacked out from 9 MLB cities.  Seriously there are cities in the East where you can be literally be blacked out by 5 or 6 teams. & you might not think that's a big deal if you like a West Coast team, but even the AWAY broadcasts for your team can be blocked out! It's insane"
Brewers,353a2u,madman86,1 point,Thu May 7 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"They do.  I tried signing up for a new MLB account to watch the Free Game of the Day on Monday and they wanted billing information.  I used to use a proxy through my VPS to watch with my own account, but they've closed that gap by checking billing zip codes.  I just gave up and went back to stealing content via streams and complaining about it on twitter."

Brewers,353a2u,dannisbet,1 point,Thu May 7 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"You could always cut mlb.tv and google first row sports.  Use the .eu version of the site.  Quality is sketchy and spotty, but you can still watch games.  Every game, every sport, always.  Works 60% of the time, all the time."
Brewers,353a2u,NBABUCKS1,1 point,Wed May 6 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"lol yeah, I've checked that out before too. But I'm looking for something more high quality. If I can't find a way to do it HD through mlb.tv, then I'm going to keep my subscription."

Brewers,34zhkc,Briarsaunt,4,Wed May 6 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not as discouraged as that poem suggests.   I'll be here for the year regardless of what happens.  Thanks for the kind words though."
Brewers,34zhkc,jn2010,3,Wed May 6 02:35:23 2015 UTC,"I like that attitude. I live in the Bay Area and people often ask me after SF won again in 2014 if I hated the last season, if I wanted to forget it all and honestly we didn't win the WS and got killed by the Cardinals again in October but it was SUCH A GOOD YEAR and most Giants' fans can't comprehend that even without a ring the season was great. It just could have been a little bit better"
Brewers,34zhkc,Briarsaunt,3,Wed May 6 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"I can relate after the Packers last year and Wisconsin basketball in April.  It sucks to get so close and not get the championship, but either way, its so much fun to watch the ride regardless of the outcome.  A lot of fans don't understand that."
Brewers,34zhkc,Valleyoan,2,Wed May 6 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Last year my favorite players performed well and stayed healthy. You can't ask for any more. Now this year I am nervous, I don't want my favorite to Opt-out."
Brewers,34zhkc,Briarsaunt,3,Wed May 6 02:48:02 2015 UTC,I'm in the bay area too. I hate SFG fans.
Brewers,34zhkc,Valleyoan,2,Wed May 6 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"There you go, I have nothing against SF or the organization but most  SF fans are dreadful. There are some gems who appreciate the game and rivalry but most of them are spoiled and entitled."
Brewers,34zhkc,Briarsaunt,2,Wed May 6 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"Most of 'those' fans were the candlestick faithful. Now it's a bunch of people who don't even really remember the 2002 WS against the angels, lol.  not-related story:  One time I met an old guy in the Oregon area who was born and raised in SF. He was probably late 80's when I met him 5/6 years ago. anyway, we were talking about random things about SF back in the day, and I asked him if he was a Giants fan.  As soon as I asked that the conversation went from smiling small talk to absolute raging anger.  ""FUCK THE SAN FRANCISCO COCK SUCKING GIANTS!"" He said.  He went on to explain his deep hate for the Giants because he had a lot of friends on the San Francisco Seals who were promptly out of a job playing the game they loved when the Giants moved to SF. His rage grew even larger when I told him the Giants use the Seal as type of mascot today, lol."

Brewers,34zhkc,smiles134,2,Wed May 6 02:21:27 2015 UTC,You're playing the Cubs and Dodgers...that makes us practically on the same team right now...  What's good for you is good for me and if things go well you never know what the brewers could do.. All you guys need is to get back to within a few games of .500 and see where the rest of the division is at that point.  I need the Brewers to shake up the NL central and the other 2 division leaders!
Brewers,34zhkc,Salesman89,1 point,Wed May 6 02:38:14 2015 UTC,Brewers need to win an entire week's worth of games to get back around .500. It ain't gonna happen.
Brewers,34zhkc,smiles134,1 point,Wed May 6 03:06:52 2015 UTC,You're 5 games off from the pack and have won 3 of the last 4...  You have like...30 weeks left at least...dude we are destroying this division for you.  You did as well as any of the other 3 we've faced so far.  Fucking go for it!  It'll be funny as hell when the standings read the brewers are ahead of the Cubs!
Brewers,34zhkc,Salesman89,2,Wed May 6 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"To get to a .500 record by the end of the season, they need to play at a better pace than they have since 2011. It's not going happen"

Other teams WILL pay for A Ram if you guys start selling.  You will get a good reload here I think and not have to wait that long to start winning again, even if that does mean next year."
Brewers,34zhkc,Cobruh,2,Wed May 6 03:56:31 2015 UTC,Cotts' FIP this year is definitely deserving that 3mm contract we gave him.

It's always so sad to read national writers' perspectives on the Brewers' future, because they're always so pessimistic. I haven't seen a single non-Brewers writer give a positive outlook on the Brewers' future as a franchise since, I don't know, early 2012?  And I really doubt that all of them are wrong - when Cameron lays it out that way, it really is tough to see the Brewers competing before 2018 or 2019 at the earliest. The Counsell excitement notwithstanding, the Brewers are in a bad, bad place as a franchise right now, and the sooner they realize it, the better off they are."
Brewers,34ydfv,wintva,2,Tue May 5 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Mark Attanasio knows this, but he is also worries about discouraging his fanbase and losing attendance. However, he may just have to bite that bullet soon."
Brewers,34ydfv,theamazingkiwi,3,Tue May 5 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"He is right, but it will never happen. M.A. wanted to build the franchise around Braun but he went and fucked that up. So now he has Lucroy who really resignates with the fans who see him as a tough, no nonsense, blue collar, hard working guy. I would be extremely surprised to see them reverse course unless a team offered an incredible haul of AA/AAA talent that could be MLB ready in 1-2 years.   Personally, with the shape this franchise is in, I'm not sure why you wouldn't listen to any offer. D.M. bet the farm (system) and it didn't work out. We need to rebuild that system. Take care of the roots so the plant can flourish and all that."
Brewers,34ydfv,madman86,6,Tue May 5 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"D.M. bet the farm (system) and it didn't work out.   I don't know if I'd say it didn't work out. Over the past few years, we've had a good solid ride. We've been contending. We had playoff appearances in '08 and '11. Which is pretty damn good for the Brewers. We were in position to have another one last year if we didn't collapse :( But either way... it's the cost of being a small market team in a big market game. You need to sell the farm if you want to contend once in a while."
Brewers,34ydfv,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue May 5 18:43:28 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"You need to sell the farm if you want to contend once in a while.   Unless you're the A's or Cardinals.  They are two teams that to me, seem to have a way of keeping their talent and not being top spenders."
Brewers,34ydfv,cheezturds,1 point,Tue May 5 19:34:08 2015 UTC,They can continually sell their farms (if they need to) because they have the skill to replenish it for free in the draft.  Jack Z. took that with him when he left.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,-2,Tue May 5 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"Tough, no nonsense, blue collar, hard working guy   no nonsense and hard working sure.  Tough and blue collar? No fucking chance. Lucroy plays soft, and the Giants won a world series due to him playing baseball like a fucking woman."
Brewers,34ydfv,Valleyoan,4,Tue May 5 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"Is it just me? I understand the talks about trading some guys like gogo and Luuuuuuuuuuuuuuc but fuck, we have good young talent. Why is everyone losing their minds and shit? Khris Davis will hit, not sure on scooter, Lind is killing it at 1b, seggy is coming around again. Our pitching staff veterans are reminding me of the awful signing of suppan, but willy and Jimmy should pan out and I'm not giving up hope on fiers. Am I crazy or overly optimistic?"
Brewers,34ydfv,juicebox608,8,Tue May 5 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say overly optimistic. Khris is already 27 and is barely an above average hitter. Plus he's not a good defender. Scooter is a platoon hitter. Jimmy and Wily aren't top of the rotation type studs. The issue is they have a lot of nice average/complementary pieces. They don't have any upcoming stars, like when they had the Braun/Fielder/Hart/Weeks/Gallardo group come up."
Brewers,34ydfv,wintva,1 point,Tue May 5 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think that's about right. Basically, the Brewers have a ton of good supporting role players (when they're all playing well), but need about three superstars to be a realistic contender. Those stars aren't in the farm system right now, and they're sure not coming via free agency, either.  Which leaves a) better drafting (a higher draft pick will help this year), and b) trades."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,1 point,Tue May 5 18:03:37 2015 UTC,I dunno if it'd be overly optimistic to think that Jimmy and Wily could be 2-3 guys in the rotation.  Jimmy still has some time to show just what he can do.  there have been some really nice flashes of brilliance there.
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,0,Tue May 5 19:01:15 2015 UTC,overly optimistic? Jimmy nelson is the best pitcher on the staff right now.
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,-1,Tue May 5 19:42:59 2015 UTC,I just mean he hasnt made it to Kershaw levels yet.  He isnt the number 1 on most staffs.
Brewers,34ydfv,prof_shine,1 point,Tue May 5 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Curious question: How many true #1s are there in MLB? How necessary is it to have a ""true ace""? I don't think it's quite like the NFL, where you really have to have a really good quarterback? I think Wily and Jimmy are young guys with a lot of room to grow. But we need another 2-3 guys like them once Lohse and Garza leave.  On the offensive side, we definitely need more talented bats. In 2008 and 2011, we had Braun and Prince in their primes, with an excellent supporting cast around them (Hardy, Corey, Weeks, Gogo, Nyjer, Luc). Now, we're left with the supporting cast, but without the star hitters. MAYBE if Braun gets ""it"" back, and Gogo and Luc come back roarin', and Siggy and Lind stay hot. But those are pretty big ""if""s.  But we should keep some of the young guys. Siggy and Jimmy and Wily are young, and could be important role players in 3-5 years. See if we can get some young studs in the system that'll be ready by 2017-18 or thereabouts.  In the meantime, why is our farm system so shitty today? We haven't really traded away any hot prospects in the last couple years, so why aren't there any studs waiting in the wings? Are we that bad at drafting? And/or are we that bad at player development? Can we get better at either, or both?"
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,-2,Tue May 5 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"In the meantime, why is our farm system so shitty today?   A couple bad trades and a lot of really shitty drafting, it seems."
Brewers,34ydfv,prof_shine,1 point,Tue May 5 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Which trades in particular? I know we traded away the farm for Granky and Marcum a few years ago, but those guys are in the pros now for KC and TO.  And why is the drafting so bad? Are our scouts bad, or is our player development bad? Can we poach some of the Cardinals' staff? It seems like they lose all of their best players every year, but there's always like a bunch of guys waiting to step in. Like some kind of frickin' hydra. How much do player development staff types get paid? It can't be more than we're [over-]paying for our mediocre roster."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,-1,Tue May 5 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure i can name other trades off the top of my hat other than that.  As to why drafting is so bad....your guess is as good as mine.  Maybe some bad luck, probably some bad scouting (we just got a new lead scout dude, so hopefully that'll change...?)  this must be what Bears fans feel like when they have to deal with knowing Ted Thompson is the Packers GM."
Brewers,34ydfv,Valleyoan,0,Tue May 5 21:44:11 2015 UTC,I think it has to do more with player development than scouting or anything else.   The brewers are very bad at developing talent.
Brewers,34ydfv,badger2015,0,Tue May 5 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"I think it is a little early to say Nelson is not going to be a top rotation guy.  I think he will show that by the end of the year.  Willy is inconsistent, but I think his good days are better than most other starters around, he just needs to become reliable (which is not impossible).  I think the bullpen is screwed for the future apart from Will Smith.  I would trade GoGo and Luc, but I think it is too far to say that the brewers won't compete for the next 3-4 years."
Brewers,34ydfv,madtownWI,0,Tue May 5 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, KD looks like a bust."
Brewers,34ydfv,juicebox608,0,Tue May 5 18:39:12 2015 UTC,I hear you guys. I'm just sad now.
Brewers,34ydfv,smiles134,0,Tue May 5 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Davis is replacement level talent essentially (a little better) and guys like Segura just aren't enough to build a team around. And then who after them? The reason everyone is so bleak is because we have an empty farm system. It was this group of guys or bust, and they busted."
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,2,Tue May 5 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"Let me start out by saying I like Jonathan Lucroy. Now comes the part that is hard for a lot of us Brewer fans to hear.   It doesnt make sense to hold on to Lucroy.   Considering that this team will not honestly contend for another 4+ years, what is the sense of keeping him? Sure he calls a good game and, yes, he had a way above average year last season. But what is he gonna be like 4 years down the road after taking 1,000 more foul tips to the face, legs feet, etc..?  Not to mention the beating a catchers knees take. sure he gets rested often but,he has already had 2 injuries this season and its only may 5th.  I say Trade him now while he still has value to a contender."
Brewers,34ydfv,unmisunderestimated,2,Tue May 5 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"I want to know what team is going to be willing to trade what 2.5 cheap seasons of Lucroy is worth. You're probably looking at multiple top prospects included in any deal.  As a +6 WAR player, he's worth $33 million at a cost of $5 million per year (assuming $5.5M/WAR). Realistically, that means any trade now would probably take a team's 3 best prospects. Probably no major leaguers included because the Brewers aren't going to want to take on any salary."
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,1 point,Wed May 6 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"I want developed young arms, already up in the bigs. Like an Archie Bradley type."
Brewers,34ydfv,Nadie_AZ,2,Wed May 6 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"That was a depressing read. But a few comments.  Maybe he has 5,000 more in his knees, but this isn’t a guy who is easily going to transition his skills to another position and remain an impact player  This is why the Brewers are having him learn first base. His bat is handy and if he can be a decent to good 1st baseman, we kill 3 birds with one stone (hitter, 1st baseman, Crew player into his mid 30s or so). Wouldn't it be nice to have him around for another 7 or 8 years? I think so.  Look, I say this every year. The Brewers goals should be .500. They are a small market team that got pretty exciting at a terrible cost. If you want a consistent outcome on the field, you have to plan for it. Oh how I wish we could shoot for .550 or .600 or better each year, but that's not in the cards any time soon.  So why toss away the whole damn thing in hopes that one day, in 5 years, we could be .600 for 2 years when we could continue to work with some key pieces and be .500 by next year and stay there?   I want a WS trophy as much as the next Brew Crew fan. But without true shared revenue that's not gonna be likely to happen. Not unless Attanasio has a TON of money he feels is burning holes in his pockets."
Brewers,34ydfv,sjm1541,1 point,Wed May 6 00:17:48 2015 UTC,I think that's a really pessimistic view of a franchise that has won 90+ games two times in the past 8 years and was one horrible collapse away from making the playoffs 3 times in 7 years.   The Brewers showed in the mid 2000s that they have the ability to rebuild and the money to bring on the extra pieces to fill in to make a deep run. There's no reason not to do a rebuild right now when this team is going nowhere but down.
Brewers,34ydfv,orange_lazarus1,3,Wed May 6 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"Because trade your best players for prospects has been successful for the Brewers thus far.    A great catcher is a game manager on the field and you need that to be a great team.  Just look at the Cards.  If anything I would look to move Braun, Gomez, or pitching.  With their trades I think they need to get guys who will be in the MLB by next season you can't be gambling on 2-3 yrs time."
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,2,Tue May 5 16:55:06 2015 UTC,When's the last time we've had to do a rebuild though? We haven't in recent memory.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"I really wish people proposing this sort of ""trade your way back to relevance!"" argument would provide some analytics about successful trades of this sort in the past.  Most often, those ""blue chip guys"" that come over in deals for established MLB players are fractionally as good as the player(s) dealt away.  Best I can tell, the fastest--and cheapest--way to acquire lots of great prospects is to select them at no transaction cost in the draft.  Until the Brewers do that well, there is no reason to entertain the idea of making the main club worse by trading away the guys we've had success with for more guys that we're not good at evaluating, anyway (i.e., prospects--the very commodities we are not good at evaluating at draft time).  We don't need to fire Melvin, we don't need to trade Lucroy, we don't need to jettison Gomez, we (arguably) didn't need to fire Roenicke (though I am very excited for the Counsell era).  What we DO need is an equivalent replacement for Jack Z."
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,6,Tue May 5 16:43:44 2015 UTC,I mean you can look at the Cubs and the Pirates right now. Both were laughing stocks as early as 5-6 years ago. Now both look like contenders.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,3,Tue May 5 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't directly address what I'm looking for.  What trades led to those resurgences?  The main boost for the Cubs (Bryant, Baez, Castro) were not acquired via trade.  The same is true for the Pirates (Cole, McCutchen, Alvarez, Marte, Polanco--none acquired via trade).  The Cubs got Addison Russell via trade, and they got Arrieta and Wood that way too, but only Samardzija was involved on the Cubs' end as a player with mega-status like Lucroy and Gomez.    Those examples highlight exactly what I emphasized in my post: the Brewers need to re-learn how to draft like they did when Jack Z. was making the picks."
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,2,Tue May 5 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"But they still had blue chip prospects that turned out. Sure, some of them won't be stars, but some of them will. The Brewers have next to nothing right now. We need to trade for some teams top prospects in order to compete in the next 4-6 years. With what we have now, we won't be competing within the next 10-12 years."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"Again, I think we're talking past each other.  You are saying ""trade guys for prospects--look at these examples!"" and I am saying ""draft properly to get your prospects--look at those very same examples!""  Trades had virtually no role in the examples you provided, and I'm arguing that we should view that as evidence that we need to emphasize DRAFTING better, and refrain from viewing a trade of our best players as any part of the process.  We need to be up in arms about our drafting, not about our trading.  People just don't have the patience to look at the draft, because it is too long-term compared to the trade route, which happens immediately.  But trading has a REMARKABLY dimished effect on the overall club compared to the drafting.  I think people are way too hyped with ""farm system rankings"" and where the Brewers are in that respect.  I'm not going to argue that the Brewers have anything close to an acceptable farm system.  But I am going to point to the fact that we've produced Lucroy, Gennett, Wily Peralta, and Braun, as well as Hector Gomez, Davis, and Jimmy Nelson (all wait-and-see) without ANY fanfare (save for Braun) from all of those national lists."
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,3,Tue May 5 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that we're talking past each other. I'll try to keep my idea simple, to avoid mis-speaking.  I think we need to trade for prospects to boost our farm system NOW. They can still be players that won't make the big club until 2018-19, but at least we'll have them then. If we wait and try drafting talent, we won't have these players at their peaks until the 2020s.  I agree we need to draft better. We've been awful the last few years. But unless we trade the players now for players in the future, we're simply going to lose out of the trade value of them and we'll get nothing in return. At least if we trade them and get prospects, we can hope we're competitive in 3-4 years, instead of 5-6 years."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 5 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"No worries about mis-speaking!  I've simply been claiming that there are very few instances to point to where trading MLB-level stars for prospects has produced anything worthwhile, even down the line (i.e., ""players that won't make the big club until 2018-19"").  But you keep arguing that we should do exactly that right now with Lucroy, without pointing to any evidence where that has worked in the past, which is all I keep asking for.  Assuming that a trade for Lucroy would result in little impact on the Brewers in the future (which is all I can work with without the evidence to the contrary that I've been asking for), your way nets us the loss of watching Lucroy, and maybe the ability to watch an MLB-replacement-level player in the future, my way nets us the ability to watch Lucroy (an MLB star) for 2 more seasons at the very least, and no MLB-replacement-level player after that.  Perhaps we just disagree, but I like my way better.  At least we agree that our drafting needs to improve!"
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,2,Tue May 5 18:59:08 2015 UTC,Do you really want to see a Joe Mauer situation happen to Lucroy? I certainly don't.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 19:20:53 2015 UTC,No--who mentioned anything about that?
Brewers,34ydfv,SpartanBuck,2,Tue May 5 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"They are a team full of replacement level players with Joe Mauer at the center of it. He's wasted now and because they can't trade him due to the huge contract, yeah, he'll finish his career as a Twin, but he'll never win anything.   I don't want that happening to Lucroy. I'd rather trade him for prospects and let him to go a team that can win before he's over the hill."
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,1 point,Tue May 5 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"I'd wait a bit before considering Baez and Bryant a success. Baez cant hit the broad side of a barn and kris Bryant's batting average has dropped points every single game he has played this season. If you can hit the ball 500 feet but carry a .230 average, you are more of a rob deer than a mike trout."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 5 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly--I think this furthers my point.  Even those ""can't miss"" guys actually, very often, are misses.  So why would we want to give up our rights to Lucroy for lottery tickets?"
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,2,Tue May 5 18:07:36 2015 UTC,because in 4 years his knees will be shot and he will be worth a fraction of what we can get for him now. IMO we need young pitching.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"But Lucroy's contract only runs through next season and the one after, so I don't think we should be concerned about his knees 4 years from now.    I do totally agree that we need young pitching.  If you trade Lucroy, you'll need a catcher too."
Brewers,34ydfv,Hosko817,2,Tue May 5 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Maldinado is already up. Catchers in general need only to call a decent game and frame pitches. It's nice to have a catcher that can hit but most teams don't have that luxury. In stead of ""prospects"" like so many on here suggest. I agree with you in the sense that, I'd rather trade lucroy for young pitching talent already up in the bigs with some experience. While complementing that with better scouting and draft choices."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 5 19:50:35 2015 UTC,I could get behind that approach (getting some established talent in return)--but I just don't think we're going to get someone to send us Matt Harvey or someone of that ilk for Lucroy.
Brewers,34ydfv,BrewCrewKevin,3,Tue May 5 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"From what I have read, Ray Montgomery is very well regarded and is the new scouting director. I hope he can be the start of restoring the farm with high level talent. So they have already made that step. To complement it though, they need to trade guys who don't have a future with the next successful Brewers team. Otherwise they're stuck in mediocrity."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 5 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Right. I've heard all good things about Ray as scouting director. But it's hard, because scouting is the long game. It takes a minimum of probably about 3 years to develop a player through the minors- most quite a bit longer. So we likely won't see any benefits for the next few years, at least from a scouting perspective."
Brewers,34ydfv,ryanjc30,1 point,Tue May 5 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be great if Montgomery pans out!  That is really what we need.  And if that happens, trading Lucroy or Gomez merely for the sake of trading them will be a drop in the bucket compared to the dividends paid by sound drafting.  So why not just enjoy Lucroy and Gomez?  Just one year ago we were all hyped about the start, and in for a pretty enjoyable summer (overall).  It is a razor-thin line in baseball between mediocre-bad and exciting-good.  We saw both sides of that line last year, and to me, that means things falling one way or the other for the big-league club is less volatile than the crapshoot you enter when trying to acquire prospects for proven commodities."

Brewers,34ydfv,BeHereNow91,1 point,Tue May 5 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, that is a really good example.  If all of the ""trade your studs for prospects"" deals worked like that one, I would be completely on board with trading Lucroy.  Instead, that's the one good example we've got where it worked for the selling team, and just off the top of my head   Sabathia Greinke (us-to-Angels) Sexson Schilling Miguel Cabrera (to Tigers)   where the prospects essentially amounted to nothing (jury perhaps still out on Brantley in the Sabathia deal, and Segura in the Greinke deal)."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"We just run a large risk with Lucroy if we're not able to sign him 2-3 years down the road.  The article is accurate in that we won't be the 2011 and 2012 team again for a while.  We just aren't built for it.  Meanwhile, we could reel in some great future talent for Lucroy, who's going to want $15-25mil/year (depending on his production going forward) when he signs a new deal.  I'm not sure if Milwaukee is willing to risk that much, especially with Braun crippling us with his contract.  The article poses us as a team who is going to lose Lucroy either way, so why not get something for him while we can?"
Brewers,34ydfv,BeHereNow91,2,Tue May 5 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"Well, all of my posts in this thread have been arguing counter to trading Lucroy because 1) we are not in the ""get something while you can"" position, since we have him signed for 2.5 more years, not 0.5 like the Greinke case; 2) there are exceedingly few instances to point to where that approach has worked (so far, your case with the Royals is the only instance anyone's brought up where the selling team came out even or ahead); and 3) we are not entertaining discussion of what to do after Lucroy's contract is up (i.e., pay big bucks, whatever), because all we're focusing on are the merits of trading him right now (or not).    So my answer would be: I wouldn't trade him because we have one of the best catchers in the league for 2.5 more seasons (at least), and trading him is very unlikely to make the Brewers closer to competing than merely drafting well would.  Given that it is unlikely to make a difference long-term, I would rather watch the Brewers with Lucroy in the lineup every day for 2.5 years rather than watch them with Maldonado (or whatever scrub) in the lineup every day for 2.5 years.  By the time 2017 rolls around things might be different, since we will be in the ""get something or get nothing"" position, but that is not us right now."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"But by 2017, you're looking at trading him in his walk year after he's lost most of his value.  We can trade him now to just about any team because of his team-friendly deal, and if we're not going to compete in the next 2-3 seasons, I don't know why we'd retain him.    He's coming off of what will probably be the best season of his career.  His value is higher now than it ever will be.  If you're ultimately going to trade him, there's no point in holding off for two years."
Brewers,34ydfv,ShoopALoop11,0,Tue May 5 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"Well, see my other posts in this thread for my reasons, I guess.  It seems like everyone is totally stoked around here to watch a AAA team get smothered in losses for the next few years while some prospects ""develop"" their way up into Ariel Penas and Junior Spiveys."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"Agree with almost everything but Melvin. The guy has got to go he's had too many chances. This is coming from someone who used to be a fan. Mediocrity (baseball purgatory) isn't gonna cut it. I'm grateful for him and the glory years, but it's time for a change."
Brewers,34ydfv,Schlitz001,1 point,Tue May 5 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough--I just disagree, though.  Melvin brought perennially competitive teams with him, which were never here for the two decades before him.  I find it hard to weigh the balance of his decisions and find the scale tipped to the negative side.  In fact, I think it's overwhelmingly positive.  Even now, when the Brewers are at a low point, I have a hard time looking at the lineups before a game and thinking, ""man, how did it come to this?"" like I used to before he got here.  I legitimately feel that there is a good chance for a win (or at least a competitive game) nearly every day.    Besides, I have a really hard time identifying candidates out there on the market that I'd be confident would increase those competitive chances over what Melvin's done."
Brewers,34ydfv,dutchoven21,0,Tue May 5 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Some of the key players on the Brewers right now were obtained by trading away established major league talent.  Gomez for Hardy.  Segura for Greinke.  Will Smith for Nori Aoki.  And all of the Brewers in the trades I mentioned have been much cheaper than the player they were traded away for, which is half of the reason they were acquired in the first place.  Not every trade is going to pan out, but roster flexibility is half the battle.  I'm a firm believer that you either need to be winning now or preparing to win in the future.  Nobody has ever been excited about a .500 team with a few star players.  Let the rebuild begin."
Brewers,34ydfv,Valleyoan,1 point,Tue May 5 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"Lucroy is under team control through 2017 though, and he's only making $3 million this year, $4 million next year, and the 2017 team option he'd make $5.25 million. Financially speaking, there's no real reason to trade Lucroy, his contract is a steal."

Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,2,Tue May 5 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"It certainly is. Getting Lucroy for 2+ years on a dirt cheap contract helps his trade value a ton, but that's not what /u/Schlitz001 was saying."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,0,Wed May 6 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"The Gomez-for-Hardy deal was a great one (for the Brewers).  But in that case, we knew we had Alcides Escobar to step right in for Hardy.  We have no mega-prospect behind Lucroy.    Also, the issue is most defintiely NOT Lucroy's salary--there is absolutely no need to trade him to get ""cheaper.""  In fact, neither the Greinke nor the Aoki deals were made for that reason, either, so I don't think it's fair to say   which is half of the reason they were acquired in the first place.    We needed bullpen help and had Braun moving to RF when we traded Aoki.  And it was ""get something or nothing"" for Greinke, since he was gone in 3 months if we didn't deal him then.  Neither of those instances fits what we'd be doing if we traded Lucroy.   Let the rebuild begin.   Yes, by making good draft choices."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"In fact, neither the Greinke nor the Aoki deals were made for that reason, either, so I don't think it's fair to say   Im pretty sure Greinke is making a lot more now than he was at the time...no?  Aoki wasnt so much a money thing, but simply that we didnt 'need' him and had a good offer."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,1 point,Tue May 5 20:27:12 2015 UTC,"But we were never on the hook to pay that money to Greinke.  He signed that contract after we had already traded him.  So arguing that we had to ""dump his salary and get cheaper players because Greinke was so expensive on our payroll"" as the reason for that trade is just wrong.  We traded Greinke because we were out of contention at the deadline and we could salvage a bit of value from holding his rights by trading him at the deadline.  Lucroy holds tremendously more value for the Brewers right now than Greinke did at the 2012 deadline.  And that value is not limited to being extracted only through a trade.  (And I've been arguing in this thread that we would squander far more of his value by trading him now than we would by not trading him now.)"
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"Lucroy is going to be asking for a bigger contract soonish as well, though.  Can we afford to pay him good money for the next 5 years if 4 of them are going to be a shitfest?  Gomez is even more in that boat.  After next season hes going to squeeze every penny possible out of some team, why why not move him and get something for him before then?  Im not saying to do this stuff today, but if by the deadline its pretty obvious were still just going to be a .500 team at best, theres no point in getting something instead of nothing for them."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,1 point,Tue May 5 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Im not saying to do this stuff today, but if by the deadline its pretty obvious were still just going to be a .500 team at best, theres no point in getting something instead of nothing for them.   Ah, well there is the big point.  Everyone here--and the article OP linked to--is advocating trading Lucroy right now.  I think that's nonsense for the reasons I've pointed out.  Gomez's case is most definitely different from Lucroy's.  As the time draws near, if it is still obvious that we won't be competing by the time his contract is up, extracting value by trading him (like we did with Greinke) would make sense.  And, as the time draws near for Lucroy, if it is still obvious that we won't be competing by the time his contract is up, extracting value by trading him (like we did with Greinke) would make sense.  But that time is not now, for either of them.  It is quite possible that trading them now--too soon--would actually be detrimental to the Brewers.  For example: we trade Lucroy for prospects (like everyone here wants to do), and those prospects all flop (a very reasonably likely outcome).  Now we've lost Lucroy, face of the franchise, and the fan revenue that would come from his services for the next couple of seasons.  So we're out revenue--potentially a lot of it--that we could use to retain a player or sign a new one.  And we have nothing to show for it."
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"The one big argument for trading Luc is that his performance last year may have been a bit of a fluke, so right now his trade value would be higher than a year from now.  I dunno if thats true or not.  Hes a great player, but his numbers last year were pretty crazy, especially for a catcher."
Brewers,34ydfv,Schlitz001,1 point,Tue May 5 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose I agree with you there that he might regress.  But, have a look at the stats: http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lucrojo01.shtml.  Last season wasn't really that ridiculous, except for the doubles.  (By that, I mean that his stats were far from massive outliers compared to his full body of work.  Only the doubles stick out like a sore thumb, really.)"
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,1 point,Tue May 5 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, by making good draft choices.   You make it sound so easy."
Brewers,34ydfv,dutchoven21,1 point,Tue May 5 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"Ha--no, it definitely is not easy.  I'm saying the rebuild needs to come from making good draft choices, not from trading our players for prospects.  If you think drafting well is easy--and you are completely correct that it is not--it is even more difficult to successfully rebuild via trade."
Brewers,34ydfv,killafofun,1 point,Tue May 5 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"You're right about Luc & Aoki's contracts, because they're both incredibly team friendly. But Greinke was still making like $13+ million when we traded him in 2012. I still think the fact that we were going to lose him 3 months later anyway was a much bigger factor, but his contract probably helped provide more incentive to trade him."
Brewers,34ydfv,necropaw,-1,Tue May 5 20:56:04 2015 UTC,I know the packers are a different sport and the NFL is an entirely different structure than the mlb but the packers are good because they draft well and don't give up too much for someone that's not going to be good in 3 years.
Brewers,34ydfv,phoenix9797,3,Tue May 5 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Eh.  you hit on it, the NFL is a different animal.  The Brewers cant afford to sign multiple top tier guys after their contract is up.  Those guys tend to go to teams like the Dodgers that have unlimited money to spend.  The MLB would be more like us having to get rid of Aaron and Clay about a year or two ago and develop new guys every 3-5 years."
Brewers,34ydfv,zmichalo,1 point,Tue May 5 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And there are obvious examples of that winning strategy in MLB, too: the Cardinals, for example.  They make MLB-level trades, but it is exceedingly rare that they dump guys just to get some prospects in return."

We got a chance to buy through the lotto, and by the time we got logged on and everything, all that was left was ""3rd home game.""   Keep in mind it's a 5 game series, and the Brewers hadn't even clinched yet. So the only way this was going to happen was:   Brewers make the NLDS. Get Homefield Advantage. Series goes to game 5.   But those things all happened. I was ecstatic when game 4 ended, and I realized we were going to get to the decisive game 5. We all took off of work, all made it down really early to tailgate. The atmosphere outside the stadium was electric.  Then we got inside... holy shit. Any given moment in that game was louder than I had ever heard Miller Park before. We had rally towels, and we didn't sit down the whole game. Every strike was a celebration. Every ball was frustration. I was so anxious.  Especially in the 9th. Axford wasn't exactly giving away the game in Axford fashion- he was battling today, but this was war. Arizona was being scrappy. They got a couple singles to get a guy on 3rd. And a safety squeeze tied the game. Luckily, Axford was able to get out of the inning with a tie.  Then... this happened. Gomez hits a single. The pitcher is checking him constantly. But you know he's going to steal. He has to. And he does, and the catcher can't field it cleanly! So in scoring position. He's the guy you want there, for sure. The crowd is on their feet, this is do or die time. We are jumping because standing in this situation wasn't enough. When we saw that T-Plush hit make it through, we went fucking bizerk. People were jumping and screaming and falling over with excitement. now THAT was the loudest I'd heard. Fireworks go off, confetti drops, and  the players are out celebrating. That right there was one of the best feelings of our lives.   We sat in that stadium until security kicked us out, just reflecting on what was sure to be the best Brewer game I had ever seen.  ...Wow. Gives me shivers just thinking about it."
Brewers,34ut22,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue May 5 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"YES!  I was there as well, and I think you summed things up perfectly.  We then proceeded to party in the lot until security kicked us out of there as well"
Brewers,34ut22,bnuttz,1 point,Tue May 5 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a nerd, but sometimes I like to go back and watch some of the annoying phone videos, just to bring back those memories of how crazy the stadium was.  this one  this one  this one  etc"
Brewers,34ut22,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue May 5 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"I long for another year where the stadium gets this crazy.  I was at the game that they clinched the NL Central.  Watching the Cubs beat the Cardinals on the big screen to clinch was just surreal.  I didn't want to leave that night.  Then the energy in the stadium during the playoff games.  Man, I wish it was like that again."
Brewers,34ut22,xsists,3,Fri May 8 16:53:33 2015 UTC,Yep
Brewers,34ut22,smiles134,12,Tue May 5 02:15:50 2015 UTC,We need another player with the personality of Nyjer Morgan. He just seemed to have a way of getting everyone amped up.
Brewers,34ut22,cheezturds,4,Tue May 5 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"God I loved him, so sad he left.  Love that Tony Plush"
Brewers,34ut22,MyHorseIsAmazinger,3,Tue May 5 02:39:33 2015 UTC,He's the type of guy that's great for a winning team and terrible for a losing team.  A guy that emotional and vocal can't just turn it off on a losing streak.
Brewers,34ut22,jn2010,1 point,Tue May 5 12:24:44 2015 UTC,Most other teams that had him would not agree. His antics were a hazard half the time.
Brewers,34ut22,ksprzk,4,Tue May 5 04:40:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember that. However it seemed to work well with the group the Brewers had.
Brewers,34ut22,cheezturds,1 point,Tue May 5 05:16:26 2015 UTC,He cleaned up his act in Milwaukee (for the most part).
Brewers,34ut22,prof_shine,3,Tue May 5 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"I was second row from the top section 418.  As soon as that ball was hit i jumped and almost fell into the people infront of me which turned into high fives. As we left everyone was high fiving chanting brewers and doing beast mode.  Showed up to work drunk the next day, rough day was worth it."
Brewers,34ut22,quickstop_rstvideo,3,Tue May 5 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"You can watch the entire game  Morgan got two solid FUCK YEAH's into the mic on national TV, so that was awesome."
Brewers,34ut22,aaronwhite1786,2,Tue May 5 04:51:02 2015 UTC,"I was at that game. Wayyyyyyyy the hell up there, but I was there. That was unreal. The level of noise in that building was unbelievable, there was a ton of confetti, and most of the fans stuck around for quite a while just going bonkers. Definitely one of my favorite memories."
Brewers,34ut22,killallthejuice,2,Tue May 5 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"Was at the game, I just remember having a near heart attack from K-Rod and Axford and when Morgan hit the ball into the outfield I just said ""Oh my God"" over and over again and hugged my friend.  That confetti raining down just made to moment so surreal.  I can't wait to get back to the playoffs that's why last season was so heartbreaking."
Brewers,34ut22,brewcrew2_2,1 point,Tue May 5 03:41:55 2015 UTC,I'll never get tired of watching that. Best game I've ever been to.
Brewers,34ut22,MrMyxolodian,1 point,Tue May 5 02:58:16 2015 UTC,Had to rewatch this 2008 Final Week highlight video after watching this Nyjer vid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5pTk6Vvr8  The tears are flowin.  Game 162 of the 2008 season is still my favorite game attended.  That felt so damn good.

Brewers,34ut22,HotKarll,1 point,Tue May 5 14:29:30 2015 UTC,2011 was the last time Craig Counsell was in the dugout in uniform...until Monday.
Brewers,34usl7,Cheesehead_Dave,5,Mon May 4 19:07:01 2015 UTC,rreeaacchhiinngg.   heh heh heh. get it?
Brewers,34usl7,ksprzk,3,Mon May 4 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to do Counsell, change a light bulb?!"
Brewers,34usl7,ccruner13,1 point,Tue May 5 00:12:38 2015 UTC,This is incredible
Brewers,34usl7,PathofTotality,1 point,Mon May 4 23:25:35 2015 UTC,Haha!  Thats perfect!
Brewers,34usl7,cday119,1 point,Tue May 5 02:51:13 2015 UTC,I thought it was closer to The Witcher Strong Stance
Brewers,34u1sn,bad_llama,12,Mon May 4 15:45:39 2015 UTC,That's pretty surprising.  They must have been lining him up to replace RR for a while.  I thought this would have been more of an interim/trial run for CC.
Brewers,34u1sn,BeHereNow91,10,Mon May 4 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"I, too, assume that this had been lined up since the end of last season. The plan was probably to let Roenicke walk at the end of this season and then let Counsell take over. However, the contingency plan was probably to let Roenicke go if the end of last season followed over. Which, as we have seen, it did.  I mean, I don't think Anastasio or Melvin (or just about anybody really) is going to publicly shit on their manager because it's got to be terrible for morale of not only him, but also the team. But I would be skeptical if somebody told me that those above Roenicke have not been discussing this for some time now."
Brewers,34u1sn,SolidRambo,2,Mon May 4 16:38:30 2015 UTC,How does RR walk after this season if he got an extension through 2016?
Brewers,34u1sn,THECrew42,2,Mon May 4 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"That's why this is so strange.  Extending RR for the next two seasons doesn't really play into the idea that they wanted CC to take over soon.  And they obviously want CC to take over, because they've signed him through 2017."
Brewers,34u1sn,BeHereNow91,3,Mon May 4 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think the plan was to go straight to CC though.  From what they said, sounds like this decision came from MA.  As a result, Doug had to find a replacement.  I'm sure he didn't want to do this on an interim basis, so they gave him through 2017.  And anyways, it's not like contract end dates actually matter."
Brewers,34u1sn,THECrew42,5,Mon May 4 20:41:21 2015 UTC,Where do you think he is going to bat himself in the order?
Brewers,34u1sn,u2knapp,8,Mon May 4 19:00:12 2015 UTC,He'll be a pinch hitter every game I suspect.
Brewers,34u1sn,madman86,4,Mon May 4 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"It is a trial run, but when we are going to blow it up this year you can't expect him to compete with the leftovers. 3 years will give them idea of his style and weather or not he can actually manage. In 3 years, they are expecting to be competitive again with the talent the gain in the forthcoming fire sale. I think this is a smart move. Let him get some work under his belt during the re-build. If he does good, reward him with an extension and see if he can get them to the next level."
Brewers,34u1sn,Uranus_Hz,3,Mon May 4 17:02:46 2015 UTC,I've always liked Counsell. I hope he has great success.
Brewers,34u1sn,quickstop_rstvideo,5,Mon May 4 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"""thats a bold strategy Cotton, lets see if it pays off for'em"""
Brewers,34u1sn,sonofsohoriots,2,Mon May 4 16:32:50 2015 UTC,Could this be insurance against a new GM coming in and completely cleaning house?
Brewers,34u1sn,Uranus_Hz,1 point,Mon May 4 19:04:18 2015 UTC,I even liked him when this happened
Brewers,34u1sn,evixir,1 point,Mon May 4 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Super fucking excited about this.  Huge Counsell fan for years, dat weird batting stance and everything."

Brewers,34v5ki,BeHereNow91,3,Mon May 4 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they are butt-hurt by the firing. Ultimately the manager is responsible for getting the players ready to play, which clearly they were not. Additionally, DM, MA, and RR all met about 2 weeks ago (according to DM) and they were asking what is different between the club that led the central for most of last year and the team that collapsed and the continued the slide this year? Apparently RR said he didn't have an answer for that. Not a good sign. I think that ultimately ended up costing him the job. If he can't give a quick analysis of what he feels is different (even if it isn't correct) then he isn't paying enough attention to the club house.   I like RR and I think he is a good guy. I just don't think he is the manager this team needs."

Brewers,34ty47,emsqrd,6,Mon May 4 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of choosing Counsell, but the thought of a three year deal seems like a stretch to me. Especially without any other experience to go on.   I think I would've rather seen just the single year deal to see what he does. Or a two year deal, even, if you want to avoid the dreaded ""lame duck"" season."
Brewers,34ty47,necropaw,8,Mon May 4 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is them going full in on rebuilding mode.  Craig knows our minors system and everything, you know?  Hes a good choice if thats what theyre doing, and frankly i think thats what we need to do."

Brewers,34ty47,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon May 4 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"Gotta love it. I love Craig. But the situation scares me a little bit.  Craig is a local guy who has always been a part of the Brewers. He played for us, helped manage the team as an assistant in the office, and has always been a fan. He's a very logical and exciting choice.  But because he's such a good fit, it sort of scares me given the circumstances. Because I don't see the Brewers being able to fire him, no matter what. Because he's so beloved in this town. That can be dangerous.  And I guess, personality-wise, I don't see him being that different from RR. He's going to maybe have more respect from the players, and new managers always give the team a different dynamic, but he's not going to be the passionate guy we're looking for to contrast RR. Craig is also going to be very level headed. He's not going to give a lot of specific answers, he's going to be very diplomatic about it as well. Even in the press conference just now, when asked what ideas he has for changing the team up, he says ""Well, we just need to get these players playing to the best of their ability, and try to win games. We'll see what happens. Sounds very Ron-esque to me.  TL;DR: Excited about it, but also nervous given the circumstances he's taking over in."
Brewers,34ty47,prof_shine,2,Mon May 4 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to judge someone's managerial skills based on what they say at press conferences. You're always going to get bland, generically optimistic answers at these things. They don't want to tip their hands.  And the Brewers (and their fans) should absolutely be willing to fire him if he doesn't work out. ""Hometown guy"" or not. I'd be disappointed if he didn't work out, but I'd be more disappointed if they kept the wrong guy around just because of his history with the team and the region."
Brewers,34ty47,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon May 4 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'd be disappointed if he didn't work out, but I'd be more disappointed if they kept the wrong guy around just because of his history with the team and the region.   Me too. But Craig is a local celebrity. He has been for a long time. It's like hiring Aaron Rodgers on to coach the packers after he  retires. As bad as he is at coaching, there will be a lot of homer fans who will have a hard time coming to terms with it.  And during his playing career, he was always level headed as well. If I know Craig, he's going to be a very level-headed manager. I guess you are right in that he's not going to tip his hand and specifically say ""we'll bunt less"" or ""We'll shift less"" or ""i think our starters tend to stay in too long."" But I can't see him being a fiery outspoken manager is all.  And I guess it just scares me because he's such an ideal fit, that I'd almost rather he took on a good team. It's not going to be easy to step into a team in a historic slump and be optomistic about it. On the other hand, he certainly can't hurt, and even if this team starts playing .500 ball, people will love him."
Brewers,34ty47,wintva,3,Mon May 4 17:11:02 2015 UTC,It's like hiring Aaron Rodgers on to coach the packers after he retires.   I'd say it's closer to hiring John Kuhn to coach the Packers after he retires.

I dont think he'd be fired.  Taken out of the managing role?  Sure, but they'll stuff him back into the front office.  I wouldnt doubt if thats the plan as is.  Sell off, let Craig take over for now.  In 3 years when the talent is coming back take a look at it.  If hes doing well and is the manager we want/need, let him keep going.  If not, move him back into the front office and hire a new guy."
Brewers,34ty47,Hosko817,1 point,Mon May 4 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I like the hire but,I would have brought him in right before the Cubs series or just after the Dodgers series. Nothing like facing Kershaw and a hot Dodgers team your first day on the job."

Still a lot of fun baseball to be had but also a lot more work and changes are necessary. I'm nervous.

Brewers,34s4b4,nutty15,7,Mon May 4 03:46:46 2015 UTC,What made him a good manager? Serious question.
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,25,Mon May 4 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Ron's good:   Utilized defensive shifts well Didn't get into bullshit macho beanball wars Was fine with the guys on the team playing with some personality Let the players do what they do best and didn't take the bat out of good hitters hands too often Didn't abuse starters Players seemed to like him   Ron's bad:   Mark Fucking Kotsay starting in CF in the playoffs Still bunted too much, didn't utilize his guys with speed enough Played too traditionally with the bullpen Didn't challenge enough   There's way worse out there, and the likelihood of them getting someone worse is exceptionally high if they go to the well of currently unemployed ex-managers."
Brewers,34s4b4,nutty15,10,Mon May 4 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Other than the defensive shifts the rest of the pros are kind of ""don't be an idiot"" traits though.  One pro you did miss is that he wears this sweet ass hat during spring training.  http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/850/984/hi-res-74fe04be234c0a0dd54ab4aed2ae312c_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75"
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,9,Mon May 4 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Ron's ""don't be an idiot"" traits aren't universally held (see: Gibson, Gardenhire, Baker,) and the stuff he does poorly are the things that just about every manager also does poorly."
Brewers,34s4b4,franklin_stubbs,-8,Mon May 4 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"So, just let players do their thing.  Why even have a manager then? Seems like a manager like that isn't capable of lighting a fire under guys asses, so when things get tough he still just says ""Welp, guys just keep doing your thing - it'll work eventually!""  Eventually the guys realize they get paid the same no matter what, so why even bother? The boss won't get on your ass...you just play cards on the plane, enjoy some ballpark buffets and coast through the season. Seems like a great gig for the players, but sucks for us fans.  If thats how Roenecke manages then fuck him, lets get a guy with some balls who wants to win. We dont have the payroll to coast through the season. We need to bust our asses like...dare I say it... Kansas City did last year.  Maybe it's just a cultural thing in Milwaukee?  Edit: Gimme a fucking break downvoters for hating Roenecke. What the fuck did the guy do for us? Im also drunk."
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,1 point,Mon May 4 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"Not getting on people's asses for sucking and not having your good hitters bunt just because That's What You Do are two entirely separate things. He probably was sliding too far into the ""player's manager"" side of things to get stuff swung around when it needed, and realistically the personality management aspect of being a manager is probably their most important role, but that's a personality thing, not an in-game strategy thing."
Brewers,34s4b4,franklin_stubbs,-4,Mon May 4 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I follow your ridiculous 2nd sentence buddy.  Over the course of 162 games, motivating players and managing off days is about the most important thing. None of us have any idea how Roenecke was in the lockerroom, dugout, plane rides, etc, so for people to say ""He was a good manager"" is pretty dumb. WTF has he does as a manager?   Jack shit. The answer is jack shit.  The team last year had an incredible free fall and Roenecke had no idea how to stop it. Still hadn't figured it out after the off season.  Maybe this team also needs new clubhouse leadership. Braun, Lucroy, Gomez and co arent getting it done. None of the pitchers seem to want to be the ace. So just fire everyone at this point it seems."
Brewers,34s4b4,sjm1541,1 point,Mon May 4 03:22:31 2015 UTC,I think you're looking way too far into how much leaders affect a teams performance vs how talented a team is. The Brewers free fall was more just them coming back down to earth/luck more than anything else. Why was the pitching so good in Sept/Oct but not the offense? Did Roenicke only motivate half of the team? These last two months are more of an average team facing bad luck than a product of their manager.   How was Ozzie Guillen able to win a WS and manager 69 and 72 win teams over his career? He's an extremely firey guy and yet his poor teams still couldn't win.
Brewers,34s4b4,franklin_stubbs,-4,Mon May 4 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Its more than just being firey or calm. It's picking your spots. Torre and La Russa were probably masters of letting guys play but getting on their ass when needed. They were consistent winners.  Sure, we dont have enough talent to win, but I dont think that excuses Roenecke."
Brewers,34s4b4,sjm1541,2,Mon May 4 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Roenicke should avoid blame either. Torre and LaRussa consistently had great teams though and it showed. Not to say they weren't good managers, but Roenicke won 96 games with the best team he was given. You look a lot worse when the talent isn't there."
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,1 point,Mon May 4 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you that his personality isn't right for a team that needs to be blasted out of their funk. That much is obvious.  Tactically, though, I don't think he was all that bad and was an okay fit for the team as it's currently constructed."
Brewers,34s4b4,franklin_stubbs,-2,Mon May 4 03:42:42 2015 UTC,How was he a good manager?
Brewers,34s4b4,PigFarmington,0,Mon May 4 02:43:37 2015 UTC,Won't work without Melvin gone too.   Sox need to ax Ventura too.
Brewers,34s4b4,fly1ngorb,20,Mon May 4 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"Bo Ryan recently sold his house.  The Badgers are being honored tomorrow night.  It's all coming together, Bo Ryan is the new manager.  In all seriousness, I wish him well if he's not done with baseball.  Bottom line is, there isn't a manager that would survive a monumental collapse followed by the worst start in franchise history.  Weird timing, but what can you say?"
Brewers,34s4b4,Valleyoan,9,Mon May 4 02:41:25 2015 UTC,Odds are he'll be in the world series in a few years while coaching another team.

Brewers,34s4b4,Docter_Bogs,26,Mon May 4 02:20:01 2015 UTC,I can't wait for everyone to credit RR's firing for our inevitable regression to the mean
Brewers,34s4b4,miamiflashfan,9,Mon May 4 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, this team is bad but they're not 8-17 bad. We've been unlucky in pretty much every luck-based statistic."
Brewers,34s4b4,BrewCrewKevin,3,Mon May 4 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"No, there's no way this is the mean. If this is the mean, that would mean we are about the worst team in baseball history, on pace for 30-some wins.   Brain is an all star. Lucroy is an all star. Gomez is a fiery all star. Ramirez is a seasoned pro. Lind is doing awesome. Lohse and Garza are seasoned vets and our young pitchers have a ton of potential.  We may not be a 95-win world series team,  but we're also not a record breaking pathetic."
Brewers,34s4b4,miamiflashfan,4,Mon May 4 11:34:14 2015 UTC,"By regressing to the mean, he's implying that we'll improve."
Brewers,34s4b4,Docter_Bogs,2,Mon May 4 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is exactly what I meant. We were going to be way better than 0.320 over the rest of the season whether we fired RR or not. I'm just predicting that everyone will credit the firing to our turnaround when it really probably will have nothing to do with it."
Brewers,34s4b4,necropaw,9,Mon May 4 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Wait, is this a thing?  No, really.  im kinda drunk.    I mean, look...we were calling for it, but they just won a series...."

Actually I think there's only one, Johan Santana. Now obviously, that just means another one is due./s but this kid isn't it and here's why I really think so:   the pirates themselves obviously didn't see enough to even 40 man him, let alone 25 man him, and albeit they've been pretty abysmal developing pitching themselves, they probably didn't even think he was worth the $50K they would've had to pay for him back if the brewers would've wanted to option him to the minors last year.   secondly, he didn't show a glimpse of anything special when he got in to blow outs. He got destroyed cause his fastball was too straight.  He hasn't Pitched more than 50 innings in a year in America.   He's only shone well in exhibition showcases like spring training and afl.  he's getting destroyed in a pitchers friendly FSL. Granted, he had a quality start today.   No other team wanted him when they had the chance.  Guess what I'm saying is I'd risk it."

Brewers,34s4b4,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon May 4 04:42:52 2015 UTC,Nightengale made it sound like Attanasio made the ultimate decision. Something that seems to happen too much
Brewers,34s4b4,BraveChewWorld,4,Mon May 4 05:55:36 2015 UTC,"Would've rather have seen both him and Melvin go at the same time.  I honestly don't want to hear Melvin saying shit about this firing. He needs to keep his stupid fucking mouth shut, cause everybody and their mom knows he's probably as much, if not more, to blame for this piece of shit roster and it's performance. He's been making some of the worst fucking moves ever.   The Parra trade was absolutely fucking retarded whether anyone really wants to believe it or not. Here's my logic as to why: WEI CHUNG WANG is a completely unproven nobody who qualified for the Rule 5 on a fluke, we make the stupid ass decision to grab him, and 25-man roster him nearly all of last year, except for his fake DL assignment. Each spot on the 25-man roster is huge in todays game, you need some kind of production or purpose out of each man to be successful. I firmly believe without a doubt, that roster spot played a role in us not making playoffs last year. We had this rookie-league pitcher on the roster because we were sooooo dire for LHP in the organization. Which I understand, we were/are.   So what do we do since we're in so much need for LHP? We trade one of our best young LHP for a random old 4th OF?! The front office keeps saying one thing, then doing another.  And don't get me started on the AAA team. They've played almost identical to the big league club through this horrific stretch. Dominated almost all of last year, then blew it in the end.. and are absolute trash this year."
Brewers,34s4b4,jn2010,1 point,Mon May 4 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with you about Parra, but... I mean, come on. The Brewers really needed a left-handed bat down the stretch, and Parra brings a lot of versatility to what is a pretty one-dimensional outfield in all three spots. And I think you're overstating Banda's importance a bit, he only ever got as high as Low-A and was the 27th ranked prospect in the system in 2013.  Don't get me started on Wang though, that was a dumpster fire from start to finish."
Brewers,34s4b4,wintva,2,Mon May 4 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"That doesn't surprise me, but it surprises me that it happened now.  We'll go into full trading mode now.  Hopefully Garza, Loshe, and Ramirez hold some value yet.  If we could unload Braun, I'd be ecstatic."

Brewers,34s4b4,squeakyshoe89,0,Mon May 4 04:07:29 2015 UTC,Despicable. It's not Ron's fault he had nothing to work with this year - this is the simple case of Melvin making Ron the scapegoat before anyone realized who's truly at fault here. (cough perhaps the GM that trades away all our prospects for overpaid past-their-prime pitchers that have a falling out a year after we acquire them... It might be a long couple of years my friends.)
Brewers,34s4b4,RacerX2727,3,Mon May 4 02:45:31 2015 UTC,I agree to a certain extent but when you go into this long of a slump especially offensively when we know we have to players to do it IMO it has something to do with the coaching staff.
Brewers,34s4b4,Amoney8612,3,Mon May 4 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"Despicable.   lol, They're 31 and 65 since July 1st of last year. That's not even despicable, that's downright fucking pathetic.   FIRE DOUG MELVIN campaign starts now."

Brewers,34s4b4,EthyleneGlycol,3,Mon May 4 03:28:24 2015 UTC,"And Marcum's 2011 was pretty solid.  I too cannot recall any trades where we've emptied the farm for a pitcher.  Free agents, perhaps, but that doesn't hurt the farm"
Brewers,34s4b4,CJL13,1 point,Mon May 4 03:37:42 2015 UTC,Do it sooner rather than later to see if they can turn it around with someone else before trading everyone?
Brewers,34s4b4,intheview,-1,Mon May 4 02:31:53 2015 UTC,At this point its hoping we can just get a player to perform well enough for a team to want him.
Brewers,34s4b4,StairsToAttic,1 point,Mon May 4 03:11:26 2015 UTC,I'm kinda shocked that they fired him when things seem to be turning around.  He wasn't going to be back next year but after sticking with him through the 2-13 start I figured they were just going to stay the course and finish out the year.  I hope Mark hasn't gotten it into his head that they still have a shot at the playoffs and just needed a new manager.  We desperately need to rebuild and if we don't do it this year we'll be stuck.
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,1 point,Mon May 4 02:37:16 2015 UTC,Don't think you can walk away from your bet because of this; you know who you are.
Brewers,34s4b4,wintva,-1,Mon May 4 03:18:28 2015 UTC,"It's a good thing there's a long list of high class major league managers just sitting around waiting for the Brewers to pick up that phone and offer them a job.   but seriously, why do you act like good managers just grow on trees? roenicke was pretty much as good as this club was going to get. as far as quality managers go, it's down hill from here."
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,-8,Mon May 4 02:36:52 2015 UTC,I'd like to see the Brewers hire Ron Gardenhire at some point. He had a nice long run with the Twins and I think he probably just got a little stagnant there.
Brewers,34s4b4,DEUCE_SLUICE,10,Mon May 4 02:25:43 2015 UTC,"NO. Gardenhire is the most old-school dumbass manager possible, and I don't want him sticking around for years after receiving credit for the inevitable regression back to playing at their talent level."

Brewers,34sgkp,Downrazor1,-12,Tue May 5 15:17:40 2015 UTC,".... c'mon guys, roenicke was a fucking idiot.  guy was handed the best roster in baseball in 2011, and should've EASILY won over 100 games with the amazing lineup and pitching, and the dumb fuck started casey mcgehee until august, batting around the mendoza line.... just swapping him out would have netted us another 10 wins. he is basically ned yost 2.0"
Brewers,34sf47,NotfromFresno,18,Mon May 4 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"Makes a lot of sense for the Brewers. He's young, smart, played in Milwaukee and has a great understanding of the advanced parts of the game. Hopefully this ends up being true."
Brewers,34sf47,sjm1541,15,Mon May 4 04:06:42 2015 UTC,I hope they still use All Along the Watchtower whenever he sets foot on the field.
Brewers,34sf47,Kkgraham3,11,Mon May 4 04:29:55 2015 UTC,"Said it in the other thread.  (more or less)  Slightly sad to see RR go, but man its great to see Craig get the job.  Im going to be super happy seeing him out there again!"
Brewers,34sf47,necropaw,13,Mon May 4 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"Probably the best case scenario for the clubhouse during a rebuild. Counsell loved Milwaukee as a player, he has experience with our FO and he's always seemed like a great guy to have in the dugout. Very encouraging and knowledgeable. Only thing that makes me hesitant is that he hasn't had any coaching experience, but I think during a time like this, it's better to have someone around like Counsell to keep morale up."
Brewers,34sf47,smiles134,8,Mon May 4 04:47:49 2015 UTC,Let him learn on the job while we rebuilt. Gotta learn somewhere and it might as well be while we aren't going to be in contention.
Brewers,34sf47,gobrewcrew,3,Mon May 4 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably for the best"
Brewers,34sf47,smiles134,9,Mon May 4 05:13:37 2015 UTC,Great!  Love this.  Now we can focus on replacing Doug Melvin in the coming weeks so our new GM has time to prep for the MLB Draft.
Brewers,34sf47,silentjay01,9,Mon May 4 04:17:09 2015 UTC,"Please, please, please, let this be the case.  Let Counsell settle into the role while we sell and rebuilt so he gets a legitimate shot, replace DM, and see where we end up. I don't need WS wins, it would just be nice to feel like the club is heading somewhere positive."
Brewers,34sf47,gobrewcrew,6,Mon May 4 04:19:06 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see how he does.  Could be a guy that is around for a long time.  Probably a good choice for a team likely entering a rebuild.
Brewers,34sf47,fly1ngorb,13,Mon May 4 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Absolutely love it if this is true
Brewers,34sf47,jwaz11,8,Mon May 4 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"It's from Rosenthal, so it most likely is true, and Tom Haudricourt says that all signs point to him being the next manager."

Brewers,34sf47,brewersfan412,6,Mon May 4 04:22:59 2015 UTC,I am so happy. Counsell was my favorite Brewer when he was playing.
Brewers,34sf47,Jesuslovesthepackers,20,Mon May 4 04:24:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome. He really seems like a guy who could be very relatable to the players and really bring this clubhouse together, which was probably one of RR's weaknesses."
Brewers,34sf47,TheSaintt,16,Mon May 4 04:06:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry this untrue. RR was adored in the club house, he was a players coach and was occasionally criticized for being too easy on the players cause of how friendly he was with them. Either way hope this move works out"
Brewers,34sf47,sorplay,6,Mon May 4 05:17:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but it partly worked against RR because he wasn't really able to light a fire under his guys when the team wasn't doing well"
Brewers,34sf47,wintva,7,Mon May 4 11:35:55 2015 UTC,"Anybody who thinks Roenicke's problem was not being able/willing to ""light a fire"" under his players is going to be really disappointed in Craig Counsell."

Brewers,34sf47,BarcaBadger,2,Mon May 4 14:20:50 2015 UTC,They can be part of a major league coaching staff or manage in the minors. He's done neither. Ultimately it doesn't matter much since the season is lost. Just wish they didn't go multiple years
Brewers,34sf47,MartyMcSuperFlyy,1 point,Mon May 4 14:41:49 2015 UTC,You gotta give him a multi year contract so he can have some authority in the club house.
Brewers,34sf47,ShakeyBobWillis,1 point,Mon May 4 15:54:59 2015 UTC,Then what better place to take a test run than a team that's already done for the season and have little to lose by giving him a shot.
Brewers,34sf47,BarcaBadger,1 point,Mon May 4 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, it ultimately doesn't matter much with a lost season. I just don't want there to potentially be multiple ex managers taking up valuable payroll"
Brewers,34sf47,skin87,0,Mon May 4 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"And if it doesn't work out they hire someone else in the offseason. They've given up on this season, so there's no better time to try something unconventional and see if it pans out."
Brewers,34sf47,BarcaBadger,3,Mon May 4 06:10:47 2015 UTC,It seems like Counsell is getting a multiple year deal. I really hope they don't have two former managers on the payroll next season.
Brewers,34sf47,emperorxyn,1 point,Mon May 4 06:34:56 2015 UTC,Mehh not sure I like a multiple year deal... Brewers taking risks right now may not be a good choice.
Brewers,34sf47,misfit_mascot,1 point,Mon May 4 07:03:17 2015 UTC,I don't take the multi-year deal to mean much if Roenecke was signed to a contract extension a couple months ago and they fired him now. If it doesn't work they will probably find someone else at the end of the season or the following season.
Brewers,34sf47,crewblue,1 point,Mon May 4 13:08:46 2015 UTC,"If Attanasio cans Melvin, they just might. New GM's usually like to hire their own guy."
Brewers,34sf47,skin87,1 point,Mon May 4 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, a three year deal. It take back what I said. I like hiring him as interim manager with 147 games to prove himself. I hate committing three years to someone with zero experience."
Brewers,34sf47,XC_Stallion92,2,Mon May 4 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"People are going to bitch and moan about a lack of experience, but it worked for the Cardinals and it's working pretty well for the Tigers as well."

Brewers,34sf47,crewblue,1 point,Mon May 4 13:13:39 2015 UTC,"Both those guys were former catchers and get a far more experienced view of the field than any other position player would. Also, the teams have more talent than the Brewers. Counsell might not be able to look good if he tried."
Brewers,34sf47,nickateen,2,Mon May 4 15:07:36 2015 UTC,I called it last night!
Brewers,34sf47,AemenLeny,2,Mon May 4 14:01:50 2015 UTC,Does the fact Counsell is getting a multi-year deal indicate Melvin is staying? I really wish they had just cleaned house after last season.
Brewers,34sf47,workthrowaway68,2,Mon May 4 15:33:33 2015 UTC,"This is a horrible move imo.  First off Roenicke didnt deserve to get fired because the performance of the team was the result of Melvin and Attanasio's poor building of the team, not Roenicke's moves.  And the Counsell hiring issue is just another one of these nepotism type moves this team LOVES to make.  Why did you hire him?  Because he's from Milwaukee?  So what.  He has zero experience as a manager and he's not going to have the respect of any player that has been a teammate of his.  And then third off, in addition to the fact that he has no experience and shouldnt have been given the job right now, if the team is in rebuild mode, anyone existing with the franchise right now should not be a part of that rebuild.  They need to tear the whole thing down from the top, starting with that bozo Rick Schlesinger, and then Melvin and his staff, and then the coaching seat.  So why bring a guy that is a part of the strategy that isnt working?"
Brewers,34sf47,OrfeoKimble,3,Mon May 4 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"Gotta get butts in seats while the team is in the shitter and going rebuild for the next few years.  Craig Counsell will likely get a lot more leeway from the fans when the club sucks for 3 years.  I don't disagree with you that they should clean house in the FO, but I don't mind having Counsell stick around as long as Doug is gone before personnel moves are made.    Also, the zero managerial experience isn't a huge issue to me, and it doesn't seem to be a huge issue around baseball anymore (Matheny, Williams, Price, etc).  I don't find the manager to be as important to a team as many other people do.  The Brewers scouting department and all of Melvin's staff need to go, therein lies the problem."
Brewers,34sf47,AemenLeny,1 point,Mon May 4 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"Why won't Counsell have the respect of players that were his teammates? All I have seen, read, and heard indicates he is nothing but respected.  As for RR, doesn't a manger create a culture of discipline, responsibility, and effort? He doesn't make moves but he is in charge of motivating, preparing, and guiding the team."
Brewers,34sf47,workthrowaway68,0,Mon May 4 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"The players are professional athletes.  If they need motivation from their manager, or help in preparing, then the team is in bigger trouble than pepole think.  He may make on field decisions, but those things dont add a ton to the performance of the overall team in the W-L column.  At best, if you have a really good manager, you probably have an edge of 2 or 3 wins a year over a team that has a bad or just average manager."
Brewers,34sf47,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,0,Mon May 4 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"See, with that manager WAR thing, it seems like you're just making it up.  Decision-making is a huuuuge part of the game and management is very important.  For example, I think RR has lost the team several games just due to pitching and bullpen management.  And if you didn't want RR fired, under what circumstances do you think it would be appropriate to fire a manager?  Since last September, this team has literally been the worst in baseball.  They just look lost out there.  They make the same mistakes over and over again.  Seriously, if this isn't good enough reason for a manager to be fired, what would be?"
Brewers,34sf47,DEUCE_SLUICE,1 point,Tue May 5 01:11:03 2015 UTC,I don't hate it. At least we don't know what he'll be like - better than a retread old-school guy we know will be no better than Ron.
Brewers,34sf47,zmichalo,1 point,Mon May 4 04:16:17 2015 UTC,Cool to see a couple of players turned coaches in charge of the milwaukee teams.
Brewers,34sf47,crewblue,1 point,Mon May 4 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"I do not think this will end well. A newly hired managers usually becomes a casualty with a rebuilding team, more often than not. I'd hate to see that happen to a hometown guy that already has a good job with the club, but he probably knew that when he accepted the position."

Brewers,34sf47,daftparagon,0,Mon May 4 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"Man... I named him as mostly a joke in one of the recent fire RR threads.   If you're one of the folks that says the manager is useless in baseball, this is the perfect hire for you. Dude may be great, but he has zero experience managing a team. Little league maybe? But he hasn't been a coach, minor league manager, etc.   If you like Counsell, this stinks because he's likely just going to be taking up space until Melvin gets the ax and the new guy cleans house.  If you just want the Brewers to win, I got no clue what this does. My only worry is the constant knock on them through the entire Melvin era (regardless of coaching) has been they're too undisciplined on offense. Maybe CC can get their respect, but you'd think a dude who has never been in that role before will not be able to force too many changes."
Brewers,34tuob,cday119,2,Mon May 4 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"It was a bit weird when Doug Melvin was talking about how managers, GMs, etc get fired in baseball all the time, and how its the business side of things."

You got the top of rotation tomorrow! Kershaw, Greinke and ... erm.. Frias. lol. Our 3rd starter isn't ready yet and our 4th is having TJ. But still, to see Greinke back in Milwaukee will be a treat.

Yuni for 2 or 3 as well.  Escobar and Cain were both every day starters on the team that went to the world series last year.  Odorizzi has a 4.13 lifetime ERA. He is 25, and even if he doesn't get any better, he'd be a perfect 4th or 5th guy in our rotation.  We gave up the next 10 years for 2 years. Segura plays all of the time, Hellweg played a little and he got shelled. Pena is rated the 29th best prospect in our farm system.  We have made some interesting trades in the past..."
Brewers,34u6so,MustBeNice,3,Mon May 4 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"Given where we were at the time, the Greinke trade has never really bothered me. I'd love to have Cain, Escobar, & Odorizzi, obviously, but having a legitimate chance at the World Series is something the Brewers hadn't had in a very long time, and Greinke gave us that.   The trades haven't helped, but the fact that our farm system is so easily depleted is absolutely ridiculous, though."
Brewers,34u6so,madman86,1 point,Mon May 4 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"Only had Greinke for 1.5 years actually, and he had statistically the worst year of his career in 2011, people are quick to forget."
Brewers,34u6so,brewcrew2_2,2,Tue May 5 03:16:04 2015 UTC,"The farm system is by far the biggest atrocity he has committed to this organization. Let's hope he can repair some of the damage with the forthcoming trades. If I were him, I'd be polishing my resume."
Brewers,34u6so,OrfeoKimble,1 point,Mon May 4 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like his offseason this year: why trade Gallardo for players that won't contribute this season.  This team was built more to win than to sell.  Also why extend Roenicke the same off-season you almost fired him?  That's at least $6 million in dead money ($4 mil for the Gallardo deal and $2+ mill for Roenicke's contract)  Other than that he's a great GM.  Look at the other trades he's made and they've been good.  Did we lose some great farm players in Brantley, Odorizzi, Cain, Escobar...yea.  But both the Sabathia and Greinke deals got this team to the playoffs.  Look at the contracts right now.  Lucroy & Gomez are some of the biggest bargains in baseball.  Does Braun's look bad? Yes but it's not Melvin's fault Braun frauded us into $100+ million.  The crappy farm system is not Melvin's fault.  It's all on Bruce Seid (rest in piece).  He hasn't produced one good first round (or second round) pick ever since he took over in 2009.  Melvin doesn't control the draft, he's got enough other stuff to deal with.  He's a really good GM who's not perfect, but he's our GM for the future and the best option."
Brewers,34u6so,CJL13,1 point,Tue May 5 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"Don't forget:   On July 28, 2006, the Brewers sent Nelson Cruz and outfielder Carlos Lee to the Texas Rangers in exchange for Laynce Nix, Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero and minor league pitcher Julian Cordero.   A 26 year old Cruz...and all we get in return is the Rangers garbage. Just a couple years later, 2009, Cruz was an All-Star in Texas.  I can't forgive him for this one. You have to get something in return for  Nelly. Not Kevin Mench."
Brewers,34u6so,SonnyLove,1 point,Wed May 6 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Melvin should have gotten the axe in the fall of 2012. Yet here we are, and he will somehow get an extension."

Still seems odd they fired RR now, but yeah.  I'd still love for Ron to be around.  I like the guy.  Its cool though that Craig is around.  Edit: Beer.  Manager, not manger."
Brewers,34sf3j,necropaw,3,Mon May 4 04:06:36 2015 UTC,"Please let this be true. Give him a few years at least to get a handle on the job, give him a decent roster in a couple years to work with, see what happens."

The game he got it I was just too sick. Delirious. Barely knew where I was etc.  I gave the ticket to a friend and my dad took him instead. I laid on my living room floor, wrapped in blankets, wishing I was dead, and watching it on TV. I want to say I watched it on ESPN for some reason, like it wasn't on local TV? I don't remember, I was out of it. Damn I'm mad about that game.   I did see Nolan Ryan's 300th win at county stadium, so that was cool."

Brewers,34q990,cheddarhead,3,Mon May 4 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this era is when I really started to get more into Brewers baseball. We definitely had some memorable guys even if we were terrible.    Jeromy Burnitz: swung for the fences almost every time he stepped in the box. Averaged over 30 HRs and 130 Ks in 5 seasons.  José Hernández: Speaking of Ks... in 2002, Hernandez struck out 188 times, one shy of then MLB record (a record held today by a guy name Mark Reynolds). He was held out of the line-up during the last few games of the season to prevent that from happening. Despite all that he managed to hit .288 AND was the team's All Star that year! Jeff Cirillo: Amazing player, when I looked him up turns out he was even better than I remember. Posted 4.5, 5.3, 5.9 and 4.8 WAR from '96 to '99. Which is actually better than Prince Fielder's best 4 years with the Brewers! Scott Podsednik: Really fun player to watch, was the CF in '03 and '04. Stole 70 bases in '04. Sadly we shipped him over to the White Sox for Carlos Lee.  Jeff D'Amico: Pitcher that we drafted in the first round. Showed a lot of promise when he was healthy including 12 wins and a 2.66 ERA in 2000. Sadly injuries and being traded to the Pirates ended his career."

Brewers,34q990,madman86,1 point,Mon May 4 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"3 more recent memories for me. First was when Yo pinch-hit last year in the 10th and drove the ball off the top of the wall to win the game. I almost died of laughter at how absurd it was that our ace pitcher was pinch hitting, and that he almost hit a home run to boot. Opening Day at Miller Park was my second favorite memory in recent times. The first? When they made the playoffs. I was at the game and about half the stadium stayed to watch the end of the Cardinals game. Never have I seen so many Brewers fans rooting for the Cubs to win. But that night was different. The ensuing celebration was something I will never forget."

Brewers,34qp0i,iwantafunnyname,3,Sun May 3 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the wiki on waiver claims, as well as other types of transactions"
Brewers,34qp0i,autowikibot,2,Sun May 3 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Waivers of article  Major League Baseball transactions:       Any player under contract may be placed on waivers (""waived"") at any time. After MLB's July 31 trade deadline and through to the end of the season, a team must place a player on waivers if that player is to be traded.  If a player is waived, any team may claim him. If more than one team claims the player from waivers, the team with the weakest record in the player's league gets preference. If no team in the player's league claims him, the claiming team with the weakest record in the other league gets preference. In the first month of the season, preference is determined using the previous year's standings.  If a team claims a player off waivers and has a viable claim as described above, his current team (the ""waiving team"") may choose one of the following options:   arrange a trade with the claiming team for that player within two business days of the claim; or rescind the request and keep the player on its major league roster, effectively canceling the waiver; or do nothing and allow the claiming team to assume the player's existing contract, pay the waiving team a waiver fee, and place the player on its active major league roster.   If a player is claimed and the waiving team exercises its rescission option, the waiving team may not use the option again for that player in that season—a subsequent waiver would be irrevocable with a claiming team getting the player essentially for nothing.  If no team claims a player off waivers after three business days, the player has cleared waivers and may be assigned to a minor league team, traded (to any team), or released outright.  The waiver ""wire"" is a secret within the personnel of the Major League Baseball clubs; no official announcement of a waiver is made until a transaction actually occurs, although information sometimes leaks out.   Players are often waived during the post-July ""waiver-required"" trading period for teams to gauge trade interest in a particular player.  Usually, when the player is claimed, the waiving team will rescind the waiver to avoid losing the player unless a trade can be worked out with the claiming team.  The National League (NL) was the first of the two major leagues to adopt the trade deadline rule in 1917. Originally it was enforced after June 15, but was later changed as the result of a new collective bargaining agreement.  For many years, players could not be traded from one league to another without being waived by all of the teams in the trading team's league. Then an inter-league trading period was established, centered on the winter baseball meetings in December. Later, there were two ""inter-league"" trading periods each year, one from after the World Series until mid-December and the second from a week before spring training began until March 15. So intent were leagues on keeping their stars from being moved from one league to the other, that then-National League President Warren Giles threatened to keep NL clubs from trading major stars to the American League after the deal that sent Frank Robinson from Cincinnati to Baltimore.

Brewers,34ns99,necropaw,7,Sat May 2 21:29:53 2015 UTC,Now that's a lot of Ks. Everyone who batted for the Cubs struck out at least once.

Brewers,34ns99,JasonYaya,7,Sat May 2 21:41:28 2015 UTC,Who let this guy in???
Brewers,34ns99,dutchoven21,5,Sun May 3 06:10:24 2015 UTC,"Did I just hear Craig Coshun (sp?) correctly there? Fiers has a career 0.90 ERA against the Cubbies at Wrigley covering 20+ innings..?  EDIT: I just looked into it. Including one inning of relief work as a Sept call-up in 2011, he's had three starts @CHC covering 20.1 innings, with just 2 runs earned and 32 strikeouts (with 14 in one game last year as /u/dutchoven21 pointed out).  So @CHC he has an ERA of 0.89 = [9 × (2 ER ÷ 20.333 IP)] and a K/9 of just over 14; 14.16 = [9 × (32 SO ÷ 20.333 IP)]"
Brewers,34ns99,riverwestein,3,Sat May 2 21:33:20 2015 UTC,I was watching the Cubs feed. They said that only he and Sandy Koufax had struck out that many Cubs in back to back games.
Brewers,34ns99,jubjub2184,3,Sat May 2 23:10:16 2015 UTC,Sounds about right. His last start at Wrigley last season Fiers had something like 14 Ks.
Brewers,34ns99,madman86,3,Sat May 2 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"I've like Fiers a lot and have been waiting to see him return to good form since he proved to be fantasy free-agent gold for me from mid-June to early-August of 2012.   During that span (6/16 - 8/07) he gave up just 7 earned runs across 9 starts and one relief appearance, racking up 63 K/14 BB, finishing the stretch with 1 run earned across 8 innings. It all came crumbling down after that though, when he allowed 8 earned runs in 2 IP. That start included, he finished the last 10 games of 2012 giving up 37 ER. That being said, one of those final 10 games came at Wrigley where he hurled 6 innings of one-run ball, one of just two 1 ER starts in that abysmal final stretch (the other one coming @STL of all places).  I'd love to see today's start mark the beginning of another streak of solid pitching from him, but this probably isn't the season to do it."
Brewers,34ns99,benclem,5,Sat May 2 22:38:11 2015 UTC,These past couple days we've actually looked like a major league level team

The one where Rizzo lost the ball? It seemed like he was high or something. He dropped it, nonchalantly picked it up, realized there was still a play, and then chucked it inaccurately to third. I don't remember who our guy was, but it was a weird play."

Brewers,34l07e,BarcaBadger,7,Sat May 2 02:03:55 2015 UTC,Not surprising at all. This team needs to enter rebuilding mode immediately. Even if they somehow manage to have a decent rest of the season they are simply already too far out of the playoff race.
Brewers,34l07e,vv238,6,Sat May 2 02:34:21 2015 UTC,I hope Ramirez goes to a good contending team.
Brewers,34l07e,ColumbianCameltoe,1 point,Sat May 2 12:24:33 2015 UTC,I hope he doesn't get stuck as a DH (he has said he hates the DH role anyway so maybe he would retire instead).
Brewers,34l07e,k4melot,1 point,Sat May 2 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"Same.. makes me think of Adam Dunn and how his only playoff appearance in his long career was a wild card loss last season. I'd really like to see Ramirez retire with a ring, or at least a world series appearance."
Brewers,34l07e,SolidRambo,3,Sun May 3 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it would be a good move to try to get some value for them now, none of them are going to be around the next time the Brewers are relevant anyway.  We should probably try to trade Gomez as well, he doesn't have long left on his contract and you know with Boras as his agent there is no way the Brewers are going to pay his next contract, but they could get some real top prospects for him.  As a fan it is very disappointing to see them giving up this early in the season, but it is the smart thing to do, there is no chance of playoffs this season, and probably not next season, so why not plan for the future while you still can?"
Brewers,34l07e,atomiczap,3,Sat May 2 02:40:00 2015 UTC,Can we get anything for braun?

Brewers,34l07e,crewblue,1 point,Sat May 2 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"My guess, which as you'll see is based on totally irrelevant evidence, would be that it's because we just picked him up this past offseason.

Brewers,34be04,CJL13,3,Wed Apr 29 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, on a positive, we're only 10 games back from the lead right now."
Brewers,34bfze,fly1ngorb,6,Wed Apr 29 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Braun is starting to heat up. A good sign. Now lets get back to full strength and maybe, just maybe, we can turn this thing around."
Brewers,34bfze,madman86,9,Wed Apr 29 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"2 in a week, huh? This team has reached a new high."
Brewers,34bfze,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 29 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"This is the level of play that this team is capable of. Granted they faced a rookie, but they took advantage of it. That's what I like to see!"
Brewers,34bfze,MurDoct,12,Wed Apr 29 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get down voted for saying this, but I hope the Brewers don't go on a decent winning streak. Now before you hit that downvote button, just hear me out. DM has not shown that he can bring this team to prominence, and like it or not we will need to rebuild going forward. We are going to lose Loshe and Aram after this year, and either Lucroy or Gomez to free agency (potentially both). The Brewers have 0 talent in the farm system that are MLB ready, so we will be unable to replenish our losses. I'm afraid that if IF we rattle off a nice winning streak, the front office will be unwilling to sell off our talent. It's going nearly impossible to make the playoffs this year, so why not sell while we can still get a nice haul. I don't want to end up like the Phillies with a long long road ahead before they will become relevant again.   TL;DR: Winning streak might mean no rebuild. We loss talent in the future and become the Phillies 😢"
Brewers,34bfze,Babou_Ocelot,4,Wed Apr 29 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, however we'll also get more for our players on a trade if they're actually playing well. It's a fine line to walk"
Brewers,34bfze,zimmej,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"Great point and I agree entirely. Especially with ARam, garza and loshe as they will be harder to move than Gomez or parra"
Brewers,34bfze,Babou_Ocelot,3,Wed Apr 29 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"You are probably correct, and it pains me to say that.  The blind optimist in me says we're not done yet, and I will not root against this team.  I hate to think we're going back to the early 2000s of awful baseball that I wasn't really old enough to remember.  As a certain other team in Milwaukee once showed us, having a win-now attitude and applying short-term fixes for over a decade doesn't work.  It results in consistent mediocrity.  It bores the fanbase.    You have to be willing to move on.  Such is life in a small market."
Brewers,34bfze,sniper84,2,Thu Apr 30 01:54:48 2015 UTC,It makes me incredibly sad to see that we could potentially lose Luc and/or GoGo.
Brewers,34bfze,MasterCashier,2,Thu Apr 30 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"I was already talking about this in the game chat so no worries. I want them to not do well so we rebuild. I agree with you and know that if we go on a tear and somehow get back into contention DM and MA are just going to try and ""win now"".   I'd rather see them be bad/meh for a few years and then come back and be contenders for a few years with fresh talent. That's how it has to be done for a small market team."
Brewers,34bfze,Babou_Ocelot,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"Well said, the A's have been masters at shedding players if they aren't in contention in exchange for talented prospects"
Brewers,34bfze,BeHereNow91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"If they had started off the year hitting like they did today (to their potential), maybe we'd be looking at it differently.  But they've dug a hole too deep to compete in the Central this season, and it's really time to start moving some pieces around.  Hopefully Braun keeps this up and becomes a valuable trade piece."
Brewers,34bfze,adam7765,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"Good point, but I don't think Braun's going anywhere. They will try, but no one will take his contract. However, IMO, Braun and Lucroy should stay with the rest of the youngster's if the shitslide continues. Lohse, Garza, Broxton, Gomez, Lind, K-Rod, and Parra (maybe) should all go if we continue our woes."
Brewers,34bfze,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:51:46 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I think this was a good thing in disguise really. It was able to snap us out of the dream that maybe this team could contend.
Brewers,34bfze,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:33:21 2015 UTC,Lucroy doesn't hit free agency until after the 2017 season. Why is everyone talking like he's gone after this year?.
Brewers,34bfze,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"We just need to pull a Bucks and shed our talent even if we do show signs of being competitive.  I think the only every-day guy we absolutely should keep is Lucroy.  There are others that we certainly should hold on to, but I think he's the type of player you build a team around."
Brewers,34bfze,Babou_Ocelot,2,Wed Apr 29 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"If we do hold onto Luc, I'd like to see him moved to 1B to protect him and prolong his career as well as increase playing time."
Brewers,34bfze,gobrewcrew,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"As much as I adore Luc and think that he is the sort of guy you can build a franchise around, I think that we've let the current state of affairs go on too long for that to work out.  If we'd started rebuilding a couple years ago, we'd be in a position to have Luc be the keystone of a legitimately competitive club.   As it is, we have yet to start our rebuilding process (if we ever do...) and by the time we're actually competitive again, Luc will be too old/too expensive for us to keep around.  So as much as it pains me to say it, he should probably be just as available for potential trades as anyone else :\"
Brewers,34bfze,jn2010,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:14:10 2015 UTC,5 wins in the first month and you're talking about a win streak?
Brewers,34bfze,Babou_Ocelot,2,Wed Apr 29 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of folks are talking about the crew potentially turning it around in the game thread, so I decided to give my opinion."
Brewers,34bfze,jn2010,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:31:05 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
Brewers,34bfze,gobrewcrew,0,Wed Apr 29 23:19:00 2015 UTC,"No downvotes from me. That's one of the things that I like least about this FO. All it would take is a decent run towards the All Star break for them to put any thoughts of a fire sale aside and look into how we can, once again, mortgage the future in a vain attempt at contending now.   We need to rake in all the prospects we can for the talent we have now and start a serious rebuild. And I don't think we're going to have any sort of success at that sort of venture until we make some major changes in both the FO and our talent evaluation/minor league management."
Brewers,34bfze,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"Unless they're leading the division at the break, Gomez and Lohse are probably traded for prospects. We saw it with the Grienke trade."
Brewers,34bfze,MasterCashier,5,Thu Apr 30 16:22:08 2015 UTC,3-4 in their last 7. We are getting closer to maybe having a winning record for a week. It might take us a while but we will get there!
Brewers,34bfze,Bullwine85,4,Wed Apr 29 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"If we win the next game, that's called a winning streak. Progress!"

Brewers,34bfze,meltedlaundry,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"In games that you can't tie in, if you don't lose several in row, it's called a winning streak. At least I think that's what it is."

Brewers,34bfze,gobrewcrew,2,Wed Apr 29 21:45:52 2015 UTC,I'm gonna get blasted for this ...  They beat up on a rookie pitcher. I'll find faith once they start bringing it against top shelf pitchers.

Brewers,34c8to,ShecksMix,12,Thu Apr 30 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Lucroy will ever be traded, if only for that he is now the most marketable face of the Brewers due to Braun being a dipshit.  PR and marketing go a long way in putting butts in seats and eyes on the screen when the team isn't winning."
Brewers,34c8to,Necatorducis,2,Thu Apr 30 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"Hard to say right now.  I could see Lucroy going if Moldonado proves he can be a worth fill in.  I could also see Braun going if anyone wants to pick up his contract, but only if we get some ace pitching for him.  I have a hard time imagining any team would want Garza or Ramirez, but I could see Lohse going to a team who needs rotation depth and is on the bubble for making a wild card or divisional run."
Brewers,34c8to,P-Munny,2,Thu Apr 30 17:47:52 2015 UTC,why wouldn't teams want Garza? he's an above average pitcher who can be lights out when he's on.   and lots of teams would love to have Ramirez for a playoff run. especially in the AL where he could DH.
Brewers,34c8to,sdogg,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:22:39 2015 UTC,I personally would like Segura moved over to third and bring up Sardinas.
Brewers,34c8to,The_Bostache,2,Thu Apr 30 01:28:17 2015 UTC,Even knowing he is a few years away I would rather wait for Arcia at SS. I don't think Sardinas is all that.
Brewers,34c8to,MasterCashier,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:12:03 2015 UTC,Lind is almost definitely gone. I wonder how much he is worth. And Braun is a tough move but I'd love to see it. As well as krod and broxton
Brewers,34c8to,adam7765,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Segura ain't going anywhere, bud."
Brewers,34c8to,EthyleneGlycol,6,Thu Apr 30 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'd argue Segura is one of the most likely to be traded.  He's  young, cheap, and appears to be returning to be a productive hitter.  Helps that he plays above average defense at a premium position.  That's what makes him such a great trade asset.  Plus with Sardinas and Arcia in the minors he's pretty expendable."
Brewers,34c8to,Nadie_AZ,5,Thu Apr 30 03:55:49 2015 UTC,Ah the heady days after we shipped off the last young up and coming promising SS. It would have been nice to have JJ at SS during our '11 run. Or Alcides Escobar. Instead we had Betancourt. Let's not do that again.
Brewers,34c8to,theamazingkiwi,4,Thu Apr 30 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think it is safe to assume we won't be competitive until 2018 at the earliest in this case, so I would hope we could find a better ss than segura by then"

Brewers,34c8to,silentjay01,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Segura is probably one of our best trading pieces."
Brewers,34c8to,smiles134,1 point,Fri May 1 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"I am not knowledgeable enough for this line of questioning.  All I do know is that if we start trading, we NEED to get a highly rated AAA prospect at first base.  Our farm system needs an injection of talent and nowhere do I feel it is more obvious than at 1st base."
Brewers,34c8to,cheezturds,3,Thu Apr 30 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"How about a highly rated AA prospect? We need young guys who are all going to come up around the same time, like what the Cubs have done."
Brewers,34c8to,EthyleneGlycol,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:35:59 2015 UTC,Cubs hired a competent GM first. That's what the Brewers need to do. MA seems to love Melvin way too much though.
Brewers,34c8to,BrewCrewKevin,0,Thu Apr 30 22:42:05 2015 UTC,The only players I don't see going anywhere for sure are Peralta and Nelson.  It's hard enough to find pitching and they're both young and have the potential to be pretty good.  I think everyone else is on the block.
Brewers,34c8to,30rec,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"And they aren't even arbitration eligible yet, so they are dirt cheap. They won't go anywhere.  I could see Gomez leaving, that's probably the biggest name. Lohse and Garza. Maybe Ramirez just before the trade deadline, but not yet, since this is his last year before retirement."
Brewers,34c8to,crewblue,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  They probably won't be looking to get rid of any other cheap players either, but theoretically anyone else could get lumped into a package deal."

Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:52:16 2015 UTC,RR isn't taking any chances.  I think he took Garza out one batter too early.
Brewers,349w3l,CJL13,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:48:38 2015 UTC,If anyone other than Votto was pinch hitting I might agree.
Brewers,349w3l,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:54:37 2015 UTC,apparently the Orioles like an empty stadium.  Already up 6-0 in the 2nd lol
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,0,Wed Apr 29 18:42:25 2015 UTC,If I were a manager and the other team hit a home run I'd call fan interference to make the umpires talk to the guy in New York watching the game for literally no reason.
Brewers,349w3l,jn2010,2,Wed Apr 29 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"They got all six of those runs between the first and second out of the first inning, too"
Brewers,349w3l,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i saw that.    Its still weird to think about playing in a truly empty stadium."
Brewers,349w3l,jn2010,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:51:06 2015 UTC,It's the free game on mlb.tv.  I tuned in for a minute and it's eerie to watch.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:00:35 2015 UTC,How many home runs have there been in the last two games?
Brewers,349w3l,dutchoven21,4,Wed Apr 29 18:28:58 2015 UTC,I don't know why I expected a timely hit.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 29 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, Garza's only at 70 pitches.  With any luck he could go 7 and get like...seemingly the first quality start of the season."
Brewers,349w3l,dutchoven21,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:15:53 2015 UTC,Guess you were asleep when they had 4 straight quality starts last week.

Brewers,349w3l,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:07:32 2015 UTC,ok well the braun grand salami was the one we were waiting for !
Brewers,349w3l,PathofTotality,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:12:08 2015 UTC,Braun knew that was gone immediately.
Brewers,349w3l,P-Munny,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:53:30 2015 UTC,Wow Braun two days in a row?
Brewers,349w3l,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:53:05 2015 UTC,Wow I get back from lunch right as there's another homerun.
Brewers,349w3l,berjiff,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:52:57 2015 UTC,Hey does anyone know how I can stream the radio broadcast for this game?  I tried WTMJ's website but they don't have the rights to stream it online.  I'd tune in with a radio but I live in Minneapolis :(
Brewers,349w3l,P-Munny,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"I'm using Tunein app on my phone and streaming the signal from WISS ""Big Red 1100"" from Madison.  Free."

Brewers,349w3l,silentjay01,5,Wed Apr 29 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of trouble finding stations that streamed it for the same reason a couple years back.  FWIW, the MLB.com audio package is only 20 bucks per year.  I buy it every year just so i can listen on my phone or whatever if nothing else.  Also great for when im at work (like right now)"
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 29 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that option too.  Fuck it, I'm taking the plunge, just like the Crew are taking the plunge into the record books (for bad reasons).  Oh well, I just have to hear Bob's voice."
Brewers,349w3l,KEM10,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:54:06 2015 UTC,Segura has never had a hit with the bases loaded?
Brewers,349w3l,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:42:04 2015 UTC,Joe just said it was a mistake and he had one monday night.
Brewers,349w3l,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"They just corrected it.  This is his second bases loaded hit in his career, his first was Monday."
Brewers,349w3l,silentjay01,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:45:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that surprised me as well. Didn't expect that coming from Segura especially with how good he was his first half year.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:43:24 2015 UTC,Now 0-13 in his career.
Brewers,349w3l,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:42:35 2015 UTC,Never mind.  Radio guy who isn't Uke got it wrong.  Jean got a single on Monday in the 9th with bases juiced.

Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:39:49 2015 UTC,Put another guy on the DL.
Brewers,349w3l,cyan101,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"I know Rami isn't that fast, but you have to send him with the pitcher coming up, don't you?"

Brewers,349w3l,PathofTotality,2,Wed Apr 29 17:22:48 2015 UTC,Because reasons. i don't have anything better than that.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:25:59 2015 UTC,Anybody have a reliable stream? the strikeout.co one isn't going great...
Brewers,349w3l,luvdmb36,6,Wed Apr 29 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"Alright Brewers, I'm going to lunch, if you don't screw up by the time I get back, I promise I won't switch to the Orioles game."
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:08:42 2015 UTC,I wish i could watch that game.  Might listen to it after the Brewers game is over though...

Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 29 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"Im at work, and even if it wouldnt be an issue to watch, we have terrible internet here because its so far out in the boonies."
Brewers,349w3l,jn2010,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:26:43 2015 UTC,Well that's no fun. At least you have the Crew!
Brewers,349w3l,Harrason,2,Wed Apr 29 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"Well, cleared the order once through in 2 innings, opposing pitcher is almost at 50 pitches so far...  Now if Garza can just not suck, that'd be great."
Brewers,349w3l,berjiff,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Good job, Gomez.  Cleared the pitcher spot at least."
Brewers,349w3l,SolidRambo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:06:36 2015 UTC,Is it already time for the Derby in July?   P.S Great job so far Brewers.

Brewers,349w3l,MasterCashier,2,Wed Apr 29 17:03:32 2015 UTC,Wow we hit two home runs in one game let alone one inning? I don't know what to think.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 29 17:03:19 2015 UTC,I don't know what to think.   Ill give you a hint
Brewers,349w3l,MasterCashier,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"I really hope you are right. I really do. I want this team to turn it around, but a the same time I don't. I want them to rebuild but if they do well the team will think they have another chance to win and not do that."
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i know what you mean.  Im afraid if they do turn things around the management wont look seriously at rebuilding, and thats going to mean a lot more years of 'eh'."
Brewers,349w3l,jubjub2184,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:08:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm tired of 'eh'. I want 3-4 years of suck to have a few years of awesome and contention.

Brewers,349w3l,ESMrMilo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:22:11 2015 UTC,I had a dream last night that Cueto threw a no hitter against us.  Woke up and was sad until i realized we didnt even get shut out.
Brewers,349w3l,necropaw,3,Wed Apr 29 16:23:08 2015 UTC,Schafer at the 2 spot again...
Brewers,34al62,jmeks23,2,Wed Apr 29 16:51:52 2015 UTC,2011 sure was a great year
Brewers,34a04k,quickstop_rstvideo,9,Wed Apr 29 14:10:22 2015 UTC,R.R. gets canned on May 28th (Off Day).  D.M. gets shown the Door on June 11th.  The first trade of a Player does not happen until June 20th.
Brewers,34a04k,silentjay01,2,Wed Apr 29 16:05:41 2015 UTC,I like this call. Would firing RR make a big difference in wins/losses this year? Probably not. But I would enjoy games and post game press conferences a lot better if I didn't have to see and hear from Eeyore the Manager.
Brewers,34a04k,AemenLeny,6,Wed Apr 29 18:25:23 2015 UTC,today
Brewers,34a04k,hgxarcher,3,Mon May 4 02:30:49 2015 UTC,RR probably doesn't get fired until the off-season.  Trades will start happening at the end of May if things don't make a turn.
Brewers,34a04k,madman86,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:54:16 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you there.  If this team makes mid May and only has 8 wins?  You have to can him or the ballpark will look like the Orioles - White Sox game today by the end of the season.
Brewers,34a04k,IrkenInvaderGir,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think Ron or Doug go anywhere until the season is over.  Unless they go 60-20 in the second half of the season I think they'll blow everything up at the end of the year and start fresh."
Brewers,34a04k,EthyleneGlycol,2,Wed Apr 29 17:02:37 2015 UTC,They need to start the rebuild around the trade deadline and there's no use keeping a GM who refuses to change direction.
Brewers,34a04k,DamienSalvation,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:49:55 2015 UTC,You'd have to get rid of him before the trade deadline realistically. Well before it. Otherwise he is the one who orchestrates all the deals.
Brewers,34a04k,madman86,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"They'll ride Ron the rest of the year since the playoffs are out of the picture.  No sense on wasting money at this point.  If they do get rid of him, they'll just have the bench coach act as the interm manager.  Doug is a harder choice.  You want someone as the trade deadline comes up, but I'm not sure you can just plug a person into that sort of role and have any real impact on trade values.  It would be like having someone substitute in the middle of a game of chess."
Brewers,34a04k,Pagoon,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:29:45 2015 UTC,I think he's gone on the 14th and the trades start happening right after that
Brewers,34a04k,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"If they get rid of Ron, that might start heating up if we get badly swept by a divisional opponent @ Miller Park. We have a nice 3 series home stand coming up, lets see how the Brewers play. May 14th has been mentioned and thats the first day off after those series."

Brewers,347sad,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:16:44 2015 UTC,Gomez is still under contract for 2016. His trade value is highest at the trade deadline for this season.
Brewers,347sad,crewblue,15,Wed Apr 29 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"Even if they are a playoff team this year, a rebuild is inevitable.  Ramirez and Lohse are gone after this year, likely can't afford to keep Lucroy and Gomez together if they pull anything close to last years performance again, zero top prospects waiting to come up, Braun's salary goes to 20M next year, iffy as to whether or not we'll see the 2013 Sequra again, Fiers can't be consistent for an entire season, for some godawful reason we are paying 9M a year for Broxton (useful if a contender, just a waste otherwise), etc etc etc.  As an additional benefit, if we sell the team we can pretty much guarantee number 1 pick next year.    Losing sucks, but I'm fine with rebuilding and selling so long as they at least find new and creative ways to fuck up on the base paths to keep me entertained."
Brewers,347sad,Necatorducis,-1,Wed Apr 29 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"Why is it we sign guys around 5-10 years after the last season they've been worth it? (Broxton, Lohse, Garza, Gagne, K-Rod to name a few) Just seems like massive waste of contract money that could go to more useful players around the league. I feel like this should be the team's logo."
Brewers,347sad,cheezturds,2,Wed Apr 29 00:31:54 2015 UTC,Milwaukee is a second tier landing spot. Free agents like to sign with more attractive locations.
Brewers,347sad,bootybooty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Lohse had been solid for two seasons. Only now has he begun to suck, but honestly so has the entire team"
Brewers,347sad,mattwise15,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:15:28 2015 UTC,Im really starting to wonder how much of it is the coaching.  a lot of our guys seem to be steadily regressing after some time in the majors.
Brewers,347sad,necropaw,3,Wed Apr 29 10:54:49 2015 UTC,We need to sell to restock the farm like any other team. I feel like we need to get a new GM as well. Melvin had his shot 2002-2015 is a great run but during a restock is a perfect time to implement a new direction.
Brewers,347sad,orogeny,2,Wed Apr 29 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"I think we all knew this was coming eventually. I just don't think any of us saw it happening now. Not saying it's inherently bad, but trading prospects en masse like we've been doing the past 6 years isn't sustainable for a small market team.   Doesn't help that we've drafted absolutely horrifically since Jack Z left for Seattle."
Brewers,347sad,miamiflashfan,6,Wed Apr 29 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"Your ""good crew of guys"" is old, and overrated.  Lohse and Garza are on the wrong side of 30 and showing their age.  Ramirez has already checked out, Braun looks like he needs PED's again, and the two best players on the team are on the DL.  At this point in the season its too late to even dream of a comeback and contention.  They have to win 13 in a row just to get to .500 and then go 71 and 57 the rest of the way to have a chance.  Taking out the incredible 13 game winning streak, that 71 and 57 mark would be better than this team has played since 2011.  This rebuild is long overdue. It comes as the result of short sighted ill conceived free agent signings, bad drafting and horrible player development."
Brewers,347sad,workthrowaway68,2,Wed Apr 29 02:02:55 2015 UTC,The reason to do a major rebuild is because we have no minor league talent

Brewers,347sad,Docter_Bogs,2,Wed Apr 29 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"They would have to get a haul to trade this early. Otherwise Doug waits for the trade deadline for teams to bid against each other. Realistically, no one gets traded until mid-June (similar to the  Sabathia trade)."
Brewers,347sad,unmisunderestimated,3,Wed Apr 29 13:59:58 2015 UTC,Too bad Lohse has shit the bed thus far.  He has an unattractive contract.
Brewers,347sad,BeHereNow91,4,Wed Apr 29 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"He's a free agent at the end of the season. It's not that unattractive for a team that sees themselves as a back-of-the-rotation arm away from really competing, or a team that just had a starter go down for the season."
Brewers,347sad,JinxUW,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"If he turns it around a little, he'd be easily movable for something, but I wouldn't expect much coming back."
Brewers,347sad,burts_beads,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:35:40 2015 UTC,We could pay a portion of his contract in a deal.  Money isn't the problem for the front office.  Getting a good prospect or two while eating half of his salary is still a pretty good deal in my opinion.

Brewers,347bhm,buttplugpeddler,4,Tue Apr 28 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Your username already covered that.
Brewers,3485hv,BeHereNow91,5,Wed Apr 29 01:39:55 2015 UTC,Whoever's young and continues to produce. Maybe add Scoot scoot and Nelson to that list.
Brewers,3485hv,Kung_Fu_Owl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"Nelson was another guy who came to mind, but not someone you really build a team around.  He still has a lot to prove.  Scooter is definitely a solid keeper, though."
Brewers,3485hv,CM816,3,Wed Apr 29 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"Scooter still has a lot to prove too.  As of right now he's a platoon 2B-only bat w/average defense.  Good player to have around, but definitely not a centerpiece."
Brewers,3485hv,P-Munny,3,Wed Apr 29 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'd probably keep Scooter, Lucroy, Peralta, Nelson.  I think we might be able to dump off Lohse and K-Rod to a team in the hunt for some prospects.  I'd say keep an eye on Fiers.. not sure about him yet.  As much as I hate to say it, I think we have to trade Braun for some pitching."
Brewers,3485hv,ToneBone36,2,Wed Apr 29 04:42:05 2015 UTC,I would add Nelson and Braun to this list.
Brewers,3485hv,ToneBone36,0,Wed Apr 29 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"I would only consider Braun safe because of his contract.  If he starts to hit like an MVP again, I think we may look to move him."
Brewers,3485hv,ZappedZa,3,Wed Apr 29 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"Seeing as though he's locked in until 2020, wouldn't you want to keep him if he's hitting like an MVP? Let's say by mid-next season he begins to look great again....That gives us 3.5 years of a great baseball player in his prime! We don't necessarily ""build"" around Braun, but he can certainly be a big piece."
Brewers,3485hv,ToneBone36,2,Wed Apr 29 11:17:01 2015 UTC,Expecting Braun to hit like an MVP a year or a year and a half from now is just not realistic. If we can find a team to take on his contract he's gone.
Brewers,3485hv,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  If he shows any signs of living up to even half of the value of his contract, ship him out.  I think there's an elephant in the room regarding Braun, in that his performance is down and his injuries are up after his suspension.    If we were paying him 50% less per year, he'd be a solid piece to rebuild around, but it's just too much to pay for a struggling player and the PR nightmare that he was and is."
Brewers,3485hv,MustBeNice,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is going to be finding a team that's willing to take on his huge contract and problems. I don't think he gets traded away unless we eat a lot of his contract (just like Josh Hamilton). So knowing this, I think he is still a good ball player and is still young enough to ""build"" this team around. No, he isn't worth his current contract, but if he can put his head on straight and be the solid ball player we all know he can be, he will still be an asset to this team both now and later."
Brewers,3485hv,sjm1541,2,Wed Apr 29 15:47:12 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go a bit bold here and say Clint Coulter and Orlando Arcia. I have been impressed by their production so far in the minors.
Brewers,3485hv,MustBeNice,2,Wed Apr 29 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"Segura? He's averaging about an error every 3 games. Absolutely killing them defensively, & they have some depth there in the minor leagues. He's tradable for sure. M"
Brewers,3485hv,zayde199,3,Wed Apr 29 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"Segura has been above average defender the past two seasons. You don't trade a guy because he's made a few mistakes in the field after 20 games. There are other reasons to trade him, but defense isn't one."
Brewers,3485hv,crewblue,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"Above average is a stretch. He usually rates somewhere in the middle in terms of pure defense. & offensively he's nothing special either, very little power and terrible discipline, refuses to take a walk.  He's not a great player. If they can get anything for him, strike while the iron is hot not completely cold."
Brewers,3485hv,workthrowaway68,2,Wed Apr 29 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"True.  Second-to-worst fielding percentage among shortstops, although he was middle of the pack last season.  Always thought he would be a solid defender with a mediocre bat.  At least he brought the bat this season."

Brewers,347wfo,itsnewbsdelight,15,Wed Apr 29 00:26:37 2015 UTC,No.  Milwaukee have to play at a clip greater than the current roster ever has to break even on the season.  It's simple math. It's over.
Brewers,347wfo,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Wed Apr 29 00:28:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. Now it's just time to watch the train wreck.
Brewers,347wfo,buttplugpeddler,0,Wed Apr 29 01:11:37 2015 UTC,This team has proven they can be 13 games over .500. It's just a matter of sustaining it.
Brewers,347wfo,adam7765,3,Wed Apr 29 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"Being 13 games over .500 would make them a .500 team right now, they have to play at about a 27 games over .500 stretch for the rest of the season."
Brewers,347wfo,workthrowaway68,3,Wed Apr 29 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"The weather will get better, and the tailgates will improve, because no matter how bad the Brewers get (i was around for the mid 80s crap fest) the tailgates make a bad game good."
Brewers,347wfo,mechadrum,2,Wed Apr 29 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"I am, but I'm just really sad to watch this happen. I've been watching the team since 2007 and haven't really experienced losing ways. I have yet to suffer from it. But hey, if they get on a win streak, and get to ten wins before 20 losses, that'd be a start. 139 games left."
Brewers,347wfo,adam7765,2,Wed Apr 29 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"No.  I was explaining this to a friend a few days ago.  I like baseball, but I don't love it.  Mostly because shit like this makes it damn near impossible.  I'm not saying the Brewers need to win the World Series every year, but to see them just shit the bed this hard and this early in the season is draining.  Baseball is a LONG season, and they're already done.    I get google alerts when the score of the game goes final.  Today I looked at the score, shrugged and put my phone back in my pocket.  What else is new?  There's a reason the Packers subreddit is still busy this far into the offseason.  There's actually several reasons, but they're all obvious.    Vented a bit there, but you get the point."
Brewers,347wfo,jim732,2,Wed Apr 29 03:29:10 2015 UTC,"I like baseball, but I don't love it.   Ive actually only been into baseball for 4-5 years now, but im the exact opposite.  The way i usually put it is:  I love the Packers more than the Brewers, but i like baseball more than football.  I watch other teams play baseball just because i enjoy the game.  Sure the Brewers suck, but oh well.  Its still fun to watch.  Plus at this point ive accepted the horror and im just kinda having fun seeing just how bad it can get."

According to FanGraphs they have a 0.6% chance of making the playoffs.  Now there's no point is just dumping players, but they should be open to moving anyone over the age of 30 if the right offer comes in."
Brewers,347wfo,30rec,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"Not out of it, but a long way away from getting a playoff spot.. It also hurts that they are losing to teams in their division. That really hurts them"
Brewers,347wfo,Breakpoint,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yo - I agree.  I don't think we should be in full sell mode, we still have some promising players.  There are just some we have to sell - Ramirez, Lohse, K Rod for some young pitching (assuming anyone will take Ramirez at this point, doubt it).  Also wouldn't mind seeing Braun go if we were to get decent pitching for it.  Lucroy, Gomez, Parra (depending upon how the rest of this year goes), Fiers (again depending upon his year), Segura might turn it around, Nelson, Peralta.  Those are all names I think could stay depending upon how the next few months play out."
Brewers,347wfo,P-Munny,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:03:36 2015 UTC,For me I don't want to be a 500 team. If we're not going to make the playoffs I would rather tank and get a #1 pick. I think if there was ever a year to start rebuilding it would be this. There is still some time to go but you shouldn't be optimistic unless we are contenders.
Brewers,347wfo,ZacPack,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:29:48 2015 UTC,"No.  It's over.  Gut the team, rebuild right.  We'll have good draft picks for a few years and hopefully a restocked farm system by the end of this year.  We should be in good shape by 2018.  Yay, baseball."

Brewers,342i8u,Ofreo,3,Tue Apr 28 09:54:08 2015 UTC,"Just remember guys, the Nationals are undeniably a better team than the Brewers.  Edit: I didn't mean for that to come off condescendingly, but there's a different between a good team on a bad streak and a bad team playing below their talent level.  Are the brewers going to keep losing at the rate they're losing right now? Hopefully not, but (not counting this game) we have a -47 run differential after 19 games. We're giving up buckets of runs and we can't score. Baseball-reference's SRS (run differential + strength of schedule) has the Brewers at -3.1 runs per game worse than an AVERAGE team. We are absolute garbage.  For comparison, the Nationals' SRS is -0.4  Double edit: For a better comparison, the 1962 Mets (a 40-120 record, one of the worst teams in the history of the sport) had a -1.9 SRS."

Brewers,342ml1,MasterCashier,3,Mon Apr 27 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"Every lineup is a backup lineup for the next ~10 days. No scoot, no gogo, no luc.  Why is Braun out? Did he pull his damn ribs again??"
Brewers,342ml1,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:25:29 2015 UTC,No apparently RR thinks that the other lineup did ok yesterday so he wants try it again today even though Braun is hitting .526 against Marquis.
Brewers,342ml1,BrewCrewKevin,0,Mon Apr 27 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, I saw that.  Meh, I like it. At this point in the game... we're in a whole new level of desperation. Doing what makes sense is no longer necessary. Look what happened yesterday.  That being said... if Braun is out of the lineup with a .526 average? I wouldn't be surprised if he's healing from something. There may be more to that story than RR is reporting. But... as the Reds made pretty clear, announcing that doesn't help us."
Brewers,342ml1,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:36:26 2015 UTC,Apparently RR decided that even though Braun has a .526 average against Marquis he wanted to keep Parra and Schafer because of what they did yesterday.

Brewers,342ml1,smiles134,3,Mon Apr 27 20:45:54 2015 UTC,Red is for a lefty and blue is for a switch hitter.
Brewers,342ml1,BeHereNow91,2,Mon Apr 27 20:51:23 2015 UTC,I believe red means left-handed.

Brewers,33xb1r,tACorruption,2,Sun Apr 26 20:09:30 2015 UTC,Alright brewcrew kick some red bird ass!
Brewers,33xb1r,madman86,2,Sun Apr 26 20:11:49 2015 UTC,Maybe we should just stick with this line-up for a little bit.
Brewers,33xb1r,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 20:11:50 2015 UTC,Just woke up from a nap. I was drunk at noon (go bottomless mimosas). Anyone want to fill me on how the game has gone?
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 26 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"Fiers let everyone get on base, but didnt yield much.  Some typical brewers errors, but whats new?  In other news, our offense has done stuff."

Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 26 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Also, weve more than doubled Lynn's ERA."
Brewers,33xb1r,cyan101,2,Sun Apr 26 20:16:57 2015 UTC,Hector with the nice catch!
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,2,Sun Apr 26 20:24:16 2015 UTC,Nice catch!
Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 20:24:18 2015 UTC,Ouch.  Cheese grater to the face.
Brewers,33xb1r,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 20:41:00 2015 UTC,That screen flashing in slow motion was weird as fuck
Brewers,33xb1r,Cobruh,2,Sun Apr 26 20:42:19 2015 UTC,Yeah the ball was moving and Reynolds wasn't. That was some trippy shit.
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,2,Sun Apr 26 20:43:10 2015 UTC,"Its how they make LEDs dimmer. They blink faster than the eye can see, but the light still looks dimmer."

Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 20:45:54 2015 UTC,Not a save situation... yet.
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 26 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"Well shit, i forgot we had a 4 run lead.  Been watching the hockey game more."

Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 20:53:11 2015 UTC,Woah. So basically we're going to the World Series this year?
Brewers,33xb1r,Redtitwhore,2,Sun Apr 26 20:55:20 2015 UTC,Something something... grand slam... something RR.

Brewers,33xb1r,silentjay01,2,Sun Apr 26 21:14:30 2015 UTC,Half of our wins are against the cards. Can't say I expected that coming into the season.
Brewers,33xb1r,Salesman89,5,Sun Apr 26 21:15:04 2015 UTC,"If the Brewers win today, can we drop confetti like the Bucks did last night when they pretended to win something momentous?"
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,3,Sun Apr 26 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"I come in peace!  I know you guys think the sky is falling, but my opinion is that you guys can still salvage this season and finish around .500...this team has too many good players (Braun, Lucroy, Gomez, Garza, Davis, Segura, Ramirez) to play like crap all season.  And nobody hates you guys for what happened to Waino, that doesn't make any sense."
Brewers,33xb1r,dontputsaltinyoureye,2,Sun Apr 26 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"Someone should overlay the GTA: V ""Wasted"" graphic over Reynolds hitting the wall."

Brewers,33xb1r,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 26 16:38:46 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear about Wainwright! What a freak injury!
Brewers,33xb1r,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"The lineup, featuring 3 Opening Day starters.  Ramirez has looked good lately.  No idea where he is.  Edit: Braun and Ramirez requested days off. Not sure what to think of that."
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 26 15:42:16 2015 UTC,Oh god we might get no hit today
Brewers,33xb1r,CJL13,2,Sun Apr 26 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"No Maldy, Braun, or Rami.  Plus of course Gogo, Luc and Scooter are still out.  Jeez.  I dunno if i should expect a no hitter today, or if were going to score like 80 billion runs because we seem to do well enough when throwing out half the AAA squad to fend for themselves."

Brewers,33xb1r,skin87,2,Sun Apr 26 16:18:20 2015 UTC,Here's a couple links to different articles that mostly say the same things.
Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"via @AdamMcCalvy: Roenicke is not resting Braun & Ramirez by choice. Both players said they needed a day, according to RR."
Brewers,33xb1r,wiener_cleaner,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:21:14 2015 UTC,That's really strange.  Definitely not a good thing for team unity.

Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:18:47 2015 UTC,Holy crap I thought that one was going out
Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:22:22 2015 UTC,I don't know how I would react if it was Mark Reynolds that burned us.  That would sting.
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:24:57 2015 UTC,Khris is due for a big hit.  He hasn't had one since some time last year.
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:33:45 2015 UTC,since this time last year.   More like it...
Brewers,33xb1r,The_Bostache,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"Man, he almost had that ball.  Impressive play to save the double, though."
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:42:43 2015 UTC,It's so crazy that this lineup just might work.
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"That just happened, didnt it?"
Brewers,33xb1r,gapporin,3,Sun Apr 26 18:43:19 2015 UTC,Clearly pitchers should never hit because the DH is better /circle jerk
Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:44:38 2015 UTC,This is why we need to allow the DH.  /s
Brewers,33xb1r,jn2010,3,Sun Apr 26 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, i hate that its my team constantly giving up hits to the pitcher, but pitchers getting hits is really exciting imo."
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,3,Sun Apr 26 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm squarely in the ""I don't give a shit"" camp, but to do it to stop freak injuries is just silly."
Brewers,33xb1r,TheBause,2,Sun Apr 26 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if it is an Achilles injury it would have happened anyway. Probably would have gone when he was pitching the next inning."

Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:55:37 2015 UTC,Ahh.  So after all the talk about not believing numbers from  Colorado Springs because ERAs were in the 7s we get a batter that was hitting below .200 I think is what they just showed?  Greaaaat.

Brewers,33xb1r,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:40:58 2015 UTC,Is Fiers coming back out for the 5th? Do you risk going 100+ pitches?
Brewers,33xb1r,Valleyoan,2,Sun Apr 26 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, 12 pitches away.  I'd say they let him come out, but on a short leash."

Brewers,33xb1r,ccruner13,4,Sun Apr 26 19:44:34 2015 UTC,This early in the year theyre a bit more careful about not overextending them.  Arms arent as loose as they are in July.

But I am a Brewers fan and as long as there is a team called the Milwaukee Brewers I will be pulling for them no matter how many losses there are.  As my dad always said, ""We hurt when they lose because we are real fans.""  Go Brewers! (See you in person for the first of many games in a little over a week.)"

Brewers,33unog,jn2010,3,Sat Apr 25 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, I remember the pains of the early 2000's well. I went to a game in 2004 when I was in high school with my parents. There were these middle aged people behind us who were really drunk and obnoxious, highlights included:  Shitbag guy: ""HEY PODSEDNIK GET A HIT BECAUSE I POSED SO HAHAHAHAHA!""  Drunk Lady with the most annoying voice ever every time Wes Helms came up to bat: ""WEEEEEEEEEES! WEEEEEEEEEEEES! I LOVE YOU OHMYGAAAAAAAAHHD!""  Shitbag guy again: ""NICE STRIKE OUT OVERBAY, NEXT TIME DON'T BE SO OVERGAY GAHAHAHAH!""  There was probably more but I remember those things clearly. I know pain, I had to sit behind those abominations of human beings. This is nothing. :P"
Brewers,33unog,SolidRambo,5,Sat Apr 25 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, Bucks.  They'll lose the series, but those shots of sad Bulls fans were worth it.  Carry something to next year.  Now go Crew."
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,3,Sat Apr 25 22:18:52 2015 UTC,I can't believe they dropped confetti down 3-1 now.  I guess that was the event staff's super bowl.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"""Yay! We didn't get swept!"""
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"It pretty much is, we weren't gonna win a championship this year, but the fact we won one with such a young team is worth celebrating"
Brewers,33unog,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"Celebrate making the playoffs, fine.  Celebrate winning a game in the playoffs, good.  But acting like they did something exceptional is silly."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:28:45 2015 UTC,IIRC they dropped confetti after every win a few years back
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,5,Sun Apr 26 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"That was impressive, Peralta. You have the easiest guy in the league to strike out 0-2 and walk him on 4 straight. Give yourself a pat on the back. Or don't, whatever."
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,2,Sun Apr 26 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"I am at the game and very drunk and in the seats high enough for people to be holding kohls signs (I'm literally the highest row seats money can buy) and me and some dude are trying to start a Wave (""DO THE FUCKIN WAVE"") and yeah the brewers have sucked so bad so far as expected so yeah I'm just enjoying the train wreck that is our team 👦"
Brewers,33unog,TurboShorts,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:31:54 2015 UTC,Nice emoji game dude  🙌🙌🙌
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,5,Sun Apr 26 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks to Mitch Harris getting to play, the Brewers will DEFINITELY be on Sportscenter tonight."
Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,4,Sun Apr 26 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, RR just got tossed for bitching about the strike zone.  Good to see some fire from him, especially since this zone has been horseshit tonight."
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,4,Sun Apr 26 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"Jesus.  I agree with his gripe on strikes, but fucking do that when the camera and crowd are paying attention.  What a waste."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,4,Sun Apr 26 01:23:49 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that we could have left Will Smith in if that's the result we were looking for.
Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,4,Sun Apr 26 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"lol @ that offer.  ""Chance for an upgrade when the brewers win""  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.  You'll end up spending the last game at home because beer is cheaper there."
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:24:48 2015 UTC,Or tickets will be cheap enough to upgrade yourself lol
Brewers,33unog,dannisbet,4,Sun Apr 26 01:39:06 2015 UTC,I fucking hate managers who micro-manage their bullpen to death. I also hate managers who leave in struggling pitchers for too long.  I think I just hate baseball.
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Sun Apr 26 01:41:33 2015 UTC,the chick to the left of the batter has enormous tits... jesus christ
Brewers,33unog,fightinchunk,3,Sun Apr 26 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"Thats Front Row Amy, and she is a Brewers treasure."
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,3,Sat Apr 25 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"The only perk of this season, so far."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,3,Sat Apr 25 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"And she is there so often, she doesn't even flinch. http://gfycat.com/GlassFilthyGossamerwingedbutterfly"

Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,3,Sun Apr 26 00:39:44 2015 UTC,ouch
Brewers,33unog,fightinchunk,2,Sat Apr 25 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing like a little blatant ineptitude.  Seriously, that made me question whether Segura knows the rules of baseball."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,3,Sun Apr 26 00:11:57 2015 UTC,We are clueless.
Brewers,33unog,ZacPack,3,Sun Apr 26 00:15:49 2015 UTC,Iz they seriuz?
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,3,Sun Apr 26 00:12:09 2015 UTC,I feel out of place
Brewers,33unog,Mizzoufan523,3,Sun Apr 26 00:12:33 2015 UTC,What injury did I miss?
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"Wainwright hurt his knee or ankle, I didn't see it but it doesn't sound good"
Brewers,33unog,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:22:39 2015 UTC,Wow that sucks for them
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:23:20 2015 UTC,Oh wow.
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 26 00:24:04 2015 UTC,Wainright.  Buckled leg leaving the box.  No good explanation or visual evidence of what happened.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,3,Sun Apr 26 00:24:56 2015 UTC,Brewers need to fire their offense.
Brewers,33unog,Redtitwhore,3,Sun Apr 26 00:23:35 2015 UTC,No excuse for missing that call
Brewers,33unog,KQ2eZPackers,3,Sun Apr 26 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Come on, Braun..."
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 26 01:02:11 2015 UTC,Braun needs to prove he's here to win. Right here. Right Now.
Brewers,33unog,adam7765,3,Sun Apr 26 01:05:08 2015 UTC,Yep.  That sums up this month.
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 26 01:05:21 2015 UTC,Crippling depression woo yeah
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 26 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"I set up there in the party deck two? years ago.  Not actually that bad of seats tbh.  Edit: sat, not set.  And im not even drunk..."
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:24:15 2015 UTC,The thing about baseball is that all seats are basically the same unless you can see balls and strikes.  I sat in the Harley deck a few years ago and it was a blast.  Bryce Harper hit one of the Harleys in BP.  I was impressed.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"I like the bleachers out there, the 100s by the bullpen. Once upon a time they used to be about the exact same price as the nosebleeds. Nice breeze when it is hot and you night even get a home run there."
Brewers,33unog,ccruner13,3,Sun Apr 26 01:39:18 2015 UTC,Not sure what's more likely: The Brewers winning a game next week or the Bucks coming back from down 3-0.
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 26 01:45:46 2015 UTC,Vegas wouldnt even take those odds.
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 26 01:36:35 2015 UTC,WTB 8 clones of Segura.
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 26 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"I'll take 9 Jean Seguras, please."
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 26 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand, what is that strange symbol in our boxscore under ""R""?"
Brewers,33unog,Freemont777,3,Sun Apr 26 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"420 Blazek, WTMJ 620 Blazek, etc."
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sun Apr 26 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"Every time my wife hasn't been to a game hey have won, and she isn't here tonight so I'm bringing home a win! Let's go boys!"
Brewers,33unog,MasterCashier,2,Sun Apr 26 02:10:20 2015 UTC,This strike zone is rather bad
Brewers,33unog,jubjub2184,2,Sat Apr 25 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"Come on Braun, whack it 453 feet too left center plz"
Brewers,33unog,jubjub2184,2,Sat Apr 25 23:16:28 2015 UTC,Hey!  Wild predictions are my job!
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,3,Sat Apr 25 23:26:12 2015 UTC,hes obviously not very good at it.
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,3,Sat Apr 25 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"lol, that's also my job."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sat Apr 25 23:27:21 2015 UTC,We have to try something sobs
Brewers,33unog,jubjub2184,2,Sat Apr 25 23:27:49 2015 UTC,This fucker's strike zone is all over the place.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sat Apr 25 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"Parra looked really slow there.  That was just my imagination, right?"
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sat Apr 25 23:32:02 2015 UTC,Lind.. >:(
Brewers,33unog,SolidRambo,2,Sat Apr 25 23:35:52 2015 UTC,Alright... so Peralta has to go through the heart of their order. We need a shut down inning or this game literally might be over.
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"Gave up a hit, but I'll take it."
Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nice inning. Would be nice to get a run here to reward him, but 7/8/9 so why bother hoping :("
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,2,Sat Apr 25 23:55:26 2015 UTC,28 pitches through 3...
Brewers,33unog,Redtitwhore,2,Sat Apr 25 23:56:03 2015 UTC,I feel like inventing a time machine to go back in time and get those 2 runs off the board would be easier than scoring 3.
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,2,Sun Apr 26 00:02:08 2015 UTC,Ugg.  Hate seeing that.  I think he just twisted his ankle though.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:02:55 2015 UTC,there was no torsion tho... not from what I saw. and it was almost instant and no weight. sudden explosive acceleration... achilles tendon rupture? was there a pop heard?
Brewers,33unog,fightinchunk,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know.  I hope it's not serious."
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 00:21:03 2015 UTC,Turned the Bucks on for a Minute.  Holy shit! What a last few seconds!
Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,2,Sun Apr 26 00:22:44 2015 UTC,I did the same and I don't even like the NBA lol
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 00:19:59 2015 UTC,I'm out of beer. and i'm broke. Guess I'm not watchin the game.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 26 00:20:31 2015 UTC,Here's a prediction for you.  I'm going to die of liver failure before the end of the season.
Brewers,33unog,silentjay01,2,Sun Apr 26 00:32:57 2015 UTC,How tall does Maldonado think he is?
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sun Apr 26 00:47:56 2015 UTC,Lol.
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sun Apr 26 00:48:05 2015 UTC,The clashing shades of gold on Maldonado's helmet and chest protector are bugging me.
Brewers,33unog,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:48:06 2015 UTC,Yeah... totally....  (wtf?)
Brewers,33unog,fightinchunk,2,Sun Apr 26 00:49:31 2015 UTC,that would be an out in the 80's.  1880's
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sun Apr 26 00:51:08 2015 UTC,Umpire is a St. Louis fan.
Brewers,33unog,fascistcheese,2,Sun Apr 26 00:49:33 2015 UTC,Isn't Parra supposed to be a gold glover?
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,2,Sun Apr 26 01:10:50 2015 UTC,Peralta is 2-5 with an extra base hit against Jeffress. Don't be surprised if this doesn't work out. Really fucking strange bullpen management.
Brewers,33unog,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Sun Apr 26 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"You fucking called it, buddy. Wow."
Brewers,33unog,BustingChops22,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:23:00 2015 UTC,lol yeah wish i was wrong.

Brewers,33unog,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 01:32:35 2015 UTC,My roommate and I turned on the lingerie football league game cause it's more interesting than the brewers. I'm impressed that people actually go watch this in person.
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 26 01:32:02 2015 UTC,Is there Lingere football on tonight?  Edit: There is!
Brewers,33unog,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 26 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one team is up by like 40 points at half time"
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 26 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, its about to be 50ish to 0."
Brewers,33unog,buttplugpeddler,2,Sun Apr 26 01:45:40 2015 UTC,My buddy was watching an illegal stream of the game and the streamer changed the channel to basketball. For some reason this amuses me.
Brewers,33unog,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 26 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"This is the Brewers, Matt.  There are no ""feel-good opponents"".  We are the feel-good opponent."
Brewers,33unog,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:47:29 2015 UTC,We could play nazis and bean every one of them in the neck or something.  That'd feel good.
Brewers,33unog,SolidRambo,2,Sun Apr 26 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"Approaching the mound.. Turanga Leela!  BEAN, BEAN, BEAN!"
Brewers,33unog,ccruner13,2,Sun Apr 26 01:51:33 2015 UTC,Ueck just said over 35000 people showed up. I find that hard to believe.

Brewers,33unog,necropaw,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"Also, bit surprised the roof isnt open.  Its downright warm up here in the northcentral part of the state.  I'd think if the sun is baking on the roof and coming through the panels it'd just about be sweltering."

Brewers,33ue7y,AemenLeny,22,Sat Apr 25 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"People that think firing the manager will improve the team know nothing about baseball. Brewers fired Ned Yost because he couldn't manage an army of toy soldiers let alone a Major League Baseball team on the verge of making their first playoffs in 26 years right?  Well magically he led the Royals to a World Series last year (incidentally lead by players Doug Melvin traded away) and oh yeah they happen to have the best record in the AL right now too.  This team's failures start at the top, Doug Melvin has to go. Btw who do you think hired Ron Roenicke? Doug Melvin. Fire Ron if you want, but it won't change anything other than making ignorant fans happy for about 2 minutes."
Brewers,33ue7y,MustBeNice,8,Sat Apr 25 23:24:01 2015 UTC,"+1 on this. I think we need to clean house. Ron is a part of that, but our farm system has been terrible for a while now. Guess who traded all that away? Melvin. Guess who didn't get anything through the draft to restock it? Melvin. Guess who formed the team now on the field? Melvin.   Doug was good enough to get us out of complete suckage, but I don't think he is good enough to get us to the next level. And there is no way I'm paying $8/beer for the shit that is trotting out on the field right now."
Brewers,33ue7y,madman86,7,Sat Apr 25 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"The Royals made the playoffs in spite of Yost, not because of him. The manager isn't all that important in baseball to begin with, but that doesn't mean they can't have a net negative effect"
Brewers,33ue7y,miamiflashfan,2,Sun Apr 26 03:14:18 2015 UTC,Yost nearly cost his team the season with his idiotic pitching change in the wild card game. He couldn't manage his way out of a wet paper bag.

Brewers,33ue7y,TurboShorts,4,Mon Apr 27 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"As much as I tend to find myself liking him, he isn't that good of a manager. Last years wins seem, imo, to have come from the energy the team was creating. They loved it and when they started to lose the spark and power just absolutely disappeared. To me that speaks a lot to how RR lets the mood of his team go: He's not a motivator, and he certainly isn't good at bullpen management.   So, yes. We should fire him. I'd prefer before the break even."
Brewers,33ue7y,PocketWocket,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:24:09 2015 UTC,I agree. He is not the manager we need right now. That isn't to say he is bad (I don't think he is as good as some people on this sub seem to think).
Brewers,33ue7y,madman86,2,Sat Apr 25 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"Idk about anyone else, but it seems to me that the problem is way more than RR.  Its an organization issue, not just managing. Its everything. Firing RR wouldn't really solve anything."

Brewers,33ue7y,JasonYaya,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:34:32 2015 UTC,"He most likely will lose his job, unless there is an almost instant 180 degree shift in play. Changing managers now or midseason probably would not have an immediate impact, or the kind of impact we want, and I cannot think of any past examples of there being success. This is a completely different scenario from the one that got Yost fired. Also, the interim hire will only be a band-aid for the rest of the season, as an actual replacement would probably be hired during the offseason, along with new coaches and a new mindset of how the team will run. With the way things are going the guy who hires that guy will not be Doug Melvin either."
Brewers,33ue7y,SharkyStephens,2,Sat Apr 25 21:57:07 2015 UTC,What about Harvey Kuenn replacing Buck Rodgers. That was pretty successful mid season replacement

Brewers,33qpxi,swiftwings88,3,Fri Apr 24 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends upon how we play in the next two weeks. If we continue to lose, then it is inevitable but even now there is still a very slight glimmer of hope.   I think everyone would be on the block with the exception of:    Lucroy - Club friendly contract through 2017 and done of the best catchers in baseball which can help young pitchers) Paralta - Too much upside to give up, could be an ace some day Nelson - Similar to Paralta, about 1-2 years behind in terms of development  Braun - No other reason than he has a ridiculous contract, no team will want that (plus he has a ton of baggage)   I think we would have to get an exceptional set of prospects for Gomez as well, so I'm not sure he can be traded at this point, but a team with a deep farm system that is on the brink may sell out to try and win now. Personally I'd hate to see him go.   I think we have a good, young middle of the field (though I'm not sold on Scooter yet) which is the start to building a really solid team."
Brewers,33qpxi,madman86,2,Fri Apr 24 20:41:44 2015 UTC,Ryan Braun is such a disappointment for so many reasons.  He could cripple this franchise with his contract if he doesn't start playing up to it.
Brewers,33qpxi,BeHereNow91,0,Fri Apr 24 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the team could go after him to reduce the contact given his PED usage? Of course, at that point you would HAVE to trade him because there would definitely be bad blood. I also wonder about the impact it would have on future signings."
Brewers,33qpxi,madman86,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"That'd never happen. If it did, the Yankees wouldn't be paying A-Rod."
Brewers,33qpxi,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I dont think Gomez would get traded"
Brewers,33qpxi,BrianTheLady,2,Fri Apr 24 20:56:50 2015 UTC,"If we don't trade him, we lose him to a Boras contract anyway. I'd love to keep Gomez in Milwaukee as much as anyone, but we're just not going to get to keep him. Better to get a couple handsome prospects than just letting him walk."
Brewers,33qpxi,gobrewcrew,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:45:30 2015 UTC,"Plus he turns 30 this December. If we don't trade him this season, teams can simply say, ""Why would I give that much for a 30-year old outfielder?"""
Brewers,33qpxi,SpartanBuck,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"everything you say about Lucroy just makes him a much more valuable trade chip, teams will pay more because he's inexpensive has multiple years left on his contract and is a legitimate all-star catcher"
Brewers,33qpxi,profJesusfish,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:47:28 2015 UTC,I guess it really depends upon who we would get for him and weather or not they felt MM could take over as the primary. We don't really have a good catcher that is MLB ready in the farm system at this point.
Brewers,33qpxi,madman86,2,Sat Apr 25 20:43:41 2015 UTC,Honestly years of Herb Kohling have have left the minors bare of top prospects and Lucroy is probably the teams best chance to bring in some top level prospects we just need to find the right contender with a hole at catcher.   I think Maldonado plus a journey man back up wouldn't be terrible especially on a 65-75 win team that we may be for the next few years
Brewers,33qpxi,profJesusfish,0,Sat Apr 25 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, except I think we'll trade Braun. We'll end up paying a bunch of his contract, but we need the roster space. Plus we can probably get 1 pseudo-prospect for him."
Brewers,33qpxi,SpartanBuck,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think we'd trade Braun in a second if someone would take most of his contract, I've been about as big of a Braun apologist as there is but it's become obvious to me post juice Braun isn't the player he used to be"
Brewers,33qpxi,profJesusfish,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:35:18 2015 UTC,Obviously we'd trade him if someone took his contract. No one will though. I think we'll still trade him and just eat his contract.
Brewers,33qpxi,SpartanBuck,4,Sat Apr 25 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"Rami, and Garza. Lohse if he settles down. (Rami better go to a contender.), K-Rod and Broxton, with Will Smith becoming our new closer (eh)  Edit: Don't see Braun going anywhere with his contract, Gomez won't be leaving this year unless we make a absolute killing off of him, if he goes attendance drops a ton.   Edit 2: I also don't believe Lucroy will be traded, ever. He's the type of player that can be the face of a franchise, and I imagine if we go into full rebuild we'd keep him, just to keep attendance from falling to like 15k a game."
Brewers,33qpxi,jubjub2184,3,Fri Apr 24 19:00:23 2015 UTC,Agree 100% on this list I think a AL team would trade for Rami looking for a bat and I think they will ship out a bunch of their pitching but I think you could build a real solid team around Lucroy and Gomez.
Brewers,33qpxi,orange_lazarus1,2,Fri Apr 24 19:23:07 2015 UTC,I am already expecting to see Aram in a White Sox uni by August 1st.
Brewers,33qpxi,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"I don't see why anyone would want to trade for Rami, he's retiring at the end of the year and he's hitting .167."
Brewers,33qpxi,gimmesomespace,2,Fri Apr 24 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"He's a vet, and he always starts off slow, I highly doubt he'll be hitting below .270 by the time the all star break is around."
Brewers,33qpxi,jubjub2184,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:32:52 2015 UTC,Teams will treat him like any other soon-to-be free agent.
Brewers,33qpxi,BarcaBadger,2,Sun Apr 26 02:34:18 2015 UTC,"Gomez for sure.  Lohse and Garza if anyone wants them.  Maybe Luc, but probably not.  Rami, if anyone would take him."
Brewers,33qpxi,jn2010,2,Fri Apr 24 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they'll hold onto GoGo for another year to keep people in the seats.  If were going full rebuild they probably should trade him this year, but they also dont want attendance to drop by a 500k+ next year."
Brewers,33qpxi,necropaw,5,Fri Apr 24 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hope that they trade him this year. I'm worried that Gomez's value may dip next year. Strike the iron when it's hot. I understand where you're coming from them with the attendance though."
Brewers,33qpxi,jn2010,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could see that.  Good point."
Brewers,33qpxi,SpartanBuck,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:12:45 2015 UTC,We need to trade him this year. He turns 30 in December if I remember correctly. Just that number alone gives other team's more pull in negotiating.
Brewers,33qpxi,gimmesomespace,2,Sat Apr 25 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"Lucroy would be terrible to trade, he doesn't make that much money and he's pretty much a cornerstone of the team."
Brewers,33qpxi,profJesusfish,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:31:34 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Lucroy I think now (minus the injury of course) is a great time to trade him if this is going to be an all out rebuild which I think it should be. This team won't be good for 2-3 years minimum and Lucroy has two years after this left on his contract so he would just end up being a luxury item on a bad team, plus he'll be 30 when his contract is up and I don't think it's a good idea for the Brewers (or any team) to invest much in a 30+ year old catcher."
Brewers,33qpxi,adam7765,2,Sat Apr 25 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"We'll be in first place by then guys, right? :'("
Brewers,33qpxi,BarcaBadger,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Ken Rosenthal reported that tons of teams are calling about Segura. If they go into rebuild mode, they'll have Arcia up by the time they're competitive again. They could get a good return for Segura."
Brewers,33qpxi,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:35:06 2015 UTC,"I really like Segura, but we're loaded at SS. We trade Segura in July, then we've got Sardinas ready to come up and Arcia a couple years away.  I can't see Lohse staying whatsoever. He's a great leader around the clubhouse, but he's gone next season and I'd imagine a contender will be looking for somebody to bolster the back end of their rotation.  I could see either Broxton or K-Rod going. Broxton because it's the final year of his contract (and $$$) and K-Rod because they've traded him once, why not twice?  I don't see Gomez (this year, I definitely see him going either in the off season through a trade or mid-season in 2016) going unless they get one hell of a deal."
Brewers,33qpxi,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"Lohse for sure,  Aram although he may have a no trade clause in there, and since he has committed to this being his last year may not welcome a trade.  Garza is probably gone as is Broxton and KRod.  Do I hope Gomez and Lucroy are dealt, yes, but I would be shocked if they were.  The only way to pump up the farm system is buy trading those guys and getting impact talent back in return."
Brewers,33qpxi,Ofreo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:01:36 2015 UTC,Think anyone would take Broxton? Maybe with some money thrown in.
Brewers,33qpxi,workthrowaway68,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:55:23 2015 UTC,He could be one of those DFA deals where someone picks him up and then they send a middling prospect in return.  The goal is to get his  contract off of the books.

Brewers,33mssi,spaceXcadet,3,Thu Apr 23 20:27:41 2015 UTC,Was watching the highlights and am relatively new to some of the nuanced rules of baseball. Why wasn't this an infield-fly rule?  http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2015_04_23_cinmlb_milmlb_1&mode=video&content_id=85835883&tcid=vpp_copy_85835883
Brewers,33mssi,atomiczap,7,Thu Apr 23 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"The actual rule: ""An INFIELD FLY is a fair fly ball (not including a line drive nor an attempted bunt) which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, when first and second, or first, second and third bases are occupied, before two are out. The pitcher, catcher and any outfielder who stations himself in the infield on the play shall be considered infielders for the purpose of this rule. When it seems apparent that a batted ball will be an Infield Fly, the umpire shall immediately declare Infield Fly for the benefit of the runners. If the ball is near the baselines, the umpire shall declare Infield Fly, if Fair. The ball is alive and runners may advance at the risk of the ball being caught, or retouch and advance after the ball is touched, the same as on any fly ball. If the hit becomes a foul ball, it is treated the same as any foul."" http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp  Basically, it should have been, it was more effort for him to let the ball bounce than to catch it, even the announcers said he could have easily caught the ball. It was a bad call."
Brewers,33mssi,spaceXcadet,3,Thu Apr 23 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I had thought. Even if it wasn't a 'fly' ball, still seemed to break the spirit of the rule. I was confused because mlb.com is calling it a 'smart' play, rather than a bad call, and no one seemed to be complaining about it."
Brewers,33mssi,atomiczap,2,Thu Apr 23 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it didn't change the outcome of the game, but I would definitely say that was a bad call."
Brewers,33mssi,Z_ford_prefect,3,Fri Apr 24 00:54:15 2015 UTC,perhaps it wasn't enough of a fly ball? seemed to be more of a bloop line drive
Brewers,33mssi,MasterCashier,0,Thu Apr 23 20:34:17 2015 UTC,It wasn't high enough. It has to be a popup to have the infield fly rule in effect.
Brewers,33mssi,atomiczap,3,Thu Apr 23 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't classify that as a line drive, would you? The rule says nothing about height, only that it is not a bunt and not a line drive and the infielder can catch it with ordinary effort.  The rule is in place so that teams can't do exactly what they did, purposely drop an easy fly ball to get two outs instead of one."
Brewers,33mssi,MasterCashier,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:47:47 2015 UTC,Yeah i guess this rule kind of comes down to ump discretion. The umps must have thought otherwise but I think he could have easily caught that and only had one out.
Brewers,33mssi,atomiczap,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"You are right, its at the ump discretion, I just don't see how you don't call that when he Clearly let a catchable ball drop on purpose to get two outs.  I guess it didn't change the outcome, but it still seems kinda shady. But I guess if you can get away with it, why wouldn't you?"

Brewers,33nhch,eray21,5,Fri Apr 24 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, he wont be traded, because no one would be dumb enough to give anything for him.  He's the most unathletic OF on the team and has spaghetti noodle for an arm. He strikes out once for every hit and will never hit above .275.. surely theres better production to be had out of LF. His OPS was a wimpy .756 in his first full season Last year. We'll keep him till he qualifies for arbitration then he becomes someone elses burden."

Brewers,33nhch,Lorkes34,5,Fri Apr 24 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"Its about fucking time!  Three years too late unfortunately.  The problem that I have with Melvin being the one who is running the rebuild is that he has an inflated sense of his own guys' value.  he reportedly asked for Madision Bumgarner in 2011 for Corey Hart, and then in 2010 in talks with the White Sox and Prince Fielder asked for 3 top tier prospects in return for a guy owed over $16 million and not projected to have surplus value.  In addition, he always seems to ask for MLB ready talent, which this rebuild should NOT be about.  He should be going for the best possible return, and if that means getting guys who are in A ball it should and needs to be done.  This team isnt going to compete for at least 5 years given the state of the farm system, and they need to have a long term plan.  let someone younger and with more vision do this rebuild."

We all have responsibility for what's happening.""   Glad to hear him say it publicly. Admitting fault for your mistakes publicly takes a lot. The ultimate question is, what sort of accountability does he have to that fault/mistakes?   I still feel he should be out, based purely on the state of our farm system. Combine that with what has been going on with on-field production (or lack there of) and that doesn't really sit well."
Brewers,33nhch,madman86,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was going to dispute what you were saying at first, because our starting lineup is pretty solid. It's the same team that was in 1st place this year, and I can't really name many on the 25-man roster that shouldn't be there. (Schaeffer, maybe herrera, Rodgers and others are not very proven.. you could certainly make a K-rod case) but some of that is due to injuries already.  But what you say about the farm system is dead on. He's also responsible for the pipeline. And over the past few years, we've sold off a lot of our minor league assets to make a few playoff runs, and it hasn't really built back up. The minors are a major liability for this team right now. No depth at all."

At the same time, lack of motivation didn't give up two grand slams in one game or garner a league worst 5.08 ERA.   TL;DR EVERYONE should be on the hotseat"

Can't blame the players on that one. That's solely on Melvin. This is nearly the exact same team that collapsed and nothing changed managment wise except firing both the hitting coach and first base coach."
Brewers,33lf0a,smiles134,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm all for accountability, but I'm curious to why everyone is so quick to blame DM and RR? This seems to happen in other sports too .. the team is tanking, so fire the coach/manager/whatever.  Very little has changed in our roster, yet we're playing like utter garbage. The biggest change I've noticed is, the guys who were producing 9 months ago are not producing today. Why is that? What could DM and RR be doing differently to help them play better? Or were there signs that the guys they had last year were going to start falling apart? What were those signs, and what should they have done to heed them?"
Brewers,33lf0a,prof_shine,3,Thu Apr 23 15:22:40 2015 UTC,"It usually takes a long time for me to start blaming managers/coaches for on field performances, but based on how last season ended and how this season's started, we need shakeups in the clubhouse. This team is stagnant and needs to be changed from the top down. Roenicke looks like he doesn't give a shit, he gives the same old, ""yeah, we played a good game for the most part, just couldn't get it done"" shit after every game and it's getting to be infuriating."
Brewers,33lf0a,smiles134,0,Thu Apr 23 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"So how would changing the team ""from the top down"" change things? Fire every manager, hire a bunch of underqualified people from other teams and/or our own janky minor league system? Call up the entire Colorado Springs roster to play this year? How's that going to result in more wins?  I'm frustrated too, but before I'm going to buy into a ""blow up the team"" approach, I'd like to know exactly why has this team gone from competent pro players to janking it up almost every night.  However, I look at the Red Sox (my girlfriend's hometown favorite team, and thus my adopted AL team), and they went from last to first after a management shakeup. But by all accounts, there were decently well-documented (and specific) clubhouse issues with the people they traded and/or let go. Is anything like that going on in Milwaukee?"
Brewers,33lf0a,dusters,2,Thu Apr 23 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"This team has a philosophy that just isn't working anymore, and that starts with the manager and general manager. It's not the player's faults that we have consistently one of the worst  farm systems in the league. It's because we've traded away all our prospects for aging stars who can't contribute they way they have before. There's a reason we're consistently in the bottom of the league in late inning relief. It's because we gave 13 million dollars to a guy who had an FIP of over 4.5 last year, and we do shit like this all the time. That doesn't start on the field. That starts with the manager and GM. They're not setting this team up for success."
Brewers,33lf0a,madman86,2,Thu Apr 23 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"Because shitty roster + shitty farm system = a decade of mediocrity, and that's where we are headed. I'd be fine with it if we didn't strike out on our first round draft pick every year for nearly a decade."
Brewers,33lf0a,prof_shine,2,Thu Apr 23 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"Managers are paid to get the best out of the players. This team looks sloppy and undisciplined so far this season. That is on the manager and his coaching staff (IMO). I honestly don't think he has the players any longer, and that is a huge problem.   Under DM our farm system has continually been ranked at or near the bottom for talent. That doesn't bode well for us going forward. And we haven't committed to winning now, or rebuilding so we have been stuck in this limbo state for the last 2-3 years.   That is why I blame RR and DM."
Brewers,33lf0a,madman86,0,Thu Apr 23 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"So what's RR doing wrong that has made the players sloppy and undisciplined? What does it mean if RR ""has the players"" or not? How does that affect their play on the field? Whether or not a hitter makes solid contact or a pitcher makes a pitch?  What has DM done (or not done) to make the farm system so bad? Drafting? Development? Scouting? How much say does DM have in those things?"
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,3,Thu Apr 23 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"RR's job is to make sure the players are ready. Clearly they are not. His job is to make adjustments so the club plays better. They are not. If the players are not listening to, or playing their best for RR, he does not have them. After the collapse last year and the start this year, I'm not sure the players have faith that RR can turn things around when they are bad. That is what I call not having the players.  DM has traded away most of the farm talent we did have (some one posted a list of all the players that were in our farm system that are now playing great else where) and signed players to horrible contracts. We have so much money in aging players, it is really scary actually. Granted something like Braun you can't really foresee but some of the others aren't as forgivable. DM has the ultimate call on almost all of the contracts (unless MA says otherwise, which I don't really think happens too often) and drafting stuff."
Brewers,33lf0a,Ofreo,3,Thu Apr 23 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"sloppy and undisciplined play is a result of coaching.  The brewers for the last few years have been horrible at getting bunts down. They make too many outs on the bases. They miss the cutoff man far too often. This is basic stuff that has nothing to do with talent and when you cant execute the basics on the field that speaks to a lack of leadership and a lack of discipline.   As for the farm system..... Doug Melvin is the GM, so I would hope he has PLENTY of say with drafting and developing. Doug has hired people to help him build a farm system. If he isnt holding these people accountable for their failures then hes not doing his job.   If I manage a restaurant that would be like me saying .... ""yea i know the cook has been serving shitty food for months now but cooking the food isnt my job so what am i supposed to do about it"" ... you address the issue and hire a new goddamn cook."
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,0,Thu Apr 23 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"""This is nearly the exact same team that collapsed ""  Which is also the same team that spent 4 months in first place. There is nothing in the history of the players we had/have to suggest that they would be that bad down the stretch last year and so bad right now. Or so good at the beginning of last year too though. All said and done, this team finished last year and will most likely finish this year (if kept together) at a bit under .500. Kind of what was expected.   As for a replacing DM, I don't know what magical GM land people are expecting to find a better one. Maybe a change would be good, but many of those same people calling for firing DM seem to think most other GM's in the league are idiots because they think the Brewers can just trade for prospects for what they have on the roster.   Look at who is there, not too many current players would net us anything useful in return. Braun is never going to get anything unless we pay his salary for years (hurting the team in the long run). Maybe a few middling prospects for a Lind or Davis. We really have no pitchers anyone will covet unless someone gets desperate at mid-season. Luc and Gomez may get some higher prospects; but prospects are just that, prospects, with no guaranty they will ever amount to anything.    Tearing down and starting over is fine if you have a plan, but look at the attendance so far at MP, pretty good. Getting rid of all good and liked players may affect attendance and cash, which would hurt any rebuilding process. It is not just as simple as saying get rid of players and start over.    I am frustrated watching this team right now. It is pretty clear the season is basically over in April and it hurts. I just don't see reacting to this slow start by getting rid of everyone as being productive or in the best interest of the team overall. Let them start doing better, think about how you want to get where you want to be, make a plan for it, and then execute said plan. I think Mark A is smart enough to do that.... or hope he is at least."
Brewers,33lf0a,Ofreo,3,Thu Apr 23 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"The team that spent 4 months in first place last year was a .500 team that had a red hot april because their bullpen spent the first month performing completely over their heads. Once a few injuries took place and everyone settled back to career norms this was an average team. They played .500 ball from may-late august. Then they completely collapsed and finished right about .500.   You said around .500 is what you expected last year and this year and I agree. we probably get it together a little bit and finish about .500. The question is ...... why are you okay with that? Why are you okay with overpaying mid level free agents to come to milwaukee and help us reach our goal of being .500 and keeping fans in the seats?   In case you didnt notice that is the EXACT approach that sent the milwaukee bucks into a decade long abyss that lost them a huge chunk of their fan base. I look at the signings of guys like lohse and garza and think ...""good lord. that is exactly the type of signings herb kohls bucks would have done""  Doug melvin has to be held accountable because he is in charge. He saw the trend with this team for a few years now and we still have no viable replacements coming up from the minor leagues. The drafting and player development in our minor league system has been AWFUL. Im sorry but khris davis is not a corner outfielder on a good baseball team and he is considered one of the draft successes. Thats not a good sign.   So yes. Doug melvin should be held accountable for putting us in a position where we have to overpay some mediocre free agents just to try and play .500 ball. The only way out of this cycle is to dump salary and trade assets to get young talent in our organization. If melvin isnt willing to do that then he should be replaced by someone who is and someone who is willing to take a look at the entire minor league system and see evaluate where we are failing.   Trust me. I dont like the idea of blowing up and starting over either but spending the next decade being the milwaukee bucks is much much worse."
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,2,Thu Apr 23 16:52:00 2015 UTC,"For a mid level team like the Crew, I don't know that it is a terrible strategy; to build a good .500 team that you hope will get lucky and win some extra games, make a move later in the season, and sneak into the playoffs. I am pretty sure that was the hope for this season and think everyone knew there would be some rough times after 2015 and wanted to try and squeeze one more year out of what we have, I just don't think anyone expected this level of bad play. Really though, I don't see how it can continue so there is that.  I don't think Loshe or Garza have done really any worse than what was expected of them. That is just the price to stay .500 in baseball today. For all their trying, landing the big free agents, pitchers especially, has been impossible for the team, they just can't offer enough money or years to make it work. Lets not forget that Garza where we lost a draft pick (and I suspect a few more, like the Grienke trade where we lost many prospects) were pretty much Mark A meddling as a GM . Those who are in the know are the ones that need to decide how accountable DM needs to be for where they are, and I think MA is really admitting he had a part in the problems with the win now attitude that cost the team by keeping DM for the last year or two. A change will come at GM, but it will be interesting to see when and how.  Again, I don't see getting much in return for players on the roster. Maybe dumping salary is a good idea and taking whoever in return, but the team will then have to decide if the savings will be better than the loss of fans for a few years. People are pretty loyal in Milwaukee, so maybe they will stick around a last place team, the Brewers need to figure that out.   The nail on the head is you saying the scouting, drafting and development of players in the minors needs a lot of work. Just horrible. Yes, some prospects were given away, but I don't know that we have lost any in positions where we are currently hurting for players. The few pitchers we gave up are not exactly lighting the world on fire. A change needs to come in the player development part. How much DM is at fault for that is also up to those who are in, and understand what they are trying to do as an organization.   Who knows, maybe they will go on a tear and make it interesting by the end of the season and everyone will rethink what the team needs. Sports can be strange sometimes, but it is fun to love the winning and hate the losing."
Brewers,33lf0a,adam7765,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:57:40 2015 UTC,Agreed on MA. I have heard that he put pressure on doug to sign guys like garza and lohse. I love mark and what hes done for the franchise but id prefer it if he stay out of baseball operations.

Also, he is not wrong about blaming players since they are, to some extent, under-performing. This is especially true for players like Fiers, Lohse, and Aram. However, I could see a management change occur after the trade deadline. In fact, I would be shocked if RR is still around by September."
Brewers,33lf0a,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"I think his statement is a ""public"" statement, in that he wont throw people under the bus in the press.  But Lohse, Fiers and Aram, I would contend are playing to their ability.  The issue is that Attanasio believes that the team that is on the field is worthy of first place based on April last year.  He just doesnt get it.  As long as he desires an active role in the baseball operations of this franchise, the team is never going to be able to move forward.  It is his money, he can do what he wants, but he is a business man, not a baseball man.  Owners who get involved in the baseball end of things usually wind up making their teams worse.  He has to take some of the blame for this problem on himself."

I'm still absolutely baffled when I see a man on second, nobody at first and it's hit to the SS and they get thrown out trying to get to third. Another example is when you're caught trying to steal third for the third out. (Gomez obv) These stupid outs just don't need to happen. Would better management make a difference or are the egos of major league players so big it wouldn't matter?"
Brewers,33lf0a,madman86,2,Thu Apr 23 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"I get that Ron and Doug are not the one's on the field throwing pitches or taking at bats but when nearly the entire team is playing badly, you do have to start looking at management.    Its the managers job to motivate these players, and find out what's wrong.  Ron hasn't been doing that.    I appreciate that Doug took us out of mediocrity for a while but he's been our GM for what?  13-14 years?  And we've only made the playoffs twice?  I get the whole small market thing and developing players but even small market teams should be making the playoffs more than twice in 13 years."
Brewers,33lf0a,EthyleneGlycol,3,Thu Apr 23 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"Especially considering we had one of the best offenses in the major leagues for what? Five or six years?  And only two playoff appearances (and one series win) to show for it?  They've been consistently unable to draft and develop pitching.  I do think Doug is a good GM.  He's kept us competitive and has shown a knack for making pretty good trades and outside of Suppan has spent fairly wisely in free agency, but I think it may be time to bring in some fresh blood and try something new with drafting and development.  If we're going to become competitive and stay that way it has to start on the farm."
Brewers,33lf0a,dusters,2,Thu Apr 23 15:11:12 2015 UTC,I disagree about spending wisely in FA. Look at all the aging players we have right now and the money we owe them. I'm with you on everything else though.
Brewers,33lf0a,AtlanticHiawatha,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Lohse provided two solid years of value (still has a chance to recoup some worth this season too).  Ramirez was solid for three years outside of injuries.  We probably shouldn't have picked up his contract but in all honesty who else was going to play third base?  Remember, they weren't planning on a rebuild this offseason.  Same with K-Rod, decent price assuming they were going to contend.  Garza's contract wasn't an overpay considering his track record and how expensive pitching has become.  Unfortunately, they've become albatrosses with the need to rebuild, but I don't think they were bad signings at the time."
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Sure the players suck, but management is the one who picked out sucky players."
Brewers,33lf0a,sjm1541,-1,Thu Apr 23 22:39:08 2015 UTC,ITT: People who can't seem to comprehend the notion of the actual players playing the fucking game being held responsible for winning and losing.  I'll say it again and million times more; managers have little impact on wins and losses. The very best managers are worth 2 WAR at best.
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,3,Thu Apr 23 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"agreed, but, what about the complete lack of discipline shown on the field over the last few years. Inability to get bunts down. Inability to advance runners. Missing the cutoff man. Making boneheaded outs on the bases.   those have all been glaring issues for a while now and I would contend the manager absolutely has an impact on those areas."
Brewers,33lf0a,madman86,0,Thu Apr 23 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"That is stuff thats learned at a young age and is only polished by major league coaches. If we want to blame someone in the organization then it should be the minor league coaches, but these guys should know the basics when they get to the top level."
Brewers,33lf0a,WimpyDeer,2,Thu Apr 23 17:48:55 2015 UTC,well it sure as hell doesnt look like its being learned at the minor league level and its definitely not being polished up here at the big league level so something has to change.
Brewers,33lf0a,jackmeriusIII,2,Thu Apr 23 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"The bigger problem is there is no accountability when dumb, mental mistakes are made repeatedly."

Brewers,33jvek,Valleyoan,2,Thu Apr 23 02:51:47 2015 UTC,?
Brewers,33jvek,brewersfan412,3,Thu Apr 23 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"Last year we gave him the herky-jerky between AAA and the Majors so as to avoid him gaining super-2 status and costing the club more money in the time we have him under control.  He was absolutely dominating AAA with nothing left to prove, but wasn't getting moved up because of it.   Of course he and anyone else will call it 'no big deal'.. but when the time comes for a contract extension, or a new contract, things like that tend to make guys want to take their services elsewhere."
Brewers,33jvek,Valleyoan,0,Thu Apr 23 03:07:04 2015 UTC,that's the business side of baseball. is kris Bryant going to high tail it off the Cubs because they sent him down for a couple weeks to avoid paying him?
Brewers,33jvek,ExamineYourself,2,Thu Apr 23 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"First of all.. Kris Bryant is represented by Scott Boras, so he will be going where the most money is being offered no matter what.     Second of all.. Kris Bryant's deal wasn't super 2 status, it was a simple contract control clause. Kris Bryant WILL gain super 2 status.. so will Addison Russel... because the Cubs are worried about winning, not paying guys a couple million more a year sooner than they would've otherwise.   I'm just saying, sometimes guys are more prone to resigning with the same organization that brought them up if they feel they were treated well by them. But not when they're not only held back when they deserve to be up, but also screwed out of millions of dollars because of it.      Not to mention the fact that he would've made the team better anyway. Wanna talk about ""the business side"" talk about winning."

Brewers,33jvek,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:01:10 2015 UTC,So I was at the game last night. The energy is completely gone from the stadium. When Scooter hit the double and the Siggy got him to third people were actually really into the game. When they failed to score him though you could just feel the energy get sucked from the stadium. At that point it was as if the fans were just waiting to see how the team could lose.   And to lose in that fashion is just pathetic. The one guy you cannot have on base and K-Rod walks him. Then he is so out of control that he can't even get to the plate on a wild pitch and costs us the game.   It was just depressing to watch the team waste a great start from Nelson.

Trade the following:   Gomez Braun Lohse Garza Broxton Ramirez K-Rod Lind Almost all of the bullpen   Rebuilding isn't enough for a better team, nor does it necessarily mean we'll get a better team. That said, the Brewers need prospects and in the worst way.   I'd like to keep Nelson, Peralta, and probably Fiers in the rotation. I guess bring up Jungmann (because it really couldn't hurt anymore), see how he does. Stretch Thornburg out in Triple-A like they're doing now and then put him back in the rotation. Is it a perfect rotation? Far, far from it, but it's all in-house talent and it can work.   Free-agency highly depends on how the Brewers feel about their own first. Personally, move Khris Davis to first base. I don't see why not. They don't particulary care for his arm in LF, which is why Parra is on the team.   How I would do an in-house roster next year:   C: J. Lucroy, M. Maldonado 1B: K. Davis, J. Rogers 2B: S. Gennett, L. Sardinas, H. Gomez  SS: J. Segura, H. Gomez 3B: L. Jimenez, L. Sardinas RF: S. Peterson CF: T. Taylor LF: G. Parra, E. Herrera (OF back-up) SP: J. Nelson, W. Peralta, M. Fiers, T. Thornburg, T. Jungmann RP: C. Knebel, J. Jeffress (closer?), W. Smith, D. Goforth, A. Pena, M. Strong, J. Bradley (long reliever)   Of course, who knows how that actual team would do. Granted, if they trade away all the players I mentioned, the haul could be pretty signifcant. Plus, this allows the front office to see where exactly they would need to focus. I'd say the OF and bullpen would be my first two concerns. A nice SP couldn't hurt either."
Brewers,33kh9i,machiavellism,2,Thu Apr 23 14:15:56 2015 UTC,"This was the sort of answer I was looking for. I like the idea of Jeffress as the closer. He's a fireballer who strikes out a lot of guys and not as wild as K-Rod. Frankly, after his 62-save season with Anaheim in 2008 he lost his edge when he went to New York.   I'm surprised Jungmann, Bradley and Pena haven't contributed yet at all. It's time to see what they can do after six years in the minors.   I feel like Braun would be hard to trade bc who wants a salary that big to put on their plate. If we were back in the AL, I'd stick him at DH and leave him there until we find a trade partner. The Giants or Mariners would be a good target for Gomez to go. Both teams need a better CF and have plenty of starting pitching and prospects to give away."
Brewers,33kh9i,workthrowaway68,2,Thu Apr 23 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt replace Ron Roenicke because this is not his fault.  He is a very good manager that simply has a bad team to manage.  I would fire Doug Melvin and most of his staff with the exception of Ray Montgomery.  I would trade Lohse, Garza, KRod and Broxton and simply hope for the best.  But wouldnt expect any impact level prospects to be returned.  I would trade Gomez to say the Blue Jays for their rookie CF is it Dalton Pompey and also ask for one of their top pitching prospects Aaron Sanchez or Daniel Norris and then would ask for one more mid level guy.  And I would also trade Lucroy to the Angels after the draft and ask for Sean Newcombe and Andrew Heaney and another mid level player or two.  Heck with what we would be giving i Lucroy I would take Josh Hamilton back to play 1B if they picked up most of his salary."

Brewers,33kh9i,workthrowaway68,2,Thu Apr 23 09:55:14 2015 UTC,I agreed with you right until you said rehire Jack Z.  Problem there is that Jack Z is as much of an idiot as Melvin is when it comes to running a team.  He was a great scouting director (apart from his pitching shortcomings) but the Brewers have a better in house replacement for Melvin already in Ray Montgomery.
Brewers,33kh9i,MustBeNice,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean rehire him as a GM, sorry. But yeah his draft picks have been fantastic in Milwaukee and now in Seattle.

Whereas we literally have 3 significant home grown graduations in the past decade essentially; Yo, Nelson, &   I am interested to see what Montgomery can do, but Jack Z is a proven commodity."
Brewers,33kh9i,ZacPack,2,Thu Apr 23 18:53:37 2015 UTC,Either fire Roenicke or Completely rebuild the roster because Roenicke is the total opposite of the manager we need.

Brewers,33ia3s,MurDoct,2,Wed Apr 22 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Just read a quote from MA that he's not looking into the Mgr and GM positions right now, RR wasn't out there giving up grand slams he says. If he doesn't recognize that Melvin and player development have been crap, I can only hope he sells this team to someone who cares about winning more than he does."
Brewers,33ia3s,cheezturds,2,Thu Apr 23 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"Mark has been great for this team, and I don't think I'd want him to sell it.  All he's doing is refusing to throw the manager and GM under the bus, at least publicly, and there's nothing wrong with that.    He's also right in saying that this team isn't a 2-13 team.  The problems we have on the field don't reflect the deeper problem of our empty farm system.  The problems we have are that players are vastly under-performing, and there's a mental cancer that comes with playing this poorly.  But it would be hard to believe that RR and Melvin aren't on the hot seat.  Last year's collapse has carried over into April, which is absolutely inexcusable from a management standpoint, and our lack of depth in the minors means we have no future beyond the contracts of our current players.  I think a disastrous first half will give way to some house cleaning, and we'll see a new manager come in.  Perhaps a new GM will follow after this season."
Brewers,33ia3s,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"Valid points, I hope you're right. Just seems there's a buddy system going on and no one is getting fired.

Brewers,33ia3s,cheezturds,4,Thu Apr 23 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"Thing is it seems if our prospects aren't ready to be game-changers straight away they're gone for a MLB player who can be. Guys like Escobar and Cain could've been great Brewers, but because they weren't major-league ready right away we traded them because we wanted to win ""Now"" not later."
Brewers,33ia3s,CJL13,3,Wed Apr 22 20:41:31 2015 UTC,They wanted to make the most of the last year they had with Fiedler and thought Grienke could give them a shot in 2012 as well. It's still a defendable trade IMO considering the success the franchise was reaching for.
Brewers,33ia3s,crewblue,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"It just seems like Melvin made those ""win now"" trades and is now refusing to pay for it.

Brewers,33ia3s,MustBeNice,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Guys like Escobar and Cain could've been great Brewers   And they were pretty good Brewers when given the chance.  Escobar was a solid defender who hadn't found his batting stroke yet, and Cain was hardly a ""prospect"" when we traded him away.  He hit .306 in 43 major league games.  Escobar doesn't hurt so much after we picked up Segura (comparable players -- both are solid defenders but inconsistent hitters), but losing a guy like Cain is tough.  We picked up Gomez and he's really blossomed, but he'll look for a big contract somewhere and we'll probably lose him, whereas we could have retained Cain as a home-grown player and rebuilt this team around him, along with our other young talent."
Brewers,33ia3s,BeHereNow91,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:20:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. It seems that whenever we have a good looking prospect who may be 1-2 years away from being ready, we unload him for a veteran on his way out (at least out of Milwaukee after a year or two)."
Brewers,33ia3s,Ryeskernatorr,2,Wed Apr 22 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"The overall failure of drafting is certainly key.  But so is the fact that each of the three main pitching trades (Sabathia, Greinke, Marcum) in the '00s were very short-term deals.  Especially at the time of the trades, LaPorta, Odorizzi/Escobar, & Lawrie were good enough prospects that they could've been used to net younger pitchers under team control for much longer than the three vets brought in.  And then beyond that, the club could've cycled talent through better by flipping the younger pitchers acquired.  It's really easy to dismiss this concept out-of-hand simply because it didn't happen, but the Brewers' lack of foresight extends beyond just poor drafting.  Add in spending lots of money on expensive veterans like Lohse (+ forfeited 1st-rd pick), Ramirez, Garza, K-Rod, etc... it's just not a forward-thinking club, and it's troubling that the same decision makers are still in place, as of right now, to oversee whatever direction the club takes going forward."
Brewers,33ia3s,CM816,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"Reading too far in to prospect rankings is a depressing game to play, it's mostly based on hype, and even worse, hype left up to each writers own.   Orlando Arcia, Tyrone Taylor, and Clint Coulter are all top 100 guys IMO. Even though Coulter can't play defense to save his life, he definitely has star-power written all over him.   Taylor Jungmann will most likely be in the bigs by the end of this year. So that's a recent first round pick that made it.  Also: Pretty good chance Tyler Cravy, 17th round 2009, gets in to the bigs soon too.   But overall, yes, the front office and player development fucking sucks."
Brewers,33ia3s,Valleyoan,4,Wed Apr 22 19:38:36 2015 UTC,Wish I was more excited about Jungmann but I've seen way too many Brewers pitching prospects make the majors and struggle.  I'm more bullish on the rest but it just seems like we have this massive gap of nobodies before they get to Milwaukee.
Brewers,33ia3s,SolidRambo,3,Wed Apr 22 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"Jungmann is a great illustration of your point too, imo. We took him over Jose Fernandez and Sonny Gray. Now while there are certainly intangibles that can affect how a player develops, it is strange that Gray and Fernandez grew into young studs while Jungmann probably won't amount to much more than a #5. At that point you have to question those who are developing young players. Either those in the Brewers system are doing a shitty job, or the ones in the Marlins/A's system are doing an amazing job (I suspect it's both though, tbh).  Prospects are just that.. prospective players who may work out. Kind of like you said, since we haven't really produced anything special in awhile, that suggests to me that a) Those developing the prospects aren't doing a very good job b) We are really bad at forecasting the future of young players or c) we're just very unlucky."
Brewers,33ia3s,PeteyB53,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"Excellent points, particularly the last paragraph.  I got into a heated Twitter discussion today with a smart but diehard Brewers fan who tried to defend the farm system, mostly by pointing out prospects at AA and below.  Granted, there are some intriguing names among those (Coulter, Arcia, etc), but we're really grasping at straws after a while, searching for positives.  Help isn't coming anytime soon.  Baseball America's top 100 minor league prospect list for 2015 has just 2 Brewers players on it... at #93 and #94.  Dreadful."
Brewers,33ia3s,Valleyoan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"The most telling thing to me is what Brett Lawrie said when he left. He said he was GLAD to be out because he felt like the Brewers farm system was trying to CHANGE who he was as a player.  What exactly those changes were is unknown, but that really doesn't sound good. If you try to fundamentally change the way a player plays the game then trade him, someone STOPS doing that and starts doing well, that seems like a MAJOR issue."
Brewers,33ia3s,crewblue,2,Thu Apr 23 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I don't think Jungmann's that good either. I wish we could combine Jungmann and Cravy in to one person. I just wish the team would bump these guys up anyway, and if they succeed, GREAT! if not, oh well at least they got a shot, bump em back down.   Especially in a season like this, where there's seemingly nothing else to lose.   Jungmann's got a little better stuff, he can over-power guys but control is an issue.  Cravy's got control and finesse, but his stuffs not over-powering."
Brewers,33ia3s,dnalur,3,Wed Apr 22 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"Fully agree- get them in there!  I'd rather have a tank season and get a clearer idea of who is for real or not, plus get their feet wet a bit, then to slog through mediocrity yet again.  I think this awful start might force them to just plug in the young guys and see what we have.  Could have some silver lining."
Brewers,33ia3s,nutty15,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:32:19 2015 UTC,The amateur scouting has sucked since Jack Z left. I was hoping for a shakeup in that department last year before Bruce Seid died.
Brewers,33ia3s,WimpyDeer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:36:54 2015 UTC,It's like the Bud Selig era starting all over again.   God I hated watching us get kinda good and then watch stars get traded away to shine somewhere else. Selig making bank on trades as we suffer. Tight ass.
Brewers,33ia3s,daftparagon,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:08:33 2015 UTC,Jack Z needs to get fired and come back to scout.

Brewers,33iqe9,roastbeefandcoffee,4,Wed Apr 22 23:39:48 2015 UTC,Of course not.  You've still got one in the (spank) bank.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,10,Wed Apr 22 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"Alright guys, break your Ron Roenicke photos and hand lotion. Let's crank one out for the team!"

Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,8,Thu Apr 23 02:21:33 2015 UTC,(Bold?) Prediction: Roenicke will be fired on Monday if the Brewers don't win more than one game before then.
Brewers,33iqe9,fly1ngorb,6,Wed Apr 22 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Just got an ESPN update saying Mark is ""not looking at the manager or general manager."""

Brewers,33iqe9,sniper84,5,Wed Apr 22 23:46:31 2015 UTC,Ultra-rich boss-man doesn't want to admit he made a doody.  That is the only thing that makes any sense to me.  He is just in pure denial.

Brewers,33iqe9,silentjay01,8,Thu Apr 23 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"Wow ump, we don't need you to skim strikes to help us lose.  We're great at that on our own."
Brewers,33iqe9,pfelon,5,Thu Apr 23 02:38:27 2015 UTC,Jimmy Nelson should go fucking berserk after this game.
Brewers,33iqe9,xsists,4,Thu Apr 23 02:41:11 2015 UTC,Feeling a Braun walkoff to lead off the 9th.
Brewers,33iqe9,fly1ngorb,3,Thu Apr 23 02:01:20 2015 UTC,Nah.  Braun double and Lind walkoff.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,3,Thu Apr 23 02:02:01 2015 UTC,You sure know how to turn a guy on.

Brewers,33iqe9,roastbeefandcoffee,5,Thu Apr 23 02:20:37 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Lets walk Hamlton.  That sounds like a good idea.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,5,Thu Apr 23 02:23:25 2015 UTC,Well... That a creative way to lose.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,6,Thu Apr 23 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"So k-rod has now blown the only two games I've been to this year, so that's fun"

Brewers,33iqe9,roastbeefandcoffee,6,Thu Apr 23 02:35:37 2015 UTC,Chapman will get the benefit of any pitch that's even borderline. You can tell the ump knows exactly who's pitching
Brewers,33iqe9,KQ2eZPackers,3,Thu Apr 23 02:38:23 2015 UTC,Point proven on the last pitch of the game
Brewers,33iqe9,KQ2eZPackers,5,Thu Apr 23 02:40:44 2015 UTC,Can we add a baseball bat and a pitcher's glove to the dumpster fire picture?
Brewers,33iqe9,Nadie_AZ,6,Thu Apr 23 02:38:38 2015 UTC,That guy yelling the whole game was annoying as fuck.

Brewers,33iqe9,McCFred,3,Wed Apr 22 22:52:35 2015 UTC,but do we really?
Brewers,33iqe9,spedoy,5,Wed Apr 22 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yes we do. Some of us support all our local teams. The Bucks are doing great and are in much better shape than the Brewers are in terms of a rebuild.   I get it if you don't like basketball you don't like basketball. But the Milwaukee mindset of ""the Bucks are always bad"" is really frustrating because even when they make the playoffs as the youngest team by far, it's still not good enough for the fans."
Brewers,33iqe9,BricksAndBatsOnVR,2,Wed Apr 22 23:33:08 2015 UTC,Too bad the nba sucks. But hey we did have wisconsin in the championship this year so we have that going for us.

Brewers,33iqe9,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 23 00:43:50 2015 UTC,Can't say I've ever seen two balks in a game before
Brewers,33iqe9,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 23 00:45:16 2015 UTC,Apparently hes notorious for catching guys off base by walking the line between balk and .not balk
Brewers,33iqe9,BrianTheLady,2,Thu Apr 23 00:54:41 2015 UTC,Well we had a pitcher last night give up a grand slam two innings in a row.

Brewers,33iqe9,pablito_locito,4,Thu Apr 23 00:52:11 2015 UTC,Maldy really stretches the 'comfort' stance.  He was basically a toddler in a sandbox there.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,4,Thu Apr 23 00:56:20 2015 UTC,You know what the best thing about Maldy catching is?  Being amused at watching him to yoga behind the plate lol  That guy goes into more different positions during a game (or a single AB for that matter) than i would have thought imaginable...
Brewers,33iqe9,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 23 01:43:51 2015 UTC,Until he takes one square in the nuts.  That'll end his creative posture.
Brewers,33iqe9,jn2010,3,Thu Apr 23 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Nelson needs a standing O from that crowd, damn."
Brewers,33iqe9,necropaw,6,Thu Apr 23 01:45:26 2015 UTC,Can I get a balk?

Brewers,33iqe9,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Apr 23 02:24:23 2015 UTC,The ump called it strike three.  He really does want to get the hell out.
Brewers,33iqe9,fly1ngorb,3,Thu Apr 23 02:34:27 2015 UTC,Alright boys tonight is the night. We are going against Johnny Cueto so we should be good for like 6 runs. You know that we can hit the best pitchers in the game.
Brewers,33iqe9,MasterCashier,3,Thu Apr 23 02:36:59 2015 UTC,Did we really lose to Jason Marquis yesterday or was that a dream?

Brewers,33iqe9,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 23 02:15:06 2015 UTC,You would've thought Dusty Baker was still coaching the Reds with that pitch count.

Brewers,33hd5t,machiavellism,5,Wed Apr 22 15:12:13 2015 UTC,Good.
Brewers,33hd5t,jn2010,7,Wed Apr 22 15:12:49 2015 UTC,The Brewers are becoming my favorite AAA team.
Brewers,33hd5t,PigFarmington,2,Wed Apr 22 18:26:24 2015 UTC,:(  But true.
Brewers,33hd5t,necropaw,4,Wed Apr 22 19:48:00 2015 UTC,Tyler needed more time in the minors before they brought him up in the first place.  Short sightedness like that kind of led us to where we are now.
Brewers,33hd5t,gimmesomespace,8,Wed Apr 22 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"Well, Thornburg was ready, his season last year apart from injury, proves that.  Wooten is a suspect if anything.  Thornburg was a letitimate prospect."
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"He was hyped a lot when he was coming up through the system, I always thought they wanted to turn him into a starter.  He has a few CGs in the minors, just feels like a waste to throw him into the bullpen, but it isn't like he's a viable starter now or when they called him up."
Brewers,33hd5t,gimmesomespace,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"He had a decent track record in the minor leagues, but scouts always saw him as a reliever.  He has a pretty small frame and that lack of third pitch is the thing that relegates a guy like him to the bullpen.  Brad Lidge and Billy Wagner were small too and that didnt keep them from being very valuable as closers.    Would you rather have a #4 or #5 starter who doesnt give you much return or production, or have a guy be a really good end of game reliever?"
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,0,Thu Apr 23 17:34:04 2015 UTC,Thornburg was decent a couple-three years ago too in the limited action he saw for Milwaukee. I'm surprised he hasn't done better so far.
Brewers,33hd5t,prof_shine,4,Wed Apr 22 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"He's being mis-used in my opinion.  He should have been in the bullpen full time, even down in the minor leagues, being groomed as a closer."
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,2,Wed Apr 22 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely being mis-used.  They spend all that time stretching him out as a starter, get him and his arm used to throwing extended amounts every 5 days.  Then completely change it, and have him throwing high stress pitches for an inning, 3-4-5 days out of the week.  I was not surprised when he went down with arm problems last year."
Brewers,33hd5t,Valleyoan,2,Wed Apr 22 19:44:43 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the point I was thinking of, we just tore down the plan to turn Thornburg into a major league starter and threw him into the bullpen.  IIRC they had him start like 2-3 games a couple years ago, but he clearly wasn't ready to pitch 6+ innings of major league baseball.  He was pitching well, but couldn't go deep."
Brewers,33hd5t,gimmesomespace,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"He did seem to do pretty well out of the 'pen, didn't he?  Question then .. How do you tell who'd be a good closer and who'd be a good starter?"
Brewers,33hd5t,prof_shine,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:23:41 2015 UTC,Third pitch  You need at the very least an average third pitch to go along with at least one plus pitch and at least a 2nd average pitch.  Throw in plus command and you have a decent starter.
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"Thornburg should be stretched out into a starter, as I've mentioned before. I don't think he has the stuff to be a closer, but he has good longevity and stamina. I don't think he'll ever be a CG kind of pitcher, but we never seem to have those, anyway."
Brewers,33hd5t,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"He is at best a bottom of the rotation/#3 starter though....  he lacks that third pitch to be a useful starter.  If you switch him to the bullpen, and he gets his velocity back, he throws less pitches and innings and he turns that into a 97 mph fastball perhaps."
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think he's ever gonna be an ace. And he can learn a third pitch. Look at what Nelson did with that curve this offseason."
Brewers,33hd5t,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:35:01 2015 UTC,"Well you might be able to learn one, but it takes a very long time to command it and make it an effective pitch.  Nelson already had the curveball and he was simply able to command it better.  (Lets not forget he is only two starts in so far though too.)  Thornburg has a big curveball, but after 4 years he has shown he cant improve or command it well enough to even be an average pitch."
Brewers,33hd5t,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"Well, at the rate flies are dropping, he'll be our #3 by the middle of June."
Brewers,33hd5t,Nadie_AZ,6,Wed Apr 22 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"Literally means nothing.  Changes nothing, it's like moving the leftovers from a Tupperware to a ziplock bag. It's still crappy leftovers in the fridge.  Wooten is garbage. 5 runs in 8 innings so far in AAA. Expect to see more of that in the bigs.  And Thornburg out of the pen, is garbage. Which is why they'll probably put him in the rotation in AAA, let him get all stretched out, used to throwing 5+ innings every 5 days...only to move him back up and put him in the pen again in the bigs. Throw him an inning every day, and cause arm problems again.   Why not pull the trigger on Pena? He's already hot coming out of the pen in AAA, let's get some more value from that trade we got him in.   Tenure is HIGHLY over-rated in the bigs to me. ESPECIALLY by the brewers front-office."

Brewers,33hb2u,gimmesomespace,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"If we go full on rebuild, I'm hoping next year he pitches well and then around trading time, the Brewers could move him.

Brewers,33h54l,Valleyoan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"Why is this thread being downvoted? This was the ONLY barely silver lining to last nights game. At least our offence showed signs of life, even if it was half of the bench that injected it.  I agree, it's bizarre.   FWIW. I'm confident we'll start playing good baseball at some point this season. We won't make it to the playoffs without some bizarre nearly impossible stroke of luck. But it's FAR too early in the season to say that we'll continue playing like this for 5 more months.  I also have a 20-pack with 15 more games left on it. I left in the top of the 6th last night, hoping I am given reasons to stay in future games. Trying to look at the glass as just having water in it."

Helps you get deeper into the fight and see more mechanics, at the expense of probably hitting some soft or hard enrage.  Other than that, if you're packing 4 healers, you better have 7-8 DPS to go with it."

Brewers,33fpak,MustBeNice,5,Wed Apr 22 03:42:49 2015 UTC,"Please this is DM's fault.  As much as people love to give credit/blame the managers, many statistician SABR nerds have argued a manager maybe affects 1-2 wins a season. AKA we'd be maybe 3-11 or 1-13 with Tony La Russa managing.  Melvin is to blame. Poor trades and piss poor drafting for the past decade."
Brewers,33fpak,PeteyB53,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:54:26 2015 UTC,"He's not awful with hitting talent, however he can't draft anyone who can play good defense (or when he does they're traded) or any pitching talent"
Brewers,33fpak,MustBeNice,2,Wed Apr 22 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo Cain is not only one of the best CF defenders in the game, he's also one of the best defenders in all of baseball period.  Anyone who watched the Royals in the playoffs last year will attest to this.  Oh yeah he's also hitting around .420 with a 1.100 OPS right now as well. No big deal. Alcides Escobar is consistently ranked as the 4th or 5th best defensive shortstop. JJ Hardy believe it or not is ranked as the 3rd or 4th best, and has by far the most power for a defensive minded shortstop. Brett Lawrie is known as having some of the top 3rd base defensive seasons in the past few years in a long while. In fact Baseball Reference even adjusted their algorithm because Lawrie was scoring off the charts defensively.   Too bad Doug traded them all away, but hey we have Carlos Gomez to show for it.  And speaking of Gomez, LOVE him, & he has the capability to being one of the top 5 defenders in the game, but he makes way too many boneheaded flashy plays that don't work out and this severely hinders his ratings."
Brewers,33fpak,PeteyB53,2,Wed Apr 22 13:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah Cain and Escobar were the ones I specifically had in mind. I had completely forgotten that Brett Lawrie was a trade piece, so glad we got Shaun Marcum for him.....  However I feel like he wouldn't have worked out for us, reading how the Brewers tried to ""Change him""  makes me think our whole farm is just sort of fucked.  I love Gomez too, however like you said, stupid decisions + there's no way we keep him after this season, Scott ""big money"" Boras will make sure of that."
Brewers,33fpak,madman86,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"Just when I start to really like Gomez, he will make some stupid  throwing error or base running error. It is like he isn't mature enough yet to realize he isn't superman and can't make super-human plays."
Brewers,33fpak,ivandragostwin,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"You know, I kind of agree, but without Greinke there is 0 chance we go on the run that we did in 2011. And we managed to pick up Jean Segura for him.   The Marcum trade ended up pretty bad but Lawrie is by no means a star, and cant seem to stay healthy for a full 162.   Would I take having those 4 guys back (Cain, Ordorizzi, Escobar, Lawrie) over what we have? Of Course, but it was fun to go for the title in 2011, and we came damn close.  Also, I doubt having those guys makes us a contender when we cant develop any type of minor league pitching. I know it is a impossible game to play but having Cain over Davis, Escobar over Segura and Lawrie over A-Ram with Ordorizzi in the rotation? Not a chance we compete with the Cards. Until we start to develop some pitching and not get the bargain FA #4 starter we won't be a contender.   Also, the whole Braun thing kind fucked DM over. He looked like a sure-fire star and centerpiece. If he knew about the PEDs that is one thing, but you just cant predict when a guy is going to get caught cheating and turn from a star into a below average player over the course of 2 seasons. I truly wonder if we make those trades if this Ryan Braun in playing LF for us in 2011. That whole tease and waste of a contract kinda ruined this Brewers team."
Brewers,33fpak,MustBeNice,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:23:41 2015 UTC,"but without Greinke there is 0 chance we go on the run that we did in 2011.   I'm seriously so tired of hearing this.  Zack Greinke had a 3.83 ERA & a 1.200 WHIP and only pitched 171 innings in 2011. He had a 1.4 WAR. For context an average starting pitcher is worth about 2 WAR. That means he wasn't even league average that year.  Greinke's 2009 Cy Young season he was worth 10.4 WAR.  Literally 9 Wins better.  Also the Brewers had 96 wins and won the division by 6 games in 2011. With a replacement level guy say, Marco Estrada pitching instead of Greinke they may have had 95 or 94 wins, still a comfortable margin of victory over the 2nd place Cardinals. So no, do not say there ""there is no way"" they make the playoffs without Greinke because that's simply not true.  Sorry not trying to pile on, I just hate how Milwaukee fans praise Greinke like he was the second coming of Sandy Koufax when he was incredibly average & we WAY overpaid to get him. Honestly one of the most lopsided trades in all of MLB in the last decade. Also not to mention his injury playing basketball that kept him out for a month.  Edit: for comparison Zack Greinke had more or less the exact same year Garza had in 2014 with the Brewers   Zack Greinke (2011)  28 Starts 3.83 ERA 1.200 WHIP 171.2 Innings Pitched 161 Hits 45 Walks 19 HRs 1.4 WAR Matt Garza (2014) 27 Starts 3.64 ERA 1.182 WHIP 163.1 Innings Pitched 143 Hits 50 Walks 12 HRs 1.4 WAR"
Brewers,33fpak,ivandragostwin,2,Wed Apr 22 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"That is interesting, even though the stuff of Grienke is insanely better than the home run machine Estrada, he certainly didn't have great numbers with the Brewers. I stand corrected. We probably would have won the central without Grienke."
Brewers,33fpak,MustBeNice,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"For sure it's okay, many people sanctify Greinke's 2011 but when you look at the stats they just don't add up. & Estrada is home run prone but I just brought him up because he most likely takes Greinke's spot in the rotation if they don't make the trade for Zack. And he actually only gave up 11 home runs in 2011, which is about on par with Zack's rate.  Sabathia's 2008 second half though? Literally probably the best post all star game numbers a pitcher has had in 30 years.  Brewers don't SNIFF the playoffs without CC. Shift your Greinke praise to him."
Brewers,33fpak,ivandragostwin,2,Wed Apr 22 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely, and even though we lost Brantley (funny how LaPuerta was the big time prospect in that one), I would do it again.   Now that I look at that Greinke trade, it was pretty bad even at the time. Ordorizzi was one of, if not thee top pitching prospect in our organization, and Escobar looked like a very solid SS at the major league level although he struggled at the plate IIRC. Cain, was tougher to predict because he was still so raw (hell, he still is) but you could see the talent. To trade away 1 already very young solid Major League SS, and 2 top prospects we better be getting Cy Young Zack."
Brewers,33fpak,MustBeNice,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, we gave up a ton to get Sabathia but it was so worth it to reach the playoffs for the first time in 26 years. & man did he ever deliver. Plus Brantley only barely broke out last year, 6 years after the trade & we had a pretty crowded outfield anyway with the likes of Nyjer Morgan, Aoki, Kotsay, Corey Hart, Braun, Khris Davis, Parra, Gomez etc."

Brewers,33fpak,Nadie_AZ,3,Wed Apr 22 03:35:28 2015 UTC,I won't mind if we lose a bunch of games this year if our pitching is giving up 12 and our hitting is giving us 10. Each game.

Brewers,33cpqc,PathofTotality,20,Tue Apr 21 14:28:01 2015 UTC,Why did the article even mention playoffs. We cant even win a game and you bring up playoffs? PLAYoffs? PLAYOFFS?
Brewers,33cpqc,franklin_stubbs,7,Tue Apr 21 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"Sadly, he's right. The last few seasons have been indecisive. We don't have a consistently robust farm system- and we farmed it out for Sabathia, again for grienke, and a couple other mid-season moves since. Every year, it seems we make incremental improvements, and end up remaining in mediocrity.  I know it's got to be hard to be a GM. You can't just sell the farm for propects. You can't just turn before the season starts and trade away Aramis, Gomez, and Lucroy. Then you don't get attendance. You have to at least give the illusion of hope.  Either way, it's time to sell the farm now. The season started, people see it. I said before the season ""If things go right, we have a chance. Everyone needs to stay healthy, and we need our big guys back to form."" Obviously that's not working. Braun, Ramirez, and Lucroy have been terrible. Now we have 3 starters on the DL in Gomez, Lucroy and Gennett. There's not a chance anymore."
Brewers,33cpqc,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Apr 21 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's time to build the farm. Not sell it. You just talked about how they ""farmed it out for CC & Greinke...to end up remaining in mediocrity""  Maybe I'm mistranslating you saying ""the farm"" as the entire organization, including the big league team, but every time I've ever heard or used farm it's only meant to describe the minor league guys.  But back to the point: I'd be selling everyone on the ML roster for every high-end prospect I could get.   Carlos Gomez for 1 Big league CF and 2 AA prospects? OK.  Kyle Lohse for two young AA pitchers? OK.  Matt Garza for a AAA hitting prospect? OK.  Aramis Ramirez for .50 cents? Hell Yes."
Brewers,33cpqc,Valleyoan,5,Tue Apr 21 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"Wait, are we giving them 50 cents or are they giving us 50 cents? This is important."
Brewers,33cpqc,Nadie_AZ,2,Tue Apr 21 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"Neither, I saw a pitch from 50 cent and I did not like what I saw"
Brewers,33cpqc,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Apr 21 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"No, that's what I'm saying. I agree with you. I was using ""selling the farm"" as an expression for selling off all of our expensive assets."
Brewers,33cpqc,workthrowaway68,6,Tue Apr 21 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"The only thing I think he is wrong about is the Gomez/Lucroy point where he says they wouldnt move them.  Its been about 12 years or so since a 100 loss season, and to do a true rebuild, you need to tear it down completely."
Brewers,33cpqc,smiles134,8,Tue Apr 21 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think we move Gomez, idk if we move Luc. He's a player good enough to build a team around. But then again, we could get great young prospects for him. We'd be stupid not to move GoGo though"
Brewers,33cpqc,CM816,2,Tue Apr 21 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Lucroy's talented enough to be a centerpiece, but he's also only under contract for two more seasons after this one.  I don't want to invest the significant money it'll take in an extension to retain a good catcher who'll be entering his age-32 season in 2018.  He should be on the trade block as well, and given his steal of a contract, might well be the guy to get the best return of any player the Brewers will shop."
Brewers,33cpqc,smiles134,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:34:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough
Brewers,33cpqc,scyork,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, but by the time we have a good enough team surrounding lucroy how old will he be and what kind of contract will he be demanding?"
Brewers,33cpqc,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"Well how old is Lucroy now?  And he is taking his 2nd stint on the DL in 3 years today.  My point is that how old will he be when the rebuild is over?  My opinion is to tear it down completely, including key parts of the front office staff, do an Astros style Sun God Ra primordial rising from the deep."
Brewers,33cpqc,smiles134,3,Tue Apr 21 16:55:14 2015 UTC,He's 28. A broken toe has nothing to do with his playing health. Kris Bryant could break his toe on a foul ball and no one would be questioning his health. 2 DL stints in 3 years is really not bad at all.
Brewers,33cpqc,workthrowaway68,-1,Tue Apr 21 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"So maybe the DL time isnt a huge issue since they were both isolated incidents, but Tulowitzki has had some of those as well, and now he has a fragile tag attached, another injury or two and Lucry winds up the same boat.  But my point is that if you are going to rebuild, its going to take at least 5 years, more like 7 or 8 if you do it correctly.  And by the time Lucroy will be way past his prime and usefulness."
Brewers,33cpqc,smiles134,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Tulo is different, he's injured literally every season, and sometimes multiple times. Tulo has missed 222 games over the past three seasons. That's why he has a fragile tage. Just like Corey Hart can never stay healthy."
Brewers,33cpqc,Valleyoan,0,Tue Apr 21 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"5-8 years to rebuild? lol wtf?  Yea, if you're starting from scratch with only a couple rookie-ball teams maybe.   If done correctly you can rebuild in less than a year. But people throw the term rebuild around pretty loosely without any definitive factors as to what a rebuild is.  Rebuild the organization? Rebuild the 40-man? Rebuild the 25-man?  I could argue the Cubs just did a rebuild in 1 year.   In 7-8 years almost every major leaguer will be past his prime."
Brewers,33cpqc,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"The Cubs rebuild has been ongoing for at least 5 years.  This Brewer team's farm system is pretty awful, there is some impact talent right now (albeit pretty raw at low A Ball this year) but thats 4 years right there until maturity, and you need a good 3 to 4 years more of solid drafts.  Thats what a good rebuild looks like.  And its the one the Brewers need to take on."
Brewers,33cpqc,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"They threw their entire farm system at a chance to go all the way in 2011. Eh, so they came up 2 games short of going to the WS. Was it worth it?  I openly wondered what it meant when they lost Nashville and had to take up AAA farming in Colorado Springs.   I don't think they have the system to rebuild in 1 or 2 years. I like some of the young talent that is popping up, but it's gonna take longer. Braun's boat anchor of a salary certainly isn't going to help. Maybe he needs a stint in AAA."
Brewers,33cpqc,Valleyoan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"I thought the AAA affiliate change was really mostly a business move by all of those respective AAA teams. I'll tell you what it does mean though, it means if any of our pitchers have an ERA under 5 in AAA they should be in the bigs, lol.  Brauns contract is a franchise killer if he doesn't turn it around. I doubt he has any options on it, so a AAA stint won't happen, but I agree that it would probably serve him, and most of the guys on our 25-man well.   If we can get a top draft pick, things can turn around pretty quickly. Like a silver-spikes winner who'd be ML ready in two years tops. And the way things are going so far, it's looking like a high-draft pick in our future."
Brewers,33cpqc,AtlanticHiawatha,2,Tue Apr 21 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the broken toe is a result of bad luck; Lucroy's age didn't cause a fastball to glance off a bat directly onto his big toe.  Otherwise, I agree with you. I've been shy of advocating a rebuild for a while and often felt anger when you continuously came in here to shit all over the team and demand Attanasio tear it down, but you're right. You were always right."
Brewers,33cpqc,workthrowaway68,0,Tue Apr 21 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose I can take that with a grain of salt, and it was never meant to ""shit on the team"".  I just know this game, and happen to live in this city.  They did it right, apart from developing pitching in Melvin and Jack Zs early years, but since 2012 they have gotten it wrong imo.  I will go out and see games no matter how well they are playing, I love the game more than the team.  Just makes it more interesting if you have a group that knows what they are doing.  take away ""fandom"" for a second and who would you rather be going to see play games right now, the Cubs and Astros, or the Brewers?  it took time for both of those teams to get where they are, but they are on the rise.  The Brewers could be at the end of their ""fall"" right now if they had started earlier when the time was right."

Brewers,33cpqc,EthyleneGlycol,2,Tue Apr 21 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The Brewers have kind of muddled through the last few years, trying to extract the last bit of value they could from a core that carried them to the playoffs.  But now those players are either gone or old and the farm didn't produce anybody to replace them.  Somewhat unfortunately (depending on the perspective you have) they spent 150 days in first place last year, allowing them to delude us and perhaps even themselves into thinking they had a competitive ball club.  It looks like we're more of the team that finished last year as opposed to the one that started it.  Blow it up, I say."

Brewers,33cpqc,MurDoct,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"The hot start last year really hid the fact that the Brewers were nothing more than a .500 ball club in 2014. The Cubbies had a better record than we did after the All Star break if I'm not mistaken.  Melvin did pretty much nothing to help the team get to that next step and make the playoffs after falling short last year.   When Mark was named the owner of the team I got the impression that he was more ""HEY LOOK GUYS I OWN A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAM"" than actually trying to help get the team moving in the right direction. He got more involved the last few years and the team really turned the corner and made baseball fun to watch in Milwaukee. 2 playoff appearances and a division title.   Now I dont know what the hell is going on. The commercials are cute and all, but this team is just straight up unwatchable. I really wonder what the breaking point is to shake up something in this organization. With some of the talent we have, 2 wins is a joke. It makes me think that when the team is this bad, that starts at the front office.  It sucks because going to Brewers games and tailgating is an absolute blast. They want to keep playing ball like this they won't be seeing any of my hard earned money. Maybe if enough people get that message across then something will be done to keep people in the seats."

Brewers,338pfs,smiles134,4,Mon Apr 20 18:09:48 2015 UTC,Melvin should have been gone a few years ago but that might be my opinion. Changes do not happen when they should as far as the Brewers organization is concerned.
Brewers,338pfs,MurDoct,3,Mon Apr 20 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"He's absolutely terrible.  Seriously he resigned Francisco Rodriguez AGAIN to a $13 million dollar contract, when he's been painfully average the past couple seasons, when we couldve gotten essentially free equal production by promoting a AAA arm, or Chris Perez or Wooten or whomever. Bullpen is literally the one place that doesn't need help, and he signs Broxton last year who is massively overpaid & K-Rod again to a ridiculous deal. Plus throw in Chris Perez & his flirtation with picking up Papelbon's 13 million dollar contract. Melvin has an obsession with proven ""closers"", yet completely ignores the dearth of young talent at Starting Pitching, 1st Base, & 3rd Base."
Brewers,338pfs,MustBeNice,3,Tue Apr 21 18:33:38 2015 UTC,Melvin also has some obsession with signing people who are well into their 30s.

Brewers,338pfs,coolcool23,5,Mon Apr 20 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if they fall too far behind, it may be neigh impossible to get back to a wild card spot.   They may need to play baseball at a .700 clip to get to a wild card before this funk is over."
Brewers,338pfs,nior_labotomy,2,Mon Apr 20 15:57:32 2015 UTC,For a good team sure. This team isn't as bad as they are playing but even if everything was going well we are only a .500 team. So now to even be a .500 team we have to vastly outperform.
Brewers,338pfs,dusters,5,Tue Apr 21 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"yes, very early.  They arent as bad as they are playing now, but they arent good enough (at least on paper) to be a contender.  so its not a ""worry"" type situation, but the team needs to start planning that rebuild, because it only gets worse in following years."

Brewers,338pfs,adamap,3,Mon Apr 20 16:39:37 2015 UTC,Yeah a shitty start is one thing. A shitty start in a 20+ game divisional stretch is putting an early nail in the coffin.

Brewers,338pfs,Phoenix_95SP,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is that the guys who have any sort of star potential are years away. They have a few guys who project to be average/slightly above average who are playing at AA but likely won't be ready for the major leagues until 2016 season, and then they face likely growing pains for a year or two."

Brewers,338pfs,ShakeyBobWillis,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"My worries are more about the future of the team.  This year we (I) knew they'd suck hard (Garza and Lohse are over the hill, sorry folks it's true).  Now with Gomez and Lucroy injured we're basically securing the fact that we're not making the playoffs.  Yes, I understand there are 162 games in a season, but what have you seen from them this year that makes you think we'll pull together?  So, come trade deadline, I wouldn't mind seeing us clean house and go into rebuilding mode.  We need to focus on talented young pitching.  Bringing in vets at this point is just a waste of our money."

Brewers,339v6a,necropaw,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:07:43 2015 UTC,"I know Siggy can bunt for a hit, but it just doesn't seem like the thing to get things going."

Brewers,339kug,GMGrim,2,Mon Apr 20 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"MLB is going to shut you down as soon as you come up on their radar. They don't like when unauthorized people gif their games. It's a dumb thing, but MLB isn't exactly forward-thinking with stuff like this."
Brewers,339kug,buckyubadger,2,Mon Apr 20 19:12:38 2015 UTC,"This is what happened with that Pitcher gifs site, too."
Brewers,339kug,smiles134,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"https://twitter.com/MLBgifs and http://drawntomlb.com/  So are these legitimate MLB sites? We assumed, by their quality, that they weren't. We very well could have been mistaken."
Brewers,339kug,buckyubadger,2,Mon Apr 20 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"They claim to be ""The official Tumblr of Major League Baseball"" and are being followed on Twitter by MLB's official profile, so I would assume so. The size constraints on Tumblr are probably what makes them look so cruddy."
Brewers,339kug,KEM10,2,Mon Apr 20 19:31:40 2015 UTC,Take this  It was exactly a week ago and the bottom of the 9th at the card's opener.
Brewers,33b91j,gingerperson,2,Tue Apr 21 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"Craig Bigio's kid, Caven, is looking like a top infield pick."
Brewers,33b91j,silentjay01,2,Tue Apr 21 10:40:14 2015 UTC,I think Riley Pint is the consensus #1 pick for 2016 but he might go to college.
Brewers,33b91j,ZacPack,3,Tue Apr 21 11:55:34 2015 UTC,That last name would have way too much irony to come true
Brewers,339o3y,workthrowaway68,5,Mon Apr 20 19:30:53 2015 UTC,I would sell Gomez 5 minutes ago for Pompey and Sanchez.
Brewers,339o3y,drunkenmunky519,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:54:50 2015 UTC,Honestly in 2016 Gomez probably will not be a Brewer. If thing are still looking like they do now come All Star time they might as well see what they can get for him. Wouldn't hurt to build the farm system back up if we can.
Brewers,339o3y,MurDoct,2,Mon Apr 20 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"completely agree  Its soooo early still but contention is probably a pipe dream and a rebuild is going to have to take place, and you cant drastically improve the farm system without dealing Gomez AND lucroy."
Brewers,339o3y,madman86,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Too early to tell. A CF could get hurt on a team that is in, or on the fringe of contention. So long as they give up the right prospects, I think he is gone (again, assuming we are also out of contention)."

Brewers,335pv7,dabarn,6,Sun Apr 19 20:37:16 2015 UTC,"All I'm gonna say is that I had bacon cheddar bratburgers in the parking lot and we won, whereas we lost when I didn't have any. Otherwise..."

Brewers,335pv7,smiles134,37,Sun Apr 19 22:06:02 2015 UTC,Could be worse. We could be 1-11 or 0-12.

Brewers,335pv7,madman86,7,Sun Apr 19 21:49:51 2015 UTC,At least it will be a low stress season.  No point to ever get our hopes up and get let down.
Brewers,335pv7,Valleyoan,7,Sun Apr 19 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"At this point they should be paying the fans to attend the games. I am going on Wednesday, not really looking forward to it which is sad because I usually love going. But at this point it isn't enjoyable to watch and there seems to be no urgency to fix the problems."
Brewers,335pv7,smiles134,22,Sun Apr 19 20:59:19 2015 UTC,Fire RR. Fire Doug Melvin. Trade ARAM. Trade Garza. Trade Lohse. Trade Carlos Gomez. Trade Ryan Braun.   I'll just keep saying it till it happens.

Brewers,335pv7,wonderbrett,11,Sun Apr 19 20:51:56 2015 UTC,lets literally just use our AAA team. Just to see how they would compare.

Brewers,335pv7,Valleyoan,-1,Sun Apr 19 22:18:05 2015 UTC,Put it towards free concessions!!
Brewers,335pv7,dannomac21,5,Sun Apr 19 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"Those guys will all be on the block if we come into the AS break 20 games back.  We're not only the worst team in the league, but we also have one of the worst farm systems out there less than a decade after we had one of the best."
Brewers,335pv7,nutty15,2,Mon Apr 20 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"I think our farm system is middle of the pack. Those prospect lists don't mean a damn thing in the real world. They're rarely a translation in to big league wins. Usually when they are, it's the super obvious late ones like Mike Trout or a top 10 guy. There's a lot of busts in that top 100 list and a lot of obvious ML ready talent.  And usually around 25+ guys in the top 100 have already played in the majors. So prospect rankers have them all high on their list, and then their team automatically gets a boost to their farm rankings, even though those guys shouldn't even be considered part of the farm any more.    Also, Lucroy was never on a top 100 list and he was setting records."

Brewers,335pv7,BucksIn6ix,4,Sun Apr 19 20:27:45 2015 UTC,Same here.   It's the car crash I know is coming but I can't not watch.

Brewers,335pv7,BucksIn6ix,3,Sun Apr 19 20:35:52 2015 UTC,Postgame show has Tim Allen ranting at FSW for not caring enough about the Brewers.
Brewers,335pv7,CJL13,2,Sun Apr 19 21:28:37 2015 UTC,What can he expect? The Brewers are 2-10 and the Bucks are in the middle of the playoffs
Brewers,335pv7,CJL13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:36:12 2015 UTC,From what it sounded like he bashed them for praising the other teams.

I heard him say ""might as well be Fox Sports Pittsburgh"" and I had to stop listening, but I'm not sure what he was complaining about.  I don't watch FS Wisconsin's post game coverage much."
Brewers,335pv7,CJL13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't either but I have seen a couple from the Bucks and it's always really biased so I'm surprised."

Hit amazing against good pitchers and hit good against everyone else while Nelson and Willy and whoever pitchers we have left hold off the other team. ??? Profit!"

Brewers,335pv7,TheBause,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"I remember Joe Block saying, ""this group isn't worried about losing. They expect to snap out of this and win.""  My question is, how do you not start to worry about this losing streak and the inability to score runs? Like I understand the people that say, ""it's baseball they'll come around... still ~170 games left."" I just think you can't expect to snap out of this, it's something you have to go out and do. Nothing is given in sports, let alone in baseball."
Brewers,335pv7,ZacPack,4,Sun Apr 19 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"Inability to not score runs.   Yea, I wish."
Brewers,335pv7,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"I mean last year by the time you actually saw comments about how they really needed to snap out of the funk at the end, it was already too late. Roenicke was saying there was still a shot when we were behind like 5 games with 12 to play.  It's like they are just in denial. The first step to fixing your problems is admitting to them, which this team doesn't seem to want to do."
Brewers,335pv7,Beginnerwithnoluck,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:10:33 2015 UTC,Like I'm watching the games and seeing all these errors and poor hitting. Nothing has changed since last year. It's like a continuation from where we left off.

Brewers,335pv7,silentjay01,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:18:04 2015 UTC,Ryan Braun deserves a lot of the blame. I'm not sure if he's just a average player without PEDS because I don't know of any other excuse he has. He Hasn't stepped up one bit and is stealing money from this organization. I feel like he doesn't care about how he does. he only cares about when he get paid.
Brewers,335pv7,roastbeefandcoffee,5,Sun Apr 19 23:11:28 2015 UTC,He's one of 25 players. And only one. Our pitchers getting carved up has nothing to do with a right fielder. Braun hitting below average has nothing to do with the other 8 hitting even belowerer (that's a new word).
Brewers,335pv7,Hosko817,2,Mon Apr 20 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"but he's the former MVP. he's the one with a big contract til 2020. he's the one we have high expectations for. the rest of them are just as bad, yes, but Braun's basically the face of the franchise.  The biggest problem I have with this team all playing really bad, is there is nobody on this team to really root for. we have no hero. it was braun, and now it's not."
Brewers,335pv7,Shade_SST,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:44:57 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he's the only one to blame. Every single person is to blame but He's the one we paid the big money to. He needs to step up and get this offense going and get back to his mvp form. If it wasn't the peds that made him a mvp then he needs to show it. His thumb is not a excuse any more. All im saying is since he got busted for peds he's been a no show for the most part. It's beginning to seem like he just scammed the organization and fans out of there money.
Brewers,335pv7,The_Courier,2,Mon Apr 20 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, piss off. No one player is at fault for how we're playing"
Brewers,335pv7,roastbeefandcoffee,0,Mon Apr 20 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"When did I say it was all his fault? I said he deserves a lot of the blame but so does Roenicke and a lot of other players but he's the face of the franchise and is getting paid to big money. he needs to be the one to step up since it seems no one else is because he's the former mvp, he's the one who took the big contract and cheated and lied to everybody and so far I haven't seen him produce much post peds and he doesn't have a excuse now. Its still early in the season so a lot could change."

Brewers,334mwa,madman86,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"Baby steps! Baby step to two runs, baby step to three runs, baby step to a WIN!"
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,4,Sun Apr 19 18:21:00 2015 UTC,So there are 21 players in the league with as many or more homeruns than the Brewers combined...
Brewers,334mwa,Cobruh,2,Sun Apr 19 18:40:22 2015 UTC,I can't imagine them not finding their power eventually. That's one of the few things that has me still hopeful for this season.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:41:03 2015 UTC,their power   I'd be surprised if we have a player hit more than 20.
Brewers,334mwa,Cobruh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"Bleh, i dunno.  We dont have one power star anymore.  Its not like 3-4 years ago when we had multiple guys over 30.  Last year i dont think anyone broke that number."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, but my main point is that this is a serious drought. They have to do better than this eventually. Even getting a whiff of the long ball can make a hell of a difference."
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,4,Sun Apr 19 18:50:33 2015 UTC,HIS MOM TOOK HIM TO THE DOCTOR AND HE'S MAGICALLY BETTER GUYS!!!
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 19 18:40:59 2015 UTC,Amen brother
Brewers,334mwa,eray21,4,Sun Apr 19 18:41:28 2015 UTC,Silver lining: THAT play by Luis Jimi.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, ill take it."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 19 17:39:20 2015 UTC,That looked inside.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 17:45:52 2015 UTC,That was a rough at bat.
Brewers,334mwa,PatchesDaHamstr,3,Sun Apr 19 17:47:19 2015 UTC,*Sigh* Fuck.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 17:47:12 2015 UTC,It's official: we blow.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 19 17:53:06 2015 UTC,Of course. Now I'm just waiting for Garza to bean McCutchen to really get this dumb-fuckery going.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 17:53:10 2015 UTC,Anyone know if theres lingerie football on today?
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 19 17:55:13 2015 UTC,Well this has started about as horribly as possible.
Brewers,334mwa,Kobe_AYEEEEE,3,Sun Apr 19 17:55:42 2015 UTC,Thank god. That could've been ugly
Brewers,334mwa,SocksandSmocks,3,Sun Apr 19 18:05:16 2015 UTC,It already is! We're down by TWO. I don't know how our offense can overcome that.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 18:06:43 2015 UTC,Look at us scoring two runs. Love it
Brewers,334mwa,SocksandSmocks,2,Sun Apr 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's the only way I knew we scored!  Gameday still has Segura batting."
Brewers,334mwa,wiener_cleaner,3,Sun Apr 19 18:19:13 2015 UTC,How is this game tied?
Brewers,334mwa,jn2010,8,Sun Apr 19 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"They scored two, but then we came back and scored two as well. Then, they almost scored just now, but we stopped them!"
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 18:32:36 2015 UTC,Smart ass.
Brewers,334mwa,jn2010,2,Sun Apr 19 18:35:57 2015 UTC,I probably missed a few details in there. Just trying to help!
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 18:38:55 2015 UTC,Garza got us out of a jam???
Brewers,334mwa,PatchesDaHamstr,3,Sun Apr 19 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/4hYKrzC   wow, thanks Count Garza!  (My hyper linking skills are non existent.)"
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,3,Sun Apr 19 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"Hit a fucking homer, Lind. Let's get this shit rocking."
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 18:34:23 2015 UTC,Dammit. Now we need more than three runs.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,3,Sun Apr 19 18:45:55 2015 UTC,LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUC
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 19 19:08:04 2015 UTC,I want the Brewers to win today.
Brewers,334mwa,wiener_cleaner,3,Sun Apr 19 19:12:52 2015 UTC,Fuck this.  Hope he's okay.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 19 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"Fuckin' hell, man. I know everyone is on Garza's ass, but he had a few innings of decent pitching after a rough start there."
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 19:32:57 2015 UTC,I like Khris' patience. A whole bunch.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"Bases juiced. LET'S DO THIS, PARRA!"
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 17:45:36 2015 UTC,gas can garza is imploding early today.
Brewers,334mwa,drosebrokemyheart,2,Sun Apr 19 17:52:20 2015 UTC,God I hate garza
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 17:53:54 2015 UTC,draftkingsdraftkingsdraftkings everything Draft Kings
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,2,Sun Apr 19 18:06:43 2015 UTC,Wooooo... Now garza gets to do nothing with the bat.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:10:16 2015 UTC,He could bunt Scoots in. I hope.  Edit: Or the infield is in. NVM.
Brewers,334mwa,PatchesDaHamstr,2,Sun Apr 19 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"Watch out boys, we got something going!"
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,2,Sun Apr 19 18:10:21 2015 UTC,COME ON LUCINATOR
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 18:12:55 2015 UTC,ItsSomething.jpg
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"Im not sure i'd rather have Lucroy get the hit there, or the Pirates get an error so their defense doesnt look so good."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 18:16:08 2015 UTC,This doesn't change the fact that garza is still our pitcher...
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 18:17:01 2015 UTC,Shhh.  Let us believe for the next 2 minutes.
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,2,Sun Apr 19 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Seg-error.
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 18:27:38 2015 UTC,Yaaaaay
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 18:29:13 2015 UTC,Rock called the shit out of that!
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Alright offense.  Its been a rough couple of weeks, but right here is where you bust out and skullfuck Cole."
Brewers,334mwa,The_Courier,2,Sun Apr 19 18:34:13 2015 UTC,Delayed calls <3
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 18:37:45 2015 UTC,Fuck.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,8,Sun Apr 19 18:46:00 2015 UTC,The Cardinals.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 19 18:50:54 2015 UTC,/thread
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 18:51:59 2015 UTC,I liked how they zoomed into the cow as Matt and Rock were silent.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, big inning here."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 19:02:44 2015 UTC,Feels like the camera guy was trying to show us the crap that was on Cole's pants where he seems to wipe his hand. #conspiracy
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,3,Sun Apr 19 19:23:09 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out why we were seeing his crotch.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 19:24:32 2015 UTC,What a play by Luis.
Brewers,334mwa,drosebrokemyheart,4,Sun Apr 19 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"It won't happen. Just the nature of some fans. I'm pretty tired of it.  I really, badly want Braun to get back to his dominant ways. I think he has it in him, PED crap be damned."
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,2,Sun Apr 19 17:41:46 2015 UTC,I'm honestly just impressed at how bad Garza is. Truly.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,2,Sun Apr 19 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"So I used to like the Pirates, but as they've gotten more successful they're fan base has gotten a tad annoying. Anyone else feel this way?"
Brewers,334mwa,adam7765,2,Sun Apr 19 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"I think that happens a lot. Up-and-coming team finds their stride and people start to enjoy them as the underdog. Then they stay that way for another season or two and people are over it (and especially start to hate the ""bandwagoners"")."
Brewers,334mwa,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:52:25 2015 UTC,yep.
Brewers,334mwa,adam7765,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"Not watching any games until some kind of sustainable wins happen. It's for my own good. However, if the offense gets into a roll, I think they are going to win a lot of games and can maybe crawl back."
Brewers,334mwa,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:54:03 2015 UTC,I tried that last season during what I thought was just a slump...:(
Brewers,334mwa,adam7765,2,Sun Apr 19 15:19:45 2015 UTC,Last year they had only maybe 25 games to get things back in gear. This year they have 151.
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 19 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. There's still time, but this opening has been a real bummer. Hopefully the rest of the central can tank while we rise."
Brewers,334mwa,2menshaving,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:18:59 2015 UTC,Heh
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"I guess im a glutton for punishment, because im watching this shitshow again."
Brewers,334mwa,2menshaving,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe we can get a win? I really don't like Cole. Partially still from the fight thing with Gomez, but mostly just because he's really good."
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 17:17:48 2015 UTC,I swear the Pirates have about the most punchable players in the league.  Snider and Locke being two of the biggest.
Brewers,334mwa,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"McCutchen though I like. I dislike him because he's really good, but still like him."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:36:59 2015 UTC,we are the best team in the mlb

Brewers,334mwa,PatchesDaHamstr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:59:06 2015 UTC,I just finished watching The Room and I'm really confused. Anybody see that movie? Was it supposed to be bad on purpose?
Brewers,334mwa,madman86,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:59:38 2015 UTC,yes. its a comedy
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:59:54 2015 UTC,I hope so.
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:02:18 2015 UTC,Estrada will be pitching now for the Blue Jays in case anyone cares.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:11:39 2015 UTC,Garza needs a map and compass to find the fucking strike zone.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:02:07 2015 UTC,Garza is being paid way too much.
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"Scoots! Hey, that puts him on base and nobody is out!"
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,2,Sun Apr 19 18:03:29 2015 UTC,ELI5: is that legal?  Shouldn't Clint Hurdle put the game under protest?
Brewers,334mwa,Eddie_Truckin_Lacy,2,Sun Apr 19 18:08:04 2015 UTC,IT HAPPENED AGAIN I HOPE WE DON'T GET CAUGHT
Brewers,334mwa,fpg_crimson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I just got really bummed out while trying to dig up that Garza gif. Waded through some of last year's game threads... I want our spark back. We had something."

Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm surprised that wasn't called a strike, based on how the ump's called it so far."
Brewers,334mwa,wiener_cleaner,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:12:01 2015 UTC,Hey hey!
Brewers,334mwa,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, ill take it!"

Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:14:58 2015 UTC,Game day is having a hell of a time keeping up.  Segura currently has a 2-5 count.

Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:15:19 2015 UTC,Luc's reached on two errors today. Huh.

Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Even if we're in the midst of two weeks of nonstop play, we could still have an above-.500 April."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:23:08 2015 UTC,Did he walk the pitcher?  I guess its not all bad.  Guy has to be on the bases instead of in the dugout with his towel.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:24:09 2015 UTC,Just kill me now.
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Meh, not even a terrible pitch.  I cant even complain too much there."
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:25:40 2015 UTC,Ballsack. Let's get this next out. That'd be a good place to start.
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"I just flipped over to the race for a few seconds to see if the rain had stopped.    They were doing a stand up to cancer thing where all the pit crews and everyone had the little signs where you write in a name, and they all wrote in ""Steve"" for Steve Byrnes.    Right in the feels, man."
Brewers,334mwa,eray21,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"See, Pirates? Doesn't feel good when you strand the bases loaded, right?"
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:30:36 2015 UTC,Funny Rock is talking about the Woodchucks.  I was actually looking at the schedule and planning on going to a couple of games this summer since its only about 15 miles out of the way on my way home from work.
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:31:45 2015 UTC,Ugh. This Cole guy is really getting on my nerves with these strikeouts. What's his deal?
Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:35:06 2015 UTC,That ump wouldnt even appeal?
Brewers,334mwa,jn2010,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:38:14 2015 UTC,Ya i didn't even think it was close at first that he didn't swing. I really wish their were more replays on stuff like that.
Brewers,334mwa,eray21,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:40:13 2015 UTC,At least Garza ran it halfway to first before tossing it.
Brewers,334mwa,CJL13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:44:49 2015 UTC,"Daaaayumn, Garza."
Brewers,334mwa,wiener_cleaner,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Nice.  I fully expected Garza to throw one to the upper deck, but nice."
Brewers,334mwa,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:43:41 2015 UTC,Garza didn't fuck up a throw to first!  Maybe we are turning it around.
Brewers,334mwa,smiles134,3,Sun Apr 19 18:43:51 2015 UTC,Annnndddddddd a home run.
Brewers,334mwa,The_Courier,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:43:55 2015 UTC,Wasn't a two run home run!

Brewers,334mwa,fly1ngorb,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, that was a nice catch. Couple of guys with really good effort defensively tonight in Parra and Jimi. Siggy cleans up the errors in particular and that part of the team is less concerning."
Brewers,334mwa,indiemike,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:01:38 2015 UTC,God damn this is a hard season yo watch so far. Oh well.

Brewers,3333jt,SolidRambo,8,Sun Apr 19 02:07:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess the best thing out of all of this is when we eventually get rolling (because we will) it'll feel that much better.  We are not a 2-9 team. Everybody is just collectively in the shitter at the same time. Are we a playoff team? no. Not at this point, but we are not the worst team in the league, things will get better. This month may just be fugly."

Brewers,3333jt,Valleyoan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"Ok other than trading Gomez, I'm all for the rest of that. Especially the first two. Those guys are long overdue for getting fired."
Brewers,3333jt,cheezturds,2,Sun Apr 19 06:34:22 2015 UTC,Gomez is the most valuable trading chip on the team and wants a $200 million contract in 2016. You better get used to the idea of Gomez playing baseball in a different city.
Brewers,3333jt,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sun Apr 19 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm not exactly FOR trading Gomez, but if we're not going to contend and not going to offer him max-contract upon his free agency.. we might as well try and get something for him now."
Brewers,3333jt,Valleyoan,2,Sun Apr 19 21:08:25 2015 UTC,"Well I'd agree it's better than letting him walk away. I just hate that every time we get talent like this we can't retain any of them. I'm not saying lock up every good player we get, but at least a couple."
Brewers,3333jt,cheezturds,2,Sun Apr 19 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yea I know what you mean.  I always point to the Oakland A's when it comes to retaining star players. Because they never sign big contracts. Yet always find ways to games in October.   And one thing they for sure don't do is sign old mediocre pitchers to big contracts. The argument could be made that Kazmir was just that, but he's not that old and he's actually been pretty damn good.   Whereas Lohse and Garza are just a couple jalopies."
Brewers,3333jt,Valleyoan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"Even the Orioles remind me of that. I mean this year they're about $15M more than Milwaukee, but they're usually around the same and seem to get good value out of their players and are able to keep them. It's irritating that every time we get nice things we know it's going away soon and we start all over again."
Brewers,3333jt,cheezturds,2,Sun Apr 19 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"So here's something I was thinking about that with Oakland again..    They're constantly moving guys up from their farm, and have a great track record of arms from their farm. Ok yes we know that, but if you look deeper into what that does for the organization, it's HUGE.     Allows you to have a much cheaper roster. There's A LOT of guys earning league  minimum doing way better than Lohse and Garza and their 8-digit salary. 8 DIGITS!?! You'd think they'd be throwing a shut-out every other game with that kind of salary. At least more quality starts..  Gets more fans more involved, more fans = more money. (People follow minor leaguers, some more so than big leaguers, when they see a guy go through their teams farm to the top they love him even more)   Makes the front-office and all minor-league coaching staffs look genius. Suddenly so many guys we've drafted and coached for the past 2-7 years are making it to the bigs? Wow, we must know what we're doing! Right?  Gives you the sellers-market stance for trades. This is the biggest one to me because right now we're on the outside looking in. We are gonna be trying to sell mediocre play at a high price. But a team like Oakland always has these players for relatively cheap, and are able to get a big return because other teams believe they are getting a great deal. It creates a constant influx of decent ML ready guys...and wins.      Brewers have a track record of very few guys making it to the bigs recently. I think that's due in large part to the terrible moves being made to spend money on rusty vets, suppressing the farm talent.     A lot of people can and will argue that it's because a lot of them just aren't ready for the bigs. But I think that's part of the defeatist brewer attitude.     Move more guys up more often. If they can't hack it, then so be it, at least they got a shot, and now we know for sure. Whereas if we keep em down then we'll never know."
Brewers,3333jt,Valleyoan,2,Mon Apr 20 03:00:11 2015 UTC,I really hope if we're not competitve by the trade deadline we trade some people and tank this season so we could get a good draft pick. my worst fear is to keep going 500 and being mediocre.
Brewers,3333jt,ZacPack,4,Sun Apr 19 02:21:34 2015 UTC,Shades of Herb Kohl's Bucks...
Brewers,3333jt,ZacPack,3,Sun Apr 19 02:24:26 2015 UTC,That's my fear.
Brewers,3333jt,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Sun Apr 19 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"Why are you all sad? I'm fucking pumped, man. We're one game closer to a rebuild."
Brewers,3333jt,phoenix9797,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:15:14 2015 UTC,Because rebuilding is not as easy as everyone here wants to pretend it is.
Brewers,3333jt,dusters,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, but keeping a mediocre team intact and competing with it is even harder."
Brewers,3333jt,roastbeefandcoffee,0,Sun Apr 19 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"With Carlos Gomez and Jonathan Lucroy on the roster, a brief rebuild lasting only a couple of years is a viable option if you're willing to trade both players. Both Gomez and Lucroy could fetch a couple of very nice AA pitching prospects and some decent positional players."
Brewers,3333jt,phoenix9797,3,Sun Apr 19 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't work that way.  Without solid drafting, rebuilding is exceedingly difficult.  For example, look at the Greinke trade.  That is somewhat similar to what we'd get for Gomez; at least it is in the ballpark, since both don't have much team control left at the time of trade.  And essentially we got Segura (assuming, almost 3 years later, that Pena and Hellweg aren't going to amount to much).  So trading Gomez for essentially one big league piece would not put us much further ahead in the scheme of things.  Impeccable drafting is how you quickly restock a farm system and ""rebuild"".  And unfortunately the Brewers have dropped off the table in that area since Jack Z. left."
Brewers,3333jt,Valleyoan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:10:09 2015 UTC,Pena is going to end up being a decent relief pitcher in the bigs. Maybe for us if we stop signing old guys instead of moving up our own prospects.
Brewers,3333jt,phoenix9797,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:49:15 2015 UTC,Well he better hurry up if that is the case: he already turns 26 in May.

Brewers,3333jt,BucksIn6ix,3,Sun Apr 19 05:20:11 2015 UTC,They don't. The guy was probably referring to the biased commentary tonight in favor of the Bulls.
Brewers,3333jt,Gritsandgravy1,2,Sun Apr 19 05:40:48 2015 UTC,"It was awful, at halftime when they showed highlights of the game they showed something like 6 plays from the bulls and 1 from the bucks. All they could talk about was Derrick Rose too. I get that there's going to be bias but it was do blatant."
Brewers,331i44,phoenix9797,14,Sat Apr 18 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah no... I'm all for being calm, but this team looks awful. In every way"
Brewers,331i44,zmichalo,3,Sat Apr 18 23:47:21 2015 UTC,I love you
Brewers,331i44,adam7765,2,Sat Apr 18 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, man. It looks much better when you put it that way. Hell, I'd be optimistic yet if we were 4.5 out with 25 games left to play! It's a long season yet.  that being said, nothing about this team right now tells me they are going to turn it around anytime soon.  Then again... it's baseball. It only takes one game for things to start firing. If Wily can pitch a nice shutout and go deep in the game, and the guys can hit a couple homers, get some confidence back, this team could go on a hot streak in no time."
Brewers,331i44,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Apr 20 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  If we're being realistic here, Lucroy is not going to hit .167 with no home runs, Braun is not going to .237 with no home runs, Ramirez is not going to hit .140 with no home runs, etc., etc., etc.  These guys--the whole team--are going to return to productivity.  Even if the season-long productivity for the entire team dips a little bit from each guy's seasonal standards, we're going to probably recover to near .500 before the season ends.  So it might not mean ""playoffs,"" but at least we'll have fun watching a team go 8 games over .500 the rest of the way."
Brewers,331i44,BennyBXB,4,Mon Apr 20 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"Ugh, Yanks fans are like this too. Everyone panics after 10 games. ""SELL EVERYONE STOCK THE FARM."" We're literally less than 10% of the way through, we know basically nothing about what will happen this year. Some people need to unbunch their panties."
Brewers,331i44,BeHereNow91,4,Sat Apr 18 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen panic on our sub.  I've seen recognition that this team isn't very improved from last year and that we're continuing what we started last season (after that great start).  Our offense was flat all last season, and that's how we've started this year.    It's not panic.  It's just looking at the situation realistically.  If we make the playoffs, I'll be pleasantly surprised."
Brewers,331i44,WimpyDeer,2,Sun Apr 19 00:54:06 2015 UTC,I mean I can understand a Yankee fan being upset after their team spends money in the offseason and then their team under performs.
Brewers,331i44,BennyBXB,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:59:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, obviously. That's been the last few years for us. But this year we have A-Rod raking, and we beat the Red Sox by 10 a few nights ago. Maybe our defense is shaky, but there's a lot of promise. I chalk it up to early-season jitters. Call me in June and we can talk about underachievement. It's the same deal with Milwaukee and quite a few other teams right now."

Brewers,331i44,FuckYourHype,2,Sat Apr 18 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Obviously no one wants to start off poorly, but the football mentality (where losing a few games is a season-breaker) just doesn't fit in baseball.  Certainly teams that start poorly are less likely to succeed, but at the same time there are exceedingly few teams that navigate a season without at least one 2-8 or 3-7 stretch at some point."
Brewers,331i44,letsgobrewcrew7,-1,Sat Apr 18 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck can't we discuss rebuilding? We need a fucking rebuild. I'll take discussing a rebuild over false hope and people preaching about not giving up and ""GO CREW LOL 152 GAMES LEFT WOOOO"".  The Milwaukee Brewers are shit. We have some nice players but not enough to win a championship or even make the playoffs.   IF YOU DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH TALENT TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?! WHAT'S THE POINT?  Trade Gomez and Lucroy and stock the farm. Want to see what happens when you rebuild and stock the farm with great prospects? Go look at the Cubs right now; they're going to be legitimately competitive for a decade and will probably win a World Series or two in the process. Milwaukee? We're fucked."

Brewers,331i44,gobrewcrew,7,Sat Apr 18 20:02:43 2015 UTC,Not really sure what you're getting at here. The Brewers had a top farm system in the mid 2000s and from 2008-2011 that turned into two playoff appearances and being two games from the World Series. The Brewers are at the end of that run now and it's time to go back to building a young core that can make another run a few years down the road. It's how all small/mid market teams compete. Build young talent through the draft/trades and when the prospects are ready you can add through trades and free agency accordingly.

Brewers,32zny0,Redtitwhore,3,Sat Apr 18 02:16:36 2015 UTC,I bet Attanasio is regretting not making a change last year.
Brewers,32zny0,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:05:06 2015 UTC,A change for what? Manager? Roenicke isn't giving up runs or swinging at dogshit out of the zone.
Brewers,32zny0,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,13,Sat Apr 18 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"They just look like absolute garbage though -- unprepared, unpolished, undisciplined.  Since September this club hasn't even looked like it's trying.  You can tell by the way they're playing that the culture of the team is not healthy, and I think it's fair to blame the manager for that."
Brewers,32zny0,Beginnerwithnoluck,5,Sat Apr 18 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with everything you said. I wasn't a huge ""Fire Ron"" person until pretty much now.

Brewers,32zny0,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:56:45 2015 UTC,A good team made the Brewers competitive. Yost was an emotional manager who could be baited into stupid decisions.
Brewers,32zny0,MurDoct,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:21:28 2015 UTC,ya id say things are working out for him pretty well in his current situation
Brewers,32zny0,PeteyB53,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"When he was let go I had no issue with it, but, hindsight is 20/20, he got us to the competitive point, he had a few things I didn't like that he did, but overall compared to our last managers he's no doubt better."
Brewers,32zny0,Redtitwhore,2,Sat Apr 18 09:14:06 2015 UTC,I don't know but I know he considered it. Nothing has changed from last year including the slide to oblivion.
Brewers,32zny0,Jake_Maple,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"No, you're right, Roenicke is amazing manager, such passion on a nightly basis.  Let's give him an extension."
Brewers,32zny0,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"No need, buddy; Attanasio extended him by a year during spring training."
Brewers,32zny0,Jake_Maple,0,Sat Apr 18 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"When it comes to baseball, Attanasio is just as big of a bum as Roenicke."
Brewers,32zny0,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Sat Apr 18 04:52:12 2015 UTC,Like having a $100 million payroll despite being the smallest market in baseball? You'll want to keep Attanasio in Milwaukee.
Brewers,32zny0,Jake_Maple,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:12:07 2015 UTC,"$100 million payroll to what avail?  Last season was one the single most pathetic things I've ever seen, and I've been watching the Brewers since the Trebelhorn years.  This season isn't getting better no matter what cliche bullshit people keep telling themselves.    Roenicke is an aloof, uninspiring man and has no business leading anyone.  I would rather lose with hot head manager that had the undying loyalty of his players.  A manager that lost because the team they were playing was better, not because of a complete lack of effort and fundamentals.  Fuck Roenicke, he sucks and he needs to be gone yesterday."
Brewers,32zny0,jackmeriusIII,0,Sat Apr 18 05:15:55 2015 UTC,A change in anything. We were a .500 team last year. We changed almost nothing yet fans were led to believe results would be different. And I guess they will be different. As in much worse. At some point you gotta have the balls to bkow it up and start over or else you become the bucks from 2003-2013.
Brewers,32zny0,ZacPack,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:50:34 2015 UTC,Last year a bad slump cost us a playoff birth and the same thing is happening so far this year. We need a manager that will get fired up and actually say something and give this team a wake up call. Listen to his post game press conferences. He sounds like a little league manager.
Brewers,32zny0,gobrewcrew,2,Sat Apr 18 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"It wasn't even a bad slump. Sure the end of the season sucked, but we played mediocre baseball from June onward. The only reason we had the division lead for so long was because the Pirates and Cards spent a good part of the summer bumblefucking around while we kept the seat warm for 'em. April and May last year carried us until we ran completely out of gas."
Brewers,32zny0,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:50:02 2015 UTC,Why would they change anything based on a slow start if we can expect .500 again?
Brewers,32zny0,Bomrman,3,Sat Apr 18 04:37:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand why our offense is so bad. I know we obtained a new hitting coach in the offseason. Is it his fault that the players swing at the completely wrong times. I'm really mad at this team right now. Braun and Broxton are gonna be the elephants that stomp this team into the ground.
Brewers,32zny0,roastbeefandcoffee,5,Sat Apr 18 18:23:46 2015 UTC,Anyone else ready for a rebuild? I'm tired of waiting for the fanbase to come around.
Brewers,32zny0,punnypuffin,2,Sat Apr 18 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Lucroy and Gomez should have plenty of value on the trade market given their contracts.  With the number of free agents we have after the season, we'll either need to spend a lot to stay competitive or get value while we can."
Brewers,32zny0,CookieMonsterFL,6,Sat Apr 18 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think you need to keep one, at least from some form of a rebuilding perspective. But I honestly wouldn't be sad to see any of them go, which in a way is odd for me to say. I think this is the most unattached i've ever been to a Milwaukee Brewers roster."
Brewers,32zny0,PeteyB53,5,Sat Apr 18 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"You'd keep Luc, no way we afford gomez next year with Boras being his agent."
Brewers,32zny0,punnypuffin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:32:35 2015 UTC,"Well, we'll have to keep Braun and (probably) Garza because those contracts might be harder to move.  So there would be some continuity.    I don't feel too attached to this roster because (a) it hasn't done much, and (b) it's got a lot of players that weren't ""homegrown"" (and a lot of those that were aren't very good).  Lucroy is homegrown and good, so people want to keep him, but he's probably got the most value (to the right partner)."
Brewers,32zny0,PeteyB53,2,Sat Apr 18 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"No way you trade Luc, Gomez and everyone else? Sure. Luc tho you need to keep"
Brewers,32zny0,punnypuffin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"Lucroy has a friendly contract with an option through 2017.  The issue is his age (29), as most catchers don't age well.  We'll have to keep Braun and Garza, so there will be some continuity, for whatever that's worth.    The bigger issue is whether the Brewers can develop prospects.  They've never had too much success with pitching and Keith Law mentioned hearing things about them forcing the same swing on all hitters, which sounds odd."
Brewers,32zny0,PigFarmington,0,Sat Apr 18 03:55:04 2015 UTC,Lucroy to WtSox. Done deal.
Brewers,32zny0,gobrewcrew,0,Sat Apr 18 13:28:46 2015 UTC,"Amen. Tear it down to the ground, no half-measures, which is what I'm really afraid of with this FO. We don't have the cash or talent to actually compete anymore (not that we really have lately), but they might just try to hang in there a few more seasons for the sake of keeping the fans happy."
Brewers,32zny0,MurDoct,2,Sat Apr 18 13:57:15 2015 UTC,when does football start again?
Brewers,32zny0,necropaw,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:35:10 2015 UTC,Ive actually watched arena football a couple times in the last couple weeks...
Brewers,32zny0,DoAStunt,2,Sat Apr 18 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"If your starting pitchers can't go more than 5 innings, you're gonna have a bad time.   I think they've only gone 6 or more innings 3 times so far.  That's rough.   Bull pen will be shot by the end of June.    I didn't think the Brewers we're going to the playoffs but now I don't think they can get to .500."
Brewers,32zny0,CookieMonsterFL,2,Sat Apr 18 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a lot of us worried it would happen. Mediocrity is seldom wished, but I think this year we need to understand where as a team we are. If by the end of May we are still at the pit of MLB irrelevance, then for the sake of the fan base we need to see some changes.  I want to be able to go to Miller Park and see a good game with good fans. I just hope that with the stinging disappointment of last September lingering over this ball club still, it may be a long season for Miller Park attendance numbers. Hopefully i'm wrong."
Brewers,32zny0,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Sat Apr 18 02:20:07 2015 UTC,2-8 and they have been completely embarrassing most of the time and we shouldn't worry? I think we are certainly allowed to worry.

Brewers,32zny0,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"Just rebuild it. A team built to hit and score does neither, and it obviously won't change much. Todays game is pitcher dominant. Rebuilding seems to be the clear answer at this point."

I don't have much at the moment, but I have this TV, and you're on it.

On the way back to Indiana, I picked up a sampler of New Glarus. It has the delicious spotted cow, but what do yall think about moon man, road slush and two women?"
Brewers,32yl6j,bobosaurs2,3,Fri Apr 17 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Moon man is absolutely one of my favorite beers.  Its not a west coast IPA which is actually a good thing imo.  Has a certain lightness (not cloyingly malty), and mid rage bitterness instead of being crazy bitter.    The hop flavor/aroma though....its sublime.    Im actually not a fan of Spotted Cow.  Its a cream ale, and tastes like it.  Im not a fan of corn flavor in my beer."
Brewers,32yl6j,necropaw,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"Moon man keeps getting rave reviews, can't wait to try it. My dad is coming out next week, we'll have to get into it. I had a spotted cow with my dinner up there and already had another back home as a shower beer. I'd suggest trying it as a shower beer to anyone, the creaminess is perfect for the shower!"
Brewers,32yl6j,bobosaurs2,2,Fri Apr 17 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every beer ive had has been tried in the shower as well.  I dunno, i just dont like that flavor.  Cream ales in general arent something i like."

Brewers,32yl6j,MurDoct,2,Sat Apr 18 01:00:16 2015 UTC,Their Back 40 Bock and Octoberfest beers are wonderful. I don't really like MM or TW. Never had Road Slush so I can't really say. I'm glad you had fun at Miller Park. It still arguable the best ballpark in MLB. The only thing that annoys me is how loud it can be (they play some sort of music or jingle in between every action).
Brewers,32yl6j,madman86,2,Fri Apr 17 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like I'll just have to go back up when those two are on sale! I love trying different craft beers, and Wisconsin has a ton of good ones.   The only annoying thing about the park was they kept the roof closed, until after we all left :( All I wanted to see was the mustachioed man go down the slide (which I did, when Carlos Gomez destroyed Sadler's pitch) and the roof open. I'd definitely go back though, everyone was so friendly.   The only problem is your Park doesn't have a river. How can you have baseball if you don't hit the ball into the river!"
Brewers,32yl6j,bobosaurs2,2,Fri Apr 17 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"There is a river nearby, but it'd take quite a blast to get one in.  Glad you had fun. :)  Spotted Cow is yum, but it's at least an order of magnitude better if it's on tap (IMO of course). Most NG beers I've had have been pretty good though."
Brewers,32yl6j,prof_shine,2,Fri Apr 17 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"If you can find 'Totally Naked', it's a really good clean lager. Very tasty"
Brewers,32yl6j,umphreak2x2,2,Fri Apr 17 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"I like Moon Man, as it's one of the better pale ales you'll find. I honestly didn't care for Two Women, although I only had it once and that was close to 4 years ago at this point so I'll have to give it another go. Never actually had Road Slush.  Honestly my favorite beer they make is probably their Dancing Man Hefeweizen. It's very strong for a hefe and they didn't sacrifice taste for a higher abv, either. Tasty and sessionable (though not -too- sessionable until you wanna be lit up)."
Brewers,32yl6j,SolidRambo,2,Fri Apr 17 21:06:18 2015 UTC,Oh I love hefeweizens. All you guys telling me about the other options makes me sad I don't live up there full time haha. Thanks!

Brewers,32yl6j,SolidRambo,2,Fri Apr 17 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we don't have the cheese and brats to go along with it! Zombie Dust is amazing though. Shit I don't even really like IPAs, and zombie dust is in my top ten.  3Fs Gumballhead is also really good, probably my favorite of theirs.   But where I'm really lucky is that I live within walking distance of one of Lafayette's brewpubs. I can leave my apartment and be back with a  full growler in ten minutes. I'm never moving."

Brewers,32yl6j,GeekResponsibly,2,Fri Apr 17 23:18:54 2015 UTC,Road Slush is one of my favorite New Glarus beers and it is their late winter seasonal stout. Moon Man is a hoppy American Pale Ale and Two Women is a nice crisp lager.  I would also suggest their Serendipity lambic and Staghorn Oktoberfest.

Brewers,32yl6j,ccruner13,2,Sat Apr 18 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"i've said it before and i'll say it again - we're just not aggressive enough at the plate. brewers are hitting .231 on first pitches, dead last in the nl. braves are hitting .483, pirates .419, dodgers .405, cubs .400, four more nl teams are above .300. stop watching first pitches right down the middle and getting behind in the count."
Brewers,32yl6j,ehrenj,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are completely meaningless without the number of balls put in play. The average just tells us the success, not how aggressive they've been."
Brewers,32yl6j,dutchoven21,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"i think the numbers speak for themselves but maybe i can provide the numbers you're talking about. in 300 at bats leading into this game we've put the ball in play just 26 times on first pitches (compared to say the mets who have 51 first pitch balls in play in 327 at bats). in those 26 at bats we're hitting .231. the fact that other teams are hitting .100 or .200 points higher to me suggests we're not doing as good a job as any other team in the league at looking for good first pitches to hit, and then we fall behind in the count and we're hitting just .230 when behind in the count. the fact that we're hitting nearly identically (.231 vs .230) on first pitches and behind in the count while just about every other team hits far higher on first pitches i'd say proves my point. still, if this were paying off in other ways, such as homeruns deeper in the count (we're last in the league in hrs, with 18 PLAYERS having as many or more as our team) or walks (we're 13th in the nl in walks), then i could understand that approach, but it's not. i'm saying i'd like to see us going up there looking for a hit, not working the count - which isn't working for this team."
Brewers,32yl6j,ehrenj,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"That .231 average could just as easily come in 26 ABs (which, as you said, is the real number) as it could in 52 ABs. The average doesn't speak for how often they put the 1st pitch in play, just how successful they've been when they do it.   That's all I meant, because I actually agree with you. The way the offense is going right now they definitely need to be more aggressive early in the count."
Brewers,32yl6j,dutchoven21,2,Sat Apr 18 02:31:39 2015 UTC,Khris is hitting well because of the red bat; he used a red bat a lot last year and hit over 20 homers.

Brewers,32x611,adam7765,14,Fri Apr 17 13:33:08 2015 UTC,"9 games isn't enough to call it a lost season, but it's enough to get me close to falling off the wagon.  Call me a fair-weather fan, but this team just isn't enjoyable to watch right now.  The big offense is gone.  The personality is gone.    I really wasn't a big Brewers baseball fan until around 2006-2007.  What brought me in were the big hitters like Hardy, Braun, and Fielder, and the fan appreciation of guys like Craig Counsell.  8 years later, and the only guy left is Braun, and his fall from grace was enough to get me out of his camp.  Gomez is a great player, but I don't think he's a star.  There's just no one on this team to really get behind.  I mean, are we ever going to see another guy like Fielder come through our system?  Maybe it's all just nostalgia.  I'll still go to the occasional game, and I'll still tune in each night, but I feel like my passion for this team just isn't there, and I'm not sure the players' passion is even there."
Brewers,32x611,BeHereNow91,3,Fri Apr 17 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. However, for me, I don't think the personality is totally gone. I enjoy seeing guys like Gomez, Lucroy, and Scooter and getting to know their personalities on and off the field. They're unique in their styles and in their interactions with other players. Sure they are not the all-stars like Hardy, Braun, and Fielder, but I feel like they are charismatic enough to be able to get behind. I'm not so much on the Braun bandwagon anymore. He kind of bores me personality-wise and no longer has that clutch-factor that made watching him so exciting. Plus the drama and all that kind of hinders him from being like a team hero.  Other than that, though, you hit the nail on the head. Really not any fire or all-star personalities in this team and it doesn't have the same lovable antics of past years."
Brewers,32x611,TurboShorts,8,Fri Apr 17 17:53:24 2015 UTC,I was pessimistic before we lost Gomez...
Brewers,32x611,BaseballGuyCAA,4,Fri Apr 17 15:30:23 2015 UTC,"I give us better odds of losing 100 than hitting the .500 mark, personally.  Team got comfy with the cushion that last April and May afforded us and consequently shat the bed in the late summer. That alone says a lot about the culture of the team.   Combined with a FO that's left the cupboard dry due to vain attempts at remaining competitive and ownership that refused to make any real changes and we're left with a pretty mediocre, melancholy team. They expect to be pretty shit and that's what we'll end up with. Shit."
Brewers,32x611,gobrewcrew,3,Sat Apr 18 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"9 games in and everyone thinks the match has been thrown into the dumpster. Take a breath, wait and see. If this goes till june, theres problems then."
Brewers,32x611,Brewtown,2,Fri Apr 17 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"The combination of the end of last season and the start of this season does not sit well with a lot of people.   I don't think it will be this bad the entire season. If it is, RR and many of our players will be gone before the break (or just after it). Hell the players maybe gone even if it isn't this bad (depending upon how the rest of the league shapes up).   I'm not as optimistic about this season as I was. The division is looking really strong, and I honestly don't see us making the playoffs (or really even being close). Our pitching and offense is far too inconsistent.   I think we'll be in rebuilding mode before this year is out."
Brewers,32x611,madman86,2,Fri Apr 17 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan as far back as I can remember. Over 25 years of listening to the Uecker calling games and going to County stadium back in the day. I'm a dedicated fan, but I'm also realistic. The Brewers are the most mediocre team in baseball. They're not terrible, but they aren't great. They have some season where they are pretty good and some season where they are pretty bad, but overall are just a solid small-market baseball team.  This season just exemplifies that for me. I'll still go to 5 - 10 games this year, but I may not be as enthusiastic this year as in the previous ones. I still have hope they will turn it around and finish 3rd in the division, but I'm not particularly optimistic about it."

Brewers,32x611,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Just about how I feel. Not going to give up on Milwaukee baseball, but I certainly don't have any great expectations, which is really the safe way to be when it comes to this team."
Brewers,32x611,gobrewcrew,2,Sat Apr 18 04:48:29 2015 UTC,I didn't have optimism for the team this year so I'm basically just getting a little worse than I was expecting anyway. And it's a long season. Hard to get worked up so early even though they've looked awful.
Brewers,32x611,ShakeyBobWillis,2,Fri Apr 17 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"The Brewers are fully capable of being a .500 ball club all season but its like the collapse from last year carried over into this season. They need to make a new music video or something to get going.   I try to keep in mind thats out of 162 games to play, only 9 are in the books. It just feels like the spark that was there last year is gone."
Brewers,32x611,MurDoct,2,Sat Apr 18 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"Right now, you're seeing an ""overworked"" Brewers club. The pressure from us fans, management, and ownership is all contributing to this slow start. Everyone feels the breath on the back of their neck. So what happens with added internal pressure? You see guys taking bad approaches at the plate, pitchers missing their spots due to bad pitching situations, etc. Look at last year, pitching is what kept us in most of our games early in the season. We had the same offensive struggles last year. This year, the pitching has caught up to us. Now we lose close games, rather than win them. All it takes to get out of this funk is a player who doesn't feel this ""pressure"". Someone off the bench usually helps, because they want a chance to shine. Once the bench starts performing, the regular starters feel less on the chopping block, and take better approaches at the plate. And pitching has run support, freeing up some bad-count situations to allow a mistake or two. By the middle of May, I think the Crew will be right back in the thick of the central. 9 out of 162 (5 percent) isn't enough to say yes or no."
Brewers,32x611,b-VW,6,Fri Apr 17 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"The pressure from us fans, management, and ownership is all contributing to this slow start.    I don't think this is a legitimate reason, especially so early in the year.  Good players perform better under pressure.  I think this is just a flat roster and a management problem.  We look like we're still in spring training games."
Brewers,32x611,BeHereNow91,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"I said it last year and I'll say it again. The Brewers do not have any clutch hitters. Khris Davis could be, but he isn't. Same with Braun and the other 2 stars (Gomez and Lucroy)."
Brewers,32x611,Nadie_AZ,2,Sat Apr 18 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"While I didn't believe the Brewers would make the playoffs, people need to chill out.   I think people are so used to football and see 2-7 or 3-10 and think they're the worst team in the league."

Brewers,32x611,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"well, its not going to stay this bad of course, but man...its still frustrating to see just how cold this team is."
Brewers,32x611,necropaw,4,Fri Apr 17 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the batting averages so far. Even if Braun, Luc, Rami, Scooter, et. al. have taken steps back from last year, there's no way they continue to be this unproductive all year. Things will get better. This is mostly the same team as last year, arguably with upgrades at 1B, outfield depth, and possibly even SP (depending on how Jimmy and Fiers do). No guarantee that we'll be contenders, but this is not a 100-loss team. I don't think."
Brewers,32x611,prof_shine,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"Nine games obviously isn't enough to predict a whole season on, and baseball is a game of streaks, but I don't think you really ever want to start a season five games below .500. This team is just ice cold right now."
Brewers,32x611,smiles134,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"9 games isn't enough, but it's certainly not comforting. I think by mid-late May we'll have a good idea of where this 2015 team is headed this year. I believe it was 2013 where they started off playing like total dogshit, starting off 2-8, but then won 9 in a row to improve to 11-8 (sure that season wound up being forgettable and awful, but you get my point <_<).  I think a lot of us still have a bad baseball hangover from fucking destroying Kershaw, Greinke and Haren in Los Angeles and having a 99% likelihood of going to the playoffs in August, to completely self-destructing. So starting off like this is opening an old and very painful wound."
Brewers,32x611,SolidRambo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it all comes down to pitching.  Before the season started I thought our rotation would be mediocre at best, and they're proving me right.  Fiers and Peralta will be our saving graces this year, if anything.  Garza and Lohse are on the decline.    For anyone saying ""hey we're mediocre because we're a small market team and will never get over the hump, etc. etc.."" is fooling themselves.  We were 16th in salary last year, ahead of the Cubs, Pirates, Rockies and Royals.  The Rockies, Cubs, and Royals are playing great this year, and the Pirates are playing so-so, but they're beating us consistently.  So... that's not the issue.  I think we just get players who are past their prime and we overpay them.  Usually pitchers.  Here's a hint, if St Louis is trading with us, odds are we're getting a bad deal and they're getting a great younger player from our side.    EDIT - 2015 salary ranking we're 20th.  Cubs and Royals are in front of us now, but Pittsburgh and Colorado are still behind us, and the Rockies are on a tear thus far."
Brewers,32x611,P-Munny,2,Fri Apr 17 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"I think we just get players who are past their prime and we overpay them. Usually pitchers   We haven't been able to breed an elite Ace #1 level pitcher in a while. Yo didn't get there, he was our ""ace"" that was a #2 quality if you want to be honest. Peralta has the potential to be an ace and I hope he does, Jimmy Nelson is supposed to replace Yo so maybe he'll be a solid #2 maybe #1 quality.  Every successful team breeds pitching, or can go out and grab a young pitcher. We don't seem to do either and it's an issue."
Brewers,32x611,PeteyB53,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Anyone who thinks we're a 100 loss team is foolish, even with all my frustration hovering around .500 ball is doable for this team no problem. If we get hot I honestly believe we'll be up there competing in the division, but we have to get hot and stay hot for a while. We can't afford to get ice cold like we tend to.  I think a lot of people's frustration is just after all that ""we have unfinished business"" hype video shit we just sort of pick up where we did last year, and in the worst way. I know that's why I'm frustrated right now, as the bullpen is the only part of the team pulling its weight. As a team we're probably not an early season team, and should definitely see it start picking up.  edit: There's no way the team bats .229 and has a SP era of 4.88 the whole year.  I feel like our SP rotation will have era's looking something like this  Lohse - mid 4 - high 4 era (I honestly don't have much hope for him so far and think he'll be our worst starter)  Garza - mid-high 3 ERA  Peralta - mid 3 range possibly low 3, I think he'll be our best starter and possibly develop into our ace  Fiers - anywhere from mid 3 to low 4 era, dude has moments of dominance but hasn't shown consistency yet.  Nelson - Low 4? I haven't seen enough from him yet, if he can deal like he did against the pirates dude will be in the 3's for sure imo."

Brewers,32v8u4,madman86,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:54:25 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is this may be the worst. We don't know yet. Yes, every game counts but it we had started 7-2 this wouldn't seems as bad. Of course right now it doesn't feel like we will get 5 wins in our next 9 to even get to 7 wins yet alone 7-2. But maybe they will surprise us! Please..."
Brewers,32v8u4,squizzlewix,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say right on the effect, wrong on the situation.  It'd be more like your team struggled to get 3 first downs and scored a field goal on the way to a 42-3 rout in week 1. Losing on week 1 happens all the time. Losing badly happened to us. Think Packers vs. Bears @ Lambeau last year except we're the Bears."

Brewers,32uiu9,cookster123,3,Thu Apr 16 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"I'll give you an upvote. Was watching a stream yesterday and the commentators relayed an anecdote: Before the game RR asked Davis if it was okay for him(RR) to start Parra in left because he has a better history against Lynn. All respect to Jackie Robinson Day, but a manager should not be asking a player for permission to make the lineup. Wanted RR after last year's collapse, still want him gone. I thought Melvin was all right until he depleted the starting pitching depth and resigned K-rod to a surprisingly large contract. Maybe there is a long term plan. What do I know? Here's hoping the Crew turns it around. The city will need something good going on when the block gets hot."

Brewers,32ujvj,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:08:20 2015 UTC,For real - this could be a 100 loss team.
Brewers,32ujvj,prof_shine,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:09:45 2015 UTC,Something drastic would have to happen for that reality.  Such as one of the starting pitchers having a major injury.  The problem is that they are just average.  That's it.    One bad thing though and the fire sale has to start.
Brewers,32ujvj,Hosko817,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:01:55 2015 UTC,I agree - we have had to stock up a good starting pitching in the minors for some time. The fact that our AAA team is in Colorado Springs doesn't help that though - and it won't help young pitchers egos either.
Brewers,32ujvj,not_like_this_,7,Fri Apr 17 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"This is mostly the same team as last year. I refuse to believe that our hitters are going to continue to be this bad all season. Depth is a concern, but no more so than it was last year. If Carlos is out for more than a couple games, that will hurt, a lot. But Parra should be able to fill in all right.  Let's wait a few more weeks, eh?"
Brewers,32ujvj,Cobruh,2,Thu Apr 16 21:25:04 2015 UTC,I guarantee you that Gomez is out a month

They did pretty much nothing in the offseason to improve aside from Adam Lind who appears to be the only one ready to show up to work on any given day. They're playing the same way they played at the end of last sesaon, lifeless.   By the end of May we're going to be buried at the bottom of the standings with the way our schedule looks."

Brewers,32tfno,TweetPoster,2,Thu Apr 16 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Super unfortunate. However, I'll be optimistic.  I remember Logan Schafer having a hot start last year before he remembered he was Logan Schafer.  Maybe he'll get the start and give us a week or two of a decent bat while Gomez rests."

Brewers,32tfno,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:02:00 2015 UTC,That also works.  I was under the impression Parra won his gold glove primarily because of his cannon-arm.  I also didn't know he could play CF.
Brewers,32tfno,phoenix9797,2,Thu Apr 16 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think if we're looking for optimism, it could be this: if Segura actually performs at leadoff in Gomez's absence, we'd be free to slot Gomez in a little lower in the lineup for RBI opportunities.  Mixing him in at, say, 5 and sliding Lind or Ramirez to 6 would really make the lineup potent."

Brewers,32t5sf,BrewCrewKevin,2,Thu Apr 16 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"What's to fix? The team just needs to hit the ball. It's pretty simple. Hitting below .230 as a team is horrible, and it's even being propped up by Segura and Lind. Play better. That's about it."
Brewers,32t5sf,dutchoven21,2,Thu Apr 16 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"8 errors (4 by Segura granted) a .229 average, Team ERA of 4.38, SP ERA of 4.88, granted SP ERA is ballooned by Lohse being awful, although saved slightly by Nelson not giving up any runs in his start.  It's more then just the hitting, our Bullpen's the only one pulling their weight right now."

Even more so when you hear ""there wasn't a hotter team coming out of spring training then the Brewers.""

Brewers,32t5sf,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:26:59 2015 UTC,And Fiers leads off next inning.  Not ideal.
Brewers,32t5sf,berjiff,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:50:48 2015 UTC,SHIT ON IT
Brewers,32t5sf,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:50:53 2015 UTC,My emergency plan is to keep sitting here and wait for the Brewer game to come back.
Brewers,32t5sf,smiles134,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's go Braun"

Brewers,32t5sf,ccruner13,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:46:13 2015 UTC,At his point it doesn't even matter how well the starters pitch...can't win games if you don't score any runs.  That is 3 shutouts already.
Brewers,32t5sf,smiles134,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:49:34 2015 UTC,Fuck me
Brewers,32t5sf,zinger565,2,Thu Apr 16 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well, at least there was an out?"
Brewers,32t5sf,gandaalf,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:41:50 2015 UTC,Just got back from class. Looks like I didn't miss a whole lot...
Brewers,32rrxo,Freemont777,10,Thu Apr 16 04:41:33 2015 UTC,Brewers' baseball in a nutshell.
Brewers,32rrxo,machiavellism,7,Thu Apr 16 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, so we'll see you in two to three weeks, Gomez."
Brewers,32rrxo,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:26:01 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking throughout the entire article.
Brewers,32rrxo,TakeOffYaHoser,4,Thu Apr 16 11:43:11 2015 UTC,If they go with Logan over Parra they've lost it.
Brewers,32rrxo,CJL13,2,Thu Apr 16 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"If they go with Logan over parra, isn't that the equivalent of Melvin and RR yelling to MA ""what they fuck we gotta do to get fired!??!?!?!"""
Brewers,32rrxo,_DG_-,0,Thu Apr 16 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"You know they're going to, because we're the Brewers. The same team that sent Schafer out with 1 out and the bases loaded instead of Parra or Hector Gomez."
Brewers,32qagq,BrewersBot,10,Wed Apr 15 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"Braun's reaction was pretty good....  ""the fuck are you guys waving about...?"""
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,8,Thu Apr 16 01:12:28 2015 UTC,"Despite that hit, Scooter is swinging the bat like Stevie Wonder this season."
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,7,Thu Apr 16 01:19:15 2015 UTC,Let's get that series win boys!
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,6,Wed Apr 15 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy, but i think Braun does look more like he did a few years ago.  He hasnt squared up quite right yet, but his approach just looks loads better.  That swing also looks a lot like it did a few years ago.  His swing definitely looks pretty unique (or at least not the same as most big league hitters)"
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 01:43:38 2015 UTC,Agreed his approach is a lot better and he's not afraid to take a hack at an inside pitch. The hits will come for him and so will the power.
Brewers,32qagq,ShoopALoop11,6,Thu Apr 16 01:45:57 2015 UTC,Cards fans would be booing
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,5,Thu Apr 16 02:58:55 2015 UTC,Taking the first series from the Cards on the road would be so freaking nice...  Also i saw Parra is in instead of Davis tonight.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 15 21:31:56 2015 UTC,I'd like to see this more often
Brewers,32qagq,jamesbutcooler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:08:10 2015 UTC,Really? I feel Khris Davis always has strong at bats no matter where he is put in the line up.
Brewers,32qagq,eray21,5,Thu Apr 16 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"Let's get the series tonight, boys!"
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,5,Wed Apr 15 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously, fuck our team's offensive efficiency"
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,5,Thu Apr 16 02:46:14 2015 UTC,We've seen Gomez play second base and Lohse pinch run for Gomez this year.  Hahahahaha fuck
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,4,Thu Apr 16 02:59:47 2015 UTC,Hey guys it's a brewers game!!
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,2,Thu Apr 16 00:31:53 2015 UTC,good to see this gif in every game chat thread so far lol
Brewers,32qagq,TurboShorts,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:48:11 2015 UTC,Excuse me while I go cry in a corner lol
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,4,Thu Apr 16 00:51:08 2015 UTC,Peralta was an outfielder who now throws 98 as a pitcher? Wow.
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 16 00:45:02 2015 UTC,Lots of time outfielders are converts from pitching because of their cannon arm so it makes sense that the reverse would happen.
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,3,Thu Apr 16 00:46:17 2015 UTC,Same with shortstop.  Grienke was a shortstop.
Brewers,32qagq,Tuggernuts23,2,Thu Apr 16 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"One of the craziest things I saw on MLB network was a video of nelson cruz throwing a strike to home and they did a breakdown and side by side comparison of him and a pitcher (i think it was Lincecum not sure) and his throwing motion was basically the same thing, just well, outfield version. But arm position and shit was all the same, was really interesting to see."
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,4,Thu Apr 16 00:49:42 2015 UTC,God I am dumb.  They are sitting here talking about someone signing and extension and being happy in StL and I am thinking they said Lind but they said Lynn.  No wonder it didn't make any sense...
Brewers,32qagq,ccruner13,4,Thu Apr 16 01:02:54 2015 UTC,Ramirez could've caught that if he wasn't a hundred years old.
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,4,Thu Apr 16 01:31:06 2015 UTC,I picked a hell of a time to cut back on drinking.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm getting shitty. This season is off to a rocky start. Seems this is par for the course. Start hot and end shitty, or start shitty and end hot. Neither of which usually end in playoffs."
Brewers,32qagq,peezyweezy,4,Thu Apr 16 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, jesus christ."
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,4,Thu Apr 16 02:57:28 2015 UTC,Kyle Lohse is pinch running.  This is a thing.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 02:58:53 2015 UTC,The day a St. Louis scorekeeper marks a passed ball against Molina is the day I fuck Kate Upton.
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Thu Apr 16 03:02:09 2015 UTC,So what youre saying is it'd be a win-win situation?
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,8,Thu Apr 16 03:02:48 2015 UTC,Booo! Braun is a cheater! Booo!  Oh! Hey! Jhonny Peralta! Yaaaaaay!  Cunts.
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,6,Thu Apr 16 00:59:27 2015 UTC,Lind is the light of my baseball life right now.
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Thu Apr 16 01:34:23 2015 UTC,Who are your guys favorite player tonight? Mine has the be that number 42
Brewers,32qagq,eray21,3,Thu Apr 16 00:15:16 2015 UTC,He might have been safe...
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:39:02 2015 UTC,They did rule it a double!
Brewers,32qagq,Tuggernuts23,3,Thu Apr 16 00:40:07 2015 UTC,We need to take advantage of these opportunities
Brewers,32qagq,turtle_thunder,3,Thu Apr 16 01:03:02 2015 UTC,Rami!
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 16 01:04:15 2015 UTC,Good inning!
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 16 01:13:37 2015 UTC,83 pitches thru 4 innings.  Damn...
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, Carpenter almost got all of that one"
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,3,Thu Apr 16 01:36:26 2015 UTC,Did Braun just quit on that to early?  Looked like he should have gotten there if he committed.
Brewers,32qagq,xsists,3,Thu Apr 16 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, the ball hit the bottom quarter of the wall, a couple strides away... But yet again, I'm sitting on the couch watching, not playing."
Brewers,32qagq,iheardyoulikemacs,2,Thu Apr 16 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Might've misjudged it, felt the same way at first."
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,3,Thu Apr 16 01:39:50 2015 UTC,My butthole clenched when i saw that come off the bat.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"I wish we'd start winning so it'd be a little more crowded around here. I love you guys, but I hate when I don't want to post a comment because I feel like I'm posting too much. When there's more people here, no one notices lol"
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 16 02:38:59 2015 UTC,Drink moar.  You wont care about posting too much.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"420 Blazek, WTMJ 620 Blazek, etc."
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Thu Apr 16 02:39:00 2015 UTC,I was really thinking it would be our hitting that kept us in games this season with an unsure pitching staff but man.... so far I've been very wrong
Brewers,32qagq,SocksandSmocks,3,Thu Apr 16 02:42:11 2015 UTC,Brewers are down 3.  They need multiple hits.   Deep thoughts by Brian Anderson.
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,3,Thu Apr 16 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, nice play, dude!"
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,3,Thu Apr 16 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, im impressed Blazek."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 02:51:35 2015 UTC,The only way Logan was going to get on base...
Brewers,32qagq,gobrewcrew,2,Thu Apr 16 02:55:26 2015 UTC,He looked like he didn't know what to do with himself after ball 4.
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,3,Thu Apr 16 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"Boys, we just might have a shot."
Brewers,32qagq,adam7765,3,Thu Apr 16 02:55:43 2015 UTC,Fuck.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 02:57:34 2015 UTC,Oh god damnit
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,3,Thu Apr 16 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's just put a bullet in this shit and get our rebuild on."
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 16 02:58:11 2015 UTC,Please no. I wanna believe it's not that bad
Brewers,32qagq,SocksandSmocks,3,Thu Apr 16 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"first things first, ya gotta get three runs here"
Brewers,32qagq,BrianTheLady,3,Thu Apr 16 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"alright, let's get 6 2-out runs here. It's not that hard."
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,3,Thu Apr 16 03:01:18 2015 UTC,There we go. Shut that crowd up.
Brewers,32qagq,BrewCityChaser,3,Thu Apr 16 03:03:25 2015 UTC,So Lind hasnt got a hit today to extend his streak.  Destiny or destiny?
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 16 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"Eyyyy, it's not over yet!"
Brewers,32qagq,gobrewcrew,3,Thu Apr 16 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Help me Adam Lind, you're our only hope"
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,3,Thu Apr 16 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Kyle was legging that out a bit!"
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,4,Thu Apr 16 03:03:52 2015 UTC,Always love seeing a little blooper fall in (for us)
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,2,Thu Apr 16 01:04:41 2015 UTC,Fuck the Cardinals!
Brewers,32qagq,killallthejuice,2,Wed Apr 15 23:31:16 2015 UTC,Kinda sucks for Robinson that his premier day and all that is freaking tax day...
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 15 23:42:14 2015 UTC,Pine tar on his hat! Throw that fucker out! ;)
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 16 00:16:11 2015 UTC,Gomez using hat stick-em?
Brewers,32qagq,xsists,2,Thu Apr 16 00:16:58 2015 UTC,I like Parra getting the start over Davis
Brewers,32qagq,muffin_man84,2,Thu Apr 16 00:28:23 2015 UTC,"6 pitches, 3 hits, 2 runs."
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Apr 16 00:30:22 2015 UTC,This is fine
Brewers,32qagq,Redtitwhore,2,Thu Apr 16 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"Terrific replay sequence, FSW."
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Apr 16 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"bad call, but he shouldn't have taken either of those two pitches."
Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 16 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Lynn's been getting that outside corner call pretty consistently, too....which kinda sucks for us."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 00:44:33 2015 UTC,Ball
Brewers,32qagq,Redtitwhore,2,Thu Apr 16 00:43:35 2015 UTC,Gennett has been dogshit at the plate so far
Brewers,32qagq,ShoopALoop11,2,Thu Apr 16 00:43:40 2015 UTC,I mean that's pretty close with 2 strikes.... but that was a ball
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,2,Thu Apr 16 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"Dayum.  Risky, but nice."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 00:51:35 2015 UTC,Lynn is getting the calls tonight
Brewers,32qagq,Redtitwhore,2,Thu Apr 16 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"I heard a bit of booing there, but that really wasnt that much.  Also, that first pitch looked low and inside....but hes been giving that area to Lynn all damn night."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"Attaboy, Braun!"
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 01:00:08 2015 UTC,Nice catch.
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 16 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, nice catch, Ryan."
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 16 01:10:35 2015 UTC,Best part is he protected his wrist on the way down.
Brewers,32qagq,ShoopALoop11,2,Thu Apr 16 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"Look at Scooter with a single, didn't know he could hit!"
Brewers,32qagq,iheardyoulikemacs,2,Thu Apr 16 01:20:04 2015 UTC,Gah. At least we've got Lynn's pitch count up.
Brewers,32qagq,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 16 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"Ffs.  I went to throw my tuna steak in the frying pan, come back and its runners at the corner no outs..."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 01:30:03 2015 UTC,"Damn, Jay would have been out by a mile there it seemed."
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 01:33:23 2015 UTC,Coco Crisp...theres someone i havent heard about in a while.
Brewers,32qagq,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 16 01:35:49 2015 UTC,Why
Brewers,32qagq,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 16 01:36:02 2015 UTC,Fuck.
Brewers,32qagq,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Apr 16 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"Well, at least this is doable. They can come back back from 3"
Brewers,32qagq,adam7765,2,Thu Apr 16 01:38:43 2015 UTC,Can't afford to keep leaving people on base like we do...
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,5,Thu Apr 16 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"This is every game, and sadly, the main difference between us being average and good. So frustrating"
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,3,Thu Apr 16 01:44:13 2015 UTC,"I know, whenever we struggle it's always because we can't string those extra hits or even get those lucky little breaks."
Brewers,32qagq,PeteyB53,2,Thu Apr 16 01:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. In fact, in nearly cost us last game. I distinctly remember having guys on 2nd and 3rd with NO outs TWICE, and only getting 2 runs out of it.."
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,2,Thu Apr 16 01:47:21 2015 UTC,I miss having Maddux as our pitching coach
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,2,Thu Apr 16 01:52:12 2015 UTC,Sheesh. That was sketchy
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,2,Thu Apr 16 01:59:42 2015 UTC,Ahh stranding more runners. Tastes good
Brewers,32qagq,gandaalf,2,Thu Apr 16 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"Was just watching at a bar, this group of girls wouldn't stop obnoxiously asking why #42 keeps batting, like just stop....please"

Brewers,32qagq,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 16 02:58:57 2015 UTC,Kyle Lohse just took a base off a wild pitch.  Thats a thing.

I've only been there for soccer games, and it's a little loud and overwhelming for my tastes.  I'd probably watch every game at the Newport if the screens there weren't smaller than my computer monitor."

Brewers,32mgnq,BrianTheLady,3,Tue Apr 14 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"Ive put a fair amount of thought into the baseball salary cap, and im still split on it.  On one hand, going full revenue sharing and hard cap (like the NFL) would be nice for keeping smaller market teams competitive for more than a few years out of every decade, but its also nice to have the diversity between sports, and i just dont think a hard cap would work as smoothly with how baseball is set up (minors, etc).  That being said, the hard cap has really been nice for the Packers and the small market theyre in, so it could really help the Brewers, and frankly would make GMs even more valuable in MLB.  Big teams would actually have to budget instead of just outspending."
Brewers,32mgnq,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"I think at this point it would be very hard to get those big budget teams to agree on a cap like that. Where would it be? If they set the average budget as a cap, alot of teams would have to make big cuts. But if we set the cap at the highest amount a team is spending, where are those other teams going to get that money to compete? Then what's the point? Changing a system that's already so set up would be really really hard. Almost like having congress vote to limit their salaries, it just doesn't make sense when only a few of them are on board. I wish it weren't like that but thats the way I'm understanding it."
Brewers,32mgnq,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 15 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"Thats why the NFL has revenue sharing.  Pool the money, divide by the number of teams.  Im grossly oversimplifying, but thats the rough idea."
Brewers,32mgnq,Amoney8612,2,Wed Apr 15 17:31:49 2015 UTC,$271 million for the Dodgers? Holy shit.
Brewers,32mgnq,Necatorducis,2,Wed Apr 15 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"It is a tad misleading. $41M of that 271 is going to guys not on the team.  The 1% version of buying new socks instead of doing laundry, perhaps?"

Brewers,32i0lp,Mega_Sloth_,4,Mon Apr 13 23:41:29 2015 UTC,Why are they off tomorrow?
Brewers,32i0lp,KalTM,5,Mon Apr 13 23:23:12 2015 UTC,in case today got rained out.
Brewers,32i0lp,NBABUCKS1,5,Mon Apr 13 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"They allow for rescheduling of home openers the day after if it was a rain out, but since it wasn't a rain out today they get the day off tomorrow"
Brewers,32i0lp,ishkabibbles84,4,Mon Apr 13 23:25:42 2015 UTC,Neat. Thanks!
Brewers,32i0lp,KalTM,3,Mon Apr 13 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"That was one of the ugliest baseball games I've ever watched. Glad we got out of it with the win.  Garza doesn't get a QS and gets the win, Wainwright gets a QS and gets the loss."
Brewers,32i0lp,smiles134,3,Mon Apr 13 23:23:18 2015 UTC,And the win goes to Count Dracula!
Brewers,32i0lp,adam7765,2,Mon Apr 13 23:25:43 2015 UTC,Psst... it's just The Count.  One win! Ah Ah Ah.
Brewers,32i0lp,smiles134,2,Mon Apr 13 23:26:31 2015 UTC,Seriously though he looks like Dracula... Or the psycho slasher... or Kramer.
Brewers,32i0lp,adam7765,2,Mon Apr 13 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"I thought for sure we were gonna lose after Braun missed that dropper in right. Cards leave 12 on base. Remember 2 years ago when they blew away the records for bringing in RISP? Funny game, baseball."
Brewers,32i0lp,JasonYaya,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:52:55 2015 UTC,That was back when McGuire was their hitting catch. The Cards offense went west with him.
Brewers,32i0lp,unmisunderestimated,2,Tue Apr 14 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"Sweet win, but can anyone explain to me why Roenicke doesn't challenge the call in the 7th? What is there to lose?"
Brewers,32i0lp,mobala,4,Tue Apr 14 00:32:01 2015 UTC,That wouldn't be roenicke's call. Most likely the brewers replay booth thought there wasn't enough evidence so they decided not to challenge. It's not Roenicke's fault.
Brewers,32i0lp,ZacPack,2,Tue Apr 14 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"I suppose. It looked pretty close on the replay, and in the end what is there to lose? After the 7th the league office can also request replays, right?"
Brewers,32i0lp,mobala,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:50:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like ultimately it's Roenicke's call. He can listen to his advisors, but he's the manager for a reason. Either way, it was stupid not to challenge it. That runner scored and he should've been out."
Brewers,32i0lp,smiles134,2,Tue Apr 14 01:59:12 2015 UTC,Well if the replay booth tells him there's not enough there to overturn it then he would not be smart to challenge it. There's a lot of other things Roenicke has done wrong this year but I don't put that one on him. But it's all irrelevant anyways because we won.
Brewers,32i0lp,ZacPack,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"A coach that wants to win challenges that.  Orioles had a close play at 2nd today, Schoop slid face first in to 2nd on a base-hit.. in the 2nd inning.   He was called out initially and even the commentators didn't think there was substantial evidence that he was safe, but the challenge over-turned the call and the momentum swung heavily for the Orioles.  You can't afford to let momentum swing, so if you have any chance to sway it your way, you do what it takes. And more so when it costs you nothing.  There was no reason not to."
Brewers,32i0lp,Valleyoan,0,Tue Apr 14 05:21:23 2015 UTC,If they told him not to challenge there's no reason to challenge. Im sure the replay booth had a definitive angle and saw that he was out. I thought Roenicke should have been fired after last season but he shouldn't be the scapegoat for everything. We won so luckily it doesn't matter.
Brewers,32i0lp,ZacPack,2,Tue Apr 14 08:19:43 2015 UTC,They said on the radio that it looked like the umps told him not to bother because they had a clean look at it.

Brewers,32idxl,Amoney8612,2,Tue Apr 14 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"It was never a Sunday thing. I believe the starting pitcher gets to pick what uniform they go with on a particular day and I think the gold has just fallen out of favor with them. In 2013 they wore the gold in 12 games (all but one game was at home), and they went 6-6. Last year they only wore them 4 times, all at home, and went 2-2 in them."
Brewers,32idxl,skin87,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Damn we should have just gone straight to the gold unis when we had all those games over .500 last year.

Redshirt junior Houston is backing him up and redshirt freshman DJ Gillens is third on the depth chart, right now. We have a dual threat QB recruit, Kafentzis that's likely going to redshirt and true freshman recruit Alex Hornibrook who is a dark horse to beat out Stave for the starting job."
Brewers,32gmos,smiles134,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I usually don't like calling the starter this early, but Stave needs the reinforcement.  Even if he doesn't win the job, it's probably a good move to call him the starter now."

Brewers,32gmos,jn2010,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:49:00 2015 UTC,The run should be attributed to the error.  I think what he's saying is that the error only advanced Wainright to 2nd but the run scored independently of the error.

Brewers,32gmos,jn2010,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:49:15 2015 UTC,Really?  That's some shady scoring.  No way Garza should be on the hook for that ER.  The next batter flied out deep enough to score the run anyway (probably) though so it's not a big deal.

Brewers,32gmos,adam7765,2,Mon Apr 13 22:05:35 2015 UTC,At least we got the lead back
Brewers,32gmos,ccruner13,2,Mon Apr 13 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"Besides the 5 walks, Garza had a great game. Have the team a badly needed boost from the starter."
Brewers,32gmos,jn2010,3,Mon Apr 13 22:12:24 2015 UTC,You know it's rough when a 'great game' doesn't even qualify for a QS.
Brewers,32gmos,ccruner13,2,Mon Apr 13 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"Well, he was 1 out away from a quality start.  I'd say it was pretty good."

Brewers,32gmos,jn2010,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:47:48 2015 UTC,It was close.  St. Louis scorers are notorious for calling a lot of questionable plays hits.  That play in particular is probably a hit though.

Brewers,32gmos,gandaalf,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:57:35 2015 UTC,It's going to make me cry if we give up a run right now.

Brewers,32gmos,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 13 22:21:40 2015 UTC,Probably not. Pitcher spot is due up second this inning
Brewers,32gmos,dutchoven21,2,Mon Apr 13 22:23:51 2015 UTC,I think the pitcher spot is coming up.
Brewers,32gmos,BrianTheLady,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:25:01 2015 UTC,Why pinch hit for Smith if you're just going to put in Schaefer and have him drop a bunt. Couldn't Smith do that?
Brewers,32gmos,fly1ngorb,3,Mon Apr 13 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"#justroenickethings  Though I wonder how well Smith can bunt, being a relief pitcher."
Brewers,32gmos,jn2010,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same, but was wondering regardless. Oh well, we score!"
Brewers,32gmos,gandaalf,3,Mon Apr 13 22:28:49 2015 UTC,Because that's all Schaefer is good for at the plate.
Brewers,32gmos,muffin_man84,2,Mon Apr 13 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"idk, doesnt really matter, it worked out i guess, right?"

Brewers,32gmos,smiles134,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:31:26 2015 UTC,Did we just knock Wainright out of the game?
Brewers,32gmos,gobrewcrew,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:31:43 2015 UTC,That should go as a hit!  Luuuuuuuuuuuc!

Brewers,32gmos,fly1ngorb,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Lucroy into first looked pretty scary live.  Though he caught his leg on the base and then went over it."

Brewers,32fwhi,drunkenmormon,13,Mon Apr 13 13:52:50 2015 UTC,This is the move I'd be making
Brewers,32fwhi,smiles134,8,Mon Apr 13 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Lohse and Garza on the trading block for any higher rated prospect. Basically anyone on the roster is available but Luc, Peralta, and Nelson. I may be a pessimist here but I think this year is going to be a rebuilding year. We did nothing in the offseason to make us a better team."
Brewers,32fwhi,nedoma56,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"Aside from Lind, who does seem to be a good fit with us considering we needed a 1B as well as a left handed bat, but I agree with more or less everyone being moveable."
Brewers,32fwhi,motivate18,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with a rebuilding year if the FO would just admit it's a rebuilding year.  Instead, we're making mediocre moves in free agency to marginally upgrade our team.    Just start looking for better prospects and rebuild our farm system.  Keep our true core players and see what we get for the rest.  I feel like Melvin is trying too hard to live up to playoff expectations when Milwaukee knows that this team is in no shape for a playoff run, on paper.  You'll lose some attendance but I don't want to be Astros bad for a decade."
Brewers,32fwhi,BeHereNow91,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:49:11 2015 UTC,Neither Garza or Lohse are going to bring back a top rated prospect.  They both make too much money and would not give the acquiring team enough production to merit top prospects coming back.
Brewers,32fwhi,workthrowaway68,2,Tue Apr 14 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"Lohse and Garza on the trading block for any higher rated prospect.   Funniest shit I've read all week and it's only Monday.  ""Anyone want to trade a highly rated starting prospect for two over-the-hill starters who are both due over 12.5 million and 11 million respectively and currently giving out hits and runs like it's Christmas?"""
Brewers,32fwhi,AtlanticHiawatha,4,Mon Apr 13 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we're going to get Buxton or someone like that in a trade, I'm saying some teams will need an average rent a starter to put them over the top and any decent prospect would be worth it."
Brewers,32fwhi,nedoma56,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"No, I agree completely. I was telling coworkers that I thought we should tank because I'd rather have 1-2 bad years than 4-5.  I forgot about Nelson. Let's keep him too. I really like Gerardo Parra. I want to keep him just so I have some defensive highlights to check out during the year."
Brewers,32fwhi,nedoma56,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:22:21 2015 UTC,I may be too high on Nelson right now based on his one start but he showed a lot of promise. My opinion of him may change as we move towards summer. But I look at every other division team making moves in the offseason and we sat with our thumbs in our asses and didn't do anything. We can't expect this team to perform like 1st half Brewers of last year.
Brewers,32fwhi,CJL13,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:32:27 2015 UTC,I know Melvin refused to trade Nelson last year so I doubt he will now.
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"I heard a rumor that he was offered in a package for David Price but got declined, actually."
Brewers,32fwhi,brewbr8,5,Mon Apr 13 18:33:17 2015 UTC,The Rays wanted Nelson in the deal and Doug wouldn't do it.
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"I believe looking to this year as a rebuild is actually optimistic thinking. Cause IMO, the worst thing that could happen is the front office (KEEPS) thinking this teams got a chance to do something, when it doesn't. And doesn't shop all this mediocrity.   I feel good about the pieces we have on the farm, and they're cheap. Why keep buying old dudes at a high price?"
Brewers,32fwhi,nedoma56,2,Mon Apr 13 18:28:48 2015 UTC,We have 1 top 100 prospect per some reports. We need to rebuild and bolster our farm if things don't turn around quick.
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,6,Mon Apr 13 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Those prospect lists are a joke. Just as much a circle-jerk as the brewcrewball blog site lol.  It's a lot of ""I think because... age, size, single tool, single pitch"" and rarely cause of performance. Not to mention half of them are usually on the verge of being in the majors, if not already been called up before anyway. There's no real way to equate and measure guys until they're thrown in the fire.  Lucroy was never on any prospect lists, he turned out to be quite a special find. Fiers has never been rated as anything but below average, but he's already shown the ability to shine.   The Oakland A's rarely ever have anybody on the top prospects lists, and when they do, they almost always shop them one way or another, yet, they're always finding their way in to post-season games.   The farm is fine. AA and AAA teams were very dominant last year, and those guys should be rewarded with promotions, instead of always getting held down b/c the team is signing old guys for big money.   And if/when home-grown players perform it makes the organization look so much better. If the team is still in last place by the end of the month I say throw the AAA guys in to the fire. If they perform well, great, we did the right thing and it cost us less.  If they don't perform well, who cares, the guys before them weren't getting it done either and they were costing a LOT more."
Brewers,32fwhi,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Mon Apr 13 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"I would love for us to be the A's of the NL. I don't care how, I just want to see October baseball. With this sport, if you are in the postseason you have a chance. This team can't even make it there. I think we should blow it up really soon while we can still get good prospects for some of our star-ish players. Except lucroy unless we get a ton for him."
Brewers,32fwhi,Jake_Maple,0,Mon Apr 13 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"I may be a pessimist here but I think this year is going to be a rebuilding year.   You're not a pessimist, you're a realist."
Brewers,32fwhi,nedoma56,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:44:24 2015 UTC,Obviously it's early but I think people are crazy if they think this team can win a title.
Brewers,32fwhi,Jake_Maple,0,Mon Apr 13 18:49:40 2015 UTC,Agree with you 100%  I would go as far as saying winning a division title is crazy too.
Brewers,32fwhi,MurDoct,0,Mon Apr 13 19:01:31 2015 UTC,.500 ball all year would be pushing it with this team
Brewers,32fwhi,AtlanticHiawatha,8,Mon Apr 13 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"I would trade Gomez for three, maybe four AA prospects (A centerfielder and some pitchers).   Gomez wants a $200 million contract in 2017 and has Scott Boras ready to squeeze every red cent out of all prospective buyers. I would trade Carlos now to a team with money and a deep farm system when his value is high."
Brewers,32fwhi,tajwk,3,Mon Apr 13 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"I hate to see him go, but trading Gomez is our best bet at rebuilding the farm system.   I don't think he would fetch full value, but Braun could bring us in a guy or two as well."
Brewers,32fwhi,smiles134,3,Mon Apr 13 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Gomez, there's no way he's on the team after next year, so I agree."
Brewers,32fwhi,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Amen.  There's no way the Brewers will dish out a 200m 10-year contract in today's conditions. Braun is already owed quite a bit, and Luc will certainly be making more. And our young guys who will be the face of the future (scooter, segura, fiers, nelson, wily, etc.) are all going to go up significantly in the next few years. So there's no way we tie Gogo up for that long.  Agreed. Get what you can for him. 3 or 4 nice prospects."
Brewers,32fwhi,smiles134,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree with everything you've said, but I'd just like to point out that Fiers is already 29, so I don't know if you can really consider him a ""young guy"" anymore."
Brewers,32fwhi,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point. I keep forgetting that, because he's so new to the big league."
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:08:50 2015 UTC,As far as I'm concerned Scooter still needs to prove he can be more than a platoon player. If he can't keep his average above .240 he might need some time back down in aaa.
Brewers,32fwhi,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Apr 13 18:35:03 2015 UTC,Who is our backup option at 2B though? You think Hector Gomez would do much better?
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,2,Mon Apr 13 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Much better?   Not against RHP at least. Against LHP though, probably a little better.  Just saying I wouldn't exactly consider him a face of the future. He's here for now, but if Arcia keeps raking, Segura or Scooter is going to be riding pine soon.   Also; I do like what I've seen from Sardinas so far. He had a bit of a sluggish start in spring, but seems like a solid player."
Brewers,32fwhi,CJL13,5,Mon Apr 13 19:02:54 2015 UTC,Trade for some pitching.
Brewers,32fwhi,muffin_man84,5,Mon Apr 13 14:05:44 2015 UTC,Except for Lucroy and Peralta I'm listening to all offers.
Brewers,32fwhi,swiftwings88,6,Mon Apr 13 14:08:12 2015 UTC,"Shop Braun, Ramirez, Lohse, and Garza, for prospects"
Brewers,32fwhi,BeHereNow91,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"If we're not in the hunt at the break, Ramirez will be shipped off to a playoff team, if he wants.  It'll be nice to get at least something in return."
Brewers,32fwhi,necropaw,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:51:16 2015 UTC,"Do you think anyone would realistically take Braun? I've wondered that. I'd love to unload him, even if we ate some of his contract. But I don't know if anyone would take him."
Brewers,32fwhi,swiftwings88,2,Mon Apr 13 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"I think he still has more potential than hes shown this year (or last with his injury).  If were going to trade him, it'd probably make sense to keep him for a month or two.  With any luck he'll put up decent numbers (maybe not 2011, but still more valuable than hes shown the last couple years)  Im actually okay with keeping him.  He fucked up, but im still a fan."

Brewers,32fwhi,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Mon Apr 13 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"I was actually going to make a thread right before the season started asking if people would want to tank for 3-5 years to get the prospects and all to make a playoff run in half a decade, or would they rather be an 80 win team for that time, but do no rebuilding.  Im actually really split on it.  Losing for that long would really suck (especially considering its still not a guarantee'd WS appearance, much less win).  On the other hand, being perpetually mediocre sucks too....but at least i know i can turn on the TV and have a 50/50 shot at seeing a win.    If we were to tank, i think i'd be watching the Jays a lot more.  Theyre really starting to become my AL team.  Anywho, at this point im not convinced our drafting/development is good enough to tank.  Im really just not sure we can make use of all those good draft picks."
Brewers,32fwhi,necropaw,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:44:34 2015 UTC,A rebuild usually means management and FO as well. If we get the right staff our drafting and devoloping issues will disappear.
Brewers,32fwhi,Pagoon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think we have a lot of valuable assets that we could unload if we do decide to tank. Because of that, I don't think our rebuilding would have to last 3-5 years, and would more or less be around 1-3.  As for the shorter time frame, I don't know if we will be entirely ready to compete by that time, but I could definitely see Marky Mark opening the checkbook for a rental to push us over the top, if need be.  I mean, I look at the Royals, who I love dearly as they are all old Brewers, and bastions of the small market teams in baseball. And I think to myself, dang. These guys were up and coming even last year, and they made a splash and a miracle run. Yes, it is not likely that the Brewers or any team can make a run like they did. But that's why you play the game and take those risks. Unlikely, yes. Impossible, no.  So, seeing their success and turnaround in a short time, with a new and youthful roster, it really gives me hope that we could do the same. Or maybe I'm just taking crazy pills."
Brewers,32fwhi,madman86,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"Youre probably right about it taking less time.  Thats assuming we can get AA/AAA prospects, and not guys lower in the minors."
Brewers,32fwhi,motivate18,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about the lost revenue for tanking hard for 3-5 years.  It will me that advertisers will pull out, fewer upgrades to Miller Park, and less money for promotional events."
Brewers,32fwhi,smiles134,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"If we get to the All-Star break and we are still in the crapper we better be selling just about everything. I would listen to trades for anyone on our team. I don't think we give up guys like Lucroy, Willy, or Jimmy, but just about anyone else is fair game. We need to re-stock the farm system and just accept that it is going to be a few years before we can compete again. And if we don't improve a 1:5 WLR I'd be looking for a new skipper as well."
Brewers,32fwhi,ari_gold05,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but potentially moving Braun, Lohse, or Garza before or around the deadline. I realize its only 6 games in but realistically I think we expected to finish 3rd (maybe 2nd) at best.  The only untouchables are Lucroy, Peralta, Nelson and maybe Gennett."
Brewers,32fwhi,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Apr 13 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"I think Gennett would be moveable, since we have Sardinas playing in AAA right now."
Brewers,32fwhi,gandaalf,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"Wait and see where we stand at the end of this month. With the way we're playing, we could realistically be out of the picture by May 1st with all of our division games.  I wouldn't mind seeing Garza, Aramis, Braun, and Loshe being moved if we do go full rebuild, but I doubt that will happen.   Gomez won't be traded this season. It will be in the offseason, or next year's trade deadline."
Brewers,32fwhi,Valleyoan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"We can certainly try Gogo. He's going to be going for a big Scott Boras contract next year, so he'll be gone either way.  And Aramis probably isn't worth much right now either, as he's probably going to retire after this year. But I guess you could get something for him closer to the AS break when teams our going to make their end-of-the-season push.  Garza, Braun, Lohse, Lind.... all certainly on the table."
Brewers,32fwhi,sonofsohoriots,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely on board with unloading everyone aside from Wily, Jimmy and Luuc. But unlike many others, I would also never trade Braun. It would just be so...weird seeing him in another jersey"
Brewers,32fwhi,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"If I were the GM, I'd fire the head coach then get fired myself. lol  Seriously though, I'd definitely be shopping CarGomez because he's not going to be getting resigned by us, and we don't even utilize him correctly anyway. (Why's our best power hitter batting lead-off?)  Then I'd be shopping Garza and Lohse, and after they'd left I'd let every pitcher in the entire organization back-handedly slap me for ever signing them in the first place. What a waste of money.  Then I'd trade Aramis Ramirez when a contender is looking for a decent hitting 3rd-baseman.   Then I'd move up a bunch of the Colorado springs guys and let them put the exact same product on the field as the team that's there right now, but about $50 million dollars cheaper.   The influx of prospects would boost competitive morale organization wide, starting at the top, where the young guns would get their chance to test the waters full time in the show."

Do I think they are the 2011 team? No. But this isn't the time to sink the ship.  We have some young talent that is up and coming. They aren't worth tossing. I will say, however, that everyone knew that getting rid of our farm system for a run in 2011 would be a long term thing that would take time to recover.  Last year, we were a .500 team that overachieved for most of the season. Don't expect them to be playoff caliber. But they'll return to .500."

Brewers,32dcii,cookster123,3,Mon Apr 13 03:53:39 2015 UTC,Anyone else think Segura is dogging a little on defense? A lot of the hits up the middle or soft liners look like they could be reachable with a dive or jump here and there. I just see a big contrast between his effort and everyone else's.
Brewers,32dcii,c_braun,3,Sun Apr 12 23:50:10 2015 UTC,I noticed one ball he could've dove for and caught without much effort and he lazily jogged towards the ball as it flew past him.  I think he might be tired from playing winter ball.
Brewers,32dcii,roastbeefandcoffee,10,Mon Apr 13 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"I'm already seeing people talking shit about Roenicke here and on Twitter.   The best managers in baseball are worth about 2 WAR on the season. I wish people would stop blaming managers in general for wins and losses; they ultimately have very little influence over actual play on the field.  I know I'm wasting my energy, but please, can we blame the players for once? If you want someone to point a finger at, blame the fucking players pitching like shit and the guys making errors on the field."
Brewers,32dcii,roastbeefandcoffee,13,Sun Apr 12 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that managers aren't worth many wins over the course of a season. However this team just doesn't look ready for the season, and are still in spring training mode. They are making mistakes a big league team shouldn't be making.   Most of that is on the players, but it is also up to the coach to make sure the rust is off by opening day"
Brewers,32dcii,ivandragostwin,0,Sun Apr 12 21:29:56 2015 UTC,It's not Roenicke's fault the players feel the need to take the field as high schoolers. They are adults and should get themselves ready for the season as they should. Bad players pay poorly.
Brewers,32dcii,dean_peterson2,4,Sun Apr 12 21:56:15 2015 UTC,Then why are they paid so much? Their job is to make sure the team is ready to play. Clearly that hasn't happened this year. I mean if they don't do that much why not have one of the other coaches also be the manager? Statistics can't really be applied to a managers position.
Brewers,32dcii,madman86,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:08:21 2015 UTC,6 unearned runs is a pretty good indicator that the players weren't ready for the start of the season.
Brewers,32dcii,mechadrum,0,Mon Apr 13 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"The Brewers should get rid of the Roenicke AND most of the players. There isn't a single player on this team, other than Lucroy, that is worth a shit."

Brewers,32dcii,smiles134,-2,Mon Apr 13 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"I would have said the same thing the day before opening day.  The coach is an aloof, emotionless man that I have a hard time believing anyone would want him leading them into anything.  He's truly one of the shittiest coaches in a long line of shitty coaches, that I've ever seen.  He fucking sucks.  Yes, I know that he doesn't pitch, hit, and field, but he also doesn't prepare and keep his players full of piss and vinegar.    Also, if you get to tell me to ""calm down"", then I get to tell you to ""wake up"" and smell the steaming pile of shit that has been the Milwaukee Brewer franchise ever since I can remember.  Honestly, why should anyone expect any different from this team?"
Brewers,32dcii,Jake_Maple,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  If Attanasio really wants to win, he's going to have to get over his whole Canadian-circle-jerk thing and clean house, inside and out.  Firstly Doug Melvin has to go. Must. Must be gone, ASAP. He's one of the longest tenured GM's in baseball, despite not really ever winning at baseball.   Then, Ron Roenicke, and each of his relatives in the organization. At one point I feel like there was six, lol. Ron had plenty of opportunity, he never lit a fire under anyones ass. He just held a candle in his corner of the dugout.   Then every player that has ever been a Cardinal or Cub must be dished. Lohse, Garza, Aram; good-bye. Hello prospects we get for them.  Hello Jason Rogers, Taylor Jungmann, and Tyler Cravy welcome to your chance at the show."
Brewers,32dcii,Valleyoan,2,Mon Apr 13 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"This is refreshing to hear.    The Roenicke defense team on this sub is staggering.  I can't even take anything else they say seriously because it so fucking glaringly obvious that the management of this team is the root of the problem.   I have a theory.  Go get an ex player, a catcher in particular, and make him our coach.  Torre, Scioscia, Matheny..etc.  I don't know what it is about ex catcher-managers, but they seem to get their players undying loyalty and faith.    Totally agree with the ex cub/ex card players.  We are like the Vikings of the NL central and it's embarrassing.    I agree with developing talent, but I also want to see more acquisitions of proven stars.  Look at Greinke and Sabathia, they got the Brewers further than they'd been for 30 years.  Suppan, Lohse, and Garza were huge failures."

Brewers,32dcii,Nadie_AZ,7,Sun Apr 12 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"Khris Davis dropped a rather routine liner that probably would have turned into a double play, because the runner took off.  Shit hit the fan then.  Congrats on the win btw!"
Brewers,32dcii,necropaw,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:24:30 2015 UTC,And that strike that was called a ball. Next pitch? A single. Then Davis' little 'ooooops' that Parra would have had easily. Same with the earlier one he 'missed'.  Thornburg got robbed of a strike out. And then the wheels came off.
Brewers,32dcii,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 12 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that ump gave the Brewers some gift calls low in the zone, too.  There was one i saw a bit before that on foxtrax that definitely should have been a strike and wasnt called."

Brewers,32c5r2,smiles134,2,Sun Apr 12 18:34:24 2015 UTC,Red's apple ale commercials are just fucking awful
Brewers,32c5r2,necropaw,2,Sun Apr 12 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of beer commercials are loud and unsightly as of late because the mass producers are trying really hard to earn back some lost revenue to the craft sector.   The multinationals are still king and printing money, but the valuable middle income consumers who're willing to spend extra money on quality brews are spending their cash on craft and locally produced beers. It's pissing off the corporate brewers and they're fighting hard to get their share back."

I guarantee Henderson will suck when he finally makes it back.  Honestly, I don't really like relievers in general. If you think about it, relievers are guys who aren't good enough to start. By default, they're shit."

Brewers,32c5r2,localadmin,3,Sun Apr 12 17:58:09 2015 UTC,Maldonado is Lohse's preferred catcher so we can expect Lucroy to play first or take the day off every fifth day from now on!
Brewers,32c5r2,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Sun Apr 12 17:53:35 2015 UTC,So Kyle Lohse is terrible.

Brewers,32agw9,CJL13,6,Sun Apr 12 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"Segura hit the teams 2nd home run in its 5th game.  If you had told me that before the season started, i would have told you to lay off the crackpipe."

Brewers,329h2b,PeteyB53,2,Sat Apr 11 23:57:48 2015 UTC,I was skeptical of the replace yo talk but if he pitches like this good god
Brewers,329h2b,CJL13,3,Sat Apr 11 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"honestly, I never liked Yo. So inconsistent."
Brewers,329h2b,smiles134,3,Sun Apr 12 00:05:50 2015 UTC,Yea yo never had that secondary out pitch he needed his curve to be on to do anything

Brewers,329h2b,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Sun Apr 12 00:57:55 2015 UTC,Worely always looks like he's having an orgasm right before he throws.

Brewers,329fk1,indiemike,3,Sat Apr 11 19:57:17 2015 UTC,Well I don't really think it's even slightly necessary to make something like this as it was literally ONE game against lefties...maybe he'll end up hitting them decent.
Brewers,329fk1,jubjub2184,2,Sat Apr 11 21:45:49 2015 UTC,"I've been one of the few who has been critical of Scooter and received (mostly) a lot of hate because of it. I really hope he succeeds, because he is a fun player to watch and seems like a great guy, but there is really nothing it indicate that he will ever even be a decent hitter vs. LHP., and Scooter really struggled the 2nd half last year all around. I think the thing he needs to work on the most is his ability to draw walks. For a player with his skill-set, he is going to need to do a better job than drawing walks on 4.5% of his ABs if he wants to halve long term success. I was hoping he could learn a thing or two from Rickie in that department, but it just never seemed to materialize."
Brewers,329fk1,dusters,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, last season he was able to put up an above average batting average, but when you look at his OBP it was only like .025 higher. That's pretty bad, especially if they intend to sometimes have him be the leadoff hitter. He's still pretty young, so we'll see how things progress."
Brewers,329fk1,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:24:16 2015 UTC,What do you expect when your team is 0-3 and people hate you cause you can't hit left-handed pitchers.
Brewers,329fk1,CJL13,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:19:45 2015 UTC,I love this title.
Brewers,329fk1,The_Bostache,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"Obviously don't have high expectations for scooter against lefties, but he's struggling against righties too at the moment. We'll see after he (hopefully) gets it together next week in general."
Brewers,329fk1,xbaahx,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:14:34 2015 UTC,Then I guess it is good news for Scooter that LHP Liriano is on Paternity Leave Sunday and the Pirates will instead be recalling from AAA a Right Hander named Casey Sadler.
Brewers,329fk1,silentjay01,-1,Sun Apr 12 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"""In 2014 the Brewers had a good platoon going at second base with Rickie Weeks starting against left-handed pitchers and Scooter Gennett getting his time against right-handers.""  Somebody's comma key is broken..."

Adding a comma after the prepositional phrase ""In 2014"" would be fine, but leaving it out is completely fine, too.

Brewers,324goj,Wisconski,11,Fri Apr 10 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"Kyle Lohse - mostly a sinker to induce ground balls, a slider, a change up and a 4-seam fastball that tops out around 90mph, sometimes a curve ball.  Willy Peralta - a sinker, a hard 4-seam at 95mph+, a slider and a change up.  Matt Garza - a 4-seam (94mph) & slider combo, also a sinker and a curve ball. Ocassionally a change up  Mike Fiers - mostly a 4-seam (90mph) and a cutter, also a curve and a change up.  Jimmy Nelson - a sinker & slider combo, also a 4-seam (94mph) and occasionally a change up.  Those are our starters, and we have 7 relief pitchers."
Brewers,324goj,AbbaZabaMyOnlyFriend,5,Fri Apr 10 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"Just to add to your already well done list.   Lohse - Control style pitcher, won't beat you with 99 mph fastballs and nasty curves. Beats the hitter by varying speeds and location.  Peralta - Power pitcher. Uses his fastball/sinker (90 - 95 mph) to set up his strikeout slider which is his unhittable pitch, slider tops out around 90 mph going straight down (which is really fast for a slider, usually around 84 - 87 mph)  Garza - A pure power pitcher. Will throw any pitch on any count because of the quality of his stuff (pitches).   Fiers - Control/power. Fiers is weird because he doesn't have a speed of a power pitcher but he does have one of the best curveballs in baseball (typical of a power pitcher to have a nasty curve). A true 12 - 6 pitch which he can throw for strikes or in the dirt.   Nelson - Powerish pitcher. He's got the velocity to blow away hitters, but he is mainly (from last season at least) a ground ball pitcher. His sinker induces many a ground ball.   These are just my assessment of our pitchers, others may disagree."

Brewers,321gyv,necropaw,5,Thu Apr 9 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"Just looking at our schedule, and given the fact that we couldn't muster a single win against the Rockies, this could be a very, very long month."

I would take the latter, since it means they are getting better after worthless players as cast off after the trade deadline"
Brewers,321gyv,workthrowaway68,6,Fri Apr 10 21:12:13 2015 UTC,One team is coming out of the series either 1-5 or 0-6.  Scary thought--let's just hope it's the Pirates.

Brewers,320ozf,smiles134,3,Thu Apr 9 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"If the coaches think anything similar to what I think, it's simply: What's the difference in whether a closer comes in with a lead or not? His job remains the same. All he has to do is come in for one inning and not give up any runs. Obviously the stats show that there is in fact a difference, but I have no idea why that is."
Brewers,320ozf,dabarn,2,Thu Apr 9 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"You're right, there shouldn't be a difference, and this is just a sort-of surface level analysis. But the difference is documented. They know this. We have other viable options in the bullpen in situations like this. IDK why we don't use them."
Brewers,320ozf,dabarn,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"Well Broxton and Henderson are the only other guys with closer experience, right? Broxton gave up that 2-run bomb earlier in the game, and Henderson is on the DL. Plus K-Rod had pitched the day before in a non-save situation and didn't give up any runs."
Brewers,320ozf,dabarn,2,Thu Apr 9 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Smith has performed well in save situations. He should've been the one in the game when Broxton came in. Roenicke said it himself, it was better fit for a left-hander."
Brewers,320ozf,Docter_Bogs,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"Well maybe now Ron will start experimenting with other guys in this role, now that he knows K-Rod's struggles in hold situations will continue into this year"
Brewers,320ozf,dutchoven21,2,Thu Apr 9 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"His results might be worse in non-save situations (3.07 vs. 3.71 ERA) but his peripherals don't really look any different. I can't tell what his FIP is from the stats you provided, but his K/BB and HR rates actually appear to be nearly identical between save (2.83, 0.130/inning) and non-save (2.85, 0.132/inning) situations.  I'd be inclined to attribute the differences to things generally shown to be outside of a pitcher's control such as strand rate or BABIP."
Brewers,320ozf,madman86,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:08:08 2015 UTC,"I will calculate his FIP when I get out of class today. Or, if you have time, let me know what you find!"
Brewers,320ozf,dutchoven21,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing all the legwork on this! Turns out my guess of his ERA being near 5.00 wasn't too far off! With all the options we have in the pen there's no way he should be in a non-save situation this early in the season, since pretty much everyone in the bullpen is available."
Brewers,321tqz,lmnopia,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:08:26 2015 UTC,I think it's about 2 hrs before the game. I think it cuts off at 5 for a 7:10 start.

Brewers,321tqz,internetsanta,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:36:04 2015 UTC,Idk about StubHub but I've bought tickets from the Brewers website about 30 minutes before the game. I've also just walked up and got tickets.  Both of those were on weekday games though so might not work on weekends.
Brewers,320blu,jackmeriusIII,5,Thu Apr 9 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"Im thinking Braun probably didnt take BP last night, which might have been some of the issue.  That side injury might be tweaking his swing, too.  Might not have quite as much bat speed, and had trouble adjusting to that.  Thats me being optimistic...  Pen is definitely a worry.  Were thin, and i worry that with so few reliable guys to go to, were going to wear them out by mid summer.    The offense will come around, but i fear were going to see a lot of streakyness.  I also feel like we could use 1-2 more guys that can hit for average and dont get tempted to take that mammoth swing.  A couple guys going for the big swings isnt so bad, and Gogo is pretty good at buckling down after he takes the big hacks, but right now i feel like theres just too much emphasis on the long ball.  some of that is that its early in the season, and everyone wants to be the hero...but still.  And yeah, Krod is just so damn unpredictable, man.  It'd be nice to have a good closer..."
Brewers,320blu,necropaw,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:12:35 2015 UTC,The Brewers wouldn't be the Brewers if we didn't have a closer that could have a total meltdown at any moment.

Brewers,320blu,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 18:42:51 2015 UTC,It is only one series. Things look rough but they will bounce back. It's a long season and anything can happen. Braun is going to get better and so will the bullpen. Keep the faith my friend. I have season seats so I'm going to be there to witness it all. So things will turn around right?right?right?guys?
Brewers,320blu,MasterCashier,2,Thu Apr 9 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"After that big press conference after last season where they announced they would be making changes, not a lot has changed. I'm not sure who is to blame there. I personally don't think DM has done a good enough job putting together a team that can compete. This team has 3rd or 4th place written all over it.   I wanted to be optimistic going into this year, but I after the Spring Training and opening series, it is really, really hard to be."
Brewers,320blu,madman86,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of changes: Yo got traded for prospects, we traded for Adam Lind, we're letting Scooter be the everyday 2nd basemen, the bullpen was shuffled a bit, etc.  I think the main problem is that no one is sure if this team is going to be good or bad. If the team struggles, we'll probably see a few guys get dealt at the deadline (Gomez, any of our older starting pitchers, Rami, etc). A rebuild is looking imminent either way, but I think that DM and ownership want to try to contend for as long as possible."
Brewers,320blu,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:45:29 2015 UTC,You could count the roster changes on one hand with a few fingers left over. Seriously.
Brewers,320blu,crewblue,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:34:11 2015 UTC,Maybe they're emulating Rami's tendency to start the season looking like he just woke up from a nap for all of April & part of May.
Brewers,320blu,Chief_McCloud,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"Realistically, even though it's one series, I think this is closer to the team we're gonna see this year. I so think we have a really high ceiling if the guys can really get clicking, but I think this is gonna be a tough campaign"
Brewers,320blu,SocksandSmocks,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"I share your concerns as well. MLB.TV was having streaming issues last night, so I couldn't watch the game here in Chicago. BUT I think your concerns are valid and spot on. Honestly, the ONLY bright spot of the first 3 games was Adam Lind. (Peralta had a good start yesterday too). Losing 3 games in a row to a team that only 20 road games ALL of last season is not ideal.   We could be out of this quick if we don't turn this around soon."
Brewers,320blu,gopher33j,2,Thu Apr 9 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"The Rockies are a good team. They just constantly deal with injuries to Tulo and CarGo. When they're healthy, they're a lot better than last year's record states."

Basically coming into this, a few of the ""keys to the season"" looked kinda like:   Braun stays healthy and returns to form Lohse takes the reigns as Ace and steps up, rotation goes deep regularly Bullpen can consistently finish games   Right now those 3 are looking really shaky. Again, it's 3 games... but Braun looks like he may have a nagging injury, Lohse got shelled, and the Bullpen blew it last night.  We'll come around. Right guys? Right?..."
Brewers,320blu,KEM10,0,Thu Apr 9 15:55:53 2015 UTC,"Braun looks like he may have a nagging injury   Hey, he just pulled his back reaching for a catch. It's not like he has Luc's luggage break his hand.  Besides, everyone is saying that he should be back tomorrow."

This opening series has been tough.  I went to Tuesday night's game and honestly didn't enjoy it.    This Pirates series is actually going to mean quite a bit as to where we stand in this division.

I was really hoping that this opening series was going to prove me wrong.  I know it is just three games but it feels like the 2nd half of last season all over again."
Brewers,31yhxl,silentjay01,5,Thu Apr 9 04:14:19 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.  I've been worried about this season ever since it was made clear last fall that Ron would be back as manager for another year.

Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,5,Thu Apr 9 00:46:06 2015 UTC,LEAD ALERT... WARNING! WE HAVE A LEAD
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,4,Thu Apr 9 01:05:01 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT IM FUCKING PUMPED!!!
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,6,Thu Apr 9 01:06:16 2015 UTC,I think Adam Lind likes Miller Park.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,5,Thu Apr 9 01:06:24 2015 UTC,Yep.  Lindsanity.  Full credit to /u/thexn for that one
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,5,Thu Apr 9 01:08:41 2015 UTC,That's the kind of clusterfuck play I expect from us.  Nice to see it go the other way for a change.
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,6,Thu Apr 9 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"""Brewers are high on Blazek.""   Ok BA. I see you."
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,5,Thu Apr 9 01:37:45 2015 UTC,Luc just doesn't seem comfortable at the plate yet.
Brewers,31x53c,Bullwine85,4,Thu Apr 9 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"They should get him a robe and a recliner, if that helps."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 01:42:54 2015 UTC,Maybe it'll help him to R-E-L-A-X
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,2,Thu Apr 9 01:44:21 2015 UTC,Maybe a nice hot towel too.
Brewers,31x53c,cmassick114,4,Thu Apr 9 01:46:17 2015 UTC,What.  The. Fuck.  How is that guy not the closer?  That was ridiculous.
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 02:37:25 2015 UTC,It's Hawkins last year. He will be our closer next year for sure
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome, by the way!"
Brewers,31x53c,pfelon,5,Thu Apr 9 02:44:41 2015 UTC,Those guys behind home are heckling so hard lol
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,4,Thu Apr 9 03:14:29 2015 UTC,A closer really shouldn't give up so many damn fly balls.  I don't think this K-Rod home run problem is going away anytime soon.
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,4,Thu Apr 9 03:14:50 2015 UTC,K-Rod's ERA in non-save situations as a Brewer has to be near 5.00.
Brewers,31x53c,MadDingersYo,4,Thu Apr 9 03:15:08 2015 UTC,"God, I had no idea about Axford's son. That's terrifying, hope they recover well."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,4,Thu Apr 9 03:23:15 2015 UTC,That sidebar pic is sick as fuck.
Brewers,31x53c,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Wed Apr 8 22:55:57 2015 UTC,lol. Brewers are resorting to interesting tactics
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,4,Thu Apr 9 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"Good job, Wily."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,4,Thu Apr 9 00:37:09 2015 UTC,Woooooo
Brewers,31x53c,ccruner13,2,Thu Apr 9 01:04:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit Wily, that was awesome lol"
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,5,Thu Apr 9 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Wily.   See, this game is much more fun."
Brewers,31x53c,BrewCityChaser,5,Thu Apr 9 01:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well, that was the first inning I have missed, so, see you next year I guess?  Good luck everyone."
Brewers,31x53c,OPisacigar,3,Thu Apr 9 01:10:01 2015 UTC,DEFENSE!
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:10:12 2015 UTC,3 plays worth of it to end the inning. Good stuff.
Brewers,31x53c,wiener_cleaner,5,Thu Apr 9 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"That was awesome, just don't break your fingers."
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"Let's get a ""Parra"" runners!"
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:15:20 2015 UTC,Thats some fine wordplay
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,4,Thu Apr 9 01:18:22 2015 UTC,If only it worked. Maybe I'll try to curse the Rockies with bad puns.
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:19:20 2015 UTC,Over 60 pitches for their pitcher in 4 innings.
Brewers,31x53c,b-VW,3,Thu Apr 9 01:20:40 2015 UTC,Meh.  15 pitches per inning is par.
Brewers,31x53c,skin87,2,Thu Apr 9 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"That, or slightly under. Given these last two days, I'll take it."
Brewers,31x53c,Tuggernuts23,4,Thu Apr 9 01:24:11 2015 UTC,Offense and defense!?!? Keep it going Crew!!!
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,4,Thu Apr 9 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"Good job, defense"
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,5,Thu Apr 9 01:30:34 2015 UTC,That was an incredible pickle.
Brewers,31x53c,skin87,3,Thu Apr 9 01:31:00 2015 UTC,Niceee.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,4,Thu Apr 9 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"Ow ow ow ow ow.  Holy shit Davis, that was impressive!"
Brewers,31x53c,twothreethecount,4,Thu Apr 9 01:46:45 2015 UTC,wooooooooow
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,5,Thu Apr 9 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"Jesus, Khris took a shot there.  Hell of a catch though."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,4,Thu Apr 9 01:46:56 2015 UTC,KRASH DAVIS!
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,5,Thu Apr 9 01:48:09 2015 UTC,So how long until Lind hits one off the scoreboard?
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,2,Thu Apr 9 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"Its time for rally caps, boys."
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,5,Thu Apr 9 02:28:15 2015 UTC,I think the guy behind home is drunk.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 02:55:40 2015 UTC,Dude acts like that foul hit him lol
Brewers,31x53c,fly1ngorb,2,Thu Apr 9 02:55:41 2015 UTC,MAGIC INTENSIFIES
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,6,Thu Apr 9 02:57:25 2015 UTC,I love this sport so fucking much.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,5,Thu Apr 9 02:59:29 2015 UTC,TURNED IT ON JUST IN TIME.  FUCK YEAH.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,3,Thu Apr 9 02:59:49 2015 UTC,Damn. You know who we've got in the bottom of the 10th.  Motha  Fuckin'  Lindsanity.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"I had the dumpster fire ready for the sidebar in another tab.  Just had to hit save.  You know what?  Even if we cant pull this off its still not warranted after that 9th.  Hell of a job battling back.  Plus were going to win, so im closing that tab."
Brewers,31x53c,Spumander,4,Thu Apr 9 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, the heckling before that pitch was awesome."
Brewers,31x53c,fly1ngorb,5,Thu Apr 9 03:14:43 2015 UTC,Fuck you Axford.
Brewers,31x53c,fly1ngorb,4,Thu Apr 9 03:26:38 2015 UTC,Goddamn Axford. I used to root for you. Now I despise you. But seriously hope the dude's kid is okay.
Brewers,31x53c,gandaalf,3,Thu Apr 9 03:28:31 2015 UTC,FYI for everyone watching on TV:  The game is on FSWI's alternate channel because of the Bucks game.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,3,Wed Apr 8 21:21:21 2015 UTC,Good to be back at the ballpark.
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Wed Apr 8 23:11:49 2015 UTC,Anyone have a decent stream? I don't know how to get the alternate FSWI channel. Am retarded
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,2,Thu Apr 9 00:07:21 2015 UTC,strikeout.co
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 00:07:59 2015 UTC,At least Peralta being a bit off means out of the strike zone rather then down the middle.
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 9 00:20:25 2015 UTC,Fireworks for a walk? I'd take that.
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,3,Thu Apr 9 00:24:08 2015 UTC,They hit doubles and we hit double plays.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"Jeez, Lind is our only guy that can hit at this point."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 00:27:53 2015 UTC,Lind is hot as hell.
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,3,Thu Apr 9 00:28:12 2015 UTC,I can't remember what it's like to have the lead. That would be a dream come true.
Brewers,31x53c,tacoguy1234,3,Thu Apr 9 00:40:56 2015 UTC,Thatta boy Khris! Love seeing him be even a little more patient.
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,3,Thu Apr 9 00:42:04 2015 UTC,Lind has looked really solid so far defensively (and has had a couple flashes of brilliance).  That might just end up being one hell of an acquisition.
Brewers,31x53c,The_Courier,3,Thu Apr 9 00:56:44 2015 UTC,FUCK YES I LOVE YOU LIND
Brewers,31x53c,theamazingkiwi,3,Thu Apr 9 01:04:53 2015 UTC,FINALLY!!

Brewers,31x53c,GetOuttaHereGone,3,Thu Apr 9 01:05:40 2015 UTC,Lind <3
Brewers,31x53c,KQ2eZPackers,3,Thu Apr 9 01:05:45 2015 UTC,Woo Doug Melvin!
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 01:05:45 2015 UTC,Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind!
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:05:46 2015 UTC,That Lind ball was hammered. What's his OPS now?
Brewers,31x53c,wiener_cleaner,3,Thu Apr 9 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"Every commercial break on MLB.tv, it switches back to the FSWI audio away from WTMJ's overlay. Anyone else?"
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"Great play by Segura, that's a long throw"
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 9 01:11:16 2015 UTC,Great inning for Wily!  Lind might have finally given them that spark they needed!
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:11:16 2015 UTC,Peralta is looking good. He's playing well too!
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"fantastic inning boys, nice and quick."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 9 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"Another hit!  Keep it goin, boys."
Brewers,31x53c,Necatorducis,3,Thu Apr 9 01:14:29 2015 UTC,khris davis has a real can-do attitude. thats exactly what this team needs.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,3,Thu Apr 9 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"Eeh, probably could have walked him there."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 9 01:32:36 2015 UTC,gomez swings at everything.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 01:41:09 2015 UTC,KHRIS KATCH KHRIS KHRUSH WALL
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"Goddammit Tulowitzki, stop being such a drag."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 01:47:56 2015 UTC,Adam Lind is basically Jesus.
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,3,Thu Apr 9 01:52:54 2015 UTC,It's official. I am this years curse. Every single time i flip over to the game the Rockies get a hit or run within 2 seconds.
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"Get your pitch forks, guys!"
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 02:28:03 2015 UTC,Lind pls. Hit a homer so far that it comes all the way around the world and you can hit it again for a second homer.   *Edit: Or that.
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 02:34:31 2015 UTC,CMON BREWERS.  MAKE ME BELIEVE
Brewers,31x53c,ccruner13,3,Thu Apr 9 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"Scooter single, Braun PH for a HR.  Make it happen, Ron.  Edit: Brauns on deck, itshappening.jpg"
Brewers,31x53c,Mega_Sloth_,3,Thu Apr 9 02:50:59 2015 UTC,2011 magic time pls.  Brauns tryin lol
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 02:53:47 2015 UTC,Good time for Lucroy's first hit.
Brewers,31x53c,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Thu Apr 9 02:59:23 2015 UTC,2008 MAGIC HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 02:59:36 2015 UTC,Let's go Luuuuuuuuuuuuc! Put it away!
Brewers,31x53c,skin87,3,Thu Apr 9 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"Right before Luc swung through that pitch, I could hear the individual puffs of ""LUC! LUC! LUC!"" from our drunk friend behind home plate. He clearly distracted Lucroy."
Brewers,31x53c,zinger565,3,Thu Apr 9 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"Was thinking the same thing.  Heh.  I mean, it was annoying me and I wasn't standing right in front of it."
Brewers,31x53c,shooter3390,3,Thu Apr 9 03:05:26 2015 UTC,FUCK WHY DID I EVEN SAY THAT
Brewers,31x53c,Free_Willy24,3,Thu Apr 9 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"Axford is coming in?  Shit, we might have a chance."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,3,Thu Apr 9 03:16:12 2015 UTC,At what point does Melvin start realizing Rodriguez's leadership and development skills in the bullpen do not make up for the fact he gives up homers like a freshman puts out at a frat party?
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,3,Thu Apr 9 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, all the boo's for Ax lol"
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,3,Thu Apr 9 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"WTF, Milwaukee? No need for that."
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,3,Thu Apr 9 03:21:37 2015 UTC,I...um...well...we almost had it? Ugh... facepalm

Brewers,31x53c,tACorruption,6,Thu Apr 9 03:28:12 2015 UTC,Am I the only one here who totally digs the blue jerseys so much more than the whites?
Brewers,31x53c,motivate18,6,Thu Apr 9 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"Retros with pinstripes are my pick.  I just greatly prefer the retro logo, though.  Those warmup ones they wear though (with just the ball and glove in the middle of the chest, and the deep blue color) are pretty damn awesome too, though."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,3,Thu Apr 9 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"I like the blues as well, but I especially like when they have the ""Milwaukee"" script logo. I want that as a tattoo, in fact."
Brewers,31x53c,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 9 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"Those are the away alternates, no?"
Brewers,31x53c,xsists,3,Thu Apr 9 01:15:29 2015 UTC,I like the blues but there is just something about home whites.  I won't buy one cause I'm a slob so I have to stay with the dark ones but I like the clean whites.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 01:14:52 2015 UTC,I really want to know the distance on that.  Holy shit that was hammered.
Brewers,31x53c,Tuggernuts23,2,Thu Apr 9 02:27:40 2015 UTC,We should rename our sub to /r/baseballmasochists.
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"Third time's a charm, boys."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 23:47:35 2015 UTC,LETS GOOOOOOO!
Brewers,31x53c,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Apr 8 23:59:17 2015 UTC,It'd be really nice if Wily turned into a legitimate ace.
Brewers,31x53c,tacoguy1234,2,Thu Apr 9 00:12:10 2015 UTC,Obligatory double..
Brewers,31x53c,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 9 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, i hadnt realized how durable Wily has been."
Brewers,31x53c,SolidRambo,2,Thu Apr 9 00:18:38 2015 UTC,Back to back 3-0 counts... I know they've been pounding us but we have to throw strikes.
Brewers,31x53c,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 9 00:18:56 2015 UTC,Not a bad start. Need to cut the doubles though.
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"LOL, pyro guy is calling it!"
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Never seen that happen, but I'll take the free fireworks."
Brewers,31x53c,tacoguy1234,2,Thu Apr 9 00:22:44 2015 UTC,maybe those fireworks were to get rid of the birds?
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,2,Thu Apr 9 00:24:39 2015 UTC,I'm really impressed with Lind's bat.  I just hope he can stay healthy.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,2,Thu Apr 9 00:28:11 2015 UTC,My man Lind!
Brewers,31x53c,skin87,2,Thu Apr 9 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"Also, it feels so right to be at the stadium again"
Brewers,31x53c,ShoopALoop11,2,Thu Apr 9 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, we're making contact. I'm feelin optimistic."
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,2,Thu Apr 9 00:30:40 2015 UTC,Ueck was talking about punching slot machines. I love you Ueck.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 00:34:59 2015 UTC,Out by a mile!

Brewers,31x53c,Free_Willy24,2,Thu Apr 9 00:35:42 2015 UTC,Hey! Something to cheer for: luuuuuuuuuuuc
Brewers,31x53c,dutchoven21,2,Thu Apr 9 00:35:49 2015 UTC,I'm predicting we score big against this guy in like the 5th.
Brewers,31x53c,Tuggernuts23,2,Thu Apr 9 00:47:52 2015 UTC,Scooter hasn't had a good AB this series
Brewers,31x53c,SpartanBuck,2,Thu Apr 9 00:50:06 2015 UTC,Damn. Melvin's mustache is white as fuck.
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,2,Thu Apr 9 00:51:50 2015 UTC,Man its nice having Parra out there...
Brewers,31x53c,motivate18,2,Thu Apr 9 00:53:45 2015 UTC,Peralta's getting ahead in the count. I like that.
Brewers,31x53c,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Apr 9 00:55:54 2015 UTC,Good inning
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 00:56:01 2015 UTC,Just tuning in. At least it is still 0 - 0.
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,2,Thu Apr 9 00:56:19 2015 UTC,guys Lind is doing okay.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 01:05:11 2015 UTC,First lead of the season aaaaw yeah
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,2,Thu Apr 9 01:07:58 2015 UTC,"Let's just hope that Lind's back is ok, because he is completely carrying our offense. We've got the momentum, now someone else needs to step up!"
Brewers,31x53c,ccruner13,2,Thu Apr 9 01:08:13 2015 UTC,This should help build some morale.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 01:09:03 2015 UTC,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 01:09:16 2015 UTC,Brewers in 6
Brewers,31x53c,sonotmysfwaccount,2,Thu Apr 9 01:15:19 2015 UTC,More line drives right at the outfielders...  We have shit luck sometimes.
Brewers,31x53c,jim732,2,Thu Apr 9 01:19:47 2015 UTC,Nice to see Lind have a good start to this season.
Brewers,31x53c,smiles134,2,Thu Apr 9 01:20:12 2015 UTC,Who the fuck was that bearded guy in the dugout with the pitchers?
Brewers,31x53c,jn2010,2,Thu Apr 9 01:21:57 2015 UTC,Well...that could have been worse i guess.
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 01:28:17 2015 UTC,"Well that was a good bad play. Let's get a double play. Colorado, you Arenado going to score."
Brewers,31x53c,TheBause,2,Thu Apr 9 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"Should have been called out as soon as he was out of the baseline, but damn that was great defense."
Brewers,31x53c,necropaw,2,Thu Apr 9 01:30:28 2015 UTC,"Ballsack. It's only fair that we score 15 runs today to see how it makes the Rockies feel, right?"
Brewers,31x53c,indiemike,2,Thu Apr 9 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"God.  ESPN actually managed to make their website worse.  It is at least 3 clicks and a bunch of scrolling to find the box score for a live game where before it used to be 1.  Also, apparently being able to disable autoplay was too good for us because that is gone now, too.  Amazing."

Brewers,31ws9i,P-Munny,3,Wed Apr 8 19:40:36 2015 UTC,I'm gonna need more than one regular season game out of pitchers to make any judgement call.
Brewers,31ws9i,ShakeyBobWillis,3,Wed Apr 8 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"It all leans on Lohse/Garza/Wily.  If they can't get it done, we're screwed.  Everyone is thinking Fiers will come out and just put up a sub-3.50 ERA like it's nothing this year.  Am I the only one who remembers what a dumpster fire he was for the crew in 2013?  And Nelson has shown very little at the MLB level for me to believe in.  Oh, and no one to start behind them.  What a mess.  I'm calling it- the team will be at least 6 games under .500 this month."
Brewers,31ws9i,pfelon,2,Thu Apr 9 02:39:51 2015 UTC,"Lohse will get it back, Garza will be decent.  Those guys have both been around long enough that you know roughly what to expect.  Hoping for good things from Wily and its entirely possible we see them.  Fiers....i dunno.  hes been really good, and really bad in the past.  It'll depend on if he can keep his mojo or not."
Brewers,31ws9i,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"The Brewers are 1% through the season, doesnt really matter so far that the pitching looks bad.  The flip side to that is that the pitching actually is pretty bad and projected to be that way.  At the very best they will be average.  Lohse is a pitch to contact guy who throws a sinkerball in a HR happy ball park, and is 36 years old.  I wouldnt expect too much from him.  Garza should be ok.  But he is always going to have injury issues.  The big hope this year has to come from Peralta and improving on last year.  He is really the only arm in the entire system worth getting excited about at this point."
Brewers,31ws9i,workthrowaway68,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:10:05 2015 UTC,If we can't hit? Then yeah. A very long year.

Brewers,31wiwk,Rectifier15,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. It's always irked me that they wait until the next series to make games up when they could just do it the next day or night.  Honestly, though? It's probably money related, like everything in sports. They might think they couldn't sell as many tickets on one day's notice as they could waiting until the next series when they can advertise a double-header."
Brewers,31wiwk,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Apr 8 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"We did have... Facility issues on opening day, so that probably contributed also."
Brewers,31wiwk,zdruck07,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:11:11 2015 UTC,I think it's more for people with tickets.  Gives people more time to plan the makeup game than if it's the next day.
Brewers,31wiwk,necropaw,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:14:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that they saw they had a chance to use a bit of time to...  Clear up some restroom issues.  Opening night was kind of a disaster for us when it comes to facilities stuff.  And hitting.  But I digress.
Brewers,31wiwk,zdruck07,2,Thu Apr 9 13:38:50 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  I know they were bringing in portajohns, i just kinda assumed they had it cleaned up.  I feel bad for the poor sob that had to clean that up..."
Brewers,31tigl,simboisland,2,Wed Apr 8 01:10:47 2015 UTC,"Hard to say honestly, we have such little depth I don't think we should trade Seggy, he's young and only had one bad year. I don't believe we'd trade him just yet."

Brewers,31tigl,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"I may look more into this as a hypothetical trade situation. For now, I don't see the Crew moving Segura unless 1.) Orlando Arcia (Top SS prospect) is ready for the bigs, but he is starting work in AA this year and wont be ready for a little while now. 2.) The deal would have to fit the needs of Mark/Doug, and they are looking for more of a young minor leaguer with upside (more risky trade values) as well as cost controlled major leaguers, essentially, the deal would have to be to good to pass up, which may be possible with Sardinas as a depth option."
Brewers,31tigl,scottastic86,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:28:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Benoit, Amarista, and Liriano? Do you have 3 entrenched outfielders? Or just 2?"
Brewers,31tigl,scottastic86,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"We actually have 4 outfielders for this season who are starting caliber. Parra (you may know), Braun (You do know), Gomez (Arguably the best OF on the time all around) and Davis (good slugger, iffy everything else). So that may not be the answer, although Parra and Gomez are up after this season if I am not mistaken."

Brewers,31twpw,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Apr 8 03:40:26 2015 UTC,Technically we're on pace for 0 wins the whole season.
Brewers,31twpw,Cobruh,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on what stats you're looking at. Every game this season, we've scored more runs than the previous game, and allowed less runs than the previous.  You could also make the argument that our 1 run per game will never be able to overcome the 7.5 runs per game that our pitching is allowing. Damn 2 game sample sizes!"
Brewers,31twpw,Cody1017,2,Wed Apr 8 20:08:03 2015 UTC,Haha very true. Im interested to see how tonights game will effect the stats!
Brewers,31twpw,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, but we won the first and lost the last two.  So the way I see it, last year we started out great, slowed down, then collapsed which was kind of like the first series.  So far, we're starting out slow but when we win tonight it's a sign that we'll be strong going into the playoffs.  Right guys? Guys?  help"

Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,3,Wed Apr 8 01:26:06 2015 UTC,Segura..:( be okay buddy
Brewers,31smcn,tacoguy1234,3,Wed Apr 8 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, that replay didnt look nearly as bad as i thought it was live.  Still."
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,3,Wed Apr 8 01:37:16 2015 UTC,the brim of the helmet saved his face
Brewers,31smcn,tacoguy1234,3,Wed Apr 8 01:37:37 2015 UTC,Don't do the classic Brewers thing with the bases loaded.

Brewers,31smcn,ShoopALoop11,3,Wed Apr 8 01:41:45 2015 UTC,OH SHIT JOHN CENA IS HERE
Brewers,31smcn,adam7765,3,Wed Apr 8 01:42:13 2015 UTC,Fucking christ Logan we could of used anything but a DP
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,3,Wed Apr 8 01:42:27 2015 UTC,Why Logan Schaefer? Why?
Brewers,31smcn,xsists,3,Wed Apr 8 01:42:50 2015 UTC,Cmon boys!  I feel the magic!
Brewers,31smcn,jubjub2184,3,Wed Apr 8 01:42:51 2015 UTC,The team has a pulse!
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,3,Wed Apr 8 01:42:54 2015 UTC,YES!!!!!! GO-GO!!!!! Theres our offense.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,3,Wed Apr 8 01:43:01 2015 UTC,Rockies undefeated greatest offense of all time.
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 01:50:51 2015 UTC,But could they beat the Knicks?
Brewers,31smcn,Bullwine85,3,Wed Apr 8 01:53:07 2015 UTC,In a game of BASEketball? Fuck yeah.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,3,Wed Apr 8 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"Not what I meant, Thornburg"
Brewers,31smcn,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Wed Apr 8 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Noodle Arm strikes again
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,3,Wed Apr 8 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"You could bat .280 at Coors Field, BA."
Brewers,31smcn,tr1ppn,3,Wed Apr 8 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"Did anyone notice that they changed the Reds Apple Ale commercial. It used to say ""Crisp like an apple, brewed like an ale."" Now they changed ale to beer.  I watch too much TV to notice that shit."
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 02:04:15 2015 UTC,I would be almost glad to see commercials if it would stop the deafening silence between innings on mlb.tv.
Brewers,31smcn,Redtitwhore,2,Wed Apr 8 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i always thought that when i used mlb.tv too.  honestly, i still feel that way now that im watching on dish.  The silence is annoying."
Brewers,31smcn,TurboShorts,3,Wed Apr 8 02:08:16 2015 UTC,If you are already getting frustrated this is going to be a long season for you.
Brewers,31smcn,jn2010,2,Wed Apr 8 02:40:41 2015 UTC,so what's everyone drinking?
Brewers,31smcn,TurboShorts,2,Wed Apr 8 01:16:13 2015 UTC,Whiskey.  Lots of whiskey.
Brewers,31smcn,KB4ever,2,Wed Apr 8 01:17:19 2015 UTC,seriously if that was a half inch to the left....holy shit....
Brewers,31smcn,bwadams12,2,Wed Apr 8 01:38:44 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a stream? I would appreciate it.
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 00:22:50 2015 UTC,Tuning in after getting bored of the tire fire that is the Braves/Marlins game.  How was ST for you folks?  Anyone looking particularly exciting right now?
Brewers,31smcn,bwadams12,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Nothing flashy, nothing terrible.  Record wasnt great, but that'll happen with pitchers working on stuff, minor leaguers, etc.  Lucroy is always worth watching.  Lind has been settling in so far pretty well.  Garza looks decent so far tonight, too."
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"Record wasnt great, but that'll happen with pitchers working on stuff   Always does.  I just didn't know if you had someone tear the cover off of it or something while I wasn't watching.  Lucroy is a blast, he's most of the reason why I popped over here instead of the COL thread.  Garza's not getting a ton of calls this inning, but he looks like he's just barely missing his spots."
Brewers,31smcn,jn2010,2,Wed Apr 8 00:30:46 2015 UTC,I just didn't know if you had someone tear the cover off of it or something while I wasn't watching.   Well....
Brewers,31smcn,bwadams12,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:33:40 2015 UTC,"I don't follow spring training very much but general consensus is that we'll be very similar to last year.  It's almost the same roster.  If we play like the first half last year, we'll be happy.  If we play like the second half, we won't.  We got destroyed yesterday so expectations aren't high right now."
Brewers,31smcn,Free_Willy24,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard.  Rough outing, but those happen, it's just always terrible when that's literally the only baseball you have to go by."
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 00:31:33 2015 UTC,This is so much better than yesterday.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 00:37:24 2015 UTC,Attaboy Siggy.  Now lets get a run and clear the pitchers spot!
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"There we go, Soggy! Siggy!"
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:39:51 2015 UTC,Autocorrect strikes again
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 00:40:08 2015 UTC,Whoofta.  Nice job of covering by Garza.
Brewers,31smcn,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Wed Apr 8 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"Shit, Garza just worked a 6+ pitch AB?  Hell, i'd call that a quality one for a pitcher."
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 00:54:00 2015 UTC,I'll take a home run if anyone feels like hitting one.
Brewers,31smcn,fly1ngorb,2,Wed Apr 8 01:16:04 2015 UTC,YOUVE GOTTA BE SHITTING ME TAKE A FUCKING DOUBLE.
Brewers,31smcn,GetOuttaHereGone,2,Wed Apr 8 01:18:13 2015 UTC,What an awful decision.

Brewers,31smcn,CJL13,2,Wed Apr 8 01:19:50 2015 UTC,Can the brewers file a restraining order on Tulo or something to keep him away? Dude needs to leave us alone
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 01:25:46 2015 UTC,No way Braun would've gotten that.
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 01:27:51 2015 UTC,No no no.

Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 01:36:22 2015 UTC,Miller Park is really bad for batters faces.
Brewers,31smcn,gandaalf,2,Wed Apr 8 01:36:28 2015 UTC,WHATS THE FUCKING PROBLEM WITH MILLER PARK FUCK
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 01:36:31 2015 UTC,Oh for fucks sake. This guy has the worst luck I've ever seen

Brewers,31smcn,CJL13,2,Wed Apr 8 01:36:43 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's lucky as fuuuuuuck.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 01:37:18 2015 UTC,We have more injuries than runs this year. Good on the catcher to call for help.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 01:37:27 2015 UTC,Oh thank God
Brewers,31smcn,gandaalf,2,Wed Apr 8 01:37:36 2015 UTC,God damn double play bullshit
Brewers,31smcn,Bullwine85,2,Wed Apr 8 01:41:38 2015 UTC,Fuck Logan Schaefer. I don't think I've ever seen that kid get a hit
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 01:42:12 2015 UTC,I kind of like this scoring thing. Can we keep doing that?
Brewers,31smcn,greenbaymike,2,Wed Apr 8 01:46:33 2015 UTC,Commercial shows the Kohl Center.  sobs
Brewers,31smcn,tr1ppn,2,Wed Apr 8 01:46:36 2015 UTC,may God help Thornburg get out of this inning without giving up a run
Brewers,31smcn,jubjub2184,2,Wed Apr 8 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see the word cloud from this thread. I feel like it would just be a giant ""FUCK"" in the middle, and various other swears slightly smaller all around it.  In other news, apparently my internet can't handle 2 laptop and an mlb.tv stream all at the same time since it keeps cutting out. Piece of shit Time Warner."
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,2,Wed Apr 8 02:00:59 2015 UTC,FUCK
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, we cannot catch a break"
Brewers,31smcn,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Wed Apr 8 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"Well, they're getting some solid contact at least. Runs will come."
Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 02:07:52 2015 UTC,What the fuck was that commercial?

Brewers,31smcn,TheBause,2,Wed Apr 8 02:11:45 2015 UTC,I want to hit a double too.
Brewers,31smcn,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Wed Apr 8 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to go play San Andreas. Still listen on the radio though."
Brewers,31smcn,gandaalf,2,Wed Apr 8 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Rock and BA have a point. I don't usually buy in to stealing signs, but the fact he moved forward in the box as if he knew a breaking ball was coming was seriously strange."
Brewers,31smcn,CJL13,3,Wed Apr 8 02:19:10 2015 UTC,Hey I'll latch onto anything to justify us getting wrecked
Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,2,Wed Apr 8 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"Oh no a starter with a 6.75 ERA, he's gonna kick our ass."

Brewers,31smcn,jubjub2184,2,Tue Apr 7 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not (at least that I know of). Even with mlb.tv you only get all of the out of market games, which is great for people like me who live out of state, but not so much for people in Wisconsin or whatever market you're in."

Brewers,31smcn,necropaw,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, that was an easier call than if Duke touched the ball."
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:33:27 2015 UTC,Too soon.  I was listening to yesterday's Toronto game at work today.  It was painful enough that they gave the score for the Brewers game a couple of times so i had to be reminded of it.  Them talking about the upcoming championship game was even worse...and im not a basketball fan.
Brewers,31smcn,fly1ngorb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:35:11 2015 UTC,Everyone on campus today was just lethargic and melancholic. It was awful.
Brewers,31smcn,smiles134,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"I bet.  I'm starting to feel better.  I'll remember the Kentucky game and this team forever, it was great to get the attention of being near the top of the CBB world for two years."
Brewers,31smcn,fly1ngorb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah... It just sucks knowing pretty much everyone is gone, now. We're basically starting over"

Was it just mis-understandings between what is and isn't allowed that slowed it down, or just not enough lines to keep everyone moving? Was it just bag checks, or the whole metal detector, take off your shoes and stand in the whirly-gig thing?"
Brewers,31r7dh,zinger565,3,Tue Apr 7 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"You didn't have to remove shoes. But you had to empty pockets, remove any metal items, place in a tote along with cell phones etc. Then you passed through a metal detector (not the whirly kind at airports though). Any bags were hand searched by security.  There didn't seem to be any misunderstandings, it just seemed really slow.  I don't understand how this is making anyone safer. Was there some widespread, systemic threat of violence at baseball parks?  If this was to stop people carrying in alcohol, won't they just get plastic containers?  https://sports.vice.com/article/mlbs-metal-detector-policy-is-what-terrorists-winning-looks-like"
Brewers,31r7dh,crewserbattle,2,Tue Apr 7 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a bag so I went through the express line and it was about twice as fast. The biggest delay I noticed was people who had tickets that needed to scan off of their phones. Sometimes the machine had trouble reading it, and then they had to wait for it to print a receipt for them.  Searching bags and digital tickets seem to be the culprits."
Brewers,31r7dh,zinger565,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Good to know. Fiance and I are planning on going to a game in late June, will have to keep this in mind when we decide what we're going to bring!"
Brewers,31r7dh,Free_Willy24,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:28:48 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that it's more of a feeling of security it gives if anything. That said, it might be worth it approaching the game as if it were an NFL game(no backpacks allowed) and don't bring a backpack(most people will probably figure this out that it'll take longer so they won't bring it, speeding up the rest of the line) and get all of your electronics and stuff in your pockets ready to be taken out."
Brewers,31r7dh,xsists,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:26:08 2015 UTC,I had no issue getting in quickly.  The lines were super long on the east side of the stadium but I went around the corner to the NE side (the Fridays entrance you can see from 94) and there was no line.  Dropped my cell phone in a tote and walked right through.  I didn't even remove my keys from my pocket.
Brewers,31rtw6,BrianTheLady,11,Tue Apr 7 17:51:43 2015 UTC,Who cares? If the Brewers aren't mentioned it's because Brewers fans aren't mentioning them.  Go ahead and get the word out. /r/mlb sucks anyway. I unsubbed a while ago. It's basically a worse version of /r/baseball with less variety.
Brewers,31rtw6,Tuggernuts23,5,Tue Apr 7 18:17:19 2015 UTC,Just like /r/NHL is a much worse version of /r/hockey
Brewers,31rtw6,Bullwine85,2,Tue Apr 7 19:41:47 2015 UTC,I may just be used to the /r/nfl vs /r/football dilemma.
Brewers,31rtw6,Spongie555,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:14:30 2015 UTC,Here is a little background on the split of /r/mlb from /r/baseball. This is manly the reason why /r/mlb sucks and usually quiet
Brewers,31rtw6,CJL13,3,Wed Apr 8 18:16:39 2015 UTC,We get mentioned on the subreddits if a fight breaks out or a player gets suspended!
Brewers,31phsp,necropaw,19,Tue Apr 7 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"First the Brewer collapse last season, then the NFC Title game, now the Badger loss. Wisconsin sports heartbreak trifecta complete."
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,7,Tue Apr 7 03:35:57 2015 UTC,All a conspiracy to make us drink.
Brewers,31phsp,CJL13,10,Tue Apr 7 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"Now all that's needed is for the Bucks to make a surprise run to the NBA finals, go up 3-0 in the series, then lose the next four games."
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,6,Tue Apr 7 04:53:18 2015 UTC,The Bucks sniffing a playoff race and falling short might do it for them at this point.
Brewers,31phsp,ccruner13,0,Tue Apr 7 05:08:14 2015 UTC,At least they'd be sniffing something besides glue.
Brewers,31phsp,KEM10,4,Tue Apr 7 15:42:27 2015 UTC,Don't forget the bucks faltering down the stretch
Brewers,31phsp,zmichalo,4,Tue Apr 7 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, since the Packers won the Super Bowl, we've seen Rose Bowl losses, an NLCS loss, an NFC Championship loss, epic collapses, and a National Championship loss.   Always so close.  We are lucky to have plenty of competitive sports teams, I guess."
Brewers,31phsp,fly1ngorb,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"And then for me, you have the US national soccer team and Philadelphia Union, both of which have a tendency to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in the last 10 minutes of their matches the past year or so.  Its like I'm in multiple abusive relationships"
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,2,Tue Apr 7 17:30:58 2015 UTC,And the UW Football team getting reamed in the B1G championship game. At least they came back and won the bowl game.
Brewers,31phsp,smiles134,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:32:53 2015 UTC,So true.
Brewers,31phsp,teethteetheat,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:27:53 2015 UTC,Sighhh
Brewers,31phsp,Free_Willy24,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:14:55 2015 UTC,And for me the Hawks losing to the Kings in 7.
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,3,Tue Apr 7 21:26:50 2015 UTC,I liked that one :)  Let's go Blues
Brewers,31phsp,Free_Willy24,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:35:30 2015 UTC,You're a Brewers fanbut I'm not sure if I like you...
Brewers,31phsp,Squirrly22,11,Tue Apr 7 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"You know what, fuck that, I'm drunk and I'm proud as hell of this badger team. I've never seen a badger national championship game and it was fun to watch. On Wisconsin."
Brewers,31phsp,KEM10,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:41:57 2015 UTC,As some of my friends have pointed out:  At least they beat Kentucky.
Brewers,31phsp,fly1ngorb,2,Tue Apr 7 15:43:27 2015 UTC,I bet people will remember that more than Duke winning again.
Brewers,31phsp,30rec,8,Tue Apr 7 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"It was one thing in the Kentucky game when the refs were just bad overall, but I don't think there was a single debatable call that didn't go against Wisconsin in the second half tonight."
Brewers,31phsp,ccruner13,9,Tue Apr 7 03:32:55 2015 UTC,Why did I even get out of bed today?  (*╯´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥﹏°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ )╯︵ ┻━━━┻
Brewers,31phsp,prof_shine,0,Tue Apr 7 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"Edit: Nevermind, im fucking retarded and cant read."
Brewers,31phsp,MurDoct,3,Tue Apr 7 05:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, that ref'ing performance is why I can't get excited about basketball. It's one thing when there's a questionable call that alters the momentum of game that a team can overcome. It's another thing when the refs singlewhistledly lets a team get back into a game.  In conclusion: beer.  tl;dr: Beer."
Brewers,31phsp,zinger565,3,Tue Apr 7 15:36:14 2015 UTC,"Badgers had their chance to blow the game open when Okafor was on the bench. Forget about the refs, Badgers never seemed to settle in on offense. No shame in making it to the final game. Badgers did win regular season and Big 10 conference tournament so it was a fun ride for a while."
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,2,Tue Apr 7 20:50:21 2015 UTC,"Same. I cut out of the Brewers game early, just wasn't worth the data (mobile at work). Badgers game...ugh...I don't think there's enough beer in IA. Granted, there were some terrible calls by the refs, and also some terrible non-calls, WI had a few opportunities to take over that game and didn't capitalize."
Brewers,31phsp,Bullwine85,2,Tue Apr 7 03:30:58 2015 UTC,"watched the Wild   Geez, when it comes between the Wild and the Blackhawks, can't the earth just swallow them whole?  Though my team is out of the playoffs and I'll have to root for the Preds/Blues in the playoffs :("
Brewers,31phsp,robomummy,2,Tue Apr 7 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"My sister is the big Hockey fan in the family and shes a Wild fan, so i kinda follow them.  Plus frankly, for those of us in the northcentral part of the state, the Wild are the closest.  Hell, by proximity i should be a Twins fan, but fuck that.  By TV rights, i get the Wild and Brewers exclusively."
Brewers,31phsp,fly1ngorb,2,Tue Apr 7 03:49:51 2015 UTC,"Meh, only reason to root for the Wild for me personally is good old Wisconsin boy Suter. Otherwise the Preds are a great option since their minor league team is in Milwaukee (plus they have another Wisconsin boy, Craig Smith).  But I can see why you'd be a Wild fan."
Brewers,31phsp,dcandap,2,Tue Apr 7 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"Brewers, Badgers, and Wild. 3 losses including two shutouts in the same day. It's times like this I wonder why I do this to myself."
Brewers,31phsp,banhammer1,2,Tue Apr 7 05:25:38 2015 UTC,Remember when waking up was fun?
Brewers,31phsp,theamazingkiwi,3,Tue Apr 7 17:19:52 2015 UTC,Hah.  Nope.  Not a morning person.
Brewers,31phsp,hyperbolical,2,Tue Apr 7 17:24:12 2015 UTC,There's one thing though... THE BEARS. STILL. SUCK.
Brewers,31phsp,shooter3390,3,Tue Apr 7 04:55:27 2015 UTC,Well i mean...that goes without saying :)  Same goes for the Cubs tho.  They still had the first loss of the year.  BOOM.
Brewers,31phsp,Beginnerwithnoluck,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:58:47 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Brewers / Badgers / Wild fan, I feel you."
Brewers,31phsp,shooter3390,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"Hold on, I got to get something fixed real quick....maybe those refs can help me out."
Brewers,31phsp,crewserbattle,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Well, theres been 3 other shutouts today (and one currently going into the 7th?), along with 5 other games with a team only scoring 1 run (along with another one still going at 1 run).  I guess that takes a slight sting out of the Brewers game, though its still against fucking Kendricks.    Kinda just hoping we kill them tomorrow and Braun pisses down Tulo's throat its in commanding style."
Brewers,31nki2,to_be_quite_frank,26,Mon Apr 6 18:22:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm really glad he's been getting more opportunities on the national level with weekend broadcasts and the NCAA tourney. He definitely deserves it. We are spoiled rotten with BA on FSN and Uecker on the radio.
Brewers,31nki2,dutchoven21,12,Mon Apr 6 18:32:53 2015 UTC,Me too. CBS/Turner let him call games deeper in the tourney this year. He's really gaining momentum. He has such a great grasp of the moment. Knows when to turn up the excitement. He's going to have a great career
Brewers,31nki2,sqrlsjustwannahvefun,2,Mon Apr 6 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"He was also announcing the NBA playoffs, and will announce a few NFL games this year."
Brewers,31nki2,ShabazzJenkins,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:01:20 2015 UTC,He has that great hype factor during a big call or moment just like Gus Johnson or Joe Rogan. It adds a little extra to a big play.   Hopefully he doesn't bolt for a bigger network. It seems like he has the perfect schedule of doing Basketball during Baseball's off-season.
Brewers,31nki2,Kobe_AYEEEEE,12,Fri Apr 10 14:35:49 2015 UTC,"The only bad thing is that he is so good I can see him leaving the Brewers for a full time national gig. Good for him if he does, but watching the Crew won't quite be the same."
Brewers,31nki2,Uranus_Hz,8,Mon Apr 6 20:06:03 2015 UTC,Just like Matt Vasgergian did.
Brewers,31nki2,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,4,Mon Apr 6 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"And Jim Powell on the radio.  No offense to Uecker, but I kinda listen to him for the novelty of it.  Jim Powell was the real deal -- I haven't heard anybody announce play-by-play baseball quite like he did."
Brewers,31nki2,EthyleneGlycol,2,Tue Apr 7 05:19:08 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I like Uecker. But he's a novelty more than anything at this point. Powell and then Provus were great play by play guys though. Joe Block I'd better than when he started but it's still not the same.
Brewers,31nki2,squizzlewix,2,Tue Apr 7 05:26:18 2015 UTC,"Provus was pretty rough when he started.  You could tell he wasn't an expert like Powell.  By the time he left he was perfect.  I hope the same for Block, because I would guess he is in for the long haul.  They just need to fill the road games with not Davie Nelson."
Brewers,31nki2,MFazio23,2,Tue Apr 7 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"I know this is a different sport but Mike Breen still calls games for the Knicks. This is on top of being the #1 play by play guy for ESPN/ABC. Hey, it can happen"
Brewers,31nki2,iheartschadenfreude,7,Mon Apr 6 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"That's also Knicks vs. Brewers, not quite the same."
Brewers,31nki2,necropaw,8,Mon Apr 6 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"He is one of the few that actually adds to a game - most announcers/commentators seem like they get paid by the word.  For now, my only solace for the fact that Ueck will be retiring in the future, is that BA is around.  Here's hoping he stays!"
Brewers,31nki2,Bullwine85,4,Mon Apr 6 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"For now, my only solace for the fact that Ueck will be retiring in the future,   Ive been really trying to ignore that fact :("
Brewers,31nki2,r1vals,3,Mon Apr 6 21:22:06 2015 UTC,Just another reason I want to see the Brewers win the World Series soon: Uecker will be overcome with emotion.
Brewers,31nki2,Screech-,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:06:50 2015 UTC,I think there is a really good chance he sticks around. He clearly loves the team and he still gets other opportunities.
Brewers,31r6mw,gopher33j,6,Tue Apr 7 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"Through all teams first games since 1914, it looks like 2015 had most shutouts. Check out this table"

Brewers,31r6mw,Amoney8612,2,Tue Apr 7 19:13:00 2015 UTC,No problem. Bbref.com has their stat finder stuff for free until the 15th. Otherwise I wouldn't have done that. Lol
Brewers,31r6mw,necropaw,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Might be a bit of a question for /r/baseball.  There were also something like 4? games where a team only scored one run.  made me feel a bit better about yesterdays game.  Granted, ours was still the worst."
Brewers,31o9tj,fly1ngorb,22,Mon Apr 6 21:24:05 2015 UTC,Ill still take it over not having baseball.

Brewers,31o9tj,SocksandSmocks,9,Mon Apr 6 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well that's clearly a sign. Don't let the doomsday radio callers worry you, obviously they're pulling a reverse of last year culminating in an improbable resurgence late in the season.... or we suck, either way, baseball is back!"

Brewers,31o9tj,madman86,4,Mon Apr 6 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Lind was 3-4 today."
Brewers,31o9tj,CJL13,5,Mon Apr 6 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"The best move was getting rid of a solid pitcher when we had no depth. I get they wanted to get something for Yo, but why? We all know that this season is basically it. If they don't win this season we're likely to go into rebuilding."

Brewers,31mum1,zinger565,3,Mon Apr 6 18:56:40 2015 UTC,Love listening to Uke when he gets all excited on the radio broadcast.
Brewers,31mum1,ccruner13,5,Mon Apr 6 18:58:05 2015 UTC,BA sounded just about as surprised as I was just now realizing it is only the 4th.
Brewers,31mum1,CJL13,2,Mon Apr 6 19:39:13 2015 UTC,Shitty playing slows games down more than stepping out of the batter's box.
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,3,Mon Apr 6 19:43:36 2015 UTC,At least it's not the Cardinals
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,5,Mon Apr 6 19:39:45 2015 UTC,"Sigh I really do miss when this team had a bona fide ""ace"". Good times.."
Brewers,31mum1,TheBause,5,Mon Apr 6 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Well, we've got six months to improve this shit."
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,4,Mon Apr 6 19:54:27 2015 UTC,Uke is saying Usingers will take away all the memories from todays game.  Should have saved that one for the miller promo...
Brewers,31mum1,xbaahx,5,Mon Apr 6 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=okXhAC78d4Q  Overreacting. Yes. But damnit, that's my right."
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,3,Mon Apr 6 20:12:23 2015 UTC,There will definitely not be a h*** train this year.
Brewers,31mum1,Bullwine85,3,Mon Apr 6 17:09:29 2015 UTC,hank train? /s
Brewers,31mum1,adam7765,2,Mon Apr 6 17:33:40 2015 UTC,Everybody start drinking
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,5,Mon Apr 6 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"Booooo, cheeeeaterrrrrrrrr"
Brewers,31mum1,jn2010,4,Mon Apr 6 18:45:38 2015 UTC,I wonder how much he gets booed this year.  You'd think it would get old after a while.
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,2,Mon Apr 6 18:46:21 2015 UTC,He got a bit of an ovation it sounded like when he first came up.  Of course thats at home.
Brewers,31mum1,smiles134,2,Mon Apr 6 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"You'd think that the guy in Philly would've stopped after the second hr, and he still kept it up.  My point is, it probably won't ever stop entirely."
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,5,Mon Apr 6 18:47:30 2015 UTC,Hate the way this ump calls strikes.  Decent AB at least.
Brewers,31mum1,vNatural,2,Mon Apr 6 18:48:09 2015 UTC,The delay on every pitch is gonna make for a long game
Brewers,31mum1,jn2010,2,Mon Apr 6 18:49:28 2015 UTC,He's so late with the signal.  I love the guys who let the fans in the cheap seats know the call.
Brewers,31mum1,BrewCrewKevin,2,Mon Apr 6 18:49:51 2015 UTC,Checking in from literally the last row. I agree. I'm trying to figure balls and strikes from crowd reactions by the field. ..
Brewers,31mum1,Bullwine85,4,Mon Apr 6 18:51:41 2015 UTC,Seems Milwaukee likes guys named Khris
Brewers,31mum1,BricksAndBatsOnVR,4,Mon Apr 6 19:04:05 2015 UTC,Aw she said Kentucky...
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,4,Mon Apr 6 19:13:56 2015 UTC,Ugh.  If this wasnt opening day i'd be tempted to turn this game off ._.
Brewers,31mum1,tACorruption,5,Mon Apr 6 19:18:56 2015 UTC,I texted a buddy today and bet him I could get through at least 3 games without throwing a brick through my monitor.  I'm already not so sure...
Brewers,31mum1,PacoTiko,6,Mon Apr 6 19:19:13 2015 UTC,Jesus pull the plug on Lohse. These pitches are horrible.
Brewers,31mum1,AssSombrero,5,Mon Apr 6 19:20:11 2015 UTC,Hes hitting better than hes pitching
Brewers,31mum1,jn2010,4,Mon Apr 6 19:25:02 2015 UTC,We really should have a count of Gomez swinging out of his helmet.
Brewers,31mum1,Morphenominal,4,Mon Apr 6 19:26:07 2015 UTC,Numbers don't go that high.
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,5,Mon Apr 6 19:29:03 2015 UTC,Like the AJ hawk helmet count
Brewers,31mum1,adam7765,3,Mon Apr 6 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is what happens when you trade Rickie Weeks, that man was holding the team together."
Brewers,31mum1,dnalur,3,Mon Apr 6 19:36:22 2015 UTC,That was probably the worst outing by Kyle Lohse I've ever seen
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,4,Mon Apr 6 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"Well, last season we tore through April like a kid in a candy store. Maybe we flip it around and tear through August and September this year, right, RIGHT?  I sure hope so."
Brewers,31mum1,Mega_Sloth_,5,Mon Apr 6 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"I think we should all just pretend today didn't happen. At all.  Man, I'm so excited for opening day tomorrow!"
Brewers,31mum1,Hugh_G_Wrection,3,Mon Apr 6 20:34:02 2015 UTC,Anyone know where I can catch a stream of this game?
Brewers,31mum1,Enigmaticize,2,Mon Apr 6 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"bosscast.net  edit: unfortunately, it is the Rockies stream. If I can find the FSN stream I'll update`"
Brewers,31mum1,Infamous_potato,2,Mon Apr 6 17:56:27 2015 UTC,stream 2 on stream2watch.me is the FSN broadcast.
Brewers,31mum1,tACorruption,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:20:20 2015 UTC,It's kinda shady but you could always try front row sports
Brewers,31mum1,skin87,3,Mon Apr 6 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Welp, here goes nothing boys.  Through thick and thin this is our team.  Can't win them all without the first.  LET'S GO!"
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 16:20:20 2015 UTC,A few people were discussing what would happen with the anthem early in the offseason when Joe A. died. The answer is they are going to play a video of Joe singing from last year's opening day.
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 16:37:27 2015 UTC,IIIIIIIIIIIIITSSSSSSS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"Come back, Uke ;~;"
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,3,Mon Apr 6 18:24:28 2015 UTC,Fuck.
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,3,Mon Apr 6 18:29:15 2015 UTC,Well shit.
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,3,Mon Apr 6 18:30:02 2015 UTC,CarGo CRUSHED that double. Lohse needs to take a breath and relax a bit.
Brewers,31mum1,jim732,3,Mon Apr 6 18:30:58 2015 UTC,At least Lohse hasn't given up any singles yes. (Glad I didn't take him in fantasy baseball this year)
Brewers,31mum1,jn2010,3,Mon Apr 6 18:33:20 2015 UTC,Oh for fucks sake.
Brewers,31mum1,HRs_Only,3,Mon Apr 6 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, that could have gone better."

Brewers,31mum1,abadg59,3,Mon Apr 6 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"Checking in! From literally the last row in my section. And I'm drunk. Go brewers!    Even though my seats suck and the start of this game sucks, nothing like this feeling when baseball starts. Sure sign of spring!  Oh, and go bucky!"
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,3,Mon Apr 6 18:54:51 2015 UTC,Nice play!
Brewers,31mum1,Bullwine85,3,Mon Apr 6 18:56:35 2015 UTC,Hey hey! Adam Lind! I like you.
Brewers,31mum1,BricksAndBatsOnVR,3,Mon Apr 6 18:57:05 2015 UTC,The Ho-Chunk Casino ad is one of the most Wisconsin things ever.
Brewers,31mum1,Free_Willy24,3,Mon Apr 6 18:58:05 2015 UTC,Holy shit Lohse it is not your day.
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,3,Mon Apr 6 19:19:47 2015 UTC,Look at that ERA. Jesus Christ.
Brewers,31mum1,soapybubbles,2,Mon Apr 6 19:21:49 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Jesus Christ would have a lower ERA.
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,2,Mon Apr 6 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, but look at his batting average!"
Brewers,31mum1,TheBause,3,Mon Apr 6 19:29:20 2015 UTC,Fuck Duke?
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,3,Mon Apr 6 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"Just got home. Picking up right where we left off, huh?"
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 19:36:35 2015 UTC,Well guess we find out early on if the Bullpen is shit this year.
Brewers,31mum1,Karlor,3,Mon Apr 6 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"This is what i get for giving the cubs so much shit last night, isnt it?"
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 19:44:16 2015 UTC,It's not even the 5th inning yet...
Brewers,31mum1,urielseptim69,2,Mon Apr 6 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"Pace of game rules are great, arent they?"
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,3,Mon Apr 6 19:59:48 2015 UTC,I'm a Red Sox fan.....I just came here to say I'm sorry

Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,3,Mon Apr 6 20:06:14 2015 UTC,Idk what's worse: our pitching or the fact that we're making fuckin Kyle Kendrick look great
Brewers,31mum1,Redtitwhore,3,Mon Apr 6 20:09:08 2015 UTC,TIL Kyle Kendrick is the greatest player of all time.
Brewers,31mum1,MFazio23,2,Mon Apr 6 20:34:06 2015 UTC,4.42 career ERA. That's Brewer killing numbers right there.
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,3,Mon Apr 6 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"I'm regretting my derisive comment prior to the game of ""Kyle Kendrick?  That's their Opening Day starter?""  Oops."
Brewers,31mum1,hyperbolical,3,Mon Apr 6 20:48:43 2015 UTC,You bastard.
Brewers,31mum1,dnalur,3,Mon Apr 6 20:53:31 2015 UTC,Well that was painful. Off to /r/collegebasketball!

Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,2,Mon Apr 6 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"So excited for this year, let's start this year off right!! Go brew crew!!!"
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,2,Mon Apr 6 18:10:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Kendrick started in Braun's 3 HR game last year
Brewers,31mum1,Bullwine85,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right about that: http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_04_08_milmlb_phimlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=phi  Lohse v. Kendrick again.. rematch from last year!"
Brewers,31mum1,eray21,2,Mon Apr 6 18:16:23 2015 UTC,Lohse is a bit shaky to start out
Brewers,31mum1,cyan101,2,Mon Apr 6 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"Damn, there goes Lohse's no hitter."
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,2,Mon Apr 6 18:24:38 2015 UTC,Time to break out the jack and coke
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,2,Mon Apr 6 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"Ugh, not a good start.."
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"Someone at the game better be yelling ""BOOOO, CHEATERRRR"" when Braun comes up.  Were going to need the HRs today ._."

Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"MLB.tv is has a 3 second delay from updates on my phone so I can just get sad before the pitch even happens. Hopefully it also means I can get real excited before a pitch happens in the bottom of the inning. Also, god dammit."
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,2,Mon Apr 6 18:35:29 2015 UTC,I'm sorry guys I was the reason for the bad start. Haven't cracked a beer yet. Changing that now
Brewers,31mum1,smiles134,2,Mon Apr 6 18:37:08 2015 UTC,That first AB for us seems fitting for how the top-half of the inning went.
Brewers,31mum1,b-VW,2,Mon Apr 6 18:41:53 2015 UTC,Ugh
Brewers,31mum1,dutchoven21,2,Mon Apr 6 18:47:50 2015 UTC,Cheers boys. Here's to a fun and victorious 6 months!
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 18:48:12 2015 UTC,Let's just hope Lohse can get that same pitch called a strike.
Brewers,31mum1,jn2010,2,Mon Apr 6 18:49:55 2015 UTC,Alright Lohse I still love ya. Just get us through a few scoreless plz
Brewers,31mum1,smiles134,2,Mon Apr 6 18:50:30 2015 UTC,Only a single!  Progress!
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 18:52:27 2015 UTC,God damnit

Brewers,31mum1,zinger565,2,Mon Apr 6 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can without the MLB app. If you travel a lot, worth the money for the radio stream. Pretty cheap too."
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,2,Mon Apr 6 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"This is what I do, living in Cedar Rapids, IA. It was, I believe, $20 for the ENTIRE season. Well worth it."
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"There we go!  Now just a few more bloops and a blast, right?"
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,2,Mon Apr 6 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"Ramirez!!! Let's get this offense rolling now, fellas."

Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Gomez damn near threw him out
Brewers,31mum1,Morphenominal,2,Mon Apr 6 19:15:04 2015 UTC,Not looking too great :(
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,2,Mon Apr 6 19:19:36 2015 UTC,Oh boy. What a fun game.
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 19:19:58 2015 UTC,Sad trombone...
Brewers,31mum1,hyperbolical,2,Mon Apr 6 19:19:59 2015 UTC,Lohse is bout to launch one
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,2,Mon Apr 6 19:23:50 2015 UTC,It's not baseball season until Gomez loses his helmet.
Brewers,31mum1,Bullwine85,2,Mon Apr 6 19:25:24 2015 UTC,2015 GOMEZ FLYING HELMET COUNT: 1
Brewers,31mum1,smiles134,2,Mon Apr 6 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, Carlos Gomez corkscrewing himself into the ground. Haven't seen that before"
Brewers,31mum1,Morphenominal,2,Mon Apr 6 19:25:46 2015 UTC,Richie Sexson could probably improve this team.
Brewers,31mum1,ccruner13,2,Mon Apr 6 19:30:59 2015 UTC,OK I'm done. This is just depressing.
Brewers,31mum1,fly1ngorb,2,Mon Apr 6 19:31:51 2015 UTC,Just need some TOOTBLANs to go with these DPs and HRs to really make it a Brewers game.
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"As we said every day last September, tomorrow is a new day."
Brewers,31mum1,gopher33j,2,Mon Apr 6 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Idk who the hell Blazek is, but I suppose he can't be worse...right?"
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 19:37:43 2015 UTC,Incorrect.
Brewers,31mum1,vNatural,2,Mon Apr 6 19:50:21 2015 UTC,We look like shit.
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 19:43:03 2015 UTC,420 Blazek
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,2,Mon Apr 6 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Ayy lmao. At this point, I just want to see how much we can lose by. Try to have some fun with it."
Brewers,31mum1,Puckfan21,2,Mon Apr 6 19:46:30 2015 UTC,Oh and even better I just found out the paper I'm grading is plagiarized as fuck!n ozbjddfhjs0dhubifk esgyee8hugkj
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,3,Mon Apr 6 19:47:44 2015 UTC,easy peasey? instant F
Brewers,31mum1,MurDoct,2,Mon Apr 6 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Now I have to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that this shit was plagiarized, including going to an academic dishonesty meeting and pleading the case with the evidence I have. Much more time than to just grade a shitty paper. ;("
Brewers,31mum1,Karlor,2,Mon Apr 6 19:56:16 2015 UTC,What a better way to start the season than getting embarrassed.
Brewers,31mum1,NebThron,2,Mon Apr 6 19:49:32 2015 UTC,I think that put a nail in our run for a 162-0 season.
Brewers,31mum1,CJL13,5,Mon Apr 6 19:50:23 2015 UTC,That just means we're going 161-1 now.
Brewers,31mum1,BucksIn6ix,2,Mon Apr 6 19:52:48 2015 UTC,It's strange with how bad Braun was he was 3rd in homers.
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"STOP, STOP! We're already fucking dead!!!"
Brewers,31mum1,BricksAndBatsOnVR,2,Mon Apr 6 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Well I haven't been drinking, but I've been finishing this Easter candy as a way to cope with my tears."
Brewers,31mum1,gandaalf,2,Mon Apr 6 20:00:43 2015 UTC,"Wow I almost never turn a game off once I've started it, but this just hurts."
Brewers,31mum1,TheBause,2,Mon Apr 6 20:01:56 2015 UTC,Blazek may somehow have given up more hits than pitches thrown thus far
Brewers,31mum1,necropaw,2,Mon Apr 6 20:03:56 2015 UTC,I just want to score a run.   :/
Brewers,31mum1,ehrenj,2,Mon Apr 6 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Alright, time for 9 bloops and a blast...."
Brewers,31mum1,BricksAndBatsOnVR,2,Mon Apr 6 20:41:01 2015 UTC,i wish someone would invent a batting glove that doesn't need to be adjusted every 9 seconds. tulowitzki just took time to adjust both after a pitch where he didn't even swing.
Brewers,31mum1,k4melot,2,Mon Apr 6 20:53:55 2015 UTC,He doesn't need to adjust it it's just routine/superstition.
Brewers,31mum1,MyHorseIsAmazinger,2,Mon Apr 6 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"Well this is about what I expected. LOB, business as usual for the crew."
Brewers,31mum1,SolidRambo,2,Mon Apr 6 20:59:01 2015 UTC,Went through great pains to get a radio and to get it to work while I'm at work.  Now I'm crying under my desk. Only one game...
Brewers,31mum1,WDTBillBrasky,2,Mon Apr 6 21:19:30 2015 UTC,Just need 10 back to back home runs for a walk off
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,2,Mon Apr 6 21:20:24 2015 UTC,So that was depressing.
Brewers,31mum1,jubjub2184,4,Mon Apr 6 21:21:45 2015 UTC,When Kyle Kendrick is your opening day starter...you know your rotation isn't looking good.
Brewers,31mum1,vNatural,3,Mon Apr 6 18:39:28 2015 UTC,Well Gomez is still Gomez at the plate...
Brewers,31mum1,hyperbolical,4,Mon Apr 6 18:40:51 2015 UTC,That was the most Gomez plate appearance
Brewers,31mum1,zmichalo,4,Mon Apr 6 18:41:36 2015 UTC,Just missing a swing that knocks his helmet off

Brewers,31optp,CJL13,2,Mon Apr 6 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"It makes sense because it's brewed by Miller.. beeradvocate rates it piss poor and unfortunately beergraphs doesn't provide a BAR (beer above replacement, hell yeah, baseball sabremetrics in beer) statistic. Given it's a macro brew, it's probably largely extract/syrup based as opposed to a bit more natural. So I'd imagine even comparatively, it's probably not that great. A lot of macro breweries over the past couple of years have tried to tap into the craft brew market. See: Horny Goat, Budweiser American Ale, now Redd's.  On the other hand Riverwest Stein is amazing (confirmed with a BAR of 5.11 and great beeradvocate ratings). What a shame that it's not on tap.."
Brewers,31optp,SolidRambo,2,Mon Apr 6 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks like I'm going to have to learn about these new stats or I'm going to get stomped in my fantasy beer league. Thanks for the info."

Sitting in loge today, and always got stein from the stand right outside of 225ish - will be disappointed if there's no more stein. I am hoping for cans of Louie's Demise or Outboard too...."
Brewers,31optp,Nashwaukee,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"I saw a couple of the craft stands, 1 around section 112 and the grass hut place near home plate where they do mixed drinks but also served Stein on tap. All of those taps had been replaced by Redds. There are still good beers to be had from the cooler, like I said bottles of Stein are still available and there were others that I couldn't make out because I didn't have glasses. Still disappointed though."
Brewers,31optp,Nashwaukee,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:48:09 2015 UTC,Dang. That is ridiculous. Here's to hoping that they just didn't get the kegs in time or something and had leftover Redd's to fill the void?

Brewers,31nz8i,necropaw,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, ive been trying to think of how to get a reliable count on this.  I'd like to assign a few people, but everyone needs a few days off (i spend some days fishing during games, etc).   I'd just worry about an accurate count.  I mean...i have MLB.tv...i THINK i can watch the games afterwards even while blacked out (not 100% sure), but it requires some time.  Edit: yeah, i can watch the games after the fact on mlb.tv, which is cool and all, its just a lot of time.  If i had a few people i could really trust to get a total it'd be great.  I could always double check if neede,d though."
Brewers,31nz8i,skin87,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I really think you can just rely on the sub as a whole. If the counter is a thing, every time it happens I can picture a few different people will post in the game thread at the same time with the new number."

Im also trying to think if the app gives you the gameday audio package as well, or not.  If youre at a PC you can stream the games online for 20/yr.  I buy MLB.tv, so i get both with it.   I dont remember if theyre separate packages or not.  I thought if you buy the app you get the gameday audio, though.  Honestly, it might be less hassle than getting an AM radio if you can stream it on the PC."

Brewers,31kj5c,necropaw,3,Sun Apr 5 23:45:45 2015 UTC,Everyone has a tipping point.  We get drunk enough where having another drink sounds like the best idea ever.  The trick is to stay just below that point.  I have years of experience in the matter.

Normally it'd be the Cubs, but now that they might be good this year, I wasn't sure. After checking my fantasy team, I saw that I had Wainwright starting so I went with the Cards.   Ftr, I inherited this team as part of a keeper league. He was one of the team's keepers, and I decided to leave that be. There are 12 teams and each has 4 keepers, so after the first round pickings are slim. Yes, I'm trying to justify why I have a Cardinal on my fantasy team. Sorry."

Sure their fans are annoying and self-righteous, and their team does so much damn winning, but they know their baseball and aren't total assholes.  The Cubs? If they ever won the World Series, they would never shut up about it, especially to us. Hearing Go Cubs Go everywhere, Cubs ""W"" flags everywhere....it's a nightmare. And god forbid they ever won a playoff series vs. the Brewers at Miller Park. The Cards one was bad enough, if the Cubs ever did it I'd puke."
Brewers,31msl6,ecpackers,2,Mon Apr 6 14:53:21 2015 UTC,"The pitching is going to be the deciding factor.  If everyone lives up to their potential and we dont have injuries, we could make it to the playoffs.  If that doesnt happen...yeah, probably about the same record as last year.

Brewers,31gkaf,broke_ass_brock,6,Sat Apr 4 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'll try to fill you in on some basics. You picked a bad night for this, with the Badger game on. Hopefully some people will be on Sunday to either correct me or add to this.  The Brewers started in 1969 as the Seattle Pilots. After one season, they were bought buy a group of businessmen led by Bud Selig and moved to Milwaukee. Basically the 1982 team is legendary. They're the only Brewers squad to ever make the World Series, where we lost to St. Louis (We were in the American League up until 1998). We did not make the playoffs again till 2008, when in midseason we traded a handful of prospects for CC Sabbathia. This was huge, as he figuratively carried the team on his back for our first playoff berth in 26 years. We returned in 2011 (edit: fixed the year), led by our stars Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun, where we eventually lost to St. Louis in the NLCS.  The Brewers are currently owned by Mark Attanasio. They played at County Stadium from 1969-2000, and then moved to Miller Park in 2001. As for unique stadium experiences, we are known for having the best tailgating in baseball, which at times can rival some college football tailgates. We have a mascot named Bernie Brewer, who slides down a slide in the park after the Brewers hit a home run. We also host Sausage Races and sing Roll Out the Barrel during the 7th inning stretch.  Historically, Robin Yount is the most beloved player, he spent his entire career with the Brewers and is a hall of famer. Paul Molitor is the only other hall of famer to play the majority of his games as a Brewer. Our radio announcer, Bob Uecker, is also in the hall for his broadcasting. He is a Milwaukee native, and had a brief career as a catcher in the 50's. He's been with the Brewers since the early 70's, and is quite the comedian, having appeared on Johnny Carson about a 100 times, done Miller Lite commercials, had a tv show in Mr. Belvedere, and played a role in the movie Major League.   Currently, center fielder Carlos Gomez and catcher Jonathon Lucroy are the most talented and popular players, although we are all hoping our controversial former MVP Ryan Braun can return to form.   As for the rest of the squad, we have decent established pitchers in Matt Garza and Kyle Lohse, a good young guy who could become an ace someday in Wily Peralta, another young developing guy in Jimmy Nelson, and a solid back end of the rotation guy in Mike Fiers. Overall, our starting pitching is solid in my opinion. Not great, but not bad.  We've had a revolving door at first base ever since Prince Fielder left in free agency. We traded for Adam Lind in the offseason, so we'll see how well he does. We have young guys in the middle of the infield in Ryan (Scooter) Gennet and Jean Segura. Scooter cannot hit lefties to save his life, but other than that he does fine. Segura is very talented defensively, but he regressed a bit on offense last year after a stellar rookie season two years ago. Third baseman Aramis Ramirez has had a long, respectable career, and has announced his plans for retirement at the end of this season. He's our number 4 guy and power hitter. Our outfield is pretty good, between Gomez, Braun, Khris Davis, and Gerardo Parra. Gomez and Braun are both All-stars and MVP-caliber players. Gerardo Parra is a great defensive outfielder, while Davis has a good bat for the middle of the order. Our catchers are Lucroy and Martin Maldonado. Lucroy was an MVP candidate last year, and is one of those rare catchers who is good both offensively and defensively. He is widely considered the 3rd best in the league, behind Yadier Molina and Buster Posey. Lucroy also has the reputation of being an excellent pitch framer. Maldonado is a good defensive catcher, but not that great on offense, which is about all you can ask for in a backup catcher anyways. Both catchers are capable of playing first base and will probably spend some time there over the course of the season.   This season, we will probably finish around 3rd in the NL Central. Barring some pleasant surprises (like the first half of last year), we just don't have the talent right now to compete for the playoffs. Our farm system has been depleted from trading for major contributors for our previous playoff runs, and will take a few year to replenish. I don't regret that though, the trades were bold moves that nearly got us to the World Series, and they gave us some of the best and most exciting Brewers teams I have been alive to see.  Anyways, it's like 4am now, so I'm gonna get some shuteye. Welcome to Brewers fandom!"

You will be privy to THE best food and atmosphere anywhere in the Major Leagues. You will tailgate when you visit Miller Park at some point in your life and you will enjoy it. Sausages aren't always meant for eating; sometimes you gotta race 'em. You got Orioles and Cardinals, but you can't beat a Robin. Get up, Get up, Get Outta Here, Gone. Bob Uecker.  Con's? Don't expect success, but when it comes, it will be all the more sweeter. We have one tough division year in, year out. We don't have a back-and-forth rivalry with anyone; more like severe disdain for clubs that consequently are indifferent to us. Those damn Cardinals..."

Brewers,31gkaf,Bernie_Brewer,2,Sat Apr 4 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"I am also a fairly young Brewers fan, this will be my third season following the Crew. First off, welcome, a huge part of keeping me excited and a follower of this team is the community here and following the team. I'm from and grew up in Atlanta, so when people ask I chose the team because the Braves started up in Milwaukee. Honestly, I love beer and knew if I was going to follow baseball I needed to pick a small market team outside of my division to get back into the sport, I had to work for it. I can say that I have loved working for it following this team.  On MLB.TV I have nearly no blackouts, when they come to Atlanta I can get to every game for cheap and see visiting BP and get autographs and meet players with not many others around (I went to see a Boston game last year and there were at least 200 people looking for autographs, when I went to see the Crew I was one of 5 people and got to have a conversation with Gomez.) and like has been stated already you'll be hard pressed to have someone say you're on a bandwagon.   As far as general information I've not seen in the thread yet, Hank is a cool pup we met last year at spring training and he's just adorable. And this year Barrelman returns, he's a keg person. That's awesome.  So, welcome, hangout during game chats and with The Show you should pretty quickly pick up on who to look for and where. This is a really good community and always remember ""Fuck the cards."""

According to the Brewers association, any brewery that is more than 25% owned by a major alcohol industry member cannot, by definition, be considered a craft beer.  The fact that they have some local only beers is irrelevant."
Brewers,31bblg,snackshack,-2,Fri Apr 3 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, but it started as a craft beer and nothing has changed besides the owners. The same people are still making it using the same ingredients. It's still a craft beer for all intents and purposes."

The Brewmaster(Greg Hall) left the company after inbev bought them, so it's not the same people making the beer.  As for ingredients, there's actually no way for any of us to know that. We'd just have to assume they left everything the same.  Edit: I'm not trying to demean the company. They make great beer.

Brewers,31d7tc,SolidRambo,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"I felt after the 2013 playoff run the Pirates would regress and not make the playoffs. To a certain extent I was right, they did seemingly regress (only a bit) but were still able to produce when necessary and grab the wildcard again. This year I'm not as confident in saying they won't make the playoffs.  The Reds, I have no clue where they stand. They're kind of an aging team, Cueto is likely gone after next season. They could be good, they could be bad, it all seems to depend on the first half of the season."

Brewers,30ulzz,roughbeard368,2,Tue Mar 31 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"This seems to sum up everything pretty well. Personally, I think tailgating and the whole tailgating experience is the most fulfilling part of a Brewer game. Its like 40000 person party.  Just make sure you come prepared with supplies. Grill, meat, beer, chairs, table, condiments; it's almost like packing for a one day camping event. Even if you do forget something there is always plenty of friendly tailgaters that will let you borrow their stuff, though being a Cards fan doesn't help this situation.  EDIT: Totally forgot to mention Friday's long island iced tea's! If you're looking for good drinks and think $8 for a beer is too much these long islands are great (and have a lot of alcohol)"

Brewers,30ulzz,MiltownKBs,2,Mon Mar 30 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  I went to STL for a Brewers cards game a few years ago.  It was the summer Albert left.  We had a great time and your fans were all nice to us in our Brewers gear.  I hope Brewers fans treat you well.  We have good food at the ballpark.  It sounds stupid, but the roasted nuts are to die for.  You can smell them.  Just follow your nose.    We also have a huge hot dog / brat creation that is a sloppy good mess.  It is called The Beast.  http://gamedayr.com/sports/photo-brewers-the-beast-hot-dog/  I would also suggest trying to get into the 300 club either before, after, or during the game.  It is a nice experience and they have great (but over-priced) food.  That is in left field.  It is the big windows you see in left.  Be sure to arrive to our park early.  Grab some brats and some Lakefront beer of various flavors.  Their IPA, Riverwest Stein, and the East Side Dark are great.  Best beer in Milwaukee by far.  Bring a grill, throw those brats in some cheap beer (Miller) and some onions and boil for a little bit.  Finnish on the grill, top with your onions and german mustard, and you have great tailgate food.  If you have the time, Roberts Specialty Meats in Waukesha has some of the best brats around.  Look on the internet, and you will find coupons and free ribs on a stick.  Roberts is about 30 min from Miller Park, so a little out of the way, but worth it.  After the Game, do some bar hoping along Bluemound Road (North side of the stadium) or head to 4th Base on 51st and National Ave (south of the stadium) for some good food with fellow baseball fans.  If you have time, do a Lakefront Brewery Tour while you are here.  Maybe the boat tours will be running while you are here?  The boat tour will also take you to other breweries along the Milwaukee River and is worth every penny.  They have the old Bernie Brewer Mug from County stadium there.  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/sports/baseball/23cheer.html?_r=0   Maybe I gave you some ideas?  I hope so.  Have fun at Miller Park and the surrounding area!"
Brewers,30ulzz,MiltownKBs,2,Mon Apr 6 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for your tips and recommendations. I'm definitely wanting to do the Lakefront Brewery tour and the boat tour if possible.  I'm pumped to make it to Miller finally and catch a game..plus The Beast looks delicious.  I might call it the Brock Lesnar though."
Brewers,30ulzz,MiltownKBs,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:03:10 2015 UTC,Cant go wrong with that brewery tour.  Good luck with getting to all the stadiums.  My dad and I have the same goal.

Brewers,30u8x0,successfulbagel,5,Mon Mar 30 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"From hotel, 7 mins to Lakefront Brewery, tours start at 11, last an hour.  From Lakefront Brewery to MKE Brewing, 9 mins. MKE Brewing tours start at 1, last about an hour.  From MKE Brewing to Miller Tour is 11 minutes. Tours typically run every 30 minutes between 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m (according to their site). I think it's about an hour too.   From there, it's about 5 mins to Miller Park. Could be there by 5:00 at the latest. Gives you time to walk around the parking lots, check the people out and head into the game.    All times are from Google Maps, driving. So you'd have to factor in your Uber call times, etc. Parking lots open at 3:00 for 6:00 games, so you could go to the stadium after MKE Brewing and skip Miller and get more tailgating time. 3 out of 3  tours are doable, depending on your times, but 2 out of 3 is totally doable.   Also check out /r/Brewers guide to Miller Park (if you haven't already)."

Brewers,30b8up,asdfqwerasdfqwerasdf,11,Wed Mar 25 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"Hasn't this been the case since the Pilots moved to Milwaukee? I mean, seriously, Milwaukee Brewers baseball is great hitting and shitty pitching. You could use this title in perpetuity and you'd never raise an eyebrow."
Brewers,30b8up,FuckYourHype,2,Wed Mar 25 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting take on the Brewers this year. This team is either going to be really great, or really bad and I'm leaning towards good. I know it's just Spring Training but both Segura and Gennett have looked really good out of the gates. Segura is being more patient and his tweaks to the batting stance have done him some good and allowed him to make more contact. Braun started slowly but has picked it up a ton as of late now that his timing is coming back (after all, he did spend an entire season learning how to swing one handed). Lucroy and Gomez look the same as they did last year. The only one I am worried about is Ramirez and I hope one of the bench guys can pick him up.   The rotation is solid if they all stay healthy and take steps forward not backwards. If someone gets injured long term we are in a world of hurt. You know what you are going to get out of Lohse/Garza/Peralta and that's a solid front 3. As long as the offense scores runs this is a very dangerous team that everyone is over-looking this year.  Watch out for the Crew."
Brewers,30b8up,MasterCashier,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Wait. Strong offense? We have one of those this year? Yeah yeah, I've seen them banging the ball around the yard in Spring Training, but this is Spring Training, where the beer is cold, the sun is warm and the pitchers are juuuuuust a bit outside. I've yet to really think our offense is gonna go all wallbanger on the league.   But boy would I love it if they did."
Brewers,30b8up,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:06:36 2015 UTC,"Its not the depth that will be the problem, its the quality....  Lohse is aging and has less than stellar stuff, Garza is injury prone, Fiers is completely unpredictable, Nelson is still very raw, and Peralta is the only one that can be relied upon."
Brewers,30b8up,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:11:02 2015 UTC,Have you been watching the Brewers at all this spring?
Brewers,30b8up,MasterCashier,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"I dont need to watch them.  Hitters see about 90% fastballs in spring training, the results mean nothing."
Brewers,30b8up,workthrowaway68,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:10:29 2015 UTC,That is like the complete opposite of what happens in spring training. Most pitchers use it as a chance to work on other pitches they are trying to perfect before the season starts and the batters are trying out mechanical fixes in their swings which are clearly working for Segura and Gennett.
Brewers,30a7ft,MasterCashier,4,Wed Mar 25 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"Prior to the start of last season just about everybody had the Brewers finishing 4th, with a 3rd place prediction here and there and a 5th place finish sparingly. It wasn't until about June where people got high on the Crew, if memory serves me correctly.  Part of the reason why people may not be high on the Brewers is that they feel they over-performed in the early have of the season and the rest of the season was regression towards the mean. Another reason is the Cubs aren't going to be a punching bag this year, the Cardinals and Pirates are still going to be good and the Reds won't be bad. In other words, the NL Central is going to be tough; Brewers were 36-40 last year in an NL Central that has only gotten better..  With that in mind I share a sentiment that seems common here. They do have a shot of making the playoffs if everything goes right. Starting pitching has to go strong and we can't have weak spot(s) in the rotation, the bullpen has to perform like it did early last season, our main offensive players have to really produce. '  Just a lot of ifs, but regardless I'm damn excited for the regular season to finally start!"
Brewers,30a7ft,SolidRambo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:41:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. The Brewers flew under the radar for the first half of the season. No one talked about how great they were doing. Mainly because I think most people expected them to collapse a lot sooner than they actually did.   The division has gotten a lot tougher over the past few years and this year isn't an exception.
Brewers,30a7ft,BlankJebus,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. Pitching was solid all year last year, the offense just slumped. Braun looks healthy finally and Segura looks much better after the tweaks he has made in his approach at the plate. Gennett has shown that he can hit lefties a bit ( not anywhere near well but he CAN do it.) and with a solid 4th outfielder I think things can go really well for this team. I know the division is tough but I think they can handle it. In my mind the only team that made good moves this offseason were the Cubs. The Cardinals lost a lot more than they gained and the Pirates stayed about the same as well. The Pirates rotation looks pretty iffy too."
Brewers,30a7ft,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:00:41 2015 UTC,They did finish 3rd.  I'm not seeing them being any better than 2nd.
Brewers,30a7ft,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"I don't either, but the point I was trying to make (perhaps I should have included this) may be substantiated by the fact that they held onto 1st place from about the start of the season all the way into the last day of August. Nobody discussing the NL Central prior to that season saw that as a realistic probability. Point being, I don't think they can be written off as a 3rd/4th/5th place finisher with little/no chance of making it into the playoffs. If (big if) everything goes right, they have a shot at the post-season."
Brewers,30a7ft,madman86,3,Tue Mar 31 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"I'm most worried about our lack of depth in starting rotation. We really can't expect a ton from Jimmy this year. He will be like Willy 2 years ago, very inconsistent with flashes of brilliance.   If we play good, solid, fundamentally sound defense and limit the dumb base running errors (every run is going to count this year), then we have a shot. Even that shot is just at a Wild Card in my opinion, but we would be back in the post season so, I think anyone would take it, especially in the NL Central."
Brewers,30a7ft,madman86,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:14:42 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you. I may be a bit optimistic when it comes to Jimmy because of the way he dominated hitters in the minors last year. Jimmy has always had trouble taking a step up so I'm hoping he comes out blazing this year. I completely understand the depth though. We have nothing after our starting 5.
Brewers,30a7ft,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"And if we're on the cusp of playoffs, do we trade for another pitcher like we did for CC? We don't have the depth in the farm system anymore, so I think we're just going to have to ride it all the way. Sink or swim."
Brewers,30a7ft,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"No this is the last year we have to be competitive. We need to focus on the future now and build up the farm system. Last year was a good start, we had a good draft and hopefully we can pull some talent out of nowhere like we did with Scooter and Lucroy. Then we can be competitive again in a few years."
Brewers,30a7ft,RyanBraunsLeftNut,2,Fri Mar 27 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, man. I've been saying that all along. I keep seeing predictions of like 75 to 78 wins. Come on... playoffs may be a long shot, but we'll go .500, right?  I mean, we finished with 82 wins last year, and that was after an EPIC collapse. Most of the season, we were on pace for 90+.  And sure, things have to go right. But I don't think it's a stretch. I don't think it's a long shot. Starting pitching needs to stay consistent with 3 young arms. Braun and Segura need to return to form, and K-rod can't fuck up. If those things happen, we'll be an above .500 team and competing for a wildcard well into September."
Brewers,30a7ft,smiles134,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:02:49 2015 UTC,That's exactly it. I think the predictions this year are very low. I think everyone is so high on the Cubs prospects they are underrating a dangerous Milwaukee club that can really hit the ball and score some runs. The only downfall to this team is the lack of depth. if we have multiple long term injuries we are in a world of hurt.
Brewers,30a7ft,smiles134,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:47:38 2015 UTC,78-84 wins and third or fourth in the division.

As we were walking up to the stadium, one of us glanced over and noticed that Bud Selig himself was walking not far away from us to the left.   He had a coat draped over his arm and was carrying a briefcase. I imagine he was just arriving to put in that day's work. At the time, there was a very popular commercial, I think for beer, that featured a guy saying ""I love you, man."" I decided to say it to Mr. Selig. He laughed and told us to enjoy the game.  I've been a fan ever since."

I would rather have Rogers than Clark, since Clark is not one to take many walks, he essentially is a one trick pony. Rogers still has the power potential, but appears to have a better feel for his OBP. I would also prefer Wooten over Kinsler, since Wooten's peripherals in his MLB career is much better than you would think, at least it's better than Kinsler's."

Brewers,300qfo,bad_llama,10,Mon Mar 23 15:29:59 2015 UTC,I think a healthy Braun will be as solid of a hitter as he's ever been. But I just don't think he'll be able to stay healthy for an entire season.
Brewers,300qfo,n4ggs,4,Mon Mar 23 15:56:20 2015 UTC,That was always the issue. He couldn't stay healthy without banned substances.
Brewers,300qfo,workthrowaway68,-9,Mon Mar 23 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"He should still hit, but dont forget the last time he had a true ""all star"" season was back in 2012 and he was still on PED's at that time.  so its not really a true indicator of what he can do.  I agree he wont be able to stay healthy but for him to hit .280 or so with 20 or so HR and a .470 slugging percentage or so works. I would be shocked if he plays more than 130 games."
Brewers,300qfo,sjm1541,8,Mon Mar 23 16:21:56 2015 UTC,Wasn't it confirmed he only took PED to recover from the leg injury in 2011?
Brewers,300qfo,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Mar 23 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"""Confirmed"" by Braun, but I don't think there's ever been an official statement on how long he was using, or what he was using for.   Either way to say he was still on PEDs in 2012 as a fact is moronic. We'll never know if he was, but I'd have to believe he was tested on a frequent basis and obviously only failed the one from late 2011."
Brewers,300qfo,workthrowaway68,-6,Mon Mar 23 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"No, never confirmed.  He CLAIMED to have only taken them one time.  But the numbers dont play out if you look at it.  2011 WAR 7.1, 2012 WAR 7.3.  Those two numbers are the aberration for his career.  He used PED in '11, and got away with it in '12, it can safely be claimed that he continued to use in '12."
Brewers,300qfo,necropaw,6,Mon Mar 23 19:39:01 2015 UTC,He apparently only failed 1 test in late 2011... so nothing can safely be claimed
Brewers,300qfo,madman86,-6,Mon Mar 23 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I think its safe to claim.  He probably failed the test the same day he used according to what Victor Conte said about what testing can find.  Also, the fact that he was ailing for most of that year with little nagging injuries the safe leap can be made that game one of the '11 NLDS was NOT the first time he used.  He simply got away with it the previous times."
Brewers,300qfo,MissChandlerBong,5,Mon Mar 23 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"It'd be nice to see him over .300, though a lot of BAs seem to be going down across the league (likely due to the shift largely).  If he can stay healthy, 25-30 homers and .290~.300 would be really awesome to see."
Brewers,300qfo,Nadie_AZ,2,Mon Mar 23 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"This year, assuming he stays healthy, will be the test of how much the PED's played into his 2011/2012 seasons. I think the guy has the talent, so I'm expecting him to bounce back and be around 90% of that 2012 Braun."
Brewers,300qfo,MasterCashier,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"Such a good point. It will definitely be interesting to see this season, as long as he can stay healthy."

Brewers,300qfo,slamnasty99,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"Logan has always been kind of hit or miss. I think that the more playing time he gets the better he is but he will never get that with Braun, Davis, Gomez and Parra in front of him."

Not 2011 or 2012-esque, but 20-some home runs, 100+ RBI, and an average around .300.  Anything more than that and /r/baseball might lose their minds.  I wouldn't complain."

Brewers,2zv8um,_DG_-,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:26:39 2015 UTC,You might want to see if there is a bar with a tailgate trip and package.. Might be your best bet... Or u can tailgate and try to find one. Some people get too drunk to go in and will sell for face value. Otherwise scalpers will want alot. One for a reasonable price could be found.   Edit: here is a site starting at 45.  http://www.vividseats.com/mlb-baseball/milwaukee-brewers-tickets/brewers-4-6-1666853.html  Discloser: I have no experience with this site.

Brewers,2zv8um,xsists,1 point,Sun Mar 22 13:32:08 2015 UTC,I've had luck on StubHub on game day. Got club level for like 10 bucks over FV.
Brewers,2zv8um,Amoney8612,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:14:14 2015 UTC,Sorry I just sold mine for $65 a piece. FV was $30. Did you try stubhub? They have single seats going for $62 in the savages section.  Opening day is a crapshoot. It's the most expensive game of the year and it's full of amateurs and bandwagoners. Go April 7th instead.
Brewers,2zlm4h,brewisbrewin,8,Thu Mar 19 16:39:08 2015 UTC,It is spring training.  Calm down bro/broette.  They're gonna try all sorts of things so they have contingencies for regular season situations
Brewers,2zlm4h,gingerperson,4,Fri Mar 20 00:14:27 2015 UTC,"If he ever bats lead off against a left handed pitcher it will reflect very poorly on Roenicke. His OBP has decreased every level he's gone up since 2010, and he's shown he can't hit lefties at any high level.   Like you said, Gennett is a very respectable hitter against right handed hitters and could very easily lead off against them. I feel like in the end it will either be Gomez or a platoon. Roenicke is too smart to let Scooter handle the lead off spot no matter who is pitching."
Brewers,2zlm4h,sjm1541,2,Thu Mar 19 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed, no sense.  It should be Gomez.  Nothing better than the first pitch resulting in either a home run or the hardest swing and miss you could ever want.  Plus when he does get on he puts more pressure on the defense with his base running.  Gomez leading off last year was the one part of the order that didn't need fixing."
Brewers,2zlm4h,30rec,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:56:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know how you argue for Luc over Gogo. Luc should be I the #2 spot. He is a contact guy and can move Gogo around the bases.
Brewers,2zlm4h,madman86,8,Fri Mar 20 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"If we could get Segura to start hitting decently again, I'd put him there.  Davis isn't a bad option either. Gomez is a better bat later so he can focus on crushing the ball, or spinning himself into the ground- whichever takes place."
Brewers,2zlm4h,Nadie_AZ,8,Thu Mar 19 20:28:44 2015 UTC,Davis is not a good option high in the order.  He's  a lower OBP/higher SLG hitter that profiles as a 5-7 spot guy.
Brewers,2zlm4h,CM816,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:51:09 2015 UTC,"I just do not see a lead off hitter on this roster.  It is how Melvin builds this team and Ron must deal with it.  I am amazed that these two have co-existed for as long they have.  Their philosophies seem to differ.  The Brewers best option for lead off is Gomez with maybe Scooter or Segura or even Lucroy to fill that spot if Gomez needs rest or goes into a bad slump.  I do not know I feel about this years team.  It seems like the whole division got better, but the Brewers did not.  I just want to see them win a WS before I die, but I do not think this will be the year.  Also, hopefully Braun is healthy and we can trade him for some nice young guys.  We need prospects."
Brewers,2zlm4h,MiltownKBs,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"Also, hopefully Braun is healthy and we can trade him for some nice young guys.   I don't think anyone wants Braun or his contract."
Brewers,2zlm4h,AtlanticHiawatha,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"I think you might be surprised.  If he puts up decent numbers, there would be taker.  The only issue would be what we could get in return.  I hear what your saying tho."
Brewers,2zl8zs,SoSublim3,12,Thu Mar 19 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised by this, to be honest. At least, surprised that we did so early. I like Roenicke a lot, I think he's been good for the team while he's been here. But if I were in their shoes, I would've waited to see what happens with this season...   I suppose they're committed for him to be here during this weird sort of vacuum in prospect land. I wonder if that means they don't have many expectations for this season."
Brewers,2zl8zs,smiles134,7,Thu Mar 19 14:59:14 2015 UTC,Teams just like stability. I think we know that Melvin and Attanasio like him so this just leaves nothing in doubt for Roenicke. Things can get ugly with managers who don't know if they're back the next year or not.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/jim-riggleman-resigns-as-nationals-manager-immediately-after-a-win/2011/06/23/AG7yl9hH_story.html
Brewers,2zl8zs,sjm1541,2,Thu Mar 19 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, imagine going into work not knowing if your management has confidence in you or if you'll be gone the next week.  Takes pressure off both the manager and front office to pick up the option early.  And honestly, I'm not sure what kind of expectations are on this team in 2015."

Brewers,2zl8zs,30rec,0,Thu Mar 19 23:46:19 2015 UTC,Really? After that collapse? I highly doubt that collapse had anything to do with Ron thinking he'd be let go. Now if the Brewers suck this year the fans will RIP on the ownership.

Brewers,2zd4w2,buckyubadger,7,Tue Mar 17 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"This was a pretty fair analysis. I think their prediction of the Brewers' record is a little optimistic, but agreed in general with most of what they wrote. If everything works out, and there are a lot of things that need to work out, I think they can contend. Things just usually don't work out. I'm excited for baseball either way."

A player was on 3rd, as I recall. Khris caught it and threw it -barely- to the cut off at short stop.  A few plays later, a ball was launched to centerfield. Parra fielded it and a player took off for home from 3rd. Parra sent the ball into the catcher's glove not 5 feet off of home plate.  We just sat there, stunned. That arm. Holy crap he has a great arm. Even Cubs fans were complimenting the throw."

Brewers,2yu2fm,madman86,2,Fri Mar 13 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like our guys that won't play aren't as good as the other teams' guys that won't play. I'm optimistic at least.  Starting pitching is looking solid with Jimmy learning the curve and Lohse continuing his play from last year. Maldonado is batting well enough at moments to believe Lucroy will get more starts at 1st. Getting Parra into the lineup is big, but it seems like Ron has a plan."
Brewers,2yu2fm,whicker911,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"their defense has been a little shaky, but it's still real early. that being said, aramis and jean have looked pretty good defensively"

I'd love to see some more production out of Segura offensively, but with how he plays defensively, it's hard to hate too much. I'll take anyone that isn't named Yuniesky, honestly."
Brewers,2yu2fm,whicker911,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Won the last two and in good shape today after an 0-5 start, so it's getting better.

Brewers,2yu2fm,fly1ngorb,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"I posted something longer in the ""WE'RE 0-4 FIRE EVERYONE!!!"" thread, but the tl;dr version is that it's just too early to tell with a lot of people who won't even be on the 25-man playing right now. Once some guys get sent off the ST squad, and we get to the 30 or so folks we will actually see on the team this year, then I will be worried if we go a week playing like shit.  Luckily that's not for 3 more weeks, so we can all sit tight and look at the silver lining of the playing time these prospects are getting."

Brewers,2yu2fm,sniper84,1 point,Fri Mar 13 00:18:10 2015 UTC,I figured this was going to be the consensus. I'm an optimist all the time so I'm not worried at this point.  I just can't wait to go to some games when they are up in Minneapolis where I'm presently located.

Brewers,2yl9im,legit_,-1,Tue Mar 10 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this.  Wooten is the definition of nameless reliever.  His stuff is pretty crummy, his results have been pretty bad, and no matter his peripherals, they come as the result of the author setting an arbitrary number so that he can fit Wooten into his sample.  Wooten had a late season call up in 2013 and had a very spotty role in 2 months last year.  60 IP or not, its small sample size at best and those peripherals mean nothing.  Don't fall asleep on Wooten?  Wooten is the definition of Halcion Reliever on a team that is going to finish about .500.  My guess is that this writer gets paid by the word."
Brewers,2yjtag,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:07:07 2015 UTC,I might be interested. How does the scoring work?
Brewers,2yjtag,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"It is a points-based scoring system that is derived from FanGraphs ""ottoneu"" setup.  Basically, offensive points are meant to reflect a player's wRC (weighted Runs Created) while pitching points are meant to reflect FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) -- or at least the original formula reflected FIP; there's a modified formula that we use which scores pitcher performances a little more 'intuitively' (as it also counts Hits Allowed).  Anyway, on top of that we'll use a ""Leverage"" component for relievers with the goal of scaling the total pitching output by 2:1 SP's-to-RP's (as RP's account for generally 1/3 of all IP in the MLB).  And rosters are scaled 3:5 hitters-to-pitchers with the goal of balancing total team scoring output between the two different parts of the game.  But the general twist for the league is in the Head-to-Head setup, as ottoneu leagues are straight points leagues.  The basic idea is to score players realistically according to their own true individual performance, without weight to team or other outside influences (as much as possible, anyway) and combine that philosophy with a competitive league structure that is meant to better reflect an actual baseball ""matchup""."

Brewers,2yh3g7,tr1ppn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:00:29 2015 UTC,yes. there is. Its a separate payment though.
Brewers,2yh3g7,ccruner13,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with broadcasting rights, but I honestly can't remember.  In the unlikely event you can find one that has it on, you can go that route. If not, you can purchase At-Bat '15, which includes Game-Day audio, so you can listen to them on your phone (or buy them separate and waste $20, your choice).   http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat/purchase/index.jsp"
Brewers,2yh3g7,redman2532,3,Mon Mar 9 19:57:46 2015 UTC,I think WISS - Big Red 1100 is one station that has the game on.  I usually stream video instead of listening and it has been a while so I could be remembering wrong.  All my recents are from when I was trying to find someone airing playoff football.
Brewers,2yg62m,CaptainCourteous,17,Mon Mar 9 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's Spring. Who cares.  A little more in-depth, I've watched a decent amount of the games. The Brewers have been without Lind, so Clark/Jimenez have been over there. I think that is one thing that wasn't expected, and given that Lind is certainly better than both of them, that's a part of it. Lucroy has not been playing due to injury, which adds another part of it. Braun has been playing sparingly. Gomez has been playing sparingly.  Long story short of the last paragraph? All of the ""everyday/impact"" players on the roster have been playing sparingly (except Ramirez). Roenicke said that early spring is more of ""get guys in based on what their needs are"" for the impact guys, so in turn all of the younger guys/non-roster guys/people on the bubble have been playing. It would be very unrealistic to expect that group to perform very well.  That's just on defense/offense, and doesn't include pitching. So far from what I have seen, starters have been given 2-3 innings, and then it gets handed over to the bullpen to see who the Brewers want to put on the big league club. It would be expected that this group performs less than great based on the nature of the people fighting for roster spots right now.  The starters have looked pretty sharp so far. Jungman's curve is absolutely sick so far. Defense has had some hiccups, but I think that goes back to impact guys not playing/the conditions (Gomez dropped a routine fly from the sun the other day). The first week is really a ""figure out who you want going forward"" type of situation. If they are still playing poorly at the end of spring training/after April, it'll be a very different discussion."
Brewers,2yg62m,tr1ppn,4,Mon Mar 9 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"I've been to 3 games and here is what I have seen:  Scooter needs to get in playing 'shape'. Too many errors. Just a few seasons ago he was diving all over for plays. Now? Nope. However, having said that, I watched Reynolds and Overbay mail it in last year and they were fine when the season began. Scooter? We'll see.  Get rid of Logan Schaffer.  Hector Gomez and Matt Clark have impressed us. I want to see more of them.   Lind? Who is that? I really want to see him.  Our starting pitchers are gonna be ok.  Not so sure about our relievers. We'll see.  I'm concerned about our hitting. I was last year, too. Our starters aren't hitting well, Braun doesn't look near 100%.  But this is the first week of Spring Training. I'm not too worried. If by week 3 we aren't seeing improvement, then we can be concerned. I've seen Spring Training games for a decade (at least 3 a year, sometimes as many as 10) and you just never know.  Just watch and enjoy games that don't matter! I've seen managers (on both sides) trying out things that sometimes work, sometimes don't. Sometimes they give up leads just to see how the young ones perform."

The franchise played in the American League until 1998, when it moved to the National League as a part of MLB's realignment plan.[1] As of the completion of the 2009 season, 698 players had competed in at least one game for the Pilots and/or Brewers."

Brewers,2y2d38,TheBause,3,Thu Mar 5 22:24:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. The announcer kept calling him Jordan
Brewers,2y2d38,BraveChewWorld,4,Thu Mar 5 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"Now I'm imagining a story where Logan plays by both names to get more playing time. Roenicke is confused as hell in the dugout. ""Where's Logan? I never see him and Jordan together..."""

Brewers,2y2d38,Hosko817,3,Thu Mar 5 21:39:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd rather them work through that here. Although over all I am a fan of aggressive base running
Brewers,2y2d38,spedoy,3,Thu Mar 5 21:41:08 2015 UTC,I think its more due to not having played in months.

Brewers,2y24ph,ohhhnooo,5,Thu Mar 5 20:20:10 2015 UTC,The MLB.tv audio package is something like 20 bucks for the season.
Brewers,2y24ph,necropaw,-1,Thu Mar 5 20:22:09 2015 UTC,I was trying to be cheap. I found a site but I'm not sure if it will be carrying the games regularly.
Brewers,2y24ph,badgers4194,4,Thu Mar 5 20:26:16 2015 UTC,The audio package is really good. I highly recommend spending the 20$. Royals are my second favorite team and I've been able to listen to them all the time the past few years. East to just plug some headphones into your phone and listen.
Brewers,2y24ph,LardLad00,2,Thu Mar 5 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"I got it last year and I enjoyed it greatly.  I can get the games via radio but this is easier than setting up the equipment to receive the transmissions.  By a fair margin. It also let me use my smartphone to listen to the games when I was in compromising situations. Can't tell you how many times I found myself with the game playing from my phone in my breast pocket while I watched my kids playing in the fountain or whatever. Good stuff.  And when I was sitting in front of the TV, I would get the game audio set up online and then I would use my DVR to sync the game so I could watch the game and listen to Ueck call it. Shit I just got really excited for the season...  This is the one reason I would consider moving to MKE..."
Brewers,2y24ph,LardLad00,3,Thu Mar 5 21:14:39 2015 UTC,$20 per season is cheap. That's 12.3 cents per game. Pay up dude. Share it with a friend or two.
Brewers,2y24ph,LardLad00,-2,Thu Mar 5 21:09:23 2015 UTC,It's not the cheapest when you have lots in student loans to pay off :(
Brewers,2y24ph,MrMyxolodian,3,Thu Mar 5 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"Dude $20 for the whole season is cheaper than going to any single game. Yeah, it's cheap.   I've paid off student loans and I know it's still cheap. Find one or two more people to share with you and it's almost nothing."
Brewers,2y24ph,jn2010,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"it is literally 12 cents per Brewer game. Or, $0.008 per game. I think you can swing it."

Brewers,2y24ph,ksprzk,2,Thu Mar 5 21:48:57 2015 UTC,I always used MLB At Bat. $20 for the season. I think it's better than just the MLB.tv audio people are mentioning. Just my opinion...never used just the audio thing though.

Brewers,2xy584,BrewCrewKevin,2,Wed Mar 4 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like a broken record here. But good lord the media will never take us seriously. Let's look at what changed.  Our only losses:   Our mediocre-at-best first baseman platoon, now replaced with Adam Lind, who could very well be an improvement Rickie, who, despite a few hot spots, barely pulled his weight as a left half of a plattoon Estrada, who was a decent pitcher who had a reputation of giving up a ton of devistating home runs Yovanni, who has been a shell of his former self and went 8-11 last year. Probably our biggest loss though.   We gain:   Like I said, Adam Lind at 1st. Henderson is back, hopefully in full form. Braun should be recovered from his thumb injury Segura should have his mind right after a lost child   And this is a team that led the league for the majority of the season. They write off an 82-80 season as if it was the norm. But without an epic collapse, we were looking at a 90-win season easily. As late as August. THAT TEAM IS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED!"
Brewers,2xy584,Iamthepirateking,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate, the team was out-of-their-minds playing above expectations last year. At least, in the first half. We had a middling June and July and then it just started to go downhill.  But yes, I agree. They brushed off Jean's personal life which was more than definitely affecting his play as well as ignoring that Braun had a nagging thumb injury that he got (hopefully) fixed in the off-season."
Brewers,2xx0ay,EzNasty,21,Wed Mar 4 15:53:49 2015 UTC,Miller Park makes a lot of sense but I wouldn't want the Cubs to use it as their home even if it was for just a year. Their fans already think they own the place when they come up to play the Brewers as it is.

They gave away the ""take back Miller Park""  shirts that game.  We were standing in the right field corner when some older Cubs fans started trash talking us. Well being 16 year old kids we decided to talk trash back. By mid game we had most of the entire right field bleachers yelling at us. By the 7th inning one group of Cub fans decided to come down and confront us. These were middle aged Cub fans so when other Brewer fans noted them circling us they joined by our sides. It was great and mostly all fun, until the bastard Cub fans told on us to the guys who take you to your seat and said we were flipping everyone off in right field and cursing.  We were kicked out.... Since that day I fuckin hate Cubs fans..."

Brewers,2xx0ay,skin87,2,Wed Mar 4 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"It'd be great for the state economy. It would double the jock tax collected for the year. It would also generate millions in sales tax, most of which goes to the state."
Brewers,2xx0ay,KEM10,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"It would double the jock tax collected for the year   WI's jock tax specifically targets the NBA, no Brewers (or even Cubs) salaries will be touched with it."
Brewers,2xx0ay,skin87,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"The jock tax already exists and applies to every major professional league in every state. It isn't a special tax, it is just a term used to refer to the income tax an athlete pays. Because they are earning the income in the state the game takes place in, players from visiting teams pay taxes for the income they earn in the state the game takes place in. If the Cubs played their home schedule in Miller Park, they 50% of their income taxes would be paid to Wisconsin instead of Illinois and all of their opponents would also pay income tax in Wisconsin.  Why people are so confused about this concept is the way Scott Walker proposed it. His proposal isn't creating a new tax. What he proposed is the state borrowing the money to the Bucks through bonds. The jock taxes collected from keeping the Bucks in Milwaukee would then go directly towards paying off those bonds instead of mixing in with the state's general tax revenue. Walker's ""Jock Tax"" proposal generates no new tax revenue. NBA players will be paying the same taxes they pay now, it simply directs how that tax revenue is used. Because it relies on borrowing and not generating new revenue, the Republicans that control the state legislature are not going to pass that part of Walker's budget."
Brewers,2xx0ay,KEM10,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:55:24 2015 UTC,"I know all of that, but the math behind the jock tax was calculated based only on NBA associated income taxes because those are the income taxes that WI would lose based on them leaving. So while more taxes would come in based on the Cubs playing here, that wouldn't be a part of the jock tax."
Brewers,2xx0ay,skin87,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"Walker didn't coin the term jock tax. In the context of his bond plan, yes - only jock taxes collected from NBA game would go towards paying off the bonds. However, jock tax is a general term that refers to income taxes collected from professional athletes.

Brewers,2xx0ay,CookieMonsterFL,4,Wed Mar 4 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure how that would have worked and how the front offices would be able to function normally if that happened. I can understand one or two games, but a season would be unreal.   Sure, its an extra field not far from your ballpark (still two hours). Sure, ticket sales and other day departments can stay at Wrigley, but there would be no doubt you'd have to borrow help. Grounds crew wouldn't give up grooming the field for the Wrigley boys, meaning they are working almost every day. But they couldn't do that meaning we'd have to let the Cubs or temps help out with the field. Not to mention the everyday pounding of the turf from double the amounts of games.   Then there's security, which would be a nightmare for the Brewers to oversee, having to approve certain aspects of sharing offices. Clubhouse managers would have to share offices, there would have to be some Cubs merch just sitting somewhere, which would have to be logged, and the storage of game used equipment.  It could be done by hiring or commuting some of the Cubs' staff, but man, what a nightmare. I know quite a few in the Brewers front office that would not have been very reluctant to such measures, especially security which has been a big focusing point around the league lately as it should be."
Brewers,2xx0ay,NicCage420,2,Wed Mar 4 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the Wrigley renovations for this off-season are around the bleachers and outfield, so the front office staff would likely remain there, maybe some sort of auxiliary office at Miller Park, but nothing too large. Merchandise things would likely be some sort of combination of Cubs and Brewers stuff during Cubs games, and standard Miller Park setups during Brewers games."
Brewers,2xx0ay,Nadie_AZ,5,Wed Mar 4 21:14:01 2015 UTC,This could work on some conditions:  They always lose to the Brewers  They always beat the Cardinals  They always beat the Pirates
Brewers,2xx0ay,Amoney8612,3,Thu Mar 5 02:55:55 2015 UTC,"I'd be all for it, except that it's just a logistical nightmare. If it was a 16 game season like football, sure, no problem! But 81 extra games? Just seems like a disaster. Cubs would have to play day games when Brewers had night games. Games would have to start at like 11 because..How long does it take to clean the garbage up after the game? I'm guessing it's at least a couple hours? Game from 11-2/2:30, clean up done by 5:30, restock food, merchandise, etc...Brewer game fans start going in at 6? Just doesn't seem possible to me.   Then you'd have to figure out where all the money goes. Ticket money goes to Cubs, probably. Who pays for the extra food that has to come into Miller Park? Brewers? Cubs? Double ushers, parking lot attendants, vendors..."
Brewers,2xx0ay,NicCage420,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine they'd work with the league to have as smooth a schedule as possible, though given that it's a random computer program that generates the schedule now, that can still be a crapshoot. I'd guess concession costs and revenues for food and drinks stay with the Brewers, with them also getting some sort of ticket revenue as a rent payment."
Brewers,2xx0ay,Ripperz,2,Wed Mar 4 21:15:51 2015 UTC,This would've been a fun situation for the schedulers trying to hammer out 162 games at miller park. (granted we play each other for a few of those).

Brewers,2xxiyu,brewisbrewin,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Nice and thorough. As always with these guys.  Anyways, I don't mind most of what we are doing. Bringing K-Rod back is certainly better than Papelbon, and there weren't many other reliable closers in our price range available. K-Rod has been alright.  And I know people ding RR for bunting and stealing so much, but I like that. I don't want him to change. Sure, maybe the advanced statistics show it doesn't pay off like it should, but I think it makes it so much more entertaining. I love seeing Gomez on 1st just knowing he's going to run as soon as he doesn't get checked. It makes the game more fun to watch. Bunting is the same. And I know sabermetrics continue to get more and more advanced, but there are plenty of ""intangibles"" (which honestly probably could be captured) like keeping the pitcher and defense on their toes, and distracting them from the batter at the plate."
Brewers,2xxiyu,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"Bunting(for a hit) and stealing certainly are entertaining to watch. But then again, so is winning ballgames. It's been shown over and over that the strategies the Brewers use in these departments don't contribute to that. When they win, it's often despite their failed bunts and getting thrown out at the plate when trying to score from first. And this may just be me, but I actually love watching guys work the count, waiting for their pitch, taking the walk when it's given to them.  I really think that the use of sabermetrics is especially important for small market teams like Milwaukee who need to maximize any advantage they can find."

Brewers,2xt4wk,workthrowaway68,6,Tue Mar 3 17:59:05 2015 UTC,"With little research on things like you have done (win predictions and stuff), I believe the Brewers will finish 83-79, taking 3rd place in the NLC.  The reason being, for as great as the team was for so much of the year, I don't think enough changed for them to do anything remarkably better than last year, and I just can't see this team getting more than 85 wins. I think they will finish +/-5 games of .500 at the absolute best/worst, barring injuries or unforeseen circumstances.  I would absolutely love for them to prove me wrong, but I don't think the Brewers have done enough to take the Pirates or Cardinals off the top, and the Cubs are starting to look very dangerous."
Brewers,2xt4wk,tr1ppn,4,Tue Mar 3 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think that is a completely realistic opinion and there is probably a better chance of a Brewer 3rd place finish vs a Cubs 3rd place finish, as they will be relying on very young players.  In the end I think the Cubs will wind up in third, and if that trade deadline comes along and they are anywhere near contention, they will make a big trade and do an extension perhaps to push them over the edge."
Brewers,2xt4wk,tr1ppn,3,Tue Mar 3 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"I think that a streaky Cubs team can easily take 3rd, but they would need some help. If they are in contention, I agree they would probably try to make a splash somewhere. I wouldn't be surprised if they were making a run and didn't trade anyone, though, in favor of keeping their young core together for future runs.   If that team pans out (and with Maddon I can DEFINITELY see that happening), they will be scary the next 3-5 years."
Brewers,2xt4wk,Tuggernuts23,3,Tue Mar 3 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I agree with this or not.  Yeah, we ended pretty average last season.  But when this team is firing on all cylinders (and yeah, it's mostly the same team as last year with the exceptions of Gallardo, Overbay, and Reynolds), this team could be a very good team like we were for the first half of last year.  Will the team be firing on all cylinders all season? No, we'll go through slumps like everyone does.  But I don't think it's too much of a stretch to imagine the cylinders firing more often than not.  I wouldn't be surprised to see us finish under .500, if the cylinders fail to get going, but if I'm being optimistic (which I am) I think it's feasible we push 86-90 wins.  edit:  This all being said, I don't have the best understanding of sabermetrics, advanced statistics, so I guess this is a prety layman's opinion."
Brewers,2xt4wk,tr1ppn,3,Tue Mar 3 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"Mine is pretty layman opinion as well, so no worries.  I totally understand where you are coming from. Last year, the Brewers benefited from an extremely strong April which they carried to the all-star break. After that, the wheels slowly started to come off, and then they replaced the wheels with cinder blocks in August.  I think that the end result from last season was reflective of where the team should be when baseball's crazy tendencies settled down a little bit. I do think this is a pretty solid team, but I don't quite see what makes them ""better than average"" enough to be 86+ wins."
Brewers,2xt4wk,Tuggernuts23,3,Tue Mar 3 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"I know that when I push my optimistic opinion, it comes with none of our projected starters (Fiers, Nelson 4/5) blowing up, Braun being 100% healthy, and Segura being closer to his rookie season than last year.  Scooter is going to need to turn the corner against whatever handed-pitchers he can't hit, and we need to find a righty-platoon at first to complement Adam Lind.    So yeah, a lot of things have to go right for my optimistic scenario to unfold. My point is that, hey, it could happen."
Brewers,2xt4wk,tr1ppn,3,Tue Mar 3 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"I think that the rotation is at the very least solid. Garza/Lohse have been consistent over their careers, Peralta is coming into his own, Fiers I expect to pick up where he left off, and Nelson should be able to settle down a bit this year. It's certainly not best in the NL, hell, it isn't even best in the division, but consistency is key when it comes to SP, and I think the Brewers have it.  From what i have heard, Braun is like night/day from this year compared to last year. I would love to see another .300/30/100 season out of him, and I definitely think all of that is possible.  Segura had a lot of issues last year. I really felt bad for the guy. I think some time off, and the opportunity to get back to just worrying about baseball will help. I don't think he will match his rookie year, but it will DEFINITELY be better than last year.  Scoots might end up platooned anyway, so who knows. Either way, as long as he's still good with the glove, I don't care if he bats .230.  Lind needs a platoon-mate as well. I think the Brewers want to use Lucroy over there a bit come the regular season, and put Maldy behind the plate when Lucroy is spending time at 1st. I'm pretty okay with this, as long as it's not a full-time deal.  A lot of things do have to go right, but I can at least see most of it happening. Only time will tell!"
Brewers,2xt4wk,Amoney8612,4,Tue Mar 3 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"This may be overly optimistic, but I'm going 89-73."
Brewers,2xt4wk,Amoney8612,3,Tue Mar 3 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible, but you would need EVERYTHING to go right, and then would need big overperformance from about 5 different players on top of Lucroy and Gomez maintaining an elite production level."

Brewers,2xt4wk,DatWasStrange,2,Tue Mar 3 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy with a winning record/.500 record this year. Anything nearing 90 wins is pretty optimistic, you're right."

Brewers,2xt4wk,TheBause,3,Tue Mar 3 21:57:30 2015 UTC,I've got them at 84 wins. I think they have a floor at about 78 wins and if everything goes right they can hit 90. 84 is right in the middle and that seems like a good guess to me.
Brewers,2xt4wk,Nadie_AZ,2,Wed Mar 4 05:50:41 2015 UTC,Same here but i will say 86 is what they will end up with
Brewers,2xt4wk,hippofountain,1 point,Wed Mar 4 06:42:32 2015 UTC,I have the range more at 79 to 82.  For them to hit your 90 win mark they probably need big time overproduction from about 5 different guys.

Brewers,2xt4wk,quickstop_rstvideo,2,Tue Mar 3 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"I think the worst thing that could happen would be for the team to be slightly over .500 at the trade deadline and 3 or 4 out of that 2nd WC spot, and have Attanasio and Melvin feel like ""if we make a move"" we can really contend then.  This sort of philosophy could kill the farm system, would be extremely risky, and any short term gain would be wiped out by the early 2000's seasons that would soon follow after such a move."

Brewers,2xl8dz,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:33:07 2015 UTC,"Thats a HUGE expectation from this team.  I figure they need to find 10 wins somewhere just to make the playoffs and thats even IF Gomez and Lucroy dont regress.  That hovering around .500 team also includes a nice year from Braun and Davis.  The problem is the pitching staff. All 5 starters are below average, and you cant be competitive with a staff made up like that.  Even with breakout seasons from Peralta and Nelson doesnt make this team a competitor."
Brewers,2xl8dz,adam7765,0,Mon Mar 2 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think the staff is below average at all. Lohse and Garza are proving vets that had pretty solid seasons, Peralta had 17 wins, and Fiers was outstanding throughout. Nelson is iffy, but he has shown he can be a major success. Below average is a complete underestimation."
Brewers,2xl8dz,sjm1541,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"The Brewers starters last year were pretty average last year based on their ERA (15th) and a little below average based on their staff FIP (18th). Take out Estrada's 150 IP and those numbers jump up due to his 4.36 ERA and 4.88 FIP.  Lohse and Garza haven't shown any indication that they will fall back from where they have been over the past few years, Fiers has shown he can have somewhat sustained success (not over 180 innings though), and Nelson and Peralta have the chance to take big leaps forward.   The pitching staff is only a ""problem"" in the sense that it may be their weak point if the bullpen pitches to its potential, but it's still not going to hold them back like the '09 staff did. This could very well end up an above average pitching staff, but everyone has to stay healthy for that to happen which is the concerning part."
Brewers,2xl8dz,workthrowaway68,0,Mon Mar 2 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"Fiers is the only guy even remotely projected to simply ""average"" the rest are projected for below average years.  And last year, only Garza was ""average"".  Some projection systems have all 5 of the starters as below average guys.  My personal thoughts, beyond the numbers is that Lohse is about 800 years old now as a sinkerballer in a big HR environment, Garza cant stay healthy, Fiers is an anamoly that gets figured out once a team sees him once, Nelson is basically a rookie, and Peralta is the only guy I would be putting any faith in."

Brewers,2x8ljh,workthrowaway68,3,Thu Feb 26 19:26:49 2015 UTC,No it's not.  Just keep it simple:  Does K-Rod make our bullpen better?   Answer: Yes.
Brewers,2x8ljh,itzjamesftw,2,Fri Feb 27 10:43:38 2015 UTC,"Everything the Brewers do is a big problem in his opinion.   Was K-Rod signed long term? No. Does his contract handcuff the Brewers financially? No. Then it's far from a big deal, it's as simple as that."
Brewers,2x8ljh,sjm1541,-1,Fri Feb 27 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Thats a good black and white response, but the bigger question is ""Does that money spent make the Brewers playoff chances drastically better?"" and the answer there is no, which then leads you to the conclusion that although the bullpen is better, it is not money well spent.  I could buy a Porsche and it would dramatically improve my car's function and ability to get to work in more style, but I cant afford it and it doesnt make me any better at my job.  And that is the same problem the Brewers have with spending money on something that really does them zero good in the grand scheme of things."
Brewers,2x8ljh,workthrowaway68,2,Fri Feb 27 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"The Brewers are a fringe .500 team this year IMO. I think we can agree that our 2014 record will be around our 2015 record.  Our bullpen had some gaps, Krod fills it. It's not a horrible deal. We had the money to spend, so there is no reason to let it sit on the books for 2015 and he will be off the books in 2017.  2017 is potentially the year the Brewers need to rebuild. Not this year. Not next. We're too intermediate. You still have to fill out the team to the best of your ability as an owner/GM and play like you're playing for the postseason. I don't know why I even need to type this comment. Point being. You still act like you're going for it to fill the seats, and the Brewers do have a outside chance (like last year) for them to get hot and ride it out for a while.  I don't think this 13 million derails our current or future financial plans at all, and by the time the Brewers need to really think about rebuilding the money will be off the books."
Brewers,2x8ljh,itzjamesftw,0,Fri Feb 27 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about the money part for this year and next.  But my problem is that being a fringe .500 team and spending money to improve dont really jibe well.  My feeling is that that $13 million could be better spent developing the scouting and farm systems so that when the rebuild does take place (a lot sooner than I think you think) that money is already at work, instead of starting fresh in 2017, pushing that rebuild out two more years."
Brewers,2x8ljh,workthrowaway68,2,Fri Feb 27 20:23:20 2015 UTC,6 million?! That had better be a team option in the second year...

Brewers,2x8ljh,wegottops,3,Thu Feb 26 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here, but at 13m for two years it's not that bad. Deferred cost and likely bonuses related to closing games out.

Brewers,2x8ljh,smiles134,2,Thu Feb 26 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"So it comes out to 3 million this year, 6 million next year and 4 million deferred. Not too bad at all considering there was money to spend anyways and they wanted another bullpen piece. A lot of depth there and if K Rod fails he can easily be bumped out of the role.   Could be a very good deal if his strikeout and walk rate stay consistent and his HR/FB drops closer to his career numbers."

Brewers,2x5fyf,legit_,2,Fri Feb 27 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Scooter has some curious 2014 lead-off numbers.  OBP as first batter of the game: .174 (23 AB)  OBP as first batter of the inning: .248 (110 AB)  OBP when batting in #1 slot: .351 (93 AB) ??  Also, take a look at how he bats with 0 outs... .228 with a .252 OBP  It seems his stats are much better when he doesn't have to set the table. Obviously he's not a power guy so we wouldn't put him in the middle of the lineup, but he hit .327 with RISP last year.. I'd say stick him in the #6 slot, but make sure you go LRL with him and Lind.

I had an offer for yesterday and it took me several tries to get 4 tickets in a row in the terrace box (I’m not paying $60 for a ticket in the loge level, and not paying $30 to sit with the savages in reserve)  Your best bet is to head to the arctic tailgate if you really want Opening Day tickets. If not you're going to be paying premium prices at a resale outlet.  IMO Opening Day isn't worth it anymore. It’s he most expensive game of the year and it's amateur day.

Brewers,2wxxd9,tr1ppn,14,Tue Feb 24 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee, in general  Check out the post by /u/ebauman below for a full idea of what to do in Milwaukee. The ballpark is well outside of downtown, so you'll need to get transportation to the game. Check out ""Getting there - not driving"" for more details on that. Personally, I suggest Bradford Beach (though it's usually packed on a nice day), the casino (if gambling is your thing), and the Art Museum.  Getting there   Driving   Unfortunately Miller Park is located in a very silly place compared to everything else in Milwaukee. Generally speaking, people will come in on 94 East and then enter the park via Miller Park Way. If you're coming from the North, get off of 41/45 South at 41 South. You'll drive through the outskirts of Milwaukee, and when it turns into a freeway, that's Miller Park Way (it's 20ish minutes). You end up on the back side of the ballpark, and can get into the parking area the same way everyone else is, but miss a great deal of traffic. I also swear by parking in general parking all the way in the back (the lot across the street under the bridge is a gem too). From the general parking in back, it's very easy to get out via side streets, or even getting back on 94 or 41 (the same way you came). Personally, I like general parking more than preferred for the tailgating and the price. It's well worth the very short walk to the park.   Not Driving   There are also ways to access Miller Park via bicycle or foot (Hank Aaron trail), and a place to lock up your bike. Motorcycles are also welcome, and have their own parking area. If you're looking for a bus, there's a number of bars in the area that have a bus that goes to the stadium. You can also catch the bus (Rt. 90) from the Downtown Transit center. Buses run every 30 minutes for 2 hours before the game, and for 30 minutes after the game. You can also take the Goldline (UWM-Wisconsin) (thanks /u/ContactPlay), Rt 23 (Fond du Lac-National), or the MetroEXpress BlueLine (Fond du Lac-National) all of which stop within walking distance to Miller Park. The bus is $3.25 for adults, $1.10 for children (6-11), seniors (65+), and riders with disabilities. Children under 6 ride free with an adult. For full bus details and maps, check out the Brewers Page on public transportation, Milwaukee County Transit System Page, the OnMilwaukee Shuttle Guide (thanks /u/KEM10), or call 1-414-344-6711 (24 hour automated bus line for MCTS).  Pre-Game   Tailgating   If you're going to a Brewer game, you have GOT to be tailgating. There's just no way around it. Bring your grill, set up shop, and go to town. Whether you have a tiny charcoal grill for a few burgers and brats, or you have an E-Z up tent with a gas grill and steaks with a full bar, it's well worth the experience. Enjoy some bag toss, a few beverages, and take in the smells of the game. According to the website parking lots open 3 hours before game time, and that time will fly by. This is the entire reason I like general parking more than preferred - I think the tailgating scene is better. In any case, tear off the bottom of your parking pass at the perforated edge (more on this later) and take it into the game with you. Leave the rest in the car, visible to the parking attendant.   Around the Stadium   There's a number of neat little statues/walks of fame around the stadium, all of which are worth checking out. You can also take a look at Helfaer field, a little league ""stadium"" that has home plate right where County Stadium's used to be. If tailgating isn't your thing, head on into the ballpark ~90 minutes before game time (during marquee games or summer, it's 2 hours) to check out BP, and the inside of the stadium. While you're there, make sure to check out the best seat in the house along with the Bob Uecker statue in section 422 (up until 15 minutes before the game - thanks /u/silentjay01). Fridays in LF has a full bar (and is open year-round if you're in the area), so feel free to stop there as well and get a Long Island (they're also open during the game if you're willing to wait in line to get in there).  Game Time   Seating   This is tricky. Where you want to sit in Miller Park almost entirely depends on the time of day and the time of year that it is. In the 400 level (nearly all of which are great), you're usually okay, but the 3rd base side can get a little sunny during the day, especially Bernie's Terrace (sat there for opening day a few years ago when it was in the 70s and we all got burned badly). If it's a day game, I strongly advise against sitting on the 3rd base side anywhere, as you will be staring into the sun the whole game. The 1st base side is much better. If it's a night game, or the roof is closed, it's not as big of a deal. Nearly every seat in Miller Park is good, so have at it! I don't much care for the bleachers (too uncomfortable), but they are an experience. The best seats in the house (in my opinion anyway, weighing cost vs view) are the 200 level. I also really like the corner OF seats on the 1st level, though you can't see quite as much from there.   Food/Drink    Eating   There's a number of great treats to have in Miller Park. One of the best deals in the park has got to be the batting helmet nachos. For $20, you get a full-size helmet FULL of nachos and toppings. It's enough for 2-4 people to split, and consider it a meal. A very close 2nd in terms of value are the brat/dog/burger baskets found around the stadium. You get your main and a heaping side of fries for less than you would pay for both separately (it's $10-12 if I recall correctly), if you want something simple. Whatever type of sausage you get (Polish, Brat, Hot Dog, Italian, etc), get a taste of the Stadium Sauce. It's the same classic recipe from the old ballpark, and it's everything that makes a Miller Park brat specific to Miller Park. If you're going for more fancy than that, the carving stations all over the stadium are excellent. My wife also raves about the baked potatoes. Don't forget about Fridays for the long island, and AJ Bombers. A really interesting thing the Brewers do is the ""double clutch"" booth (section 215, thanks again /u/cday119) that usually features foods from the opposing team's market. For instance, when Cincinnati comes to town, you can bet you will find chili at the booth. The food always looks delicious, though I've never eaten it.   Drinking   You can find a few stations around the stadium with more specialty beer than just Miller products if you're looking to be ""fancy"". There's a number of stands with Mike's Hard Lemonade, Redd's Apple Ale, Leinenkugel (brewed in Wisconsin, and including exclusive to Miller Park Bernie's Barrelman Ale), PBR, and I believe there are some other taps available at the ""craft beer"" stands around the stadium. If that doesn't do the trick for you, there are a number of stands around the stadium serving frozen margaritas (strawberry and plain) that have a stocked bar. Friday's in the LF corner has a full service bar with the best Long Island you'll ever have. Lastly, remember that stub you kept from your parking ticket? That's good for a free soda! Redeem it at the booth before the 2nd inning behind home plate. There's a concession stand right next to that booth, but the ticket is good all over the park.  If you can't find what you're looking for, just check out this handy guide! (thanks /u/cday119)   Special Features   As you likely already know, Miller Park is home to the Sausage Race that you may have seen before in the 2001 All-Star game. Yep, we do that ALL OF THE TIME. It's a huge deal. Be sure you're in your seat during the 6th inning to catch it!  Before the game starts, and when/if the Brewers hit a Home Run, you'll get to watch Bernie go down the slide. This is an homage to County Stadium as well, and is much better than that monstrosity they have in Miami for a home run celebration....  While you're there, spend $2 (or more) on the 50/50 raffle. It goes to a great cause (the Brewers Community Foundation), and usually sits around $4-5,000. On opening day it gets close to $30k+, and on Sunday games, especially if the crew is playing well, $18-25k is normal.  If you have kids with you, head on up to the 4th floor. Behind home plate is a little kids play area so they can burn off some of that energy! I believe there's a few concession stands, a team store, and a bar cart nearby as well. You can also find a ""guess your speed"" booth (at least you could last year) over in the RF corner, and there's a mini sausage race somewhere ,but I always forget where that is as well.  Post-Game  The parking lot closes 1 hour after the game ends, and there's a number of people who re-fire the grill to warm up some leftover food for the ride home. I have always had a great deal of success taking my sweet time to get to the car, as leaving Miller Park is usually a nightmare. Someone else can likely comment on easy ways to leave the park on the side streets, but I always screw it up, so I just take it easy.  Still have energy left after the ball game? Potawatomi Casino is just up the road from the ballpark (there's a hotel there as well), so feel free to check that out.  That's all I can think of right now. If something else dawns on me, I'll edit the post. The long story short? Enjoy the game! Miller Park is a lot of fun, and there's no need to worry about weather. Don't be a dick, and there will be a good time had by everyone.  Edits - for formatting, additions to food/drink and public transportation, and obligatory ""thanks for the gold!"" x2"

Brewers,2wxxd9,norwegiancowboy9,3,Mon Mar 16 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"I couldn't have said it better myself,  I too swear by the general lots, easier to get in and out of, especially the one on the other side of 94, off bluemound.  I'd also recommend the 400 level for games, if you can be up behind home plate you will have a great view and can usually get tickets for 10ish bucks.  My only other advice is on bobbleheads. Most times there's a normal and an alt bobblehead. Usually a normal and retro uniform respectively. Read the boxes the ushers are pulling from, some will say normal and others will say assorted. Hop to the assorted line and you've got a 25ish% chance of the alternative bobblehead. But don't be a dick and hold up the line, just try to be snappy.  Also if you have an extra ticket for an all fan give away, you can usually redeem it by the home plate gate after the game for the giveaway."

Brewers,2wxxd9,adamb10,3,Tue Feb 24 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee:  Most people don't take Milwaukee for being a happening city, but there is an incredible amount of stuff to do, depending on your interests. Taking off from where /u/tr1ppn laid the framework:   Lake Michigan / Bradford Beach. Lake Michigan is beautiful, and Bradford Beach is a fun place to be in the summer, provided the air and water are both warm enough. Get here early, as hot days will fill the beach up to incredible capacity. The Milwaukee Public Museum. This museum, not far from Bradford Beach (both off of Lincoln Memorial Drive), has fantastic exhibits year round. Next door, the Milwaukee Art Museum (featuring the big winged building called the Calatrava) is a Milwaukee centerpiece. There is a permanent large piece by the famed glass blower Dale Chihuly in this museum that is a must-see for any fans of fine art. Milwaukee Art Museum & Dale Chihuly Restaurants and eateries. Milwaukee has a vibrant and diverse foodie community, and this is reflected in its restaurant offerings. If you are interested in Middle Eastern food (a personal favorite), there is an excellent restaurant called Shahrazad. There is fantastic Chinese  (Emperor of China), Italian (Mimma's Cafe), and even Ethiopian (Alem Ethiopian Village). Of course, none of these are the classic Wisconsin food experience, which is offered by: Major Goolsby's, Sollly's Grille, and others. Plus also check out the  Milwaukee Public Market, which has amazing food from local vendors.  Bars. I could speak for hours on the bars in Milwaukee. But it's better to experience. Head to Old German Beer Hall to celebrate Wisconsin's German heritage. If you want things with a little more razzle-dazzle, hit up Water Street, with bars such as Two Brothers, Lucille's Piano Bar, and Red Rock Saloon (disclaimer: these are big college-age hangouts, so prepare yourself appropriately). There's niche bars all over the place, such as the geek-geared 42 Lounge. Get a hotel, and an Uber. You won't be driving (or walking) anywhere.  Events. Depending on when you come to town, there are amazing, world-class events happening all over. Join us in June for Summerfest, the World's Largest Music Festival. This kicks off the season of festivals at Henry Maier Festival Park which features Wisconsin-culturally-relative festivals every few weeks throughout the summer. Coming in August? There's the Wisconsin State Fair! If you come in August, and don't get a cream puff at this event, you're doing it wrong. The Brewers also have great ticket bundles for this event. See a game, and the fair for cheap!  Shopping. Milwaukee has plenty of malls (Brookfield Square, Mayfair, Bayshore Town Center), all with great shopping options. There are tons of niche stores in these locations as well.    And finally,   Gambling. Just down the street (literally, like a mile and a half away) from the ballpark is Potowatomi Bingo & Casino. With the recent addition of a high-rise hotel complex, this gambling venue has fast become the premier gaming location in Wisconsin. I've lost more money here playing poor hands of blackjack and video poker than I care to admit. Standard casino caveats apply. But seriously, it's a nice place."
Brewers,2wxxd9,KEM10,3,Tue Feb 24 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee also has a lot of brewery tours!  The Miller tour is pretty mediocre but the Lake Front Brewery tour(Link) is a must do.  $8 gets you the tour, 4 cups of beer (and usually more as people will give their cups away), and a pint glass.  The tour itself is awesome, there is lots of jokes to be had, including a sing a long at the end!  Be warned tours do sell out, so buy tickets in advance.    We also have great parks.  I suggest the 7 bridges hiking trail at Grant Park, it's right off the shore of Lake Michigan.  It's a bit of a drive from Miller Park though.  Finally, we have the Mitchell Park Domes which feature 3 biomes and are very beautiful to walk through.  They are a short drive from Miller Park, and are near Potawatomi Casino."

So if you buy a cheap ass ticket and don't want to sit way the hell up in the 400s, you can sit down there if you get there early enough. If you want to stay there, go with someone else so they can save your spot. Decent area for home run balls. I was a couple spots away from catching one at a bunch of games last season."

Brewers,2wxxd9,tr1ppn,3,Fri Mar 6 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"Let's just say that traditionally there haven't been enough porto-johns for the entire tailgating community... so people bring buckets to use.  And they obviously don't want to take them home... so they leave them in the lot when they leave.  Other people drive past, and might (accidentally or intentionally) hit and knock them over... and they turn into streams of... stuff.  Opening day is basically amateur hour.  Usually there are tons of groups of college kids showing up to get as drunk as possible and don't care about the game at all.  If they even make it in by the 6th, that's a surprise.  It's just full of tons of drunk people.  The second game of the season... MUCH more fun.  Same atmosphere and none of the shit (figurative and literal) you have to deal with on opening day."

Brewers,2wxxd9,TheBause,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add my two cents.   I went to opening day one year but we were only able to get standing room only tickets, which I initially thought was a bummer. It was an absolute blast, and I highly recommend it if you're going with a group of friends (not your girlfriend, or your family).   It was essentially like we were partying while watching the Brewers. And don't get me wrong, when I say we were partying we did this while explicitly watching the game. It wasn't a distraction. Rather, it enhanced the enjoyability factor.   Also, IIRC there are sections of seats for standing room only so as long as you have a ticket you can sit in any of them whenever they become available. Me and my buddies preferred to stand the whole time. So much fun!  As an aside, during that game I bumped into my trainwreck of a ""friend"" from work. He was underage at the time, was shirtless, and was carrying a bottle of peppermint schnapps. After letting me and my friends take a swig, he went on his way. He got about 10 steps when a police officer spotted him and promptly cuffed him. God that kid was an idiot."

This is our last year for a run, then we'll be rebuilding. But we have essentially the same staff as last year. A staff that held 1st place for the majority of the season.  Falling apart at the end is not indicative of this team, in my opinion. If they can play consistent for 6 months instead of 5... I mean, they've shown they can do it."
Brewers,2ww397,jn2010,3,Mon Feb 23 19:50:10 2015 UTC,Why is this the last year before rebuilding?  I guess I don't follow contracts very closely.
Brewers,2ww397,BrewCrewKevin,5,Mon Feb 23 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"Well, this year we got pretty lucky as far as salaries go. Everybody was signed through this year for the most part.   We lost Zack Duke and Tom Gorzallani, and K-Rod is still unsigned. So we have some work to do on the pen. Yovanni is a big loss, but his stats have been dropping. The only position players up were Rickie Weeks, Lyle Overbay, and Mark Reynolds. And Jeff Bianchi if you count him. But none of the core guys, so nothing terrible there.  Next year, Aramis' contract is up, Gerardo Parras is up, Broxton has a $9m option, Lind has an $8m option,    Maybe more importantly: Henderson, Jeffress, Kintzler, Fiers, Peralta, Schaefer, Segura, Smith... all become arbitration eligible. So their salaries will all go up quite a bit. That will handcuff us. This year we only had 3: Kintzler, Maldinado, Parra."
Brewers,2ww397,workthrowaway68,0,Mon Feb 23 23:05:31 2015 UTC,I wouldnt even call this the last year.  The rebuild should have been taken on two years ago instead of mid season and post season this year.  The unrealistic pov that the front office has had the past couple of years is only going to make the rebuild more painful and longer.

We lost Yo, but we got a couple of guys that management feels are ready to take a step forward. Braun is coming back from surgery that held him back quite  a bit last year. We got an upgrade at 1B. Melvin will find the bullpen arms he needs toward the end of spring training like he always does.  There are some big ifs, though. We need Scooter, Khris, and Segura to bounce back. We need Rami to be at least kinda healthy more often. We need the young pitchers to step up and be consistent. We need our stars to keep producing.  Either way, it's just sports ball. If we win, cheer. If we suck, then take a step back and laugh at it."

Brewers,2ww397,madman86,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:27:43 2015 UTC,I think Braun counts as an if as well. I think we should go hard until the trade deadline and start dealing if we are more than a few games below .500.
Brewers,2ww397,SoSublim3,3,Mon Feb 23 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not expecting too much either. If we are competitive down the stretch for a wild card spot, I'll be happy. We certainly cannot expect the same sort of start (or end) as last year."
Brewers,2ww397,Il_Tenente,2,Tue Feb 24 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I'm not as down on the Crew like lots of people seem to be. Like the others have said already this is the same team basically that held 1st for most of the season no reason they can't do good again.   Do need Segura and Davis to have some bounce back more Segura then Davis personally since he's a table setter for the rest of the guys. Health is a question mark so will need some bench guys to be able to step up when needed.   I wouldn't classify Gennett as a bounce back guy more or a break out guy if he can break out would be great. He didn't really do anything to say he needs to bounce back. He was a good 2B among the other 2B in the league. What we need to see from Gennett is how does he handle lefties now that he'll see them more regularly versus Weeks platooning with him.   As for the young pitchers if Peralta can build on last year and the others learn from the Vets Lohse and Garza we should get some good results. I really like Lohse he knows pitching and good work ethic on teaching the younger talent. Getting this from his days in St. Louis it's nice to have that around. Just make sure the other pitchers don't learn how to field their position from Garza baseballs will end up in the stands just trying to toss to first :)

Aside from a few above average players, we also have a big combination of injury prone, aging, unproven, and declining players. There are too many question marks. Will Adam Lind be the answer? Will Segura wake up? Does K-rod have anything left? Will Ramirez keep declining? How will Braun rebound this season? Can Jimmy Nelson fill Yovani's shoes? Can Scooter hit leftys? When the Brew Crew had Braun/Fielder back-to-back in the order, it was a difference maker. Two guys that could hit 40+ home runs, and drive em' in. In my opinion the 2015 team lacks power, but yet they don't have good enough contact hitters to make up for it. Until I see true improvement out there, I'm marking this team as a 72-78 win ball club."
Brewers,2ww397,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is we got through a lot of last year on top cause of our pitching, which now lacks Gallardo, Duke, and potentially K-Rod. Hopefully Braun can bring some offense back to offset this, but that's a big if."

We have Broxton this year, let's just go with that. Our starting rotation is where we need help the most."

Brewers,2wscss,workthrowaway68,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:31:09 2015 UTC,The exact opposite of what they should be doing with Thornburg.  His best role going forward into the future is as an 8th inning guy or a closer.  They should be grooming him for that role.
Brewers,2wscss,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:07:46 2015 UTC,Who is going to be the long reliever in the bullpen then?
Brewers,2wscss,bamfra,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:59:51 2015 UTC,"doesnt really matter, as this season is going to be transitional to the team.  They can sign a guy to a minor league deal and make that guy the long reliever.  I would much rather have Thornburg being groomed for that one inning role at the end of games for 2016 and beyond"

Brewers,2wlmra,BrewCrewKevin,-1,Mon Feb 23 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"On opening day you would be mostly with party fans, drinking fans, tailgate fans, atmosphere fans.  Opening day has very little do about baseball, at least in the stands."
Brewers,2wlmra,workthrowaway68,3,Mon Feb 23 22:09:18 2015 UTC,Its not only a game but a celebration of baseball being back.  Sure there are people there to just get drunk and party but any other game has those fans too.

Brewers,2wlmra,OrfeoKimble,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:25:57 2015 UTC,You are one of the very few who would go to that game and actually be interested in what was going on in the game.

Brewers,2wlmra,drunkenmunky519,2,Tue Feb 24 15:18:54 2015 UTC,"I guess it doesn't bother me all that much.  It's absolutely a party, and it should be IMO.  First day of baseball marks a shift in seasons in WI, and sensing that winter is finally gone and summer is around the corner is a good enough reason for people to cut loose.  Good thing there are 80 other home games for you to do your no-fun, serious baseball-watching at."

Brewers,2wkqqc,necropaw,2,Fri Feb 20 20:04:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would go to one where they play a team not in our division. You can go to a game and see Cards/Cubs/Reds/Bucs more often than any other team based on the way scheduling is set up. Not that it's boring, but it's fun to see other teams/players.  That having been said... (with a slight preference for teams that would be more fun to watch vs not fun to watch):   Twins Nats D-Backs Phils  Cubs 2 Cubs 1 Bucs Cards2 Cards 1 Reds"

Brewers,2wkqqc,tr1ppn,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would probably choose the Twins game, simply because those only happen like once a year at home. The Nationals game would be fun, too, if Strasburg is pitching that day."

Brewers,2wfrdy,theamazingkiwi,2,Thu Feb 19 21:03:39 2015 UTC,I think he is. But he's obviously keeping it very secret because Molina is probably Sith and he didn't want to be discovered before the right time.

Brewers,2whofg,bruh939,2,Fri Feb 20 00:05:56 2015 UTC,And one of our former prospects a few slots ahead of him in Michael Brantley.
Brewers,2wgftl,SoSublim3,6,Thu Feb 19 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if they could somehow swing it while not destroying the pocketbook. He'd be a viable replacement for Ramirez at third in a year or two, I think. That being said, it's very unlikely that we land him."
Brewers,2wgftl,smiles134,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:13:13 2015 UTC,The big market teams are likely to throw a lot of cash at this one. Sadly I dont think we'd get him
Brewers,2wgftl,wistoon33,4,Fri Feb 20 14:33:49 2015 UTC,Who would you rather have Moncada or one of the other talented cuban defectors that are out there. I know there is a pretty talented righty (his name slips my mind however) maybe build up the farm system with that.   Either way I wouldn't mind seeing the crew get involved on one of these guys preferably the younger talent and continue to build up our farm system.
Brewers,2wgftl,madman86,2,Thu Feb 19 18:40:46 2015 UTC,He'll go to the Yankees. They will throw more money at him than the Brewers could possibly afford. He will be the replacement for A-Rod.
Brewers,2wgftl,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"The Yanks have Headley for the next 4 years. When Moncada is ready he would likely be at 2nd, maybe outfield."
Brewers,2wgftl,madman86,3,Fri Feb 20 22:12:43 2015 UTC,Or Headley becomes a tradable piece for the Yanks in 2 years when (presumably) Moncada is ready for the Show.
Brewers,2wgftl,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:28:39 2015 UTC,Moncada would guarantee 3B is a position of strength for a long time after Ramirez retires.
Brewers,2wc96h,Monofu,2,Wed Feb 18 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't really see the need for that trade with the Rays after you had already acquired Lind.   Lind is only a year older than Loney and can hit right handed pitching better. Neither can hit left handed pitching so you'll still need a platoon partner at first base. DeJesus is just an extra piece that the Brewers have no use for with Parra around and is owed $6M with his buyout so you'd have to trade him like you said.   Also, Lind is only due money for one more year (with an option), while Loney is locked in for 2 year and 18.33 million and is not going to be worth that."
Brewers,2wc96h,sjm1541,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"Loney can hit lefties at an average rate. Granted, he strikes out a lot more (32K in 172AB vs. 48K in 428AB).   I'm a Jays fan IRL, and after watching Lind the past two seasons struggle with back injuries, I just needed a more secure option. Lind is below replacement level defensively whereas Loney excels. Plus, I didn't even give up too much. Aaramis had very little interest in the sim and I fully intended to trade Lind and DeJesus but there were no takers."
Brewers,2w8wtg,jn2010,12,Tue Feb 17 23:01:37 2015 UTC,June 17. Lucroy's grand slam vs the diamondbacks.

And when Nyger hit that walk-off, holy crap I flipped my shit.  And the anticipation leading up to it... my god. We got an opportunity to buy tickets to the series in the raffle. By the time we got logged on (literally like 2 mins after registration opened), all we got was ""3rd home game."" So a sequence of things needed to happen. A) we needed to get in the playoffs. B) We had to secure home field advantage. Then, if were lucky, C) it goes 5 games. We watched every one of those things happen. And on that day, we went down in the morning and bar-hopped. The atmosphere was INCREDIBLE."
Brewers,2w8wtg,BrewCrewKevin,6,Thu Feb 19 15:24:54 2015 UTC,Thinking about the beginning of last season is making me sad.
Brewers,2w8wtg,smiles134,4,Wed Feb 18 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"April 5th versus the Red Sox (shit, the entire series, really). A lot of people probably missed the game or were switching back and forth between the Brewers and Badgers so they didn't catch it all; both of the games ended at about the same time. Extra inning game, pretty thrilling all throughout.  I'm getting some pretty serious withdrawal, too. I might actually watch that game later on tonight.  Edit: June 17th versus the D-Backs. ""Hey let's throw the ball at Braun.. oh shit Lucroy just hit a grand slam, we're losing now! :("""
Brewers,2w8wtg,SolidRambo,4,Tue Feb 17 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"I'll add another vote for the game against the Diamondbacks. Perfect justice. They were literally high fiving their guy who got ejected for purposely hitting Braun, then on the very next pitch Luc hits a grand slam.   There were some other fun games. I think Maldonado hit the skin off the ball once which is kinda crazy, but I can't remember which game that happened in (against the Pirates I think?)."
Brewers,2w8wtg,PackerBacker50,2,Wed Feb 18 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"April 18th. The entire series is worth watching, in my opinion, because it includes Maldonado knocking the cover off the ball, Braun comes out in the top of the 9th to a chorus of boos only to deliver a 2 run HR and a blown save for Grilli, and Scooter's two run strikeout that got him to third base.   All were wins, too. :)"

It was time for the Brewers to move on from Weeks though. He'll benefit from playing on a team where both corner outfielders are left handed and he can DH if he continues to hit well. I have a feeling the exit from Milwaukee was mutual and he'll succeed in a new city."
Brewers,2w3y1m,sjm1541,4,Mon Feb 16 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"The author says he thinks Weeks is better than Gennett, then proves Weeks is one of the worst 2nd basemen in baseball over the last 3 years... Credible.   2 mil is a decent price to get a player like Rickie, but the Mariners haven't made the greatest decisions in the last couple years and need some low talent to round out their lineup."
Brewers,2w3y1m,ContactPlay,2,Mon Feb 16 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"In the AL as a DH candidate as well as being able to play 2B Weeks is definitely worth that deal.   In the NL, with his insistence he would only play 2B, his market is probably cut significantly."
Brewers,2w3y1m,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:15:57 2015 UTC,with his insistence he would only play 2B   The article discusses that this is not the case.  He will be platooning left-field with Dustin Ackley and playing 2nd on Cano's off days.
Brewers,2w3y1m,ContactPlay,2,Mon Feb 16 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm aware he agreed to play some OF for the Mariners. I was referring to Weeks' past stated preference that he only play 2B and how his market might look if he were to stick to that.   Even if by chance he turns out to not be good, or not like, being in the OF, as a AL bat he'd be much more useful than a NL bat since they have the versatility of using him as a DH."
Brewers,2w3y1m,fooperton,0,Mon Feb 16 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"lol, I think Jack Z doesn't have to worry about 2B depth anymore."
Brewers,2w3y1m,quickstop_rstvideo,2,Mon Feb 16 21:40:54 2015 UTC,By what measurement did this author come to the conclusion that Weeks was a better hitter then Scooter?
Brewers,2w3y1m,sjm1541,-2,Mon Feb 16 21:14:20 2015 UTC,"He definitely was last year by a decent amount. Going forward though I wouldn't count on it as long as Gennett continues to platoon. Weeks was better than Gennett against opposite handed pitching (143 OPS+ vs128), and was significantly better against same handed pitching (115 vs -28)."

Brewers,2w3y1m,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:08:47 2015 UTC,And yet he still was more effective offensively. It doesn't matter how many times you strike out if you can walk and hit for power. People are going to find any reason to hate Rickie but he was a solid backup last year.
Brewers,2w3y1m,sdogg,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"a 10 million dollar backup. that's why people hate. you don't spend 10 million for a guy dead last in fielding and whose bright side is taking walks. sure his OPS was .809, but scooters was .754 and he makes less than 1 million."
Brewers,2w3y1m,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:54:44 2015 UTC,Rickie was a sunk cost. It's hard to rag on a guy who went through the injury and ups and downs that he did. He just signed the contract and tried to honor it.   Of course Gennett was more valuable per dollar but my main point was people picking apart his offensive stats. Saying he was worse than Gennett offensively last year for whatever reason just isn't true. No one is going to argue he didn't play up to his contract.
Brewers,2w3y1m,whicker911,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"Good riddance to him. He was the first brewer to give up last year and showed absolutely no desire to play at all, let alone play well. You don't get a nickname like ""Shit's Weak"" for no reason."

Brewers,2vpjpr,umphreak2x2,2,Fri Feb 13 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. With Rickie being on the team for so long it's going to be odd not seeing him in a Brewers uniform this season. But, he drew one hell of a salary for a back-up second baseman last season and it's pretty clear his time in Milwaukee was over. Hopefully he finds success in Seattle this year and can get a decent gig on another team after the conclusion of this season."
Brewers,2vpjpr,SolidRambo,2,Fri Feb 13 02:47:37 2015 UTC,Rickie got shit on way too much over the past couple seasons in my opinion.   Last year he hit .274/.357/.809 with inconsistent at bats. Not worth the money we were paying him but $2 million over a year isn't a bad deal by any means.

Brewers,2vpjpr,necropaw,2,Fri Feb 13 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"It's probably better just to look at his numbers with runners on first and less than 2 outs. He hit lead off so much early on that it skews the numbers a bit since he wasn't able to hit into double plays at least one PA every game.  From 2005-2011 he hit into a DP every 12.86 PAs in those situations, From 2012-2014 he did it every 7.55 PAs.   2013 was his worst season with a DP every 5.15 PAs while 2010 was his best at 22.4."

Brewers,2vnsyw,roastbeefandcoffee,2,Thu Feb 12 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Melvin is going to pull some magic out there year, but I honestly don't understand why we'd put so much time and effort into getting someone when we have 2-3 potential closers right now.  Then again, I don't know who's left on the market that can be a reasonable pick up given our payroll."
Brewers,2vnsyw,Pagoon,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:06:47 2015 UTC,I think Melvin is just waiting for RAJ to break down. He has all the leverage and he's just putting in his time until the price drops enough to be worthwhile for the Brewers.

Brewers,2vnsyw,NickJackInTheBox,2,Thu Feb 12 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really not surprised they didn't bite. The Phillies have made it abundantly clear that they're in full on rebuild mode, so it wouldn't make much sense to trade a back-end innings guy for another back-end  innings guy. They're gonna want somebody with a ton of potential who will hopefully play a big part in the rebuilt team 3 years from now.  I hope they just give up on this one, get somebody other than Papelbon and go closer-by-committee until they decide who they want to fill the closer role."
Brewers,2vnsyw,SolidRambo,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:31:32 2015 UTC,I have a feeling the Crew is going to keep playing patty cake with the Phillies on this and K-Rod and/or Soriano are just going to sign elsewhere.

Brewers,2vmfp7,necropaw,3,Thu Feb 12 05:16:13 2015 UTC,"This seems like a solid deal for the Mariners. Bring on a player for a minimum of $2 million (4 max) that had a wRC+ of 142 vs lefties and was still an above average hitter against righties.  Next year he can DH and play left field/right field/first base against left handed pitching. He knows he's not going to get many games at second base, and I doubt he wants to be a full time DH right now so there's a great chance he's moving somewhere else in the field.   Best case scenario, he hits like he did last year and doesn't have the defensive limitations since he'll be able to DH if he can't find a position. Worst case, he plays poorly and they give him a measly $2-3 million."

Brewers,2vjhhd,workthrowaway68,-4,Thu Feb 12 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely puts a pause on the beginning of his season.  Catchers need all of the spring training they can get.  I have always thought that he would be a good fit at 3B defensively, although his bat really wouldn't play there.  Maybe this is their chance to try that out."
Brewers,2vh647,hrrsnmb,3,Tue Feb 10 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"I guess my first question is, why do we need a left handed spot-starter or long relief?  While it would be nice to have some mix of left hand and right handed starters, I just prefer 5 good starters.  Now in the bullpen, you would like a LOOGY and a regular left handed relief pitcher, which Cotts and Smith cover.  In terms of diversifying the pitchers, I think we are set.    We will probably grab one more on a minor league contract and possibly one other top tier closer-esque person, but it will be done based on best available talent for a given cost."
Brewers,2vh647,mrn1ceguy,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"This is a good point. After all, we had a good deal of success last season without a lefty starter.  This is more a speculation on what probably will happen as opposed to what needs to happen."
Brewers,2vh647,BrewCrewKevin,2,Wed Feb 11 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"You really confused me with the RP, LP and SP. I didn't read properly and was thinking that meant rightly, lefty, switch. And it took me longer than I would like to admit to figure that out...  Anyways... I agree. Will Smith seems to be the only reputable lefty on the team.   No way Wei Chung Wong makes the opening day roster- we had to suffer through him last year because of Rule 5, but he'll be in A ball this year I would imagine."

I think they really could use one quality LHSP and Smith is a really good relief arm.  They could use one more quality lefty as the 24th of 25th man, but Cotts probably does that job well.  Medieros is the only guy to really look forward to in the future, and he most likely winds up as a reliever."
Brewers,2vh647,gimmesomespace,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:06:40 2015 UTC,There's also a lack of left handed batting.
Brewers,2vh647,gimmesomespace,2,Tue Feb 17 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"Is there an ideal number of lefty bats to have in a batting order? I suppose every manager's wet dream is to trot out 9 switch hitters for each game..  It's true we have only have two in our lineup, and perhaps most would consider them only slightly above-average hitters. (I happen to love Scooter's upside, and remember vividly Adam Lind helping me win a fantasy league or two.)  But it's hard not to feel pretty good about our depth when it comes to left-handed hitting. It definitely seems like this is something our GM has not ignored.

Maybe Siggy, Scooter, Carlos, and Davis bounce back. Maybe Fiers keeps it going. Maybe Nelson bounces back. Maybe Wily takes another step forward. Maybe we sign another reliever or three.

Brewers,2vg3mz,_DG_-,4,Wed Feb 11 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"I think your summary seems pretty optomistic, depending on how they all play out.  I don't know why nobody thinks we can contend this year. Last year we were in 1st place the majority of the season, and we haven't lost anybody significant. Yo (who was sub-.500 lately) and Tommy G, but our core guys are still around.  And we were in first place despite having Braun with thumb injuries, Segura's mind not right with losing his kid, and at least half the team having significant slumps.  Fiers has HUGE potential, and Jimmy Nelson is coming along. We probably could use one more starter/long relief guy, and a proven closer. But we do have like 3 former closers, so one is bound to pan out, right?  If we can stay hot, we will be in it. That simple. We have the staff."
Brewers,2vg3mz,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Last year around this time it seemed that everybody had the Brewers finishing 4th in the NL Central and occasionally 3rd or 5th (moreso last).  They had the pieces and things went right for most of the season. They held onto 1st place for most of the season. If most things go right and they are consistent (Fiers, Nelson.. pitching in general; none of this on/off offense or games with many hits and few or no runs), they can compete."
Brewers,2vg3mz,SolidRambo,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:27:43 2015 UTC,As much as I want it to be true I don't believe Fiers has huge potential. He had a hell of a year last year but I feel that is his ceiling and we would be very lucky to get that out of him again. I do think that Willy and Nelson have some potential and that they are going to be fun to watch.
Brewers,2vg3mz,crunchy_nipples,3,Tue Feb 17 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"If Braun gets his thumb healed, he should hopefully be back to his old form, if not we'll have another .250 hitter with mediocre power.   Definitely looking forward to Braun bouncing back next season. If the Brewers end up sucking, a good season from him will be my silver lining."
Brewers,2vg3mz,meltedlaundry,3,Tue Feb 10 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"Too many variables for us to make a big run this year, honestly. If everything goes right we can win the division. But that's a big if. I think our rotation is gonna struggle out of the gates, and I think we're gonna be chasing the wildcard all year.    But it can happen. We have a good line up, we have a fairly good rotation (I'm not sold on Nelson.) and if our bullpen is healthy it'll more than likely be one of the best in the league."
Brewers,2vg3mz,jubjub2184,3,Tue Feb 10 23:43:47 2015 UTC,Lucroy played something like 135 games at catcher last year....if anything platooning him at first will give his knees a bit of a break.
Brewers,2vg3mz,internetsanta,3,Tue Feb 10 23:47:10 2015 UTC,"Wasting away my summer keeping too hopeful, which is why I love the Brewers"
Brewers,2vg3mz,Free_Willy24,3,Wed Feb 11 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"I have concerns for this year as well. I'm not convinced this team can contend (especially looking around the division), but I didn't think so last year either, and for most of the season I was very wrong about it. I think the bullpen is weaker than last years, I think the rotation is slightly stronger, and I think the position players are stronger. Even with that, I think the Brewers got the benefit of playing great baseball early, allowing them to play more relaxed and enjoy baseball for what it is - a game. I think that fact gets very overlooked in terms of how much it affects play. Near the end of the season when guys were starting to slump, the team looked dreadful, and they just did not rebound from it.  On your concerns:   I think Braun will be coming back much better than last year. Even if he plays at the same level as last year, I would much rather have him out there, as his experience plays a huge role in his value as a player. Segura had a sophomore slump. He also had off-field personal issues. I think he is a much better player than how he performed last year, and I think that he will be at the least serviceable, and very likely a solid SS for years to come. Yo needed to go. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy, but the Brewers have had an ""odd man out"" rotation for the last 4-5 years. The young guys need some time to shine before we miss what should have been their prime. Sardinas is not an insurance policy. Sure he has issues with the bat, but so does Scooter (from half of the plate, anyway), and nobody is knocking him for it. Especially at a position like SS (or even 2B), I would rather have a hot glove than a hot bat. Let the OF and corner IF worry about killing the ball. Gennett will be in a much more realistic platoon this year which should help his slumping. Gomez got a little too focused on killing the ball instead of hitting the ball (though his swings are so fun to watch). Davis had limited experience in the MLB, and the season is long, and the grind is tough. I don't think any of those 3 will have continuing issues going forward. Herrera had to be outrighted for Sardinas. I would much rather have it that way. How is the jury out on Lind's offense? He's been great from 1/2 the plate, and the plan the whole time was to platoon him. It will probably be a little more difficult now with the Lucroy injury, but I have no doubt Lind will stay at or above his career level. If anything, playing 1st will help save Lucroy's knees. I'm willing to bet that he would have spoken up if he thought it would shorten his career. He didn't, so I would imagine he knows his body best. The rotation would have been worse no matter which SP from last year wasn't in it. That's a given. Fiers, Nelson, and Peralta all can be major players in the rotation with Garza and Lohse, and I expect at least 2/3 to produce, if not all 3. I'll give you the bullpen is lacking, but whose isn't. Closer is an issue, but not every ball club can have an elite-level closer.   In any event, no matter how the team does, I will watch, rant, rave, discuss, and enjoy the season. There is nothing I look forward to more than grilled sausage, beer, and baseball."
Brewers,2vg3mz,tr1ppn,3,Wed Feb 11 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Your summary is pretty pessimistic.  Sardinas is not an insurance policy and I think a lot would agree with me on that.  This was at one time the Rangers #3 prospect and has always been top 10. He's only 21 and will more than likely platoon at second.  You can never have too many young, CHEAP, controllable pieces.   Braun at his worst is still better than a lot at their best.  There is no reason to be wary that injury didn't work and that he's essentially been lying that it is.   Gennett, Gomez, Davis had slumps but who doesn't it all just happened they got highlighted by timing.  The seasons grind is real and none of them have been in a playoff chase before.  If anything you'd think it will help their focus.  You can't also assume slumps.   Why wouldn't Lind produce offensively? Have you ever looked at his numbers against righties? That's all he will see.  Health is the only concern but I don't know why this is a worry.   Yo was a big piece of the brewers but we completely over look the fact that on many other teams he's a #3 starter.  His numbers are replaceable and the only way to develop young arms is to give them the chance.    Broxton is our closer.  Smith, Thornburg, Jeffress (eventual closer IMO), Cotts, Henderson (pending injury), Kintzler.  It's not much different than last year and last year there weren't many issues statistically.  Plus besides the listed there are several more strong arms battling for spots.  We have a lineup that can destroy a baseball.  Gennett, Gomez, Braun, Lucroy, Lind, Rameriz, Davis, Segura, P.  Bench of Parra, Sardinas, Maldy, and a spot between Hector Gomez and Jason Rodgers probably.   Your concerns are valid, but they're the glass completely empty concerns."

Now if they get him I know there is talks about his attitude and I also try to be optimistic that maybe a change of venue for him will help with that.

Brewers,2us3y6,brewisbrewin,7,Wed Feb 4 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"K-Rod. He's been a Brewer, seems to like it here, is more cost effective, the downsides (e.g., gave up lots of home runs) usually came in non-save situations/didn't wind up blowing the save, just giving us less of a lead. They both had pretty comparable seasons in 2014 and probably will have similar 2015 seasons.. take the cheaper one every time."
Brewers,2us3y6,SolidRambo,6,Wed Feb 4 19:28:20 2015 UTC,plus krod doesnt grab his crotch at every opportunity.  Also its kinda fun to see just how much dip one guy can have in while pitching.  You could be sitting in the front row and get cancer from that.
Brewers,2us3y6,necropaw,6,Wed Feb 4 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Papelbon fits our team. Sure, he has competitive stats. But someone with his personality in the locker room can hurt you more than K-Rod blowing a save once and a while. He's had previous cases of being unhappy and unwanted. I'd hate for him to get (potentially) pulled from the closer role in July and have a big price tag spoiling all our team chemistry and being a drama queen."

Brewers,2uk0j3,necropaw,21,Mon Feb 2 20:39:11 2015 UTC,"This actually works out pretty well for us.  Maldy is a more than capable replacement (great defense, and a decent bat), and it keeps Luc a bit fresher behind the plate.  It also addresses our need for a platoon mate for Lind."
Brewers,2uk0j3,meltedlaundry,11,Mon Feb 2 20:40:21 2015 UTC,There's nothing I don't like about this. And I especially like that we fixed it internally.
Brewers,2uk0j3,RacerX2727,5,Mon Feb 2 22:47:38 2015 UTC,This also gives Lind some additional rest throughout the season which is good due to his injury history. He should also fair better not playing on turf anymore
Brewers,2uk0j3,BlankJebus,2,Tue Feb 3 02:39:01 2015 UTC,On top of giving Luc plenty of rest from being behind home plate crouched all the time.
Brewers,2uk0j3,CM816,2,Tue Feb 3 05:55:14 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with it is that the alternative is to find a 1B platoon bat to face LHPs.  And it shouldn't be hard to find offense from that role that's significantly better than the mid-.600s OPS you're likely going to get from Maldonado.  I like that this is a somewhat creative solution, & that it's internal.  But let's not forget that this is likely sacrificing a significant amount of offense in going with Maldy."
Brewers,2uk0j3,userisok,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"This. While it looks fun, it doesn't appear to be practical offensively. Unless Maldonado pulls out a .800+ OPS season, I don't think it is a long term solution."
Brewers,2uk0j3,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Feb 3 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Lucroy needs days off behind the plate, so taking them on days that they are facing lefties makes the most sense. I have a feeling the Brewers were staying internal at first base, and it may have gone to Jason Rogers in the end if they weren't giving Lucroy time at first.   I think at the end of the day, the hit you take offensively is worth it in the long run to aid Lucroy in recovery and keep him healthy. The more he works at first base the better he'll get defensively, and if Linds scouting reports hold true, Lucroy will up the Brewers defense when he plays there."
Brewers,2uk0j3,CM816,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Lucroy needs days off behind the plate, so taking them on days that they are facing lefties makes the most sense.   I agree -- and Maldy could play C on those days, with the significantly-better-against-LHP hitting 1B option manning 1B, & Luc on the bench.   I think at the end of the day, the hit you take offensively is worth it in the long run to aid Lucroy in recovery and keep him healthy.   It's not necessary to take that big of a hit to the offense in order to rest Luc.  Not to mention the fact that we will need a solid RH bench bat for PH situations."
Brewers,2uk0j3,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:58:30 2015 UTC,I don't understand the logic in that. It's not that simple to find cheap talent off the bench who can play first base and hit well.   Is your argument that Lucroy is better off on the bench so we have a late inning pinch hitter for Maldonado? Wouldn't they just use Lind against righties then slot Lucroy back to behind the plate? There are plenty of ways to work around that scenerio where Lucroy can still play the whole game.  Maldonado is also an elite defensive talent. The defense that him and Lucroy bring being on the field at the same time is higher than Lind/Lucroy. That cuts into the offensive discrepancy problem you create.
Brewers,2uk0j3,CM816,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple to find cheap talent off the bench who can play first base and hit well.   It's fairly simple.  An example is a guy like Gaby Sanchez (signed with a Japanese team, but this is an example).  If you do some more digging I'm sure you could find two or three other examples fairly quickly.  Even in a down year in 2014 (overall OPS of .679), Sanchez OPS'd .746 v.LHP (career .863).  As a FA you're probably looking at a 1 yr/$4-5M type deal.  That is well worth the investment since it would mean keeping Luc's bat (as opposed to Maldy's) in the lineup as much as possible.  Yes, you can still rest Luc v. LHP & sub in Maldonado, but now you're just taking the big offensive hit maybe twice a month, as opposed to every time you face a LH starter.   Maldonado is also an elite defensive talent. The defense that him and Lucroy bring being on the field at the same time is higher than Lind/Lucroy.   I disagree.  I think Luc's superior pitch framing & game-calling makes him extremely valuable at C, and I'm not convinced that Luc will be a better defender at 1B than Lind -- Lind is a bigger target & fields left-handed, which is an advantage at 1B for stretching & scooping.  (I don't disagree that Maldonado's a great defensive C, just to clarify)   Is your argument that Lucroy is better off on the bench so we have a late inning pinch hitter for Maldonado?   My argument is that we're going to need a bench bat to PH against LHP in general, in addition to being able to use said bat to cover 1B v. LHP."
Brewers,2uk0j3,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to go that route the Brewers should just keep Jason Rogers on the team out of camp.   Maldonado is just as good as Lucroy is at framing and blocking pitching. he separates himself from Lucroy with his arm. His added strikes per game is on par with Lucroy, if not better according to certain metrics."
Brewers,2uk0j3,CM816,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"If you want to go that route the Brewers should just keep Jason Rogers on the team out of camp.   That's one option, definitely.  But if there's a guy with a reliable big-league track record v. LHP, I'd very much be in favor of spending $3-5M to bring him in.  If not, to your point, Rogers probably can be counted on for solid production v. lefties.   Maldonado is just as good as Lucroy is at framing and blocking pitching.   I'm not sure what the numbers show for framing value-added (I trust what you reference).  But from my simple... & admittedly non-expert & very much fallible... eye test, Luc appears to be noticeably quicker & better at blocking pitches.  Obviously Maldy's arm is way stronger, but Luc's looks more accurate (again, eye test).  I think Maldonado is likely the better overall defensive C, but I'm just not certain by how much."
Brewers,2uk0j3,BrewCrewKevin,6,Tue Feb 3 22:23:56 2015 UTC,"Good. I'm alright with that.  With catchers, longevity can be an issue if used everyday. This gives him a chance to play a few games standing, while keeping his bat in the lineup.  And we need a lefty half of that platoon... Luc does a fine job."
Brewers,2uk0j3,smiles134,4,Mon Feb 2 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've been wanting them to move him to a more regular first base position, so I guess I got my wish. We'll see if it works out."
Brewers,2uk0j3,TheBause,3,Mon Feb 2 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm actually fine with this. Maldy is a great backup (great defense) and it let's us keep Luc's bat in the lineup. Also, this will work to keep him from getting fatigued from a daily routine of catching."
Brewers,2uk0j3,legit_,4,Mon Feb 2 22:20:57 2015 UTC,Finally something we can all agree on! :D
Brewers,2uk0j3,OhDoYa,2,Mon Feb 2 23:40:35 2015 UTC,Most people would argue that being comfortable with your position in the field is exactly what you want. It allows you to act and react without having to think about it...
Brewers,2ukmfi,meltedlaundry,2,Mon Feb 2 23:20:32 2015 UTC,Part of the beauty of having lots of SS prospects is that they are some of the best form of currency in baseball.

Brewers,2ukmfi,gandaalf,2,Tue Feb 3 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be a fan of this. I think at best in a one for one trade, we'd get a mediocre bullpen arm. I'd rather see what Sardinas develops into."
Brewers,2ukmfi,smiles134,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Knowing Melvin, he'll probably trade for a closer. I mean, we're down to only like 3 on the roster, right?  In all seriousness, this could get interesting though. He seems like a good player, but we also have Segura at SS. I know he's a bit of a gamble after falling off the second half of last year, but he seems like he has major potential to be a franchise guy. So maybe our bullpen needs are higher at this point?  We'll see what happens I guess"
Brewers,2ukmfi,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Feb 3 00:55:00 2015 UTC,He might be insurance incase Segura continues to burn out. He might also be an option for second if Gennett doesn't pan out. I'd rather see them keep depth for those positions unless they get knocked off their feet with an offer.
Brewers,2ukmfi,crewblue,0,Wed Feb 4 04:21:14 2015 UTC,He'll trade for a closer plus he'll work it out somehow so we'll be paying 5m of Kemp's salary to play for the Padres.

Honestly though, I don't know why they purged TWO of their starting pitchers. I know people are down on Estrada, but he is a really good pitcher that just happens to give up a bunch of home runs. He is a tweak away from being a really valuable cheap pitcher.  Pitching depth is so important in MLB, just look at the Nats, they literally have 6 above average SP's now. Someone is bound to get injured & having that guy waiting in the wings is incredibly important.  The Rangers had no depth at SP & look what happened to them last year.  Sorry I got a little carried away, but Milwaukee really should sign another SP, but it most likely will not be Shields."
Brewers,2u9whu,MustBeNice,2,Sat Jan 31 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"I agree about Cotts. I like the signing, but definitely feel they overpaid. I was impartial on Estrada because I think they did get good value, but I also agree with you on our lack of SP depth. It's scary right now...I just do not trust Nelson with being consistent, and that is with us hoping Willy and Fiers don't regress."
Brewers,2u9whu,smiles134,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:05:47 2015 UTC,Estrada wasn't going to be a starter next year no matter what happened. We got value out of him to strengthen a spot that was necessary to strengthen. That was a good move. Gallardo was a move looking to the future.
Brewers,2u9whu,MustBeNice,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"He wasn't going to start out as a starter,  but if Nelson has a 7 ERA going into late May, you can be sure Estrada would step right in.

Brewers,2u9whu,sjm1541,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Estrada would have ended up being a 4 million dollar mop up man who is on the down side of an average career.

Brewers,2u9whu,SoSublim3,1 point,Sat Jan 31 06:24:19 2015 UTC,"This would be a horrible idea to sign James Shields.  The team is probably a 77 or 78 win team right now as things stand, even after losing Gallardo, so signing Shields doesn't really turn them into instant contenders.  All that it does is turn them into a slightly above average team, with a crippling contract 2 to 5 years out when the team gets progressively worse.  Last years team wasn't as good as they were in April, and not as bad as they were in September, they were somewhere in between: a .500 team.  They aren't contenders now and they weren't last year. A move like this would cripple the team financially for the near future, do nothing for its prospects as a contender, and would be a waste of money.  But is is exactly the sort of thing that Mark Attanasio loves to do, so it wouldn't surprise me if it happened."

There's a major salary-cap (lack there-of) problem in MLB, and the truth is that not every pickup we have is going to be an all-star. Most are going to be mediocre players with questionable histories. Because that's who we can afford.  He hasn't done anything deal-breaking in my opinion. He's done a  good job, especally under Attonasio's reign, of holding onto good talent. Even the couple guys we did lose to the Yanks, he made respectable offers towards.

The Cubs have a vast fan base and in a Top 3 populus city that will still attract field trips, fans, and committed team supporters (rabid fans). The Brewers have to worry about season attendance when looking at the numbers, the Cubs simply don't. They'll have the money regardless of how long it takes them to rebuild. We have to rely on Mark's pockets for the success of the team coupled with fan attendance.   It's just a delicate balance. We probably should bite the bullet and rebuild, but its a risky proposition which could really hurt us. But I can see your frustration at what the Cubs seemed to easily do within what seems like only 2 years. I wish it is that easy for us."
Brewers,2u82bv,smiles134,2,Fri Jan 30 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"the brewers and cubs have quite similar attendance figures over the last 5 years: team field 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 total CHC Wrigley Field     3,062,973      3,017,966 2,882,756 2,642,682 2,652,113     14,258,490  MIL Miller Park     2,776,531      3,071,373 2,831,385 2,531,105 2,797,384     14,007,778   making us the 9th and 11th largest markets in terms of fan attendance over that time frame.  tv and merchandising revenues are where the cubs separate from the brewers financially."
Brewers,2u82bv,extra_less,0,Tue Feb 10 14:56:42 2015 UTC,That's silly. The Brewers have made the playoffs twice in the last decade and a half and they're consistently in the upper half of attendance.
Brewers,2u82bv,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"eh, i'd say theres a difference between not making the playoffs and being at Cubs levels over the last 6-7 years.  In the last half decade, your odds of going to a brewers game and seeing a win are still over .500, even if they dont go to the playoffs.  I mean, last year was one hell of a run even if they didnt make it.  I guess i'd rather go to a game that they win in a season they dont make the playoffs than go to a game they lose when they do make the playoffs.  I'd rather have the Crew in the playoffs, but to attend a game that they lose just sucks.  The Brewers have managed to keep the win percentage up high enough that theres always a fair chance that they'll win, which keeps attendance numbers up."

Brewers,2u82bv,crewblue,3,Sat Jan 31 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"I''m hot and cold on him. He does decent and I think he would be a great GM for a large market team, allowing him to go after these big FAs and trade targets. However, with a small market team, you gotta build the farm. He has done a good job of keeping the team in contention for the playoffs, but I am kinda hoping that something happens that ends up causing him to leave. If last years team couldn't win the dvision I doubt this years team could make the playoffs. I think a rebuild is the best option for the team right now and he most likely won't do it."
Brewers,2u82bv,Ofreo,4,Fri Jan 30 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"He is making the Brewers into the new Bucks. It just seems like we're heading into a black hole of mediocrity. It also really irks me that he never commits to a rebuild, and he just sort of reloads the farm every now and then. Not to mention the scouting department's inability to draft or take chances on young, high-upside arms (until last year and I'm not sold on Medeiros as a starter). He makes good moves from time to time, but to win a title (ultimate goal) you need to start to have a culture change. I would love a new, young G.M. that is adept at advanced stats, values his prospects, and can commit to a full rebuild. On one hand I'm grateful we don't have RAJ for a GM, however, we're stuck with a middle of the road G.M. that seems to have no direction right now. I can't complain about Melvin's contract structures though. Bad contracts have been few and far between during these past 13 years aside from Suppan and Wolf. It's just time for a change."
Brewers,2u82bv,extra_less,1 point,Fri Jan 30 21:18:38 2015 UTC,The pro scouting dept. has done very well.   The amateur scouting dept. has left a lot to be desired over the last 5 years.
Brewers,2u82bv,Wisco7,0,Tue Feb 10 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"I would even say wolf was not a bad contract.  Suppan was. I think he is a solid GM but not spectacular.  The culture started to change with MA owning the team but he has stuck with Melvin for too long. He could have made a splash a few years ago and the league would have noticed.   The flip side is, no fa n has a real good idea of the business side of it. How much MA has reigned in DM or what the Financials really are."

He's a decent enough GM, he'll keep us from becoming perpetual cellar-dwellers, but my gut also says that with the front office we've got now, we can't expect much more than mediocrity.   We're stuck in this perpetual cycle of giving away the farm for talent that almost-but-not-quite pushes us over the hump, then trying to half-ass restock the farm without going into a complete rebuild.   We're never going to have the Cardinal's farm system, or the sort of management they're putting together down in Chicago, but it also doesn't feel like we're striving for that sort of excellence either.   How much of that is on Melvin in particular, I don't know. Could be someone else would get better results, or someone else might just be dragged down to the level we're at now."

Mortgaged the future, paid more in salary for a playoff appearance that still didnt even balance the books.  I guarantee you that the Cardinals at the beginning of every season ahve a goal of winning te World Series, not to simply make it as a wild card team, or win a series.  And that philosopy plays itself out in how they build their ballclub.  The same team with the very small market Rays."

Brewers,2u5c3w,lukewarmx,2,Fri Jan 30 08:29:11 2015 UTC,Gorzelanny also started 10 games in 2013 that really drove up his ERA. His ERA out of the bullpen the last two season is 2.04. I'm sure there's more to Gorzelanny leaving than just the talent level of the two pitcher.  Gorzelanny also offers more out of long relief and spot starting that ups his value. He's also better against lefties while Cotts has reverse platoon splits.

I'm not going to look to deep into his numbers, but in August-October of last year his Ks dropped significantly and his ERA was over 6. April-July he struck out 51 batters in 47 innings and had an ERA of 3.44. Obviously he was incredible the year before that (1.11 ERA/10.26 K/9).  Maybe the Brewers knew he was injured at the end of last year, maybe they see something they can change, maybe he'll be awful this year. It's worth the risk for 3 million when it doesn't really stop them from pursuing other bullpen options."

Brewers,2tu64w,Amoney8612,3,Tue Jan 27 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"If you don't get selected for this, your only other real chance at them is going to the frozen tailgate event (or whatever they call it) which is the day that the Brewer's Box Office officially opens. I think they sell them that day as well. After that point, you can buy a 10/20/40/81 game pack, and you can get one (usually).   I have registered each of the last 5 years, and I have been selected for tickets 3 times (I went to all 3). This year they are supposedly having less in the lottery than past years, but I can't confirm that at all.  You can always buy tickets on the 2nd hand market as well, but they are very expensive. Something on the order of $40-50 for 400 level seats that literally the day after are $8.  Good luck!"
Brewers,2tu64w,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Jan 27 15:06:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Exactly what I needed to know.
Brewers,2tuitj,machiavellism,4,Tue Jan 27 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Nelson looks pretty heavily penciled into the rotation.  I don't expect that to change.  Fwiw, Beachy isn't expected to be back in action until June or July."
Brewers,2tuitj,CM816,5,Tue Jan 27 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"He has to start.  I'd be pretty upset if the Brewers bumped him to the pen because they signed a guy like Brandon Beachy.  Nelson isn't that young anymore (25), and needs a shot to prove himself this year so we can assess where we're at with our rotation of the future.  If he pitches well we've got a solid, cost-effective core of young starters in Wily and Jimmy.  Now's the time to figure it out."
Brewers,2tuitj,OrfeoKimble,2,Tue Jan 27 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Keep Nelson. Like OP mentioned, 13 starts is tough to base any decision off of. If Lohse goes, Nelson could be our #2 or so in the years to follow."
Brewers,2tuitj,motivate18,2,Tue Jan 27 15:41:59 2015 UTC,Nelson has earned the right to be given an opportunity so hopefully he takes this to go that next level for the crew. He's 25 so he's not exactly the youngest prospect anymore so it's time to see what the crew has in him and what he can do with a full season of work.   It's Fiers that makes me the most nervous. He did well last year but he did well before and then hitters began to figure him out so will they be able to figure him out again is my concern.   I still would like to see one more signing besides the bullpen another starter in case Fiers struggles or someone else goes down. I don't see the depth as deep as Melvin see's it.
Brewers,2tuitj,SoSublim3,2,Tue Jan 27 16:03:55 2015 UTC,"It's Fiers that makes me the most nervous.    Yeah, and thats just the nature of his pitching style.  He has to walk such a fine line between being absolutely unhittable and getting shelled."
Brewers,2tuitj,necropaw,2,Wed Jan 28 05:34:47 2015 UTC,I think you gotta give him a shot. He showed some signs last year that he could pitch.   Honestly I think this is going to be another long season. I see consistency as being our biggest challenge this year.
Brewers,2tuitj,madman86,2,Tue Jan 27 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"I think we've gotta commit to him starting, though as somebody else mentioned  the person I'm worried the most about is Fiers getting lit up like he did in late 2012 and 2013.  I try to think of it like Wily Peralta. He was brought up for a couple games in late 2012 and did well. 2013 he started in 32 games and he definitely showed growing pains (but settled in in the 2nd half), and really settled in 2014. Nelson got 12 starts in 2014 compared to Peralta's 5 in 2012, enough to get his feet wet. Hopefully he can use that and the off-season to figure a few more things out, develop a change up.   Though you would hate, worst case scenario, for Fiers and Nelson (or even just one or the other) to perform poorly and wonder what could have been. Then again, outside of Shields, the rest of the remaining FA pitchers.. kinda suck.   Realistically, I could see Nelson finishing with a FIP just below 4.00. Whatever, bring on baseball season already!"
Brewers,2tuitj,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"It would completely shock (and disappoint) me if nelson wasn't in the starting rotation to start the season. Outside of Peralta, he has the best raw talent of anyone on the staff."
Brewers,2tuitj,Hosko817,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that spot in the rotation is just about Nelson. There are several other young pitchers that could still step into the rotation including Taylor Jungman, Tyler Thornburg, and Johnny Helwig if he recovers successfully from his surgery."
Brewers,2tuitj,crewblue,0,Thu Jan 29 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"Beachy is only a good option if the real world turns into my MLB Road to the Show, where the Brewers signed Beachy, and he has been in the race for a Cy Young both years.  I like Nelson. He's been roughed up a few times, but has been brilliant a few times. I think he needs some real time to adjust and refine, but that he will certainly be serviceable. If he ends up being just a guy to turn around the rotation, and nothing more, that will work this year, and maybe a year in the league will help him going forward the next 2-3 years.   I don't think the Brewers can stick him in the pen again. A lot of that reasoning has to do with the Brewers simply not having another arm to put there right now. Most of the guys on the 40-man pitching roster have some starting experience, but it's either limited or bad. Unless the Brewers pick up another inning-eater somewhere to start games, Nelson is the only good answer."

Brewers,2tq265,SoSublim3,3,Mon Jan 26 14:46:43 2015 UTC,I rather see this then J Pap coming over. They better not stop at K-Rod either better be looking at other options available also. Starting / Bullpen.   DM keeps saying we're so deep at Starting rotation and I disagree. Sign Shields or something and move Fiers to the pen.
Brewers,2tq265,legit_,5,Mon Jan 26 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure how I feel about a Pap signing either.. but who knows if K Rod can do it again. Honestly, I find it pretty astounding that he's been able to put up these numbers considering the considerable dip in velocity since his peak.   On the topic of picking up another man for the rotation.. it couldn't just be ""Shields or something"" for it to make sense. It's ace or nothing. That said, I say give the kids a chance. Fiers was lights out last season with really impressive numbers and Nelson deserves his shot. Just my two cents."
Brewers,2tq265,legit_,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:24:24 2015 UTC,I think Nelson should be in the bullpen until he is a little more consistent. We should also look for some prospects.
Brewers,2tq265,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that's not really how it works. He's been effective as a SP, therefore we should play him as a SP.. IMO, doing otherwise would be undermining his minor league successes. Obviously picking up an ace would change things, however."

Edit:  I missed this bullet point the first time through:   At any time after individual game tickets are on-sale each season, fans may visit the Miller Park Ticket Office to redeem their Timeless Ticket.   Okay, so am I missing something else?  When the tickets go on sale, do they set aside some for the golden ticket holders for a little bit (Say, up to 72 hours before gameday)?  Because if not, and if you have to wait till they go on sale to the public, what exactly is the point here?   I simply can't imagine one would be shit out of luck if tickets went on sale and sold out in an hour and one was unable to redeem their ticket in that time, because that would offer no advantage to buying the ticket at all."

Brewers,2tdsbt,workthrowaway68,4,Fri Jan 23 14:15:42 2015 UTC,uhhhh aren't there some cheaper CPs on the market that could do okay? Like Kelley Janssen?
Brewers,2tdsbt,workthrowaway68,3,Fri Jan 23 15:22:42 2015 UTC,Too expensive IMO
Brewers,2tdsbt,minstrel_cramp,3,Fri Jan 23 14:04:55 2015 UTC,In before /u/workthrowaway68 has a stroke.

Brewers,2tdrvl,brewbr8,13,Fri Jan 23 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"Braun, Gomez, Garza, Papelbon... the Brewers are trying to make /r/baseball's All-Hitler team.  In all seriousness, I wouldn't mind this, assuming they don't give up any decent prospects and the Phillies eat almost all of the money."

Brewers,2tdrvl,borno23,6,Sun Jan 25 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"If they turn the 200 innings of money they traded away in Yo for 65 innings of Papelbon I will be a bit disappointed.   If the Phillies eat a majority of the cash, that's a different story."
Brewers,2tdrvl,ContactPlay,6,Fri Jan 23 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"I for one have always wanted a closer who would intentionally grab his genitals in front of thousands of families when he didn't get his way. Let's sign him, and don't worry about finding that 5th starter, we can just wing it. -Doug Melvin"
Brewers,2tdrvl,northsidestrangler,4,Fri Jan 23 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"Considering Broxton is making 9 million next year, there has to be a huge salary cut for Papelbon. He's due 13 million next year and another 13 million in 2016 if he finishes 46 games in 2015.   Melvin has usually been really good about paying for closers. Papelbon is coming here way under market value if the Brewers aquire him."
Brewers,2tdrvl,sjm1541,2,Fri Jan 23 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Okay the Broxton deal was stupid. But if they sign Papelbon for more than $7m (phillies eating the rest) this will be absolutely ridiculous.  Spending big money on proven ""closers"" is a huge waste of money. They flame out so quickly. Anyone remember Eric Gagne? Axford? K-Rod? Turnbow? What is Milwaukee's obsession with stockpiling as many ""proven closers"" when they have much bigger holes to address?"
Brewers,2tdrvl,MustBeNice,4,Fri Jan 23 11:02:53 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting Trevor Hoffman. It's almost as if the Brewers signed him so they could put up that giant saves poster in right field.  We all have that friend who's obsessed with buying one thing, TVs, cars, motorcycles, computers, etc. Well Doug Melvin has an obsession with buying one particular thing: closers."
Brewers,2tdrvl,northsidestrangler,4,Fri Jan 23 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Trevor, Axford, and K-Rod were all fantastic in their first seasons with the Brewers though.  Trevor fell apart in his second year, Axford had 48? consecutive saves before he fell apart, and K-Rod made the all star team just last year.  So yeah, Melvin is obsessed with closers, but they usually have short term success before flaming out."
Brewers,2tdrvl,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Fri Jan 23 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"Haha I loved this comment.  I do love Trevor so perhaps that's why he doesn't enter my mind as crappy Doug Melvin closer signings, but MAN that year he broke the record was brutal. You're completely right."

Brewers,2tbeqb,brewisbrewin,3,Thu Jan 22 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"excellent point, yes.  Scoot only batted .103 in his limited appearances against lefties. Luis batted .333 against lefties last year.  Also, ESPN shows he's a switch hitter! Not a bad guy to have around. I'm excited about him as a prospect!"
Brewers,2tbeqb,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:30:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but putting him at 2B really limits his defensive value."
Brewers,2tbeqb,dusters,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:27:20 2015 UTC,Because second baseman aren't as valuable as shortstop are defensively.
Brewers,2tbeqb,dusters,2,Fri Jan 23 16:00:18 2015 UTC,SS is widely regarded as the more difficult position. Any defensive calculations will give more weight to a SS than a 2B.   If you view Sardinas as the better defensive player then he should play there over Segura if they're both on the field.
Brewers,2tbeqb,sjm1541,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a platoon at SS is something I don't see happening as long as Gennett plays 2B for the Brewers.   It takes a while to really get a feel for a players true defensive talent level also. The Brewers have plenty of time to figure out how to mix and match depending on the development of Sardinas, Segura and Gennett. Arcia is going to make a push for the big league team in a few years also, but its obviously a good problem to have."
Brewers,2tbeqb,sjm1541,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"Then we are arguing two completely different things. I wasn't saying that his value to the team would be lower at second base, it very well could (although Segura has sucked for a year and a half now). I was simply stating that his overall value to any team is likely lower at second base. If you are unsure of why this is, I suggest http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/explaining-win-values-part-three/"
Brewers,2tbeqb,dusters,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"That isn't what I argued though. Like I said, he might be worth more for the Brewers at second base, but it still underutilizes his maximum value"

Brewers,2tafcb,necropaw,2,Thu Jan 22 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"I can't find any audio but he said it would be based on the trials and tribulations of an Italian immigrant family living across from Wrigley Field.  They'd have to put up with the crazy Cubs fans on bleachers on their roof, a rogue firehouse down the block that sprays their hose into the house randomly, and enemy warplanes losing their flight paths (this was when the Blue Angels were doing an air show in Chicago).  Then, pigeons would begin to invade and they would be trained by the family to poop on their enemies and the annoying Cubs fans.  Harry Caray would make cameo appearances as the moon as well, which would rise over Wrigley, and would be visible to only the members of the immigrant family.  Occasionally, rabid coyotes would also be roaming the streets of Chicago, but only the most heavily traveled streets nearby Wrigley.   Then, he continued by having Kyuji Fujikawa (Cubs pitcher) run a pizza shop down the road from this family, still across from Wrigley, and only make pizza that he wanted to, or what he thought people were asking since the shop didn't have a translator."

Brewers,2tafcb,necropaw,4,Fri Jan 23 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"I was at the game when Garza gave Gennett the hot foot treatment. After Scooter hit a two-run shot in the 8th, a group of guys sitting a coupe of rows up behind the home dugout spent the rest of the game screaming ""Scooooooteeeeeer"" and went crazy each time he stood up to wave; the players in the dugout couldn't stop laughing because the fans kept chanting even though Scooter stood up and waved four or five times. After the post-game interview, Gennett threw his batting gloves to the guys before heading in to the clubhouse.  You can actually hear the group chanting Gennett's name in the background of this clip.  I like Scooter Gennett."

We've depleted a lot of our potential future stars in trades and there's not a whole lot else coming up the pipe as of right now to get excited about. A few names here and there, but nobody that looks to be a future perennial all star in our system right now."
Brewers,2tbb4n,orangutan9,2,Thu Jan 22 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Right, but other than corner IFs aren't we young and pretty talented at every other position?"

Brewers,2tbb4n,BrewCrewKevin,3,Thu Jan 22 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"Our big league team is pretty strong. And it's a lot of young guys. So right now we probably don't need much of a farm system.   But when these guys you are mentioning, especially the young guys: Peralta, Fiers, Nelson, Scooter, Segura, Khris Davis, Jeremy Jeffress, etc., are all eventually going to hit arbitration. If they've performed well, their salaries will jump from <1million to a few million. There's no way we'll be able to keep all of them on our salary cap.   So small market teams like the brewers need to keep turning guys over. As guys leave, we need talent behind them to step up into the big leagues. Right now we don't have any of that. What we have is what we have.  And as far as trading chips, same deal. Right now we can't afford to trade any starters, because there is nobody to replace them. Our triple-A club isn't really all that major-league-ready like most other  teams."
Brewers,2tbb4n,theamazingkiwi,2,Thu Jan 22 23:19:14 2015 UTC,"Most of the legit, possible, 3-4+ annual WAR players are all 20 years of age or younger, with maybe a 21yo somewhere in there. Needless to say, the Brewers minor league talents needs to show its potential."
Brewers,2tbb4n,tr1ppn,2,Thu Jan 22 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"The Brewers used to have a very good farm system. That's why you see the good team that they have today. A lot of good deals, and a lot of good players drafted helps out a lot. Don't forget the Brewers also drafted Jake Odorizzi, Prince Fielder, and Brett Lawrie within the last 10 or so years, but 1 left via FA, and the other 2 were traded. The current Brewers roster is, generally, the product of a good farm system.  For the trades the Brewers made in ""win now"" situations (Marcum, Sabbathia, Greinke), a lot of good prospects were dealt. A number of the players traded away to those other teams have at the very least contributing roles on their new teams. The farm system was gutted to make those moves.  If you look at now, there are not really any notable prospects. A few names here and there, a couple of ""could be a star if everything goes right"", but there's not anyone who is in the system who is looked at as a top prospect. There's not another Fielder or Braun. There's not another Lucroy. There's not another Fiers/Nelson/Peralta. Even if there was, a lot of the guys on the current roster were drafted under a slightly different development/scouting team. The guys in the system now were not, and it shows in the development of a few players. Development of draft picks is something the Brewers have done very poorly in since Seid took over.  With the very unfortunate passing of Seid, there is yet another change in the office. It could turn a new leaf for some of the guys who aren't developing as everyone had hoped, and it could change the direction of the draft for the next few years, but it takes 2-3 good drafts in a row to assemble a good core group, and the last few drafts for the Brewers have been decent, but that still leaves nearly all of those guys 2-5 years out of the majors, at least."
Brewers,2tbb4n,tr1ppn,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"Lucroy wasn't a future star when we drafted him, he wasn't expected to be anything. When we brought him up he was the back up at AAA. Davis and Fiers came out of no where as well.   Isn't that with every prospect? they could be a star if things go right. look at weeks, he was supposed to be a superstar and he never developed into anywhere near the star we thought he was going to be. Or even Hart never hit his ceiling for any long period of time."
Brewers,2tbb4n,tr1ppn,2,Fri Jan 23 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"But they were very good at contributing (at least for a period of time) and that was the low end of their potential.   There's a big difference between someone like Weeks where ""contributor"" is their floor, and ""superstar"" is their ceiling and someone like Davis has ""AAAA"" as his floor, and ""above average"" as his ceiling, make sense?  Right now, the Brewers have a lot of guys whose floor is well below ""contributor"", and that is what makes the farm system very weak. Sure people can come out of nowhere and do well, but there's not many who can be reasonably expected to contribute that are in the system right now."
Brewers,2tbb4n,oldprospector21,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:21:17 2015 UTC,"No I get what your saying. I understand you want as many high ceiling guys as possible, as many potential superstars as you can get. And I certainly understand the want for a rebuild like the cubs or the brewers of the early to mid 00s. But my point is if we can keep getting guys like Luc, Davis, Gennet, etc w/o rebuilding why rebuild for the sake of rebuilding and doing it to get a strong farm system? If we can keep developing guys like we have why scrap it and start all over again? If our stars were in their mid to late 30s then I could get down with scrapping it but we still have relatively young superstars and some guys that might develop into superstars. two of our three first rounders have potential to develop into special players and we signed Lara another potential stud. and we still have some decent bats and arms besides them."

Brewers,2t6l76,oldprospector21,2,Wed Jan 21 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying the chances this works out are astronomically small.   With that said, Dontrelle does offer some interesting numbers in terms of getting lefties out. For his career lefties hit only .200/.274/.288 against him good for a .562 OPS. Those career number do date back to 2003 so that definitely needs to be taken into account. If you like to have some fun with old stats looking at Willis' numbers from 2007 and 08 against lefties are astounding. IN 07 he allowed a .356 OPS against lefties. (.919 against righties lol)   His one big problem has been walks. Maybe this can be another miracle that Fred Dabney can work with a pitcher in terms of getting them to have more control. Many of our current bullpen pieces credit him with their new found control.   Now i have officially spent too much time typing about a guy who is likely to be cut"
Brewers,2t6l76,itzjamesftw,2,Thu Jan 22 01:06:49 2015 UTC,"Holy shit people, it's a non guaranteed minor league deal.  Stop freaking out."

Brewers,2t44s5,TheBause,4,Wed Jan 21 01:02:01 2015 UTC,I'm definitely going to miss Yo's plate appearances. You never knew when he was going to let one rip and that was the most exciting part.

Brewers,2t44s5,squeakyshoe89,3,Wed Jan 21 15:53:13 2015 UTC,Has weeks signed yet?  I'm not convinced he doesn't come back for the league minimum as a utility infielder
Brewers,2t44s5,quickstop_rstvideo,6,Wed Jan 21 01:06:48 2015 UTC,Considering he spent all of last year refusing to play any other position then second base i dont know how well of a utility infielder he would be.
Brewers,2t44s5,dusters,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:36:06 2015 UTC,"He had 1.2 WAR in only 286 plate appearances, I think he will find a home somewhere. Maybe an AL team where he could occasionally DH.

Brewers,2t2a5b,ITGuy420,8,Tue Jan 20 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the Brewers will land Shields. It would be really awesome, sure, but the Brewers don't have a whole lot going for them right now. Adding a great pitcher to a nearly .500 team makes the team still nearly .500. I don't think Shields would tip the scale into the Brewers being contenders even for the Wild Card, and given that, there's no good reason to drop the money on him. Save the cash for a rainy day or something while the farm system gets put back together."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,7,Tue Jan 20 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree, but we also have a lot of guys under contract for 1 more year. It may make more sense to make 1 final push before re-building."
Brewers,2t2a5b,BrewCrewKevin,2,Tue Jan 20 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, I don't think that the Brewers have the talent for one more push, even with Shields.  The rotation would include Shields, Garza, Lohse, Peralta, and Fiers/Nelson. That's actually pretty good all things considered, so I'll let that one slide.  Bullpen includes Broxton, Fiers/Nelson (whichever isn't starting), Henderson, Jeffress, Smith, and whoever is good enough to be there between Wooten, Thornburg, and Kintzler. I don't put much faith in any of those guys outside of Smith, Fiers/Nelson, and Jeffress. Broxton didn't look all that great, and at least last year, Henderson looked bad and ended up injured. That's not looking very good at all.  Position players would be Lucroy, Lind, Scooter/??, Segura, Ramirez, Braun, Davis, and Gomez. Off the bench there is Parra, Herrera, Schafer, and whatever infielders they call up. Defensively, this team is set up pretty well, with limited liability. Offensively, this team looks like it could be consistent, but not necessarily good enough to contend.  Obviously without Shields it looks a bit worse than that, so I don't have to go back through it.  Don't get me wrong, there is some great talent on this team, and Doug usually has a pretty good idea about what he is doing with the personnel on this team, but I just can't see a legitimate push out of this team this year. Bullpen is obviously an issue, especially on the back end, bench is pretty ugly, and only every player firing on all cylinders was enough last year before an epic collapse."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,3,Tue Jan 20 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"Position players would be Lucroy, Lind, Scooter/??, Segura, Ramirez, Braun, Davis, and Gomez.

Offensively, this team looks like it could be consistent, but not necessarily good enough to contend.   You're saying they aren't good enough to contend, yet almost this exact team did for more than half the season last year. That's my point.  Who have we really lost since last year? No big names. A couple bullpen guys, but no core players. I don't see a reason we couldn't contend with one more big move SP, and maybe a platoon guy for Scoot."
Brewers,2t2a5b,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"They did that for half the season. What about the other half? Totally fell apart. That's what I'm trying to say. You can't consider a team a ""contender"" if they only make it through half the season and implode. Win one lose one for 162 games has the same effect as winning 81 in a row and losing 81 in a row.  Also need to consider that the Brewers had K-Rod closing games who was pretty dominant in the 1st half, and now have no (real) closer. I don't think Henderson or Broxton are full-time-closer material. The vets are all a little older now, so that could potentially cause issues as well with some of the older fellows (namely Ramirez).  I agree that a platoon mate for Scooter would be great, but that only gets the Brewers so far. Shields is around 3 WAR for his career, and I don't think the Brewers are within 3 games of contenting this year."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,3,Tue Jan 20 19:12:16 2015 UTC,I agree. Spending a ton of free agent $$ on shields this season is not the answer. They need to see how things shake out at the end of this season with guys at the end of their contracts. I have no problem with them  spending on free agents next season.
Brewers,2t2a5b,Hosko817,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The only way I would want Shields is if a Lohse situation pops up due to the first round compensation. If we can sign him for cheap and then flip him mid season, it would make sense. Otherwise I hope we stay away.   He's in his 30s and has thrown a ton of innings. Not sure it's worth it."
Brewers,2t2a5b,bbqnachos,2,Tue Jan 20 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, but my point is that they've shown the ability to contend. For half he season, they were one of the best teams in baseball.  I think there's a huge difference between a .500 team all season, and a team that goes .550 for 5 months and epically implodes to end up circa .500. This core of guys has shown that they can contend if they stay consistent.  And we didn't lose any big names to free agency this year. But look at next year's free agents.."
Brewers,2t2a5b,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"There is a difference, I totally agree, but the issue is that the result is the same. They have the ability to contend, if healthy and consistent, but the issue with the Brewers, as it has been for years, is actually being healthy and consistent. I agree we didn't lose any big names in FA, but we did lose a closer, and some good lefty specialists from the pen."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,3,Tue Jan 20 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"Save the cash for a rainy day or something while the farm system gets put back together.   A ""rainy day"" for this team are the inevitable years of rebuild. The way I see it, if Mark opens the checkbook on someone like Shields, the worst case scenario (barring injury) is the team goes nowhere and you flip a stud pitcher to a contender for more young minor leaguers."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tbe170,2,Wed Jan 21 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that this team looks to be .500.  We only have to look at our division to see how they match up.   Cardinals are about the same. Pirates are about the same. Cubs finished strong last year and have added a good coach and even more players to their line up. Reds are the same or even slightly worse.   If I were to place the Brewers in the division this year, I would say 3rd or 4th depending how the Pirates do.  I honestly think the Cubs have enough pieces to take a wild card this year and possibly the division if STL doesn't improve their hitting."
Brewers,2t2a5b,Pagoon,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"I think that the Cubs could be scary good, but might need one of those .500 ""growing pains"" type years to go full tilt. I could be wrong on that one and they could get 90 wins, but they could also get <70 wins, because they're the Cubs.  Cards/Pirates are sitting about the same, and the Reds have been falling apart the last few years as their good players got old or hurt.   I could easily see the Brewers in 3rd, possibly 4th depending on which of Cardinals/Pirates/Cubs doesn't perform as expected."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,2,Tue Jan 20 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Why are you down on the Brewers? calling them a .500 team, just curious"
Brewers,2t2a5b,EricH7,2,Tue Jan 20 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much ""down on them"" as I am realistic. There is a lot of talent on this team right now, and there's actually a rotation that can keep the club in games there. Issue is the bullpen is a disaster, the bench is just as bad, and the farm system is void of anyone who will be useful in the next 2 or so years.  I think this team will hover right around .500. I don't think they will be leading the division for most of the year like last year, especially with how much better the Cubs have gotten, and how consistent the Cardinals are. I would love to see them prove me wrong, but I can't imagine it being a possibility."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,4,Tue Jan 20 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"I want this to be a civil discussion so please don't take anything i say as me attacking your opinion or saying your stupid or any of that non sense. i just want to have a discussion, if you disagree w/ my opinion then fine and rebuff with respect.   Braun appears to be coming back 100%, Segura seems to have figured it out again in winter ball, Davis will feel less pressure this year and be comfortable and relaxed, Parra is a great 4th OF and bat off the bench, Luc, Rami, and GoGo are who they are, Gennet has hit every where he has been in the minors which has included LHP and a majority of the NL central pitchers are RH. Lind crushes RHP as well, and if we platoon him with luc/maldy i think we'll be fine.   Like you said the bench is a little thin but we still have a month and a half before ST, so a lot could happen. they have some intriguing in house possibilities on the bench but i wouldn't mind them going out and getting some more. and doug is determined not to make the same mistake twice by having 1 position platoons, he is going to have a lot of guys that can play a lot of positions.   Our bullpen needs work as well but this year we won't have to play the first 3 months a man down either by holding on to a guy who isn't MLB ready. Broxton/Jeffress/Smith/Kintzler/Henderson/Thornburg/Wooten is not a bad start to a bullpen, and who knows if we go out and get shields or zimmerman you could throw nelson in there too. theres work to do but not a ton.  Starting staff i am also pretty confident in. Peralta will another step forward and really become an ace this year. Lohse is older but he is not a bad 3/4 at this point. Garza needs to stay healthy which is asking a lot but he is dominant when healthy. Fires is the real deal, a down year in 2013 shouldn't damper our expectations he had a lot go wrong in his personal and professional life and really bounced back.  Nelson has a chance if he develops his change up to be another bull dog ace type pitcher. and we could also see melvin/attanasio go out and make a move to get shields, zimmerman, or someone else we don't even know about.   Maybe I'm just wearing my blue and gold colored glasses but i feel this year isn't all that gloomy and we have a chance to be something special."
Brewers,2t2a5b,EricH7,3,Tue Jan 20 19:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same page, no worries. There's very few things I'm actually somewhat useful discussing, and baseball is one of them, so I get a little passionate about it.  I'm interested to see how Braun does coming back. Everything I have heard so far points to that he is much better than last year in terms of feel, and that could certainly translate to him coming back to form. If that goes as planned, I agree he will be a very important part of the roster for the next few years still.  Segura had a really rough go of it this last year. I think he played a lot worse than he should have, plus there were some off-field issues, so I will give him a break. I don't think that he will be on the level of his rookie year, but I definitely think he will improve. He's definitely at the level of serviceable at SS, and I think he will get better with age.   I'm on the fence with Davis. I saw a lot of great things come out of him last year (I still refer to him as ""Khlutch Davis""), and am interested to see him moving forward. I just hope he isn't already at his ceiling. Parra was fantastic off the bench last year, and I think he can be good off the bench again this year.  Lucroy and Gomez stand to have good years again. They have no real reason not to, provided nothing happens between now and then knock on wood. I totally agree with you there. Ramirez I'm not as sure about, but he has been consistent over his career, but has some durability issues. I think another year added on to previous durability issues will cause him to perform worse than last year. I think that issue is enough to turn the Brewers from ""a piece away from contending"" to ""not quite there yet"".  I think Doug can work a little magic to fill up the bench/platoons, but the type of guys that play those positions can be anywhere from all-star caliber to barely better than anyone else. That's one of the other reasons I see the Brewers as ""not quite there yet"". With the farm system in rough shape, the bench has no ""up and comer"" to get experience, and the rest of the bench (outside Parra who I don't count as a bench player, really) is at or below replacement value. The season is very long - backups are very important, and the Brewers don't have that.  Bullpen does need work, and I don't think they're going to get it. A contending bullpen has one guy you can always hang your hat on to get the job done, and I don't think anyone in the Brewer bullpen has it. The guys in there are all pretty much middle relief guys, and there's no backend support. I agree that the starting staff looks pretty good based on past performance. I also agree that Fiers is due for a good year, and with just a little tweaking, I think Nelson could be a good option as well. Even with that, no back end on the bullpen means if the Brewers have <3 run lead going into the 7th, it could be ugly.  I would much rather have JZim than Shields, but I don't think the Brewers have the cash for Shields or the prospects for JZim.  Like I said, I don't think it's all doom and gloom, I just think it's being extremely realistic. I think the Brewers are short of ""just one or two guys"" to make a real push."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,2,Tue Jan 20 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for the civil discussion, its always a crapshoot when you go into discussions on the internet.  I'm on the fence with davis as well, i was one of his biggest detractors in the middle and end of last year. He said after the season that he probably put too much pressure on himself to be ""The Guy"" so maybe now that the pressure is gone he'll perform. but who knows he could come out and do the same thing he did last year.   Good point about the majority of our bullpen guys being MRP, hadn't thought of that. And knebel seems like he is a high leverage type of guy, maybe not this year but he could be another big arm in the pen. The gallardo trade may have cleared some room up to go get a late inning guy or two. so maybe in the next week or so we see doug make a move.  I would rather have Zim too. Shields wants a 5 year $90 MM deal, no way am i giving that to a 33 year old. And like you said who knows if we have the assets to get Zim, maybe the Nats are just looking to dump him before his contracts up, kind of the same situation we were in with Yo"
Brewers,2t2a5b,EricH7,2,Tue Jan 20 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"He probably did do that. When you think that he's out there with 2 All-Stars, and 2 Golden Glove winners, he's just ""some other outfielder on the team"", I can imagine there was a TON of pressure on the guy to do something. He did do quite a bit though, and I still think he can be good, especially with people like Parra, Braun, and Gomez surrounding him. That's a great cast to be in company of when you're a youngish guy new to the big leagues.  Knebel won't be on the club this year (maybe September if he does something great), but who knows what might happen. He's 23, so there's time on his side, and he's only had 8 games in the majors (6.23 ERA in 8.2 innings). He had some shoulder issues, but a great year for the Tigers, so basically he has been everything from ""not yet ready"" to ""rising superstar"" in a year and a half. If all goes well, that would be a great addition to the pen.  Nats have the classic problem of ""too many good guys"". Look at their rotation; in no particular order: Strasburg, Scherzer, Zimmerman, Gonzalez, Roark, Fister. Pick 5. No easy task. They're trying to get some return for the ""odd man out"" since they have 6 pitchers who could easily be 1-3 on any team right now and it wouldn't be weird."
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,2,Tue Jan 20 21:57:45 2015 UTC,Yea I've heard they looking to dump Strasburg or Zim. Zim because he only has this year left on his deal. And Strasburg because he is going to want a mega contract like they just gave Scherzer. Honestly if we get either one I think that makes us division contenders. But like you mentioned before we probably don't have the assets to make it happen.
Brewers,2t2a5b,EricH7,2,Tue Jan 20 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"We can dream though, right? :D"
Brewers,2t2a5b,tr1ppn,2,Tue Jan 20 23:09:02 2015 UTC,Yes we can ha. That would be on par with greinke if we got strasburg.
Brewers,2t2a5b,EricH7,3,Wed Jan 21 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know that we're that actively looking for a replacement. Shields would theoretically be great for our team, but I think his contract is going to cost a bit of money. I don't know how to feel...  I'd almost rather just entirely commit to rebuilding like the Cubs have done. They have some excellent prospects coming up and we have... basically nothing."
Brewers,2t2a5b,smiles134,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:04:10 2015 UTC,That's a good take on it.
Brewers,2t2a5b,machiavellism,3,Tue Jan 20 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"James Shields isn't necessary. He's just a teeny bit better than Garza, and honestly, I don't feel like we should throw that money and years at him. Save it.  I think the Brewers' success isn't dependent on how the rest of the division does, that was evident this year. Their success depends on not skidding across the floor face first for over half a season. A great April is nice, but if they can't sustain again once mid-May hits, it'll be a long 2015. That said, yeah, I do think there's a chance that we're relevant for this season. The offense is so incredibly good, but gets overshadowed from the pitching performances. Roenicke needs to let his starters go more than 5 to 5 1/3 innings in a game. You wear out a bullpen that way."
Brewers,2t2a5b,theamazingkiwi,2,Tue Jan 20 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"well, according to multiple reports the Crew will trust Jimmy Nelson with that last rotation spot, which is a good call. However, I know how Mark Attonasio works, so the chance is still out there."
Brewers,2t2a5b,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Jan 20 16:52:24 2015 UTC,Interesting. It sounds like it'll come down to how much money we want to throw at him.
Brewers,2t2a5b,bbqnachos,2,Tue Jan 20 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think if everything goes right they have a good chance to play in the wild card game. But of course that means the pitching and hitting have to be on, especially if a pitcher has a bad outing or they're facing a Cueto/Wainwright/Kershaw, no serious injuries, when both teams are playing like crap they have to be the ones to come out on top, etc.  Ideally, I'd like it to be last shot this season to compete, go full on rebuild, then get a Billy Beane like GM who makes crazy moves but always wind up with the last laugh (I mean, people were furious with Beane months ago but Oakland is poised to compete yet again)."
Brewers,2szdly,Tuxedo38,15,Mon Jan 19 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"So we at least got some decent prospects, one of whom in Sardinas that is MLB-ready.   It's a sad day to see Yo go, and I'm still bummed but not nearly as much as I was when I first heard we were dealing him."
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,6,Mon Jan 19 22:22:11 2015 UTC,If we can get James Shields (probably not but maybe if Attanasio busts out the wallet) or a similar big improvement in FA this could be a fun year.
Brewers,2szdly,Kobe_AYEEEEE,-7,Mon Jan 19 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"Even IF they were to go out and get Shields, it probably wouldn't be enough.  At most, he improves the team by 4 wins, and most projections have the Brewers as a 77 win team or so.  It would be a ridiculous thing to them to do.  My only hope with this trade, as I feel the return is spot on, is that the team starts to unload vets at a more steady pace and abandon this belief that they are a ""contending"" or even ""good team"" right now."
Brewers,2szdly,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Jan 19 22:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah when I saw the 4 million they gave out my hopeful optimism went mood went to kinda pissed. We need all the cash we can get as a small market team. I always try to be optimistic about trades and then I get to a realistic state, which is an acceptable but probably not ideal trade in this case. Let's see what Doug has under his sleeve."
Brewers,2szdly,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Mon Jan 19 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"Not expected to hit...   He had solid numbers at the plate in the minors, but this isn't the first time I've heard this. I'm going to remain optimistic.   Be good to Yo. He was an all-around solid teammate and did his job on the field. While he didn't blossom into a Cy Young level ace, he still was an above average pitcher and was very consistent.   Gonna miss him for sure :("
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,5,Mon Jan 19 22:47:04 2015 UTC,Basing that more on scouting than numbers.
Brewers,2szdly,Colonel_Rhombus,4,Mon Jan 19 23:05:44 2015 UTC,I wonder how much he's going to miss hitting in the NL?
Brewers,2szdly,Gritsandgravy1,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:36:11 2015 UTC,His numbers at the smaller level were decent but he never really hit AA or AAA ball as he had a .310 OBP in AAA last year.
Brewers,2szdly,dusters,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:44:48 2015 UTC,"he never really hit AA or AAA ball    In 2014 AAA, he batted .290 w/ 262 ABs. If you combine his 2014 AA numbers, he hit .281 w/ 363 ABs.  That's not bad for me."
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:45:15 2015 UTC,With no power and no other way of getting on base. Just looking at his batting average doesn't show even close to the whole story.  He's a legit prospect but has a limited ceiling with the bat.
Brewers,2szdly,dusters,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"He's a legit prospect but has a limited ceiling with the bat.   Yes, this is true. I don't expect him to ever post an above average SLG%. Still he can be an effective hitter, and his BA shows the foundation is there. He'll learn to take his walks."
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,2,Tue Jan 20 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"Apparently Knebel's UCL tear was clean and he's been throwing for six months with no issues, so that's promising."
Brewers,2szdly,mattwise15,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:44:28 2015 UTC,He hasn't been throwing for six months with no issues.  They shut him down just a shade over five months ago.  Unless I'm mistaken he hasn't thrown from a mound since his last game action.  I hope he's okay.  Knebel was a guy I was really looking forward to seeing in the Rangers' pen.  He was striking out something like two guys per inning after coming over from the Tigers.  If not for the elbow the Rangers probably would have called him up in September.
Brewers,2szdly,Colonel_Rhombus,2,Tue Jan 20 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"Meant to put weeks instead of months, but I'm just relaying what I read elsewhere. I'll try and find the source."
Brewers,2szdly,mattwise15,-1,Tue Jan 20 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"UIFs are what we needed, really."
Brewers,2szdly,smiles134,4,Tue Jan 20 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like I'm alone in hating this deal, from reading the other posts.   Sardinas is Rey Ordonez at best. He doesn't have a big league bat, and likely never will. That he's 21 and has tasted the big leagues is basically the only reason he has value. Knebel is a walk-happy, injury-prone reliever. Diplan walked 5 batters per 9, and his numbers were massively inflated by a .154 BABIP. Honestly, he's got flame-out written all over him. You never know for sure with 18 year old pitchers... but this was not a bet with smart odds.   We traded a quarter for three nickels. Unless we turn the cost savings into James Shields I'm finding it really, really hard to see any positives."
Brewers,2szdly,BaseballGuyCAA,3,Mon Jan 19 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that the Brewers traded for a guy because he has 125 major league PA? They like Sardinas because he's young, has a solid glove and is quick. He can play three infield positions and anything he does with his bat is a bonus.  Knebel has walked 3.55 guys per 9 innings in his career. Slightly below average, but far from walk happy.   There is no reason to judge a 17 year old by his numbers and try to break them down. All you need to know about him is that he has a fastball that already touches 95 and an above average breaking ball. If he was a high school pitcher he would generate a lot of buzz as a first round pick with stuff like that.   They are trading a pitcher who has been average/slightly above average for three straight years and is leaving Milwaukee in October. This is extremely fair value for Gallardo."
Brewers,2szdly,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"The trade is a win because they got more in return than what Gallardo is worth right now.  The sum is probably zero for this year but its a win long term.  Gallardo was due a lot of money and wasnt expected to provide much production for a team that is expected to finish below .500.  And he was a free agent at the end of the season, and it would have been silly to bring him in for more money in an extension because of his declining production.  Sardinas isnt an impact guy but he profiles as an average major league 2B and Knebel is a reliever who may or may not help, but he is cost controlled for 6 years and if he pans out its great.  Diplan is too early to tell on anything, but if he starts to pan out (which I am not really expecting given the Brewers track record in developing pitchers) that is also a plus.  The trade would have been a good one even if it were only Gallardo for Sardinas straight up."
Brewers,2szdly,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"You might be the single most optimistic person I've ever spoken to regarding Luis Sardinas, and that includes quite a few prospect hounds.  I was hearing rumors two days ago that the return was going to be centered around Luke Jackson. And I'd have been okay with Jackson and Knebel, for a lot of the reasons in your second paragraph.  But, I'm sorry, I don't believe Sardinas will ever be more than a versatile defensive super-sub who can't hit. You don't pay for pieces like that unless you're right on the cusp of a championship and that's what you need to get over the top."
Brewers,2szdly,BaseballGuyCAA,1 point,Tue Jan 20 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure who you've been talking to, but league average middle infielder seems to be the consensus, possibly even below what most people see his ceiling at. Three random articles on him brought these quotes, and I left out some of the more optimistic ones.   ""On defense, the glove grades as plus, with soft hands and a very smooth backhand pickup. The body is lean and lanky, but his movements in the field are fast-twitch and his reactions are impressive despite some deficiencies in the strength department. The arm is plus and capable of all the throws, although his accuracy is still in need of refinement. The overall profile at the premium spot is 60-grade, and will eventually keep him employed at the major league level for a very long time.""  http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/luis-sardinas-texas-rangers-best-shortstop-youve-never-heard-of/  ""Overall I think Sardinas is a good player with solid major league potential. At this point in his career, Sardinas is a relatively low risk prospect so he does have decent trade value. Honestly I do not see a way for Sardinas to stay with the Rangers for much longer past the 2015 season. He is at the position of least need for the Rangers current major league club and has enough trade value to bring back a solid return if he was a part of a good package. Sardinas will be at least a utility middle infielder for a big league club within the next 2 years and could be an average to above average every day short stop at the major league level for years to come."""
Brewers,2szdly,sjm1541,3,Tue Jan 20 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"So are these pitchers bullpen guys for us?  Edit, Diplan is 18 yo."
Brewers,2szdly,JayZStillsNashnYoung,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"According to the scouting report, Diplan could be a guy they'd start. Knebel, I think, is a bullpen guy."
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"These are all young players, I'm guessing they're staying in our minor league system at the start of the year, at least."
Brewers,2szdly,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:01:08 2015 UTC,Right. I meant eventually they might look to put Diplan on the staff. Like years from now this might be an option. I could see Sardinas being on the opening day roster. Knebel will start in the minors probably as he was shutdown last season with elbow issues.
Brewers,2szdly,meltedlaundry,2,Mon Jan 19 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright"
Brewers,2szdly,smiles134,2,Mon Jan 19 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"I like this deal but only if we get somebody with it, clears a good bit of money and really helps the farm. Who do you think we go after with the money, guys, if anybody?"
Brewers,2szdly,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"Since the Brewers are paying $4m of Gallardo's $13m, it doesn't really clear that much money. Plus the Brewers will be losing the first round compensatory pick that Gallardo would've gleaned in 2016's draft.  Also an innings eater that will guarantee you a 3.5-3.7 ERA is incredibly valuable, at least 15 teams would love to have Gallardo at 9m and would have given way more than what Texas gave up.  Rangers made out like bandits. How does Doug Melvin still have a job?"
Brewers,2szdly,MustBeNice,-1,Mon Jan 19 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"There is no one else on the Free Agent market right now that is worth spending the money on.  Shields is going to wind up with Detroit now, so the best option probably is Ryan Vogelsong, nice pitcher but not for Miller Park."
Brewers,2szdly,workthrowaway68,1 point,Thu Jan 22 08:10:37 2015 UTC,"Then again, they (FO) could be blowing it up and this is the start of a new Brewers team. If we lose Luc and Gomez it will be extremely painful but the haul may very well be worth it. I kinda hope we struggle and fire sale for some elite prospects at the dead line. I feel like a blow up needs to be done and we will have some high interest pieces for contenders. Some team would love to have Gomez if they have an outfield need keeping them out of WS contention."
Brewers,2szdly,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Mon Jan 19 22:59:59 2015 UTC,Luc's contract is too good to part with unless they're completely starting from scratch.

Since he'll be a FA at the end of the season we may have lost him anyways.  I expect the Brewers will be big sellers if around the trade deadline if they are below 500. This will be an interesting season, I can't wait to see what develops.  Here are the stats on Luis Sardinas. I know its a small sample size but it appears he can't hit RHP....maybe he'll platoon with Segura/Scooter."

Brewers,2syh05,jn2010,2,Tue Jan 20 13:57:05 2015 UTC,So they only give up 90 points a game instead of 100?  Not impressed.
Brewers,2syh05,sjm1541,3,Tue Jan 20 14:11:08 2015 UTC,They also play 8 more minutes and have a shot clock thats 11 seconds shorter. They score more points per game because the game is longer and they're forced to shoot more. Saying that they don't play defense is such a tired argument and they sign of someone who doesn't actually watch the sport.
Brewers,2syh05,jn2010,0,Tue Jan 20 16:43:20 2015 UTC,I'm not claiming they don't play defense.  That's stupid.  I'm just saying the league favors scoring because that's what most people like to watch.  They skew the game to favor offense with things like the 24 second shot clock.  Listing reasons why the score more only strengthens my position.
Brewers,2syh05,sjm1541,3,Tue Jan 20 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"Spoiler alert: every pro sport favors scoring. DH, anyone?"

Thankfully, Lucroy and Gennett are both blue chip players in the organization so it's less likely either will leave or be traded for quite some time."

Brewers,2szj1o,OrfeoKimble,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:57:26 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with a salary dump. Gotta do it every once in awhile in a small market. I just hope we don't try to sign Shields or some other FA pitcher. Let Jimmy or Jungmann get some opportunities.
Brewers,2szj1o,cheezturds,2,Tue Jan 20 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd rather see the team improve upon last year and not revert back to being a sub-.500 team. Not saying we should have kept Gallardo or overpay for someone, but I do think a good replacement should be found. I like this trade as long as management doesn't sit still."
Brewers,2szj1o,MustBeNice,0,Tue Jan 20 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"Jungmann's minor league WHIP is 1.336 with no signs of improving. He's nowhere near an MLB callup, & he's 25. He'll maybe get a cup of coffee at best at this point. Pretty disappointing."
Brewers,2sz6yb,jamesbutcooler,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty good time for the most part. Lots of free autographs from younger players, question and answer sessions, etc. You might find yourself running into Doug Melvn, if you're lucky like I was. It might not be as bad as last year, but there will be shit tons of people to walk around. They also have this really shitty system of deciding who will get autographs from the really popular players (some one else could describe it better than me). Overall, if you got someone to go with it's a pretty good bargain."
Brewers,2sz6yb,adam7765,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"I believe the premium autographs are based on a number on your ticket. I haven't gone in 2 years, so I could be wrong though."
Brewers,2sz6yb,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:37:36 2015 UTC,I went last year and it was pretty cool. Got to see a bunch of players. Got Lohse's autograph and there was a ton of different activities and stuff for sale. It was also there that they announced the garza signing officially so that was cool. The only thing is now you have to pay for it. I don't think it's that worth it to pay I think it's $15 (at least for me because I'm a broke college kid).
Brewers,2sz6yb,kryle,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"It's a good time. Didn't go last year, but went the previous three or so. You kind of need to make up your mind ahead of time though on whether you want autographs or to take in the festivities. It's great for kids, but if you want one of the premium autographs, prepare to stand in line for awhile to hold a spot and then just to wait for the line to go through."
Brewers,2sxzpo,meltedlaundry,3,Mon Jan 19 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"...alright, I guess I'd be alright. I hope this isn't it though. Throw in a MLB-ready bullpen arm and it's a deal.  Sardinas is primarily a middle infielder, which I think we have a nice future with Gennett/Segura. But he's a utility infielder and has some 3B experience. I think that's where he'd be nice. Have him work under Ramirez this year and take the reins after he leaves?  But keep in mind it also frees up some salary space to bring in another pitcher, maybe James Shields yet?!"
Brewers,2sxzpo,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:50:15 2015 UTC,I was also kind of thinking it's insurance in case Segura struggles again next season.
Brewers,2sxzpo,BrewCrewKevin,3,Mon Jan 19 17:59:01 2015 UTC,YES. Good call.
Brewers,2sxzpo,necropaw,4,Mon Jan 19 18:01:30 2015 UTC,Hopefully we get a bullpen arm or a good starting prospect or something along with it.
Brewers,2sxzpo,sjm1541,0,Mon Jan 19 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sardinas is supposedly their 9th highest prospect. If we traded away our #1 pitcher for just that, I'm going to be pretty disappointed."
Brewers,2sxzpo,Robert_The_Tire,2,Mon Jan 19 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"If the Brewers trade Gallardo it won't just be for Sardinas. Even if he is the only player that comes back from Texas it's about clearing up money as much as it is getting back prospects.  Gallardo is gone after this year. If they Brewers wanted to get anything for him down the road they would need to risk waiting until the deadline, or offering him a QO for about 16 million. Getting rid of him right now makes the most sense and they can make a secondary move once his money is off the books."
Brewers,2sxzpo,sjm1541,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but why not get as much as you can for him? We need bullpen people, we should go for it."
Brewers,2sxzpo,dusters,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"They are going to get maximum value for him, but right now it's not that high. Sardinas is a good player and rated very highly by some prospect evaluators. Sometimes you just need to take the first deal that you like if it opens up other opportunities you feel can help the team win. (Signing Shields)"
Brewers,2sxzpo,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Jan 19 20:57:19 2015 UTC,Well to be fair any other teams 9th best prospect would probably instantly turn into a top 3 prospect for us.
Brewers,2sxzpo,sjm1541,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:31:09 2015 UTC,An unfortunate good point.
Brewers,2sxzpo,prof_shine,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:41:18 2015 UTC,"don't be too disappointed.  The fact that Gallardo is/was the #1 speaks volumes to how bad the picthing staff really is..  I think the post on top hits it on the head, its probably Sardinas and a bullpen arm and the team should feel really fortunate for that return.  Gallardo has been in a steady decline for the past few seasons and should have been traded two July's ago."
Brewers,2sxzpo,emiller5220,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Depending on what metrics you want to use, you could make the argument that Gallardo would come into the season as the Brewers 3rd-5th best pitcher. Assuming all Brewers pitchers stayed healthy, if Jimmy Nelson were to break out next year he very well could have ended up the 6th best pitcher on the team.   I think you also undervalue how much teams value consistency. The Rangers are getting a pitcher that was better in 2014 than 2013, threw harder and has given the Brewers 30+ starts a year since he tore his ACL in 08."
Brewers,2sxzpo,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Yo is our #1 pitcher. If he has another good year like last year, that's probably Wily. Yo, Lohse, and Garza all seem like #2s or #3s to me. I just hope Fiers can keep it going for a whole season, and that Jimmy doesn't suck."
Brewers,2sxzpo,SuddenRedScare,2,Mon Jan 19 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"Looking at his minors stats, he's another guy who doesn't walk, does not appear to offer a whole lot at the plate. Is he a defensive wizard?"
Brewers,2sxzpo,sjm1541,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"When he gets the ABs, his numbers offensively are actually pretty good. His career minor league slash is .289/.336/.355. He's obviously not a slugger but I like the other two stats. Couple that with that he can steal a base or two, and this doesn't look as bad as I thought it did."

Win now, then think about selling."
Brewers,2svx55,jubjub2184,2,Mon Jan 19 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"i 100% know what youre saying, but this is a team on the decline.  Our Farm system is still years out from being good, and our vets are getting old.  Last year we rode the first month fo the year, frankly.  We had an opening month for the record books, but beyond that were relatively average.  I just dont think the Brewers can afford to do what even the Cards/Cubs can and buy a team when they get a slight bit of talent.  It feels like we need to sell out for a few yeras, get a bunch of talent, then buy what other talent we need and make a run.  Plus to be honest, i think the Cubs are going to be the team to beat the next couple years, and after that it'll probably be the fucking Cards.  Beyond that we still have the Pirates and Reds.  Were in a damn good divison and it makes it kinda rough on us :("
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"Last years team was a complete illusion, buoyed by their good April.  What they did from June 1 through the end of the season is a more realistic view of expectations for this team.  A rebuild is long overdue for this team.  And even though ownership/management probably feel the same way that you do about the talent level on the team, 2015 is most likely the beginning of a long slide down to top 5 draft picks for the next 5 years or so."
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,3,Mon Jan 19 19:13:30 2015 UTC,This is the best approach for the team to take but I don't think that ownership has the stomach for it.
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,3,Mon Jan 19 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i agree.  They wont do it, but if they want to win a WS thats what they need to do."
Brewers,2svx55,TheBause,2,Mon Jan 19 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"They need to do it for the long haul, and probably takes more like 5-7 years and they need completely new management.  Melvin doesn't know how to run a rebuild.  But his heir apparent Ray Montgomery might be.  And they would need to stop making stupid short term free agent signings and start to really trade off vets, starting with Gomez, Lohse and Garza."
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Jan 19 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"It'd be hard to see Luc go, but our top 2-3 pitchers and Gogo/Siggy would probably get us a good start.  That being said, is it fair to keep luc around in the lean years?  That guy deserves a ring."

Brewers,2svx55,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Mon Jan 19 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Right?  We could get so much for him, but still...  On the other hand, i'd feel so bad for him being on a bad team for 3-4 years :/"
Brewers,2svx55,sjm1541,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"Well, you keep him around until that sweet team friendly contract of his runs out, then you really stock the farm with him.  I'm still not convinced that he will be a perennial all star type.  I tend to think that the defensive metrics that really reward him for his pitch framing ability are a bit overblown."
Brewers,2svx55,BurtDoyle,2,Mon Jan 19 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"Offensively, Lucroy has been a top 3 catcher over the past three seasons. He's an All Star because he can hit from the catcher position, the defense is just a bonus.   I think catcher framing has more to do with the pitchers than people wold like to admit. It's still a skill but I agree it can be overrated. Maldonado is as good as Lucroy, if not better, based on most framing statistics and I don't know if its just by chance that the Brewers have two of the best."
Brewers,2svx55,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"Maldonado is as good as Lucroy, if not better, based on most framing statistics and I don't know if its just by chance that the Brewers have two of the best.   Lol.   Since 2010, Lucroy has gotten the most extra strikes called of any catcher in the game through framing: 715 extra strikes, saving an estimated 85 runs. The next best total is a distant second: Miguel Montero with 407 extra strikes and 48 runs saved. In other words, Lucroy's ability to frame pitches is fucking ridiculous compared to Maldonado or any other catcher in baseball and it isn't even close."
Brewers,2svx55,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Jan 20 08:12:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you watch many Brewers games, but Lucroy catches a lot more than Maldonado. Of course he is going to save more runs, he plays more.   According to Stats Corner, in 2015 Maldonado gained an extra 1.64 strikes per game while Lucroy gains only 1.29. In 2013 it was 1.85 to Lucory, 1.82 extra strikes to Maldonado.   According to Baseball Prospectus, in 2014 Maldonado gained an extra strike every 33 pitches, while it took Lucroy 65 pitches for each strike he gained for his pitcher.  If you want to try to be condescending do a bit more research. It's obviously not fair to compare Lucroy and Maldonado using counting statistics rather than per game statistics."
Brewers,2svx55,Nadie_AZ,2,Tue Jan 20 08:32:59 2015 UTC,"I dont think Milwaukee/Wisconsin would support a team that is attempting to rebuild.  The current strategy consistently gets close to 3 million people in the seats and with rev sharing that allows us to field around 100mil payroll.  We have to hit on prospects and trades at an alarming rate to ever make a run for a title, but heck, just last year we had a legitimate chance had the bullpen/hitting continued into the end of the year."
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Jan 19 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this since the cubs became realistic condenders, too. I was saying we would do 1 more year of this, then re-build the farm system for a few years. But now with so many other contenders, I wonder if it's worth putting the effort in at all.  I think I still hope for 1 more year. We've got to use these guys while we can. We were #1 in the league for much of last year, and this team really has what it takes. We plugged a pretty big hole at first, and we need some bullpen yet, but we're pretty close to an all-around team yet.  The Brewers will go into rebuilding mode in the next year or 2. I guarantee it. But it may not be obvious to most fans. I'm sure a lot of us will see it, but you know Doug Melvin will still give PC answers like ""we're always looking to contend"" and all that. And we'll keep a couple of franchise guys (Braun, Luc) around no matter what.  With shopping Gallardo around, depending on the deal announced probably today or tomorrow, might be a pretty good sign as to what they are doing. If we get a couple prospects for him, it's all over until about 2017 or 18."
Brewers,2svx55,OrfeoKimble,2,Mon Jan 19 15:22:13 2015 UTC,"I do kinda wonder if they'll do a major league farm system or something.  Keep enough talent in the majors to get them noticed and sell em off later, and keep fans in the stands.  Its just hard for a smaller market team to really be able to sell everyone off and still have fans show up to games."
Brewers,2svx55,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and  realistically they can't really just sell out 100% anyways. You lose fans, you lose revenue, you lose the interest of the franchise players. It's really not fair to keep guys like Braun and Lucroy, and even some of the newer guys like Segura, around if they aren't supported.   Nobody will come right out and say they are rebuilding. It'll be subtle. It'll be like you are saying- they will keep Braun and Luc and a couple other veterans, but they'll rely on our current home-grown guys that will stay relatively cheap to fill the rest of the team- Segura, Genett, Khris Davis, etc. The only difference you'll really see is not bringing in big name guys like they have the last handful of years (CC, Grienke, Ramirez, etc.)  I'd say they even are in re-building mode to a certain extent. They were hesitant enough last year to make a class-B move to aquire Gerardo Parra. Good move, but not a ""we are in this to win this"" move. And in the off-season, Adam Lind is the only move we've made so far. If they brought in a guy like Scherzer (who now went to the nats), then maybe I'd think they were in it this year."
Brewers,2svx55,theamazingkiwi,3,Mon Jan 19 15:48:47 2015 UTC,There is no need to hit the panic button yet. There is a lot of talent and upside with the current roster.
Brewers,2svx55,crewblue,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you except to say that the team has ""not a lot of impact talent and no real upside outside of 5 years"".  the pitching staff as a whole is average at best, its best player is on the downside of his career, the young players aren't really all that special, the farm system is horrible, and its not panicking, a rebuild like the one suggested here is a sensible and logical idea."

Brewers,2svx55,robomummy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:55:51 2015 UTC,I was thinking that the Brewers should have shopped around Gomez if they could get a power bat/corner infielder and started Parra in center for the season. Probably not feasible now that they brought back Ramirez and traded for Adam Lind. It seemed like he had a breakdown of trust with the coaching staff towards the end of the season because of his extreme aggressiveness at the plate.
Brewers,2svx55,northernrecordings,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say. The Brewers are coming back almost complete with a much better bat at one of the corners, the pen is a little weak but we have a good chance of Helweg and Thornburg come back healthy. Our rotation is strong and I was going to say there was a good chance that we land Scherzer but it looks as if he is going to the Nationals. If we can land Shields it will be a huge boost to our rotation. I think we have it in us for at least one more year. We were solid until late last year, as bad as it was we were still playing meaningful baseball in September. I think we should take one more shot. Our farm system isn't as bad as it used to be, we had a really good draft this year and our prospects that are close aren't stars but they are still decent and may make for some good trade bait. I don't want to admit defeat quite yet, I just can't bring myself to think that the Cubs are going to be better than us. :)"
Brewers,2svx55,tr1ppn,2,Mon Jan 19 05:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think we have it in us for at least one more year.   Youre maybe right there, but beyond a year scares me.   And frankly, the other thing that worries me is how much the Cubs have put into the next couple years.  THeyve done what i posted.  THey really, really, really sucked for 4-5 years for top draft picks, and theyve saved the money to make big name signings to fill the other gaps.  The question is if the Brewers can keep up with that."
Brewers,2svx55,TheBause,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"I know and I have the same fear as you. I really hope that Attanasio wants to put the time into making this a championship team. He has clearly showed that he's willing to put the money in, although I  wished we spent it a little better. I have hope that we can be the little team that could but I just fear the bigger teams like the Cubs and Cardinals are too much to handle over the next couple years. I actually think this is our last shot before it becomes the Cubs time to shine. Here's to one hell of a year!   Can we please sign Shields?"

Brewers,2suyn8,workthrowaway68,-2,Mon Jan 19 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"Quite a surprising development if anything happens.  But I wouldn't expect much in return.  Gallardo has virtually no trade value at all this year because of his salary and declining performance.  And the thought out there that maybe it frees up room for Scherzer (absolutely ridiculous) or Shields (potentally true, but not a great idea) is only half baked.  The most surprising thing to me is that the team had the insane belief that they were going to contend this year and giving away one of the starting 5 doesn't jive with that."
Brewers,2sv0av,fanbaseballpuck,2,Sun Jan 18 20:27:12 2015 UTC,He is a free agent after this year it could make sense depending on what they get in return.
Brewers,2sv0av,crewblue,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:51:57 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly sure what they are looking to get back. Sardinas seems to be the most attainable prospect but he doesn't really fit the Brewers' plans
Brewers,2sv0av,crewblue,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:04:50 2015 UTC,This is as much about clearing up payroll and the logjam in the rotation for younger players as it is about restocking the farm system and getting something for a song-to-be free agent.
Brewers,2sv0av,workthrowaway68,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"Sardinas is probably abour right, and he could be a right handed platoon partner for Gennett at 2B.  Gallardo doesn't really have much value at all given his salary.  Unless you were to sign him to an extension first, but why would anyone?  My guess is that its a reliever and Sardinas for Gallardo and at the very worst it simply turns the 2015 Brewers into a 75 win team instead of a 77 win team."

And the rotation would still consist of Lohse, Garza, Peralta, Fiers, Nelson. Sure, 3 young guys there, but they've all shown quite a bit of promise.  It all depends on what we get for him. If we get a long-term 3rd basement and maybe a bullpen arm or 2? Worth it in my book."
Brewers,2sv0av,smaug8821,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Buddy of mine is guessing that we are in the market for Shields or Scherzer now. I'm not sure he has any real info behind it, but it would be interesting."

Brewers,2sv0av,SolidRambo,2,Sun Jan 18 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"Wont be Scherzer, never would have been anyway, because he is going to sign with the Nationals.  Shields might be do-able, as stupid as it would be, but he is a guy going from a very pitcher friendly park to a very hitter friendly park.  He maybe has one all star type year left before his age and Miller Park start to make it a horrible contract, considering what he is looking for."

He also dealt with some bad luck (BABIP .275 - Career BABIP .302). He should be closer to the .270 mark by season's end with a WAR over 2.0.   I completely agree with you on Braun. If his thumb feels as good as he is saying, we could all be in store for quite a show. I've always liked the chip on his shoulder and you know he wants to prove to the world that he can produce at an MVP caliber without PED's. This is going to be the most crucial aspect of the 2015 Brewers. If Braun gets back to a 5-7 WAR, they can linger around the wildcard hunt all year. If not, it's really going to be a grind.  Lastly, Scooter's a career .300 hitter over 700+ PA's. A small sample size, but nothing to shake a stick at. I don't see him keeping that up throughout his career, but I do see him as a .280 guy due to his decent contact rate and good line drive rate.  Can't wait for Opening Day!"
Brewers,2sjci3,lukewarmx,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I have a feeling that Marco is going to have a realllly good year.  I mean even if he's a solid 3rd starter, that's INFINITELY more valuable than an aging platoon first baseman who hasn't even reached 550 AB's in a season since 2010. Also Lind will cost over twice as much as Marco.  This deal is going to bite Doug Melvin in the ass. Even if you didn't like Marco, there was a LOT of interest in him around the league, especially since many of his home runs allowed were due to the small confines of Miller Park.  Considering all this, Adam Lind feels like a ripoff."
Brewers,2sjci3,MustBeNice,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:51:16 2015 UTC,"""Even if he's a solid third starter"" is really overstating what a 31 year old who has never been able to stay healthy for a full season and is coming off of his worst year can do. The Brewers had nothing at first base and are deep enough with starters to make this a no brainer.   Also, considering 18 of his 29 HRs were given up on the road I don't think it's fair to say that many of his home runs were due to Miller Park. Rogers Center is actually HIGHER on the HR/game list than Miller Park is. It's not like Toronto is set up for pitchers to succeed.   On top of all that, Estrada isn't making half of what Lind is this year. Lind is making 7.5 million, and Estarda made 3.3 last year and has yet to recieve his salary for this year. I'd be surprised if it was anything less than 5.5 million.   Do you really want to keep Estrada at 5.5 million when you already have Lohse, Gallardo, Fiers, Garza, Nelson, Peralta? Or would you rather trade him for a first baseman who is a significant upgrade and can give you 350+ quality ABs against righties."

Brewers,2sg95m,snackshack,1 point,Tue Jan 20 05:40:20 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee are a strange team... we have one of the best lineups in baseball and you'll witness some truly excellent hitting by Jonathan Lucroy, Carlos Gomez, Aramis Ramirez, Ryan Braun, Scooter Gennett, etc. Despite that, we'll be lucky to crack 86 wins because our entire starting rotation is made up of third place starters, our bullpen is shit, and our division is a meat grinder.  In short, you'll have fun if you enjoy offense and you'll feel hollow and suicidal when August and September roll around because all that offense still can't get us a wildcard berth."

Brewers,2sg95m,Ofreo,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:43:20 2015 UTC,It's for one single ticket for one single game (plus the 9 you get this year)
Brewers,2sg95m,msgbonehead,0,Thu Jan 15 19:01:35 2015 UTC,That's my reading of it. Buy this and you can go to any Brewers game you please for this season and every season going forward as long as they're the Milwaukee Brewers.
Brewers,2sg95m,Cursor_Disco,3,Thu Jan 15 05:47:58 2015 UTC,No it's definitely one game of your choosing in the future with the ability to buy 3 seats next to it at face value. (even playoffs or world series)  You also get 9 single game tickets this year that aren't opening day.

Brewers,2sg95m,BrewCrewKevin,2,Wed Jan 14 23:14:10 2015 UTC,It's 9 regular season games + the ticket to a WS game.  I still don't think it would be worth it unless you were guaranteed great seats for the WS game of your choice.

I'm sure they'd do everything they could... but then again there's alread 240 out there and that's just presale. If thousands get sold, you know damn well everybody would cash them in for a WS."
Brewers,2sg95m,mistrbrownstone,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"Its not guaranteed, but it sounds you could get the ticket anytime in advance. So you could up three weeks or even months before, say a Sunday game against St  Louis, and get the ticket reserved."
Brewers,2sg95m,msgbonehead,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"Only 1000 are being sold, and it's also up to 4 tickets for whatever game up to 10 times.   So even if your seat is $20, you get 40 tickets for $800, and the unique brass ticket for $200. If you do the math it's actually a great deal."
Brewers,2sh1ii,fanbaseballpuck,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:31:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, and I always like fantasy speculation. However, one thing I would like to point out is that the Hamels trade being suggested seems like too much of a pipe dream. The asking price is just too high for the Brewers, yet, ironically, most likely not high enough to land Hamels. In addition, Hamels has a no-trade clause in his contract where he would likely veto a trade to the Brewers if the Brewers tried to acquire him in the first place."
Brewers,2sh1ii,Cubert_J_Farnsworth,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:14:58 2015 UTC,I just figured that for the Brewers to make a run at the playoffs they would have to do something drastic(much more than just looking for bullpen help like the rumors are saying ). You're right about the veto but if I was in Hamels' position I would see that offense a very realistic chance to compete in the playoffs.

Brewers,2sbqlk,BraveChewWorld,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:45:23 2015 UTC,"Segura could be all over the place depending on how he does in spring training. Gomez at 2nd actually seems like a good idea, it prevents him from stealing 2nd and getting out, it allows him to focus on hitting a fly ball to advance the leadoff guy, and he can potentially get 2 runs off a hit by the 3rd/4th guy instead of 1."
Brewers,2sbqlk,CJL13,1 point,Wed Jan 14 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"So why don't managers use this logic when constructing their lineups?  There is so much money involved, and the stakes are so high, it seems like managers should use every possible (legal) advantage to squeak out every single win they can.  Teams clearly have the resources to hire statisticians to tell them things like this."

But for those who have been brewer fan longer than the last like... 10 years or so.. know that despite an unbearable September, that was actually one of the best seasons we've had. It's pretty rare for the Brewers to actually lead the league for the majority of the season and contend right up to the last few games."
Brewers,2s442n,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Mon Jan 12 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"The bullpen really wasn't the problem last year, it was just the thing that most fans tend to concentrate on when things go badly. And it wont be the issue this year.  DM is constrained by the payroll more than he is confident in what he has.  I think Broxton and Jeffress should be fine, and Kintzler and Thornburg are ok as well, and he will pick up some scrap heap guy like he always does before spring training."
Brewers,2s442n,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"I can agree that it wasn't THE problem, but they certainly weren't great..  Taking a look at the stats.. we were in middle or towards the bottom of the NL in many categories (ERA, SV%, W/L, among others).  What really bit us in the ass? HR's, BAA and SLG%. We were 2nd worst in the NL in all three. If DM is looking for new relievers, I really hope they're groundball pitchers.   Something nice to talk about? Well, K/BB was among highest in the league, and our HBP and WP totals were lowest in the league by a considerable margin. So at least we weren't just giving the games away.

Brewers,2s442n,legit_,2,Tue Jan 13 11:09:35 2015 UTC,"I guess he has trust in Henderson, Jeffress, the fresh prince, and Broxton.  They will give Wooten and Kintzler too many innings and things are gonna get bad.  The fact that Gorzelanny only signed for 1 million....  Doug pls we need 1 more bullpen guy..  What if K-Rod comes back again after Henderson shows up with an 86mph fastball."
Brewers,2s442n,trainwreck00,2,Mon Jan 12 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Broxton isn't a decent reliever, but his numbers against NL Central opponents are noticeably poor compared to out-of-division competition. The fact the team will be paying him $10MM to go Oprah in terms of giving up hits to the Reds, Cardinals, and Cubs when Gorzelanny signed for $1MM turns my stomach."
Brewers,2s442n,trainwreck00,2,Mon Jan 12 01:23:43 2015 UTC,Indeed.  I think id rather try another year of k-rod than have broxton. The 1 mill for Gorz made me scratch my head.

They're running out of options, and I think this game of waiting till the last minute to sign cheap washed veterans is really dumb.  I would like to see K-Rod come back, but he might be asking for a lot.."
Brewers,2s442n,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:15:57 2015 UTC,2 years ago they got burned because they had a bullpen full of guys who didn't have any minir league options left. I expect Doug wants someone who can spend some time in Colorado Springs if performance goes south.
Brewers,2s442n,gobrewcrew,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"We'll see, but I feel like even if we would/could have gone into full win-now mode and tried to make some bigger splashes for personnel, we probably weren't going to be competitive enough. Might not be what Mark wants, but we're probably better off looking into re-building for now."
Brewers,2s442n,captainp42,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:28:03 2015 UTC,A trend I've noticed over the last few years is that very few bullpen guys are great for consecutive years.   Maybe it's best to let the guys who perform well go elsewhere?
Brewers,2s442n,tr1ppn,1 point,Mon Jan 12 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not very confident in it either, but there are flat out not a lot of consistently good relievers out there to begin with, so nearly all of them are a total crapshoot, minus the real gems.   It would be nice to have one (or more) real bullpen gems, but I just don't see that happening. More likely is that the Brewers make do with what they have, and move along from there. Any player in that bullpen could play up to maximum potential in any given year and be great, it's just a matter of that happening.  Also, seeing those 2 guys walk hurt a bit. Duke was nearly lights out as a specialist, and Gorzelanny looked like he had enough gas left in the tank for another good year. Maybe Melvin knows something we don't about it."
Brewers,2s442n,extra_less,2,Mon Jan 12 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind maybe those guys moved on because they didn't like their role, teammates, or just wanted to play elsewhere. Players move for all kinds of reasons."
Brewers,2s442n,extra_less,2,Wed Jan 14 22:46:20 2015 UTC,I just looked-up Duke's contract:  He made $850k with the Brewers last year.  He signed a 3 year $15m deal with the White Sox; that's a big raise. http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dukeza01.shtml#contracts
Brewers,2s442n,tr1ppn,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:56:27 2015 UTC,Wow. I don't know if I would have been happy for the crew to have offered that. I hadn't heard about his contract until then.
Brewers,2s442n,lukewarmx,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:04:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely insane deal. I don't have trust in many relievers to fork out a three year deal OR that much cash.  The small sample sizes in terms of innings pitched each year are super misleading.

It's like talking to a potential girlfriend on the first date hoping for the best, but knowing it'll probably end badly.  You know the odds are bad, but you're always hopeful.  It makes for a very stressful January.  In '10 I couldn't stop laughing with joy.  '11 I couldn't stop crying.  It really is a flaw in my psyche.  The Brewers are different.  The highs and lows are more gradual so they don't have the same impact.  I think that's a good thing for me.  Anyway, go Pack!  Fuck Dallas!"

But the atmosphere at Lambeau is magical.  I still remember the first time I walked into the stands there.  I was 10ish.  It was just a preseason game but the players were warming up on the field.  It was like watching gladiators in the coliseum.  I will never forget that feeling of just walking into the best venue in sports.  After that tangent, I'll just say that I like football more than baseball.  The coordination and teamwork involved is a privilege to watch.  One person of 11 can screw up and blow up the play.  It's like watching a violent ballet.  I love the sport and everything about it (except the danger involved).  It's better than baseball for me.

You cannot attribute his first season's success whether other hitters were prepared for him or not, or knew nothing about him, or didn't have ""a book on him"". He deserves more credit than that.  Last year was a tough year for him personally, and I think he can regain form."

Brewers,2r1xqe,necropaw,3,Fri Jan 2 02:26:22 2015 UTC,"Wi leo here. Obscuring a plate is illegal. True that the plate can be ran and shows valid or exp, but why risk it?

Brewers,2r1xqe,pfitz6,4,Fri Jan 2 16:24:05 2015 UTC,they only become illegal if put on a vehicle. Nothing is innately illegal about them.
Brewers,2r1xqe,Amoney8612,2,Fri Jan 2 17:17:54 2015 UTC,Not all license plates have sticker locations that are in the bottom corners.

That shit drives me crazy, and I'd stop every last one of them...if I could.  I've often thought, I KNOW that's not legal, but these folks clearly get away with it for years.    Also, to OP, you can probably find a legal frame.  I wanted a Wisco Alumni one forever.  Eventually, I found one that essentially curves around where the stickers are supposed to be placed.  They are entirely visible."

Brewers,2qnex9,hawks45,7,Sun Dec 28 21:51:50 2014 UTC,"I'm surprised how undersold Lind's bat is in these comments.  This guy is a legitimate impact bat against RHPs.  For the 2013-'14 seasons, only 4 players were better v. RHP by wOBA:  2013-2014 vs. RHP (all positions, min. 500 PA)  1) Mike Trout, .415 wOBA  2) Miguel Cabrera, .411 wOBA  3) David Ortiz, .405 wOBA  4) Troy Tulowitzki, .403 wOBA  5) Adam Lind, .402 wOBA (.327/.395/.537/.931)  ...  In short, I don't care if you have to find a platoon partner for that bat."
Brewers,2qnex9,CM816,5,Mon Dec 29 16:08:15 2014 UTC,I like the Lind trade but he's awful at hitting lefty's. We'd still need a righty to platoon with him at 1B.
Brewers,2qnex9,meltedlaundry,3,Mon Dec 29 01:42:14 2014 UTC,"Plus, as a Jays fan also, I know first hand that you can not have him in the lineup every day anyway because of durability. He torched righties though, which was fantastic. A decent righty to platoon with will be just what the doctor ordered!"
Brewers,2qnex9,vincey12,2,Mon Dec 29 07:07:32 2014 UTC,"I'm hoping we can still find a decent righty, I was hoping we would have looked at Hart but too late for that."

Brewers,2qnex9,gobrewcrew,2,Mon Dec 29 01:52:23 2014 UTC,Not really all that excited about a platoon guy.  In the end he's only marginally better than Mark Reynolds imo. Mark had legit power and a terrific glove.
Brewers,2qnex9,MustBeNice,2,Mon Dec 29 08:15:43 2014 UTC,"If you put Reynolds and Linds season together it turns out to be a really good production from 1B.  Definitely an upgrade, but still doesnt instantly turn them into contenders.  At this point, without a RH platoon partner, they are just trading Linds production for Reynolds'."
Brewers,2qnex9,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Dec 29 15:18:04 2014 UTC,"No, Lind will face far more RHP than Reynolds faced LHP."
Brewers,2qnex9,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Mon Dec 29 18:51:11 2014 UTC,"Partially true,  but he was a platoon guy in Toronto last year and put up a 1.6 WAR, so if you expect the same out of him this coming year, thats exactly what Reynolds put up on the RH side."
Brewers,2qg9qg,IrkenInvaderGir,2,Fri Dec 26 15:51:25 2014 UTC,That's awesome. I'm glad he won the car and the raffle didn't find some loophole to stop him from winning. I'll have to look for the car on campus.

Brewers,2q8opv,sjm1541,2,Thu Dec 25 01:51:04 2014 UTC,"He's been bad for three straight years. His fastball still averages almost 95 so he'll probably get a shot somewhere, but I think the Brewers have enough depth to avoid bringing him on."

Brewers,2q2z3o,brewisbrewin,4,Mon Dec 22 16:59:21 2014 UTC,"The real question we should be asking is ""Will Ron Roenicke get smarter about managing his pitching staff."" The first date when that graph begins to tick upwards happens on the same day this happened, which I think affected Smith for the rest of the season."
Brewers,2q2z3o,minstrel_cramp,3,Mon Dec 22 17:34:07 2014 UTC,"He pitched in 78 games this season and, this quote from the article says it all:  Smith was overused in the first half (43.2 IP) and underused in the second half (22 IP), as this was due to Roenicke’s mismanagement of the bullpen."
Brewers,2q2z3o,SolidRambo,3,Mon Dec 22 23:39:45 2014 UTC,"To be fair to Roenicke, he was was given a bullpen that was a man down all year and they played a lot of close games early on.   They also play 96 games in the ""1st half"" of the season so they split isn't 81-81. On top of, that the emergence of Jeffress and Duke in the second half really helped Roenicke give Smith breaks. It will be much easier next season for Roenicke to keep Smith rested."
Brewers,2q2z3o,sjm1541,2,Tue Dec 23 01:33:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you have a point. Maybe I shouldn't rely on quotes, haha. I meant more to stress the fatigue of Smith rather than Roenicke's bullpen decisions with Wang in mind (heh heh). It seemed in the first half Smith was coming out almost every game and that probably created a cumulative fatigue for him as a young reliever. So even with Jeffress and Duke being utilized more frequently and Smith getting breaks, I think the first half grind took it's toll, especially if we're accepting the graph used in the article (there is certainly more than just ERA that should be considered though, it just provides a convenient argument)."
Brewers,2q2z3o,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:39:29 2014 UTC,Only if Roenicke over uses him again this season.

Brewers,2ozsa1,meltedlaundry,5,Thu Dec 11 19:11:51 2014 UTC,Their hitting coach be like 'put like 25% more pressure on your left pinky on your follow-through' and suddenly both their slash lines take off like the national debt clock at Times Square.
Brewers,2ozsa1,Chief_McCloud,3,Thu Dec 11 21:10:37 2014 UTC,"Don't know about that. Cards fans have been unhappy with their hitting coach, Mabry, since McGwire left. They've had a real lack of power in their lineup for the last couple years.  Reynolds would have led the Cards in HR (and SO!) last year even though he had 200 fewer AB. Jhonny Peralta, their shortstop who was also suspended for dealing with Biogenesis, hit 21 HR to lead the team."

Brewers,2ozsa1,pawlije,3,Thu Dec 11 19:40:15 2014 UTC,"This is fine with me. I think the crew should pick up Allen Craig though. He bats like .345 against lefties, that would make a good complement to Lind. Not to mention Craig can play outfield too."

Brewers,2ozsa1,wegettacos,1 point,Fri Dec 12 04:38:53 2014 UTC,"We could use a short term backup catcher and/or a lefty relief arm. (Ross is probably gone and Miller's gone.)  Think the Brewers want to take a risk on him though? Craig was worse than useless this year, and he's signed for a few more years for a not-insignificant amount of money. I doubt the Red Sox want to eat too much of his salary in a trade, either, although they do have a lot of money coming off the books soon."

I dont think they are contenders at all this year.  Melvin may feel like ""we are ready"" but that ready team is an average one at best.

They are one pitcher away from a very long run of dominance in the division and the league.  There isnt anything the Brewers can really do to combat this.  They will be in decline beginning this year, and Attanasio doesnt have the stomach for a solid, from the bottom up rebuild like the club needs."

Roenicke wanted to put him on for the last home game and Rickie reportedly said ""No, it doesn't mean that much to me."" Rickie has a lot of fans, and I'm sure a lot of them were there knowing it was his last game as a Brewer.   For how bad Weeks seemed, he has a pretty respectable career OBP of .347 over 11 years. Even last year his OBP was .357. I know that doesn't mean everything, but .340+ over 11 years is respectable, especially considering he spent a few seasons batting lead-off. Rickie also has some raw power that was evident in his few home runs he had this year.  I'm thinking if the Cardinals snag him, he will be a decent pick-up if they get him cheap. It's the Cardinal way. Maybe all Weeks needs is  change of scenery, a new hitting coach, a new spot in the lineup."

Plus the Brewers have a $100 million payroll in one of the smallest markets in baseball, so we don't have much wiggle room there."

Brewers,2oorqx,umphreak2x2,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:34:57 2014 UTC,"Exactly. That month of September, Milwaukee's starters played very good baseball. A lot of times it was the offense who didn't come through whether it be from capitalizing with runners on or making poor base running decisions. I can think of at least a couple times with the bases loaded no outs that the brewers still left the inning empty-handed. On the rare occasion (that month) that our offense and starting pitching handed over a lead to the bullpen (albeit usually a small lead) the bullpen would implode and lose the game there. I think the bright point in that terrible month was the starting pitching because I had no faith in that offense in September and they gave me plenty of reasons why."
Brewers,2oorqx,misfit_mascot,-4,Tue Dec 9 13:55:31 2014 UTC,Your rotation was below average though. ERA- had you at 98 which is two percent above average. But FIP-had you at 106 which I'd 6 percent below average. That's the true talent level of your rotation IMO. Defense/luck made your era better than it should have been.
Brewers,2oorqx,umphreak2x2,5,Tue Dec 9 00:08:40 2014 UTC,"Why aren't we looking for better pitching? Established talent, small media market, $100 million plus pay roll. Has nothing to do with your wonderful stats. We're not the Tigers who can snatch a player for $200 million even though he has a bum back."
Brewers,2oorqx,Robert_The_Tire,-1,Tue Dec 9 01:45:37 2014 UTC,It was just a suggestion. I don't think the rotation is terrible but I see them as a great pitcher away from contention.
Brewers,2oorqx,Robert_The_Tire,3,Tue Dec 9 02:32:14 2014 UTC,"We have above average pitching and fielding. We lack depth in the bullpen, but they have been working on it. For the most part we need hitting."
Brewers,2oorqx,OrfeoKimble,-3,Tue Dec 9 00:36:30 2014 UTC,Once again I wouldn't consider your pitching to be above average. Your defense made the rotation's ERA better than it should've been.

Brewers,2nxyp4,IrkenInvaderGir,3,Mon Dec 1 15:43:49 2014 UTC,"For those without Insider Access:  Dodgers acquire: James Paxton from Seattle; Jean Segura from Milwaukee   The Dodgers have a lot of outfield depth and are looking to build with younger players as they seek a World Series title in the near future. Not an easy formula to make transactions. Matt Kemp has five years and $107 million remaining on his contract, and although I think it would be a mistake to trade him, the fact is that the Dodgers are listening to offers. The Mariners could offer them one of the best young left-handed starters in the game in Paxton to put in their rotation behind Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Hyun-Jin Ryu. If they could pick up Segura in a three-way deal with the Brewers, they would have their stopgap shortstop until top prospect Corey Seager is ready for the majors (or is moved to third base). Segura, 24, had a down year, but should return close to his 2013 form, when he hit .294 with 12 home runs and 44 stolen bases. The Dodgers would still have Yasiel Puig, Joc Pederson, Carl Crawford and Andre Ethier in their outfield.   Mariners acquire: Ryan Braun from Milwaukee   If the Mariners want to win the AL West next year, they have to acquire a big right-handed hitter to hit between Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager in their lineup, and Braun would be the perfect fit. GM Jack Zduriencik’s claim to fame when he was with the Brewers was his drafting of Braun, and he’d love to get reunited with him in Seattle. The Mariners have Chris Taylor -- who could take over shortstop for Brad Miller, who would go to Milwaukee in this potential deal -- and would still have a strong starting rotation with Felix Hernandez, Hisashi Iwakuma, Taijuan Walker and Roenis Elias, even if they traded Paxton. Of course, they would have to probably sign a midlevel free agent like Brandon McCarthy or Kyle Kendrick after a trade like this.   Brewers acquire: Matt Kemp from Los Angeles; Miller from Seattle   The Brewers had to be concerned with Braun’s loss of power during the past couple of years. Granted, it’s probably because of the numbness in his right thumb that they now think has completely healed. However, after watching Kemp the last two months of the season, there is no doubt that he would be an upgrade over Braun, and while they may lose some in the swap of shortstops, it would be worth it to have less risk with Kemp than Braun. In addition, the deal would send a wake-up call and be a clubhouse chemistry change to a team that collapsed in September."

Brewers,2nsq68,_Order66,-10,Wed Dec 3 17:05:17 2014 UTC,"As a non-Packer fan Brewer fan...I really don't understand the hate between the two teams' fans. There is no fucking rivalry. AT ALL. It's the spill over retarded fuckin Packer fans who feel the need to talk shit to Chicago fans and vice versa. Wanna talk shit about another team? Why don't we talk shit to the real enemy, the St. Louis Cardinals. I'll say fuck the Cards 365 days a year before I ever say fuck the Cubs.  And to this ""funny"" video, his whole stance is they don't give a shit? Really cause their attendance records say otherwise. They've been in the top 10 or near the top 10 for the last 15 years. White Sox gave a shit when they won the World Series and haven't given a shit since.   This post is stupid and lowers the level of class for Brewer fans and I apologize to any Cub fan who sees this. Bill Burr and whoever posted this is wrong on this one."
Brewers,2nsq68,RadomirPutnik,9,Sun Nov 30 08:49:51 2014 UTC,"The Cards are enemy #1, there's no doubt about that. The thing is, they've earned that. And not in a good way for us. They own us as completely as a team can own its ""rival"". They've beaten us in an LCS and a World Series. That's not even possible for 99% of other teams. And we've won nothing important against them. If we hate them, it's because they're good enough to hate.  The Cubs? They ain't won shit. Ever. And they still strut around like somebody gives a good fuck. Am I supposed to be impressed by your suckitude? That their ""greatest"" player was strung out on more PED's than our (maybe) third best player has ever even seen? And they're all over the fucking place here because of a couple years half a century ago when we had no team? The Crew has been here since there was a South Vietnam. Catch the fuck up.  That's why."

That is the problem most actual baseball fans (not just brewer fans) have with Cub ""fans"". Half of the ""fans"" that go to see a game at Wrigley could give a shit  about the cubs. They are there to party. These are the same people that proudly wear their shiny new cubs jersey and couldn't name 4 current cubs players."
Brewers,2nsq68,workthrowaway68,3,Wed Dec 3 16:56:42 2014 UTC,"Talk about a non rivalry, the Cardinals Brewers is not one.  You have to actually take something from another team or its fan base or win SOMETHING for there to be even a hint of a rivalry.  Take that away and proximity works too, so the Illinois/Missouri border serves as a very good reason for a rivalry with Cardinal and Cub fans.    But Brewers Cardinals? Forget about it. There is an intense jealousy of the Cardinals, but there is no rivalry."
Brewers,2nsq68,SolidRambo,0,Mon Dec 1 01:22:46 2014 UTC,"Not sure why this is getting downvoted. Honestly the days of a -serious- Milwaukee/Chicago rivalry ended when the Brewers moved to the NL and were no longer fighting with the White Sox (sometimes even literally).   Cubs have only been good maybe two seasons since the Brewers moved to the NL, it's hard to say there is a legitimate battle, save maybe the 2007-2008 seasons. Obviously the Cubs are in our division and there's always going to be a ""jockeying for position"" rivalry, but there's more of a legitimate rivalry between the Cardinals and Brewers. Shit, even with the Pirates making it to the playoffs these past two years I'd argue there's more of an IN GAME rivalry than that of the Brewers and Cubs.  I mean yeah, fuck most of their fans for going to games as a social event and spending 99% of their time on their phones and not actually paying attention to the game. But there's obviously more at stake for the team, thus making it more of a rivalry, when the Brewers met the Cardinals in August or when the Brewers and Pirates squared off early in September.  I recant this statement when/if the Cubs are contending in the next years, obviously."
Brewers,2nsq68,_Order66,-7,Sun Nov 30 17:01:35 2014 UTC,It's Packers fans spilling their hatred over from the Bears. And also because fuck logic apparently with these morons.

Brewers,2nhfxe,jn2010,0,Sun Nov 30 23:04:39 2014 UTC,Him being healthy is the difference between rebuilding starting in summer of next year or 2016. I'd prefer 2016.
Brewers,2nhfxe,teethteetheat,-1,Wed Nov 26 21:53:12 2014 UTC,"He should have had that surgery in October 2013.  At that point, he already had months of rest due to suspension and they should have known it wasn't going to get better on its own.  2014 was a wasted season for Braun. That could have made the difference in getting the Brewers to the post season."
Brewers,2nhfxe,mistrbrownstone,3,Wed Nov 26 21:16:48 2014 UTC,Easier said than done. Braun only did this because they found him somewhat of an experimental surgery that wasn't an option before. The surgery we heard about all season long was unlikely to heal him and would only make him miss time to go back to where he was before. He chose to rehab last offseason and try to play through minimal pain and it obviously didn't work. Can't really blame him with the options he had.
Brewers,2nhfxe,sjm1541,-6,Wed Nov 26 21:41:46 2014 UTC,Braun only did this because they found him somewhat of an experimental surgery that wasn't an option before.   They didn't invent this surgery between October 2013 and October 2014.  I don't care what the news articles say. They didn't invent some novel surgery in that short time span. The surgery they did a month ago was available last year as well.
Brewers,2nhfxe,mistrbrownstone,2,Thu Nov 27 06:10:54 2014 UTC,You sound like a pretty dense person. The kind of person that gets an idea into their head and decides it's right.   There's nothing to say that Braun knew about this surgery or his people had any idea it was available and would work. Too bad you weren't involved in the process though.

Brewers,2nhfxe,sjm1541,-1,Thu Nov 27 07:21:25 2014 UTC,Braun had cryotherapy performed on the nerve in his thumb:  http://fantasynews.cbssports.com/fantasybaseball/update/24841851/brewers-ryan-braun-cautiously-optimistic-coming-off-thumb-surgery  The procedure has been around since at least 1999:  http://www.boneandjoint.org.uk/highwire/filestream/17014/field_highwire_article_pdf/0/413.full-text.pdf

Brewers,2nhfxe,sjm1541,-14,Thu Nov 27 07:36:09 2014 UTC,He also said he didn't take PED's.  Even with the thumb 100% he isnt an elite player anymore. Still has the potential to be a one or two time all star before his career ends.  But a healthy Braun doesnt necessarily turn this team into a pennant or division contender.

Brewers,2nalf6,oldprospector21,1 point,Tue Nov 25 06:14:28 2014 UTC,Going into the season with Taylor Jungmann as the number 6 starter would be absolutely terrifying. That guy is not very good.   That being said a team like the Red Sox who is so clearly going for it in the short term is in desperate need of pitching. If you can get a solid piece that could contribute as well as a pitcher that can jump ahead of Jungmann in the rotation order than why not look into it. But you're going to have to get a lot of value here to make it worth your time.
Brewers,2nalf6,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Nov 25 15:03:12 2014 UTC,Thornburg would be 6.   The Sox do have a decent 3B prospect that they appear to no longer need in wil middlebrooks

Brewers,2n3kdq,meltedlaundry,17,Sat Nov 22 18:46:06 2014 UTC,"Minor correction: Nori was traded, not let go. I was, and am, a big fan of Aoki, but I think trading him was the right call. One could make the argument that the return should've been better, but even as it stands I think it was a good trade. Last season, Khris Davis(1.8) and Will Smith(.5) put up a combined 2.3 WAR, while Nori posted only 1.5 WAR. Also, Nori is now a free agent (I think, could be wrong), but we still get several more years out of both Khris and Smith.  But, to answer the topic at hand, but my biggest 'should have been' has to do with CC signing with the Yankees. Because of the free agent compensation rules at the time, the fact that Teixeira, who also signed with NYY, was a higher ranked player pushed the Brewers compensation pick down a slot. And who did the Angels select with the pick they 'stole' from the Brewers? Mike Goddamn Trout. If Teixeira had signed with any other team... Oh well."

Anyway my biggest regret is that we didn't get a scientist to rebuild Mat Gamel and Ben Sheets. Cyborg Mat Gamel batting clean-up and Cyborg Ben Sheets in the first spot in the rotation?

Brewers,2mopd5,workthrowaway68,3,Tue Nov 18 18:51:07 2014 UTC,"There's absolutely nothing that points to a regression in Duke's game. He's only 31, His FIP/xFIP were actually lower than his ERA, His LOB numbers were around league average, he doesn't walk people and his velocity has been consistent his whole career.   He has a deceptive delivery and throws strikes. He's not going to lose it all of a sudden at 32."
Brewers,2mopd5,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Nov 18 19:19:48 2014 UTC,The regression is that he had a 1.3 WAR for a set up Loogy/specialist.  That is going to regress.
Brewers,2mopd5,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Nov 18 22:08:49 2014 UTC,Not really sure how that refuted my point at all. You can't just decide someone will regress because they had a good season.   You should look up Zach Duke's splits before you call him a Loogy also. Just because someone is left handed doesn't mean they can't succeed against righties. He actually faced more righties than lefties last year and had a better K/BB.
Brewers,2mopd5,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Nov 18 22:18:10 2014 UTC,"the production is unsustainable.  He was the 10th best reliever in the NL last year.  He was the best non set up man in the whole league, and he just isn't that good."

Brewers,2mkwjy,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:00:40 2014 UTC,How did Clint Coulter not make the list? Some people have him as the #1 prospect in the organization. The fact that he didn't make the top 10 calls the entire list into question. There is really no way he should be lower than 3rd.
Brewers,2mkwjy,Billgoretrout,2,Tue Nov 18 01:16:11 2014 UTC,Only thing I can think of is a lack of a position. But either way he was 20 last year and put up a .410 OBP and hit 22 HRs in A ball. I can't imagine they think he'll be bad enough in RF to offset that.
Brewers,2mkwjy,Billgoretrout,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:44:45 2014 UTC,"Well he does have a position now, RF. Power is still the toughest tool to find. CC is still young and lead his league in many power categories. They rated guys like Miguel Diaz and Lara (who hasn't played a single professional game) above him.   I am betting he is going to be an excellent defensive OF. All indications are that he is an excellent athlete (State champion wrestler) and shouldn't have issues learning the position."
Brewers,2mkwjy,Billgoretrout,1 point,Tue Nov 18 02:23:54 2014 UTC,"Coulter was also repeating the league, so its a nice year as a bounce back, but shouldnt be used to think he has a plus bat.  He is definitely a top 10 guy in this system, probably deserves to be 6th or so."
Brewers,2mkwjy,Billgoretrout,1 point,Tue Nov 18 15:54:26 2014 UTC,He was still young for the league and only had about 100 AB in Appleton in 2013. He has a solid bat with plus power.

Brewers,2lzaxd,maxels,2,Tue Nov 11 22:42:09 2014 UTC,"Exactly! The moment you have to qualify an argument by removing a portion of data from an analysis, you've invalidated your study. It's the equivalent of saying 'if you take away Milwaukee's 80 losses in 2014, the Brewers were undefeated.'"
Brewers,2lzaxd,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Thu Nov 13 00:23:00 2014 UTC,"I also don't think it's a proper to judge a bench by only pinch hitting. The bench players should be there to provide backup to the starters due to injury, platoon partners, and defensive help on top of pinch hitting.   I'm not going to argue that the Brewers bench can be improved, but a guy can hit .200 as a pinch hitter and still be an extremely value bench piece. The sample sizes are too small to make judgements that carry over from year to year and bench players can provide so much more than the limited pinch hitting appearances the get."

Brewers,2liw8z,losaq,5,Thu Nov 6 23:19:04 2014 UTC,"C-Lucroy X 1B-Lind, RH platoon M 2B- Gennett, RH platoon M SS-Segura L 3B-Ramirez X LF-Davis X CF-Gomez X RF-Braun X  Segura is really the only position player that was worrisome last year. I'd be surprised if he didn't see a bump in offensive production and his defense is above average so he'll most likely stick.  SP1: Kyle Lohse X SP2: Matt Garza X SP3: Yovani Gallardo X SP4: Mike Fiers L SP5: Wily Peralta X  No strict order to the rotation. Jimmy Nelson will make an appearance at some point whether it's due to injury or performance.   Bullpen- L  Broxton, Smith, Jeffress at the back end. Could use another lefty but I wouldn't be surprised to see Duke and/or Gorzelanny back. Kintzler, Thornburg, Henderson are all options to fill out the bullpen along with outside pieces.   Solid core and Melvin should be able to fill in the missing pieces without spending much. Tough to grade the bullpen though when relievers performance fluctuate so much, but I don't think it's much of a concern at this point.   Bench- L  Maldonado is a great backup catcher, Parra can play all three outfield positions and will get plenty of ABs with all OFs hitting right handed, Rogers and Hector Gomez could fill in the middle/corner infield and help with the platoons. Far from set in stone though and could very well come from free agency.   This is just a quick run through so people can add on or correct me anywhere before it's moved over there."
Brewers,2liw8z,sjm1541,2,Fri Nov 7 00:00:32 2014 UTC,"Replace Kintz with Wooten and put Nelson in the pen. Wooten had better ""projection"" stats then Kintz, plus Nelson would make an above average long man. Also, I would almost expect a trade for a middle infield platoon bat."
Brewers,2liw8z,theamazingkiwi,2,Fri Nov 7 00:15:18 2014 UTC,I'm not sure of Nelsons option situation but I feel like it would be valuable to keep him stretched out in AAA. He'll have to start at some point this year.
Brewers,2ljpie,BeHereNow91,4,Fri Nov 7 03:52:52 2014 UTC,"AT&T is a much harder park to hit in than Miller.  Poseys numbers were slightly better before controlling for park factors, and he had a significant edge afterward.  Really no reason for anyone to be upset about this unless you're a total homer."
Brewers,2ljpie,redmosquito,2,Fri Nov 7 06:36:40 2014 UTC,"Even ignoring the counting stats, Posey has Lucroy slightly edged out almost across the board offensively. They're very close, but I agree, it's hard to argue with this one. That Gold Glove Award, though..."
Brewers,2ljpie,hippofountain,2,Fri Nov 7 04:21:49 2014 UTC,That fucking Gold Glove..
Brewers,2ljpie,workthrowaway68,2,Fri Nov 7 04:37:18 2014 UTC,"has nothing to do really with runners in front of him,but it was a very close race and Posey was better by just a shade.  Ahead of Lucroy in obp slg and woba"
Brewers,2ljpie,ZombieLabrador,2,Fri Nov 7 16:56:16 2014 UTC,"Really? Without looking at stats lucroy had the most consistent hitting all season.  I mean,  some people where talking about an mvp caliber season.  To be fair,  pundits where also tapping posey as a strong candidate for mvp. This,  however,  was due to the fact he ad a tremendous second half of the season.  If I recall correctly he was struggling the first half.    For his consistency,  I believe lucroy deserved this award.  Then again,  I had him as a starting catcher for the all star game and molina edged him out.  He only played because of molina injury.  Your guys are pretty much looked over.  That sucks."

Brewers,2ljpie,umphreak2x2,-1,Fri Nov 7 15:33:43 2014 UTC,"I think he also suffered from the fact that he is a Milwaukee Brewer. Most baseball reporters just scratch their heads and say ""What? There's a team in Milwaukee? Are you sure you're not thinking about the Cardinals?"""
Brewers,2ljpie,Necatorducis,3,Fri Nov 7 03:59:11 2014 UTC,Really? People still think this? After a Brewer wins MVP and another wins a gold glove in center field in the last 5 years? After an NLCS appearance?  Your inferiority complex is showing.
Brewers,2ljpie,CJL13,1 point,Fri Nov 7 04:46:54 2014 UTC,"Lucroy received near zero national media attention previous to the all-star game.  Even after the ASG he would often be a faint whispered mention behind Molina, Posey, and McCann.  The awards are partly a popularity contest and given that, relative to other clubs, the Brewers receive little national notice, it isn't outrageous to decry that fact.  Did that detract from Lucroy's chances of winning? Absolutely.  Should he have won it?  Tough call, Posey was equally deserving."
Brewers,2ljpie,umphreak2x2,2,Fri Nov 7 05:01:47 2014 UTC,"First of all, national media includes more than just ESPN. I distinctly recall reading multiple features on both Lucroy and the Brewers on Grantland, Deadspin, FoxSports, and mlb.com all last season. Secondly, it is not about market size or city at all. The other catchers simply have larger bodies of work. Last year was Lucroy's breakout season, and if he maintains this level of performance he'll be in the exact same place those guys are before long."

Brewers,2lhm4o,brewisbrewin,2,Thu Nov 6 17:04:18 2014 UTC,"Aramis Ramirez, who will turn 37 in June, will make $14 million in 2015. Aramis Ramirez, whose isolated power has dropped each of the last three years, will make $14 million in 2015. Aramis Ramirez, who has missed a combined 99 games since 2012, will make $14 million in 2015.   Aramis Ramirez is actually making $10 million next year as $4 million was contractually obligated regardless of the outcome of the negotiations. When you consider the fact Ramirez's performance this year was worth $11.7 million, we actually signed him at a $1.7 million discount."
Brewers,2lhm4o,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:48:55 2014 UTC,Just because $4MM was guaranteed doesn't change the fact that he's being paid $14MM this coming season.
Brewers,2lhm4o,CM816,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:33:16 2014 UTC,"We're paying him $14mil this season, but only $10mil of that is reflective of what we value him at as a member of our team.  We'd be paying him $4mil even if he didn't exercise his option."
Brewers,2lhm4o,BeHereNow91,1 point,Fri Nov 7 04:02:11 2014 UTC,"Usually players who get older don't gain or sustain power. At this point I'm just hoping he gets his OBP up and becomes a nice 5 hole hitter. Occasionally hits a home run and hits a couple more doubles this year than he did last. It sucks paying him $14 MM but were kind of hamstrung. Unlike the Yovani situation (which i disagree with exercising his option) we have no in house replacements and there aren't any real FA options. Maybe we could've traded for one but anyone of quality would require us to mortgage our future by giving up one of our young stud pitchers, more than likely Nelson."

Brewers,2lf08x,roastbeefandcoffee,5,Wed Nov 5 23:09:33 2014 UTC,"I think we should keep Reynolds. He isn't a great hitter, but he plays a very solid defense, and can fill in for Ramirez when need be. Plus I just like him so that probably plays a part"
Brewers,2lf08x,jubjub2184,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:02:31 2014 UTC,He has value in a limited role. I'd love to have him as a late-inning pinch hitter. Everyone knows what he's about.. could prove useful.
Brewers,2lf08x,legit_,4,Fri Nov 7 11:33:48 2014 UTC,So does Matt Clark not exist?
Brewers,2lf08x,machiavellism,3,Thu Nov 6 00:51:05 2014 UTC,"I think Clark is more of a perennial AAA guy/September call up. He's older and I don't think they're gonna spend much effort on developing him for the future (he's 27 and this year was his first time in the majors).  On the other hand, Rogers is already 26. So they must see something in Rogers that they don't see in Clark. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Brewers drafted him and have developed him for the last five years. Maybe they just feel more comfortable with him?   I don't know."
Brewers,2lf08x,smiles134,3,Thu Nov 6 01:33:26 2014 UTC,"Here's a scouting report from April this year:   Rogers best attribute is his power bat. He has an easy, fluid swing, and the power numbers have increased steadily throughout his minor league career. He doesn’t sell out for power however, as he doesn’t strike out excessively, will draw his share of walks, and has hit for a solid average throughout his career as well. He keeps his hands low at the plate and does a good job of using all fields. Despite his soft body, the 26-year-old Rogers is surprising quick and athletic, as witnessed by his 30 career stolen bases. His defensive value is dependent upon the position he plays. At first base, his defense would qualify as at least average. At third base, or in the outfield, he would classify as below average, but serviceable, defensively.   If he lives up to his minor league pedigree and adjusts well to the majors, Rogers will be a nice addition to the lineup and an average glove at 1B."
Brewers,2lf08x,abadg59,3,Thu Nov 6 02:13:00 2014 UTC,Well Matt Clark is also a left-hander so traditionally you wouldn't see him as a platoon partner with another LHB (Lind)
Brewers,2lf08x,sjm1541,2,Thu Nov 6 01:44:51 2014 UTC,"I'm not sold on giving Lucroy more starts over at 1B as Jonny is the best pitch framer in baseball and he gifts our pitchers an extra 200+ strikes a year. As such, there comes a point where too many starts at 1B for Luc starts to influence the effectiveness of our rotation.   However, Jason Rogers getting a majority of the platoon split starts with Lind is encouraging as Melvin and Roenicke clearly believe he can grow and improve with another year in the majors. Maybe Rogers improves enough to become our 1B of the future? Please?"
Brewers,2lf08x,necropaw,3,Wed Nov 5 23:15:13 2014 UTC,"The Brewers don't lose anything defensively by switching in Maldonado for Lucroy. A lot Lucroys value comes from getting his offensive production as a catcher, but when they don't produce at first base it's worth playing him there against certain lefties."
Brewers,2lf08x,sjm1541,2,Thu Nov 6 01:38:14 2014 UTC,"Maldy is a great catcher and better at throwing out runners than Luc probably, but Luc's real secret strength is his extra strike calls.    I'd like to see how Maldy and Luc stack up for saving balls in the dirt, way outside, etc as well."
Brewers,2lf08x,Necatorducis,2,Thu Nov 6 06:52:23 2014 UTC,"Maldonado is just as good as Lucroy at that, if not better.

Brewers,2l62la,OhDoYa,-7,Mon Nov 3 16:55:45 2014 UTC,"An average player (now) for a pretty expensive contract.  All of the people ecstatic about this are a bit misguided.  The only way this is a great thing is if the team were going to contend, and they arent.  It would be a non issue if it werent for the fact he is being paid $16 million dollars.  I'm not saying they need to go an sign a Free Agent to play 3B, but without Ramirez they could have signed a cast off to hold down the position for much less, because with him or a replacement player, they arent contenders.  But with him you are a non contender minus $16 million."
Brewers,2l62la,jubjub2184,8,Mon Nov 3 20:29:48 2014 UTC,"We're paying him 14 million, not 16. And how are the Brewers not contenders. They spent 150 days in first place last year. We have reason to believe that Braun could have a bounce-back year with his cryo-therapy. We have reason to believe that Segura may have hit his low point. They were also going to tweak his swing this offseason. First base, if Lind stays healthy, is certainly better than last year. Henderson had surgery. Thornburg had treatment for his elbow. There is good reason to hope one or both of them might return to form. Tom Gorzelanny was extremely effective in his 'rehab'-limited year. We need a platoon mate for Scooter and for Lind.  Are we the favorites? No. Are we probably going to make the playoffs? No. But there's no reason to write the team off at this point."

Brewers,2l62la,extra_less,-2,Tue Nov 4 14:15:50 2014 UTC,"That 150 days of first place was based entirely on April, the rest of the season was the true talent of this team (a .500 team)  They aren't contenders, nor will they be this year.  Braun may be ok, but he isn't going to be an all star anymore.  Henderson is a 10 year minor league vet, his best is past him.  Thornburg is a reliever, Gorzelanny; reliever...Segura should bounce back nicely, but the problem is always going to be pitching.  The Brewers have at best an average if below average (and expensive starting rotation).  The team will be lucky to finish .500 next year and they may just be like they were last year talent wise, but everyone in the division except maybe the Reds are going to be better, meaning that the unimproved Brewers will be a 4th place team."
Brewers,2l62la,workthrowaway68,2,Tue Nov 4 02:43:24 2014 UTC,"I dont see Segura bouncing back until he learns how to bat. We should consider him to be a traditional defensive infielder, 230-240 hitter that can steal some bases."
Brewers,2l62la,sjm1541,1 point,Tue Nov 4 18:32:50 2014 UTC,"I think he is a guy that will play average SS defensively, have some power and hit around .260 or .270, basically a Rickie Weeks at the SS position with a tad less power."
Brewers,2l62la,workthrowaway68,1 point,Tue Nov 4 19:41:44 2014 UTC,Where else would the money go? It's pretty clear Attanasio is willing to spend and they have no significant needs at this point. Add to the bullpen and look at the bench. I can't imagine this has any affect on next years team. Your suggestion is essentially making the team worse for no reason.
Brewers,2l62la,sjm1541,-1,Mon Nov 3 20:43:32 2014 UTC,"My suggestion is not spending money unwisely.  The team isnt going to contend, so why pay $16 million if it doesnt make you a contender.  It doesnt have to be spent at all.  One thing is clear though, that the team needs massive new expenditures in scouting and player development to make this team worthwhile for the long term."
Brewers,2l62la,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Nov 3 22:14:02 2014 UTC,"That's easy for you to say, but you're not trying to sell tickets. There was no way the Brewers were going to rebuild after last year and you haven't seemed to accept the reality of it all offseason."
Brewers,2l62la,extra_less,-1,Mon Nov 3 23:02:13 2014 UTC,"Oh I know it isn't going to happen because we have an owner that doesn't have the stomach for it and a GM that wont inform him of the need for it.  If you are happy with the way things are working that is your choice, but this team isn't going to ever be a major contender with out a rebuild and heavy influence put into scouting and player development (instead of trying to win with mid level free agents)."
Brewers,2l62la,workthrowaway68,2,Tue Nov 4 02:39:23 2014 UTC,I think there is hope the Crew will start over if they are under 500 by the trade deadline. At that point the whole team can be moved in my opinion if it means we restock our farm system.

Brewers,2l3b1q,brewisbrewin,11,Sun Nov 2 20:17:01 2014 UTC,Name another free agent pitcher who can provide Gallardo's production for a $13 million contract?
Brewers,2l3b1q,Schlitz001,4,Sun Nov 2 22:02:17 2014 UTC,"Exactly.  I had the very same thought as O.P., then a friend ran this question by me.  Answer:  nobody."

Brewers,2l3b1q,wirsteve,-1,Thu Nov 6 18:15:39 2014 UTC,theres a couple i could think of. I mean he is overpaid. Perspective Cueto is getting paid $10 million next year.
Brewers,2l3b1q,EricH7,5,Mon Nov 3 00:21:46 2014 UTC,"Cueto is considerably (or even dramatically) underpaid vs. free agent prices.  You have to consider Gallardo's price against his possible replacement, who would likely come via free agency."
Brewers,2l3b1q,brsmnky007,1 point,Mon Nov 3 00:25:46 2014 UTC,"Cueto is considerably (or even dramatically) underpaid vs. free agent prices.   Johnny Cueto is absolutely underpaid. Per Fangraphs, Cueto's performance this season was worth $22.8 million dollars."
Brewers,2l3b1q,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Mon Nov 3 04:13:28 2014 UTC,"He is over the league average in giving up HRs, and is under the league average for Ks and right around lg avg in BBs. and his FIP is above league average. he is an average major league pitcher, if thats worth $13 million Lord have mercy."
Brewers,2l3b1q,EricH7,1 point,Tue Nov 4 22:37:58 2014 UTC,"Fangraphs ranks him 43rd in baseball in WAR last year, rendering your contention that he's a league-average pitcher dubious at best.  Veteran starting pitching is expensive, and Gallardo would likely command a multiyear deal were he a free agent this year.  $13M is a lot of money, no doubt, but it's not necessarily bad value for a deal with no long term obligation.  It's worth noting that the author of the article points to Ricky Nolasco, a guy who is signed through 2017 with $36M more guaranteed and who just had a 5.37 ERA in the first year of his Twins deal, as evidence that Gallardo is overpaid--a truly laughable assertion.  Contracts aren't just about the yearly average pay--they're also about assumed risk and lack thereof."
Brewers,2l3b1q,brsmnky007,1 point,Tue Nov 4 23:10:43 2014 UTC,"According to WAR he is the 29th best pitcher in the NL and 67th in all of baseball, and the 4th best starter on his own team behind Fires, Peralta, and Lohse. $13 million is a lot for your #4 pitcher. and like you said its not a long term obligation, thank goodness.  ERA is as pointless as pitcher wins. The Twins massively overpaid him as well and they are going to have eat that contract for a long time."
Brewers,2l3b1q,EricH7,1 point,Wed Nov 5 00:21:59 2014 UTC,"I don't get the idea of ranking him as the 4th best on his team and then acting like he's a #4-quality starter, especially since he (1.7 WAR according to FanGraphs) beats out Peralta (1.5 WAR).  Either way, even as the the 29th/67th best in NL/MLB respectively, he pitched at a 3ish starter level.  $13M for a one year deal for a decent mid-rotation veteran starting pitcher is not a bad deal.  It might be true that it's high on a per-year basis, but it comes with the benefit of lower risk and greater flexibility down the road.  As for ERA being as pointless as wins, I find that a pretty absurd contention.  ERA is by no means a perfect stat, but I think it's far more accurate than Ws at estimating pitcher performance, not least because ERA stats can only be affected while a pitcher is actually on the mound and not after he leaves the game."
Brewers,2l3b1q,brsmnky007,1 point,Wed Nov 5 00:48:51 2014 UTC,"According to baseball reference he ranks behind those 3. There's nothing I can do to change what the Brewers did they exercised his clause and he will be pitching for us next year.   ERA is pointless because it is all luck. Broken bat singles, shoddy defense, etc. Let's say there is 2 outs and the SS gets a routine grounder and fires an easy 3rd out into the 2nd row and then the inning goes on and the pitcher gives up 4 runs after that. Is it the pitchers fault the SS couldn't get the easy 3rd out? No. Hence my point of ERA being pointless, it takes into account too many external factors such as luck and shoddy defense. Ks, BBs, HRs are the only thing the pitcher actual has control over. FIP attempts to take out the defense and luck and I think it does a good job but that's my opinion."
Brewers,2l3b1q,EricH7,2,Wed Nov 5 02:10:00 2014 UTC,"Let's say there is 2 outs and the SS gets a routine grounder and fires an easy 3rd out into the 2nd row and then the inning goes on and the pitcher gives up 4 runs after that. Is it the pitchers fault the SS couldn't get the easy 3rd out?    Of course it's not the pitcher's fault, and that's exactly why all those runs would be unearned runs and wouldn't affect the pitcher's ERA, bolstering rather than weakening the argument that the ERA is a relevant statistic.   it takes into account too many external factors such as luck and shoddy defense. Ks, BBs, HRs are the only thing the pitcher actual has control over. FIP attempts to take out the defense and luck and I think it does a good job but that's my opinion.   As I said at the outset, ERA is by no means a perfect stat, but I don't believe the solution is to completely ignore all aspects of pitching other than ""true outcome"" pitching categories.  ERA is a worthwhile stat as long as one keeps in mind its shortcomings and views it within the context of other relevant statistics.  Furthermore, going back to my original point, I believe it does a far better job than wins and losses at representing how a pitcher pitched on any given day and is far from ""pointless.""  It's also worth pointing out that Ks, BBs and HRs don't completely rule out luck.  Happen to have a generous or stingy ump that day?  It's going to affect Ks and BBs.  Happen to have GoGo in center rather than another CF?  A pitcher might have a few less HRs on their card than they might have had otherwise over the course of the season.  All this isn't to say that I don't think FIP is a worthwhile, and possibly even superior, stat compared to ERA.  I simply believe ERA (and especially it's park-adjusted counterpart ERA+) is far from pointless and far superior to Ws and Ls."
Brewers,2l3b1q,brsmnky007,1 point,Wed Nov 5 02:31:37 2014 UTC,"Ok that situation was a bad example but I'm sure you can imagine a situation in which the defense lets the pitcher down and it isn't counted as an error but instead tacked onto the pitcher.   ERA is not a good stat for projecting the future value of a pitcher, from year to year Ks, BBs, HRs are the only thing that stay consistent all the way up through the farm to the show and then to the end of a career."
Brewers,2l3b1q,EricH7,-8,Wed Nov 5 02:51:44 2014 UTC,"Its not hard to do at all, because Gallardo doesn't really produce all that much.  He was a below average pitcher last year and projects to be an average one at best for 2015.  The contract isn't awful given market values given to Free Agents, but you could do better for the same amount.  Bartolo Colon, Jorge de la Rosa, RA Dickey, Aaron Harang, Wei-Yin Chen, Jason Vargas, Brandon McCarthy, Scott Kazmir, not to mention Matt Garza and Kyle Lohse, all had better years than Gallardo last year.    You can do better for the same amount or less."
Brewers,2l3b1q,workthrowaway68,1 point,Mon Nov 3 02:53:32 2014 UTC,"But again, who out there is going to sign one year contract for $13 million with Gallardo's credentials?  If Gallardo were hitting free agency, guaranteed he's get a minimum 3 year contract.  He's 28 years old, has put up 180+ innings every year since 2009, and he's average about 2 WAR per year with ERA of 3.69.  He's an above average pitcher and those are hard to come by."
Brewers,2l3b1q,Schlitz001,-4,Mon Nov 3 04:00:23 2014 UTC,Well he's not an above average pitcher.  He hasn't been since 2011.  Right now he is a below average pitcher.  The question was could you do better in the FA market at that price and you can.  Probably not on a one year deal its true.
Brewers,2l3b1q,workthrowaway68,4,Mon Nov 3 04:58:56 2014 UTC,"He had the 27th best WAR last year in the NL, and since 2009 he has the 11th best WAR in the NL.  That qualifies as ""above average"" in my book."
Brewers,2l3b1q,Schlitz001,-5,Mon Nov 3 05:32:00 2014 UTC,"3 WAR would be considered above average, and he has been on a steady slide since '11"
Brewers,2l3b1q,workthrowaway68,3,Mon Nov 3 05:49:31 2014 UTC,"Only 16 pitchers had a WAR above 3 in the NL last year.  That's a pretty high standard for average, and it isn't really a qualifier for the definition of average.  That's all I'm going to argue about Gallardo since I'm arguing about definitions now."
Brewers,2l3b1q,Schlitz001,6,Mon Nov 3 06:19:46 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I like the method used to decide whether or not Gallardo is ""worth"" the contract.  Going through each player...  Nolasco is the most comparable, makes sense.  Haren was very good in 2011 but struggled in 2012-2013 leading to him on getting 2/20 with the second year player option.   Hughes accumulated 6.1 WAR last year, more than half of his total. He was paid for what he did the three years prior which is why his contract was only 3/24.  Quintana's situation isn't comparable. He's much younger and signed a contract before he was proven. He's very early on in the contract but it's a different situation. Great deal for the White Sox.  Dickey signed his extension in his late 30s and their were decline concerns which have come true. Much of his WAR came from his Cy Young season.   Gallardo is the pinnacle of consistency. Haren had health issues, Dickey was old, Quintana unproven, Hughes hadn't broken out but we know what Gallardo brings. He's worth the price for sure because he brings stability and consistency to the rotation. He'll give you 200 quality innings every year."

Brewers,2kztnt,R0CKETP0WER,15,Sat Nov 1 18:16:48 2014 UTC,I like this trade a lot. Looks like we finally have a decent 1B with a good amount of pop.
Brewers,2kztnt,Babou_Ocelot,10,Sat Nov 1 18:21:21 2014 UTC,I like it too. Getting Estrada out of town opens up a spot in the rotation for one of the younger arms that isn't going to give up way too many home runs every year.   I'll be curious if they're looking at Lind as an every day 1B or a platoon situation like last season.
Brewers,2kztnt,Babou_Ocelot,3,Sat Nov 1 18:22:58 2014 UTC,"I can't remember if Lind played 1B everyday at TOR with the DH option. I bet he'd play whenever healthy though, as Im not certain who else they'd have him split time with"
Brewers,2kztnt,slamnasty99,5,Sat Nov 1 18:29:37 2014 UTC,According to CBS he hit .321 in 96 games
Brewers,2kztnt,ol_dantucker,1 point,Sat Nov 1 19:42:08 2014 UTC,That was pretty much exclusively against right handed pitching. If you're left handed you could probably strike lind out.
Brewers,2kztnt,theamazingkiwi,3,Mon Nov 3 02:21:09 2014 UTC,He will (at least should) be only used against RHP. He is very underwhelming against LHP.
Brewers,2kztnt,belardi,5,Sat Nov 1 21:54:38 2014 UTC,"Jays fan here. After watching him against righties, everyone will say wow, he's so good Vs righties, why don't we try him Vs lefties. He absolutely can't hit lefties, and he's had his chance. He has over 1000 PA against them and his splits are extreme. He's strictly a platoon/pinch hitter that plays average 1B."
Brewers,2kztnt,DEUCE_SLUICE,6,Sat Nov 1 23:25:53 2014 UTC,"Fortunately, the NL Central is almost entirely RHP starters, and you just put Maldonado behind the dish and Lucroy at first when Lind has to sit vs a tough lefty."
Brewers,2kztnt,workthrowaway68,2,Sun Nov 2 01:49:22 2014 UTC,"the major flaw in that thought is that Mark Reynolds played in 130 games last year.  Even if you cut that down to 100, you aren't going to make up the difference with spot starts at 1B with Lucroy and Braun.  And Lucroys bat is below average at 1B.  This isn't a horrible trade, but its not a good trade either.  Its one of these ""were going to try and make an improvement at a bad position and hope it all works out better"" type trades, when the major theme for the Brewers should be to rebuild."
Brewers,2kztnt,jubjub2184,2,Sun Nov 2 14:52:54 2014 UTC,He can't hit lefties apparently. So I'm guessing he'll split.

Brewers,2kztnt,BeHereNow91,2,Sun Nov 2 00:02:12 2014 UTC,"It was a good trade all around.  Jays just got Smoak, so they could afford to trade down a bit to get Lind off the roster.  Good on the Brewers to capitalize on that."

Brewers,2kztnt,BeHereNow91,5,Sat Nov 1 18:35:22 2014 UTC,"And the LH ""half"" will end up covering at least 100 games.  Lind will essentially be an everyday player."
Brewers,2kztnt,MustBeNice,1 point,Sat Nov 1 23:14:45 2014 UTC,"Pitcher WAR is not really reliable.

Not a good trade IMO."
Brewers,2kztnt,BurtMaklin,5,Mon Nov 3 01:51:22 2014 UTC,"Jays fan checking in. Enjoy Lindy. He's a good ball player. I don't think he ever really reached his potential in Toronto. When he gets hot, he has one of the best pure swings around. He can hit the ball to all fields. He might miss the DH a little bit. A bit of a sub par defender. But I think you'll like him nonetheless."
Brewers,2kztnt,Kobe_AYEEEEE,6,Sun Nov 2 02:33:25 2014 UTC,"Really good move in my opinion. Props to Doug, he has done a lot right already this offseason IMO. We got our 1B and don't need to worry about Marco giving up a ton of dingers again this year, although I kinda liked him for some reason."
Brewers,2kztnt,consolecarrypermit,3,Sat Nov 1 18:38:53 2014 UTC,"Marco did a lot better out of the pen. He's not a bad pitcher, he just doesn't have the ability to pitch deep into games."

Brewers,2kztnt,AisoRed,2,Sat Nov 1 18:24:26 2014 UTC,I really like this deal! I can see us using Jonathon Lucroy and/or Martin Maldonado at first base against left-handers since Lind does not hit lefties.

Even if you find a decent right handed half of the platoon, you still have an average at best first baseman.

Brewers,2kztnt,workthrowaway68,6,Sat Nov 1 19:22:14 2014 UTC,"I'm at work and can't get the definite number, but he's a career .270+ hitter and hit .321 (iirc) in the AL last season. That's a lot better than Overbay.   Edit: .273/.327/.466 career slashline."

We played over our heads to win as much as we did in 2014. Even if we fill the holes in the roster with roughly the same level of talent from the outside (because fuck having up-and-coming corner infielders in the farm I guess), we're just going to be stuck muddling about in mediocrity.

The starting rotation will presumably have Gallardo, Lohse, Garza, Peralta and Fiers/Nelson. Whoever doesn't make that last spot could probably go in the long relief position. Kintzler is cheaper and possibly more efficient for the team, given he is expected to warm up and go in quicker than Marco.  Scrap them both for Cyborg Ben Sheets though, tbh."

I've only ever seen Kintzler pitch well for a couple weeks at a time before he gets hurt/the wheels come off.   Ron's tendency to over use Brandon when he's shitting the bed doesn't help either, but I'll take the better-known quantity who can fill multiple needs."

Brewers,2kmmq7,roastbeefandcoffee,1 point,Wed Oct 29 16:52:06 2014 UTC,"I think this is interesting because we could probably pay Panda, and we could probably get him for a longer term contract. Rami would likely be 2-3 years max, but would be cheaper (although I don't think by much, unless Boston or some other big market team bids out of their mind to get Pablo).   For me, I'd rather have the longer term guy, even if it costs a little more initially. My hesitation would be that if we spend the money, we don't have it next year to lock up GoGo (among others)."
Brewers,2kmmq7,Necatorducis,3,Wed Oct 29 03:10:11 2014 UTC,"Pablo, I think, wanted something like 20M a year.  Not that he's going to get that, but it is what he wants.  Brewers aren't going to pay that.  I couldn't see them offering more than 12-14 a year/avg.   If the roster stays close to what it is now, I think GoGo gets traded for prospects in mid '16 any way.  They'll save the cash for Lucroy, assuming he stays within 80-90% of his performance this year."
Brewers,2kmmq7,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:26:57 2014 UTC,"No way the brewers pay that. We've all seen the brewcrewball analysis, which I thought was pretty fair. Even with re-signing the questionables and not doing anything extreme, we're pushing our highest opening day salary to date again. Adding 12k to that isn't going to be in Mark A's wallet..."

Brewers,2kmmq7,smiles134,1 point,Thu Oct 30 14:58:33 2014 UTC,"I'm not really sure why you're asking this.  Sandoval is invariably the better option at third for most teams, but he's going to cost an exorbitant amount of money. Aramis is the more logical choice between the two for the Brewers.  In an ideal world, no team would pick Ramirez now over Sandoval now."
Brewers,2kmmq7,smiles134,1 point,Fri Oct 31 19:29:54 2014 UTC,"My thought was, do you pay the money and get a third basemen that will be good? Or do you wait for someone in the farm system to be ready and bridge the gap with Ramirez?"
Brewers,2klkhj,brewisbrewin,3,Tue Oct 28 19:31:23 2014 UTC,"This just seems like parroting of surface level saber ideologies without any regard to the actually important information, that is being wholly ignored.  Stating 'to bunt with a runner on first with 0 outs will expectedly produce .X runs' entirely ignores the reality of the situation.  No actor or mixture of actors involved in any particular, that is, real, play are the actual representation of an expected run number.  The expected run numbers are summed on accounting for if X outs and Y base runner then Z expectation.  They are not reflective of 'if specific player X performs Y against pitcher A and fielders B, C, D, the proximate result should be Z.'  To get that number you need, and I think the professional term is, a fuck-ton of data.  Data that most of we mere mortals do not have access to due to it's cost and data that is very often ignored and not factored by those who do (looking at you BBWAA who still think pitcher wins are a valid counting stat!).  While avg. is not a greatly important stat on its own, it is significant for context in advancing a runner.  Team avg is around 250, team obp 310, team bunting 320.  So just using simple numbers, like your post, the most effective way not to get out would be to bunt.  And if you can see the flaw in using these numbers here then the flaw should be apparent in the way you used the numbers in your post.  I hope to god the Royals win game 7 on a bunt."
Brewers,2klkhj,Necatorducis,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:03:47 2014 UTC,i see your point but the fact with bunting is that it also only nets you one base even if you don't get thrown out at first. While if your swinging the bat you have a chance to get 2 or more bases thus driving in the the runner. Saber metrics says OBP is the most important stat but it also says that slugging is almost as valuable.
Brewers,2klkhj,EricH7,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:57:28 2014 UTC,"Well now I know why the hitting coach was fired, can't have a team bunt that often that badly."
Brewers,2klkhj,CJL13,1 point,Wed Oct 29 04:06:41 2014 UTC,"I'm going to disagree. I don't like just straight up sabermetrics, because it's just based on total averages, not individual strengths. We need to realize that there are several other factors out there.  First of all, based on those numbers, we're batting .321 when we bunt. The author says we ""gave away"" 258 runs, but that's a shit way to look at it. If we aren't bunting, we're also ""conceding"" 122 base hits. If they are swinging, I think those numbers come out in the wash.  And the unstated part is that it keeps the defense on their toes. The threat of the bunt keeps catchers active, pitchers coming out of their follow-through, and infield in. That all throws off the standard formations and allows for more gap-hits I'm sure. If we never bunt and just swing every time, the defense settles in and are better equipped to field them.  Same with steals. He says we're killing our chances because you have a lesser chance to score from 2nd with 1 out. But what that doesn't account for is the pitcher's attention to that baserunner. If we never run, the pitcher can focus on the batter at hand and make better pitches. We don't link that steals number back to strikeouts or anything, so it's not painting the whole picture.  I don't know. I love this style of baseball. It's fast paced, exciting, and unpredictable. I love the suicide squeeze and the inevitable steals. Makes it all fun to watch, especially when you have guys like Gogo."
Brewers,2klkhj,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Wed Oct 29 15:26:16 2014 UTC,you give up runs because you only get 1 base even if you do manage to get on safely. If your swinging sure your team's OBP may be 10 points lower than your teams bunt average but if your swinging you also have an infinitely better chance of getting 2 or more bases as compared to if you bunt. And if the batter gets 2 bases with a man or more on its likely that runner will get home even if he starts at 1st. Slugging % can't be overlooked.

Brewers,2khrf2,workthrowaway68,3,Tue Oct 28 12:58:26 2014 UTC,"No.  But there's more to this than any one stat.  At least in my opinion.  ""Who was the better draft pick"" depends on when the player was drafted.  Yount was the 3rd overall pick in 1973.  He was  3x All-Star, 2x MVP, 3x Silver Slugger, and 1x Gold Glove winner.  Piazza was a 62nd round pick, and a 12x All-Star, and 10x Silver Slugger, and the Rookie of the Year in 1993.  Yount played 20 seasons, and had a career average of .285 in 12,249 plate appearences (11,008 AB's).  Piazza hit .308 over 16 seasons, 7,745 plate appearances (6,911 AB's).  So I'm saying they were both good, but Piazza was amazing considering what they expected from a 62nd round pick. He also played for a bigger market, so more people will know of him than Yount, especially among younger fans."

Brewers,2jqks2,workthrowaway68,2,Mon Oct 20 15:30:39 2014 UTC,88 wins would be a pipe dream for the 2015 Brewers.  They are going to be fortunate if they win 78 games next year.

Brewers,2jqks2,workthrowaway68,2,Fri Oct 24 14:07:19 2014 UTC,I think 78 wins comes even with Adam LaRoche as the 1B and with full healthy seasons from Ramirez and Braun.  Neither of those guys are all stars anymore and they just arent going to produce the way they used to.  And I dont think Gennett will ever hit lefties.
Brewers,2jqks2,EricH7,0,Fri Oct 24 17:25:41 2014 UTC,"If braun's thumb is healthy he is an all-star, you could see he still is the player we know him as when he'd have a day or 2 off. came out the first month on fire, thumb flared up and he went in the tank. almost every game he had 2 days off previous he would have a great game.   Rami- maybe he'll decline but he was just an all-star last year so you can't say for sure one way or the other.   Scooter is a toss up, i'm not asking him to hit 300 vs LHP but if he could hit 220 against lefties and do what he did this year against righties we'll be fine.  LaRoche i'm not sure is the answer at 1B, or who we might even get. with our depth in pitching maybe we make a trade, maybe for Morneau or someone else."

Brewers,2jdsok,necropaw,3,Thu Oct 16 04:51:42 2014 UTC,"It's hard to argue that he's not a better manager now than he was 6 years ago.  Maybe the Royals are a better team and a better fit, but he's taken really an average team and made them play their best baseball.  There's really no way, on paper, that the Royals should have swept the A's and O's.  Some of that credit has to go to Yost."
Brewers,2jdsok,BeHereNow91,7,Thu Oct 16 03:24:35 2014 UTC,It is easy to sweep the A's when it is one game.
Brewers,2jdsok,sconnie_drunk,3,Thu Oct 16 06:57:06 2014 UTC,I meant the Angels.
Brewers,2jdsok,BeHereNow91,5,Thu Oct 16 15:53:05 2014 UTC,"No he didn't become a better manager, but the Royals are a better team than the '08 Brewers, and are more built for postseason play when the pitching is consistently great.  They play absolutely stellar defense, and they can manufacture runs like an old-school NL team.  They are loaded with speed, and the teams they've played just can't handle it.  I mean, even today they had their #3 hitter (Lorenzo) sacrifice bunt runners to 2nd and 3rd in the 1st inning to force the issue, and you can do that sort of thing with the roster they have.    The '08 Brewers were a bit one-dimensional as a home-run hitting team (as is tradition with DM as GM), and generally speaking those are the teams that can't grind through a postseason run.  And the Royals won the 1-game Wildcard versus OAK despite Ned Yost.  His use of Yordano Ventura (a rookie) in relief in the 6th (when he never had pitched in relief all season) would have been criticized for eons in Kansas City had they not pulled that game out of thin air with 7 stolen bases."
Brewers,2jdsok,OrfeoKimble,6,Thu Oct 16 08:00:24 2014 UTC,"The best thing the Royals did was Ned proof the bullpen. the 7-8-9 innings are accounted for and they have good guys to go to in the 6th if necessary. When he had to make a tough decision in the A's game he kicked it real real bad, but his boys bailed him out.   I'm not a Ned hater or a Ned apologist. He is good with younger players and gets them to play hard and teaches them how to be big leaguers while not worrying if they are 10 or 15 games under .500. He went through some lean years in Milwaukee and KC and this is a nice pay off for him."
Brewers,2jdsok,oldprospector21,8,Thu Oct 16 18:29:12 2014 UTC,"Honestly a manager might affect a team 1.5-2 games max during the course of a year, either positively or negatively.  People will argue this tooth and nail, but the statistics support that managers don't really have as much of an effect as people would like to believe. Yost is pretty average down the middle, it's just a really all around solid team without any real superstars."
Brewers,2jdsok,MustBeNice,3,Thu Oct 16 05:40:55 2014 UTC,"There's a little bit of jealousy in me, but there's also pride. So many brewers on that team."
Brewers,2jdsok,smiles134,4,Thu Oct 16 04:51:09 2014 UTC,Neither?
Brewers,2jdsok,MrTomAce,-5,Thu Oct 16 02:57:17 2014 UTC,"Considering we didn't make it to the World Series, it would be impossible for neither thing to be true. Personally I believe it's a little bit of both, and I do believe he's a hell of a lot better manager than Roeneke."
Brewers,2jdsok,Shazmanoid,8,Thu Oct 16 03:35:43 2014 UTC,Just because the Royals advanced to the World Series doesn't necessarily make them a better team than the '08 Brewers. The Brewers team actually won more games in the regular season and ran into a great Phillies team. The playoffs is more about getting hot at the right time than anything else.
Brewers,2jdsok,sjm1541,-5,Thu Oct 16 05:22:16 2014 UTC,Getting hot in the playoffs probably has a lot to do with a good manager. Hence Yost has probably improved as a manager.
Brewers,2jdsok,Shazmanoid,6,Thu Oct 16 05:28:47 2014 UTC,"No, it really doesn't. It's about timely hitting, good pitching and having a bullpen that doesn't give up runs.   If you truly think Yost is a better manager than Roenicke then you probably haven't watched much baseball since 2008. Yost wasn't a good manager in '08 and he still isn't now. People seem to forget that Roenicke led a 96 win team to the NLCS in '11 and nearly brought the team to a wild card in '12 after they traded away Greinke. He didn'y just forget how to manage in September of this year which people seem to think is the case."
Brewers,2jdsok,sjm1541,-5,Thu Oct 16 05:39:44 2014 UTC,"No, he never knew how. His players have no discipline and he's one of the worst managers I've ever seen about knowing when to take a pitcher out. I don't understand how Brewers fans can stand by him after this collapse. The manager needs to take charge of the team and keep the ship steady. He does not."
Brewers,2jdsok,Shazmanoid,0,Thu Oct 16 06:08:31 2014 UTC,Flawed logic
Brewers,2jdsok,MustBeNice,3,Thu Oct 16 05:42:13 2014 UTC,"I feel like if we didn't trade Will Smith for Aoki, this would be us.  But what the fuck do I know, I'm just jealous."
Brewers,2jdsok,chajimak,1 point,Thu Oct 16 04:53:23 2014 UTC,"I keep thinking about this a little differently. We swapped Aoki for Kris Davis. This seems like an even worse move knowing how the season turned out, although there was not much complaining at the time."
Brewers,2jdsok,spectchem,-1,Thu Oct 16 14:03:29 2014 UTC,"People will downvote you if you dare criticize the almighty Doug Melvin, but I agree it was a terrible trade. He could've gotten such a better return other than a single mediocre bullpen arm."
Brewers,2jdsok,MustBeNice,6,Thu Oct 16 05:43:27 2014 UTC,Will Smith is pre-arbitration and under club control for five more seasons. Let's evaluate this trade once the Brewers have a few more years of Smith.
Brewers,2jdsok,unmisunderestimated,2,Thu Oct 16 14:21:38 2014 UTC,"The Royals are my team this post season, but Ned Yost sure as hell didn't become a better manager."
Brewers,2jdsok,hippofountain,1 point,Thu Oct 16 03:20:42 2014 UTC,"KC is probably just a better fit for him than the Brewers were. Granted the team means a lot more than the manager, and Ned tried really really hard to fuck it up in the wildcard, but I feel like they suit his strategies pretty well."
Brewers,2jf1em,EricH7,3,Thu Oct 16 13:57:19 2014 UTC,"Declined ability, subpar performance, & multiple instances of domestic abuse.  I can't wait to see this guy gone."
Brewers,2jf1em,CM816,5,Fri Oct 17 03:05:55 2014 UTC,"Let him and his -0.6 WAR go somewhere far away from Milwaukee, he is not worth bringing back."
Brewers,2jf1em,theamazingkiwi,1 point,Thu Oct 16 17:05:26 2014 UTC,War?
Brewers,2jf1em,Sexy_Squidward,2,Thu Oct 16 20:31:07 2014 UTC,wins above replacement. negative means you're worse than the guy that would replace you.
Brewers,2jf1em,Rory_the_dog,1 point,Fri Oct 17 01:08:59 2014 UTC,Interesting part is they say he has a real affinity with the city of Milwaukee and the club itself. If you could get him for around $5-7 million would you take that deal? Personally I would.
Brewers,2jf1em,smiles134,2,Thu Oct 16 13:58:45 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't. I want to put Broxton in the closing spot, and put Jeffress in the set-up role. I want to start grooming for the future."
Brewers,2jf1em,sjm1541,3,Thu Oct 16 19:22:57 2014 UTC,"Duke, Smith, Broxton, Jeffress, Kintzler, Thornburg, Henderson, etc. I think the Brewers definitely have the options to build a solid bullpen without spending the money on K-Rod. When you're paying Broxton 9 million it doesn't leave you much spending room in the bullpen either."
Brewers,2jf1em,smiles134,1 point,Thu Oct 16 19:59:07 2014 UTC,Exactly.
Brewers,2jf1em,SolidRambo,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:03:35 2014 UTC,"Well if K-Rod only costs $5 million i wouldn't mind signing him, can never have enough arms in the pen. But i assume resigning him will be one of the last things we do. We have obvious more pressing issues."
Brewers,2jf1em,NickJackInTheBox,1 point,Thu Oct 16 23:59:02 2014 UTC,Were it not for Broxton's expensive contract it would be worth bringing him back for sure. But with limited money and the black hole that is first base I'd much rather the funds go towards bringing in LaRoche.
Brewers,2j69fv,meltedlaundry,5,Tue Oct 14 01:22:12 2014 UTC,"Oh, thank fuck. I was worried because the procedure was rare and could have ruined his career in terms of being able to swing a baseball bat."
Brewers,2j69fv,roastbeefandcoffee,3,Tue Oct 14 01:56:33 2014 UTC,Man that's great to hear. Let's hope things keep looking up.
Brewers,2j69fv,gobrewcrew,3,Tue Oct 14 06:02:50 2014 UTC,If this works well and makes him a MVP candidate again can we call this the Ryan Braun Surgery?
Brewers,2j69fv,CJL13,5,Wed Oct 15 00:18:21 2014 UTC,"Like he would come out and say it felt horrible, even if that were the case.  I'll believe it next April when I see it. I'm all out of Brewer optimism for 2014."

Brewers,2j69fv,workthrowaway68,2,Tue Oct 14 18:11:52 2014 UTC,Good to hear at this point.  It'd be really nice for him to get back to his old form...
Brewers,2j69fv,FUNKYDISCO,-8,Tue Oct 14 05:00:04 2014 UTC,"That's probably not going to happen, even if he is 100% healthy.  He is two years older and not taking PED's anymore.  He has always had injury issues, so you can assume at least one DL stint from him.  He will be out of his prime years now and his power will most likely start to decline (again even if 100%).  I think he might be capable of one more all star type year during his career still, but he is at the beginning stages of his slow descent towards retirement and uselessness."

Brewers,2j69fv,necropaw,-11,Tue Oct 14 19:14:27 2014 UTC,I'm glad his thumb feels pretty good in the offseason. Wouldn't have wanted to have the surgery early in the season when it could have done some good.
Brewers,2j69fv,EricH7,7,Tue Oct 14 02:11:31 2014 UTC,"Its experimental surgery, and if i remember right they were hoping that the nerve problems would subside a bit on their own.  Youre talking about a guy risking his livelihood...that should always be a last resort.  I dont give a damn if he makes millions or not."

Brewers,2ixero,TheBause,2,Fri Oct 17 08:14:49 2014 UTC,Interesting that mlb.com decided to only use Jake Peavy's numbers on the Giants as opposed to his entire 2014 season. Probably because the 1-9 record in Boston would make him look terrible.
Brewers,2ivtvw,CasualCore,11,Fri Oct 10 19:37:01 2014 UTC,"Mark was talking about how certain players didn't care if they won or not, with Ron staying does this mean we're going to be seeing several players leaving?"
Brewers,2ivtvw,CJL13,8,Fri Oct 10 20:02:10 2014 UTC,"My guess is yes. The only bad apples I can think of are Reynolds, Weeks, are gone regardless, which might wash away the bad mojo away. I would not be surprised if the Brewers moved one of their outfielders; Parra, Davis, or Schafer for a starting 1b."
Brewers,2ivtvw,extra_less,4,Fri Oct 10 20:39:38 2014 UTC,"There had been a bit of talk about Rami moving to first as well.  Wasnt one of the kids we brought up in Sept. a 3rd baseman?  That being said, it'd be alright with me if Parra or Davis moved to first.  Davis has a decent enough bat (and i think it'll get better) and Parra is a gold glove CF, so having him in LF would be really, really good for our defense...plus he can hit alright still."
Brewers,2ivtvw,necropaw,1 point,Fri Oct 10 20:42:45 2014 UTC,Parra has an average bar but is a gold glove winning outfielder. It'd be a waste to put him at first. Davis was tried out at first during the Arizona Fall League a few years ago and the results were pretty terrible.
Brewers,2ivtvw,crewblue,2,Tue Oct 14 17:17:58 2014 UTC,Are you saying Weeks and Reynolds had poor attitudes? Cuz l remember BA and Rock talking about how Weeks always had a good attitude regardless of his performance.
Brewers,2ivtvw,mydogsnamedcoal,3,Fri Oct 10 21:55:42 2014 UTC,"I'm just guessing Ricky not want to play in the outfield may have labeled him as not being a team player, I would imagine that attitude would cause teammates to think he wasn't a team player...but who knows?"
Brewers,2ivtvw,extra_less,3,Fri Oct 10 22:53:48 2014 UTC,"he refused to play another position (part time) to help out the team. at the end of the season when the brewers were out of the playoffs he wanted to ""rest"" and asked to sit out. more than once i remember him complaining about his spot in the order when he was batting near the bottom. and thats all just from this season"
Brewers,2ivtvw,clownparade,2,Tue Oct 14 13:21:27 2014 UTC,Rickie has always presented a poor attitude and it's reflected in his play. The Brewers media can spin him all they want but he was barely serviceable as a $11 million platoon player.
Brewers,2ivtvw,tbe170,1 point,Sat Oct 11 23:00:30 2014 UTC,"ive been calling for davis to move to 1b, his outfield defense is brutal, his glove/range are ""ok"" but hes got a noodle arm. id love to see his power at 1b and defense hidden there, and a para/gomez/braun outfield would be possibly the best defensive outfield in baseball, and para gives us a real leadoff hitter if hes palying every day"
Brewers,2ivtvw,clownparade,1 point,Tue Oct 14 13:20:00 2014 UTC,I remember hearing the Brewers tried him at first and it was a complete disaster so I don't think this is an option for him.
Brewers,2ivtvw,extra_less,6,Tue Oct 14 15:03:19 2014 UTC,"Whoever the new hitting coach is will, hopefully, realize he is in the national league and insist that everyone on the roster learns how to bunt.  Nothing more frustrating than seeing the same guys fail to drop a bunt over and over."
Brewers,2ivtvw,Necatorducis,3,Fri Oct 10 22:39:26 2014 UTC,"Garth Iorg was also the infield coach, correct?"
Brewers,2ivtvw,northsidestrangler,2,Fri Oct 10 19:45:00 2014 UTC,correct.
Brewers,2ivtvw,EricH7,5,Fri Oct 10 20:36:23 2014 UTC,Looks like this username will be around for a while.
Brewers,2ivtvw,sjm1541,2,Fri Oct 10 22:26:54 2014 UTC,"He's a good manager, but we need one that can give guys like Gomez discipline. We also need one that can take advantage of all the big bats."
Brewers,2ivtvw,gobrewcrew,0,Sat Oct 11 02:10:02 2014 UTC,Take advantage of all the big bats? What does that mean? Outside of the last month and a half this year Roenicke's teams have played extremely well. In 2012 they worked themselves into a playoff race that they probably didnt belong in.
Brewers,2ivtvw,R99,1 point,Sun Oct 12 00:01:16 2014 UTC,"Some guys just seems a little slumpy. Going in and out of slumps, ya' know?"
Brewers,2ivtvw,necropaw,3,Sun Oct 12 00:22:28 2014 UTC,"Well, we did have terrible problems with the consistency of our hitting and our infield defense wasn't anything to write home about. Guess we'll have to see whether these changes do any good next year or if it's just scapegoating."
Brewers,2ivtvw,consolecarrypermit,3,Sat Oct 11 00:01:48 2014 UTC,"Aww, Garth Iorg threw me a baseball at a game 2 years ago."
Brewers,2ivtvw,sjm1541,2,Sat Oct 11 03:32:33 2014 UTC,"Huh.  I wasnt expecting that.  Hitting coach changing is interesting though.  Theres a couple guys performing better than expected, and a couple worse than expected (though with some excuses, IE Braun/Siggy)  It'll be interesting to see if anything changes next year."
Brewers,2ivtvw,smiles134,5,Fri Oct 10 20:27:41 2014 UTC,I wonder if this means the team wants a new approach at the plate or if its just your typical scapegoat firing.
Brewers,2ivtvw,TweetPoster,2,Fri Oct 10 22:59:13 2014 UTC,"The Brewers don't just teach guys to be free swingers, it's just the kind of players they sign and they probably don't feel comfortable changing it. If they really want a new approach at the plate they should reconstruct the roster this offseason."
Brewers,2ivtvw,spectchem,2,Sat Oct 11 00:12:34 2014 UTC,Little surprised by the firings. Hopefully we try to change the hitting philosophy for next year

Brewers,2iuy9m,CJL13,2,Fri Oct 10 23:07:15 2014 UTC,76-86
Brewers,2iuy9m,Mega_Sloth_,3,Mon Oct 13 22:14:29 2014 UTC,Less than .500 for sure
Brewers,2iuy9m,ishkabibbles84,0,Fri Oct 10 16:43:06 2014 UTC,"My answer is 76-86.  Even if you add LaRoche and get bounce back year from Braun, the regression inline for Gomez and Lucroy along with the once again average pitching staff do not bode well for the team.  I have said for the whole year that this team was going to look a lot like, and did look like, the 2006 Astros.  Aging roster, declining farm system, and a few Free Agent signings that will wind up sort of crummy near the end of the contracts."
Brewers,2iuy9m,DanG_ReaL,3,Fri Oct 10 14:56:51 2014 UTC,I'm right there with you on that prediction. I'm worried about what the next 3 years will look like for the brew crew. I don't see much coming up from our farm system and I don't think Milwaukee will be able to get much from fee agency.   Worst case scenario the brewers are hardcore sellers at the trade deadline ending up well below .500 and the best case being they end up right around .500 missing the playoffs. I might be cynical yet from the season end but the future doesn't look great for the crew.
Brewers,2iuy9m,gobrewcrew,4,Fri Oct 10 15:42:09 2014 UTC,"My gut agrees with both of you. I'm afraid our window has closed for the time being, that for the bright spots we have, our talent isn't nearly consistent enough to actually contend.   But rather than ease back for a few season and try to focus on strengthening from within, I imagine Mark and Melvin are going to focus on keeping asses in the seats at Miller Park and spend too much in free agency in vain attempts to keep us in pseudo-contention."
Brewers,2iuy9m,beardslybro,3,Fri Oct 10 15:46:23 2014 UTC,I dont lucroy or Gomez are great recession candidates. They're just good players.   Braun should regress to his mean meaning he should be better. Ramirez could see some regression because of his age. Scooter batting against lefties will probably hurt his numbers.  The bullpen scares me. Zach duke will not be that good again. I'm saying 83 wins
Brewers,2iuy9m,EricH7,1 point,Fri Oct 10 16:58:33 2014 UTC,"I agree with you on Gomez and Luc. Luc has been playing great ball for the past 3 years, not just this year, and Gomez played good in 2012 and got better over the past 2 years. They are just good Major league ball players. Braun should be back to his normal form if his thumb is good. Ramierz will probably regress, and we can only hope that Scoots figures out lefties. Scoots and Davis throughout their careers have shown once they settle into whatever level they are at they are really good hitters so maybe they finally settle in. As far as 1B goes we'll see how this offseason goes.   Pitching wise I'm not too worried about the bullpen. Duke may not have as great a year but next year we won't be burning a spot in the bullpen for the 1st half of the year overworking some guys. Hopefully we resign K-Rod, Henderson should be back, Thornburg will be, and if starting doesn't workout for Nelson next year he has great 8th inning stuff. Starting staff will be good once again."
Brewers,2iuy9m,SolidRambo,1 point,Mon Oct 13 19:54:34 2014 UTC,"Around .500. I did a simulation in R and the 95% confidence level put the confidence intervals for wins between 76 and 80. Of course, that's a really preliminary analysis and there's a lot that can still happen...   I want to be optimistic, but I feel the same way a lot of other people in this thread do. Just about everything would have to go right to get us into the playoffs. I hope I'm way off base and they kick ass, though."
Brewers,2iuy9m,gimmesomespace,1 point,Sun Oct 12 17:36:28 2014 UTC,Under .500 if they try to start the season with 3 actual starting pitchers again.
Brewers,2iuy9m,Shazmanoid,2,Sat Oct 18 21:52:46 2014 UTC,"Depends if we keep Roenicke. If we do, probably somewhere around .500. If we could find someone who actually institutes discipline and keeps the team focused, probably much better than that."

I personally think we play in the toughest division in the N.L., if not THE toughest division in baseball. The Cubs will be better (you'd think..) and the Pirates and Cardinals will put up a dogfight all year long. Who knows about the Reds honestly.  Gomez and Lucroy will come down to Earth. You'd have to imagine Braun will improve to help level it out."
Brewers,2iuy9m,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Fri Oct 10 16:05:18 2014 UTC,"I'm going to say a bit over .500 but missing the playoffs. I'll go with 84-78.  While most of our team is still together, and we got some promising call-ups this year, I think this year was the peak for several of our players. Wily and Fiers both had great second halves, and I see them hitting a bit of a sophomore slump through at least a portion of the season."
Brewers,2iuy9m,tr1ppn,1 point,Fri Oct 10 15:58:31 2014 UTC,"I think next year will be very much the same as this year. Yes, Lucroy and Gomez and had amazing years and probably won't produce as well, but I really don't think either player will regress so much it drastically affects their value. The rest of the club I expect to be right about where it was this year, with a little fluctuation.    Ramirez is old, but consistent, but will probably be less valuable than this year.  Segura had a terrible year, but a lot of things happened, and a lot can change in a year. I don't expect anything like his first year, but I expect something better than this year. If Scooter can hit vs the lefty, he will likely be more valuable than last year. If he still can't figure that part of the game out, he will be less valuable than this year. Anything at 1B will likely be better than what we had, so I'll count this as a plus. I expect the bullpen, as a whole, to be just as or slightly less effective as this year. I expect the rotation, as a whole, to be just as or slightly less effective as this year.   I think a realistic expectation is near .500, give or take 5 games either way. I would say 3rd in the division, 4th if the Reds or Cubs put together a great year. I expect the Pirates and Cards to stay on top.  What I am more concerned about, as seems to be the case with those that have posted before me, is going forward. Free Agency has been bleak, trades have been small but effective, but the farm system isn't looking great. There are certainly a few that will make it, but nothing of note. I would suspect at least 3 years (or more) of mediocre baseball with a mediocre team. My wager would be .500 give or take 5 games over that span. I certainly don't think the Brewers need to go into full blown rebuilding mode, but I do think that there needs to be some shaking up in the scouting department, as there is no way our farm system can be this empty on trades alone.  tl;dr - .500 give or take 5 games and 3rd-5th place for the next 3 years."

Im pretty damn happy!  7ish years ago i was in a long distance relationship with a girl from Colorado (originally from KC).  I actually talked to her today when i was watching the Chiefs game, and we ended up talking for quite some time about the Royals.  Was a good time, and i found it kinda funny how she said the difference between the Royals and the Chiefs is that the Royals have won a playoff game in her lifetime....hehhheh.  Anywho, go AL at this point.  The only team i can stand from the NL at this point is the Nats, and theyre...not looking good.  Edit: Also, those ALCS games are going to be fucking awesome."
Brewers,2if14p,necropaw,1 point,Mon Oct 6 07:03:48 2014 UTC,"I used to like the Royals as a kid for some random reason, back in the days of RBI Baseball for the NES, and all these former Brewers have kind of rekindled that interest (I won't lie either, and call me a fair weather fan if one must, but them being in the playoffs doesn't hurt either)  Was also a fan of both the Giants and As growing up.  Giants because of the likes of Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, the As because of Canseco and McGuire.  Though my love of the As rapidly dwindled, I'm still a big fan of the Giants.  So yeah, safe to say that at the onset of the playoffs, I was immediately rooting for a Giants-Royals World Series."
Brewers,2if14p,eidetic,-2,Thu Oct 9 19:06:49 2014 UTC,"I will never forgive Doug Melvin for giving Aoki away for a very ""meh"" receiver.  And before any of you jump in here saying Will Smith had half of a good year, I can tell you that a full 162 games (plus playoffs) of Aoki leading off is infinitely more valuable than ~25-30 innings of decent relief.  Finding decent relievers are a dime a dozen.  One of his worst trades. He got 40 cents on the dollar for Aoki who was looked at as a very valuable piece from other teams."
Brewers,2if14p,MustBeNice,9,Mon Oct 6 09:59:56 2014 UTC,"Eh, Khrush produced better than Aoki, which is a big reason that trade was made, so I liked that move."
Brewers,2if14p,sjm1541,5,Mon Oct 6 12:31:15 2014 UTC,"Also, the Royals have to deal with Aoki being on the open market this offseason while Will Smith isn't a free agent until 2020. Aoki will be 33 next year, he's a singles hitter who is a below average defender and seems to be slowing down quickly."
Brewers,2if14p,MustBeNice,2,Mon Oct 6 15:28:06 2014 UTC,"Well we don't really need another decent but not great power guy who strikes out a ton. We have enough of those with Weeks, GoGo & now Braun (if 2014 is any indication of things to come).    Nori is a player that rarely strikes out (49 compared to 122 for Khris) really good speed (17 steals compared to 4, & that's with Yost being more conservative on the base paths than Ron) and a fantastic OBP (.349 compared to Khris's .299).  Obviously you love Khris's decent power, but again, that's not the player the Brewers really need to take that next step.  Also don't pay attention to Nori's defensive metrics, they get all bungled because he plays the position muchhh differently than his counterparts, which is how they calculate defensive WAR."
Brewers,2if14p,Necatorducis,3,Mon Oct 6 19:35:33 2014 UTC,"Will Smith was, on the whole, good the entire year.  He gave up 27 earned runs and 31 runs in total in 78 appearances, 19 of those earned runs coming from 6 outings.  He had one bad week and a couple sporadic poor outings.  In his other 72 appearances he gave up a total of 8 earned runs.  He is 24 years old and under Brewers control for 5 more seasons; I think the Brewers got a great deal, especially if he continues to improve."
Brewers,2if14p,MustBeNice,-2,Mon Oct 6 16:38:45 2014 UTC,"19 of those earned runs coming from 6 outings   I know the correlation isn't perfect, but interestingly enough, the Brewers missed the playoffs by 6 games."

Brewers,2if14p,oldprospector21,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:49:41 2014 UTC,The GMs job is to make the team strong not just for the year but for the future and he did that while NOT endangering our chances in 2014. Aoki would not have made this a playoff team. If you followed his season this year you know Aoki hit .260s most of the year until he had a scorching hot 13 for 16 in september to put him up in the .280s. Check out his splits for the year. OPS' under .710 the entire year until a scorching hot .900 the last month. THere is no guarantee that Nori would have even kept his starting job the way he played to open the year.
Brewers,2if14p,CJL13,1 point,Tue Oct 7 22:45:54 2014 UTC,There is also no guaranty he would have hit the way he did in KC in Milwaukee
Brewers,2if14p,MustBeNice,2,Tue Oct 7 22:46:15 2014 UTC,You thought Gomez/Weeks/Scooter were bad leadoff guys?
Brewers,2if14p,OrfeoKimble,0,Mon Oct 6 11:55:29 2014 UTC,"Gomez is one of maybe 10 true 5 tooled players in the league, but personally he's either the best or second best (depending if you think Braun's 2014 was an aberration or not) and therefore should be utilized in the 3, 4 or 5 slot.  Weeks has lost ALL speed, he is horrific on the basepaths (he actually had more caught stealings than stolen bases last year), and while he walks a good amount, he strikes out WAY too much to be a leadoff guy anymore. You ideally never want to start off the game with a strikeout. Scooter Gennett, I love the guy, but he is the definition of a replacement level player. When you look at WAR, the R stands for ""replacement"" & is essentially referring to a guy like Scooter.  His OBP just can't cut it at the lead off spot, at .320. Also he posted below average speed levels with 3 caught stealings compared to only 6 SB's. Platoon or bench guy at best."

Brewers,2if14p,SolidRambo,1 point,Tue Oct 7 06:21:11 2014 UTC,"All you need to do is look at Gennett's WAR to know that isn't true. He's been worth nearly 2 wins over a replacement player in both of the last two seasons. That's slightly below average, but definitely not replacement level. Left handed platoon players can get by because of how many right handed starters there are in the league. His career OBP against righties is .355, 2 points higher than Aoki's career OBP.  I'd also like to see anything that shows a strikeout is a worse way to begin a game than a groundout to short. Weeks at the end of his career didn't really have the makings of a lead off hitter, but in his prime he got on base and in the end thats the most important thing if you don't slot anywhere else. He was patient, he took walks and he was competent on the bases which negate the Ks."
Brewers,2if14p,MustBeNice,2,Tue Oct 7 17:05:25 2014 UTC,"I would argue we had a very ""meh"" bullpen in 2012 and they blew so many games. Hernandez, Loe and Veras were all very ""meh"" and you couldn't trust them to hold a game as far as you can throw them. I would also argue that Will Smith wasn't ""meh."" Dude pitched the second most games in the MLB and as a young pitcher, he certainly had to have been experiencing fatigue at some points.  While I really liked Aoki on the Brewers, we had a stacked outfield prior to the trade (and arguably since he came to the team.. remember he was a back-up who had a pinch hit role at the start of the 2012 season). Brewers went into that trade with the intention of having somebody who might grow into a #3/4 starter or a good reliever for many years.  In other words, I sincerely doubt that Aoki's presence and Smith's absence would've gotten us into the playoffs."
Brewers,2if14p,sjm1541,-1,Tue Oct 7 01:56:53 2014 UTC,"I actually agree with most of what you said.  Well except no WAY Smith becomes even a solid #5, he just doesn't have the plus pitch yet or the stamina, so hoping he becomes a 3 or 4 is mostly a pipe dream.  I'm not saying Aoki is a world beater and they would've been 100 win team with him, BUT I think they could've gotten wayyy more for him from a team who was desperate for a solid lead off hitter (a rare and valuable commodity in the league) like at least a couple lower top ten prospects."

As much as I like Ramirez, I don't think he's going to be worth $14.5m next year, but we're in a position where we have to offer him the money.

Brewers,2ibmtr,meltedlaundry,1 point,Sun Oct 5 22:44:16 2014 UTC,Catching guys stealing bases isn't all on him though. None of our pitchers besides Lohse are really good at holding runners.

Brewers,2ibmtr,jubjub2184,1 point,Sun Oct 5 22:59:11 2014 UTC,"Lucroy was above league average in 2010 for CS%, but was below every year since. He's a terrific catcher but if you're being honest you'll admit that throwing out base runners is not one of his strengths. In the past two seasons he's given up more than 160 stolen bases. Supposing pitchers are doing their jobs, that number goes down to 100. Still not a good number.  Can't argue Will Smith. He was indeed overworked."
Brewers,2ibmtr,meltedlaundry,1 point,Sun Oct 5 23:08:41 2014 UTC,"I've been saying that for a while now, yes. Luc's big downfall is CS%. That's really the reasoning behind the ""Molina is a class of his own"" statements around ASBreak time..."

He has an average arm and does not have very good mobility back there.  His bat has always been the thing that would carry him.    This move should have been made two years ago.  He isn't Wil Myers, but RF is the best position for him.  If he can mash in the FSL next year he is a legit prospect, if not he probably grades out as average, which isn't bad."

Brewers,2i8iad,Burrda16,1 point,Sat Oct 4 16:23:50 2014 UTC,Whatever gets his bat to Milwaukee the fastest is where he should be playing. I'm not sure right field is the best option as the Crew has a huge hole at both corner infield spots and has a deep outfield. As of now he is still a few years away and with Aramis being 36 years old he may retire before Coulter makes it to the show. Bottom line I would've liked to see them move him to a corner infield spot.
Brewers,2i8iad,MIAMarc,1 point,Sat Oct 4 18:41:44 2014 UTC,They'd probably make him a corner infielder if he could play there. It's kind of like Khris Davis. They gave him a shot in the offseason to learn 1B and he just couldn't do it. Going from C to RF usually means you aren't all that good defensively.
Brewers,2i8iad,consolecarrypermit,1 point,Mon Oct 6 05:29:50 2014 UTC,I've heard from several people that Braun might move to first and I don't know how to feel about that
Brewers,2i8iad,smiles134,2,Sat Oct 4 01:03:16 2014 UTC,I think it's incredibly stupid. Braun has too good of a arm to play first. Not to mention his defense at third was atrocious.
Brewers,2i8iad,jubjub2184,2,Sat Oct 4 02:34:50 2014 UTC,"But we currently have Davis/Gomez/Parra to handle the outfield and we haven't had a reasonable solution at first since Hart. Braun at first is the only way to get all our best players on the field at once, that's why I'm not totally against it."
Brewers,2i8iad,Tusky_McMammoth,2,Sat Oct 4 16:24:09 2014 UTC,"Davis has no arm though. And he hit .240, if he didn't hit home runs I really don't think he'd have any value to the team. I still think we should trade him, let parra have right and put Braun back in left. Picking up either a free agent first basemen or trading for one, that can play everyday."
Brewers,2i8iad,jubjub2184,1 point,Sat Oct 4 16:29:37 2014 UTC,"I don't see any free agent first basemen who I'd rather have than Davis though. If we can pull off a trade then I won't complain, but that seems unlikely as well..."

Brewers,2i8iad,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Sun Oct 5 12:46:42 2014 UTC,"Sure, but he is much older and will be much more expensive than Davis, so I don't see how that's an upgrade. I would be ok having LaRoche on the Brewers, but not if he's going to cost $10 mil"
Brewers,2i8iad,Tusky_McMammoth,1 point,Sun Oct 5 15:16:52 2014 UTC,"LaRoche would be a huge upgrade. He would provide similar power numbers (maybe slightly lower, but him in Miller Park could be huge), a much higher OBP (Career .340 to Davis's .311), a patient approach from the left side of the plate (82 BB's last year to KD's 32), and he plays great defense at 1B.  We all know how KD's defense out in left can be.  Personally I think KD isn't the type of player this team needs, as all he provides is home run power.  I think having Parra in left more often would be beneficial to the team, defensively and just to mix in a left-handed bat in our right handed heavy lineup."
Brewers,2i8iad,OrfeoKimble,1 point,Tue Oct 7 06:02:24 2014 UTC,Trade Davis for one year of Parra? Parra can't hit lefties and you can't just remove the home runs from Davis. He did hit them and will continue to hit them.
Brewers,2i8iad,sjm1541,2,Sat Oct 4 17:27:28 2014 UTC,We have enough home run hitters. We need someone who can just get on base consistently and be smart about it.
Brewers,2i8iad,Robert_The_Tire,1 point,Sat Oct 4 19:22:52 2014 UTC,"1B is a substantially easier position than 3B. If a guy can play SS at a big time college and 3B (even poorly) in the Majors, he should be able to handle 1B.   Moving Braun to 1B allows the Brewers a ton of options. It also insures that they don't have to go out and pay for a starting 1B this off season, when they are already paying for 4 starting OFs."
Brewers,2i5xio,necropaw,12,Fri Oct 3 05:27:15 2014 UTC,"It doesn't have to always be something fresh and new, but it should stay baseball-related.  It would be fine to have random blasts from the past.  Yount, Molitor, Deer, Fingers, Nilsson, Surhoff, Plesac, or whatever random name comes to mind on a whim.  Reminiscing about past players is neat, too."
Brewers,2i5xio,_Heathen_,4,Fri Oct 3 06:41:50 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty laid back about it all, really. I wouldn't mind seeing some of the former Brewers who are now in the playoffs with other teams in the sidebar. The occasional Packers pic is alright by me, but maybe keep it a majority of baseball pics?  Either way, you've done a good job with it and it doesn't need to change every other day or anything."
Brewers,2i5xio,gobrewcrew,2,Fri Oct 3 14:31:36 2014 UTC,"Ever given any thought to off season fan pics?  Tailgating pics, brewer party pics, stuff like that?"
Brewers,2i5xio,togglenuts,2,Fri Oct 3 12:59:37 2014 UTC,I think the former brewers in playoffs with different teams is a cool idea. I also think once November rolls around of using past pictures of Brewers greats. Only (approximately) 19 weeks to go before spring training!
Brewers,2i5xio,Il_Tenente,2,Fri Oct 3 16:32:08 2014 UTC,Fine by me. I also like the JJ/Aoki idea.
Brewers,2i5xio,TheBause,2,Fri Oct 3 05:31:37 2014 UTC,"I love the Pack, but I hate /r/greenbaypackers .  In my opnion it's way to circle-jerky, way to quick to criticize, and there are way too many memes.  I think it's a pretty low quality sub, probably because of how popular it is.  That being said, I don't mind the /r/brewers side-bar being packers related, but I understand /u/chajimak 's point.  I guess in the end it's only the side-bar so it's not a huge deal, but I do like the propsects idea.  I would also not mind getting some Aoki/Cain/Escobar love up in this bitch.  They're still rolling down in KC."
Brewers,2i5xio,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Fri Oct 3 13:32:21 2014 UTC,Maybe start a sidebar submission thread. Then you can choose something someone wants to see...   I'm ok with Packer stuff/former Brewers in playoffs stuff..or whatever. Maybe find cool pictures of Miller Park.
Brewers,2i5xio,Amoney8612,1 point,Fri Oct 3 09:20:06 2014 UTC,Once winter meetings get going trade rumors and stuff can be the sidebar pic. I'm okay with a little Pack for a while since there's not much else going on for the Crew.

Brewers,2i5xio,gobrewcrew,1 point,Fri Oct 3 20:24:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think it was having the same one for two months during the actual season, as well as the fact that no one around was capable of changing it that was the problem."

Brewers,2i5xio,oldprospector21,6,Sat Oct 4 07:17:35 2014 UTC,"I get the sentiment, but do you want the same picture of hank for the next 6 months?"

Brewers,2i423o,Cody1017,2,Thu Oct 2 19:07:05 2014 UTC,I had like 80% but I didn't know them from the hints.
Brewers,2i423o,smiles134,1 point,Thu Oct 2 21:56:47 2014 UTC,"I got like 1 from the hints. I mean, if you read the instructions it says that every player is only used once, but that some answers have more than 1 player that could be correct. So you have to remember who you used, and then go back and change your answer if you find a better fit. Oh and they are presented in random order.   Yeah okay."
Brewers,2i423o,anon8609,1 point,Fri Oct 3 04:02:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it was really annoying.  Like I didn't know that one guy who played for st Louis before, I couldn't remember irving falu's name, and I forgot that caleb gindl played this year, but otherwise I would've gotten a majority without those bullshit hints and random order."
Brewers,2i423o,smiles134,1 point,Fri Oct 3 04:08:10 2014 UTC,I did much worse with the hints than I would have if I just got to list names.  Being on mobile also sucked... Only got 10 to fit.  I don't think I even found a spot for a single non-pitcher starter unless you count parra.

Brewers,2hzjto,SolidRambo,3,Wed Oct 1 20:39:23 2014 UTC,I want KC and PIT. Just for the shock value when some guy who has been in a coma for a decade wakes up to find that world series matchup.
Brewers,2hzjto,BaseballGuyCAA,3,Wed Oct 1 14:35:43 2014 UTC,"I'm rooting for the Royals for sure. They've sucked for 29 years, and as Brewers fans we all know that pain. Alcides, Nori, Cain, Yost, Svuem, happy to see these guys getting a shot and coming up big last night.  Although Ned still has some questionable managerial decisions, that team is fun to watch.    I'm pulling for the Pirates for similar reasons. Until last season they were in such an awful playoff drought for a looooong time.  Andrew McCutchen is probably top 3 in most exciting players in baseball, love watching him play (against anyone but us).    I'd love to see a KC/PIT matchup in the WS."
Brewers,2hzjto,OrfeoKimble,5,Wed Oct 1 18:31:47 2014 UTC,"Grew up in KC as a Royals fan. After 20 years of ownership and management giving the fans the middle finger, and living in Milwaukee for college, I fell in love with the Brewers.   I'm still skeptical if the Royals' management is working to ensure prosperity or not. I hope they are. Ned Yost is a good fit for them. But for now, I give a half-hearted root for KC while the Glass family (owners of Wal-Mart) bank in on this crazy year.  F the Cards."
