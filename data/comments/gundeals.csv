Just like you we don’t want to go broke trying to get ammunition, guns, and accessories. So, Triune Defense, Inc was created to help and serve those who love the sport as well. We want you to be able to get your hands on inexpensive ammunition, guns, and other accessories so that you can spend more time enjoying the sport instead of trying to figure out if you have enough money to spend to buy ammunition, guns or accessories. We love shooting ourselves, we love spending time with our friends shooting and we want you to be able to have plenty of opportunities to do so yourself. We want you to go out and have great times of fellowship with your friends and family at your local shooting range or area. We are continuing to research and expand our line of products to help you do that more.   Our logo captures what we believe. We are deeply committed Bible-Believing Christians that love God and desire to bring Him glory in all that we do. We believe that our real defense and protection comes from our Lord, Jesus Christ. The shield represents that safety that we have in Christ as we place our trust in Him for our salvation from our sins. The symbol on top of the shield is called the Shield of the Trinity. We believe that God is triune (Father, Son, Holy Spirit, but one). The last symbol is the Cross and its red for a purpose. God created us to worship Him at the beginning of creation. But because of man’s rebellion in the Garden we became separated from God, unable to live before Him. Because of this rebellion we are guilty before Him and have no hope in eternity. But God because of His great love and mercy, provided us the way to be reconciled to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus both fully God and fully Man came to live among us, and live a perfect life that we could not. He was crucified for our sake so that whoever would place their trust in Him alone for salvation would be saved from the wrath to come. The cross is red because it is only through the blood of Christ that we can be saved and cleansed from our sins. We love the Lord and desire that all would come to know Him in a saving way. If you have questions about this please feel free to email us or call our number to discuss this more.  Locate a local church! Gospel Coalition – or – 9Marks  Some of you may notice that we only list being at Gun Shows, Friday or Saturday and that we will not be at the Gun Shows on Sunday. This is because we believe that we as Christians should regularly fellowship with a body of believers in a local church. Through this we can grow in our understanding and love for the Lord as well have opportunities to worship Him alongside fellow believers. Because of this we will not be open on Sundays for Gun Shows. We would love to have opportunities to fellowship with you as we worship our Lord. If you need help find-ing a local church, here are some resources that can help you find a church, or feel free to email us, we would love to help you with finding one."

gundeals,3douh8,NoClassic,4,Sat Jul 18 03:04:11 2015 UTC,Woah really? Refused to service one of their pistols? I didn't realize their warranty was so conditional. What did they say was the reason?
gundeals,3douh8,crimdelacrim,7,Sat Jul 18 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"It was one of the first of the large batches of .40 trade ins that came up for sale maybe a year and a half ago. The early pistols are  known to have issues with their slide finish and mine was showing some oxidation on the front and back serrations. I knew being a used pistol it was unlikely they would do a repair of that expense but went ahead and sent it in. They called back a week or so later and approved the repair, replacement slide. Another couple weeks passed with no word so I called for an update at which time I was told it had never been approved for repair. I was able to speak with someone who managed their service center and he accused me of fabricating the call in which the repair had been approved. I even provided them with the technicians name as well as time and date of the call.  It was a really strange deal and kind of turned me off of buying any more of their stuff."

gundeals,3dn081,turnoffable,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"No wobble.  In fact, the first one I got and installed was so tight on the receiver extension that I thought I had a commercial buffer tube.  After a bunch of measuring to make sure I didn't I went back to installing it and got it installed.    So, the one on my ghost (clear) ar-15 is super tight but I can't remember which brand receiver extension I'm running.  The one on my SBR is running a Spikes receiver extension (with t2 buffer) and it still has no wobble but is easier to move on the tube."

gundeals,3dm4gn,Sloppy_Twat,4,Fri Jul 17 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"The scorpion is completely unusable without taking a dremel to the ambi safety they mounted ON THE GRIP ITSELF (where your hand goes).   If they fucked that up, think how they designed the rest of the gun.

gundeals,3dm4gn,V0RT3XXX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:33:38 2015 UTC,That's subjective though. Personally I think both looks equally good.

gundeals,3dm4gn,V0RT3XXX,0,Fri Jul 17 22:45:29 2015 UTC,Not sure I understand the need for ur sarcastic comment. You stated the sig looks better as if it's a fact. I simply said it's personal opinion and that mine is that they look both equally good.

I run a 1-4x24 on my AR and run PA's new generation 4-14x44 FFP on my Rem700 build.  The first 4-14 had a canted reticle but PA hooked it up and my new one is perfect.  Unless I had a purpose built SPR build I would hesitate to put a larger mag optic on it since it makes it more difficult for close targets."

gundeals,3d747a,mr_perry_walker,5,Tue Jul 14 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"I have one and like it quite a bit in spite of its flaws. The DA trigger is the second worse I own (first going to the CZ 70) and while I like the SA some may find it too light. It also has one of the idiot safety/decocker combos. That said I have found it to be stupid accurate despite is size, it is well made, I have had no major reliability issues and I am quite fond of its aesthetics."
gundeals,3d747a,cplhunter,5,Tue Jul 14 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"You can replace the hammer spring to give a much improved DA trigger. However, the SA trigger becomes rather light as a result. It's a delicate balance."

gundeals,3d747a,dirmer3,4,Tue Jul 14 16:45:00 2015 UTC,"Simply put, I love my P64. I use it as a carry piece. I have put a couple thousand rounds through mine without so much as one hiccup. It's so accurate I can shoot the wings off a gnat. The downside is you really feel the recoil in the Web of your hand and I get slide bite sometimes. Generally, my hand is pretty sore after shooting a couple hundred rounds in one sitting. Also, the double action is so heavy I use it as a safety - maybe I'm just weak but it takes two hands for me to pull the trigger. Single action is very nice, though. It is a really well made gun and I think it has a really cool look. For the price, I've never had a better handgun."
gundeals,3d747a,jayemo,4,Tue Jul 14 02:41:58 2015 UTC,"The downside is you really feel the recoil in the Web of your hand and I get slide bite sometimes.   I've never gotten slide bite but I've gotten bruised to a point where it starts bleeding if that counts :(  re: carrying hammer down safety off - I'm sure you know and I'm by no means trying to lecture you but these things are not drop safe in the least bit and I've read one account on the ""unofficial"" p64 forum about a guy that had a nd via trying to holster/pocket the pistol, partially pulling the hammer back, then having the hammer fall and discharge a round."
gundeals,3d747a,dirmer3,2,Tue Jul 14 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have heard they are not drop safe and I can see how partially pulling the hammer back and letting it go could cause a ND. I suppose it's not really the best pistol to carry. I just really like it for some reason."
gundeals,3d747a,jayemo,2,Tue Jul 14 03:54:20 2015 UTC,"Ah I hear ya.  What holster do you use? I don't carry mine (mine has an odd issue where when I go from safe to fire, sometimes it's still ""safe"". sear/hammer issue) but I did get a pocket holster for if I ever did - Desantis N38 - perfect fit and completely covers trigger."
gundeals,3d747a,dirmer3,2,Tue Jul 14 22:59:09 2015 UTC,I actually use that exact same holster. Carry it in my pocket. It works well.
gundeals,3d747a,jayemo,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Oh very nice!   I'd like to tinker with mine to see what's up. Unless I forcefully fling the safety forward it somehow still stays engaged (so lever is in fire but the trigger isn't engaged). The weird thing is that's only when it's chambered. If the chamber is clear, I can push it as soft as possible with my pinkie and the safety fully disengages as it should. I need to strip it down and tinker but just haven't had time.  What carry ammo do you use? It's nice to see that Hornady makes Critical Defense in that cartridge. I picked up 4 boxes of it from Academy a long time ago to the tune of ~13 per box of 25. Wish I would have gotten more since it seems like that stuff runs upwards of 20 bucks a box now. Upside is that it cycled issue free in mine, and for that matter, mines never hung up even on the cheapest steel cased stuff."
gundeals,3d747a,dirmer3,2,Tue Jul 14 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"That is really strange, I have never encountered that issue. Take her apart and see what you find.  I use the Hornady Critical Defense. I'm a big fan."
gundeals,3d747a,kyrpa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"As others have said, they're very accurate for their size, recoil is very sharp despite it being an all steel pistol (blowback so it goes right into the webbing of your hand). Usually any more than a box of 50 in a range trip and my hand is bruised. Still, very fun little gun, I carry mine on occasion."

Good to replace the springs as the DA is a bear (~22-24lbs or something retarded). As someone mentioned below, recoil is a bit ""snappy"". I have heard people do like this as a daily carry due to its size, but just make sure to get plenty of range time to assess reliability.   I can't see how anyone can go wrong for $179. I have also picked up the Tokarev TTC (Romanian, wish I held out for Polish) from Classic.   Since that purchase, I have also picked up a FEG Hi-power and a Star Model Super B. My fave so far? Super B. Feels good in the hand. Accurate. 1911-like without the 1911 pricetag."

gundeals,3d7hvi,HitLines,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:59:35 2015 UTC,300 rounds works out to about 48.5 cents per round so it does get a little bit cheaper the more you buy too.

gundeals,3db2ij,peanutbuttergoodness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"I bought two uppers and lower parts kits.  Essentially complete rifles minus the lower.  The uppers are fine.  Sock and buffer tube are good.  But the lower parts kit is the worst I've ever come across.  The trigger is absolute horse shit.  Its so bad I had to use triggers from old parts kits I had lying around.  I've never felt something so mushy.  Go pull the trigger on a weapon with the safety on.  Theres a little bit of pull, then it stops, and returns to where it started.  These sometimes don't move at all with the safety engaged.  Sometimes it does move, but then doesn't return to its normal position.  I've never felt anything like this.  Threw in another trigger and the problem is gone.  These triggers are a waste of space even in my trash can.  Also the included pistol grip was drilled too deep and the safety detent and spring wouldn't engage.  I cut a small nail and dropped it in the hole on the pistol grip to get the safety spring and detent to properly engage.  It works fine now, but thats pretty lame.    TL;DR.  I'd buy the upper again, but no way in hell I'd get the lower parts kit."

gundeals,3d35f6,Laruik,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:19:39 2015 UTC,It took me a weeks and I had to pay extra to get the two tone FDE and Black model. It's like $640 right now.

gundeals,3d35f6,Laruik,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"Eh I like it and it looks really ""Tacticool Oper8tor"" especially with a Inforce APL on it. The grip is a little rough on the hands and the frame overall feels a little cheap for the amount of money I paid for it. The trigger is decent at best with a spongy feel to it. It feels better during actual live fire than during dry fire. The low bore axis and the lengthy lock up time makes the gun really soft shooting, with very easy and manageable recoil for a 45. The 15+1 capacity is another advantage over comparable 45s. I shoot better with this gun than with my USP45 but of course, I do like my USP's overall fit and finish.   FNH does not offer a threaded barrel separately as they did with the FNP45 and aftermarket ones go for $245. I wasn't planning on a suppressor so soon so I didn't get the tactical model and I liked the two tone FDE and Black color a lot but after spending money on a threaded barrel and night sights, I could have just gotten tactical model."

gundeals,3d35f6,ThatPhoneGuy,2,Mon Jul 13 05:17:51 2015 UTC,The $900 range.   If you are planning to get get a suppressor later or mount and RMR later then get the tactical. OEM threaded barrels for the FNX aren't being sold by FNH yet and aftermarket ones go for like $250. Night sights are around $100 bucks anyways.

gundeals,3co5no,synodone,3,Thu Jul 9 18:10:42 2015 UTC,Yes.  Couple things to think about though. 1) Verify that the external diameter of the suppressor is smaller than the internal diameter of the handguard. 2) Suppressors get very hot.  That handguard is made of aluminum.  Aluminum does an excellent job of conduction heat.  They are in very close proximity to each other.  Ergo the handguard might get very hot too. 3) Think about how you're going to attach/detach/tighten the suppressor once the handguard is installed.

There is also a guy who blued a Hi Power on youtube.  Search for slow rust bluing.  That's the easiest method that results in a strong finish.  Hot salt bluing also works well but it's a bit harder set up to make.    Cold bluing is terrible.  Its only any good for covering the stray idiot mark on a gun.

gundeals,3cfu0w,oshaCaller,5,Tue Jul 7 21:53:15 2015 UTC,Fiocchi 9mm was this price shipped from rare ammo during their sale also. Brass all day err day.

gundeals,3cfu0w,GoopyBoots,9,Tue Jul 7 17:39:50 2015 UTC,For another $30 I'd rather not worry about increased barrel wear that can/may/may not come with with bi-metal jackets. Especially if I'm at a wash in cost after factoring in the brass.

gundeals,3cfu0w,GoopyBoots,2,Wed Jul 8 15:42:28 2015 UTC,Another great point. I do all my shooting outdoors so I didn't really think about that.
gundeals,3cfu0w,GoopyBoots,4,Wed Jul 8 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"It's not $30, it's $30 per 1000. That adds up. Enough for a whole brand new barrel and then some by the time you've shot the first one out. You'd have to reload or sell the brass to get your money back both of which take time."
gundeals,3cfu0w,SooInappropriate,3,Tue Jul 7 20:36:46 2015 UTC,I understand that it is another $30 per 1k.   I don't shoot nearly enough for barrels to become a wear part anyways no matter what ammo I'm shooting. Also depends on what company your gun is from. The gun I shoot the most is a Ruger SR9 and I'd have to send it in and do all that to get a new barrel. I'm pretty lazy when it comes to stuff like that.   I also may just want another excuse to further my brass hoard.
gundeals,3cfu0w,GoopyBoots,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:49:08 2015 UTC,Take barrel wear out of the equation and the only downsides I can see might be slightly more extractor wear? Yes it's a pain to get stuff replaced from a company like Ruger but they are more an exception than the norm.   If I had a reloading setup I'd always buy brass to maximize the value of the reloading equipment.
gundeals,3cfu0w,unllama,2,Tue Jul 7 21:48:26 2015 UTC,Wtf? I have dealt with Ruger and have nothing but rave reviews of the customer service I received. I have never heard anyone say anything to the contrary.
gundeals,3cfu0w,B_Wildman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:04:45 2015 UTC,Ruger doesn't sell spare parts so everything has to go back to them no matter how easy it would be to fix yourself.

I did pick up a Remington 870 Tactical shotgun for 275 from them when they had it on sale, which was the lowest price I have ever seen on it.

gundeals,3cjxun,SupraMario,2,Wed Jul 8 17:06:01 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Also bi-metal is harder on steel targets if you plan to shoot those.  But in the long run still probably cheaper to replace the barrel and targets more often than to shoot brass if you're going to be putting a lot shots down range.

gundeals,3cchnx,Hovsky,6,Tue Jul 7 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"If you're doing UKD ranging and don't want to have to set it on a certain power to do so, then FFP is important.   If you're plinking on a KD range at your local club, or have a laser rangefinder, then your biggest problem will be holding for wind, but that's not that difficult.   This is all >500 yards. Under that and you'll have no issues with SFP.   Though the deal is for the V-plex reticle, which doesn't have MIL dots.

Military machine guns, saws and m4's, have looser chambers than commercial rifles due to the fact they have to fire under dirty conditions. Sometimes the base of the case expands too much. Hence the creation of the small base die which still doesnt fix all 556 military brase fired through a loose chamber. The fact you dont know that proves you have no clue what your selling and what your selling is too expensive. You can get 556 lc brass for 50/k all day long"

Eventually I took path that lead off the road onto a well-known but less traveled trail. About 250m down the trail I stopped and we knew what was about to happen.

gundeals,3bwyj9,PleaseStopCalling,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:56:40 2015 UTC,Nice. I'm a bit of a newb. What are these rounds going to be good at (besides being really accurate) or maybe not so good at? I ask because 50 grains seems mighty light.
gundeals,3bwyj9,stanleyfarnsworth,2,Fri Jul 3 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"They'll efficiently take small game, and at this price make great paper punching rounds."
gundeals,3bwyj9,TheRealMasterJeffe,2,Fri Jul 3 00:13:47 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Thank you!
gundeals,3bwyj9,stanleyfarnsworth,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:54 2015 UTC,"50 grains is definitely on the light side of things and it's typical for varmint/small game rounds. Varmint rounds are relatively fast and light for maximum energy transfer as quickly as possible because a bullet that doesn't start to expand or dump energy until 4 to 6 inches into soft tissue might as well not expand in smaller animals because it will go in one side out the other before the bullet has a chance to expand/fragment/tumble and dump its energy into the tissue which is often the case with heavier, more stable bullets.   They tend to fall short on penetration and penetrate less than the FBI ballistics standards that call for a minimum of 12 inches of penetration in order to reliably stop a threat. Basically these rounds ""grenade"" immediately upon hitting soft tissue and have nearly completely disintegrated by the time it gets to 6 to 8 inches into the target."
gundeals,3bwyj9,PleaseStopCalling,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:38:28 2015 UTC,Wow. Thank you! So what characteristics make up a good HD/SHTF round?
gundeals,3bwyj9,stanleyfarnsworth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of people go by the standards I mentioned, which is 12-18 inches of penetration in ballistics gel. Basically the rounds that most commonly meet that standard are heavier weight (60gr+) soft or hollow point bullets. FMJ rounds tend to overpenetrate and do nothing more than punch a neat little hole (exception being the M193 which was designed to tumble and fragment), and light varmint rounds like this one tend to not penetrate enough.  Hornady TAP, Federal Fusion/Speer Gold Dot, Winchester PDX1 are just a couple that work okay if you keep a mag loaded for your HD gun. Stockpiling that kind of ammo for SHTF is crazy expensive so a lot of people gravitate towards M193 ball which is just about as cheap as you can go but has higher tendency to tumble and cause more damaging wounds than M855."
gundeals,3bwyj9,PleaseStopCalling,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:08:01 2015 UTC,Okay. So M193 by the case and the fancy shit by the box or five or ten for HD. Gotcha. Thank you!

gundeals,3bt43x,HomicidalHeffalump,3,Thu Jul 2 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of the striker guns say they are DA because the striker isn't completely set after the slide is racked.  The striker sets completely by pulling the trigger and since you have to pull the trigger to set it, it is technically a DA although not in the sense we are used to such as a revolver.  This is why the trigger pull on striker guns isn't a clean break like the 1911, a true single action."

gundeals,3br32e,JamesTBagg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:17:06 2015 UTC,"If it's actually in the style of military hand guards, than there is a spring loaded nut near the receiver which holds the hand guards in place.

gundeals,3bobxv,787512,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your wants and needs are.  The CZ85 will have a wider trigger, ambidextrous controls, and no firing pin block.  The CZ85 looks more like an original CZ75 without the accessory rail the SP-01 has."
gundeals,3bobxv,unsupported,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"I love the cz85 because it has no firing pin block and adjustable sights. Unfortunately the frame is the combat's biggest weakness imo. It doesn't have the upswept beavertail like the sp01 frame does. The sp01 frame is beveled for easy mag changes and has some fair to decent checkering on it. The cz85 has neither of those features. Also if you like competitive shooting, the sp01 has extra weight under the muzzle to help mitigate muzzle rise and felt recoil. I guess it's just what you prefer really. This being said the cz85 combat is still a phenomenal range gun / plinker, it just wouldn't be the first cz that I buy, maybe the second or third one. If you plan on shooting A LOT, or shooting competitions then go for the sp01."
gundeals,3bobxv,nigrat904,3,Wed Jul 1 14:25:15 2015 UTC,Rookie question: What's the difference between this and the CZ75-B. I've shot a CZ-75B as a rental gun.
gundeals,3bobxv,nigrat904,4,Tue Jun 30 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Beveled magwell, checkering on the frame, and upswept beavertail are three huge features to the sp01 that are often overlooked."

gundeals,3bobxv,Gymnocalycium,3,Wed Jul 1 00:00:51 2015 UTC,What does the shadow have up on this one?
gundeals,3bobxv,nigrat904,5,Wed Jul 1 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"The CZ 75 SP-01 SHADOW features:  New style sights consisting of fiber optic front and Competition Style rear promote faster and more accurate target acquisition.  Shadow is fitted with a newly redesigned hammer originating from the CZ 75 Champion. This hammer is slightly wider and has modified sear engagement for smoother release and more positive ignition.  85 Combat style slide without firing pin block helps to smooth the trigger pull and improve distance of trigger reset.  85 Combat Style trigger with over travel adjustment helps to remove excess rear ward trigger movement.  Higher cuts beneath the trigger guard and beaver tail enable a higher grip on the gun, which helps to reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip.  Lighter recoil and main springs originating from original CZ 75 Specifications help to create a smoother more consistent action.  Safeties as found on the CZ 75 SA are fitted as standard; these provide a larger surface area for better positioning of the thumb.  Extended Magazine release allows for ease of reach and more positive ejection of magazine under stressful situations.  Fully beveled magazine well, substantially improves speed and ease of reloading.  Pistol is supplied with (3) 18 round 9mm magazines We will swap for 10 round magazines for appropriate states  (1) set of rubber grips.   This new generation of CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow pistol is designed for Law Enforcement, Military service, Self-defense, General Range Use and Competition.  These guns ship from us with 3 magazines making them and even better value."

They failed to mention anywhere on the website or via e-mail that they were completely out of BCGs and charging handles...they quickly e-mailed us tracking numbers but the uppers sat for WEEKS and every time we called we were told ""just a few more days.""  When we finally got them - the uppers shot extremely high at 50 yards (requiring us to max out the elevation on our optics).  I'll never do business with them again."
gundeals,3bjb8c,Benja455,3,Tue Jun 30 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair...they did say my order might have taken two or three weeks to ship if I recall correctly.  However they did not say why.    The upper I received does seem to shoot pretty high for some reason, but my primary arms scope luckily had more adjustment than my other optics that I maxed out.  Other than that, my upper has been very good to me so far. The grouping seems decent and i have not had any performance issues. I'm not sure if I could beat the price for the product I received. That being said, I don't think I would order other msf upper though."

One of you (not sure if it was you or maddirtyplumber) called last week and mentioned you might have an issue, said you both were going out to the range to shoot them again. I said to call me back and let me know what you found out, but I never heard back. We would be glad to help, you just have to talk to us.  Regarding the bcg delay, yes we did go through a period of a couple weeks a while back where we could not get bcgs.  Multiple suppliers were out and couldn't get them to us. It sucked. We have plenty right now though and are shipping in 2-4 days on average.  note: During that time, we did post at the top of each page on the site that orders would take 2-3 weeks to ship.

gundeals,3bjmdv,stanleyfarnsworth,3,Tue Jun 30 02:49:48 2015 UTC,The Wolf Gold that /u/YFC mentioned is currently the hands down cheapest brass cased ammo to shoot.  Not everyone likes Wolf Gold (I personally shoot it and am satisfied with it) or have specific brands they like.  The PMC brass is seen as being much more robust than the Wolf Gold and subsequently can be reloaded more often.  And as mentioned the Fiocchi is known to be on the hot side which has it's own benefits.  The other pro to the above are the shipping costs.  Shipping is different for everyone obviously and some can't get good shipping rates from the usual low price leaders so these deals can be of benefit to them.  Also if you're buying in large bulk (i.e. multiple cases) the free shipping can tip things in favor as well.
gundeals,3bjmdv,YFC,2,Tue Jun 30 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"While these are decent deals, The Armory and SG Ammo both have Wolf Gold .223 listed for $299 per case, and shipping ranges between $12 and $16, generally, making those cheaper.  For $350+ per case you're probably better off getting a case of Swiss-made Geco .223 from SG Ammo, as it'll be more consistent than the XTac stuff for roughly the same price."
gundeals,3bjmdv,stanleyfarnsworth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! I am totally ignorant on this one. I would hate to buy a case and then find out ""Oh that's as corrosive as dragons breath shot shells and it's primer is a POS"" etc.   I hear Wolf Gold is really terrific for plinking/SHTF application.  I don't know anything about that Swiss ammo but I'll look it up. Is the Swiss stuff legit 855?"
gundeals,3bjmdv,YFC,3,Tue Jun 30 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"The days of questionable-but-cheap brass cased surplus 5.56 (looking at you Guatemalan M193) are long over. Pretty much any factory ammo, brass cased or not, is gonna be usable and safe, but some stuff is still gonna be better than others (e.g. Remington UMC being filthy and kinda under loaded).  Fiocchi tends to load there stuff pretty hot, so for $320 shipped that ammo in the OP is probably a decent deal, by the way, although you'll get 1000 rounds of Wolf Gold in an ammo can for that price at The Armory. In regards to the Swiss Geco ammo, it's 55 grain, so not M855. It is very clean and very consistent (accurate) ammo, though. If you're just wanting M855 then you might want to wait and see if SG Ammo gets more Swedish surplus in, as the deal they had recently ($359 per case) was the cheapest it has been in a while.  Since you said you're new to the ammo scrounging thing, don't be afraid of steel cased ammo like Wolf and Tula. It's dirty and pretty inconsistent, but it still works fine for just casual blasting. If you're more discerning in terms of performance, however, you'll likely be better served by sticking with the previously mentioned offerings."
gundeals,3bjmdv,stanleyfarnsworth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:55:21 2015 UTC,Copy that. Thank you!  The things I've been reading seem to indicate that 855 isn't anything super special so no worries about that. Maybe I'll just stick with the Wolf Gold until I learn more.

I'm actually hoping I can offload a few hundred rounds... Or keep them in the event I take another class. At least they won't go bad any time in the near future."
gundeals,3bh0ig,paulwhite959,3,Mon Jun 29 17:26:42 2015 UTC,Do you reload 9mm? How is the cost savings? I'm thinking about reloading specifically because of 44 Magnum. I'm not sure it's worth the effort for 9mm if I can buy it for 20 cents per round.
gundeals,3bh0ig,dapperpanda,3,Mon Jun 29 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: Yes it's worth it. It's even better if you can buy in bulk online and you're able to take advantage of when large quantities of components are available (able to drop hundreds of dollars at a time when powder is in stock or sales are happening).   I'm able to reload 9mm for ~.12/rd. If I had the money for bulk components, I would have been able to make'em for $0.08/rd.     Brass - Free (Range pick up, or picking up cases from my factory loads)  Primer: $30/1000 = $0.03/ea  Powder: $30/7000gr = $0.0043/gr * 3.2gr =  $0.012/rd  Projectile: 147gr Xtreme Copper Plated Bullet $41.56/500 = $0.08.ea   Total: $0.122/ea  Sadly it's just on a single stage, and it took me about 2.5hrs - 3hrs to make 200 rounds the other day. Which is a long time in my opinion, but I don't hate reloading, so it's not a total loss. One day I'll have a progressive, 400-500rds/hr would be ideal.  Your biggest problem will be finding pistol powder, if you have it available locally you're lucky. I don't know what component costs are for 44mag, but I imagine you'd be able to save quite a bit if you were reloading.  I wish I could afford to buy powder in bulk. 8lbs of Varget (Rifle powder) is $165 + $28 hazmat + $10(?) for shipping = $25.38/lb. Locally, when I can find it, Varget is $35 plus tax. 8lbs of Titegroup (pistol powder) is $20.63/lb online, ~$30+ locally (although I've only ever seen it once). That's not even making good use of paying for a hazmat fee either. I think you can order 48lbs of powder per hazmat charge.   All that being said, you may save money per round, but you'll just end up spending it on components. You'll get more bang bang per dollar, but you probably won't spend any less."
gundeals,3bh0ig,sd4473,3,Mon Jun 29 18:21:50 2015 UTC,Wideners has 8lbs. IMR4227 Smokeless Powder for $163.

gundeals,3bh0ig,dapperpanda,2,Mon Jun 29 21:49:25 2015 UTC,not to mention the start up cost. With single stages it's not bad but progressives aren't cheap; saving 8-10 cents a round it'll take ages to make back a 400 dollar set up.

From my calculations, I should be able to reload 44 mag for about .32/rd where as most ammo normally costs about .70/round so that is definitely a no brainer.  This is my first time hearing about the hazmat fee though.  That's discouraging."
gundeals,3bh0ig,Canary_in_a_Coma,3,Mon Jun 29 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"You only pay the hazmat fee for buying powder or primers online though. That's why it helps if you're able to buy a lot of powder or primers (or both) at a time, so you can really get the most out of that one fee."

gundeals,3b805t,drewforty,2,Fri Jun 26 21:39:06 2015 UTC,"Got this gun for my soon to be wife after spending about 5 trips to the range and local gun stores having her try every pistol they had which she might be able to carry.   This one won out, and I think she made a great choice. For fit in the hand it gets 4/5 stars from me because it is so damn thin, but for someone with smaller hands than mine or for a woman's hands it is a good choice. It also is VERY easy to make disappear on the body because of this. She can carry it in a belly band in yoga pants and a T-shirt and not print.   As for the trigger on the pro, very nice trigger pull and break. The down side is the reset, it is long. Very long. Even with the reset I can nail the IDPA down zero 6 times in a bill drill (single target at 7 yards) with this gun in under 4 seconds.   One thing to note for those of you used to a 1911 / browning Hi Power / CZ 75 grip angle: this will require you to cant your firing hand downward a bit more than what is natural to align the sights all the way. When I first started shooting it, I found it printing high when I was shooting faster. This was because my natural grip put the front sight high and I had to naturally point lower to align it. It is something to get used to but nothing bad about the gun. The sights are very low, and like everything else on the firearm very low drag.   After having put Sig Defensive pistol rounds, Hornady TAP, Hornady Critical Defense, lehigh defense, and my own hand loads through this gun I saw the following issues:   When first purchased my model came with a very roughly cut slide lock cut in the slide that meant it was impossible to send the slide home on an empty mag for my girlfriend OR EVEN FOR ME.   I have shot thousands and thousands of rounds in many guns and I have no problem with problematic guns not going into battery, but this beast was not carry ready upon arrival. It needed some smoothing. I spent a bit of time running some 2000 grit sand paper and some polishing compound with a wheel on my Dremel on the slide cut on the slide to smooth out the cut. This solved the problem in out an hour of careful polishing and reassembling to check function.   I knew the gun would break in with shooting so I only polished until I could send the slide home on a mag with snap caps in it, and let it do the rest with range time. After 400 rounds it has now broken in and can be sent into battery with a empty magazine inserted no problem.  The gun absorbed even faster snappy +P rounds well, but if you loose wrist it, the gun can tend to stove pipe on you. Shooters need to firm up the wrist, especially when full, to prevent this.   No other malfunctions occurred when firing after 400 rounds, and I had not lubed the gun since buying it from the factory.    One final editors note:   The gun is now my favorite carry gun as well, and though it had some initial polishing needed, it has since been a great purchase. 4.5/5"

There are a couple spots of some small specs of surface rust on the slide and on the barrel hood, but it isn't anything a little oil and elbow grease can't take care of.

gundeals,3aw5eg,theflyingp,3,Wed Jun 24 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"A little too late for me to get in ahead of I.O.'s reputation.. I can't speak for everyone, but I purchased one of their AKM's a bit after the company moved to Palm Bay, FL. I read the bad reviews on them from their days in (North?) Carolina, but I took a chance on them hoping the quality was better after setting up shop in Florida.  I'm no expert on AK's by any means, but I haven't had much to complain about with the rifle. I have had almost ZERO issue with the rifle at all. The only things I've had happen so far is one stovepipe out of around 2k rounds of cheap Wolf steel case. The second is the hammer (out of the box) had a tendency to ""stick"" when charging the rifle. After about 200 rounds it has fixed the problem a bit, I could probably clean up the hammer a bit with a Dremel if I wasn't so lazy. (I could also just take it to them as they aren't a long drive away for me) I have since added the magpul front ends and stock, as well as a Midwest Industries sidemount & a PA micro dot.  I will admit the included magazine is junk. It'll hold 28 rounds, but I wouldn't bet my life on it, it has strictly been put away for range duty only. Someone could probably 3d print a better AK mag.  Overall, I can't say every one of theirs will be great, but I've had a good experience with it since they've moved south."

Mine is great, I regularly cloverleaf at 100 yards from the irons and it runs flawlessly. But it was not always this way.   When I first got it, it wouldn't feed properly, stovepipes, and failure to fire. It was always accurate, more than any other AK I've shot, but the reliability really scared me. So I started dividing and conquering the issues. I dremmeled and polished the feed ramp, it was not kind to the ammo before the chamber. I sanded the rails for most of a ""GoT"" episode because they were burred. The pointy part of the rail that jutts out was bent and making contact with the bolt on the way forward. I bent it back best I could and dremmeled it down so there was no contact. I have more than 5K rounds through it now and I can't remember the last time I have had a problem.  The only thing I had to take it to a gunsmith for was the front sight. It was seized in the lowest position.  The components don't seem lower quality than my other AK or others I have played with but the assembly does seem like it could use more TLC. Time and patience fixed mine, so it may work on all of theirs."

Him:  ""We are currently in the testing phase for gen4 597 magazines.  If I send you the replacement gen3's then I won't be able to give you gen4's when they are ready.""  ...

The Ruger is an outstanding rifle; it's very accurate and dependable, plus it's obviously a semi-automatic. I have replaced pretty much everything on mine (Boyds thumb hole stock, match heavy barrel, all new internal components, nice scope, etc.)  Comparing it to the Henry is tough because they aren't at all the same shooting experience. The Henry is beautiful and well-built, but I think my kids love shooting it because they feel like they are back in the Wild West. My 12 year old is more accurate with the Henry than with my tricked out Ruger, but that's probably because it is what he shoots most.  My answer then is that you should get at least one of each :)"

gundeals,3aie92,icantcontrolmyself,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:22 2015 UTC,What are the key differences between the two?
gundeals,3aie92,proquo,9,Sun Jun 21 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"The ACO has an estimated battery life of 10,000 hours (a little over a year) while the PRO has an estimated battery life of 30,000 hours (over three years) on brightness setting 7 out of 10 at room temperature. The ACO is not night-vision-compatible, while the PRO is. The ACO comes with a minimalist Picatinny mount that is not adjustable for height. The PRO’s QRP2 Picatinny mount is quite larger, is capable of using risers, and features a large tightening knob. Though it is not height-adjustable, the ACO’s mount is designed to provide absolute cowitness with standard AR-15 iron sights (using the supplied riser, the PRO should also offer the same cowitness). The ACO is fully waterproof, while the PRO is submersible to 45 meters. The ACO does not include flip-up lens covers, while the PRO does. The ACO retails for about $390 online, while the PRO lists for approximately $435. The latter can be had for even less on sale, while I have yet to see the ACO on sale.   source"
gundeals,3aie92,two_xjs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that even though certain aimpoints aren't rated for night vision, you can still use them with night vision optics on the lowest setting.  I mounted a PVS14 behind my CompML3 and ran it perfectly fine, didn't have any flaring or wash-out.  My buddy tried it out with his H1 and had identical results.  I'm not sure if it applies to other optics like non-NV capable Eotechs, but the Aimpoints seem okay with NV at the lowest setting."

gundeals,3aie92,iconoclastman,2,Fri Jul 3 17:22:11 2015 UTC,How does Aimpoint compare to EOtech?
gundeals,3aie92,KingJak117,5,Sat Jun 20 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"And battery life, and durability, and reliability, and weight.  Eotech has a more ""tactical"" reticle, but it's not something you can't overcome with a little bit of training."
gundeals,3aie92,netchemica,2,Sat Jun 20 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Some people still don't like EOTechs because there was a battery contact issue with certain models a number of years back--I think it may have even affected versions used by the US military. That was fixed, but it left a bad taste in a lot of mouths, and Aimpoints have a reputation for being ridiculously rock-solid."
gundeals,3aie92,dongle556,2,Sat Jun 20 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"The Aimpoint has a MUCH better battery life, is quite a bit more durable and reliable, and the Aimpoint Micro line is considerably lighter than any eotech.  The Aimpoint micro can be blown up, run over, shot at, and dropped out of a helicopter, and still continue to function.  The AA batter line of Eotechs has been plagued with issues where the batteries lose contact during firing and turn off the optic.  You can also look on arfcom and see the number of people reporting problems with their optic, the ratio is considerably lower with the Aimpoints.  This is all overkill on the Aimpoint side when it comes to 99.99% of all users.  I doubt any one will ever put either optic to such an extreme to see the difference (other than battery life and reticle).  Both optics are good to go in my book, there's just no denying that Aimpoint, on paper, is the better optic."
gundeals,3aie92,netchemica,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:42:04 2015 UTC,The difference is in the reticle.   And the price.

If someone broke into my home and all I had was a baseball bat, that I use to play to sport of baseball, I'd use that for self defense also.  The term ""modern sporting rifle"" isn't there to imply that the 2nd amendment is optional, it's there because the overwhelming majority of AR15s and many other semi-auto rifles are used for sporting purposes.

I'll concede that is isn't a great deal, rather a decent value.  If you have a source of M855 for 30cpr, please share.  Hell, if you even have a source of new brass M193 for 30cpr, please share."
gundeals,3amlkm,linux203,15,Sun Jun 21 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"The beauty of m855 was its price. It was approx 30-33 for brass cased ammo. The same is true for m193.   Now we all want to feed our ARs for a reasonable price. With wolf golf at 30-33 CPR there is no reason to spend 40 on this super  inflated product when wolf gold generally shoots pretty damn well. There's a growing consensus that wolf gold is just Thai-made m193 anyway and is available from a number of retailers such as Aimsurplus.  Also, Dicks had m855 here in Columbus for 30 CPR yesterday, I know it's a bit of a cheat but in every point of view, this is not worth 45 or even 39 CPR. I wouldn't even say it's decent when PSA is 40 CPR with free shipping. Let's call it what it is please, it's retailers not wanting to return to pre-m855 scare prices.   Edit: Taiwan not Thai sorry."

I didn't see any sales for accessories so i jumped on them while i was there. They had a good sale on M&P 15 sport for $529 so i got it and got the accessories while i was there.  Coulda saved at least $20 today.

gundeals,3aej7e,diagela,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was genuinely curious. Are there any quality differences between forged and billet?"
gundeals,3aej7e,danegleesack,3,Fri Jun 19 15:37:41 2015 UTC,I've always heard forged is technically stronger. It is definitely lighter.
gundeals,3aej7e,wizang,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"This is what I've heard as well. The way it was explained to me, and I'd love if someone else could confirm or correct this, is that forged was essentially a piece of metal that was hammered out then finished with a CNC, but billet was metal poured into a mold then finished with a CNC. The difference is that when you pound out a piece of metal it's stronger than had it been a liquid then poured into a mold. In very rare cases, of low quality billet you could have an air bubble get trapped in the metal which would be bad. That's why billet are usually thicker in certain areas. At least that's what the guy behind the counter at the LGS said. Billet is also cheaper to make but made in smaller quantity so it ends up costing more by the time it reaches the consumer."
gundeals,3aej7e,Deceased_Puppy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"Are there any quality differences between forged and billet?   in general, probably not (though I have not seen any statistically significant analysis, so I could be wrong)."

I can say I've never had a problem with it and i've never had it jam once and have shot it hundreds of times. The only problem I ever had with it was the mags were hard to insert into the gun but thats always like that with a polymer mag, but once i sit down and used a chisel and re-inserted the mag over and over i've never had a problem since. I think this gun gets a bad rap because its a century, plus I've saw many people convert them and move up the trigger and change the mag wall to make it just like a siaga clone.

The subreddit is designated for deals, not requests. Slickguns.com wouldn't be successful if it was filled with requests for deals.   Should be make a /r/askgundeals? You could, but it would get no traffic, since people like to see deals, not a bunch of requests. Hence people will still make requests on /r/gundeals.   I vote just straight up ban requests from /r/gundeals. Use the search function to do your research. If you can't find anything on search, it's probably because there ain't deals on them."

gundeals,3a6f2r,stanleyfarnsworth,13,Wed Jun 17 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't buy a complete AR as a ""Starter AR"" being as you are going to be hit with an 11% excise tax for a complete gun. The upper and lower are only held in place with 2 pins , so assembly is easy in that regard. By splitting your purchase to a complete upper , complete lower, and then optics, you're better able to customize your gun without needing any tooling. And you're not stuck with a gun like everyone else. go to www.arpartsfinder.com and see what you can get a complete lower for , mine range from 160-400+ depending on the trigger/coupon you use. But on the low side say 160. I've seen uppers from the mid 250 range (without BCG or charging handle)  or around 300 with the BCG and charging handle. Even on the low end you can get a more custom job cheaper that I know you'd be happier with.   TL:DR- Buy upper and lower seperate, save on taxes, splurge on BCG (i didn't really go into that but I wanted to add that part)"

gundeals,3a6f2r,ExpatJundi,5,Thu Jun 18 06:33:49 2015 UTC,I fell for this gimmick back in 2005. They suck. I tried putting the upper on a Colt M4 lower. It never really fit exactly right and would never fire on burst (with the correct BCG).  Buy it if you think it's cool but imo they're garbage.
gundeals,3a6f2r,diagela,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"shipping is $9.99. looks like it comes with a total of four magazines. One 30-rnd comes with the rifle, and then there is a free three mag pack, containing one each 42-rnd, 30-rnd, and 20-rnd mags."

All you have to do is call up Remington and say it's losing zero, and ask them to replace it."

gundeals,3a6f2r,DJWikipedia,4,Wed Jun 17 17:57:01 2015 UTC,IMO They should be 400 or under. You can do way better for 500. At the very least you could get a nice used gun for that much.

gundeals,3a6f2r,1337BaldEagle,2,Wed Jun 17 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"Their QC for me personally.  I had to RMA a XM15.  I had a chamber that was not reamed properly.  It took 3 times shipping the rifle back to get it right, and on the last time I got the lower receiver back scratched to FUCK.  I wont buy a single rifle from them or Remington again (they are now owned by Remington).  The other reason is that this has really shitty components plus it's a plastic lower, no assist or dust cover and you can't just put one on you have to buy a new upper and lower.  PLUS, if that is not enough, you can build a quality one for 450, 500.  If you really want one go with PSA.  They got good deals frequently with fully ""mil spec ish"" rifles.  This one does not even come close."
gundeals,3a6f2r,doitforjimmy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:25:24 2015 UTC,What the other guys said.  You can get a more quality rifle for cheaper if you're willing to put in a little work to assemble it.

There is more than enough muzzle velocity at 200m to stop someone very dead.  Plenty accurate to shoot that far too.  If you are doing a pistol/sbr build, the whole point is to have it be short.  Have your 16in or 20in barrel for max muzzle velocity. This build is to be compact. Make it small."
gundeals,3a6m98,savedbyscience21,3,Thu Jun 18 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Ballistics by the in shows even a 7.5"" barrel is still generating serious ft lbs of energy.

gundeals,3a6m98,judsonm123,3,Thu Jun 18 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The issue with a 7.5"" barrel isn't the kinetic energy of the projectile, but rather issues with reliable bullet expansion. This is really a non-issue though since you can get excellent terminal ballistics with proper round choice. Obviously you're not going to want to shoot 77 grain ball in a defensive situation, but there are plenty of ballistic tipped bullets like the Barnes TSX that will reliably expand at any range you would care to engage at with a CQB weapon."

gundeals,39uy7l,linkspec,6,Mon Jun 15 00:39:33 2015 UTC,I ordered a wood Wingmaster. I will post pictures when it arrives. This is my first shotgun so I'm pretty excited.  Edit: I just got it from my lgs about 2 hours ago. This is the first time I've ever fired a shotgun and I love it! The recoil wasn't very bad and the accuracy(with birdshot at 75 feet) was great. The stock is knocked up and worn but I think it adds character. The barrel and receiver have some blemishes but again character. It has a 4+1 capacity which I'm probably gonna upgrade. I love hearing that baby pump.  Anyway here's a photo of it.  Bonus here's the target after 5 shots.
gundeals,39uy7l,KingJak117,6,Mon Jun 15 00:43:01 2015 UTC,I ordered one of the sig p229 pistols Mark had listed and then got a call saying that deal fell through :'(
gundeals,39uy7l,taiguy,5,Mon Jun 15 01:38:04 2015 UTC,Me too.  Had two 229's on order.  Too good to be true I guess

gundeals,39uy7l,noscarstoshow,7,Mon Jun 15 02:33:06 2015 UTC,It says it's $229 now!

gundeals,39uy7l,two_xjs,3,Mon Jun 15 02:55:18 2015 UTC,I prefer the Omnifox Wood program.  $75 bucks.
gundeals,39uy7l,Omnifox,4,Mon Jun 15 03:56:14 2015 UTC,"If you are refinishing just the wood, sure.  Remington Steal is exactly the opposite....it puts a new finish on the metal, redesign the trigger group, and changes the ejector if it isn't 3"" type.  It throws the furniture you had, and outs poly stock and fore end on."

gundeals,39uy7l,ImTheHungriest,10,Mon Jun 15 02:41:12 2015 UTC,I organized a group buy.
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:23:08 2015 UTC,Did you get a discount from the supplier for that?  What's the benefit of that system?
gundeals,39uy7l,Akris85,5,Mon Jun 15 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, $165 each in quantities of 10."
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,0,Mon Jun 15 23:47:30 2015 UTC,"The question raised by the group buys described above is whether the coordinating member is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms as defined by the GCA, and is therefore required to have a FFL. ATF has previously determined that certain firearms ""brokering” activities require a FFL. For example, if an individual sends orders to a manufacturer in his orher own capacity, is billed by the manufacturer for the firearms, and in turn,bills or otherwise collects payment and profits from the individual purchasers,that person would be engaged in the business of dealing in firearms and must be properly licensed. This is the case even though the person does not actually receive, possess, transport or ship some or all of the firearms. On the other hand,if the individual’s only role in the transaction is to advertise the availability of firearms and forward all of the orders to the manufacturer, a license would not be required.    Also see: https://www.atf.gov/file/5046/download   Individuals who engage in the business of brokering firearms by buying firearms from a manufacturer, selling those firearms to a licensed third person, and then arranging with the manufacturer to have the firearms dropped shipped to the purchaser, are required to obtain a Federal firearms license."
gundeals,39uy7l,hivbus,4,Mon Jun 15 23:50:25 2015 UTC,This is in perfect alignment with what I am doing.  I would need to resell them to have an issue.   I appreciate your concern but I am in no way in violation of your citation as I do not meet all the criteria.
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,0,Mon Jun 15 23:43:24 2015 UTC,You're brokering. You collected payments. Tell yourself what you want though.
gundeals,39uy7l,hivbus,4,Mon Jun 15 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"I absolutely am brokering, however brokering alone is not against the law.  I would need to broker them for resale to violate the ATF reg. the two conditions must be met in order to be in violation of the law.  If we were to apply the standard of brokering as you assert here gun companies wouldn't be able to issue debt instruments which clearly they can."
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,4,Mon Jun 15 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, every time you buy a firearm online and ship it to your local FFL is a brokered transaction.  If brokering alone were illegal it would also be illegal to buy from anywhere but your LGS.  Again, it is legal today because you are not buying (or brokering) for resale."
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,-3,Mon Jun 15 23:57:31 2015 UTC,I just emailed the Firearms Industry Programs Branch to ask for clarification on brokering and how it might apply to a group buy of firearms. I'll let you know if they ever reply.
gundeals,39uy7l,hivbus,4,Tue Jun 16 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"No matter, I'm going to turn myself in for it.  I dont even meet the definition for brokering either as I would need to be compensated for the negotiation in order to meet the legal definition for brokering so I don't even meet the first condition."
gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,4,Tue Jun 16 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"Based on the exact scenario described within your email, the individual organizing the ""group"" buy would not be required to possess a Federal Firearms License (FFL).  Note:  the scenario below describes an one time group buy ""brokered"" by one individual.  Thank you.  I trust this response has been helpful.   Now I need to ask if an FFL is required if this is a regular thing for someone."

gundeals,39uy7l,R_Shackleford,-1,Mon Jun 15 23:38:49 2015 UTC,Did you collect payment from all of the participants and pay Summit directly?
gundeals,39uy7l,hivbus,2,Mon Jun 15 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"Who throws money around is irrelevant to the situation. The FFL handled shipment receipt and ownership transfer.

I would run afoul of the ATF regs if I both took possession and transferred ownership in addition to gaining some kind of personal benefit through that direct transaction.  I'm miles clear of the definition of business that the IRS could use so I have both bases covered.  Furthermore it can't be construed as a straw purchase because I'm not filling out 4473's therefore I can not purger 11a."

I picked them up last Thursday from the pawn shop he uses in Grain Valley for local FFL transfers while on my way to KCMO.  Easy-peasy, saved on shipping, and the guy at Summit Pawn only charged me $60.00 total to transfer the four shotguns.  Not in too bad a shape at all, little dings and wear, some surface pitting, but the actions are still tight and positive.  I'll post pics when I get back home this week.  But...now I want ten more, dammit!  Mark said that he's still waiting to see if his bid for the additional  shotguns was accepted, said he should know pretty soon and to watch the website.  I am probably going to do the Wilson Combat thing with a few of them if I can get ten more, I am going to give some of them away as gifts to family members, want everything nice and shiny."

That ""very specific' meaning of ""rust"" depends very much on the context as does ""degradation."" That is great you mention that because it may help your stupid ass understand. This isn't /r/askscience and it is reasonable to assume you're not chemists or, even if you were, the person that first mentioned it wasn't referring to iron +3 oxide. Lots of people use rust, tarnish, and corrosion as synonyms. Why not? They all have increased oxidation states in common. You focus on the difference between brass and iron, why? Does the iron +3 make the rust? You can get iron +3 by oxidation with oxidizers other than oxygen. Hell, your stupid ass probably thinks oxygen is the only thing that can oxidize stuff. It is in the name after all, right? Anyway, the iron vs brass wasn't the key meaning in OP's statement. The degradation connotation was and you stupid shits got it from the context just fine. You're just stupid assholes. You know what is funny? A chemist would know that even degradation is specific to certain contexts. Sometimes they want corrosion or oxidation. The battery in your cell phone for example wouldn't work without it. Your battery suffers degradation when you can't oxidize and/or reduce its components easily enough. Anyway, go fuck yourself."

gundeals,39lt6n,Infernal2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:47:37 2015 UTC,I bought the sport model since the price was similar to the price a friend of mine spent on his smith and wesson m&p sport but the del-ton had forward assist and a dust cover which the s&w didn't.  His gun ran and is still running flawlessly. Mine as stated earlier is long gone.  I can't speak on if it was an isolated case and I received a lemon or if the companies quality control is sub par but I personally will never buy any products from them in the future. Either way good luck on your purchase and do yourself a favor and browse around since there seems to be a lot of companies putting out high quality ARs for very good prices.

gundeals,39kyad,stanleyfarnsworth,2,Fri Jun 12 17:05:10 2015 UTC,My wife was kinda enough to pick up the Diamondhead Polymer Diamond Integrated Sighting System w/ NiteBrite for our anniversary today. I haven't heard anything terrible about them and I'd like to see how they operate in the dark.   Last set I bought were the MagPul polymer set and they work fine. But to be honest I plan on adding optics so I just need them in case something goes wrong with the optic.   Troy is nice. Probably the standard in the BUIS game but I'm not sure the cash is wisely spent if you're going to add some form of optic on top of it.
gundeals,39kyad,Kowabunga_Dude,2,Fri Jun 12 17:11:35 2015 UTC,Yeah. I jumped on that $499 PSA kit with the vortex spitfire optic included.

gundeals,39fmm9,HoberShort,3,Thu Jun 11 19:41:10 2015 UTC,The grips might look nicer but they are very slippery.  G10 is the way to go if you are actually going to shoot one of these.  And the hammer is worth maybe $40. Cheapest to get a trade in and drop in a D spring kit.
gundeals,39fmm9,lil_bunni_fufu,2,Thu Jun 11 13:59:23 2015 UTC,I bought a set of walnut grips for my 92A1 and honestly prefer the plastic ones that came with the gun.  I have smaller hands though and the walnut ones I bought are definitely larger than the plastics.

gundeals,39fmm9,RugerRedhawk,4,Thu Jun 11 14:59:24 2015 UTC,My police trade in 92s has a fantastic single action trigger.
gundeals,39fmm9,wizang,2,Thu Jun 11 16:28:07 2015 UTC,The whole action was like butter for me.  The factory trigger had a little over travel but was very consistent and smooth before I replaced it with a Wilson Combat short reach trigger.  The Wilson cured the over travel.

gundeals,39fmm9,Scioso,8,Thu Jun 11 18:14:32 2015 UTC,At first I thought my zaptal carry practice was going to make the endeavor tolerable. Concentrating hard I managed to begin to expel the service pistol from my intestines. My intense concentration turned to horror however when I saw the barrel was coming out first. When I reached the grip it was the seesaw of hell; grip on one end and a fully cocked hammer on the other. The end... Well I won't wound you like my anus but let's just say I'm glad to still be alive.
gundeals,39fmm9,livin4donuts,6,Thu Jun 11 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"You know, some people feel able to CCW with a full-size 1911, but for Colon Carry, I much prefer the Commander style."

gundeals,39fmm9,TowerTrash,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"Pooping is such a great feeling. I loved being able to experience the feeling of releasing a dump whenever I please.   I started out with beads to simulate the release of my turds. Then I graduated to dildos, then larger dildos (like these beautiful ladies) Eventully I was shitting out my fist a couple times a day.   There came a point where my toys weren't doing it for me anymore. I needed bigger turds. So I started with 2 liters and half gallons of Orange Juice.  That kept me satisfied for a few weeks but it still wasn't enough.   I tried wood, PVC pipe & my sister's chihuahua but the good feelings didn't last long anymore.   Things finally hit the fan when I was driving home when I saw a muffler exhaust on the side of the interstate. I  knew this was it. If this didn't satisfy me; nothing would.    Just the thought of shitting out a muffler got my cock so hard. Have you ever jerked off while shitting? My asshole and cock was pulsing just imagining it. Holy fuck, i couldn't wait, seriously.   I grabbed the muffler and threw it into my bed of my pickup truck, I laid down so the cars couldn't see me and started to insert the muffler in my anus. Yes! This was going to be the feeling I was looking for, I just knew it. I was ready to shit out my muffler but there was a problem.  There's no way I could shit it out laying down, I'd have to get on all fours. There was no way I could drive home with this thing 1/4 way sticking out of my ass. It just wasn't happening. I'd go into the woods but I honestly wasn't sure if be able to hop the little wall. I'd probably get the muffler caught and I'd be some middle aged dude hanging from the concrete wall by the butthole. How embarrassing!  Anyway I decided I made a mistake, so I'd just have to shit this out on all fours in the bed of my pickup as quickly as possible. Shit it out, and get the fuck out before the cops show up. God knows some stuck up asshole is always out there to ruin the fun.   I nervously flip back on my hands and start pushing. UGH FUCK YES UGHHHH THIS IS THE BEST POOP EVER honk honk UGGGGGHHHHHHH YEAAAH hooonk YESSSSSSSSS honk RIPS  Oh fuck. The muffler got caught on something and now I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding in the back of my truck with a muffler partly in my ass. honk honk I'm feeling lightheaded. sirens.   I pass out as the police arrive on scene and wake up 4 days later in the hospital. I lost a fuck ton of blood, they had to surgically remove pieces of muffler from me. My asshole was ripped beyond repair. The doctors said my poops would just slide out of me for the rest of my life. I'd have to wear a diaper and my poops wouldn't be satisfying anymore, which was the biggest let down. This all started because I liked the feeling of pooping and now I don't even get that anymore. I wanted it all though and I couldn't have it. My anus was punished but looking back I'm lucky I wasn't punished legally for having my asshole on display during rush hour on I-90.   So my message to these girls would be protect your anus like you would protect your first born child.   Tl;dr enjoyed pooping, ruined anus with a muffler. Life lessons and whatnot."

gundeals,39fmm9,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"Looks like a permanent front sight like the classic 92fs. So if you want to add night sights or fiber optics, you or your gunsmith would need to knock the sights off, cut a dovetail into the slide, and then add in a 92A1 sight. Alternatively, they can drill out the sight and add in a tritium or fiber optic insert. Or you can get them to colorfill in the white dots with something that glows in the dark.   The 92A1 has sights that can be replaced normally."
gundeals,39fmm9,impreza_GC8,-5,Fri Jun 12 14:43:28 2015 UTC,Any respectable pistol design for less than $500 is a good deal but it is my opinion that the mammoth double action trigger pull and the silly ergonomics on the slide mounted safety make it a garbage pistol compared to other full-size pistols.  Thats just my opinion.  Take it or leave it.
gundeals,39fmm9,PGT_FTW,5,Thu Jun 11 19:22:43 2015 UTC,a decockoer-only 92G is only a couple bucks more and a $5 D-spring fixes the DA pull.

If you can wait  until the end of summer, the M9A3 will be released and it can be converted from FS to G action (and back) using an optional kit.  I bought a 90-Two and converted it to G action and the M9A3 uses a similar design in the slide."
gundeals,39fmm9,LilFuniAZNBoi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you can throw on the Wilson Combat low profile slim safety. Its a left side only safety which makes it a little bit more slim. I really don't even use the safety on my 92FS, I just use it to decock and put it back onto red again."
gundeals,39fmm9,newsigowner,4,Fri Jun 12 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"Leave it.   That's crap.  The 92FS is totally solid and a joy to shoot.  As an aside, I've never seen an awesome pistol such as this polarize so completely.  It shouldn't even be a debate."

There may only be two ""mystery vendors"" out at the moment, but I'm sure with the popularity, more will come."

gundeals,39ayk7,R_B_Kazenzakis,2,Thu Jun 11 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I still won't buy new Ruger shit, and I was only 4 when the AWB was passed. I dont care that Bill Ruger is dead, his company and family can kiss my white ass. A gun company supporting a ban because it caters to Fudds is bullshit, regardless of what year it happened. I bought my blackhawk used(they're sexy and awesome guns, I can't lie), Ruger won't see a dime from me directly.  I only take solace in the fact Bill is spinning in his grave due to his company selling ARs and minis with 30rd mags."

gundeals,39ayk7,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:47:19 2015 UTC,"I dont own a glock or S&W. I do buy wolf and tulammo, but why shouldnt I? I'm not Ukrainian, the Russian government has never done anything to me or anyone I know.  And are wolf and tulammo owned by the Russian government, or are they just made in the same factories as the ammo for the Russian military?"
gundeals,39ayk7,Tier_1_Masturbator,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not Ukrainian, the Russian government has never done anything to me or anyone I know.   Ruger has never done anything to you or anyone you know, either.   And are wolf and tulammo owned by the Russian government, or are they just made in the same factories as the ammo for the Russian military?   Made in government arsenals, but they are contractors themselves.  Like how Federal uses the Lake City plant to make ammo for civilian use.  It's accurate to call them private companies.  It's also inaccurate to pretend that they are not effectively arms of the Russian MIC."
gundeals,39ayk7,R_B_Kazenzakis,2,Thu Jun 11 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"Ruger helped in hurting the entire industry for ten years, in an unknown amount that could easily be in the billions of dollars across the board. The AWB put some companies out of buisness overnight, and left people without jobs and income. But one could also argue the AWB gave rise in popularity to sub-compacts, so maybe it balances out, I honestly don't know.  My problem with Ruger is that they openly took a stand against their own customers; one by supporting the AWB and two by not selling any mags over 5rds to civilians because they felt civies couldn't be trusted.  For me to stop buying wolf or tulammo, they would have to stop selling ammo by the case and claim civilians don't need that much ammo. Or Russia invade America; in which case I would gladly give them all thier ammo back, at supersonic speeds."

However,  this kit does come with the carrier and 5 Troy mags.  That makes it certainly more tolerable, if you are dead set on getting one of these stocks."
gundeals,39ayk7,AFuddyDuddy,7,Wed Jun 10 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"Not only is the Troy PDW stock over priced, but its not even the best PDW stock currently on the market."

gundeals,39ayk7,fucema,7,Wed Jun 10 16:19:29 2015 UTC,I dislike the proprietary bolt carrier.  Check out the MVB Arc.
gundeals,39ayk7,atomiccheesegod,7,Wed Jun 10 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"The MVB ARC stock, it can use any milspec bolt and is even piston compatiable"
gundeals,39ayk7,Tlr32,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:46 2015 UTC,What stock is better?  Are you going to say the NEA stock is better?
gundeals,39ayk7,atomiccheesegod,4,Wed Jun 10 16:22:32 2015 UTC,No. The best PDW stock for the money is the MVB ARC stock. It doesnt use a proprietary BCG and can be used with different calibers  and even piston systems.
gundeals,39ayk7,Theta_Zero,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"The best PDW stock for the money   The only issue I have with the ARC is that for not using a propriatary bolt, it costs $100 more than the NEA version and DOES NOT come with a bolt at all.  It's definitely my favorite of the three major offerings too, but I'd hardly call it the ""best stock for the money"" unless you constantly change uppers."

I shot 500 rounds through mine the first day I took it out to shoot it, granted I had the Sig brace on it. They are so much damn fun to shoot, and the faster you shoot the more fun it is. They're also pretty accurate when you're taking your time with the shots. Field stripping is very easy, too. Also, a lot of people bitch about the ambidextrous safety in the way, but CZ offers a very cheap right side safety delete on their website. The safety delete is a breeze to install, you just field strip the gun, and then set the safety to fire position. On the right side of the safety if you look at the bottom there is an allen screw holding it in, you unscrew that, then put the safety delete on, screw it in and you're done. I love the hell out of my Scorpion, it delivers so much more than what I expected, and I expected a lot out of it."

When I applied the coupon it showed the discount in the cart, but not in the total. When I pressed REFRESH QUANTITIES it then showed the right total so I thought it was fine. Then I went through PayPal and PayPal said the right price too, until after I checked out.  Weird...  But thanks a bunch for the correction! Looking forward to my new setup!"
gundeals,3969kq,ZeeCatnip,2,Wed Jun 10 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty nice.  Planning on getting my feet wet with IDPA next week or the following and just purchased a holster.  Wish I could afford to try this set up out :(    Not to knock your pricing(they all to seem to be this amount across the board), but why are they all so expensive?    I would easily be willing to drop near 100 or so on something like this.  But near $200 just seems excessive and a bit pricey for me."
gundeals,3969kq,choppers_19,3,Tue Jun 9 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"I get this question a lot. Aside from materials cost, which is not exactly cheap when you buy top of the line hardware, it takes a while to make a holster. The firearm mold alone can sometimes take 1-2 days, depending on the model and attachments. Then you have to make the holster. There's also our lifetime warranty, that covers anything and everything, including shipping which is $12 initially for the package, and $6.50 anyTime we have to ship something through the warranty. Also, the belts that come with the package are $79 alone, which is a decent chunk. Add in the holster at $50-ish and the three mag carriers at $24/piece.   If you can find a similar package for $100 then let me know, I may consider a price drop!"

I called you good folks at Dara about 4 weeks ago and asked about the possibility of having a owb holster made for an IWI Baby Desert Eagle in 9mm. Whoever I talked to said they'd give me a call back if anything could be worked out, but she wasn't too optimistic sounding. I never did hear back back though, and I'm still wondering! Any chance that can be done in a rig like this for me?"

I love my 10mm Dan Wesson Sportsman with Underwood ammo for innawoods carry, but unless you reload, I wouldn't suggest 10mm as a caliber for your first pistol purchase.

gundeals,3934xt,Theta_Zero,2,Tue Jun 9 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.  if I could have dropped the money on a pretty much fully kitted out KIDD 10/22 right off the bat, I certainly would have done so.    Because I couldn't, I bought a cheap 10/22 and am modifying and upgrading it myself.  The barrel would probably drop in price on the used market because it has rounds through it, but that 2 stage trigger kit could be sold for probably $15 shy of the original price pretty easily.    Kidd parts are some of the best 10/22 parts that are commonly available and, if you're into rimfire target or match shooting, they're well worth the price.    That being said, I don't mind spending $900 on a 10/22 spread out over a few years, but if I'm dropping $900 on a rifle right now, it's sure as hell going to be a higher caliber than 22lr."

They do stuff like bed and pillar, custom barrels (liljas/etc.) and stocks, bench rest setups, scopes, etc.  They also post their results so you can see what sort of accuracy they're getting, so you can see if it's something you're interested in.  The CZ 452s/455s are pretty good 'bang for the buck' bolt action rimfires."

I was curious about the accuracy of the best factory-produced, off-the-shelf rifle with standard factory-produced ammunition in calibres that are generally available, over standard open sights to a range of about 600 metres. And if the accuracy was reliable by an averagely good sharpshooter (me).  I have only trained with military assault weapons (R1) which is a terrific compromise for accuracy.

The problem with the dedicated sites is that you get tangled-up in different schools of thought and the splitting of semantic hairs. The loading of your own ammo, how many grains, etc. The arguments are all rational, but they are generally above my level of expertise. I fear that I may be identified as a wannabe.   For example: Say you had carte blanche for a Father’s Day gift and you decided on an accurate rifle (expense no object and you are under time pressure).

In that case you might run into twist rate/stabilization issues with a standard 308 barrel and a ballistic arc like a rainbow.

The coating itself handles 2000fps just fine (we tested on a 300 win mag just to see what would happen) and the lead is a harder alloy that holds up to the rpms of supersonic.  That being said, the projectile itself is designed for subsonic applications and performs best balistically under the speed of sound."

gundeals,38ot43,janglybones,2,Sat Jun 6 09:50:25 2015 UTC,So you can't get the slide folding adaptor separately? The model that comes with the brace and adaptor is $1800ish in most places. I just want something to put an extra brace I have lying around before I SBR it and not have to pay a $500+ difference.

gundeals,38ec72,THE_BIG_SITT,8,Wed Jun 3 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"Go with AIM Surplus. I use their BCG and so far it hasn't failed me. By no means is it as good as some other companies, but they are well machined, nicely coated, and work well."
gundeals,38ec72,dudas91,5,Wed Jun 3 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"AIM Surplus! By far the best.   Get the EXO Nib with the Black Nitride Bolt... By far the best BCG I have ever used that is anywhere near the price! http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=XAIMBCGX  If you want the whole setup to be EXO (FailZero) then I would get the Toolcraft carrier from Wcarmory! http://www.wcarmory.com/toolcraft-bcg-223-5-56-bolt-carrier-group-mpi-ni-bo-t-c-engraved.htm  I own both and have run through MANY more, those are the 2 that have entirely stood out through thousands of rounds 223/5.56/300B  The only BCG that comes close to either of those is My reliabolt (complete) from sharps and if I could go back in time I would have just bought more of either of those carriers/bolts!  Anybody on here recommending AIM BCG's has done their research!"
gundeals,38ec72,iamawinneriam,4,Thu Jun 4 03:27:00 2015 UTC,"Their BCG-X will rock your socks off. Bought one at their list price and could not be happier. As I said earlier in this thread:  ""the bolt carrier is NiB while the gas key and bolt are Nitride coated. NiB is for reducing friction while the Nitride is for durability. This combination makes a lot of sense to me."""
gundeals,38ec72,x5060,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"Not at all, That is a perfectly reasonable question!  Testing AR parts and AR Uppers is a part of my job, I end up shooting so much that I dont even enjoy shooting anymore unless it is something totally weird/new :o   I base this on failure from extended testing under various conditions and ease of cleaning after I put the product through whatever torture test is deemed necessary to make sure the new parts are worth keeping around/buying more.  A LOT of the NiB bcg's are nice for a while and that is all they have to offer. In all reality it is more of a testament to how much I like FailZero (uctcoatings) since that is the company that has the patent on EXONiB than anything about AIM directly.  On the AIM BCG I actually love that the bolt/key is Black Nitride and the Carrier is EXO and at that price point it is very hard to beat in my experience.   Another great BCG is the toolcraft offerings but I really like the combo (EXO/Nitride) in my experience.  I have to clean/lube BCG's about once a week. I have amassed a pile of about 20 ""testing"" BCG's that I clean all at once so the AIM has found a special place in my heart as time has gone on.  If you are springing for phosphate I have not seen it matter that much (As long as it is staked properly and there is chrome lining) but when you get into the land of NiB there are a few gems out there that shine much brighter than the rest!"
gundeals,38ec72,iamawinneriam,3,Sat Jun 6 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"Aim surplus is usually the best for BCGs, I have found.   I really like the one they have for $110 right now as the bolt carrier is NiB while the gas key and bolt are Nitride coated. NiB is for reducing friction while the nitride is for durability. This combination makes a lot of sense to me.  ETA: I just looked it up and the all NiB BCG is 95$ while the BCG-X is 110$. I would say the extra 15$ is worth it, but that's just my opinion."

There is a world of difference from cheap/budget Nib and well done NiB or EXO, NP3, Black Nitride...   You will never regret having a better BCG; Especially when you can get some of the best for ~$120 to your door!"
gundeals,38ec72,iamawinneriam,2,Wed Jun 3 18:49:41 2015 UTC,Aim has free shipping on their BCGs to the continental US.  So the BCG-X is 109.95 to your door if you're in the Lower 48.

gundeals,38ec72,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Wed Jun 3 18:47:47 2015 UTC,What color is it? If it's black it may be nitride or one of a half dozen different coatings. If it is shiny like chrome it is probably NiB. If it is a gold color then it's probably a titanium nitride coating.  Those are just guesses though.

gundeals,38ec72,GeistGun,2,Thu Jun 4 04:57:51 2015 UTC,"At the time that I purchased they would not refund the shipping and I would have had to charge to have it shipped back... I get paid salary and it wasnt worth the hassle to explain that money was lost for no reason. Instead I could just say that I got parts that didnt stand up to testing (and they didnt)   Perhaps their QC is better nowadays but AIM is my go-to for EXO NiB and Black Phoshphate BCG's so it is hard to recommend any other place outside of wcarmory because they sell Toolcraft BCG's cheaper than I can buy WHSE direct from Toolcraft!  I can understand the disbelief in my initial statement, I avoid mentioning my job generally because everybody on the internet is a doctor/lawyer/physicist but I get the fun of testing WAY more stuff than I can personally afford! and my 3 personal ar's have (1 AIM BCG EXO/Nitride, 1 TOOLCRAFT and 1 piston) I go back and forth constantly on which of the 2 I prefer...

gundeals,386iqu,r870,5,Tue Jun 2 05:08:12 2015 UTC,What's it going to cost me to finish?
gundeals,386iqu,whubbard,11,Tue Jun 2 05:12:05 2015 UTC,"The only pieces it needs are the barrel, receiver repair section, and shroud. If you buy them barrel is ~$110, repair sections are ~$75, and shroud can be had for ~$35. If you have the tools (mill, lathe, hydraulic press) you can make these yourself.  Besides the cost it will also require a significant amount of time to modify the bolt, receiver, and FCG to semi-auto. Mill is the easiest way to do this, but it can be done with cheaper tools (although a welder will be necessary).  Not a lot money-wise, but a good bit of sweat equity and tooling.  Edit: friendly reminder that it will need a 16"" barrel since it has the stock, unless you want to go NFA route. the 43/52 kits usually go for $150+, and generally only come with 1 magazine though so this is a good deal if you were looking for one anyways. The magazines can be $15-20 just by themselves, so if you already have a PPS there's $60 of magazines just with the kit."

gundeals,37nucx,ReverendDuckworth,3,Fri May 29 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"True, but the notion that we as consumers need to pay the price of said testing and design is just silly   So who is supposed to pay for R&D? If it isn't the government it is the consumer."
gundeals,37nucx,JD__,-1,Sat May 30 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"Since when does the government assist in the development of consumer level products? I don't understand your argument here at all.   If McDonalds makes a new cheeseburger I don't expect the other food to increase in price. If Ruger makes a new rifle I don't expect the price of Mark III's to go up.   Companies develop products to make money, they assume that development and testing cost as a risk. If you as a consumer would look at that subgun and refuse to pay the price, guess what? The price would come down. That's my point, I'm not paying inflated prices because it's a SIG. There isn't  $1600 worth of plastic and steel here. If this was $900 they'd be back ordered already."
gundeals,37nucx,ReverendDuckworth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:30:25 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but I don't understand your argument. I was saying the money for R&D comes from two places. The government or the consumer. Where else is the money supposed to come from? Obviously Sig didn't get a government grant to develop the MPX so the cost of R&D is going to be included in the price to consumers.   If Ruger makes a new rifle I don't expect the price of Mark III's to go up.   Huh? Sig developed a new rifle and decided on a price. What does this have to do with their other rifles?    There isn't $1600 worth of plastic and steel here.   Well the price was $1289.99 and the cost of a product isn't the sum of materials used. The money to pay the engineers and to pay for all the testing is going to be reflected in the consumer cost of the product.
gundeals,37nucx,JD__,-1,Tue Jun 2 12:12:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really care to argue anymore,   Different strokes for different folks. I won't be paying the price they want, not without a serious reality check."
gundeals,37nucx,ReverendDuckworth,4,Tue Jun 2 23:20:57 2015 UTC,Those are all blowback operated.
gundeals,37nucx,JD__,3,Wed Jun 3 02:04:19 2015 UTC,I meant comparable as in the cycling operation. As in not pure blowback. The MP5 is roller delayed blowback and the MPX is gas operated. They pretty much stand alone among tons of blowback sub machine gun designs.
gundeals,37nucx,JD__,1 point,Fri May 29 12:04:13 2015 UTC,You just said the only thing comparable is an MP5 which is totally untrue.    It is true.  Blowback 9mm is not rare.  Finding something better is.  The only other thing is the MP5.  You should have just pointed him at a MAC-10 clone if you're just going off 9mm not-handguns
gundeals,37nucx,C-C-X-V-I,4,Fri May 29 15:37:55 2015 UTC,Why does this gun cost $1300 other than kinda looking like an mp5?
gundeals,37nucx,wizang,17,Fri May 29 19:57:55 2015 UTC,Research and development. A reliable gas operated 9mm carbine is not an easy thing to accomplish. 99% of 9mm carbines are blow back or roller locked.
gundeals,37nucx,JD__,4,Fri May 29 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, I had no idea it was gas operated."
gundeals,37nucx,wizang,4,Sat May 30 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are really neat guns. Gas operated are much smoother and have less recoil."

gundeals,37nucx,stabsthedrama,3,Fri May 29 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"No. My point is this is a new weapons system that took loads of money for R&D, so they have to price it to recover that. The AK being 70 years old has had time for the R&D to come and go and the plans are so well known they are made in huts in the middle of the desert.

gundeals,37o7gc,WillQuantrill,1 point,Sat May 30 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"First NiB bcg I bought from them, barely staked, and now the key is slightly loose. It was advertised as mil spec, but if it was, the permatex gasket sealant and a proper staking should keep it rock sold for thousands and thousands of rounds... I doubt they used the sealant and the staking was not proper. 400 rounds later and I'm already going to have to buy another set of fasteners and a staking tool to do it properly.  You've been warned."
gundeals,37o7gc,jturgeon228,1 point,Sat May 30 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"In the rare case of a manufacturing defect or issue like that, I'm sure they would be happy to repair or replace it for you.  Have you contacted them about it?  If you bought it through us, we would be happy to help as well."
gundeals,37o7gc,jturgeon228,1 point,Sat May 30 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"It was purchased directly from Ares, not through you, sorry I did not make that clear in the first place. At this point it is less inconvenient just to do it myself instead of contacting Ares. Last time I contacted them it took awhile to even hear back. Otherwise the bcg is functioning fine, even slightly loose it cycled. When the key is loose though, it only gets worse unless you correct it right away. And almost every bcg has staking that's way too weak, so buying the tool will actually be useful for the others I need to do."

gundeals,37o7gc,jturgeon228,-1,Sun May 31 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"The one from Ares does, which is the one I'm reviewing... I don't understand what's so hard to understand about this or so wrong about it. Bought Ares bcg -> gas key doesn't stay secure after only 400 rounds -> write about what happened. That's how customer reviews/feedback works. I'm giving feedback about a product being advertised letting people know it may not be all sunshine and roses at this low price.  All my other bcgs have light staking, that's what I said about my other ones. And I'm going to stake them fully and correctly while I'm buying the tool to fix this one from Ares. It's well known in the industry that many manufacturers have a tendency to stake rather lightly."

gundeals,37hrh2,metrogdor22,3,Wed May 27 19:30:07 2015 UTC,It's on the website:   The explosive can be detonated using a shock wave from an object moving greater than 2500 fps
gundeals,37hrh2,ZaneMasterX,2,Wed May 27 19:35:27 2015 UTC,More about speed than round size. For example a guy at my range was trying to set off Shockwave wth an AK. He figured that's a large enough round but he was shooting it out if a small pistol AK so it had less velocity and wouldn't set it off.
gundeals,37hrh2,metrogdor22,1 point,Wed May 27 21:01:13 2015 UTC,Do you mean smallest in diameter? It is actually the shock wave from the bullet that sets it off so velocity is more important.  Anything over 2500 fps will definitely set it off.

gundeals,37hrh2,bstunt619,1 point,Thu May 28 12:43:04 2015 UTC,What's the explosive compound?
gundeals,37hrh2,bstunt619,4,Wed May 27 19:46:56 2015 UTC,Ammonium Nitrate + Aluminum Powder aka Tannerite.
gundeals,37hrh2,Jugrnot,3,Wed May 27 21:35:37 2015 UTC,He means Ammonal. Tannerite is just the most popular brand name for exploding targets.
gundeals,37hrh2,Havokk,2,Thu May 28 00:09:54 2015 UTC,"Ammonal:       Ammonal is an explosive made up of ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder. Not to be confused with T-ammonal which contains trinitrotoluene as well to increase properties such as brisance.  The ammonium nitrate functions as an oxidizer and the aluminium as fuel. The use of the relatively cheap ammonium nitrate and aluminium makes it a replacement for pure TNT.  The mixture is affected by humidity because ammonium nitrate is highly hygroscopic. Ammonal's ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very oxygen balanced. Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due to the formation of tetramines. More oxygen balanced mixtures are not easily detonated, requiring a fairly substantial shock, though it remains more sensitive than trinitrotoluene and C-4.

There are a couple versions of the 10.5"" uppers that have different rails shown."
gundeals,37gm4x,fuzzyguns,2,Wed May 27 20:53:29 2015 UTC,Depends. Is it just a typical run of the mill bcg? I ask because I got a NiB one from Tactical Ambush for my 7.62 build for like $10 more than that website is charging
gundeals,37gm4x,ThatDamnClarkGable,2,Wed May 27 21:06:26 2015 UTC,It's a basic phosphate bcg.  If one didn't want our bcg they could just buy the upper and use a different bcg.  We do ship ours relatively quickly though.

gundeals,37gm4x,fuzzyguns,1 point,Thu May 28 06:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, NiB stands for nickel boron. IMHO they're worth the small premium over a phosphate bcg. They're much, much, much easier to clean all of the crap and gunk off of than a typical bcg. But either way, a 7.62 AR is fun as shit"
gundeals,37gm4x,ThatDamnClarkGable,2,Thu May 28 18:35:31 2015 UTC,Ok. Cuz I really wanna build one I just don't know where to find a lower to take 7.63x39 mags. Any way you can help me out in that?
gundeals,37gm4x,fuzzyguns,1 point,Thu May 28 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"Of course. Any AR lower will accept 7.62x39 mags. I'm currently running a palmetto state lower, but I'll be building a Mega Arms lower as soon as I get back to the U.S. Also, I'm running ASC magazines which run fine after a small modification (just take a dremel to the lip of the magazine and take a little material off)."
gundeals,37gm4x,disasterfilm,2,Thu May 28 18:41:20 2015 UTC,so any AR lower will accept a 5.56 or a 7.62 upper? sorry if that seems like a dumb question. i just started looking into building. Also are they a certain kind of mag? like i couldn't use a banana mag with one right?
gundeals,37gm4x,fuzzyguns,1 point,Thu May 28 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"No worries. Let me put it like this: the only parts in an AR chambered in 7.62 vs 5.56 are the barrel, bcg, and magazines. Any 5.56 upper and lower will work fine. I use ASC magazines, and they do offer high capacity magazines."

gundeals,37d020,ButtMuddBrooks,1 point,Tue May 26 22:18:34 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly it was $890 for the patriot brown.  They were a lot harder to find then, and the black were going for close to $1000 on GB.  With the LGS markup and the fact that it's colored, I think I did fine.  At that time LGS was selling the black for $780.  He has a standard markup on all his sales so I'm pretty sure Kel-Tec charges more for the colored versions.  LGS also has a ton of them now - black, tan, patriot brown, and tungsten."

gundeals,37d020,ButtMuddBrooks,1 point,Wed May 27 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"For me, without a doubt.  I travel between restricted states so a VEPR isn't an option.  In any case, I really enjoy it and it is a neat gun, but it's not your grandfathers shotgun.  I was between this and the UTAS as well, but chose this based on reviews and the size.  I've never fired a UTAS so I can't really speak for that."
gundeals,37d020,Dico21,1 point,Wed May 27 01:30:16 2015 UTC,The size is a killer for the UTAS. I was amazed at the difference when I saw it side by side with the KSG.  So yours has been reliable I assume?
gundeals,37d020,ButtMuddBrooks,1 point,Wed May 27 01:54:56 2015 UTC,I probably only have around 250 shells through it but I haven't had any issues.  I've cycled entire tubes multiple times with no jams. I have a vertical grip on it so not sure if that helps.
gundeals,37d020,Dico21,2,Wed May 27 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"A family friend bought one around June of last year from another user on Calguns for $1100 (damn CA's pricing). That user bought it brand new a few months prior. Together, we've shot maybe 1500 rounds through it. For the first 500 rounds or so, if we did not fully rack the slide or short racking it, then the rounds would not be chambered. It's very unforgiving comparing to every other pumps I've shot. I'm a new shooter for shotguns.    With that stated, I no longer have jams or loading problem after being familiarized with the KSG. We put a 6in extension barrel on it for shooting clays at the local range that has manual clay launcher. The extension gives it a little more reach for busting that second clay on a dual launch. Yes, the follow up shot is slow and is difficult unless you perfect your line up and racking motion every single times. I had to slow myself down and fully rack the slide, lining up, and then pull the trigger. I personally feel that the racking motion is too long, and it would be nice if it's to be shorten a little bit.  If it's cheap enough, then I would like to get one for myself. I think that it's not worth it for the price here in CA. In the past 5 months, i've seen a few listed from $850-1200. Though, it's always nice to have two fully loaded tubes for bedside comfort."

gundeals,3793a8,GeistGun,1 point,Tue May 26 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"I'm ignorant, lemme start there.   Most BCGs (PSA, AIM sports, etc) I see are: 8620 Steel Carrier 9310 Bolt ... And some part of it is 158 carpenter, not the whole thing.   Am I wrong? What's the advantage of it being 158c?  Is it really an issue that the shiny titanium one isn't 158c?"
gundeals,3793a8,hoodpaladin,3,Tue May 26 13:28:21 2015 UTC,"Milspec is 8620 carrier, 158 bolt. If its a 9310 bolt its not milspec. How important that is has been debated."
gundeals,3793a8,wizang,7,Tue May 26 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"I am a mechanical aerospace engineer, I remember in my study of material science and metallurgy that it is incredibly important. People will continuously state that the tensile strenth of 158c is the same as 9000 and 8000. But it is not tensile strength we are looking at. Its fatigue resistance.   Also: the carrier can be made from jelly beans for all I care it just acctuates the buffer and resets the trigger. The bolt is what endures the fatigues of locking unlocking slaamming a round into battery and extracting/ejecting...  The bolt should be 158c in my very humble opinion"
gundeals,3793a8,GeistGun,3,Tue May 26 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"And for the layperson, 158c is known to work and keep working for a long time. If people want to be the guinea pigs for an unproven material, that's their own prerogative. But unless it was much cheaper than a 158c bolt, there's no way I'd ever buy one. It seems that most out there are actually quite a bit more expensive, and they need to fire up the hype train to get people onboard."

gundeals,372wor,BishBoJangle,3,Sun May 24 12:45:22 2015 UTC,"Ive been wondering about these.  They come with the full auto sear, safety, and disconnect.    How much fire is that playing with?"
gundeals,372wor,two_xjs,6,Sun May 24 14:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, could someone explain how/why these have a FA sear? Don't those cost like $25k?"
gundeals,372wor,thunderstrut,4,Sun May 24 14:38:30 2015 UTC,they have the autosear because it's a legit colt m16 lower parts kit. it doesn't come with the lower (the registered part of the gun) so you'd have to illegally manufacture a lower with a 3rd pin to use it or buy a pre-86 machine gun lower which is what costs 25k. more info here.
gundeals,372wor,two_xjs,2,Sun May 24 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, so even though there is an autosear there is no way that this rifle can be turned into full auto without modifying a lower, right? I just bought this kit to do a retro AR-15 build and I want to make sure that there is no way that the finished product could be mistaken for a select fire weapon.   EDIT: I'm too pretty to go to jail."
gundeals,372wor,R_Shackleford,1 point,Sun May 24 18:21:26 2015 UTC,Correct. The lower would need to have a hole drilled above the safety and a little milling done inside to fit those particular parts.
gundeals,372wor,GeistGun,1 point,Sun May 24 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the autosear uses another pin, which normal semi auto lowers do not have."

gundeals,372wor,KodiakAnorak,3,Sun May 24 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Not even. You can run it completely fine with the M16 FCG as long as you don't drill that third hole and install the auto sear. There is a disconnector mod that you can do to prevent a double in case of an out of spec part but that isn't even required.

But it would work without.

gundeals,36zgx5,GeistGun,3,Sat May 23 17:20:03 2015 UTC,I didn't know that
gundeals,36zgx5,Sloppy_Twat,6,Sat May 23 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"It's just a Revokable Living Trust with legalize added for whatever reason they need legalize for, and with a lot of the fat removed for things like bank accounts or housing since it's assumed you don't need those included if you're buying a firearm trust.  You can add those in easily whenever you want, as the grantor and sole trustee.  Most have clauses saying the grantor can modify the trust at a whim as long as they notify the beneficiaries somehow.  The important thing to remember is like any trust, it exists for the sake of the beneficiary not the grantor (which in most states cannot be the same person). So technically you have to allow your beneficiary to use your guns whenever they ask. I got around his by including my anti-firearm parents so if they ever change their mind, I am obligated by law to make my SBR available to them.  My friend used me because I have no problem not demanding to use his guns.  However It's good to understand exactly how the trust works just in case. It is a legal document and although there are loopholes, it's not a vehicle intended to be used for yourself."

gundeals,36ycu4,QuietPewPew,3,Sun May 24 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"I think what QuietPewPew meant is that it seems odd that two sizes of buffer tubes and two sizes of collapsible buttstock are still produced. Anymore milspec buffer tubes cost the same 10-20 dollars as their commercial spec counter parts (with the exception of glam brands which are substantially more expensive).   It's just confusing for people new to the AR world because it's the only true ""different"" part when it comes to milspec. A non-milspec charging handle, handguard, or muzzle brake is still going to fit on any generic AR15, or M4, or M16, C7, C8, etc.  I have a theory that the ""commercial"" spec tube comes from Colt during their long standing ""anti-civilian"" days. EG: oversized Pivot pins, sear block, crecent moon bolt carrier group, etc.   It's just something that should die out.

It only becomes a rifle or pistol once you put the complete upper on the complete lower. After that it is whatever you just made it.    Only problem you will run into is if like the other poster someone logs it out as a rifle. Just make sure he logs it out as other.

gundeals,36ttxb,igrulks,1 point,Fri May 22 06:44:10 2015 UTC,"I bought my Noveske barrel used, only 200 rounds down pipe. I got a ridiculously good price on it. I don't think I could justify the expense of a new setup. That being said, once you own one, the quality is readily apparent."
gundeals,36ttxb,drink_or_die,2,Fri May 22 16:52:48 2015 UTC,"What barrels were you running on your former 14.5 rifles?  The draw of a ss 14.5 barrel is that it can fit many roles.  Short enough to be handy in tight areas but still can stretch out to 600m while maintaining decent velocity and accuracy.  A 10"" sbr would be a better fit as an entry gun and a spr would be better suited for longer range engagements.  It all comes down to what role do you need your rifle to fill.  Once you figure that out build accordingly."
gundeals,36ttxb,drink_or_die,2,Fri May 22 06:41:35 2015 UTC,"Ironically, the last one that I had the biggest problems with was a Rainer Arms Select Barrel, SKU RA:263.  I used it on a 2-day tactical rifle class, and it had a stuck case in the chamber  4 different times over the weekend (good cleaning between day 1 and 2, and used good quality brass ammo).  Because it was an ""advanced"" class, a significant amount of coursework was out away from a range and on farmland where it was a huge pita to strip the entire gun and pop the case out with a rod while laying out in a field.  The accuracy with the barrel was incredibly good (we were shooting out to 300 yards), but a stuck case malfunction is the absolute worse to deal with, short of something actually breaking on the gun.    It's a fun setup to play around with (I use it to shoot coyotes off my deck now), but I would never use it again for anything that requires a lot of shooting and reliability."

The sights look like crap and the finish was pretty much worn. The metal underneath was still in very good condition. Got the slide milled to add modern night sights, got it sandblasted, and cerakoted. I didn't know what the condition of the recoil, extractor, mainspring, etc, so I just replaced them with some factory replacements.   It shoots very well.   edit- Note: some Pre-B models do not accept current MecGar or factory CZ75B mags without slight modifications. The transitional models during certain years can accept both modern and Pre-B mags.

gundeals,36o5ve,mitchellb3,1 point,Wed May 20 23:27:43 2015 UTC,Yup. Pre-B so no FPB and the Pre-B guns have a short reset trigger disconnect. These have a lot of build potential.

gundeals,36n6hs,john_dillinger,14,Wed May 20 16:41:24 2015 UTC,Fuck I thought this was the PPQ with threaded barrel for a second and I almost had a heart attack.
gundeals,36n6hs,icantcontrolmyself,3,Wed May 20 16:42:08 2015 UTC,Could you enlighten me to the difference?
gundeals,36n6hs,KirbyStyle,7,Wed May 20 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"The PPQ is striker-fired, while the PPX has a weird hammer-fired design where the hammer is basically always partially cocked, so the trigger pull is smooth. I can't even explain how great the trigger pull is. Also, the PPQ costs a fair bit more than the PPX, so there's that."
gundeals,36n6hs,Herballistic,5,Wed May 20 17:33:41 2015 UTC,The PPQ also has a milled component whereas the PPX has a dual molded and press fit component. For some this is a big issue of quality. It's certainly vs cost saving move for the PPX.

gundeals,36n6hs,wahh,2,Wed May 20 20:24:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think they will offer that...
gundeals,36n6hs,icantcontrolmyself,2,Wed May 20 20:25:23 2015 UTC,Me either. I'd have to piece an M2 long slide upper to an M1 lower and buy an aftermarket 5 inch threaded barrel. That's a lot of money though.
gundeals,36n6hs,wahh,1 point,Wed May 20 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"I want the same thing. So we'd have to buy a 5 in barrel, slide, and spring, right? And it will work with an m1 'lower'?"
gundeals,36n6hs,wahh,2,Thu May 21 03:24:28 2015 UTC,"M2 uppers will work on M1 lowers and vice versa. As /u/Roeschu said, there is a 5 inch kit that is being sold by Walther in Germany right now. It may eventually make it over here. Yes, you'd have to buy a complete 5 inch slide, barrel, and spring. However, they do not make a threaded 5 inch barrel. You'd have to go aftermarket for that. You can get one from Jarvis. The downside is that barrel costs $275. :("
gundeals,36n6hs,Roeschu,1 point,Thu May 21 03:35:26 2015 UTC,You can buy the kit to make it longer. Then you can have both.
gundeals,36n6hs,wahh,2,Wed May 20 20:34:26 2015 UTC,The kit appears to only be available in Germany at the moment. The notion of this sounds much better than buying an M1 and an M2 and making two frakenguns out of them.
gundeals,36n6hs,Imtheone457,4,Wed May 20 20:50:36 2015 UTC,I have many Walthers including the non-threaded version of the PPX. It's a great gun with a spectacular trigger and feel. Don't know if you can get a better gun under $300-400

gundeals,36mm3u,RadfordGT,1 point,Thu May 21 15:34:42 2015 UTC,OK so I just got a suppressor. Do I need an adjustable gas block? How does it help with a suppressor?
gundeals,36mm3u,WTFNameIsntTaken,2,Thu May 21 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"Suppressors create backpressure.  On a DI system (AR15) the backpressure can really get out of hand slamming the buffer system and bolt with unnecessary pressures and can sometimes blow that pressure through the charging handle into the shooters face.  Theres a GasBuster charging handle that helps mitigate that issue, but an adjustable gas block can let you tailor the gas system perfectly for use with and without a suppressor.  Also helps with the recoil like earlier mentioned: an overgassed system slams the bolt and buffer, better to have it tuned."

gundeals,36hg5t,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Wed May 20 10:17:22 2015 UTC,Except that Freedom is basically using the exact same process as a regular ammo manufacturer. Only difference is their brass isn't new. They sell new ammo as well now.
gundeals,36hg5t,whubbard,2,Wed May 20 07:30:05 2015 UTC,"I ran through all 500 rounds of this stuff I bought a while back without any issues. I'll vouch for it.  Besides, even if you get 7 failures per 700, that's the same as 10 failures per 1000 rd case. Thats $1.89 of failed ammo, which is still significantly less than the $20ish you save per case (pre-shipping). I'm not real good at math, but I'll take the chance of ~10 failures for +$18.11.   It's cheap ammo. Nature of the beast."
gundeals,36hg5t,notyourginger,2,Wed May 20 02:27:17 2015 UTC,Do you know what a squib is? It's when there isn't enough powder to send the bullet through the barrel. The bullet gets lodged inside the barrel. You have to beat out the bullet from inside your barrel. If you don't know that you had a squib most people probably wouldn't. You could chamber another round and blow your gun up. I don't take that chance.
gundeals,36hg5t,nimrod1109,2,Wed May 20 09:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm aware, but I appreciate the unnecessary reminder. I'm also aware that if you have any kind of experience with firearms, you can tell when you fire a squib round. Judging by the fact that you didn't blame this ammo for ""blowing your gun up,"" I'm assuming you knew that as well. All I was saying is that the off chance of possibly having a squib round is worth the $20/1000rds savings to me since I have never had a failure with this stuff.  Also, keep in mind that you already admitted that most of those squib rounds were under recall and therefore not exaclty relevant in this argument."
gundeals,36hg5t,notyourginger,0,Thu May 21 02:17:24 2015 UTC,4 of them were from the recall. I had 2 squibs from 2 other batches. I have never had a squib from any other brand out of the thousands of rounds I have shot. That ratio is pretty insane in my opinion. You can shoot what ever you want. I probably just got extremely unlucky and it turned me off from the company. I have no reason to buy them now that I've gotten into reloading. I'm sure they make good ammo. I haven't heard of anyone else with as bad as an experience as I have.   Sorry if I seemed rude. I've met a lot of people who don't know what a squib is. I honestly believe it's a big deal to have that many failure in that few of rounds. It kind of shocks me that people wouldn't be worried by it. Like I said I probably just pulled the short straw.

Oddly, no failures shooting them out of the PCR so far. Don't know if it's luck or if the PCR is doing something right."
gundeals,36hg5t,nimrod1109,-1,Tue May 19 21:23:55 2015 UTC,There reloads are shit. 6 squibs in 700 rounds is ridiculous. It's all underpowered.
gundeals,36hg5t,Cadillakakak,1 point,Tue May 19 23:00:54 2015 UTC,I put an extended firing pin and a lighter recoil spring in the SP01 and have had no more issues from that pistol.  My theory is that they are just really light loads. I still practice with them and drill unexpected failures.
gundeals,36hg5t,nimrod1109,-1,Tue May 19 23:21:20 2015 UTC,I shouldn't have to mod my gun to make it shoot. My SP01 will eat anything (even the shitty freedom).   6 squibs is not okay. If someone didn't know what happened and racked and fired they will destroy there gun and possible seriously injure them selfs.

Also successor trustees are needed in case they need to take over control of the trust, whereas beneficiaries will receive items once they are of age and the settlor/trustee has died.  to quote the site:   It is necessary to have a Successor Trustee in case the current Trustee(s) for whatever future reason do not meet the requirements to possess NFA controlled items/firearms. If Co-Trustees are included, the Successor Trustee would only act if the other Trustees all became ineligible and the Settlor did not elect another Successor Trustee.

gundeals,36hbz8,plaidshorts,1 point,Tue May 19 18:10:13 2015 UTC,You definitely want to make sure that she is listed as settlor and the NFA items are actually in her possession/in the state of PA.

gundeals,36hbz8,Gen4200,2,Tue May 19 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: it allows you to fastrack some paperwork (namely Form 1) via E-Filing as well as avoiding fingerprint/CLEO sign off.  Primarily, it allows you to E-File an ATF Form 1 for the manufacture of an SBR which should decrease your wait time.  More importantly, a trust is a legal entity that is precluded from having to submit finger prints and get a CLEO sign off before submitting any NFA paperwork to the ATF.  On top of that, it allows you to protect whatever is placed into the trust (think of it like a container).  This will allow your successors to avoid probate upon your demise.  Also, those listed in the trust can legally use the items specified in the trust (i.e NFA weapons or suppressors) without your physical presence."
gundeals,36hbz8,Gen4200,1 point,Tue May 19 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"So if I'm understanding this right you buy into the trust and instead of form 1ing like you would normally have to, get local pd permission, fingerprints, and then submit for govt approval you can go straight to govt approval? So basically you pay that 79 to get to spending the 200 quicker? Can the trust ever be disseminated or torn apart?"
gundeals,36hbz8,k4ylr,0,Wed May 20 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"You create the trust, you can do it yourself, or hire it out to a lawyer.  Once that's done, you can place anything you'd like into the trust.  You still fill out a Form 1, however the weapon is then registered to the Trust (and all trustees therein) rather than a lone individual.  You also avoid having to have CLEO approval and fingerprints.  The difference is that Trusts are allowed to E-File their Form 1, effectively speeding up the processing time at the BATFE.  Lately, however, the influx of e-filers has slowed it down some."

The diameter of the barrel under the gas block may be different also, most are still .75""  though. I have a 300BLk barrel with a .875""gas block and its just fat enough to limit what kinds of hand-guards I can use over it.  So be careful about that.  Basically, save yourself the hassle and build a whole new upper around the new barrel.

gundeals,36ga5l,wizang,2,Tue May 19 07:18:17 2015 UTC,They got this without the handguard in a carbine length for $20 less.    I wound up getting the wrong length guard last time.  This would be so perfect for me. Argh!    I have to stay strong and not abuse my credit any more.   I blame this subreddit for all of it.   I'm going camping and getting away from the temptation.

gundeals,36fw0g,Germanshield,3,Tue May 19 05:37:03 2015 UTC,So that's not the cheapest 7.62 around. Is it just good ammo or something?  Idk anything about this stuff.

I'm now the proud owner of a near pristine 1951 K31 previously carried by a gentleman named René Warti.    To add to the value, if you have a Gander Mtn nearby you can walk in and pick from the guns in stock there to get a good one.  My local store only had three in, the 1951 that I picked out, a 1943 in good mechanical shape but some surface rust on the magazine and trigger guard, and a 1944 with a bolt that I didn't like the feel of.  Your local mileage may vary.    I wanted to thank /u/alliwanttodoislogin but it seems I was banned from /r/guns at some point, probably because they are a shit sub and I said so before unsubscribing.  I find it odd though that I have no messages in my history telling me I was banned, I thought that was automatic.  Strange...  (I R DUM)    So if you see this, thanks a lot man!

They only had 1 left and it was in decent shape so I picked it up. All matching 1947 and just some finish wear on the internal parts, it's definitely seen use, but it was well oiled and the action is super smooth. There's some real light rust spots on the butt plate but none on the functional parts or barrel bands, not bad considering the age and amount of finish wear on it. I didn't have a chance to check for a ID tag yet but I will when I get it home tonight, it's sitting locked up in my car at work right now~"
gundeals,36gg0m,bigmatt17073,3,Tue May 19 21:47:12 2015 UTC,I went in to gander mountain yesterday and put one on layaway. Bluing was perfect and the walnur stock was a real looker. I might go back in today to put another one on layaway before the sale ends. It's a really great deal if you can go in and handpick one.
gundeals,36gg0m,spacebarman6,3,Tue May 19 11:35:57 2015 UTC,"I went out today and bought one. I've wanted one for awhile and really did after shooting one a few weeks ago.   There were 3 of them on the floor and all of the stocks looked really beat. The sales guy pulled two still in the box out from the back for me to look at. First one was beat up as well, but the second was a keeper. It is all numbers matching and serial puts it at 1948. I'll clean it when I get home from work tonight and maybe take a pic or two.

gundeals,36ep2a,icantcontrolmyself,3,Mon May 18 20:51:25 2015 UTC,I think you're right about it being the regular price from PSA. The rifle being in stock is another issue entirely.
gundeals,36ep2a,wizang,1 point,Mon May 18 21:00:47 2015 UTC,They like to put good deals out of stock on free shipping weekends as well.

gundeals,36eo9t,Hellspark08,2,Mon May 18 21:49:25 2015 UTC,Agreed on the brown bear being dirty. It's laquored so you have to make sure you clean really well. Brown Brown bear is also the only thing I have seen fail to fire with any of my pistols except that the rate for me so far has been 1 failure to fire out of 300ish rounds.
gundeals,36eo9t,wahh,2,Mon May 18 21:55:36 2015 UTC,It's my understanding that the lacquered case fouling is an old wives tale. Or old range master tale I guess.

gundeals,36eo9t,El_Zalo,3,Mon May 18 21:54:58 2015 UTC,I think all 3 of them at bi-metal. If you shoot outdoors it's not usually a problem but shooting this stuff indoors is usually a no-no. Most outlaw it because of the potential for sparks against the back stop.

gundeals,36iq5l,2four,2,Tue May 19 18:33:11 2015 UTC,Do you think lowers plus lower parts kits will go much lower than this?  I was thinking about getting this now and looking for a deal on an upper around the fourth
gundeals,36iq5l,2four,1 point,Tue May 19 19:45:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll go higher. My best prediction is you'll see the same prices you see now and a few things slightly lower.   What is special about the holiday is that we'll see some loss leaders and some stuff on sale that usually isn't. But that's not what you're looking for. You'll probably see a bunch of RDS for <$50, lots of guns for sale, ammo being loss led, and bags and cases for cheap. AR parts will go on sale, but probably not stupidly low, because they aren't the star of the show."
gundeals,36iq5l,DethMagnet,4,Tue May 19 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/QuietPewPew.  I am also in the middle of my first build, was also going to wait until Memorial Day / 4th of July, and have already found deals that were too good to pass up.  So, here are my thoughts.  Assuming you're a ""budget"" builder, which it sounds like you are if you're trying to save $10 on a LPK -- and there's nothing wrong with that, because I'm the same way -- you need to consider a few things:   Know relative pricing!!!  You only know if $109 is a good deal it you know how much things cost elsewhere. Know what you're willing to spend more money on! I ended up buying an Aero FDE stripped lower ($60), BCM charging handle ($35), Magpul BAD lever ($20)... I could've saved money there for sure, but those are upgrades I was willing to purchase (still, at discounted prices), and I probably saved $60-$70 off of retail on those three combined. Know that you WILL spend more on your build, unless you a) buy EXACTLY what you planned on or b) you get lucky and find something cheaper   Key advice, don't get so hung up on saving $5-$10, or you'll start off stressing over it (or worse yet, deals you missed out on, I know).  Good luck, and maybe try /r/ar15 for future questions..."

gundeals,36iq5l,DethMagnet,5,Tue May 19 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"Haha!  Sorry, my quality of advice on that front is probably not as universal.  Mine is working like this:   Tell her I can build one for less than $500. Buy parts periodically over a 3-4 month period. Ensure she stays out of the loop enough to not realize that the final product will be around $700 (minus optics). If she does realize the cost overrun, convince her that the same setup is hundreds cheaper than a similar retail version. Offer her clothes, sex, or food in return."
gundeals,36iq5l,CantHearYou,1 point,Tue May 19 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to say that IT WORKED!  The whole ""Memorial Day Deals"" thing helped too.  I could tell that her ""No"" answer before wasn't sincere and it was only a matter of time before I got her to break, but throwing in the ""If I wait everything will cost so much more"" did the trick.  And yeah...I told her it would probably be like $500.  I think I'm about to drop $400 on the upper alone....so yeah."
gundeals,36iq5l,Wadsworth34,0,Wed May 20 13:30:04 2015 UTC,Per Dethmagnet the big thing to tell your wife is that you can buy parts every month and assembly it so its not one big purchase. Works well with my wife.

Just a heads up  Edit: after comparing the cheap one I bought to the one pictured on their website, their soft case really is not like the one I have. It probably is worth buying for 15 bucks. Mine is a cheap one piece of material crap that doesn't even have a pocket and has real thin handles. The one on sale here looks it is much better quality.

gundeals,36cxaw,WyattDerpp,15,Mon May 18 11:31:30 2015 UTC,"I've got a 36"" Voodoo 2 rifle case that I absolutely despise.  Similar to this one.  If you pick the case up by the ""backpack"" strap, they just come undone, causing you to drop the case unless you're careful.  The straps just keep sliding out of the attachment points.  So, I figured I'd give voodoo a call and let them know of the issue.  The guy I spoke to said he knew of the issue and that I should staple the strap.  Sure, I can do that....it's not a big deal, but it's bullshit that I have to....and it's even more bullshit that I was told they were aware of the issue.  I apologize for the hijack, but when I'm paying $90 for a case, I'd expect to be able to pick it up however I want to without fear of straps failing on me."

The case is a tight fit if you have a full length AR barrel.  I also didn't care for how the strap is attached.  It makes it difficult to sling over the shoulder like you normally would.  I usually carry it using the handles.

gundeals,36a2dn,whoopiethereitis,2,Sun May 17 17:31:43 2015 UTC,I bought one last month. Had it exactly 3 days. The trigger sucks. I took it apart for a detailed cleaning and there was rust in the firing pin channel and the sear had a knick in it. It only came with one back strap and all 3 magazine springs were so weak the last 2 rounds wouldn't chamber. The night sights were also at 10%. Not recommended. I'm just glad I made my money back when I sold it. They don't come with thumb safeties like the picture suggests it's just a stock photo because buds gun shop is lazy

gundeals,368j7p,bdnicho,0,Sun May 17 07:29:27 2015 UTC,kinda bummed bought a sig p938 for my birthday on april 29 the rebates not for the pistol and only for may. So i checked the mags for the 938 and they are like 40$ a piece my beretta that holds 15 instead of 7 was for like 20$ and 6 times as big.
gundeals,368j7p,batm8,2,Sun May 17 07:38:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a rebate on the 938s that I recall, so you're not really ""missing"" anything by buying when you did.   Yeah, Sig mags are expensive, unfortunately. Normally you can get Mec-Gar brand mags which are just as good for half the price. Mec-Gar makes the factory magazines for many European gun manufacturers (Sig included) who just rebrand them. Unfortunately, I don't believe Mec-Gar makes magazines for the P938s, or, at the least, doesn't sell their own versions. The best I could find online for a 938 mag was $33 on backorder.  In regards to the choice of gun, though, a P938 serves a different purpose than larger guns. Which Beretta are you talking about?"
gundeals,368j7p,bdnicho,2,Sun May 17 07:49:54 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the Mec-gar mags for my 226 as you get another 3 rounds in the same space.

I bought a beretta 92fs + a 92s and the mags for them are 20$ when i bought beretta manufactured mags. I then got this sig p938 here with with the laser for 500$ as the other pistols(berettas) are way to big to carry or just leave in the car.
gundeals,368j7p,batm8,1 point,Sun May 17 07:53:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, looks like I was mistaken. They aren't backorderable, but you can sign up to be notified when they get more in stock. Link. Also, here's a good search engine you can use to keep an eye for magazine deals.  As for the Beretta, the mags are so cheap because the 92 has been adopted by the military for 25 years. This means that there is a lot of competition for mags, surplus, contract overruns, and plenty of demand in the civilian market to keep production high and costs down.   Magazines for most other pistols that don't have similar military legacy usually cost $30+."

gundeals,3647zo,132456,1 point,Sat May 16 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  In fact, the majority of uppers all come from like 5 or 6 forges, just with different names slapped on them."
gundeals,3647zo,JonDeaux,1 point,Sun May 17 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"And since I know Aero Precision is one of the few OEM providers for lower receivers, I would presume they also manufacture (and provide to other manufacturers) their own upper receivers as well."
gundeals,3647zo,shatteredninja,2,Sun May 17 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"they are pretty good. fit is going to vary with your lower,but the finish is very nice."
gundeals,3647zo,Maggioman,2,Sat May 16 05:06:42 2015 UTC,I have an anderson and a aero lower. The finish on the aero is noticeably better than the anderson. Definitely worth the cost difference.

gundeals,364egt,darthalal,7,Sat May 16 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Good price, but my girlfriend has this gun and the trigger sucks. The P30 trigger isn't great to begin with and the P30S has an even longer reset. If no safety isn't a deal breaker for you, I'd go with the cheaper (and better imo) VP9."
gundeals,364egt,IAmAWalrusAMA,1 point,Sat May 16 02:27:55 2015 UTC,How is it a good price if the trigger sucks? What does it do better than an M&P for half the price?
gundeals,364egt,Hovsky,4,Sat May 16 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"I own both and it is better in every way except for the trigger. I personally like the feel and break of the P30's trigger better, just the reset is excruciatingly long. Other than that it beats the M&P in ergonomics, fit and finish, reliability, and being hammer fired (not necessarily better, but many people think so). I can't really speak for recoil management since my M&P is in .40 while my P30 is 9mm.  The M&P is great, but it is competing with the Glocks and XDs. HKs are on a different level of build quality which is reflected by the price. Honestly though, I agree with u/IAmAWalrusAMA about the VP9. I picked one of these up as well and it is my favorite handgun right now and more affordable to boot."

gundeals,364egt,Hovsky,1 point,Sat May 16 18:06:08 2015 UTC,The key here is 'for you'. I have small hands; I can swipe down the mag release on HKs/Walthers with my trigger finger without breaking my grip. I can't reach most thumb mag releases without shifting the gun in my hands.  Everyone is different.   Yes they're expensive and IMO overpriced. I don't think they're magical as some claim. But that doesn't mean they're pointless.
gundeals,364egt,IGETSHIVERSWHENIP,-1,Sat May 16 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't buy the safety model personally (I hate safeties), but this is the best price brand-new that I have seen, by a long shot, so I figured I would post.  That being said, I've shot both the P30 and P30S, and had the opposite experience; on the two I had access to, the S felt like it had the shorter reset?  Might just be sample variability.  In any case, they were both better than my P2000 V3, unfortunately for me. xD  It's a shame HK triggers aren't better for the cost.  I just picked up a P-07, for pittance compared to what a P2000/P30/USP/whatever would run new, and even out-of-the-box, the trigger is so much better.  Oh well.   I don't want a VP9, though.  Personally the ergo's for me are not great; they look the same (or at least very similar), but in-hand the VP9 has a strange, very uncomfortable 'hump' in the upper rear portion of the grip, with both the medium and small backstraps for me at least. P30 with the medium fits my relatively small hands perfectly.  I also prefer having a hammer, for appendix carry (which I probably couldn't get away with for a gun this size anyway, but 'eh')."

Cheek weld is adequate, and its certainly comfortable to shoulder.  I like the nice touch with the angled shoulder pad toward the bottom compared to most other stocks."
gundeals,360joe,alohroh,1 point,Mon May 18 20:56:47 2015 UTC,Do you feel like it balances well? Or does the rifle feel front heavy?
gundeals,360joe,locknload45,1 point,Mon May 18 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"It does become a little more front heavy.  Depending on the way your rig is set up, it will be more/less noticeable.  My rifle was a tad more rear-biased in weight because its only got a 14.5"" barrel and a very lightweight keymod handguard.  So for my setup, the weight shift is noticable, but it doesn't feel unbalanced because its already a fairly lightweight setup even with the optic and light."
gundeals,360joe,alohroh,1 point,Mon May 18 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"My setup will be a bit more front heavy than yours, but not by much. I think I will go with the str for now, and try the minimalist on an sbr later"

On the list of options, I saw 1/2x28 ""9mm extended Beretta"" but never looked into what was special about them. And on that note, I didn't even know that they were fixed barrels."
gundeals,3601nc,jayemo,2,Fri May 15 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"They're not fixed, they just lock differently from most pistols (they're basically a modernized Walther P38). The barrel moves directly back and forward, no up or down/tilting motion."
gundeals,3601nc,richalex2010,2,Fri May 15 12:20:44 2015 UTC,"Just looked it up, apparently they use a locking block in the barrel that locks to the slide and is swung down by the frame to unlock.

gundeals,3601nc,mpdahaxing,1 point,Sat May 16 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"Silencerco generally doesn't include Pistons from the factory. Distributors sometimes bundle them with the product as a package. Even for just 9mm pistons, I can think of 3 different thread pitches. Even glock and sig 9mm pistols have different pitches based on whether the threaded barrel is factory or aftermarket. Silencerco would never know what piston to put in the box."
gundeals,3601nc,Patches78,1 point,Mon May 18 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"Well, since 95% of people would be using 1/2x28, they would put those in the box and let distributors swap them out if the customer changes it on the order.  This is what AAC and a couple other companies do."

gundeals,35r9pl,OmniaMors,1 point,Wed May 13 20:48:25 2015 UTC,I recently picked up a 590 and decided to pump some .00 in it for home defense practice.  I shot it 5 times before I pussed out and started shooting some birdshot for practice.  I know for a fucking fact that is a very deadly round - I have a good ole red mark on my shoulder to prove it.

Classicfirearms was cool about it. I'd buy from them again.   I am curious at how a ddi build gun would do.

A few years ago a buddy of mine bought a Draco, paid for the tax stamp, and put a stock on it to make an SBR and the whole thing including stamp cost him like 450 bucks now you can't even get the Draco for that."

gundeals,35qu4t,vorgain,2,Tue May 12 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"I've always read the KA headstamped ammo was corrosive and ran too hot for Garands.  Any truth to that?  The Paki stuff works fine for me, so if you guys don't want it I'll make sure to keep buying it.  Edit: Widners also did a write up of this Paki stuff."
gundeals,35qu4t,ZeeCatnip,2,Tue May 12 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"We've ran 80 rounds through my buddy's Garand, seems to work fine. He has one of those adjustable gas plugs in his, so that may have helped it it's loaded a little hot. I've run it in my Madsen M47 and it's worked fine as well, but I try to only run the best through it if I can.   As to corrosion I've not seen any, but I like to really clean my rifles after a trip to the range, it's maybe my favorite part.   I just had some bad experiences with some .308 Pakistani ammo and some really, really, bad experiences with .303 stuff, but I think everyone has. I had a hang-fire that felt like a flintlock firing once..."
gundeals,35qu4t,vorgain,2,Tue May 12 21:52:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was the .303 stuff that ruined everyone's impression of the POF ammo.  Stuff takes literally a second to go off after a trigger pull.  It's ridiculous.

gundeals,35pi8x,azuredrg,3,Tue May 12 18:33:22 2015 UTC,But then couldn't you just buy this TiN BCG and swap the bolts with your standard 9mm BCG? Wouldn't that be cheaper than getting a black one coated? (Assuming you have a black 9mm BCG already and that you would have use for a 5.56 BCG)
gundeals,35pi8x,icantcontrolmyself,2,Tue May 12 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misunderstood the first question earlier. They're built differently, 9mm bolts are integral to the assembly because they operate on blowback and don't use a gas system with a locked bolt. The bcg for most calibers lock the bolt in place with the bcg and use the gas system to push it back. For pistol carbines. they are one piece and whole thing moves back after striking the primer."
gundeals,35pi8x,azuredrg,1 point,Tue May 12 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, a Bolt Carrier Group (BCG) includes a bolt. A BCG is basically the sum of all the parts. So I think you're looking to say here a TiN bolt carrier with a 9mm bolt."

There is one main difference between the two, TiN impregnates the steel with Titanium whereas NiB is a plating process. If you make the switch, I doubt you will ever look back."
