So what do they do? they put reduced mana's mechanic on a different gem and they make ec manual (until they make an auto cry on hit gem). i mean sure, that is fine. if you ask me just remove the %mana multiplier from the game and balance auras and buffs around that, but im not a game designer so whatevs.  What i find funny is everything else. why gut every mechanic and synergey they had created in the last 2 years? Are we going to pretend that AA wasn't designed around the old eb? Cloak too, i mean i do think old coil was a little bit too popular but you get that. there will always technically be a best in slot.  but why nerf everything? why gut every defensive combo? were they afraid that the new content would be trivialised by 100% lightning resist legacy coil 150ex build in standard? maybe they do fear for the longevity of their content and in extension their game, but it is the obsessive players that keep playing through the quiet seasons between leagues and with superior preparation will ace the new content regardless of steepened skill curves, and it is the new players and the on and off players that come back for the new features of a new league and with their (generally speaking) lack of preparation get gutter stomped by the new content and then leave because getting wrecked is no fun.  ggg seems to be afraid that less hard content will cause more intense players to leave due to lack of challenge, while new players are driven off by the same content that is meant to keep them coming back. Build diversity breathes life into this game, having everybody using the same build causes players to leave due to boredom and lack of content. remember different skills and classes are technically content too."

However, losing is only fun as long as the player feels like they had a reasonable choice they could have made that would have let them win. It's the difference between ""Man, I fucked up but this time I'll get it!"" and ""Man, this game is fucked up"".

I want to be able to turn the tables on Malachai and be able to one-shot him by the time I am leveled and geared through the ceiling of everything that is reasonable.  That reversal is what's fun, because it shows the progress of the character.   Wow, you used to be a difficult boss, remember me now, bitch?

Not to mention, that monsters hit more often and way harder than they used to. I was trying to see if you can still farm corrupted zones and got whacked in a level 65 zone without any offensive mods. 20,000 evasion, dodge, AA, e-charges and Fortify and at level 78 I got almost oneshot by some Vaal Fallen."

Cloak was not the best caster defense by a long shot; it was simply cheap to build around. AA was not op; it was comparatively weak at high character levels and required some thought to run at high gem levels. EB + AA had a unique and challenging relationship with Acrobatics, Reduced Mana allowed for more flexibility with ""aura"" gem links (like Empower use or HoI + Increased Area of Effect + Prolif), but now it's all gutted.  I feel like there was more potential for diversity in 1.3. Right now we're seeing a lot of skills being tested and working ok, but the builds are generally bland."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,tackle70,6,Tue Jul 21 12:07:25 2015 UTC,Build diversity breathes life into this game   This so much. I don't think they understand the reason many people play PoE is because of all the crazy different builds you can make. By making it so you can't play most of their builds they took the fun out of the game for most people.  Should things have been made harder? Probably. Things were getting a bit too easy for even just semi casual players that knew how to play the game well. The issue is they went crazy at making things harder.  So while typing this up and about to say something else I realized something: They do in fact realize that build diversity is something they need. You can see this by the reblancing of all attack skills and also many support gems. They knew they needed to change things to make more skills and support gems more viable. The issue seems to have come in where they made things way too hard by making mobs have more life and damage while at the same time nerffing defensive mechanics into the ground.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Zoogy,27,Tue Jul 21 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, but as a player, i don't care if they KNEW what should be done, as long as it is not done, i don't care.

People was playing with Tornado Shot, Cyclone, Kinetic Blast, all spells, all summons, physical and ele builds etc. Then someone discovered the OPness of Elemental Prolif and everything went downhill.   I don't mind the game being hard and punitive. I do mind when the game doesn't provide the proper tools to face the harshness they throw at you. That's cheating. Right know nothing works on high-end level maps. I'm playing with armor + fortify + endurance charges + block + AA + 180% life + granite/ruby always up (no LC/taste of hate yet because no currency) with BARE MINIMUM to pull a crit build and I still feel squishy. I literally spent 80 levels just picking defense nodes and I already know how my char is gonna die: stunlocked by a pack of skeleton bears or offscreened by birds."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Phridgey,3,Tue Jul 21 07:36:11 2015 UTC,The real kicker is that ele prolif was a fun mechanic. Now it's nerfed and the game just feels like it has one less fun mechanic in it because ele prolif doesnt feel endgame viable.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,HeroFromHyrule,28,Tue Jul 21 12:39:34 2015 UTC,Which is a huge shame because it's a fun and interesting mechanic. I really hope they revisit the changes and make it viable again.

And i agree. Removing it's functionality against auras i understand. Fine. But then placing that on enlighten? It was unnecessary. It keeps the mechanic in the game but much more rng/wealth gated
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Vulpix0r,64,Tue Jul 21 14:39:13 2015 UTC,I won't disagree with you on that. Enlighten should not even be the new reduced mana.

The only difference there is less build variety on the top of the ladder, because they play FotM builds, which produces similar deaths count as before.  Instead of redesigning a lot of mechanics and increasing flat dmg  by significant amount, they could just fine tune some of the stuff, or add alternatives. Like AA+EB+CoD/MoM was the only solid option for spellcasters, but they destroyed it and gave nothing to compensate."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,insanemetal187,23,Tue Jul 21 08:10:38 2015 UTC,"This is the third time I've seen them do this (OB, release and now) and their process seems to makes a dramatic shift in difficulty, like jack shit way up by making more difficult mobs with the new content and make everything hit harder.  They do this along with nerfing the old defenses.  Then they spend the year following balancing it all out.  You see the results of everything coming together in leagues like rampage/beyond.   Personally I've always fought against this.  They are introducing the game to a large audience, there's already a steep learning curve and if they feel they are slamming their face into a brick wall why would they stick around?    I like that they take their time to see how the meta reacts to little changes between these large gaps, like all the flameblast changes.  But with all the new content why not see if the old EHP options are still ""OP"" after them all?  Why does EHP have to go down at the same time mob damage goes up?    Right now you could make an argument that the fortify set up is ""OP"" but really it's a lack of options and more importantly a lack of good options.  If EB/MoM/AA still worked like it once did we could make judgements of how it works in the current situation.    Basically, expansions they seem to throw their light touch out the window and just gut the game as we know it.  Makes us older players have to figure out how to adjust.  Remember CoD wasn't that popular and coil was mocked as bad when they were introduced.  So I'm sure something will pop up or will be given additional tools, I just wish it wasn't such a drastic shift all at once."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,Mjolnir45acp,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:01 2015 UTC,Im playing as a lvl 90 explosive arrow scion with around 8.1k life running purity of fire\lightning  and arctic armor all lvl 20. Using a koams heart you cant really stack armor so I'm capped at 3 k with around 2k evasion elemental damage damage is just a joke besides oneshoting yourself off screen to a pack of thornflesh but physical damage is just out of proportion. Getting one or twoshotted even by blacksmith or the new pit map boss in addition to just dying to corrupted blood which seems only more insane than before 2.0 just feels lackluster. Have thought about going LC but I'm loosing around 3k life in the process and it doesn't feel right to force a high life build into one choice for body armor making koams heart even more of a useless option.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,tehosiris,13,Tue Jul 21 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"They really need to make the game more dynamic when it comes to semi-instant skills. Big part of the reason for cyclone being so dominant is that it can be used on the run. I don't think there is a single skill in the game that is even remotely comparable to cyclone's mobility / clearspeed ratio.    Imagine if you could sweep / ice crash / nova / curse etc on the run!  Look at Diablo 3, it's a shitty game, but damn is it buttery smooth and polished when it comes to combat mechanics.

pathofexile,3e1fjl,koticgood,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:49 2015 UTC,"It's really surprising to me that physical damage still works the way it does. Extremely weird to me that health + capped resists is your entire defense against elemental damage. And once you have that health + resists, you're pretty much safe from elemental damage. I don't understand that at all.   Physical is the complete opposite, with the more dangerous hits negating your armor, and being forced to desperately stack outside sources of mitigation such as endurance charges, fortify, block, dodge, granite, taste of hate, lightning coil, et cetera. It confuses me that players have to seek out so many different sources of phys mitigation. Why does one damage source entirely determine survivability, defensive strategy, and your death in maps?"
pathofexile,3e1fjl,BlueRenner,5,Tue Jul 21 08:42:33 2015 UTC,"And once you have that health + resists, you're pretty much safe from elemental damage. I don't understand that at all.   That's an artifact of how the numbers work, which is in turn an artifact of how the Diablo2 designers decided to make their game, since PoE used their stat system as a template.  Basically, the problem is percentages.  There's no real difference between low percentage resists (0%-10%), but there's a GIGANTIC difference between high resists (90%-100%).  So this means you can't let the player get anywhere near that 100% mark, as it would represent total immunity from that damage time.  This means you either need diminishing returns or a cap -- D2 chose a cap, so PoE has one too.  Okay.  You have percentage-based resists and you cap how high you can go.   Now you have a problem -- the difference between 50% and 75% resist is huge (double damage).  That's really tricky to balance.  How do you tune a fight when some characters will be taking two, three times the damage as others?  Answer:  you don't.  You plan the fight for everyone having 75% resist, and allow everyone to reasonably get it.  Now you might think you've balanced elemental damage... but what you've actually done is removed elemental damage from the game.  Everyone has 75% resist.  The damage might as well be constant physical.  There's no interesting mechanics or choices here.  And, as a consequence, your character's defense against spells and elemental attacks becomes a function of raw HP... which this thread has a predictable obsession with.  They really need to sit down and get rid of percentage resists sometime, both for elemental and physical damage.  I used to think it was impossible, but after seeing all they changes they brought in with 2.0 it actually seems like a possibility now.  It would make for interesting character choices, which right now elemental mitigation sorely lacks."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,_Madus,5,Tue Jul 21 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"Nerfing CI/EB nodes is worst, because you dont kill one build but plenty of builds tied to those keystones at once."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,LemonGirlScoutCookie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:24 2015 UTC,Yup. This is GGG trying to force a meta which really shouldn't be done. All they are doing is destroying old builds and replacing them with something else. High mana regen caster builds now all go eb/zo because of the aura changes.   It seriously feels like there are two different people developing this game and they have different ideas.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Morsexier,36,Tue Jul 21 07:11:46 2015 UTC,"You see a lot of this thought process though. I've always rolled blue maps. I rolled blue into regal with 4 chisels for 73+ in the old map system. We're talking about years and years of doing this when other people alched and EXALTED maps, and I always maintained. I didn't care what anyone else did, it worked for me. They fiddled with maps a shit ton and it never changed, but now they want to fix what ain't broke.  Now I am ""forced"" to roll maps the new way because its been decided for me.  Now I ""have"" to play with stupid ground effects in like every map because that is a super common roll you get, and it still lags my computer after 2 years.  Look I realize that nothing has to be done, you can still roll blue maps but its very clear that they want you to run the maps the way they want you to, play builds in the way they want you to, and use the gear they want you to.  The people at GGG are not smarter than the community, and for sure not smarter than the people are the forefront of build creation. I don't get why they try to force a shift in the meta, instead of reigning in the excessive builds on both ends, too strong and too weak and thats it.  The Meta will shift on its own once you make changes, you don't need to then further make changes to shift it. If there is an issue, and a problem that results from it, the game doesn't need a fix for the problem AND a change to make the issue go away, this leads to super buffs and super nerfs.  Making uniques, especially leveling ones, which exist purely to make some of the ""worst"" part of the game for long time players less tedious, is so stupid on its face I am not sure where to begin. I get the reasoning behind the end game uniques changes, but the lack of real communication behind how drastic it would end up being was very unfortunate for those of us that made a build relying on a previously common unique.  I hope things change for the better, but a 4 month beta makes me sorta scratch my head over these things happening."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,insanemetal187,19,Tue Jul 21 10:17:13 2015 UTC,"Reading this and the post I just made I just come back to wishing they would use alpha more.  We have good ideas, can give good input, they just seem set on making these large changes against the player's will.    The meta constantly changes based on how they change skills and the new uniques that are introduced.  There's no reason to just gut so much to artificially create change.  Most long term players naturally seek change anyways."

This is probably the biggest problem I have with 2.0. Mightflay gets brought up at least once a day. The fact that there are more Kaom's available for trade than mightflays points to a problem in how they changed around rarity tiers.

For the exception of the big patches, little changes here and there caused massive meta changes. Sometimes even something as trivial as adding or removing 1 armor stat point from a hero would have a perceptible influence on the win/loss rate of that hero.  Changes to POE would be interesting if conducted in a similar way. Instead of nerfing things into the ground or over-buffing skills, small changes made over time could have more meaningful and impactful changes on the meta."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,DeejusChrist,7,Tue Jul 21 07:26:59 2015 UTC,"I always thought Evasion was behind Armor and Energy Shield before 2.0, now it seems like armor is the only option. Maybe they are trying to make hybrid bases more relevant?   Anywho. My suggestion is to give sort of a glancing blows to hits. When entropy reaches the limit and you get hit, your Evasion is checked against their accuracy and will reduce damage. I don't have solid numbers. I just think it's silly that evasion is an all or nothing thing. You can literally have every Evasion node on the tree and die just for being unlucky.  Could do the same thing with ES in a way. Reduce physical damage by a small percentage of your max ES. I mean it protects you from being stunned (50% of the time anyway). Maybe have it reduce damage when it blocks a stun.  Just my two cents."

This applies to all colossal mobs..."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Jimminy_Beavers,5,Tue Jul 21 07:49:57 2015 UTC,I think there's something odd going with evasion regarding some mobs. For example: large white skeleton dudes in the library (merciless) hit me exactly with every second hit. I have 11000 evasion and acrobatics + acro nodes.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,zid,28,Tue Jul 21 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"evasion is actually deterministic, not random, afaik. 50% evasion means every other hit will connect."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Shrie,7,Tue Jul 21 09:04:23 2015 UTC,"To elaborate basically you have an evasion threshold for example 11,000 evasion which gives you a 50% chance to evade.  The first swing from a monster that hits you will fill your threshold from 0 to around 51%ish.  So the second swing will fill your evasion threshold to 102%ish which is over 100 so you will be hit.  However After this happens and you are ""hit"" your evasion threshold is reset.  But since you have the acrobatics nodes you will now have that 30-40% chance to dodge and if you have been registered as a ""hit"" but dodge it you take no damage AND your evasion threshold is reset basically guaranteeing that you will dodge the next attack, this is how you can evade a whole string of attacks.  This is also why Acro+block+evasion used to be so god damn broken because after being ""hit"" you got a chance to block 50-75% usually and then a 30-40% chance to dodge.  Throw in a blind and you only got hit once in a while."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Defarus,19,Tue Jul 21 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"Going all evasion is extremely unreliable against big hits and it always was. It's why a lot of people scaled down their damage and took 160% + max life, 70% increased movespeed, and played less all glass builds unless it was softcore."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,IANVS,4,Tue Jul 21 08:32:57 2015 UTC,"Hybrid armor/eva characters have always been great, just not many people played it...with the ammount of armor you can get from the tree, you cah have reasonable ammounts of both, having the benefits of both - evading good portion of hits (and spells! the bane of armor chars), while having SOME degree of reducing the damage that does get through. As an evasion character, I'd rather have 30% phys. damage reduction for those unlucky hits than none.  The downside is that it limits the builds you can play with those defences, as it requires delving into south part of the tree and spreading out your points, and it favors shields. But it also offers gear flexibility...  I don't know...I am really surprised so few people do hybrid armor/eva."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,852Foofer,4,Tue Jul 21 10:13:25 2015 UTC,Evading spells? If by that you mean doding spells - then no. Acrobatics hurts armour too much. Imho. You're still better off maxing armour and forgetting about Evasion.  Edit: I get it. You mean Elemental attacks. But tbh. you rarely encounter those. And even if a big HP Pool takes care of that. And all the good hp nodes lie right next to the good Armour nodes. Hybrid is really no option.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,schnupfndrache7,4,Tue Jul 21 10:45:15 2015 UTC,I think this could be a nice keystone.   Something that scales with evasion or energyshield and gives you damage reduction

I actually quit a Zana map with a unique drop mission today because it felt too risky, even though it was a Channel map (incinerator's dream). But vulnerability + A4 mobs is just not something I wanna do right now.  I've had a couple of near death experiences and almost all of them were due to one or two white mobs. The last time I played hardcore was in the Nemesis league and I don't remember white mobs being that painful there (played evasion, as well).  Don't get me wrong, I like difficulty, but I definitely feel like phys is a little bit too high. Or rather the balance is waaaay off. I ran maps without max res and that wasn't a problem at all. But now, above 4k life and a single white mob can still bring me blow 20% with phys. And I'm not talking about giant cows.  But the real problem I think this creates is that worse spells are just not possible in hardcore. Incinerate is so strong. But use something worse and you're so damn fucked unless you stack defences like mad. But then your damage might be so low that it's no fun at all.  Right now, the game feels like it's balanced for the OP skills and the rest is just not enjoyable or even usable if you're playing hardcore. For instance, my rather defensive warband firestorm templar would not work in hardcore. Unless I'm willing to spend 30 minutes in a blue 68 map."

The best thing about GGG to me has always been their communication. The beta was the first time I felt a distinct lack of communication between the devs and the players.  We were told EB could change. We were told leech was going to change. There were some ideas bounced back and forth, yes. There were some updates and changes (ES recharge, more nodes added to tree). I feel like we never got any confirmation at any point from anyone that said something along the lines of ""we are happy with where EB is at"". This makes it feel that some of these projects were just abandoned, left unfinished. At launch during the patch notes, we did get some insight as to their thought process.. ""we want the game to be harder"" etc. but I don't feel as though I've ever heard them say that they are happy with where things are at.  The fact they had to nerf Malachai two days after release after even the meager week we were given to test it (I know, don't want to spoil, etc.) when it was pretty well known the boss felt vastly overtuned just speaks to the seeming lack of communication as of late. It's nearing two weeks after launch and we still are missing content from the expansion.   I realize I can only see one side of the story from where I am, but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that the reason we hold GGG to such a high standard is because they have a record of doing the same, so when they fall short it starts to raise a lot of concerns. I am hopeful that they will recover, but it's always just so unfortunate that a thousand good changes are overshadowed by a few glaring ones."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,jaredheath,38,Tue Jul 21 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"beta was a dog and pony show meant to appease the masses while getting some $$$ in the process while effectively delaying 2.0 until it was done, which it certainly was nowhere near done when they first announced it.  The participation of GGG was absent in almost every sense of the word during the beta, save a few times when they had to respond (original map drop rates, which if you think its bad now, you should have seen the beta....)"
pathofexile,3e1fjl,ali-y,21,Tue Jul 21 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think the beta phase was really horrible. The Devs never tested the core game contents (leech, map drops etc ... ) seriously and didn't give the players chance to test them."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,PaladinSMD,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:29 2015 UTC,I fully agree. I also hate the new bosses. For example the dog & chicken boss as soon as one dies the other goes into a frenzy stage instant gibing you.  I had fortify + Endurance charges up + granite flask and after killing the dog one simpel default attack from that stupid bird I was instant gibt. Challenging bosses sure give those I loved fighting dominus in the 78 map it was a challange but it was a fair challange you could tell when he was going to smash and you had to get out! But this new stupid way of how bosses work. is just not fair.  Yesterday I was doing the new shipyard map 79 and there where those falling bears my friend was instant killed by a white falling bear landing right on him. He plays Facebreaker build has over 4600 hp and was instant killed. There where no extra damage mods on the map. physical dmg needs to be rebalanced.
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Ghudda,22,Tue Jul 21 06:41:38 2015 UTC,"I killed those bosses in the village map, by using the top right corner of the screen to view them as far offscreen as possible, laying 3 crit firetraps as close to them as possible, and then planting totems to draw agro and pull them into the traps while I hope I'm far enough away to not be seen, rinse and repeat until the ignites finish them off.  I mean, I may as well have been CI/EB with 1 HP for that fight.  If the dog so much as touches me it's like a vaal smash with the added bonus of a bleed effect, and if the bird so much as sees me it hits me with what I think is Vaal Rain of Arrows which applies a rooting effect and one regular hit afterwards kills me if I don't flask to full in like one nanosecond because the delay on rain of arrows matches up quite nicely with the autoattack for a nice one shot.  I really don't know how to reasonably approach that fight.  Kole is also a very dangerous physical damage boss but he's at least approachable without really cheesy tactics like offscreen fire traps."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Vulpix0r,21,Tue Jul 21 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"That fight is seriously fucked up. I'll agree that much, at least for Dungeon's boss I can get out and screw up occasionally and not die instantly. Village's boss needs to be tuned."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,hegbork,30,Tue Jul 21 09:42:46 2015 UTC,"He plays Facebreaker build has over 4600 hp and was instant killed.   To be fair he's probably wearing an Abyssus to make the Facebreaker work. With a perfect Abyssus that's equivalent to 3300 hp.  Not that I think that the damage is reasonable, because it isn't, but Facebreaker builds aren't a good reference for tankiness because of the suicide helmets you have to wear to make them work."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,ObeseGirlSwag,10,Tue Jul 21 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing my marauder for this reason. I've got 5 endurance charges up, about 60% phys reduction with my lvl 22 chaos golem, I'm wearing a kaoms heart ffs to get over 8k life with 225% on the tree and run Arctic armour on top of it all. I can tank a malachai and a Dominus smash, but those fucking white porcupine goliaths in a white orchard map insta gib me with their spikes on death. And I'm not killing the whole pack,  just 2 or 3 at a time. I thought my build was shit but then I realised by talking to friends I was actually super fucking tanky compared to them..."

While I understand that GGG has been upset because of the criticisms they've received about their game and how they feel its unwarranted, let me explain what happened to another company - CCP who made Eve Online. CCP dropped a very controversial balance patch, added more microtransactions that were ridiculously expensive ($80 dollar character monocle) and generally ignored player outcry against these changes. It was catastrophic for their company, they lost over 20,000 subs and their CEO ended up stepping down. Now the situation isn't identical to what GGG is doing, but it is similar, and when a small developer ignores a huge upset in their community, it typically leads to catastrophic repercussions for the company. Obviously, nothing might happen, but I think they're going to lose more of their hardcore playerbase which draw a lot of attention to the game out of some of the decisions they've made."

pathofexile,3e1fjl,grimwald,8,Tue Jul 21 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all it took was one game with [S2]Maliken to realize I would never play an S2 game.

Seriously, it's amazing they're not bankrupt."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,SwiftShadow,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"yeah, build diversity is worse than ever atm, especially for HC. this is pretty accurate sadly. casters are pretty much forced to grab armor and end charges if they want to live, also new EB is pretty meh casters either use low level clarity mixed with elreon jewelry or use BM gem. melee is a bit better but not so much. thing about the popular cwdt combo with EC IC inc duration was it was effective and necessary for some builds (the ones that didnt had 20k armour) because physical bursts are kind of a big deal in poe, and how did they ""fixed"" it? by removing that combo, nerfing self cast IC to the ground and changing the way AA works(which was not so effective aganist big bursts but was still ok against medium hits) which was totaly a lazy way to ""fix"" it and removing a unique design from the game. it really pisses me off after all the feedback from beta they get they do whatever they want anyway."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Tauryu,9,Tue Jul 21 07:01:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Playing a caster at the moment, and while I tried the new EB and MoM, it was just way more efficient to grab extra endurance charges and use Enduring Cry with a CWDT IC ID combo... and running AA for more padding. I also took Zealot's Oath... and am running Life/ES on the tree. There's also a Granite Flask on my bar.  I really think Act IV was overtuned, and way too difficult. Apparently GGG did too- I honestly think the beta needed to last longer. Ill balancing should not have made it to live."

I tried without RF, it's still hard, I have 0.2% leech on my scepter but I don't know if it has any effect.  for the moment I don't know what defense to use with all the nerfs we add, perhaps I'll try with a CoD."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,madcow1120,3,Tue Jul 21 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"GGG has this tendency to go big on nerfs/changes. Sometimes they change too many variables at once and too drastically.   Prolif needed a nerf. It was the reason soo many flameblasts. It was so strong.   Cwdt setups sure. Everyone used it.   Rm on auras. Ok yeah it was a must have so why not rebalance? Putting the same mechanic on a very rare high xp gem? Odd choice.   AA... Yeah it was pretty strong but then they turned up the monster damage... This skill they overdid. Removed its unique mechanic and now works only while sill at less effectiveness.   How could they balance all those gems properly and defenses when monsters were all rebalanced, new monsters/bosses added some of which they didnt even realize how strong (malachai), defenses modified, many uniques, unique rarity tiers, core mechanics  all changed.   How do you balance while changing nearly everything? Why attempt at that point?"

pathofexile,3e1fjl,DRHST,10,Tue Jul 21 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"They also decided to fuck up (again) with mana leech.  How many times was GGG told that they need to fucking separate life leech changes from mana leech ?  In the past,when leveling an attack build that dealt decent phys dmg in a shity 3-4 link you simply had to get 1-2% mana leech on gear,now you cant do that anymore since they nerfed the shit out of % percentage,almost all attack builds atm when leveling are FORCED to use BM or Mana Leech gem.  Biggest offenders are single target tanky mobs (rares/bosses),because even if your character is near nodes like Revelry (which solves the issue of early mana needs),you will run out of mana instantly since they are not enough targets to hit.Same for leech since now it does jack shit vs single target.  Not to mention that the mana leech found on gear/jewels/passives is almost entirely physical leech,and GGG has pushed almost all ""physical"" attack builds into conversion and doing massive amounts of ele,so until you are endgame with high amount of phys dmg leech does jack shit.  You have items like this which turned from one of the best leveling items in the game for attack builds into utter shit,i was level 42 yesterday and couldn't even sustain a 3 link attack with a full phys skill with no conversion.  A joke."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,1gnominious,5,Tue Jul 21 07:33:13 2015 UTC,"This is the one change that really irked me.  I'm actually fine with the damage in high level maps since I built for a ton of avoidance.  But low level mana leech?  Fuck that noise.  It's really, really bad for DW builds with their fast attack speed.  Even with a 6 base cost reave, 0.4% from using claws, and a 3 link I was having to guzzle from 2 mana flasks constantly.  I wanted to try wild strike but I literally could not keep it going early on even with the spirit void cluster.    It was horrible for most of the game, but now that I'm pushing out 20K physical dps mana is back to being a non issue.  I just use the 0.4% I get from claws and that's more than enough.  I could probably get away with a single 0.2% source or using a skill with converted damage now.  On top of the innate problems with leech you have the fact that lower difficulties have fewer mobs.  This severely compounds the problem as you're hitting fewer targets and making your already shitty leech shittier.  That's fine for life leech but for mana it's stupid."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Vulpix0r,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm here to tank all the downvotes I'm going to get for posting something that disagrees with most of what is said here. Now that's out of the way, I'm just going to mention that I have played many builds during the beta, which had worse spike damage, completely self found and I had no access to poe.trade, with the occasional trade from the god awful trade chat.  I've played 2 casters, a ball lightning, arctic breath build both to 74 maps in the beta, and I didn't get this ""one-shot"" claim people keep talking about. No, the archers even with powerful crit never one shot me in Dried Lake or in maps. For both builds I went hybrid, so even the worst volley of fire from them, I still had life remaining with 6k EHP life/es. Since AA wasn't going to help, I looked at other ways of avoiding damage. I found decoy and flame totem + blind to be extremely effective in stopping damage from coming my way, and I was able to survive till 73-74 maps in the beta, with the occasional dumb death from Devourers. Casters can no longer just sit there and facetank shit, they will need to figure out how to stop damage from touching you. Before you ask, I never had cwdt or endurance charges, not even Fortify.  I made an acrobatics evasion character claw reaver in another wipe, and I got to around 72-73 maps. Via the use of decoy totem, I figured out how to use the totem to distract the dangerous ranged guys, like those gladiators that throw shit at you, while I go ham on the melee guys after cursing them with Warlord's Mark. It took a bit but I somehow made it to maps with this style of play. For the really dangerous guys, I kept an enfeeble gem to deal with them. Sure, I occasionally took that dangerous spike of damage, but I've always had the option to whirl away to recover my health with an instant life flask, and dropping a totem to get shit away from me.  Is everyone here dying to 1 hit all in 76+ maps or something already? I'll be up front and mention I don't have any 75+ map yet in live, but I haven't been one shot yet, other than from Malachai in normal mode. If the argument everyone here is making is referring to late game map physical damage, then I guess my points doesn't really make sense. I also have this feeling most people here in this thread haven't even gotten to that map level too. Both my characters haven't died other than from bullshit damage from Malachai before nerf.  From what I have observed, late map monster damage needs some serious tuning and turning down, but the rest of the content so far? It's been fine so far other than maybe 1 or 2 that needs some adjustment."
pathofexile,3e1fjl,Radiofall,4,Tue Jul 21 09:12:49 2015 UTC,"The damage jump from 74's to 75's and 76's is completly through the roof.  I'm a level 87 SRS Hybrid caster with something like 7700 combined HP in Warbands and Physical damage is 3 shotting me in 75's and up. And I'm not talking about Giant Skeletons or other ""obvious"" damage sources I'm talking about random white mobs and archers.  With no leech mechanis to my name this means a lot of running away and waiting for my ES to recharge.  I'm at a point where I just don't know what the hell GGG wants from me as a non leeching top tree caster who reserves a lot of his mana. AA makes almost not difference in damage taken, there is no mitigation I can use since I don't have the mana for MoM or the passives/sick nasty ES/armour gear for armour.  I just have to stack my hybrid life into the 10k's and still get killed in 5 hits by about every mob in the game because the damage is just so absurd."

Ice Spear (w/ 55% pierce) is the one on live, sitting at 4.6k/2.2k ES. I got stunlocked and died on a 74 map, wasn't insanely rolled but had some extra damage, yet it was to A4 lava dogs (that go under ground) and an A4 devourer thingie that shoots.  Residence 76 heavily rolled without A4 mobs? No problem! Even Dominus was easier."

Totem   Being able to make all kind of mistake(face tank) and totally can't afford to make a single mistake(perfect play) are only the extreme end. There are in between scenario too.  So basically what the complaints are is the degree of careful play is at an unhealthy level. Remember there is a video where someone actually beat Atziri with 1 max HP. It can be done doesn't mean it is ok for game to be balance that way.  You are dropping totems, others are shooting poison arrow and I am summoning RS. Is the game really fine?

I'm in Warbands where death ""doesn't matter"" and I rerolled because I felt unsafe doing dual Flame Totem. What?! Now I have an RT Cyclone Marauder with 7 endurance charges that's going to stack nearly 200% life just like everyone else who wants to actually stay alive/gain experience at endgame.

pathofexile,3e2ddp,PianoOwl,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"Go to Steam Library, right click PoE -> Properties -> Set launch options. There you just put the --nopreload and then you start the game."
pathofexile,3e2ddp,smartestBeaver,0,Tue Jul 21 15:42:30 2015 UTC,"So it only works on the steam version of the game then? shame, I don't use steam for poe :("
pathofexile,3e2ddp,PianoOwl,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, it works without steam too. Just right click the poe.exe, go to properties and again and then just add it behind the ""target"" field."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,a1s2d3f4g5-h6j7k8l9,32,Tue Jul 21 03:03:02 2015 UTC,We are also working on a 2.0.1 content update that introduces more content for both Warbands and Tempest   I assume 2.0.1 is when we'll finally get the Generals for Warbands. We've slaughtered the Lieutenants long enough already. I also expect a lot of people will get absolutely destroyed since they've become complacent and view Warbands as too easy.
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Ajido,12,Tue Jul 21 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"And 2.0.1 is probably when they introduce Beyond and Invasion tempests, where a random Beyond or Invasion boss is summoned."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,GoodIdea321,6,Tue Jul 21 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"A Beyond tempest would be awesome, where any mobs killed drop Beyond blobs in the usual way. So much juicy xp."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,blindsight,3,Tue Jul 21 05:35:55 2015 UTC,Why didn't they put stuff like this in the main game after it's all said and done? We have these amazing mechanics and you can only use them in very narrow places (map modifier). Doesn't make sense to me
pathofexile,3e0zgc,jaykeith,3,Tue Jul 21 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have the stable Internet connection to dare play hardcore, but when they allowed Beyond to be a map mod it was probably the most exciting one a map could roll. Thinking how people had a league where beyond applied universally seems awesome."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,T3hSwagman,5,Tue Jul 21 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly have way more fun playing beyond maps than any other mod.  The beyond mobs feel very balanced. You have to play careful, but they're also rewarding. They don't typically cheese you down in one shot... there's time to react but they're still formidable.  So fun!"
pathofexile,3e0zgc,topazsparrow,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Beyond's certainly my favourite league I've had a chance to play (played softcore during domination/nemsis, switched to HC during beyond because rampage sucked).   To speculate why it's not in the main game: aside from just the insane amount of shit new players have to deal with already, beyond could get pretty tiresome when leveling, especially if your build was weak for a few levels, or you had bad luck gearing. Beyond is at its best when you're not trying to get through content, and actually have the time to kill the mobs, so a map mod was a decent decision.   That said, it'd be fun if corrupted zones, or certain side zones (like the Dread Thicket) had permanent beyond. It'd add a bit of spice to them."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,ComradBlack,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:17 2015 UTC,Haast and Abaxoth every time :D
pathofexile,3e0zgc,ashcroftt,3,Tue Jul 21 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"Haast is -very slightly- (and I do mean barely 1%) easier now that he can't shotgun, at least for melee. What we tend to do is engage him, fight until potions run out as leech is useless, go kill some other mobs nearby to gain pot charges, and repeat. If you're lucky, by the time you've killed Haast, all the monsters you killed beside him to gain pot charges will spawn another Haast!"

pathofexile,3e0zgc,Cadwae,5,Tue Jul 21 04:01:25 2015 UTC,"I reckon if it's anything, it's probably some fuck up with how they're loading in MTX of the other players.  I have great internet and a strong gaming rig, but I have my PoE stuff stored on a regular old HDD and not a SSD, so that makes me think that's where the problem is.  Either way I'm excited for this fix, because it's especially bad in Act 4."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Jaikaro,23,Tue Jul 21 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Today we wanted to show what our short-term production schedule looks like in terms of upcoming updates to Path of Exile. There are a variety of changes planned for the next few weeks that fix problems, adjust stuff that is too difficult and introduce new content.     Database server upgrades yesterday have finally fixed a problem where players were getting dropped at peak times. The changes late last week helped, but now no one is getting disconnected at all due to database load.    We are working hard on a fix to people being disconnected from maps when there are too many entity updates. This will be deployed as soon as it is ready.     There's a small balance patch (2.0.0g) coming in the next few days that has the goals of:     Based on over a week of gameplay data, reducing the difficulty of the end of Act Four Normal some more.   Improving the drop rate of Warbands members. We will probably also extend the time they stay in any particular map to an hour, so that they can be farmed more.   Various balance fixes to Tempest, such as nerfing the Abyssal Tempest. Tempests will also display correctly in Maps.   Reducing/removing loading spikes that occur when players appear next to you.      We are also working on a 2.0.1 content update that introduces more content for both Warbands and Tempest, among many other changes. We're aiming this at late next week.    We've listened to plenty of other feedback so there are lots of cool things being worked on that I can't confirm just yet. There are also problems people have discussed that we are working on fixes for - you'll either see those in the patch notes or I'll mention them in the news once I know for sure the fix is ready."

pathofexile,3e0zgc,BrianTheWizard,5,Tue Jul 21 04:01:02 2015 UTC,Normal Mala is tougher than Merc Dom.
pathofexile,3e0zgc,tehlemmings,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just due to the way the game progresses, I'd actually agree with that.  Merc dom is challenging, but you're at a point where you can face him and you have the tools at your disposal to win.  Normal Mala is fucking hard as hell and you barely have any tools to live, as well as no indication that A4 is going to be THAT much harder than A3"
pathofexile,3e0zgc,rootb33r,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"Normal Mala is fucking hard as hell and you barely have any tools to live   And that's if you're ranged.  If you're melee, fuck you ten times over."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,I_H8_Rogues,3,Tue Jul 21 10:12:57 2015 UTC,I'm trying out a wild strike build. Got to 2nd phase of Mala and ended up asking a friend to kill for me. Hitting once or twice and then running for 5-6 seconds is not my thing.
pathofexile,3e0zgc,rootb33r,2,Tue Jul 21 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I helped a friend last night too.    My first char was Ice crash- I hated all act 4 bosses.  His 2nd char is Reave- he hates all act 4 bosses.  I helped him last night with my ball lightning witch, and I found all A4 bosses to be infinitely easier."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,tehlemmings,-7,Tue Jul 21 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"Or a summoner, in which case you better switch to flame totem or you're not allowed to progress"
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Zoroch,5,Tue Jul 21 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"I dunno I think being melee has been easier overall, including A4 bosses.   I also feel they aren't that hard anymore now that the novelty has worn off. They were hard before I knew how they worked but they're alright now."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,rootb33r,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Really?  The only melee build I have seen that has a good time with A4 bosses is cyclone.    I was ice crash and I despised the fights in A4 because your ""window"" for damage was so small.  You spend most of your time running around."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,vitrael2,0,Tue Jul 21 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, Nightmare Malachai was easier than Normal Malachai, and Merciless Act 1-3 was a complete, laughable cakewalk compared to either Malachai encounter."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,KoboldCommando,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"This is the real problem if you ask me.  Not only is the tonal shift from Act 4 to the next difficulty jarring, but the difficulty curve is all out of whack.  To me it felt like Dominus was a nice climax and yet the next difficulty was still a bit intimidating, since things will change a bit and you'll be more vulnerable.  Now, after the crucible of Act 4, barring a few levels and some token equipment rearrangement, you're pretty much ready for late Act 3 of the next difficulty already, so the rest of the game feels an awful lot like busywork.  Hopefully they're working on smoothing out the difficulty of Acts 1-3 to account for Act 4, and something to ease that transition from doing battle with a nightmarish godlike monstrosity within a mountain-sized beast with mutations and horrors at every turn to BOOP, waking up on a plain-ass beach and stabbing shambling zombies who really don't want your brains, but eh, they're feeling a little peckish so whatever."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,rangda66,3,Tue Jul 21 07:09:07 2015 UTC,"IMO this is a bit of revisionist history, back in the days of 1.0 I and all my friends always found A1 of the next difficulty a joke compared to Dom.  It's not as bad now because 1) the fight was toned down a bit after initial release and 2) we've done it so often we have the mechanics down."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,tehlemmings,0,Tue Jul 21 14:15:08 2015 UTC,That point comes up a lot and every other person ignores the fact that the other bosses have undergone complete re-works or heavy balancing changes.    Thank you for not ignoring that.
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Zarathustraa,5,Tue Jul 21 15:05:38 2015 UTC,A lot of it probably has to do with power creep of new skill/support gems over the years making old act content (1-3) unable to keep up.  Normal is the most time consuming and pain in the ass because you don't have that many gems and links yet. By the end of cruel you're rocking crazy supports and skills that didn't exist when they balanced act 1-3
pathofexile,3e0zgc,xxDamnationxx,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:00 2015 UTC,"Cruel Malachai easier than Normal Malachai? You crazy, man."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,PyleWarLord,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:58:35 2015 UTC,"for me and my armour/hp character Cruel fight was easier, just because there are so huge difference having level 55 gear than level 35...basically all my important stats were more than doubled on Cruel, but seems that Mala's hp/damage is not."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,rangda66,12,Tue Jul 21 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"I actually found cruel Malachai much easier.  Both normal and cruel seemed to hit for vaguely the same damage, but the extra tools provided by the additional levels make the fight more manageable.  I found normal Malachai to be by far the hardest fight in the game through A3M simply because at level 38-40 you don't have nearly enough survival tools available to you to handle the fight."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,grimdarkdavey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"I hope GGG tunes up Cruel and Merciless to be more in line with the challenge of normal.  Malachai shouldn't be nerfed, the rest of the game should be made consistently harder, just so act 4 isn't such a spike."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Sakuyalzayoi,10,Tue Jul 21 07:06:35 2015 UTC,"Thing is that normal is really only hard because your gear is all crap.

pathofexile,3e0zgc,Quazifuji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Merc dom is challenging, but you're at a point where you can face him and you have the tools at your disposal to win.   This is definitely a big part of it.  A well-build merc character has a lot of things ""solved"".  They probably have tons of life leech or regen, they've got flasks to handle any status effect, they've got a mobility skill linked to things that make it faster for good dodging, they probably never have to think about mana, etc.  A normal character will often not be ""solved"" yet.  Their flask collection likely consists of some health and mana flasks (there's a good chance they still rely on mana flasks to keep their skills going) and a quicksilver, if they have mobility it might not be linked for optimal speed, their resists might not be capped, etc.  And most of the game is really a measure of how well you've ""solved"" these problems.  The vast majority of acts 1-3 in merciless can be face-tanked or kited without trouble by a well-built merciless character, so they challenge they offer is limited.  The fact that monsters are so much strong in merc is often offset by the fact that your character is hugely stronger as well.  The exception is some bosses with attacks powerful enough that even a strong build can facetank them.  These fights tend to be the hardest, because you need a certain amount of mechanical skill to dodge their attacks no matter how strong you character is.  The thing with these fights is that the mechanics don't change hugely with difficulty.  Sure, there are changes - Malachai's AoEs hit a bigger area, Marveil gets more minions, etc - but generally, they're not huge.  Malachai is, hands-down, the most mechanically intensive boss in the game, with the possible exception of Atziri.  And since mechanics don't change much with difficulty, this means normal Malachai is still more mechanically intensive than any non-Malachai boss on Cruel or Merc.  This means that, if your character stays strong enough throughout every difficulty to easily handle any fight that doesn't absolutely require strong mechanics to win, normal Malachai will be the third hardest non-map boss in the game because he requires the third most intense mechanics."

pathofexile,3e0zgc,k4melot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"If you consider that ""not bad"" you are pretty strange. These were supposed to help solo/self-found players.  The cards should be much more common, but the amount needed should also be higher, that way it feels a lot more like ""collecting"" instead of just separate, rarer version of the item."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Falcon_Kick,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"How often do you get a tabula over any amount of time? Setting out to get a specific (arguably somewhat useful too) unique and getting it in under a week seems quick to me. Not to mention that wasn't even the focus of what I was doing, just leveling safely to get out of cruel difficulty"
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Zarathustraa,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"So you farmed like 20-30c worth of an item in 4 days? Ouch.  I get that they allow self found but self found was not the focal purpose of those cards  Problem is that farming cards feel very unrewarding because the areas they are farmed will usually yield less loot than running random maps, even if you get the card from the area, so there's not much incentive to farm those areas specifically.  Now people just get cards randomly from doing random maps which happen to have different cards. This defeats the purpose of div cards encouraging farming specific areas vs random rng."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,PyleWarLord,4,Tue Jul 21 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"so you are saying that tabula/3 days is bad? on the last league i had 0 tabula's in ~700 hours or so.  IMO the rates should be balanced so that you get what you want, if you spend most of the league find it...or get lucky  :D Cards should stay as a nice bonus from mapping."
pathofexile,3e0zgc,Zarathustraa,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"But you can buy a tabula after farming maps for only a few hours, get good exp, and build map pool all at the same time. Yeah you can't as self found but the main goal of cards was not to help self found, it only was a side goal."

I grinded up to 44 with what I thought was a reasonably decent build, only to get 1-hit by Malachai @ level 44 repeatedly.  I ended up passing the quest in a group of other 40-somethings though, so there's that.  It's much more fun leveling up while doing quests instead of passing through the arena over and over to fight monsters 4-5 levels under me.  I'm really enjoying the game though, so thanks for all your work.

Various balance fixes to Tempest, such as nerfing the Abyssal Tempest. Tempests will also display correctly in Maps.   I really do not like that. This is kind of GGG style...bring out new content way too hard and nerf it 'till it doesen't matter anymore...I mean I am just a casual player playing some hours in the week and some more in the weekend...but as a HC player I love that there are situations where you need to be careful or you die really fast. I did not die once to normal Malachi even before his first nerf...and I am not a really skilled player!! But please don't make normal Malachi like normal Dom where, doesen't matter what you do or at what point your character is, you will beat him anyway because he is so unchallenging. Or like in Invasion where 95 % of the bosses were just like trash mobs with more life after all the nerfs...I mean it's a HC league it must be challenging or there is no fun!  Don't get me wrong, I am a GGG Fanboy and most of the time think 'it's their game and if they want this change they can do it...Chris know what he is doin' :D' and 99% of the time they know what they do (everyone does mistakes sometimes :P)! But sometimes I wish GGG would be more consequent with their changes and not defer to all the haters that are just salty because they can't faceroll content...i mean just imagine you have to dodge attacks from bosses or position smart to not die...awful/s  I don't know the data you have gathered but please if you want your game to be more challenging like you said while beta then please keep it up and let the people deal with it!

Not too many passive changes needed, but you could prioritize 2 defensive jewels instead of offensive ones. And if you wanted to go a bit further you could drop some damage nodes and get Duelist start life nodes (or maybe even the Scion wheel).  It's without question possible to play dual wield reave in Hardcore. But it's the sort of skill and playstyle that really shines when you can be a little more reckless and a little faster. Like driving a sports car in traffic all day - you can do it but it'll be a little frustrating and the temptation to speed will be there. Probably better off with a model that better rewards a more defensive playstyle."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,SisterShaniqua,2,Tue Jul 21 09:07:58 2015 UTC,"Ok cheers, are there any repositories for hardcore builds, I've looked in the character forums for the build lists but at least 90% of them are softcore and the ones that are hardcore are summoner/totem based :(  I feel like there's a stash of current builds out there that my google fu is completely missing"
pathofexile,3e0wqo,Tempada,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:51 2015 UTC,Most people are still in the process of creating and updating their builds for 2.0. But most streamers that play hardcore have guides for the builds they play.

pathofexile,3e0wqo,xaitv,4,Tue Jul 21 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, I think I was the one who originally suggested putting the brightbeak on the mainhand and a sword on the offhand. The purpose of that suggestion was to exploit brightbeak's huge local increased attack speed mod so you can leap slam around at high speeds. However, now that you're using whirling blades for movement, and are using a Death's Hand (which has no local ias), there's no reason to put the sceptre in your mainhand and your reave weapon in your offhand.  Edit: looking at the tree, the Ambidexterity notable in the south of the tree has a huge attack speed boost for the offhand. The way ""increased"" scaling works, 20% increased attack speed on top of 78% increased attack speed from other nodes, is proportionally more valuable than 26% increased attack damage on top of 300+% increased damage from nodes. That might be the reason for going southpaw."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,JonDum,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Leapslam was changed to the original reason for southpaw, the namesake of the build no longer exists. However, it's still the southpaw build in spirit and it certainly doesn't cause any problems to put sword in offhand. It's even likely better when you pickup ambidexterity."

pathofexile,3e0wqo,_flea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:51 2015 UTC,That's true! We had considered it but dismissed it as too expensive at the time of making the character. Since then I had forgot about it as an option.
pathofexile,3e0wqo,LiquorQuickly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:27 2015 UTC,"I've seen it done a long time ago.  http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/782347  Now that auras have a relatively higher reservation cost, Soul Takers could be extremely useful for 100+% reservation builds. And the relatively low DPS of Soul Takers can be made up for with non-axe skills.  Soul Takers have plummeted in price ever since the 1.2 mana changes. I'm seeing non-legs for 7ex or so on Standard.  Edit: Concretely, ST would let you fit Herald of Ash for a 15% More multiplier on your physical damage. It would also free up 7 or so passives into mana sustain. The downside is you get less reliable power charge sustain, and you lose Unholy Might for 30% More on your physical."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,NickCarpathia,4,Tue Jul 21 10:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yes! Soul Taker is the way to go in the current meta when you dual wield. Mana sustain is such a pain in the ass, you save a bunch of points on the tree, and you can reserve all mana. Even the cheapest ST will do."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,iDecibel,2,Tue Jul 21 10:46:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that ST is an option but I actually think it's a poor one, especially given the price.  You actually only save three nodes (spirit void is all that is needed to run mana on a build like this - and even then you can actually drop spirit void if you get a mana on hit jewels and one mana leech roll on jewellery). And it's basically Herald of Ash (15% phys scaling) vs 100% uptime on Unholy Might (30% phys scaling). And then Death's Hand also gives you 100% power charge sustain.  ST certainly has some benefits and if Death's Hand becomes much more expensive than it then it could become a viable option but in terms of effectiveness Death's Hand is a clear winner."

I know using two swords would allow reave to alternate weapons during cast, and your build focuses on just using one weapon. But do you think the bonuses per socket make up for it?  Also since you pick up all the frenzy charge nodes, what do you think of a pair of snakebites instead of maligaros?"
pathofexile,3e0wqo,Xasrai,3,Tue Jul 21 03:38:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen people use Prismatic Eclipse on their offhand, mainhand a mace/sceptre, and use a non-sword attack like Ground Slam. I think Ghudda had a build like that."

pathofexile,3e0wqo,Ajido,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:36:55 2015 UTC,In the video the tooltip was 24k. Does the tooltip not reflect reave's actual damage?

pathofexile,3e0wqo,crazyjacan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:07:54 2015 UTC,"Just for extra clarification, is the tooltip accurate when the main or offhand weapon is not being used at all for the skill?"

But the tooltip isn't impacted by the dps of the weapon not used by reave. I often hear the tooltip on dual wield is below what it should be displaying but I am not familiar enough with how it works as I never really pay much attention to tooltips - I much prefer just testing on mobs."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,crazyjacan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:09 2015 UTC,I still think shadow beats this.

pathofexile,3e0wqo,SSmajesty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have been more verbose.  I ran a shadow/dagger adaptation of your southpaw in BLD, and it, like your new version, has gotten better with 2.0.  It's more expensive, but I think it might top out a little higher, and the ease of critting much earlier means you can run surgeon's flasks as early as you like, making levelling an autoplay kinda game.  (Plus, the Shadow's snarkier)."
pathofexile,3e0wqo,metaphorm,0,Tue Jul 21 10:24:53 2015 UTC,So your argument is basically 1) can go crit while leveling (which people rarely do) 2) you like his voice acting.

Planned it from beta and went with it. On the offensive side difference is that I use claws for better leeching purpouses (swords should be more efficient on dmg/pathing), but still use Death's Hand.  We want way different ways on the defensive side tho, Abyssus and 3.8k life is a very bad idea to do right now mapping. You can get a lot of HP/defenses (Sitting on 4.8kHP with LC) and still not losing major damage (32.7k 5L reave with auras only).  Oh, and since you are running with a Death's Hand you may want to swap HoI with Ass Mark, as it's VERY good for generating power charges but very weak for actual cursing. HoT would be better for cursing, or you can go for HoA for extra damage and defensively curse on both CWDT+TC/Enfeeble and manual TC/Enfeeble for bosses.  Overall it's a very solid build, but I'd build it way more defensively considering the current status of high maps :)  Thanks for the guide!"

He could give missions such as bringing back rare treasures for him to sell, deliver items for him into dangerous areas, go kill people who has scammed him in a trade, etc.  At level 2 he would offer to become your personal trader, i.e. joining your hideout and act as a npc that sells items for your specified prices. Further leveling could increase the number of items you can sell (up to a few tabs), allow you to sell for higher currency, or reduce a potential fee the trades npc takes.  It would probably need to be integrated with your regular stash in some way so you dont get extra inventory space for free by putting up items for way too high prices."

pathofexile,3e0ohp,Mudkip123456,8,Tue Jul 21 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"GGG didn't interpret it correctly (or it was a fundamentally different idea) if that's the case. At its very core, this is essentially the shop threads on the official PoE forums, except this would be built into the game. In fact, if poe.trade couldn't index these hideout shops providing all sellers and buyers near infinite knowledge of the market, there's not going to be drastic reduction of market friction compared to...well, poe.trade.  I imagine that a lot of the people entering your hideout shop may be competitors scoping out the scene. Or I imagine stumbling into someone's little known shop and nabbing some great deals. I really believe a trading implementation such as this brings PoE closer to that bartering flea market type of feel that GGG says they want."
pathofexile,3e0ohp,Kilvoctu,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"No, I believe they did interpret it correctly for this case. Forums are different in that you have to browse through many shop threads to find the item you need, there is no item filtering (this was made obsolete by poe.trade but thats not a GGG feature)  An automatic hideout shop would be just that, automatic. If you could search for the item you wanted in any way then  boom market friction gone.  Unless you meant no searching at all and a Maplestory FM type shop (no owls) in which case you're completely right"
pathofexile,3e0ohp,Mudkip123456,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:08 2015 UTC,Apparently GGG still want to go with their original ideas about trade but they've been awfully quiet about it for ages.

If you have a system where I can view a b/o, put in the currency, and immediately get the item with no person on the other side of a trade interface, this will create an auction house.  GGG is specifically worried about the pricing rigidity that an AH will create when players can view exactly the prices that an item has gone for in order to very slightly undersell.  So if you take away the instant buyouts, then what you have is nothing more than an inferior version of poe.trade, which is why this was never implemented."

Dealing with asshats is annoying.  Window shopping is fun.  PoE's lack of any trading mechanism at all is exactly what made me quit the game previously and I'm sure will wear on me and make me stop again until something else new and big changes.  I've never had a 6L.  I've only had a single 5L worth anything (Quill Rain) that I linked myself.  I have a mediocre evasion/armor 5L chest armor that gets shared to any character that makes it far enough to wear it.  I don't want to spend my free time spamming and trying to trade items.  Trying to not get ripped off, or getting berated for not knowing something obscure is not entertaining in the slightest to me.  I want to play the actual game.

The result is usually that trading becomes easier, but the market is homogenized, and the social aspect of trading is diminished/removed."
pathofexile,3e0ohp,Kilvoctu,-7,Tue Jul 21 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"However, plenty of games in the past have tried to streamline their trading system, main examples being Runescape and Diablo 3 from what I can remember. The result is usually that trading becomes easier, but the market is homogenized, and the social aspect of trading is diminished/removed.   I totally agree with you, the Auction house system in both RS and D3 ruined trading. But I am suggesting more of a system that uses the same mechanics as their party board and forum system. People can just advertise a brief summary of what they have in their store as the title, or a more in depth on the forum. Then people can go to their hideout and use the shop. They can still whisper the player to barter with them if they think a price is unreasonable, or they might even run into the player in their hideout. But it keeps the player active, your moving around, checking out stores/hideouts, whispering users, checking party boards.. its more interactive and social than an AH.  I 100% agree with you that making a full streamline auction house system would hurt the game. But I also think that making the process a bit easier and fully in game would be much more enjoyable.   I could spend all day visiting everyone's beautifully designed hideouts looking at what gear they have found and finding what I want for a reasonable price. Would be much more enjoyable than scrolling through poe.trade for an hour or two, to only find the user AFK or the item already sold."
pathofexile,3e0ohp,foxy--boxes,6,Tue Jul 21 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"These reasons are why I like this idea. People are worried about an auction house and such ruining trading, but seem to forget that in practice poe.trade is really damn close to an auction house.   Something like this hideout shop allows GGG to keep players actively in the game (instead of alt-tabbed out) and hopefully mitigate a pet peeve of mine, which is wading through endless listings for crap at the party board when I'm trying to find a party.   Also,  the notion that I could be hanging in my hideout and occasionally seeing a ""customer"" quite excites me. Just some form of activity in there other than a large number of Weta pets skittering about."

pathofexile,3dz9ar,Ryant12,10,Mon Jul 20 20:13:20 2015 UTC,He slams 2.0 more than a couple times.   Good for him.  Most of his observations are spot on.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,jaredheath,5,Mon Jul 20 19:45:31 2015 UTC,He does make good points but I think it's worth noting that his overall impression is a positive one. He had a lot of fun playing this expansion even if some things aren't perfect yet.  I'd like to hope that's how most of us feel.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,Rackam,9,Mon Jul 20 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"He's absolutely wrong about a few things too, though, which is surprising. I guess he's been gone awhile and hasn't played enough with all the new mechanics to have a really informed opinion of it, IMO. Just as an example: he said that melee is still pretty bad and he used Helman dying to Malachai's first attack (the infamous rip vid) as evidence of that.   Didn't give any extra context, or mention the fact that it was a slam that Helman said himself he could easily have dodged, and simply wasn't mentally prepared for the fight. Kripp was also judging the difficulty of the act 4 content based on an admitted glass cannon character that made no effort to spec into any defenses. Granted, most people agree the malachai fight needed to be nerfed, but Cruel was the most egregious, and Merc Malachai was certainly not evidence of melee being bad.   Melee can do that fight every bit as well as a ranged character, ranged and melee are equally vulnerable to the smash phase 2, and in phase 1, it's only a frontal AOE so you only have to take a couple steps to avoid it if you're in melee range (as opposed to having to leap out of range as with some AOE's). Fortify is just a huge boon to melee in general as well, it really can't be overstated how huge it is for helping bridge the melee/ranged divide.   I like Kripp, and do not begrudge the HS thing he has going, I'm just saying that his analysis of 2.0, especially concerning balance, has to be taken with a pinch of salt (or rather, not given any more weight than anyone else) given that he's no longer aspiring to learn everything about the game and master its mechanics. Not trying to insult the guy, it just caught me off guard when I realized Kripp is no longer POE's guru."
pathofexile,3dz9ar,Jihok,3,Tue Jul 21 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"didn't he actual say that they (ggg) really tried to improve the melee , but that it in his opinion really didn't work , and that melee is doing fine but not much better than in the past), but that Casters was made alot worse. .. I am just pointing out that while he for sure is not an up to date POE guru, i found his analyze pretty good !"
pathofexile,3dz9ar,jondifool,-16,Tue Jul 21 11:14:00 2015 UTC,"Technically (GGG) said they tried to improve melee , they are on record saying 2.0 would be path of melee.  but outside of cyclone and its unique mechanics we simply aren't seeing that."
pathofexile,3dz9ar,saltychipmunk,17,Tue Jul 21 14:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think he was more making the point that an ultra tanky character got one shot by what is essentially not even remotely close to the hardest boss in the game ( because maps exist). and when just a level 70 boss takes a dump on an ultra tanky character . one can draw many  conclusions about everything else.  A tanky character should be able to tank. if a tank gets one shot like everyone else .. why bother being a tank?  That is the issue  here I think.  because there are so many things in the game that make being the tank pointless ... the tank (which is what melee tends to have to be)  is just a fundamentally inferior build concept.  The best defense will always be  the one that gets hit the least , which is probably also why cyclone is so good , being able to attack and move is just as good a defensive mechanic as it is an offensive one   This is also why bow builds are so darn powerful right now.  dont tank , off screen. the same tried and true boss cheese strat still works  and works better than ever.  All the while  everything else just got worse.   saying ranged and melee are equally vulnerable to the smash or are equally capable of completing the fight is silly, only one of those builds need be in  smash ranged to do damage in the first place.  The amount of times a smash would prove dangerous is far less for a ranged build than it is  for a melee build. that is just common sense.   melee is at a huge disadvantage in that regard"

They shit on developers because their net/computer sucks or something new has a bug or they're incapable of figuring out why something was nerfed (or discussing their opinion on it in a mature manner, again).   There is a big reason I don't have to scold people constantly on the official forums or become incredibly irritable when reading them: the forums have reasonable and strictly enforced rules, there is no silly voting, there is a higher proportion of players who are willing to listen and think about what others say.

pathofexile,3dz9ar,Treebranch1,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"What?  That's... not... right at all.  The Malachai fight isn't about levels.  Its about pattern recognition and maneuvering.  The fight requires thought, not brute force.  The first time I did Malachai I got wrecked repeatedly.  Same story for the rest of the bosses in Act 4.  But now that I know their patterns its just not even an issue.  The Piety fight is the biggest example of this -- the encounter goes from impossible to near-damageless once you figure out her tells and where to stand.  And I'm playing self-found, for chrissakes.  I didn't get a 4-link until Merciless.  Dunno what to say.  Anyone who is trying to brute force their way through Act 4 is just playing the game wrong.

pathofexile,3dz9ar,Tyrrrz,19,Tue Jul 21 03:13:34 2015 UTC,Act 1 to 3 is a joke   Couldn't agree more. It's really annoying that the progression is so uneven in terms of difficulty. Probably my biggest gripe about 2.0. I'd rather they would tone down the damage in act4 and spread it around in previous acts.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,czulki,8,Mon Jul 20 23:18:27 2015 UTC,I tend to agree. The hardest part though of act 4 are the bosses.. Regular mobs are still fairly reasonable in terms of toughness.  But definitely the gap between the acts is indeed very obvious.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,Overclocked11,9,Mon Jul 20 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"I don't mind really. It's like this in most games with multiple difficulty settings, it's just that most games don't have you progress  from easy to medium to hard difficulty. Those games instead make you restart on a different difficulty (or start at a harder difficulty without playing easy first).  Let's take Quake as an example: last boss on easy difficulty is harder than episode 1 map 1 on hardest difficulty. Or take a team game like Killing Floor: the boss on easy is harder than the first wave on hard."

pathofexile,3dz9ar,kylerson,4,Mon Jul 20 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"AA got turned into an atrocious waste of mana for all but incinerate and even for them it's quite shit, nobody stands still to take damage and it is very little mitigation, like 13% or so at level 20.  EB no longer enables AA since it reserves mana and with MoM it only works if you give up life regen or life leech and either way it's terrible.  So your only real option left as a caster is Hybrid and if you don't need the auras, 1 aura and MoM can work, but with those two together you're still not even remotely as tanky as melee is, and you're gonna run out of mana a lot due to the lack of regen that EB used to provide.  People like to parrot the idea that GGG improved build diversity with this because EB was a ""no brainer"" (strange how there was CI, low life and plenty of hybrid builds though isn't it) but there never was much diversity in defences, and honestly casters had the most options, you had armour, evasion, ES (low life, ci and hybrid) and the MoM/AA, all they've done is remove an option, something that was optional but now that mob damage was buffed in maps and we are forced to run harder map mods to sustain even 73 maps, hybrid by itself just don't cut it anymore. So casters are lacking a lot of damage mitigation."
pathofexile,3dz9ar,oBLACKIECHANoo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"I respecced an SRS char that used AA+EB+MoM previously and the best solution I found was to out-DPS everything and skele totem walk if you have leapers/chargers in the map. It turns out it is pretty easy to just run Hatred+Wrath+Generosity, and Haste+Clarity and kill everything before they get to you.  This can only be done with crit cold spells though if you are a traditional caster, self cast/CoC is just not as safe anymore if you don't one shot everything, whatever you do.

Then you wait for the player demographics to play -- probably late evening, you have less casual / semi-hardcore players -- those who might be able to put that exalt to use and have a decent supply of chaos but since they're not super hardcore players and are playing semi-seriously but also for funzies, they don't care about paying 30 chaos for an exalt instead of spamming trade chat for an hour to get it for 29 chaos instead. They don't care about one or two chaos one way or the other. So you sell the Exalt to that player and bam, two chaos profit. Repeat with dozens of Exalts you bought early that evening.  You also do similar things with chaos / fuse / alts or any combo of three relatively fungible currencies, finding areas where the ratios aren't quite fully logical (look up arbitrage, but as an example consider currencies A, B, and C. It so happens that you can generally trade two Bs for one A. You can also trade 12 Cs for one A or 7Cs for a B. Those just happen to be the ratios that people trade and sell for. No big deal, right? But there's a huge opportunity for arbitrage there. In a perfectly rational world, it would only take 6 Cs for a B, since it takes 12 Cs for an A. So because of this, you get an ""extra"" C every time you trade a B for Cs. So you take your Bs, get Cs, trade those for As, and turn those into Bs. Repeat as much as possible, and you profit one C for every cycle. Do that 12 times and you've profited an entire A).  I'm too lazy to do that now, but damn did I used to profit like mad whenever the D2 ladder reset and high runes were overpriced compared to Ists. It was even more profitable there, since several lower runes could be transformed into a higher rune, allowing you to cut out a middleman. Get a bunch of Ists, cube some into an Ohm, sell a CTA runeset for huge profit (since Ohms were so rare), repeat as necessary. I funded multiple characters by doing that non-stop the first week or two of a new ladder."
pathofexile,3dz9ar,regular_gonzalez,9,Tue Jul 21 01:09:27 2015 UTC,It's more like buying for rates better than you sell for.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,Awkamess,5,Tue Jul 21 02:34:21 2015 UTC,Currency flipping is the equivalent of gold mining the trade chats. You're basically working for scraps until you find something lucky. A more profitable way to earn orbs is to flip items or play high level content.
pathofexile,3dz9ar,averagesmasher,6,Tue Jul 21 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"I thought 2.0 was fine until the past few days when I started hitting 75+ maps, and anything phys damage just destroys me. 4k life 2.5k ES with EB/MoM. Not only did they make phys damage higher, they made it so the only way to progress through maps is with hard mods."
pathofexile,3dz9ar,Shady_Love,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"I think the whole push to Hybrid is what's screwing people over. The playstyle you need as Hybrid is the polar opposite of what most people are looking for (enter map, run through very quickly killing enemies, not even paying attention to magic/rare enemy mods).   The thing is, if you take a ton of damage and you're not ready for it, you can't just flask up to almost full in a few seconds. It takes a while.   Hybrid casters may be able to get the largest effective HP pools, but too often I see people take a huge hit - all ES gone - and then they take 1-2 medium hits on their life and die to a ""one-shot"".   Maybe super late game, when you can have like 5k of each, but before late game I feel like it gets more people killed than it saves."

pathofexile,3dz9ar,NeedsMoreShawarma,0,Tue Jul 21 17:37:55 2015 UTC,Hybrid is really strong if you play a spec like a summoner. If you lose your es you just pop your increased duration vaal discipline and retreat. It's essentially like having a 6th pot.

pathofexile,3dz9ar,Hegemonica,8,Mon Jul 20 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it entirely depends on what kind of caster you're talking about. You can build just about any fire caster using the templar and marauder portion of the tree, get a ton of incidental armor from the life nodes you pick up, get plenty of damage nodes, etc. Also, you get to pick up 2 endurance charges (with a 3rd from bandits) which is insane physical mitigation and are woefully underrated.  Really, any build can run 3 endurance charges and arctic armour. That is the bare minimum of what you should be doing for physical mitigation if you don't have any armor or high block/dodge/evasion.   Of course, I also believe that more builds should be using armor than are currently, including casters. Obviously it won't be feasible for every caster, but I bet if you skilled a bit less damage, you could fit in some armor nodes, and you really don't need many to make a large difference.   The armor nodes nowadays are really quite insane compared to how they used to be, you can get plenty of armor without investing in a single node that only gives armor. Generally, you're getting life, life-regen, block chance, or damage along with it.   Can someone explain why so many people believe that it's unreasonable to get armor if you're a caster? Is there some golden rule of building casters that says you can't put any points into the left side of the tree? You can actually get plenty of damage nodes without touching the witch area in most cases, by the way, especially now that jewels exist. Or if you insist on getting witch stuff, you could potentially get some armor through jewels in the witch/shadow areas, which can roll at least 18%).   Now, I will grant that if you're going heavy crit it makes it difficult. Even then, though, jewels open up a lot of new options people didn't have before for getting crit in different parts of the tree, so it's conceivable you could make it work. It's also very possible to get crit in ranger and shadow, then travel to the duelist for life and armor nodes. I just don't get the whole ""armor isn't reasonable to get as a caster thing."" Can someone explain exactly what makes it so difficult?"

It's pathetic to me to do something as trivial as playing a video game, yet make fun of other people for playing a different video game. Yet it's incredibly prevalent across gaming.

pathofexile,3e13t7,spros,13,Tue Jul 21 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a mixed bag, I'm having more fun overall, but there are some changes that I'm not a huge fan of. Mostly map drops. Although, I tend to make a new character character by the time I get to mid-high level maps anyway. I just don't like how rare it is for a boss to even drop a map, let alone a +2."
pathofexile,3e13t7,GoodIdea321,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:15 2015 UTC,This. Mid tier maps drops are way too low. It's not fun running 72 73 maps on your 85+ character all day.
pathofexile,3e13t7,JConaSpree,10,Tue Jul 21 14:52:36 2015 UTC,Path of Exile is way better now. Still can't believe this game is free.  The game is going in the right direction.
pathofexile,3e13t7,StoneWall99,2,Tue Jul 21 11:39:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Theres been a few changes I disliked (AA, map drops, shift towards tactical movement over strategy for tough bosses), but on the whole, it feels like a brand new game.  Div cards are a big part of that. Playing self-found/solo, having something I can specifically grind for has been wonderful. Now we just need about 200 more cards for unqiues, and I'll be happy.  Also - desync. My god, the game is absolutely amazing with lockstop and more server locations.  Also - loot filter. Tweaking NeverSink's filter to fit my needs has made stacking IIQ/IIR a lot more fun and practical.  Also - exp per hour. Wow. I never looked at EXP values before this change... And now I can get a good gauge on how quickly I'm leveling up in various zones/mlvls.  Also - no more ""reduced mana"" gem for auras. The flexibility this offers in not having to link auras is just... wow. I'm using more skills now, and the game has become far more interactive than spamming one skill and having some trigger gems.   Example - I'm running Whispering Ice Dual Totems, along with linked golems and zombies, fire dash, 3 reserved buff/auras, and 2 linked curses.   Curse on hit is much easier with the hearlds, and now I can stuff auras in a single socket, ie 5L1S configurations."
pathofexile,3e13t7,lakattack0221,10,Tue Jul 21 15:16:13 2015 UTC,Way more fun. Good riddance desync and screens full of junk loot.
pathofexile,3e13t7,tackle70,6,Tue Jul 21 12:16:38 2015 UTC,These two things alone really changed the game.

pathofexile,3e13t7,puriburY,5,Tue Jul 21 12:45:24 2015 UTC,"I get that sometimes. For me though POE is a game I can either get really into and play every day for weeks, but then dial it back and just play a few hours a week just to unwind.   IMO, even jumping into the new leagues and only being able to play here and there is fun and worth it."
pathofexile,3e13t7,NeedsMoreShawarma,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps
pathofexile,3e13t7,serleth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there may be a bit of a dichotomy here.  I haven't really played since early beta.  The Awakening hype drew me back and I have been having a lot of fun with the changes so far.  I think players that have played all along (a lot fewer) may be the ones who aren't having as much fun."
pathofexile,3e13t7,Miker_Z,4,Tue Jul 21 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"You can dislike things in 2.0 while still enjoying the game, you know."
pathofexile,3e13t7,TheVaguePrague,4,Tue Jul 21 19:34:30 2015 UTC,I never said otherwise. I was just pointing out that the strawpoll lends itself to the deduction.
pathofexile,3e13t7,serleth,3,Tue Jul 21 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind maps being rarer. That's how they were in open beta and that was a lot of fun. More fun than running palace/courtyard 24/7. I've only done a handful of maps in standard but if you kill the bosses and roll the maps well it's not so bad. I got up to a 81 map in the short time I spent mapping. Maybe I'm just lucky and I'd be saying something different if I wasn't able to sustain 75s.  Gem vendors are cool but it would be nice if they were somehow made more visible. I get noobs asking me for gems because they don't realize the vendors have a page 2 because the first one isn't full. Having leveled gems is also a huge plus. Say you're a new player who leveled freeze pulse or fireball to 10 and realized you don't like the spell. Without the gem vendors, any new spell you pick up is gonna be worse than what you had, forcing you to keep using the original skills. Now you can experiment a lot more... if you notice the second page.  GGG added a bunch of low level uniques to make the leveling experience more pleasant. The weapons are all pretty vanilla with good damage and some half-interesting mod. For a new player they're great but they don't drop often enough. I got 4 uniques leveling to 60 and none were helpful. Would it hurt the economy to have some of these as quest rewards or something? Or just make it so you get a guaranteed drop around levels 10-30-50. None of them are overpowered in the grand scheme of things.  Act 4 is relatively too hard. You struggle to get through it and then enter the next difficulty and everything is a piece of cake until you get to act 4 again. Act 4 is overtuned but I also think the other 3 acts could be made harder.  Divination cards are cool just for the fact that they encourage you to do content you wouldn't do otherwise. Doing some lower maps just for fun or just farming a random area.  The game is still a lot of fun. More than 1.3? I'd say yes right now because of the novelty of everything. Ask again in a month."
pathofexile,3e13t7,LurkerPoE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:20 2015 UTC,High tier map drops being rare is fine.  But struggling to get 74-76 maps is ridiculous.
pathofexile,3e13t7,JConaSpree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"For me - less. It's not a complain, I'm just probably a bit tired of game. There were a lot of changes in mechanics but I don't see a lot of new end-game-viable-and-effective builds - mostly there are the same ones. And some old builds even became ineffective."
pathofexile,3e13t7,Immundissime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:16 2015 UTC,Eh it killed off a bunch of CI builds but I guess melee works now and no more desynchs. Economy feels fresh with the changes to rarity and eternal gone
pathofexile,3e13t7,JohnBrookz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing people say it killed CI builds, can you specify? I know it kind of sucks with the new blood rage since you won't regen your ES, but it also made some new CI builds possible that don't rely on leech so much(because of the recharge delay). I'm pretty sure if I remade my CI arcer in a 1.3 way it would suck, but if I remade it with 2.0 in mind, get some recharge rate, get some jewels it would be even better than it was before."
pathofexile,3e13t7,xaitv,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:25 2015 UTC,CI builds rely on leech like crazy because monsters hit very hard and CI has NO damage mitigation. The buffs to monster doesn't help either. I've seen people with 8K-10K ES get one shotted by whites. This along with the fact that CI is vulnerable to stuns doesnt help since the new map modifier gives MORE monsters.
pathofexile,3e13t7,JohnBrookz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"Just curious as I see a lot of complaints about mechanics changes, overtuned bosses, dead builds... but are people having fun? Is it a better game experience than it was before? I think it is, and have faith that GGG will continue to tinker to get the balance right."
pathofexile,3e13t7,Patchumz,4,Tue Jul 21 04:34:45 2015 UTC,Vocal minority making a big deal out of the few downsides to 2.0. Many many improvements that easy make it more fun in a general sense to the average player. Fairly obvious conclusion to me :P.
pathofexile,3e13t7,lostkavi,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:52 2015 UTC,"Vocal Majority makes a big deal out of downsides, but we're still having fun.

Less waiting for people to get done with maps to buy gems from them. This makes the process of leveling and character building much more enjoyable. Jewels. Great addition. Act IV is a good act, overall. I especially like dried lake. The art direction is really on point there.   Bad   Even though acts were made shorter, Cruel difficulty is more of a drag than ever now. Not helping with that is how trivial acts 1 and 2 feel after Normal/Cruel Act 4. I don't necessarily think Act IV needs to be nerfed much, but there's too much of a disparity. The old Arctic Armor was a more interesting skill than the new one. Enlighten now feels overly critical for a lot of builds.   Overall, more fun. I've always had trouble with mapping so that isn't a new issue for me."
pathofexile,3e13t7,Lame4Fame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:49:15 2015 UTC,"Enlighten now feels overly critical for a lot of builds.   Does it? I thought it is pretty useless now, unless for very niche cases where you get to squeeze in an extra aura because of it. Reduced mana before went as low as a 0.71 multiplier (iirc) at lvl 20, enlighten at lvl 3! is only 0.92. The only way to bring it down further afaik is to have +lvl to gems and/or +lvl to support gems on your gear and even then it's not that much. I thought the investment (rarity of the gem, leveling it and the gem slot) is way too high for the little benefit it provides. Can you explain to me why I'm wrong?  Edit: And while I agree that the old AA was more interesting in the sense that it was a mechanic you had to build around to make effective and not everyone could use it, and it was also distinct from most other sources of mitigation, with the change to EB (which was warranted imo), it needed to change as it wasn't really feasible to get as much mana regen as would be needed for it to be effective. And they probably wanted some sort of defensive mechanism for casters."

What is end game viable that can do anything and is efficient ? OP, boring, cookie cutter builds.  I really dont like the fact that cookie cutting got pushed even more, fun builds got made less viable.  The most fun ive had lately is playing crit frost blades and crit wild strike, neither viable or efficient until you get T1 gear pretty much, otherwise youre doing less DPS and have less survivability than the average cookie cutter build (Incinerate, Totems, Summoner, Reave, etc).  Theres no good inbetween fun and good/efficient right now for me.

pathofexile,3dxzpn,Jahkral,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:46 2015 UTC,It was fairly common to walk when defense was concerned. I believe that running lowered your armor and perhaps also increases your hit recovery time. A lot of people weren't aware of this though and just ran 100% of the time.

Since I also use multi strike with fb, that meant every time I did get hit, my guy would just randomly start running to whatever monster seemed to be currently targeted by fb's multi strike.

Plays a lot like a burning discharger without the clunkyness of maintaining the endurance charges. Burns really help with single target and the 55% chance to ignite from tree/doryani belt is enough to keep that consistant.

pathofexile,3dysc9,Chosenlama,2,Tue Jul 21 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is I believe this did not work before Awakening because I tried to test oro's damage to see if it was worth or not to do it on 2.0 and I remember it being the usual colour, might be wrong. Anyway, it's hella cool (I still prefer my seraph st tho)."
pathofexile,3dysc9,Bob9010,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"For spectral throw, not really. It just ends up being a variation of Mathil's elemental buzzsaw with roughly the same dps, just a slower attack speed. For OTHER skills it has become somewhat viable since GGG changed most attacks skills to scale from ""physical damage"" to ""Base damage"", so all that fire damage gets scaled by the attack gem leveling up."

But I'll just slap the tooltip numbers here with 5 frenzy charges : 4.5k on ST 6.3k on Viper strike (yes, viper strike works with ele builds! I'm really excited about this) I still have to get berserking and the elemental triangle from templar, that should boost my damage a little. Also, wed on rings."
pathofexile,3dysc9,9gxa05s8fa8sh,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:57 2015 UTC,I also use oros with flicker strike and currently have roughyly 100k+ dps with 7k life. It is totally viable. Cheaper versions of the build should reach 60k with about 5k hp.
pathofexile,3dysc9,crabsnz,0,Mon Jul 20 18:34:31 2015 UTC,whatever you are doing is abnormal. oro's is just not very good. excelling with it means you have GODLY god gear
pathofexile,3dysc9,9gxa05s8fa8sh,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:45 2015 UTC,Not at all. Cheap version is about 1-3 ex. You can make it godly with a bit more spent but no more than 10 ex. My version however is much more because why not max an uncommon build.
pathofexile,3dysc9,crabsnz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:13 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think your understanding of the gear cost (or how crappy that gear is) is wrong. but the only way to be sure is for someone to spend 3ex from scratch to see how absolutely terrible that oro's build will be.
pathofexile,3dysc9,9gxa05s8fa8sh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:25 2015 UTC,So much hate for oro. Have you ever tried it?
pathofexile,3dysc9,Sebasthion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:58 2015 UTC,not hate. I play oro flicker. I'm saying a 3ex oro flicker will be bad.   though of course this depends on what level character and map we're talking about. I expect a 3ex oro build cannot beat merciless alone...
pathofexile,3dysc9,flyYyify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:59 2015 UTC,I made an oro's cycloner for my first character in 2.0. I was farming both atziri and doing 80 maps during the first week. It might not be optimal but it's VERY strong on a low budget.  Pretty much self found except the fireborn jewel which I bought for 18 chaos.  Cyclone dps with frenzy charges is around 25k with Cyclone-WED-LGOH-Fire Pen-Conc  EDIT: I run blood magic passive and reserve arctic armor which results in about 5.5k hp unreserved.

pathofexile,3dysc9,projectwar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:26 2015 UTC,"Basically any budget-but-viable versions were nerfed quite hard. After Ambush ele-ST was nerfed. Elemental aura gems were nerfed. Crit and crit multi nodes were nerfed. In Rampage you could still make dagger-crit-ST work decently with an Abyssus, which was nerfed afterwards. Now with Awakening the aura reservation changes are another big nerf vs. elemental ST which come along with an attack speed nerf for Ambusher daggers. It looks like ST just ell too much behind Split Arrow/Tornado Shot to justify playing it.   But I don't wanna discourage you trying a ST build. In fact there were also changes in favor of ST. Heralds had been added to the game, which is a plus for ele ST. The droprate for crit gear like Maligaros Virtousity or Rats Nest were nerfed and cost like 3-5 ex in the beginning of the leagues, while Alphas Howl seems to be around an ex, so non-crit becomes more attractive. Also there are some new items that might perform really well with ST, for example the Mana on Hit Maraketh Claw, or the possibilites of stacking dodge or block in 2.0. Ichimonji could also be used for really low budget builds (its like 3c atm). For real optimisation you'd need a levelled Enlighten Gem now tho."
pathofexile,3dysc9,B_lintu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking 2H phys crit with katana, so none of the aura nerfs would really effect me, andsince hatred and ash are the only worth auras to use for any phys build I could go Mana based. Will probably have lower crit/damage then a dagger but I think it would still be powerful. With all the crazy damage monsters do now I wanna be a littttle bit farther away from a mob, as opposed to right now being in the face using cyclone. I don't enjoy bows that much."

pathofexile,3dzw2k,grufftech,5,Tue Jul 21 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"I used to have similar problems. My current build is made to have insanely tanky zombies who can facetank for me so I can do map bosses safely. I got zombies linked with fortify - minion resist - minion life and I am using a Mon'tregrul's. They have around 19k HP, max resist and fortify at gem lvl 19. Revenants do enough damage to compensate the lack of offense on zombies. Those zombies facetank Graveyard and Necropolis Merveil (both phases) or Temple Piety without losing notable amounts of health. Dual cursing with enfeeble and temp chains and curse effectiveness nodes helps a ton of course. Some clever use of convocation helps to keep spectres alive but Revenants tend to stay back anyways.   So far I am very happy with classic summoner in higher maps. Safe boss kills in most maps allow for better map pool sustain and clear speed is good as always."

pathofexile,3dzw2k,Frasballatsche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:20 2015 UTC,"Do you have Enfeeble and/or Temp chains? With some curse effectiveness this makes bosses do way less damage. My zombies  survive for long enough without curses to get the bosses cursed safely.  The minion resist gem gives a lot more resists than purity of elements does. Keep in mind auras also have a set range, during sketchy boss fights you might sometimes have to run away from your minions. My minions easily have capped resists. I don't know what your minions are at resist wise. Keep in mind 50% resists versus 75% resists means you take double damage.  Mon'tregrul's adds a ton of HP that then gets scaled by increased minion life (and also increases resists again).  Also 10k HP is half of what I got. HP regen scales of % max life so it makes a bigger difference than one might think."
pathofexile,3dzw2k,abcnever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:58:47 2015 UTC,try enfeeble + temp chain with curse effectiveness nodes. currently my summoner can do 73 temple piety without my zombies / spectres dipping even below 70 %  just cuz of the curses.

Setting up the horde again was painful too, takes like 3min work to go back to act 4 cruel to revive revenant to use for 3sec. Took me near 1h of what could be a 20s fight to finally ""portal in and out"" and grind her remaining 10% hp down.   That stuff was  pissing me the hell off."

Also, one thing to consider is that a lot of these complaint posts come from a point of passion for the game and while some people take it too far e.g. to the point of personally attacking developers, I believe the majority of these people just want what is best for their path of exile expierience and/or the game itself."

There's a decent amount of positive feedback in this thread, but obviously for a HC league, the pressure is extremely high to make sure that unfair deaths don't happen.  That's usually the bulk of the feedback early in a league, and it's gotten steadily better since Invasion."

pathofexile,3dzmui,ReddBro,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"Im enjoying tempest but not because of the actual league mechanics. If GGG would let us choose between a vanilla hardcore 4 month league and Tempest 4 month, I don't think many people would opt for the Tempest League (this says enough about the league). I might be wrong but I think most of the community and the hardcore players agree that tempest is more of a nuisance than an actual fun mechanic.   Also, some tempests simply prevent players from doing content and can even prevent players from doing their maps (which they can only know after using it).  You might enjoy the league and hey, my hats off to you. But the bottomline is that Tempest league (the only one i played) needs tweeking."
pathofexile,3dzmui,Ahelrues,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:51 2015 UTC,Is tempest the one where when you die once you're done for?  This is my first season/char in poe so I just did warbands.  Why do more people play Tempest league?
pathofexile,3dzmui,Ahelrues,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tempest like Hardcore has permanent death.   We play it for various reasons. Some like the challenge, some like the rush you get when you almost die and I play it because it keeps the league fresh for a longer time. Items are removed as people die and it creates a demand for all kinds of gear as people die and restart.  I also like the problem solving that has to be done when you are creating a hardcore build. 135% life and then going for as much damage as possible is something that works on standard leagues but would never fly in HC.  I really like standard leagues too and HC just offers things standard doesn't. Mainly freshness and requiring a different approach if you want to do well."
pathofexile,3dzmui,Nzash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:54 2015 UTC,Most players play standard leagues and I think it's still the same.  Warbands should have more players than Tempest.
pathofexile,3dzmui,Sheapy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:22 2015 UTC,I agree. Tempest being HC and new is pretty much the reason I (and buddies) play it.   The tempest mechanic itself needs a lot of work if it can be salvaged into something fun at all.

People saying that tempests ruin their efficiency I feel are 100% missing the point. If you want efficiency, go to standard and stop worrying about it. GGG isn't going to build a league that's ""if you kill your efficiency, you'll be rewarded with uniques!"". It just doesn't work like that.  The other side are the ones who want the leagues to be challenging and interesting. I somewhat agree with this, but at the same time, I would challenge those same folks to come up with unique and interesting league mechanics month after month, while releasing an expansion, all for free."

I understand if every build is able to face tank most of the content, then there is a problem, but if a couple +200 ex builds(low life or es) can't even tank ~76 map bosses, i think it's wrong... I know there are bosses like vaal/uber (where you had to pass the skill check), whom i could never face tank or some very high phys damage mobs with crazy mods...

Tempest needs certain tuning on some, and Warband's could use HP nerf/AI change(some of the casters will only run and never cast which is very annoying for melee/traps/totems).  Honestly the only leagues that weren't really 'fun' league wise outside of balancing would be onslaught/bit of bloodlines (mainly due to balance/certain mods were so anti-fun). Invasion was fine are fixes, beyond was reallly fun after changes. Nemesis was okay. Anarchy was okayish, Rampage was a kill everything fast, get faster league which was enjoyable learning to rush and keep up buff. Ambush was lots of loot, and big surprises if you didn't ID boxes. Torment had potential, but even when trying to get the ghosts to run properly they would stay in corners if AI was better I would of enjoyed it more.  Every league they put in does need adjustments, but overall the leagues are fine besides balancing needing. It would be hard to add things that wouldn't just break the playstyle/feel of the game."

pathofexile,3dxafb,HowIsThingDoBe,110,Mon Jul 20 08:21:59 2015 UTC,"Fun fact... there are only 3328 possible better rolls than this out of 40.5 Billion possibilities. The odds of getting a roll better than this are roughly 0.0000082%  0.026%  In other words, it is conceivable that this will be the best rolled Ventor's Gamble ever.  edit Fun fact #2: To expect (i.e. have >50% probability) to achieve a roll better than this, you would need to dump between 8 and 9 million divines on a Ventor's Gamble. And that's just for a just-better-than-50% chance of achieving it.    This is a mind blowingly lucky roll and you could likely sell it in standard for multiple mirrors to the right buyer.  edit #3 See below - my math is actually too simplistic and assumes equal or better rolls on each mod. Actual probabilities of getting a better ring are going to be much higher, but I'm too lazy to figure out the math needed to calculate how much higher. Don't think the ~10.91% number below is correct (it's too high because it assumes equal probability of each final attribute sum when in fact it's a bell curve where the extremes (-125 or 260) have a 1/40.5B probability). You'd have to figure out how many total permutations out of 40.5 Billion can yield a total sum of all attributes of >218 (possible range is -125 to 260).  Edit #4 OK so I've been trying to figure out the correct math on this and I think it's a bit beyond my mathematical abilities, so unless someone with some mad math skillz wants to step in, I'm just going to say ""wow this is a really lucky roll and worth a lot of $$$""  Edit #5 See Tugate's post below with the math. Odds of getting something better are somewhere around 1/4000. So not nearly as lucky as I was thinking and unlikely to be the best one out there for very long, but still pretty incredible."
pathofexile,3dxafb,tackle70,22,Mon Jul 20 13:24:21 2015 UTC,That's 3328 ways to make a profit. B-)
pathofexile,3dxafb,tackle70,16,Mon Jul 20 14:00:02 2015 UTC,"This roll is so lucky that you literally could not expect to make a profit by attempting to craft a better one. Assuming 1 Mirror = 600 Divines (a generous ratio), the expected cost to craft something better would be over 1300 stacks of mirrors. Far more than even the wealthiest players have.    You literally hit the jackpot on this roll!"
pathofexile,3dxafb,tugate,10,Mon Jul 20 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"Quick python script..  def roll_at_least(value, dice): if len(dice) == 1:     d = dice[0]     if value > d:         return 0.0     return (d - value + 1.0) / d  s1 = dice[0] s2 = dice[1:]  max2 = sum(s2)  P = 0  for x in range(1, s1 + 1):     if x >= value:         P += 1.0 / s1     elif x + max2 >= value:         y = value - x         P += roll_at_least(y, s2) / s1 return P   >> roll_at_least(35 + 21 + 77 + 72 + 76 + 68, [61, 81, 76, 76, 76, 21]) >> 0.00026291708112868454  That means one in about 4000 rolls will be at least as good as this one (assuming equal value for all stats and uniform distribution on each individual roll).    Edit: Important to note that since IIQ is most valuable stat and OP rolled perfect there that increases the value.  I'll try to give a quick and easy to understand explanation of how the code works.    The basic premise is that we have some number of dice (they may be different number of sides) and a total value.  We want to know the probability of rolling at least that total value.  What this algorithm does is take one die out of the equation and say ""let's assume this one rolled X"".  Now assuming that, what is the probability of the remaining die to roll enough to make the overall total be >= our value goal?  Probably you realize this question is still a question of exactly the same type we're trying to answer in the first place!  The difference is that we have 1 fewer die to worry about.  Repeatedly we do this until there is only 1 die, and then we can easily say ""oh this has a 60% chance of rolling 5 or higher"".  Eventually we get back the probability on the condition that the first die rolled X, now we just have to also consider each other possible thing that the first die could have rolled.  A human would probably be crunching numbers for days, but a computer can do it in a couple seconds.  I think an example would be best here: Suppose we only have 3 dice: d2, d3, d4 (2, 3, and 4 sided dice).  We want to know probability of rolling at least a 7.  Let's go step by step through what this would look like:    Probability of rolling (7) with [d2, d3, d4]: P1 = 0     Assume d2 rolls 1:         Probability of rolling (6) with [d3, d4]: P2 = 0             Assume d3 rolls 1:                 Probability of rolling (5) with [d4]: 0                 P2 += 0 / 3 --- This means take the previous value and add to it.  P2 = 0 now.             Assume d3 rolls 2:                 Probability of rolling (4) with [d4]: 0.25                 P2 += 0.25 / 3 --- We divide by because d3 can roll 3 different things, so each assumption has 1/3 base chance.             Assume d3 rolls 3:                 Probability of rolling (3) with [d4]: 0.5 --- Note, this is rolling *at least* 3.                 P2 += 0.5 / 3         *Probability of rolling (6) with [d3, d4]*: P2 = (0 / 3 + 0.25 / 3 + 0.5 / 3) = 0.25         P1 += 0.25 / 2 --- The ""Probability of rolling (6) with [d3, d4]"" divided by chance of rolling 1 with d2.     Assume d2 rolls 2:         Probability of rolling (5) with [d3, d4]: P2 = 0 --- A new P2 (not continuing from old one!)             Assume d3 rolls 1:                 Probability of rolling (4) with [d4]: 0.25                 P2 += 0.25 / 3             Assume d3 rolls 2:                 Probability of rolling (3) with [d4]: 0.5                 P2 += 0.5 / 3             Assume d3 rolls 3:                 Probability of rolling (2) with [d4]: 0.75                 P2 += 0.75 / 3         *Probability of rolling (5) with [d3, d4]*: P2 = (0.25 / 3 + 0.5 / 3 + 0.75 / 3) = 0.5         P1 += 0.5 / 2 *Probability of rolling (7) with [d2, d3, d4]*: P1 = (0.25 / 2 + 0.5 / 2) = 0.375   This ended up being pretty long winded, but it just goes to show how much work a computer can do in very little time.  Hopefully this gives some idea of how the script works and how the probability behind it makes sense."

pathofexile,3dxafb,Yoshi-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"You calculations are somewhat flawed though, you are assuming that a ring is only considered better, when every roll is better. So the same ring, but with 40 rarity but only 49% cold resistance, would be a worse ring under your assumption.  I would say that we use another metric to check how good a ventor's gambler is(Under the assumption that one is indifferent about the distribution)  Basically, you do RollOfTheRing-LowestPossibleRoll for each roll and then add all of them together.  For a perfect rolled ring it would be:     60 - 0 = 60 10 - -10= 20 40 - - 40 = 80 50 - - 25= 75 50 - - 25 = 75 50 - - 25 = 75   Which is a total of 385.  And the same with the one of the OP:   34 = 34 10 - - 10= 20 36  - - 40= 76 46 - - 25= 71 50 - - 25= 75 42 - - 25 = 67   Which is a total of 343.  So now we can compare these two values to each other 343/385 = 0.8909090909  So now we can say that 10.91% of all possible Ventors Gamble rings are better, and 89,09% are worse  So we can say that this ring is at 89.0909% of the perfect roll"
pathofexile,3dxafb,AetherFlash,7,Mon Jul 20 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"... That isn't how statistics works.  First of all, you don't account for all the rings that are equivalent. Secondly, you don't account for the fact that there is only 1 combination to get 385, but tons of different ways to get 350.  Let's get an example up in here:  Rolling 2 dice and taking the sum. There are 11 outcomes. (2-12).  If I rolled a 10, according to your logic, That's better than 8/11 of rolls, ties 1/11, and worse than 2/11.  However, that isn't actually the case.  If you list out all the possibilities, you'll notice that it beats 30/36 rolls, ties 3/36, and loses to 3/36. beats 5/6, ties 1/12, loses to 1/12.  This is because there are 6 ways to roll a 7, 5 ways to roll an 8, etc, down to 1 way to roll a 12. You can't collapse all of the 6 possible ways to roll a 7 into 1 instance, and say that has the same chance to roll a 12."

Here is why:  As you calculated right, there are 3238 Rings that are better in every roll, but on the other hand, there are only 1.8438132*1010 Rings that are worse in every Roll(34*20*76*71*75*67). So in your calculation you are ignoring around 22 Billions possible rings. That are more than 50% of all rings, you are basically saying that 50% are neither better nor worse than this Ring. And if your Goal is to judge whether a Ring is better or worse than any other Ring, ignoring more than half of all ring, is simply not good."

pathofexile,3dxafb,Jihok,4,Mon Jul 20 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Another mitigating factor is for some, the resists are not really a draw to the item: they're interested in the life, IIR, and quantity. I know I'd much rather have those rolls maxed out with low resist rolls than very high resists and a somewhat lower life roll.   It's still an insane roll and very valuable, but I don't think it will be the ""best"" ventor's gamble for everyone for too much longer. Definitely of interest to collectors, but I daresay more practical-minded players would prefer one with 50 life, 15 quantity, 40 rarity, and ~20 all-res, for example in most situations.  While that's hard to roll too, if you're willing to forgive low rolls on the resist, it's substantially more likely."

pathofexile,3dxafb,TomTuff,-12,Mon Jul 20 17:51:46 2015 UTC,I don't think it's hundreds. It's maybe 50-70ex tops. It's a lucky roll for sure but you'd have trouble finding more than that I'd imagine.
pathofexile,3dxafb,ryvenn,0,Mon Jul 20 13:56:36 2015 UTC,"But you don't sell it, you charge mirror fees. That's like you can sell it for 50ex as many times as you can find people who want to mirror it. Since it's very unlikely that there will ever be a better Ventor's Gamble, the longer they hold on to it the more currency they can make.  Edit: I'm an idiot, of course you can't mirror uniques."

pathofexile,3dxafb,tackle70,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:22 2015 UTC,Oh god I'm an idiot. Of course you're right.  So it's basically too valuable to sell.
pathofexile,3dxafb,nikkynak,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"Have to agree it I wouldn't pay more than the price you mentioned. Even at 50-70ex it's a little steep and I would rather try to balance my stats/mf using other jewelry and gear slots.  If I was rolling in cash though, yes around 40-60ex I would buy it. I'm sure someone could do the math on the probability of that roll. It's pretty GG."

I'm not sure about the prices but I'd say a couple of exalts. Just compare on poe.trade.  You got a bit shafted on the mods (lowest tier WED% and mid tier res) but it's still damn good."

pathofexile,3dy1ys,tastychicken,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"No worries!  I might not be that good on what items are worth what, but anything with high values of every resistance is usually worth something because that's one of the most important defensive stats of PoE.  And raw HP is usually also worth something for life based builds.  The WED% is more specific to some builds (mostly ele-based builds I presume, since pure phys builds don't care)."

pathofexile,3dy1ys,Richybabes,19,Mon Jul 20 14:42:59 2015 UTC,a few ex ( 2-5)  nobody who wants life will be happy about that low of a life roll. especially with how much resist you can get from jewels now.  the armour roll is the most valuable roll of them all because this isn't as easily replacable.
pathofexile,3dy1ys,goetzjam,4,Mon Jul 20 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"If you are using jewels for resistances instead of damage, I think you are doing it wrong.  Depending on build you can get like +30% damage and life %.  Why on earth would you sacrifice that much damage to get resistances?"
pathofexile,3dy1ys,Richybabes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"I can see it possibly being useful if you need to get some resists in order to swap out a rare for a unique that lacks resists. I can forsee myself having this problem on my t-shot ranger when I want to swap my boots for Atziri's Step, my gloves for Maligaros, my quiver for a drillneck, and my helmet for a rat's nest (need a lot more currency for these things in WBs of course lol)."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,goetzjam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"That build sounds scary, no life on helm or gloves :O  I'm not saying there is ever a circumstance where you shouldn't get resistances on jewels, just ideally you'd want damage and life instead.  Granted if you make up for the damage and life elsewhere by having resistances on your jewels then I think that makes up for it."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,Richybabes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'm also currently using an Infractem, which means I'm forced to use a thief's torment. I'll probably switch to a decent Harbinger at a later date and steer clear of the drillneck altogether."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,luvs_T0_spooge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"I mean drill neck at least has some life on it, abit med-low compared to what you could get on a rare.  Drillneck more then likely will be expensive again this league, not only is it used in a popular build (posion arrow) its just overall a highly desired unqiue for niche builds like ice shot.  In terms of bow builds are you doing split arrow, LA, TS or some other bow skill?"
pathofexile,3dy1ys,ashcroftt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"TS, though I can sub in SA/LA/IS if I want to later. The build doesn't really commit to any one bow skill, so long as it's a projectile and can crit. I'd like to try out all of them, and possibly have levelled gems to use in different scenarios (ice shot on a particularly scary map, for example, or lightning arrow in groups for the shock)."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,Richybabes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:16 2015 UTC,what's the point of infractem if you are using TS?
pathofexile,3dy1ys,kengro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"it is a good and cheap bow that can take TS to low-mid maps, and the 100% pierce chance goes well with Drillneck. It is the cheapest decent crit bow that you can use to farm up currency for a Harbinger."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,goetzjam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm still levelling, so the DPS is amazing even without the pierce chance.  Secondly, while the initial arrows always pierce, the ones that come out at the explosion do not by default.  Thirdly, I found one with near perfect rolls, aside from the implicit which I plan to reroll with blessed orbs."

pathofexile,3dy1ys,lurkerlevel-expert,0,Mon Jul 20 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"TS is gmp, so you only need 20k on your tooltip to be doing 100k. Still takes effort to get to 20k though."

To have 20k tooltip without charges and flasks and 4.8k life you need a six link and a 15 Ex bow minimum as you have a LOT of passives invested in survivability. I'd really like to see that 'budget' gear, maybe I'm doing something wrong. Can you link the char+tree?"
pathofexile,3dy1ys,lurkerlevel-expert,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:30:21 2015 UTC,"Ok everyone has different definitions of budget. Sure if you just started playing the game, your idea of budget is 10c items and a 5L. That isn't getting anyone to 20k ts. I assume that the average redditor here has a little bit of playing experience and didn't just pick the game up on 2.0 release.  My ranger is something that I played on and off for the past 4 months to lvl90~, and all of her items are self found/craft or bought with currency made during this period. I had no currency before anyway.   Maligaros - self found, rats nest - 5c, Atziri's Step - 5c, rare quiver - 8c, 5L queen of forest - 1ex, rare belt - self found. I did just buy a new 3ex amulet, and 2ex for my rings. My bow was a white base that I used 200~ alts to get t2 ipd, then regaled crit multi, then spent 2ex for multi craft. I did 6L it in a few hundred tries and was lucky.  Any regular player should be able to farm a few ex and enough fuses to try for a 6L during a couple months. No flipping or shavs/mjolner rng drop needed, pretty budget imo."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,JustPointingOutThe,0,Tue Jul 21 07:23:05 2015 UTC,"You were pretty lucky then.   My crit tornado ranger has a lot of self found gear, but still cost me a buttload of currency. I am at crit cap, 21k DPS unbuffed with a 6L, but I use rarity as a link. I ended up buying a 9.15% crit 300 DPS bow for ~4 Ex, a 6L chest for 8 Ex and a few gems for ~6 Ex, was lucky to alch 2 GG crit rings myself. I now have the deeps, but am still sitting at 3.8k HP at lvl88, and don't see many ways to get HP without getting way below 20k.  I dumped more than 2000 alts and 150+Regals into crafting a 5L hb I found, but got nothing. :S Also wasted upwards of 1000 fuses trying to link a chest and just ended up buying a 6L after I gave up.  Budget to me doesn't mean I got extremely lucky. I don't think you can make a decent (~deathless Atziri) char without 15 Ex minimum. You could do that in 4 months, yes, but it is still very expensive compared to eg. Explosive Arrow or even SRS. Both of those can do better damage while having a lot more hp for ~ 3Ex total."
pathofexile,3dy1ys,packimop,-4,Tue Jul 21 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"Just lucky on the 6L, everything else was cheap stuff that anyone can spend time on poe.trade to look for. A t2 (now t3) ipd bow with no flat dmg/phy accuracy is not expensive. I mean I geared up a ranger, a marauder, a templar, and a scion all during this time period. All I ever sold were 1c-1ex gems and items constantly. There are people that find 1 unique or GG rare and make more in 1 sale then I did in months of peddling garbage. Tbh I 6l'd 3 times and also failed after 1300~ tries on my 4th item. If I can do all this in 4 months, getting a single ts build is peanuts."

pathofexile,3e2flw,projectwar,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:58 2015 UTC,"If you want both armour and crit, then you may be better off starting scion. The two stats are on opposite sides of the tree, so the pathing as a witch may be less than ideal. If you use a projectile spell, then you may be able to pick up some projectile damage from the shadow/ranger area too.   If you're not dead set on going crit, then starting marauder/templar may be better if you have a lower budget, since you don't have to go to opposite sides of the tree.  To help deal with reflect, you may want to run purities in the types of damage that you deal. If you're going into shadow for crit, then vaal pact is an option that's open to you.  Shield vs dual wield is up to you really. If you want to do hella damage, then dual wield is obviously the way to go. If you find yourself dying too much, then perhaps a shield is necessary. If you're dying to phys, then an armour based shield is nice (also helps with life/res). If reflect/ele damage is your issue, then you could consider a saffel's. With a saffel's + triple purities, ele damage to you will be cut by around 1/3rd, and resists will be easy to cap (meaning you can get more life, more armour, and more damage on gear). You can cut the reflect damage further if you use a fire spell with arctic armour, dropping one or both of the other purities.   As far as leech goes, I'm not certain about this, but I have heard that the leech mod for wands has been made local, meaning it only works with attacks, and not spells. You could use a doryani's catalyst, though if that isn't an option then life leech may be necessary.  Mana sustain may be a problem. Not because of the 75% reservation, but rather because you want so much from the tree (armour, life, spell damage, crit, mana). If you play incinerate, then you can't crit, but you can mitigate most of the mana cost through elreon jewelry. If you're dead set on playing crit, then a pledge of hands may be your only option. The 100% mana bonus it gives should really help you out.  It's going to be a bit of an awkward build to make, and it's probably going to be less than ideal, but I think that with decent gear and planning you should be able to make it work."

You can more or less ignore all non unique-mob phys damage in the game.  It's pretty hard to gauge what rating you need for it to be worthwhile. I'm saying 8k because it feels like I can stop caring about most things. Some people downplay the value of armour, or go overboard, but it wasn't pure phys damage that was hurting them. They seem to ignore added elemental damage that mobs have and just think armour sucks.  *EDIT: Sorry 8k+ is a useless figure, 45% reduction is good for whatever level you are at.

My advice to friends who have wrist problem is to change your keybind, so that you DONT use mouse buttons to walk or spam skills.  Here's what I use:   LMB - default attack, only left click when i pick up things, open chests, etc.  MMB - something you dont need to click very often, like blood rage.  RMB - bind to nothing, only need to use RMB when you use currencies.  The important part is: ~ or Space bar or any key of your choice - bind to walking, this replaces RMB on your skill bar. Hold down the walk key, hover over the spot you want to go with your mouse. This make takes some time to get used to, but it will be a huge relief to your wrist.   1-5 or QWERT - your skills. I use 1 for my main skill.  The downside of this keybind is you get 1 less skill on your bar, which is a much smaller problem in my opinion, I can still play summoner builds just fine.

These don't have dedicated number pads and are thus considerably less wide. This leaves your wrists more straight as the distance between them is reduced. I use a Quickfire TK. Use your chairs arms as elbow rests. Try to keep the top of the rests in line with your desk. This keeps your elbows at more or less 90-degree angles which is quite natural and keeps pressure off your wrists. Go even further than using a key on your keyboard as your primary skill: use the spacebar.

Also 6k is like way of what you usually encounter, i mean sure malachi or vaal slams or whatever, but more realistic hits from rare mobs in high lvl maps are like 3k in one hit, which would be reduced by 33% from having 15k armor (which is really doable with decent gear, some nodes and determination). And that a nice mix of multiple defensive mechanics like etups is the way to go is a well known fact :)"

pathofexile,3dzh9s,Reidanlol,4,Mon Jul 20 21:34:55 2015 UTC,Yay! By the way I respec'd out of my duration nodes temporarily and with absolutely no skill duration increases I have a 3.15 second icestorm at 745 int.   ...I might just skip the duration nodes entirely at this point.  edit: Yeah... just tested it. Took those 3 duration nodes and put it towards a jewel slot. Gained ~70 int via brute force solution jewel. Now it lasts 3.5 seconds at 817 int. So by taking points out of skill duration increase and putting them into more int I gained duration overall. Weird.
pathofexile,3dzh9s,Seerix,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"3.15 second icestorm at 745 int.    and   3.5 seconds at 817 int   Yeap that supports the 0.7+0.35per100Int.  Yeah, increased duration is a really poor way to scale Icestorm damage. In a way Icestorm has 50% increased duration per 100Intelligence.  Thanks for testing it. Looks like it was beneficial for you to spec out of the duration nodes anyway."

pathofexile,3dzh9s,WaffleT1,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, without intentionally taking long path to pick up Int, you can easily reach like +300Int from the tree. Add in another 30-50 Int from gloves, boots,chest, rings, and emulet. Plus the %Int boost from the The Whispering Ice it's easy to reach 600-700 Int. At which point, Icestorm is equivalent in DPS to a lvl20 Firestorm, where one can easily claim the Whispering Ice to be viable.  In fact, in this discussion, these players reach 1000+Int with clever use of the Str-to-Int or Dex-to-Int Jewels."
pathofexile,3dzh9s,kimera-houjuu,3,Tue Jul 21 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"There is no answer since it entirely depends on your intelligence+spell damage at a specific point in time. There will be times when 8% spell damage nodes become weaker, there will be times when even 10% spell damage nodes become weaker than a +10 int.  The only way I managed to deal with that properly is to spreadsheet everything and see what a change actually accomplishes.  It's a similar idea with all the conversion jewels mentioned around, most of these aren't worth losing a jewel slot besides cost-efficiency."

You pretty much need a 5 link to use CoMK, and a 6 Link is where it gets good. Aside from that Arc is pretty bad, you want something like Discharge, since it does huge damage. Also if you really want to use Arc then your going to want Hyaon's Fury or Doryani's Fist, Oro's is good but you want a fire spell to go with it or better yet Discharge with a pyre ring. This will allow you to grab fire damage nodes that will increase you melee skill damage and spell damage. Cyclone isn't a bad CoMK skill, if anything its the best, for unarmed at least, but you need a 6 link for it to work well (Cyclone, Conc, AoE, FA, CoMK, Discharge), for using a weapon Static Strike is great since the AoE sets off CoMK and its single target is good too, as for links (Static Strike, FA, Multi, WED, CoMK, Discharge) with FA being the one to drop if you do it in a 5 link. Romari's RT is how I sustain Discharge, but if you go Oro's all you need to do is use Frenzy and/or go crit. Just make sure you use a Pyre ring to convert cold to fire. Just remember this, the point of CoMK is to add AoE on something with little to no AoE, it works best with   high damaging spells since they clear packs instantly, the best being discharge, your links should be focused on giving you high single target damage, with discharge being there to clear nearby mobs."

Now there's one point you don't have to forget, armor becomes good if you invest a ton of points and gear into it. And while some builds are having good opportunities to do so, it's not so easy for a tornado shot ranger. Crawling through the red part of the tree or picking up armor based items will possibly turn your good evasion/life build into average life/evasion, resulting in more reflect deaths for example. Will turn your good killspeed into average killspeed giving more monsters a chance to come close to you and hit you. And in return you get enough armor to help you against death from average phys damage sources, still not the burst damage. Adding some suggestions to the list u/SerenAllNamesTaken started:   use your endurance charges try out enfeeble/temp chain curses pick up the herold of ice instead of fire/thunder   tl;dr: I'm not saying there's a way to become immortal as an evasion based char, I'm only pointing out you might ruin the fun parts about your build, trying to hybrid into armor without becoming immortal that way either."

pathofexile,3e21kn,Moasseman,0,Tue Jul 21 10:31:46 2015 UTC,"I use Flammability, no Fire Pen gem yet - haven't got the links. :<"
pathofexile,3e21kn,Moasseman,3,Tue Jul 21 10:34:28 2015 UTC,Fire pen should be the only support in a 2L situation. It's by far superior DPS wise to everything else on Flame totem
pathofexile,3e21kn,Moasseman,0,Tue Jul 21 10:52:15 2015 UTC,"I use a +2 Fire gems Wand, with Added Cold and Lightning. Haven't got the Gem (Fire Pen) itself yet, was too lazy to do the A Fixture of Fate quest. ^"
pathofexile,3e21kn,HeirkuWork,4,Tue Jul 21 10:57:53 2015 UTC,with Added Cold and Lightning.   See that's where the problem lies. Both are great for tooltip DPS but bad for actual DPS
pathofexile,3e21kn,serleth,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:07 2015 UTC,"As other post said, those are tooltip DPS links. Read up on some FT guides."
pathofexile,3e20f7,PMPG,2,Tue Jul 21 10:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. I really wanted to play Frenzy + Melee splash, but it's literally 20-30% of the clear speed of cyclone."
pathofexile,3e20f7,RG_PankO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:17:57 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to make a viper strike melee splash build the last couple of days but my clear speed is horrible. I could live with the clicking on monsters if only the AoE was better but alas I have to run between enemies to make sure I hit them all. I think the melee splash gem could definitely use a buff. Or perhaps it's viper strike that needs a buff. I love the idea of it, an assassin shadow that jumps in and poisons enemies and zooms away but if you only hit half a mob it doesn't really work. Ranged poison works much better and you don't have to face tank anyone either."
pathofexile,3e20f7,markgraydk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:28 2015 UTC,Would be nice if GGG makes melee splash a jewel instead of a skill gem
pathofexile,3e20f7,biotar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:00:44 2015 UTC,Works well for flicker strike. Also good on SRS but that's another story.

pathofexile,3e20f7,BravoScripTsundere,3,Tue Jul 21 10:20:59 2015 UTC,so you use cleave with melee splash? you just proved my point even more.

pathofexile,3e0e5r,jordan853,6,Tue Jul 21 09:40:56 2015 UTC,Charan's 3rd sword should have been released in 2.0.0 iirc.  Nobody knows the recipe for the Goddess Unbound yet though

pathofexile,3e0e5r,chuanhsing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:34 2015 UTC,It is. It's just not listed on the Path wiki's list of 119 new uniques.  Not sure what you're talking about with Ghostmarch.

pathofexile,3dycvc,popmycherryyosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Crit cycloner? man, that sounds fun :P how do you go about getting pcharges? and how many do you have in total?"
pathofexile,3dycvc,popmycherryyosh,3,Mon Jul 20 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"CWDT assassin's mark. And only 3, I decided I rather have more frenzy charges for guaranteed damage rather then 3% from a power charge on tree, but mostly because Pc was to far away on tree to be worth it.  Crit chance atm is 31% without diamond rings or maligaro's. 41% with all 3 charges. If I ever get an upgrade to this with 8.5% crit chance then I'm sure I can get 65+% crit chance. DPS without any charges up with the axe is 26k."
pathofexile,3dycvc,popmycherryyosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a lot of crit even with only 3 charges. Do you have a constant up time of the PowerCharges with Assassin's Mark on CWDT?  Have you gone out of your way to get crit chance nodes? Also, must be annoying having to get accuracy on gear aswell, or?"
pathofexile,3dycvc,superbeastdj,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"I made a build thread on poe site yesterday: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1336100  And yes you have to go all the way to shadow area to get the crit nodes. Leveled as RT until about 80 when I got a decent 400 pdps flesh ripper. My accuracy is 92% with ice golem at lv85, only accuracy is rings, ammy and gloves, not annoying at all, at least atm where I don't use any unique's so capping resist is easy and I can focus on damage mods or accuracy. Life at 5.2k."

pathofexile,3dycvc,v4sh123,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:09 2015 UTC,So saved. I've been wanting to try crit cyclone axe build since i heard about the new axe. Now if I can just find some time to play... >_< Only got a lvl 14 ranger so far.

pathofexile,3dycvc,arpc,4,Mon Jul 20 16:25:50 2015 UTC,It is to me lol I just pick up every flesh Ripper above ilvl73 I find then alch it if I have any. I have a 6 socket ilv77 blue that I use for alteration spamming to try to get that GG axe (currently need to regal) but throwing an alch here and there for other rippers didn't seem like a bad idea to me. And it payed off :) '  I mean what other stuff are you going to use alchs on?

pathofexile,3dycvc,v4sh123,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:46 2015 UTC,You need to alch maps below 74 to get maps 74+. No wonder people are having trouble with maps they don't even alch...
