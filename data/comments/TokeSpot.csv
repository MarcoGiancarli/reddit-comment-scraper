It's called Mariners falls, about 5 minutes from Apollo bay. During this time of year all the signs on the way there do say that it is closed due to storm damage and higher water (you need to cross the river it falls into about 4 times to get there) but if you don't mind getting your feet wet and climbing over a few fallen trees you'll be fine! The best part about it being closed is that not a single soul is to be seen, so you can toke up to your hearts content!  Just watch out for leeches! It's all worth it though!"

There was this one house in an otherwise normal neighborhood that was just covered in professional graffiti on the outside, with no noticeable tenants. I think it was close to the post office or hardware store, either way it's a pretty small town. If you have enough time to get high and casually wander or drive around Winslow, I think it'd make for an awesome smoke spot provided nobody bothers you. Meteor crater is on your way and would be pretty cool too I'd imagine."
