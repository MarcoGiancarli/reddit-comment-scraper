ecigclassifieds,3e4sz9,tsume24,2,Tue Jul 21 23:26:10 2015 UTC,"Decided to pull the individual posts in favor of combining the items for a package deal.   What I've got here is a stainless steel Delta II tank with a pink 50-watt iStick (that has an Awesom-O skin on it). There's nothing wrong with either item; in fact, this was my very first legit setup when I upgraded from a cheap pen-style device. They just don't get used anymore since I got a 100w Sigelei and got a black Delta II to match it. Here's some copypasta from the posts I pulled:  When people refer to the ""version 1"" and ""version 2"" of the iStick 50w, they're referring to the ones made before/during the bad batch that Eleaf produced around March of this year. This unit was purchased in April, and has never given me a single problem, so I guess it's a ""version 2.""  I'm literally only selling it because it doesn't get used anymore since I got a Sigelei. It's a great unit that's never let me down. What you see is what you get.  You will receive:  • the iStick itself • its original box/packaging • its original USB charger • the pre-installed Awesom-O skin (from Vaporskinz) • The Delta II • its original box/packaging • a like-new coil that was used for half a tank of Fuzzy Menthol by Eureka (menthol mango flavor); just re-prime it with whatever you want to vape and it's good to go • A surprise bottle of e-liquid   I realize I didn't do a perfect job putting the skin on, but when I started it on one side, it looked perfect! once it was wrapped around, it was too late to really reposition it. so it's a near-perfect placement. I really only got the skin to protect the device, anyway. it's in pristine condition underneath.  Oh, and underneath the skin, it's the ""red"" color (which is really fuchsia).  And, the bottle of e-liquid in the photo is NOT the one you will receive. That's a cheapo nasty cherry flavor I got from a DIY-er, and honestly, it sucks. So, when you buy, tell me what level of nic you prefer between 0, 3, and 6mg, and I'll give you something. I cannot promise that it will be a full bottle of juice, but it will definitely, at the very least, be enough to fill up the Delta once or twice.  $60 shipped for both items together. Individually, the iStick is $40 and the Delta is $25. If they get split up, ONLY THE PERSON WHO GETS THE DELTA WILL RECEIVE A BOTTLE OF E-LIQUID. And, I will only split them up if interest is expressed in both items individually.  PayPal only; G&S only. Cat not included.  Also, I ship internationally! No extra fee for shipping to Canada, but if you're somewhere else, send me a message and we'll figure out shipping."

All the gear comes with charging cables, and obviously performs very well (otherwise I would not be selling). I prefer to do an in person exchange within the GTA area. Also, I have a bunch of 6mg nic juices that I no longer use that I can throw in - all are good organic (whatever that means for ejuice) brands. I'm downgrading my nic level to 3-0 so I can't use them anymore."

Scammers will make an excuse like ""I had to wait 3 weeks for my money last time, so I want to do it GW"", or some other such nonsense. I've been sold damaged goods by folks here, so I learned the hard way. There's no deal that isn't worth doing PP G&S, and that's it."

I called PayPal and when they asked what I sold him, I was honest and said it was an electronic cigarette device (an arctic tank) but not a nicotine product (the juice I'd included as a freebie was 0mg). I still got my money back."

I wish you could ban IPs for stuff like this.   I wouldn't do any trades with anyone that doesn't have a lot of flair unless they will send first. I wouldn't purchase from anyone with out at least a few flair. Especially if they are a new account, inactive accout, low karma, etc. For new comers I would personally only be willing to sell to them and not buy or trade with them until they were established.   Never ever pay with friends and family and if someone insists then tell them you'll just pay the fee and send G&S. If they refuse then they are trying to scam you most likely and end the sale. The extra $1-2 is worth it for at least some piece of mind."

ecigclassifieds,3dwwm9,Swelton,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:53 2015 UTC,I'm so sad that he scammed people after I had such a nice experience buying a Sigelei off him. I hope you can get your money back. :(  I'm also surprised he asked you to send a gift payment. he hadn't asked me to do that.  just remember...a gift payment is exactly that: a gift to a potential scammer. :/
ecigclassifieds,3dwwm9,Mason_54,2,Mon Jul 20 08:39:11 2015 UTC,"I had a bad experience with him too. I'm sorry I didn't post about it sooner, but I have an open PayPal dispute and I wanted to wait until it was finished to post. But honestly, fuck it, people need to know.  I sent him $20 for a Doge V2 with original packaging and goodies bag, including SS screws & posts, as we explicitly discussed. It took him like 5 days to ship it, and another week for me to get it, and it was in a random box and didn't have any of the accessories, just a Doge V2 loaded with some sort of bad-smelling clear gunk (not juice). It might even be a clone, I have no idea if it is. I asked him to send the rest of the stuff, and he said he forgot and would send me the rest. I messaged him multiple times, via reddit, email, and PayPal, and he never responded again.  Luckily I paid Goods & Services, so I opened a dispute with PayPal. Apparently he responded today, but I don't get to see his response, so now I get to wait for PayPal to arbitrate. I just bought a brand new Doge V2 from my local shop instead.  Sorry that you lost that much money. IMO I'd rather offer to pay extra to use goods & services than use friends & family and have no recourse. From now on, I'm not going to use friends & family for anything but friends & family."

I'm not this scammer and that's the end of that. I mainly deal on the Canadian classified section because I don't want shit to get stuck at customs.  A lot of us Canadians use the same brands of juice because we choose canadian suppliers due to customs confiscating juice. Premiumlabs the maker of blind pig is a very popular one and they produce Blind Pig, Yogen Fog, Dr.Fog and Worlds Best Custards which are sold throughout Canada.  Accusations are dangerous."

ecigclassifieds,3dwwm9,twoshotracer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"yep. when someone sends you a money request via PayPal, or you choose the ""send money"" option, you have the choice to send the money to ""friends and family,"" which gifts them the money with no fee to them; or you can send the money for ""goods and services,"" which costs the seller a fee of 0.029% + $0.30. the former is essentially a gift payment that you cannot dispute or get back. the latter offers buyer protection and the option to dispute in the event that your seller is a scummy shitbag."

If you're skilled enough at wicking to get around that, it's worth the $15 I paid for it and probably will again.  This one I picked up as a product test and I'm in love with it for the price.  Plus, fuck eleaf/joyetech, right?"
ecigclassifieds,3dxlow,chakravanti93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"I should add that the LG's are new, less than a dozen cycles by a good margin.  The VTC5's are authentic.  I cleaned and rewrapped them myself because of tearing.  I figure including both sets should offset the age of the VTC5's.  The LG's are pretty much the same specs although I couldn't speak to the internal resistance, they are 3000mah, which is nice, especially on a parallel mech.  All of my batteries are always trickle charged (250ma/h) for longest life."
