A_irsoft,3e4mud,CobaltRose800,5,Tue Jul 21 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"theoretically, yes. You'd just need to figure out a way to not only regulate the massive amount of pressure in the tank but also make a fitting that will adapt to an HPA remote line.  Also: if you're gonna use an air compressor, do it fucking right and go industrial grade :P"

A_irsoft,3e4mud,OGPancakewasd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"In theory, it would actually be better to hook the compressor up to your HPA tank, then run it as high as it can go (obviously a regular shop compressor won't hit 3000, or get anywhere near it). You would probably get better flow and consistency."
A_irsoft,3e4mud,imarziali,2,Wed Jul 22 03:23:43 2015 UTC,Bitch that's the tubby custard machine
A_irsoft,3e4mud,ManWithDildoHands,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can power a Polarstar, or any other HPA system, with a compressor. There are a few ways of doing this. Both will require different fittings.  If you want to connect it straight to the gun, you will need a compressor able to regulate it's output PSI. You won't want it running past 120 PSI. You will need this and this. Screw them together, apply a bit of teflon paste or tape, the push it on your tube that runs out the FE.  Alternatively, if your compressor can't change output PSI, you can hook it straight up to your tank. This will require the tank being completely empty before you do this.  Get this and this, and screw them together. Use teflon paste for sealant, it is generally capable of withstanding 3000 PSI, although a shop compressor can out out maybe around 250 tops.  Unscrew the fill nipple from your paintball tank and replace it with this contraption. You will also want to use teflon paste to seal here as well. Run your compressor as high as possible, this will allow for better consistency (~100 PSI output from regulator, 250 PSI input to regulator, better recharge rate).  When you decide to replace your normal fill nipple back on to the paintball tank, use teflon paste."

A_irsoft,3dqhal,imarziali,2,Sun Jul 19 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"It is understandable in my opinion.  Jonezy or whatever basically straight up bought source material, cut it, and sold it at slightly less than what HS5 did.  He didn't innovate anything, he just stole HS5's product and undercut him.  I don't know if he even gave HS5 credit.  Understandable if HS5 got pissed.  Shit like that is why he doesn't release his supposed new hop up mod because people will do the same thing again supposedly.  I don't think he ever got mad over people buying their own source material but it was making a profit by copying his idea is the problem."
A_irsoft,3dqhal,RaptureHitler,3,Sun Jul 19 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"I know Brill majorly pissed HS5 off by specifically selling his patches as ""Not RHop"" or something like that."

A_irsoft,3dqhal,imarziali,2,Sun Jul 19 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"I E-Rhop all of my hop up arms with elongated M-Nubs, so, with the greater surface area of the downward pressure on contact patch, radiusing the frontward and backward parts of the patch is necessary to avoid severe pinch jams. I usually measure my M-nub's length based on the barrel window and file the hopup window accordingly. Is p dank, but I've only seen a 50ft or so difference between that and a standard Z-Kit style install with a standard nub like you do, so, essentially, I just do it for keks ;;;;;))))"

A_irsoft,3dkw5d,OGPancakewasd,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:24 2015 UTC,"Well the advantage of the like, wider bore barrels, is that the BB supposedly does occasionally bounce when riding the ceiling of the barrel (probably due to inconsistencies in the bore itself?) and hits the other ""walls"" of the barrel  whereas the wider-bore makes this less likely as the BB needs to bounce more and travel more to hit the other ""walls"" of the barrel.  I could be entirely fucking wrong about that though.  However, an extremely consistent and well-lapped bore will make any of this bouncing far less likely, and should then be extremely accurate.  At the extreme $ levels people seem to like PDI 6.05s that are lapped like fucking mad on AEGs, and PDI 6.08s lapped like fucking mad on HPA."
A_irsoft,3dkw5d,OGPancakewasd,2,Fri Jul 17 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't like the argument over bore diameter as it doesn't really matter as long as you can volume it, but some people go full retard sometimes and ignore physics. And I kinda really want to lap the hell out of a 6.03 and bring it to a 6.04 or something XD"
A_irsoft,3dkw5d,OGPancakewasd,2,Fri Jul 17 23:00:41 2015 UTC,">using ""XD"" unironically? 👌  It is still advantageous to use the wider bore if you have the volume, however the bore quality almost always matters more.  Hence the big spenda$ use PDI that are lapped like mad."

A_irsoft,3d9prb,RHOK4herpleasure,3,Tue Jul 14 18:14:11 2015 UTC,What paint do you usually use?
A_irsoft,3d9prb,RHOK4herpleasure,3,Tue Jul 14 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"Krylon or Rustoleum. I buy Krylon more often though. Rustoleum is great too.   Look for paint that works on plastic and leaves a matte finish. Make sure to clean your gun of oils, dirt, etc before spraying. Do this well. If you spray over oil the paint won't stick. If you spray over dirt, you'll paint the dirt, not the gun, and when the dirt rubs off the paint will go with it.     Most of all, make sure to make multiple light, even coats and not just a few thick ones. It'll take time, don't rush it. Many, even, light coats. Thick coats tend to run and can pile up in crevices and ruin detail, seep under masking tape, and will generally look bad.    Watch a few spray painting tutorials online or something."

Excellent for the price, would recommend, but I changed out the kneepads with tan Emerson airflexes. The ones that come with it are really stiff and hard, but I guess if you like sliding that's good.  I'm a 30 waist with a 32 inseam, and the medium (32x32) fits great length-wise if I'm wearing my riggers belt. Otherwise they're too big at the waist. The built-in waist adjustment doesn't cinch down far enough for me."

A_irsoft,3d775d,dieDoktor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Comparing my War Wolf G3 pants with my Emerson G3 pants... Sizing seems exactly the same except the War Wolf's have slightly longer pant legs. The material is legit ripstop, I don't see the fabric ripping anytime soon, the stitching, however, I wouldn't really be surprised if a seam blew under heavy usage (Such is repro life), but they're holding up well so far.  As with any repro combat clothes: Holy mother of loose threads. The first thing you do is turn that motherfucker inside out and run a lighter over everything. Had to do the same with my Emersons.  It also should be noted that the War Wolfs lack certain features that the Emersons/Cryes have. Namely, the kneepad adjustment bungee and the elastic retaining loops in the big cargo pockets (Those are the only differences I've found so far). The kneepads sit perfectly for me as they are though, so not a huge deal, but everyone's different."

A_irsoft,3cw287,Reascr,9,Sat Jul 11 06:42:53 2015 UTC,"A few reasons.  People really like copying US stuff, and the M4s are already common so converting one to a MK18 is not hard and it uses lots of attachments/externals people would normally attach to M4-type guns anway (PEQ, suppressor, quad RIS etc.)  It also shares the common internals.  It fits a lot of the more popular impressions among impressionists/Milsim people and is relatively easy to make one since there are so many M4 parts anyway.  It is a CQB length gun making it pretty practical for airsoft use in that sense.  It gives all the practicality an M4 has while being somewhat more unique (but still not really that unique, they are about as unique as 416s which are also super common lately)  The tan/FDE color schemes are really popular as of late is probably another reason though a smaller one."
A_irsoft,3cw287,EzDeezer,5,Sat Jul 11 06:49:38 2015 UTC,I find it to be a nice length for both cqb and field.
A_irsoft,3cw287,sokolske,3,Sat Jul 11 07:06:24 2015 UTC,"I thought the MK18 was just an AR platform that bridged the gap between M4 and M16?  If my rudimentary knowledge is correct, people like them because they bridge the gap between field rifle and CQB weapon, which is, of course, bullcrap in airsoft terms, because hop-up."
A_irsoft,3cw287,plagueofunicorns,3,Sat Jul 11 07:14:07 2015 UTC,"MK18 actually uses a CQB length barrel, which is basically advantageous across the board in airsoft really (so long as voluming and all that is corrected obviously)."
A_irsoft,3cw287,EzDeezer,3,Sat Jul 11 07:20:13 2015 UTC,So it's just an M4 with an extended handguard?  I've only ever had volume problems with my long-barrelled gun.  The 509 mm barrel had more volume than the cylinder did and it created a vacuum that would jam the gun when I'd fire it on full auto after a short burst.
A_irsoft,3cw287,plagueofunicorns,3,Sat Jul 11 07:37:11 2015 UTC,"Vacuum?  I don't know if you can actually do that based on how BBwars systems work.  But if you dun goofed hard enough maybe.  Any barrel past like 455mm on AEGs actually starts to become detrimental, unless using a bore up."
A_irsoft,3cw287,EzDeezer,2,Sat Jul 11 07:39:36 2015 UTC,It'd still have a BB in the barrel when the piston would start back again.  I ended up just putting a 455 mm in it and it works great now.
A_irsoft,3cw287,plagueofunicorns,2,Sat Jul 11 07:45:05 2015 UTC,"I thought that ported piston heads would prevent this, and the BB must have been going damn slow for it to not leave the barrel by the time the piston hit the cylinder head.  I'm pretty sure I saw some like tests once where the BB always left before the piston hit.  But maybe I recall wrong."

A_irsoft,3ceuxh,silverhawk75,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"Dark matter is one of the, if not the single most, potent fuel and power source in the show's universe. While the Jovian is a powerful weapon, only the Nibelung seem to be able to control Dark Matter. When she releases it all again, it listens/reacts properly to her control and instead of fucking the Earth this time, it does what it was meant to do the first time and creates a shield. Even though that shield though, the ship was forced to Earth damaged slightly. It also had a minor effect of turning back time on a select few occupants on the ship, the entire crew, rather than also the Gaia fighters."

A_irsoft,3c6ei6,Catbrain,2,Sun Jul 5 11:55:22 2015 UTC,"It's basically SAO, so that's a given   I mean, even after the shitty second half it managed to get a full second season"
A_irsoft,3c6ei6,Catbrain,2,Sun Jul 5 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"Did you stay up all night?   Seriously though. It's ridiculous how popular the characters are right now. What makes me angry is that nothing happened in the first season. All these characters building their keikakus and none of them are fucking explained or resolved. Hell we don't even know the intentions of some of the characters. We don't even know who the Sword Princess is besides her name and how good she is with a sword. Now I have to watch the second fucking season holy shit this is how those shits make money.    I guess it's a fun premise, but it'll never have the writing and the sense of wonder (maybe that's too strong of a phrase) that the first arc of SAO has. Not even Kirito was that much of a Mary Sue."
A_irsoft,3c6ei6,Catbrain,2,Sun Jul 5 12:12:05 2015 UTC,"No, I totally didn't stay up all night  And basically everything there, yup.

Also (bit of a rant) at a fucking anime convention, the only Nichijou shit I saw was a shirt that was sold out, figures that were not even for fucking sale, and two (admittedly high-quality) cosplayers.  edit: back to fucking danmariachi...  Fucking Bell is literally fucking Kirito, in pretty much every way.  They even have the same fucking voice actor!"
A_irsoft,3c6ei6,Shiinashiro,2,Sun Jul 5 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to see Bell and Kirito as similar. Bell doesn't have a personality for Christ's sake.    Bell is just the steriotypical ""I am le good guy with le good morals"" dude. He plays by the rules and he's fucking boring. We get more than enough of these from the many mecha series out there. There's nothing special or unique about him. Nothing! He just finds a goal and tries hard at it and he becomes better than everyone else. And then there's the FUCKING BULLSHIT ARGONAUT ABILITY HOLY SHIT MAKING IT THROUGH ANY FUCKING CHALLENGE THEN WHY HASN'T HE NAILED THE FUCKING BLOND SWORD BITCH YET FUCK.    Not one to be an SAO fanboy, but the writing of SAO, at least the first arc (I actually liked GGO, MR, and Alicization too) was pretty decent. Kirito wasn't a bitch, he got himself laid, and it was explained why he was so good at games. I'm not saying he's a perfect character. He does have flaws. He's just not DanMachi-flawed."
A_irsoft,3c6ei6,Shiinashiro,2,Sun Jul 5 12:35:30 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it, but it was hard to look past the shitty development and harem stuff/fan service. If a second season comes out I'll watch it, but I don't really care if they don't make another season.  Also the OP and ED were shit."

A_irsoft,3bpfbk,ZeroTheKitten,3,Wed Jul 1 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"Same here.  Pick up 2 and 3 if you can, OP, ME2 is probably one of the best Bioware games I've played."
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,mirshe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:52 2015 UTC,It's on my to-do list.  I played it on a friend's tiny TV back in HS when it first came out and had trouble getting into it.  Wanted to make sure I was actually going to enjoy it before I dove in head first.  I'll probably trade in Fallout 3 (since my Xbox doesn't like the disk and refuses to read it 90% of the time) to bring the price down on 2& 3.
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,mirshe,2,Wed Jul 1 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'd also recommend at least the two companion DLCs for ME2 (Zaeed and Kasumi), along with Arrival.  Lair of the Shadow Broker is cool, but Arrival gives you some backstory as to why you're grounded and stripped of rank in ME3 (aside from ""Cerberus is bad, mmkay?"")."
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,mirshe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"What makes the DLC companions good?  Unless it lets me add more infiltrators so we can murder more effectively while still collecting sweet loot, I'm not terribly interested in more companions.  The only ones that I actually find useful are Ash, Wrex, Tali, and sometimes Garrus.  Mostly, I just want my squad to brutally murder the opposition while still allowing me to collect sweet loot.  Also, is there any point in the game where I can focus my character on the skills that I value the most (i.e.: assault rifles, shotguns, and unlocking loot crates)?  I was originally gonna make Shepard an infiltrator, but pistols are rubbish and the sniper rifle is way too situational."
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,mirshe,2,Thu Jul 2 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Zaeed comes with a sniper rifle.  Kasumi lets you get the awesome M-12 Locust SMG, which is leaps and bounds better than the Shuriken and the Tempest.  ME2 works a lot differently on the weapon side as well - you don't get better weapons from loot, you find the base weapons in missions (aside from your starter weapon kits) and you can make it better through spending resources and finding research for more upgrades (research is instant as well).  Infiltrator is much more viable as well in ME2 - you get a time slow effect when you're scoped in, making it much easier to pick off enemies.  Heat buildup is also gone - you have ammunition now in the form of ejectable heat sinks, so each weapon gets a certain amount of shots (the starting sniper rifle is a 1-shot, but it's damned powerful)."
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,mirshe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:19 2015 UTC,"With the heat sinks, do you still have infinite ammo, or will I now be scrambling to find replacement heat sinks?"
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,Jedrokivich,2,Thu Jul 2 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"It's ammo pickups - so yes, you're going to be looking for replacements.  The drop rate is pretty high and they're scattered all over every single map, so it's not like you're going to be looking for a needle in a haystack.  Besides, any heatsink you pick up will work with any weapon, so it's not like there's a difference between sniper rifle ammo and pistol ammo."
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,Catbrain,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:24:16 2015 UTC,Ok. Sweet. Do the pistols actually become worth using as a result?
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,RavenDarkeye,2,Thu Jul 2 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"Currently running an adept, and I'd have to say totally.  The two pistols you can get normally (the Predator and the Carnifex) are both pretty reliable, and there's a DLC pistol called the Phalanx that's really great (and it has a laser sight - who doesn't like lasers?)"
A_irsoft,3bpfbk,Catbrain,2,Thu Jul 2 02:46:41 2015 UTC,Yesss. Shame about the super long elevator rides tho.

A_irsoft,3bpfbk,RavenDarkeye,2,Wed Jul 1 10:24:39 2015 UTC,"There are parts of Halo that I definitely miss.  Mass Effect's soundtrack is garbage, for one.  I also miss the Mjolnir armor that Chief and friends had.  The Mako is a crappy bastard child of a Warthog and Scorpion.  Also, the ability to jump would be cool."

A_irsoft,3bdv4o,Kilroy-was-there,4,Sun Jun 28 15:35:36 2015 UTC,They literally are planes.  The plane backpack shows what plane they are.

A_irsoft,3bdv4o,Reascr,2,Sun Jun 28 16:19:34 2015 UTC,Because you can't make a slice of life comedy manga with jets rolling down the halls.  You need human-like personifications of the planes in order to carry any emotional weight.

Put them in the goddamn fucking rules because that way I would actually know. I don't go on the main sub and look at the comments often, so I wouldn't see. Nor would I see stickies. Besides, the latest sticky doesn't say anything about bandwagoning.  It's entirely by word of mouth. It's unwritten and as such it's unfair to ban someone over it considering the fact that it's not explicitly said that it's not okay"

A_irsoft,3bdgo3,Catbrain,6,Sun Jun 28 05:06:34 2015 UTC,"""No bandwagons"" has been a rule for a while now, ever since the mods lifted the great link post ban after the great DMR Fiasco of 2011-2012.    Vorpal's pretty lenient when it comes to rules too. How can you even complain lol."
A_irsoft,3bdgo3,Reascr,3,Sun Jun 28 05:11:10 2015 UTC,"Because I never post, and it's not in the rules. I read the rules beforehand"

A_irsoft,3bd45k,shadowblade232,3,Sun Jun 28 02:13:25 2015 UTC,So what's the difference between this and simunition? Looks like this is targeted more for Civilians. It is called Civilian Target Ammunition after all...    Right now I'm desperately wanting some CTA and Simunition cartridges to play around with.    Edit: CTA looks cool. Images show what look like rimfire blanks/primers set inside the cartridge.
A_irsoft,3bd45k,Catbrain,2,Sun Jun 28 04:12:54 2015 UTC,It's just simunitions called something else. Nothing different from what I've used.
