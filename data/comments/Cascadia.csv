Cascadia,3e62dw,sixthcolumnist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:06:30 2015 UTC,"I do wish there was terminology to distinguish ""Regulation"" from ""Regulation."" In a memorable chat I had recently with one of the many local libertarians in my life we both got caught in a weird miscommunication. I thought she believed it was a god given right to put Mercury in toothpaste, she thought I loved nothing more than Taxi Medallions as a means to state mandated taxi mafia.  Environmental and Health regulation, while certainly a barrier to entry, doesn't at all seem to me to be comparable to the Taxi Medallion system, which despite what's been called my ""slobbering statism"" is not something I'm particularly gung-ho about. I don't, however, worship Uber as the Ubermensch just because it's flagrantly sidestepping the laws. I think there's a middle way in this particular issue, and a third way in that I'm a pretty big self-driving car fan and I await their coming like a zealot awaits Christ.  Now, in the case of registering businesses and gaining certification and what not, isn't the cost of starting a business largely the actual costs of starting a business? Yelp is a bad example because, first, everyone hates Yelp, but more seriously it's an online service and thus it's costs would be entirely different than the restaurants it routinely exploits. We may be in an age of internet startups, and staunchly in the grips of a service economy, but are the loans, microloans, crowdfunding, and whatnot being swallowed up by the massive overheads of government rather than paying workers, renting space, buying capital, etc? I've heard new business bemoan the taxes after dismal first years, but I don't have any juicy data on the breakdown of the costs of the average new business. I might make that this week's little project, because I'm not entirely satisfied with what's provided in the article's examples of Daycare and Chicago street food.  Zoning is not something I would do away with. Seattle might be straining against improper density zoning, but the examples of no zoning, Houston, is to me roughly everything I dislike and even detest in a city.  The title of this post is actually quite inflammatory, because this little overview and the article it links to are both pretty standard the-market-will-out economic thinking.  While the article makes the case for Daycare liscences increasing the cost of Daycare, and thus costing more for the poor who use the service, it doesn't (in my opinion) provide enough tangible evidence about the thrust of its argument, which it seems to me is:  ""Given that government regulations serve as barriers to entry, is the cost incurred by their implementation by the poor outweighed by the benefits society receives.""  Case by case? Keeping Daycare facilities up to code does play on the heartstrings a little, doesn't it? While Uber's got it's slightly cultish supporters going entirely the other way. The aforementioned keeping-mercury-out-of-toothpaste only upsets the people in my neck of the woods who shop at Wal-Mart on the weekends because they think they live in the ""wilderness"" during the week outside of society.  As for regressive taxation yeah I'm not a fan. But people sort of like sales tax in that it punishes that awful habit of buying luxurious things and doesn't touch that noble habit of earning income, which meshes with that Protestant Work Ethic shtick, and is one example where it completely clashes with the Capitalist Motive of consume consume consume."

Mind you all of this is based on what we know right now, and a single event/sound bite/""scandal"" can drastically alter any race.  The Dems have a limited field so far with O'Malley, Sanders, and Clinton. Biden might jump in, but with one foot perpetually in his mouth, he won't be able to jump very far. Of the other three, as of right now, all three have tremendous downsides: Clinton is Clinton, Sanders is an idealist with none of Obama's demographic advantages, and O'Malley is a bit of an unknown and unknowns are bad news in politics because a) oppo research is ruthless and b) donors like known quantities.  On the GOP side, things are a bit more muddled, but it really boils down (again, as of right now) to three major contenders, the Clown Prince, and a bunch of guys who will likely end up as also-rans.  Trump? Well, he's a jackass. But jackasses can be useful. First off he makes the rest of the GOP guys look tame, almost mainstream in comparison. And that might be his whole play. Second, his schtick is a schtick for sure, but as Will Rogers noted ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" If he somehow manages to win the nomination (unlikely but possible) you'd be a fucking idiot to dismiss him. This is after all, the same country that elected an actor (and not a great one) to the presidency and made Kim Kardashian a superstar  (well, Ray-J's dick made her a superstar, but collectively, we bought it.)  Bush has huge downsides (being a Bush), but if Clinton wins the Dem mom, he's viable and a threat against her.   Walker is the golden boy, he hits all the right notes with the base and if he pulls in Rubio as VP pick, he fragments the Hispanic vote. Do not underestimate his pull with the conservative and even the more liberal Cuban voters in Florida. The same Florida on which so many races have hung.  Rubio has serious demographic advantages, young, Hispanic, minority but not ""that kind"" of minority. He puts on some good showings come debate and primary time, he's another one you'd be stupid to overlook."

Has there been a discussion about that so far?   Improving local government and local democracy and then having the municipalities network is the essence of democratic confederalism, the political system of the revolutionary Kurds in Rojava.

You should check it out if you see how local government is important for us achieving autonomy."

Cascadia,3e1041,thomas533,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"a step toward creating Cascadia?    First, we need to acknowledge that Cascadia already is. We don't need a regional government for Cascadia to exist because Cascadia is a bioregion that existed before we were here and will exist after we are gone. All we can do is decide how we will interact with the region while we are here.  But politically, you are talking about creating systems that are antithetical to how much of the rest of the country thinks. And as long as we are still in a position where we have to ask permission from those people to do the things we want to, they will be roadblocks if for no other reason than on ideological grounds. So, how do we stop that from happening? We first need to push for adherence to the 10th amendment. Once we have that, we can use nullification as a means to block federal overreach and then start making progress on our regional goals.  On an individual level, I think the biggest thing holding us back is that people do not see viable options other than being dependent on the current system. They do not see the possibility of being independent, so why would they put any effort into striving for independence? To that end, we need to create the possibility of autonomy within the system. This can be done by easing zoning restrictions to allow for more intentional communities, outlaw restrictions by municipalities and HOAs that prevent people from growing their own food or urban farming, protectionist laws that allow harmful industries and individuals to create havoc in our communities, allowing for localized currencies, and get rid of government created monopolies (professional licensing requirements which only serve to protect incumbents (taxis, hair dressers, etc.), and public sector unions such as the police). Once people actually have the freedom to start taking care of themselves, I think they will have a greater ability to start focusing on improving communities and our region as a whole."

Anyways, I found a 6 axis accelerometer module for the arduino today. Going to look into the math for determining distance and azimuth for earthquakes, and then talk to some friends down at caltech and see if I can get some shake table time. I will probably want to use a RasPi as a data interface. I think so far I'm in about $70 if you count the arduino, the accelerometer module, and the RasPi. If this ever went into production, I'm sure I could get the cost back down to the $20 mark.

Expand that out to the entire population of WA & OR and you end up at ~$4 each, so it's safe to assume the actual cost is between those figures.  This isn't some huge number. We're talking about the same cost as, say, making sure your apartment or house has basic fire safety (extinguisher + alarms) covered. And that's a one time cost vs every couple years.  Add this to property taxes, since that's where it makes the most sense. These warning systems are effectively in place to allow people to prepare to have buildings collapse on/near them.

The early warning systems are nice in concept but somewhat ineffective.  I'm in Northern Tochigi which is about 150km north of Tokyo.  I also lived through the great Tohoku Earthquake.  By the time my phone warned me.  I was already out the door and into an open space with the staff I work with.  We were out there for hours.  None of us had our phones anymore.  Aftershocks rolled in every twenty or so minutes.   After the big quake, they kept rolling in for weeks.  Maybe 30% of the time we got a warning.  EVERYONEs phone buzzes.  You learn to ignore it.  I think the Japanese are ridiculously used to the ground moving.  If you spend time over here, you eventually fall in line.  There is something about a quake, before it hits, that you'll notice.  If it's big enough, you might even hear it.  The warning system on your phone is USELESS!  ""Woot! Woot! Woot!""  That's all it does.  Is it at 3.0 or 6.0?  I need to sleep, I'm not getting out of bed unless it's over 7.  40 million would be better spent on evacuation routes, educating the public, or reinforcing structures.  An app for your phone is a waste.   It was an 8.4 where I was at.  The app didn't save shit.

Direct democracy works, but it needs to be part of an on-going and participatory process of solidarity building and political education.  The article does make a distinction between referendums and citizens initiatives, however:  Citizen initiatives are democratic mechanisms that let citizens propose and vote on laws and policies. By gathering a certain amount of signatures, citizens can demand a binding vote on a proposed policy or legislation. Citizen initiatives differ from referendums in which citizens only can accept or reject a law or policy proposed by parliament. Switzerland was the first country to introduce citizen initiatives as well as referendums, and several countries, especially in Europe and Latin America have since introduced them at national, state or local levels.  Take the transit referendum, for example. It was (poorly) drafted from the top-down, and presented as a ""yes"" or ""no"" choice."

Cascadia,3cxc5t,romulusnr,2,Sat Jul 11 23:41:57 2015 UTC,"So I'm also in the ""skeptical"" camp over direct democracy... while yes, there are functional examples cited in the work, it fails to bring up the known negatives. Especially in reference to the Consejos Comunales which are acting as a de-facto arm of the government, and are using all the threats, intimidation and violence you would expect from a state apparatus, and have chosen to focus more on the control aspect, than the making life better aspect one would expect.   In many ways, the varied ideas of government have all been tried many many times in both western and eastern histories. Plato preferred his Philosopher Kings, which was met with more disaster than Plato could have imagined.   What is missing from the discussion of how to rule, is what the purview of government actually is. Two modern examples that are significantly different. As long as you're focused on that part of the world, lets look at two ""states"" (yes, I use the term loosely) to describe the Kurdish regions, as well as the Islamic State. Both of which have relatively large populations, have a division between rural and urban.   The Islamic state, is in some ways both a participatory democracy, as well as a hierarchy. That is, if you participate and have the right religion/ideology, you get a vote. At the same time, while local commanders can exercise force on the ground, there are certain degrees of freedom within the organization. (I use freedom in the mechanical sense) However, at a base level, IS despite it's penchant for executing apostates and heretics in creative ways is the last thing I would ever tolerate. Even if they could keep the lights on, water flowing from the tap, and a place for my sewage to go. I would use my rather significant industrial and martial expertise to annihilate them.   The Kurdish region, by comparison, has much the same focus, keep the lights on, keep the water flowing, make the sewage go away, pick up the trash, and make sure farm products get to market. While still being a sunni dominated majority, it has a near western style liberal approach to governance, in that it limits it's efforts tot he above. It is in much the same way as IS, still a participatory democracy.   What I think the major sticking point in my mind is, if the lights are on, the water is flowing, and the trash is picked up, government has done it's job. Even if that government means I installed a well, solar panels, and built a trash incinerator. When government crosses the line and begins interfering with the day to day lives of it's citizenry, we should do more to question whether that government even needs to exist.   I am a minority, a minority of one. I work with other minorities of one where our interests overlap. Whether that means fighting a group that hangs people like us from construction cranes because we are homosexuals, believe in a different religion (that includes no religion), or have a different ideology. Killing and war, are unacceptable except in defense. However to mount said defense, we need to have the capacity to enact both. The offer of direct democracy, is often a hollow one. The offer to be oppressed by a plurality of the citizenry is really no better than an offer to be oppressed by a king.   Perhaps, as Thoreau said, ""That government is best which governs not at all"". There was no reference in that quote to whether that government should be a democracy, a republic, or a tyranny."

Hell, lets make potlatches a thing again and start giving people a free meal if they're willing to sit through speeches and debates for a few hours. The problem with modern politics is the lack of discourse. Voting isn't important, hashing out the issue with your neighbors until you come to a compromise is what matters.

The notion that the role that citizens must be complacent constituents/tax payers rather than a part of a participatory body politic is profoundly alienating, and leads to an enormous sense of cynicism towards any sort of local politics."

Photorealistic?) quality of the tree silhouette is jarring to me. It looks cheap, like its been pasted onto the otherwise clean flag design from a paint program. If I were drawing it from memory in black and white, I'd draw the triband with lines and then sketch that incorrect Christmas tree everyone draws with the branches going down.  But it's fairly iconic and there's very little threat of it flying outside the United Nations and so no need for me to be embarrassed about it. No real purpose in dividing an already entirely theoretical movement by swapping around flags. Although I think most everybody goes through two or three flags at least, and people seem to manage.  Really it's the sentiment of the all locally produced flag that's more Cascadian than any symbol, and even if I think it pales in comparison to native energy production or local hop microbrews or bioregion protection, at least there's a sense of propriety.  Honestly though, being American sort of propagandizes you to think too much of flags anyway, what with our worship of that one with the stars.

""Flying outside the United Nations"" ... its a bioregional flag not a nation-state flag ... if Cascadians every really did throw off the imperial occupying nation-states of Canada and the US I hope we would have enough common sense to not support the UN sense it is meaningless ever since the US and UK with their Axis of Corporate Filth invaded Iraq.

I do, as I said, respect the move to produce the flag locally regardless of my opinions on the design itself, which is why I said my comment was mostly indulging flag fetishism on my part."

Then we condemn those areas as dangerous and further make it worse.  I mean Portland is the whitest city in the entire country. That's racism man and white supremacy.   My point is you don't need to be a member of the KKK to be racist and you don't have to wear a swastika to take part in and further pushing a white supremacist ideal.

You seem to think I have some agenda. I don't. I took the effort to find many sources for you to read if I wasn't making my point clear. Your response was to say fuck it. I can't make you discuss this if you don't want to.   Being a blatant white supremacist (KKK & Neo-Nazis) is different than white supremacy in general. Housing discrimination is a form of white supremacy for example. It can be overt or systematic. The way wealth is divided among racial groups is another example of how white supremacy contributes to poverty. The fact a black man/woman couldn't buy a house on capitol hill in the 60s has a ripple affect since ~70% of wealth is inherited. This is just an example of what I'm talking about. There wasn't any name calling. I don't know you and you don't seem like a racist douche but you seem to be ignoring the real harm racism causes in our society at systematic level.

It's just like the guy wearing the nazi arm band on the ferry a few weeks ago.   What I think has been rather lost in the narrative over the last few weeks is that to some the rebel flag doesn't carry that same historical baggage, but has been adopted as some kind of colloquial standard for themselves. In a big way, this is really what the debate over the flag is, those who argue that it's historical are right... to a point. However, that is not the rational for their embrace of it, their embrace, and the reason why it's offensive is because of it's contemporary use as a symbol for the KKK and other racist groups.   With this in mind, we can do as the author pointed out and ""assume anyone bearing the flag is an idiot"", which is probably the best course of action in the near term. The other option is direct conflict, which is going to be a long term war of attrition. I don't think the public in general has the stomach for that. But I could be wrong."

Cascadia,3c1ekl,RichShirtNixSun,33,Fri Jul 3 21:41:57 2015 UTC,American cheese is plastic. Tillamook fo' life!
Cascadia,3c1ekl,SixAlarmFire,13,Fri Jul 3 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"Man, that's a tough call... I completely agree with both viewpoints. However ""american cheese"" really didn't exist until the advent of advanced industrial food processing. IIRC it was somewhere around the 1910 that processed cheese became a thing, by mixing cheese with sodium phosphate (an emulsifier) and adding powdered whey and other byproduct additives that increased it's protein content. (in most cheese making, the whey is wasted, or used for making other cheeses, it's low in fat, but high in protein). In many ways, as the author argues, it is most decidedly american.   The point of contention I have with Tillamook's argument, is that I don't really consider ""american cheese"" to be cheese at all. It's simply the end product of nutritional reduction, something that should only be recognizable as cheese to spacefarers due to the inability to manufacture cheese in micro-gravity, and the real stuff spoiling due to long storage times."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,sixthcolumnist,17,Fri Jul 3 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"Yea it is more of an ""American Cheese Food Product.""  Perhaps Tillamook should start calling itself ""Cascadian Cheese."""
Cascadia,3c1ekl,sixthcolumnist,10,Fri Jul 3 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"One of my best memories is my aunt saying ""here, go cook these burgers"" and me asking ""is this your beef"" (she runs a cattle ranch) ""yea, it was a steer a week ago. Oh here, and put cheese on it"" and handed me about 2lbs of extra sharp tillamook cheddar.   Really, all it needed was some blue cheese/feta crumbles and sauteed mushrooms and it would have been THE PERFECT BURGER."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,sixthcolumnist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:12:10 2015 UTC,NICE!  Though you do know what Anton LaVey says about blue cheese ;)
Cascadia,3c1ekl,sixthcolumnist,2,Sat Jul 4 01:15:49 2015 UTC,As long as he said it was awesome. If not fuck that guy.
Cascadia,3c1ekl,snerp,3,Sat Jul 4 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"“WHAT DRESSING WOULD YOU LIKE ON YOUR SALAD?"" the waiter inquired.  “Blue cheese,"" I said.  LaVey and Barton exchanged a look, then returned to their menus. Unknowingly, I had just failed the LaVey Salad-Dressing Test. According to The Satanic Witch, his guide for lovelorn sorceresses, ""dominant, masculine archetypes [like LaVey) prefer sweet dressings, such as French, Russian, Thousand Island,"" because the smell resembles the odor of a woman's sexual organs. Blue cheese, on the other hand, is “reminiscent of a locker full of well-worn jockstraps."" It is suitable, really, only for wimps and submissive females. LaVey ordered the twenty-two-ounce porterhouse steak, rare.   Take with a good does of sarcasm. ;)"
Cascadia,3c1ekl,aeromechanicalace,4,Sat Jul 4 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm going to stick with my original thesis. I'm dubious of ""dominant, masculine archetypes"" who wear that much satin and write self help books for women that idealize themselves.   ""Were I Alexander, I too would wish to be Diogenes"" - Diogenes to Alexander the Great"
Cascadia,3c1ekl,compbioguy,2,Sat Jul 4 09:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm dubious of ""dominant, masculine archetypes"" who wear that much satin and write self help books for women that idealize themselves.   LoL totes.   Bonus points for Diogenes, one of the greatest philosophers."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,vanisaac,14,Sat Jul 4 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"Lol. People are actually defending American ""Cheese"".  Btw, is Tillamook a nationwide brand, or just Cascadia? I used to think it was just in Oregon, then I moved to Seattle and it's still here."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,sixthcolumnist,7,Sat Jul 4 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"Since it's made in Cascadia, whether or not it's available elsewhere, i consider it Cascadian Cheese. It is also the best cheese (at least to me)."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,romabit,2,Sat Jul 4 08:16:46 2015 UTC,"They have it everywhere, but elsewhere it is much more spendy than it    is here."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,DTLAgirl,2,Sat Jul 4 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Trader Joes has kosher medium cheddar, Costco has big blocks of sharp and others, can't recall if whole foods has it. That's in the Midwest. Hard to find"
Cascadia,3c1ekl,smacksaw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"Back east, Costco doesn't have the baby loafs, though. They only have the bricks of presliced Tillamook medium cheddar."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,chuckluckles,2,Sat Jul 4 07:27:31 2015 UTC,"You can get ""tillamook"" anywhere, but certain varieties are only available in the PNW, and even then, some of them are only available at the factory. (IIRC the extra-sharp white is only available at the factory)  I've been to the factory twice, really cool spot, but way out of the way. It's about a 2 hour trip from longview (if you're driving south from seattle) unknown how long it is from portland, but one guy said it took 3+ hours going the other way."
Cascadia,3c1ekl,vanisaac,3,Sat Jul 4 10:00:10 2015 UTC,"We buy the ""reserve"" extra sharp white at a gourmet grocer in Seattle. It's awesome"
Cascadia,3c1ekl,brakos,2,Sat Jul 4 14:10:29 2015 UTC,I pay an ungodly $8 for a block of their colby down here in L.A..
Cascadia,3c1ekl,erly,2,Sat Jul 4 04:09:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I can get it in Vermont for $9/lb  Or I can get Cabot for $4/lb or less.

Cascadia,3bz4tc,pdxcascadian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Ugly? It's not huge or even very obvious. It's on the back of a sign for a fountain. Do you get bent out of shape when you see them on the back of stop signs? Doubtful.  People are acting like it was placed on some Roman ruin or a painting in a museum.  Honestly, I put 30+ of those stickers all over Kavala, Greece and Exarcheia in Athens. It's what people do there. When I was in Barcelona it was the same way (I was out of stickers by that point in my trip). Google Exarcheia and you'll see what I mean."
Cascadia,3bz4tc,Ghoztt,2,Fri Jul 10 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, tell yourself whatever you want to justify what is unsightly and disrespectful to others.

Cascadia,3bz4tc,B_Provisional,7,Fri Jul 3 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Not only is it petty vandalism, but its just downright un-neighborly. It sends the message that when Cascadians travel abroad, we give zero fucks for the places they visit - that we are disrespectful louts. This act runs, in my mind at least, completely contrary to the ideological underpinnings of this endeavor.  This community is pretty damned disappointing lately."
Cascadia,3bz4tc,abcdugl23,4,Fri Jul 3 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"this is why nobody takes your movement seriously, limp wrist shit like this"
Cascadia,3bz4tc,MakesComment,3,Fri Jul 3 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"If someone gets enormously bent out of shape about a sticker, they ought to reconsider what they think is important and try to lighten up."

Cascadia,3bz4tc,ihminen,2,Mon Jul 6 01:38:38 2015 UTC,This is stupid. Don't vandalize property. I'm as annoyed by this as I would be if some Basque separatist stuck a sticker on the Space Needle.

Cascadia,3bz4tc,pdxcascadian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:26:34 2015 UTC,Vandalism is a stretch. A sticker can easily be peeled off. If it were a huge graffiti piece I'd think it were disrespectful.
Cascadia,3bz4tc,MacThule,0,Fri Jul 10 19:14:41 2015 UTC,It looks like someone already did!!
