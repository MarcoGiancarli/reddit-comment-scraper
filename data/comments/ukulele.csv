I've never had tuning machines grind even at high tension. They just get harder to turn. If it's really a grinding sound then it could be that they are starting to fail. If it's more of a 'frictiony' sound ( sorry don't know else to describe it) it could be a string binding at the nut or slipping on the post."

ukulele,3e2g9i,bazmaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:54 2015 UTC,Yes - the solid still uses strips - but the strips are solid bamboo. The laminate version just has an outer veneer that looks like bamboo.

ukulele,3e311q,moysayss,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:26 2015 UTC,Not necessarily - perfectly normal to tune a banjolele to re-entrant G on the 4th string.  Can be IDENTICAL to a regular uke

You should be able to pick it right up. I have a Gold Tone which I love. It sounds great, and is a really well-made instrument.  It looks like they sell for a little under $500 now though. Lanikai, Kala and other brands make models which are most likely a bit more affordable (closer to $300 range).

ukulele,3e1ks3,Ryto,8,Tue Jul 21 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make a difference what scale you are using and not impossible.  The only thing is practice. These sort of chords require fingers to go into positions that they are not used to, but I promise that if you persevere, what seems impossible now you will look back on in the future and laugh at why you struggled.  Certainly don't ignore them - barre chords are the basis of so much more on the ukulele you will encounter further down the line (particularly inversions or moveable chords)  Incidentally, a Bb doesn't need a full barre - you are only barring strings 1 and 2 at the first so what I would do is this  Put ring finger on the 4th string 3rd fret, but middle finger on 3rd string 2nd fret, then put the pointer on 2nd string 1st fret. Then kind of adjust your grip and roll that pointer finger down to cover off the 4th string. Keep  your thumb firmly planted on the back of the neck."
ukulele,3e1ks3,bazmaz,3,Tue Jul 21 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"u/bazmaz cound't say it any better. Just got to practice. It will come with time. Regarding the different types of uke, some people say that fingersize/size of uke doesn't matter and I feel it can be true. If you really put in enough effort you won't have a problem whether you're playing a soprano or tenor. I however feel that soprano ukes are too small for my fat and long fingers, but only when I play in the upper region of the neck."
ukulele,3e1ks3,YupCallMeRoach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:31 2015 UTC,In reality - there just isn't that much difference in space between sopranos and concerts. In fact I own some sopranos with MORE space than most concerts - because they have wider nuts. That is where the space change is noticeable.  Profile of the back of the neck has an impact too.
ukulele,3e1ks3,bazmaz,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:38 2015 UTC,Does your uke have a lot of space under the strings? Check this out...

ukulele,3dzsav,TeeVex,4,Tue Jul 21 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"The good news is, for ukulele, you can go decently far along not needing to know how to read sheet music. First, you should look up the basic lessons; how to tune and how to strum. Then, look up the c chord, a minor chord, and f chord. Then, find some songs with these chords, songs that you know, and putting them together should feel pretty natural. Once you've mastered that song, begin to learn other chords through other songs. And once you feel really comfortable with chords songs, then that's when you need to start learning advanced theory for finger picking! But you can play songs for friends/other people just with chords and your voice."
ukulele,3dzsav,cuddly_cuttlefish,3,Mon Jul 20 22:07:20 2015 UTC,What are some good beginner songs for the uke?
ukulele,3dzsav,TeeVex,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"I suggest The Ukulele Teacher on YouTube, his videos offer simplified chords for many popular songs.   I used his videos for my first month and by the end I had learned all of my major and minor chords as well as some other more complex ones.   Also music stores have lots of excellent books for beginners that teach you basics as well as some easy to learn songs.   Congrats on your wise decision :D.  STRUM ON!"
ukulele,3dzsav,Invisible_girlfriend,3,Tue Jul 21 01:10:11 2015 UTC,Learn these four chords and you can play 80% of all pop music out there. What would you like to start with? :)

ukulele,3dzsav,UkuleleFoSho,0,Tue Jul 21 08:14:44 2015 UTC,"Learn the 1564 chord progression. It will help you play a lot of songs. (C, G, Am, F)"
ukulele,3dzsav,YupCallMeRoach,2,Tue Jul 21 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"The great thing about ukulele is that pretty much anyone can learn it as long as the put in time and effort to learn. There is some good advice about basics in this comment thread. If you really want to learn how to read music, musictheory.net is a good place to start."
ukulele,3dzsav,bnolsen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"For learning to read music (traditional notes and score) i would really consider another instrument like a bass guitar or an ocarina.  Guitars and ukuleles work very well with chord sheets (sing and strum and/or picking patterns) and tabs (picking).  You'll learn chord progressions as you gain experience and hopefully be able to work things out by ear, all without ever really needing to learn formal skills.  Uncle rod's boot camp is great for beginner exercises.  Work through those for the first few months."
ukulele,3dzsav,2_A_G,0,Tue Jul 21 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"If your fingers are big it might actually be easier to play a concert sized uke! I have pretty sausage-esque fingers so I prefer the tenor sized and larger, but I also play the guitar so that may be where the preference comes from. Also this book was extremely helpful for me. It has all the chord ""shapes"" in there which IMO is easier than learning all the notes. My experience has shown me that creating music has been the most helpful and the biggest driving factor behind learning new songs so don't hold yourself back once you get started - even if it's silly, even if you only play your songs to yourself!"
ukulele,3dzsav,bazmaz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:38 2015 UTC,This is a myth. The difference in space on the neck between soprano and concert ukuleles is minor. Nut width has more to do with space. I own some sopranos with more space on the necks than most concerts and comparable to some tenors - because they have wider nuts.  Some of the biggest guys I know play ukuleles smaller than sopranos.
ukulele,3dzsav,bnolsen,2,Tue Jul 21 08:13:22 2015 UTC,The scale length only gets to be an issue for playing chords up the fretboard.  And there's plenty of people who never even go there.
ukulele,3dzsav,bazmaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:24 2015 UTC,True that
ukulele,3dwrev,UkuleleFoSho,11,Mon Jul 20 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"One can play the chords and the other can play a lead, maybe going higher up the neck. This I think would be most common.  Or they can play different voicings of the same chords. Or they can play two different chords which, when played over one another, create an interesting chord. For example one uke playing an Am and another playing a C at the same time effectively creates an Am7. Or they could play the same or similar chords with different rhythms, maybe one fingerpicking or something.   So, basically, there's a lot of options."
ukulele,3dwrev,otherben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:15 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the other ukulele playing a G make an Am7 chord?
ukulele,3dwrev,LionsOfDavid,7,Mon Jul 20 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"A G note, yes, but not a G chord. Am7 is ACEG, Amin is just ACE, but a C chord is CEG, which, when played over Amin, completes the Am7. A G chord would add GBD, which would be quite dissonant."
ukulele,3dwrev,reydeguitarra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:56:36 2015 UTC,Cmaj7add9?
ukulele,3dwrev,otherben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the Am + G? That's close to a Cmaj7add9, which would be CEGBD, but you're missing the A from the Am chord. When you add that back in, it adds quite a bit of dissonance. If you mean playing a Cmaj and a Gmaj chord together, then you are right, that would make a Cmaj7add9 because CEG + GBD gives you all the right notes.  Actually, playing an Am + Gmaj gives you ACEGBD, which is technically Am11. From the scale, that's 1,b3,5,b7,9,11."

ukulele,3dwrev,PapaStevesy,3,Mon Jul 20 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"I think that the most common thing would be one uke playing chords that fit in a key (just look for the C row here, so Am, Dm, F, G, etc.) while the other plays a scale in the same key. A good example scale would be C major pentatonic.  You can experiment with these small things for a huge amount of time, and even create your own songs. I can only recommend it."
ukulele,3dwrev,not_sane,4,Mon Jul 20 06:32:25 2015 UTC,Harmonies  Lead and rhythm  Many things really. In fact I really dislike the sound of two or more ukuleles all playing the same chords.
ukulele,3dwrev,bazmaz,2,Mon Jul 20 09:09:15 2015 UTC,"When my girlfriend and I pair two ukes together I usually play the rhythm chords on a tenor/6-string tenor and she picks an ""alternate-melody"" playing the lead on a soprano uke. I think it sounds pretty cool - here's ""The Moon Song"" by Karen O and also ""How to be Dead"" by Snow Patrol; we did them for the r/ukulele challenges during the winter!

They come with Aquila strings, so no need to change them. The strings will stretch a lot at first, but once they settle in you should have no tuning problems. Remember, musical instruments are essentially precision tools and for the most part, you get what you pay for."
ukulele,3dwya6,PhillyDeeWilliams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:07:36 2015 UTC,"I would class these as 'cheap' and 'low midprice'. I have a few cheap ukes - and some expensive ones - I think cheap ukes are great. You can chuck them about, hand them to newbies, use them as a paddle if stuck at sea..... all no worries.  However, for a first uke, I'd go mid price. You won't know if any problems are you, or the uke.... and you don't want the uke to be fighting you. If you buy a cheap uke, you'll either give up, or want the better uke anyway. Either way, it's a false economy. (That said, if you buy the better uke, you may want to get a cheap one to chuck in your car!)  Also, get a clip on tuner (chromatic or branded for uke, doesn't matter).... and when you first get new strings, they will go out of tune, a lot. Ebay has lots of these cheaply.  Also, get a packet of fresh strings to put in a drawer so when you do the almost inevitable over-tightening, you can change the strings.  A cheap uke can be very good.... and it can be very dead, at worse, frets might not be accurately placed (or the strings might be miles from fretboard. You are getting a bigger variation."

ukulele,3dpivz,LarryLove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:05:25 2015 UTC,"It's a Baritone. The extra bridge should definitely not be there, and I would take it off when you change the strings.   I'm not sure about string ends on bari sets but if they do have ball ends it should be fine, so long as it is an actual baritone ukulele string set."
ukulele,3dpivz,juliankoster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"I wonder why that extra bridge was put there, it's different wood from the back one.  How do i take it off?  I'm thinking a hot exacto knife underneath to loosen the glue.   Might not do that one so soon until im ready to restain, on the other hand, I wonder how it affects the sound."
ukulele,3dpivz,juliankoster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:31 2015 UTC,It looks like it should be just held there by string tension. Try removing the strings and see if it just comes off.   It will greatly affect the sound because the intonation will be incorrect and every fret will play out of tune. It's gotta go.
ukulele,3dpivz,darncomp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:13:29 2015 UTC,It's definitely glued on.

Is difficult to imagine that it's an improvement, but someone added it for a reason.  It shortens the length to something like a tenor uke.  Your dad must have had something in mind with it. Certainly makes it unusual. If it were my dad's, I think I might leave it alone in honor of him rather than change it back to a boring old plain Jane bari."
ukulele,3dp7om,FarmerJones,5,Sat Jul 18 03:11:05 2015 UTC,No. It's a small crack which requires no care at this point.
ukulele,3dp7om,Ebonyks,6,Sat Jul 18 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely looks like a crack. But is it split right through the wood or just superficial?  If it's right through, it can travel and get worse as the top is under constant tension.  Contrary to the advice on this post below - cracks CAN be fixed with a permanent solution. Take it to a good luthier and they can easily fix this."
ukulele,3dp7om,bazmaz,3,Sat Jul 18 09:35:26 2015 UTC,"It looks like it goes straight through. Turning the uke to the side, you would be able to see this split through the soundboard. I'll take it to a couple shops when I get home, but this uke has to fly across the country again first.   Hold together, precious uke!"
ukulele,3dp7om,bazmaz,3,Sat Jul 18 13:25:45 2015 UTC,If you are concerned - loosen the strings while you travel with it - that's what I would do - remove as much tension from the top as you can.

ukulele,3dp7om,Qgraffiti,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"My only reason for concern is it looks like a two piece top and that is right along the seam. Normally where it's glued is actually even stronger than the wood, but if it wasn't glued well you could have an issue. That said, it is small and probably going to be fine. Just continue to take good care of the instrument, and watch it if it grows, especially down the seam."

I though it was lost forever but found it in the basement after a trip back home. Some questions:  What kind of uke is it? (baritone?).  How do I find out what year it was made? It's a Favilla, The number stamped inside is 10422.  Is it normal to have two steel and two nylon strings?  What kind of strings does it need? The pegs are very tight, should I just replace them or is there a way to lubricate/loosen them so they turn easier? I don't want to sand / restain the body so what's the best way to clean it up?  I have the lemon oil for the fret board, I'll clean that when I change the strings.    Any other advice/etc will be appreciated, thanks!"
ukulele,3dn9cp,avenger331,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"That second bridge looks out of place.

Obviously you have more info on its history than I, but that's just what I observe about it."
ukulele,3dn9cp,nobo13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:27 2015 UTC,"No real input here, but I'm just commenting because of how unusual it is.  I've never seen a second bridge like that before, and having two steel strings as well is a bit weird.  It certainly looks like a baritone. Best way to tell is to measure to the 12th fret. If it's more than 7.5 inches then yeah it's a baritone. If it's about 7.5 it's a concert, less than it's a soprano but I doubt it's that one.  My advice is to replace the friction tuners with new ones, and get some nylon strings for it. I don't think there are readily available steel strings for ukes these days.  But cool uke anyway!"
ukulele,3dn9cp,bamboozlingvideos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"It looks like a baritone to me. I've seen two steel and two nylon strings on baritones before, so it's not weird, but some people complain about the different tones and sustains (I've only seen it on a baritone). If you can, try tune the ukulele to DGBE which are the 4 highest strings on a guitar. You can loosen the tuners by loosening the screw a tiny bit, but make sure they still have plenty of resistance or they'll slip. If the tuners are impossible to turn, or slip after you tune them, you might need to buy new tuners (but they're supposed to be hard to turn because they're friction tuners, so give them a good turn.)  I don't know how to put in new tuners, but it's not too hard.  You should change the strings, as those strings are really old/probably not very good (Aquila is a pretty good brand but other people have other preferences; make sure you get baritone length though). You can get the strings online or at your local music store (if it's a good music store), and string them by yourself, or the store might do it for you. If you do have a local music store and they repair ukuleles, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have them look at it.  Also it would be a good idea to look around for any cracks. Look all over the body for cracks (the scrapes don't look too bad, I don't think you have to worry about them), and then look inside the sound hole with a flashlight to make sure everything is good. Then I would tap the sound board all over to make sure there isn't any buzzing or you might have some broken bracing.   The second bridge is what really confuses me. I don't know what it's for. You can read more about the brand Favilla here: http://www.catfish1952.com/favilla.html. There is an email on the webpage, and I recommend you send an email and figure it out. Depending how old your dad was when he got it, it's most probably from the 50s.  You can see if anyone else has any tips on cleaning it."
ukulele,3dn9cp,Salvatorigoozmo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/0ociDev http://imgur.com/IFTISi7  Update:  I took it over to guitar center and got some stuff for it.  I took off the old strings, polished the body with music nomad cleaner/polish and restrung it with Martin Baritone strings. I polished the fretboard with lemon oil.   I also heated up an exacto knife and pried off that extra bridge.  It came off easily.  (Everyone I talked to told me to remove the extra bridge, but in retrospect, I wish I'd left it and restrung it with it just to see how it sounded.  Oh well, It came off cleanly and I can reglue it someday if I want to).  As for the sound, at first I tuned it DGBE but those pegs are TIGHT, as are the strings.  I loosened the peg screws a bit and it helped but still wary of overtightening and it does get out of tune quickly. Is there any kind of oil/solvent that might help?  I then tuned it to GCEA and it seems to hold that tuning a bit better.  I'll retune back to DGBE at some point I suppose when the strings loosen up a bit more.  It sounds pretty good, it has a nice lush timbre to it, but I'm not crazy about the tuning situation.   To look perfect it will need to be sanded/restrained but I'm not sure how to deal with the detail around the sound hole. (tape it? Idk, I probably will not restain it).  Thanks for all of your interest/ comments."

ukulele,3dkmxl,OtherSilhouette,4,Fri Jul 17 01:08:21 2015 UTC,"Chords are all the same with a low G, and the fingerpicking is only different when you use the G string (especially when you are doing it in the Campanella style, letting the notes ring out and playing on alternate strings, more common in classical arrangements.) A low G is good for playing a bass line and chords at the same time though.  If you want to get a lower tone, I suggest you either simply get used to it, sing low like Stephin Merritt, or invest in a baritone ukulele."
ukulele,3dkmxl,bamboozlingvideos,6,Fri Jul 17 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to play lower notes, switch to baritone uke -- or switch to guitar. The ukulele's range is one of the things that makes it a ukulele, and trying to change it too much kind of defeats the purpose of playing one. Having said that, I will admit that I've tuned it down a step once or twice to accommodate the tuning of wind instruments. When you put on a low G the finger picking changes simply because your G is now the lowest string, and you have to play different patterns than you're used to, to take advantage of the string. It can be a fun challenge."

ukulele,3dgzdl,vincentleone,2,Thu Jul 16 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about left hand problems? Let's break them down a bit.   If your fingers aren't pushing down hard enough, they'll mute the string or make an awkward noise. Make sure that you're pushing with the tips of your fingers, and not the pads. In addition, practice finger isolation exercises to help move your fingers independently. That will help other fingers get into place and out of the way when they're not being used.   For fitting 3 fingers onto a single fret, once again, use the tips of your fingers. If that's still not working, you may need a larger uke. How large are your hands, and what size uke do you have?   For bar chords, it's often just a problem of finger strength and wrist position. Coming from the violin, I think I hold my uke a bit differently from most, but I don't grip the neck in the area between my thumb and index finger. Instead, I have the center joint of my thumb right in the middle of the neck, letting me squeeze harder as well as reach further."
ukulele,3dgzdl,meant2live218,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:59:12 2015 UTC,"I have about average size hands but longer, skinnier fingers. My uke is a soprano"
ukulele,3dgzdl,meant2live218,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I'd recommend getting a larger uke. I have average hands (for a 5' 8"" Chinese guy), and can reach a 10th on a standard keyboard (C to a higher E), and also had the bonus of already playing piano, violin, and guitar, and I still got a tenor as my first uke. My other one is a concert. I can't imagine playing on a soprano, go check out a music store and see if a concert or tenor uke is easier on your fingers."
ukulele,3dgzdl,meant2live218,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:38 2015 UTC,I also have been playing piano for a decent amount of time; the uke is my first string instrument.

ukulele,3dgzdl,The_Slad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:56:33 2015 UTC,You'll get the proper strength and cordination with time. Just have to have the patience to develop those attributes. Can also pick up a gripmaster or something like it to quicken the pace at which your finger strength develops.
ukulele,3dgzdl,Ebonyks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"You might want to consider getting a bigger uke. I started on a soprano and my fingers were way to cramped. Bigger ukuleles are also louder too ;)  Also when it comes to putting three fingers on one fret, like a D chord, I instead use my index or middle finger and do a kind of partial barre, laying my finger flat across the strings and bending it up at the first knuckle so that it doesn't press the A string. This is also how I play and E chord, but with my ring finger instead.  But above all, keep practicing. And remember: Practice DOES NOT make perfect! PERFECT practice makes perfect! If you're practicing a song and you muffle a chord, don't just go on. Stop and play that chord change very slow and methodically until you can play it right."
ukulele,3dgzdl,retractableclause,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"It's not clear from your post what your problem is. It's likely an issue with your technique or your instrument, but it's not clear if you're muting the strings with your left or right hand.   As for barring notes, practice, practice practice. I know it's frustrating, but you'll develop the muscles and learn how to hold a bar chord in a month or two, I promise."

ukulele,3dbqj5,bazmaz,2,Wed Jul 15 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"No ukulele can ever arrive with a totally full setup for one reason - that the dealer cannot know what sort of action the player prefers.   But when I talk about setups, I really mean pre-flight checks - checking the tuners are tight, that the saddle height is within reasonable tolerances and the nut too.  Beyond that, it's for the player to adjust them. Some people are scared to do that which amazes me - the bridge is DESIGNED to be adjusted!"
ukulele,3dbqj5,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:04:40 2015 UTC,Is there an easy way to check for those essential aspects you listed?
ukulele,3dbqj5,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:28:01 2015 UTC,"Bridge height - measure distance between bottom of string and top of 12th fret. Maximum should be ⅛ inch. Some people like it lower, but too low and it will buzz  Nut - hold down string at third fret. String should only just kiss the top of the first fret with no pressure. If there is loads of daylight the nut is too high. If the string presses on the first fret, the nut is too low."
ukulele,3dbqj5,The_Slad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"For the nut, is that for all of the strings?"
ukulele,3dbqj5,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:25 2015 UTC,Yes - check each string individually.
ukulele,3dbqj5,greatsc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"So I just did this with my baritone, looks like the nut is a bit too high; there is 1/32"" between the string and first fret when pressing at the third fret. The bridge looks a little low, there is 1/16"" between the twelfth fret and the strings.  Should I change them or just let them be? And if I should adjust, what is the proper way of lowering the nut and raising the bridge?"
ukulele,3dbqj5,LionsOfDavid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:24:55 2015 UTC,All depends on your intonation and playability.    At the bridge - if you are getting an accurate one octave higher and the 12th and the playability is ok - do nothing. If you have an issue with either - its worth lowering  For the nut - you need some nut files with a rounded base to sand them down a bit - but it's a very careful job - go too low and you have bigger issues. Go to wide and you create issues. Change the 'break angle' and you affect intonation on the whole neck.
ukulele,3dbqj5,LionsOfDavid,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:05 2015 UTC,You don't need to pay anything to learn songs. Just look up tabs online

ukulele,3dbqj5,bazmaz,2,Wed Jul 15 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the wonderful world of ukes! I'm not sure where you're located, but Kala has a database of dealers in the US, if you're wary of buying off Amazon.  Lessons aren't necessary. There are a ton of youtube tutorials, ranging from 'Jake Shimabukuro 2.0' to 'I just picked up a ukulele'. With that being said, it wouldn't hurt to sign up for a beginner's class. You get a better understanding of music theory this way, and when you inevitably find your hands in a weird position, it's always nice to have someone there to tell you either ""Yeah, that's not right"" or ""That's just how it is. Time to start working out some new muscle groups :)"".  Ukuleles fresh out of the factory aren't always set up right. The strings might not sit right, or the frets might not be perfectly level. One of the advantages of a dealer is that the they will fix all of these issues, and tune it up for you to boot. Plus, most music shops are happy to help if you have any problems after taking your instrument home."
ukulele,3dbqj5,ashenfield,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:53:27 2015 UTC,"Alright, sweet!   I may just get the Uke off of Amazon, and pray that a local store will help set it up, since I can't find the Kala by itself on any distributer."
ukulele,3dayau,fernald-abreu,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"Well done! Looking at the tabs now, I just realized I could've done a regular 0003 for my C instead of the bar variation on some parts. You did a good job with this."
ukulele,3dayau,wapaking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:09:40 2015 UTC,Noob here. Can someone eli5 or link me to tutorial on how to read these tabs? So far I've only used chord tabs.
ukulele,3dayau,fernandizzel,3,Tue Jul 14 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say I'm only a late beginner, but hopefully I can help.  First up, I think only this is technically a ""tab."" When it's just the chords, it's called the chords. As for reading it, you'll notice there are four lines that seem to go to together on it. These are the four ukulele strings.  The letter on the left of the rows shows which chord it is. Because it is AECG, it's the standard tuning of the ukulele, but as if you were looking at it from above.  And for reading which notes to play, you read it like an English book (as opposed to Japanese/Arabic) so Left to Right.  If numbers appear together vertically, you play them together, but other than that, you put a finger on the # fret that the notes in the tab says. So for this tab, you play the Em chord, then pluck the bottom (A) string on fret 2, then release and play the A string open (so 0), then you pluck just the third fret of the E string (that 3), then the fourth fret of the C string, and so on.  Hopefully that wasn't too confusing."

ukulele,3da40f,OminousOrganMusic,5,Tue Jul 14 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"I think you are mis describing something here...   A cutaway has nothing at all to do with a pre-amp - a cutaway is a piece taken out of a normal body shape on the upper bout at the based of the neck to allow fingers easier access to frets They make little discernible difference that I have heard See my opening statement   I think you are talking about on board pre-amps that are set in the upper side of the instrument? If so - I don't like them at all - but I DO like pickups. I use passive pickups that sit under the saddle, run to a jack socket on the base and avoid any other gizmos. They do however need the pre-amp off the uke - in a pedal or belt clip.  It's the choice most pros go with on stage as they sound so much cleaner than most onboard systems.  Of course for recording though you can't beat a mic. I use both. Mic for recording at home. Pickup for when a mic on stage is impractical.  Either way though - they are not 'cutaways' and i'm not really sure why you referred to them that way?"
ukulele,3da40f,bazmaz,5,Tue Jul 14 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, for whatever reason, I kept seeing ""cutaway with pre-amp"" in conjunction like that and was under the impression that they went hand in hand.

ukulele,3d9sru,MaNurse,4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"Like many things, I think that 90% of the answer is: Keep practicing until it sounds better. But beyond that, there are some helpful YouTube videos on ""the chuck"" (or palm mute). Personally, I first learned to palm mute on guitar with a pick, so the ukulele version still feels kind of awkward to me.  Also, unless you have some other musical background, that song seems pretty darn tricky for a 2-week novice. So if you're having a hard time, don't be discouraged. Maybe you're just not ready for that song yet.  P.S. I skimmed the video, and I still have no idea what you mean by 1-2-3-456 pattern."

The technique between soprano and baritone is the same just the baritone is lower so my soprano isn't voiced correctly for us to play together with the same shapes.  So I can play on my soprano to help show him a technique but if we play along together I would have to swap to guitar so it sounds right and the chords look similar.  If I just transposed it like normal I'd then be playing different looking shapes which might get confusing.  I have brought this up with the student via email and they seem okay with it.  If it doesn't go well I will happily help him find a different instructor.
ukulele,3d6rgx,Nicoule,2,Tue Jul 14 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"You asked if we thought it was a big deal. I think it kind of is, that's all."
ukulele,3d6rgx,Nicoule,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:24:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, and I accept that.  Just wanted to make sure I was being clear.  I do think it's a bit of a deal otherwise I wouldn't have brought it up.  However since I've been honest with the student and I believe I can help him with his goals I probably will at least give it a shot.    I'll probably keep payments for lessons for a month and if it seems like I'm being confusing and causing issues I'll help him find an instructor and give him his money back to pay for the first month.  I really do think I can help this guy learn to play but I don't want to take advantage either."
ukulele,3d6rgx,carriep63,2,Tue Jul 14 07:46:04 2015 UTC,"I don't own a baritone, but iirc, baritone ukuleles are the bottom four strings on a guitar, same tuning. So you should be able to use your guitar to teach him just fine."
ukulele,3d6rgx,MyLittleFedora,0,Tue Jul 14 00:21:15 2015 UTC,Top four strings(in pitch not location) and I know it's not a huge thing just hoping it won't be confusing for a complete beginner.

Over twenty years of experience and he was still dead on impact. It'll never happen to you, until it does. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying."

The bicycle is most stable at higher speeds. Biking handless at low speeds is much harder. Riding a sit-up-and-beg style bicycle. Because your weight is distributed almost entirely on your legs and/or butt, this style of bicycle makes it very easy to play with taking your hands off the handlebars just slightly. The specific geometry / set up of the bicycle can effect how easy it is to ride no handed, as well."

ukulele,3d2j8o,JanneJM,2,Mon Jul 13 00:43:53 2015 UTC,"Mostly that simple, apparently. There are some chords that you can't play ""right"" on an ukulele since they need more than four simultaneous notes, so you need to substitute with a simpler one. And some chords that are reasonably easy on a guitar can be difficult on an ukulele."
ukulele,3d2j8o,Philcoman,2,Mon Jul 13 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. A ""C"" is a ""C."""
ukulele,3d2j8o,dirkdice,3,Mon Jul 13 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but you will need to convert them to play in the same key as the original song.  If you go with guitar chords you already know, then you'll be in another key (a fifth lower or a fourth higher). If you're playing by yourself or with other musicians that can adapt, then go for it.  But if you want to play in the same key as the original, you have to shift the chords.  To play a C chord, you'll have to play what looks like a G chord. To play a G, you'll have to play what looks like an D. Etc. Ukulele chords are like playing a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret and ignoring the lowest two strings.  I hope that helps."

ukulele,3d2j8o,sfs14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:24:22 2015 UTC,"So the strings on the ukulele normally go G-C-E-A, with the G being a higher than the C. The corresponding identical point for the guitar is the bottom three strings on the guitar at the fifth fret. So open Ukulele tuning is the fifth fret for the bottom three strings on the guitar. I hope I explained this ok in my condition.  Rock on mang."

You actually do not need to be incredibly experienced to be an instructor if you are not intent on teaching in a classical manner. Really your experience should be in fostering the interest in the instrument and creating a comfortable space for a totally new player to experiment with unobtrusive guidance.   I have been teaching as long as I've been playing, six years. I taught as an example for Google Helpouts as well as plenty of individual lessons and guided jams. You can't force people to learn, but you can take a fleeting interest and turn it into a lifelong passion."

ukulele,3ctyen,cuddly_cuttlefish,2,Fri Jul 10 19:23:46 2015 UTC,Depends on the type of tuner.   If it is a geared one - difficult - probably needs replacing. Many people think that screws (if they exist) on the peg adjust things - they don't - but I would still make sure that is tight.   If it is a friction peg - tighten it  If it is either - sometimes the collar on the front face of the tuner can rattle (the small metal ring that goes around the post - they can be secured with a TINY drop of super glue.
ukulele,3ctyen,bazmaz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"Darn, I've been putting up with this for a while too. I have a geared one and I've tried tightening the screws already. :/   Do you happen to have any idea for how difficult replacing one is or the price range for getting it done?"
ukulele,3ctyen,arlodu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"If geared, the screw isn't causing it.  Difficulty - if you can use a screwdriver - really easy - just need to buy a pack of 4 of them to make them match really.  Depending on quality you can get those on eBay for as little as $10 per pack.  New tuners may need new screw holes to the old ones - but again - not a big deal."

Even simple things like turning a screw can be the result of a bigger issue, or can cause other issue if not done by someone who knows what they are doing. And not to offend anyone who DOES know what they are doing, but sites like youtube and eHow are just the worst.

My advice is to use less strength when playing the notes that support the melody so that a) the melody stands out more and b) the supporting notes act more as a chordal drone than a distracting, repetitive harmony."

ukulele,3cpq0o,RockClass101,9,Thu Jul 9 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting but difficult instruments to compare. Especially when trying to analyze the value of more expensive instruments. For one they are different woods which will make a huge tonal difference. The fact that one is a soprano and one is a concert also makes a massive difference when trying to compare the sound. These two factors will play more into the different sounds both instruments make than any price could ever play.   If you were truly looking to understand the value price has on an instrument, a more apt comparison would be a $50 concert koa uke vs a $1000 concert koa uke. And even then you'd need to hear it in person to really understand the difference.   This video is a great idea but, at the end of it, doesn't really inform on sound vs price value, in my opinion."

If there is buzzing that stops when you touch there, it's almost certainly not buzzing caused by the string - as that part of the string is isolated by the nut."

ukulele,3cmtij,cuddly_cuttlefish,7,Thu Jul 9 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"Here is an fairly easy beatles song, Here Comes the Sun that is probably a good starting point. I always find fingerstyle a little more fun when I'm writing it myself so start by trying to get your standard scales down as well as your different version of chords up and down the fretboard which should help you to start to understand the individual notes on the fretboard as well. Otherwise you might also want to pick up a book or two for exercises such as ""Mel Bay learn to play fingerstyle solos"". In terms of songs to learn it's all down to your own taste, just go searching for something that will keep you interested. If you can't find something you can always try and create your own fingerstyle.   Here are a few of the one's I started with:  Bach's Fur Elise. A really easy piece to start with.  This is a little video tutorial of Eric Clapton's Tears in heaven  I found really easy to follow when I first started playing   Mississippi Blues. A little harder than fur elise but around the same level of the Clapton song. It's also a good little intro into blues.  Jake shimabukuro's my uke gently weeps. This one looks a little more daunting but, honestly, it's put together in a way that plays very fluidly and makes sense. A good challenge if you're looking to push yourself past that beginner stage and if you want to learn something that will be recognizable and fairly impressive."

ukulele,3chwv5,lordmat0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"So. I had to go grab my banjouke to figure out how I go about it, as I frequently walk around the house while playing without problem, but have never really thought about it. And I noticed I wedge the body of the use against my gut with the back of my forearm. I also tried out that change you were talking about, and on the A7, I rest the uke on my knuckle joint on the pointer, and then pinch the neck between my thumb and pointer on the D7 with only a little weight on the thumb. But between the slight beer gut I keep around, and the back of my forearm, there is very little weight in the neck area, in fact I can support the whole weight of the uke.  Just play with it more, it's very much a different instrument than ukulele, and people often don't realize it. But it's definitely worth the time you put into it. I'm so excited for you!"

ukulele,3ci9fo,ukelelise,7,Wed Jul 8 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"1) Sweet! There's a lot of stuff available on YouTube, good and bad. It's up to you to be able to distinguish one from the other, but check out the first four videos on this channel. These videos are made by some Hawaiian ukulele store owners on Oahu. Also check out the links on the sidebar, those are some great websites.   2) Happens to everyone starting out. You'll get better with more practice. If you're a first-time musician, you have to understand that playing a song perfectly requires muscle memory. You need to get practice to get better, it's that simple. 30 min each day is better than one 3-hour session every Saturday.   Also, if you've got the resources, you might want to take group or private lessons. Nothing gets you better quicker than having a private teacher, IMO. You can find these in most music stores and some host in their own homes (look on Yelp! or equivalent). Groups lessons average $20/hr and private varies depending on how good/famous your teacher is. Anywhere from $30/hr - some crazy dollar amount only classical prodigies and rock stars could justify."
ukulele,3ci9fo,Black_Mack_52,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:08:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll definitely check out that YouTube channel. And yeah, I didn't realize strumming would be so hard. Hopefully I'll get better!"
ukulele,3ci9fo,Practice4Me,2,Wed Jul 8 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"1) I play with a strap because it's much more comfortable for me.  It would probably be best to practice playing with the inside of the right elbow because then you'll know no matter what situation you're in, be it because your strap broke or you picked up someone else's ukulele while riding a unicycle. If you're going to practice you might as well practice right.        |    2) Correct strumming will come with time. Perhaps for now just practice strumming with your thumb and/or index finger. Try to keep them a little firm and with time you'll hit the strings just right. When I first started something that helped me strum a little better was by pretending I was holding a pick between my the aforementioned fingers. Maybe give that a shot.        |    3) I consider the ukulele an instrument with a very small learning curve which means you can do a lot within a short time however, it's also a very complex instrument so, although you can play your favorite songs within a week or two, there are always things about it that can challenge you as you try to improve. I started off strumming a few songs I enjoyed then I got slightly into a few simple fingerstyle melodies and learning basic techniques such as muting, chucking, etc. Eventually I started learning different chord progressions which brought me to chord families. Chord families was my first introduction to music theory. The little bit of music theory I learned directed me into simple blues tunes where I began to learn a few riffs and licks. From the licks and riffs I found myself interested in memorizing different scales which brought me into the extremely complex world of fingerstyle where I've tried to learm everything in greater depth in order to both create my own melodies and memorize others more effeciently. It's definitely a journey, take it gradually, buy a book or two to help you along the way. But most of all, enjoy it! Grt your friends interested, too. Having a few buddies who played the ukulele really boosted my desire to improve.        |      4) I have a new favorite every week. Keeps things fresh and interesting for me.        |    Happy learning! Here's are two of my favorite ukulele players showin off the potential of the ukulele:  Jake shimabukuro'a Bohemian Rhapsody Ted Talk  James Hill'a Billy Jean Cover"
ukulele,3ci9fo,nobo13,2,Wed Jul 8 08:41:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I like the ""pretending you have a pick"" method. And wow, that's awesome!"
ukulele,3ci9fo,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"1) On my thigh if I'm sitting, strap if I'm standing. I'm using a piece of string for that.  2) I normally hit the strings with my two middle fingers. I haven't really thought about this you know. I think I used to try to slide the top of my finger nail across the strings at the start.  3) Got it because I couldn't learnt the guitar (I have tiny hands) and have never really stopped since. Have even gone into building ukes.  4) favourites are Somewhere over the raindow/Wonderful world IZ, Can't help falling in Love 21 pilots version, Something Beatles, and any of the Steven Universe songs!

As an aspiring filmmaker, the days leading up were stressful as I tried to come up with ways of meeting people and getting my name out there. The night before the festival started I was pacing around the house trying to come up with ideas. My roommate at the time suggested we got out for some drinks and said that the idea would come to me.  After returning home, quite inebriated, I started playing around on my uke. The idea came to me. The next morning I went and bought several silver sharpies. I decided to have filmmakers and actors sign my uke while I served them drinks. By the end of the week I was known as the ""Ukulele Bartender"". I eventually got an acting gig a few months later because of it!"

ukulele,3cgpvc,Henriksdottir,3,Tue Jul 7 19:51:14 2015 UTC,Price isn't an issue? Really? Mya Moe - about $1800 for the spec I am looking at!  As for sizes - they all have their place - don't let anyone tell you that any one is 'better' than any other. It doesnt work like that - I play all scales and love them all dearly.  Assuming the $1800 price made you fall over on the floor.. perhaps start by looking at ukuleles by Pono - they build in all scales and for my wallet are about the best intermediate quality ukuleles around.
ukulele,3cgpvc,bazmaz,2,Tue Jul 7 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"Haha! I've asked for ukuleles on different forums in the past, but I've only been shown the cheap alternatives. I thought it was time to look at something else. Price is an issue, as it always is, it's just nice to know what's out there. $ 1800 def made me fall of my chair a little bit, but now I know!  I'm doing all this for myself, and I love my sorpano ukulele dearly. I just need something else so I can continue growing as a player.  Pono is more in my price range, and they look really nice. Thanks!  Do you have a fav brand or strings maybe?"
ukulele,3cgpvc,Practice4Me,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:56 2015 UTC,I'd check out the ukulele site. They usually have sound samples of the ukulele so you can hear what it is you are buying. Mya-moe is a good place to go to understand the different effect wood has on an instrument which will narrow your search down based on the sound type you want. Then you can go to a site like theukulelesite.com and find a uke for cheaper than mya-moe and know that they'll also do some setup work to make sure the ukulele sounds perfect. There is also a buying guide up at the top right hand corner of the subreddit that has a few good tips and reviews.

The lower density woods produce a bright sound whereas the high density woods produce a rich, fuller sound. The best way to choose one that's right for you is to go in and play it in person. Hopefully there are other shops in your area that have higher quality ukes!  As for strings, Aquila and D'Addario are probably the two most-liked, but just keep experimenting with different kinds until you find one that suits you. Too many variables here to say ""this brand is the best for everyone"". Doesn't quite work that way. I personally wanted a fuller sound so I switched to classical guitar strings."

Just mute the string with the palm and strum with the fingers to get that sound. You might have a little more motion in your hand than she does but with practice you'll be able to get it down without strunming much at all.

ukulele,3c9uj0,that_crazy_cat_lady,6,Mon Jul 6 05:54:05 2015 UTC,"Here's a tip. When you want to learn an instrument, all you need is an instrument that is 'good enough.' Buy it, and then forget what it's called or what it's made of. Learn chords, get the chords to your favorite song, and try to play along.  Don't worry about the brand, the wood, the construction... Instrument builders can worry about that, not instrument players. When reading internet forums, it might seem to an outsider that playing the guitar (or the uke) is all about knowing various brands, woods, construction styles... but that could not be more wrong."
ukulele,3c9uj0,wersdgweffsfwqewwfws,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"This.  Go to your local music store and tell the clerk what your price range is. Have him or her being by a few candidates and  play them for a while. Don't look at the price or the construction, just pay attention to the way that the instrument feels In your hands and listen to the way that it sounds. Buy the one that's the best fit.  I firmly believe that, at a certain point, buying an instrument should be an emotional decision. If you love what you've got, you'll play it more. If you play it more, you win. It's that simple."
ukulele,3c9uj0,zimmy42,5,Tue Jul 7 06:09:37 2015 UTC,"You won't get good Koa for less than $300. I'd say you need to at least double the budget.  Some people go for Acacia and claim that it's the same. It isn't.  To be honest though, Koa ukuleles are not the be all and end all. I personally prefer mahogany ukuleles as the warmth of mahogany (whilst not desired on many guitars) actually balances the brightness of the ukulele nicely."
ukulele,3c9uj0,bazmaz,3,Mon Jul 6 08:59:36 2015 UTC,"Re: your voice, sopranos and concerts (altos) are tuned the same, so which size of uke doesn't matter.

Fiddled around with it until I decided I really loved ukulele and really hated my uke going out of tune after two songs.  I use a Kala KA-FMT. She's a tenor. Love it to death and it was a great investment.   I had some website I used when I was learning, but I have no memory of what it was called.   Also that whole, ""it's emotional and should feel right"" is totally a thing. I played this uke like two years ago that felt so perfect I still think about it. I just didn't have the money for it at the time. But connection is big for an instrument."
ukulele,3c9uj0,refotsirk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:52:39 2015 UTC,"The type of ukulele (soprano concert, tenor, etc.) doesn't have anything to do with what range you sing in. They are all tuned the same, and if you are playing a song that doesn't fit your voice, then play that song in a different key.  One exception is the baritone ukulele, it is tuned the same as the top four strings of the guitar, while the other uses are tuned like the top four string of your guitar with the capo on the 5th fret.   The best place to start learning is really to get a teacher. That goes for guitar also. Baring that, get a book and join a forum. Post videos of your playing and ask for feedback. Ukulele underground is a good option. Here may be good as well, though you would have to see what the mods think of that type of post."
ukulele,3c7h5i,CaptMorgansHanogver,0,Sun Jul 5 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"So the sheet music is what they are playing on the keyboard to sound like the singing voices of the song, and the ukulele is just the normal background like you would find on uketabs?"
ukulele,3c7h5i,Practice4Me,3,Sun Jul 5 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"It's all about the melody and it's very doable on the ukulele. It's not necessarily singing voices even though melodies are often sung. Vocalists create the melody by moving through a number of notes while singing. In these cases the notes in the melody have just been hit by fingerpicking the uke, instead of sung, and your own memory of the song is what makes you feel like you're hearing voices.  It's one thing to know the chords and strum the right rhythm, it's quite another to create a clear melody. Take the ukulele player in this video for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSIwMskyerQ . He plays the right chords and strums the right rhythm but it's not until he starts fingerpicking the a-string that he starts playing the melody. Once the melody is clear, our brain recognizes the song and we fill in the lyrics from our own memory. Many fingerstylists play melodies instead of sing them (not that you can't do both)."
ukulele,3c7h5i,Practice4Me,2,Sun Jul 5 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"Ok so i think i understand now. The chord backup is just the background music, while the melody is what sounds like or reminds us of the lyrics to the song.

ukulele,3c4qtw,CaptMorgansHanogver,2,Sat Jul 4 19:43:19 2015 UTC,So I'm not an expert by any means but a number of the phoenix chord break downs seem to have Em as the only note in the intro. Listening to the song it does sound like the same note is being played. If you'd like to create a little sound variation without necessary changing notes you could play Em with and without the fourth string fourth fret which is just like playing Em with two B notes in the chordal structure rather than 2 G notes. Without breaking it down myself I'd probably apply the double B noted Em on the strum before the pause and plau the double G noted Em in the other strumming. So it be something like this:  2-2-2-2  3-3-3-3  4-4-4-4  0-0-0-4  Listening to the music I'd say repeat a quick tempo DUDU pause strumming patter three times and then do a DUD emphasizing the fourth string fourth fret before the pause as I noted before.  Just an idea. Hope it helps!

I'm equipped for visual work but not for sound recording, so I don't have the means to counteract the sound coming from robotic arm. Likewise my lens is a 35mm (non-zooming wide angle) so the sound is very close and I don't have a great mic to record with.  I recorded two tutorials today but the sound was very distracting.

ukulele,3bwo1v,wuttsreddit,6,Thu Jul 2 19:37:22 2015 UTC,Keep it simple and build up from there. Many beginners try to race ahead and get into the complicated stuff too quickly. Seriously - the best advice is just to stick to simple up down slow strums and getting your head around basic timing before worrying about anything else.
ukulele,3bwo1v,bazmaz,2,Thu Jul 2 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Start by only doing downstrokes with chords changes, then work your way into constant quarter notes, and work your way up from there. It takes practice before your hands can really excel independently on a uke"
ukulele,3bwo1v,IAMA_llAMA_AMA,3,Thu Jul 2 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"There are a few free applications you can download that can help you learn different strumming patterns and techniques as well as work with you on tempos. I used to use something called ""strumming partner"" on android but there are a few no matter what device you have. Look them up, good place to start. YouTube videos work pretty well, too, as someone else has mentioned. Patience is key, btw. Going to take some time to get down."

ukulele,3bwo1v,fernandizzel,3,Fri Jul 3 08:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting out and one thing that has helped me with strumming patterns is that a Youtube tutorial I watched broke the pattern down into two halves.  Instead of trying to immediately jump into an entire pattern, try breaking it down into parts. That definitely helps me."
ukulele,3bwo1v,megabytefisher,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Personally,  I say forget about trying to learn particular ""up down"" strumming patterns at this point. Save those for later. I started out by just strumming downward as I got used to a song. Then experiment with your own strumming patterns. It doesn't matter if it sounds bad, just mess around and try to get the feel for certain songs. Once you feel comfortable strumming in your own different styles, then try to emulate the strumming patterns people recommend for you.  If it helps, try just saying out loud and/or tapping the time signature before strumming. Then maybe say it while strumming.  E.g. ""One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,"" for common time or ""one two three one two three"" for a waltz.  Tl;dr just practice at your own pace. Maybe try techniques, maybe not. It doesn't matter if it sounds bad because it won't soon enough."
ukulele,3bwo1v,valzilla2000,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:17:23 2015 UTC,"Ive found that the pattern DDU UDU will work for almost any song. All you have to do is change the tempo to fit the song your playing. Some songs will switch chords after every cycle and some will stay on the same chord for a few cycles.   It can be tricky to get at first but it is totally reasonable for a beginner to pick up, and its a very helpful pattern to know!"

ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,3,Thu Jul 2 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"I think this just sold me on buying my next uke. I've had the Vorson in my Amazon wishlist for a few months now. What kind of things should I know about purchasing an electric uke in terms of amps, pedals, etc.?"
ukulele,3bvj3e,Captain_Fuck_Off,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there is anything uke-specific to consider if you're looking at this one or one like it. It's steel strings over single coil magnetic pickups, so you'd go about it with the same process you would a guitar and what you'd want out of that.  Like I said in another comment, it's single cool and unshielded, so be aware that distortion will likely give you some hum (or a LOT). You'll likely want to have it set up, so maybe try to have that included in your budget to counter that if you can. If you're just going to be playing at home, look up what practice amps people like, there's the danelectro one for around $20, fender has a neat looking little tweed amp for ~$50, on up to any of your full-on guitar amps. If you have a smartphone, lots of people like the iRIg setup, or just running into your computer. I have a sleeping baby at home, so I'm often known to just be playing through GarageBand and headphones.  Would love to hear about others eleuke setups out there!"

ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,2,Thu Jul 2 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"That's a great one. I've always loved Godin and the tech they bring to their instruments.  This is still a piezo-style pickup, yes? So you're still using nylon strings and getting a more traditional uke sound when running a clean signal. (Please correct me if I'm seeing that wrong)"
ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,2,Thu Jul 2 20:22:05 2015 UTC,Because it is feedback resistant - I ran this through distortion / wah / blues driver / reverb / delay etc - anything but traditional uke sound. Though of course it does that too.

ukulele,3bvj3e,matckama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:52 2015 UTC,"They are steel strings.  It's a tenor uke. (17"" or 432mm) It does come strung with all unwound strings for high-G tuning.  I do have some sample with the original strings, which I'll put when I finish the full review of the instrument.  I tend to prefer to play in low G tuning, and the strings it came with (as was expected) are not great, so I switched them out."
ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:29:53 2015 UTC,Looks like a tenor to me - and why would you think it's not in standard tenor tuning?  Define 'uke sound'. The ukulele is just a box with strings on it - what people do with it dictates the sound. And surely a situation where only certain styles are deemed acceptable is not a great place to be?
ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,2,Thu Jul 2 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"But, aside from all that - the simpler answer is really this.  The ukulele is just an instrument - how people tune it and play it is totally up to them. Same with many other instruments.   You are entitled not to 'dig' it, but just say so. Saying it is because it doesn't have a 'uke sound' made me react. I am yet to find the rule book that tells me what a 'uke sound' is. Is this a uke sound? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB3RbO7updc  Or this?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RylxBtEM0sI"
ukulele,3bvj3e,matckama,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, this is too good to resist. For the record (re the defensive comment) - I didn't post first.  I respect your well tutored ears totally. But I think you will find that it was tuned in standard tenor tuning and not a baritone  I asked you to define uke sound for a very simple reason - and that is that its an instrument with a long heritage. Rather like the guitar, the traditional sound it may have had when invented has long since been diluted. Some people still actually get aggrieved about that with guitars (i.e. people who think guitars should still be nylon strung and the electric guitar is the work of the devil). Really... its 2015. People can play (and tune) the ukulele however they like in my book.   Yes it IS just a box with strings on. So is guitar, so is violin and most stringed instruments. The body is often called the sound box because that is what it does. How it is tuned is irrelevant. In fact - whilst most of the world tunes the ukulele GCEA these days, it's arguable that was NOT the traditional tuning.  Yes, I am talking about style, but also taste, opinion, favour etc. In short - what people do with the instrument is their business. Whether they get a reaction that is good depends on the audience. But if audiences of music over the years only ever said 'no, that isn't traditional', then music would be a sad thing today I think."
ukulele,3bvj3e,bazmaz,2,Fri Jul 3 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"Well, actually, standard tuning on a tenor guitar is CGDA, DGBE is Chicago tuning.  My point is really that, people can tune their instruments how they damn well please.   I occasionally tune some of my ukuleles in open chord tunings. Does that stop them being a ukulele?"

ukulele,3bs5e3,teeny0019,4,Wed Jul 1 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"My aunt teaches a bunch of different instruments from piano and the guitar to tuba and the clarinet. For each she currently charges 30 for a half hour and 60 dollars for an hour. She owns her own music store, has gathered a bunch of clients over the years, and has a bunch of experience. She earns a living at that price range along with a few instrument sales, granted it's taken her a long time to get to where she's at. You  might want to charge a little less as you learn the ropes and aquire clients.   Edit: Also recommend getting a good text book to help structure your course, maybe print off a page from it to give them something to practice. I have the book titled ""Ukulele Aerobics"" which would probably compliment lessons really well. It's structure in 7 tiny lessons, one for each day of the week, and gets more and more advanced as you progress in weeks. Would be fairly easy to build a lesson with the book by exploring the topics in greater depth, making sure your student understands the principles, and then give them a weeks worth of lessons to practice. Even if you don't really want to use a book, it's layout is still worth studying. Could perhaps be used to customize your lessons to make it a bit more exciting for the student. Be exciting and they'll keep coming back. Either way, hope this helps, good luck and thanks for teaching! Such an import profession."

ukulele,3boecb,AJakeR,5,Tue Jun 30 21:02:27 2015 UTC,"I find they stretch faster the more I strum, so I play a song, retune. Play another song, retune. Repeat until they stay in tune. Leaving them doesn't let them stretch unless you tune up several times a day and leave it alone in between, but that's no fun. Usually it takes a day to get 90% there for me, and after a week they should have found their happy spot. Don't give up if they take a while to settle, though! That doesn't make them defective, just stretchy."

ukulele,3boecb,valzilla2000,2,Tue Jun 30 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"You should be good to go after restringing. No need to wait for it to stretch or anything.  It could take anywhere from a day to a week to stay in tune, and that depends on a lot of factors (strumming technique, how often you play, if you try to stretch the strings out, etc.)  I play a ton and don't really have patience, so what I do is tune the ukulele but tune it a little higher than normal to stretch the strings. Then I strum harder than usual on a song and then rinse and repeat. You could also try gently plucking at the strings to stretch them, but this scares me since I don't want to break the strings."
ukulele,3boecb,bazmaz,3,Wed Jul 1 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"The most sensible way to stop them going out of tune is to play them.   Please don't follow the advice below on pulling them away from the fingerboard. That can create flat spots in the strings that will both shorten their life AND create tuning issues.   Ah, the internet...."
ukulele,3boecb,Black_Mack_52,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:19:56 2015 UTC,"You can stretch the strings by pulling them away from the frets. While facing your uke, take a finger and pull the string towards you. Slide your finger up towards the nut and then down towards the bridge - back and forth, back and forth - stretching it out as much as you can. The string should heat up a little. I think it's much quicker than stretching the strings by just playing it. My uke used to go horribly out of tune every few hours until I learned to stretch the strings... now it doesn't change much!"
ukulele,3boecb,bazmaz,2,Tue Jun 30 22:13:47 2015 UTC,Would never recommend that unless you are looking to create flat spots in your strings.
ukulele,3boecb,Black_Mack_52,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:20:30 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate? I dunno what flat spots are.
ukulele,3boecb,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Thin parts of the strings where they have been pulled too much - they affect string life and intonation accuracy. Imagine pulling a piece of gum between your fingers - it gets longer and longer but also thinner and thinner. Same happens with strings, on a lesser scale of course, but enough to affect tuning. No string manufacturer would recommend stretching in that way."

ukulele,3bna1y,Clerping,4,Tue Jun 30 16:17:47 2015 UTC,I don't share that opinion but to each their own. There's no right answer to this.
ukulele,3bna1y,Kingful,3,Tue Jun 30 16:39:59 2015 UTC,Not really - depends on the tuner. I have some high end Grovers on one uke that have black buttons. They also cost more than many people are prepared to spend on actual ukuleles.  So... no.
ukulele,3bna1y,bazmaz,2,Tue Jun 30 18:37:33 2015 UTC,Are there other tuners that you think are more classy? Or are you against tuners in general? I'd be interested to see what a classy tuner would look like.
ukulele,3bna1y,MakotoEndo,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Not against all tuners, just think if you're spending £100+ on a ukulele then it wouldn't take much for the manufacturer to stretch for some nicer tuners. Pearl, chrome or amber for example. An example from my ukuleles, these as opposed to these.  And from a ukulele i covet:  http://www.kalabrand.com/Models/Kala/SolidSpruceTopFlameMaple/UNIT-KA-FMC.jpg  I just think the aesthetics of it would be greatly improved with some nicer tuners."
ukulele,3bna1y,MakotoEndo,2,Tue Jun 30 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Oooohhhhh, I misunderstood. You're talking about Machine Heads, I thought you were talking about clip-on tuners.   I guess I agree that they look cheap? Iunno, I care way more about the sound and feel. It wouldn't be a deal breaker, but if it were between two otherwise identical ukes, I'd probably favor pearl."
ukulele,3bna1y,bazmaz,3,Tue Jun 30 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should've been more clear."
ukulele,3bna1y,herooftime94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:28 2015 UTC,I think that ukulele could be far improved. I think this gets to the nub of it - you are not actually listing a high end classy ukulele there. I have seen Kamakas with black tuners - would hardly say they have ruined them..
ukulele,3bna1y,herooftime94,2,Tue Jun 30 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"OP, people are confused because you did not make clear whether you are talking about these tuners (also called tuning pegs) or a digital tuner."
ukulele,3bna1y,bnolsen,3,Tue Jun 30 18:20:40 2015 UTC,I see that now. I was reluctant to refer to them as tuning pegs as I always thought the pegs refer to the metal post the string is wrapped around and if i'm honest I didn't think people would assume I had some irrational dislike for a black clip on tuner! My mistake.
ukulele,3bna1y,astropapi1,2,Tue Jun 30 18:25:14 2015 UTC,Jumping on something that people hate and telling them why they're wrong? Well that's just reddit's favorite past time.

ukulele,3bna1y,Airazz,2,Tue Jun 30 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. They just look... cheap. I guess it's the plastic for some reason.  I usually replace old machine heads with ones like these. They're for electric guitars, but they look nice and work fine on Ukuleles and all kinds of stringed instruments."
ukulele,3bna1y,TheMightyShrub,2,Wed Jul 1 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Huh? What do you prefer, a nasty plastic tuner or a nasty out-of-tune sound?"
ukulele,3bna1y,wersdgweffsfwqewwfws,2,Tue Jun 30 16:43:41 2015 UTC,So the only option is black plastic tuners or none at all? Or is there some tune holding property of black plastic that I am unaware of?   This seems an odd thing to say??

ukulele,3bixud,i_am_hidden_away,3,Mon Jun 29 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest - I keep seeing questions like this. The electro tenors you see on shelves that come with a pickup fitted are just a very small selection and not the way I recommend to go. You can get a pickup fitted to most tenors for about £50 at good ukulele stores like SUS and Omega - that way you pick whatever tenor you like and make it an electro - the pickups will be far better quality than anything that comes pre-packaged at that price.  And what that highlights is that for £200 on a pre packaged model you are not getting a £200 quality acoustic instrument.  As such, if we work backwards, you might get a laminate from Islander and some entry Kala models for £150 or less - fit a pickup and you get to £200!  Speak to Southern Ukulele Store about your options. I am assuming you are in the UK."
ukulele,3bixud,bazmaz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"The thing with most 'electric' ukuleles is that they use a bridge pickup and nylon strings. So you end up with something that sounds like an acoustic, more than an electric. Examples of this are the:   $99 Epiphone Les Paul Acoustic-Electric ~ (video) $136 Stagg EUK L-BK $253 Risa Electric Ukulele ~ (video)   They are good as, what people call them, silent instruments. Good for quiet practice, but you can plug them and they'll sound like an acoustic ukulele.  Now, if you want to rock out with an Ukulele and be taken seriously, you'll want a steel-string Uke with magnetic pickups. I mean, this custom one is just an example.  Magnetic pickups will give you an authentic electric guitar sound in a much more compact form. (god I sound like a bad salesman saying that).  The only model I've seen that is not custom and doesn't cost a lot (Damn you and your sexy ukuleles, Risa!) is the Vorson electric Uke line. They make three styles (each with different colour patterns you can choose):   $116 Vorson FSUK1BK  ~ (video) $108 Vorson FLPUK2BK ~ (video) $110 Vorson FTLUK3BK ~ (video)   You can also make your own if you're so inclined. ;)  So, ask yourself: What will I use this instrument for?  Most people buy instruments from the first list. And that is understandable; They just want to amplify the acoustif sound, but as I already said, if you're looking for a special instrument to take on stage and rock out with others, a magnetic pickup uke is what you're looking for. :)  Be sure to send me a message if you need more info!"

The size of a tenor, I find is perfect because you get a still very portable size while avoiding the sometimes plinky sound of the sopranos and the concerts.   I suggest going to a local music shop and testing out concerts and tenors in your price range. Whatever feels better is up to you :)   STRUM ON MY FRIEND!"

ukulele,3bi6l6,bnolsen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:27:36 2015 UTC,Of course! I was trying to explain how I think that tenors allow you to get pretty loud and still be quite portable. Sopranos win for portability any day.
ukulele,3bi6l6,TeeVex,2,Tue Jun 30 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"I would go with a concert. I started on soprano, and though fun, it's not very balanced. A good concert can be found pretty cheaply, nice full sound, small and portable. For me personally, it's my favorite.   Tenors are great to, and if you find yourself a good deal on a tenor don't hesitate. Also, since you're new to uke, BUY USED! If you don't like it, sell it for what you bought. I just picked up a little travel uke from a seller on there who was great. And, save yourself some money, or get into a nicer instrument.  Also, don't try and skimp. There is a massive improvement in build quality after the $80 mark, and an even bigger one at the $160 mark. I really can stress staying away from something super cheap."

ukulele,3beuyz,I_hate_captchas1,6,Sun Jun 28 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Binding is the strip of wood that is furthest outside bordering the top and back of an ukulele. Purfling is the second inner layer of wood strip(s) which usually have a patern of some sort, or are just colored strips. (There is also abalone shell purfling which is pretty common to find on ukuleles) Laminated means that it is thin plywood with a veneer of whatever wood it happens to be on the top layer. There's no in between. Unless they say ""solid ____"" it is most likely a laminate. All ukuleles have nylon strings; Aquila is a specific brand of nylon strings.  Pineapples have a slightly different sound due to the body shape; what that difference is is up to the individual listener, but I usually hear them described as mellow. I think I've heard of Anuenue, I think they're low end ukes? Just go out and try as many ukes as you can, and buy the one that sounds and plays the best for you in your price range."
ukulele,3beuyz,juliankoster,2,Sun Jun 28 19:25:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer!  From what I could google about aquila strings, they seem to be a mixture of nylon and gut strings, which is why it is called ""nylgut""."
ukulele,3beuyz,juliankoster,3,Sun Jun 28 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"They are nylon. They are called nylgut because they claim to be as close to gut as you can get in a synthetic material.   Aquila used to sell real gut soprano ukulele strings, but have since stopped (I believe). You can still find them if you really want to but they're much more expensive and don't last as long."
ukulele,3beuyz,juliankoster,2,Sun Jun 28 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"I see.  Could you tell me a bit more about binding and purfling? How does it affect the sound, if it does at all? Is it worth doing it?"
ukulele,3beuyz,slipperystar,3,Sun Jun 28 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"Both are decorative, but binding also partially serves as protection for the edge of the top/back.  That being said, they are sometimes left off of ukuleles and some of the most popular/notable ukuleles don't have any.  Sound will not be affected whether an ukulele has it or not."

ukulele,3besga,AJakeR,3,Sun Jun 28 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"You can bar the D if you want, put pinky on the 5th string.  For Bm, you can get away with barring the whole 2nd frets with index finger.  It's technically a Bm7, but sounds nice."
ukulele,3besga,slipperystar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"With practice, you can also bar the D but still keep the A string unmuted. (Or mute it but don't fret it, either works.)"

The index finger is on top, forming a little pyramid, that way I can get them to fit.  I have pretty thick fingers and can do this one easily on my littles sop.  Just takes practice."
ukulele,3besga,slipperystar,3,Mon Jun 29 08:43:10 2015 UTC,"Just a footnote: Lots of people are recommending using barres, which is absolutely correct. But barring is usually a struggle for new players as well. Bottom line: there are plenty of helpful tips, but no tricks. The chords will come with practice. You're only on your third day. The uke is easy relative to a lot of instruments, but it's not instantaneous and you'll be discovering things to do with it for years to come. Have patience and have fun!"
ukulele,3besga,Philcoman,2,Sun Jun 28 19:52:17 2015 UTC,Why is Bm a pain? i just bar the entire 2nd fret with my index finger and throw my ring finger up on the 4th fret on the G string. I agree with the D though. Just got to power through it until your muscle memory takes over.
ukulele,3besga,berserker13,2,Sun Jun 28 16:39:13 2015 UTC,"This isn't technically ""correct"", but I use my thumb for D. I can use the normal 3 finger method if I choose to, but I feel it's a lot easier like this.  There are also other chords which may be easier with using your thumb. I feel using my thumb is really useful for playing the E chord where I use the alternate position here : http://www.ukulele-chords.com/E/2  where I put my thumb on the 4th fret and index finger on the second fret. It's a lot easier than doing http://www.ukulele-chords.com/E  You could also try barring with your thumb for other chords. Some people may not approve of it, but I think if it works for you, it works. Eventually you'll be able to play it the normal way anyways if you keep playing the uke.  The downside of using the thumb is that switching between chords will be a bit slow, but if you're playing a slow strumming pattern, it's perfectly fine."
ukulele,3besga,I_hate_captchas1,2,Sun Jun 28 17:09:27 2015 UTC,i use my thumb for d also. it makes it a little trickier when switching to another chord.
ukulele,3besga,bigjerm,2,Mon Jun 29 15:32:45 2015 UTC,"You can do three fingers for D with a bit of practice. There is space. I do either that or bar the three strings with my ring finger (using just the last joint), depending on what comes next.  Bar chords in general take time to learn. Just take it slow, practice chord changes in slow-motion and make sure each chord actually sounds fully."
ukulele,3besga,JanneJM,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:35:14 2015 UTC,I just use two fingers for D chord.  Angle them down so you catch the C string with index finger (which is also on G string).  I bar Bm with index finger and roll it slightly towards the side of my finger.  It makes it easier to reach the G string with your ring finger.  I read somewhere that rolling your finger a little on its side helps with barring.  That helped me.  The side of my finger is harder (bonier) than the pad underneath.

ukulele,3b9ha8,rolltideamerica,3,Sat Jun 27 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"at this price its just a laminate.  likely only the outer layer is koa, the rest whatever is on their normal. ordering your first uke from amazon might not be the best since a uke at this price point will need a setup done to lower the action and fix intonation.  for a little more i would suggest an islander like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Islander-Ukulele-MC-4/dp/B00LY8HHLM  the soprano is cheaper but OOS.  baz likes ohana for low end but i'm not sure which low end model he might suggest."
ukulele,3b9ha8,bnolsen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:11:54 2015 UTC,I'm looking at a budget of around $100. Does the islander come in Koa? Does the Koa really have bearing on the tone? I like to think that a $50 one would probably be shit so maybe a $100 one would at least be decent. I really only intend to buy one uke and keep it for life so want one that's at least decent that I don't have to spend actual money on and just use my Amazon gift card money.
ukulele,3b9ha8,bnolsen,3,Sat Jun 27 04:24:00 2015 UTC,"its koa laminate.  not solid koa.  the difference is a huge chasm. spending 100usd on a uke gets you a decent beginner uke, nothing more.  That actually might be sufficient though.  the islander is also laminate.  at your budget everything is laminate.  this is the lowest of the high end ukes you can get (to put things into perspective): http://www.theukulelesite.com/koaloha-opio-soprano-ukulele-package.html  spending 100usd on a new 6 string guitar will get you a piece of barely playable garbage.  just keep that in mind."
ukulele,3b9ha8,bazmaz,2,Sat Jun 27 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"So If Koa laminate is purely cosmetic, then it's not a bad thing I'm my range. If you see the other suggestions in this thread, do you see any that are solid mahogany? Cuz the links don't say. Honestly, I might be making a mountain out of a molehill here as far as solid wood constructs go. My first guitar was a jasmine takamine, which is just a laminate beginner guitar but when I slap some elixirs on that baby it sings like fuckin Pagliacci, as far as I can tell. A laminate uke can be a lifer if I want it to right? I don't plan on selling out arenas with this thing but I'd prefer a reputable maker."
ukulele,3b9ha8,BermudaRhombus2,3,Sat Jun 27 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"You will struggle to get a solid wood uke for $100 (and if you do, it will probably be pretty lame).  Don't be put off my laminates - I would rather a well made laminate over a badly made solid wood uke any day of the week.  For me, go with the Kala - they are decent enough. Lanikai can have some setup issues."
ukulele,3b9ha8,bazmaz,3,Sat Jun 27 09:21:45 2015 UTC,"Buy a Lanikai Lu-22. They're really cheap, built really well, and sound great for the price. I don't think you can get a better uke for $100ish."

ukulele,3b9ha8,AleFairy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:20:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say a lot. It's easily the best $100 uke I've played or heard.
ukulele,3b9ha8,rniscior,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"I would - played it and lots of others. It used to be right up there at that money. In the last couple of years the number of models have increased dramatically. For me, easily beaten by the likes of instruments from makers like Alic / Mahilele, Snail, Baton Rouge, Pukanala, Riptide etc"
ukulele,3b9ha8,rniscior,3,Sat Jun 27 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Feel free to disregard this if you feel it is not relevant to your search- it's just what I have to offer:  The two ukuleles I hear most about in the $100  budget are (for sopranos) the Lanikai LU-21S and the Kala KA-S.   Both have good reviews and have concert, tenor, and baritone uke equivalents.  I don't think either are laminate (which is not necessarily good or bad!)  Apparently the Lanikai one has a ""newer version"" called the LUTU-21S for a bit more money, but still within that budget.  I don't know anything about the difference.  The TU in LUTU stands for TunaUke, it looks like that's the only difference and they claim it drastically improves intonation using a ""compensated"" nut and saddle system.  This brings it up about $100.  Could be gimmicky, could be genius, but I have not tried a uke with that.  I own a Kala KA-B (the baritone equivalent of the KA-S), and I can confirm that it is a quality instrument.  I would assume all the KA ukuleles are built the same way.  It's not professional-grade, but absolutely more than sufficient for a beginner, and I'm probably going to rock mine til the day it falls apart because there's nothing about it that bothers me.  I do wish it had a cutaway, but then that's a very different price range..  I have a friend with a Lanikai concert ukulele.  It also seems like a sturdy build, and it felt nice to play when I tried it.  Both of us have owned these ukes for a year without any problems.  PS as long as you find something that will stay in tune and not somehow have a particularly bad sound, the strings you choose will be the most important factor in your sound.  I recommend not buying the same strings twice until you've tried three or four different sets.  Definitely at least try both nylon/Nylgut and fluorocarbon strings.  Edit:  I just read more of the comments and saw you're a guitarist, so it looks like you know all about strings.  Though the fluorocarbons might still be a new twist.  Also, in terms of longevity, I don't know if I would expect a $100 uke to last for life.  A YouTube musician recently told me she buys a new KA-B (~$130) every few years because they eventually fall apart (but she does use them heavily.)  And on the other hand, she does keep coming back to that one.  But keep in mind that a laminate body might be sturdier.  Final thought:  I know this isn't my place, but a wise redditor whose username evades me once said, ""If this is the last _______ you're ever going to buy, and you're going to have it for the rest of your life, it's worth getting a decent one."""

ukulele,3b5090,1EaredFella,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:47:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, well theukulelesite.com sells a variety of pretty good ukuleles. I'm not much of an expert but if she is into finger style then perhaps get her a nice rosewood bottom spruce top for the brighter sounds. If she likes warmer strumming friendly tones then I would say a Koa or mohagany might be pretty good to go with.  I like the ukulele site because they fix the action, lower it and make sure it doesn't ring in the wrong way. They also have other accessories for the uke such as pick ups or tuners, etc. Not to mention they have a bunch of videos where their little experts play the uke so you can hear the sound before you buy. It will, however, take a few weeks to come. You can always buy local too and some music stores will also lower the action, install pick-ups, etc.   Just remember wherever you buy, if she's playing in gigs she'll need a pick-up and certain wood might match her style depending on if she prefers to play warmer or brighter sounds. I'll update this with a link to the wood spectrum in a moment. This is really nice of you to do and from one avid uke player to the next, I know she'll appreciate it.   Also, strings matter too but she can get those and she'll likely know better about it. The music store or ukulele site might have a decent string recommendation for the instrument, though. Hope this helped!  Wood spectrum link"

ukulele,3b5snr,wtf1sh,4,Fri Jun 26 05:08:00 2015 UTC,Tuning up is always going to increase the tension. Sometimes it will break the string if you tune it up but some strings are built for different keys. I'd say most are built for the key of C.  You might have concert strings on your soprano which would make the tension a little better in the key of D.  Southcoastukes has a diagram that kind of explains string tension versus uke sizes if you want to take a look at their site. Here is the link.
ukulele,3b5snr,Practice4Me,2,Fri Jun 26 06:06:55 2015 UTC,Depends how far you are going to tune up. Moving from C tuning to D tuning though isn't going to cause an issue - just don't go much higher.

Looking at some of the rest, it looks like it's mostly just a down strum until certain points in which he does DUDU. Best I can say without trying to work the song. Might do that later."

ukulele,3azimp,Trtlman,8,Wed Jun 24 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"If you're Uke is standard tuned (GCEA), then you're already tuned to C and won't have to transpose anything."
ukulele,3azimp,Yoshikirb,3,Wed Jun 24 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Then why are the chords so difficult? Is there any way I can change them to easy chords? Chords like G7sus, A#dim7, Gm6, Fsus2, Abmaj7, Bbm7, F7, etc. I am used to basic easy to finger chords. Those are in here but a good portion are these advanced chords."
ukulele,3azimp,juiceboxheero,4,Wed Jun 24 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"While these chords are prettier and true to the actualy melody of the song, a lot of times you can get away with playing just the root of the chord. Instead of F7 or Fsus2 play an F, Gm6 play Gm. If you are singing the melody it should sound fine and be a lot simplier. That being said while some Disney songs are pretty easy (learn Kiss the Girl, three chords and people love it) other ones can be pretty complex with their chords as that is the nature of the song (A whole new world or Beauty and the Beast comes to mind.) Since you are new find the songs that primarily use G,C,D and F which is a good portion of Disney Music, then move on to the trickier songs."
ukulele,3azimp,refotsirk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"Oddly I have Under the Sea I printed from online and it starts C, G7, C and has mostly these chords and some other simple chords but the book version is F7, Bb, F7 which is very difficult. Is the onei have printed not in C? I figured it was but I am far from an expert."
ukulele,3azimp,juiceboxheero,2,Wed Jun 24 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"A ""C"" instrument doesn't mean it is played in the key of C. It man's when you play a C position, a C note is sounded. The distinction is for other instruments that are not in c. For them, when you play what should be C, a different note comes out. You can read about it in Wikipedia, but generally speaking, everything is written for C instrument to unless it states otherwise.  You can still play in any key."
ukulele,3azimp,bazmaz,2,Mon Jun 29 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"The second version sounds like it is in the key of B flat.  The one that is C G7(just play a G if you want, it will still sound fine) is the one that is key of C. I'm surprised that a Fake book is listing songs outside of the key of C. If you search around on google you can find free programs that will transpose a song up or down until it is the key you want, and the key you want is one for 80% of Disney songs will have C, D, G and F chords."
ukulele,3azimp,Yoshikirb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:07:14 2015 UTC,I have a chord wheel but have no idea how to use it especially wince it lacks most chords and I don't anything about chord families. I will try to find a transposing program. And a lot of the fakebook songs appear to not be C.
ukulele,3azimp,bazmaz,2,Wed Jun 24 20:13:59 2015 UTC,I think you are over complicating things. - max number of notes you can put in a ukulele chord is 4 (for obvious reasons) so as such there are some chords you can never make. you can however get close enough as any four string instrument can get.
ukulele,3azimp,slipperystar,0,Wed Jun 24 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"That is why I said I would just play the base chord, as was suggested to me twice."
ukulele,3azimp,bazmaz,2,Thu Jun 25 03:53:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, one thing you have to keep in mind is that the music was written for piano. They didn't intend for it to be written for ukulele, and they weren't trying to write chords to make it easy for ukulele. If you want to make it easier, you could try to break down those chords into pieces of a chord and try to play those note sin a different way... but it'll take a certain comfort and practice with some music theory to do that. I would say to follow what juicebox said and either play the root of the chord or find another version of it online that someone made simpler"
ukulele,3azimp,refotsirk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"I will use the root notes but I think eventually would like to learn these chords anyhow just so I know more chords. Thanks, the both of you, for your help."
ukulele,3azimp,laserwash2000,2,Wed Jun 24 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"On a ukulele you have 4 strings - you cannot play all these chords. The point is, with four strings, you don't need to."
ukulele,3azimp,Philcoman,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:39 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true.  You can't play the complete chord, but for most more complicated chords you can find 4 notes that satisfy the tone of the chord.  Listen to some jazz ukulele and you can hear very rich chords.  I know what you are saying, but just want to clarify that chords can actually be played to a nice level of complexity on the ukulele."
ukulele,3azimp,refotsirk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yes agreed - certainly not saying you can't have complexity. I suppose the point is that you can (technically) play ten notes at once on a piano, on a ukulele you can only make 4. Still chords though"

ukulele,3azwk0,bazmaz,2,Thu Jun 25 08:09:33 2015 UTC,Yes that recipe works for me and is used by several luthiers. But - bear in mind those are the tensions for the particular line I reviewed in the post (Seaguar Blue Label fluorocarbon). They were actually chosen by matching the diameters of the lines against Worth strings and those are the breaking strengths that came out. However- not saying those breaking strengths work for ALL fishing lines. You need to check the line gauges against something like this Worth string chart to be safe  http://worthc.to/english/w_strings.html
ukulele,3azwk0,astropapi1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:49:20 2015 UTC,And I would also add - stick with 100% pure fluorocarbon. Some fishing lines have multiple cores and coatings. Not what you need for clear tone
ukulele,3az6rb,Jellysquidfish,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"In the neck - all depends on where it is. If it not in a place that takes a lot of tension - titebond in the crack and a g clamp on it for a few days, If in a tension point probably better to put a dowel joint in it.  If you don't want to invest - does that mean the uke was cheap? If so, the cost of the uke may rule out the cost of a repair. If it does need professional care - you can get a price from a  luthier and weigh it up against the price of the uke.  I fixed a snapped wooden neck (half way down) on a Flea Banjolele and used wood glue and g clamp - worked perfectly, but looked messy. But I got the uke dirt cheap and wasn't going to spend luthier money on a neat fix - just wanted to get it working."
ukulele,3az6rb,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"This was a good quality ukulele, spent 150 on it and it's about a year old. I'll probably take it in and see of they can tell me what exactly to do, but it's not exactly causing problems.   I'm just afraid that through playing it, the crack might expand and actually cause trouble (it starts behind the neck and creeps towards the 1st fret).   So thanks for your pointers. It might actually be worth it to spend money on this."
ukulele,3az6rb,bazmaz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:15:11 2015 UTC,Not just playing it will cause trouble. My advice would be to take the strings off it immediately - any tension on the neck is only going to make it worse

I suppose when you get used to it you can then do down up am am chunk chunk am am chunk chunk, nice and even.  You have to get used to moving between the two.  Once you are comfortable with that you can look up patterns on youtube, it's all about the syncopation.  Don't fret over it though (no pun intended).  Play around with it, add it to your practice routine as something you work on for 5 minutes or so a day.  Eventually it will click.  I found it challenging at first, now it's quite second nature, all kinds of weird patterns.  I like chunking when I'm playing around in 7/8 time."

ukulele,3aq74h,ukenut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience having longer nails on atleast the thumb and first finger makes a big difference in the sound of your playing, not just picking but also general strumming. I personally much prefer using nails, and I wouldn't bother even attempting it with a pick (buy if you do, make sure it's felt so not to damage your uke due to the absence of a scratch plate!)."

And Soko does simple really well.  In my opinion, if you are going to sing the same notes you play, you have to sing the notes you play, not a half step below them. Rivers Cuomo from Weezer and Michael Jackson are both performers who are good at doing that.  The girl in this video is ok.  The guy makes it much worse.

He asked us what we thought.  My criticisms are accurate and valid.  They are all talented individuals, but the don't mesh just yet.  What they are putting out is very much amateurish and not criticising a poor performance, when they specifically ask for our opinion, is dishonest and isn't doing them any favors.  I don't want to live in a world where mediocrity, or even poor performance, is celebrated.  We should all strive to be our best and we should all be honest with each other.  We don't have to be mean about it.  I wasn't...you're the guy who's calling people names."

ukulele,3ao1s8,TrevorSmokesLetsGo1,2,Mon Jun 22 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"Hi and welcome!  We all started a tthe beginning, so you are just like us!    I'd go for a tenor, but that's up to you.   I have really been enjoying my soprano for some months now after a couple years of non stop playing on my Blackbird tenor.  The frets seemed tiny at first but after a few weeks I got used to them.  There are so many songs out there that you can play with just a few chords.  I would suggest thinking of songs you like to sing or listen to and find the chords on the net.  If it is only a few chords, then you can start learning it.  On ultimateguitar, you can easily transpose songs to another key.  So if the song has too many unknown chords then transpose up or down til you find a key that is easier for you.  Once you play longer and expand how many chords you know, or get into fretting, you won't have to do this as much.  I would say learn C, G, Am, F, A, D, Dm, and Em.  You can play a lot of songs with those chords!  Practice every day!  Work on strumming each chord 8 times and switching to another, back and forth.  Find an online metronome and use it to keep on time.  Most importantly have lots of fun.  Finding songs you want to learn really helps in that process.  Any song can be a ukulele song, don't think you are limited to Tiptoe Through the Tulips or The Lazy Song."
ukulele,3ao1s8,slipperystar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:02:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks a lot for the warm welcome. I think I'll probably get used to the small fretboard but then again it might end up being a problem for me. Of course, I doubt that it's impossible that someone with big hands cannot play a soprano. Nothing is impossible... Honestly, I think I'd enjoy carrying around a ukulele as small as a soprano or concert.  I've been listening to a lot of Twenty One Pilots lately, and I'm actually really interested in learning how to play House of Gold since it is played with an ukulele... Hoping one day I can play it with ease and perhaps even sing it. But like you said, any song can be played on an ukulele and I don't deny that. It's like how you could play a song that's played on piano on a guitar and vice versa. Still a song I look forward to learning and playing. Can't wait to just look at all the songs that I enjoy and want to learn that aren't even played with an ukulele.  I'll try to remember all that I can from when I used to take beginner guitar class. Really, it's just nice to know that I could just bring an ukulele around and play anywhere I want. Hell, I could even play it in the car (obviously not when I'm driving)!  Thanks a lot!"

I've had problems with the Lanikais not playing chords in tune even when all of the open strings are in tune, also the soprano started to cave in at the bridge less than a year after buying, which threw its tuning even more out of whack."

ukulele,3am76a,dinaaa,4,Sun Jun 21 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying. The uke was the first string instrument I played, and I started playing guitar more recently. After I got my ""guitar calluses"", I couldn't really feel much from the uke. But if you started off not playing stringed instruments, the uke will create calluses after enough playing, just not as thick as a guitar callus. Sort of a hierarchy of thickness:  No Callus < Uke Callus < Guitar Callus"

ukulele,3am76a,slipperystar,2,Sun Jun 21 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"If I'm lucky I get about two hours of playing in a day.  I definitely have calluses from the uke, not super thick like when I used to play guitar, but for sure they are there and you can see them (and feel them)."

ukulele,3aksdw,fernandizzel,6,Sun Jun 21 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with RedTabby that whatever works best for you is what you should consider ""right"". I strum primarily with my index finger and what's what I see players use most often. I could see having to use my thumb in addition on some complex rhythmic strumming and sometimes use it to strum when finger picking, but for straight-up strumming I find using the thumb to strum a bit awkward. I've also seen players use both - the index on the down stroke and the thumb on the up stroke, and vice versa. You do get a different sound depending on whether your strumming with your finger pad or nail. Experiment and do what feels and sounds best - and don't worry too much about learning in the wrong way as its not like you can't change it up down the road."

ukulele,3aksdw,RedTabby,2,Sun Jun 21 05:19:16 2015 UTC,I too strum down with my thumb and up with my index finger. I think that whatever works best for you really. Someone more experienced might have better insight than I but the thumb and index method seems to be working alright for me so far.
ukulele,3aksdw,trifelin,3,Sun Jun 21 04:44:02 2015 UTC,Alternating fingers kind of screws up my rhythm. So I guess I either need to learn to strum with alternating fingers or do better with thumb or index.
ukulele,3aksdw,Practice4Me,2,Sun Jun 21 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"It's a good thing to learn to alternate your fingers now if you want to play more complex to stuff down the line. I was actually taught that alternating thumb and index was a good way to play. I actually end up using my thumb and middle finger with my to finger right next to it, but it's actually sort of like my whole hand smacking the strings...so yeah whatever works!"
ukulele,3aksdw,bazmaz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely best to learn how to strum with a variety of different fingers for the potential varying rhythms such finger dexterity offers. Otherwise it just depends on the sounds you might want. I'm not an expert by any means but from what I gather strumming with the thumb creates a softer tune, almost slightly dragged, than that of the index finger. I've seen James Hill use thumb strumming specifically for a Jazz tune.   All  in all, it depends on the sound you think you'd prefer but, when it comes down to it, learning different strumming techniques can never be a bad thing. I wouldn't worry about it too much, it'll come with time. Just mix it up a bit when you're fooling around and learning other things."

ukulele,3aj18r,eliteorigin,8,Sat Jun 20 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest - asking that question is really just asking 'how do I compose music' and to be honest - a Reddit answer is really not going to help you with that.   Learn music, learn music theory, spend years working at it?"
ukulele,3aj18r,bazmaz,5,Sat Jun 20 20:31:06 2015 UTC,Well said.
ukulele,3aj18r,Ben_Doon,3,Sat Jun 20 22:21:37 2015 UTC,Certain chord progressions tend to sound happier than others. Look up the chords for a dozen or so of the songs you want to imitate and see if there are any common progressions.  Or you can do things properly and learn music theory.
ukulele,3aj18r,BagOfShenanigans,3,Sat Jun 20 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"So, I listened to a bunch of alumo's videos. Here are the progressions used:  I - vi - IV - V - I  I - V7/vi - vi - IV - I  I - V - IV - I  I - IV - I  ii - V - I  As you can see, only I, ii, IV, V, vi, and V7/vii are used. If you can learn those 6 chords in each key that you play in, that is a big step in the composing process. In fact, only the I, IV, vi, and V chords are really needed. You can play them in practically any order you want to get a song out of them. the V7/vi and ii are just flavor chords. Other flavor chords are bVI, bVII, and V7/ii.   Each video did one of two things: They picked a longer progression and repeated it for the entirety of the song, or they did a smaller progression repeated with other small progressions thrown in for contrast every once and a while.   From there, they just figured out a strum pattern, then threw in some hand claps, a piano line consisting of unison/octave notes, a bass that plays the root note of each chord, a drumset with a simple pattern that's not too busy, along with xylophone that usually mirrors the uke line. Other instruments you may hear in this type of music are pizzicato strings, cello, classical guitar, etc.   In terms of actual composition, it'd take some work to learn how to compose. You'd want to learn theory, so you know which notes to put in over which chords, along with rhythm, meter, and style.   I have a few guides over in the sidebar if you want to start learning theory."
ukulele,3ajl6b,biketothemoon,3,Sat Jun 20 20:50:09 2015 UTC,I would imagine the strings aren't stretched out. My lanikai did that when I bought new strings and I would have to tune them every day.
ukulele,3ajl6b,Reallykevin,2,Sun Jun 21 00:25:46 2015 UTC,How long have you owned it? How old were the strings?
ukulele,3ajl6b,Ben_Doon,2,Sat Jun 20 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"About two months. A friend gave it to me and said she had owned it for a while before that, and that the strings have not been changed."
ukulele,3ajl6b,ukenut,2,Sun Jun 21 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"When you say ""stay in tune"" do you mean that it can be tuned and sound right strumming chords, but then as you play it goes out of tune?   If so, that could be two things: 1) tuning pegs are slipping or 2) the strings haven't settled in - new strings take a while to stretch out and stay in tune.  If not - meaning you can tune the open strings properly using a tuner but then chords sound out of tune, that could be two separate issues: 1) old strings that need to be replaced will do this and the solution is to put on new strings or 2) the intonation is bad, which could just be a poor build on the instrument or something a guitar/ukulele tech might be able to fix for you."
ukulele,3ajl6b,ukenut,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'll tune it up and after a few minutes of play it slips out of tune. My friend suggested that rubbing rosin on the pegs then restringing it might help, so I'll try that."

ukulele,3agp4i,sclenny,2,Sat Jun 20 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"That reminds me. the front man/bass player of Primus, Les Claypool, basically does the same thing. I've heard that he just practices his super intricate basslines until he can do them in his sleep, which makes singing and playing easier."
ukulele,3agp4i,Ur_moms_a_hookr69,5,Sat Jun 20 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"One thing that I've noticed that helps me is to tap my foot to keep the rhythm. It seems counterintuitive that adding another movement would make it easier, but it helps me to sync all the parts up.  Also, practice the ukulele part and the singing part separately. You'll know both parts intimately, and then it becomes easier to put it all together."
ukulele,3agp4i,Yohfay,3,Sat Jun 20 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/hockeyhippie was saying, just sing gibberish until you get comfortable. Sing/hum/yodel? a familiar rhythm with a vague melody while you strum straight quarter or eighth notes and build from there! Naturally, I tend to have an easier time in meters of 3 (ie 6/8, 3/4, 9/8), so i learned to sing and play by practicing one of my favorite songs that had relatively easy chords. Best of luck!"
ukulele,3agp4i,TiggsMC,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:20:46 2015 UTC,"Adding on to /u/TiggsMC, I also try to ""sing"" (usually an ""oo"" or some other sound) the melody of the song I want to learn while playing it, and then move on to actually singing the real words."
ukulele,3agp4i,sclenny,3,Sat Jun 20 13:13:32 2015 UTC,"Basically what /u/hockeyhippie said. Just work your way up there, start with humming, then kinda mumbling it, until you can straight up sing it to its fully extent while playing as such too."
ukulele,3agp4i,ArthurCPickell,3,Sat Jun 20 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Record yourself playing the song. And then put some headphones in with that song playing and sing to it whilst recording yourself singing. Then mash up both audio files to speed and time with some software and you then have a perfect song! So whenever you practice singing and playing, play that song in the background. Makes it alot easier when both things are already going on."
ukulele,3agp4i,awyissmfbreadcrumb,2,Sat Jun 20 12:18:43 2015 UTC,Practice... That's how it was for me. Eventually it just kinda works out and you can do it on new songs and strum patterns right away.
ukulele,3agp4i,thetofuprincess,2,Sat Jun 20 06:11:28 2015 UTC,I play and sing really slow and then speed it up if that makes sense.
ukulele,3agp4i,taytay9955,2,Sat Jun 20 14:07:19 2015 UTC,Practice - it really is just that.  One thing that will complicate things is focusing on strum patterns (another reason I dislike them) - you need to get comfortable with the uke and you voice will follow.
ukulele,3agp4i,bazmaz,2,Sat Jun 20 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"just keep trying...it took me sooo long to get it. and now I can, but I can also only do one strumming pattern so now trying to get over THAT hurdle. :U but, um, for me it literally just ""clicked"" into place all of a sudden out of the blue. one advice I was given on here but never really took was practicing strumming patterns while doing some other sort of other task (netflix, etc) so you're more used to splitting your attention away from the strumming at least"
ukulele,3agp4i,erratastigmata,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:48:56 2015 UTC,I found that just regularly talking helped me to separate the rhythm of the uke from the rhythm of the vocals. The problem I always had with humming is that I would always just end up humming the beat from the uke so I just started talking instead.

Going on my to do list."

And I just bumped into Ken's version of Hard Times Come Again No More a few days ago, I must search his channel a bit more :) Looking forward to hearing your arrangement of Neil's song!"
ukulele,3aglwj,TommyRiot,3,Sat Jun 20 00:05:18 2015 UTC,Look for videos about restringing classical guitars. They use the same kind of bridge. It's not as tricky as it looks.
ukulele,3aglwj,Aikidelf,2,Sat Jun 20 02:12:00 2015 UTC,The classical bridges I've restrung all had one hall per string and these have two!  Although there is no reason that knot wouldn't work.
ukulele,3aglwj,person9,2,Sat Jun 20 08:12:02 2015 UTC,I googled around but couldn't find anything. Can I re-string it like a tie bar or no? Or could I just do the knot in the bottom thing? I don't want to screw up. I've only ever put strings on a guitar before and the first time I had to do that I had to buy more strings because I fail. Figured I should ask the Internet about this.
ukulele,3aglwj,freudianslipservice,3,Sat Jun 20 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"Had the same bridge on an Aria ukulele. You pass the string through the right side holes top to bottom, loop it back over the top of the bridge, and down through the left set of holes. The end tucks into the right loop so it tightens down on itself without a knot. When looking upside down, it follows the pattern of writing ""N."""
ukulele,3aglwj,bazmaz,2,Sat Jun 20 01:00:26 2015 UTC,You don't need to use both of the holes - just use one of them and string like a regular tie bar bridge if you prefer.
ukulele,3aglwj,Incognito_Whale,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"My Kala is like this, and it took me forever to figure it out. I can't explain it in words (I usually just show people) but it's not too bad once you figure it out. Good luck!"
ukulele,3aglwj,Giraffokeryx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:05:00 2015 UTC,I pass the string through one hole and then tie it like a regular bridge back through the other hole. This way the excess string is tucked away between the tie bar and the saddles.  Google Images has many pictures of how you're supposed to tie it but I found the strings slipped out that way.
ukulele,3af781,TeeVex,4,Fri Jun 19 17:12:56 2015 UTC,Personally I like C on the uke as you can run up and down the 1st string with that position and play lot's of variants and harmonics with one finger.
ukulele,3af781,bazmaz,2,Fri Jun 19 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"It's so great being able to do that. Even when all my fingers hurt, I can just sit there and do that, switching fingers."
ukulele,3af781,inform880,3,Fri Jun 19 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"You could try an alternate fingering: http://www.ukulele-chords.com/C  Edit: Also, transpose the key of songs with C in them?"
ukulele,3af781,rusemean,3,Fri Jun 19 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Alternate chords have little to do with the root, and all to do with the key the song is in.  Do you have a specific chord progression that uses a CMaj that you'd like to swap it out in?   Otherwise, check for different fingerings for different voicings, as /u/rusemean. Maybe you just don't like the stock Cmaj chord voicing."
ukulele,3af781,funkybassmannick,2,Fri Jun 19 18:21:42 2015 UTC,4322?
ukulele,3af781,bazmaz,4,Fri Jun 19 18:22:42 2015 UTC,You mean 5433?
ukulele,3af781,funkybassmannick,2,Fri Jun 19 19:02:07 2015 UTC,Just testing..
ukulele,3af781,bazmaz,2,Fri Jun 19 21:58:14 2015 UTC,C or CMaj7?
ukulele,3af781,MyLittleFedora,2,Fri Jun 19 21:42:52 2015 UTC,You could try tuning your uke to A D F# B. See if that works for you.
ukulele,3af781,bonesoup,2,Sat Jun 20 11:58:14 2015 UTC,"If your C sounds bad, it might be because there is something wrong with the bridge or neck and the frets are not exact to the scale length.  Play open C string and 3rd fret on your A string and if those notes are out of tune but all of your open strings are in tune then there could definitely be something wrong with your instrument.  This is very common on cheap ukes, so if your uke was less then $60, consider getting an upgrade."
ukulele,3af781,The_Slad,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"Something I like to do to give my C a different sound is instead of just the A string 3rd fret, its both the E and A strings 3rd fret. So it goes 0033!"
ukulele,3af781,thatdudethatyouknow,3,Sat Jun 20 02:43:39 2015 UTC,but then you're just playing CGc and there's no indication of whether it's major or minor without the third of the chord.
ukulele,3af781,The_Slad,2,Sat Jun 20 11:44:27 2015 UTC,"I know it gets rid of the third, but I was just suggesting it so he could play around with it."
ukulele,3af6tl,sick_as_frick,2,Fri Jun 19 17:10:09 2015 UTC,Depends entirely on what you want to do with it / how big a performance space you want to fill. Do you want to have a vocal channel? Do you need clean? Does it need to be portable? Does it need mains power / batteries.
ukulele,3af6tl,bazmaz,2,Fri Jun 19 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"Performance for a max of 100 people. No vocal channel. I do need a little bit of clean sometimes. No need for batteries. I was thinking Vox, or something like that."
ukulele,3af6tl,bazmaz,2,Fri Jun 19 20:35:18 2015 UTC,For that sort of crowd -if you want acoustic tone - a Marshall AS50 is superb. as is a Roland AC33.
ukulele,3af6tl,person9,2,Fri Jun 19 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"Ah...so a Roland JC-120 would probably be oversized then.  They're expensive new but can be found for around $300-500 used.  I play one with my acoustic guitar all the time and it's pretty neat.  Lots of high end and a great clean sound.  But really I would think any good clean amp would work.  Fender Princeton Chorus, most acoustic amps, hell a PA speaker and amp would probably work if you got a DI box at the end of your pedal run."

ukulele,3a7pju,Bobo1993,14,Wed Jun 17 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"So I went to another music shop and talked to a really friendly sales person who played the ukulele. I told him the advice you gave me, the brands I was looking at, and the price range I wanted to stay within.  He suggested the Lanikai 22, which is what I got. I really liked the tone and it sounded much nicer than the Makala Dolphin I was playing earlier. It was a little more than I originally planned to spend, but by only $20 or so, so I figured it was ok to get a better quality one for that difference.  Thanks so much for all the advice! I'll be posting questions soon when I start trying to learn!"
