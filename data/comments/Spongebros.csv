Spongebros,3dl5o0,Missplayer30,2,Fri Jul 17 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"If Dedede is Patrick and Jigglypuff is presumably Sandy, then who's SpongeBob and Squidward (and the rest of the cast)?"
Spongebros,3dl5o0,LuigiBrick,5,Fri Jul 17 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious. Spongebob is totally pacman. Small, yellow, full of energy, annoying, and on the good side. Spongebob is additionally often found pulverizing his friends with fire hydrants from above, so it just works out. Also, both characters have a bad TV show nowadays. Squidward is mr game and watch. Screaming that nobody cares to even think about deciphering in the midst of chaos (spongebob and patrick doing stupid shit), and also he is doing normal things like making pancakes, moving chairs, or flipping manholes. Final smash is an octopus. It's practically canon."
Spongebros,3dl5o0,LuigiBrick,5,Fri Jul 17 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"Jigglypuff totally works as Sandy because of the Hibernation sleeping thing, and she sung a song one time. She also kicks ass."
Spongebros,3dl5o0,Cheesygoodness1,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Totally. Although a REALLY good alternative would be Samus, because they're both smart, sciency, also kick ass, and let's not forget that she comes with and without a suit-- just like sandy. But I do think jigglypuff is ever so slightly more suitable.  also both have nice racks"
Spongebros,3dl5o0,Missplayer30,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Jigglypuff doesn't have a rack...right? Right?! Hold on...Yep. I found fan art of it. sigh God damn it, internet."

Spongebros,3djieb,Kingofgavs,12,Thu Jul 16 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, you were the poster of the ""'Miibos"" video. To my recollection, the first half of that video was unedited footage of the episode, ""Club Spongebob."" Due to the amount of unedited footage, the YouTube copyright bot had detected it as infringing on copyright laws, and had taken your video down. To avoid this, I recommend always having a visible edit to the footage at all time. This can go from flipping the video (which I believe can still get detected by the bot in some cases), or having something obstructing the footage in the form of a character face, etc (can be seen in many videos on this subreddit, you can use mine as reference)."
Spongebros,3djieb,BeshtheChef,4,Fri Jul 17 00:34:23 2015 UTC,Oh. That's interesting how that works. Thanks for the info!
Spongebros,3djieb,zazrmoo195,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:21:33 2015 UTC,edit it more if you don't edit it enough you show off more of the episode

Spongebros,3df4qa,millershappy,4,Thu Jul 16 03:14:26 2015 UTC,After all a lot of the non cartoon posts are from sitcoms
Spongebros,3df4qa,ireter294,12,Thu Jul 16 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"But... why? The type of joke being told is exactly the same in both scenarios, it's just that one has real people in it. What difference does it make?"

Spongebros,3df4qa,vagina_crust,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe IRL shows are allowed as a once-a-year event? Just throwing the idea out there.  Also, what if you drew a picture of a live-action show? Does that count as a cartoon?  These are very important distinctions, Smashers!  Also, one more thing. I think it'd be nice if there was a ""competitive"" and a ""casual"" flair, or some way of organizing the two. I see /r/spongebros stuff on my front page about Competitive Smashers, and not that I mind them, but I don't want them on my front page and there's no way to filter them. It's not a big deal, I just hide them, but I'd like some way to categorize them..."
Spongebros,3df4qa,robotortoise,11,Wed Jul 15 23:06:57 2015 UTC,A once-a-year event sounds like a bad idea. I'd rather see someone make an entirely new sub. I don't know what a clever name would be for it though.
Spongebros,3df4qa,robotortoise,4,Wed Jul 15 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends how much content there is. I suppose quite a bit, considering how many episodes of sitcoms like Scrubs, Seinfeld, HIMYM, IASIF and the like there are. I'm sure quite a few situations would correlate to Smash Bros.  Hm, name ideas, name ideas.... What about something like /r/Smashfield? Or /r/Thatssosmash? /r/HowIMetYourSmashBros? /r/ItsAlwaysSunnyInBattlefield? /r/Smashcrubs?  EDIT: /r/Smashcoms is good too"
Spongebros,3df4qa,robotortoise,5,Wed Jul 15 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"/r/smashcoms? Since, you know, it's intended to be focused on jokes using sitcoms in general as opposed to what this sub was when it started out (i.e. exclusively SpongeBob stuff)."
Spongebros,3df4qa,DaUrn,2,Wed Jul 15 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I like that name. Let's see if we can get the mods from /r/spongebros involved.  /u/LuLoSmash, /u/WumboMD, I choose you guys!"
Spongebros,3df4qa,LiquidTurtle1,4,Wed Jul 15 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"Why is it that you only want to see spongebob content on this sub? I get that this is a sub literally about SmashxSpongebob, but why do you only want to see spongebob?"
Spongebros,3df4qa,DaUrn,8,Thu Jul 16 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen every episode of SpongeBob, and I know a lot about smash, so I understand everything that's posted in this sub. If you expand the parameters to other shows, then I don't understand all of the content, and maybe it's just me, but I think there's something special about understanding and enjoying EVERY post."
Spongebros,3df4qa,ATryHardTaco,0,Thu Jul 16 04:32:57 2015 UTC,"I bet you're one of very few to have seen every episode of spongebob. And this sub wasnt made for people that have seen every episode of spongebob, it was made for comics containing smashbros and spongebob. with your logic it could be from any cartoon, not just spongebob as long as people have seen every episode of it, but we're not going to make a sub of every smashbros x show combination are we?"
Spongebros,3df4qa,DaUrn,3,Thu Jul 16 04:54:52 2015 UTC,Because it's called /r/Spongebros if it was /r/sitcombros I wouldn't mind.
Spongebros,3df4qa,Triforce1999,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know, but is it really that important? Are comics that doesn't involve Spongebob less entertaining?"
Spongebros,3df4qa,DaUrn,6,Thu Jul 16 04:29:00 2015 UTC,I think they're less entertaining because I usually don't know the source material.
Spongebros,3df4qa,Triforce1999,-3,Thu Jul 16 05:07:30 2015 UTC,Because you dont know the source material doesnt make it less fun for the most of us who dont watch spongebob all day.
Spongebros,3df4qa,SpahsgonnaSpah,7,Thu Jul 16 05:13:32 2015 UTC,"Well, this is literally a sub meant for Spongebob and Smash, so I don't think we're obligated to have other stuff on here. If you feel that strongly about it, you could make a new sub or join another that is made for that."

Spongebros,3df4qa,YoshiYogurt,14,Wed Jul 15 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. Cartoons. Not sitcoms. The posts using iCarly and Seinfeld and what not motivated me to make this post, because they aren't cartoons."

Spongebros,3df4qa,zlfaurora,6,Wed Jul 15 22:00:53 2015 UTC,But they're pretty hard to find funny when you don't know what TV show it's from.
Spongebros,3df4qa,SpahsgonnaSpah,3,Wed Jul 15 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"Why moderate the sub so heavily that you only keep jokes that pertain to just you.

Spongebros,3df4qa,standardegenerate,9,Wed Jul 15 22:43:49 2015 UTC,It's hard to find humor in something if you have to google it to understand it.
Spongebros,3df4qa,ATryHardTaco,2,Wed Jul 15 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"I meant that I won't understand the context because I haven't watched the show, not because I don't know what it is."
Spongebros,3df4qa,standardegenerate,2,Wed Jul 15 23:04:50 2015 UTC,So your solution to avoiding not understanding a joke is to get people not to tell it even if other people enjoy it?
Spongebros,3df4qa,zazrmoo195,2,Wed Jul 15 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"I guess that is unreasonable, it's just I feel like more people than me might not understand all the non-Spongebob related jokes."

Spongebros,3df4qa,humsoash,0,Sat Jul 18 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly enjoy it. I see no reason to filter out something just because its live action.   This subreddit is about spongebobXsmash. One day the mods decided, ""hey what if we allow some other shows to widen the range of jokes?"" So now on Mondays we can post stuff from any other shows. But people don't want live action? There are no real good reasons.   ""I don't understand it if it's from something I haven't watched.""  There have been posts related to plenty of anime, adult cartoons, and older cartoons that people may not have seen. So by that logic, we should get rid of MWM entirely because some people probably haven't seen Code MENT.   ""It would be fine if it was /r/sitcombros but its not."" This subreddit is /r/spongebros, not /r/cartoonbros.    Keep alive what initially made Spongebros awesome, and only use kids cartoons.   Again we have had multiple anime, and adult shows on this subreddit that are not for kids. I'm pretty sure family guy was on here at some point.   As long as the post adheres to the rules listed on the sidebar it should be allowed. especially since anything like that will be abnned in /r/smashbros."
