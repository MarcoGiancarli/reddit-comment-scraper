greece,3e3zhv,BobEWise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"Visit the moni beach in aegina, It is to my knowledge the only beach that is worth visiting. It's basically a tiny island in the south of Aegina, you can reach it by driving to the southern point called Perdika and taking a small boat-taxi there. The food in aegina is good, and buy some local pistachios. As for history I doubt there are any tours for that in Aegina, I might be wrong though."
greece,3e3zhv,europeancosmo-naught,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"Indeed Aegina isn't like the popular cosmopolitan islands, it's a different kind of experience. Personally I remember I quite enjoyed my time there, though it's been a long long time since so I'm afraid I can't make any actual suggestions about the island. In any case if you're gonna be staying there for more than a few days my advice would be to take day-trips to the rest of the Saronic islands as well, they are nearby and they are all worth a visit. Explore Aegina first and then once you feel like it take one of the first ferries to Agistri/Hydra/Poros/Spetses and return back to Aegina with the last one, rinse and repeat. You won't regret that. Especially Hydra is one of my favorite places around Greece, quiet and picturesque and relaxing, perfect for a couple.  Also, as a general kind of advice, rent a scooter if you can once you hit Aegina. It's the best way to move around freely and explore stuff."

The trip is 2-5 hours (ish) depending on which boat you take. The trade off is that bigger boats are more stable in bad weather, so you may want that option if you get seasick. Or take a Dramamine before. Weather is usually wonderful but you can get some windy days.   You can get the tickets in town or at the port, and you shouldn't have trouble finding a seat on the boat of your choice if you book a few days before. You can also go to ferries.gr if you are especially anxious and want to book beforehand. I just don't think they list everything. I can't remember prices offhand but it's a lot cheaper than flights. Maybe 30-50 EUR per person?"

Εδώ στην σελίδα 24 γράφει:   «24. Η παράγραφος 4 του άρθρου 20 του Ν. 3832/2010, όπως η παράγραφος αυτή τροποποιήθηκε με την παράγραφο 17 του άρθρου 323 Ν.4072/2012, αντικαθίσταται ως εξής:  «Συνιστάται στην κεντρική υπηρεσία της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ.  μία (1) θέση Νομικού Συμβούλου, στην οποία προσλαμβάνεται με πάγια αντιμισθία Δικηγόρος παρ’ Αρείω Πάγω. Καθήκοντα του Νομικού Συμβούλου είναι η παροχή στην ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ. νομικών συμβουλών και γνωμοδοτήσεων και γενικά κάθε είδους νομικών υπηρεσιών σύμφωνα με τον Κώδικα περί Δικηγόρων, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της εξώδικης ή δικαστικής εκπροσώπησής της μετά από ανάθεση από τον Πρόεδρο της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ. σύμφωνα με το άρθρο 14 του παρόντος. Ο Νομικός Σύμβουλος της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ. προσλαμβάνεται με απόφαση του Προέδρου της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ. ύστερα από προκήρυξη, στην οποία ορίζονται τα κριτήρια, τα προσόντα και οι όροι αμοιβής και συνεργασίας. Η διαδικασία της πρόσληψης δικηγόρων της παραγράφου 2 του άρθρου 43 Ν.4194/2013  δεν  εφαρμόζεται για το Νομικό Σύμβουλο της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ.» - Η ισχύς της διάταξης αυτής αρχίζει από την έναρξη ισχύος της παραγράφου 17 του άρθρου 323 του Ν.4072/2012.  και   «Δαπάνες για (α) παροχή συμβουλευτικών υπηρεσιών, που παρασχέθηκαν στο πλαίσιο διενέργειας της απογραφής πληθυσμού-κατοικιών του έτους 2011 και (β) για αμοιβή του Νομικού Συμβούλου της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ., που διορίστηκε κατόπιν της προκήρυξης ΓΠ-841/20.11.2013, από το χρονικό διάστημα από 14.2.2014 έως τη δημοσίευση του παρόντος νόμου, θεωρούνται νόμιμες και εκκαθαρίζονται και καταβάλλονται υποχρεωτικά από τον προϋπολογισμό της ΕΛ.ΣΤΑΤ. αμέσως μετά τη δημοσίευση του παρόντος νόμου στην Εφημερίδα της Κυβερνήσεως.» (τα bold δικά μου)  Φαίνονται μπερδεμένα τα πράγματα αλλά είναι απλά. Τον Νοέμβριο του 2013, ο πρόεδρος της ΕΛΣΤΑΤ Ανδρέας Γεωργίου μεθοδεύει την πρόσληψη του Μιχάλη Βαρώτσου ως νομικού συμβούλου τής Αρχής. Ο Βαρώτσος προσφέρει ήδη υπηρεσίες ως ελεύθερος επαγγελματίας (με αποδείξεις παροχής υπηρεσιών) αλλά ο Γεωργίου θέλει να τον κάνει μόνιμο. Έτσι, στις 20/11/2013 η ΕΛΣΤΑΤ προκηρύσσει διαγωνισμό για πρόσληψη νομικού συμβούλου, ο οποίος θα έπρεπε να διαθέτει τα προσόντα που - εντελώς συμπτωματικά - διέθετε ακριβώς ο Μιχάλης Βαρώτσος. Μάλιστα η προκύρηξη περιλαμβάνει και κάτι πρωτοποριακό: «η επιλογή του δικηγόρου που θα προσληφθεί μεταξύ των υποψηφίων θα γίνει από τον πρόεδρο της ΕΛΣΤΑΤ, ο οποίος θα εξετάσει τις αιτήσεις και τα δικαιολογητικά των υποψηφίων σύμφωνα με την παρούσα προκήρυξη και θα τους καλέσει σε ατομική συνέντευξη προκειμένου να καταλήξει στην απόφασή του». Δηλαδή, ο Γεωργίου θα μάζευε τις αιτήσεις και θα αποφάσιζε μόνος του ποιον θα προσλάμβανε η ΕΛΣΤΑΤ!  Το κακό είναι ότι η συγκεκριμένη παράγραφος της προκήρυξης παραβίαζε τον Ν.4194/2013, ο οποίος ορίζει ότι η επιλογή υποψηφίων γίνεται από πενταμελή επιτροπή στην οποία συμμετέχουν ένας αντιπρόσωπος του Νομικού Συμβουλίου του Κράτους, τρεις δικηγόροι που ορίζονται από τον οικείο Δικηγορικό Σύλλογο (εδώ της Αθήνας) και ένας εκπρόσωπος του ενδιαφερόμενου φορέα (εδώ της ΕΛΣΤΑΤ). Έτσι, ο Βαρώτσος μπορεί να προσλήφθηκε τελικά αλλά, όταν ήρθε η ώρα να πληρωθεί, το Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο διαπίστωσε την παρανομία και απέρριψε το χρηματικό ένταλμα για την πληρωμή του.   Τρεις φορές προσπάθησε ο Γεωργίου να πληρώσει τον Βαρώτσο, τρεις φορές απορρίφθηκε το ένταλμα από το Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο. Τελικά, με απόφαση που εκδόθηκε στις 30/6/2014 το Κλιμάκιο Προληπτικού Ελέγχου Δαπανών του Ελεγκτικού Συνεδρίου έκρινε τον Μιχάλη Βαρώτσο ως δικηγόρο επί αντιμισθία και όχι ως νομικό σύμβουλο, χαρακτήρισε άκυρη την πρόσληψή του και έκρινε πως το χρηματικό ένταλμα πληρωμής τής ΕΛΣΤΑΤ δεν πρέπει να θεωρηθεί. Στα τέλη του 2014, ο Γεωργίου ζήτησε από την Κομισιόν να περιληφθεί στις διατάξεις για τον νέο Κανονισμό Στατιστικών Υποχρεώσεων των φορέων του Ελληνικού Στατιστικού Συστήματος μια ρύθμιση, ώστε να τακτοποιηθεί το θέμα. Και βέβαια, οι φίλοι του στις Βρυξέλλες δεν του χάλασαν το χατήρι. Έτσι, τον περασμένο Απρίλιο οι «θεσμοί» ενημέρωσαν σχετικά το Συμβούλιο Οικονομικών Εμπειρογνωμόνων και παρέδωσαν έτοιμο στον πρόεδρό του Γιώργο Χουλιαράκη τον Κανονισμό Στατιστικών Υποχρεώσεων, τον οποίο ψήφισε η βουλή."

greece,3dwsnr,vizolover,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow history buff! I'm glad you appreciate Greek history and have visited (and I hope enjoyed) the major Athenian museums!  Your idea about a museum dedicated to the ancient Athenian agora is a good one, and as such it has already been implemented. The museum housed at the stoa of Attalos, in the ancient agora, is the museum of the ancient agora! The building in fact is an organic part of the agora, as it was erected in the 2nd century BC (it has been reconstructed). However I agree with you on the need to make use of new technologies and multimedia, to give the visitor a better knowledge of the of the time period under examination. It is something that has already been done in the museum of Cycladic art, if I remember correctly.  A museum to philosophy, on the other hand, would be harder to create. Would it house manuscripts? Busts of philosophers? Sculptures? Keep in mind that many artifacts of this nature have already been claimed by other museum throughout the world. Philosophy by definition isn't a very tangible subject. I would be glad to hear your thoughts on this."

The greek museums are more than capable of housing these artifacts in an enviromental much more better than their current place (Parthenon marbles for example, the damages suffered during their transport to england and their subsequent less than ideal display circumstances, are inumerable)."
greece,3dwsnr,x69pr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your message.  I will have to check out the Museum of Cycladic Art next time I am there.  I am not sure what a philosophy museum would be like...  Perhaps it could just be a section connected to a larger museum.  And maybe inside it could have a replica bust of some ancient philosophers and descriptions of their times and works.  It would be great to help the world understand the works of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and see how their thoughts impact us today.  The museum could also show other non-Greek philosophers as well.  I think the museums of Athens and Greece in general show historical artifacts very well (and the artifacts should be in Greece!).  But it would be great to show another dimension of history by helping people see beyond the layer of the artifacts and help them see the larger picture and how the artifacts are part of the historical story.  As you probably know, Ancient Greek history is complicated and not easily understood, but maybe if it is presented in a simple format it could be enjoyed by visitors and young and old alike.  Does anyone know if there is a Greek gods and goddesses site in Athens, like a museum or a theater?"

Some islands already have smaller boats that take passengers on small trips to places like beaches that are inaccessible by car or are used to connect islands that are very close to each other. They do so however only when the weather is good. If the wind is strong (and often is) there is significant danger for the passengers. Even the huge ferry boats that serve all year around are sometimes forbidden departure when the weather is bad enough (usually when the wind is above 8 on the beaufort scale, which is uncommon but can happen even during summer).   There has been talk about the creation a seaplane service for the islands as an alternative to the ferryboats  but nothing came out of it."

That said, if you have a private speedboat you can certainly island-hop if you're willing to pay for the gas and the weather is nice."

Even though Greece has a current accounts budgetary surplus the debt as a ratio of GDP has ballooned because austerity has shrunk the size of the economy by a third.    Had Greece left the Euro, as he had advocated in 2010, they would have had a a year or so of painful transition, followed by a normal recovery, much like Iceland and Argentina which he sited as examples.

greece,3dvhh4,ACircledSquare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:21 2015 UTC,"You realize that every ""red line"" Siriza said would not be crossed, has been crossed. You do realize that this new deal is even worst than before. You do realize, Siriza was always saying about plan B and as it turns out it plan B never existed. Does this make Greeks incompetent or naive? I would say no more than any other country that has been lied to by their politicians. So please, stop taking it so personally.   You see, for me at least, this move that you are doing (and let's be clear I have nothing against you, I'm sure you're a nice bloke), the move that takes us from what is constitutionally right, to what is politically right, ie. I was talking about how the the Greek people expressed themselves not only through the last elections, but also through the referendum, and you are talking about how a certain political party manipulated the results.   The main point here, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that despite the whole «δημιουργική ασάφεια» thing, the people said no to paying for debts that they didn't create or owe to anybody. It's not about SYRIZA, or whatever red lines they have (or think that they have), or what plans they have (or think that they have), but it's about what the people in this country want. And of course, I'm by no means a spokesperson for the people, but I am one of them, so I will take it personally, especially because whatever any Greek government does affect me personally.     This is such a crass thing to say. How do you know if people in other countries care less or more about politics in their country? Do you also understand that people in Democratic societies have shed blood for their right to vote and for their right to be free?   How is it crass to say that people died in order to have true and proper elections in this country? It's true. I'm also sure that in any other country on earth, people have died for that right too. And of course, there isn't a ""politicometre"" that can judge how a nation cares about politics. But, let's be clear would the European Union exist in its current form, if people actually knew its inner workings? Who is Tusk, who is Van Rompuy, who is Mogherini? And why those people make (or made) decisions for us? It is because people stopped caring about the whole European thing, and left it to the ""experts"" and the ""technocrats"".    I don't understand this. Yes the comment of the previous poster may have been a sarcastic comment with no real substance but tell me who hasn't done this before? Are you going to tell me you haven't done it either?    When it comes to serious issues, I haven't. And at some point, perhaps we (redditors) should care less about imaginary points and witty one-liners and actually tackle the subject at hand.   Also, why do you demand a more respectful tone to what he wants to say? Why do you view his tone as ""anti-democratic""? Why such an attachment to a Government? As long as no hate speech is involved, who dictates what and how people should express themselves. Democracy is messy, it is loud, it is difficult.

Who puts the guideline of what ""anti-democratic"" is? A sarcastic comment is anti-democratic? Prehaps a satire is anti-democratic as well? Your post is just pure emotion with no thought to it, the same way Syriza handled the situation.    First of all, I don't demand anything. I expect certain things (like arguments for example) from adults that use a public forum to voice their opinions, but I'm not Πατερούλης to make them do so. As I've mentioned, I have no attachment to SYRIZA. Let me repeat it, NONE. I actually support the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). But, I have nothing against his/her ""tone"", I have something against his/her ""arguments"". According to him, all Greek governments are incompetent. That's a ridiculous claim to make. Even I wouldn't make that claim. But, the governments, in any country don't appear out of thin air, people vote for them. So, to say that X government is incompetent, would beg two questions: a) for whom is this government incompetent and b)what does this tell us about the electorate?   S/he only tries to answer the last question indirectly and in a very broad way, by saying that ""something is wrong"", or in other words that Greeks are idiots for voting SYRIZA. Now, this is neither novel nor a particularly fresh angle for attacking SYRIZA. A national newspaper called ""Proto Thema"" has transformed this into a science in the last three months. So, this is where the ""anti-democracy"" lies. Going against the will of the people, in order to satisfy one's personal (or class) needs. And also in Greek there is a word that I'm particularly fond of ""ασυδοσία"" which refers to what can be said, yet it is beyond the ""taxation"" of a democratic conversation. It isn't hate speech, but at the same time it can be read as such, because it's outside the democratic discourse, ie. it generalises beyond the will of the people.    And just in case you accuse me of being pro ND or pro PASOK, let me stop you by saying that this bullshit for a mess has been brewing up for 40-45 years and to say that Greeks have no responsibility is just naive.Are we to run away from criticizing our selves even if it is in the form of sarcastic comments, satire or just a calm conversation ?   I challenge you to find a single piece of evidence that the Greek debt was caused by the ordinary Greeks, and not by financial institutions, or dodgy deals."

You mentioned in your previous post ""You may like it, or not, but saying that a Greek government is incompetent, is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government, and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves..""  You somehow mix expressing one's political opinion about the competence of the state as being anti-democratic.  Now if the people were lied or were told half truths, that is a whole different debate and history will pass its final judgement.   How is it crass to say that people died in order to have true and proper elections in this country?   You said in your previous post "" but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics, much more than Hans from Wuppertal, or George from New Jersey"".   When it comes to serious issues, I haven't.   As we are both members of the human race, allow me to not believe you when you say that you never, ever said in your life a comment that was just sarcastic and with no real substance.   According to him, all Greek governments are incompetent. That's a ridiculous claim to make. Even I wouldn't make that claim. But, the governments, in any country don't appear out of thin air, people vote for them. So, to say that X government is incompetent, would beg two questions: a) for whom is this government incompetent and b)what does this tell us about the electorate?   We are basically saying the same thing. The only difference is I have no qualms in saying the Government is complete idiotic because I do not directly associate the Government with its people. For example, I do not view Greeks are incompetent because they voted for Syriza, even though I view Syriza incompetent.  Do I place blame to all of us Greeks for the cluster fuck of the last 45 years? Yes I do, we should have known better and we did know better but this doesn't mean I view Greeks as incompetent. I just view it as Greeks have to get their shit together.   I challenge you to find a single piece of evidence that the Greek debt was caused by the ordinary Greeks, and not by financial institutions, or dodgy deals.   I will argue that financial institutions, or dodgy deals of course are at the core of the problem. However, to say that Greek citizens are not responsible as well is naive. Not paying your taxes, feeding into clientism are two examples of how Greek citizens fucked shit up as well. Of course you can argue that tax evation is a result of Governmental policies which then comes back to what you were saying, people elect their governments and should follow the policies of the Government they elected. If they are not happy then the people should change how things are done, as much as they can because I do realize corporate powers behind the scenes are sometimes extremely powerful."

greece,3dvhh4,vv_reddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought you were Greek. I was asking because my answer is essentially a story, but I'll try my best to tell the same story in English.   First of all, since you know what ""primary surplus"" means, and since such a term exists, then terms like ""secondary surplus"", or ""primary loss"" must also exist. Let's keep this in mind.   In Greece what we call public sector is comprised of two things:   a) General Government  b) Public Utilities and some organisations.   General government itself breaks down into three subdivisions:  i) Central Government (which essentially deals with ministries and other state organisations)  ii)The prefectures and cities  iii)Social security and hospitals  Each subdivision keeps its own books, and then the total sum is made in order to calculate the whole balance of the general government. Simple enough right? But, let's consider this:  Let's say that I have a company and I sold 10.000 Euros worth of tomatoes to your company on Christmas Eve, and you gave me a cheque dated for Valentine's Day. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for your company on the 31/12. You have a product costing 10.000 Euros and you owe me the same value in cash.   However, with the current Greek legislation, there is a surplus (the 10.000 worth of produce) because the actual payment doesn't have to happen until next year. So, in terms of government there is a surplus of 10.000, even though that is a faulty representation of reality. Of course, this happens not only in Greece, but internationally.   Now, let's say that my name is Antonis, I'm the Prime Minister of Greece, and I want to show a surplus. How easy would that be? Very easy. Probably, I'll stop paying the pharmacists, I'll delay for a couple of months sending teachers at schools, I'll stop paying pensions under the pretense that they were cheating the State, and Voila! Surplus!  Of course, the idea of a ""primary"" surplus means a positive amount without considering the interest rates of any loans. So, if I earn 1000 Euros, I spend 800, but also have 300 Euros for my mortgage, I actually have a surplus of 200 Euros.   But, Greece's GDP fell from around 231 Billion to 184 Billion, between 2009 and 2014. Which means that my ""200 Euros surplus"" actually costs me more, even though I have a surplus.   Even the ECB confirmed it for the first two quarters of 2013.   So, all in all, people died, others went unemployed, others bled financially, we are selling islands to Johnny Depp, and for what? A ""primary surplus"". Fuck me...  Edit (in response to your edit): Who exactly are ""we guys""? Please elaborate. Who thinks that Tsipras is a ""brilliant economist""? Not even the most hardcore SYRIZA supporter believes that. And just for the record, I would be much more frugal in my expressions when referring to an elected Prime Minister."
greece,3dvhh4,84d8r41ns,2,Mon Jul 20 06:40:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, a wall of text and no answer.   even though that is a faulty representation of reality.    Which is why I asked for 20 years. I mean, since DEFINITELY the financial institutions are to blame, it can't possibly be that Greece is in debt because the government was spending more than it was earning.... it's the burdens placed on you by financial institutions. So, surely, I presume, over 20 years you've had a hefty primary surplus, right?   Who exactly are ""we guys""? Please elaborate. Who thinks that Tsipras is a ""brilliant economist""? Not even the most hardcore SYRIZA supporter believes that.    Eh, I was obviously exaggerating. ""You guys"" means about half of this subreddit, often the vocal part of it. I still don't see this subreddit accept the obvious truth that it's not Germany who is ignoring your vote, but your dear elected representatives (who asked for the vote in the first place!).   And just for the record, I would be much more frugal in my expressions when referring to an elected Prime Minister.   Hahaha.  Dude, f*cking Euronews called our PM Monta. Do you know what it is? It originates from a word play which is basically an ugly swear, something like ""Ponta, suck beeep"".  Do you know why they made this mistake?

This is a public forum where people from all countries, and all backgrounds, get to exchange views. However, most of the political discourse has degraded itself to the cliche (as Deleuze would put it). Does this help the discourse? I doubt it.

Germany is Germany and Greece is Greece, as things are right now we have different goals, but this is a complicated story because capitalism.

Without the USSR-lover Andreas Papandreou, we wouldn't have the bureaucratic nomenklatura in Greece and the initial vast increase in Greece's debt, nor the worst of the parasitic oligarchs like Bobolas (affiliate of KGB) and Kokkalis (associate of Stazi).  The Mitsotakis government was the most fiscally responsible after that, so after Samaras overthrew it, it should have been voted back in instead of returning Andreas Papandreou to power.  It should have been Souflias rather than Kostas Karamanlis to take up the reign of ND, instead came Kostas Karamanlis who threw out all the liberals like Manos and cozied up to far-right and leftist thugs alike, and when he became PM utterly destroyed Greece's economy with the industrial sabotage and his overspending.  And after Kostas Karamanlis, people should have opted for Bakoyanni to succeed Karamanlis in the leadership of ND, instead of Karamanlis's favourite Samaras who kept up Karamanlis support for the far-right and did nothing to reform the country, except in blaming everything on the eeeevil Europeans.  How it would have made our position better if Greek people opted for the fiscally responsible people and the progressive Westerners, rather than always the most horrid fascists and Russia-lovers?

Ι also know that in the Souflias/Karamanlis confrontation about the leadership, the far-right supported Karamanlis, and Kontogiannopoulos and Manos and Souflias were on the opposite side. It's easy to see parties as monolithic entities, but from the start ND and PASOK both had in their midst opposite segments (ND contained both liberal capitalists and far-right fascists, PASOK contained both progressive social-democrats and USSR-loving social-fascist statists)  But FRANKLY, if we're to talk about the shameful collaboration between the Greek establishment in the early 1990s and fascist murdering thugs, then the CHIEF example would be the entire establishment's (right-wing and left-wing alike, yes Communist Party too) support of the Serb genocidal maniacs in Bosnia.  And as for dubious economic decisions, the embargo against the Republic of Macedonia by the Andreas Papandreou government, far outweighs a hundred ΑΓΕΤ Ηρακλής.

Elounda is also a really nice place to visit.Also consider Makrigialos beach and Almiros.Almiros is very close to Agios Nikolaos (about 3km south ) and due to its location, the sandy coast and the watersports centres, it gets filled with tourists around July/August.Also be sure to eat in a ""trustworthy"" taverna/restaurant because there are alot of shitty ones in summer.

greece,3du0a7,blazicekj,3,Sun Jul 19 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"Welp, from my experience 40 euros per day for a room including everything you mention would be a very generous price. Around 15th of August is considered rush hour for tourism in Greece. Even Greeks travel within the country at that time so no wonder rooms are full. I'd give booking.com a try. Try and find a way to come into contact with the room owners outside of the website (calling them for example) so you can ask about avaulability and the probability of paying with cash to get a beter price. Maybe even kindly ask them to refer you to other owners if they're fully booked. The islands you mentioned are small and people tend to know each other well."
greece,3du0a7,n8u,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's usually possible to find something under that. At least it was the 10 times I've been to Greece before (Though granted, we mostly got lucky, booked early, or we went around the end of august). There are tons of travel agencies here who offer fairly good prices, but the main prerequisite is that we don't meet too many Czechs. One can sort of grow allergic to us over a year. Not to mention it's mostly fairly uninteresting destinations.  Thanks for the tip though. I'll try writing to some of the sold out studios to see if they know somebody. These sites really seem to be oriented at better off western travellers anyway. I kid you not, I saw a multiple studios on Alonissos for 15 days today that cost more than my car, new and twice over... Either I am dumb and the price was for buying the property or I am apparently living on another planet.  And really, even though I listed ideally equipped accommodation above, in the end I'd settle for somewhere clean to sleep and garden hose to wake myself up with water in the face in the morning. The rest is a bonus."
greece,3du0a7,n8u,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"Inflated prices will exist as long as there is demand. Obviously, someone with your experience would look for better value for money. I only suggested booking.com because I've noticed that it has a wider selection than other websites when it comes to Greek islands. Avoiding it's fees by contacting room owners directly is a trick even my parents use when taveling. And if you find something worthwhile consider investing in a couple of phone calls if possible. Sometimes it's beter than email.   If you don't find any avaiable rooms near your price range I'd say just look harder (as well as use other methods to search like google for example). But avoid following the ""scooter plan"" mentioned below. To say the least, it's risky when visiting small islands around the 15th of August. It could lead you to speding more than planned.  Edit: Have look at http://www.grhotels.gr as well. They have a very inclusive list of room/hotels etc. It's not the most user friendly website but I'm sure you'll figure it out."

Greece doesn't have much greenery, but the nature is still beautiful and I don't want to add to the junk lying everywhere as it is, that's pretty hard when staying somewhere for 15 days.

Attic Greek (the language Plato wrote his books in the 5th century BC) is as Latin is to Italians.  Homeric Greek (the language used when the Odyssey and the Iliad were conceived by Homer near the 10th century BC) is too difficult to understand outright; but people familiar with the story of the Trojan war and the journey back home of Odysseus (practically all Greek people who have been to high-school) can derive the meaning of the text they are reading by some familiar words and names in it.

Most modern Greek words derive from the ancient Greek language so it's easy to pick up the meaning of most sentences. But to be honest, unless someone has shown specific interest to study the ancient language in school they won't be able to read ancient writing and fully understand it. There's a theoretical direction students can pick in the second class of highschool that includes more extensive study of the ancient language. Most students that choose this direction pay for supplementary assistance lessons outside of schools, the topic is so hard that close to no highschooler would manage getting good grades otherwise."

I just checked the grades of students at the final exams in the last highschool year in Ancient Greek and it is 45% below 10/20 (grades in Greek highschool are out of 20, with 10 being the passing grade).  Now if you add kids who didn't do the exams, kids who did not pick the Classical studies(which include ancient Greek) and kids who didnt go to school the last 3 school years (only 9 out of 12 are mandatory), then I believe it is safe to say that the much bigger majority haven't got a clue how to translate an ancient Greek text.  Now if you were an above average student, and by above average I mean way above average like 15+/20 then yes, what the other guys said, you could probably roughly translate up to Plato, but nothing before that, even if you were a top student you cannot translate Homeric Greek, for instance, at all."
greece,3dtbhx,Alien_visitor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it depends on how old the text is or from which dialect.  The Koine Greek (Common Tongue) which was used as Lingua Franca from the times of Alexander the Great, and was officially used by the Byzantines too, is relatively easy to understand and translate. But the further back you go in time, the harder it becomes. I guess an average Greek person would recognize and understand 90% to 100% of the words he reads of this form of Greek.  The hardest texts to read are Homer's, that are from the 8th century BC. These texts contain unique words not found in any other piece of literature, and some of them are translated in books etc upon assumption regarding on the context where they are used at. I guess the average person would only understand 5% to 20% of the words written in these texts."
greece,3dtbhx,Alithinos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:34:25 2015 UTC,An average educated English speaker cannot understand Old English (5th century) and can barely comprehend Middle English (12th century). The vast majority of Greek students are taught Ancient Greek from Grade 7 to Grade 11 and are able to at least grasp the meaning of texts a thousand years older than that. Koine and Medieval Greek texts (older than Old English texts) are used in church functions and are understood even by uneducated elderly people.
greece,3dtbhx,bystand3r,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:28:06 2015 UTC,To be fair the English language had much larger impact from invasions such as the Normans who brought a language that was more sophisticated than the Anglo Saxon spoken at that time. So since the natural progression is for the less advanced language assumes a larger vocabulary from the more advanced invading language. This was never really the case for Greece. I'm not claiming greek superiority in general but simply superiority over whatever was invading or migrating into greece of the course of its history - linguistically that is.   Ok maybe I am implying linguistic superiority. Fuck you its all we got left.   ;)

Αυτό μας κάνει να παριστάνουμε συνεχώς τον μάγκα και να φανταζόμαστε ότι ξέρουμε τα πάντα ήδη. Δε μας αφήνει δε να έχουμε κάποια απορία και να διερευνήσουμε, ή να έχουμε αμφιβολία για κάτι, γιατί αυτό θα προϋπέθετε ότι δεν ξέρουμε ήδη, πράγμα απαράδεκτο για τον Έλληνα. Έτσι δεν μπορούμε να σκεφτούμε καλά. Επίσης μας κάνει να υποτιμάμε τους άλλους και να μηδενίζουμε.  Ένα άλλο που έχουμε είναι πρόβλημα ψυχολογικής βίας. Έχουμε πολύ βία μέσα μας ως λαός. Αυτό μας κάνει να μην μπορούμε να ακούσουμε και να δεχτούμε(τον άλλον ή την πραγματικότητα πολλές φορές). Επίσης, σε συνδιασμό με τη λαϊκή μας αφήγηση, μας κάνει να είμαστε διαρκώς επαναστατημένοι και να φανταζόμαστε ότι το καθήκον του λαού είναι πάντα να αντιστέκεται. Κάνουμε συνεχώς επανάσταση, τόσο που δεν μπορούμε να έχουμε κάποια σταθερή ""θέση"". Έχει επίσης ως αποτέλεσμα να φανταζόμαστε εχθρούς.  Με μία λέξη, αυτό που θα ήθελα είναι να είμαστε σοβαροί."

Or just ask people with gardens to give you some cuttings.  Golden Dawn will not be an issue. Random racism and insensitivity you will have to get used to. There is ZERO political correctness.

Cooking Asian/Mexican food can be really tough and i suggest trying the Greek Cuisine.The wildlife is pretty spectacular , there are many different animals you can see in Crete and island Dia (right next to crete) has (or used to have) lots of Kri-Kri (under protection)."
greece,3do6z2,Sojoez,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"hello. i am from crete, born and raised.   tea stuff.   i have no idea. probably you could find something in chania or heraklion i guess. (me not having idea is a bad sign though :P )   wildlife   check out the pictures in this page (birds on the bottom): http://xenioskris.pblogs.gr/agria-panida-ths-krhths.html   gardening nurseries   i dont know what is that   americans   basically you know why america is generally criticised around the western world, add a tad bit more here because a) we, as a country are leftists, b) extra anti-war (the bosnia thing in the 90s was a huge blow in america's reputation here). i can safely say that you will have no problem just because you are american.   racism   in crete (and in greece in general) sterotypical gd guys exist in the shadows. they are the exception, and people dont declare openly if they are members of the party. Especially in crete, golden dawn has the worst rates in the whole greece.   mexican and asian   let's just say that i would be highly suprised to find that people here know about mexican food (as it is defined in america) or any asian food other than sushi.   food   we put olive oil in everything (we make the best in the world if you can find locally produced). tomatoes are good here since we use them in a lot of food. i cant think of anything specific since i dont know what you might not know. also, fish here are popular along the coastline, and lamb is popular in high altitudes.  ---generally  the climate here is nice and warm, we have nice beaches and all that stuff you probably already know. i am gonna just let you know a few stuff you might not know.  religion  people here are 99% orthodox christians (baptised at a small age), but because of the fact the it is the ""normal"", people take the ""meh"" stance on religion and go to church once a year. unless you get on a stool and shout ""fuck jesus"" you should be fine and wont even notice anything apart for the amount of small churches that look abandoned.  localism  people here are veeeeeery proud of the place. like, a lot. which makes them very hopsital if you are friendly, and very angry if you look down upon it.  driving  roads are terrible, everyone has a car, so you kinda have to understand how driving works first as far as city center's go and the rural roads.  english language  the majority of the people in tourist areas can definitely understand you and tell you the basic stuff, but they are not that good at expressing themselves in english. in non-tourist areas, you will find a lot of people that dont know english at all.  racism  generally we are not racist, as (thanks to all the tourist areas) we are kinda progressive (not reddit level, but pretty good compared to the rest of greece). if you are far asian, people might call you chinese, but only because of legit ignorance and not hate. if you are black, people will notice the fuck out of you, but dont be scared, i dont think anyone really hates black people here. basically there hasnt been any real contact with black people, so the result is what i told you. you might notice some ""ah, that place is shit haha"", but that's mostly the ""localism"" i described you.  anyway, let me know for any more info. btw, if you come at summer, prepare for some real heat."

I cook almost exclusively with olive oil so I am ready to taste some real Greek olive oil that I am sure has a richer taste than what I usually find around here.   Gardening nurseries is like a garden center where you can buy soil, compost, seeds, plants. Anything to do with gardening really.   I'm not so worried about racist hate toward me. I am ambiguously mixed race anyway. Mexican, Native American, and bit of European. I'm brown/tan lol. Though I have experienced it before in England and Ireland as well as parts of my home state here in Texas. Like, to the point someone acted like they couldn't understand what I was saying even though I speak English and English is my first language. People are weird and racists scare the hell out of me!  I plan to start learning Greek soon. I believe we are going to be moving to Crete in the fall and maybe even take some language classes once we have arrived. Do you have any classes like this?  I can drive but I will take my time to learn how to drive in a different country. We mostly plan to either be around places that are within walking distance or public transport.

Gardening nurseries: Lol. If you get a place with your own garden you can do whatever you want with it. And I assume you want ""organic"" vegetables i.e. not grown in sterile greenhouses by the millions? Don't worry, practically all vegetables in Greece are locally grown and taste a lot better than what you are used to. Heck, even cucumber which is 98% water has a great taste. Oh right, a place to buy small vegetable plants. Yes, those exist around most agricultural areas.  Have you ever been to Greece for a vacation? Moving to a country without visiting it first is not a smart idea. Be ready for a culture shock. Americans tend to get those even in the UK or in the Netherlands."

I did get a culture shock when being in England. I love it though. I love experiencing different countries and cultures!
greece,3do6z2,Aidegamisou,3,Sat Jul 18 02:43:52 2015 UTC,"I'll just answer the questions I know the answers to (ie. not all your questions).   First off we don't hate anericans nor do I think you'll find people hating you because of your nationality. This ""hatred"" towards the American government was caused because of the way the US exercised its foreign policy in Greece during the Cold War. You're not Nixon, or Spyro Agnew, I assume, so I think you'll be fine.   Crete is an exceptionally hospitable island, you will be in awe after a while. However. If you comment on the people or the country, as foreigners do (I do too when I'm abroad) keep in mind that most Greeks speak and understand more than one foreign languages, English being the one most Greeks understand very very well.   As for tea houses, and ethnic supermarkets, well, Crete might not be the right place for you, if both those are important for you.  Athens might be more up your alley, regarding those things.   Crete has wildlife and a few birds that you might only find there and in just one or two more places in Europe, it's also iirc a waypoint for migratory birds. The climate is also ideal for growing up plants and greenhouses can be found everywhere on the island.   In short, while you might have chosen the right place regarding some of your requirements, you should reconsider about others (tea houseS and ethnic supermarkets). Unless you plan on living in Crete but traveling regularly to Athens or other big cities."
greece,3do6z2,Divine2012,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"Crete is huge, and the people in majority are kind and want to help others to settle. In big cities the lifestyle is the same as any city in Greece but have a touch of their own culture. many villages are ok and live from tourism, some don't like strangers even from other parts of Greece, but I don't think you will ever encounter them. In Greece we don't hate Americans, we just mock them and we mention them sometimes like: Stop eating junks like Americans or stop being an American and favor big companies.It's not hate. We do this for many different countries/cultures  as a way to describe our own.  Golden Dawn won't even bother to do something to you, they focus mainly on 3rd countries that a lot of immigrants come from and not from western societies.  The thing about KKK is wrong, They are communists and don't give signs they favor center-far right. And they are against G.D. and vice versa.  There are some variates of tea in Crete and the most known is malotira(Μαλοτήρα)  About the wildlife, it depends where you are in Crete. There are some animals that live only there: Goats(kri-kri), frogs, rodents, hawks.Search in goolge and you will found out. But in general the wildlife is  huge.  there must be mexican or asian places in big cities and I don't think it will be easy to find them if there are any. I ate chinese in Chania and Agios Nikolaos though."

I want friends who are interested in genuinely being friends with me instead of only seeing what they can get from me or take advantage.  This is why we want to move to Greece.

greece,3do6z2,zesic,3,Sat Jul 18 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"In Crete, you can get to the top of our highest mountain, all the way down and across the plains and finally make it for a swim in the crystal clear waters of the Libyan (south) or Cretan (north) sea, in 1 hour flat.   Local wild mountain herbs will amaze you. You can easily learn how to find all sorts of incredibly healthy and tasteful wild vegetation, both edible and aromatic (for tea or even homemade medicine). Be on the lookout for good books on the matter, there are plenty.   People here tend to care more about who you are and less about what you are. While we are friendly with everyone, remember that nobody likes a douchebag, regardless of ethnicity. Also, keep in mind that villages and smaller towns are ""closed"" communities, which means that you have to be accepted first which will take a month or so, until people get used to you being around.   Agriculture is the island's main income(along with tourism of course). You can find everything about small scale gardening to industrial grade plants and soils - enhancers.  We grow peppers (both sweet and hot), cucumbers, eggplants, tomatoes, bananas - you name it. I don't know of many plant types that would not be just fine to grow here. I'll teach you a Greek word here : ""Φυτώριο"" (Fitorio, pronounced ""Fee-tor-ee-oh"") - plant nursery. Should come in handy.   Finally, there are Mexican and Asian restaurants around, I know of a few in Heraklion and elsewhere. If you enjoy their food, you can ask the cooks about the ingredients and where you can go looking for the more  ""exotic"" ones.

Έγραψα σπαμ αντί να γράψω ""έγραφε συνέχεια τα ίδια και τα ίδια ενοχλητικά εριστικά μηνύματα και σε κάθε thread που έμπαινες έβλεπες τα ίδια επαναλαμβανόμενα μηνύματα αυτουνού"".   Από τo wiktionary: (transitive, intransitive, computing, Internet) To post the same text repeatedly with disruptive effect; to flood.   οι λογαριασμοί που είχε ήταν διαφορετικοί από όσους βρήκες εσύ   Πιστεύεις δηλαδή ότι οι λογαριασμοί που βρήκα δεν ήταν δικοί του; Οι λογαριασμοί που έγιναν ban ήταν αυτοί που έκανε vote manipulation. Αυτοί που δεν έγιναν ban σημαίνει απλώς ότι δε βρέθηκαν στοιχεία για το vote manipulation, όχι ότι δεν ήταν ο ίδιος. Μου κάνει τεράστια εντύπωση η εμμονή σου. Ούτε ο ίδιος δεν κάνει τον κόπο να αρνηθεί ότι όλοι αυτοί οι λογαριασμοί είναι δικοί του αλλά εσύ κάθεσαι και πιστεύεις ότι πρόκειται για διαφορετικά άτομα. Αν πραγματικά πιστεύεις ότι είναι διαφορετικά άτομα, κάνε με ban για harassment.    ότι έκανε vote manipulation είναι κάτι που δεν θα μπορούσα ποτέ να ξέρω.    Δεν κατάλαβες τι έγραψα. Έγραψα ένα απλό πράγμα. Ότι αν έκανες τη δουλειά σου ως mod, η οποία περιλαμβάνει να έχουμε ένα φυσιολογικό περιβάλλον που να μην είναι γεμάτο από μαλάκες που σπαμάρουν μαλακίες, τότε δε θα έφταναν τα πράγματα εδώ που έφτασαν. Η αδιαφορία σου με ανάγκασε να λάβω πιο σκληρή στάση για ένα ζήτημα που δε θεωρούσα τόσο σημαντικό.   Είναι σα να πηγαίνω στο γείτονα και να του λέω να χαμηλώσει τη μουσική αλλά να με γράφει. Μετά Από 100 φορές θα καλέσω την αστυνομία και αν η αστυνομία βρει ναρκωτικά στο σπίτι του, τότε θα μπορώ να πω ""αν με άκουγε εξαρχής τότε η κατάσταση δε θα γίνονταν escalate και θα γλίτωνε τα βάσανα"". Δε σημαίνει ότι ήξερα ότι έχει τα ναρκωτικά. Σημαίνει ότι μια απλή κατάσταση θα μπορούσε να λυθεί με έναν απλό τρόπο αν εσύ ή ο Ανωνυμίας ήσασταν συνεργάσιμοι.    Δεν έχει γίνει ban από το υποreddit (και τώρα πια δεν μπορώ και να τον κάνω), οπότε δεν ξέρω ποιό ακριβώς σύστημα θα ενεργοποιηθεί.   Πάλι δεν κατάλαβες τι είπα. Ο πιο πάνω είπε ""σάμπως και να τον έκαναν οι mods ban από το sub δε θα επέστρεφε;"". Και απάντησα ""αν τον έκαναν, τότε το ρέντιτ θα είχε σύστημα για να δυσκολέψει την επιστροφή του"".    Όσο για το περιεχόμενο, το να έχεις άποψη, ιδιαίτερα όταν είναι διαφορετική,   Εσύ πιστεύεις ότι απλώς εξέφραζε μια διαφορετική άποψη; Πόσο κοιμισμένος είσαι πια; Ο άνθρωπος ήταν disruptive και έλεγε 100% μαλακίες. Όσο γρηγορότερα το αναγνωρίσεις αυτό τόσο το καλύτερο.    Μη μπερδεύεις αυτό για τον οποίο τον κατηγόρησες, και για το οποίο έκανες research, με το λόγο για τον οποίο έγινε site-wide-ban, ότι δηλαδή χρησιμοποιούσε διαφορετικούς λογαριασμούς για να κάνει upvote τον εαυτό του - και προφανώς όχι αρκετούς.   Δε μπερδεύω καθόλου τους λόγους. Απλώς αναφέρω ότι είναι συνδεδεμένοι. Αν κάποιος είναι μαλάκας και έχει 100 λογαριασμούς για να σπαμάρει τις ανοησίες του, η πιθανότητα να κάνει και vote manipulation είναι μεγάλη. Αν δεν συνδέονταν τα δύο ενδεχόμενα, τότε οι admins δε θα ασχολούνταν με την κατηγορία μου. Θα μου έλεγαν ""ναι, αλλά δεν απαγορεύεται να έχεις πολλούς λογαριασμούς, ξαναστείλε μας μήνυμα όταν έχεις στοιχεία για vote manipulation, δε μπορούμε να ψάχνουμε τον καθένα που έχει ένα throwaway"".    Δεν έχω πρόθεση να συνεχίσω να ρίχνω λάδι στη φωτιά, δεν είναι και αυτός ο ρόλος μου. Ελπίζω να μη χρειαστεί να αφιερώσω άλλο χρόνο σε αυτό το θέμα.   Τότε άσε με ήσυχο και διάβαζε πιο προσεχτικά τι γράφω πριν γράφεις μηνύματα για να ""μου την πεις"" χωρίς να καταλαβαίνεις τι λες.   Κάτι τελευταίο: Πραγματικά θεωρώ ότι your heart is in the right place αλλά αυτό δεν αρκεί για να είσαι mod. Πρέπει να έχεις την κριτική σκέψη για να μην είσαι κολλημένος στις απόψεις σου και αυτό δεν το έχεις.  Bye bye."

However, using multiple accounts to manipulate the votes is against the rules. Using the links you provided, I did discover some of that activity and the accounts that took place in it were banned.  Additionally, another rule we have concerning accounts is subreddit ban evasion. If one account is banned from a particular subreddit, that means all of the alt accounts that are controlled by that person also have to stay out of the sub. If they don't then they can be shadowbanned too.  Lastly, that script is really cool. Good job."

Καταλαβαίνω ότι η θέση σου είναι περίεργη γιατί δεν είναι ενάντια στους κανονισμούς του ρεντιτ, αλλά αυτοί οι κανονισμοί είναι απλά ένα ελάχιστο το οποίο πρέπει να ακολουθείται και δε σημαίνει ότι οι κοινότητες δεν μπορούν να έχουν επιπλέον κανονισμούς, επίσημους ή ανεπισημους ή απλά ο εκάστοτε διαχειριστής να προβαίνει σε δράσεις οι οποίες κρίνει ότι βοηθούν την καλύτερη λειτουργεία της κοινότητας.

Επιπρόσθετα, η όλη φιλοσοφία του reddit είναι όσο το δυνατόν να μην παίζει ρόλο ο χρήστης αλλά το περιεχόμενο. Αυτός είναι ο λόγος που τα username στα σχόλια είναι τόσο ""θαμμένα"", ή το ότι π.χ. δεν μπορείς να έχεις avatar (υπάρχει ο snoovatar αλλά δεν χρησιμοποιείται πουθενά). Ο λόγος είναι για να ασχολείσαι με την άποψη και όχι με το ποιός την έγραψε.  Επίσης, όπως έχω ξαναπεί πολλές φορές, το /r/greece δεν το έφτιαξα, το βρήκα.

What do you think of expats? do you think it could be easy/hard to come back? Is it easy to open a new activities in greece? The unemployment rates are horrible right now, even if tsipras started to give more jobs in the public sectors. I´ve seen a lot pf people sitting in coffees, talking, reading, drinking, staying together..i like it, but is there any organized project about social help for poors, environment protection, self-production of everyday goods?

This places were isolated for a long time so the language changed and there are different theories about how it evolved, some says it come from a byzantine dialect, some that it comes from the ancient greek and evolved from the spoken version etc.  Anyway, my question is, how much can you understand from this link?  https://youtu.be/ukLJ3dPc2-Y?t=6m5s  The calabrian greek start at 6:05, and even if I live just some kms from those beautiful places, I can't understand anything.

Their claim on ancestry from Macedonians and Alexander is bogus and has been refuted by scholars everywhere. I'll try to link you to an /r/askhistorians thread that deals with the subject, but later on as I'm on mobile at the moment.   The world thinks that Greeks overreacted with FYROM but if you took the time to learn how Greece came to be as a country with its current borders, you'd understand that.   To give you an example: Imagine if Greeks started to say that Sicily and the southern parts of Italy are Greek and not Italian, because the people there were once part of Greece. You would laugh at the suggestion, right? Now imagine that not even 100 years ago the borders between Greece and Italy were finalised with massive population exchanges and forced nationalisations. And imagine that Greece is landlocked and needs an exit to the sea.   In short: this goes way beyond the name and is perceived as a threat to national security by a nation that has no real claim to Macedonia, but needs an exit to the Aegean."

But to be honest, pointing out the differences in the accent (in Greece) is kind of a new-ish thing. I cannot recall anyone discussing this 10-20 years ago. I think we are stretching things here..  You can see real accent differences in the UK and Germany for sure."
greece,3dlor1,gorat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell the difference in German accents (when they speak English). But for Greeks I can tell easily (it's the deep L mostly and the way of talking). It was not a serious comment, the Northern accent soothes me :)"

greece,3dlor1,segolas,8,Fri Jul 17 20:13:53 2015 UTC,Most of the questions will be about the crisis I think so I'm gonna ask about something that everyone likes: food.  Ok. Here we go:   the original recipe of the Moussaka as made by your mom whe you were a child your favorite recipe that I can try on my own   Thanks!
greece,3dlor1,kafrofrite,7,Fri Jul 17 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Ingredients for moussaka.  4 medium sized eggplants, 4-5 potatoes, 4 zucchinies, 700 grams of ground beef, 1 small onion, a little bit of olive oil, pepper salt.  wash and cut the vegetables in a round way. The eggplants should be put in water with salt for about half an hour. Fry for little time (she said lightly) the vegetables in oil. If you want you can bake them lightly. Put the vegetables in paper to lose oil.  Regarding the ground beef, in a frying pan you put the onion, oil, salt and pepper and you prepare the ground beef like you would do for spaghetti.   Take a baking pan and start by putting the potatoes in. Ten ground beef, then eggplants, then zucchinies then ground beef, you got the idea, repeat till you run out of ingredients. Prepare the bechamel and pour it on top. If you don't know how to do it, google it.  Bake it in medium temperature for about an hour till the bechamel starts to bake (it starts to turn gold).  Edit: she said that you can add spices in the ground beef if you want as well."

greece,3dlor1,kafrofrite,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"in a nutshell, you prepare the ground beef (if you want to add ground beef) and the rice. You clean peppers and tomatoes from the inside (their flesh ) and you stuff them either with rice or with rice and ground beef. You bake them and then you eat them :P"

greece,3dlor1,tzuridis,4,Fri Jul 17 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"Learn basic stuff yes, to have a conversation you have to practice having them with a teacher. To actually know the language however you have to read a lot of vocabulary, watch Greek TV shows over and over to understand them, have conversations with natives and record yourself so you can hear your accent over and over until you and natives can't tell the difference. That's what I do"
greece,3dlor1,Moschettiere,8,Fri Jul 17 18:58:10 2015 UTC,Καλὸ ἀπόγευμα Greece!  First I want to ask you about food!  What is your favorite Italian dish?  What traditional greek dish you eat more during the course of a normal week?  Then I have two questions regarding politics and the crisis.  Do you think Italy should have been more supportive and should have tried to help Greece more during the last EuroGroup meetings and during the negotiations?  What is your judgment and opinion about this six months of the Tsipras Government?  Are you satisfied with his way to conduct negotiations? What has he done in domestic policy?  Last two questions!  I'm going to visit Greece on September! What is a lesser know place of Greece that I should absolutely see?  There is one stereotype about italians that you think is true ? And there is a stereotype about greeks that you think is true too?  Thanks for the hospitality and Αντίο!
greece,3dlor1,belial-,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"What is your judgment and opinion about this six months of the Tsipras Government? Are you satisfied with his way to conduct negotiations? What has he done in domestic policy?   Yes I am quite happy with both the negotiations and him as a PM. The truth is that he hasn't done much on the inside yet, and he has already been criticized for it.  However, I still give him time, as I did with the previous ones.  Now, there is also one difference between Tsipras and the previous governments, and this is that they were all in the political scene for lots of years and become completely corrupted. Hence they were completely unable to do any major reforms (apart from decreasing wages, and increasing taxes) because all their ministers were involved in some kind of scandal and thus easy to be controlled.  On the other hand, Tsipras used to run a small party with minimum involvement in all these. However, some of his MPs were not originally from SYRIZA, but from the old completely corrupted parties. So who knows...I trust him that he really wants to fix things, if it only was that simple..."

I'm planning a 2 weeks/3 weeks trip and the first week I plan to see the Peloponnese, specifically the city of Athens and the ancients sites of Corinth and Mycenae .   Then for the second week I was planning to head north into Macedonia so your advice is perfect because after researching on Google about Pieria I realized that it is in Macedonia so while heading into the northern part of Greece I could stop there for 2 or 3 days.   Italians move their hands way too much    Ahahahah! I can totally confirm ! And that's beacuse I'm a primary example of that. I don't know why but every time I begin talking passionately with someone without even noticing I start moving my hands and arms evrywhere.

Two questions about history:   ELI5 what happened to the greeks who lived in the islands of Turkey when Greece became indipendent from Ottoman Empire in the 1820s? Those islands and lands were inhabitated by greeks from millennia! Maybe a stupid question, but why you don't have a king anymore? We had a referendum between monarchy and republic, what happened to Greece?"
greece,3dlor1,sherlock234,5,Fri Jul 17 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'll start from your second question. We had a referendum as well, in 1974 after democracy was restored, and we decided we didn't want the monarchy anymore.   As for your first question: Greece gained its independence in 1830 and became a sovereign nation, but it kept expanding up until 1945 when the Dodecanisa, the 12 islands at the south-east of the Aegean were given to Greece by Italy. At the moment, there are a couple of islands, Imvros and Tenedos, under Turkish rule. These islands have a small Greek minority but it's dwindling down."

greece,3dlor1,tserts,5,Fri Jul 17 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"Not that much, some basic training is required, and one needs to base that on a solid modern Greek fluency (syntax, grammar, vocabulary), as an intermediate speaker, you won't be able to understand the texts by yourself. However, if you have the translation you will be able to decode the structure and the meaning. A modern Greek with no formal training in ancient Greek would only make out some words and at most the general topic. Some texts, such as poetry, dramas etc, are very difficult to even get a general idea of what is written, due to the use of compact, musical structure of the text."
greece,3dlor1,Bromao,4,Fri Jul 17 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"Hello friends from Greece!  My university recently held a seminary about war and memory in the ancient time, and obviously ancient Greece was a big part of it, so I've been wondering - how alive is that kind of imagery in nowadays Greece? I don't mean as a tourist attraction, obviously, I'm more referring to stuff like Golden Dawn (supposedly) basing itself upon Spartan ideals and such. Is that sort of thing common? Do other political parties recall elements of ancient Greek history as well?"
greece,3dlor1,sherlock234,3,Fri Jul 17 11:42:55 2015 UTC,"Well, Ancient Greece is a big part of our education, as I imagine the Roman Empire is in yours. It's part of our identity as well.   Golden Dawn draws on the ideals of Sparta the same way the nazis did. Idealizing a militaristic and disciplined society, with strict hierarchy and draconian laws. Golden dawn started out as a Neo-nazi party, but after the crisis it watered down its rhetoric to reach out to more people. Other parties used to draw from the past. Mostly right-wing parties. But that's in the past. I mean today, if you exclude GD if a politician makes a reference to Ancient Greece, other than to reference to something that is known, and even then it seems like an easy cop out, like a half-assed effort to sound educated but also to stroke the people's ego. It doesn't make a good impression, at least to me. Rarely do the politicians reference something from the past with gusto and deep knowledge of the subject."

My friend has worked in Athens for the past few months, he jokingly says that the reason why the economy there is bad is because Greeks drink too much at night, can't go to sleep and therefore are groggy and unproductive in the morning. Banter aside, how important is coffee in socialisation and as a cultural staple in Greece? Those who are familiar with Italy, what would you say is different about coffee culture?"
greece,3dlor1,sherlock234,4,Fri Jul 17 11:38:57 2015 UTC,Coffee is an excuse to socialize in Greece. When you go out with your friends for coffee you're supposed to stay at the cafeteria for hours talking or just hanging out. In Italy you go to a cafe to drink your coffee and leave.

Hubris, the mortal sin comitted by humans to gods, Aite, the moral blindness that prohibits the protagonist from reading the signs and changing his stance, and of course, nemesis, the inevitable vengeance of the gods.   As for merkel, no comment. If she's just doing what is best for everyone, then there's no need for Zeus to smite her. If she's guilty of hubris and blind to what she's doing, then nemesis is just around the corner. Either way history will judge her for her actions and decisions."

Is it like Latin and Italian (same alphabet, lots of words in common but evolved in the ages) or it like a different language? Speaking about food (thinking about Greece I can only think about oil, wine, cheese, fish and wheat - very simmilar to south Italy), but what are the national food? What's the tipical greek meal?

greece,3dlor1,tzuridis,10,Fri Jul 17 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"Old Greek had many different forms. The most commonly known is koine which is what the bible was written in etc. That is the easiest to understand. Dorikos Greek (a different dialect and they also had some different words) is what the Peloponnese, Epirus, and Macedonia spoke before Rome destroyed all their cities with the Attic/Ionians. Those refugees went to Pontus and then the Mithradatic wars happened. Eventually koine replaced all dialects except for a few. The Tsakonian and Pontian people are the only group that still use Dorik words. That is the second least difficult. Mycenean Greek is pretty hard to understand, Minoan is basically incomprehensible. There are a lot of different ones I didn't include also like Aeolic but I think you get my point.  Koine is easy to learn, there are minor differences like Θαλαττα and Θαλασσα but there are some big difference as well. A modern Greek can learn it relatively easily. Dorik is harder even if you know tsakonian, some aspects of pontiaka etc. Anyway it gets harder the further you go back."

A modern Greek can learn it relatively easily.    By ""relatively easy"", do you mean that you need proper schoolwork or is it something that you can pick up casually?  To give an idea of my reference frame, simple Latin phrases are reasonably easy to get the gist of for an Italian, but anything more complex becomes pretty hopeless unless you've actually studied Latin, and most people who study it in school can translate Latin to Italian but would be stumped writing anything non-trivial in Latin themselves.  Compared to this, where does the ease of learning koine for a Greek person stand?"
greece,3dlor1,tzuridis,5,Fri Jul 17 12:12:08 2015 UTC,Proper schoolwork but I think some could figure it out on their own like a priests son who is exposed to koine much more often etc.

How are Italians seen because of that? Local history tend to tell us that Italians were the goods and Germans were the bads. But we also did very dirty things like the Domenikon Massacre which Italian history school books do not mention. It is also true that we had our soldiers killed by the Germans there. People here generally think that Italian soldiers in Greece were like in the Oscar winning movie Mediterraneo or Captain Corelli's Mandolin. How are generally viewed in Greece today? Is there any feeling of hate? (maybe especially among older people)."

That's unlike the Germans who went out of their way to make our lives bad. There is no hate. We just consider you too loud, which you are. :)"
greece,3dlor1,sherlock234,10,Fri Jul 17 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"No hate towards the Italians. The Italians weren't as vicious as the Germans and the turn of events, with the Italian forces losing to the Greek army in the beginning of the war and calling a truce and being stranded at the end of it left no feelings of hatred. You are considered a brotherly nation to Greeks, one that shares with us thousands of years of history and cultural exchange. I don't know whether you share the feeling but at least that's how I believe Greeks feel towards you."

Anyway this is going to sound kind of stereotypical but yes and no. Like I said its all subjective, Epeirotes and islanders are going to dislike Italians and Albanians more than a Thrakiotis who would dislike Bulgarians and Turks more. That being said in my opinion most people in Greece do not have that much or any dislike, they simply do not care that much and they try to view the current page in the book in a better light than that of the previous ones. Anyway for me my example is my Grandad fought in WWII and his brother was killed when fighting Albanians and Italians.

The devil is also depicted as a black man many times in Christianity by many Christian scholars and they also associated Satan with Muhammad. This is not just in Greece but in the rest of Europe like in France, Germany Italy etc. This all began after the muslim conquests 650s+ and ever since then black the color of death and destruction has been associated with Islam by Christians.

I'm a high school students, and this year we are going to do a school trip of an entire week, and, since in my kind of school (Liceo Classico) subjects like History or Classical Culture (Latin and Greek) are very important, we were thinking of Greece. But I have a few questions:   Prices: with the crisis, places for tourists are now more or less expensive? Or nothing really changed? Locations: apart from the obvious one like Athens or Santorini/Thera, what are some good (and economical!) places for students? Language: is English spoke everywhere in Greece? Only in some places? Only by the young?   Thank you, and good luck with everything!"

Anyway these past 3 weeks the prices did go down because of a lot of cancellations but now with the new deal and banks reopening on Monday almost every place is getting full.  -What exactly do you want to see? What era in history? And do you have a car? Can you take a boat ride to an island? Other than Athens for Greco-Roman history go to Peloponnesos and see Korinthos, Mystras/Sparti, Patras, Olympia, and then if you can go north go to Delfi, Amfipoli, Thessaloniki for some Hellenic, Roman and Ottoman stuff.  For more post Roman Italian history go such as Venetian and Genoan history go to the islands, check out Xania in Crete, Rhodes etc.   That being said you can find historic sites all over just like in Italy if you drive around you will literally see these brown signs of archaelogical tombs, temples, places, cities, villages all over the place. You will probably be on a tour bus though since you are in highschool.  -Most young people know English, it depends where you are.

greece,3dlor1,Mandovai,8,Fri Jul 17 17:31:03 2015 UTC,Hey fellow lurker.  a) Not much. It will depend on the funds released by the EU for the growth of the Greek economy but we will not know anything about that for a few weeks to a few months.  So it looks like the result of the referendum was simply that we now know for a fact that the SYRIZA government did not have any plan in place for the event they got a 'no' in the question that they put to the Greek people. Which makes it look like they expected to get a 'yes' vote and absolve themselves from the responsibility of accepting a bad deal that they had no way of improving. And it also looks like they do not have the stomach to govern a country they would have had to lead out of the Eurozone (and potentially the EU altogether) if they asked for a better deal that they knew would get rejected by the European Council.   b) That he is just another lying politician.   This perception had changed in a positive way until I got to see the last Greek proposals and the reaction of the European Council.  Now I think he is just another lying politician.

I feel it's very reminiscent of lasagna, so I guess they can be compared!  Moussaka, on the other hand, is a dish with potatoes (or eggplants), minced meat and a similar cream on top. Both dishes are baked in the oven.  They are what tourists often think of when Greek cuisine comes to mind (along with gyros, of course), but they take some preparetion so for most normal people it's the sort of food they'll eat twice or thrice a month. Greek cuisine is very rich and uses a variety of ingredients, so I highly recommend you look into it if you're into food, you will find a bunch of delicious recipes!"

greece,3dkq9p,Bi0sHift,8,Fri Jul 17 01:38:02 2015 UTC,"Go to a central hub island, like Paros. Then take a boat to a new nearby island every day or other day. Ferry tickets are about $10 per person each way. Well worth it.  Also, use booking.com to find rooms for cheap.  You can also skip Athens all together and fly straight into an island. Santorini is a good choice and has flights from all over Europe."
greece,3dkq9p,ringinator,4,Fri Jul 17 04:03:13 2015 UTC,"Posting a comment I put for most recent tourism posts:  I'm assuming you will be coming to Athens, islands will obviously differ, but this information in generally helpful anyway.  People in tourist areas generally speak good English, though it wouldn't hurt to learn a little of the lingo, if only to say thank you and so on.  Money-wise, bring plenty of cash, since ATMs will have little money in them, the queues to withdraw money are long. If your hotel has a safe, use it, if you don't plan on carrying all your money everywhere with you. Keep your passports, flight tickets and important documents in the safe, or if you insist on carrying them with you, treat them like your firstborn.  I'd recommend photocopying your passport and local embassy info to carry with you somewhere safe, as a backup.  Muggings are rare, but they do happen, just be cautious as with any large city, and keep a hold of your belongings. If on the Metro or buses and you're carrying a large backpack, please don't keep it on your back, I've noticed people do this all the time. It makes it harder for people to fit so you get annoyed commuters too, but also when its crowded, you just can't tell if there is someone opening a pocket. Take it off your back and carry it in front of you.  There are generally lots of beggars or people selling sewing kits and squashy tomato toys (over five years and they're still at it!), so it is okay to just ignore them. If possible, don't carry your camera out all the time, this is just my own preference though, since certain areas gets busy (like Plaka) it may get damaged.  Avoid certain areas at night, such as the side streets in Omonia, and Exarheia, though it's unlikely you'll be near those areas if you're staying in a good hotel.  FYI, I have never been mugged in the 10 years I've lived here. Meanwhile in my past in London, I was mugged once successfully and two failed attempts.  Debit card and contact-less payments work well, my Greek card has had no issues here (so far). Greece is a little behind on the whole chip and pin thing though, so only large retailers would do it, smaller shops tend to still use cash only. If you do use chip-and-pin, bear in mind that if paying from USD, conversion rates may be unfavourable depending on your bank's policies.  A few classic things to do in my opinion. 1. Eat a kebab at Thanasis in Monastiraki, they're the largest one there and don't even need to advertise when compared with the other souvlaki places, On the corner they have more tables there. 2. While everyone loves the Acropolis, I personally feel it's too busy and quite tiring to get up the hill. A quieter place is the Agora, where the temple of Hephaestus is. You can't miss it, the entrance is literally between Monastiraki and Thisseo metro stations. 3. Lykavitos, the very high church, has the best sunset in Athens, seeing as the sun sets later, check out what time it would be on your phone and try to get up there beforehand and sit and wait. Soldiers also come to take down the flag every evening so you can also watch that. 4. The temple of Poseidon in Sounio is a lovely location, look up KTEL (national bus service) and take yourself there for a day. your hotel may be able to provide this info. 5. On the way back, you could even choose to stop in Anavissos, a coastal town, (KTEL stops there, and the bus conductor should be able to stop the bus for you), which has loads of fish restaurants (psarotavernas). Squid, octopus and saganaki (fried cheese) are usually on the menu, and worth trying once at least, since they are lush. For a change, there is even a Cypriot restaurant, though this is slightly away from the fish tavernas. There is also a lovely sandy beach should you wish to sunbathe or swim there. 6. Museums are naturally in Athens, so you can check those out, though I tend to prefer just seeing the ruins themselves. 7. Aegina is the closest island to Athens, you can grab a ferry from Piraeus, currently fees are rising due to the season, but a normal fare would be approximately 16 euros return trip per person, assuming no car. The island's specialty is pistachio nuts, and they have a nice honey too. fish restaurants again are super popular there.  These are just my recommendations, but you get to see a lot of culture, food, history and of course, a chance for sun."
greece,3dkq9p,TurbanatorUK,4,Fri Jul 17 07:26:07 2015 UTC,"If you come from the northern states and have pale skin take lots of sunscreen with you!! Also carry some bottled water on you (500ml or 16,9oz at least). Make sure to try souvlaki and other dishes like mousaka etc. If you stay on Athens make sure to visit the Parthenon and the Acropolis museum.  Also in Athens use the metro! It is super clean and has many stops near areas visited by tourists. I would suggest that you take lots of cash with you but I've heard that banks will open on Monday but it doesn't hurt to carry a little bit extra on you just in case."

Beware of pickpockets in the metro. Beware of overly friendly strangers esp. if they are trying to convince you to visit a certain restaurant or bar (you won't be killed, just ripped off). Ignore people standing in front of their restaurants and being pushy as they try to rope you in. Just keep on walking unless you really do want to eat there. I'm sorry that they do this, it sucks. Best avoid any sort of political discussions with people, it's not worth the aggravation. Something I have heard from Americans who have never been out of the country, service in restaurants in Europe can be pretty impersonal and feel even rude sometimes. Don't be offended, it is not something to do with you in any way. I have also heard how people can be unnerved with how Greeks often just stare at them or are not very quick to smile. It is again just cultural, don't worry about it.  I know I make things sound grim, it's just a few things I have noticed from American friends and still, it just always depends on where from the US they are from, their age, culture etc. I'd be glad to help you with any definite destinations or things you would like to know."

greece,3dmjj3,pplswar,10,Fri Jul 17 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so, but he was foolish for not having such a Plan B in place. Basically, be prepared for anything. It's easy to say from here though.   ""SYRIZA suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of its EU creditors not because its leaders were outsmarted or out-chutzpah’d but because at every turn they were outgunned and outnumbered.""  Yup. This I can believe."
greece,3dmjj3,Divine2012,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"What plan b? Grexit? So if he had a plan B and executed it, everyone would have said that that was his intention all along. Like they do with Varoufakis."

greece,3dmjj3,joekerr37,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He should have struck a deal with the Troika back in March if he didn't have a Plan B in case negotiations went sour.   By playing extend and pretend with the creditors for 5 months he basically ruined what little was left of the country's economy, AND brought a third memorandum with more austerity and privatizations of national assets than ever."
greece,3dmjj3,SaiXx,7,Fri Jul 17 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments, I appreciate them.   Absolutely. He should have struck a deal with the Troika back in March if he didn't have a Plan B in case negotiations went sour.    Isn't this hindsight bias talking? I mean, was it clear back in February that things would drag on so long and end up so badly by July? Do you think Tsipras should've campaigned for a 'yes' vote in the referendum instead of 'no' so that this third memorandum could've been avoided?  I've heard Tsipras described as a 'gambler' politically and he gambled a lot by not seriously preparing for a Grexit and by going for a referendum. Now, if I was in his place, I think I would've encouraged a 'no' vote in parliament on the third memorandum and try, yet again, to get a better deal in conjunction with the IMF. The Greek people voted 'no' overwhelmingly despite the blackmail of the banks shutting down, so clearly the spirit of resistance hadn't been broken. I think Varoufakis wanted to resist in this manner also. But Tsipras didn't; he got tired of losing gambles (I guess) and he saw that the part 5 months had gotten him into even worse trouble and even more problems than he started with, so he quit fighting at the third memorandum."
greece,3dmjj3,SaiXx,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"How is it hindsight talking? Everyone who was following this story closely knew that he was running out of funds by June and that the creditors refused to give him any sort of breathing space months ago.  I believe you're giving him way too much credit, the truth is that he is neither a traitor nor a ""gambler"". He's just ridiculously naive. He even stated on national TV that he didn't believe that the EU would ""threaten"" the country with a Grexit because Merkel told him so. The very same Merkel that told him that she wouldn't ask Draghi to cut ELA support if he announced a referendum!  Varoufakis wanted to go for the virtual IOUs and take the creditors to court to prevent them from kicking the country out of the eurozone, thus keeping the euro as a parallel currency for exports/imports. Or something along these lines. A bold plan but the only viable one after all that had happened imo.   As for the referendum it was basically a miniature ""class war"", poor people and people who sympathize with them would have voted no as an act of defiance against the EU and its neo-liberal policies, regardless of whether Tsipras campaigned for it or not."
greece,3dmjj3,nouncommittee,3,Fri Jul 17 20:50:22 2015 UTC,Trying so hard to associate with Russia and rile Germany over issues like WW2 put Germany in the position that any concessions to Greece would be seen as a political defeat for Germany instead of a mutual agreement.
greece,3dmjj3,SaiXx,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and the meetings with Putin while the EU was proposing new sanctions on Russia kinda killed it. Had a centrist party won the latest elections and gone to Brussels the very next day and told them (behind the curtains) ""Look, our people can't take any more austerity at this moment, society is at the point where it might ""break"" could we work on something here?"" This all could have been averted.   This is why I think Tsipras should have gone with Varoufakis' plan instead, he decided to take the fight to the creditors, expose them for what they are and act all mighty and shit, you can't ""retreat"" after that and try to make nice with these people, you either go all out or you lose everything."

greece,3di10o,xNIBx,7,Thu Jul 16 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"O εταιρικός φόρος είναι κάτι περίεργο. Λες ότι πρέπει να είναι 10% ώστε να είμαστε πιο ανταγωνιστικοί. Το θέμα είναι ότι εάν όλες οι χώρες είναι 10%, τότε κανείς δεν κερδίζει(μόνο οι εταιρίες κερδίζουν). Δεν μπορείς να έχεις παντού χαμηλούς εταιρικούς φόρους. This only works for some countries exactly because it doesnt happen in all countries.  Και εάν πας καθυστερημένα να το παίξεις έξυπνος, κατεβάζοντας τον εταιρικό φόρο, τότε απλώς θα χάσεις. Δεν θα έρθει καμία νέα εταιρία και θα χάσεις και το έξτρα εισόδημα που είχες λόγω του αυξημένου προηγούμενου φόρου.  Πέρα του ότι η Ελλάδα είναι απείρως προβληματική χώρα για επενδύσεις(ανασφάλεια, έλλειψη σταθερότητας, γραφειοκρατεία, κλπ). Ακόμη και να μην είχαμε όλα αυτά τα προβλήματα, δεν θα δούλευε.

Ίσως η λύση να ήταν ένας variable φόρος αναλόγως με τον τύπο εταιρείας, τον τομέα, την περιοχή που επενδύει κλπ. ώστε να μπορείς να φέρεις μέσα εταιρείες και know how που δεν εχεις. Και δεν μιλάμε μόνο για ξένες εταιρείες αλλα και άλλες εσωτερικά που θες να βοηθήσεις σε βάθος χρόνων. Το σίγουρο ειναι οτι το ποσοστό φόρου ειναι μεγαλο για αυτο που παίρνεις πισω απο το κράτος. Ίσως πάνω απο όλα ειναι να μειώσεις το κόστος του κράτους και να το κανεις πιο efficient. Όλα μαλλον ξεκινάνε απο εκει."

Αρχικά μετά το 2012 είχαν πει ότι δε θα χρειαστεί άλλο κούρεμα. Μετά έβαλαν εκείνη την έκφραση σε μια άλλη συμφωνία το ίδιο έτος που άνοιγε τη δυνατότητα για μείωση χρέους αν υπήρχε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα. Μετά η δική μας κυβέρνηση άρχισε να μας κλείνει το μάτι ότι σύντομα θα γίνει. Τελικά δεν έγινε τίποτα και όταν ήρθε ο Σύριζα οι Ευρωπαίοι έλεγαν σε όλους τους τόνους ότι το χρέος είναι βιώσιμο.

Η εισαγωγή νέου νομίσματος επηρεάζει έμμεσα τη θεση των ιδιωτικών τραπεζών και της ΤτΕ, μόνο στο βαθμό που θα επηρεάσει τις ροές εσόδων του υποθηκευμένου ενεργητικού τους.     Το πρόβλημα έγκειται στη σύνθεση των ενεχύρων που κατέχει η ΕΚΤ από το Φεβρουάριο και, συγκεκριμένα, στη συμμετοχή του ελληνικού χρέους σε αυτά. Δε νομίζω ότι έχει δοθεί πειστική απάντηση ώστε να δικαιολoγηθεί το κούρεμά τους, ένα bail-out 25 δις (αρχικά), αλλά και πιθανό bail-in.  Πέρα από το παραπάνω ποσοτικό ζήτημα, υπάρχει και το ποιοτικό θέμα της φερεγγυότητας του ελληνικού δημοσίου και κατά πόσο έχει χρησιμοποιηθεί για να καλύψει πιθανές κεφαλαιακές αδυναμίες του ελληνικού τραπεζικού συστήματος.  Φυσικά είναι πολύ πιθανό να ισχύει και το αντίστροφο. Η εκτιμήσεις της ΕΚΤ περί του ελληνικού χρέους, ενδέχεται να έχουν συμπαρασύρει ένα υγιές τραπεζικό σύστημα.  Ανεξάρτητα από την αφετηρία, το αποτέλεσμα είναι παρόμοιο και ουδεμία τελική σχέση έχει με την πολιτική ή το δημοψήφισμα.

We're kind of scared to bring a lot of cash, but rumor has it that cash is king in Greece.    Cash. Small shops won't take cards. Also keep in mind that lines in ATM's are long, so beware.

greece,3dhqll,MrOaiki,3,Thu Jul 16 11:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think OP means:  if you can't get cash from the ATMs why not use, say, debit cards?  The answer has already been given:  while most places accept, enough don't.  Worst, and tantamount to extortion, is when they do take cards but state they only take cash.  This will change, hopefully as those who state they take cash get less, and those who take cards get more, business."
greece,3dhqll,Apapabo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:15:24 2015 UTC,"But why don't they start accepting it now? I mean, it must be better for business to accept cards if their customers currently can't pay for stuff at all."
greece,3dhqll,Apapabo,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, you are absolutely correct.  Take, for example, petrol stations.  They take cards, their accounts fill up with e-money, then they transfer that e-money to their suppliers (the refineries), and all is well with the world.  It's effectively non-cash transactions.  However, when you buy 1 kilo of tomatoes for 1 Euro, the charges of the debit card can be a substantial proportion of the total cost itself.  Then add to that the lack of actual paper currency in the system - ostensibly because there is an ""old school"" mentality of keeping cash readily to hand rather than in the bank - and you have a liquidity crisis.  Then add to that bank restrictions that disallow transfers of funds outside of the country except for required purchases like food, and you have a bigger problem.  Interestingly, I wonder about stories of grocery store shelves being empty ... large organisations such as Carrefour have sufficient cash reserves outside of Greece for this not to be a problem.  An alternative is ""liquidity investors"", those that use their cash outside of Greece to sell inside of Greece in return for equity ... but the problem then comes to repatriating dividends.  But the banking restrictions should end soon.  Back to the point, you are entirely correct, there's a certain insanity in those refusing to take cards.  ""Call the cops,"" I say."
greece,3dhqll,secret_magneticrobot,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"Cards are not widely accepted in Greek is my experience, I think it's because it makes it much harder for them to cheat on their taxes.

I personally do most of my daily shopping using my debit card, although I do keep cash available at all times. Only small stores don't accept them because depending on how they operate they need to have available cash to keep up stock etc. Back in the day many stores didn't like credit cards (even if they accepted them they still asked for cash) because there were substantial fees involved, I doubt that is the case any more though.

greece,3dhqll,pyrros,5,Thu Jul 16 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"Actual cash is a problem as well since capital controls were imposed. If more traders accepted cards and online payment and more consumers used these, things wouldn't be as bad. Obviously, the main problem is international payments.  The answer to the OP's question I think has to do with the fact that using non-cash payment methods hasn't been traditionally widespread in Greece and this is difficult to change overnight.

greece,3dhqll,TigerCIaw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:55:31 2015 UTC,"It is the printed paper that is a problem. Not liquidity par se, rather solvency but that's not really relevant because the credits being made between banks within a country do not call for the availability of funds in a traditional manner. They could use cards. Unless the bank X says ""we do not accept clearing from bank Y"". I doubt they would refuse it, given their current situation."

Just as your average depositor would prefer €60 cash to €60 in his bank account, so would the merchant.   The question then becomes, who blinks first? For stuff that hold value well and have low margins like gas, it's ""cash or GTFO"". For super-perishable and/ or high margin goods like hotel rooms and movie tickets, I expect people would take plastic no problem."

Τις προάλλες πήγα σε φορέα Υπουργείου απο τις 8 και ήταν μόνο μια υπάλληλος. Στις 9.30 ήρθαν οι άλλες δυο.  Το ίδιο πιστεύω θα συνέβη και στη λήξη του ωραρίου τους - που είμαι σίγουρος οτι θα έφυγαν 1 ώρα νωρίτερα.  Αν βγαίνει η δουλειά δεν με πειράζει γιατί και γω μπορεί να έκανα το ίδιο, απλά τονίζω οτι οι αριθμοί μπορεί να είναι στα χαρτιά και όχι πραγματικοί."
greece,3devst,StanfordV,3,Thu Jul 16 05:31:38 2015 UTC,"Αυτό που αναφέρεις είναι το ελαστικό ωράριο. Μετά από αίτηση του υπαλλήλου μπορεί να έρθει αργότερα από την κανονική προσέλευση στους χώρους εργασίας και να δουλέψει κανονικά το ωράριο του.  Αν το υπουργείο δεν έχει αρκετό προσωπικό τις πρώτες πρωινές ώρες είναι θέμα του προϊσταμένου ή του διευθυντή που δέχτηκε όλες τις αιτήσεις για το ελαστικό ωράριο.  Πριν από λίγα χρόνια, οι δημόσιοι υπάλληλοι την είχαν πολύ καθαρή στο να κάνουν αυτά που λες. Αλλά ήδη εδώ και 5 χρόνια δεν μπορούν να γίνουν, και όσες παραβάσεις βρεθούν υπάρχουν κυρώσεις. Πλέον υπάρχουν και ελεγκτές δημοσίων υπηρεσιών που ελέγχουν τέτοιες συμπεριφορές.  Το να αναπαράγουμε παλιές νοοτροπίες ως σημερινές είναι στην καλύτερη περίπτωση αφελές (στην χειρότερη κάτι πολύ κακό). Στο δημόσιο (και στον ευρύτερο δημόσιο τομέα), έχει αλλάξει εντυπωσιακά (ριζικά) το εργασιακό περιβάλλον. Έχει μειωθεί απίστευτα πολύ το προσωπικό (κυρίως λόγο συνταξιοδοτήσεων), έχουν μειωθεί απίστευτα τα εισοδήματα των δημοσίων υπαλλήλων (και δεν μιλάμε για τα πολιτικά πρόσωπα που γίνονται διοικητές), έχει αυξηθεί η εργασία που πρέπει να γίνει και οι υπερωρίες ουσιαστικά δεν πληρώνονται (μέσο του ενιαίου μισθολογίου οι υπερωρίες έχουν μικρότερες αποδοχές από το κανονικό ωρομίσθιο).  Μέσα από την εμπειρία μου, βλέπω ότι η δουλειά στο δημόσιο γίνεται εξουθενωτική πλέον (Κάποιες ΔΕΚΟ, Φορείς Κοινωνικής Ασφάλισης, Νοσοκομεία), υπάρχει απλήρωτη εργασία και πάρα πολύς φόρτος.  Το να συγκρίνουμε τον κακό ιδιωτικό τομέα σε σχέση με το δημόσιο δεν είναι σωστό, γιατί κάθε θεμελιωμένο δικαίωμα που διαγράφεται από το δημόσιο θα διαγράφεται εις διπλούν στον ιδιωτικό τομέα.  Παραδείγματα που μπορεί να δει ο καθένας!   Πήγατε στα ΚΕΠ κατά την διάρκεια του προγράμματος αντιμετώπισης ανθρωπιστικής κρίσης; Υπήρχε υπερβολικός φόρτος εργασίας και οι υπάλληλοι δούλευαν απλήρωτοι Σάββατο και Κυριακή για να καταφέρουν να συμπληρώσουν όλες τις αιτήσεις. Πήγατε σε νοσοκομείο μέσα τον τελευταίο χρόνο και να ρωτήσετε πόσες ώρες δουλεύουν οι νοσοκόμοι για πόσους ασθενής και με τι μισθό; Οι Γιατροί που κάνουν εφημερίες, ρωτήσατε πόσες πρέπει να κάνουν μέσα ένα μήνα; (να δείτε πως είναι η ζωή τους) και αν πληρώθηκαν; Είδατε στην ΓΓΔΕ, ΓΓΠΣ, ΗΔΙΚΑ κλπ που υπάρχουν τμήματα πληροφορικής που βγάζουν έργα εκατομμυρίων που είναι on-call 24/7, καταστρέφουν τις άδειες τους για να επιστρέψουν και δεν πληρώνονται για on-call;   Ναι, υπάρχουν ιδιωτικές εταιρίες που είναι χειρότερα από το δημόσιο. Αλλά πάντα θα υπάρχουν. Αν διαλύσουμε και άλλο τα εργασιακά δικαιώματα, αυτές οι εταιρίες θα γίνουν ακόμη χειρότερες. Οπότε ας μην αναπαράγουμε παρωχημένες πλέον παρατηρήσεις.  Και στις ιδιωτικές εταιρίες και στο δημόσιο (και στις δύο περιπτώσεις θα υπάρχουν λίγες εξαιρέσεις) τα εργασιακά δικαιώματα έχουν καταπατηθεί και η εργασία είναι πολύ δύσκολη. Δεν πρέπει να την κάνουμε δυσκολότερη...."

Μιας και το αναφέρεις, οι εφημερίες των γιατρών σε πολλές μονάδες είναι απλήρωτες απο το Δεκέμβρη του '14 (μετά εγιναν εκλογές).

Οικονομικών):   Υποστηρίζεται από τους ένθερμους υποστηριχτές της επιστροφής στη δραχμή ότι μια τέτοια επιλογή θα βελτιώσει την ανταγωνιστικότητα των ελληνικών προϊόντων. Το παρελθόν της χώρας – όπως και η θεωρία του διεθνούς εμπορίου – διαψεύδουν όμως αυτήν τη θέση. [...] Η  δραχμή λοιπόν κατά τη δεκαετία 1980-2000 απαξιώθηκε θεαματικά έναντι του δολαρίου ενώ οι εξαγωγές μας μετα βίας διπλασιάσθηκαν από 5,1 δις δολάρια σε 10,8 δις δολάρια. Από την άλλη το εμπορικό μας έλλειμμα άγγιξε τα 18,6 δις το 2000 από τα 5,4 δις δολάρια το 1980. Η κατακόρυφη απαξίωση του ελληνικού νομίσματος δεν κατόρθωσε λοιπόν να βελτιώσει την ανταγωνιστικότητα της ελληνικής οικονομίας, κάτι που διαφαίνεται και από τα ανωτέρω στοιχεία των εξαγωγών.  Αυτό σημαίνει ότι η όποια απαξίωση της νέας δραχμής έναντι του ευρώ θα ‘περάσει’ στην εγχώρια παραγωγή των προϊόντων της δεύτερης ομάδας (λόγω εισαγόμενου πληθωρισμού) και μέσω των πολλών εισαγόμενων και αναγκαίων πρώτων υλών. Η εν λόγω εξέλιξη αποτελεί σοβαρή αιτία πίεσης για νέα απαξίωση της δραχμής στη βραχυχρόνια περίοδο. Την ιστορία αυτή τη ζήσαμε ιδιαίτερα έντονα κατά το 1980-2000 χωρίς αποτέλεσμα σε όρους εμπορικού ισοζυγίου.  Οπότε, σύμφωνα με το πρόσφατο παρελθόν της χώρας μας, από πού πηγάζει η θέση ότι η επιστροφή στη δραχμή θα βελτιώσει την ανταγωνιστικότητα της ελληνικής οικονομίας;   EDIT: Επίσης,   Έτσι λοιπόν υπό καθεστώς σημαντικής απαξίωσης της δραχμής έναντι του δολαρίου και όλων των υπόλοιπων νομισμάτων (για είκοσι χρόνια) οι εξαγωγές μας μετά βίας διπλασιάσθηκαν, ενώ επί ευρώ, υπερδιπλασιάσθηκαν μέσα σε οκτώ χρόνια."

Το παρελθόν της χώρας – όπως και η θεωρία του διεθνούς εμπορίου – διαψεύδουν όμως αυτήν τη θέση. [...] Η δραχμή λοιπόν κατά τη δεκαετία 1980-2000 απαξιώθηκε θεαματικά έναντι του δολαρίου ενώ οι εξαγωγές μας μετα βίας διπλασιάσθηκαν από 5,1 δις δολάρια σε 10,8 δις δολάρια.

Οπότε, σύμφωνα με το πρόσφατο παρελθόν της χώρας μας, από πού πηγάζει η θέση ότι η επιστροφή στη δραχμή θα βελτιώσει την ανταγωνιστικότητα της ελληνικής οικονομίας;"
greece,3dctwe,pilgrimcaulfield,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"Α απλώς διπλασιάστηκαν οι εξαγωγές; Οκ, τίποτα σημαντικό τότε. Όσο για το εμπορικό έλλειμμα, απλώς να πω ότι όλα αυτά τα χρόνια αποδυναμώθηκαν οι εγχώριες βιομηχανίες/βιοτεχνίες γιατί κάναμε όλο και περισσότερες εμπορικές συμφωνίες(ελεύθερο εμπόριο, κατάργηση του protectionism) με Ευρώπη και Αμερική. Επίσης μεγάλωνε ο πλούτος των ελλήνων και αυξανόταν η πρόσβαση στα φτηνά δάνεια(γιατί θα μπαίναμε στο ευρώ και άρα τα επιτόκια πέφτανε προκαταβολικά γιατί υπήρχε σύγκλιση με το γερμανικό), άρα μεγάλωνε η κατανάλωση εισαγόμενων προϊόντων.  Προφανώς και αυξήθηκε το εμπορικό έλλειμμα. Εσύ διαφωνείς ότι εάν πάμε σε δραχμή   Θα αυξηθούν οι εξαγωγές/τουρισμός Θα μειωθούν οι εισαγωγές(άρα θα μειωθεί το εμπορικό έλλειμμα)   Προφανώς αυτά δεν θα συμβούν την επόμενη μέρα. Όπως είπα τα πρώτα 2-3 χρόνια θα είναι εφιαλτικά. Θα μειωθεί ο τουρισμός λόγω της αστάθειας και του φόβου, κλπ. Θα πρέπει να βγει νέο νόμισμα(νομίσματα;), θα πρέπει να προσαρμοστεί η αγροτική παραγωγή για τις ελληνικές ανάγκες(τώρα είναι σχεδιασμένη με βάση την ευρωπαϊκή αγροτική πολιτική) και θα πρέπει γενικά η ελληνική οικονομία να αλλάξει.   Πχ έλεγε ο Μπουτάρης(κρασιά), ότι ναι μεν με τη δραχμή θα έχει φτηνότερα σταφύλια και εργατικό κόστος αλλά τα μπουκάλια τα κάνει εισαγωγή από Ισπανία και αυτά θα ανέβουν σε κόστος εάν πάμε σε δραχμή. Άρα θα πρέπει να προσαρμοστεί και να παίρνει ελληνικά μπουκάλια(και θα πρέπει να παραχθούν ελληνικά μπουκάλια).  Να θυμίσω ότι τα τελευταία 15 χρόνια έχουν κλείσει άπειρες ελληνικές βιομηχανίες/βιοτεχνίες γιατί δεν ήταν ανταγωνιστικές. Τώρα θα είναι. Τώρα από ανάγκη(και ίσως και από κυβερνητικό σχεδιασμό, αν και δεν περιμένω πολλά από τη κυβέρνηση), θα ξαναφτιαχτούν. Θα πάει ο Μπουτάρης πχ και θα πιάσει 4-5 ακόμη που κάνουν κρασιά και θα τους πει ""δεν φτιάχνουμε εμείς τα μπουκάλια εδώ;"". Η ανάγκη είναι η μητέρα της επινόησης.  Ένα άλλο παράδειγμα. Η Ελλάδα έχει σχετικά καλή φαρμακοβιομηχανία. Εφόσον τα εισαγώμενα φάρμακα θα είναι πανάκριβα, θα πρέπει να χρησιμοποιούμε γενόσημα. Άρα θα ανέβει και η ελληνική φαρμακοβιομηχανία. Δεν θα είναι όλα τέλεια. Αρκετά φάρμακα δεν έχουν γενόσημα και θα υπάρχουν ελλείψεις. Αν και προφανώς η ελληνική κυβέρνηση θα δώσει έμφαση στα φάρμακα, καύσιμα και ανταλλακτικά όσον αφορά τις εισαγωγές(και τη χρησιμοποίηση των μικρών αποθεματικών ξένων νομισμάτων που θα έχουμε).  Θέλεις μερικά χρόνια για να γίνουν αυτά και μετά θα πρέπει να ηρεμήσουν τα πράγματα, θα έρθει μια σχετική σταθερότητα. Ο τουρισμός και οι εξαγωγές θα αυξάνονται σταθερά, θα φτάσουν και θα ξεπεράσουν τα τωρινά επίπεδα(σε βάθος 10ετίας). Αυτό είναι το πιο πιθανό σενάριο σε περίπτωση grexit.  Και θα μου πεις ""Μα καλά, θέλεις να περάσεις 10-15 χρόνια για να φτάσεις στην καλύτερη στα τωρινά επίπεδα;"", ναι το θέλεις. Γιατί ο τωρινός ορίζοντας σε πάει προς στον πάτο. Μπορεί να είσαι ""οκ"" τώρα(με 25% ανεργία, λολ), αλλά σταδιακά θα γίνεσαι χειρότερα. Και δεν υπάρχει φως στο τέλος του τούνελ. Μακάρι να κάνω λάθος. Μακάρι να αλλάξουν οι πολιτικές και οι αντιλήψεις των ευρωπαίων(συμπεριλαμβάνω και εμάς). Αλλά δεν το θεωρώ πιθανό αυτό. Δεν θεωρώ ότι μπορεί να δουλέψει το ευρώ χωρίς πολιτική και δημοσιονομική ένωση. Και δεν είναι έτοιμη η Ευρώπη για κάτι τέτοιο.  Το ευρώ φτιάχτηκε για να φέρει κοντά τους ευρωπαϊκούς λαούς(και κυρίως την Γαλλία με τη Γερμανία ώστε να αποτραπεί 3ος ΠΠ) και να βάλει τις βάσεις για μια στενότερη πολιτική ένωση.

greece,3da4vw,Agilaz,5,Tue Jul 14 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is incorrect. Say what you want about the current German administration, but the average German is certainly better off than some 10-12 years ago, and have had their share of Germany's success.  Germany does have some issues at the margins, namely: Wealth is increasingly unevenly distributed, there is a base of largely unskilled long term unemployed for which there is little prospect, and there are huge regional differences in economic success in Germany.   However, the average German still enjoys record low unemployment, record low youth unemployment, rising wages, a functioning welfare state, free quality education, excellent public services and bureaucracy, low cost of living, and little reason to fear this is going to change any time soon.   The federal government is in the luxurious position to be able to forgo taking any loans even at essentially 0% interest - and being able to do that while still wasting money on expensive social programs of dubious value.   There is lots that could be run better and I personally have plenty ideas what I would do different than the current administration.

A little fear is a pretty useful tool, too. There are a lot of people who think in a competitive way (us vs them mentality) so nationalist parties are on the rise. I don't think there is a single reason but a pool of them, but by far the most ridiculous thing to me is, that there is a left wing majority, but the second biggest party, the SPD (former worker party, but their politics have shifted away from their original ideas), didn't want a coalition with ""Der Linken"". Instead they formed a big coalition with the right wing party leaving the opposition so little that can barely have an impact on anything. So even though the majority of Germany's population voted for a party on the left, the politic is dominated by the right wing CDU."

I have absolutely heard Greeks moaning in private about how they hate maintaining the ""no problem"" attitude to Germans who they perceive as very high maintenance tourists wont to make unreasonable demands and expecting special treatment. I've even heard Greeks say that they feel some German tourists treat the Greeks as an underclass. I wont say it is universal, and the Greeks are very careful to hide their disdain from paying customers, but there can be a difference between the public and the private."

But no, I don't think that most Greeks have negative feelings towards modern Germany.

It's unbelievable (and sad) to see how dire the situation in a European country has become, but on the other hand you can't give out free money - what would Italy or Spain have to say about that, why would they bother taking on further painful reforms if Greece is just being saved? What I do blame Greek politicians for is the tone they introduced into the negotiations. I know, it's a highly emotional topic, but as a politician you shouldn't talk about other European politicians (who you rely on to help you) the way Greek politicians did.   Honestly, I don't believe there's a right or a wrong decision. Time will tell how this situation turns out."

They are not obliged to keep sending money down the bottomless hole that is the Greek state, and in fact they don't even have the moral right to do that. That money represents effort of honest people being given to perpetuate the lifestyles of crooks in the Greek public sector.  Finally giving us that loan (instead of Grexit, as Schauble wanted) will hurt Greek democracy in the long run, because again it'll be the Greek statists and fascists that will benefit from it.   The title pretty much says it all, it sickens me to see how our politicians and media treats your country and your democracy.   It sickens me how Greek politicians and Greek media treat your country and your democracy, and how they treat our country and our democracy too.   The list of what the EU financial ministers want is a joke and all it does is humiliate   It also provides 80 billion euros, but that's just trivialities, eh?"

So rapid investment came in with initial euro hype, which broke up the local economy.  Then resession came, capitals run away, and people were just left jobless.  Isn't this a story? I guess blaming each other is wrong.   It's just how economics works when it works badly, but not much cultural problem. You don't have to see things narrowly, I guess."

Κι εγώ αυτή την απορία έχω. Το όλο του σχέδιο ήταν ότι αν έφτανε η κατάσταση στα άκρα τότε θα έφτανε η ώρα της κρίσης και οι πιο ψύχραιμες και λογικές φωνές θα εισακούγονταν. Το γεγονός ότι φτάσαμε εδώ που φτάσαμε δείχνει ότι αυτός ο υπολογισμός μπορεί να ήταν αφελής.   Ο Σόιμπλε κυκλοφορεί αυτο το σχέδιο για εκδίωξη της Ελλάδας από το ευρώ. Αποτελεί κατά τη γνώμη μου ευθεία απάντηση στη στρατηγική που δημόσια ο Βαρουφάκης διαφημίζει τόσα χρόνια. Είναι σα να του λέει   ""Τι; νομίζετε θα φοβηθούμε αν φτάσετε στο χείλος του γκρεμού; Όχι βέβαια, πηδήξτε! Ορίστε, θα ξεκινήσω κιόλας τις διαδικασίες. Μήπως θέλετε ένα σπρωξιματάκι να βοηθήσω;""  Δε ξέρουμε κατά πόσο μπλοφάρει ο Σόιμπλε ή όχι αλλά σε κάθε περίπτωση ο Βαρουφάκης οφείλει να παραδεχτεί ότι το σχέδιό του οδηγεί σε δραχμή με αρκετά μεγάλη πιθανότητα.   Από την άλλη μεριά ακόμα και να μη μπλοφάρει ο Σόιμπλε, αυτή η διαπραγματευτική τακτική βάζει τους υπόλοιπους σε ένα δύσκολο δίλημμα. Είτε θα πρέπει να ακολουθήσουν τη γραμμή Σόιμπλε με όλα τα ρίσκα για την ΕΕ που αυτή συνεπάγεται, είτε να απομονώσουν τον Σόιμπλε και να πάρουν το πλευρό των Ελλήνων.   Από αυτήν την άποψη φαίνεται να δημιουργούνται δύο διαφορετικά μέτωπα. Ένα είναι το επίπεδο intergovernmental governance της ΕΕ το οποίο φαινομενικά ακολουθεί τη γραμμή Σόιμπλε. Ένα άλλο επίπεδο είναι αυτό της κοινής γνώμης, ΜΜΕ, ΔΝΤ και κάποιων άλλων παραγόντων που φαίνεται να απομονώνουν τη γραμμή Σόιμπλε. Το πώς θα αλληλεπιδράσουν αυτά τα δύο μέτωπα είναι κάτι άγνωστο προς το παρόν.   Εδιτ: Το πιο ενδιαφέρον είναι ότι βλέπεις τους ίδιους ανθρώπους, ανάλογα σε ποιο από τα δύο μέτωπα βρίσκονται ανά πάσα στιγμή να υιοθετούν διαφορετική ρητορική. Στο πρώτο επίπεδο οι προτάσεις Σόιμπλε έπεσαν στο τραπέζι και συζητήθηκαν κανονικά και σχεδόν μέχρι το τέλος. Στο δεύτερο επίπεδο έχεις τον Ολλάντ, Ρέντζι, Φάυνμαν κλπ να βρίζουν τον Σόιμπλε άγρια. Ομοίως το ΔΝΤ: μέσα στις διαπραγματεύσεις στο Eurogroup και στις συνόδους κορυφής (το πρώτο επίπεδο) προσυπογράφει τις φαντασίες για βιώσιμο χρέος. Και όταν βγαίνει έξω (δεύτερο επίπεδο) δίνει στη δημοσιότητα χαρτιά που βρίζουν αυτό το ιδιο πρόγραμμα και τη συμφωνία. Τρέλα."
greece,3dbvd2,HollowThief,0,Wed Jul 15 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"Γιατί αν το πας μόνο με το ποιο αποτέλεσμα σου είναι διαθέσιμο εξ αρχής είσαι αποκλεισμένος εξ αρχής. Τι νόημα έχει η διαπραγμάτευση αν θα δεχτείς ότι υπάρχουν μόνο αυτά τα όρια κ άρα δε μπορείς να πας παραπέρα?  Η όλη λογική ήταν να δοκιμάσει τα όρια ( κ φυσικά να δουν αν όντως η Ελλάδα μπορεί να κάνει τη δική της προσπάθεια μόνη της με πρόσβαση στα πλήρη στοιχεία).  Αν δεν είσαι κυβέρνηση δεν ξέρεις πραγματικά τι λεφτά υπάρχουν κ που, μην κοροϊδευόμαστε είναι σκατά το σύστημα από θέμα διαφάνειας.  Οπότε   1) μπαίνεις με στόχο να δημιουργήσεις λύσεις, όχι να αποδεχθείς το ήδη υπάρχον πλαίσιο  2) δεν ξέρεις όντως τις δυνατότητες της χώρας αν δεν είσαι κυβέρνηση  Οπότε μπαίνοντας μέσα κ επειδή ξέρεις τι σε περιμένει απέναντι ο στόχος σου είναι   1) διάσπαση του μετώπου των δανειστών - αναδεικνύεις τις διαφορές τους κ σταματάς να υπηρετείς τρεις ατζέντες.  2) δημοσιοποίηση του προβλήματος - το δίκιο του ισχυρού είναι πολύ δυνατό χαρτί, μέχρι να το ξεσκεπάσεις κ να δείξεις την αδικία.   Όταν ο εκβιασμός γίνεται δημόσιος αποκτάς στήριξη - η κλάψα που λένε μερικοί. Εδώ είναι Ευρώπη, όχι Κίνα. Κ οι Ευρωπαίοι δε θέλουν να είναι Κινέζοι. Το πας στα άκρα για να το πάνε στα άκρα κ να δείξουν πραγματικά πως το βλέπουν. Ο Σόιμπλε κατέληξε να παραδεχτεί ότι όντως έτσι είναι, αλλά δε θα γίνει γιατί έτσι.  3) ώθηση για λύση σε πολιτικό επίπεδο - πρακτικά αν συνέχεια έχεις πρόβλημα με το να πείσεις τα τεχνικά κλιμάκια, πρέπει να πας κ τη συζήτηση κ τη λύση σε πολιτικό επίπεδο για να ξεπεράσεις τους τεχνοκράτες.  Το πρόβλημα προφανώς με τη δραχμή δεν είναι ούτε τεχνικό, ούτε πολιτικό, αλλά πρακτικό: δεν υπάρχει αρκετό χρήμα κ δεν είναι υπόθεση 1-2 χρόνων . Συν το ότι με τέτοια συμπεριφορά δε μιλάμε για ουδέτερη Ευρώπη, αλλά για εχθρική Ευρώπη που κ πάλι θα χρησιμοποιήσει την Ελλάδα σαν μαύρο πρόβατο. Δεν υπήρχε στήριξη για τέτοιο εγχείρημα από έξω κ γενικά προφανώς η Ελλάδα δεν είναι έτοιμη να αντιμετωπίσει κάτι τέτοιο, αν ήταν θα την είχαν κάνει. Πράγμα φυσικά που ήξεραν οι προηγούμενοι γιατί την έχουν ξεσκίσει την Ελλάδα οι ίδιοι, οπότε δε μπορούσαν ούτε πολιτικά να μπλοφάρουν, αλλά κ πρακτικά.   Αυτό ο Σόιμπλε το ήξερε ή το υποπτευόταν, δεν έχει σημασία, είναι σε πιο ισχυρή θέση. Ο Τσίπρας αποφάσισε να το μαζέψει μετά το όχι, γιατί θεώρησε ότι από αυτή τη θέση η διαλλακτικότητα θα ήταν δείγμα ότι είμαστε ακόμα στο τραπέζι, το μόνο που αποκάλυψε ήταν ότι 100% η Ελλάδα δεν είναι έτοιμη για έξοδο - εξ ου κ το πήδημα.  Κ εδώ πάμε στο Βαρουφάκη.  Ο Βαρουφάκης ήθελε να το συνεχίσει - κ είπε συγκεκριμένα - να εκδώσουμε IOU ή να πούμε ότι θα εκδώσουμε (το οποίο έχει παρόμοιο αποτέλεσμα, χωρίς τις ίδιες συνέπειες). Δηλαδή ο Βαρουφάκης πρότεινε escalation της μπλόφας κ ο Τσίπρας διάλεξε να σταματήσει το παιχνίδι. Όχι γιατί δεν είχε τη στήριξη του λαού, αλλά γιατί προφανώς η Ελλάδα θα φάει πακέτο εκτός ευρώ, οπότε ήθελε να πάει στο τραπέζι έχοντας τη στήριξη του λαού, να φαίνεται έστω λίγο δυνατός.  Πολλοί θα πουν ότι άρα τζάμπα η μπλόφα κ γιατί δεν υπογράφαμε εξ αρχής, όπως λες εσύ για πριν το δημοψήφισμα.  Οι διαφορές είναι δύο κυρίως:  1) ο κόσμος δε μπορούσε άλλο χωρίς να ξέρει ότι όντως δε παίζει άλλος τρόπος, όταν όλοι όσοι έχουν διαπραγματευτεί είναι διαπλεκόμενοι δε μπορείς να εμπιστευτείς ότι πήραν το καλύτερο deal, γιατί πολύ απλά σε γάμαγαν τόσα χρόνια. Κ φυσικά όταν βλέπεις αίσχη όπως αύξηση φορολόγησης στα χαμηλά εισοδήματα 93% κ στα υψηλά 16%, έχει παιχτεί πουστιά.  2) μπορεί να μην είναι νίκη, αλλά κάποια από τα πιο πάνω σημεία όντως τονίστηκαν κ μπορεί ακόμα κ στο σύντομο μέλλον να υπάρξει αλλαγή. Είναι ξεκάθαρο ότι άμα απλά δέχεσαι ότι σου λένε δεν υπάρχει περίπτωση να δοθεί δεύτερη σκέψη, δε χρειάζεται, όταν όλος ο πλανήτης όμως βλέπει το ΌΧΙ με 22% μπροστά καταλαβαίνει ότι κάτι δεν πάει καλά. Έτσι τώρα μιλάμε για ΕΣΠΑ 100% από Ευρώπη στην Κομισιόν. Παίρνουν αέρα κ άλλα κόμματα κ άλλες φωνές.  Οι βασικοί στόχοι της αναδιάρθρωσης δεν έχουν ακόμα κλείσει, αν γίνει μια της προκοπής θα είναι νίκη. Γιατί χωρίς πίεση, αποδεχόμενοι τους πλεονασματικούς στόχους, ουσιαστικά βγάζαμε το χρέος βιώσιμο κ πρακτικά δεν είναι.  Όταν έχεις κόσμο που το μόνο που κάνει είναι να φεύγει κ να ψάχνει πως θα φύγει έχει γίνει τρελή ζημιά.   Γενικά αυτή η μάχη δεν είχε δοθεί μέχρι σήμερα κ όποιος λέει καλύτερα να μην είχε δοθεί τον φαντάζομαι να βιάζεται κατ εξακολούθηση κ να μην αντιστέκεται μπας κ θυμώσει ο βιαστής. ΌΧΙ ρε φίλε μια προσπάθεια αντίστασης, ακόμα κ αν δεν έχουμε συνάλλαγμα, ακόμα κ αν είμαστε η πιο φτωχή χώρα πρέπει να γίνει. Να φανούν τα τρωτά σημεία, να γίνει μια κίνηση. Δε γίνεται 5 χώρες να το τρώνε ασύστολα κ να μην κάνουν τίποτα, έστω να φέρουν το όπλο στο δικό τους κεφάλι.  Μην ξεχνάμε ότι έχουν μπει άλλες τόσες χώρες. Όλες φτωχές. Όλες θα δουν πως θα τους βγει το ευρώ κ σε περίπου 5 χρόνια θα τραβάνε τα ίδια, γιατί όποιος ακόμα νομίζει ότι το χρέος είναι πρόβλημα μόνο της Ελλάδας είναι απλά απληροφόρητος."

Δυστυχώς η δημοκρατία έχει υποβαθμιστεί σημαντικά στη χώρα μας. Αυτοί που εκλέγουμε πλέον δεν έχουν τη δύναμη να κυβερνήσουν, παρά μόνο να διαχειριστούν μια κατάσταση που συνεχώς επιδεινώνεται. Φυσικά οι εκλογές δεν θα σταματήσουν, για να κρατηθούν τα προσχήματα της δημοκρατίας. Αλλά γίνεται εμφανές (και από τους όρους που αναφέρεις περί ξένων παρεμβάσεων στο νομοθετικό έργο) ότι η Ελλάδα δεν ανήκει πλέον στους Έλληνες (τουλάχιστον στα χαρτιά). Είναι λυπηρό φυσικά.  Αυτό που γίνεται μέρα με τη μέρα είναι η αποδόμηση ενός κράτους και η σταδιακή μεταφορά εξουσίας στους ξένους. Το “σταδιακή” είναι ο όρος κλειδί. Δεν πρέπει να ξυπνήσουν ούτε τα πατριωτικά, ούτε τα δημοκρατικά αισθήματα των πολιτών γιατί θα κάνει το έργο τους δυσκολότερο. Επομένως έχουν βρει μια φόρμουλα ώστε να γίνεται αυτό με τον κατάλληλο ρυθμό που γίνεται ανεκτός. Το επόμενο βήμα είναι πάντα μόνο ελαφρώς χειρότερο από το προηγούμενο, ώστε να είναι ευκολόπεπτο (η ψυχολογία του “εδώ που φτάσαμε τώρα, ας κάνουμε και το τάδε”). Αλλά όταν κοιτάξεις πίσω λίγο μακρύτερα (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 χρόνια) βλέπεις φανερά το κακό που γίνεται. Η αναλογία είναι το βατράχι που σιγοβράζεται, για να μην πηδήξει έξω από την κατσαρόλα.  Θα διαφωνήσω μόνο σε ένα μαζί σου. Είπες “Οι δανειστές, μοιάζει λογικό, θέλουν να εξασφαλίσουν την οικονομία μας, και μέσω ημών, να εξασφαλίσουν και την επένδυσή τους.”  Δεν είναι ο στόχος τους να εξασφαλίσουν την οικονομία. Ο στόχος τους είναι να σε κατακτήσουν. Το ότι οι στόχοι που βάζουν είναι άπιαστοι δεν είναι τυχαίο, είναι μαθηματική ακρίβεια. Βλάκες δεν είναι, έχουν σχέδιο. Ένα 10χρονο μπορεί να καταλάβει ότι όταν δανείζεσαι από τον Α για να ξεπληρώσεις παλαιότερα δάνεια του Α, δεν θα ξεπληρώσεις ποτέ.  Δεν αργεί ο καιρός που οι ξένοι/δανειστές θα σου πουν ότι δεν χρειάζεσαι στρατό. Φυσικά θα γίνει λίγο λίγο, με μειώσεις προσωπικού, δαπανών, αλλαγές νομοθεσίας κλπ κλπ. Θα σου πουν ότι θα σε προστατέψουν αυτοί αν χρειαστεί κάτι. Θα βρουν και φωνές στο εσωτερικό να τους υποστηρίξουν, στο όνομα της οικονομίας, της Ευρώπης που πάνε να χτίσουν, τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες Ευρώπης. Ο στρατός θα είναι το τελευταίο απομεινάρι του “κυρίαρχου” κράτους.  Το όλο θέμα δεν έχει τελειώσει ακόμα. Υπάρχει αυτό που λέγεται “σημείο χωρίς γυρισμό” (point of no return). Δεν το έχουμε περάσει ακόμα, αλλά πλησιάζουμε. Ο χρόνος δεν είναι με το μέρος μας."
greece,3dcp8p,cool_hand_legolas,5,Wed Jul 15 06:13:47 2015 UTC,"Is it true that camping is forbidden but there are still a few places for what we call here ""free camping"".  Donousa island, Livadia beach, an isolated beautiful beach, a lot of free campers  there make a nice community (i might be there in a few days)  Anafi, roukounas beach, the most well konwn free camper's spot.  Kato koufonisia, really beatifull beach, live like a castaway...  I know also a spot in Amorgos but i dont remeber the name...  I have seen a lot of people camping freely in cyclades in many islands but there is always the risk of geting caught. Just find a quiet place away from anything especially hotels because those people are the ones who call the police. Feel free to ask for details."
greece,3dcp8p,tbousiou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:59:21 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply.   Lividia beach sounds really cool, and so do the others. Are they easy to get to by ferry? Should I be worried about the ferries selling out? The wind sounds really challenging- are these places a bit sheltered?  Maybe it's obvious but I'm trying to do this on the cheap, a bit of quiet and also a bit of partying. Thanks for all your help!"
greece,3dcp8p,vagara,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:06:13 2015 UTC,Personal experience for Roukounas - Anafi. Half of the beach is nudist beach. The community has build public showers and bathrooms. I think a ship goes there twice a week but I am not so sure. Once a week certainly. There is a restaurant there and the owner has some rooms for rent if needed but they are not that many rooms. During July and August the beach is filled with tents. The beach is fantastic and the place is almost away from civilization. It might be too quiet for some tastes. If that is what you want then I recommend it highly.
greece,3dcp8p,merhandus,4,Wed Jul 15 18:54:36 2015 UTC,"Free camping unfortunately on most islands will get you into trouble, i have seen cases of the coast guard coming and fining you for setting your tent.  I used to free camp a lot in Evia but even there you could run into some issues.  But lets say you manage to find a place to set up nice and cozy with no legal issues, let me offer some advice.  Tent on Cyclades on summer is like flying a kite on cape horn.  Its windy and when i say windy i mean lots of wind, you should by no means stay on a beach facing north, we used to have a saying in Tinos that the wind will take it to Syra ( Syros )."

greece,3daexl,sherlock234,3,Wed Jul 15 08:45:47 2015 UTC,"Έχω, και με απέλυσαν (και καλά έκαναν).  Το πρόβλημα με τις απεργίες στην Ελλάδα είναι η απουσία δυνατότητας απόλυσης.  Αν δουλεύεις για μένα έχεις το κάθε δικαίωμα να ζητήσεις ΟΤΙ γουστάρεις. Αλλά πρέπει να έχω κι εγώ το δικαίωμα να ζυγίσω το τί ζητάς με το τί προσφέρεις.  Με το υπάρχον σύστημα έχουμε την εξής ανωμαλία: κάνει απεργία ο εργαζόμενος, δεν του δίνει ο εργοδότης τίποτα, και ο εργαζόμενος συνεχίζει να δουλεύει.

Οι απεργίες γίνονται ή για να αντισταθούν σε κάποια άλλαγη που θα επέλθει (είτε αυτή είναι απόλυση 1000 εργαζομένων είτε τετράγωνη-τρίγωνη τυρόπιτα) ή για να ασκηθεί πίεση στον εργοδότη ώστε να πραγματοποιήσει μια αλλαγή.

Μάντεψε ποιό από τα αυτά επικροτούν και ποιό κατακρίνουν οι ευσυνείδητοι απεργοί.   Δεν νομίζω ότι υπάρχει εργαζόμενος αυτήν την στιγμή που δεν γουστάρει αυτό που κάνει, καθώς δεν έχει τη δυνατότητα να κάνει αλλιώς (με την ανεργία στο 26%), αλλά αυτό δεν σημαίνει ότι δεν πρέπει να συμμετέχει σε πολιτικές πράξεις (που του είναι επιζήμιες στο μισθό) επειδή διακόπτει μια ανίκανη-για-ανάπτυξη παραγωγή."

How does Merkel live with herself."

greece,3d8zgt,ibrokedown,12,Tue Jul 14 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"This deal just delays the grexit that will 100% happen in a couple years. But Merkel doesnt care because she wouldnt be the one who made eurozone smaller, it will be her successor.  And to make things worse, this deal will destroy the greek economy even more and make the grexit even worse. But i feel it is necessary in order to persuade the greek people about the grexit and show the rest of the europeans what this union means. Everyone saw the real face of eurozone and everyone can decide whether they want to be part of this or not."

greece,3d8zgt,thatwasnotmeyo,4,Tue Jul 14 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"I blame them both. But Tsipras had no power over how the deal would go. It was Merkel who dictated the offer. And the proposal is bad because of Merkel. Tsipras preferred a terrible offer over a catastrophic grexit. Personally i think that a catastrophic grexit is preferable. Not because it will be better immediately, shit will be fucked beyond belief for the first 2-3 years, but it will give Greece a better prospect for the future.  The only good thing about this proposal is that it should persuade even more greeks how fucked up eurozone is. When you are not wanted in a union and when 1 country controls the union, then it isnt a union. It is a toxic bond that just deteriorates relationships between countries and destroys economies."
greece,3d8zgt,xNIBx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"So just to sum it up. You say a grexit later will be even worse but the bailout out now is better than a grexit but still complete shit. I hope you know that there were a lot of other countrys that wanted a grexit and are opposed to any kind of bailouts for greece no matter the reforms. Also i can assure you that most nations would have said something if they did not agree with germany. the only countrys who actually said something said they want a grexit now. From that perspective you now have to decide if it is still germans fault because they gave them money as you seem to think germany decides alone, or if they were on the right side by giving the money opposed to a grexit.  But i have a feeling it does not matter, no matter what would have happened you would blame germany anyway."

greece,3d8zgt,badassmthrfkr,10,Tue Jul 14 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"It's not because of the past two weeks that Greece is going to need massive debt relief to get back on it's feet. That is the reality of the situation- these debts are unsustainable. Why is that so hard for you and others to understand? The US could have kept Germany under our thumb and forced them to pay back their debts but it realized humiliating a people and taking away all their hope is a recipe for disaster. Merkel, and her supporters, are either ignorant as to what Greece is facing or they just don't care and their ignorant of what was done for Germany that allowed their economic turnaround. Shameful."
greece,3d8zgt,DineLointHarpie,0,Tue Jul 14 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"No doubt the debts are unsustainable, but so is the government.  Even if all the debt is forgiven today, Greece can't function without a constant stream of new loans.  And do you trust the Greek government to go through major reforms by themselves without outside pressure? Other EZ nations certainly didn't.  Syriza's negotiation tactic was ridiculous: They basically tore up the terms and conditions of the previous loans and told the lenders they were stupid, the previous loans need to be erased, and they need more loans with no strings attached this time.  And it was almost as if they were trying their hardest to piss off their lendors and erode any trust they had.  The better way to negotiate would have been honoring the previous deals, implement all the requested reforms, and talk to them in a more amicable manner."

I understand your sentiment, but get your facts straight please. Yes, there is a perception in Germany that Greece (not the Greek people: Greece as a country and political class) do not work hard enough towards a solution. Still, Merkel, Schaeuble and all other serious politicians remained relatively calm in their wording and took extreme caution not to fuel such sentiments directly. Regardless of the opinions, the Greek leadership was always referred to respectfully.  If you contrast that with all the ""funny"" portrayals of those very guys in Nazi uniforms in the press and references to... ""Fourth Reich"", it is not the German political class who were spreading insult. And BTW -- most other Europeans do not realize how sensitive Germans are to Nazi references.  I understand the political ""culture"" in Greece may be more permissive to insult, but don't assume this is the same in Germany.   The people voted against austerity   And I will vote myself rich."

greece,3d8m06,ferongr,8,Tue Jul 14 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"The US recently handed Siemens and other companies some stiff fines ($2.5bn US) for engaging in bribery in third party nations. That's US laws that forbid a company from engaging in ""corrupt practices"" anywhere in the world. Since 2010 there is a similar law in UK.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act  For UK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery_Act_2010  International law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Anti-Bribery_Convention  These laws are highly unpopular with corporations, but one of the few cases where they can't exercise direct opposition, since lobbying against it means being in favor of bribery. The greater difficulty is bringing these proposals to the table, but once raised they would tend to pass with broad approval (no parliamentarian wants to be labeled as in favor of bribery).  So any company that's been proven to engage in bribery in Greece should face stiff fines in the US and several EU countries (signatories of the OECD anti-bribery convention), even if the Greek justice system is unable to do that themselves."
greece,3d8m06,vrrrrrr,2,Tue Jul 14 13:02:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, the law in the EU states that any company who bribed to gain a public contract should be ousted from any public contract precedure in the future.

Likewise, most Greek pensioner are not the same as the Greek billionnaire, or a Greek government officer.   Still, following your logic:   Germany gives Greece credit. ELI5: Greece takes money and obliges to pay it back with interest later. Greece uses this money to buy products from Germany, still keeping the obligation.  After a few installments, Greece does not pay back.   In the end:   products transferred from Germany to Greece with no compensation Greece complains about the monstrous German lenders   Can you now understand why Germany doesn't like it?"

You were the mafia and Greece was the idiot in need, what you are doing is instead of understanding how retarded you have been, you want to put cement shoes on Greece, make her sink, so that the rest of Europe stays in line.  Exactly like the mafia. Oh it also works on another level, a lot of the money you loaned was spent to buy 'protection', aka weapons from Germany.  The mafia might kill Greece, it might break it's teeth in, it might even kill it off, but it is exposed for what it is and the unification of Europe has now gone another 50-100 years in the future because of it."

Thinking that all of this happened because kiosks and taverns don't print out receipts in order to be taxed an average of 20% out of the usual 50 euro receipt, kind of gets hard to believe after looking at the bigger picture. This kind of laws are truly there just to keep people busy arguing over shit and creating a fuss in markets, when the real problem is, as you correctly state, the public sector and people that are being paid for doing nothing all day. It is not the businesses' and neither the citizens' job to keep track of taxes and if everybody issues receipts. The government has failed to do this, and will continue doing so. Creating mischief between businesses and the people is just another way to keep everybody busy with having false thoughts over the situation.  There are currently around 700.000 public sector workers in Greece, each one of them earning an average of 700€ per month (I'm pretty sure that this is inaccurately low, but nevermind...), and I'll have to be generous to say that almost half of them are simply not truly needed. So, 700k * 700 € * 50% is almost 200M€ spent on fucking slackers... each month... for the past 20-something years... And don't get me started on pensions."

Thinking that all of this happened because teachers and nurses don't work enough and paid too much, kind of gets hard to believe after looking at the bigger picture. This kind of attitude is truly there just to keep people busy arguing over shit and creating a fuss in the worker movement, when the real problem is: that all the money that got absorbed all these years was not used to build productive infrastructure but was 'invested' in housing and gambled away in the various stock markets and wall street.  If you want to blame civil servants (not administration!!!) about the mess we are in, it's like blaming the workers in a factory that goes bankrupt because of mismanagement. You are saying that HALF the civil servants are not truly needed? Seriously? Well if we don't need any hospitals, schools, army, police, firefighters, tax officers etc etc sure. Saying you could force people to do the same job for 200$ in the free market is also true. But calling out all of the civil service as slackers (go tell that to a nurse in a public hospital or just start moving the posts in the 'not all but most') is the EXACT SAME THING the Europeans are doing for our whole country and YOU do for a part of it.  I WANT to get you started on pensions. Please do tell me what you think about pensions! What exactly do you think pensions are? Do we need them or should we let people die when they are older? Do we have too many pensioners? Or were the pension funds looted by the banks and the administrators and fucked over by the PSI? Please do tell - I'm dying to know.  To conclude: you are saying that someone cheating the state out of 20% OF EVERY TRANSACTION is not a problem, but the problem is that we pay pensions and public sector. Let that sink a little bit."

I wish for them to be able to do their best at bringing more clients and doing business, not for their clients to be playing tax collector. That's not their job, that's the government's job.   The government (supplier) should create incentives for its citizens (consumers) in order for them to pay their taxes, in order for them to receive public services (product). In this relationship right now there is a problem with the product. I pay taxes to a government that because of poor management and inability to organize and control its workers, in the end provides me a low-quality product: That is a shitty education for me and my children, shitty transportation, ridiculous pensions for anybody that wasn't lucky enough to be hired back in the 80s.

greece,3d8aly,paremiamoutza,8,Tue Jul 14 09:31:31 2015 UTC,I love when the Europeans there paint themselves as so progressive when they're as racist and xenophobic as the tea party here in the US. And they have the same economic views.
greece,3d8aly,ibrokedown,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:59 2015 UTC,who is painting themselves as progressive? The neo-liberals? You know that the main parties running Europe are the equivalent of the Republicans in the US right?
greece,3d8aly,gorat,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly referring to posters in /r/Europe, and Americans in general who see Europe and Europeans as so progressive (which is circlejerked to infinity on reddit) when really they aren't, but I suppose the blame could be shared."
greece,3d8aly,ibrokedown,2,Tue Jul 14 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"Ah ok - well the American political spectrum is so far removed to the right (and you also have the weird American liberalism which has no equivalent in Europe) that for most Americans the European system makes no sense. E.g. countries that are 'right wing' such as Germany having national free universal universities and healthcare. All these things were won by the fights of our workers and are in the process of being dismantled.  The racism and xenophobia is true though. And it has nothing to do with being politically 'left' in this level. Meaning that the 'left' is generally more sensitive against it, but prejudices and uninformed narratives exist everywhere. If you judge european politics from /r/europe  then you need to judge us politics from /r/news --- doesn't really correspond to opinions on the ground."
greece,3d8aly,gorat,0,Tue Jul 14 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional insight. And yes, I'm more thinking about Europeans in general, but I think you're right the /r/Europe isn't a good representation of European society, but at the same time I feel it may be a decent representation of those on Reddit who claim Europe and America are so different when it comes down to things like economics and uninformed morons. I see a lot of the same arguments that I see the tea partiers spout over here, and I don't think they're wholly representative of US political leanings but I think the perception over here at least is that that is a much smaller and less vocal group in Europe, and many on Reddit are quick to support that. Hopefully that makes a little sense!"

The people are not that different in Western Europe (UK and Netherlands) than what they are in East Coast (at least white low/middle class people). I have found more rapport about the Greek everyday condition/reality/customs with Indian/Arab/African immigrants than with white Americans.  But American politics are interesting to me. Esp. the fact that social democracy is a 'dirty' word in the US and one of the biggest political factions in most EU countries. Also in EU mostly liberals join with the conservatives."

I was at a performance yesterday and some Greek dudes on the seats behind me were talking with a Swedish lady that had bought a house here. She was talking about how friendly people she met here were and they tried to convince her that Greeks (and especially Greeks in my town) are pretentious.   There's a Greek saying that goes like this: ""Compliment your own home otherwise it will fall crushing you down."" Sadly, nobody seems to remember it at such moments."

greece,3d8aly,almeisan,11,Tue Jul 14 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"I was on Reddit in 2010, right about when the ""Greek crisis"" was in full swing. What really shocked me was the explosion of outright racism in threads everywhere as well as the media posted.   This couldn't have been caused by the crisis itself, it was too early for that.  I realised that there was always an undercurrent of racist perceptions about Greeks that simply found an outlet and an excuse to show itself. It was like a bubbling reservoir of hatred finally finding a release.  Once the genie was out of the bottle, the vitriol has been relentless, exhausting and repetitive. I can't count how many times I've seen the phrase ""tax evasion is the national sport of Greece"" repeated verbatim. It's even in this thread.   Thousands and thousands of reports, articles and ""insightful"" analyses rode on this racist undercurrent and hammered the shitiness of Greece into the European public mind since it was great for ratings. Each was a convenient ""two-minute hate"", making viewers feel good about themselves, since they are not like the lousy Greeks. People who think it's just internet forums...have access only to the internet.  And you know what, it's fucking exhausting hearing all the time ""Greeks are, and have always been (since the inception of the Greek state), lazy untrustworthy cheaters and should be punished, expelled, crushed etc etc and should live like the fucking parasites they are - how dare they crawl out of their shithole into the company of decent and civilised nations like ours. Fucking Zorbas.""   It's hard to swallow that there are people who genuinely want you and everyone you know and cared about (hard working, honest, fucking tax-paying people) to suffer because they are, collectively, scum. You can argue forever that the current state of affairs is the result of history, or neo-colonialism or whatever. It's like shouting at a wall.  So yeah, you can say I'm a bit angry. And Greece should pull it's head out of its ass and start taking notes from Israel in this matter before it's too late..."
greece,3d8aly,polytropos,32,Tue Jul 14 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"When 15 years ago i was having conversations with greek people explaining them that we need to take austerity measures before things get much worse, the fellow greeks would get angry with me, school me, would explain that our economy is great ""because we have tourism"" and then they would go to vote for their favorite corrupted parties.  For example at the elections of 2009 one party said that we are in a crisis and we need asteurity measures and the other party (pasok) reassured the people that they will give trillions of euro to all the greeks (we have money...millions-billions-trillions - a. papandreou). After that the greeks felt they were deceived by the politicians...but how the FUCK can you believe that we actually had TRILLIONS?????How STUPID can you be to believe such a CRAZY lie????And how can you say that the politicians deceived you without saying a word about you being a foolish, easily manipulative, greedy, simpleminded child?? Now at the recent elections, the voting choices of the greeks for once again resulted in hard anal for all of us, for once again they voted for the guy who promised more money, continuing a trend that defined a nation throughout its recent history and led us to where we are.  So negativity against Greece doesnt bother me, its fair, we are a stupid and uneducated nation who got what it deserved and then put the blame on the politicians and the germans, thus avoiding our own collective and individual responsibility as always. Im not saying we ""ate"" the money together but for sure we voted together for the worst politicians. THE GREEK POLITICAN AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS NOT PROJECTED ONTO ITS PEOPLE. ITS THE GREEK PEOPLE THAT PROJECT THEMSELVES INTO THE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM."

greece,3d8aly,2nads,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:05:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In my opinion everyone is to blame but if you had to pick which side (people or politicians) are more to blame for the state of the country I would definitely say it’s the people... This because the people were not tricked into anything and have known for decades how corrupt the system is but continue to leave things as is, vote for the same corrupt parties/politicians and look only at their self-interest. The majority of people still have this welfare and entitled attitude and I don’t think this can be shaken off overnight. That will take years and only after there has been a conscious effort for reform. I am Greek-American and live/work in the US. I was born in the US and my parents are Greek immigrants, however, I spent my teenage and early adult years in Greece. I believe that the Greeks residing in Greece and the Greeks that have immigrated abroad are very different. What I have learned from seeing Greeks on both sides is that we have the capacity to be smart and hard-working, however, we need a hand to force this. Greek immigrants are successful in whatever they do abroad because they were forced into organized systems in the countries they immigrated to. On the other hand, things are corrupt in the Greek state because you don't have that hand to force things and people like to blame the government or each other for all their issues. This has been a repeating thread throughout Ancient & Modern Greek history. External “threats” have always unified and brought out the best in Greeks, but in normal circumstances when we are supposed to govern ourselves all we do is bicker amongst each other. If we want to call ourselves Europeans and stay in the Euro then these forced reforms are necessary. Otherwise, we need to just go back to the drachma and live the “life” we have lived for the last 50 years but this time in isolation."

It's mostly uninformed people, tourists or foreigners in general that say those things. The stereotype of the lazy tax-evading, 14yo pensioner leeching beggar Greek was forged during the first years of the crisis. In 2012 you wouldn't find not one single voice in foreign media talking about what's going on here. Greece's debt was considered something the Greeks created unlike what happened in Ireland for instance or Spain. It was our fault entirely and we should be punished for it. Anyways.   So I have a friend who works for an EU agency and he's been living there for decades.  He comes back home every summer and that's when I see him. So in 2012 he came with his girlfriend and they went on holidays on an island. While on holiday they took a one day cruise and on the boat were a Belgian or French couple. Those two kept making snarky comments about Greece and the situation here.  So after a while he (my friend) got angry and decided to a. let then know he speaks French fluently and understands them perfectly b. That, unlike them, most Greeks are fluent in more than one foreign language and they should be careful what they talk about. Then he proceeded to lecture them on what's actually going on with the crisis.   So, I'd say there are tourists that come here with a half assed opinion, formed by reading the headlines of tabloids. But, of course, not all tourists are assholes. Some are though."
greece,3d8aly,sherlock234,4,Tue Jul 14 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I agree. The usual tourist mentality:  ""Take plane from shitty German factory town to beautiful Greek island where 0.0001% of Greek population lives. Ignore all the people working from 6am - 4am to serve you etc. Take a picture of a Greek person on holidays lying in the sun. OH HERE PROVEN THAT ALL THE GREEKS ARE LAZY"""
greece,3d8aly,gorat,5,Tue Jul 14 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"What is beyond me and I can't understand, honestly are people like the Dutch and god, Slovaks et al who are so brainwashed by the hatred their media is spewing about Greece they forget their recent past. I mean, dude. Your minister of Finance, is someone who lied about getting a degree on milking cows from an obscure Irish technical school (probably because he figured no one would find out) only to be ousted by the school. He should have gone home, not be president of the euro group. What more evidence do you need that you're Schauble's bitch and you're there only because you do as he tells you? And you come here to lecture me about corrupt politicians? Give. Me. A. Break."
greece,3d8aly,sherlock234,4,Tue Jul 14 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"Of course I want to remind at this point the horrible way many Greeks have used against many people esp. from the Eastern Block when we were on the part of the ""winners"". How many women exploited in Greek brothels, how many worked in the fields without pay, how many ridiculed for being 'dirty', 'thieves' etc.   ""Romanian is not a nationality, it is a profession"" (implying they are thieves)  ""Oh from where did you bring her?"" (told to a friend that has a Russian gf - she's a legit scientist - implying he 'bought' her or something)  The people that did these things live among us, and I think we both know some of them. The only reason I liked the crisis is to see the understanding in these people's minds that this is exactly what they were doing 15 years ago to Albanians etc. And they fucking don't get it! It's incredible.  Any 'Real Greek' (ελληναρας) that went to Eastern Europe when their countries collapsed and came back saying how many women he fucked for 100 dollars etc - I wish he gets forced to suck a German's dick for a plate of lentils. But the rest of us will also suffer unfortunately."
greece,3d8aly,gorat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:58:26 2015 UTC,I know and this has gained us a lot of hate and rightfully so.

greece,3d8aly,gorat,-14,Tue Jul 14 19:26:13 2015 UTC,I have been visiting friends in Greece for almost a decade. I love them but they are NOT as honest and hardworking as you make them out to be. Tax evasion is a national sport and they confirm that working for the government is a guarantee for a very lazy job and early retirement . Even when they get called to the army they can slack all they want. My friends over there confirm most of the prejudices I read in the papers. I really wish it was the opposite.  I don't want my friends to suffer but If Greek culture is ever going to change than we should not be sending more money. You can't expect people to change when they are never faced with the consequences.  Now let the downvotes rain down on me! Too bad downvotes don't pay for debts.

greece,3d8aly,koyima,6,Tue Jul 14 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"I know many Greeks here in the US. They work more and save more than the locals. When Americans make money they spend it all on cars and other bullshit and then need to take loans to put their kids through college and then cry that they can't get jobs to pay these loans back. Typical American lazyness. They absorb all of the wealth around the world and can only create slums and houses that are falling apart which they are renting for exorbitant prices.  As for tax evasion, there is a ridiculous amount of tax evasion in the US. For example, many employees (such as waiters) make tips which are 'estimated' for taxes. I have heard of several loopholes in their tax code that are used to avoid paying taxes. Esp. for big companies. The tax loopholes they use are incredible. For example, to avoid paying VAT people take their cars and go to a different state and buy liquor and cigarettes and smuggle them over state lines to avoid paying taxes. Others sell things second hand in websites like craigslist without paying sales tax. Even others work as taxi drivers in Uber or hoteleers in AirBnB without paying the proper taxes for this type of bussiness.  The US is in fact a country of tax evaders and people that can't seem to save money even though they make about 5 times more than Greek workers do.  I don't want Americans to suffer bu if American culture is ever going to change we need to stop sending all the money of the world to be lost in Wall Street bubbles and not allow the US to invade and pillage any country around the world that has oil or other resources. You can't expect people to change when they are never faced with the consequences."
greece,3d8aly,gorat,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:57 2015 UTC,I know many Greeks here in the US. They work more and save more than the locals.    clearly those aren't the greeks that stayed in greece.  immigrants in general tend to be more ambitious and harder working than the average person. otherwise they'd stay at home.

greece,3d8aly,gorat,-3,Tue Jul 14 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that Greeks are hardworking people.   (At least the 40% of Greeks who aren't part of the privileged groups -- the rich, politically connected, union workers, restricted professions or public servants. They have to work twice as hard to make up for all the corruption, tax evasion and waste of the other 60%.)  But I still think it's true that immigrants tend to be harder working and more ambitious than average people.   that were not qualified enough to have a job at their original country and had to leave.   most of those people still stay home.  And being a doctor in Athens depends a lot on being born into the right family, hard work alone is only a part of it. Just like half the ""anarchists"" in Exarchia have rich parents."

It is completely crazy to say that 60% of the Greek pop are 'privileged' to the point of not having to do anything. Restricted professions ? (like taxi drivers?) - public servants? (teachers, nurses, cleaners, factory workers etc?) Everyone has degrees of 'perks' and degrees of inequalities against them (except the super rich and the super connected).  Being a doctor in Athens depends on getting in the medical school in what is probably the 'fairest' part of Greek life (university exams). Half the anarchists have rich parents??? oh what next? KKE is owned by Shipping magnates and Golden Dawn is the only one looking out for the simple man?"

If you could avoid paying taxes, all your neighbors avoid paying taxes, and the government had few tools to enforce the tax laws, wouldn't you just choose not to pay taxes?  This is not Greek culture. These are policies that create perverse incentives.  If you took a Greek man and plopped him down in the US, do you think he would not pay his taxes? Do you think he would avoid jobs that require him to work 40 hours per week? I don't."

Το πρόβλημά μας είναι ότι δεν παράγουμε προϊόν σε ποσότητα και ποιότητα. π.χ. εξάγουμε το περισσότερο λάδι μας στο εξωτερικό (χύμα) για να το μεταπουλάνε (συσκευασμένο) ξένοι στο 10πλάσιο της τιμής ενίοτε και η βιομηχανία υψηλής τεχνολογίας (ΕΚΕΙ είναι τα πολλά λεφτά) είναι ανύπαρκτη όπως και άλλοι αποδοτικοί τομείς.  Εξάλλου είναι κοινό μυστικό ότι και στο ευρώ κάνεις ""υποτίμηση"" αν θες, δεν απαιτείται φωτοτυπικό με δραχμές: Απλά μειώνεις και τις αποδοχές και αναγκαστικά μειώνεται και η τιμή του προϊόντος. Απλά είναι ευκολότερο να κάνεις προπαγάνδα στο λαό τυπώνοντας δραχμές διότι είναι ευκολότερο να ακριβαίνεις τα πάντα με τον πληθωρισμό παρά να του μειώνεις το μισθό.  Ειδικά για τους φτωχότερους είναι ακριβώς το ίδιο αφού δεν έχουν καν περιθώριο αποταμίευσης (άσε που η αποταμίευση είναι προβληματική στον υπερπληθωρισμό, ένα από τα μεγάλα πλεονεκτήματα του ευρώ είναι ότι είναι σταθερότατο)."

greece,3d8v28,kafros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"Δεκτό επιχείρημα κατά το ήμισυ, αλλά νομίζω ότι εν μέρει τουλάχιστο το ΔΝΤ το λέει γιατί θέλει να πάρει ίσες αποστάσεις και από τις δύο πλευρές.   Το report γράφει ότι πριν ένα χρόνο θα μπορούσε κανείς να πει ότι ήταν βιώσιμο το χρέος αν εφαρμόζονταν το πρόγραμμα ακριβώς όπως είχε συμφωνηθεί: δηλαδή αν πιάναμε τους στόχους πρωτογενών πλεονασμάτων 4-5% και αν είχαμε πολύ ανάπτυξη και αν η επόμενη δόση λιτότητας δεν μείωνε πολύ την οικονομική δραστηριότητα.   Γράφει συγκεκριμένα:   About a year ago, if program policies had  been implemented as agreed, no further  debt relief would have been needed to  reach the targets under the November 2012  framework (debt of 124 percent of GD P by 2020 and “substantially below”  110 percent of GDP by 2022).     Δηλαδή πολύ θεωρητικά ισχύει το ""πιο πριν ήταν μια χαρά βιώσιμο το χρέος αλλά τώρα ξαφνικά έγινε μη-βιώσιμο"".   Επίσης, περιέχει δύο σημαντικές διαφωνίες με αυτό που γράφεις. Η πρώτη είναι ότι το χρέος θα ήταν θεωρητικά βιώσιμο αν πριν ένα χρόνο, με την προηγούμενη κυβέρνηση, συνεχίζονταν το πρόγραμμα λιτότητας όπως είχε συμφωνηθεί. Άρα θεωρούν ότι το όλο χάος με το κλείσιμο των τραπεζών έκανε τη βιωσιμότητα πολύ χειρότερη, αλλά και πριν από τότε το χρέος δεν ήταν βιώσιμο. Λέει συγκεκριμένα:   But the significant shortfalls in program impl ementation during the last year led to a  significant increase in the financing need —by more than Euro 60 billion—estimated  only a few weeks ago. [...]  The  events of the past two weeks—the cl osure of banks and imposition of capital  controls—are extracting a heavy toll on the b anking system and the economy, leading to a  further significant deterioration in debt sustai nability relative to what was projected in our  recently published DSA.   Η δεύτερη είναι ότι έτσι όπως το γράφουν είναι σα να λένε ότι ούτως ή άλλως η θεωρητική ελπίδα ότι το προηγούμενο πρόγραμμα θα εφαρμόζονταν κατά γράμμα (και κατά συνέπεια το χρέος θα ήταν βιώσιμο) ήταν ψεύτικη. Γράφουν πχ ότι οι στόχοι για το πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα και για την ανάπτυξη δεν είναι ρεαλιστικοί. Γράφει:   Medium-term primary surplus target : Greece is expected to maintain primary  surpluses for the next several decades of  3.5 percent of GDP. Few countries have  managed to do so.   Growth : Greece is still assumed to go from  the lowest to among the highest  productivity growth and labor force partic ipation rates in the euro area,    Δε γίνεται να σου λέει ότι ""σχεδόν καμία χώρα δεν έχει καταφέρει πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα δεκαετιών 3.5%"" στη μία παράγραφο και στην άλλη να σου λέει ""αν η Ελλάδα είχε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα δεκαετιών 4.5% τότε το χρέος της θα ήταν βιώσιμο""..."

You re the one with a minister of finance who lied about getting an obscure degree from an obscure school, who publicly claimed he dislikes the Greek government and who instead of showing him the door for his lies and lack of qualification EU made him president of the euro group. That obviously makes you an expert on corruption in politics and how a successful country should deal with it."

I'm just pointing out your hypocrisy, though you should be able to see it every time your minister launches an attack on Greece. He's a liar and a cheat. And he's still your minister of finance. Where's your outrage about this fact?"

People had rather see you guys bugger off. I so very much hope this deal wont go on. Greece's bullshit bout blaming everyone but themself is really starting to annoy me. I hope there will be rally's against paying you hobo's a single euro, and I will  be there. You lie, you fraud, you slack, you slander, you insult, you parasite, and you are too simple to learn. This money should have gone to countries like Nepal, where people actually take responsibility."

greece,3d9n2r,hrskaeg,10,Tue Jul 14 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"For me the refererendum had no clear question, many people that voted for NO will disagree between themselfs about what the actual question was.  Was it a no to harsh terms and austerity? Was it a NO to euro and leaving EZ/?  I also believe that when you present the people with a choice of fiscal policy that would only make their lives worst they would almost always choose to vote NO.  And yet according to most polls, around 70-75% want to remain in the eurozone.  I was a stern federalist and supporter of the euro, i lost a lot of my faith and original enthusiasm but i still think that going to drachma would be much worse for our economy, and so far the supporters of a return to a national currency have not provided a clear plan for the transition.  I think the blame leading to the crisis is on us ( electing succesive corrupt governments, resisting vital and necessary improvements on the state function ) but i also put the blame on the actual handling of the crisis by our creditors."
greece,3d9n2r,merhandus,0,Tue Jul 14 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"As a fellow federalist, the core of the issue is that we don't have enough centralization. When fiscal policies are negotiated as treaties between nations and parliaments (where there can be an 'aggressor' and a 'defender' designated by politicians to use for internal consumption) these things are to be expected. We either have to move backwards (Dissolution of the Eurozone, keep EU as a free trade zone) or forwards (cede total fiscal policy to a central authority)."
greece,3d9n2r,Theban_Prince,10,Wed Jul 15 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"What was the point with the referendum about the economical direction, when your very clear no (as I see it) pretty much was ignored by your political leadership?   The referendum result was not respected, but I don't think it was totally pointless. The Greek population expressed a policy preference, that should count for something. Could be used as a springboard for something in the future.   Who do you blame for the situation you are in now? The politicians, the Troika, the Banks, other nations, you self or some other reason.   Blame is a strong word with moralistic undertones that has been misused throughout the crisis so allow me to refrain from assigning blame to specific actors.   What I think happened was that there was a specific political coincidence that led to the creation of a monetary union that was severely incomplete. That design deficiency magnified the existing problems of the Greek economy in the same way that putting a featherweight boxer in the same league with heavyweights would. Capital flowed from the capital-rich countries to the capital-poor, creating bubbles everywhere. Then the bubbles burst and the weakest links suffered the most. Normally both profligate borrowers and reckless creditors are to be blamed in a situation like this. But when the problem was revealed, the politics of the day meant that Greece had to take the full blame, which set the scene for the way the bailouts were handled.   That led to severely problematic bailouts that made the problem even worse and deferring the discussion about fixing the Eurozone to the future. The worsening economic situation in Greece angered the Greeks who saw their livelihoods destroyed and frustrated the creditors who felt like they were throwing good money after bad in a bottomless pit.   That political situation led to the election of Syriza and the heavy-handed way the Greek rebellion was treated by the creditors.    Would you prefer to stay in the Euro or leave. From my point of view it seems like you at the moment keep chasing some demands from IMF, the Euro group etc. and it must be hard to see where/when it ends. Is a sharp/sudden cut from the Euro preferable? Then you could rebuild at your own terms,   I think that politically the situation has become too explosive for any other solution. Greece has to leave the Eurozone and try to fix its economy using all the tools of a sovereign country at its disposal, that includes monetary policy. It would be hell for a few years but it's preferrable to this never-ending vicious circle. If there was any chance that the Eurozone would reform in the medium turn, I would prefer to stay with them, but that ship has sailed and it's unlikely to come back.   PS:   Danish koner yah!   Your currency is pegged to the euro and has been pegged to the euro for a long time. If shit hits the fan, you can ""exit"" the euro with much less harm than Greece. But your country has no independent monetary policy to speak of unless that happens."
greece,3d9n2r,Naurgul,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"The Greek population expressed a policy preference, that should count for something.   Τί policy preference όταν ο κάθε ένας το ερμηνεύει όπως γουστάρει?   Greece has to leave the Eurozone and try to fix its economy using all the tools of a sovereign country at its disposal, that includes monetary policy. It would be hell for a few years but it's preferrable to this never-ending vicious circle.   Με την πολιτική των τελευταίων 6 μηνών που δεν είχαν τα αρχίδια να επιβάλουν capital controls από Φλεβάρη ή έστω να μιλήσουν για περικοπές(εκτός του Λαπαβίτσα που τα λέει από την αρχή) το μετά Grexit μέλλον εξαρτάται από την Ευρώπη και τις διαθέσεις τους τις δείξανε.Τί μέλλον βλέπεις εσύ με το Grexit?"
greece,3d9n2r,pipo1122,5,Tue Jul 14 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"We do share the blame. We're not faultless in the situation. But the picture is hardly how it is portrayed in that we have made some serious sacrifices but the terms and conditions forced on us are part of the problem and not of the solution.    It's also far removed from the truth to say we have done nothing. In 5 long hard austerity years we've made a fiscal turn around of 12% at the very least during a recession. This, economists say, is unprecedented.    I can only speak for myself about the referendum. For the past 5 months our government was negotiating with representatives from the EU, IMF to find common ground and reach an agreement. On June 25 they finally had a proposal which they presented and were expecting that this would be signed. It was an austerity program, not a ""give us your monies"" program. On June 26 dijselbloom presented the government with a different proposal. This was the previous program the one the govemnt before SYRIZA could not pass. This program was presented with an ultimatum a Take it or leave it. This was put to the people to vote on.    I interpreted the question of the referendum not as a literal one. I mean even though the EU said well we're withdrawing the ultimatum and your ref. has no point, at the same time Juncker was urging Greeks to vote yes. Well, I did not like that. I mean it was underhanded of them to let the negotiations drag on and on and on until there was no time left, pretend like they're negotiating present an ultimatum then take it back then say vote for it.   I interpreted the question of the referendum as a vote of confidence to the government. Juncker should not have interfered with what we should have voted for. He had no right to tell me what to vote for.   If you ask me am I happy with the agreement  we've got the answer is no. But I'm now certain that the outcome would have been the same if not worse if we have voted yes. I have no illusions left about the EU and what they're about. They are far removed from the principles of democracy and solidarity. At best I'd say they're all about the solidarity to the banks and all the rest are just empty words.   This wasn't about an agreement for Greece. We're a debt colony now with the royal seal of approval. This was about overthrowing the government or at best humiliating it so that the Spanish people know who to vote for come elections. Because IF they wanted to make our situation viable this agreement makes no sense. It is economically inane."

Τον απλό λαό να τον ρωτήσουμε τι πιστεύει η αυτομάτως κάθε δυσφορία προς την ΕΕ μεταφράζεται ως αγάπη προς την Ρωσία; Όταν η ΕΕ ποντάρει στην πλάτη μας για χρήματα, και προσπαθεί τόσους μήνες να περάσει το δικό της με αποκορύφωμα την βδομάδα του δημοψηφίσματος, ο λαός πως πρέπει να αντιδράσει; Έτσι πως αντιδρούν οι Ευρωπαίοι μόνοι τους βάζουν τα χεράκια τους να βγάλουν τα ματάκια τους. Αυτά πως έδειξαν οι 6 μήνες διαπραγμάτευσης μόνο καλό για την ΕΕ δεν ήταν.  Υγ. Για να μην παρεξηγηθώ, όπου Ευρωπαίοι δεν εννοώ τον απλό κοσμάκη αλλά υπουργούς,πρωθυπουργούς κλπ"

greece,3d6697,vangelisc,12,Mon Jul 13 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Έτσι είναι. Λες και οι υπόλοιποι Ευρωπαίοι θέλουν ντε και καλά να μας δανείζουν εις τους αιώνες των αιώνων και είναι υποχρεωμένοι να το κάνουν. Το ότι απλά δεν εμπιστεύονται ούτε τους προηγούμενους που δεν έκαναν όσα υποσχέθηκαν αλλά ούτε τους (χειρότερους) τωρινούς που απεδείχθησαν ανεπαρκείς, αναξιόπιστοι, υβριστές, ψεύτες και τζογαδόροι, δε μας περνάει καν από το μυαλό.  Ποτέ δε φταίνε οι Έλληνες, πάντα φταίνε οι άλλοι, οι ξένοι, οι συνωμοσίες, οι Αμερικάνοι, οι κλίκες, η CIA, το FBI και οι εξωγήινοι αλλά ο επιούσιος ελληνικός λαός, ποτέ! Αλλά εγώ θα το πάω ακόμα παρακάτω για να ξαναμπω και στο θέμα. Θα το δώσω ότι οι ξένοι είναι οι σατανάδες και τα χειρότερα καθάρματα που έβγαλε ο κόσμος και ότι ήθελαν να ρίξουν την πρώτη-φορά-αριστερά κυβέρνηση. Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ (δε λέω ο Τσίπρας γιατί φάνηκε πως δεν ήταν μόνο δική του ευθύνη) τί έκανε που τα ήξερε όλα αυτά, αυτούς τους έξι μήνες; Τί κάνει μια σοβαρή κυβέρνηση που αντιλαμβάνεται τη δυσκολία των καιρών; Που είναι στριμωγμένη στη γωνία και την περιμένουν για να την ρίξουν; Φέρνει σοβαρές προτάσεις, κοστολογημένες και προτείνει σοβαρά σχέδια, έχει μια μετριοπαθή ρητορική, τηρεί τις συμφωνίες, μιλάει λιγότερο και δουλεύει περισσότερο. Τί έκανε ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ; α. Δεν έφερε ποτέ ουσιαστικές προτάσεις για διαπραγμάτευση, κοστολογημένες με νούμερα παρά μόνο όταν ήταν πολύ αργά (δημιουργική ασάφεια) β. Έξω παρίσταναν τους καλούς και μέσα,στα ΜΜΕ, έβριζαν τους υπόλοιπους εταίρους νυχθημερόν χρησιμοποιώντας ρητορική κερκίδας γηπέδου, παρόλο που ήξεραν ότι ήταν σε δύσκολη θέση, χωρίς διαπραγματευτικά όπλα. Α! να μην ξεχάσω ότι (λένε) ηχογραφούσαν και εμπιστευτικές συνομιλίες! Τί είδους διαπραγματευτική τακτική είναι αυτή προς αυτούς που ζητάς χρήματα, δεν την καταλαβαίνω, πραγματικά. γ. Έλεγαν ψέμματα στο λαό ότι η συμφωνία υπογράφεται αλλά τελικά δεν υπογράφηκε ποτέ, έλεγαν ότι δε θα φτάσουμε σε capital controls & δημοψήφισμα αλλά τελικά έγιναν τα αντίθετα και κατέστρεψαν την εγχώρια οικονομία εδώ και μισό μήνα. δ. Επαναπροσέλαβε κόσμο στο δημόσιο χωρίς κριτήρια - ξεκινησε η δημιουγία πελατειακού κράτους (ΕΡΤ, καθαρίστριες, συμβασιούχοι ΜΕΤΡΟ κλπ) ενώ έπρεπε να βάλει ορισμένα κριτήρια αξιοκρατίας (τους επαναπροσέλαβε όλους!) και ορισμένα οικονομικά κριτήρια. ε. παρέλαβε μια οικονομία με πλεόνασμα και ένα βήμα πριν την τελευταία αξιολόγηση για να βγει από το μνημόνιο και μετά στις αγορές και τώρα πάμε σε 3ο μνημόνιο για άλλα 3 χρόνια με χειρότερα μέτρα. ζ. πήγαν χωρίς κανένα σχέδιο σε μια δύσκολη κατάσταση, χωρίς προτεοιμασία, δίχασε το λαό και έκλεισε τις τράπεζες με το πιο γελοίο-ανύπαρκτο δημοψήφισμα που έγινε ποτέ.  Πέρα από όλα αυτά όμως, δε θα συγχωρέσω ΠΟΤΕ στο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ και τους εκπροσώπους του ότι μέσα σε 6 μήνες κατάφερε να δικαιώσει τους άλλους γελοίους τύπους (Σαμαροβενιζέλιδες), να ξευτιλήσει την έννοια της αριστεράς και πλέον οι περισσότεροι στην Ευρώπη να μας βρίζουν και όσοι δε μας βρίζουν να μας θεωρούν πρόβλημα.  Αξιοπρέπεια πάνω απ' όλα. Ως συνήθως, εθελοτυφλούμε. Μπορεί το παιχνίδι να είναι στημένο και ο διαιτητής πουλημένος αλλά άμα δεν ξέρεις να παίζεις και βάζεις αυτογκόλ, δε δικαιούσαι να φωνάζεις."
greece,3d6697,Nymrael,10,Mon Jul 13 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"Κοίτα, καλή και άγια η διαμαρτυρία σου. Δεν λέω. Έχω κι εγώ πολλά παράπονα.   Αλλά: Πολλά από αυτά που τους προσάπτεις,το κάνεις - κατά τη γνώμη μου - λάθεμένα. Γιατί ίσως εξηγούνται. Π.χ.:    Δημιουργικη ασάφεια σκόπιμα ζητήθηκε από Ευρωπαίους ώστε να περάσουν τα νομοσχέδια στα δικά τους κοινοβούλια. Το ότι γύρισαν μετά και το καταλόγισαν σε μας, οκέι, αν θες το λες απειρία ότι δεν μπόρεσε να προβλέψει την κίνηση αυτή.  Ηχογραφούσε ο Βαρούφ τις συνομιλιες όπως όλοι οι άλλοι υπουργοί το κάνουν, γιατί πρέπει να δώσουν μετά περίληψη στην κυβέρνηση/πρωθυπουργό και οι ίδιοι να θυμούνται τι ειπώθηκε και γιατί. Αν υπήρχε πραγματική διαφάνεια θα υπήρχαν πρακτικά ώστε να μη λέει μετα ο κάθε καραγκιόζης διαρροές και είπα ξείπα και μετά εκείνος είπε. Φυσικά τέτοια πρακτικά θα ήταν τελείως εναντίον  των σκοπιμοτήτων που εξυπηρετούνται γιατί θα καταλάβαινε και η κουτσή Μαρία ποιός κάνει πόλεμο και ποιος έχει αληθινές προτάσεις. Φυσικά του την είπαν και σε αυτό ενώ όλοι το έκαναν. Κλασικές τακτικές - σου τη λέμε μόνο εσενα για να υπάρχει μόνιμη κριτική πάνω σου. Όπως και όταν του την είπαν το Μάιο γιατί δεν έχει εφαρμόσει η κυβέρνηση κανένα μετρο δήθεν ενώ οι ίδιοι αρχικά ζήτησαν να μη γίνει μονομερής λήψη μέτρων γιατί θα εκληφθεί ως εχθρική κίνηση στην διαδικασία.  Το ότι δεν έφερε ποτέ ουσιαστικές προτάσεις. Αυτό δεν είμαι σε θέση να το ξέρω. Αλλά δεν νομίζω ότι ισχύει, όπως τότε που αναγκάστηκε να δημοσιεύσει το υπουργείο τον κατάλογο προτάσεων που ήταν 50 σελίδες. Ή όπως τότε που τους αποκαλούσαν παιδιά σε συζήτηση με μεγάλους. Νομίζω ότι ήταν συνολική τακτική των Ευρωπαίων για να αποκαλέσουν τον ΣΥΡΙΖΑ ασόβαρο και επιπόλαιο κόμμα, με σκοπό να του στερήσουν τη νομιμοφάνεια και να καθαιρέσουν τις προτάσεις του ως ""ασυζητίσιμες"". Μέρος γενικότερης τακτικής του ότι ""εσείς είστε γενικά γελοίοι αριστεροί του κώλου και εμείς μόνο είμαστε οι σοβαροί"", που φυσικά είναι πολύ εύκολο να φτιάξεις όταν έχεις σχεδόν όλες τις κυβερνήσεις τις Ευρώπης να έχουν συμφέρον και να συμβάλλουν σύσσωμες σε αυτό το αφήγημα. Έβγαινε η Λαγκάρντ ο Ντάισελμπλουμ και ο Σόιμπλε και με μια φωνή αποκαλούσαν τον Βαρουφάκη ασόβαρο, και άρα το έχαβαν όλοι αμάσητο.  Το ότι προσπαθούσαν να καθησυχάσουν. Αυτό κατά τη γνώμη μου δεν μπορείς να το καταλογίσεις. Τι δηλαδή, να πουν ""Σύντομα δεν θα χουμε τραπεζικό σύστημα γιατί μας απειλεί ο άλλος οτι θα μας κλεισει τις τράπεζες""; Τότε να δεις βank run. Πολλά από αυτά είναι αυτοεκπληρώμενες προφητείες. Όπως και το ότι δεν είχαν σχέδιο για επιστροφή στη δραχμή - ενώ όντως είχαν ένα γενικό που το ήξερε μόνο το κυβερνητικό επιτελείο 5-6 ατόμων. Αν είχαν βγει παραέξω οι προετοιμασίες (και δεν είναι δυνατόν να αποκρύψεις τίποτα έξω από λίγα άτομα) τότε να δεις χαμό. Είχαμε ήδη βγει από το Ευρώ.    Συμφωνώ να κάνεις κριτική στον ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, και πολύ μάλιστα. Αλλά μην τα ισοπεδώσεις όλα μπροστά στη μανία σου να βγάλεις ποιός φταίει.   Αν θες ρίξε κι ένα βλέφαρο εδώ να δεις από ελληνικής σκοπιάς το ζήτημα.   http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/07/yanis-varoufakis-full-transcript-our-battle-save-greece  https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/080715/we-underestimated-their-power-greek-government-insider-lifts-lid-five-months-humiliation-and-blackm?onglet=full"

Που νομίζω είναι γελοίο - ότι άλλο μπορείς να προσάψεις στον Βαρουφάκη, το ότι δεν έχει προτάσεις είναι το πλέον απίθανο. Αν τον καθίσεις κάτω θα σου αναπτύξει μια πρόταση με νούμερα μεσα σε 5 λεπτά. Όπως άλλωστε έχει κάνει σε άλλες περιπτώσεις. Αντίθετα αυτό που εννοούσαν είναι, νομίζω, ότι ""δεν έχετε προτάσεις που να συμβαδίζουν με τις δικές μας"" που σιγά σιγά έγινε ""δεν έχετε προτάσεις"".   Κατά την άποψή μου, το μόνο που θα μπορούσε να ελπίσει είναι το να πείσει με οικονομοτεχνικά επιχειρήματα για την ορθότητα των προτάσεών του, τις οποίες υποστηρίζουν οι περισσότεροι οικονομολόγοι στον κόσμο και να ποντάρει στην Ευρωπαϊκή αλληλεγγύη.  Η πολιτική που ακολουθείται στην Ελλάδα δεδομένα δεν δουλέυει ακόμα και αν δεν υπάρχει η δυσλειτουργία του Ελληνικού κράτους. Αν του πουν όχι παρόλα αυτά, και τον πιστεύω όταν λέει ότι δογματικά δεν δεχόντουσαν καν να ακούσουν αυτά που έλεγε, τότε δεν υπάρχει επιλογή. Κρατάνε όλα τα χαρτιά (και όλα τα χαρτονομίσματα), και δεν υπάρχει ούτε μία κυβέρνηση στην Ευρώπη να τον στηρίξει, ούτε πολιτικά ούτε οικονομοτεχνικά. Δεν μπορεί παρά να κάνει μια συνθηκολόγηση ή να βγει από το Ευρώ. Το δεύτερο δεν έχει την τόλμη να το κάνει επειδή δεν το θέλουμε και θα ήταν όντως καταστροφικό βραχυπρόθεσμα, το πρώτο είναι τελικά το μόνο που μένει.   Τώρα το μόνο που μένει είναι να αξιολογήσεις την συνθηκολόγηση που έκανε. Ε είναι χάλια. Αλλά σε κάθε περίπτωση θα υπήρχε συνθηκολόγηση. Πήρε το ρίσκο να προσπαθήσει να πετύχει κάτι καλύτερο με συνέπεια να πρέπει τελικά να δεχτεί κάτι χειρότερο. Αυτό στην κρίση σου πώς θα το δεις, αλλά τουλάχιστον έκανε αυτό που έλαβε εντολή να κάνει όταν εκλέχτηκε."

Αποδεικνύεται ότι σκόπιμα άφηναν το χρόνο να κυλάει για να πάμε στο λεγόμενο chicken game του Βαρουφάκη, να δούμε δηλαδή ποιος θα κάνει πίσω, εμείς οι ευρωπαίοι (τελικά κάναμε εμείς)   Ηχογραφούσε ο Βαρούφ τις συνομιλιες όπως όλοι οι άλλοι υπουργοί το κάνουν, γιατί πρέπει να δώσουν μετά περίληψη στην κυβέρνηση/πρωθυπουργό και οι ίδιοι να θυμούνται τι ειπώθηκε και γιατί. Αν υπήρχε πραγματική διαφάνεια θα υπήρχαν πρακτικά ώστε να μη λέει μετα ο κάθε καραγκιόζης διαρροές και είπα ξείπα και μετά εκείνος είπε. Φυσικά τέτοια πρακτικά θα ήταν τελείως εναντίον των σκοπιμοτήτων που εξυπηρετούνται γιατί θα καταλάβαινε και η κουτσή Μαρία ποιός κάνει πόλεμο και ποιος έχει αληθινές προτάσεις. Φυσικά του την είπαν και σε αυτό ενώ όλοι το έκαναν   Δε χρειάζεται καμία ηχογράφηση γιατί τηρούνται πρακτικά, όπως σε κάθε συνεδρίαση. Σε κάθε περίπτωση εγώ θα δεχτώ ότι για λόγους ασφαλείας, κάνεις τη δική σου ηχογράφηση αλλά δεν απειλείς να τις δημοσιοποιήσεις ΟΤΑΝ ΑΚΟΜΑ διαρκούν οι διαπραγματεύσεις με σκοπό να εκβιάσεις τους εταίρους για όσα εμπιστευτικά λέγονται. Οι διαπραγματεύσεις πρέπει να διέπονται από εμπιστοσύνη.   Κλασικές τακτικές - σου τη λέμε μόνο εσενα για να υπάρχει μόνιμη κριτική πάνω σου. Όπως και όταν του την είπαν το Μάιο γιατί δεν έχει εφαρμόσει η κυβέρνηση κανένα μετρο δήθεν ενώ οι ίδιοι αρχικά ζήτησαν να μη γίνει μονομερής λήψη μέτρων γιατί θα εκληφθεί ως εχθρική κίνηση στην διαδικασία.    Τί λες; Έπρεπε να κάνουν μεταρρυθμίσεις και εκείνοι έκαναν μόνο προσλήψεις! Αυτά δεν είναι μέτρα...Δεν έκαναν καμία σοβαρή μεταρρύθμιση που να επηρεάζει την οικονομία. 5 μήνες ασχολούμασταν με βλακείες και πήγαινε-έλα στις Βρυξέλλες.   Το ότι δεν έφερε ποτέ ουσιαστικές προτάσεις. Αυτό δεν είμαι σε θέση να το ξέρω. Αλλά δεν νομίζω ότι ισχύει, όπως τότε που αναγκάστηκε να δημοσιεύσει το υπουργείο τον κατάλογο προτάσεων που ήταν 50 σελίδες. Ή όπως τότε που τους αποκαλούσαν παιδιά σε συζήτηση με μεγάλους. Νομίζω ότι ήταν συνολική τακτική των Ευρωπαίων για να αποκαλέσουν τον ΣΥΡΙΖΑ ασόβαρο και επιπόλαιο κόμμα, με σκοπό να του στερήσουν τη νομιμοφάνεια και να καθαιρέσουν τις προτάσεις του ως ""ασυζητίσιμες"". Μέρος γενικότερης τακτικής του ότι ""εσείς είστε γενικά γελοίοι αριστεροί του κώλου και εμείς μόνο είμαστε οι σοβαροί"", που φυσικά είναι πολύ εύκολο να φτιάξεις όταν έχεις σχεδόν όλες τις κυβερνήσεις τις Ευρώπης να έχουν συμφέρον και να συμβάλλουν σύσσωμες σε αυτό το αφήγημα. Έβγαινε η Λαγκάρντ ο Ντάισελμπλουμ και ο Σόιμπλε και με μια φωνή αποκαλούσαν τον Βαρουφάκη ασόβαρο, και άρα το έχαβαν όλοι αμάσητο.   Δηλαδή πάλι φταίνε οι ξένοι... Οι 50 σελίδες ήταν αρχές Ιουνίου, αυτό που σου λέω και εγώ (http://www.star.gr/Pages/Politiki.aspx?art=279887&artTitle=afto_einai_to_schedio_47_selidon_me_tis_protaseis_tis_ellinikis_kyvernisis) Αδελφέ μου, δεν είναι στραβός ο γιαλός, στραβά αρμενίζουμε. Δεν έλεγαν εξ αρχής οι ξένοι ότι η κυβέρνηση είναι γελοία αλλά αντιθέτως, η κυβέρνηση ήταν γελοία, για αυτό το έλεγαν οι ξένοι. Τους εταίρους, τους δανειστές, πες τους όπως θες, τους ενδιέφερε ένα πράγμα. Να τηρήσουμε τα συμφωνηθέντα και να κάνουμε όσα πρέπει για την οικονομία ώστε να επιτευχθούν τα προαπαιτούμενα για να παραμείνουμε στο ευρώ και την ΕΕ. Η Ελλάδα είναι μέλος ενός ισχυρού οργανισμού, είμαστε δηλαδή μέλη σε ένα δυνατό κλαμπ αλλά για να είμαστε μέλη και ν απολαμβάνουμε τα καλά (ισχυρό νόμισμα, ασφάλεια, συμμαχίες κλπ) έχουμε ορισμένες υποχρεώσεις ως προς την οικονομία μας (συγκεκριμένο ποσοστό δημοσίου χρέους, συγκεκριμένα ελλείματα κλπ) Δεν τους ενδιαφέρει αν υπήρχε αριστερή ή δεξιά κυβέρνηση, τους ενδιαφέρει να βγαίνουν τα νούμερα. Όταν λοιπόν βγαίνουν οι δικοί μας και είναι προκλητικοί (και χρωστάμε, και τους γελοιοποιούμε) λογικό είναι μετά οι δικοί μας να αντιμετωπίζονται ως μη σοβαροί Ο Βαρουφάκης έκανε γελοιότητες, ανεξαρτήτως των γνώσεών του στα οικονομικά. Βέβαια έχει διαψευστεί σε όλα όσα έχει πει μέχρι τώρα και άλλα λέει, άλλα κάνει και άλλα γίνονται.   Το ότι προσπαθούσαν να καθησυχάσουν. Αυτό κατά τη γνώμη μου δεν μπορείς να το καταλογίσεις. Τι δηλαδή, να πουν ""Σύντομα δεν θα χουμε τραπεζικό σύστημα γιατί μας απειλεί ο άλλος οτι θα μας κλεισει τις τράπεζες""; Τότε να δεις βank run. Πολλά από αυτά είναι αυτοεκπληρώμενες προφητείες. Όπως και το ότι δεν είχαν σχέδιο για επιστροφή στη δραχμή - ενώ όντως είχαν ένα γενικό που το ήξερε μόνο το κυβερνητικό επιτελείο 5-6 ατόμων. Αν είχαν βγει παραέξω οι προετοιμασίες (και δεν είναι δυνατόν να αποκρύψεις τίποτα έξω από λίγα άτομα) τότε να δεις χαμό. Είχαμε ήδη βγει από το Ευρώ.    Καταρχήν δε σε απείλησε κανένας ότι θα σου κλείσει τις τράπεζες. Μην πέφτεις θύμα της κυβερνητικής προπαγάνδας. Το τραπεζικό σύστημα λειτουργεί με συγκεκριμένους κανόνες. Από τη στιγμή που είμαστε σε νομισματική ένωση οι τράπεζές μας λαμβάνουν ρευστότητα από την ΕΚΤ, εφόσον η οικονομία μας είναι καλά (αυτό σε πολύ γενικές γραμμές για να μην μπλέξουμε και να μην μπούμε σε λεπτομέρειες με κόκκινα δάνεια, εξασφαλίσεις, εγγυήσεις κλπ) και εφόσον η οικονομία μας δεν είναι καλά (όπως τα τελευταία 5 χρόνια) τότε για να λάβουμε ρευστότητα πρέπει να είμαστε σε πρόγραμμα ρύθμισης (μνημόνιο). Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ αποφάσισε την Παρασκευή το βράδυ να πάμε σε δημοψήφισμα ενώ την Τρίτη έληγε το πρόγραμμα (μνημόνιο) χωρίς να έχει ολοκληρωθεί η τελευταία αξιολόγηση (έπρεπε να είχε γίνει το Φεβρουάριο). Τί έκαναν λοιπόν οι δικοί μας οι αετοί όταν είδαν ότι γίνεται bank run στο Σ/Κ, ΠΡΙΝ ακόμα κλείσουν οι Τράπεζες; Έκλεισαν τις τράπεζες στις 29-6 και επέβαλαν capital controls για να μην εξαφανιστεί η ρευστότητα και μετά είπαν ότι τις έκλεισε ο Ντράγκι που δεν αύξησε τη ρευστότητα μέσω ELA. Τρέλα. Δε λένε βέβαια ότι ακόμα και αν ο Ντράγκι είχε αυξήσει τη ρευστότητα με 1-2-3 δισ. ΠΑΛΙ θα είχε γίνει bank run γιατί ο κόσμος φοβήθηκε από το δημοψήφισμα. Ο ισχυρισμός ότι και καλά οι ξένοι έκλεισαν τις τράπεζες είναι απίστευτα γελοίος για όσους ξέρουν πώς λειτουργεί το πολιτικο-οικονομικό σύστημα. Οι άνθρωποι παρουσιάζουν το άσπρο - μάυρο. Ακόμα και αν υπήρχε σχέδιο από έξω να κλείσουν κάποια στιγμή τις τράπεζες, ΤΕΛΙΚΑ το προκάλεσαν οι ίδιοι.  Καλά... όσο για το σχέδιο για εθνικό νόμισμα, τι να πούμε; Κανένα απολύτως σχέδιο. Άτακτη χρεοκοπία. Αμφιβάλλω εάν έχουμε καν τα μηχανήματα για να τυπώσουμε εθνικό νόμισμα. Άσε που δεν είχε εντολή η κυβέρνηση να πάμε σε εθνικό νόμισμα, οπότε είχε ή δεν είχε σχέδιο, δεν έχει και πολύ σημασία.  Το θέμα είναι ότι δεν έπρεπε να φτάσουμε στο κλείσιμο των τραπεζών και εν τέλει να αποδειχθούν ψεύτες. Καθησυχάζεις τον κόσμο όταν ΟΝΤΩΣ δεν υπάρχει λόγος ανησυχίας, όχι όταν υπάρχει πρόβλημα. Όταν υπάρχει πρόβλημα, άστα να πάνε. Το θέμα είναι ότι το πρόβλημα μπορούσε να αποφευχθεί.  Δεν έχω καμία μανία να βγάλω ποιος φταίει. Ξέρω πολύ καλά ποιος φταίει όταν το αυτοκίνητο πέφτει στο γκρεμό. Φταίει ο οδηγός. Πριν έξι μήνες η χώρα δεν ήταν στο σημείο που είναι σήμερα. Δεν υπήρχε καν η προοπτική για κάτι τέτοιο. Κάτι μέτρα έλεγαν να πάρουν (mail Χαρδούβελη) και μέχρι εκεί. Δε συζητούσαμε να γίνουν όλα αυτά έλα όμως που το καταφέραμε και αυτό. Κατάφερε ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ να βγάλει αληθινό το τρομολαγνικό σποτ της ΝΔ. Αυτό και αν είναι ασυγχώρητο. Και οι προηγούμενοι φταίνε αλλά φταίνε για τα προηγούμενα χρόνια και φυσικά σε καμία περίπτωση δεν πρέπει να ξεχαστούν τα λάθη των προηγουμένων! Αλλά τα ανωτέρω λάθη των τελευταίων έξι μηνών δεν είναι λάθη των προηγουμένων, είναι λάθη των τωρινών. Κυρίως όμως φταίει ο ανώριμος και ανόητος ελληνικός λαός που για άλλη μια φορά ψήφισε ένα κόμμα που του έταξε τα πάντα σε μια περίοδο που εκ των πραγμάτων δεν ήταν δυνατόν να γίνουν. Πάλι νίκησε ο λαϊκισμός (όπως και τα προηγούμενα χρόνια, για να είμαι δίκαιος). Έταξαν τα πάντα δεν μπορούσαν να κάνουν τίποτα και από την αρχή ήταν εσωτερικά διασπασμένοι: οι μισοί ήθελαν να βγούμε εκτός ΕΕ / ευρώ οι άλλοι μισοί ήθελαν Ευρώπη."

Που σιγά μη δε τους ενδιαφέρει τι κυβέρνηση υπάρχει, εδώ το έχει πει ο κάθε διεθνής οικονομολόγος και λοιπός παρατηρητής από Βενεζουέλα μέχρι και το ΔΝΤ για ποιόν ακριβώς λόγο στήνεται το παράλογο σκηνικό της λιτότητας και έχω κι εσένα να μου λες ότι έπεσα και θύμα της κυβερνητικής προπαγάνδας κιόλας.   6 χρόνια ύφεση και 30% ανεργία και τολμήσαμε να ζητήσουμε διαφορετική μεταχείριση από το ""δυνατό κλαμπ"" που προσπαθεί να μας βοηθήσει να απολαμβάνουμε τα ""καλά"" όπως το ισχυρο νόμισμα(που τόσο μας έχει βοηθήσει ε!) και τις συμμαχίες.

Voting no to a referendum doesn't mean suddenly everyone is gonna get scared and give you better deals. Voting doesn't give you leverage.

Actually, from a pure economical perspective, lending to Greece right now makes very little sense. It may make sense politically/strategically to do so, true. It may make sense from a ""solidarity"" pov. Economically, though? It's kind of a no-brainer why the answer should be ""no""."

I was really looking for an argument in favour of the whole position (no haircut, insisting on austerity etc.)... since even the  right wing press in the UK now seems to be condeming the current policy."
greece,3d855e,vv_reddit,3,Tue Jul 14 10:45:31 2015 UTC,"What is it to look for? If you're not looking from a pure economic position, you're looking at what is, basically, a political position.  There's literally no way to establish what is the best policy in any given context, so you have typically tens of opinions. Some will be inevitably right, some will be inevitably wrong - but more often than not, they are stated with the absolute confidence of someone who knows that he's right.  My opinion? I think Germany was fed up with the ""greek problem"", and after the referendum they wanted to wash their hands and let the greek deal with it. Their offer was really ""temporary grexit, and we will help to the extent that we can"". However, to avoid looking like the inflexible guys who had a hidden agenda all along, they made a loan offer too - but it was purely a loan offer, with the intent to minimise risk/maximise benefit, not an offer for help. I don't think Schauble expected Tsipras to execute a complete U-turn and take the money on whatever conditions are handed to him.  In the end, nobody can really force the Greek government to do what's right for Greece. Hell, nobody really knows what's right for Greece. So we are where we are."
greece,3d855e,vv_reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:53:55 2015 UTC,I agree with what you say. I am not looking for the definite answer of what is right or wrong. I'm looking for an reasonably well written article that is supportive of the eurogroup position. I take all your points that it is all opinions and I absolutely agree - the reason I ask is that almost all the coverage I've read from the full spectrum has been fairly critical of the eurogroup approach. I am just interested to read an opinion on the other side (that is reasonably well developed with supporting arguments) - but even in the right wing press I struggle to find one.
greece,3d855e,ewxilk,2,Tue Jul 14 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"You do find support, but it's interpreted to be ""political opinion"". Let me explain: ALL the economic models require the proverbial ""spherical chicken in vacuum"" assumption to work. And everybody knows this, even their proponents - the only argument in their support is ""these are the best models we can formulate"", not ""these models are definitely accurate"".   The ""Varoufakis"" camp is simply stating that ""our economic models show this and that"". Some of what they show is fairly indisputable (like the fact that Greece is screwed), some of if is fairly disputable (like that their proposed ""fixes"" would actually do more good than harm when considering the larger world, not just Greece in particular).  The Eurogroup position is, basically, ""the world is too complex, we don't trust any damn model that requires spherical chickens in vacuum, we'll just stick to 'first principles' "". There are quite few ""first principles"" that they have repeatedly said they are worried about, the most important of which is ""we should strive to create proper incentives. We do not want to reward recklessness and to punish responsible behaviour"". Thus, in this approach Greece must suffer for their mistakes, and must work to fix them themselves - for if they transfer their suffering to the rest of EU, even if the overall suffering is more bearable for everyone, it creates the wrong rewards system and the rest of EU might become reckless too. And then, and only then, we are truly f*cked.  That's it, really. One side is arguing loudly ""your 'principled', inflexible approach is creating useless suffering!"" and ""Germans are just being heartless bean counters with no vision and foresight!"". The other side is taking all this beating while repeating all over again the 'first principles' we should all adhere to.  Now, you may believe that the 'first principles' approach is fundamentally flawed - but I don't think you can PROVE it to be flawed (not that this is stopping some economists from trying, and being very loud about their convictions too). Me? I trust the 'first principles' approach a whole lot more than the 'spherical chickens in vacuum' approach."

greece,3d8n51,koyima,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:49 2015 UTC,"Please consider an unpopular thought:  1. from a purely economic perspective, the Grexit is the only sustainable solution:   Your governments were spending more than collected for decades.  Before Euro, this was possible through devaluating drachma With Euro, the only way was through more credit. Of course this was not sustainable -- hence our issue at hand. With a very weak (and now even more damaged) economy you will not pay off the debts through austerity only. Yes, there is an investment part offered in the package. No, I don't think this will suffice. Yes, you can default. Short term, the consequences will be dire. People will realize how poor they are. But.... they are that poor now, it's just masked by the increasing debt. The Grexit will actually give you a chance to recover.   2. Politically the Grexit is unpopular   The Greek people don't want it, as they associate the years of prosperity with the Euro. Most of their liquid assets are in Euro too. But fortunes grow and go quickly, as the last years have shown. If you get the basics right, wounds will heal. The European leaders don't want it, not willing to lose face when it turns Euro in Greece was not a good deal. So continue as is, stressing the blame on the Greek, and waiting for their political successors to cope with the mess. Why would you care?   If you're looking for short-term appeasement of the people, accept the deal. These will continue to worsen your situation in the mid-to-long term even further. If you want an economically sustainable solution for your people, reject the deal.  Were I to vote, I would reject the deal and leave the Euro.   [Make it as prepared and controlled as possible though]  Even if I'm critical of a lot things the Greek politicians did, I wish you and your people the best in your endaveour.  /u/tzmudzin  P.S.1. Don't get me wrong:   I am firmly convinced that a common currency is good for Europe. I just don't believe it is good in your particular case, and I don't think centralizing monetary policy without centralized fiscal policy will work well in the long term. Unfortunately most Europeans are not ready for the latter yet, but that's a different story. Regaining Euro will be good for Greece when the basics are right: more competitive economy, better state institutions (incl., but not limited to tax office). There's a lot of good hints in the requirements from the EZ. Don't toss them out -- use them to the best of your country. Transfers from EU will continue regardless of the currency (see transfers to most of Eastern Europe, regardless of their local currencies)"
greece,3d8n51,tzmudzin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"Politically the Grexit is unpopular   It's pretty popular.  Grexit is an option, but not the preferred outcome, not because it doesn't offer a path to a viable Greece, but because the poverty that a portion of the population will endure can be avoided in the Euro, as long as someone cares to address it. In the drachma it will be unavoidable to an extent, simply because the transition is 'violent'.  The Euro should be able to handle these things and if it isn't equipped it should be equipped.   We shouldn't have entered the Euro and I think none of the PIIGS should have, but getting out is different than not getting in. Especially if you consider - what I am certain was part of what Tsipras was hammered with and what happened with the deal - the north will be vindictive and won't let Greece prosper after a Grexit.  As they did after the NO vote they will show their true colors and they would use any means necessary to demonstrate that leaving the flock will only end in disaster, simply to stop anyone else from defecting. One way or another they want to stop this from unraveling.  I am certain a lot of the more stable countries will stay clear of the euro now and England will never enter. This also means that a unified Europe is now further away, maybe impossible, unless there is a change of politics in Europe.  Politics and transparency."
greece,3d8n51,koyima,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"the poverty that a portion of the population will endure can be avoided in the Euro   No, it is not the currency denomination -- it is the credit you get, regardless of the currency. And you need that because internally your economy is not in balance. The Euro contributes to this significantly.   In the drachma it will be unavoidable to an extent, simply because the transition is 'violent'.   So face the reality and make it a planned, controlled & coordinated move. It is actually a shame this did not happen with the previous government nor in the last 6 months. Letting things go their own way is irresponsible and (sorry!) incompetent.   The Euro should be able to handle these things and if it isn't equipped it should be equipped.   The fix is to have a fiscal union, to match the monetary union. Yes, I think this is the right step. But are you ready to have your budget planned in Brussels or Frankfurt?  (In a way you already have... The rest of the EZ probably is not yet ready for that...)   As they did after the NO vote they will show their true colors and they would use any means necessary to demonstrate that leaving the flock will only end in disaster.   Don't let the internal politics obscure the external view. The rhetorics + negotiation tactics of Tsipras / Varoufakis were clearly damaging the credibility of Greece as a trustful debtor. The surprising referendum + NO vote finally destroyed this credibility and damaged economy even further. It's like a patient on life support waking up to stab himself. And then tell you it was his sovereign right and now it's your turn to fix him. Wouldn't you be pissed? Where's the logic in this?  ""True colors""? I don't like this rhetorics, as the debtors can follow the same logic and label you as lazy incompetent slackers sucking off hard-earned tax money of the rest of Europe. This downward spiral will not help anyone.  I don't think that anyone really expects Greece to pay off the debt.  And I don't think that this will make a huge difference. Politically it can be easily covered by the well known storyline of ""Greece did something stupid again"", and the short-term dip will be a showcase why others should not follow. The exit will be a relief to everyone.  You will still have negotiating power to ask for support (unless you overdo it...), but you will manage recovery on your own terms, with a much larger toolbox to fix things.   This also means that a unified Europe is now further away, maybe impossible, unless there is a change of politics in Europe.   This is what you get when the basics are not right. When Greece's debt was with private lenders, the anger was against the bankers. In 2012, when Greece (or rather: the private lenders) were bailed out, the creditor-debtor conflict became one of the nations. The sentiment change is not surprising at all...   How to fix this? Do not follow a face-saving storyline, but fix the basics."

So put yourself into the shoes of Merkel & Co. and imagine that suddenly in your highly developed, proud nation people face the same capital controls that Greece now has -- all of that on your watch? All of that just because for the last few years it was convenient to watch the other way (DO MORE URGENT STUFF!!) while Greece was accumulating the debt under everyone's radar. If in those shoes you had the option to:   get the banks to accept 50% of the losses jump in with the remaining 50%, expecting that the debtor will actually work hard and pay back sometime?   What would have been your decision?  Demonizing others is wrong. All too easily it spirals into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a lose-lose game."

Then when you see that the Greek people have been suffering for 5 years with no end in sight, it is unimaginable to help them, to lift the burden of debt, it is against the rules.  So the solution for Greece is simple: incorporate as a bank and get an automatic write off, because banks can't take the heat, it's only people in retirement and wage-slaves that can take this kind of heat.  A bank is too big too fail, but a nation? Bah..."
greece,3d8n51,koyima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying this is OK. I'm saying it happened, and the mechanism leading to that is understandable. That does not mean I endorse it. It means I understand how it happens.  I understand your emotions right now, but they are obscuring your view. The world is not black and white. When you start seeing things this way, you are losing touch with reality. It may be soothing emotionally. This does not make it right either.   Then when you see that the Greek people have been suffering for 5 years with no end in sight, it is unimaginable to help them, to lift the burden of debt, it is against the rules.   Rules have been bent and broken by everyone often enough. The problem you face is:     the spend reduction and the cost to society was clearly noted by the crediting countries some major areas of sleaze (corruption, tax avoidance etc) remain largely untouched  the new government leaves them like that for 6 months, focusing on antagonizing the creditors (or at best: behaving erratically), in the meantime rolling back any progress made in the last few years and putting the grinding economy to a full stop.   As an external creditor, would you lend money to Greece? Do you buy Greek obligations with your own money?   Again, I'm not defending this. I'm showing the mechanism without a moral judgement at this stage. Can you still blame those guys? Because if you're concerned about humanitarian aspects -- humanitarian help will be cheaper than the 80 bn.   This is brutal, but this is true.   A bank is too big too fail, but a nation? Bah...   Greece has already been bailed out twice, and now is offered a third deal.  So don't complain there's too little of good will.   Also: do not whine about the hard life, but make the best of what is available.  Help others help you. If you don't -- well, don't complain about the lack of support.  I know this is an emotional time, but emotions are not a good counsellor when finances are discussed."
greece,3d8n51,tzmudzin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:19 2015 UTC,"As an external creditor, would you lend money to the Banks if they still held the liabilities? Do you buy Bank obligations with your own money?   Now you do. Because the liabilities were transferred elsewhere.  What I am saying is that it is entirely retarded to consider the mechanism you used to save the banks sane, but deny that same mechanism to a nation of people. Not to mention the historic parallels.  I have no blinders, I don't see in black and white, I am showing you the absurdity of this system: it's ok to bail out a bank, but it is a moral hazard to bail out a country.  The banks didn't tighten their budgets after they irresponsibly lent money to Greece.   Loans are an investment and in every day economy when someone in debt goes bankrupt the bank takes a hit. What happened here is the hit was transferred to the taxpayer and then with that as pressure the hit was transferred to people that neither directly benefited from these stupid business moves, nor do they have the ability to pay them.  Bailing out? You call giving someone billions to service unserviceable  loans and cut off a leg a bail out?  It is well known that around 10% of the money received went to the economy. For any monies that reached the economy equivalent cuts needed to be made in the economy, which multiplied into further recession.  That's why people have filled Athens with graffiti saying: no more saving, no more bail outs.  If the bail out has the only goal of bailing out the retarded banks, it's not a bail out for the country, but for the banks.  Basically if you are an investor and you make a bad investment you lose that money or if you can you take a hit and work out a deal to get some of it back.  Currently creditors have lost no money, there is only one payment that hasn't been serviced and the banks only lost their profit on those loans.   Imagine if a movie producer made a flop and expected people that didn't see the movie or family members of some of the people that saw the movie to pay him back for all his investment...."

No, I believe we will not settle this on reddit. But just to illustrate this:   Bailing out? You call giving someone billions to service unserviceable loans and cut off a leg a bail out?   Yes. Bailout is not debt forgiveness.  There was a 50% debt reduction, and credits lines were extended on far more favorable terms than Greece can get elsewhere. Without it Greece would have defaulted in 2012 or 2010 already.   Even now, why do you talk to the EU to service the debts, not to the private investors? Is it because you're offered preferential treatment?   The banks didn't tighten their budgets after they irresponsibly lent money to Greece.   Excuse me? Did they not accept 50% losses ""voluntarily"" on the Greek debt? Did you not see them scrambling for money in 2010 and 2012? Were they not forced to adopt higher reserve levels? They're still not healthy, but having adopted the new regulations they're much less of a threat now.   Currently creditors have lost no money, there is only one payment that hasn't been serviced and the banks only lost their profit on those loans.   The private creditors lost 50% in the haircut in 2012. That was about 100 bn euro. But... are you seriously suggesting Greece will pay back the loans, with interest?"

greece,3d3z5h,geolink,-7,Mon Jul 13 11:51:15 2015 UTC,"Και για να ολοκληρωσω ...  Η τακτική που εφαρμόζει το νεοελληνικό Κράτος έναντι της Εκκλησίας κατά τα 180  έτη του ελεύθερου βίου του,  θυμίζει την πρακτική της αυτοκράτειρας του Βυζαντίου Ευδοξίας, όταν αρχιεπίσκοπος Κωνσταντινουπόλεως ήταν ο άγιος Ιωάννης ο Χρυσόστομος (αρχές του 5ου αιώνα): Ενώ η ίδια κατείχε αμέτρητο πλούτο και πολλά κτήματα,  μετά το θάνατο του πατρίκιου Θεόγνωστου,  που η ίδια είχε εξορίσει,  άρπαξε και την περιουσία του,  βυθίζοντας στη φτώχεια και τη δυστυχία τη χήρα και τα ορφανά του. Ο ιερός Χρυσόστομος τα προστάτεψε εισάγοντάς τα σε εκκλησιαστικό άσυλο, δεν παρέλειψε όμως με επιστολή του να στηλιτέψει την ανάλγητη και παράνομη συμπεριφορά της αυτοκράτειρας, πράγμα που αργότερα του στοίχισε και μία εξορία. Αλλά ποιος ο παραλληλισμός της τακτικής εκείνης με αυτήν του νεοελληνικού Κράτους; Ιδού:  Η Ελλάδα έχει συνολική έκταση 131.957.400 στρεμμάτων. Από αυτά, αγροτική γη, γεωργοκτηνοτροφικού ενδιαφέροντος, είναι:  29.500.000 στρέμ. δάση (22%)  52.500.000 στρέμ. βοσκότοποι (40%)  39.500.000 στρέμ. γεωργική γη (30%).  Από τις παραπάνω εκτάσεις, τα 61.441.900 στρέμματα ανήκουν κατά κυριότητα:  43.598.000 στο Δημόσιο  15.553.200 στην Τοπική Αυτοδιοίκηση  1.098.400 στις Συνεταιρ. Οργανώσεις  1.292.300 στην Εκκλησία.  Δηλαδή στην Εκκλησία ποσοστιαία ανήκει το 1,4% των δασικών εκτάσεων, το 2,3% των βοσκοτόπων και το 2,19% της γεωργικής γης (όπου όμως το Δημόσιο κατέχει το 45,6% και η Τοπική Αυτοδιοίκηση το 30,8%). Τα στοιχεία προκύπτουν από την έγκυρη μελέτη έρευνα με τίτλο «Ιδιοκτησιακό καθεστώς και αξιοποίηση της αγροτικής γης στην Ελλάδα» (των Θ.  Τσούμα και Δ. Τασιούλα),  έκδοση της Αγροτικής Τράπεζας, Αθήνα 1986, με πολλούς πίνακες και στατιστικά στοιχεία.  Και ενώ αυτή είναι η πραγματικότητα, κάθε φορά που το Κράτος θέλει να απομακρύνει την προσοχή του λαού από τα δικά του προβλήματα, «ξαναζεσταίνει» το θέμα «εκκλησιαστική περιουσία», με τη βοήθεια δε μερικών Μέσων Ενημέρωσης ή άλλων παραγόντων που διάκεινται εχθρικά προς την Εκκλησία ή δεν είναι επαρκώς ενημερωμένοι, καλλιεργούν το κλίμα και προετοιμάζουν το έδαφος για την τελική –όπως ελπίζουν– επέλαση, με σκοπό να αρπάξουν ό,τι απέμεινε από την περουσία αυτή, για να τη μοιράσουν δήθεν στους ακτήμονες. Να μοιράσουν το συνολικά 1,96% της Εκκλησίας, αφήνοντας ανέπαφα τα 60.443.500 στρέμματα του Δημοσίου, της Τοπικής Αυτοδιοίκησης και των Συνεταιρισμών! Να  πάρει δηλαδή η αυτοκράτειρα Ευδοξία και το αμπελάκι της χήρας μάνας, ενώ η ίδια δεν ξέρει τι έχει, που το έχει και τι της αποδίδει…  Κλίκ"

Και έχει και πολύ ωραία παραλία οπότε δεν θα χρειάζεται να τρέχεις για τα μπάνια.   Αν θες διαμέρισμα, έχει ποικιλία στο booking.com. Για ξενοδοχείο δεν θα έχεις πρόβλημα και αλλού να ψάξεις πιστεύω.   Τώρα για τα must, εξαρτάτε και με το τι σου αρέσει. Θα έλεγα Σαμαριά αλλά θέλει περπάτημα. Η Ελαφόνησος είναι ότι πρέπει για ημερήσια εκδρομή. Επίσης το Ενετικό λιμάνι και η παλιά πόλη είναι πολύ γραφικά. Κάτι που δεν πρέπει να χάσεις αν σου αρέσουν οι όμορφες παραλίες είναι το να κάνεις εκδρομή σε Γραμβούσα και Μπάλο. Αυτά είναι τα ""must"". Εγώ από Χανιά είμαι, αν έχεις απορίες πες μου."

YV: Yes, absolutely.    HL: ...have preparations been made?  YV: The answer is yes and no. We had a small group, a ‘war cabinet’ within the ministry, of about five people that were doing this: so we worked out in theory, on paper, everything that had to be done [to prepare for/in the event of a Grexit]. But it’s one thing to do that at the level of 4-5 people, it’s quite another to prepare the country for it. To prepare the country an executive decision had to be taken, and that decision was never taken.  HL: And in the past week, was that a decision you felt you were leaning towards [preparing for Grexit]?  YV: My view was, we should be very careful not to activate it. I didn’t want this to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I didn’t want this to be like Nietzsche’s famous dictum that if you stare into the abyss long enough, the abyss will stare back at you. But I also believed that at the moment the Eurogroup shut out banks down, we should energise this process.   HL: Right. So there were two options as far as I can see – an immediate Grexit, or printing IOUs and taking bank control of the Bank of Greece [potentially but not necessarily precipitating a Grexit]?  YV: Sure, sure. I never believed we should go straight to a new currency. My view was – and I put this to the government – that if they dared shut our banks down, which I considered to be an aggressive move of incredible potency, we should respond aggressively but without crossing the point of no return.  We should issue our own IOUs, or even at least announce that we’re going to issue our own euro-denominated liquidity; we should haircut the Greek 2012 bonds that the ECB held, or announce we were going to do it; and we should take control of the Bank of Greece. This was the triptych, the three things, which I thought we should respond with if the ECB shut down our banks.  … I was warning the Cabinet this was going to happen [the ECB shut our banks] for a month, in order to drag us into a humiliating agreement. When it happened – and many of my colleagues couldn’t believe it happened – my recommendation for responding “energetically”, let’s say, was voted down.  HL: And how close was it to happening?  YV: Well let me say that out of six people we were in a minority of two. … Once it didn’t happen I got my orders to close down the banks consensually with the ECB and the Bank of Greece, which I was against, but I did because I’m a team player, I believe in collective responsibility.  And then the referendum happened, and the referendum gave us an amazing boost, one that would have justified this type of energetic response [his plan] against the ECB, but then that very night the government decided that the will of the people, this resounding ‘No’, should not be what energised the energetic approach [his plan].  Instead it should lead to major concessions to the other side: the meeting of the council of political leaders, with our Prime Minister accepting the premise that whatever happens, whatever the other side does, we will never respond in any way that challenges them. And essentially that means folding. … You cease to negotiate."

You can't have a currency union of 20+ states without a true political union with a huge fiscal hammer that can address such problems.  It's clear that this is not the end of the Greek tragedy, and it's obvious to most observers outside the Eurozone that the Member States (especially Germany), the ECB and IMF are all making it up as they go along, and it will bite them hard in the end."

No different to Argentina or Iceland for example. The fact that they are in the Eurozone make this option politically nuclear. But, let's look back a bit...  The economic weakness of Greece and some other EU Member States were also widened due to the single currency, as different countries are not able to use monetary policy as a tool to enact economic policy. Only fiscal policy is left, and there is no real mechanism within the EU to redistribute fiscal stimulus from the strong economies to the weak ones. This is needed for any sufficiently large currency union, such as the United States. Hundreds of billions of Federal dollars are spent on these weaker states, which otherwise would fall behind due to the monetary union.  However, this sort of fiscal hammer is not tenable in the EU due to the amount of political integration that is needed. So, we are stuck..."

Which has been confirmed by the latest deal, that all but force Greece to do the reforms asked by the troika and fast - or be kicked out. The problem is that the EU was not bluffing when saying that, if pushed to the limit, it would choose a grexit over cutting the debt with no reforms. Tsipras bet almost everything on the hope that they were bluffing, and now the country will pay the price."

Complete bullshit from the biggest political liar ever. This is the guy that told Tsipras to hang up the phone on Draghi if he refused to extend ELA. This is the guy  that said that the possibility of ECB pulling the plug on ELA is as probable as the Sun not rising from the east. This is the guy that said that a referendum should not be done as it will be unfair to put the people against such hard dilemmas. This is the guy that wrote extensively that EU will beg us to lend us if we threat with not paying the IMF.  Let's suppose for a minute that he is not lying in this interview by trying to take the blame off his shoulders. According to his own words, he had a great adversary against him with immense political and financial influence in the EU. He is the finance minister, shouldn't he have a plan B? If we was so sure he was being pushed out, why didn't he prepare the day after?  He talks about democracy. It is the democratic mandate of the rest of the EU countries to not give loans to a failed state that placed his proposals out of reality.  Tsipras was a fool ta have trusted him. He made a huge bet an we (all of us) lost everything."

Austerity is a result not a choice (the result of a poor state that cannot service its obligations through tax collection and bond selling).  We can vote for a ""flat earth"" all we want. The earth will remain spherical."
greece,3d59du,kafros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"I couldn't claim to understand the politics behind it.  I am a far-removed American, watching this from a very different perspective from yours.  The democracy thing just jumps out at me.  Enough Greeks voted for Syriza that they formed a government with what seemed to me a mandate and a purpose to negotiate a better deal.  Then the people voted, up or down, on the deal.  It was resoundingly no.  That's democracy.  Now the deal is worse than before, and it's being imposed on them.  It seems punitive, like the rest of Europe is showing what happens when a country votes like they did.  There's nothing democratic about that!"
greece,3d59du,Samuel_L_Bronkowicz,3,Tue Jul 14 09:09:35 2015 UTC,"There are 2 democratic mandates at play: democracy in Greece and democracy between EU countries.  Greek people say EU does not respect democracy. This is false, EU is democratic and 18 countries decided against the requests made by 1 country (Greece).  Now within Greece, the matter is cloudy. People voted Syriza to end austerity. This is like voting for a flat earth, austerity will end when the country produces enough to fund the state via taxing and when the markets' trust at lending us  goes up (at the moment they will lend us at a 30% interest rate).   Then the people voted, up or down, on the deal. It was resoundingly no   People said NO the the deal by 62%. On the polls they say YES to Euro by 70%. These 2 positions are contradicting, if Tsipras says NO to the deal, there is no money from ECB, banks remain closed and we are forced to print drachmas.  So which is the people's mandate? What would you do? (because you can't do both)"
greece,3d59du,kafros,2,Tue Jul 14 09:18:22 2015 UTC,"What Greece is doing is similar to applying to a loan. So let's say you apply to a loan from a bank. You get terms on the loan that you don't like. You talk it over with your family and they say that the terms are too bad and they won't agree to them. You go back to the bank and say: ""we won't agree to these terms"". The bank answers: ""Alright, then you get no loan."" The fact that your family won't agree to the terms of the loan does not entitle you to better terms. The Greek situation is of course a lot more complex, but this is the gist of it.    P.S. Greece is not compelled by any law to agree on the current deal. But if they don't, no bailout. Also, the referendum was a punch in the dick to the whole rest of the Eurozone, they aren't exactly interested in being nice to them just for the sake of it. Syriza has been burning bridges since they were elected, it's half a wonder they are getting anything."
greece,3d59du,WarKiel,5,Tue Jul 14 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"I have heard that also. Truth be told, it was their mistake since the question of the referendum implied alot of things. I believe there were more people that wanted to vote NO and maybe get it close to 70% .  It was clear that he wanted a better deal and the same time not to go to drachma, which was mission impossible. At this point I am very comfused to what I would prefer also. Perhaps we might need some time for things to clear our. But deep inside I feel like leaving the EZ might have been the best solution."
greece,3d59du,zesic,5,Mon Jul 13 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Varoufakis is almost confirming your fears with his new interview in the australian ABC   Αναφέρει συγκεκριμένα: ""Μπήκα στο πρωθυπουργικό γραφείο περιχαρής. Πετούσα στα σύννεφα που έσπρωχναν οι άνεμοι του λαϊκού ενθουσιασμού απ' τη νίκη της ελληνικής δημοκρατίας στο δημοψήφισμα. Μόλις μπήκα στο γραφείο ένιωσα αμέσως μια αίσθηση παραίτησης, μια αρνητικά φορτισμένη ατμόσφαιρα. Ήρθα αντιμέτωπος με ένα ηττοπαθές κλίμα, το οποίο ερχόταν σε πλήρη αντίθεση με ό,τι συνέβαινε έξω. Εκείνη τη στιγμή αναγκάστηκα να πω στον πρωθυπουργό: αν θέλετε να αξιοποιήσετε την έξαψη της δημοκρατίας έξω από αυτό το κτίριο, μπορείτε να βασίζεστε πάνω μου. Αν όμως δεν μπορείτε να διαχειριστείτε αυτό το μεγαλειώδες 'όχι' σε μια μάλλον παράλογη πρόταση των Ευρωπαίων εταίρων μας τότε θα χαθώ μέσα στη νύχτα"" αναφέρει χαρακτηριστικά για τη νύχτα του δημοψηφίσματος""."

Instead of using the No vote as a mandate and a weapon, he did nothing with it and gave Germany pretty much everything they wanted."

All those speeches ""we have nothing to fear but fear itself."" If he wanted the Yes vote he would have simply stepped back and said ""Look this is an issue Greeks need to decide for themselves, so it would be improper for me tell them how to vote"". And he probably would have muzzled whoever he could muzzle, instead of having EVERYONE in SYRIZA on TV every night every channel pushing for No. I think it was his confidence and calm certainty that Greeks should vote No that lead to the huge 61-39 win. Maybe No would have still won if he said nothing, but I am certain it would have been much closer if he let all the Yes propaganda fly unopposed."
greece,3d59du,Apapabo,2,Mon Jul 13 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"It's a tough one for sure, I can see both sides being right.

greece,3d59du,HappilySingleWoman,2,Mon Jul 13 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"I did read a similar rumor right after ""no"" won. But in that case, he was hoping for a ""yes"" win so he could resign and save face, allowing someone else take the heat he is taking now. That doesn't really make sense considering how he campaigned for no, but Syriza has done strange things before."
greece,3d59du,Diveno,2,Tue Jul 14 11:13:26 2015 UTC,"You may be right.  There's nothing new in that thought, though.  A ""No"" vote would require nothing less than the complete willingness to walk away, something that he was always loathe, and in the end unable, to do."

And then explain why his subsequent actions in Brussels were so diametrically opposed to his rhetoric leading up to the No vote. The man had been given a mandate- a NO to austerity. And what he accepted was even worse than what the Greek people said No to.
greece,3d59du,ChuckRW,3,Mon Jul 13 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"I see your point. Indeed the lack of action after the strong No, revealed a lot of things. And the agreement that he brought back is monstrous.

What Greece needs is a break from debt repayments for a few years and some very drastic structural reforms. Taxes need to be at a reasonable level that people at all levels can actually afford. The mechanisms for tracking economic activity and collecting taxes need to be massively improved. The government promotion and protection of uncompetitive activity has to end. The pension system needs to be streamlined... and much more.  The correct role of Europe in this is to back off on collecting and step in to help curb corruption,  but all it seems interested in doing is squeezing blood from a stone and punishing a new generation for the mistakes of the previous one."

greece,3d4cjg,wretched_excess,-3,Mon Jul 13 16:08:21 2015 UTC,The rich isn't necessarily at fault. If it was a rich politician that was involved in the corruption and the awful government management then i concur.  But what about the poor/middle class/rich who evaded tax for years. Always taking cash but paying as little tax as possible.  What about the early retirements and unmarried women having a subsidized monthly income?  The rich isn't to blame for everything. The downfall of a country is because of massive tax evasion and that my friend has occurred on every social/political and demographical level. Poor/middle class/rich have been evading taxes. You must assume this because a country can't become bankrupt without good reason.  I love greece. I went there to see the acropolis. I hope greece will recover fast. But blaming the rich for their problems isn't going to help the country recover. The people who evaded tax know who they are. They should be the ones who pay back the money. But chances are the money has moved overseas or has been spent so that's the real problem. If you want to point the finger then point it at them!  It's easy to blame the rich or foreigners for greece's problem. Because they are easy targets. It's easier to blame somebody else rather than the ones who avoided tax. Those tax avoiders and those who accepted kickbacks/bribes are from poor/middle and rich backgrounds.  The real greeks who got screwed over are those honest greeks who always paid taxes and the young teens who have only just become working age. Those greeks are the ones that deserve better.

Since you're coming during the summer, I'd definitely suggest going to one of the islands. Greece has a huge number of islands, some (like Santorini, Mykonos, Corfu, Milos, Paros) are more popular than the others, but all of them are stunningly beautiful. I myself am a Greek-American and go to an island called Karpathos, in the Dodecanese island chain, as often as I can. It's not as well known and a bit isolated (between Crete and Rhodes) but still very beautiful.

greece,3d4ksn,Ateist,2,Mon Jul 13 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"They were doing what banks do - processing payments, accumulating savings and lending them to businesses for profit. Like any other bank, they would become bankrupt if lots of people would suddenly decide to withdraw their money at the same time.  Normally central banks solve this by giving them overnight loans (at rates higher than they pay on savings). ECB decided to stop doing that, which prompted fears that people wouldn't be able to get their money out of banks - and thus led to the bank runs that we see."

Unless specifically authorized by their government to funds even failed banks, central banks dont simply give money when requested. They asks for collateral, for something that can be kept should the local bank fail to give back the money. The ECB accepted greek bonds or other government-related credits, of which greek banks are full of, as collateral but - unsurprisingly - as the talks were failing those collaterals were more and more worthless. It arrived to the point that the stuff given were not even enough to cover for the loans the ECB already gave them, let alone for new loans. Therefore, it stopped the ELA towards Greek banks. It was not a political decision, it was rule adherence.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-16/draghi-s-rules-tested-by-greece-as-ecb-considers-bank-solvency"
greece,3d4ksn,Aeliandil,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"ELA never stopped.  What really stopped was: the ECB decided, due to the current economic and political situation in Greece, that the obligations emitted by the Greek Treasure were no longer acceptable as collateral for loans, as they were too risky. Greek banks, which were buying these obligations (more or less forced), were therefore no longer enabled to get fund from the ECB/the Central Bank of Greece. As such, they were forced to use the ELA system, which is more permissive when it comes to collateral.  However, due to the degrading political situation (Greece being broke and refusing to make a deal, securing money to repay its incoming credits), people get more and more worried and start withdrawing money from banks. Which, in turns, ask to the ECB to raise the level of the ELA's. ECB was like ""you're mad or what? Your situation is degrading, I should no longer allow you to use the ELA system. But I don't want you to collapse so I'll still allow you to use even though it's borderline for me; but there is no way I'm raising the maximum level"". So even right now, the ELA is still working.  Thus creating the capital control measures imposed by the Greek government to avoid a rush-to-the-banks from Greek citizens."

greece,3d4ksn,Origami84,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"An highly politicized piece, that takes no account of reality. The EU did the impossible to reach a deal, so much that even after months of fruitless talks, even after a confrontational Syriza government, even after the expiration of the deadline and a referendum that clearly opposed the deal, they were still ready to go back to a table and try to find a deal. How can one describe all that with:   The fact that a formal Grexit may have been avoided for the moment is immaterial. Grexit will be back on the table when you have the slightest political accident   I call bullshit. And, since the markets is not populated by idiots, i call bullshit on the fact that now everyone suddenly thinks that EU countries will drop left and right. Hell, italian here, our bonds dropped a solid 0.3% in one hour followin the deal. Investors knows that there are pratical, real limits over which a country would just say ""no"" and get out or push another one out of the EU. Thats not new to anyone. What mattered is the limit you had to push the EU or a country to do such a thing, and here we have an EU that went to absurd lenght, new 83billions loan included, to keep Greece in and Greece that is now facing immediate and uinpopular reforms plus a 180° turn on a week old referendum just to stay in. Which investors would see all that as a sign that exit from the EU is now assured at the first hardship? Bah -.-"

greece,3d8cha,rondabyarmbar,3,Tue Jul 14 10:21:03 2015 UTC,"TBH all the replies you have received are either horrible, laughable, or both.  Here is my take:   The same measures under a New Democracy government would have cause widespread protests and yes, riots.  The previous governments presented an almost caricature-ish easy enemy. Right-wing, conservative, extremely authoritarian and brutal in their use of the police to suppress protests. People were ANGRY, and when you have a clear enemy openly opposing you you get ANGRIER. And believe me there were massive protests, a lot of teargassing, a shitton of beatings.  Then you had the elections where SYRIZA got elected. That was a release valve of some sort, people actually saw a change from the old PASOK-ND back and forth, people actually thought SOMETHING might change. A lot of people aligned with the left, even if they didn't support SYRIZA felt sort of an obligation to have a ""leftisT"" government make a good impression, others truly thought we should wait and see and hoped for something different.  Then we had the negotiations which muddled the waters and from BIG BAD GOVERNMENT vs The Working Class, the fight broke down into several other confusing issues. Europe vs Greece, no, Europe vs the Greek Left, no Germany vs France and Greece, no, the creditors vs Europe vs the IMF, n,o it's not THEIR fault it's THAT dude's fault, no wait they were right on this and that but wrong on the other, and so on and so forth.  As the negotiations approached ""New Measures or Grexit"" levels, shit got even more confusing because an exit from the EZ was the great unknown, even if you supported it, you didn't REALLY KNOW what would happen and how it would go down, whether it would ruin you or offer some long-term benefits.  And finally the referendum which to a significant extent diffused responsibility. It created a feeling that we were all responsible, not just the government. And there were bitter arguments and fights, the ""YES""es vs the ""NO""s. And now a deal which is basically ""YES PLEASE CAN I HAVE SOME MORE SIR"", while the message was a clear ""NO"" which leaves everyone confused.  If you were supporting a ""YES"" you were probably spewing bile against SYRIZA, but now you got the deal you wanted, only a bit worse though, but is the EZ to blame or SYRIZA?  If you were supporting a ""NO"" you think you got sold out, but did SYRIZA give it a shot and failed, or were they useless? Are the creditors to blame, the ""YES"" faction in Greece, SYRIZA's spinelessness or perhaps you even think that ok we tried but shouldn't risk a Grexit.  So it's a combination of being worn out, confused, tired, beaten down, worried about practical matters, feeling some loose allegiance to the ""left"", unsure about what the alternative should be, and a general disillusionment with the whole politics thing.  IMHO.  tl;dr: Riot FOR WHAT?"

greece,3d8cha,basketballfan14,5,Tue Jul 14 08:55:12 2015 UTC,"Well, a few years ago there was a romanian referendum where 7.5 million (88%) people voted yes in order to get the president to quit it's job. This was because of the austerity measures he and his government (he had majority) took on our country. He ignored our referendum.  Then we all went into the streets. Millions literally were on streets all over the country. We destroyed buildings, we fought with the police and when military stated they will protect it's people in our fight vs the police troops the whole government abdicted.   3 years from that moment and we are great economically and only in the past 7 months 5500 people are arrested at home or in jail for corruption charges (all 5500 are influencing people in my country). Now even the PM was convicted of 3 corruption charges.

Ειδικά αφού οι υπέρμαχοι της δραχμής στην Ελλάδα είναι ανοιχτοί στην έξοδο από τη ΕΕ.  Ένα βασικό πλεονέκτημα της συμμετοχής στην Ευρωζώνη είναι η βελτίωση του βιοτικού επιπέδου. Δεν μιλάω τα τελευταία 5 χρόνια, αλλά από τη συνθήκη του Μάαστριχτ και μετά. Δεν έχει νόημα να μην χρειάζεσαι βίζα για να ταξιδέψεις στο εξωτερικό αν χρειάζεσαι μισθούς έτους, ή να μπορείς να εισάγεις χωρίς δασμούς όταν δεν μπορείς να καταναλώσεις.  Το γεγονός ότι η δομή της ευρωζώνης είναι προβληματική, δεν σημαίνει απαραίτητα ότι θα καταρρεύσει. Είναι επίσης πιθανό ότι θα βελτιωθεί.  Το πολιτικό σύστημα στην Ελλάδα είναι ανεπαρκές. Άρα πώς πιστεύουμε ότι θα μπορέσει να διαχειριστεί τη δραχμή πιο αποτελεσματικά απ' ότι στο παρελθόν. Χαρακτηριστικά, όσοι πολιτικοί υποστηρίζουν την δραχμή δεν έχουν συγκεκριμένο σχέδιο επιστροφής ή δομής της οικονομίας. Δεν αναφέρω καν τα οικονομικά επιχειρήματα υπέρ του ευρώ."

Αν αυτή τη φορά μαζί με τα μέτρα, κάνουμε και τα κατάλληλα βήματα (αναδιάρθρωση δημοσίου, αποκρατικοποιήσεις κτλ) σίγουρα θα δούμε αποτελέσματα.

Πέντε χρόνια λιτότητας δεν ήταν αρκετά για να αποδείξουν την αναποτελεσματικότητα της, με την μείωση του 25% του ΑΕΠ, την ανεργία να φτάνει το 27% και την ανεργία των νέων το 60%, με αυτοκτονίες ανθρώπων που περιήλθαν σε οικονομικά αδιέξοδα, με παιδιά να πάνε στο σχολείο νηστικά και αλλά πολλά.Πέρα από οικονομικές αρχίζουν να δημιουργούνται και ηθικές και ανθρωπιστικές αμφιβολίες.  Η δραχμή τουλάχιστον αποτελούσε ένα βήμα προς την εθνική κυριαρχία και στην μακροπρόθεσμη ανάπτυξη και ευημερία.Επίσης, ας θυμηθούμε ότι το 2009 τα ίδια πράγματα λεγόντουσαν για τις καταστροφικές συνέπειες της δραχμής και χρεοκοπίας, και μετά από 6 χρόνια λέμε πως θα ήταν καλύτερα εάν είχαμε γυρίσει πίσω στην δραχμή τότε."

That is a myth. Greece can't sustain its current food consumption profile based on internal production, but that is true for virtually any country on earth. Every country imports food that they can not produce (e.g. bananas in Finland). Calorically speaking, Greece is more than able to feed about double its population (maybe triple or quadruple once the agriculture sector has been optimized for food production) given than enough oil and insecticide is imported."

Several attempts in the past failed utterly and/or dismounted themselves (Russia, Cuba, Israel, German anti-capitalistic communes). There was no need for capitalist aggression or not allowing it. As Kenneth Galbraith put it: ""Capitalism is the exploitation of a man by another. Communism is the other way around"". You can apply it to anti-capitalism here.  You may blame the people for this fault, and attempt it another time. Having lived in a communist country in the past I can assure you: you will fail."

And saying there's no agression towards non-capitalist regimes is just a plain out lie.   edit: just look at new latin-american governments that are trying to improve democracy and equality (especially venezuela). US' agression towards hugo chavez was ridiculous. There were countless attempts to undermine chavez, who was trying to establish a more controlled economy and democratic society.  The EU towards greece isn't as extreme as that, but pushing privatizations onto Greece will give the EU and more importantly private organizations in the EU more power."

Don't try to read someone else's mind, or you risk going wrong.   My point is: it is not about capitalist vs non-capitalist ideology. The aggressions or interventions against communist states were driven by plain interests of power and more concrete/tangible gains.

With a lot weaker economy they managed to have the same life expectancy, and more importantly, it's free and everyone has access. Yes they're not as rich, but for a country that got embargoed, and slandered by the US up until very recently, they did pretty ok. Just to say that regimes that aren't as neo-liberal or capitalist as the EU/US can work, and have more equality along the way than any of the capitalist countries.    The aggressions or interventions against communist states were driven by plain interests of power and more concrete/tangible gains.    definitely, it's never an attack against the less-capitalist regime because of ideology, in fact, they promote democracy to an extent but ONLY if it aligns with their needs, which most of the time it doesn't. (few examples: iraq: before their war against saddam they actively supported him and a tyrannical regime, haiti they removed democratically elected governments, when hamas won in gaza's democratic election in 2006 ( i think) and it didn't turn out how they liked, israel (who's ofcourse armed and subsidized by the us) ramped up agression)."

greece,3d5z3d,RAndrewOhge,0,Mon Jul 13 20:03:47 2015 UTC,"The Problem of Greece Is Not Only a Tragedy. It Is a Lie  By John Pilger, Global Research, July 13, 2015  Url of this article: http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-problem-of-greece-is-not-only-a-tragedy-it-is-a-lie/5462175 greece  An historic betrayal has consumed Greece.  Having set aside the mandate of the Greek electorate, the Syriza government has willfully ignored last week’s landslide “No” vote and secretly agreed a raft of repressive, impoverishing measures in return for a “bailout” that means sinister foreign control and a warning to the world.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pushed through parliament a proposal to cut at least 13 billion euros from the public purse – 4 billion euros more than the “austerity” figure rejected overwhelmingly by the majority of the Greek population in a referendum on 5 July.  These reportedly include a 50 per cent increase in the cost of healthcare for pensioners, almost 40 per cent of whom live in poverty; deep cuts in public sector wages; the complete privatization of public facilities such as airports and ports; a rise in value added tax to 23 per cent, now applied to the Greek islands where people struggle to eke out a living.  There is more to come.  “Anti-austerity party sweeps to stunning victory”, declared aGuardian headline on January 25.  “Radical leftists” the paper called Tsipras and his impressively-educated comrades.  They wore open neck shirts, and the finance minister rode a motorbike and was described as a “rock star of economics”.  It was a façade.  They were not radical in any sense of that cliched label, neither were they “anti austerity”.  For six months Tsipras and the recently discarded finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, shuttled between Athens and Brussels, Berlin and the other centres of European money power.  Instead of social justice for Greece, they achieved a new indebtedness, a deeper impoverishment that would merely replace a systemic rottenness based on the theft of tax revenue by the Greek super-wealthy – in accordance with European “neo-liberal” values — and cheap, highly profitable loans from those now seeking Greece’s scalp.  Greece’s debt, reports an audit by the Greek parliament, “is illegal, illegitimate and odious”.  Proportionally, it is less than 30 per cent that of the debit of Germany, its major creditor.  It is less than the debt of European banks whose “bailout” in 2007-8 was barely controversial and unpunished.  For a small country such as Greece, the euro is a colonial currency: a tether to a capitalist ideology so extreme that even the Pope pronounces it “intolerable” and “the dung of the devil”.  The euro is to Greece what the US dollar is to remote territories in the Pacific, whose poverty and servility is guaranteed by their dependency.  In their travels to the court of the mighty in Brussels and Berlin, Tsipras and Varoufakis presented themselves neither as radicals nor “leftists” nor even honest social democrats, but as two slightly upstart supplicants in their pleas and demands.  Without underestimating the hostility they faced, it is fair to say they displayed no political courage.  More than once, the Greek people found out about their “secret austerity plans” in leaks to the media: such as a 30 June letter published in the Financial Times, in which Tsipras promised the heads of the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF to accept their basic, most vicious demands – which he has now accepted.  When the Greek electorate voted “no” on 5 July to this very kind of rotten deal, Tsipras said, “Come Monday and the Greek government will be at the negotiating table after the referendum with better terms for the Greek people”.  Greeks had not voted for “better terms”.  They had voted for justice and for sovereignty, as they had done on January 25.  The day after the January election a truly democratic and, yes, radical government would have stopped every euro leaving the country, repudiated the “illegal and odious” debt – as Argentina did successfully — and expedited a plan to leave the crippling Eurozone.  But there was no plan. There was only a willingness to be “at the table” seeking “better terms”.  The true nature of Syriza has been seldom examined and explained.  To the foreign media it is no more than “leftist” or “far left” or “hardline” – the usual misleading spray.  Some of Syriza’s international supporters have reached, at times, levels of cheer leading reminiscent of the rise of Barack Obama.  Few have asked: Who are these “radicals”?  What do they believe in?  In 2013, Yanis Varoufakis wrote:  “Should we welcome this crisis of European capitalism as an opportunity to replace it with a better system?  Or should we be so worried about it as to embark upon a campaign for stabilising capitalism?  To me, the answer is clear.  Europe’s crisis is far less likely to give birth to a better alternative to capitalism ...  “I bow to the criticism that I have campaigned on an agenda founded on the assumption that the left was, and remains, squarely defeated .... Yes, I would love to put forward [a] radical agenda. But, no, I am not prepared to commit the [error of the British Labour Party following Thatcher’s victory].  “What good did we achieve in Britain in the early 1980s by promoting an agenda of socialist change that British society scorned while falling headlong into Thatcher’s neoliberal trip? Precisely none. What good will it do today to call for a dismantling of the Eurozone, of the European Union itself ...?”  Varoufakis omits all mention of the Social Democratic Party that split the Labour vote and led to Blairism. In suggesting people in Britain “scorned socialist change” – when they were given no real opportunity to bring about that change – he echoes Blair.  The leaders of Syriza are revolutionaries of a kind – but their revolution is the perverse, familiar appropriation of social democratic and parliamentary movements by liberals groomed to comply with neo-liberal drivel and a social engineering whose authentic face is that of Wolfgang Schauble, Germany’s finance minister, an imperial thug.  Like the Labour Party in Britain and its equivalents among those former social democratic parties still describing themselves as “liberal” or even “left”, Syriza is the product of an affluent, highly privileged, educated middle class, “schooled in postmodernism”, as Alex Lantier wrote.  For them, class is the unmentionable, let alone an enduring struggle, regardless of the reality of the lives of most human beings.  Syriza’s luminaries are well-groomed; they lead not the resistance that ordinary people crave, as the Greek electorate has so bravely demonstrated, but “better terms” of a venal status quo that corrals and punishes the poor.  When merged with “identity politics” and its insidious distractions, the consequence is not resistance, but subservience.  “Mainstream” political life in Britain exemplifies this.  This is not inevitable, a done deal, if we wake up from the long, postmodern coma and reject the myths and deceptions of those who claim to represent us, and fight.

When they did, he was prepared to do three things: issue euro-denominated IOUs; apply a “haircut” to the bonds Greek issued to the ECB in 2012, reducing Greece’s debt; and seize control of the Bank of Greece from the ECB.  None of the moves would constitute a Grexit but they would have threatened it. Varoufakis was confident that Greece could not be expelled by the Eurogroup; there is no legal provision for such a move. But only by making Grexit possible could Greece win a better deal. And Varoufakis thought the referendum offered Syriza the mandate they needed to strike with such bold moves – or at least to announce them.  He hinted at this plan on the eve of the referendum, and reports later suggested this was what cost him his job.   And he was right... no bargaining power leads to this shit deal y'all got now."

The  extension of the second bailout, when Varoufakis told his people to leave in the middle of technical negotiations, and called a referendum, required €15B.  The new deal today asks the lenders for €85B.  That's the difference.    On top of that, the new agreement has to go through all national parliaments, whereas the extension of the old one was much easier to pass.  And after the past few months, especially the walking out on the negotiations, holding a fake ""referendum"" one week after the final deadline, the government telling the people to vote against a bailout.   It's hard to believe that they are now going to actually honor the agreements. That's why the lenders expect Greece to do reforms before they get new money.

greece,3d3u2p,Mradragon,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:49 2015 UTC,where did you get that from? What I read said it will be sold and then 50% go to debt payments and 50% will go to bank recapitalization+'development' (aka bribes)
greece,3d3u2p,gorat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:32:30 2015 UTC,"Essentially the way I understand it, like warkiel said is that it is a form of collateral. So it will be privatised yes, but slowly. If there are cash problems though, it may very well be handed over to the creditors. Will have to see the exact terms they sign to figure it out though so nothing is fact yet."
greece,3d3u2p,Mradragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:06:37 2015 UTC,With the prices as they are in Greece right now it will be sold in a fraction of its value. There will be cash problems because there always are because the whole program is made by people that have not lived in Greece for a single day.

I think the people are waking up to the reality of what is our position in the EU as it is right now and if we need to be part of the Empire or not.
greece,3d3u2p,gorat,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"Part of the conditions of the previous Greek Bailout was the privatization of public enterprises, which hasn't been done yet.   Now the EU governments have no trust in Greece, or their ability to follow a program or execute it. Therefore they are demanding that the ownership of the assets be transferred out of the Greek State into a trust fund, that will proceed to privatize it under joint supervision of the Euromembers and Greece.   Those assets, that is, shares of power companies and the like, WILL be sold, and their proceeds will go to pay back the debt (50%), 25% to recapitalize Greek Banks, and 25% for investments in development. This was a concession obtained by Tsipras. The original plan was that 100% of the sale would go against the debt."

greece,3d3xwo,StratosB,3,Mon Jul 13 11:22:44 2015 UTC,Not finished reading it yet. What a fucking tragedy of asset stripping. From page 4:   to develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means. The monetization of the assets will be one source to make the scheduled repayment of the new loan of ESM and generate over the life of the new loan a targeted total of EUR 50bn of which EUR 25bn will be used for the repayment of recapitalization of banks   Thanks for the link vangelisc. Good work on your part.
greece,3d3xwo,xdyev,5,Mon Jul 13 09:44:46 2015 UTC,"There had been a semi-independent fund already. This just pushes the rationale of privatisations; the issue is whether you think privatisations can help or not. That said, channel 4 news' Paul Mason suggested that there might not be assets worth 50bn in the Greek economy.  The great challenge of the agreement, it seems to me, is the time limits. Both in terms of practicalities, but also in terms of political justification."

greece,3d3xwo,Mandurang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:07:28 2015 UTC,"Guardian reported that Tsipras was pushing for a 17bn ceiling; and that IMF thought that 7bn was the more likely figure. If anything the wording says ""up to"" 50 bn assets, so I think the IMF figure is the most likely."
greece,3d3xwo,Mandurang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:58:20 2015 UTC,"he monetization of the assets will be one source to make the scheduled repayment of the new loan of ESM   I think that's the crucial part. Unless that's wishful thinking on my part, the way I read it is that in case you can't pay back the ESM loan, the fund will activate. I think until then it won't manage the assets at all, in the sense that it won't try and sell them or make investments with them before the conditions of repayment aren't met. I guess it remains to be seen what kind of loan is that ESM one. Generally ECB and EFSF loans have long maturities which make them a little better.   Also, Hollande has confirmed that the Greek agreement will include an eventual re-profiling of Greek debt by extending the maturities. I hope I can read somewhere about that. This is an essential debt restructure and might be the most important victory for Syriza."

greece,3d1ee2,inopia,14,Sun Jul 12 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"The deal has gotten worse because in the last two weeks the Greek economy has gotten a lot worse (banks closed and all that). This means Greece now needs a lot more money. Before, they were negotiating about the last part of the second bail out, worth 15 billion. Since that has failed, Greece now needs a new, third bailout, to the tune of around 100 billion."

The  extension of the second bailout, when Varoufakis told his people to leave in the middle of technical negotiations, and called a referendum, required €15B.  The new deal asks the lenders for €85B.  That's the difference.    On top of that, the new agreement has to go through all national parliaments, whereas the extension of the old one was much easier to pass.  And after the past few months, especially the walking out on the negotiations, holding a fake ""referendum"" one week after the final deadline, the government telling the people to vote against a bailout.   It's hard to believe that they are now going to actually honor the agreements. That's why the lenders expect Greece to do reforms before they get new money.

The Germans aren't constrained by the Greek people's vote in regards to how they'll use their money or what deals they'll offer.  The Greek referendum vote is supposed to be a constrain on what the Greek government is allowed to do, and it's the Greek government that is violating the Greek referendum vote.

If it had said ""Yes"" before all its shenanigans the Eurozone would have been united to help it avoid a Grexit. But now it did the exact steps that lead to the Eurozone is divided, with nations taking sides against nations.  Who benefits from division in Europe? Russia does.

greece,3d3s2y,ATG_is_MLG,3,Mon Jul 13 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"i haven't looked at the agreement, but here is a viewpoint:  There is an external and an internal  field.  Internally, it helped bring the opposition parties in line. It solidified the fact that the majority of Greeks are behind the government going in and continuing negotiations instead of ""capitulating"" (whatever that means), despite a massive campaign led by the opposition. It's like the opposition lost the elections again in the space of six months. Think the ""No"" vote as a vote of confidence for Syriza.   The leader of the largest center-right party (ND) resigned after the referendum, leaving the strongest opposition party headless and in disarray. A ""Yes"" vote would probably lead the government to resign and we would end up with elections and the same ND people all over again.   Then, Tsipras got the (original) negotiation proposal  approved by a wide parliamentary majority  (except for the usual suspects i.e. Communists, Golden Dawn, etc) meaning that they couldn't go around and say it was unilaterally agreed, etc.   Externally, this means that (apart from the usual suspects) the parliament has already pre-approved like 80% of a potential deal and commits to supporting it (instead of complaining about it being imposed by Syriza etc). One can show up in a negotiation and say ""see, we got most of these things already approved , the opposition will play along when we go to vote them in"". So it's a plus.  EDIT: Also, the vote of confidence shows that popular support for Syriza is not a fluke, meaning that there is no serious opposition party or parties that could potentially replace Syriza - all ""cooperative"" political forces are out of the game, and a solution must be found with these guys. Essentially, it showed that regime change is not possible, and if it were, it would not be viable. It's either working with the Syriza people or chaos.  EDIT2: Usage  I don't know if it was planned, but this is how it seems to have worked out so far."

greece,3d0q8x,cheesecheese,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"But the U.S. proposed haircuts on debt payments, as did the IMF (which is largely U.S. controlled.) They actually pushed out the IMF's involvement more during the agreement, imo, largely for this reason. This had more to do with northern European states and Germany than the U.S. If Greece left the EU, the ECB would have punished them to make an example of them, if they stayed the EU was going to best them. It was a no win for Greece, I think in the long run a Grexit would have been better but tossing your country into chaos and having the region's largest central bank against you is not a good position either."
greece,3d0q8x,partiallypro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:58:50 2015 UTC,Either way the US was strongly against Greece leaving the eurozone and publicly stated so. I'm mystified about calling that referendum - I suspect the US may have had more of a role than is publicly known in the complete U-turn of the Greek government - I'm sure very few people actually know for sure right now.       It looks certain that Germany called Greece's bluff about a euro exit -  they were fine with it. The United States was not.
greece,3d0q8x,cheesecheese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:13:36 2015 UTC,I think the U.S. probably sees a Grexit as damaging Nato and bolstering Russia; but if the U.S. had its way in the negotiations Greece would have received debt haircuts.

But the problem isnt solvency, the problem is liquidity.  There are literally not enough physical euro bills in Greece to cover demand. Hence capital controls. This can happen to any country and this is what will happen when there is a bank run.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run  A bank run is when the people panic and demand to withdraw their money immediately. Even if a bank is perfectly healthy(and let's not kid ourselves, the greek banks arent), it will face a serious problem, it wont have enough actual money to pay all those people. Because their money will be ""tied up"" in loans, etc.  If you have your own currency and your own central bank, this isnt really an issue, you just print more(which can create other issues but at least you dont have a liquidity issue). But if you dont have your own currency and your own central bank(you have to rely on ECB), then you are kinda fucked.   In order to protect your money from such an incident you either dont have them in a bank(you can keep them under the mattress) or you put them in a banking system that is least likely to have such an issue(ie german bank). That's why there is a huge flee of capital from other countries and towards Germany. It is safer there."

greece,3d0ngv,swedishtaco,7,Sun Jul 12 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's true. Greek orthodox priests are salaried from the government. It was part of an agreement between the greek government and the greek orthodox church, that was agreed upon in exchange for a major part of real-estate the church turned over to the state. This is one of the reasons the separation of church and state is more complicated. It would mean that the state would go back on the contract."

greece,3d0ngv,gournian,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"It was a complicated situation that prompted it. Greece had come out of a war. The Greek state had been expropriating church land ever since 1844. Back in 1952 when this deal was struck human rights and separation of church and state was at the stage of infancy. So, the then government took on the responsibility of paying the salary of ministers and church personell and the church gave away huge chunks of land it inherited either from the Ottoman period or by people."
greece,3d0ngv,sherlock234,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:51 2015 UTC,It was a deal after the deportation from Turkey of people 1/3 the size of Greece. When arrived in Greece the government had nowhere to put them and used the huge church estate. The church argued that it used that estate to pay for the priests so the government got that cost.
greece,3d0ngv,Mminas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this was not the only occasion the state had expropriated the church's properties. The first expropriation happened during Otto's regency period. Many followed because Greece kept expanding. The 1952 deal was meant to solve the issue once and for all."
greece,3d0ngv,sherlock234,0,Sun Jul 12 23:51:44 2015 UTC,All priests are salaried by the government not only orthodox ones. Rabbis and Imams and any type of priest that has an ample body of faithful is salaried by the Greek state.
greece,3d0ngv,merhandus,3,Sun Jul 12 16:43:31 2015 UTC,Nope. That's inaccurate. There's the posibillity that the government can hire imams in muslim schools in Thraki to teach the q'ran to muslim greeks. This became a law in 2013. Rabbis as far as i know are NOT public servants nor do they get paid by the government. If you know something different concerning rabbis please provide a link or a source. The greek orthodox priests became public servants after the 1952 agreement was enacted by law.
greece,3d0ngv,Anwnymia,6,Sun Jul 12 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"It is correct and whats more, there is a also a custom of giving em money before or after marriages and other important services.  I personally believe that the state never properly separated from the church in greece.  We are a very conservative nation , maybe in 20-30 years the newer generations could pass more liberal proposals on the church matter ( like taxing em, they are the biggest landowners afterall )."

greece,3d0ngv,care_about,-7,Sun Jul 12 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"First I want to state that I am am an agnostic and don't support the church in any way, but you have to understand that without the church there would be no Greece! The Church is where all the Greeks met for protection to plan and coordinate there independence from Ottoman rule, and the church is one of the many things that unites us with Russia who ultimately sent down it's navy to protect the the new founded Greece from the turks. Not to mention the priest fighters role in the independence itself. Even though it could be argued that if it were not for christianity and the archbishop/Emporor over stretching it's and continues hold on palestine, Byzantium would have never fallen in the first place to the, Venetian and the last crusade, witch ultimately led to it's week position and finally falling to the Mongols/turks, who otherwise would not stand a chance of defeating the Greeks."
greece,3d0ngv,anabolic,7,Sun Jul 12 16:51:52 2015 UTC,This is not the reason they are salaried though. The reason they are salaried is because Greece needed land for immigrants coming in from Ionia (West Turkey).

I stopped watching Greek TV after I saw how they all suddenly stopped giving a damn about being neutral and not spreading fud before the referendum, ERT, the public TV station is essentially forced to invite representatives of all sides at the same time so unavoidably several verbal fights take place live on air.   I don't know why the media become such a huge echo chamber every time the crisis in Greece is a hot topic again.  I'm starting to doubt the understanding of politics people reporting on the events have, because to state that Germany as a whole wants Greece out of the EZ just to have it disproven the day after either means that they didn't understand half the statements or purposely ignored them.

greece,3cyvse,Divine2012,4,Sun Jul 12 10:05:15 2015 UTC,"My mother believes that Greece should have never joined the EU(she predicted that it would destroy Greece) and they should leave at any cost as soon as possible. She thinks someone should KILL Merkel(however, I think someone is behind Merkel, so I don't entirely blame her the way my mother does), but she does admit that Greece had a great deal of corruption on ALL levels. People were evading taxes? According to her, a lot of tax dollars went to Swiss Bank Accounts. Want to pay taxes to THAT?   She admits that bribes were a problem and she didn't seem to like that anyone OTHER than the spouse of a worker should get any kind of pension. I'm not sure how she saw public sector jobs or retirement(the age 50 thing is BS, btw). But, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if it turns out that only the upper management got ""paid too much.""   She's disgusted with austerity and not happy with more of it. The people who will suffer the most will be the ones who have the least amount of power(I have always seen it this way). She's actually relieved that HER mother died last year rather than suffer even further with MORE cuts.  My cousin(who cared for my grandmother) is unable to find ANY job and currently lives on eggs(and NO she does not live on any kind of government money). MORE austerity will make her situation worse. She talks to my mother often because it keeps her sane. She is also VERY unhappy with what is going on now. However, I don't know how she feels about a Greek exit.  Most of the elders in my family are dead and they died right before all this happened. I hope the rest of my family is doing okay, but I can't really speak for them. I don't know if any of them are right-winged, left-winged or eat hot wings. All I know is that the poorest workers(you know, the class that certain people tend to believe deserve to pay the highest price and suffer low standards of living) will not likely benefit from any kind of bailout and even if they do, it'll be scraps(as usual).  As for me, I am pissed, depressed, and feel like something happened on the inside for Syriza to do something like this. I just don't know. I guess I'm afraid too because my mother plans on going back there. Oh, she owns land there, but she might as well napalm it considering what's going on now.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go stick my head in the sand, play video games, and get caught up with Berserk sometime this century."

My beliefs are genuine in preserving Greece as a modern country. If you want to make smug comments then realize that this thread is enough to actually sway my decision. Debate with my friends that Greece needs to exit and suffer or go on austerity and suffer.  First, this doesn't happen only on TV or in video games. RIGHT?!?! This has happened so much in history it is ridiculous. Ottoman Empire, British Empire, The Lousiana Purchase, The Annexation of Texas, War with Mexico and subsequent purchase of land, Division of Canada and US at the 49th parallel, Manifest Destiny, WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Alaska, Hawaii, South Pacific Sea at this very moment. This list has no end. So your first and second statements are both LOGICALLY VOID since you failed to even consider this history (maybe they don't teach anything in Greece which would make sense) has happened and that you can't know naivete since you are naive yourself.  Second, Greece has no options anymore, you culture and stubbornness probably will forbid any help from investors outside of Russia and China because believe it or not investors wants people that they can trust and explore options with, for investors to let Greece fall already speaks volumes if they are willing to abandon 300billion in debt. Now you laugh off the idea of a US intervention or temporary mandate lol. Albania and Bulgaria doesn't have the same connection with citizens in he US.  Third, thank you for the ridicule; enjoy watching your country get smashed into oblivion by EU cronies as your populations sits helpless because well since ""Ancient Greece"" stopped existing nothing in Greece has really been achieved. You could go back to the drachma but WAIT you can't afford to do the conversions back because your government never even had the foresight to maintain and independent drachma incase, LOL.

greece,3cyvse,buymydebt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"First the world isn't democratic because most countries and states function as a Republic, the EU mimicks a Republic. You don't get equal representation nor does your government have to listen to you. YOU ARE A REPUBLIC. The world just exists in a high variety of governmental forms.  Second, You are Greek, that is not a race therefore it cannot be racism. Maybe you meant to say biased or bigoted, however, it does seem that Greece has a problem with definitions regardless!  Third, Citizens can be bought and purchased as stipulated in many documents. Prisoners have less rights and can be sold based on legal laws in certain countries. Ever hear of Human-Trafficking? That's the illegal part.  Fourth Countries are bought and sold or influenced, welcome to history.  But what the hell do I know. I've only lived in 3 countries and have a legal degree from the EU and another degree from the US, study finance and study fiscally historical events. STOOPID ME.  And seriously his golf swing was the best he ever did. One time I wrote out a Sorenson Dice and Jaccard Index in logic form so he could code it in and grab some stats for me. He actually thought he did it himself. It was so cute to watch took him like 2 weeks. All the code was available and i gave him the logic should have taken 2hrs. - stopped him from bothering me for a few weeks."

greece,3cyvse,buymydebt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:45 2015 UTC,No i meant purchased. There are ZERO rules saying we can purchase you. You can view purchase in any form in which you please to convey the expense of monetary vehicles in return for rights over land/sovereign.  Just because you haven't seen something happen doesn't mean it can't. For example - GREECE joined the EUROZONE in 2001. NO COUNTRY HAS EVER LEFT THE EUROZONE since that doesn't mean that COUNTRIES CANT leave the EUROZONE. It is just a fallacy of logic. Sure Greece can leave - you might even get kicked out.

A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.  This process, while not new to the Information Age, has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as Wikipedia, Yahoo! Answers, Quora, and other web resources that rely on human opinion.   Trial by jury can be understood as wisdom of the crowd, especially when compared to the alternative, trial by a judge, the single expert.

greece,3cydoi,TehAlex94,3,Sat Jul 11 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"So let me make sure I have all this straight. First Greece defaulted, but agreed to hold a referendum to approve or deny their creditors proposed austerity measures in exchange for another loan, the EU and the IMF agreed to wait until the referendum was held. The Greeks ended up voting no on the referendum, and proposed a new deal (I assume with better terms for Greece) which the Greek parliment approved. Now you have to wait on the EU to vote on Greece's proposal. What has the rest of the EU been up to between the last referendum and this one? Just letting the debt sit while they negotiate or is Greece still in default?"
greece,3cydoi,SaiXx,8,Sat Jul 11 22:42:22 2015 UTC,"the new deal is worse than the one we rejected, which is why what's happening right now is very weird, and a lot of people are angry."
greece,3cydoi,theronaz,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:43 2015 UTC,Are the terms worse because voting no on the referendum was a mistake and now they are trying to gain favor with their creditors?

greece,3cydoi,thelamogio1,8,Sat Jul 11 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"The terms are (mostly) worse because the new deal is supposed to include a debt restructuring and therefore they propose worse terms in order to balance that. In short, yes it is more austerity that the Junker proposed one(the one the referendum was called on) but it (supposedly) makes up for it with restructuring.   However, despite Greece proposing even more austerity Germany and Finland are still hesitant to go forth with it...we shal see what the future holds, it looks very bleak atm"
greece,3cydoi,TeamArrow,7,Sat Jul 11 23:20:13 2015 UTC,Actually the new deal is better IF the creditors agree to cut (or at least restructure) the debt. The previous deal was not that cruel but it just extended a hopeless financial situation AKA kicking the can. With the previous deal we would get some money for the time being but the massive debt would remain. Also the new deal does not include the IMF (they only offer some technical advice) which is good.
greece,3cydoi,n8u,0,Sat Jul 11 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"What Greece needs is debt restructuring. Instead what the Greek government proposed was stricter terms in order to balance it, but it will backfire as austerity isn't good for bleeding economies."

greece,3cydoi,mvlazysusan,3,Sun Jul 12 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"What has the rest of the EU been up to between the last referendum and this one? Just letting the debt sit while they negotiate or is Greece still in default?   The referendum was on Sunday. Greece presented its official proposal on Friday. EU has been debating on the weekend.   I think there's also suspicion that despite the fact that EU likes the deal Greece presented on paper they are not sure if they can trust it since:   1.) The Greeks previously voted no on pretty similar reforms (the thing put forth in the referendum contains many of the same things that Greece presented on Friday)  2.) The previous Greek government also seemed to have a strategy where they would nominally agree to terms and then just not go through with them. And that was the right/centrist government, not one that intentionally ran on anti-austerity.   Maybe there is fear that just because Greece proposed these things, who says that they are actually going to do it instead of just taking the money and not doing anything? That seems to be Germany's worry at least, how to create oversight (which of course in turn is probably pretty insulting to the Greeks).   Then there's also the problem that the money support of Greece is actually pretty unpopular with a lot of the European population, so a lot of governments are actually acting against their own votership when they agree to the support. [basically, if you held a referendum in other countries ""Do you want to give the Greeks money?"", a lot of people would probably vote no. Of course they would probably vote the same if it wasn't Greece, but any other country than their own. It's one of the problems of EU politics in general that a lot of it isn't really popular with the people on the street. ]  There are 6 countries who because of their political setup can't agree to the support on their own, but have to vote on it in parliament. These countries are: Finland, Germany, Estonia, Slowakia, Austria and the Netherlands. In Finland supposedly the coalition partner party of the government has claimed that they will vote against the support.   Not sure if any country will go as far as veto just to please their own votership. IMO, since the US supports Greece staying in the EU (even though they are not willing to put their money where their mouth it, because of course they too fear their votership), I think it's unlikely that it won't go through. It would require some major ""going rogue""."

I think rather that Germany has lost these now, especially with the two proposals from yesterday.  We have found out that both sides are 'kids', with no real direction or vision for the future.  This crisis has firmly made me into an opponent for the euro in Bulgaria. We suck at our own governance and fiscal policy, but at least I can attempt to vote out anyone here I don't like. I can't touch schäuble, and relying on a foreign electorate to help me out is not a position I want to be in."

It's not near the islands, and any ferry will take a minimum of 6 hours to get to a good island, however this is made up for with the sense of community and history you'd get by living in Thessaloniki.

I can't speak of Athens but Thessaloniki is crawling  with life and the artistic community is great,especially when it comes to music.  You could also consider looking for a home at the mountain (Hortiatis) not so close to the city,but it is a relatively short drive and you get to appreciate the beauty of nature,it is truly unique.If the mountain is not for you you should also consider Panorama,still on the countryside but closer to the city. As for the islands,personally I think you will regret buying a home there unless you are 100% sure or will only spend the summer there,as it can get empty in the winter.Unless you want to go to Crete that is,beautiful and accessible island However if I were you I would wait a few months to see the political situation unravel"

Ήδη ακούστε τι είπε το ζώον ο Σόιμπλε κατά γερμανικές πηγές:    FAZ: επικαλείται έγγραφο του Σόιμπλε το οποίο αναφέρει ότι το Βερολίνο δεν θεωρεί ότι τα μέτρα μπορούν να στηρίξουν ένα 3ο πρόγραμμα και προτείνει δύο δρόμους: είτε επιπλέον μεταρρυθμίσεις με διακομματική στήριξη είτε 5ετή έξοδο από το κοινό νόμισμα με επιπλέον στήριξη από την ΕΕ (ανθρωπιστική βοήθεια κλπ)   Το οποίο είναι αυτό ακριβώς στο οποίο αναφέρεται το άρθρο. Σεβασμός στην ""ψήφο των Ελλήνων"" που τον διατρανεύουν σε κάθε ευκαιρία δεν υπάρχει. Αν υπάρχει τρόπος να τους ξεμπροστιάσουμε (ειδικά αυτόν τον αλήτη) ενώπιον όλης της Ευρώπης πολύ θα το ευχαριστόμουν."

Πολλά από αυτά που λέει, τα λέει για τους σκληρούς ψηφοφόρους του. Ενώ οι Γάλλοι, έχουν αναπτύξει ένα φιλικό πρόσωπο οι Γερμανοί είναι στην αντίπερα όχθη, ασχέτως αν στην ΕΖ, αυτοί οι δύο κάνουν κουμάντο. Ίσως είναι και η τακτική του.

Ο Βαρουφάκης υποστήριζε τις θέσεις του λόγω οικονομικής ανάλυσης, άσχετο αν δεν ήξερε τον τρόπο να τις εκφράσει ώστε να γίνουν αρεστές σε εχθρικό κοινό. Ο Σόιμπλε υποστηρίζει τις δικές του λόγω μυωπικής, εγχώριας κατανάλωσης πολιτικής η οποία απευθύνεται σε κοινό με πολιτική και οικονομική άγνοια και στερεότυπα τα οποία ο ίδιος τροφοδοτεί τα τελευταία χρόνια.

That damn Varoufakis, the Paris photoshoot, and his ""game theory"". The referendum, which should have REALLY warned Greece of how fucking tired and angry every other country was and instead was another insult to the EU's goodwill.

Because that they were the only one to try to get closer to the other side is a obvious lie, as already by march the requirements for the primary surplus had been loosened. That the ECB slowly stopped financing the greek bank system? That, too, seems like an unreasonable complaint to me. I particulary didnt like this part:   All the money they owe us… about 17 billion euros, [of which] 10 billion [is] from the remainder of the 50-billion-euro [Hellenic] Financial Stability Fund which, under the February 20th agreement, we would have to give back. We have not received any money from June last year, so for 12 months we have been paying around 10 billion euros to the creditors from our resources without getting a single euro from them, which they had agreed to give, of course under conditions. It was obvious they were not going to cooperate and that we needed growth and these were two problems going side by side. They didn't want to finance the money we were entitled to in order to pay the debts.   Here he is basically complaining that the EU is not giving them the money promised under the deal they want to modify or cancel, so they cant pay the money they owe. Its crazy talk."

From one side an unflexible troika, from the other a greek government that did nothing to address the structural problems of greece's economy, just cutting spending (which was and is needed, but not enough).  I dont agree with the cutting of the debt, as i still think that the primary surplus and gdp growth in 2014 showed how the situation was improving and becoming manageable, but that is a moot point anyway: the eu had already, since 2012, agreed to at least consider debt restructuring so long as the reforms had been implemented and it really was showed as unavoidable.  Anyway, i fear this is all stuff for historians now: the bbc just reported that the meeting for today had been cancelled, as it was deemed as useless by this point.

Δεν ξέρω πχ αν η καθυστέρηση εξόφλησης οφειλών από το δημόσιο αυξάνει το ΑΕΠ. Όμως, όσον αφορά γενικά την πορεία της οικονομίας, σκέφτομαι το εξής:  Αυτή είναι η πορεία του επιτοκίου του 10 ετούς ομολόγου της Ελλάδας το 13-14.  Αυτή είναι η αντίστοιχη της Πορτογαλίας για σύγκριση.  Αυτά τα επιτόκια προκύπτουν από την αξιολόγηση σοβαρών ανθρώπων που είναι η δουλειά τους να αναλύουν την οικονομική κατάσταση και πρόκειται να επενδύσουν τα λεφτά τους εκεί, δηλαδή δεν λένε απλώς κάτι αλλά βάζουν και τα λεφτά τους σε αυτό. Όπως φαίνεται η εμπσιτοσύνη στην ελληνική οικονομία αυξανόταν. Όλοι διαρηγνύουν τα ιμάτιά τους ότι το πρόγραμμα δεν έβγαινε αλλά από αυτό φαίνεται ότι τουλάχιστον βελτιωνόταν η κατάσταση. Αυτό βέβαια που έγινε τον Οκτώβριο του 14 και άρχισαν πάλι να αυξάνονται τα επιτόκια είναι ότι ο Σαμαράς, βλέποντας τις εκλογές και το πολιτικό κόστος, δεν έκλεισε την αξιολόγηση και έσκισε τα μνημόνια. Ήθελε, γαρ, ""ο λαός"" να δει σκισμένα μνημόνια. Οπότε το 2015 πήγε κάπως έτσι. Ενώ οι άλλες χώρες της ΕΖ δανείζονταν με ιστορικά χαμηλά λόγω της ποσοτικής χαλάρωσης. Τι να κάνουμε....  Το μόνο θετικό που βλέπω τώρα είναι ότι δεν υπάρχει πλέον αντιμνημόνιο και διαφαίνεται κάποια πολιτική συναίνεση, τουλάχιστον σε θέματα εθνικού συμεροντος. Βέβαια τώρα με τα καινούργια μέτρα ίσως τίθεται όντως το θέμα αν βγαίνει το πρόγραμμα, γιατί φάγαμε μεγάλη κατραπακιά με όλα αυτά και το κλέισιμο των τραπεζών. Αλλά τεχνικά πάντα υπάρχει λύση.

Βλέπω λέτε για Αργεντινή, αλλά μην ξεχνάτε τι γίγαντας ήταν και είναι σε εξαγωγές ( σόγια, αγροτικά προιόντα , πολύ κτηνοτροφία ).  Στην ελλάδα δυστυχώς , έχουμε τεράστια εμπορικά ελλείματα.  Ακόμα και στα τρόφιμα, κρέας και σιτάρι κανονικό ( σκληρό έχουμε για μακαρόνια ) κάνουμε κατά κόρον εισαγωγή, ζωοτροφές το ίδιο.  Οι αγρότες μας κατά μεγάλη πλειοψηφία ενώ είχαν τα εργαλεία ( επιδοτήσεις, φοροαπαλλαγές ) για 30 χρόνια μαλακίζονται.  Αν κοιτάξεις τον πυρήνα της οικονομίας βλέπεις οτι η δομή της είναι κατά κύριο λόγο υπηρεσίες.  Οι μεγαλύτερες μας εξαγωγές είναι πετρελαικά προιοντα. Να κάνω μια ανάλυση εδώ, αγοράζουμε γύρω στα 18 δις πετρέλαιο, το επεξεργαζόμαστε, κρατάμε για εσωτερικές ανάγκες και οτι περισσεύει το εξάγουμε για περίπου 12 δις ( ένα έλλειμα περίπου 6 δις σε αυτον τον τομέα ).  Το επόμενο εξαγωγικό προιόν είναι συσκευασμένα φάρμακα για 1 δις, αλλά εισάγουμε φάρμακα για 3 δις.  Τι θέλω να πω, αν το γυρνάγαμε στην δραχμή οι εισαγωγείς θα ήθελαν σκληρό νόμισμα , και οσο μεγάλη υποτίμηση να κάνεις και μειώσεις το κόστος παραγωγής πάλι οι εξαγωγές σου δεν φτάνουν γαμώτο.  Και το κυριότερο, δεν έχεις το κεφάλαιο να χτίσεις μια σοβαρή αυτόνομη οικονομία, ούτε ο άλλος έξω έχει την πίστη να ρίξει λεφτά στην Ελλάδα.  Είτε έχεις δραχμή είτε ευρώ , αν δεν λύσεις την γραφειοκρατεία και τους απαρχαιωμένους νόμους , ο άλλος έξω δε θα επενδύσει.  Θα έπαιρνε δεκαετίες πολλών σκατών για να πάει μπροστά η οικονομία ( και ναι το χρέος αλλα αργεντινή μπορεί να πλήρωνες το 25% αλλά καλή τύχη αν σου ξαναδανείσει κανείς )."

Official Europe chose the second option, putting the bailing out of French and German banks exposed to Greek public debt above Greece’s socioeconomic viability. A debt restructure would have implied losses for the bankers on their Greek debt holdings....."""

Except it wasnt like that, at all. In 2012 exposure to greek debt was minimal from foreign entities. Everyone had either dumped greek debt or got swapped and bailed by the troika. The total amount of haircut was around 50bil iirc but the troika loans(which were the biggest percentage of debt) were exempt.  Who wasnt exempt from that haircut? Greek banks, greek retirement funds, greek social funds, greek bondholders, etc. The vast majority of that haircut was actually a cut to greek owned bonds. Sure, there were a some foreign owned debt back then, but iirc like 80% of it was greek owned( i might be wrong about this number).  Do you want to know why greek retirement funds are fucked? It isnt because a few people retired earlier(the greek average retirement age is similar to Germany's and other european countries). It is because our retirement funds have lost over 50% of their value because of all that shit."

greece,3ctv9o,maadison,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you could say that the haircut was 100bil and Greece was given at the same 130billion loan, half of which went straight to the greek banks for recapitalization, so the end result was around 60billion.  2011 The debt was 368bil  2012 The debt was 306bil  Now here is the thing about the haircut. As i mentioned, most foreigners had little exposure to greek debt by that time. And even those foreign entities who had exposure to the greek debt, had previously bought that debt for like 30% of its value. So even a 50% haircut would have been profitable for them.Who got all that greek debt? Some of it went to troika but also a very significant part of it went to the greek banks.  According to the Bank of Greece, 51.2billion was the real profit of the haircut.  TLDR : My initial numbers were wrong but these numbers are correct. Out of the 130 billion cut, 51billion was the actual real cut in the debt."

ANY country or financial institution which had ANY dealings with these, got their assets poisoned and therefore is now needing a bailout to back these poisoned assets.  So, if you look at the surface, it looks like its the debt of THESE institutions.  BUT, when these institutions are bailed out and their poisoned assets are backed that way, the concocted assets in wall street ALSO get backed, therefore are realized.   So, basically we are all bailing out wall street banks by fixing the world poisoned money supply by basically PAYING for these assets.   that's the catch."

Why didn't they just say YES in the first place instead of proposing the same measures?  The aftermath of the referendum was not obvious.  At the point of calling for the referendum, Tsipras hoped for (a) to get a renewed popular mandate and stop the hopes of a return to Samaras (the previous PM) and (b) that the markets would shake enough so that the EU would become afraid for a Grexit.  Part (a) worked wonderfully, (b) not at all. So now he is forced to make a truce with unfavourable terms as that was the final 'crash test' of how much the markets believe in an EU without Greece (apparently it's not a problem). Democracy says that this proposal CANNOT be accepted by the people (since when we vote it means something right?) but the markets shake their finger.    Αφού ο λαός είπε όχι γιατί λένε ναι;  Γιατί απλά δεν λέγανε ναί στο τελεσίγραφο αφού δίνουν τα ίδια μέτρα;  Η κατάληξη του τελεσιγράφου δεν ηταν προφανής.  Την στιγμή του τελεσιγράφου ο Τσίπρας ελπιζε (α) οτι θα έπερνε λαική εντολή για διαπραγμάτευση και να κλεισει η ελπίδα για επάνοδο του Σαμαρά κ (β) οτι οι αγορες θα κλωνιζονταν τοσο ωστε οι ευρωπαίοι θα φοβόντουσαν το Grexit.  Το (α) δουλεψε και πανυγηρικά μάλιστα, το (β) δεν έπεξε καθόλου. Οπότε τώρα παει σε ανακωχή με ασχημους όρους αναγκαστηκά γιατί αυτό ηταν το τελικό crash test του πόσο οι αγορές πιστεύουν σε μια Ευρώπη με την Ελλάδα να φεύγει (δεν εχουν προβλημα). Η δημοκρατία λέει οτι αυτό το μνημόνιο ΔΕΝ μπορεί να το δεχτεί ο λαός (γιατί οταν κάνουμε δημοψηφίσματα σημαίνουν κάτι έτσι;) αλλά οι αγορές της κουνάνε το δάχτυλο."

greece,3cogj9,koyima,31,Fri Jul 10 11:04:58 2015 UTC,"It seems like since tavernas can't distinguish themselves because of their food, they compensate by having people very aggressively try to get you into their restaurant. This is something I really did not like. I felt like I couldn't even look in the direction of a cafe in fear of getting harrassed or guilted into eating there.   This. Even we Greeks know it's crap, why don't they stop it?   I found the drink quality to be very low. For beer it was a small selection of light Lagers everywhere (Fix and Mythos seemed like staples). Wine also seemed to be very light. Cocktails were all very fruity and incredibly sweet. Even traditionally strong/stout drinks like an Old Fashioned or Negroni were very watered down and sweet in Greece. Because of this I mostly stuck to drinking Ouzo or liqueurs like Campari after a while.   Yep, some beers exist in every restaurant, the rest you will find at beer joints. But those are Greek (as far as I know, so it makes sense to find them everywhere). Wine is pretty subjective, generally when I taste strong wine, I find it cheap. Can't argue with Ouzo.   In general, it seems like Greece has a very strong sweet tooth. Most drinks were sickly sweet to our taste and people were eating ice cream and gelato everywhere we looked. It almost seems like Nestle owns half the country as Nescafe and Nestle ice creams were everywhere. The Nestle logo was everywhere you looked.   It's a combo: Frappe (of which I have a huge glass next to me right now)  Greek frappé was invented in 1957 at the International Trade Fair in Thessaloniki.[2] The representative of the Nestlé company, Giannis Dritsas, was exhibiting a new product for children, a chocolate beverage produced instantly by mixing it with milk and shaking it in a shaker. Dritsas' employee Dimitris Vakondios was looking for a way to have his usual instant coffee during his break but he could not find any hot water, so he mixed the coffee with cold water and ice cubes in a shaker. This improvised experiment established this popular Greek beverage. Frappé has been marketed chiefly by Nestlé and is among the most popular drinks in Greece and is available at virtually all Greek cafés.   I also found it interesting that giant bottles of water were everywhere. I assume this is because greek tap water is no good to drink?   Nope, Greek tap water in cities is fine to drink. We just have a few companies that do bottled water and we do have some areas that people still have their own wells, but we don't usually drink it. Also HEAT.    Small details that stood out were that almost all places put paper over the table when you ate, and that you were given multiple bills over the course of your meal. Neither of these are common practice at home.   Paper is something we have tried to get rid off. It isn't easy. Bills need to be there for the tax man. Despite what you hear, we have become more self-conscious about it and by law if you don't get a receipt you are not obliged to pay.   The biggest things that stood out to us were how small the showers and elevators were and how hard the beds are. Sleeping and showering were both uncomfortable experiences while in Greece. I'm not sure if this is just in hotels (though we did stay at a couple of apartment/bed and breakfast type places that were the same).   It's good for the back. That's all I can say.   We were interested in going to a club in Athens but were told that things don't really get started until after midnight and go until the morning. In the states, bars and clubs close at 2 am and it is easy to find and early breakfast anywhere.   Last call bullshit, it was retarded in 2006, still sounds retarded to me.   The roads are a nightmare.   Do you know how annoying it gets when they are also always under construction and we are always paying money to fix them? All Greeks think they are great drivers... myself included....   We noticed a ton of what we called ""church boxes"" along the road as we drove around. They basically looked like religiously decorated mailboxes. What are these?   A person has died there (or maybe a very close accident)   Many buildings had what looked like a solar panel with a gas tank on top of them on the roof. What are these?   You don't have these in Texas? Solar water heaters. Hot water all day for free!!!  My sister is currently in Texas."

My uncle has a tavern and this is how he gets his fish: Some of it, he fishes it himself. Most of it is bought by local fishermen. It's not imported, not mass grown on fish farms, it's a local product, wild and fresh. This drives the prices sky high. Some -shady- taverns exploit that and might sell you imported or farm grown fish for the price of fresh, but good taverns do not.   Second of all, you're not buying the fish in portions/helpings. You're buying it per kilo. So the ""little"" fish weighting 500g that you order to eat it by yourself and cost you €30-€40, is actually three+ portions if gone by weight alone. It doesn't help that you pay the fish for its uncooked weight either ;).  What's the deal with the many receipts?  Welcome to the Greek tax system. Everytime you order something and is brought to your table, there needs to be an accompanying receipt. That's to stave off tax evasion - there needs to be a clear indication of what is been on the table and has been consumed at all times.   If that weren't the case, the tavern holder and customer could collude and instead of 3 stakes and 2 Greek salads, they could claim that 1 stake and 1 Greek salad was consumed only and split the VAT cost that they evaded between them."
greece,3cogj9,onomaxristi,3,Thu Jul 9 15:58:45 2015 UTC,"I figured as much for the fish. It was indeed very fresh and amazing, but quite pricey. I guess I should have gotten larger fish for a better deal?"
greece,3cogj9,kmjn,4,Thu Jul 9 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"Well, in all honesty, quality fish has roughly the same price in Greece, Italy, Spain, Croatia... i just presume it's expensive because it's expensive :). But it is good. Did you have the seabream (dorada/tsipura) or the sea bass (lavraki)? Or maybe the red/black scorpionfish? (I forget how the greek call it. It's skarpina in Croatia, scrofana in Italy, rascasse in France - maybe the greek name is similar to one of those? ). The scorpionfish is really expensive everywhere I saw it. The french make their famous bouillabaisse from it; but it's very good grilled, too."
greece,3cogj9,vv_reddit,5,Thu Jul 9 18:30:31 2015 UTC,Skorpina in Greek.
greece,3cogj9,OftenStupid,3,Thu Jul 9 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. I think I was taken aback because of not being able to easily make a kilo-pounds conversion (which I feel bad about) and that you generally don't pay by weight at restaurants in the states.  A nice fish dish would generally be around 20 American dollars here, and that's at a nice but not super expensive restaurant. That is whole price of the plate, not just for the fish by weight.  Most fish I saw was 50-60 euro per kilo which would be about 22 euro per pound. A standard fish here, like salmon, would sell for about 10 euro per pound at market. So after a markup at the restaurant I guess its not that different.  It was just felt very expensive after most things being 10 euro or less to suddenly pay 70 for enough Red Mullet for 3 people!"
greece,3cogj9,badirontree,2,Thu Jul 9 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Some of the expensiveness of fish in Greece, especially at fish restaurants that specialize in fish, is that most of it is fresh and wild-caught. Some restaurant owners who position themselves as a ""fish tavern"" would almost consider it dishonest to sell any other kind of fish, than fresh fish bought that morning from a local fisherman. That's what taking you back to the kitchen is supposed to show, that it's really fresh fish and you can see it before it's cooked. When back in the kitchen, you can often point out which specific fish you want, too.  A comparison to the U.S. might be if you went to a restaurant that only serves wild-caught Pacific halibut and salmon, which is a lot more expensive than the farm-raised fish (I have been to a place like that in Washington state). Long-term there will probably be fish farms introduced in Greece too, to produce a higher volume of more affordably priced fish, but traditionally it wasn't necessary since the Mediterranean was so abundant, and the wild-caught fish is better. Now unfortunately many of the species are depleted from overfishing, however."
greece,3cogj9,conitsts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:16:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, red mullet. But those are small-is fish, right? It was not a single 500-g fish, but rather 2-3 smaller ones per person, right?  It's a good fish, and fairly expensive indeed. But I think ""lavraki"" and ""tsipura"" are a better deal :) (somewhat cheaper, and same-or-better-tasting IMO)."
greece,3cogj9,love-of-trance,2,Thu Jul 9 20:25:58 2015 UTC,Yes they were smaller fish that we had fried whole. We just had a big plate of whole fried fish in the center of the table. Very good though.

Oh, while I started this text I wanted to point out a few things but I scrolled down and see alot of my fellow countrymen have done the job quite well.  If I can give honest opinion about some of your negative views which I also agree: 1) Athens is ugly, dirty and not well designed. Chaotic you could say. 12/10 Would ask my friend obama to nuke the buildings (ppl and historic monuments inside fridges so they can be safe from nuclear blast.) 2) Peddlers and Beggars, many of them are doing that for a living. Rarelly I have seen someone which I have judged that was indeed in a need. (There is pain and despair painted all over their face and body statute, they also are very polite) 3) There is no much food variation/diversity. Most tavernas/restaurants offer the exact same thing. 4)Almost everything is being selled according to its weight. For example you will never see someone selling a slice of Watermelon. 5) Hmmm I just forgot it, might add it later on.  Glad you enjoyed our country."

greece,3cogj9,tserts,5,Thu Jul 9 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"Nafplio: Possibly the prettiest town I've ever been to. I could have spent the rest of the vacation there. Sitting by the water at any of the tons of bars/tavernas there was wonderful.   Nafplio is amazing and it should be advertised more to tourists that usually have Athens, Santorini and Mykonos in their minds!   The owner (or who I assume to be the owner) actually took us into the kitchen to look at the fish, which I thought was unusual but very cool.    Tat's how all good fish restaurants do it. The fish is super fresh and you go in and choose what you want! Having some fresh (and more expensive) calamari and fish beats the hell out of just ordering a plate! I guess you also saw the iced boxes that restaurants showcase their product to customers who walk by!   Rafina: By this time we were extremely tired and so didn't do or see much in Rafina.    You didn't miss a thing by not walking around. Don't worry!   It seems like since tavernas can't distinguish themselves because of their food, they compensate by having people very aggressively try to get you into their restaurant.    For touristic areas this is true, but usually trying to find a place that is crowded with locals is your best bet for food.    These are not things you see in the states at all.   And that's a business opportunity right there!   but I found the drink quality to be very low. For beer it was a small selection of light Lagers everywhere (Fix and Mythos seemed like staples). Wine also seemed to be very light. Cocktails were all very fruity and incredibly sweet. Even traditionally strong/stout drinks like an Old Fashioned or Negroni were very watered down and sweet in Greece.  Because of this I mostly stuck to drinking Ouzo or liqueurs like Campari after a while. Speaking of Ouzo, what are the brands that are considered good or bad? It was hard to differentiate for me. I ended up buying some ""Mini"" to take home.   You should have tried some Greek micro-brews! Greek wine is fanastoc but the cheaper unbottled wine served by restaurants can be a hit or miss experience. That last phrase is also true about cocktails and drinks! For ouzo it's a matter of personal preference but Mini is not the greatest brand available afaik.   most people were drinking very sweet iced coffees. We also tried ""greek"" coffee which we found very bitter, grainy, and acidic. There was some good filtered coffee occasionally but very little consistency.   It's way too hot here to consume non-iced coffees from April to October. I don't know if you tried a frappe but this is the definition of a greek-consumed coffee!   I also found it interesting that giant bottles of water were everywhere. I assume this is because greek tap water is no good to drink?   Tap water is great in most areas (not in Nafplio though) but having iced water is far better than just tap water!   The biggest things that stood out to us were how small the showers and elevators were and how hard the beds are. Sleeping and showering were both uncomfortable experiences while in Greece.   Since you are from the US i think you are just used to those huge thick and very soft mattresses that are marketed over there! This not a trend over here at all.   The roads are a nightmare. I don't understand why anyone chooses to drive a car in Greece. The roads in cities are not meant for cars and the highway seems to be lawless.    Welcome to Greece my friend! There is a special road that should be marketed as a near-death experience for extreme sport enthusiasts: the Corinth-Patras highway. If I recall properly it is the deadliest raod in Europe or something!    Many buildings had what looked like a solar panel with a gas tank on top of them on the roof. What are these?   This basically provides free hot water for half the year when the sun is shining!   Why is Ewan McGregor all over your airport?   Wat??"

I haven't seen really any tagging on the Cyclades islands outside of like small paint marker tags on ferry boarding area benches.  Seems like mostly a metro area issue, the economic downturn in 2010 certainly did not help matters any.  Introduced a lot of empty commercial buildings and half finished projects. Lot of those got broken into and vandalized over the last 5 years. No money to sandblast or paint over the tagging that's happened in public areas.

Ecologic principals are hard to uphold when trying to survive, whatever you do to help those who still try to fit this issue in everyday life will be appreciated.  Hitchhiking should be safe, I haven't heard anything scary, although I haven't myself done anything similar, it's not too popular in the last years.... I'd suggest using public transport, it will give you a better insight of life in Greece.  Ask here for advice on your destinations, you will get specific ""local"" tips, where do you plan on visiting?"
greece,3cs7m6,tserts,2,Fri Jul 10 13:29:56 2015 UTC,They should keep anything valueable safe and on them at all times. That's what you should regularly do when traveling actually. You can't expect everyone around you to be nice and let your stuff loose while with strangers.
greece,3cs7m6,n8u,3,Fri Jul 10 15:02:18 2015 UTC,Media usually show Greece worst than it is. I guess you will find the same dangers if not even less you would expect in every other europian country. While there concerns about robbery from people because many prefer to withdraw and have cash on themselves and their homes I wouldn't say that there is a specific increase in crime.
greece,3cs7m6,zesic,2,Fri Jul 10 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"nothing to worry about. You will not believe that we are in a crisis situation. Everything looks normal. Greeks still are on cafeterias having their coffees. Don't even worry about cash, your credit-debit card works fine in Greece. Where do you plan to go ?"

greece,3crzmo,StratosB,3,Fri Jul 10 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"They haven't been able to take part in the QE program, because the ECB owns a certain percentage of debt.

greece,3crzmo,WatIsThisDayOfRestSh,5,Fri Jul 10 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"They probably considered a couple of alternative plans. Their reaction as of now, tells me that non of them is considered even close to sucking up the austerity pill (for a develpment plan and a debt restructuring). A transition to Drahma, under the current conditions, would be in a state of panic and uncontrolled defaulting. Printing and organising a new currency can take months, and you'll still have to continue negotiating with creditors for defaulting terms, minimize the permanent damage to your economy for not having a working banking sector and, somehow, manage to cover pensions and federal sector payments."

Το ότι η Άγκελα επίσης είπε όχι σε κλασσικό κούρεμα είναι ουσιαστικά παραδοχή ότι χρειάζεται κούρεμα.  Πλέον είσαι απλά μαλάκας αν λες ότι το κούρεμα (σε όποια μορφή) δεν πρέπει να γίνει κ πως η Ελλάδα θέλει στεγνό austerity (άποψη του ΝΑΙ οσυσιαστικά).  Αν δεν είναι αυτό επιτυχία Βαρουφάκη δεν ξέρω εγώ τι είναι. 5 χρόνια επικοινωνιακά τον πίνουμε (όχι ότι τώρα είναι τέλεια). Από τις δηλώσεις ΓΑΠ - που δεν έκανε κανένα διαχωρισμό μεταξύ απλών πολιτών κ ολιγαρχών, μέχρι κ ο Γκυ - ο κολλητός του Θεοδωράκη - έχουμε την καραμέλα του τεμπέλη επέτη Έλληνα.

Για αυτό ο ΠΟΤΑΜΙσιος Γκυ λύσσαξε με το ΔΝΤ, ενώ η Λαγκάρντ από τις 25 είχε πει στο Eurogroup ότι όντως θα έπρεπε να πουν ότι το χρέος είναι βιώσιμο για συμφωνία.

Μάλίστα η ελληνική κυβέρνηση τότε ήταν τόσο σίγουρη ότι θα γίνει ότι έκλεινε συνέχεια το μάτι στους πολίτες ""κάντε λίγη υπομονή κι έρχεται το κούρεμα του χρέους"".   Για κάποιο λόγο η στάση των Ευρωπαίων άλλαξε μετά, σε σημείο που άρχισαν να λένε ότι το χρέος είναι απολύτως βιώσιμο και δε χρειάζεται να γίνει τίποτα.

Για να έχουν αξία όλες αυτές οι θυσίες θα πρέπει να δώσουν τεράστια απομείωση χρέους και σοβαρό πακέτο ανάπτυξης. Αν εμείς πάρουμε όλα αυτά τα μέτρα και είχαμε όλη αυτή τη χασούρα με το χάος που προκλήθηκε από το standaoff μόνο και μόνο για μια μικρή απομείωση χρέους και ένα αδιάφορο πακέτο ανάπτυξης, προφανώς τότε είμαστε ηλίθιοι και η μόνη λογική εναλλακτική είναι η έξοδος από το ευρώ."

Το Σύριζα μου φάνηκε ότι θα πίεζε σε αυτή τη γενική κατεύθυνση και είναι ένα κόμμα με γενικά προοδευτικές/αριστερές ιδέες. Άρα θα ήταν καλή επιλογή για μένα (και θα το ψήφιζα αν ήμουν στην Ελλάδα όταν έγιναν οι εκλογές).   Το λάθος τους είναι ότι εστίασαν 100% στο πρώτο σκέλος (πιέζουμε τους ευρωπαίους για να αλλάξει το ευρώ και η λογική των bailouts) αλλά δεν είχαν καθόλου plan b (ούτε τεχνικά κατά τα φαινόμενα και σε καμία περίπτωση από πολιτική πλευρά) για την περίπτωση που η άλλη πλευρά αποδεικνύονταν τελείως αδιάλλακτη.   In hindsight, το καλύτερο που θα μπορούσε να κάνει το Σύριζα ήταν να πει ανοιχτά προεκλογικά ""είτε οι Ευρωπαίοι μας δίνουν βιώσιμη λύση είτε βγαίνουμε από το ευρώ"". Μετά μόλις έβγαιναν κυβέρνηση να ξεκινούσαν capital controls και ετοιμασίες για παράλληλο νόμισμα. Και μετά λένε ""Κύριοι της Ευρώπης δώστε μια πρόταση για συμφωνία, αν μας αρέσει την κρατάμε. Αν δε μας αρέσει τη βάζουμε σε δημοψήφισμα και ανάλογα με το αποτέλεσμα την αποδεχόμαστε ή φεύγουμε από το κοινό νόμισμα"".   Αυτό που έκαναν ήταν ότι αφέθηκαν τελείως και έπαιξαν το παιχνίδι των δανειστών μέχρι το τέλος και ήταν η πιο συντηρητική προσέγγιση μεν, αλλά η λιγότερο πιθανή να φέρει αποτελέσματα."

Nothing like that happened. The institutions were continuously rejecting reforms without looking. ""No, they are too generous"" and Varoufakis was telling them: ""Please, let us complete four to five reforms on which we all agree and view as necessary and let us implement them and you can evaluate and make an assessment of them"".  [The Institutions said] ""No, no, we need a comprehensive agreement before we implement these reforms, because if you implement these reforms that would be a unilateral action. We haven't approved them yet, ok, we agree, but we still haven't determined the primary surplus"". So we are unable to do anything while at the same time they wanted to see our books because they didn't trust our numbers. ""We want to go to the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Greece"" et cetera, and Varoufakis was saying: ""No, let’s start from the agreement of February 20th under which you are not supervising the Greek economy anymore and you are not assisting us or the creditors to assess the viability of the economy so as to gradually return to growth. That's the objective of the February 20th agreement, an extension of the existing programme. We amend, evaluate and complete the program in four months. June 30th, programme finished"".     This is what Varoufakis has already explained. It just goes to show all the steps taken by Europe is to collapse this upstart leftist govt."

Look, it's real simple, if Greece is solvent and able to handle their own affairs internally they can have whatever government they want, and in fact it means that Europe won't have the influence to collapse their government.  However, that's not the case. The plan as such to manage internal affairs is to borrow billions to trillions of dollars, from Europe. And they are not demonstrating that there is a creative or distinguishable new plan to not fail and incur spiraling debt. Therefore, they have not shown their creditors that they are a good risk. Therefore they don't get the loans.  This is not the first but about the 5th or 6th bite at the apple over the past few years. The thing isn't that the Syriza government isn't upstart or revolutionary, it's in fact only distinguished by its unwillingness to change."

In every one of the greek bailout plans offered by the EU, the EU has set as conditions for the bailouts to remove the greek laws on restricted professions. Yet we are hear more than 5 years or more after the first EU bailout of Greece and Greek politicians still have not done away with the laws that restrict professions in greece when unemployment is maybe close to 60% for greek graduates. It is again a condition of the current bailout that tsipiras and sirizia party has currently in writing proposed that the greek government would be willing to accept. It just baffles my mind how the government of Greece is managed. Everyone should have a fair and equal right to work, restricted professions limit employment to a few who have government or political connections so that they can have exclusive control of a specific sector of the greek economy."

It's how the west evolved to today's capitalism. Did you by any chance read about how taxi drivers all over Europe and all over the world are revolting against UBER taxis? Well, taxis are one of the restricted professions.   Restricted professions ALL OVER THE WESTERN WORLD include professions that the state has an interest to regulate, because they're important to vital areas, ie. health, security, transportations etc. Having a profession among the restricted ones does not mean that all restrictions are the same for all professions. I mean, in Greece there is no set number on how many doctors there will be. But there is one for taxis, because, well, there is a legitimate interest to minimize the number of vehicles circulating.   There is an EU directive, that sets a deadline for all EU countries to free certain professions. I don't remember if the deadline has expired but i don't think so. This is not a uniquely greek problem, so again, thanks for your input, we appreciate the indignation and all, but, again, you don't seem to understand what the problem is."

greece,3cpizc,DieAssel,5,Thu Jul 9 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"How much of the money was used to bail out (especially german) banks   Here's a comprehensive article that discusses in detail how Greece’s 2010 assistance program was largely a bailout of European banks, initiated to prevent a wider banking crisis. It also includes invaluable and well-researched information about similar shaneningans for the following bailouts.  Here is another comprehensive article that explains how the bailouts recycled 90% of their value into debt refinancing, so the Greek economy only actually touched 10% of that money, the rest went directly back to creditors.   Comparison of the pension/living costs of german and greek pensioners   I think the standard response to the oft-repeated ""Greeks have too high pensions"" claim is this WSJ article. Another point that is usually missed is how much the Greek pension system was hurt by the bailouts. Not only did the high unemployment destroyed its funding and the loss of GDP made the expenditure seem higher than it really is... but also a ton of reserves and funds the pension system had accumulated over the years was lost because of the PSI haircut. This article explains what happened in detail:   From the PSI, the public funds suffered losses almost, if not more, in their own reserves. Why? Because they were forced under the law to save their cash reserves with the Bank of Greece, and the Bank of Greece had the right to use these funds to buy bonds on their behalf.  For me it was a big scandal because apparently what happened was a lot of politicians, bankers, a lot of people went and gave - they had bonds that they had bought 20% - they went and they gave it to the Greek Central Bank, Bank of Greece, 100%, they got their money and then the haircut comes to the public.  Basically, what they were forced to do was to use their cash reserves, social security funds, pension funds, in order to buy government bonds that were going to be cut in real terms around 70% in present value. So the funds right now, the pension funds, are facing a bigger problem than the banks are facing. The pension funds have to plan 15 to 20 years ahead to be able to pay pensions, when the aging population is increasing and the working population is decreasing. They also have to pay unemployment benefits and so on. So, all these debt locks came to the front now."

Well prominently among the proposed ""reforms"" (ugh, i hate myself for writing this word) was that EKAS (a pension supplement only the lowest of the lowest of the low pensioners are entitled to) was to be cut. To give you an example you need to have a pension of 300€ per month and your family's income combined should not exceed a certain limit, again really low. So, at that moment I realized that either the EU doesn't  know what they're talking about or that they do know and they're lying. Either way my mind was made up right at that very moment and thanks to Jean Claude I voted no to the referendum.   Hope this helps and thank you for taking the time to do this."

greece,3coicv,StratosB,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"Explaining it for the 100th time on /r/greece. War reparations are determined by the victors of a war. The victors of WW2 were US Soviet Union UK and to some extent France, everyone else including Greece were either victims or just part of the victor's alliance. The victors determined the war reparations Germany had to pay. They also determined how much everyone including Greece would receive. Germany paid these war reparations in full and around 1990 the victors proclaimed any and all claims for war reparations were final. This was signed with the 4+2 agreement.  Go look it up on Wikipedia, go look up old war reparations and who determined them, it has always been like that and is according to international law. Greece has never and will never have any right to ask for more than that, that's also the reason they never actually went to the international court of Hague to ask for it there AND Greece has also lost 3 trials about WW2 war reparations there so far which had the same topic."
greece,3coicv,demonicgamer,2,Thu Jul 9 23:16:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sorry to dissappoint you but Greece has a legitimate right to ask for: a. The loan the German occupation army forced on Greece, there are actual contracts drawn and signed, b. The reparations to the people who suffered from war crimes, like in Distomo, and c. The damage done to the countries infrastructure from the war. For these up until the reunification Germany was saying that they can't pay because East Germany has to pay as well. After the reunification Germany changed the tune and is now saying we don't owe anything.   Mind you that the argument you're posing, ie. that only France etc. signed the treatie does not stand, because, well Greece did not agree to that legally and Frrance cannot decide for Greece. It does not stand also because, Greece was never a part of the Axis, sided with the allies and suffered for it.   From these 3 different sums I stated, Germany had only compensated the Jewish families who survived. Those were people from all over Europe, not just France, so again, there's not really an argument there.   Last, while the wiki is commendable and it's English version even more so, it lacks on information on subjects such as this one, which does not concern or affect the English audience."

Mind you that if you had read even one sentence you'd understand that Greece does not need to sign anything. War reparations are not determined by victims, but the victors. Greece was not a victor therefore it can't decide who pays what amount of war reparations to whom. If Greece would have wanted to decide who pays what they would have had to beat Germany themselves.  Go read up on international law or ask yourself why Greece has not won one trial at the international court of Hague yet nor tried to sue Germany for it."
greece,3coicv,sherlock234,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"So you know international law now? If you do, which I highly doubt it you'd also know that the international court in Hague only has jurisdiction if both parties agree to it: ie both Greece AND Germany.  So, even if Greece decided to go for it Germany would have to agree to go to Hagues as well. And that won't happen because they will lose.   Greece was on the side of the victors as it was never a part of the axis, like Bulgaria and Romania and the like, who were the nazis allies and lost.   So, before you decide to come here and try to be funny I suggest you go read up a bit on how the international court in Hagues works but before that I'd highly recommend you go brush up a bit on WWII history."

This initiative includes a set of drug policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments and the UN have made illegal. The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on 18 June 1971, by United States President Richard Nixon—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse ""public enemy number one"". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the ""prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted"", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term ""war on drugs"".    The Drug Policy Alliance estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on the War on Drugs.     Image i - As part of the War on Drugs, the US gives hundreds of millions of dollars per year of military aid to Colombia, used to combat guerrilla groups such as FARC that are involved in the illegal drug trade.

greece,3cnn6z,kiiraklis94,8,Thu Jul 9 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"Sir, Gideon Rachman’s analysis of the objectives and tactics on the two sides of the Greek negotiations (“Four games that Greeks may be playing”, June 16) misses the plausible hypothesis hinted at in James Putzel’s letter (“Nothing less than a debt writedown can save Greece”, also June 16).  The hypothesis, made explicit, is that the EC-ECB-IMF side wants to avoid Grexit and is prepared to offer enough support to avoid that option. It also wants to see the Tsipras government — and any other apparently “hard-left” government in Europe — replaced by one that is more compliant to the major states. It is therefore not prepared to provide enough support (in the form of debt writedown, for example) to enable Greece to recover from its Great Depression. The prospect of endless depression will hopefully (in its eyes) erode Syriza’s electoral base to the point where a “more realistic” government comes to power. This is the strategy of “coup d’état by stealth”, without the military having to do it. It should be provoking protest from across Europe.

Regardless whether you agree with him or not, he was right on the money about the euro.  ""The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics. The aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future European war impossible, and to set the stage for a federal United States of Europe. I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect. It would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues. Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity. Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity.""

greece,3cq0pv,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"Milton Friedman:       Milton Friedman (July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American economist, statistician and writer who taught at the University of Chicago for more than three decades. He received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy.   Friedman's challenges to what he later called ""naive Keynesian"" (as opposed to Neo-Keynesian) theory  began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function, and he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies.  In the late 1960s, he described his own approach (along with all of mainstream economics) as using ""Keynesian language and apparatus"" yet rejecting its ""initial"" conclusions.  During the 1960s, he promoted an alternative macroeconomic policy known as ""monetarism"". He theorized there existed a ""natural"" rate of unemployment and argued that governments could only increase employment above this rate, e.g., by increasing aggregate demand, only for as long as inflation was accelerating.  He argued that the Phillips curve was, in the long run, vertical at the ""natural rate"" and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation.  Though opposed to the existence of the Federal Reserve System, Friedman argued that, given that it does exist, a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the only wise policy.   Friedman actively participated in public debates over numerous policy issues; he was a major advisor to Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan  and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment, and his support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers.   His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007–08. Edward Nelson, the assistant director of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, argues, ""in important respects, the overall monetary and financial policy response to the crisis can be viewed as Friedman’s monetary economics in practice.""    Friedman was among the strongest proponents of positivism in the social sciences. In the field of statistics, Friedman developed the sequential sampling method of analysis. He was also a mentor of and collaborator with Leonard Jimmie Savage, laying the foundations of Bayesian statistics and decision theory. With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago price theory, a distinctive intellectual and methodological movement at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics, Law School, and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward. A large number of students and young professors that were recruited or mentored by Friedman during this period went on to become leading economists; they include Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Ronald Coase, and Robert Lucas, Jr..   Milton Friedman's own works include many monographs, books, scholarly articles, papers, magazine columns, television programs, videos, and lectures, and cover a broad range of topics of microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic history, and public policy issues.

Αυτό απηχούσε την αντιπαράθεση που επικρατούσε στο εσωτερικό της Πόλης, πριν την Άλωση.

Ζητούσε εκποίηση πραγμάτων για να εξασφαλίσει μισθοφόρους να υπερασπιστούν την Πόλη. Και το υπήκοον αρνιόταν να την προσφέρει κι αναθεμάτιζε.

Καμβάδες, σκοινιά για πλοία, υφάσματα, τίποτα από δαύτα δεν καπνίζεται, και όμως είναι περιζήτητα.  Πέρα από τις ίνες, υπάρχει και η τετραυδροκανναβινόλη aka THC για την παρασκευή φαρμάκων.

Όλα αυτά μπορούν να αποτελέσουν νέες επιχειρήσεις, δηλαδή νέο εισόδημα."
greece,3cnblu,StratosB,4,Thu Jul 9 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"Λοιπόν:   Ο ελληνικός πρωτογενής τομέας έχει κάποια πολύ σημαντικά μειονεκτήματα. Λόγω του γεωγραφικού αναγλύφου της χώρας, η παραγωγή είναι κατακερματισμένη, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι η γεωργική δραστηριότητα είναι περιορισμένης έκτασης, γεγονός που αυξάνει το κόστος. Επιπλέον, λόγω του παραπάνω, οι διαθέσιμες εκτάσεις γης προς καλλιέργεια είναι περιορισμένες και εκμεταλλευόμενες στο 100% της δυνατότητας τους. Αν εισηχθεί νέα καλλιέργεια, θα πρέπει να αντικαταστήσει κάποια προϋπάρχουσα. Η κάνναβη είναι ένα φυτό το οποίο θέλει μπόλικο νερό, ζέστη και φως. Στην Ελλάδα, εκεί που έχουμε επαρκές νερό (που κατακλύζονται από βαμβακοκαλλιέργειες), δεν έχουμε τα άλλα δύο (για λίγους, αλλά κρίσιμους για την παραγωγή μήνες). Αυτό το πρόβλημα λύνεται κατά κάποιο τρόπο με τα θερμοκήπια (δημιουργώντας άλλα, ωστόσο τα trade offs πρέπει να είναι αναμενόμενα). Εγώ θα πόνταρα σε ποικιλίες (ή στην ανάπτυξη ποικιλιών) που αντέχουν στο ξηρό μεσογειακό κλίμα. Τα αρωματικά φυτά τείνουν να παράγουν περισσότερους πολυκυκλικούς υδρογονάνθρακες σε συνθήκες στρες κάτω από έντονη ξηρασία, πράγμα που μπορεί να αποδώσει πρώτης ποιότητας προϊόν, για να μπορείς να αντισταθμίσεις τη χαμηλή παραγωγή με υπεραξία. Αν και υπάρχει οργανωμένη παραγωγή κάνναβης ήδη σε χώρες/περιοχές όπου έχει αποποινικοποιηθεί, παραμένει ωστόσο μία νέου τύπου παραγωγή που φέρει όλα τα ρίσκα και τους κινδύνους μίας νέας παραγωγής, πόσο μάλλον όταν προσπαθείς να την προσαρμόσεις στις τοπικές συνθήκες. Ίνες κάνναβης, THC, κανναβούρι, γάλα κάνναβης είναι 4, πολύ διαφορετικά δευτερογενή προϊόντα μεταξύ τους, που απαιτεί το καθένα τη δική του βιομηχανία μεταποίησης. Θα ασχοληθώ με 2 από αυτά. Όσων αφορά το THC, οι φαρμακευτικές ενώσεις επειδή απαιτούν πολύ υψηλή καθαρότητα, απαιτεί ένα συνδυασμό πολύ κοστοβόρας βιομηχανίας εκχύλισης και καθαρισμού και άριστης ποιότητας φυτική παραγωγή που είναι πολλές φορές υπερβολικά κοστοβόρα για να αξιοποιηθεί για οποιαδήποτε άλλη χρήση. Επιπλέον, τα υπολείμματα της επεξεργασίας, δεν είναι αξιοποιήσιμα. Οι ίνες κάνναβης, έχουν κάποια συγκριτικά πλεονεκτήματα σε σχέση με άλλου τύπου οργανικές ή συνθετικές ίνες, ωστόσο παραμένει μία χαμηλής απόδοσης δευτερογενής παραγωγή που απαιτεί εκτεταμένη πρωτογενή παραγωγή για να είναι βιώσιμη. Το να αντικαταστήσουμε τώρα μονοκαλλιέργειες βαμβακιού με μονοκαλλιέργειες κάνναβης δεν αποτελεί λύση (για πολλούς λόγους, βιολογικούς και οικονομικούς). Το μέγεθος του κέρδους, είναι άμεσα συνδεόμενο με το μέγεθος της αγοράς. Η κάνναβη αποτελεί μία κλειστή αγορά ακόμα, συνεπώς οι εξαγωγές θα είναι περιορισμένες. Για την ακρίβεια, σε ενδεχόμενο άνοιγμα της αγοράς κάνναβης στην Ελλάδα αναμένονται εισαγωγές για να καλύψουν την τοπική ζήτηση. Η περίφημη ελληνική φούντα ωχριά μπροστά την ποιότητα ενός τυποποιημένου προϊόντος που προέρχεται από οργανωμένη παραγωγή. Μία αγορά που ανοίγει απομυθοποιούμενη σιγά-σιγά, θα πρέπει να αναμένεται η ολοένα και ταχύτερη διάδοση της μέχρι να παγκοσμιοποιηθεί, πράγμα που μας γυρίζει πίσω στα ανταγωνιστικά μειονεκτήματα της πρωτογενούς παραγωγής στην Ελλάδα. Αναγκαστικά, ο μόνος τρόπος για να διατηρηθείς στην παγκόσμια αγορά, εφόσον δε μπορείς να καλύψεις μεγάλο τμήμα της συνολικής παραγωγής, είναι να παράγεις υπεραξία μέσο ενός διαφοροποιημένου προϊόντος. Στον τομέα της πρωτογενούς παραγωγής μπορούν, και πρέπει να γίνουν άμεσα, ήδη πολλές παρεμβάσεις. Δε νοείται π.χ. να πουλάμε πάμφθηνα χύμα έξτρα παρθένο ελαιόλαδο σε 10λιτρους τενεκέδες στην Ιταλία και να το τυποποιεί αυτή επαναπροωθόντας το για τεράστιο κέρδος (θα μπορούσα να επεκταθώ πολύ για το ελαιόλαδο, αλλά έχουμε και δουλειές). Το καθεστώς των επιδοτήσεων θα πρέπει να επανακαθοριστεί για να καλύπτει εξαγώγιμη παραγωγή, περιλαμβάνοντας και κατηγορίες στον τομέα μεταποίησης 'η/και τυποποίησης, ίσα-ίσα για να σπρώξει την ανάπτυξη αυτού το τομέα. Τα πλαφόν εισαγωγών-εξαγωγών για τα εν λόγω προϊόντα εντός της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης θα πρέπει να αναπροσαρμοστούν ανάλογα. Εκεί που θέλω να καταλήξω, είναι ότι η παραγωγή κάνναβης δεν είναι η κότα με τα χρυσά αυγά. Μπορεί να έχει αρκετά θετικά αποτελέσματα αν δε γίνει με τον κλασσικό πατροπαράδοτο ελληνικό τρόπο (aka ""όπου-δω-εύκολο-κέρδος-χώνομαι-κι-ας-μην-έχω-ιδέα-τι-κάνω""), μη περιμένεις όμως θαύματα."

greece,3cnblu,StripTheFlesh,2,Thu Jul 9 11:09:41 2015 UTC,"Ακριβώς... είματε πολύ συντηρητικός λαός και εκλέγουμε συντηρητικά κόμματα που διατηρούν το πελατειακό κράτος. Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ δε διαφέρει. Η συμμαχία με τους ΑΝΕΛ, η εκλογή του Πάκη-έμεινα-Παυλόπουλος για ΠτΔ και οι επαναπροσλήψεις δημοσίων υπαλλήλων χωρίς, όπως φαίνεται, ουσιαστικά κριτήρια το απέδειξε. Προτίμησαν να κάνουν συμμαχίες και να πάρουν κόσμο με το μέρος τους (κομματικός στρατός - τα ίδια με τους προηγούμενους δηλαδή) παρά να ""σπάσουν αυγά"". Σε κάθε περίπτωση, υπάρχουν πολλά συμφέροντα που διατηρούν την ινδική κάναβη παράνομη. Σκεφτείτε μόνο πόσοι δικηγόροι, νομικοί που γράφουν βιβλία, δικαστές, αστυνομικοί, πραγματογνώμονες, κοινωνικοί λειτουργοί, προγράμματα απεξάρτησης κλπ χρειάζονται για όλο αυτό το σύστημα. Είναι πολλά τα άμεσα συμφέροντα των ιδιωτών από το να παραμένει πάράνομο το χασίς. Από την άλλη, αν νομιμοποιηθούν όλα, το κράτος μπορεί να κερδίσει πολλά χρήματα. Αλλά όπως πάντα, πρώτα θα νομιμοποιήσει το χασίς το Βατικανό και τελευταία η Ελλάδα. Δυστυχώς, τέτοιες αλλαγές δεν γίνονται με τους ανεπαρκείς και ανίκανους πολιτικούς που έχουμε. Δείτε, ενδεικτικά, για το Colorado που νομιμοποίησε το χασίς, τί κέρδη είχε:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/04/colorado-pot-taxes-back-to-residents_n_6612292.html http://reset.me/story/cannabis-making-colorado-rich-state-may-literally-give-money-back-residents/"
greece,3cnblu,anabolic,8,Thu Jul 9 09:52:33 2015 UTC,Κυβέρνηση χωρίς Καμμένο. Όσο υπάρχουν οι Αν.Ελ. στην κυβέρνηση δεν πρόκειτε να ψηφιστεί νομιμοποίηση. Επίσης η αντιπολίτευση θα κάνει ότι μπορεί να εκμεταλλευτεί το θέμα για να χτυπήσει τον ΣΥΡΙΖΑ τώρα που έχουν ανέβει τόσο τα ποσοστά του.  Ίσως στο μέλλον με αυτοδύναμη κυβέρνηση ΣΥΡΙΖΑ ή σε συνεργασία με κάποιο πιο προοδευτικό κόμμα να γίνει.
greece,3cnblu,Nymrael,4,Thu Jul 9 07:00:46 2015 UTC,Μη ξεχνάς ότι - σε αντίθεση με τους ΑΝΕΛ - το ΠΟΤΑΜΙ ήδη ψήφισε για μετανάστες και έχει ήδη υποστηρίξει την Κάνναβη.
greece,3cnblu,StratosB,4,Thu Jul 9 08:24:28 2015 UTC,"Μάλλον σου διαφεύγει οτι τον Καμμένο τον διάλεξαν οι ίδιοι. Είχαν επιλογή να κάνουν κυβέρνηση με  πιο προοδευτικά κόμματα αλλά μόνο οι ΑΝΕΛ θα στήριζαν την αντι-μνημονιακή ρητορική.  (για να μην αναφερθώ σε μεταγραφές απο ΑΝΕΛ->ΣΥΡΙΖΑ όπως πχ Ραχή Μακρή, που είναι απαράδεκτες για ενα κόμμα που θέλει να λέει πως είναι προοδευτικό και αριστερό)"

Τους χρειάζεται για να έχει μαζί του του ένστολους, εθνικιστές αλλά όχι χρυσαυγίτες και απογοητευμένους από τη ΝΔ δεξιούς. Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ είναι τύποις προοδευτικό κόμμα. Στα χαρτιά.

Δε ρωτάς κάποιον που κάνει λες και σε γάμησε πριν συζητήσει καν για όρους, γιατί ξέρεις ότι αν μιλά έτσι τώρα, όταν θα τον χρειαστείς θα πρέπει να κάνεις τριανταπέντε κωλοτούμπες για να σου απαντήσει και μόνο. Ο Θεοδωράκης από μόνος του έμεινε έξω απ'την κυβέρνηση, με την άκρως αλαζονική συμπεριφορά του που το έπαιζε στανταράκι."

Οι ΑΝΕΛ έχουν κρατήσει πολύ καλύτερη στάση απ' όλα τα ντεμέκ προοδευτικά κόμματα τύπου Ποτάμι, που αν ήταν κυβέρνηση θα έκανε ότι έλεγε η ΕΕ (και τώρα που δεν είναι, πάει και γλύφει) κι ο Μπόμπολας. Οι ""προοδευτικές"" προτάσεις του Ποταμιού είναι για να παραπλανούν (θυμάσαι τα προεκλογικά σποτ; καφάσια κλπ) Με ΑΝΕΛ δύσκολο να νομιμοποιήσεις την κάναβη, αλλά έτσι κι αλλιώς όλος ο κόσμος πίνει σαν να μην υπάρχει αύριο! :-)"
