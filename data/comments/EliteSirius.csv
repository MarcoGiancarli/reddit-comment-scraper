EliteSirius,3dvwjq,DBenzie,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"Greetings Commander Seaworth,    I've actually been thinking about this topic a bit myself and I'll let you know I'm right there with you in terms of having open lines of communication. I feel that it is very important to create purpose for the combat to enhance the experience and immersion not only for yourself, but for others. Regardless if they are a roleplayer or not a story and purpose driven communication improves the experience for everyone involved.    I personally have been operating with about 7 macros lately while doing my heavy undermining of Hudson's territory as well as patrol interdictions within our territory. I have found an astoundingly high level of successful interactions (read: I obtained my objective) with this method. Granted I also am typically flying my war Python, Sojourn. Obviously a lot of the popular ships can out run me, denying me an actual kill when I'm solo. However I have found that preventative interdiction by a very determined pilot with a 4A interdictor gets very annoying to opponents. While my success isn't the point, the effect of the communication is. It explains to my victims why I am targeting, and that I will continue to chase them until they comply with my wishes. Some people see a big heavy Python, and they choose to defy my will and run. Some don't want to take the chance, so they comply. Some run, few succeed.    What is important about that is that these people know your intent and they are able to make more informed choices for their gameplay. In the objective based PVP (at least that's how I play PVP in Powerplay) you have purposes, methods and limits on how you can affect your target, and more importantly Powerplay and the background simulation through your actions. Different powers/locations have different ways of being interacted with, and as much as I love this document, it's too restrictive. A document like this is a restricting force on Li supporters, and would be written differently, in my opinion.    I would really like to see the document be more written as a published governmental notice issued to travelers who may interact with employees and contractors working with Sirius Gov. Something highly publicized on the visitors center for the faction, and members of our faction can remind commanders of its existence during routine patrol stops or other situations where appropriate.    This alternate document would instead outline to visiting civilian, military and freelance Commanders how they can expect to be treated within our space. The document could have attached a complete, publicly viewable list of all Sirius Gov subsidiaries, partners and independent contractors who have agreed to abide by the document.    With this structure, instead of having rules you can express the Do's & Do Nots for our visitors, defining a law of sorts. Only stipulating that supporting Commanders will, to the best of their ability attempt to communicate and offer alternative options prior to hostile engagement as appropriate for the given situation. This is the only ""rule"" or ""stipulation"" I would require of supporters.    I was part of a Freelancer community a long time ago, by the name of DiscoveryGC. Fantastic community, great mod. They are a roleplaying community that is, or at least was one of the bigger sub communities. They had some very strict rules dictating how combat could and could not occur and they all stemmed from forced roleplay text chat being both used, and responded to prior to any engagement occurring. Breach of this rule led to various punishments depending on the circumstances. Over all, this ruined a lot of the fun in the game.    One of the biggest things to remember, is that when it comes to chat communications at the start of an engagement, binding our supporters to a ruleset that can potentially strip them of the ability to both maintain their agreement, and maintain tactical superiority in a given situation is a bad thing. Hence I point back to my ""one"" statement regarding the Commanders who would agree to the document.    I want this to be put in place. Something solid, understanding, and authoritative that gives our agents room to wiggle while operating, but is put in a way that outlines to others who aren't part of our faction what they can expect from us. My desire from this is for it to go main stream for our faction members to abide by, thus encouraging our faction members to want to participate in Open, and unaffiliated civilians to want to live in our space due to having a protecting force that claims the systems. Visiting commanders from other factions can partake of the wealth of our territories, while ensuring that they have a clear set of rules to abide by, and are aware of the consequences of violating those rules.    I'd be happy to write up a mock up of how I think this would be if anyone is interested in this take on the proposal?"
EliteSirius,3dvwjq,ArsenCross,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:11:33 2015 UTC,"Fantastic! Thanks for taking the time to put forward some great constructive criticism. The last thing I want is to restrict players, I think what was intended as tongue-in-cheek legalese and contractual-styled RP may have come across as too serious!  There was however a point to all of this: You've flown with me many many times and you know as much as I love PvP, I don't like killing other players if I can help it - especially now I fly the most expensive specialist combat ship available, the Fer-de-Lance, I don't like using my monetary advantage to bully other players out of open - or Sirius forbid - the game entirely!  I'd love to take this through several drafts with you and other CMDRs from our community to create a type of code of conduct that is based around chivalry in combat and all that that entails. I like the idea of providing a welcoming community for players, somewhere where they can feel safe to trade and return exploration data as well as fulfill combat roles such as PP activity or bounty-hunting. I even encourage piracy (although perhaps not in our space!) as long as it is an entertaining player interaction. Some of the most fun I've had in game has been when trading and being pirated by players.  One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not interested in imposing my will or play-style on anyone. I don't claim to speak for the community or faction as a whole, only to spark discussion and to reach democratic decisions on subjects such as this. Anyone who wants to join me in playing like this is welcome, and the Harriers is the perfect place for that. The Harriers are a subsiduary, a player group, and there are many on this sub, and probably many more outside of reddit based on forums and external sites - each and every one tailored to a certain play-style.  I'm very excited by this community and my wish is for more people to get involved and participate - not only in our faction, but across the whole of E:D. I understand those who prefer playing in private groups or solo if that is their choice, but I only hope that they aren't doing so because they are afraid of playing in open. My goal is to make the universe of E:D as active and vibrant as possible.  EDIT: I nearly forgot to address the macros - I was working on some last night (unfortunately as you know I'm playing on a mac temporarily so AutoHotkey doesn't work, but I found an alternative called Keyboard Maestro which, while it doesn't work completely as intended with E:D, is still useful for assigning text to the clipboard which I can then paste manually. Here are my comms messages intended for those who have broken the ToS (namely killed one of our own without communicating at all). Each line is under 100 characters:  You are in breach of Sirius Corp ToS for Common Economic Protocol, Asset recovery is now in effect.  Spacecraft, personal effects and cargo are now subject to forfeiture effective immediately.  Asset recovery may result in termination of biological functions.  Set throttle to zero and prepare to negotiate new terms of service."

EliteSirius,3dvwjq,Xefferman,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"I will have to agree that the first draft is rather limiting for employees (will foreigners be forced to abide by these rules as well?), and while it is a noble idea, there may be several underlying issues.    Some sort of communication prior to opening fire/running is preferred (and is thought of some as polite), but this does not always happen whether one is the hunter or the prey. On every occasion of a successful interdiction by myself or in a wing, our prey ran immediately. Opening communications, despite my typing speed, would have been seconds wasted as our target boosted away upon dropping out of supercruise. Communications were opened, but I always assume they will make a run for it, especially in a smaller craft.    I never use what I call ""the 99% vs 1% Reddit card"" argument, but I think the point has to be made at least once here. This argument is commonly used for questioning whether targeted preparation/expansion campaigns are actually effective considering a large number of players (varies depending on power) doesn't view their respective power's subreddits. This argument can be countered by the argument that if the agents in the subreddit pump resources into their targets fast enough, those systems will be at the top of the lists for all other players to see- and thanks to hivemind mentality, those unreached players dump their resources into the systems we wanted anyway.    This argument can also be applied to the Terms of Service proposal- outside of making Galnet news, I am not entirely sure how this contract will be known to the rest of the commanders flying out there, Sirius Corp or otherwise. Sadly we cannot post important notices for all to see at the entrance and exit of a station or at arrival point.    With any contract or terms of service agreement, there will be those that comply and those that don't. So, if anything, it should be assumed by visitors that this is usually how things are conducted, but not necessarily always.    I think  many Sirius Business members are on vacation. And while I can't speak for the whole council, our in-house guidelines are generally summarized as ""enjoyment"". Take this how you will and please take heed to any interpretations made, ne'er-do-wells!    s7    (edit because formatting)"
EliteSirius,3dvwjq,Black_Fox_027,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback man, the consensus is certainly that the first draft is too restrictive, I think that comes mainly from getting too involved in the RP element of Sirius - it encourages contracts and disclaimers, but they're only ever meant to be tongue-in-cheek!  I think the best way to reach players outside of reddit is to work on a few drafts of the ToS as a community and make an animated video explaining the system. If it can garner enough attention, the ultimate goal should be to get it into the newsletter. I'd be interested to see what % of players are signed up to receive it but I bet that the reach is huge. If we could get something on Galnet, it would be great too, but by it's nature, it's not the type of newsfeed that supports external links. It would be good at generating interest though, which is the main thing."
EliteSirius,3dvwjq,ollobrains,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"Cry baby excuse maneuver. This is nothing more than a way for habitual whiners to set them selves up with a viable excuse for dying. Nothing more. If you die. It is because you weren't prepared, you didn't react correctly or in time, you are unable to adapt, or you lack the coordination required to move your fingers and escape or win the fight. Absolutely veto. Quit crying. It shouldnt require a subset of rules governing PvP in order for you to be competitive. PvP etiquette has ruined games in the past. It just creates an elitist group of people who claim to be the true and only saints of what should and shouldn't be allowed in PvP. No Thanks. I do not subscribe to this mentality. Please save us from your bureaucratic ideology."
EliteSirius,3dvwjq,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"EDIT - Please don't downvote dissenting opinions, we can't have a debate if we all agree with each other!  Hey buddy, simmer down there! I understand your reservations but its just a bit of RP fun, the whole shtick with Li Yong-Rui is that it is corporation and so the bureaucracy is all tongue-in-cheek - hence the massive disclaimers and the over the top use of 'legalese'. You are right though, so let me cut through the bull and explain my motivation.  The thing is - I love PvP. I want more of it. Only, I don't see many CMDRs around at all! Sure, instancing means I won't get to see some players, but it seems a lot more people play in solo or private groups since PowerPlay lifted a lot of restrictions on combat.  Before PowerPlay, the only circumstances in which you would kill someone were:   if you were in Anarchic space the target was a criminal the attacker was a criminal   Since PP, you can (with impunity) kill anyone on your turf who has pledged to an opposing power, and furthermore, bounties gained for interdiction and murder (for example during undermining) are rarely for one of the Major Powers (Empire, Federation or Alliance), but instead are for minor powers. Also there seem to be less people with Kill Warrant Scanners. All in all there's less consequence for having a bounty, so it's more common (or perhaps more acceptable) to commit murder now. What this means is, if you play in open you're more likely to have a PvP encounter. For those who like it? Fantastic! For those who don't? Solo or private groups. This is bad for PvP.  So - my goal is to bring more people back into open by making them feel more comfortable about PvP encounters. In my experience the one thing that really riles people up and makes them frustrated enough to stop playing in open is when they get instakilled. Let me explain what I mean by that with an example: interdicting a player, then immediately opening fire and killing that player without making any contact via voice or text comms.  That shit just ain't no fun.  What I'm encouraging with this proposal is simple:   Talk to each other before you open fire. Don't just run away silently from someone who's made the effort to talk to you. If the fight is completely one sided - give the other guy an 'out'. Let him run with his tail between his legs and tell him what you'll do to him if you see him again!   The proposed consequence of this? Nothing. It's simple, if someone doesn't like all this procedure, then they simply flag themselves as silent PvPers, and you don't extend the courtesy of this code of conduct to them. They won't mind because they don't care about RPing or mercy, they just want to watch things explode. The consequences in the proposal (blacklisting, auditing and Asset Recovery) are just legalese for 'we're gonna form a posse and revenge kill you' (which is loads of fun) or 'if we see you round these parts again, that's a paddlin.'  Manners maketh the man. Those who doesn't show manners, won't receive manners. Simple. I honestly think PvP would be greatly improved if we got a bit more friendly rivalry on the go. Every Holmes needs a Moriarty, every Batman a Joker. I personally have been cultivating an archenemy of my own for a while: /u/black_fox_027 - a Winters diplomat - offered an olive branch to us, but I thought it would be a lot more fun to rebuke him instead, and thankfully the subreddit was with me. I hope they feel the same way, I've had a lot of fun undermining Winters, but just as the Joker would never kill the Batman, I wouldn't want to see their faction wiped off the face of the Galaxy Map.  After all - what fun would E:D be if we were at peace with everyone?"

If CMDR so n so hasn't had an incident reported against him/her after x amount of months or so they should be removed from the list methinks.

I don't know how I feel about fifth column actions, I think they leave a bit of a bad taste in the mouth, but I acknowledge that they exist and that some players do see it as legit. It would probably have to be a database with a whitelist, although people can and will always find a way to get through security measures.  I think when it comes to getting removed, people could probably just submit a request and we put it to the group - if someone really holds a grudge against them, then they'd probably end up staying on the list through some kind of veto system?

EliteSirius,3dpzor,CMDR_Kris76,0,Sun Jul 19 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"Another important factor to consider is the number of exploited systems for a system we wish to prepare. The overhead costs rise very fast with the total number of exploited systems. The exact formula isn't known AFAIK, but i've read it's proportional to cube of exploited systems. So if we consider two systems with same CC potential value, the one with less exploited systems would be preferable."
EliteSirius,3dpzor,NeuralParity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:54:58 2015 UTC,"Hm, sounds good. For this reason we should calculated to have two Ctrl-System with less exploiting, and therefore a bigger overlapping, or on system wit bigger exploiting. Hmm.

EliteSirius,3dhhva,CMDR_Quantrix,7,Thu Jul 16 08:55:12 2015 UTC,"We weren't under expectation, oh no sir. What's missing in the result list is that we fought those battles while at the same time successfully expanding into 7 systems providing high income, while our enemies were just fighting. We got more expansions then Winters, Patreus and Antal combined, and they didn't get the good ones from their lists. Winters lost the war for Lugh (a 120cc system) where they burned some 30000 expansion packages. Also our expansion list for this cycle is solid: no low-income systems in the list (great job done there), three systems have >100cc, and it's just the number of systems we can manage while keeping up pressure against our neighbours. Have a look at the mess in our enemies lists to get some idea of how well Sirius did last cycle."
EliteSirius,3dhhva,cmdrjamesoff,3,Thu Jul 16 10:42:54 2015 UTC,"We certainly do a great job, no doubt about that.  It's just that I checked the fights just before getting some sleep, I saw three close fights where we were ahead and a last minute push by Antal. When I woke up, we held only one out of four.

Midgard is really a dick move by Antal, given that we where real nice about Ewah.    APALOK will be strongly opposed. The Jotun group will fight for it. Maybe we need to be more focused, I feel we start to spread a bit too thin manpower wise. We managed to put V774 Tauri in the list, small victory there. W7 prep thread updated."

EliteSirius,3dhhva,Etherealequinox,2,Thu Jul 16 10:04:38 2015 UTC,"Something going wrong: I have looked at Kassimshipa and Apalok around 6:00. At this moment we are in front in Kassimhipa but back in Apalok. I quickly load my python, but arrived in Apalok I see we are in front about 500 bucks. Ok if we have both Kassi and Apa I put my load for sure onto Apa.  At 7:00 our headstart in Apa raises and in Kassi stays. Everything fine also around 7:07. But where is the end of the week restart? 7:14 the advantage in kassim drops to 150. Hm, brief but more then Patreus. Then End-of-Week and we lost Kassimshipa. This smells like a foul play. If I have know that this round goes until 7:30 not 7:00 I could load more to Kassi.  If the week really ends at 7:00 Kassimshipa should belongs to Sirius not Patreus !!!  Slightly the same for OTO. Around 7:00 we are in advantage about 14%. But OTO I did not track that exactly then Kassimshipa.   It smell's a bit..."

We shouldn't give it up to Mahon too easily, though.  I'm thinking a bit long term here. At some point, Antal might collapse - although the pirates might go first. We should ensure we're well placed if that happens, and try to block other powers from doing the same.   If Antal doesn't collapse - even better! Then we have a friendly neighbour with whom we have a MoU."

The others won't be good enough to cover the increased overhead.  Luckily (?) we have run out of the really good systems anyway.  So I suggest we concentrate on preparing Oto and Mundigal.

Given recent history it would be wise to assume that there is going to be a last minute surge of support for FW.  We need to be ahead of the game and push this system to resist this.
EliteSirius,3d916t,grut_nartaq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:18:04 2015 UTC,"I usually don't engage in undermining, so I won't claim my suggestion is the best. But as nobody else has suggested anything yet, here are my thoughts:  Both Winters and Hudson are not expanding in our direction at the moment, so no obvious targets from that.  Hudson's control systems near us have been undermined already, so not much to gain there either.  Winter is heavily fighting over Lugh, but that system is far away from us.  We once lost a fight over Lumbla against Winters. Currently it's 33% undermining vs 16% fortification. As a large portion of Winter's forces is engaged in Lugh, which is on the other side of their space, there is a real chance they won't be able to fortify Lumbla in time. Lumbla is worth 160 CC to them, so it hurts if successfully undermined. Seems like a reasonable target to me.  Just my $0.02."
EliteSirius,3d916t,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:00:32 2015 UTC,Good enough for me. I'll see if I can add a few hundred to the undermine efforts.

EliteSirius,3d916t,Lyvan_Kitaen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:13 2015 UTC,You can combine efforts with players from other powers.  All the undermining goes toward the same total.  See the offer from ALD posted in the Reddit for example.

Love the thought to put this together. I definitely see the value in census collection.
EliteSirius,3d43cq,ArsenCross,2,Mon Jul 13 11:13:52 2015 UTC,Given Fdev are so secretive i think this may be a fairly fair evaluation.  So based on this we are top 4 HQ traffic location but top 6 powerplay ( a good sign we have more upside expansion wise and manpower wise)  10% or so of all players perhaps in some way tied in with powerplay is a good sign
EliteSirius,3d43cq,ollobrains,2,Mon Jul 13 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"Worth mentioning that while we may be top 4 here, that's not an accurate statement on Sirius manpower, since we also offer competitive prices on all ships and outfitting.  People come to Lembava to buy their shit."
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,CheroSirius,2,Mon Jul 13 09:18:19 2015 UTC,"I also am fond of thinking long term on the strategy front. However it's been pointed out elsewhere on here that it's difficult to control the commanders not directly affiliated with the group. In order to guarantee specific results we need either a lot of support, or deep wallets. Unfortunately the current communication tools available in game make support hard to build unless it's from people actively seeking a group outside the game.   edit, because I hit submit early.    I definitely want to see a roleplay focus in game towards being a very secure, highly profitable sector of space, and more importantly a faction that actively works to improve the quality of life in the systems within its territory. Boosting the wealth, population and tech levels of systems within our territory.  We could possibly even approach from a philanthropic angle on system acquisition if it proves valuable in terms of CC gains to flip systems within a control systems influence.  No matter what though we are going to get to the point where our factions gains will need to be addressed like business decisions. Planning now will enable us to create ways of keeping control of the situation to achieve the goals of the group."

The terraforming colony of te kaha ( sirius corp)  The powerplay faction is sirius gov but doesnt even own its parent corporate factions HQ system of sirius which is in the exploit node of sol.  Weve chosen lembava commodities as the primary faction in lembava our HQ system and also site of the community goals that have then given collected exploration data to sirius corp to build the deep space terraforming colonies.  But the CCs are loss making and that just doenst rate highly for siruis gov yet.  I tried to pre the first system in that direction back from tijula of hagen i think it was and got shouted down and the mob hoo hared it so it has been taken off.  And with no way of guiding minor factions to build new colonies, to change population of systems and expand space we are awaiting FDev to make things work background sim wise."
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,ollobrains,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:10:29 2015 UTC,Most players just want to take the best CC sytems and then once we reach a certain size defend our space and attack other enemies rather than taking uncontrolled loss makign system.  So sirius inc has accepted this as a group and we now work with the best logical outcome and the status quo remains until Fdev allow mroe things to develop
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the issue with the mechanics as they stand... the loss making systems/low income ones that become controls that are then nor fortified. So we need to tread carefully.  But that could change at any time, given Fdevs are notorious tinkers. At which point a new direction might be possible, if enough folks are in agreement."
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,ollobrains,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:29:11 2015 UTC,allowing the background simulation to change the population and economic strength of a system would be a good start ( both up and down) so that things u do in the local minor faction level then flow through into the powerplay level and that both levels have better intergration ( i doubt Fdev would fully meet this) so some basic interaction would be nice
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The minor faction part should be more influential. This has been suggested many times on the main Frontier Forums. Hopefully, now there is a 'PP suggestions' thread from Fdev, they might adopt some of this stuff in the medium term."
EliteSirius,3d3xcv,CMDR_Quantrix,2,Mon Jul 13 10:33:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, flipping government to our preferred government will be the key to being a large power. Halving the amount of fortification required allows us to have a lot more control systems. And if it ever influences population and economic strength, we would rock!  But it's a lot of work to flip. We control over 400 systems now. The wall was predicted to be at 600 systems, but it's being eased by FDev so I expect the top powers being able to support even more than that. Some will be corporation already, but I'm still talking about flipping hundreds of systems. At say one a day, we're talking about many months.  But it seems so worth it! Well, to me at least :)"

As an example, there is a large track of space between us and ALD/Patreus, that is unclaimed. It therefore offers a lot of expansion opportunity, and the deal with ALD helps. Now, a guy from Patreus was asking around the other day about doing a similar deal... from my pov I felt it was not Worth pursuing as - at the moment - they are on a downward trajectory and, if we had a deal with both ALD & Patreus, that begins to limit how much expansion we can do in that area. Obviously others might feel differently, and are welcome to think of proposals. But, to circle back to the point, what I am trying to say, is that - although it is all over the place to some degree - there is some longer term thinking going on, and I invite you (and everyone) to contribute to that (not that you need or want my invitation).  The absolute key is communication, and keeping an eye on the threads, or joining the teamspeak, adding people as friends in game.

EliteSirius,3cw6jk,Tesshin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:50:24 2015 UTC,Sounds good ( this is still secondary to our powerplay activities of course) but a lot of players do visit lembava a lot to pickup powerplay merits to haul ( and the missions can generate some income to pay for extra credits etc) so its a good way of killing 2 birds with one stone
EliteSirius,3cw6jk,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:55:52 2015 UTC,Lem commodities from 84% down to 34% today ( but the background sim is whacky at the moment) thats in aasganau.  Boom is pending - we are still up from a starting base of 8% 3 days ago so if Fdev have made a fix then this may be where we are really at.  In lembava itself we are at 17% this is up from 12% 2 days ago and 5% at the start of the week.  This will be slower due to more player traffic but keep those missions up in and out of both systems to and from lembava commodities
EliteSirius,3cw6jk,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:53:46 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, when a minor faction expands to a nearby system, its influence in the originating system takes a huge dive.  So the drop from 84% to 34% might indicate it has expanded.  Firing up the game now to check..."
EliteSirius,3cw6jk,TotesMessenger,2,Sat Jul 11 11:43:38 2015 UTC,"nah no expansion state was entered into unfornatlye chekced that out.  And based on my experiments elsewhere its usually 20% or so.  Nah there has been wild gyrations across all of space i think Fdev has tweaked something, as of todays tick values were back to normal.  So given 8 - 17 to xxx to 32% id say we are still moving in the other direction and 84$ maybe should have been 24% or something yesterday and it has returned to normal today ( remembering sirius gov suppresses influence changes by about half) so insead of 16% per day its 8-10% but that also means any enemy factions move against us are slowed as well  But that is what it is and at the same time indepdants have less of that i think imperial and federation factions have more of it ?  Thats why im advocating a wide array of missions if we can get economic boom + expansion and also brief periods of lockdown ( raise security but lower wealth for the duration of state) raising our security then allows our military to fund the expansion once a bom is over ( tested this elsewhere to)  But we are on the right track"

EliteSirius,3cveps,DBenzie,4,Sat Jul 11 02:30:10 2015 UTC,The corporations bear a responsibility to sustaining the basic right of our citizens.  Shadow President Felicia Winters   We need to be careful who we get in bed with. next we know we will be incorporated into the federation and paying a social security tax.... 'Thanks Winters...'   /s
EliteSirius,3cveps,grut_nartaq,3,Sat Jul 11 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"I see all this peace agreements coming about and generally I dont like it. But my justification is not based on strategy, its just more of a gameplay and lore thing for me.  There will be no powerplay if everyone is just going to be friends with eachother.   If there are any good strategic reasons for non aggression pact with Winters then I dont mind that if we gain something from it.  And also, keeping all of this is check would be impossible. There will always be bunch of people with each power who have completely different pacts then we got on reddit. So I think meta-game wise we are painting ourselfs into a corner. We should focus on prep, control and expand and dont get distracted by all this metagame business imo.  This is just my hunch, take it for what you want."
EliteSirius,3cveps,Tesshin,3,Sat Jul 11 08:05:59 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, our current position is so ridiculously good in terms of unoccupied high value systems for us to expand into that potential cease fire agreements have no downside.  From the very beginning of power play our best expansion options have been and continue to be away from everyone else.  By agreeing not to encroach on other powers we are giving up very little, if anything.  edit: Reading the other responses in this thread I've changed my mind.  While we don't have anything to lose, we also have nothing to gain from this agreement, while Winters very much does."
EliteSirius,3cveps,Xjph,2,Sat Jul 11 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"Nuts!  What would we gain from them: Nothing. They can control their members even less than we can here, given their numbers outside of reddit.  What would they gain: Possibly Oto for good. Once a power gets a system it is really hard to conquer it back.  No way I'm supporting this treaty. In fact I will actively work against it."
EliteSirius,3cveps,sound-of-words,2,Sat Jul 11 07:26:53 2015 UTC,"No, Oto is a shield, if you decide to let go Oto you'll just have the fight in LHS 1743 or Af Leporis, that's all. Fight for it, guys."
EliteSirius,3cveps,Gilmund,2,Sat Jul 11 08:46:25 2015 UTC,"Well, Winters has massive opposition from all neighbours, while we have an amazing strategic position. (lots of high value sys in our backyard.) I see no point in such treaty right now (i.e. I think its a terrible idea)   1 OTO is very much like 39 Tauri and Akkadia : undermining honeypots for other powers, which is good as they waste lots of effort on those. 2 We gain nothing from giving it away, and I don't see any interesting stuff we'd like from her, beside a bunch of pulse disruptors XD 3 alliance with alliance is excellent, deal with Lavigny people proved good, and non-aggression pact with Antal is also good. On the other hand peace/cease-fire with Winters ? Not so much. 4 If we were into such an agreement : first we take OTO, then we mount a massive undermining OP in their territory. And then we deal from a position of strength."
EliteSirius,3cveps,CMDRMuetdhiver,2,Sat Jul 11 10:17:39 2015 UTC,"I add my voice to the 'No' camp on this one. Winters and Hudson deals offer nothing to us in my view, either short or medium term. As the two powers stuck in the middle, and as the main enemy of Empire powers, there is little need for us to get involved in any scraps other than of our own making, and in our own interest.  There is little suggestion that, in their current state, fighting on many fronts, that the Feds have the time and resources to really press us. We can therefore continue to do our own thing, without too many worries. When the time comes, with our other existing treaties, we can then start to look to be more agressive to them if the opportunity arises from a position of strength, and in the knowledge that we have good agreements with others doing the same thing from other angles."
EliteSirius,3cveps,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:39:57 2015 UTC,Yes we need to gain as many advantages as we can for now and oto is a big swing system so grab it first
EliteSirius,3cveps,ollobrains,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:35:47 2015 UTC,I am not sure how to undermine exactly. For example Achlys -- I see it is Contested. What do I do to help Sirius - Li Yong-Rui there?
EliteSirius,3cveps,Clark82,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"Hey CMDR Optio, if you want to undermine Winters, you go to that system and destroy Fed-Aid vessels or Federal Agents. There's a more detailed guide here in the PowerPlay manual on page 9"
EliteSirius,3cveps,Clark82,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:53:41 2015 UTC,Okay - I thought so - wasnt 100%. So cruise around Achlys and look for Fed-Aid vessels and Feds. Okay. Thank you.
EliteSirius,3cveps,NeuralParity,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"Strategic, it make sense to minimise our surface area exposed to other powers as the vast majority of undermining happens on border systems. Setting up border systems close to their space means we can in-fill system with minimal opposition.  I'm somewhat confused as to what is actually being proposed. We cede Oto, and they become nominal allies? I'm not sure how much of a difference a nominal non-aggresive stance would have. The fed are stuck in the middle with opposition on all sides so it's way more effort for them to contest systems than it is for us since most of our systems are unopposed whereas they have to fight for pretty much every one of theirs."
EliteSirius,3cveps,TokisVarx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:30:22 2015 UTC,We fight her for it! Who would we farm for merits if not Winters?
EliteSirius,3cveps,ollobrains,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:14:46 2015 UTC,I think a majority agree here that we should take oto and make sure we keep it.  It is a very strategic system and ive already dropped 200 points into it today.
EliteSirius,3cveps,cmdrjamesoff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:47:41 2015 UTC,"Personally I could accept a cease fire with Winters after taking Oto, and then only if Lavigny-Duvals faction doesn't object. That treaty is far better for us, because it puts nearby enemies into a two front war."

EliteSirius,3cq3kr,ollobrains,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:03 2015 UTC,Well u can continue to support youre minor power of choice that is a small minor factio and ongoing expansion and it can rise to a power  what npc faction does cosmic state support as far as non powerplay npc minor faction.  If the fifth colms pull it off and im going to undermine hel to try to stop it. But if u do end up within sirius gov we could then assisting in growing the npc faction id like to see one of the player supported npc factions grow.  But not the mercs of mikunn either
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,tyro17,2,Thu Jul 9 22:46:40 2015 UTC,I believe they support the League of Hel in that system
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,phantagor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"I like you ollobrains, but sometimes you should employ some more punctuation marks :)  Appart from this: we are supporting the League of Hel in Hel and Lie Yu Kou and working on the Defense Party of Nastrond in Nastrond, Taribes, Daruwutja and Wonorne Nu as a side project.  And sure, we also welcome any help with pushing the League of Hel."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,PanRagon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:05:06 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't expand into Hel or Lie Yu Kou, as it doesn't seem to be in either of our interests. However, if this does happen (ugh, infiltration), I'll gladly assist in pushing forward the minor factions you are in favor of, or keep avoiding the systems altogether like I do now. As far as I'm concerned, these systems should remain in the hands of the Cosmic State, regardless of whether it technically gets picked up by the Sirius power.  I know none of us have any wishes to pursue a hostile relationship towards you guys. I believe co-existing like we do now is in everyone's best interest.  Fly safe!"
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,ollobrains,2,Fri Jul 10 02:54:34 2015 UTC,Its just a shame that local minor npc factions dont have a mechanism for removing powerplay factions from within their systems.  The only way that uncontrolled systems can throw off the overlord is if it gets opposed in expansion or weakend.  Or the minor npc factions in those systems become powerplay factions themselves
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,PanRagon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"It's a bit silly. I understand that Frontier doesn't want player driven factions, but you should atleast be allowed to fight stuff off when you're still un-pledged."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,ollobrains,3,Fri Jul 10 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"My god, we can have two stickies now.  A new age of reddit is upon us!"
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,2,Wed Jul 15 00:26:18 2015 UTC,Sirius inc will continue the lem comodities support.  At the same time our main goal pending membership growth is ongoing support of sirius gov.  Usually we follow gilmunds threads and respond to areas of need
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CMDR_Quantrix,2,Thu Jul 9 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"A new call for V774 Tauri. It is worth almost double to us that Lao Yano. It sells metals v cheap for those who are looking to make the trip worth it to their bank balance. It only has medium pads, and it is essecntial you drop to 0 speed on dropping in. Currently it is about 350 merits behind Lao Yano.  For those prepping LY... if there is a reason behind it, please do say- no reason to compete inwardly at all, if something makes sense, but right now I can't see it."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,Watson_203,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:04 2015 UTC,V774 Tauri should be #10 now - I've spent a million or two to fast track it.
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:59:13 2015 UTC,BD+49 1280 is seeing some quite heavy undermining. I'm currently running 8 cargo a pop to fortify but could do with some help!
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:25:03 2015 UTC,Pranav Antal is outprepping us in Ewah.
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,Cackluptuous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:17:06 2015 UTC,And Patreus is outprepping us in Kassimshipa.  And Patreus is almost equal in Apalok.  It's shaping up to be a tough cycle for us.
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Heverduduna has reached it's Fortify trigger.  I'm going to take a quick break to eat/caffeinate, then start making some more CR to keep the fasttracked quotas coming."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,ollobrains,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:53:41 2015 UTC,Lao Yano is back... at number 6 now with over 1300. A total shithole.
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,mattpaley,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:53:00 2015 UTC,It would appear a mr x type of individual really wants that system in there
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,mattpaley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"Oto is a lost cause and everything below Hel needs some serious work if they are going to make the expansion threshold.  I have been grinding NLTT 13249 all weekend and put about 600 on it, this one should be safe by tomorrow.  On prepping Kassimshipa and Apalok are almost dead heats so could go either way.  It looks like there is alot of work to do this week."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CMDRMuetdhiver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:43:48 2015 UTC,Wow - someone just put another 500 on NLTT 13249 taking it well over the threshold.
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"For information, the Jotun people will focus their effort on Apalok tomorrow. They are thinking about some other objectives for wednesday evening. (either prep or expansion)."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"I'd humbly request they also help out with dumping Lao Yano out of the list by pushing up Masses a bit, and crucially, V774 Tauri. You can do nice trade runs between Lembava and V774 at the same time. If we can get Lao Yano number 10 in the list, we can switch focus to V774 to push that up. Happy Bastille day - I will be on most of the day I hope"
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Munchiem also works - although is worth a little less. Either way, it is most important to not get LaoYano in the list."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"ok, wow... not sure if it was you/us... but lets push Muncheim and V774 Tauri now, if we can... Push out LY and Ewah (which looks lost)"
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"Muncheim is #8 at the moment, and I've pushed V774 Tauri to #10 (locally it reported a number that is higher than the current #10, but the overview hasn't been updated yet).  Although it went faster than I expected, so I think I was not the only one prepping V774 Tauri."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,Amshai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"Marvellous, merci. I will check when I get home tonight."
EliteSirius,3cq3kr,CDMRMatzov,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:40:18 2015 UTC,I put 200 towards Apalok just now and pushed us past Patreus for a while anyway.
