susancoffey,35dyu7,asianextinction,-6,Sat May 9 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"It looks like Star Wars: The Old Republic.  Her character is wearing Karagga's Unyielding Helm, so it's clear she has good taste."

susancoffey,2z3zmm,getoverit_now,4,Sun Mar 15 09:45:19 2015 UTC,This was a nice change of pace. I'd like the red hair back soon though.
susancoffey,2z3zmm,lordofbuttsecks,2,Sun Mar 15 11:21:57 2015 UTC,"Unless she's seducing the fair-haired cameraman, I suggest you may mean ""Seductive blonde""."
susancoffey,2z3zmm,Red-zedd,0,Sun Mar 15 10:43:30 2015 UTC,"""Seducingly blond"""
susancoffey,2z3zmm,Red-zedd,-1,Sun Mar 15 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"""Seducingly blond""   ""Seducingly blonde"". But ""seducingly"" isn't English. The adverbial form is ""seductively"", with ""seductive"" as the adjective. Though you would get away with ""seducingly"" in poetry or high literature.  ""Blonde"" is the female form. ""Blond"" is masculine, almost exclusively so."
susancoffey,2z3zmm,Red-zedd,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:41:04 2015 UTC,"Right, thank you, will try to do better in future. Not a native speaker here... It's still a lovely, albeit blonde picture of Susan."
susancoffey,2z3zmm,Red-zedd,-1,Mon Mar 16 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool and :) for sure. I was just trying to help, albeit with a soupçon of bitter sarcasm. But don't worry about it overly much. Even native users of English get away with mangling her atrociously, especially writers. Try some James Joyce, someday, when you feel like having a migraine. He's great for those.   Well, widdyano, my spell-checker liked ""soupçon""! Maybe I should celebrate with ""the soups on me, folks"". Or not.   And it is a lovely image of a lovely young lady. Thank you."

susancoffey,2kuuy3,drakore,5,Fri Oct 31 04:49:37 2014 UTC,"Well, once upon a time...  The top mod (the guy that was over me) deleted all the CSS, un-modded me and made the subreddit private.  For whatever reason, there's no notification sent out when these types of changes happen so I was unaware for a bit.  Once I figured out what happened, I requested control of the sub from the Admins (which I ultimately got).  Well, dumb me forgot to un-private the subreddit for a little bit of time on top of the rest.    We're back up and going now.  New CSS is being worked on and will be implemented soon."
susancoffey,2kuuy3,JoyousCacophony,2,Fri Nov 7 03:54:01 2014 UTC,"well that mod sounds like a douche, thanks for replying to this, you rock"
susancoffey,2kuuy3,Locnil,3,Fri Nov 7 04:25:26 2014 UTC,"It really came as a surprise because he wasn't a douche.  Well, at least in my limited dealings with him he seemed okay enough.  I'm guessing he did the same thing on any subreddit he was top mod on, and he modded quite a few subs.  Either way, I'm just happy the admins gave me the sub so it could open up again :)"
susancoffey,2kuuy3,JoyousCacophony,3,Fri Nov 7 05:05:50 2014 UTC,"i am to, i woulda hated to see this sub go"
susancoffey,2kuuy3,voxhavoc,2,Fri Nov 7 06:31:52 2014 UTC,"Ah, so that explains it. I was quite sad for a while, and wondered why my messages got no reply. Was about to give up, but just checked here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  Still, at least it's back up and running! Shame about the CSS though. Is there any way to recover it? Wayback Machine, etc.? Who was the previous mod?"

And I just took a look through my collection of wallpapers with her, and only one I could easily extend is the one with her by the window, in gray tank top and black underwear (I think it's 5 years old picture), but it's only because left side of the wallpaper slowly gradients into black - so I would only have to fill the rest with black. But when I'm a little less busy, I'll probably look for some other pictures of her I could turn into a dual screen wallpaper!"

susancoffey,1gkrw5,jjonphotography,6,Tue Jun 18 10:20:23 2013 UTC,Did a photoshoot with Susan in NYC a few months ago. Great gal.
susancoffey,1fu1rn,akarusa,12,Fri Jun 7 01:48:19 2013 UTC,She is really hot as a brunette but I like her so much more as a redhead. Just my opinion though.
