By “quietly deleted,” I mean just that: they just removed it from their story without any indication or note to their readers that they’ve done so (though it remains in the print edition and thus requires a retraction). That’s indicative of the standard of “journalism” for the article itself. Multiple other falsehoods, and all sorts of shoddy journalistic practices, remain thus far unchanged."

Google and Microsoft could have aptly responded, ""Fuck you, you're illegal. Molon labe."" The US government depends upon Microsoft more so than Microsoft depends upon the government.

If anything, that set a clear precedent that companies of large enough size can happily break the law. Comparing Google and Microsoft to Lavabit is totally asinine - Lavabit existed as basically a non profit, and it's doubted if Lavabit ever had more than a $100k in revenues.   Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google are substantial political donors and have significant political and popular power. Microsoft (and executives) contributes more to the State of Washington than Boeing, Google contributes more to California and basically own San Francisco and surrounding areas. For example, Microsoft has built several datacenters for the US government, including an Azure-dedicated data center in Virginia for the sole use of the US government. The federal government is one of Microsoft's biggest customers and provides virtually all of the systems the US military uses for administrative operations. They're both such behemoths of power that the government shouldn't be able to afford to fuck with either of them, but as the government severely damages Microsoft and Google's global cloud business, both organizations refuse to take direct and overt action.  The least of their concerns should be threatening with jail time, the US trying to arrest a major executive for being what amounts to as a ""whistle blower"" would cement the fate of the US as being inhospitable to the global technology sector - centers of power would not stand for that. I do believe that Microsoft and Google are above the law in this regard. Plus, through ""leaking"" this information that could claim deniability, just as the White House does."

Lots and lots of people from wealthy and powerful families have signed up for military services and served all over the world. Only about 200 years ago it was pretty much expected that everyone would serve in the military in some capacity, it's just that the rich (or rich children) never made good grunts, and ended up as Officers. Yet, those Officers from bourgeoisie families still fight and die, albeit less often perhaps.   There's no evidence, and has never been any evidence, of a class conspiracy that you're alleging. I can cite several examples, from historical figures like Smedley Butler (father was a wealthy Congressmen), contemporaries like Prince Wiliam (whose whole family has served in some capacity), to just the general fact that the most elite colleges in our country still have ROTC programs, and that elite colleges were first to sign up for this programs. If you dig a bit in military history, or just sign up for the military yourself, you'll meet people from all sorts of socioeconomic classes. I came from an upper middle class family when I signed up.  In reality, elites love the action and drama of war just as much as everyone else.
