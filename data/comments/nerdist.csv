nerdist,3dzvvv,LOLRECONLOL,5,Mon Jul 20 21:46:17 2015 UTC,So Nerdist and WTF have the same guest... Which do I listen to? Both?
nerdist,3dzvvv,MaxxBaer,2,Tue Jul 21 00:38:09 2015 UTC,Go for it. I'm interested in how their convo went too.
nerdist,3dzvvv,black_messiahh,8,Tue Jul 21 01:41:25 2015 UTC,"Listen to both, but the wtf one is better. Mark disarms him quite well and he sounds much more comfortable. The nerdiest one takes a while to get going and I honestly feel it's because Chris was late.  Seems like sir Ian's guard went up from that point."
nerdist,3dzvvv,DallasGuy82,9,Tue Jul 21 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"I listened to the WTF interview first, and it was fantastic. It really felt like a conversation between two genuine guys. Chris doesn't come across as genuine in this. He comes across as an overly excited fanboy. This one was very stale. I put it down to the fact that Chris was late and didn't even apologize at all. Lots of dead air."
nerdist,3dzvvv,wallaby_al,7,Tue Jul 21 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"Ding ding!  Sometimes Chris tries to be too deep and he loses me as a listener and often the person he is interviewing as well.  It feels fake and disingenuous.  Listened to WTF now, much much better interview complete with laughs and little to no pauses.  Imagine that, Marc talked to him like a person and actor, rather than an anthropologist or philosopher, resulting in a better podcast."
nerdist,3dzvvv,TheAssCrackBandit,6,Tue Jul 21 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes situations like this are dealt with differently in the UK vs the US.  In the UK, there would be a deeply sincere apology and then an equally sincere reply that it was no bother and please don't worry. However, I think Americans tend not to go in for the ritualistic self-flagellation that us Brits do. I think Chris was probably a little embarrassed by being late and also just wanted to start the interview rather than waste any more time but maybe that didn't quite read clearly enough for Ian.  I think he relaxed as it went on and he saw how passionate Chris was about everything and some good questions were asked. And yeah, no one's happy when someone's late, but we didn't hear all of their meeting, so who knows?  tldr; Chris was lovely when I met him, us Brits just tend to rely on the formalities a little more occasionally."
nerdist,3dzvvv,buttholemuffin,3,Tue Jul 21 08:08:48 2015 UTC,"He comes across as an overly excited fanboy.   I feel like Chris does that A LOT, some episodes I swear are just hour long conversations of ""Omg, you're so funny, you like comedy? Do you want to be a comedian? You should be a comedian"" and while it doesn't provide much quality content, I actually find it easier to relate to Chris because he's just a big fan like any of the listeners, he's genuine and really excited during podcasts."
nerdist,3dzvvv,Jollyj3wbagle42,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:43 2015 UTC,I came to read the comments hoping others had listened to the others so I could see if WTF was worth listening to. After listening to this one I wasn't left with any outstanding feeling or takeaway. I'll have to give a listen to WTF. Usually I'm a bigger fan of Chris than Maron. But I'm interested to see how that went.
nerdist,3dzvvv,bigdirkmalone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:52 2015 UTC,Same here.
nerdist,3dzvvv,TheAssCrackBandit,4,Wed Jul 22 11:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think Sir Ian McKellen was quite guarded at first, possibly because as it was mentioned that Chris was late. However, I think he ""got"" Chris more once he showed knowledge of Holmes and had thoughtful observations.  I thought it was a good episode."
nerdist,3dzvvv,TheAssCrackBandit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"With you on this as well. I liked it. Hearing other stuff he has done, he seems like a much more serious person being an older Shakespearean actor like Patrick Stewart. Just a different generation."
nerdist,3dzvvv,51502112,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"I listened to Sir Ian McKellen on the Nerdist, WTF and NPR's Fresh Air podcasts, and while I enjoyed all of them, I felt like he was the most pleasant and responsive on NPR's podcast, then WTF, and the least comfortable on the Nerdist podcast. I'm not sure if it's him treating NPR as more of a commercial/business thing and the others as more of a real and honest conversation or if it's simply him just liking and disliking certain hosts?"
nerdist,3dzvvv,aerlenbach,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard him on the other two. But all this discussion has me really intrigued to hear them and focus on listening to how he responds. I didn't expect there to be as much ""controversy"" over this episode."
nerdist,3dzvvv,Jollyj3wbagle42,4,Tue Jul 21 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"He just sounds a little grumpier on the Nerdiest podcast, and there is a significant number of pauses and gaps during the podcast than the NPR and Maron ones (maybe NPR is heavily edited?), and his tone in general is just more friendly on NPR. But in general, the Maron episode was a lot more enjoyable and genuine and rich in content than the Nerdist."
nerdist,3dzvvv,mczepplin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"Agree.  Having listened to all three, this one sadly paled in comparison.  It came across as being annoyed for the host's tardiness.  I mean, who makes a knight (Gandalf & Magneto at that!) wait? The interview suffered for it.  Sir Ian came across as constantly annoyed & Nerdist had the unfortunate impact of coming off third in a three horse race. Interestingly, I recall Chris making a comment about Sir Ian being very dismissive  of him at a ComicCon panel some years ago, after a panel he moderated."
nerdist,3dzvvv,TuppyHole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:55 2015 UTC,NPR definitely edited out any long pauses.
nerdist,3dzj1i,Da_b_guy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:40 2015 UTC,I've been wondering that as well and can't find it anywhere. Maybe they're saving it to be released around someones project date.
nerdist,3dzj1i,LegalElk,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:46 2015 UTC,I really hope that's not the case because the movie that Tom and Guillermo are promoting doesn't come out until middle of October.

nerdist,3dw4v3,Crazyspaceman,6,Mon Jul 20 08:18:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if Chris mentions that time that Sir Ian totally blew him off after a panel.
nerdist,3dw4v3,pattycraq,5,Mon Jul 20 03:58:21 2015 UTC,I wonder if they're gonna mention the huge crushes on Ms. Thompson they've professed to in past episodes.
nerdist,3dw4v3,pattycraq,4,Mon Jul 20 01:58:21 2015 UTC,We can only hope. I've had a crush on her since I was a kid and saw those movies.
nerdist,3dw4v3,givamitchslap,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"I was born in '88 so my first exposure to her was Dennis the Menace, but the crush was still strong. It only got more intense as I saw younger versions of her, and seeing the picture they posted a week or two ago, she still looks damn good."
nerdist,3dqewz,blinkooo,7,Sat Jul 18 13:09:34 2015 UTC,I wanna know exactly how Chris came to Giovanni Ribisi.   What other people popped in your head?
nerdist,3dqewz,jgonz85,3,Sun Jul 19 06:04:11 2015 UTC,I thought Sean Penn.
nerdist,3dqewz,blinkooo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking Mr. Norton
nerdist,3dqewz,HailCeasar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"I've never seen The Other Sister, but damn good guess on Chris' part!"
nerdist,3dqewz,buttholemuffin,6,Tue Jul 21 16:14:49 2015 UTC,I started this one last night and I LOVE Paul Rudd. I love this sense of humor. I'm definitely going to be finishing this one while helping my dad clean his house this morning. The story about the one bored journalist had me rolling laughing.
nerdist,3dqewz,buttholemuffin,2,Sat Jul 18 13:39:11 2015 UTC,I was laughing hysterically this whole episode. Absolutely exceeded any expectations I had. Just a great guy all around with a quick sense of humor. Him and Chris riffing on their dads was great.
nerdist,3dqewz,buttholemuffin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:41:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten there yet. But I can't wait! I've always loved Paul Rudd since Anchorman, and his stuff with Tim & Eric. I just want to hug him at some point in life. I feel like he gives great hugs lol."
nerdist,3dqewz,buttholemuffin,6,Sat Jul 18 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"Also, the dead dad club. That hits close to home in the funniest way.   My grandpa has Alzheimer's. I help my dad take care of him a couple times a week. Me and my dad make the most fucked up jokes and say the most horrible funny things. People look at us like we're evil. But shit. It's how we cope with what we've already known was going to happen.   That riff was so funny. Reminds me of what me and my dad do when I'm over there."
nerdist,3dqewz,kamesama000,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:51 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Me too. My dad died six years ago also and I deal with it through humor. I was laughing so damn hard through the whole thing.   That's a great way for you and your dad to bond and get through that. Even if it's under bad circumstances.
nerdist,3dqewz,ethanw12,2,Sat Jul 18 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"We're incredibly close as it is, so this just tightens the bond. We've always had a really twisted sense of humor in my family. It helps so much."

nerdist,3dqbyd,queensinthesky,18,Sat Jul 18 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"That's gotta be Nick Offerman's story about him and his wife 69-ing. The way he casually works it in there, and how it takes Chris a second to realise what Nick had said, and then the way he just cracks up! Man, I love that snippet!  EDIT: Here's that part of the conversation (really great episode, as well), starts at about 1:10: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnuB_v961mI"
nerdist,3dqbyd,psychedelic_tortilla,10,Sat Jul 18 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a close tie between the bit Matt and Jonah have with Chris about the girl he picked up in a bar during his Singled Out days in The Expressionless episode, or Jonah's rant about Matt shitting all over his theory about mosh pits in the Snapsy episode. The out of control laughter of the guys in both episodes is contagious."
nerdist,3dqbyd,istealroadsigns,3,Sat Jul 18 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"Dude.  That expressionless conversation SLAYS me every time I listen. It never gets old. Something about how earnest Chris is in being uncomfortable, combined with everyone's commitment to the bit... I'm gonna have to listen to that again today. Tears of joy will be shed.  Thanks for the reminder!"
nerdist,3dqbyd,NstantKlassik,7,Sun Jul 19 10:05:44 2015 UTC,There are so many for me.   Aunt Slappy story. Muscles Ripley. Apple Tarts. Entire Eliza Coupe episode...I've listened to that one three times and my sides hurt from laughing so hard. Both Joe Manganeillo episodes had me in tears. Matt & Jonah show.   Also Paul Rudd and Chris riffing about their dads on yesterday's episode. My dad died 6 years ago and that made their riffing that much funnier.
nerdist,3dqbyd,Bslo18,2,Sat Jul 18 13:13:23 2015 UTC,"I have the Aunt Slappy one and Muscles Ripley on my ipod permanently, definitely have relistened to them multiple times."

nerdist,3dqbyd,HumanTrafficCone,7,Sat Jul 18 14:22:20 2015 UTC,Drunken Matt Mira is the answer to most questions in life.
nerdist,3dqbyd,wallaby_al,11,Sat Jul 18 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"Any time Chris's Jaguar is mentioned. It shouldn't still be funny, but how uncomfortable he gets makes it ten times more hilarious. Especially because he has no reason to be uncomfortable, he's one of life's good guys and deserves his success."
nerdist,3dqbyd,funktopus,3,Sat Jul 18 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I love it so much when they mention Chris' success or celebrity, because you know he hates to think of himself on that pedestal, though he works hard as hell and of course he deserves all his success!"
nerdist,3dqbyd,Galileo908,2,Sat Jul 18 14:10:48 2015 UTC,I laugh everytime Matt does this to him. It's hysterical to hear Chris react. He will pause and I can see him wince in my minds eye.   I know he's not flaunting it. Hell the man built a company from the ground up. Your allowed some nice stuff.

But as far as I'm concerned, although different... it matched both the quality and fun of the previous live eps at comic con.

Also haven't heard anything about the Leo Laporte episode or Jon Taffer. We will also have Guillermo Del Toro, Massie Williams, and Tom Hiddleston's live podcast. So we have some to look forward to on the horizon.

Sonny's fate could possibly be a twist of sorts. I guess I never really thought of The Godfather as having what we today consider ""twists.""

My dad died very suddenly six years ago when I was 19. We mended our relationship over his last six months and had similar discussions to this one. But I wish I could have one now that I'm older. But his death was completely unexpected. You just never know when it will happen. So please if you get a chance, just tell both your parents that you love them.

My dad died suddenly 2 years ago when I was 16 and I found it hard to deal with it and had to prevent the grieving process in order to help the rest of my family cope (since I had become ""The Man of the House"" and due in part to discovering the Nerdist podcast at the end of last year and immersing myself in all of the episodes I could, I discovered the Billy Hardwick episode and from there heard Chris' journey after his fathers passing helped me come to terms with my own grief which had been supressed and eventually get therapy for it. This episode is one of the most interesting of all the episodes and if anyone hasn't listened to it they really should because it's amazing and to reaffirm your point please people tell your parents, or anyone else who is important to you, that you love them."

Discovering this has helped me also. Just to grow and be a better person. Hearing hundreds of people go out and say ""if there is something you want that doesn't exist, do it or make it yourself."" Which is what led me to write summaries here and start the This Is Rad sub. But not to keep the focus on me, I understand the sentiment of having to step up. It's incredibly tough. I'm sure it made you into a better and stronger man doing it, even if it was with such negative circumstances. I hope therapy has helped you."

nerdist,3cj8ft,davect01,3,Wed Jul 8 09:50:36 2015 UTC,"I hate not being able to watch it live. I'm on the east coast and have to be up at 6:30 every day. I'm passed out by 11, so I can't watch Meltdown and @midnight. Being an adult sucks sometimes."
nerdist,3cj8ft,hutchero,3,Wed Jul 8 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"Could be worse, could be in the UK and not get it at all"
nerdist,3cj8ft,hutchero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:04:44 2015 UTC,:( are you able to access it through Comedy Central?
nerdist,3cj8ft,The1MightyBouch,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"Not without some nefarious use of vpns and the like, the problem is we have 100s of panel shows already"
nerdist,3cj8ft,LOLRECONLOL,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:46 2015 UTC,Online.  I watch it on Hulu.
nerdist,3cj8ft,mrjeremy,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:51 2015 UTC,I dislike it too. Watching it is part of my daily morning routine because I DVR it. I'm hoping the sacrifice creates some fun to listen to podcasts at comic con.
nerdist,3cj8ft,LOLRECONLOL,2,Wed Jul 8 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"They are hit and miss.  A lot depends on the ""contestants."".   A few I have not finished, but about 80% are great"
nerdist,3cfi5g,requiem1394,6,Tue Jul 7 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"This was a really fun episode. Though, I will say, Chris harped a LITTLE too much on the ""Hey, speak French"", ""Hey, do Aladdin!"" ""Hey, do Aladdin doing French!"" type of thing. It stuck out to me because I remember the early episode with Alison Brie where Matt asked her to do Trudy and Annie and Chris was all ""She isn't your puppet!""  Still a great episode, though!"
nerdist,3cfi5g,progwrx,6,Tue Jul 7 21:07:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, but to be fair, these guys apparently knew/know each other very well since they were drinking buddies with Saget, so theres a higher level of familiarity there."
nerdist,3cfi5g,Valint,2,Tue Jul 7 21:12:00 2015 UTC,Blew my mind that he was Aladdin an DJs boyfriend. I'll have to check out some of the stuff he has written
nerdist,3cfi5g,Bslo18,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:25:05 2015 UTC,The fact he also dressed up as Aladdin in a full house episode was not lost on me either. (PS congrats /u/chrishardwick on episode 700!!)
nerdist,3cfi5g,racer951y,3,Wed Jul 8 13:10:24 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the Home Improvement episode where kids dressed as buzz and simba come trick or treating to the Taylor house.   Jonathan Taylor Thomas had a good line about giving the cute little lion more candy then the spaceman.
nerdist,3cfi5g,thewineburglar,2,Wed Jul 8 15:03:30 2015 UTC,I never noticed how much he sounds like Jonah until this episode.
nerdist,3cfi5g,Jo_MamaSo,2,Wed Jul 8 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"In the middle of this episode and paused to look up the Amiga commercial. The dad looks like Richard Jenkins (the dad from Six Feet Under, among many, many things), but I don't think it fits age-wise."
nerdist,3cfi5g,hadsterific,2,Sat Jul 11 09:23:46 2015 UTC,"This was actually delightful. It was so upbeat and positive and fun. Sometimes the eps get super serious, which I enjoy, but this was a welcome change. I really felt uplifted after this ep."
nerdist,3cfi5g,buttholemuffin,2,Fri Jul 17 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"Had no clue that was the dude who did Aladdins voice until this episode. Also pretty interesting that they don't sing their Disney songs, just talk."
nerdist,3cfi5g,buttholemuffin,3,Fri Jul 10 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"I think it varies from person to person actually. Depends on the sounds they're going for. Brad Kane, who did the singing voice, was actually cast for speaking and singing before Weinger.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)"
nerdist,3cfi5g,poser4life,0,Fri Jul 10 23:36:00 2015 UTC,Well shit! You Learn something new everyday and this is mine.

My wife and I had planned on going to SDCC but we weren't able to get in, but we landed tickets to this before Del Toro and Huddleston were even added!  FUCKING HYPE"
nerdist,3cc91n,buttholemuffin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:40:38 2015 UTC,Those are some damn fine line ups I'm sad to miss! I can't wait to hear these when they come out!!
nerdist,3cc91n,buttholemuffin,3,Mon Jul 6 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"I'm in Knoxville, TN. Nowhere close to SDCC. Maybe someday, but these will have to do for now!"
nerdist,3cc91n,buttholemuffin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:24:45 2015 UTC,I'm graced with the luck of the gods to be born and raised in San Diego. There's no way I could afford to go to SDCC without actually living here.
nerdist,3ccbn5,VainWyrm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:17:56 2015 UTC,Wiki page on this if anyone would like to read up on it.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_refractory_period
nerdist,3c8aya,corrosive_substrate,141,Sun Jul 5 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"Good ears! Truthfully, it's not about making the show sound ""funnier"" by trying to fake laughter like a laugh track in a sitcom. I believe what's happening here (full disclosure: I don't sit in on the edits, I'm usually doing an evening podcast) is that they're trying to cover larger edits to smooth them over. The show tapes at about 40 min but has to be cut down to 21, and they only have about 90 minutes to complete that before it has to be delivered for air. I will say, though, that if you attended a taping (and you should!) the show never feels like it has holes in it. It's pretty dang fun from start to finish. In fact, it's often kind of painful to lose stuff that we love but know we have to cut for time. It's why I love the fact that they release the extended episodes of the Thursday shows on cc.com and the app. Anyway, good catch! And I hope you all had a wonderful 4th!"
nerdist,3c8aya,ChrisHardwick,31,Sun Jul 5 22:44:45 2015 UTC,Tl;dr Good guy Hardwick goes the extra mile. Again.
nerdist,3c8aya,stinkpalm,9,Mon Jul 6 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"The clips from the one with Micucci, Koechner, and Sasso (arranged in ascending height and descending hair) were from the extended episode.  Don't worry though, I seem to be predisposed to hear this sort of thing, and I promise you that the vast majority of shows sweeten audience reactions at least a little bit.  From what I've been able to gather, part of that is because it costs a lot to properly mic an audience, and then you end up picking up a lot of chitter chatter during the program.  I mostly did this to infect everyone else with the ear worm <.<  Besides, I judge the quality of a show on my own laugh track, not someone else's.  @midnight is pretty consistent in cracking me.  The MyDick.property == Clown.property bit was one of my favorite TV moments in a while.  That and the Silicon Valley dick bit.  I'm sensing a trend here...."
nerdist,3c8aya,Count_Critic,5,Sun Jul 5 23:11:40 2015 UTC,It wasn't until I read the first reply comment that I looked at the username and realised who said this.
nerdist,3c8aya,Niflheim,3,Mon Jul 6 05:57:27 2015 UTC,Relatable Hardwick hits again!
nerdist,3c8aya,HapkidoJosh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"I had no idea.  It makes sense why the scores change throughout the show sometimes.  The other day I was like, ""wait you didn't give Margarette Cho that many points."""
nerdist,3c8aya,svenhoek86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"Chris, for the love of God man, you NEED to get them to release that extended episode of Harmon and Davis and Campbell. That is my favorite episode ever, and honestly one of the funniest 21 minutes of television I have ever seen.   My dick is like a clown in that it....I don't know man, something clever about cum and wanting to see the extended episode."
nerdist,3c8aya,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"The extended, uncensored episodes are great to watch (and especially appealing to the types of people who resonate with the podcast form)."
nerdist,3c8aya,Random_Tangent,9,Wed Jul 8 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of sweetening going on, but I imagine it's usually to cover edits between segments and the set-ups in between."
nerdist,3c8aya,fomoran,7,Sun Jul 5 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"I will not stand for this /u/ChrisHardwick, et al.!  I want to see heads lol.     Skimmed through 2 and a half episodes to make that, I'm sure I missed some ;)     Edit-that's-not-really-an-edit:  I'm just screwing with y'all-- I get it.  TV audiences expect laughter that is typically larger and more vigorous than a crowd of grins, semi-polite-claps, and chuckles provides.  And occasional edit continuity.     I'm still a big fan."
nerdist,3c8aya,VainWyrm,3,Sun Jul 5 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"I get it also, but on the bright side, they actually do this in front of a live audience. Granted it's a small audience, but an audience none the less! So I hope they do have some of them mixed in. I know many shows that had/have laugh tracks were just done in studios without live audiences."
nerdist,3c8aya,davect01,4,Sun Jul 5 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"I giggled when Greg Proops said something to the effect of that he was on another ""fake improv show."""
nerdist,3c8aya,actualelsewhere,5,Mon Jul 6 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"Not a lot of it, I don't think.  I'm pretty sure they got to know what type of games they would be tasked with each episode, which would consequently let them prepare a little bit (such as being able to come up with fake names and an intro for the news segment that Colin/Ryan did frequently.)"
nerdist,3c8aya,davect01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:23:14 2015 UTC,I really hope that he doesn't mean the original one stuff like Colin having to 'do a colin' and faint rather than finish a song/rhyming game has to be because the situations were sprung on them. The drew Carey one was a sad sorry shadow of the original
nerdist,3c8aya,CaptainUnderrated,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most of that stuff is organic.  Particularly judging from the outtakes (and occasionally ..in..takes) where you can clearly tell they couldn't think of anything.  I remember one from the US version where Drew Carey blanked out then just started dancing around singing to the standard hoedown tune, ""fuck me fuck me fuck me..."""
