nononono,3dzzgu,Codyx2,28,Tue Jul 21 09:46:08 2015 UTC,Serious question. If they were to have driven over this bridge faster without stopping would there be a chance of them making it across?
nononono,3dzzgu,SigmundFrog,41,Tue Jul 21 01:30:20 2015 UTC,On over weight permits for trucks it requires you to slow down to 5mph to cross bridges and culverts so you don't bounce on them. I would think if he went faster as soon as he bounced onto the bridge it would all start to collapse. That one is so long I don't think there's anyway he could've made that.

nononono,3dsp8i,Rusty5hackleford,4,Sun Jul 19 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"It is a law, whether or not people are arrested doesn't change that; it's not being pedantic to point out that something you said was completely wrong.  It's  definately related to why the airline wasn't responsible since he wasn't using the safety equipment that was both provided and legally required for him to use for this kind of accident.  You also argued that the kind of accident is very rare, as if that and other accidents being rare somehow cancels out the purpose of the seat belts or the order to wear them."
nononono,3dsp8i,EddieFrits,-7,Sun Jul 19 17:01:28 2015 UTC,I think whether or not anyone had ever been charged by a law for that reason is a perfectly viable example of it being a bullshit argument .

nononono,3dsp8i,Send_Lawyers,19,Sun Jul 19 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"This was a mix of fault between the pilots of the A380 for not keeping an eye on their wings as they were taxing, and atc for clearing then to taxi past the crj on the ramp.  I also like to use this to point out that no, turbulence will not make the jet fall apart in flight.  Relevant news article:  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jfk-runway-collision-whos-to-blame/"
nononono,3dsp8i,defectivetoaster,18,Sun Jul 19 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"It wasn't ATC's fault - the CRJ stopped where directed by the ramp workers, and didn't inform ATC. There's fault with the A380 crew (didn't see the CRJ), the CRJ crew (didn't inform ATC) and the ramp controller. The location where the CRJ stopped is not visible from the tower. ATC fault is either zero or very small in comparison to the other three parties.  Edit - also, it should be noted that the A380 crew can't directly see their wings (or basically anything behind the cockpit) when taxiing, and the vertical stabiliser camera view does not show the wingtips - it's wide enough to cover all the engines, but not much more than that. The investigation also showed that the CRJ was blocked by a cockpit window pillar for a significant period, almost immediately following which there was an instruction from ATC concerning an aircraft on their right, this directing attention away from the CRJ. That's not an excuse, but it certainly contributed to the accident."
nononono,3dsp8i,VMaxF1,9,Sun Jul 19 09:52:35 2015 UTC,"I do agree, that both crews are to shoulder the majority of the blame for this, however ATC will take some blame. Even though the A380 should have been more mindful of their wings (I know the feeling of not being able to see your wingtips from the cockpit) and Comair should have pulled up father or said something if they were unable to do so, ATC still issued the clearance. The A380 and other heavy jets are to be controlled delicately, and many airports are given special training and waivers to be able to accept such large aircraft. Had these been two smaller sized jets there would be no story, unfortunately the 380 does require special consideration by atc and even if they did not have direct visual contact they still have cameras and ASDE-X. I also belIeve of the FAA's love of spreading the blame around the controller will still get done measure of fault as well for not being aware of the potential hazard.   Great photos as well, and I was unable to see the ntsb report.... stupid phone."
nononono,3dsp8i,defectivetoaster,2,Sun Jul 19 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is that the point where Comair was instructed to stop by the ramp guys was intended only for outgoing traffic, not incoming - the report says:   According to air traffic control personnel, the diamond markings on the Delta parking ramp were meant to be hold points for departing airplanes taxiing out to taxiway Alpha, via taxiway Mike. They were not intended to be hold points for airplanes taxiing into the parking ramp after flight. In addition, the diamond markings are labeled ""Aircraft Start Up"" on Comair Jeppesen Plate 20-0C.   If ATC are working on that basis, it seems fair to expect a notification that an aircraft hasn't cleared the taxiway - stopping there is an unusual scenario. I don't know much about ASDE-X (read: basically anything apart from what it's for) - would that have shown sufficient detail (in this case the correctly scaled length/width of aircraft) to be relevant? If so, then I would definitely agree that ATC has to take a good chunk of blame."
nononono,3dsp8i,VMaxF1,4,Sun Jul 19 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"he biggest problem is that the point where Comair was instructed to stop by the ramp guys was intended only for outgoing traffic, not incoming   I am not familiar with the Delta ramp operations in JFK, but I can make an educated guess that their ramp personnel had parked incoming aircraft in this manner many times before this accident.  (Edit: I'm not saying this is okay, I'm assuming that ramp stopped them there with the incorrect assumption that there would be no issues)  As forASDE-X I know it to be accurate enough to detect aircraft out of position, but it operates off of aircraft transponders, meaning that all the ground controller will see on their screen are dots moving. This is where I believe the fault comes in, the ground controller should have seen the CRJ stopped short and known that the A380 would have clearance issues due to its wingspan.  That said, it really is unfortunate that ATC issued their clearances with the belief that ramp was doing their jobs properly."

I'd say on a busy street this is the most common way crosswalks work; pedestrians entering the crosswalk but giving a car that is going marginally too fast or is marginally too close to slow down comfortably the option of continuing or stopping. If the car goes through or slows down there are no bad feelings on either end. The only mistake here I see is that the motorcycle is traveling too close/not paying attention."

nononono,3dr0wf,ShadowyDragon,7,Sat Jul 18 19:42:46 2015 UTC,It is a crosswalk without signals. That kind of cross walk is designed for cars to slow down as people cross the road. Vehicles are supposed to yield to pedestrians.   It's pretty common everywhere but the states.
nononono,3dr0wf,bullfightr,24,Sat Jul 18 18:45:57 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? There are crosswalks without signals all over the states.  Do you think every intersection in the USA has a stop sign or traffic light? Not even close.

They are at a pedestrian crossing, after all.    It follows that drivers in the United States MUST stop when anyone is on the pedestrian crossing.  The burden is not on the pedestrians.    A) That driver was going too quickly for that road and B) the motorcyclist was similarly driving too quickly and not leaving enough space and therefor led to his probable and deserved hospitalization.  For more info: ""CA Vehicle Code 21950.  (a) The driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.  (b) This section does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of using due care for his or her safety. No pedestrian may suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard. No pedestrian may unnecessarily stop or delay traffic while in a marked or unmarked crosswalk.  (c) The driver of a vehicle approaching a pedestrian within any marked or unmarked crosswalk shall exercise all due care and shall reduce the speed of the vehicle or take any other action relating to the operation of the vehicle as necessary to safeguard the safety of the pedestrian.

nononono,3di87v,SuperGeometric,0,Fri Jul 17 13:58:36 2015 UTC,Well labor is very expensive.

The procedure differs from model to model depending on types of exits and seating arrangement.   One example is if you are next to a window.  If/when the helicopter flips over in water (it is top-heavy) wait for the thrashing to stop.  At this point you should still be buckled in,  upside down,  with water filling the cabin very fast.   Take a deep breath and wait for the cabin to fill up, water to fill your nostrils without panicking, and pressure equalize.  Grab the red tab on the rubber seal around the window by feel,  because you're underwater in a darkened cabin, pull the seal in one single arm motion,  place your elbow in the corner of the window and give it a quick jab,  the window should pop out.   The last part is very important,  because if you don't do it correctly,  you can get disoriented and not be able to exit.   Place one hand on your seat belt release and one hand firmly on the upper frame of the window you just opened.  Release the belt with one hand and pull yourself out of the window starting with the other hand that you have kept on the frame already.   Make sure to swim UP...  You was upside down,  remember?   Get clear of the wreck before inflating your life vest.   You should be able to do this with your eyes closed,  and I can,  but it still terrifies me every time.

nononono,3d442b,ninjate,160,Mon Jul 13 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"Imagine you've got an escalator. It's turned off, but it doesn't have brakes. As you start climbing this escalator, your weight causes the steps to start moving downward even as you climb. You're able to make some headway, but the faster you climb, the faster it goes down.  If you're not able to climb as fast as it's coming down, you'll end up back at the bottom.  (This is analogous to a condition called ""vortex ring state"", where it doesn't matter how much power you apply, the air around your rotors is descending too fast to get any lift. But I digress...)  Trying to pull straight up in a helicopter causes the air around it to move downward. Now, your rotor blades are trying to climb a descending column of air, just like trying to climb up that broken escalator.  Now, imagine that you've got a dozen sets of escalator steps, set side by side. Instead of trying to go straight up one escalator, climb  up them diagonally. You take two steps on the first escalator, it starts moving downward. But your third step is to the next escalator that isn't moving yet. You take two steps on that one, and move on to the third, then the fourth. You're always stepping onto a new, fresh, still escalator, so you can climb diagonally much faster than you can vertically.   Moving forward, your rotor blades are always moving away from the turbulent downwash and into clean, still air, just like stepping onto one of these escalators that hasn't yet been pushed into motion. This forward (or any other direction, really) lets you climb much more effectively than just trying to go straight up.  Edit: Wow, gilded and bestof'd. Thanks, folks!"

nononono,3d442b,jumpbreak5,2,Wed Jul 15 18:26:02 2015 UTC,"You're getting into the concept of ""ground effect"", where the air displaced in the process of creating lift can't get out of the way as fast as it could in free flight, so it builds up additional pressure below the airfoil, which translates to higher lift.   Ground effect functions with or without translational lift."

nononono,3d442b,jumpbreak5,2,Wed Jul 15 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"Imagine a torus (technical term for a donut) with the helicopter being in the center hole. The torus represents the airflow. The inside wall, closest to helicopter is moving downwards due to propwash. Which results in high pressure below the heli and low pressure above it.  The air now tries to restore equal pressure. Which means it is moving outwards below the heli. Then it is sucked up and inwards by the low pressure above the heli. The less room below the rotor, the higher is the possibility of that happening. Then you're on the moving escalator again. The faster you try to go, the faster it goes downwards.  This is called a vortex ring: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring_state  See the image of the comanche with a donut around it.  EDIT: Ground effect is basically a cushion of air under the vehicle. If it stays there, it's helpful. As soon as it starts moving away from under the vehicle, you're in a problem."

nononono,3d6g1p,theonlybluecow,3,Mon Jul 13 22:07:33 2015 UTC,And then they decided to stand in the road behind their cars as car number three comes down the hill. They're all ding dongs.
nononono,3d6g1p,Silverlight42,2,Tue Jul 14 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"911?  Seriously?  This is NOT an emergency.   Officer needs to head up the hill asap and stop traffic.  hopefully that's what he did right after the video ends.  I kinda find it funny cause we deal with worse conditions than that 6 months out of the year.... but again our road crews are equipped and are pretty good at making the roads safe, our drivers know how to drive in those conditions and we use winter tires ;) possible injuries are just gonna be minor bumps and whiplash at the worst.  maybe 911 in order to block the road or something"
nononono,3d6g1p,Silverlight42,3,Mon Jul 13 22:59:14 2015 UTC,I think he said call 911 because the driver was a retarded and tried to stop the car with his leg. He could have blown a knee or done damage to his leg.
nononono,3d6g1p,red_beanie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:02:03 2015 UTC,yeah.. I thought about that.  Coulda.  Not life threatening I don't think...  but yes that's likely the reason.  Doubt they got injured from it but yes they easily could have from that futile move ;)
nononono,3d6g1p,Silverlight42,2,Mon Jul 13 23:12:11 2015 UTC,i fully agree with this. The dude in the vest should have sprinted to the top of the road as soon as the van hit the car and they knew they had more cars possibly coming that didnt know about the ice. Plus it didnt help that he was freaking the fuck out. Calm in situations like this help more than hurt.
nononono,3d6g1p,terevos2,2,Mon Jul 13 23:38:59 2015 UTC,freaking the fuck out   Yep it's apparent his brain wasn't fully working when he let the van get that close without moving in a safe spot.   Glad he managed to dodge but too close for my comfort.

DAI is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury,  and is a major cause of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after head trauma.  It occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma.  The outcome is frequently coma, with over 90% of patients with severe DAI never regaining consciousness.  Those who do wake up often remain significantly impaired.   DAI can occur in every degree of severity from very mild or moderate to very severe.

nononono,3cgdec,red_beanie,56,Tue Jul 7 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"Any kind of deceleration reduces the traction on the back end. If your problem is the back end losing traction, maintaining throttle is the right thing to do. Wikipedia article on the effect. My Subaru with aftermarket suspension will lift-throttle oversteer readily and if I were to let off the gas in that situation I'd spin, but staying on the throttle keeps it nice and under control. Even a stock Subaru is generally more controllable on the throttle than off, though it definitely depends on the situation and the driver's ability to read the situation.  Most cars are set up from the factory with such heavy understeer bias that the front end loses traction before the rear (and in that case slight deceleration is the right thing to do because rear traction isn't your issue). And even for a rear biased car, most drivers don't have enough experience handling a loose rear end to be able to control it well, so they're screwed anyway and their best bet is to just slow down as much as they can.  TL;DR it's not that simple"
nononono,3cgdec,musubk,7,Tue Jul 7 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"interesting point on the back end lifting and losing traction with deceleration. Its a fine line whether to maintain and risk that your car will throttle out of control, or get sketchy when you hook up on the dry stuff vs letting your car slow down and possibly spin out at a lower speed. Logic tell me to go with the latter lower speed option."
nononono,3cgdec,red_beanie,11,Wed Jul 8 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I was hydroplaning on a straight flat highway I'd just let off the gas and coast to a slower speed.

nononono,3cgdec,Ghuurka,4,Wed Jul 8 10:11:40 2015 UTC,"Except that's not always true, especially on a FWD or AWD car. If you need to correct and want your car to go where you are steering it, you need to give it some power so your front wheels actually pull you towards that direction.   That said, the proper action in this situation would be to keep the throttle and steering exactly as they are until they reach dry pavement. Hydroplaning itself isn't going to spin your car out or roll it over, regaining traction once your car has pivoted from its original course is what does you in."
nononono,3cgdec,snnh,4,Wed Jul 8 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"""That said, the proper action in this situation would be to keep the throttle and steering exactly as they are until they reach dry pavement"". Uh what? Wouldn't letting off the throttle and keeping your steering exact till you reach dry pavement be the right move? At least you would start to eliminate the speed factor and you would also eliminate any traction shock when you hooked back up on the dry pavement, since you would just be rolling onto the dry stuff, not having spinning tired grabbing it all the sudden. What is your reasoning for saying to maintain throttle till dry pavement?"
nononono,3cgdec,red_beanie,8,Wed Jul 8 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"You don't want to hit dry pavement with your tires moving any differently from the trajectory of your car-- slower, faster, or turned in a different direction. Because of a number of factors it is impossible to match this perfectly, but I would rather hit dry pavement with my wheels turning faster than they ""should"" be rather than slower.   Your front tires are likely to regain grip first, and if they act to accelerate the car the moment they get traction, this should pull the back of the car along in a line with the front of the car. They should also subtly shift the weight of the car backwards, helping to even out the traction available to the front/rear wheels and get everything back to normal faster. On the other hand if they are going too slow they will act to decelerate the car. The rear of the car will already be lacking in traction, and the deceleration will drive weight distribution further forward. This can cause the rear to ""catch up"" with the front of the car by pivoting around resulting in a spin, rollover, or other unpleasant outcome.   It seems counterintuitive because if you are going to get in an accident you'd rather be going slower. But cars are generally more stable under acceleration than braking or other, gradual deceleration (letting off of the throttle). And if losing or keeping control of the car happens in a split second, you definitely want to be on the throttle... The brakes won't slow you down enough to affect the impending accident much in that time period anyways."
nononono,3cgdec,snnh,4,Wed Jul 8 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"Re-reading your post I realized this might be a point of confusion... Letting off of the throttle seems like it should let the tires continue to turn at the same speed. When you have the inertia of the whole car keeping your tires/drivetrain/engine rotating, it may seem like getting off the throttle lets you glide. But it will actually cause your tires to slow down, due to the effects of friction and engine braking. Eventually, letting off the throttle will make your whole car slow down as well in normal conditions, but inertia lessens this effect so you may not realize that letting off the throttle is just like putting on the brakes (gently)"
nononono,3cgdec,snnh,3,Wed Jul 8 00:37:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough answer. I understand your point of view now.
nononono,3cgdec,red_beanie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:41:59 2015 UTC,Don't forget the inertia of the car only keeps the tires rotating like normal when they have traction.  They will slow way down in a hydroplane situation.  The other guy is right.

nononono,3cgdec,RumorsOFsurF,4,Wed Jul 8 04:55:10 2015 UTC,Wrong. Off throttle causes liftoff oversteer.  Correct answer is to be on throttle and to countersteer.
nononono,3cgdec,harribert,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:09:49 2015 UTC,"The liftoff oversteer and countersteering happens after the hydroplaning event is over.   The effect is amplified when there is little traction, and this technique applies either way. You are arguing the difference between low traction to even less traction.   No throttle while countersteering will merely slow down the spin; applying throttle will help bring it back around. Obviously overcorrecting and hammering it on the gas will create a pendulum effect and cause the vehicle to slide on the other side.   My experience comes from owning several high powered cars and living in a very rainy place. Tell me how you keep a 300 hp, 3000 lbs RWD car in a straight line at 70 in heavy rain when the rear end starts wiggling on you and you have no ESP?"

nononono,3cgdec,D8300,20,Wed Jul 8 09:02:45 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. Ultimately, it depends on what the manufacturer wants to call it, but generally speaking:  AWD has three differentials, one on each axle and one between the front and rear driveshafts. This allows the front and rear drive shafts to turn slightly different amounts, which will happen in tight turns. AWD provides better traction on hard, flat surfaces.  4WD has two differentials, one on each axle, but the front and rear driveshafts are locked together. This provides better traction on loose surfaces and rough terrain.   Full-time 4WD does have a center differential like AWD for hard surfaces, but that differential can be locked to provide part-time 4WD.   AWD typically relies heavily on some form of electronic traction control to operate properly. 4WD may have traction control, but is not nearly as reliant on it due to the design of the drive train. AWD will provide a better ride, 4WD will provide better off-road traction."

nononono,3cgdec,cajunFAITH,3,Wed Jul 8 07:39:03 2015 UTC,Nope. Maybe the front end skips around because front and rear are locked and your front LSD kicks in. But the DCCD setting should not affect the other two diffs directly.
nononono,3cgdec,Phrewfuf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:05:09 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense.  I guess I need to read up a bit more how it all works exactly
nononono,3cgdec,cajunFAITH,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:19:44 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this image. Notice how the red tracks are shorter than the green tracks?  This is why you need some sort of center differential: the front axle moves slightly farther than the rear axle in turns. Shifting to part-time 4WD locks the center diff, which means that at least one wheel needs to slip in tight turns to stop the driveline from binding.   If you have universal joints up front instead of CV joints, there's another issue. CV, or ""constant velocity"" joints are so named because the rotational speed of the input shaft is always equal to the rotational speed of the output shaft. This is only true of universal joints when the joint is straight. With a flexed joint, the input and output rotation will average out to be the same, but the instantaneous difference can be very, very different.  Take a look at this chart. With a universal joint flexed 60 degrees, there is a point in its rotation where the output shaft is twice the speed of the input shaft, and there is another point in its rotation where the output shaft is half the speed of the input shaft.  What this means is that in very tight turns, your tires are going to move at different speeds than the driveshaft throughout their rotation. Without a center diff to transfer the excess motion back to the rear tires, tight turns with U-joints and 4WD will make it feel like the front end is lurching around. A locked front diff would exacerbate this issue, but you'll feel it even with an open diff."

nononono,3cgdec,StopTalkingOK,18,Tue Jul 7 22:11:21 2015 UTC,AWD doesn't equally distribute power to all wheels like 4WD does. AWD often shifts power to the wheels with the most traction.

nononono,3cgdec,tcpip4lyfe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"That's incorrect. AWD with open diffs can't shift power to wheels with high traction.  AWD with Viscous/Limited Slip Diffs will ""lock"" the diff whenever the difference in rotation of the two ouput shafts would be too high.  Some of the modern AWD systems (for example Subaru with VDC) use eletronic means (ABS sensors) and brakes to control power distribution. They detect when a wheel is rotating faster than the others and apply brakes to said wheel in the assumption that it lost traction. The power gets redirected to the other wheels, resulting in acceleration of the vehicle."
nononono,3cgdec,Phrewfuf,-2,Wed Jul 8 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"There isn't ""technically"" a difference.  4WD and AWD both refer to any system that provides power to all 4 wheels of a vehicle.  It is up to the manufacturer to decide which term they apply to their vehicles.  TYPICALLY, AWD is full-time because it lets all wheels rotate at independent speeds which is needed when turning around corners when you have perfect traction such as on pavement.  TYPICALLY, 4WD does not let all wheels turn independently. This is better when you have very poor traction because one wheel losing traction should not rob the other wheels of power. It's also potentially cheaper.  But ""AWD"" and ""4WD"" mean whatever the car company wants them to. There are no laws about what can be advertised as AWD vs 4WD."
nononono,3cgdec,snnh,3,Wed Jul 8 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"Unlike pretty much every other AWD or 4WD system in a crossover or SUV, Subarus drive all four wheels all the time, constantly re-apportioning torque as appropriate. Other vehicles have to wait until the driven axle loses traction before trying to fix that by sending drive elsewhere. Those systems are band-aids; Subaru’s is a performance enhancer."
nononono,3cgdec,kaydpea,9,Wed Jul 8 09:10:11 2015 UTC,"True. But so does quattro, or vw's 4 motion, or some x-drives etc. And each model vehicle still has different abilities. You can't use a blanket statement like that.  The sti's have an electric center diff so you can control how much power is sent to the rear wheels to a final ratio of 60-40 (60% rear - 40% front) if i believe right. But the wrx doesn't have that control.  The old subarus even had a high and low transfer case.   Even the forester is still front wheel biased, it can't send 100% power to one wheel, or even 50%.   There are auto 4wd systems as well which are mechanically  4 wheel drive, but only activate the center diff to send power to the front wheels when it detects slipping.   although when it comes to subarus, if it can clear it it will go through it."
nononono,3cgdec,mr_mooses,5,Wed Jul 8 00:17:32 2015 UTC,Most Subaru's have a viscous coupling center differential which can force up to 25% of the torque to the front or rear axle.   Source? I fix rally cars and have thrown many of these differentials away in favor of electronic or clutch based units.

The subaru is by far the best of both worlds in a daily driver.  I live in Canada and we get shit tonne of snow every winter.  My Rogue has on demand awd, which basically only provides power to the rear wheels when the fronts slip.  The impreza(especially with snow tires) is a beast that just plows through everything.  I can't make the thing break traction no matter how much I try in the dry.  It is a superior machine and unlike 4wd, the drive line never binds.  I love it, sooo much grip."

nononono,3cgdec,MyArgumentsAreShit,6,Tue Jul 7 23:30:14 2015 UTC,"Well the actual hydroplaning ended after about a second after hitting that puddle, and the rest was just sliding.  Hydroplaning is when the tire is lifted completely out of contact with the road surface by the water, resulting in absolutely zero meaningful control.  It can also turn you because not all four wheels make contact with the ground again at the same time.  This means that you are pretty much at the puddle's mercy based off of how you entered it.  This guy should have seen that giant puddle from a quarter mile back and slowed way down, like down to 30 mph to be safe."

nononono,3cgdec,mr_mooses,25,Tue Jul 7 20:31:12 2015 UTC,He probably let off the gas and suffered from liftoff-oversteer by shifting the weight of the car forwards moving the weight towards the front of the car on the front wheels making the back go light and sliding out from behind him. That combined with going too fast and probably hydroplaning caused him to lose control. He probably would've been better off with his foot on the gas and powering out. Or just drive slower in slippery conditions.
nononono,3cgdec,TheFifthCan,37,Wed Jul 8 03:05:22 2015 UTC,Just drive slower in slippery conditions.   Let's just go with this one.
nononono,3cgdec,SpanningTreeProtocol,6,Wed Jul 8 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"He might not have realized that was as deep of a puddle as it was. It doesn't look like he was going that much faster than the other cars in the video anyways.  Wether or not he lifted off when he hits the puddle the car is going to  suddenly decelerate causing the same weight transfer. If he had planted it and tried to maintain speed I'm betting he would have overloaded the tires and started to hydroplane quicker and have the same result of losing traction and control. But I don't know for sure.   That black car he hit though... never noticed the car swinging into him from the side, never sped up or hit the brakes once until he was hit, and looks like he swerves into the subie at the very end..  It would be interesting to know for sure though."
nononono,3cgdec,zomglolness,2,Wed Jul 8 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"That's all very true. After seeing the gif on my laptop at proper speed and not slo-mo from mobile it seems like the water definitely caused the deceleration that would've caused that to happen.

I think it's going about half as fast again when it first comes into the shot. And it's doing it in the right lane, not the left lane."
nononono,3cgdec,TheFifthCan,9,Tue Jul 7 20:42:55 2015 UTC,Or just drive slower in slippery conditions.   Saved the best advice for last.
nononono,3cgdec,habloconleche,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:10 2015 UTC,He's not getting lift off oversteer.  He's not even close to the edge. He just hydroplaned on shit tires.
nononono,3cgdec,Random_Link_Roulette,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:03:34 2015 UTC,You don't need to be close to the edge to suffer from oversteer. It depends on the the slip angle of the tire which in turn depends on friction between the tire and the road. With low a low coefficient of friction due to the slippery roads and the reduction in speed when hitting the water took weight off the rear wheels and basically allowed the tires to come out from behind.  Combine that with hydroplaning just makes it worse cuz now there's less weight on those rear wheels to push down and gain traction and easier for the water to lift the car and spin it round. Crappy tires could also very well play in the role but there's no way to tell that from the video.

In other words, not all parts of the image of the scene are recorded at exactly the same instant. (Though, during playback, the entire image of the scene is displayed at once, as if it represents a single instant in time.) This produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or rapid flashes of light. This is in contrast with ""global shutter"" in which the entire frame is captured at the same instant.

After Earnhardt's death,  Richard Childress (the team owner) continued to lease the number 3 and just didn't put it on any cars in the Cup series. He decided to bring it back. The number is as much Richard Childress' as it is Earnhardt's as it is NASCAR's."

In any case I mean no disrespect to the drivers, it obviously takes skill and strength, both physical and psychical. As a spectator sport, seems all the more like the danger of accident is what it's all about though. I'd compare it to watching 30 people jumping over fire for 5 hours straight. You would have hard time convincing me people are watching it for the jumping technique..."
nononono,3ccsyq,embair,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:54:22 2015 UTC,"They were bunched up because of a caution that caused a GWC restart. If nothing happened just a few laps before (a car trying to become a BMX Bike), it would be a line of cars passing the finish line. The only reason they're in a pack like that is because of the restrictor plates involved to keep the cars at a slower pace. Without them, they'd go 230+ mph and the crashes could be 100 times worse. With these plates, you get the chance to have anyone running at the end able to win. That's why it's said ""if you have an engine and you're running strong at the end, you have a good chance of winning,"" regardless if your team if funded or not.   Most, if not all watch it because they've picked a favorite driver (most likely Dale Earnhardt Junior who won the race in the gif) and they cheer for that said driver for about 36 weeks in a year. From Daytona in February to Homestead in November. Also, it takes being at the track to really enjoy it. The atmosphere is very different than being at home just because you're live there and the different personalities you meet. You could say that it's really hard to watch on the TV F1 because most likely, you're going to see the same 2 people running for the win. At least in NASCAR in any given week, you could see at least four (as it's going this year with the terrible aero package) race for a victory."

It gave partially, spreading the impact over time, while still stopping it from going into the stands - bouncing it back into the track for an even longer wreck. This is a demonstration of how excellent those fences really are.   The big, dramatic wrecks with the car traveling a quarter-mile and flipping 20 times are actually the less-dangerous wrecks. Dale Sr died at Daytona (amongst other reasons) because his car stopped instantly. All that flying, sliding, spinning, and flipping is using up the energy in the crash and keeping the impact force and max-G low enough to survive so long as the driver is properly strapped in."

nononono,3c4vi5,kehlder,5,Sun Jul 5 14:21:13 2015 UTC,Definitely didn't peel his face off.   You have no idea what happened to his eyes. Stop describing an act of escalation against unarmed protesters with results that can maim and can kill as acceptable.

I have seen elderly people permanently blinded by such jets, so the possibility of employing a weapon which can do this is it. It doesn't matter what happened to the guy, the point is that somebody ordered the use of a weapon against unarmed demonstrants that can cripple permanently.   In my opinion, such people need to be made fully responsible to the letter of the law. If the political system is too corrupt to meter out such justice, these people need to be lynched or ordered a hit on.  This is the danger of ordering such means: you might intimidate, but you might also lose the last shred of legitimacy. And a population that no longer believes in the law is very dangerous indeed."

And plenty of people have made real change happen with nonviolence like Ghandi or MLK. I think that we should always try to be kind to others, even if they hurt us, because that is what seperates us from animals.

nononono,3c53w0,captain_cornflakes,9,Thu Jul 9 22:08:37 2015 UTC,The entry was pretty good - doesn't look like driver error?
nononono,3c53w0,thescimitar,29,Sat Jul 4 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like driver error to me, he hit the wall because he corrected to the right when he didn't need to. With how the car was approaching the turn, it looks like he misjudged how much the rear was rotating coming into that turn and then ended up chucking it into the wall instead of catching the car. You can see the rear end is stepping out right before that jink to the right just before it goes off line. That [jink]'s a steering input, not a loss of grip."
nononono,3c53w0,secretchimp,7,Sun Jul 5 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suspect you're right but each time I watch it, I don't understand what caused the driver's reaction, especially looking at the previous turn. Really strange."
nononono,3c53w0,thescimitar,5,Sun Jul 5 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"It's really easy to get that turn wrong with too much speed, the preceding 2 or 3 turns are higher speed and can be attacked quite hard with a lot of throttle, but this one easily catches out the driver being too aggressive. The magnitude of his correction was exaggerated because he did it at the moment the suspension was most compressed and the car bounced up and understeered after that point."

nononono,3c53w0,thescimitar,7,Sun Jul 5 13:57:16 2015 UTC,I agree with Secretchimp. when the car came around the corner it started to slide just a tiny bit and the driver over-countersteered and went into the wall.
nononono,3c53w0,Mr_Czarcasm,4,Sun Jul 5 01:16:47 2015 UTC,Not to mention he locked up the brakes absolving all steering capability. Not saying I wouldn't have make the same mistake but that was a rather inexperienced mistake.

nononono,3c53w0,superatheist95,-6,Sun Jul 5 06:49:27 2015 UTC,The RWD in the Mercedes is what did it. He accelerates coming out of the first turn and it started to come round. Over corrected and it was all over from there.

nononono,3c53w0,DuckTruckMuck,3,Sun Jul 5 07:08:14 2015 UTC,the oversteer of RWD cars is a feature not a problem
nononono,3c53w0,reubenbubu,-3,Sun Jul 5 07:42:19 2015 UTC,Yeah but if it goes around on you without expecting it you would compensate with oversteer. Seems like that's what happened here
nononono,3c53w0,DuckTruckMuck,6,Sun Jul 5 07:44:26 2015 UTC,"the correction wasnt needed from what im seeing. seems like he was headed to do that turn on the curb, which is fine. also.... its always up to the driver to stay within the limits of the car. you can never blame it on the car itself."
nononono,3c53w0,reubenbubu,0,Sun Jul 5 07:56:06 2015 UTC,Agreed! The driver didn't compensate FOR the RWD IN the Mercedes. Not sure how that isn't coming across here. I didn't realize we were placing blame on people/things.

Also, it may not look dramatic without any flipping over and stuff flying off and whatnot, but IMO that's a pretty bad crash. The angle the driver hit it at is as bad as I can imagine without it being fully head on. I wonder if he was even conscious after the impact because the car just keeps going."
nononono,3c53w0,decker12,4,Sun Jul 5 08:56:40 2015 UTC,I can confirm. I crashed my first car in this exact turn and I had to pay about 2800€ to repair the armco.  My car  Video

I have to infer what goal they are firing at, because goodness knows they aren't marked and the goalie is wearing a yellow outfit, most unhelpfully quite different from either team on the field.

To answer your question though, she was trying to kick the ball out of bounds to stop Japan (in blue) from having the opportunity to score. Unfortunately she didn't get it quite high enough to go over the goal, and accidentally nailed a shot that was extremely difficult for her goalie to block. She did what any player should do, but unfortunately messed up the execution. She wasn't confused by any means.

nononono,3bulvd,Mr_Popper,6,Thu Jul 2 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"Soccer goalies generally wear different colors so that they are distinguished from the rest of the team when play gets close to the goal.  As for the goals being unmarked, welcome to sports, I guess?  I think who you're calling the ""first girl"" is the actual own goal scorer, she was trying to get it away from the Japanese player. The second English player who runs in is just trying to get it out away from the goal but she gets there too late.  And for identifying the teams themselves, boy, I guess you're just shit out of luck. Maybe they weren't broadcasting with the intent of a five-second gif being the ultimate product. What a bunch of idiots, right?  Source: I'm American and don't watch soccer, I am just capable of using context clues"
nononono,3bulvd,HMJ87,4,Thu Jul 2 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"Japanese player (in blue) crossed the ball hoping to have her team mates connect with the cross and score in the English goal (England goalie in yellow top). English defender (white top) tries a desperate defence be stretching to get the ball in an attempt to knock it out of play and force a corner kick. Unfortunately she can't quite reach the ball enough to get full contact on it so she gets just enough contact to lob the goalie and score an own goal.    Not the defender's fault, she did the only thing she could, and either way it would have very likely been a goal anyway had she not got to it, as there were 2 Japanese players waiting to receive the ball for a relatively easy tap-in."
nononono,3bulvd,HMJ87,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, they'd have to kick the ball from the corner closest to where the ball went out of play. In this case had all gone well the Japanese team would have to play from the corner to the right of the English goal.    Not a problem at all, happy to help!

Turn harder and either you lose lateral traction and fall lowside which is the same amount of bad, or you keep traction and you manage to make the turn!   Problem is he didn't try and turn. Motorcyclists know that you need to turn your head to turn the bike - there's a shockingly potent connection between just looking somewhere and going there. You can see he just keeps looking directly at the truck (probably because it's big and scary - target fixation), and that prevents him from making the manoeuvre that would get him out of it."

If you count light poles traveled, both our car and the oncoming truck, they are not traveling that fast.....that being said STOP!!!!(if you think that either of them are going more than 30mph...I humbly suggest you are wrong) you didnt even need to swerve just stop, even if the car kept going it would have cut the crash speed in half or dare i say avoided the collision.  To suggest in any situation that a head on collision is preferable....  really though did you think about that statement.  A. think of particularly how THESE two vehicle could have collided, any other way would have been preferable  B. so the truck ""swerves"" to the side of the road(not to the oncoming traffic once again head on) to my point hes going slow, who cares take out a light pole or two, he'll be fine  C. the little car's driver as you so suggest will be introduced to his own engine quite up close and personally"

Yes it is - do you know of a less-bad one?  If collision in unavoidable head on absorbs the most energy and has the most protection and restraint in place. We've seen people die in offset and sideways collisions where they were ejected from their seatbelts or their head struck something hard out the side window. DOA.

nononono,3bpeer,Nowin,19,Wed Jul 1 09:18:51 2015 UTC,Shouldn't remaining in control be possible here? What would be the best course of action if this were to happen to me while driving? Thanks
nononono,3bpeer,Vynjak,50,Wed Jul 1 16:23:14 2015 UTC,Yes control can still be maintained with the proper reaction. When it blows take your foot off the gas and control any swerving before hitting the brakes. Panic braking while not under control will result in less control like in the video and possibly spinning out or rolling the vehicle. I cant say for sure but im guessing the driver panicked and hit the brakes as soon as she felt/heard the tire go.
nononono,3bpeer,Kspron,21,Wed Jul 1 16:38:23 2015 UTC,The same goes for hydroplaning. Immediately smashing the brakes if far worse then maintaining your direction and letting off the throttle.
nononono,3bpeer,NoShftShck16,13,Wed Jul 1 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Also remember, when driving a manual, hit that clutch. It balances the car, ensuring all tires get as much friction as they can."

nononono,3bpeer,Rec1umWrecker,3,Wed Jul 1 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"Right, but specifically for a manual you want to depress the clutch otherwise you still have forces acting on the drive wheels."

nononono,3bpeer,Rec1umWrecker,2,Thu Jul 2 00:23:15 2015 UTC,Not entirely correct. There are situations where rapidly letting go of gas is the worst thing to do. Or may be the reason why you lost control of the car in the first place.
nononono,3bpeer,Phrewfuf,9,Thu Jul 2 08:40:19 2015 UTC,"FYI, it's recommended to keep your foot on the gas, or even press the pedal a bit more after a blowout in order to overcome the additional force pulling you to the side. You should not begin to let off the gas until you have corrected and can maintain the heading of the vehicle. At that point, slowly take your foot off and coast to a stop without using the brakes.     The driver should step on the accelerator for an instant to preserve vehicle momentum (or at least maintain constant accelerator pedal pressure), and offset the pulling caused by the blown tire by gently counter steering to keep the vehicle in its lane. Once the vehicle has stabilized, the driver can gently slow down and begin to carefully pull over to the side of the road.     Also     Keep pressure on the accelerator -- or maybe even step on it a bit -- so your vehicle maintains its forward momentum.     https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=13 http://www.ntb.com/tires/Tire-Blowout-Education.j http://tires.about.com/od/Tire_Safety_Maintenance/a/How-To-Drive-Through-A-Tire-Blowout.htm http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a9354/what-to-do-when-your-car-gets-a-blowout-15851782/ https://paaco.com/how-to-keep-control-of-your-vehicle-if-you-have-a-blowout-while-driving/8915/"

The loud whacking sound of rubber hitting the wheel well was the most alarming part.
nononono,3bpeer,somajones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Control any swerving   Which if you're going highway speeds means turn into the slide. But if the road is dry and you don't panic you shouldn't slide.

nononono,3bpeer,HEROnymousBot,33,Wed Jul 1 11:06:20 2015 UTC,Aren't most blowouts caused by structural problems with the tire over time? It's not usually a sudden nail or sharp object that causes the issues is it?
nononono,3bpeer,Negrodamuswuzhere,18,Wed Jul 1 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Correct, if it's a nail or even something larger such as a decent sized sliver of metal puncturing the tread, or contact patch of the tire it shouldn't cause a blow out. The sidewall is considerably more fragile so if something punctures the sidewall that does impact the tires strength significantly. But usually blowouts are caused by defects in the tires sidewall. One sure fire sign of a tire that has been damaged is bubbles in the sidewall, if you see that in your tire...get new tires quick, that bubble will only grow until it pops(blowout)"

You are over thinking it way, way to much.   I am however against the idiocy that women try to use being a girl to get out of shit, thats not part of equal treatment, thats trying to get treated better than men. I am also against idiots who think all white men should die solely because they were born white and male and for no other reason.   Plent of men have punchable faces too did ya know?

Its NOT because they are women, like I said its their faces, a guy has punchable faces too... it just happened that these 2 are women. What you are saying by accusing me of hating women is that if I do not like something, and something happens to be part of a women I automatically hate women.   Just curious, if I have a problem with women why is 90% of my music collection based on female vocalist? Why is Paramore and VersaEmerge my favorite bands? I do not have a problem with women like I said, I have a problem with idiocy, white, black, brown, gay, straight, trans, women or man... if you are an idiot I dislike you. That bar for being an idiot though is pretty fucking high up there.   Go back to SRS, complain some more because you are a fucking idiot for assuming I hate womem based on 2 subs which one does not have an outright thing to do with women, it has to do with making fun of 20 year olds who believe they are fucking fairies and werewolves... people who think white males are literally shit and want to kill all whites both male and female because some perceived ""privilege"".

Now that I have much more experience driving on gravel (and in general), I know that if you feel yourself losing control, take your feet away from the pedals and try not to move the steering wheel if you are at an otherwise relatively stable heading."

You can feel the tires lose grip and the engine rev up/tires slip slightly which would indicate you need to stop doing whatever you are doing or else you will crash.  Just let off the gas and let the water slow you down. If anything you will glide over the puddle safely and be just fine after. NEVER FREAK OUT. The only thing you gain from freaking out is a worse outcome due to poor decisions made too quickly.

A southbound train failed to stop at the Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at the end of the tunnel. Forty-three people died as a result of the crash, the greatest loss of life during peacetime in the London Underground,  and a further seventy-four were injured. With no fault being found with the train equipment, the Department of the Environment report found that the driver had failed to slow the train and stop at the station and there was insufficient evidence to determine the cause.
