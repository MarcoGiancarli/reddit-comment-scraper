Some of the changes in the 1st episode had me worried about the direction it was heading, but they've been changing just enough to keep it still like the manga and yet feeling new at the same time. All the events with Raye Penber unfolded quite differently and has made it rather enjoyable to watch. I'd recommend it so far, though it has only been 3 episodes so hopefully it will continue to be good."

Plus, some people can't do subbed, maybe they can't read fast enough and also take in the action on screen. Yes, subbed is better in almost every case, but that doesn't mean watching something dubbed is just horrible."

deathnote,3dwvww,ankitagrawal619,2,Mon Jul 20 05:11:14 2015 UTC,No clue. Probably was confident she would have no way to kill him if he stripped her. To try and get her to be more co-operative he took off his helmet then died because of it. Only thing I can assume.
deathnote,3dwvww,chipperz2,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:39 2015 UTC,So we can say Near and Mello were no match for Light. they got lucky?
deathnote,3dwvww,chipperz2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:17:52 2015 UTC,Well Near was just guessed and got it right mainly. Mello's plan on the other hand works even if he died. It shows that the notebook Mikami had was fake and the real was in the bank. As much as I want to believe Light was unstoppable. He was going to lose. Really wanted to see the new world he dreamt of.
deathnote,3dwvww,TransgenderPride,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, Near guessed, acted stupid, got lucky with his guess (about 10x), got lucky with his stupidity, and then won.  We can argue all day over how legit Near's guesses were up till Episode 36/37, but then they're clearly BS.  Let's assume Near guessed everything up till this point. Let's not worry about how he did it, maybe he got lucky, maybe he had more info that we the viewer didn't see, but just assume he did.  Therefore, he knows Mikami is X-Kira, Light is L-Kira, Mikami has a notebook, Light likely has pieces of a notebook, and he knows that Light has guessed that he's found out about Mikami.  So he does his whole make-a-fake thing, plants it with Mikami, then breaks into the bank and makes another fake. Plan set.  But it's a stupid plan. Near STAKES HIS LIFE on the fact that Mikami would come back in after writing the names. Why would he do this??? Near knows that Light has figured out most of his plan. He HAS to know that there's extra pieces of the notebook scattered around. There is NO REASON for Near to assume that Mikami will even have the notebook with him. Mikami could easily look in, snap a picture with his phone, then take off.  What now? Are you telling me Near hadn't thought of this very obvious possibility?  Also, what if Mikami had just brought a gun and come in blazing? What if he brought backup? NO WAY COULD NEAR NOT THINK OF THIS.  tl;dr- Near's guesses are just lazy writing."
deathnote,3dwvww,chipperz2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:45 2015 UTC,The Mikami gun blazing I doubt would have happened as it meant he would have to shoot everyone in the room without being shot himself. He has a notebook which kills people and he doesn't even need to be there to kill them. The safest option. But yea bs guessing from Near but he was right in the end :/
deathnote,3dwvww,bull-et,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"Well in the end, had Takada not been able to kill Mello, she wouldn't have been able to call Light, and remember that she has to contact Mikami, and start killing people.  And had Mikami not gotten this info, he never would've gone to the bank, and kill Takada, therefore not revealing the location of the notebook to Near and his team.  /e I mean she would've been able to call Light, but we do not know it Light had just killed her there, or if he'd still have ordered her to contact Mikami, potentially revealing her peace of the notebook to Mello"

deathnote,3dipsq,Tauriel11,12,Thu Jul 16 16:48:12 2015 UTC,I dunno about anyone else but I personally didn't have any predictions. Mostly I was just fascinated and horrified.
deathnote,3dipsq,Pwntagonist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:27:45 2015 UTC,Hard to have many predictions even 3 episodes in since they just introduced L in episode 2 and then Light starts getting followed by Raye Penber in episode 3. Other than killing criminals the worst thing Light had done so far was probably writing Lind L. Tailor's name. It wasn't until he dealt with the FBI agents that I started thinking of him as becoming a real monster that would probably end up dying because of his actions.
deathnote,3dipsq,ArtimusClydeFrog,4,Sun Jul 19 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was in the first few episodes, but I was positive that Light was going to end up making the eye deal by the end of the series."

deathnote,3dipsq,mrtrollstein,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any predictions, so much as I had weird assumptions about 3 of the characters prior to actually watching.  I had guessed that the show was about people that died from the name (I was right on that one, but this was pretty obvious).   I thought that Ryuk was a demon that went around killing people (turns out he was a comic relief character).  I had also mixed up L's and Light's character descriptions.  I thought the disheveled insomniac with the baggy clothing was the high school student named Light, and his appearance was due to him slowly going insane from being forced to order Ryuk around to kill people.  Meanwhile, I thought the smug guy in the suit holding an apple was the great detective."

Not necessarily that she is still alive (that might have been cheesy, but still mind blowing), but somewhere between her walking away and dying, she did something that would fuck up Light HARD way in the future.    I also thought the significance of L's name would later be revealed to have some weird connection to Light. Light and L both beginning with L surely wasn't a coincidence. Maybe that would be cheesy too, but eh. That's why I'm not a writer.    Also, I thought Light would die and become a Shinigami at the end of the show. I guess I was close enough of that one (although even a dumbass inbred would be able to figure out in the first episode that he would die eventually)."

We had him lock down region, student, family, with Light being the only suspect. They had Light corresponding with Misa, who's traces were found on the fake Kira's tapes. They still didnt buy into L's suspicions. Fuck those guys, they were the most incompetent detectives in the whole world. They only used wiretaps when Light was meeting with Kiyomi. That's a long pause... Sheesh, these guys were the dumbest of the dumb, and no wonder Near took advantage of them when he did."

deathnote,3d2v3c,SsurebreC,4,Mon Jul 13 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"When the show started, I was more on the neutral side than anything else, maybe leaning toward Light. I liked Light's personality and way of thinking, but something about L was just...funny and he made me laugh more than I probably should have. Up until the last episode, the only thing I didn't like was the Amnesia Arc (it was a little too slow for me). However, after L died, I was a Light/Kira Supporter.   The last episode was terrible. Fuck that little shit Near. He makes all of his judgments based off of guesses, not logically thought out conclusions.   I feel that the writers should have replaced Near with another character who had a Shinigami as well. I wanted a Death Note vs Death Note struggle between Light and the figures of authority."
deathnote,3d2v3c,cuberoot328509,3,Mon Jul 13 17:33:07 2015 UTC,That would have been amazing and you're right - lots of stuff Near pulled had no relation to reality. This is unlike L who explained everything. Perhaps it was rushed somehow - to wrap it up?  A Death Note vs. Death Note would have been interesting!

He saw Nate River's name with the other SPK members (his name started with N, so the logical assumption would be that was Near. No genius level intellect needed to deduce that.)    I really like the Mello/Near parts, and rewatching it confirms it. I liked the global scale of events Kira was using. I like that Light was a complete sociopath the whole way through."

I also believe he was going to kill everyone else that knew of him and the death note if he walked out of there alive.   Just to note though: When a shinigami dies for a human, that human gets their remaining lifespan. They say this in the anime. So even though Misa halved her life twice for the eye deal, her life also had a shinigami lifespan added twice, so I don't believe she was in danger of dying anytime soon."

But you can't really argue whether it's realistic or not when dealing with the supernatural. That's the story they told and it's much more believable than some other aspects of the plot (ex: an American agency perfectly replicating a Japanese man's handwriting, the book he wrote it in, and doing all of it overnight.)"

deathnote,3cvo70,assbee,10,Sat Jul 11 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"Well, since they didn't show it directly, they want us to fill in a blank.  I'm going to go with the idea that she killed herself, based on two things.  Firstly, she was deeply in love with Light, so his death could be enough for her to kill herself over.  She did say that she couldn't live in a world without Light yes that would be dark I'mSorryICouldn'tResist .  Secondly, her lifespan was under a lot of changes so it is entirely possible her lifespan had reached its natural end (which brings up some existentialism and stuff because she would have only jumped if Light died, and Light only died because Ryuk wrote his name down, and the lifespans are supposed to be independent of the influence of shinigami)."
deathnote,3cvo70,Starkiller2,3,Sat Jul 11 05:29:15 2015 UTC,"Ryuk wrote Light's name because he was going to die, I feel the possibility of Light's death to result in Misa's suicide is indirect and irrelevant."
deathnote,3cvo70,PartisanPanda,2,Sat Jul 11 12:06:55 2015 UTC,"I think Ryuk wrote down lights name as a favour to him, he said his life was already over, suggesting him being in jail with no purpose is was as good as being dead.

deathnote,3cvuug,Inita_Life,5,Sat Jul 11 05:12:00 2015 UTC,I mean sure. But that was the point. Light wanted them to know someone or something was behind it. The longer the goverment didn't notice the longer the people wouldn't. It wasn't his goal to kill people. It was an end to the means of making a perfect world where people where to afraid to be anything he deemed as unworthy.

deathnote,3cqkj5,Darkbloomy,6,Thu Jul 9 23:50:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the drama yet, but it already sounds like an improvement from the anime/manga.   My biggest problem with the original story was that Light never seemed like a human character at all. Sure, the high concept of his character was cool (super genius high schooler granted with power over life and death), but we never got to see the more human side of him: very few interactions with his family or classmates, hardly any meaningful transition between him getting the book and deciding to take over the world, and almost no indication of his personality outside of/ before he became Kira.   I think giving him some friends and allowing him to act more human makes him a much more sympathetic character and could even leave a lot of possibilities for plot threads, given the expanded cast. Doing that in the original manga/anime could have kept the story running for a lot longer and would have kept it fresh in the process. If Light were originally written more human, Death Note easily would have become one of the best manga series out there (and even as is, it's still up there)."

deathnote,3cllhq,TkSMisTakeS,5,Wed Jul 8 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"First of all,  that whole scene on the stairs after the rooftop scene didn't happen in the manga, so no answers there.  I believe the rooftop scene wasn't even in there either.

It is true Light killed a shit load of people, and even Ryuk was amazed at how many people Light killed, but by no means was Light ever going to get rid of evil. Evil people still existed, and it was only that they were afraid to do anything because of fear of getting killed by Kira. Everyone on Earth was a prisoner, and that oppression did not make the world a better place just because crime was down. L did some shady stuff in order to win and solve his cases. He was not doing it because he was a good person, but rather doing so with cases he was only interested in. Kira was an interest to him because it was challenging, but he pretty much figured it all out within a few episodes. If he could have, he would have had Light killed or detained until he felt satisfied that he was wrong. They both were childish and were willing to do things to win at the expense of other peoples lives."

No need to kill 18 million people when you can lower crime rates without mass murder."
deathnote,3cl20w,prillin101,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'm an L supporter. My first time watching I liked Light until he killed Raye Penber, but watching it again I found that I honestly should've started hating him during the first episode. He's supposed to be someone who kills bad people for the betterment of society, but he's so petty that he can't help but kill anyone who opposes him because of his god complex, and he starts doing that when he kills Lind L. Tailor. Had he not killed Tailor, there'd be no possible way for them to pinpoint his location, but he was too arrogant. Not a single innocent person had to die and it's all Light's fault that they did.  L wasn't perfect either. He was ok with letting people die in order to prove his point, but I feel like he did it well within reason. The people he let die were all criminals (from what I recall) and he had a ""needs of the many"" outlook. He took it too far with the incarceration of Misa, Light and Soichiro, but keeping suspects and volunteer inmates locked up is nothing compared to murdering people who are just doing their job, so L obviously wins the morality battle.    But morality aside, I think L's just cooler. Weird people are awesome."
deathnote,3cl20w,Amy_Echo,2,Wed Jul 8 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"I supported Light, because I supported his ideals of removing criminals, on top of the fact I really wanted to see the new world. The problem with Light was that he had a very black and white sense of justice. Crimes have occurred throughout mankind's history, and killing criminals won't just stop crime. He did reduce crime by 70%, but he did not address the real roots of crime. Sometimes people are forced to steal, due to poverty, and sometimes people do kill for justifiable reasons .For example kill or be killed situations, or revenge killings for murder/rape/torture of friends/family - justifiable reasons imo. He never took cases on an individual basis, and  killed a lot of innocent/framed people.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and I knew the notebook corrupted him - look at the ethical difference between him in Kira mode and him in non-Kira mode. His descent into madness was entertaining, and I also liked his 'ends justify the means attitude'. The biggest factor in siding with Light is if I had the notebook I too would go down Light's path of eliminating criminals.  I admired L aswell, for his humour and intelligence. L was not really justice or a white knight either. The only thing holding L back from ruthless techniques such as extensive torture was the investigation force, and he too was driven by what he described as a childish ideal of hating to lose (although hating to lose isn't really childish).L considered Light and Misa as his two only friends in his life, because he thought they were the 1st and 2nd Kira. As soon as suspicions were cleared, he seemed very depressed. I would say that he got a high off being friends with mass murderers, which is quite sick."
deathnote,3cl20w,leechlord95,2,Thu Jul 9 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"Actually Light didn't killed those who has justifiable reasons. He looked why the murderers he killed, killed. It's not like he just went on a google search and then killed every criminal that he found on the internet   He also didn't killed people who killed in self defense either, same with the people who killed someone who murdered their family.   About the innocent/framed people... That was one reason why L though that there was a second Kira, because the second Kira (Misa) didn't cared who he killed, and killed those who weren't proven to be guilty. It's however possible, that he killed framed people, I'll give you that.   I'm glad you're not one of this ''L is justice, Kira sucks'', people, who think that L is some sort of a messiah."
deathnote,3cl20w,ImJustAHunter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think that's kind of a moot question. I'm pretty sure most, if not all of us, here support Lights ideals, while also supporting L taking him out.  Light had a noble and good ideal throughout the show, but more and more towards the end he abandoned parts of it to achieve his goal. At the end you could even argue he gave up the entire thing for a selfish plan to being king of everything so the only reasonable thing is to root for L taking him out."
deathnote,3cl20w,TriMageRyan,0,Wed Jul 8 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"They're equal in my mind. They're both evil.  Kira ignores the law for his own benefit (godhood), and in the name ""justice"".  L ignores the law for his own benefit (the challenge), and in the name of ""justice"".    Where on Earth do people see them as radically diverging? They both do the same kind of things for less-than-noble reasons, and for ""justice"". If one is evil, then why isn't the other evil?    I wish that one of them were kind of like Batman in the sense that they could say, ""I'm fighting for justice, but in case I'm actually crazy and misguided, then here are my rules, a set of standards that I won't cross, so I will be, at the very least, a different kind of evil than ____"".  They didn't keep a set of rules, and so it just became a set of different forms of amoralisms fighting. Which was awesome. But I wasn't routing for either of them."

In Death Note, the character development of Light wasn't staggering. It was simply a demonstration of what lengths he'll go and how he'll up the stakes for his ideal world. Now you have a version of Light who still wants that ideal world but is crippled and flawed. This could make for great character development. I'm not saying that's it's going to be great but it will interesting to see how the show runners write Light."

deathnote,3cka50,Darkbloomy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:25:29 2015 UTC,If this were real life you'd be right. Light would be so screwed. However because this is a TV show I'm sure Light will have a lot of moments as he will probably fall under the underdog trope.
deathnote,3cka50,biersackarmy,2,Thu Jul 9 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Light is more emotional and more ""human"" in the drama. That's a good thing though. We are seeing a different side of him and if it sticked 100% to anime/manga it would've been boring."

deathnote,3ci8kh,Kirito_Solo_Player,4,Wed Jul 8 02:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think Light had good intentions. And a messed up idea of how to make them work. He did get crime rate down by, what, 40%? And stop all wars in 6 years, but he killed innocent people. I see what /u/MasterConor is saying, and I somewhat agree, but not really.  Yeah, you could argue that he had to kill these people so he could keep killing. But to be honest, the only death that was maybe necessary was L's. Raye Penber found nothing suspicious about him. Had he not killed the FBI agents he probably would have been better off.  Him killing them is why he was suspected in the first place ffs! And Naomi wouldn't have gotten involved, or at least wouldn't have figured out as much as she she did. As for L? It's hard to say. If the FBI agents hadn't been killed, L would have kept looking for something. If Light was careful he might be fine, but that would depend on how far L was willing to go. And that's just if Light didn't make it into a game and challenge  L the way he did. There are so many ways that could go that I won't even try to get into it. But let's say that was the case, and L still suspected L. In that case, the other people would still have been no threat. So I really don't think they were killed so Kira could continue. I think they were killed because Light was playing a deadly game. Although, in this scenario there is still the possibility of other people coming into play that would actually need to be killed, so it's hard to say.  And he also let the president of the US kill himself, by not giving information. I don't think it was in the anime, but the president killed himself because he thought Kira would make him set off nuclear bombs. Giving the information that you can't make someone kill people with the death note when the president called asking wouldn't have compromised Light because they had already found the notebook and the rules. Not exactly murder, just letting him die.Of course, arguably, this was still for Kira's benifit as the result was the vice president deciding America would accept Kira. I'll give Light this one. I don't agree, but this could fall under the category of sacrifices to help Kira.  So Light killed innocent people, but he also made crime go down and eliminated wars. I don't agree with all his actions, but I can't call all of them wrong either. For the most part he did stick to criminals. Whether they all deserved to die was arguable, but the positive impact was clear.  I think Light was both right and wrong in a lot of ways. I think he was egotistical and cocky, and maybe somewhat selfish. I don't know how I feel about what he did as a whole. To say he did nothing wrong is not true, in my opinion, but that doesn't mean he was necessarily bad. I don't think what he did was right but I also don't think it was completely wrong.   I think Light was a good person. A good person with an optimistic idea and a deadly notebook. And I think he slowly changed into someone less good.  I don't know. I'm kind of rambling. I have mixed feelings, basically. I honestly felt bad for him."
deathnote,3ci8kh,IaniteThePirate,3,Wed Jul 8 06:07:19 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you come from.  I totally agree that Light did not NEED to kill Raye Penber (which eventually led to the death of Naomi as well).  I think at that point, Light was power hungry and wanted to kill anyone that served as a threat to his plans.  Then again, with the murder of Raye Penber, I personally take into account that Light did not necessarily know that Raye did not suspect him.  Readers and watchers read/watched Raye admit that he did not suspect Light to be Kira.  However, Light had no way of knowing for sure that Raye had no suspicions of him.  I think that Light/Kira killed Raye as a precaution.  By not killing Raye, Light could have risked the chance that Raye did suspect him and would eventually catch on to Light's ploy if he was not killed.  Killing the other American detectives was necessary because he thought he needed to kill Raye to be safe.  Like Light says, by killing the other detectives, Raye's death could not be traced back to Light himself.  And unlike /u/Kirito_Solo_Player, I do not believe that Light did nothing wrong.  However, I do believe that the good that was done by Light/Kira easily outweighs the bad."
deathnote,3ci8kh,MasterConor,2,Wed Jul 8 06:35:13 2015 UTC,"That's true. I didn't consider that Light, unlike the reader/watcher, wouldn't know.   That certainly changes my view a little bit, about that part at least. Light was more paranoid early on, and probably was power hungry enough so killing Raye was a good idea to him. I supose it's pretty impressive that L narrowed down the suspects to Light like he did too. Light may not have thought  that L could even do that. Yeah, you're right. It wasn't necessary, but Light didn't know that at the time. Killing the agents was less of a risk than if Raye had found something."
deathnote,3ci8kh,IaniteThePirate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"To gain perspective it helps to think as if you're the writer. Light needs to be a character you sympathize with but also deserve to die. Thinking he is just, is as foolish as the kira sympathizers, which the show mocks.  In regards to lights actions. Penber seems like a mistake because it made it obvious who kira was, But its safe to assume  L would have found him anyways because he already knew it was someone inside internal investigation, it would have just taken longer.  Light's real mistake was killing the first person who defied him and revealing the extent of his powers. Light was good enough they'd never be able to catch him even if they tried. In reality every door Light thought he was closing by killing someone to hide his secret, only ended up pointing to him in the end."

deathnote,3ci8kh,prillin101,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"What other method?  Improving education in poor areas, decreasing concentrated poverty and ghettos, providing familial education to newly married, providing sex education to children, replacing gang-fraternity with a more positive brotherhood-esque alternative, providing drug education and more accessible/free drug rehabilitation, support for the abused and molested, and legalization of certain safe drugs to decrease gang power: http://www.bocsar.nsw.gov.au/Documents/cjb54.pdf  The idea that criminals will always be criminals is conservative spiel and not corroborated by evidence. Therefore prisoner rehabilitation is the correct path, not the path we are on now (Prison should be for rehabilitation, not punishment): https://cpoc.memberclicks.net/assets/Realignment/risk_need_2007-06_e.pdf   he even stopped wars   Could've easily been done by killing the leaders of whatever state is at war instead of killing 18 million people. Killing 18 million people when you could've killed just a few thousand?  That's a false dichotomy, there aren't only 2 options. Instead of killing everyone, you can just kill a few."

The facts were shown, Kira's work actually helped.  The crime rates went down.  Although, the argument can be made that Kira and Light are completely different people.  When Light gives up the Death Note, he is obviously determined to kill Kira.  The Death Note turned Light into a sociopath.  Light had good intentions when he became Kira and his intentions were fulfilled.  Light accomplished his goals of making the world a better place.  Whether his actions were morally just or not, Light reduced the crime rates around the world."
deathnote,3ci8kh,Mr_Sneakz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"The take away shouldn't be is Light good or is Light bad. Light had good intentions but he was very young and deluded by the power he got from the Death Note. It became too easy to get what he wanted. This was a solution, a morally reprehensible one but if it's possible shouldn't it be done?  That isn't the real world. We don't have easy solutions. It's why it takes more than a seventeen year old with a good idea to make things work. It's hard. You have to have good ideas and be able to execute them without actually hurting people or people's lives. Constant damage control.  Light was good. But the Death Note removing every difficulty made him an awful depraved person."

Out on the roof in the rain is when I assume he figured everything out.
