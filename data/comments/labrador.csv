labrador,3dyc65,petit_cochon,15,Mon Jul 20 15:12:26 2015 UTC,This just melts my heart.  Our beautiful chocolate lab died over two years ago and I'm still devastated.  Why would someone abandon a sweet dog like that???    Oh damnit now I'm a grown man getting misty at work.  RIGHT in the feels.
labrador,3dyc65,Nojopar,8,Mon Jul 20 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said, I think she was a breeder. She wasn't neutered, has clearly had litters before, and her bottom teeth are completely worn down, possibly from chewing on a chain or a fence. I think as she got older they just decided to toss her. It's sadly common. But it's my gain.   Losing a dog is pretty hard. You never forget them."
labrador,3dyc65,-HUSH-,15,Mon Jul 20 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"This is Iris! She was found wandering the roads outside of New Orleans with another dog. I think she was a breeder and that they tossed her when she got a little older. She has heartworms and some allergy issues, but the shelter is covering the heartworm treatment and the allergies are clearing up. She is incredibly sweet, gentle, and calm, and has been perfect around my cats.  Abandoned labs are a big problem down here. If you love the breed and are looking to get a new dog, please consider working through a lab rescue like Labs4Rescue, or checking out your local shelter. I waited until I found the dog I felt would fit into our home, and bringing her home was just such a great feeling. Best $67 I ever spent!"

labrador,3dyc65,aerilea,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:13 2015 UTC,I got one of my labs from labs4rescue! He was at a foster home and we adopted him about 11 years ago. He is definitely a black lab mix. He must have been severely beaten and we think thrown off a bridge or something. He won't walk across a bridge to this day :( he also doesn't like brooms or hockey sticks. Anything of that nature. He must have been hit and clamped down on a saliva gland and now he has a gross saliva pouch. My parents bring him to the vet every month to have drained.
labrador,3dyc65,TheDoctorBlind,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"Poor boo. That's a lot of abuse. They're a really great organization, but I had better luck this time working with a shelter. I know how much they do to help rescue dogs. I was on their short list recently to foster some lab puppies. Someone had dropped off mama and 10 puppies at a shelter. But someone else got to 'em first!"
labrador,3dyc65,dodgeboy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"He's very happy though! It doesn't seem to hold him back much. He's older now so he's lived a good life :)  I don't know how people can do that! It's just unbelievable to me. But better a good shelter than a crap home. I just rescued Maggie, a 6 year old yellow lab from an older lady. she is the most wonderful dog I've ever had. Next year I'm hitting the shelter in search for an older dog friend."

labrador,3dxpsb,illuminati_agent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:58:12 2015 UTC,His parents sound like great sizes for a Lab. The may get a little bit taller but at his age probably not much. Labs tend to continue filling out until about 2 years old.

labrador,3dxpsb,narcedmonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"He'll get bigger, mine filled out after a year and a half. The 6-10 month stages are the awkwardest for a growing lab, they look goofy and out of proportion!"
labrador,3dxpsb,SwtSthrnBelle,0,Tue Jul 21 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a little torn on this. Are you upset he isn't bigger? Are you going to get rid of him because he isn't bigger? Dogs are not temporary pets and I hope you aren't considering letting him go. As for growing, 12 months is when they typically stop growing, but they can grow probably up to a year and a half as is normal with larger dog breeds. If you exercise him rigorously, that can effect how much he grows (just like you wouldn't have a toddler run a marathon, puppies shouldn't be over exerted either). Basically, it's a waiting game. I would venture to say that he will grow a bit more, but not a whole lot. I don't think you got the runt. Labs aren't exceptionally large dogs to begin wktj, so he seems to be about average. Still a very handsome boy."
labrador,3dxpsb,ohhoneyno_,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"No I do not plan on getting rid of him. I would like him to get bigger, the same size or bigger than his dad would be nice. But if it doesn't happen I will live with it.   I came up with the money, paid for him, and have already paid for almost as much as I paid for him as I have in vet bills (shots, check ups, xray after a first time on a leash incident). I wouldn't have done all that if I wanted to get rid of him."

labrador,3drxhd,boredx2,3,Sun Jul 19 09:33:34 2015 UTC,"We had it the other way around. We had the puppy and introduced a kitten. The puppy wanted to play while the kitten wanted to escape, which you should let it. It took a good week or so before they would be out together. While we were gone for the first week or so we would keep them housed in separate areas. I think it also had a lot to do with them being young.  Don't give up though -- it can be irritating at times, but well worth it in the end!"

labrador,3du9h0,girlinpearls,4,Sun Jul 19 15:11:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my lab.   Give her lots of love, and you will get it back 10 fold."
labrador,3du9h0,MedievalValor,4,Sun Jul 19 16:01:41 2015 UTC,Exercise! Keep her lean. Labs are prone to elbow and hip issues. Sign up for an obedience class. It will be good for both of you. Check out the sidebar on /r/dogtraining
labrador,3du9h0,BlueBG82,3,Sun Jul 19 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"I suggest hand-feeding occasionally. Give her lots of attention. Labradors in particular want to know that you love them, and one easy way to show that is positive attention. Definitely check out /r/dogtraining. Labs are particularly motivated by food and positive praise. Set up a routine - something you do every day with her that she can depend on and look forward to. Examples: long walks at the same time each day, playing fetch when you arrive home from work (fetch can be taught to ""most"" Labradors), Treats & Training time to review tricks and / or learn new ones."
labrador,3du9h0,thoughtful_elf,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:50 2015 UTC,"She's likely been abused and badly. Just give her time. Dogs need to feel like part of a pack and just feed her. Labs love eating and being part of the pack. Just give her time. When you say ""play with other dogs, jumps in any and all water, loves all people/nice to dogs"" do you men she does not do these things or does these things? It sounds like a typical rescue lab to me."
labrador,3du9h0,labradorasaurus,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"Separation anxiety is common in abandoned dogs. If she hates the crate, don't push it. Leave the door open, put treats and blankets inside, and let her have the option of it.   If she was healthy and heartworm free, that's a good sign!   Labs love attention, they're very food-oriented and easy to train because of that. Just keep giving her love and she will be ok. Labs in general have very sweet temperaments, but they tend to be high-energy so give her plenty of play time!"
labrador,3du9h0,petit_cochon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"Lots of love and walks will do wonders. Extreme changes like a new family is extremely stressful for dogs, she needs time to adjust and learn to trust you."

labrador,3dpjq5,Connador,5,Sat Jul 18 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I have a 7 year old who has extreme anxiety. If we can't be there when fireworks are going off, we leave him with the radio turned on (noise comforts him) and a comfort stuffed animal and blanket that smell like me (he attached himself to me when I first met him). Crates or other small places make for good hiding places for them. But, as long as you're there with him and he can feel and see you, he should be okay. I've found most dogs are alright so long as they see their owner is safe and that they are also safe. Trust is especially vital in this. If anything, lots of loving, keeping him busy (with a rawhide or playing or walking), and positive reinforcement will get him through this. Props on adopting a senior dog. They're the best."
labrador,3dpjq5,ohhoneyno_,2,Sat Jul 18 05:28:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I've been unsure on whether to buy him a crate or not. He's never had one before, but he does seem to have a 'U' shaped spot in my room that he likes to go to when he sleeps, so maybe he would benefit from it after all.  I'm definitely going to take your advice about what to do when I leave, thanks for that. Between me and my girlfriend I'd definitely say that he's bonded with me more, so maybe I need to project that I'm ok when the fireworks/jets happen. I tend to immediately start petting him when they happen so I'm not sure if that's scaring him somehow.  Bonus picture, him waiting to go outside after a shower"
labrador,3dpjq5,ohhoneyno_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:40:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the dog as far as crating goes. Sometimes, dogs will get overly territorial when they grow accustomed to a new home and a crate becomes their own place and curbs that behavior. But if he's fine, then I don't think its necessary. No point in spending money you dont have to. My only advice for the petting and stuff is don't freak out or show him any negative or very strong emotions. Even though he's an older dog, he can still develop bad habits and begin to think ""spazzing out = getting what I want"". But, in this photo it seems like he's come to you for comfort instead of barking and tearing things up which is great. Body language is vital in this. If you're petting him or hugging him, see how he is. Is he still tense? Is he relaxed? What is happening, essentially. You can tell a lot by how they feel. If he really starts freaking out, make him sit or do another trick so that he's focused on you and you alone. Then, proceed to give him treats or a toy or even a hug to reassure him. Sometimes just getting them out of that mood is all it takes. He's a very handsome boy and doesn't show his age at all. I hope all is well. Do tell us how it goes. :)"
labrador,3dpjq5,I_AM_THE_LIQUEUR,3,Sat Jul 18 06:09:29 2015 UTC,"Before the comments come in I'd just like to say that he's wearing a thundershirt, and I just adopted him 6 months ago. The past owner didn't do a lot of things right, including socializing him and loud noises.   We're making progress though, so I got him one to maybe help in the meantime."
labrador,3dpjq5,cbiggins,2,Sat Jul 18 05:16:55 2015 UTC,"This is one reason that crate training your dog is important, I see that you adopted the dog from a shelter so that might be tough, but it's important.  It functions as their 'den' if you do it right. My lab isnt scared of fireworks, because she's shotgun trained, but she loses her fuckin mind and tried to find ducks or something around the house when that's going on. If I put her in her crate, stops it all. She feels safe, secure and chills out.   I see so many people talking about thunder shirts, and sitting in confined spaces with your dog. This is all just rewarding your dog for acting the way it shouldn't.  It's a lab, they're extremely smart, and they want to please you. There is nothing wrong with telling your dog 'no' when they're pulling the anxiety routine. I'll probably be downvoted for saying that, but it works.  Good luck with your dog. If there's anything I help answer about crate training, feel free to ask."

labrador,3djq0h,BlueBG82,0,Thu Jul 16 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks that's great to know, looking to register the big softie but we have none of his paperwork (rescue dog) so we're trying to decide if we should register him to breed or not."
labrador,3djq0h,0492084120,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"From UKC site: Color may be solid black, any solid shade of yellow from red to pale cream, or any solid shade of chocolate. Yellow dogs may have variations in shading on the ears, back and underside of the dog.  Your dog looks like he well fits into the yellow standard to me."

labrador,3dejeq,daresign89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:30:21 2015 UTC,you need a yellow lab to complete the set.
labrador,3dg8bv,quartermann,3,Thu Jul 16 00:55:39 2015 UTC,"Is she just over weight? I've read labs easily over eat which, obviously, leads to extra weight."
labrador,3dg8bv,nthomas1014,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:13:08 2015 UTC,Nope. In fact the vet said the older one was underweight at 94.
labrador,3dg8bv,BlueBG82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:28:07 2015 UTC,No quality breeder is going to purposely breed dogs outside the breed standard.
labrador,3dg8bv,hello_kritty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that's what I'm running into. However, I've seen other labs this size and trying to determine if it's a new thing like silver labs... Which many ""quality"" breeders might say are actually not a separate color.  ::shrugs:: Not planning on taking any to a akc show anytime soon so ""quality"" doesn't concern me."
labrador,3dg8bv,birdiesinatree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:36:36 2015 UTC,It might also depend on the type of lab? I have a male American lab and he's 66 lbs with no more growing to do.
labrador,3dg8bv,turini,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:06:52 2015 UTC,Wow! Congrats on finding a unique dog yourself. That's probably the size my wife would prefer... But I'm used to these big lugs now. ;-)

labrador,3clvi6,StormSurge12,3,Thu Jul 9 03:49:42 2015 UTC,":( I'm sorry, he looks awesome.  Saved this back when my Golden passed nearly 3 years ago. Not my words.    Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to “death”, don’t really understand this. I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must.  Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk.  It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.  However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.  When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.”  When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)  Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.  But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are.  I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You’ve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now."
labrador,3clvi6,mr_eveland,3,Thu Jul 9 20:57:59 2015 UTC,Wow.  That just made me cry.  What an amazing piece.

labrador,3clvi6,mr_eveland,2,Thu Jul 9 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"Well said, my friend.  Based on your words, it's not a stretch to say: Luke had the kind of life dogs can only dream of.  That's the most we can ever do for our canine family members.  I always felt that my boy knew that, maybe it was just me trying to stay positive when things got tough.  I'm so sorry for what you're going through.  Stay strong."

labrador,3clvi6,gun_moll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Unfortunately we had to put him to sleep last Friday.  He started seizing shortly after I posted this on Wednesday.  A call to the vet informed me that once the seizures had started, we only had 24 - 48 hours.  I immediately started setting up appointments to get a mobile vet out to the house to do it here.  I had a whole day planned out with steak meals, a short walk to a park really close to the house and a last game of fetch right before the vet was to arrive.  He barely made it back from our 2 block walk.  He was so tired.  I sat on the floor for over an hour rubbing & petting on him, waiting for the vet.  He rallied toward the end, even barking at the door bell when some flowers were delivered & when the vet arrived.  I'm confident that it wasn't too late, that he was still Luke & not suffering.  Had we waited another day, I think that would've been a different story.  He died in the arms of my wife & I...loved, rubbed & happy.  I hate that he was taken so early, but I'm happy he didn't suffer any.  I miss him so much."

labrador,3btl16,jacksonruckus,3,Thu Jul 2 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"I bought two harnesses for my lab, who is now 13yrs 2mos. I first bought a simple sling, this one on Amazon. I used this to assist him going up, but this did not work well going downstairs since it could slip back to his hindquarters. So I bought one with front leg holes, this one (it appears to be out of stock). However I never got much use out of the second one, since he was able to go down the stairs fairly well on his own.   I only used these to assist him by taking some of the weight off his feet. I don't think these would work well to actually lift him completely off the ground and carry him. Neither of these harnesses were designed for that, I don't believe they have enough support for the entire length of his body, being primarily intended for relieving front end weight. That's a lot of dog to try and hold up while navigating stairs.  My primary need was getting him up to the second floor of our house, where the master bedroom is; he loved that bedroom with the big windows overlooking our acreage and would whine all night long if I didn't get him upstairs. Your situation is different since it sounds like you're looking at outdoor public stairs. However, another item we got was stick-on nonslip stair tread grips . My stairs are limestone tiles and his feet kept slipping out from under him. These really helped a lot.  Between the sling and the stair tread grips, he was able to use the stairs for another six months or so. Eventually even those aids wouldn't do it, so now we sleep in the guest room on the main level. It's difficult watching him grow old and really slow down (he mostly sleeps these days). Unfortunately I don't expect to have him around much longer.  Best of luck."

My mom took him to the vet today, and the vet confirmed that he does, in fact, have advanced stages of Lymphoma. The best case scenario we were given is that he has 3 months left if he increases his protein intake. Worst case is 4-6 weeks. The good thing is that the vet said he isn't in any pain. I am completely broken. This is my best friend and I'm watching him die.  On a brighter note, my mom and I are starting a bucket list for Sam. Does anyone have any suggestions on what we could add to it?  EDIT 7/07/15: Sam was euthanized this morning after a tough decision from our family. Last night was awful. He had lost the ability to use his hind legs and refused to eat, but still kept a smile on his face. I'm glad that I was with him through the night.

Sam has never been duck hunting. Period. Hahahahaha  Edit: I had to add more. Yes, Sam has had a wonderful, spoiled life. Before he got too chubby, he was the only dog we've ever allowed on furniture (and now, Jackie is!). Mostly bc he was so cute when he tried to sneak into your lap one foot at a time!"

Just an FYI you can just drop in some swimmer's ear alcohol drops when he gets out of the water for infection prevention! My vet and trainers advised doing that and we've had no infections in his 8 months of swimming almost every day.  Sam looks like such a sweet dog. I'm sure he will be missed but just know that his time with your family was heaven to him. Take lots of bucket list pictures!

When talking about the inevitable ""last days"", my hubby and I have thrown around a few food ideas. The local international market offers halal goat and sheep heads. We think she'd love to have one of those in the back yard. Her happiness would outweigh my revulsion.  So often they can't eat toward the end, so I might push the food treats earlier rather than later.  Best to you."

labrador,3bp90i,quakesurvivor,7,Thu Jul 2 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"My lab recently passed after knowing he had lymphoma after 6 weeks.  It was horrible because I was away from college but we made damn sure to give him whatever he wanted.  Before he got bad enough where he couldn't walk, we would bring him to the park and let him pick his own toys out from petsmart.  We let him have hamburgers, steak, and carrots too.  Also you can never go wrong with peanut butter.  Not to make you feel worse but however long you think you have left with him, cut that in half because after a certain point it will be pure agony to watch.  My lab tried to run away multiple times when we let him out to go the bathroom which reminded me of the movie Marley and me.  Really the best thing to make sure he enjoys the rest of his time is to give him all the love you have.

labrador,3biija,Steve-Stungun,6,Mon Jun 29 14:37:43 2015 UTC,What a wonderful wise looking guy. People that haven't experienced do not understand the bond people can have with pets that grow old with them. It's painful to watch them age in what seems like such a short time. Knowing that time is growing slim and there isn't much you can do. If I had one wish it would be that our pets could grow old with us. I recently had to put down my 16 year old cat that has lived with me since he was born. I think about him everyday.
labrador,3biija,throwitaway2275,3,Mon Jun 29 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Looks like a great friend.  I got my pup at 8 weeks, and she is now going on 13 years.

labrador,3bihf1,GornoP,2,Mon Jun 29 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"And incredibly smart and well behaved.  I got her from the pound, so I can't take credit for the training, but she's house broken, knows all kinds of commands, great with kids, never barks (unless someone unknown to her comes to the house, then she's an air-raid siren), etc.  The only living thing I've seen her show aggression toward were other dogs and then only after ample provocation (My sister's dog bite her once and she put his ass on the ground and growled, but didn't hurt him.)  Pretty much the perfect combination of a lab's smarts and desire to please and a pit's awareness and energy."
labrador,3bihf1,BlueBG82,2,Mon Jun 29 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that aggression, she was just making it clear to the other dog that she won't put up with bad behaviour :)"

labrador,3bgvbm,gbeezy09,2,Mon Jun 29 02:50:14 2015 UTC,YouTube can be super helpful. The trick is to pick a certain method and stick with it. Hint - treat based training works well for labs. However it can cause them to gain weight. When I had lab puppies I would use half of their dinner for training then give them the other half in their bowl.
labrador,3bgvbm,craig5005,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:01:36 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've read a lot about treat based training with labs and I think I'm gonna go with that. Do you know whats so special with clickers?
labrador,3bgvbm,Monsta4000,2,Mon Jun 29 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"Clickers give you a consistent, repeatable recognition of favourable behavior... It's kinda like being able to say ""good girl"" in the exact same way, quickly and effortlessly during training. Your gorgeous little lab will respond best to consistency, especially to a consistent reward sound.  You do have to ""load"" your clicker. First training sessions will pretty much be just clicking and treat, clicking and treat... Repeat, repeat... So you get that classic Pavlovian response and your pup associates the click with reward. Then you click/reward every time you get behavior you want... Gradually rewarding less and less as well as less consistently. This is a great way to be able to train a lot and not worry about her little waistline so much.  With regard to reference materials I agree with Craig.. YouTube is amazing. Has it all over books because you can see the techniques tho may lack detail and background theory. I especially love kikopup.   Your initial concerns are gonna pretty much be about toilet training and directing/target her play to toys and not everything else laying around. Some people highly recommend crate training. We used an outdoor exercise pen/cage in our dining area. Basically you wanna control her environment as much as you can at the start. She'll never develop a shoe fetish if she never has an opportunity to develop one.  My biggest recommend would be to go through all the kikopup vids for puppy training. Also... Don't forget... To enjoy every moment. They are only so tiny and puppy smelling for such a short time."
labrador,3bgvbm,craig5005,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:50:31 2015 UTC,It's good for dogs that aren't motivated by food. Some dogs just don't care for a treat here and there. Labs on the other hand....

labrador,3bbo1v,growlers_rock,0,Sat Jun 27 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"I was very nonchalant about my lab playing with sticks, he would chew them up and never swallow a thing. But unfortunately 2 weeks ago out of the corner of my eye I saw him running with a big stick with the point in his mouth- before I could tell him to leave it the other end of the stick hit the ground. He yelped and barked and yelped some more. When I ran over and opened his mouth it was full of blood. It was a really rough night not knowing how bad his injury was. It turned out to not be that bad, a 1cm puncture in the back of his mouth. Vet checked it and was not concerned and he has healed very very quickly. He is now off sticks completely and I plead with you to do the same now. When it happened the sick feeling in my stomach came back for the first time since combat in Iraq 10 years ago- I don't want anyone to feel that. There are terrible stories on the internet about these injuries, please do what you can early to prevent them.   Sorry to be a debbie downer, enjoy your beautiful girl!"

The sitting I was super lucky with. I think I made him sit like twice with a treat. He got it super quick. Same with lay down. Its simple, you force them once or twice and they get it.

If there is any downside, and it's minor in the grand scheme of things, they can get into bad habits and look so damn cute doing it that you don't correct them right away.  Make sure you break them of any bad habits quickly.  Fortunately, labbies are very trainable and so eager to please that a little firmness goes a long way."

For the most part if I need to be doing something, after a bit, she'll end up just laying down either at my feet if I'm at a desk/table, or by my side if I'm on a couch or bed. There have been times though where I've had to tell her to stop following me because I know I'll be walking from room to room doing things for a while and I feel bad making her go all over the place.   She has always gotten plenty of playtime, exercise, attention, food and water, etc. so she's pretty much just fine if I can't immediately stimulate her with toys or attention. Now, that was probably a different story when she was a pup though since that is when they need the most care to help them grow, and tons of love and affection to help build that bond. However, I was still just a kid when we got her, so even though she was ""my dog"", it wasn't until I was probably 15 or 16 that she really became my responsibility."

I've got a black lab, so her fur is also super visible.. I bet yellow ones are a little more camouflaged. At least on the floor.   Either way, this little lab is my best friend. In fact, we're cuddling right now. I can only hope that you can your husband get to experience the same love and joy that my Lana brings to my home."
labrador,3bb3rn,itsallsamantics,3,Sat Jun 27 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"I've had many Labs. Good food, frequent bruhsing and vacuuming will help with the shedding and hair. However, there will still be hair around because there is a dog in the house. If your husband can't tolerate hair and farting and drooling and wet and mud no amount of ""extra hair care"" is going to make a difference. Getting a dog for the first time is a big change especially if he's not 100% on board."
labrador,3bb3rn,BlueBG82,2,Sun Jun 28 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is true for any of you other lab folks but my labs differ greatly. I have one American male and one English female, both black. The American has a lighter coat that barely produces hair when I brush except just at the base of his tail. The English has what seems like 4 coats that never stop shedding. She blows tufts if you just look at her. We vacuum daily with the 2 labs and a heeler and the hair isn't bad at all."

labrador,3bb3rn,Adrian1657,2,Thu Jul 9 02:27:11 2015 UTC,I have 2 labs and sweep 3 to 4 times a week. I think you will be fine
labrador,3bb3rn,roonerhasit,2,Sat Jun 27 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"If you brush and vacuum daily (really, every day) then it shouldn't be too bad - but there is plenty of hair shed, don't fool yourself!  A small sacrifice to make for all the joy you get back. ;)"
labrador,3bb3rn,jsamuelson,2,Sat Jun 27 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"I have 2 dogs. A 100 lb yellow lab and a 65 lb 1/2 lab 1/2 Chesapeake bay retriever. The imitation furminator from target and vacuuming daily is fine. Will your house be as hair free as if you didn't have a dog? No. But it's about as good as you will get while owning a dog. Also, bathe the dog and your house shouldn't have a smell."
labrador,3bb3rn,Wilson2424,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:43:28 2015 UTC,He's worried about the shedding? He should be more worried about your lab rolling in poop. They like to do that. Hunting instinct.
labrador,3b34wy,The_magik,5,Thu Jun 25 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I had to look at that twice. So beautiful.  I have the exact reverse situation in terms of size/color.   And around a year ago"
labrador,3b34wy,gnualmafuerte,2,Thu Jun 25 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"Very cute! I think there might be a bigger age gap between your two pups than mine, my two are just under 3 years apart?"
labrador,3b34wy,gnualmafuerte,4,Thu Jun 25 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"The male is 4 years old now, the little girl is barely a year old. I had arranged to get her when her mother was just pregnant, but I had to take her home WAY too early (27 days) because her mother didn't have enough milk, and didn't want the puppies. That's when Ateo (the black lab) surprised me ... he turned into her big brother. He was protective of her since the day I brought her home. Playing with her all day in the most gentle way I've ever seen. I bottle fed her for a while, while giving her small amounts of cooked meat, and the big guy come feeding time would let her eat from his bowl. Cutest thing I've ever seen. That is, until a month ago when she had her first heat ;-). I had to take her to my mother's house because the other guy was going crazy (I don't like to neuter animals, specially the way it's done, it's barbaric. Big guy has the family jewels intact), he almost didn't eat for a week!   Anyway, they are back to normal now. I will let them go at it in a year or so, and will keep at least one of the puppies (The rest already have found homes with my mother, sister and friends).   The only thing that kills me about their age gap is knowing that Ateo will probably die first, and while I will be devastated, I can't imagine how she is going to be. It's all she has known since she was born, I have to bring them together to the vet because she gets terrible anxious whenever they get separated for more than a few moments."
labrador,3b34wy,gnualmafuerte,2,Thu Jun 25 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny how they take on the caretaker role. Our older one did too, admittedly not straight away like yours but within a week they were best friends.  I think the same thing about the younger one too she's never been alone, she went straight from her litter to home with Tavi. When we do have to rarely separate them(vet/bath ect) she doesn't do too well."
labrador,3b34wy,gnualmafuerte,2,Thu Jun 25 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's incredible how close they become. I think the cutest thing I've seen is how he protects her at the beach. They love to swim, and I live by the sea shore in a mostly unpopulated area, so they go there all the time. When I took him alone, he would go way too deep, 150 to 200 meters from the shore. When he swims with her, he goes no further than 20 meters, and if she tries to go further he gets in the way. When she gets tired or scared of waves, she climbs on top of his back. Have you noticed how they learn from each other? The little one learned most of her words from the big guy, she learned to sit and wait for her food, to climb stairs, where to pee in the backyard, just watching him. Things that took me years to tech him, she learned watching him in a few months. It's amazing too how much the big guy changed after she arrived. He's another dog. They love us, but they need other dogs too. He's just been happier, less nervous, and less demanding since she arrived. Also, she is the best pillow he's ever had."
labrador,3b4fsh,bobchin_c,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:54:27 2015 UTC,I don't have an explanation on why she did this but my other dog hates little dogs too. She has no issues walking past or ignoring them but when one runs up to her she always growls and barks. I hate it so much when people come with thier small dogs and go into the big dog park instead of the little dog side. It's not as big but has better play equipment than what's offered at the big side. I could see if they had a large dog and they wanted to keep them together but from what I've experienced that's not the case.
labrador,3b4fsh,nthomas1014,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:26:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a pattern may develop. My black lab, now 13 yrs old, is extraordinarily friendly, but in his life there have been two dogs he has fought on sight. Both were male yellow labs (un-neutered). However, in the first three years of his life we regularly visited friends who had a male yellow lab a little older, and they were the best of friends. I've always wondered whether there was some negative connection in his mind between his puppyhood friend and the dogs he met later.  In addition, my Great Dane growls and snarls at all boxers. No other breed. Just boxers. Go figure."
labrador,3b4fsh,joeomar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:44:47 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll chalk this up to a dog that rubbed her the wrong way on sight. Hell it happens with us, sometimes we can see someone and know immediately and instinctively that they're bad news."

labrador,3b2v22,joeomar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"When my lab was young (first few years) we'd go for a walk around the neighborhood every night. On July 4 I was worried about how he'd react because our neighborhood was wild, people firing massive rockets from the street while everybody lined the sidewalks in lawn chairs. Best night of his life - he completely ignored the fireworks, but he was convinced all the people were lining the sidewalks to meet him. And he had to say hi to every one.  Now he's thirteen and I have two other dogs. We've moved to a house overlooking a valley and we can see firework displays from various towns on the horizon, and all three dogs are miserable. I basically spend the night of the 4th with the curtains down trying to comfort them. I'm not looking forward to it. They're already shooting off firecrackers these days and my Australian shepherd stays pressed against me with his hindquarters trembling. I'll be glad when it's over."

labrador,3auy9f,baphelps18,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:39:27 2015 UTC,One of my labs had really bad allergies and her paws would get really itchy and swollen. Whenever she had a bad flare up she would refuse to walk or fetch things from the grass - I always hypothesized that it was because the grass made her paws itch even more.  Just my personal experience on the subject!
labrador,3aq9e4,The_magik,2,Mon Jun 22 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"This is crazy. We just got a black lab puppy about 3 weeks ago and named it Tavi. We picked it from Rikki-Tikki-Tavi from the Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. How did you pick the name?  Also, where are you getting the ""r"" in the pronunciation?"
labrador,3aq9e4,aragorn18,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"A bit of a stupid story really, me and my wife were thinking of names and my mother in law suggested Javi(not 100% on the spelling) which is apparently golden in  Hindi and we both misheard her and thought she said Tavi.

labrador,3aq9e4,aragorn18,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:32:06 2015 UTC,I guess it would actually be (Ta-vee) but when we pronounce it it sounds like it has an 'r'. Perhaps Australian accent?

labrador,3aqup0,kevint0717,2,Mon Jun 22 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"So, i had a very similar issue with every lab i have owned, and after four dogs, i feel that it is a commonality within the breed. For me, the one boy i had was even worse, and one trainer we had over to see if she might be able to help attributed it to the dog wanting to be in a more dominant role within the family. It made sense to me, but didnt really answer the question of how to deal with it.  What i have always tried to do in this situation is find a way to get the dog to realize youre in charge no matter what. For me, if my dogs were overly aggressive, i would get them in a position where i could easily floor them until they calmed down. Other times, it was just a matter of getting them to focus on doing tricks or other tasks at my command so they would know that what i said went.   As always though, this is just how i devided to raise my labs. The most important thing that i found was always keeping them exercised. Because the thing is, labs are very high energy, high maitanence breed. So getting them out on walks or runs, or a good game of fetch every evening really makes a difference. When my dogs get that energy out, it keeps them from having to act out.   And as far as age goes, two mellowed out a lot within four years, where as the other two (who are currently 6 and 8) still act as if theyre no more than a year or two.   Hopefully this is some help to you, and that your dog is able to calm down enough to be the fun you always expect from a lab!"
labrador,3aqup0,thequiginator,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:01:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thoughtful answer.   I think you've got a good point and I'll admit we probably haven't been a huge dominant force towards him.   We'll try to transfer the energy to something productive. Hopefully see some changes.
labrador,3aqup0,thequiginator,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:17:37 2015 UTC,"Of Course!  One thing that I really had to do with my male lab was make sure everytime we do something, he has a focused act to accompany it.  This could be something like each time he is going to go out/inside he has to sit.  Each time we come in the door, they have to sit down and leave a treat on the floor until we tell them they can have it.  This really helps them focus and lets them gain their composure.    Good luck!"
labrador,3aqup0,SneekyCarrot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about the dog's history?  It's possible if he came from a bad home he will need to learn to trust people (you) again.  It is also possible that the previous owners didn't put the time into training and socializing and looked to offload the result.  Something I did with my lab (11 months old now) is portion off some of her food for training purposes.  I carried the food around in my pocket when I was home and when she was doing something I liked (obeyed a command, laid on the floor quietly, wasn't being annoying, etc) I would praise her and give her some of the food.  I think I got a lot of mileage out of constantly reinforcing her good behavior.  When she was doing something I didn't like, I would ignore her and as soon as she stopped, I would give her some of the food.  It didn't take her too long to figure out what was getting her food and what wasn't.  Over time, I phased out the food for verbal praise and scratching.  I only used her dog food because I didn't want to flood her with extra calories since I was treating her so much and I didn't want to pay for extra treats either.  This is my first lab so it might have been a fluke but it worked really well for me."

labrador,3aj58l,TheMank,2,Sat Jun 20 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"He was absolutely obsessed with retrieving, and water. One day we stopped at a view spot on the north shore of Lake Superior. There is a low stone wall that separates the parking lot from a steep cliff down to the lake. He was leashed fortunately, because all he could see was the water as we approached the wall. He bolted like he was going to launch himself off the stone wall."

The vest isn't actually his cue for which he's in, as when he gets home with his vest on, he DGAF since he knows he's home, LOL. At home, you would think he's a normal everyday lab ... until he senses a troublesome change in my cardiovascular system. He's a cardiac alert dog, and no matter how crazy and playful he is at home, he's always ""on the job"" and can switch into alert mode on a dime.   All this is to say, service labs are still 100% uniquely lab, through and through. But they still manage to do their jobs and do them well.  :-)"

labrador,3a8loo,bummkugel,2,Thu Jun 18 14:04:54 2015 UTC,great dog! could you tell me what brand that backpack thing is? My gf has been looking for one for our dog for a while now.
labrador,3a8loo,szorg,2,Thu Jun 18 13:57:54 2015 UTC,The backpack came from amazon. He's wearing a size Large.  http://www.amazon.com/Kyjen-2490-Backpack-Removable-Saddlebag/dp/B0081XIEHE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1434644341&sr=1-1  The collapsible bowl also came from amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081XICJO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage  I think he's used the backpack 3 times now. At first he wasn't a fan and it slowed him down a lot. Which was kind of nice since he wasn't out in front pulling me a long the trails. But he's quickly gotten used to it and is back to his normal self when wearing it.  I keep a 1 liter bottle of water in each bag. Then as he uses the water i just keep the levels the same between the two bottles to keep the weight of each bag equal. If the weight is the same in both bags then they say centered with all of this movement.  So far i'm happy with the bag. Now he can carry his own water and snacks rather than me needing to carry both of our stuff.

labrador,3a3es4,Splifstar,6,Tue Jun 16 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"Google image search for canine acne.  Pretty sure that's what this is.  Can be caused by allergies but sometimes also just irritated hair follicles for whatever reason.  Wash 2x daily and apply a warm compress.  3% benzoyl peroxide solution (we just purchased at target in the acne aisle) applied and wiped clean should help.  Our vet also prescribed ""entederm ointment"".  It started clearing up in a few days and was completely healed within two to three weeks with no other outbreaks."

The vet said it could be allergies and make sure shes fed with stainless steel bowls. (which she is) If anyone has seen it or could offer any advice I would really appreciate it.
labrador,3a3es4,nitro149,3,Tue Jun 16 22:57:13 2015 UTC,My parents lab got this all the time. You're spot on with the stainless steel bowl. It needs to be cleaned (like fully washed with soap) daily. It's the bacteria from their slobber/ fur/anything that is building up on the bowl. Try this for a few weeks and make sure you wipe his mouth with a warm wet paper towel everyday/night to help keep it clean. Hopefully this helps your pup!
labrador,3a3es4,bottleofwhisky,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:46:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. I try and keep her bowl cleaned as often as possible but sometimes i do forget but ill put a note right next to her food reminding me to wash it everytime as well as her water bowl
labrador,3a3es4,awesomedave680,2,Wed Jun 17 04:32:19 2015 UTC,Along with the stainless steel bowls you should make sure she isn't drinking out of the toilet. When my lab gets pimples I use the Stridex pads for sensitive skin

labrador,39ks5j,kevint0717,5,Fri Jun 12 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"I also have a 7 month lab.   I would recommend waiting until 10 or even 12 weeks to get him/her. They learn bite inhibition in that time. Our pup spent a lot of time early on biting both me and my wife, where with a couple more weeks playing with their littermates they will begin to learn bite inhibition and know the difference between a play bite and a painful bite."
labrador,39ks5j,cowabunga9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:17:39 2015 UTC,We were also the first ones to take the puppy from the litter right at the 8 week mark so he was the first one pulled from his brothers and sisters.  I understood where he was coming from and why he was sad in the beginning.  I would also make sure that they get time with other puppies/dogs to help with their aggressive play.  We would take him to a puppy kindergarten once a week to get him acclimated with other dogs.  On walks around the neighborhood it was great to see the older dogs put him in his place when he got too aggressive.
labrador,39ks5j,cowabunga9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"I think the littermates will also likely be gone at 8 weeks, so if we don't pick him up he will probably only be there with his mother."

labrador,39bttv,Tall_Rassman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"I only have the one lab, but some relatives of mine have two goldens. It's certainly going to be at least twice as expensive - more if the new dog has health issues - but they report it's worth it for the additional love in your life. If you're intending to get dogs of opposite genders (or pets at all) be sure that they're neutered and spayed.   Also, it makes sense that the amount of work is not increased by a ton. A big part of pet ownership is exercising your buddies, and when you have two dogs you can just walk them at the same time. Slightly more difficult if you're throwing a ball, though."
labrador,39bttv,LordJackdaw,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:18:22 2015 UTC,"I have three labs. There is no simple answer, everything depends on their personality. Best thing would be to rescue, then try it out for a week or two. If there is a problem, you can return to the rescue to find another pup. There is no harm as not every dog is a perfect fit for your environment.  I rescued all mine at approx 6 months old."
labrador,39bttv,ctrl-brk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"There are so many variables, that it's really tough to give you solid advice.  First, there's the expense...which in itself is a huge variable.  With two dogs, you now have double the vet and grooming costs (and boarding, if you go somewhere).  Then there's the personality issues.  We've had a male and female from the same breeder, but different litters that really didn't get along all that spectacularly.  They weren't hostile to each other, but their relationship probably wouldn't meet the level harmony that you may expect.    Our experience is that adding a second dog to a family dynamic doesn't necessarily make the first dog's life better.   Having said all of this, if you really want two labs, then just get them.  You'll learn how to make whatever adjustments that you need to make the situation work.  It's prudent to seek other people's opinions, as you've done here.  But really, you need to do what you want."

labrador,396rkm,RubenGamez,3,Tue Jun 9 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"How did you teach this? My lab is 5 months and he doesn't believe in ""leaving"" it."
labrador,396rkm,Thrice395,17,Tue Jun 9 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"I went to a puppy training class, where to teach leave it they started with first putting a bit of food in your hand, keeping it clenched but not give it to him when he's licking your hand etc and saying leave it, then when he stops trying, open your hand and give it to him.  Then just worked up from there putting his food on the floor/on him and telling him to leave it, if he tried to eat it before the go command, I'd cover it up with my hand/foot and say no. He's pretty much got it now, if something drops or you put his food down he'll leave it until you tell him to, apart from when he finds cat poo in the garden, then he goes deaf o_o"
labrador,396rkm,nockle,8,Tue Jun 9 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"Seriously, what's up with labs and cat poo...  Mine is very good with leaving food (I even got her to drop a chicken bone) but cat poo is just too good..."

labrador,396rkm,Thrice395,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:47:04 2015 UTC,Would you recommend one of those classes? I've seen them at Petsmart but I don't know if they're worth the money.
labrador,396rkm,call_me_Kote,2,Tue Jun 9 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"It was £50 for five classes with a local dog trainer, it didn't really teach anything we hadn't already started learning tbh, it was sit/come/down/stay/heel and leave it, but I would recommend it as it was really good for socialising him with other dogs and learning to listen to command with lots of distractions around, rather then just in the kitchen at home."
labrador,396rkm,SwtSthrnBelle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"Bingo. As far as training goes and how to go about it, useless. As far as getting her to train around other dogs and listen in exciting places it was valuable. The cheapest class in my area was like $150 though, so at £50 that sounds like a steal."

labrador,398fyc,bremelanotide,2,Wed Jun 10 00:39:58 2015 UTC,"Sea Isle isn't technically dog friendly, but it was like 55 degrees and school was still in session so it was pretty much a ghost town.

They've gone to school for a very long time and they know what they are doing.  As for cost - it'll like be a bit of money for the surgery.  If that will be an issue, talk with your vet.  Many offer payment plans and there are even companies out there that will help finance the payment (with interest obviously).  There will be rehab, talk with the vet about exercises you can do with your puppy.  Most importantly, talk with your vet about what is appropriate activity for your dog going forward.  With my first dog, I didn't really know about not jumping off of high objects.  There is a big rock at the park I go to and I trained my first lab to jump up and down.  It's probably 3-4 feet high.  This was likely too high for him at a young age and probably didn't help his elbow dysplasia.  I find swimming is a great exercise for labs.  They love it and there's little stress on their joints.  Great for a rehabbing puppy as well."
labrador,38p6nf,craig5005,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear about Zelda :( 8 months is pretty young for an injury like this.   One of my boys tore both ACLs when he was younger (~1.5 years old for the first one and the next tore a year later). For the first one we went with an ex-cap surgery which initially healed quickly, but ended up being nightmarish in the end. For his second one we went with a TPLO surgery which has worked well for him so far.   I'm not a veterinarian or anything even remotely close to one, but I imagine that the best treatment for your dog really just depends on the size/activity level/age. I'm really sorry again you both have to go through this.

His front legs and chest were almost normal but his hind legs were blocked by the wall he was sleeping against. It took him a minute of struggling before he gave up. I walked over, rubbed his belly, and rolled him the other way. I hope I explained that properly.  TL;DR My yellow does this but even dumber/derpier."

labrador,38ixxh,DuhTabby,2,Mon Jun 8 02:16:35 2015 UTC,She barked at the topwater bait I was throwing at first light and then slipped off the stern and went swimming. Very typical lab things. She'll be back out with me next weekend

labrador,38fbqc,Skoges,2,Wed Jun 3 20:59:24 2015 UTC,Awww!! What did she do?
labrador,38fbqc,SwtSthrnBelle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"Ate the couch cushions and tore out the foam padding while I was out. As soon as I walked in, I saw the mess, and had to go retrieve her from behind the curtins before ahe would come out."
labrador,38fbqc,SwtSthrnBelle,2,Thu Jun 4 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Woooow. My mom & I got stupidly lucky, Otter will ONLY destroy his beds when left out of his crate. He's never tried to eat any furniture or any part of the house.   But at 3 1/2 he's gone through probably 2 dozen beds/bed covers. And he's still in his crate during the day."
labrador,38g8kk,butidontthink,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"Call a vet about costs of - full round of vaccinations for year 1, then ask about ongoing schedule (rabies, parvo, kennel cough) - annual exam - spay/neuter (if you get a rescue, they usually come fixed and with most shots)  Go to a pet store and price out some food.  Look at the back of the bag to get an idea of how much food they get per day.  Depending on activity level, that could be between 3 and 4 cups per day.  From there you could figure out how much food (and how many bags) they will go through a year.  Go to the treat aisle and assume 1 bag of treats per month (depending on size).  Get the cost of 1 collar, 1 lead, some toys, water bowl, dog bed (will likely go through a few through the dogs life).  Consider the chance of accidents or injuries and plan for an extra couple hundred dollars per year.  Dogs aren't cheap, but they are worth it."
labrador,38g8kk,craig5005,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"Contact local vets and ask them for a rough breakdown of cost for yearly checkups & shots. And don't be shy about asking lots of questions. Having a good vet and one you like is super important. As well as someone who will listen to your concerns.  You're going to spend at least 100/month for food. Depending on the age of your dog you're going to go through toys & beds more often. The bigger the dog, the more expensive the bed & toys to compensate for their chewing.   Obedience training. You'll need some, and it's gonna cost. Price out local smaller training schools and then try the big chains. I paid 100-150/per round of class (we did agility though so it was a little more) at a local training school.  I got more out of it than at any petsmart.  You'll also need to know how much it is to board/daycare, sometimes shit happens & you need to go out of town & can't take them. I recommend keeping this total stashed away so you can at the drop of a hat if necessary.  Also, factor in and keep on hand somewhere close to $500 reserved to the side for unexpected vet visits. X-rays for a dog can cost upwards of $300. And that's before they charge for the vet's time and any drugs they prescribe. With labs, I'd replenish this fund as soon as it's depleted. Because caring for a lab has been akin to being on suicide watch 24/7. I love my lab, but he is sometimes a blithering idiot.   Dog ownership is amazing, but in addition to cost, you'll need to make sure you have the time to spend! Labs love being around their owners, and want lots of playtime and downtime in addition to walks!"

labrador,38bfre,city_farm_girl,3,Wed Jun 3 03:17:06 2015 UTC,It's a dog's life. Chewing on a tennis ball. Laying in freshly cut grass. Pure bliss.
labrador,38bfre,the_seed,2,Wed Jun 3 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"Some days, I'm jealous of how good my dogs have it. I wish I could find as much joy in something so simple as a stick or anything squeaky."
labrador,38bfre,crlast86,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:43:40 2015 UTC,Sounds familiar. Our house gets strewn with bits of eviscerated tennis balls that have to be picked up by hand or they make an awful noise being picked up by the vacuum.
labrador,38b7y1,SirWebster,6,Wed Jun 3 02:20:15 2015 UTC,No human will ever be as happy as a labrador at the dog park.

labrador,389zvc,violinita,6,Tue Jun 2 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I lost my black lab a little over a month ago and it still feels like there's this big hole in my heart. Time makes it a little easier (at least easier to not cry at the drop of a hat) but remember that your puppy will be with you forever. This community was so kind to me when I lost my girl, and it really helped me. I hope it helps you too."
labrador,389zvc,puffinprincess,2,Tue Jun 2 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"It seems their whole world is to make us happy. When the time is right for your family, go rescue/adopt another lab in need of a home. You save them, but in the end, they save us."
labrador,389zvc,ctrl-brk,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:36:13 2015 UTC,People say time helps... but years later I still can't look at pictures of my dog that passed away.
labrador,389zvc,lordnecro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it really helps in that regard. Time just helps make the pain less...immediate I guess. It's still there, and it still hurts, but it isn't the first/only thing on your mind so it only really hurts when you ""poke"" at it (look at pictures, remember things, see a similar looking dog)."
labrador,389zvc,puffinprincess,3,Wed Jun 3 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'm so grateful for your kind comments. I never knew it would be this hard to let my boy go. He was my first dog. Watching him be out to sleep was tough. Thanks,  you guys, good to know I'm not alone."
labrador,389zvc,DougSR,3,Wed Jun 3 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah! We were there last month with my old girl. Here's our final moments together. She was the face of Texas Lab Rescue. I'm still having moments of watery eyes and sniffles. Every time I have fond memories and think I'm over mourning, I see something that just cracks me all over again. Best wishes and stay strong."
