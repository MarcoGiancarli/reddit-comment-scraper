I'm sorry but gays can get married it's the law of the land now.  And no we are not going to make a special discrimination clause that says discrimination is illegal unless your a Christian and discriminating against gays. We are not going to accept separate but equal weddings or anything else for that matter.   We as a country don't have time for this shit anymore. There are real issues in the world that we should be discussing like how the TPP will give large companies and banks unbelievable leverage over countries trade and domestic policies that could effect their profits including the US.   Or how a significant portion of us make a living driving a vehicle in one form or another which will become an automated process over the next 15 years or so.   Or how the drought in California is not going to get better and that over the next generation we will need to develope a new water infrastructure for the entire south west if we want to keep that land a viable place to live.   Or how our current drug policies have more or less created the issues we see in Mexico,  South America, and Afghanistan. Not to mention the fact that these policies combined with the privatization of prisons creating a profit motive for locking people up has led to the US having the world's highest incarceration rate ruining the lives of people who really just needed a little help and compassion.   The only candidate even bringing up these types of real issues is Bernie Sanders. The Republican party is supplying the usual nonsense about the gays, abortions, and of course the Muslim terrorists coming across the border with the Mexican rapists who are taking all the jobs. Meanwhile the best the dems can put forward is Hilary who is unable to talk about anything of substance and falls back on talking points for every question. I hope Bernie wins because frankly we can't keep wasting our time with the stuff the establishment candidates are taking about any more."

He said literally, that God was going to turn my life inside out. In response, I made the point that if God made a point of smiting non-believers, it was a pretty long list. If there was any evidence of it, I would know about it by now.   All the same, it was with some trepidation that I ventured out into the severe thunderstorm after work."
