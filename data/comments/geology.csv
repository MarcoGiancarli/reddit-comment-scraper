Trust me if you have sedimentology as a required course then you will need it and it will make your life much when doing soil identification.     Sedimentology made the geotechnical engineering design course much easier to go through because we had the full soil knowledge, so we'd get a soil and the environment and be able to make assumptions about it's properties and how to build on it.  The civil's without that background had a harder time with the estimations and environmental assumptions.   As someone who has completed Geological Engineering, this is what I discovered."

It's also important to note for your purposes that the vast majority of sedimentary rocks do not contain large visible fossils in any meaningful way.   For what you want to do by far your best bet is to search for known fossil hunting sites in your area.  It's most likely to be in an area of limestone exposure. If you give us your location we can probably even take a look and give you some suggestions. Even then it is well worth going along with someone who knows what they're doing - if you don't know what you're looking for then the chances are you will walk right by even really good examples.

Some strongly magnetic (ferromagnetic) minerals I know of are Pyrrhotite, Maghemite and Cubanite. Magnetite is also strongly attracted to a magnet, it was thought to be ferromagnetic but it's actually ferrimagnetic.  Edit: Here's a two more magnetic minerals, Smythite (a highly magnetic monoclinic form of pentlandite) and Batiferrite   (a very rare strongly ferromagnetic mineral).

geology,3du789,Mfluffyk,3,Sun Jul 19 15:24:01 2015 UTC,I'm tentatively with you. We need to do an acid test and probably smash it with a rock hammer to see if the fracture patterns look right and it's silicious though.

geology,3du789,jalza,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:05 2015 UTC,Dug it up from my backyard woods in SE Michigan.
geology,3du789,Deldenary,3,Sun Jul 19 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"I intitally questioned myself, but that's my best guess: amygdule basalt.  The lumps seem to be either a separate mineral or the eroded matrix surrounding a separate mineral. Whatever the mineral may be (probably quartz), it seems to be eroding away at a slower rate than the basalt."
geology,3du789,Sappert,4,Sun Jul 19 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"it's some kind of weathered mafic volcanic rock, the roundness of the inclusions suggests that they are amygdules, which form from gas bubbles when a lave with high gas content cools and are later filled in with a mineral. In this case it looks like quartz. The amygdules are resistant to the weathering which is why they are sticking out of the rock. here is a not so weathered sample it was probably transported and deposited where you found it by a glacier"
geology,3du789,Deldenary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:36 2015 UTC,Aren't those amygdules usually less resistant to weathering than the matrix?
geology,3du789,Mfluffyk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:00:48 2015 UTC,"depends what they are made of, quartz is more resistant to weathering than basaltic rock"
geology,3du789,Deldenary,0,Mon Jul 20 11:04:16 2015 UTC,It doesn't look like the features you are calling amygdules are more ore less resistant to weathering.  Judging from the cross section the small lumps sticking out of the rock seem to be mostly made up of the darker portion.  I think we should go with the most likely explanation here:  chert.
geology,3du789,Mfluffyk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:53 2015 UTC,there can be one that one kind of mineral in amygdules. on another note the one lump sticking out that is cross cut has an amygdule in it. the matrix does not in the least look like chert.
geology,3du789,Mfluffyk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:59 2015 UTC,I think the matrix looks exactly like chert.  Here is a sample from my own collection that OP's picture reminded me of.  Irregularly shaped chert nodule in limestone:  http://imgur.com/p4RgJ2G

Around Lake Chabot you can encounter a couple different Great Valley Group units: The Joaquin Miller and Knoxville formations which are shales and sandstones of Jurassic age. You may also encounter parts of the Leona Rhyolite which has been hydrothermally altered/mineralized in some places. There are also small areas of Franciscan Complex melange and Coast Range Ophiolite Gabbro on published maps of the area.  Really without a better picture of the rock or location it is hard to say which of those it is.

geology,3dneyj,PeaceLoveHerb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:47:37 2015 UTC,"Pyrite crystals have a tendency, due to the isometric arrangement of the atoms packing during growth, to grow in patterns exhibiting cubic cleavage.  However, they come in a variety of habits due to environmental conditions and are much more often found like this. I would guess this is pyrite too. Portions seem weathered to a rainbow color which pyrite can exhibit and it also appears your sample has some dullish brown which is likely oxidized iron.  Edit: (add on)  gold is very dense and thus fairly heavy, surprisingly heavy. It also doesn't lose its brilliance or color through weathering if it is pure. If this isn't pyrite it's probably oxidized slag. The rainbow could be from other metals, zinc or nickel?, which react this way to heat. Very likely you have a chunk of iron mixed with zinc and/or nickel."

The little veins running through it lead me to say natural but I honestly can't say for certain just through an image due to how easy it is to make some artificial stones and slabs these days.  That said, does it serve the purpose that you wanted it to? It sounds to me like you may just be unhappy with the rock you have now. Was it worth the trade and is that why you are analyzing it, or is your fear that it is an illegitimate rock? Also, would it being real or not affect how useful it is at looking nice wherever you place it?"

I was going to use the red stone, which I found digging in the yard, to add a seat on a 150+ year old limestone foundation wall in my back yard - so needless to say, it's going to look a bit out of place. But mostly I fear that the red stone was worth more to him than what he traded me for, and that he took advantage of my ignorance.

Some of the approach images hinted that it's part of a much larger network of canyons (or chasma in astrogeological parlance) that rotated out of view before closest approach. The long ridges running across the center may also be canyons, but since the lighting isn't as good, we'll need some stereo images to figure out how deep they are. Some high-resolution images of at least part of one of those canyons should be getting downlinked in a couple hours, might see an image release for them tomorrow.  Wouldn't be the first giant canyon that we've found in the outer Solar System. Messina Chasma on Uranus's moon Titania has a scarp that's 5 mi (8 km) high."

(Similar to a continent-continent collision on earth-->Himalayas?)   Edit: at second glance, the ridge line across the middle looks to have pulled apart (close the the middle of it there is a piece that looks like a jigsaw that can match its top piece), so a spreading could have ensued?"

Here's an earlier, lower-res, New Horizons image with a sub-figure providing info about lat/lon. I think most planetary scientists' expectations are that the darkness is related to some atmosphere/sublimation effect, and not volcanic activity -- although we really don't know now.  That sharp transition between the north and low-latitude regions is interesting. While the lower latitudes look smoother (which makes me think younger), I also see more craters further south (which suggests older), although maybe that's a bias due to lighting differences.  Then there's that boundary between, which consists of long E-W troughs/ridges (possibly related to that giant ""canyon"" at the 2 o'clock position). Some regions look like the've been pulled apart (near the center of the disk). I find it interesting that they trend E-W ... it may signify some global stress pattern. Perhaps de-spinning.

Still baffled what could cause a spreading effect of that size on such a small and cold world.  Also, I'm seeing quite a few central peaks in the craters, which strikes me as weird, because as a general rule of thumb, you should see less central peaks as gravity lessens.

It really looks as though it was rounded over by a glacier before the rock was perched on top. It seems like a really odd geometry for freeze/thaw processes."
geology,3ddrlg,OrbitalPete,4,Wed Jul 15 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"The contact between the dropstone and the bedrock is  easily accessed by surface water, so it is preferentially eroded like any weakness. By the very nature of that the rock will be left balancing on a smaller area. It's not necessarily freeze thaw."
geology,3ddrlg,GeoWheel,3,Wed Jul 15 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"I see that the contact would be a plane of weakness for water to seep along, but I would expect weathering to proceed along foliation planes in the lower rock as it apparently has in the upper rock. Moreover, the lower rock shows a pretty strong resemblance to a whaleback, along with potential striations shown in photos on the original page. Even if those are foliations or water staining, that's a phenominal amount of material to erode over somewhere between 10 or 15 ky. I know this abstract is from '95, but 10Be is still a super relevant method for investigating erosion rates."

Over time, the rocks tend to become rounded.  There are a number of mechanism, the most obvious being that corners and edges will be subject to greater erosion than faces. An important one in cases like this is due to the way the compressive forces spread through the rock, over time thin layers are exfoliated from the bottom of the rock until it too becomes rounded. Read up on exfoliation and spheroidal weathering for more information."

geology,3ddrlg,allaroundguy,6,Wed Jul 15 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, seeing as there are quite a few similar cases worldwide, I suspect it's not pure luck. There's probably some kind of feedback effect when the ice is melting, causing the rock to move around a bit while the ice melts, and for some reason I can't figure out right now, it apparently melts in a way that causes to rock to slip into the 'sweet spot'. Something about the upper rock pivoting around on the lower rock resulting in changes in pressure on the surrounding ice, etc.  Anyone know how this works?  Edit: a block of rock suspended in melting ice will orient itself into its most stable position, won't it? Also, differences in heat conductivity will cause the tip of the lower rock to protrude from the ice first. Would this cause the upper rock to automatically settle into a relatively stable position on top of the lower one? Of course not each case will result in perfect balance, but it would increase the chances of something like this happening, right?"
geology,3ddrlg,rapax,11,Wed Jul 15 14:58:04 2015 UTC,The dropped rock simply shelters the bedrock below from erosion. You end up with it standing on a promontory.

geology,3ddrlg,MrZalbaag,2,Wed Jul 15 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"You might be onto something. Remember though, huge sections of the northern hemisphere have been covered by ice at various times, and the rock on top would've been in roughly the right place before the lower rock was exposed - a melting glacier won't have much force behind its movements. I think you have a good point, but there's still a lot of luck involved."

You balance a broomstick (or any other long stick-ish object) on your two outstretched index fingers, at any seperation. Now you slowly move your hands together. your fingers will eventually meet and the broomstick is perfectly balanced. The mechanism is quite easy to understand, in the near-1D case of the broomstick: at any time, the finger which is further from the broomsticks center of gravity is experiencing less pressure from the broomstick than the other, causing the friction to be greater. Hence, the finger moves, until the roles are reversed. This goes back and forth until the fingers meet under the broomsticks center of gravity.  I suspect, but obviously can't prove, that a similar mechanism is at work here, with the bottom rock acting as one 'finger'."

geology,3dfb0w,Sappert,2,Wed Jul 15 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"Planetary surface ages are almost always estimated as a function of crater counting. On a completely inactive surface, such as the Moon, crater counting is relatively accurate way of estimating age. It was expected that Pluto would be significantly cratered which would mean that its surface was inactive (i.e. couldn't resurface over impact craters, such as is done here on Earth). The mountain ranges and lack of craters both point to the surface being very young. I believe the 100 million year age is just a rough guess.  Edit: another important facet is that the apparent flux of meteorites is vastly different in the kuipier belt compared to the inner solar system. This surface could be billions of years old but still relatively uncratered. We have no way of estimating meteorite flux as we don't have the data or observations. The only real way to know is by sample analysis, good old hard rock geology."
geology,3dfb0w,MoneyForPeople,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't take the 100 million year age as gospel. It's extremely tricky to attach a numerical age to a region based on the number of craters alone. You need a good statistical model of the small body population/cratering rate to do that, and in this region of the Solar System we don't have a good handle on either.  That said, given an extreme lack of craters, this region must certainly be young. 100 million years is a good ballpark figure for now, but it could easily go half an order of magnitude either way."

Still, let me dust off ye olde photo interpretation skills...  To start with we have at least three distinct units, probably more depending on how finely you want to split it.  It definitely looks like the high-albedo blotch is overlaying both the low-albedo stuff at the bottom and medium-albedo stuff forming most of the upper half of the planet, so, that gives us a start to superposition.  In the left half of the image right at the boundary between low and mid albedo, there's some kinda interfingering between the two in a north-south direction; hard to tell but that might be some sort of topographic feature.  If the planet shrank from cooling, you would tend to get north-south trending faults and scarps near the equator, so that might be something like that.  I'm just gonna make a wild-ass guess now; it's so smooth and it's atop everything else, the high-albedo stuff is probably frozen out atmosphere.  Either that or some kind of dust sheet maybe.  Or maybe a recent cryovolcanic flow!  Honestly I can't tell, and I have no idea why frozen out atmosphere would be where it is, but I don't see any craters in it and not much in the way of other features.  But we're also seeing it head-on which tends to make it hard to see any topography that might be there.  The sun angle also looks like it's basically head-on in the image; I'm not really sure what to make of that since Pluto is so far away I don't think the sun actually sheds much more light than starlight.  Have to figure out how much illumination it actually provides.    In fact, just eyeballing the crater counts, the mid-albedo formations are definitely the oldest.  I think I'd also divided it into two formations, the one at sort of the mid latitudes, and the slightly darker and less heavily-cratered one at the north pole (if I am remembering the planet's orientation right).  Hard to tell much else about them though.  What else... There's a fair number of craters but no really obvious volcanoes.  There's a very young-looking large impact crater on the center left side, right at the boundary between low and mid albedo formations, which I'd love to get a closer look at, but there's no obvious crater rays.  There's also what looks like a large north-south trending scarp on the right side at about the same latitude.  That's about all I can see from that one image though.  I look forward to more!"
geology,3d90fo,icefoxen,2,Tue Jul 14 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"Wow 10/10 for effort.  We can probably go with a broad guess of light = ice rich and dark = silicate rich.   The high albedo ""heart"" looks like an elliptical impact crater infilled with bright material with a bright ejecta blanket extending to the right. If this is correct then it's really bizarre that ejecta is only present on one side. I'm not an expert on impacts but I wonder if an impact at a very low angle could produce this? If it is impact related then the bright feature right at the bottom of the image could be another large impact. The material looks very fresh, I was wondering if we have any idea what the impact rate for asteroids is in this part of the solar system?  If you ignore the bright heart then there's quite a nice planetary dichotomy (slipping into Mars geology again) between bright material in the north and dark in the south. To me the craters in the dark material look much sharper and while there are many indistinct craters in the brighter north they appear softened and much lower relief. This suggests terrain softening in an icy rich material. Why would ice be preferentially concentrated in one hemisphere? I have no idea but a guess might be some sort of influence of Charon and the other moons. I would love to see evidence of cryovolcanism but I'm not sure how likely it is to be occurring on such a small body though ice certainly isn't distributed evenly.   I think we can start to interpret about volcanism and faulting when we start getting the high resolution images, which I think starts tomorrow."

geology,3d9lfd,fraoch41,0,Tue Jul 14 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Is this something someone has asked you to do? Because those classifications aren't necessarily very useful in that environment. Pahoehoe and a'a are surface textural descriptions, and they were coined on the Hawaiian islands. They're not universally applicable.  You're far better off just describing textures, thicknesses, any flow lineations and directions, etc. Also, it's really important to remember that lava structures change as you move away from the vent; it's entirely possible to have a continuous layer of lava that starts off as agglutinate/spatter rampart, migrating to thin pahoehoe type flows, before thickening up into a'a textures. Finally, your four photos show a range of different lava textures - it's not immediately obvious which you're referring to."
geology,3d9lfd,OrbitalPete,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm mapping on the Isle of Mull,  trying to differentiate between the different lava facies in the area.

geology,3d9lfd,OrbitalPete,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Don't get caught up in a'a and pahoehoe. Describe thicknesses, grainsize, bulk texture. Is it blocky? Does it have a rubbly base or top? Is there any flow lineation in crystal charges? If you've got spatter ramparts then try to identify the fissure location that fed it. If you can get flow directions work out the source direction. And never forget that lava flows go downhill. :)"

If you'd like to do more serious research, I'd suggest pursuing a Masters (2 years) or PhD (generally 5 years coming straight from a BS). Graduate degrees open up more opportunities for research and higher level positions.   Other thoughts: don't worry about everyone being younger or more ""into"" geology than you. I know several really solid geologists who came in from unrelated careers around your age. It just takes a bit of time and practice before you get the hang of it. If you decide to go back and get a BS, I'd strongly suggest asking to assist on a professor's research project. This will help show you how modern geology is practiced and can help you figure out how much you enjoy doing research work.   Good luck! It really is an amazing field, and hope you can get into it."

Higher res images are obtained by stitching, obviously.   The other camera is LORRI's friend Ralph, which has a color sensor (actually two on top of each other) that can deliver 0.64 MP images. Its effective resolution is actually higher than LORRI because Ralph has a 10x telescopic lens. Ralph also has an infrared sensor that delivers 256x256 pixels arrays.  If you search, you'll see that there are already color images out."

There is no problem handling it with your bare hands unless it is flaking (Galena is brittle) and leaving a dust behind on your hands, which I would just play it safe by washing your hands afterwards.   The galena samples I just found are extremely flaky and leaving behind a lot of lead dust on my hands because I found them splitting rocks while out rock-hounding. So just to be safe I wash my hands afterwards. Not too much to worry about though!"
geology,3cz839,stenten2,8,Sun Jul 12 03:08:12 2015 UTC,The pyrite is going to be far more susceptible to being broken down or dissolved than the shale around it (silicate minerals are typically very hard and insoluble relative to sulfides). You're best (and probably only) bet is going to be mechanical removal of the shale (grinding / chipping / cutting / polishing).
geology,3cz839,phyllotaxis,4,Sun Jul 12 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, the shale should be pretty soft and pretty much any liquid solution will dissolve or damage pyrite. If you have a saw maybe cut a square around the crystal so there's only a minimal amount of shale left to remove and then gently chip and brush the rest away. Make sure you keep pyrite crystals in a very dry environment as well."
geology,3cz839,STINKO_DE_MAYO,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:17:52 2015 UTC,Shale is more easily mechanically weathered. What about high pressure water?
geology,3cz839,chucksutherland,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"When preparing my palynological samples, I use HCl followed by HF digestions. These processes tend to keep microscopic pieces of pyrite within the sample residue, which is then removed with concentrated nitric acid.   I'm not sure if it would scale up for nodules, but it might be worth giving it a go. The HF may very well be enough to remove the mineral matrix and let you get at the pyrite nodule easier.   Now, HF is nasty, and if you can't get access to a lab which uses HF, maybe try another non-oxidating acid?"
geology,3cz839,squatly,8,Sun Jul 12 11:50:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for stating that HF is nasty. HF is one of the most dangerous acids to use and is the last resort. It should never be attempted by a novice.

The light will most likely be water-ice, while the dark I would hypothesize to be some kind of silica-hydrocarbon slush mix.  With an object the size of Pluto, there may be some residual heating due to accretion and radioactive decay.  We know the gravitational system of Pluto is complex, with multiple 'moons', leading to gravitational stresses that could produce more frictional heating.    Its not every day we get to discover and explore an entirely new planetary body.  I'm so excited for the science to come out of this!!!"

There are small lobate scarps that have been estimated to be quite recent  Mars is geologically active.  Some guesses put the youngest lava flow on Olympus Mons at 100 million years old, which is really recent for Mars.  Plus its inclination is so wobbly its ice caps must move around a fair amount on the timescale of a few million years.  I could go on nit-picking, but...  that's pretty much what it would be.

At the rate we consume it, there is effectively a fixed amount of oil on earth. Therefore, assuming we continue to use it in some capacity, yes, out would eventually run out. From an economic standpoint though, that won't happen, because as supply declines, unless demand reduces at an equal rate, the price will rise. As price rises, people start to look for alternatives, they stop or reduce their consumption of it, or the producers begin to explore other resources as it then becomes profitable.   When you follow this line of thinking to its logical conclusion, unless outside influences force markets to deviate from following supply and demand, eventually we will cease to use it on our own accord. It will become too expensive for regular consumption and alternatives will take over.  Maybe not the answer you were looking for, but I chose to read between the lines a little bit."
geology,3ctn5y,PeopleHateThisGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. You gave me a lot to reflect upon :D  I would just like to go over your points though.  How do we know there is a fixed amount of oil on earth?  Many claim that oil is a non-renewable source of energy that originates from fossilized matter but what if oil is in fact, a renewable source of energy?  How do we know for certain?  Nonetheless, one may argue that we should aspire to utilize other sources of energy that are much more efficient, and ""clean"".   What are your thoughts on these questions?"

geology,3ctn5y,chipuha,3,Sat Jul 11 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"How do we know there is a fixed amount of oil on earth?   Simply put, oil is generated from rocks bearing organic material at a certain temperature range.  There is only so many units that fit those two requirements in the world.   Many claim that oil as a non-renewable source of energy that originates from fossilized matter but what if oil is in fact, a renewable source of energy?   ""Renewable"" depends on your time scale just like /u/twinnedcalcite mentioned.  Oil is totally renewable as long as organic matter is being buried.  However, it takes millions of years for the organic matter being buried now to get deep enough for oil generation.  Like /u/PeopleHateThisGuy mentioned, at the rate we're consuming oil any generation in the next 100 years is probably negligible.   How do we know for certain?   One of the great things about studying geology is that it is so young compared to other sciences and there is so much to discover.  Plus, there is the added challenge of not really being able to observe undisturbed conditions in the earth.  But, hydrocarbon generation has been studied since the 50's by people much smarter than me.  Edit: Another thing I might add to /u/PeopleHateThisGuy's response is technology.  It's just another layer of complexity. While the price will go up as supply declines technology will help dampen that decline.  I believe we will see expensive oil - a tech break through that helps drive the price down with added supply - expensive oil - etc.  However, eventually it's just going to cost too much to extract compared to other sources of energy."
geology,3ctn5y,FossilGal,3,Fri Jul 10 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"The original Peak Oil model was based on conventional petroleum resources. The production of the tar sands in Alberta and the adoption of hydraulic fracturing to open oil fields previously considered to be played out has changed all that. There are enormous reserves of unconventional hydrocarbons, including shale oil and shale gas. In fact, the biggest environmental impact of cracking is not about groundwater contamination or induced earthquakes, but the reality that fracking has made low cost hydrocarbons a part of our energy future for many decades more than would have been the case without it, and has pushed the adoption of a mostly renewable energy portfolio that much farther into the future."

geology,3cmlix,jonny_jump_up,14,Thu Jul 9 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. From what you've said I would say no, not desiccation cracks. The bedding is all wrong (if there even is bedding), desiccation cracks typically don't form such square shapes. The cracks should also be filled in with some sort of sediment, not just left open - there is rarely negative space in the subsurface.   No, I would go out on a limb and suggest that this rock is a basic igneous rock and the pattern that you are seeing may be from rapid cooling, causing contraction and cracking. My evidence for this is that you've said the sample is hard (like basalt) and so its also probably pretty heavy as well, indicating a basic igneous rock. There are also flecks of white which may be some larger feldspar minerals which are commonly larger than the matrix which is usually made up of pyroxenes and amphiboles.  I would first try to identify if the rock is igneous (this is hard on a fine grained rock I know). Look at the white flecks and try to identify a crystalline shape - they should be lath shaped with reasonably square sides. Furthermore, to test if these patterns are in fact caused by rapid cooling the cracked surfaces should be finer grained than the rest of the rock. Good luck!"

geology,3cmlix,FossilGal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"The rapid cooling was also a thought that I had, as this was found in Iceland, so igneous made sense.

Obviously I know nothing about geology."
geology,3cmlix,mjackl,18,Thu Jul 9 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"Mud cracks form parallel to bedding. This pebble has the cracking on two intersecting surfaces. These are also a very weird shape for mud cracks, which tend to the hexagonal. When you see mud cracks in a sedimentary rock, the cracks have been filled in by later-deposited sediment.  This is what preserved mud cracks typically look like. So, no, not mud cracks."
geology,3cmlix,Incomprehensibilitea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"Seems that smaller mud cracks could form on the side of a larger mud crack. I imagine a much thicker and deeper mudcrack could form, then the rock could be re-moisturised, and then dried out again, forming the typical mud crack pattern on the exposed side of the block.  On the other hand, I'm a structural geologist, so what do I know..."

geology,3cmlix,Sappert,15,Thu Jul 9 11:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, I gotchu bud.  This was likely around or at the bottom of a lake and this form of rock leaves these signature crack patterns when the water later evaporates.  By the color, composition, and signature crack patterns, it's clay.    The mechanism for clay deposition is incredibly slow; this stuff probably was slowly moved by erosion to the bottom of a lake that later evaporated.  This makes sense as glacial run-off is the exact type of erosion that would bring a clay deposit into the bottom of a valley that would later dry up and leave these rocks around.    Desiccation cracks! Thank you SchrodingersRapist for stating that; it was bothering me that I could not think of the name.  Uhm.  I feel weird thanking  you...."
geology,3cmlix,FossilGal,10,Thu Jul 9 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but these do not look like mud cracks to me. Especially weird is that they occur on two different sides of the rock.

geology,3cmlix,kawaiiju,3,Fri Jul 10 04:02:30 2015 UTC,"Just because a rock is found in a glacial valley does not mean it was originally formed in that valley. If sediment were deposited in a glacial run-off lake, it would not lithify until the sediment was deeply buried, compacted and cemented. A geologist would not see it until all the rock on top had eroded off, and that means the glacial valley would be long gone. Sedimentary rocks don't form from sediment drying up."

Sure.   6 - I'd guess azurite and malachite too  7 - conglomerate. ""porphyritic"" refers to an igneous texture, which is not what we see here.  8 - It's in a cave and hangs from the ceiling, so it's a stalactite of some sort. Based on the sort of flaky texture, I'd guess gypsum but that's just a guess.   9 - Not an angular unconformity; riverine(?) cross bedding. Any sort of 'unconformity' must represent a gap in time - this was a continuously deposited sequence, although the depositional environment changed to show cross bedding.   10 - meandering river with yes, an oxbow lake."
geology,3cpzrw,PineHand,2,Fri Jul 10 00:04:53 2015 UTC,Definitely Malachite and Azurite or slight variation of things in that group
geology,3cpzrw,IonOrchid1,2,Fri Jul 10 00:52:06 2015 UTC,Yep 3 is definitely a sedimentary structure
geology,3cpzrw,Sappert,2,Fri Jul 10 10:03:07 2015 UTC,Take another look at 8. Look at the shape of the rock bits. It's not illustrating an igneous feature.
geology,3cpzrw,FossilGal,2,Thu Jul 9 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on these photos:  Normal fault- There are definitely fractures here, but it doesn't look like there's any clear offset. I think these are joints. Ripple patterns- Definitely ripple marks. how do you know they're form wind? water ripples are more likely to be preserved. Angluar unconformity-  ""Porporitic""- This is a conglomerate, not porphyritic texture, If that's what you mean. Porphyritic texture is a result of magma that has cooled slowly enough for significant crystals to grow. plenty of google images to give you examples here. Angular unconformity- These are cross beds, and I don't think that's what most people mean of when they say angular unconformity. On a larger scale, an angular unconformity involves the deposition of bedding, uplift/tilting of bedding, erosion, and then deposition of more sediments."
geology,3cpzrw,GeoWheel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:59:39 2015 UTC,Just wondering why you say water ripples are more likely to be preserved?
geology,3cpzrw,caithaha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"My impression is: water-formed ripples are more likely to have sediment deposited on top of them to preserve them. In areas where sand is exposed to air and is unconsolidated, that sand is probably going to be transported somewhere else."
geology,3cpzrw,GeoWheel,2,Tue Jul 14 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"So I would argue its just as likely to occur in either environment.  In order for ripples of any kind to be preserved, an influx of sediment from somewhere is required. And this really goes without saying, and I'm only mentioning it for completeness of my own thoughts, but if there is no increased sediment load - in either type of environment - then all you have are migrating bedforms.   I guess I see what you're saying, if you're saying that aqueous environments are more likely than eolian environments to have this sediment influx. I'm not really sure what evidence there is of that, though. It seems pretty unlikely to me that any dynamic environment - sub-aqueous or eolian - would become permanently  stagnant i.e. produce ripples and then no further movement would occur causing sediments to settle out due to gravity. ""Permanent"" in the sense that no movement would occur for a long enough period of time to allow preservation (not necessarily consolidation or lithification, though).  So, I guess if I had to choose which of those environments that scenario was more likely to occur in.... you're right, it would be sub-aqueous."
geology,3cpzrw,caithaha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Right on. This is definitely not my area of study. When I picture smallish ripples of any kind, I immediately recall outcrops of interlayered sands and silts from an estuarine environment. In this case, deposition of silt-sized particles is the norm, punctuated by comparatively high energy events introducing sand sized grains (storm deposits, exceptionally high tides?), then overlain by more silt-sized material. With the potential for channels to migrate, it seems like this would be an ideal environment for ripples to be preserved, and potentially(?) more widespread than events leading to deposition of material in an aeolian setting that is significant enough to shield the ripple from erosion.   To my detriment, I escaped undergrad w/o sed/strat except for a crash course during field camp, so I apologize if this is total... hogwash."
geology,3cpzrw,GeoWheel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"Haha not at all hogwash!   Despite my primary interest in hard rocks and geophys in undergrad, I did some extra work for my sed/strat prof and then worked for him as an undergraduate learning assistant for the following term. Sometimes I like to challenge myself on reddit with how much I remember...but I'm not always right and I admit I'm better at sedimentology than stratigraphy...even though strat is really, way more fascinating. Yay sand  Anyway, I agree with what you're saying here. I didn't really consider which ""reservoirs"" contain more sand and silt sediments but I guess it's pretty obvious that ocean basins would. I've been land locked in Colorado for quite a few years now so I tend to forget about those things called oceans and beaches. =P"

He'd use the rod to smash all the crystals in the vugs. The mine had some of the world's finest azurite and cerussite crystals, rivalling Tsumeb, Namibia. It was done to deter collectors.   Also, in South America, the European Union sponsors training of former miners, teaching them how to collect and prepare minerals for collectors. That way they still have a job after mines close down.

We used to use a small chisel to break the cores out, one small enough to slide into the gap a bit, then a few taps would usually break it out. This gives a little bit of information geared towards paleomagnetic sampling, though the pictures are tough to make out and you probably don't care about paleomag if you are sampling granite and diorite.

geology,3clr54,slim_plug,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:13:26 2015 UTC,Stick a rod or chisel down the hole (to the side of the core) and pop it with a hammer.
geology,3cjn4m,Jens---,10,Wed Jul 8 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"1). When you cut a core from formation that you suspect has gas in it, the general procedure is to pull the core out of the hole slowly (usually about 2minutes per 27m), to allow the core to degas in a controlled manner. Assuming your reservoir is permeable, there shouldn't be any gas in your core by the time it reaches the surface. The main reasons for this are primarily safety (believe me, you don't want a core full of gas at 440bar arriving at your drill floor) and also to preserve the structural integrity of your core (as the gas will expand when it is exposed to lower pressure on its way to surface and if it expands too fast your core will shatter).   It might be that there's a bit of condensate with the gas accumulation. Condensate should remain in the core, which fluoresces a very light yellowish green color.  Definitely worth checking out. A word of warning if you do this, check the drilling fluid used to cut the core. Oil Based Mud filtrates are also very low gravity oil and may look similar to condensate under a UV light. They will also be concentrated at the edge of the core - so if you see fluorescence at the edge but not in the centre, it's probably contamination.   2) depending on the resolution of the pictures, you can probably throw together a sedimentary log at a reasonable scale. Also, depending on where and when your core was cut, you might be able to get a lot more information on it than you'd think. I work out of the North Sea and pretty much all well data has to be made publicly available after a certain time period (varies from sector to sector).   Good luck!!"
geology,3cjn4m,ObscenePenguin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:01:07 2015 UTC,As far as I'm aware the only way you would see gas in a core would be as very light residual fluorescence. You would need chromatograph readings or something along those lines to confirm gas

geology,3cjn4m,Gargatua13013,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"Q-1: I'd give it a whirl cause it's cheap and dirt easy, but success will depend on the materials at hand. Shale might be a lost cause, but limestone and sandstone might trap some hydrocarbons in fluid inclusions. Whether those would fluoresce enough to be perceivable is anybody's guess. We use UV to spot such inclusions in micro-thermobarometric studies on fluid inclusions, but under a microscope. I'd put that one in the ""Try it but keep low expectations"" category. Perhaps with a handlens on sparry cements?  Q-2: With good high-res macro shots you can do quite a lot. I've routinely used such for mineral counts for classification of granitic rocks for instance. You can even use color distribution stats from commercial image processing software to get percentages. With sedimentary rocks, you could do the same after standard coloring procedures to sort out K-spar, Plag and Qz proportions to build QFP diagrams.  Textures, fossils are also quite good from high res pix, provided they are good of course."
geology,3cjn4m,gfdvca,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"I risk stating the obvious, buy you may want to take a more detailed look at the logs that you have available. Your best gas indicator will come from porosity logs or a gas log (gas concentrations in the drilling mud as it reaches surface). Based on my experience, if the operator is willing to invest their time and money into drilling a core, there should be at least a wellsite gas log/mud log/formation evaluation log. If you can find a porosity log with neutron/density crossover (neutron curve reads low porosity where density reads high porosity) you have probably found yourself a gas zone.  You should also consider a GRI analysis if you are working with shale and looking for shale gas. (http://www.corelab.com/ps/gri-analysis) With about 6"" of full diameter core, the lab takes the intact sample, pulverizes it, and measures any gas that is liberated during the test. This test might not be very useful with older core samples, as I'd imagine that the gas escapes fairly quickly (over a matter of days or weeks) once it is exposed to atmospheric conditions.  Best of luck."

geology,3ci2r2,HotFudge2012,3,Wed Jul 8 02:03:09 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking planetary geology, then your physics background will help you rather than hurt you. Actually, even if you weren't thinking planetary the physics background is a good thing. You'll find when you apply to graduate programs that it opens up some interesting research avenues.  Also, if your goal is graduate school and a more research rather than industry related job, I would highly recommend doing a research project instead of an internship. You're also not going to find an ""internship"" in planetary sciences--but you will find research projects and programs. You can work with a professor at your school, or you can try for an internship at a national lab or NASA, the DOE, etc. The National Science Foundation also funds undergraduate students through REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) programs. They're fantastic and look really, really great on a grad school application as admittance is competitive to them. Here is the link to search programs by discipline if you're interested!  Even if you still want to do an internship, do get involved in actual research as soon as possible. Go talk to your professors and see what types of projects they have that you can get involved in. It will help with graduate programs immensely.   Also, don't worry about having a physics background for internships. Plenty of people in the geological sciences come from backgrounds other than geology and do great with internship and job placements. My undergraduate degrees were in physics and mathematics with all of my research based primarily around astrophysics and astronomy. I did minor in geology, but I didn't really have any practical experience with it except for field camp. This year was my first real year being a geology student (I'm in graduate school) and I landed an internship that I'm at right now in Houston with one of the major E&Ps. I've found that most of the time people care more about the quality of your work than the exact topic. That being said, industry internships are tough for undergraduates to get so I still think your best bet is to focus on building a good research background for now."
geology,3ci2r2,llamacorn_787,2,Wed Jul 8 05:04:07 2015 UTC,I don't think that should hurt your chances at an internship.  Do you have any interests? Mining/hydro/environmental etc?

It depends on what rock/mineral that you have that helps determine what kind of environment the area used to be. If your finding limestone than its probably a marine environment. Sometimes it forms from chemical precipitation which results in travertine which forms in caves. Limestone is made from the skeletal remains of the organisms which used to live in that environment so yes things lived there. As for being more volcanically activity it has nothing to do with the carbonates seeing as they are sedimentary rocks not igneous.

geology,3cao5w,Pizza-hunter,4,Mon Jul 6 12:38:33 2015 UTC,"I would agree with trace fossil. I don't believe a burrow would create negative space that is filled in by other sediment though. More like sediment is shifted and the sediment that is moved around ends up cementing harder than the original sediment. Worms, bivavles, brachiopods and many other burrowing organisms create these. I would also hedge my bets on marine because fresh-water eliminates so many of the common trace-fossil forming organisms. This rock has clearly been well travelled and seeing the rocks in formation is always so much easier - rocks found weathered on a beach are usually a bitch to tell categorise!"

I say that because it looks to be a fine grained sediment as found at river mouths/estuaries and the raised line appears darker in pics 9 and 10 suggesting that it's a different sediment deposited later, filling and preserving said burrow.

If you're going to places where you're wading constantly in high water or hiking through a ton of snow, then you probably need a more specialized boot for that.   For geologic mapping you can maybe find some lab manuals as there aren't any textbooks that come straight to mind.

Meanwhile, as I was looking around Google earth to the west of Wahong, I saw some floodplain areas which are heavily farmed, and they all have small irregular roundish features in the fields, do you know what is the deal with those?

Calcite will have a strong reaction and readily effervesce   with HCl (or you can use vinegar, less of a reaction) while dolomite or magnesite should only react very poorly or not at all unless powdered.   Dolomite is a mixture of magnesium and calcium: CaMg(CO3)2 Magnesite just contains magnesium: Mg(CO3)  After doing an acid test if you really want to know what it is you'll probably need to make a thin section or have some XRD work done on it but that might be overkill... As for the matrix, could be a lot of different things."

These are the result of slight expansion of the rock as it is being exhumed and they make exfoliation domes, which gives them kind of an onion pattern (you can see the domal shape in the fourth picture from the top). Not exactly sure why the fractures would form a conjugate set, which is what these look like, but maybe there are some existing fractures in these rocks."

geology,3bsgks,knucklebust,2,Wed Jul 1 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Have fun with the placer gold, that is pretty straightforward. For the kimberlites, your best cues will be geophysics (mag) and indicator minerals in the heavy mineral fraction in the alluvial sands (provided you are going for the intrusion and not placer diamonds - if placer diamonds are your target, ignore what follows).   Mag: you seek smallish (1 km and less) circular mag anomalies. Reach out for published regional and local mag maps.   H Mins: You'll be looking for Cr-Diospside, purple Mn-garnets and strange ilmenites and chromites. At best, if you are well equipped and your skills are up to it, you could do your own separates and IDs on site. If not, collect large GPS-located samples of heavy mineral concentrate for mineral separation and characterisation in a qualified lab.  On the other hand, I've had experience dealing with prospectors and with exploration in native-owned lands and I'll give you this tip: keep your associates expectations low. Success is great, but it can't be guaranteed, and if everybody gets their hopes up that ""they are going to get rich off gold and diamonds"", things can get ""interesting"" in a bad way the moment reality creeps back in and pops everybody's bubble.

I don't think you can trademark genuine mineral names.   I guess it's a common clay mineral of some sort. Bentonite, a montmorillonite or an interlayerd mix montmorillonite and beidellite, is used to adsorb odours, that why it's used in cat litter. So my guess it's just a form of bentonite."

All the stuff about them having the only rights to this mineral deposit, it being the only place in the world where this mineral is found . . . makes me very skeptical.  If it was me, I would ask them for the mineral formula, and I would ask them for some pics from their mining location, but that's me.

Vinegar will dissolve it over time, but unless you leave it in a bucket of the stuff, you likely won't notice and gas evolving quickly.  HCl will make it effervesce quite readily. If somehow it doesn't fizz, then crumble some of it into powder and try again. That's a good test for dolostone (which tends to a yellowish off white or tan color, not the dark grey you'd expect for limestone)."

I was researching various things some key things I found 1) You dont need a Visa to travel to USA, you can apply for a VWP think its Visa Waiver Programme which allows you to travel to America for up to 3 months. Look on british embasy websites or lookup visa waiver programme. 2) I was thinking about maybe renting a car but some rental companies want people to be over 21 strange as legal driving age is 16 there but for insurance purposes. Some companies will not offer this and some will charge extra for under 21s.  3) If you can get some friends or family to go with you it will be more fun and save you some money as you can split rent etc. Some appartments are $1000 a month which is about £500 which isnt that bad so if you have another friend or 2 you can split to $500 or $333 a month which is less than £250 a month.

geology,3bmj4h,duckraul2,5,Tue Jun 30 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"to address some of the poster that you responded to from a resident of CA perspective:  1.) see eta_carinae_311 for reasons why this is a bad idea for this situation  2.) Nobody in the US rents a car before the age of 25 because the rates you pay for the insurance are hugely inflated. Basically the insurance companies believe that you are much higher risk before the age of 25.  3.) Rent often does not include utilities (water, gas, electricity, garbage, internet), and requires a security deposit that is usually about equivalent to the monthly rent that you get back once you move out and the apartment/house is in good condition.  Public transportation: It is highly dependent on where you live, and where you need to commute to. Public transportation is much better in SF than it is in LA because of how the city (SF) is designed and how densely populated it is. LA is much more sprawled out and the overwhelming majority of people commute by personal car. The areas with good public transportation are more densely populated and are generally more expensive to live in. For example, Westwood (west-hollywood) where UCLA is located, has better public transportation in the form of busses, but the rent is pretty high and you would be lucky to rent a small room in an apartment with roomates for less than ~800$/mo (and it probably wont be a very nice place).   I find it pretty funny that the visit ca/la websites report that their public transportation system is very good, because almost nobody you would talk to here would actually agree with that.   When you ask if it's easy getting around in CA without a car, what do you mean, specifically? In some of the more metropolitan areas it might not be too bad and even easier if you dont mind riding your bike or walking a bit. Getting around the rest of the state? going from north to south or vice-versa isn't too bad since you can use the Amtrak train system (though many legs of this system are actually serviced by Greyhound busses). Going East-West seems a bit more challenging and you have to recognize that this state is huge, so having a car or knowing someone with shared interests/ a friend who has one would be great."

As you make more you'll start to get a feel for the structure which will inform you what other measurements you need to collect.

geology,3bjbvy,eta_carinae_311,2,Mon Jun 29 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"I completed field camp last year and we had a similar setup and currently the camp that I went to would be in the same situation as you described. I'm not absolutely sure if it is the same one or not, but feel free to pm me the info and if it is my past field camp I would be more than willing to talk about it with you.  Something to note though too, I've seen several situations where professors are often overwhelmed with students not being quick enough to catch all that needs to be covered as well as the fact that the field course will be constantly on the move.   Another important thing to consider: not all professors are as out of control as it may seem. Sure, he may be wishy washy, but being in the field it's important to make decisions based on what is a necessity and what the class calls for. Obviously if people miss things or the whole class gets messed up for whatever reason (i.e. bad weather, sickness, hazardous situations) they have to take that into account and work with it.  Regardless of who you are with and where you are, voice your concerns. Yet, when you voice your concerns do so with respect and from the perspective of a concerned student. When you are talking to superiors, ask questions don't make statements. You want to lead them to thinking of the things you want them to consider. Make sure to voice concern and show through body language and the words you choose that you are concerned. Don't just go around and bitch about things with others (mind you venting can be a necessary thing at field camp).  Also remember, your field camp professor is most likely not incompetent. They've got plenty of years of experience and practice under your belt, you may not see what is truly going through their head. Even when you do a thesis under them waters can still be clear as mud."

He never fully commits to anything, remaining wishy-washy until the very last second, so no one knows quite what is going on. He's just a lecturer, so it's not like he's distracted by the tons of research he's doing.   This is not the prof's problem.  This is:   Yesterday, it took him 30 minutes in the field to realize that the map had the wrong direction labelled north. He let a student with pneumonia walk 20 minutes in 95 degree weather to get treatment. The only reason she had that pneumonia is because he let another sick student go on a 9 day road trip with the rest of the class. At least half of the class has gotten sick, and some might have to miss 7 days of field work.   The fact that the prof is not competent to assess students' safety and to navigate the terrain is a potentially serious issue that you should speak with your university about, specifically with your university's occupational safety department."

As far as the mindset, you need to learn how to package up the suffering involved in hoofing it up a hill somewhere and place it somewhere outside of your own head while you're in the field. This is a useful skill to have and one you really need for this sort of situation."

I experienced hydrogen sulfide contamination in a zinc mine after blasting hit water in a open mineral vein. It flooded a section of the mine, it wasn't safe to enter for a few hours until hydrogen sulfide levels went down after the fans cleared out the bad air, but it still stank. Weird to see water jet out of a limestone tunnel wall. Other miners had to lay pipes using a inflatable dingy to suck the water out.   Anyway, the odour might be from the anoxic mud from the bottom of the pond. Even if it were natural gas or CO2 he could have been easily asphyxiated from a lack of oxygen. I wonder if it's air.

However...   Since the gas is invisible, he said, it is only noticeable if it bubbles out of water. A naturally occurring gas leak geysering out of a creek, however, is very unlikely.  “My natural proclivity would be human-sourced,” he said. “But a naturally occurring natural gas emission suddenly like that?

That equation is best applied to alluvial deposits."

geology,3bbfa9,atchoe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Potentially. Illinois has some problems with naturally-occuring arsenic in groundwater which is often related to the presence of arsenic-bearing sulfides. It's more of a problem in the shallow aquifers, although small amounts of arsenic can be seen in the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifers especially as they begin to desaturate."
geology,3bbfa9,reverse_thrust,2,Sat Jun 27 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"Local rock shop was selling orpiment (As2S3) in little cardboard boxes, they had no idea it was toxic or that it was an arsenic mineral. It could have been bought by a child. I got them to put them in bags and told them to warn people that it's toxic.   Arsenopyrite is relatively safer, as it's insoluble. The problem is with orpiment and realgar (AsS). They can oxidise, generating Arsenic Trioxide (As3O4) (sunlight accelerates the process). It only takes a few milligrams of Arsenic Trioxide to kill an adult (about a grain of sugar).  http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/aegl/pubs/arsenictrioxide_p01_tsddelete.pdf"

The only people who actually have health issues as a result of asbestos have either lived next to a quarry for a long time or have worked with asbestos in some way or another for their entire life.

geology,3b8ld3,ThePeaceMaker707,8,Fri Jun 26 21:11:12 2015 UTC,"Generally these different mountain ranges are defined on the basis of their geology, meaning that they generally either contain rocks that are quite different (and exist for different reasons) or are in a different tectonic setting currently.  For example, starting in the north, the Modoc Plateau is essentially a continuation of the Columbia Plateau, dominated by basalts. The Cascade range is a part of the Cascade volcanic chain that runs along the western edge of the Pacific NW, related to the active subduction beneath the north american plate and includes the major volcanoes in Washington and Oregon (Mt. Hood, Mt. Rainier, etc etc). The Klamaths are a bit of relatively old crust that use to be an island arc (think Japan today) that was accreted (smashed into) onto the North American continent during subduction. The Sierra Nevada are a huge blob of primarily granite (ok, granodiorite, if you want to be correct) that sort of represent the crystallized version of magma chambers that would have been underneath a volcanic arc (like the Cascades today) when there was still active subduction beneath all of California. The Basin and Range represents region of active crustal extension (crust is pulling apart and thinning), which characterizes pretty much all of Nevada, along with parts of Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Mohave Desert is a block of relatively stable bit of crust sandwiched between major fault systems. Pretty much all the different mountain ranges along the coast of California are defined on the basis of changes in the San Andreas fault system and the resulting topography that has developed because of those changes. Rock types vary throughout with those west of the San Andreas having a lot more blobs of granite and those east of the San Andreas being mostly sediments and metamorphosed sediments.   The boundaries between these different provinces vary as well. Some may be abrupt (e.g. the Mohave is separated from the Sierra by the Garlock Fault) while others likely a little more diffuse (e.g. the Klamath have volcanics from the Cascades and sediments from the Coast range draped and/or thrust over its edges). Someone who actually studies the geology of California might be able to provide more info on the boundaries, I just happen to be a geologist who studied in California, so most of what I know is from TAing field courses based in CA while in grad school. If you type most of these mountain names in Google, you will find lots of discussions of the geology of these particular regions as well."

I understand Owens River Gorge is a pretty big fault line, but how is this line delineated/defined other than that tremendous fault. And why is all the tasty climbable granite on the Sierra side?"
geology,3b8ld3,CrustalTrudger,3,Sat Jun 27 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"The eastern edge of the Sierra essentially represent the beginning of the Basin and Range, i.e. the Owens river valley is a graben down dropped along the Sierra Nevada fault system to the west and the White Mountain fault system to the east (though the White Mountain system appears to be a bit more complicated as it shows some right lateral motion as well). You also have volcanism (e.g. the Mono-Inyo craters and cinder cones, Long Valley caldera - which is the source of the Bishop Tuff that makes up the impressive volcanic tablelands and through which Owens River Gorge is cut). within the area between the Sierra and the ranges within the Basin and Range. The White Mountains themselves are basically the beginning of exposures of the passive margin deposits (lots of carbonates, sandstones, shales, some dolomite, etc) from before the subduction zone started. A lot of these are PreCambrian to Cambrian in age, but you get farther into the paleozoic in places. There are pockets of granite, isolated plutons in the White Mountains and some volcanics, both of which area vaguely associated with the Sierra if memory serves. Thus, the sediments which make up the White Mountains are the country rock into which the Sierra batholith intruded, you can still see some of this rock in contact with the batholith in the isolated roof pendants along the eastern Sierra, like at Convict Lake. The White's are one of the few places I actually know the geology of in CA reasonably well after teaching field camp in the eastern part of the White-Inyo's for several years. Poleta folds for the win."

I actually despise my job a lot of or most of the time. This is for a combination of reasons:  The biggest one being: I work away from home 75% of the year. 3 out of 4 weeks of the month I'm not sleeping in my own bed. I can't own plants, or a pet and it is a difficult strain on a relationship. My SO is also a geologist so he understands. This schedule is not the case for all geologists - but this is what I've had since I've graduated 4 years ago.  The company I work with is not the greatest. The corporate BS we have to put up with on a daily basis is sickening. It is not an efficient system and we are not an efficient department. The people that I work with are very talented and the skills in most of the people far surpass those of the 'management' of our department. not necessarily a problem specific to geology but my company however it adds to my feelings of resentment towards the job.  The market is EXTREMELY volatile. Ups and downs in the field of exploration and mining is magnified compared to other industries. Right now we are in a down - SO lost his job in dec. I lost mine for three months - most geologists I know don't have work. Apparently this happens once a decade for a few years. So that is something to consider about the finacial stability I'm in for in the future. I am 27, no kids, no house but one day I'd like those things and I can't have my current job and have those too.   Day-in-day-out job wise is ok. Not the best either. I LOVE working outside so I thought this job was going to be great. Turns out I spend most of my time inside a core-shack (most of the time these are a big garden shed with benches for looking at drill core) with my nose to the rock for 10 hours a day trying to stay interested in looking at the same god damn thing over and over again.  I honestly think I am suited more towards something else in the field of geology than the exploration industry. I don't get any fulfillment from my job. I am paid to find gold deposits in beautiful places so my company can make money. I'm the first to admit that mining is required for our live style. I believe I would rather be on the environmental/remediation side of mining or earth science.   Sorry for the RANT. I love the topic of geology. I think it's amazing and I am really happy that I went down that road. I often wonder what I will do when I need to leave my current job.  What about you? Are you like me or are you thinking of joining this field."
geology,3b440k,hitslittle,4,Thu Jun 25 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your post about exploration.  I've been looking to get involved in exploration for a couple of years now, but my physical location and lack of experience in mining makes it difficult.  Right now I'm working as an unpaid laborer in a gem mine, but I'm trying to get out and move on to something better.  So far, what you briefly described in your post sounds like what I want to do.

geology,3b440k,Eclogital,3,Fri Jun 26 00:45:32 2015 UTC,The world of exploration geology is really small so most of the time it's about who you know. Networking is important. Most schools will have lots of networking opportunities so don't fret if you don't know anyone yet. Profs./instructors and other students have been excellent in networking for me and my colleagues. There are also exploration and mining events/conferences/seminars that offer cheap rates to students (or you can usually get in free by offering a few hours to volunteer). These are typically really fun (and include beer/wine/spirits) and are a great way to meet new friends and network.   I think I came off a bit harsh in my rant above. I think a lot of it has to do with burn out from an exhausting schedule. Not all geology jobs are like mine (the company I work for demands a lot of time out of all of their geologists). Overall I've been to some pretty awesome places through work and have seen some pretty amazing things.   If I could stay on top of the work-life balance of being an exploration geo I think things would better for me. It's something I am working on.   The money is really good. However the market is tough right now - not a lot of jobs out there with almost all metal prices being down. Especially gold - the commodity I work in.   Picking the right school can be important as well. Some are better than others depending on if you want to be in exploration vs. environmental.

I have been hearing the ""who you know"" aspect of this job from everyone else in exploration so I guess it's the truth.  Unfortunately, I have been out of school for a couple of years now from a university with a very small geology department.  All the professors were PhD status without ever stepping foot in the workforce.  My fellow students mostly went into the local geotech sector and absolutely no one went into mining.  I'm trying to focus on picking a graduate school I can get into and has the opportunity to network with professors and students with similar interests to me.  I've been told most companies don't offer internships so much as student contract work; it doesn't matter to me, I just want experience.  I know of networking meetings such as PDAC in Vancouver and Toronto, but are there meetings in the U.S.?  The money isn't a big deal to me, I just want to get a job I can find satisfaction and be interested to go.  I know metal is down right now so jobs are tight, but I am still trying to break through despite the rougher times.  If you have any advice for someone in my position I would love to hear it."

So... it's kind of a situation of doing what you need to to get the job done, in the most efficient/ cost-effective way you can. I spend a significant amount of my time negotiating.  Some days I think it would have been better to go into the regulatory side, but I know those guys get bogged down in bureaucratic crap too. I think ultimately it's a matter of reconciling the vision you had of what things would be like when you were in school with what things are actually like in the real world."

geology,3b440k,eta_carinae_311,4,Fri Jun 26 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy my job. I'm a hydrogeologist working for a state survey. So far it's been a mix of groundwater flow modeling, water quality sampling and water level measurements, and database development. I travel about 10% of the time, split between field work and conferences/planning meetings. It was fortunate timing on my part, I've had a chance to work on some really cool projects that have generated a lot of interest.  The one thing I dislike is being at the mercy of government funding. We've increasingly moved towards contract work instead of being paid out of general revenue, so we're very much subject to the current political climate. The state's funding situation was never great and the pay is definitely mediocre compared to the private sector. We're fortunate to have a lot of existing contracts or else we'd probably need to cut staff."

It's unfortunate really, if it were a better location and the pay were more competitive I'd consider sticking around permanently, but there's no way that will happen. We're probably not getting raises this year, we were barely keeping up with inflation as it was.   That and water supply planning is only sexy when there's a crisis, so I'm worried about the future of our funding sources as we work towards solving the problem... sigh."

geology,3b440k,Lefacavus,3,Fri Jun 26 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"I am a geologist that works as an underground miner for a gemstone mine in the United States. I am not paid to do my job. I work underground a few days a week to learn the ins and outs of a small mining operation including how we look for gemstones. This mine has no need for a geologist since the area isn't very large and all they have to do is follow the zone of mineralization. The average work week consists of finding the paystreak (zone of mineralization), drilling a bunch of holes, sticking in dynamite, blowing up the wall, and hope something is on the other side worth extracting. Rinse and repeat until you have a network of tunnels for an underground mine. The job is fine, it's not difficult, but is physically taxing.  The job is okay in itself even though I'm not getting paid.  I don't get to practice the typical sense of geology, but I am getting experience in mining which is what I want right now.  I enjoy the job because I never get office work.  I'm either in the mine helping drill and stuff or on the surface gathering equipment and sorting mud coated rocks looking for gems which is perfectly fine with me because I had office work geology jobs before and I didn't enjoy.  If you want to get your hands dirty work in a mine.  I'm not too excited to go into work every day, but I think that's partly because I have to wake up at 5:00 A.M. because we start work long before the typical 9-5 day jobs.  If I could wake up later I don't think it would be much of an issue.  Honestly, though I wish at times I did choose a different field of study.  I spent almost a decade living in Silicon Valley, the land of startups, and sometimes I wish I got the skills to get involved with that kind of business, but this is what I have going for me now so it's what I get.  The bonus is I get to work some beautiful granites and pegmatites all day long.  At any lull period in the mine you can find me peeling and bending the layers of the infinite supply of muscovite in the walls and on the floor, it just feels good!"

geology,3b440k,asalin1819,2,Sat Jun 27 12:20:29 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a geologist that loves his job.  Ironically, I got into the field because I wanted to do the type of work that (as of writing) all the other posters do - namely work outside, collect samples, and do science. Now while I don't work outside, or with my hands, I do get to do a lot of really interesting science & physics.  I work for a service company that provides software/project work for oil & gas companies. I started with the company 2.5 years ago (while finishing my Master's) doing software support, and have since moved on to working on pressure studies. It's been quite fulfilling because every project we get is different, which means solving various complex problems that oil & gas companies have trouble answering on their own. I get to work closely with the geophysicists and geomechanicists, and because of our relatively small size, the dialog between our disciplines tends to be very open - i.e. you don't get siloed.   I didn't go to school for any of the things I'm currently doing, really. I had always planned on becoming a hydrologist, although wasn't quite sure what my end goal was. My background is quite plainly, geology, even through my grad work I hadn't really specialized. So I think I've been extremely lucky to get on with the company I have, one that exposes me to so many different disciplines.  I know plenty of others that have had very different experiences since graduating, some of them have even left the field altogether. My advice is to make sure the company you might join is a good fit for you, and not just you for them."
geology,3b440k,PSN-Honestly,4,Sat Jun 27 06:47:30 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to get burned out.  More for the fact that I am using practically none of my skill-set.  I work for a reasonably large ($250M/yr) Environmental/Consulting firm.  While I am technically a Staff Geologist, I have been running dual-phase groundwater remediation systems for the last several months.  That's not to say I haven't worked on interesting projects (like large scale decomissioning of an NRC-licensed nuke facility), however it feels like I'm spinning my wheels.  I really enjoy learning and practicing geology and would love to get into exploration except most places favor paper champs over those with real world practice and skills rather than just straight academia."

I moved on to a small firm (<10 employees), and love my job now.  Instead of focusing on one small area of expertise, now I get to do project work, business development, contracting and procurement, and am pretty integral to the company as a whole.  I've been there for over 4 years now, and would highly recommend it.  That said, I do value the experience I got with the larger company.  I got to work on a really diverse set of projects, and after I was done there my resume looked amazing."

geology,3b4391,Sappert,2,Thu Jun 25 21:06:41 2015 UTC,I agree - there may also be some carbonate in with the quartz which often forms with malachite. An acid and/or hardness test could tell you this. The grey mineral could be magnetite (see if it's magnetic)?? or maybe specular hematite (scratch it with something hard and if it streaks red then it's probably this).

The green stuff is supergene copper mineral alteration, likely malachite if there is carbonate in system or chrysocolla if not. These form when hot fluid carrying metals, commonly of magmatic origin, rise through the overlying host rock in fractures. When the fluids cool, decrease in pressure, or are altered chemically, they precipitate their metals as sulfide phases along with lots of quartz or calcite. The sulfer is often introduced into the system by assimilating the host rock which is often sedimentary and high in sulfer."

Between oil and gas, minerals and other mining, groundwater/environmental, and engineering geology, there are a lot of options that aren't just in academia/research.    If they don't care about that, you could try looking at how many geology grads get jobs or at least offers for funded grad programs which will likely result in a job after anyways.  I don't know the nationwide numbers, but my undergrad graduated 10 people and only one has not worked as a geologist (and this was graduating in the recession in 2009), and he never really tried to get a job and instead went into the Navy.

It's not as pure as math,  it's not as pure as physics etc.  But really it's the application of every science,  but people see it as a lot of what we do is inferred and interpreted which is why we get the butt of the joke in science culture.

geology,3b4stj,tulbot,2,Thu Jun 25 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"I see a few potential issues here.  I'm not sure why you would expect all your Ca to be extracted from basalt (or any silicate rock) powders using an HCl solution. HCl doesn't at all break down silicate mineral structures, which you would need something like HF-HNO3 (and potentially HClO4) to do, before even thinking about getting a representative amount of the bulk Ca in solution. Once you did a whole-rock digestion, however, titration would not be a particularly useful tool because you'll have a ton of metal ions besides Ca - so you might want to do solution ICP-MS to get useful Ca readings.  Another thought is the extraction method - are you simply boiling the powders in HCl on a hotplate? You might also use pressure-dilution vessels (colloquially known as ""bombs"") to more forcefully put things into solution. I still don't think that will extract much more of the bulk Ca from mineral structures into solution, but it could help.  Finally... why do titrations when you have XRF data? Are we talking about glass bead XRF off of whole-rock powders or field-emission (handheld) data? You might worry about, say, Fe2+ vs. Fe3+ readings for XRF (powder-making significantly oxidizes your sample), but the Ca data should be pretty accurate if measured on a glass bead from a representative powder.  Hope this helps."

I peeked at the Red Bluff Quadrangle, and see that the (blue colored) Coast Ranges Province mentions serveral units that contain greenstone blocks (but doesn't say what kind of greenstone minerals are present in the accompaning pamphlet).   For the South Fork Mountain Schist, he pamphlet says   South Fork Mountain Schist (Early Cretaceous, metamorphic age; protolith age unknown)— Intensely crumpled and quartz-veined mica schist. Includes large bodies of fine-grained, laminated, greenish-bluish metabasalt (mb), as well as local metachert (not mapped separately)   There's a bunch of ways for basalt to metamorphose, but if it's hydrated enough, serpentinization is totally common. My guess is that you have some of that blue-green metabasalt and that serpentine is one of the abundant minerals in the rock.  There's also the round mountain serpentinite in the foot hills (seems lower than you described, but maybe somebody hiked it up and dropped it, if it's the only one you found).

geology,3b0tpg,MobiusTurtle,5,Thu Jun 25 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"While some are against the other departments from trying their hand at geology, I for one look forward to engineers doing less dog fucking and more work around site these days.   Structural corelogging itself is mostly a site specific skill until you get more well versed with your major regional and minor local rock types. Depending on what kind of mine you're at, you'll have a lot of the same rock over and over again and it comes down to mainly practice and remembering characteristics of your rock types and how your specific work place will characterize what is what. (For example at my mine, we have our 'rival' company mining the same orebody and their terminology for certain units aren't the same as ours.'   To keep it short, your best bet is to ask your local geo friend/coworker to give you a quick 101 and practice practice practice. Be confident when you log and be consistent with your naming, so that if you are really wrong someone can go back and see that what you kept calling A is actually B.  Good Luck."
geology,3b0tpg,MkMillan,3,Thu Jun 25 02:10:32 2015 UTC,I too have seen many an engineer participate in dog fucking.
geology,3b0tpg,loolwat,2,Thu Jun 25 15:11:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Geology is an interest of mine despite the connotations that engineers shouldn't get involved in it. We had classes that dealt with more structural geology and mineral identification but nothing about core logging.   I actually do not work at a mine but work as a Structural Engineer and Designer. I have a lot of free time after work is done and want to learn more about it since I would like to get a job in the Mining Industry. Are any resources such as books, videos, articles, or anything along those lines that could allow me to learn some basic nomenclature?"
geology,3b0tpg,NV_Geo,2,Thu Jun 25 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"For geologic core logging it's mostly just being able to identify meaningful changes in the rock depending on what you're looking at.  Having really good mineral identification skills is paramount.  Rocks are just an accumulation of minerals and if you can identify what minerals are present and whether or not it is sed, metamorphic, or igneous will help you a lot.  If you're doing core at the non-mining job you have now the rocks should be pretty easy and practicing would help in being able to separate out different units.  Can you tell the difference between sandstone, limestone, and shale?  That would be good to know.  Igneous rocks are a little more complicated but if you can get a good idea of mineral percentages you can use a ternary diagram to determine what the the rock is.(FWIW we never used the bottom part of that diamond shape and only used the upper triangle.) Metamorphic rocks are a bit more complicated.  Once you get to ore deposits though you have to start dealing with altered rock.  Altered rock is ugly and sometimes very difficult to identify.  The only way you get better is through practice.  The mining engineers at my school had to take physical geology, structural, and an engineering mineralogy/petrology course.  Have you taken courses similar to those? How about sed/strat?"

They're not always hollow, especially ones that are not formed in a very sandy environment (e.g., a beach, dunes, etc.) but rather in soils or places with a mixture of minerals and grain sizes (e.g., most soils).  To the OP - Fulgurites form in silica-rich sands and soils where lightning strikes, melting and fusing the minerals of the substrate into an amorphous, glassy substance.   I have also seen them formed where powerlines have fallen and the electrical arcing had the same effect on the soil."

geology,3awcpc,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"Tafoni:       Tafoni (singular: tafone) are small cave-like features found in granular rock such as sandstone, granite, and sandy-limestone with rounded entrances and smooth concave walls, often connected, adjacent, and/or networked. They often occur in groups that can riddle a hillside, cliff, or other rock formation. They can be found in all climate types, but are most abundant in intertidal areas and semi-arid and arid deserts. Currently favored explanations controlling their formation include salt weathering, differential cementation, structural variation in permeability, wetting-drying, and freezing-thawing cycles, variability in lithology, case hardening and core softening, and/or micro-climate changes and variation (i.e. moisture availability). Tafoni have also been called fretting, stonelace, stone lattice, honeycomb weathering, and alveolar weathering.    Image i - Tafoni at Salt Point State Park, Sonoma County, California.

geology,3aydqf,SupremeLawnCare,5,Wed Jun 24 14:24:03 2015 UTC,"While there is very little direct correlation between earthquakes and volcanic activity, here are some things that might occur during a sizeable earthquake.  There are speculations in the literature, some backed by detailed experiments, about what mechanisms might be behind volcanic triggering by large earthquakes.  Mechanisms under consideration include:   Stress changes caused by large earthquakes may either compress or expand nearby magma reservoirs. In the former case, the compression could increase the reservoir pressure, while in the latter case, the expansion could cause tensile (opening) fractures, around the reservoir.  Either way, conditions promoting eruption may become more favorable after a large nearby earthquake. High amplitude seismic waves passing through a magma reservoir may cause the nucleation of bubbles within the magma and/or the disturbance of previously stable layers within the reservoir.  Bubble creation can increase magma pressure, and layer destabilization can cause reservoir “overturn” where dense layers of relatively gas-poor magma sink forcing gas-rich magma to rise. Either of these events could prompt an eruption. Violent shaking during large earthquakes can create landslides, fractures, and other major ground disturbances that can affect shallow magma reservoirs, such as Kilauea’s in 1975, that are poised to erupt anyway.

geology,3ata18,eta_carinae_311,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"I'm in my last year of undergrad in my geology degree and I've loved it. It's been really challenging at times but also really rewarding.  There are a few main career paths people who major in geology take: oil and gas/mining/resource extraction, environmental consulting or other environmental tech positions, or research/academia. The one major drawback in most geoscience related fields is that professional jobs can be prone to booms and busts. What happens in the energy/resource sector can greatly affect your job prospects, even if you are not working in that industry yourself. We are currently near the bottom of a bust and may or may not be coming out of it in the next couple months, depending on who you talk to. That being said, even though jobs are tight, there are still opportunities for those that apply themselves and have good networking skills. Overall I think that job availability is going to be great in the upcoming years. See the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook for some stats on job outlook, and for a general feel of what it means to be a geoscientist. That website was a great help in exploring what I wanted to do as a career. It has data on pay, job outlook, type of work, education required, what kind of work is done, etc.  I've gone on many field trips, and have had a grand time being outdoors, hiking, looking at cool features, etc. The highlight of most geology programs is field camp, which is usually a ~6 week field methods course you take during summer when you're an upperclassman.  You will learn many rock jokes. Cleavage and hardness, oh my.  My word of wisdom to you is this. Pick a career, not a major. Find out what kind of work you want to do, what kind of lifestyle you will want outside of that job, and find a major that will get you there. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. :-) Good luck!"

I think they're more valuable attached to the matrix (the substrate on which they have formed); If someone is forcing you (read gun) to break them out without destroying them entirely, then you might try HCl (hydrochloric acid). The matrix may be CaCO3 and the acid will ""dissolve"" the matrix, leaving the little crystals behind which I think are quartz (insoluble in acid). Alternatively, you could try distracting the person, and when they turn away to look at that to which you're pointing, you run away with the rock. Sorry, I'm in a good mood, but I'm fighting it!"

geology,3arwpy,droopydog22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:23:08 2015 UTC,It depends almost entirely what the host rock is and what the tiny crystals are. If you're not sure a picture might let people here help identify them.   As someone else mentioned though it's probably best to just leave them there.  As an all purpose last resort slowly chipping/scratching the surrounding rock away with a needle is unlikely to cause accidental damage to the fossil.  EDIT: let me specify I meant chipping away around the crystals as far away from the fossil as possible. Getting a fossil out of matrix is a nightmare of a job and way too easy to screw up

This career path addresses contaminated soil and groundwater. I believe to specialize in hydrogeology you end up doing a lot more math and modeling for aquifer dynamics than you do in a typical geology program. You would still be able to do the same work if you stayed in a traditional geo program, so I would suggest you try out a couple of more courses before taking the plunge to make sure you really like it :)"
geology,3aqxac,eta_carinae_311,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'm working as a hydrogeologist for a state survey. I was a straight up geology major in undergrad (did a traditional field camp mapping structure and all that jazz) and didn't do much hydrogeology until grad school. I took basically every course available; groundwater modeling, contaminant transport, low-temperature geochemistry, etc.  Hydrogeology itself tends to be a bit math-heavy compared to other areas of geology, having some coding experience is also helpful. Not required by any means, I learned a lot of this stuff on the job. That's assuming you're working with groundwater flow modeling, I'm also working on water quality projects which are an entirely different beast, I'm about to head out for a round of ambient groundwater sampling soon.  You probably won't make a lot of money compared to more traditional geology tracks, most of my undergrads I TAed are making more than me just doing mudlogging, but there are a lot of jobs out there especially now as more communities become water-stressed. So if you enjoy the work and don't mind the meager pay, go for it. I do agree you should probably continue with the traditional geology coursework and spend some of your electives on more intensive hydrogeology courses to see if it's to your liking."

We also have 5 (?) mass specs on the 5th floor of EIT and a really good geochemistry department.  With the hydrogeology then you could possibly work with some of the guys in environmental/water resource engineers in E3 or DWE (think they are all in the newly renovated labs).

The K and Ca add up to about 1 atom pfu when recalculated on a 22 O pfu basis. However, the analysis totals around 90% make me wary that there's a missing element in the analysis or a problem with the standards -- both micas and amphiboles should have much higher totals in a ""good"" analysis.

In my experience, the group was too tired on top of being busy with after-hours assignments to do anything other than work or rest (most days).  Musical instruments (if you play) and a football/frisbee can be an awesome break though. Bring hot hands, if you're camping out. If you're staying at a field station, bring air freshener (seriously, dirty laundry + boots = super stinky).  If your program's anything like mine, you're going to be EXHAUSTED 24/7. As long as you don't let that bog you down, field is SUPER fun, challenging, and rewarding. It's a great opportunity to build solid friendships too.  Oh yeah, and if you bring a bag of candy to share, everyone will love you like there's no tomorrow."

I was stationed out of a fishing lodge that people would pay thousands to go to, and I was paid to be there and I got to go fish for a few hours every night.   A book is always good to have, if terrible weather shuts you down for the day reading in your bunk can make for a cozy day off.

If you are camping out then some binoculars for stargazing.  They don't have to be high magnification 8x - 12x is fine just have to capture lots light and have good lenses that don't distort too much. Some folks jokingly call binoculars the Swiss rock hammer.

geology,3aeehu,pweipwei,2,Fri Jun 19 13:18:46 2015 UTC,Nice collection! Stupid question from a non-geolog. How radioactive are those minerals? Do they pose a health risk?
geology,3aeehu,aNonSapient,5,Fri Jun 19 13:42:42 2015 UTC,"This is not a stupid question!   So the activities of these minerals vary, but most of them have reached what is called secular equilibrium. Basically, the uranium in the minerals has decayed into various daughter products which are also undergoing decay through emission of ionizing radiation. The sum of the activity of the parent and daughter products is much higher than the activity of uranium alone. So, they are quite radioactive.   Uranium decays by alpha emission, and many of the daughter products emit beta particles. Alpha particles only travel a cm or so in air, so no worries there. Beta particles can travel up to 10 feet in air, but are moderately shielded by the acrylic case. There is no detectable activity at about 3 ft. away from the case. So as long as I don't spend too long staring right near the case, or decide for some reason that it is a good idea to lick the minerals...I am not concerned about any associated health risks.   I receive a much higher dose of radiation from flying in an plane that i do over the course of a year from my work in a lab with radioactive materials, and the time i spend in the opposite corner of my office from this collection. I hope this answers your question."

I wasn't trying to quantify anything, I was just confirming that there was no detectable activity in the areas of the room that people walk through (which there wasn't). I talk more about the surface activity in the thread I posted yesterday. The crystals really vary in size. The largest maybe weighs about .75 kg? This is the entire hand sample though, the crystals themselves are only a few cm in any dimension."
geology,3aeehu,RDS-37,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:01:41 2015 UTC,Right sorry.  I meant the volume of the crystal within the scintillator.  That volume is a measure of how to scale the gamma counts received;  over a very long time a crystal with double the volume should receive about double the counts of a smaller crystal.  Anyhoo!

Uranium decays over time into radon gas, which when inhaled over a period of time can cause lung cancer and other cancers. However, the amount of uranium in most stones used commercially for construction is very small so it will be a negligible contributor of radon in your home. Most radon is from the soil and will accumulate in your basement. If radon is detected there are options available to reduce the amount of radon in your house, often by installing a pipe into the dirt to pump it outside."

My thesis has 3 parts  1- crystal chemistry of uranyl vanadate minerals- basically i look at how changing interstitial cations in synthetic minerals having the carnotite sheet structure changes their structural, physical, and thermodynamic properties.   2-uraniferous opal- i am exploring incorporation mechanisms of uranium within hyalite opal and investigate secondary uranium minerals which form near these opals  3-nuclear forensics- i collect and analyze trace element data for uraninite and other materials from various stages in the nuclear fuel cycle to determine what patterns or trace element signatures are present, and how they relate to deposit type and locality form with the U was derived"
geology,3aay5b,jmancuso321,2,Thu Jun 18 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, I must have spent too much time working on U environmental chemistry... I have a feeling I could guess the group you are working with based on that first thesis topic.   Vanadium is a cool element... such a rich redox chemistry. Do you know what form V is in precursor rocks before carnotite is formed?"
geology,3aay5b,Poorrusty,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"I thought I replied to you last night, but I guess not! I am super curious as to what group you think I'm in. Let me know your guess!  Also, I don't know for sure what the V source is, but I would guess roscoelite or rossite something like that. Yeah, the complexity of both U and V is why I picked this project! Also, curienite and francevillite are super sexy minerals."

I have a friend/colleague who worked on autunite synthesis as an undergrad in the Burns group.   I am primarily interested in redox chemistry so I was curious if the source is oxidized or reduced. I didn't come across any newer discussions in the few minutes I had but did find this paper ""Mineralogy and geochemistry of vanadium in the Colorado Plateau."" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022508861900297#"

Also, yes I am familiar with that paper. Most of the papers about uranyl vanadate minerals are quite old....like...Manhattan project era old. I can look into it a bit more if you like but I think that the initial source would be reduced V, which is undergoing oxidative dissolution around the same time as primary U oxide minerals."

I would have guessed there would be a little more interest currently about V sources given the possibility of V being utilized in flow batteries for grid-tied energy storage."
geology,3adfh2,ZadocPaet,4,Fri Jun 19 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"In my job as a geologist, I spent more time looking at maps and dealing with spreadsheets than I did looking at rocks. Doesn't mean you can't get a sweet job, but I'd strongly recommend pursuing another path. I finally got fed up with getting laid off and needing to be a job hunting superstar, so I left the industry to go work in a trade. In your shoes, I would look at your skills and interests and do almost anything else."
geology,3adfh2,Niskanen204,3,Fri Jun 19 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"I'm still in my undergrad but these posts get a lot of the same answers so I'll rattle off what I can remember that pertains to you.   Planetary Geology is an extremely difficult field to find work in, and you need a PhD to even consider it.   33 is not too old. We all know many Geo majors in their 30s, even 40s.   Today, you're looking at a pretty rough market (however jobs are available) but Geology is a constantly changing field of work and you never know what the market will look like a few years from now. Oil and gas is especially bad with depressed gas prices right now.  You will typically need a Masters to be very competitive for good O&G / mining jobs but it's still possible to get in with a bachelors but you will usually be core logging. I personally know several people that have entered mining, some with a BSc, some with MSc, MSc seems to pay more every time and also offer better job security.   With a Bachelors, your best bet is environmental consulting. More abundant jobs, more stable, but less pay (30-40k starting on average? I'm not sure on that part though).  Just curious, why do you hate maps? Because you will need to get used to them.   Also, check out /r/geologycareers for more info :)"
geology,3adfh2,Bob812,2,Fri Jun 19 07:12:34 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why do you hate maps? Because you will need to get used to them.   I can get used to them. Maybe it was just the way we were tested on them that I didn't like. For instance, we weren't tested on if we could read them, but on if we could find something like the highest elevation in under two minutes. I would not want to make them.   I also wouldn't really want to work for oil and gas anyways. I live in Arizona, so we don't have either. We do have mining. Environmental would be fine. Teaching would be cool. So would writing and editing."
geology,3adfh2,blackgreygreen,2,Fri Jun 19 11:15:36 2015 UTC,A geology degree with a focus on hydrology is a very up and coming field.
geology,3adfh2,jeRskier,2,Fri Jun 19 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely not too old. However:  do petroleum engineering or like something structural, get an advanced degree, and learn to love maps.  Oil/gas and to a lesser extent, mining, are probably the largest employers of people with specialized geologic training.   Despite your political views, they are often great places to work and get field experience (with a great salary) as a starting geologist.  Then, once you've been in the industry, you can transition to teaching or environmental geology."
geology,3adfh2,Chainwreck,2,Fri Jun 19 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"There's mineralogy, optical mineralogy, geochemistry that are some disciplines that are not map based.

geology,3aejlx,Roald-Dahling,2,Fri Jun 19 14:03:06 2015 UTC,I assume you're asking what level of physics we had upon starting the path to our BA/BS degrees? I had whatever was taught in high school. I took college-level physics courses while going toward my geology degree.
geology,3aejlx,Iswitt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"'College level physics courses'? Was this an option you took whilst at University and working towards your degree? Or did you do this in highschool, before starting university?  Sorry, I should have said I'm in the Uk and the system is a bit different here.  GCSE level education (take exams at age 16.) A-level education (take final exams age 18.) Degree level education.  So I think your last two years at high school are the equivalent to our a-levels.   So I'm thinking maybe you had a-level standard physics when you entered your degree..? Which is a pretty indepth level of knowledge really. How indepth do you feel your knowledge was? Do you feel like prior knowledge in physics helped you out a lot, or was their sufficient explanation during your geology degree anyway?  Cheers x"
geology,3aejlx,Iswitt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Sorry, wasn't aware of the system differences. In public high school where I am from in the USA (Kentucky), I was required to take something called Integrated Science I and II. Basically it covered a lot of general earth science, physics and astronomy. We had separate classes for chemistry and biology. I felt that these classes were very broad in subject matter and did not delve into the real good stuff (physics equations, calculating star masses, etc.). The classes were designed for basically the lowest common denominator of student. . When I arrived at my university, I had to take some physics and calculus prep courses to get me up to snuff to take not only calculus  but also more serious physics courses. In my geology program we had the option to take either algebra-based physics (easier) or calc-based physics (harder, more interesting). I took a bit of both. I did not feel like I was really exposed to this level of depth prior to university. I learned it all while in pursuit of my geology degree. However, understand that I was taking the general, lower level geology requirements while taking my physics (and chemistry) courses."
geology,3aejlx,undersight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"Ah I see - So judging by this and other replies, I think any physics stuff that is required will be covered in the degree.

geology,3aejlx,thunderybob,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:45:32 2015 UTC,"The physics I learned in high school just meant I could slack off during my first year physics course at University. As they were covering content I had covered in high school. Your lack of knowledge in physics won't hold you back. They will teach you what you need to know in your degree. And if you struggle to understand or fall behind, your academic will give you lots of opportunities to catch up (ESPECIALLY in first year)."

Was aprehensive as well about the physics. We had a basic physics unit in the first semester of 1st year, basically year 11 and 12 physics, so very managable stuff, and i havent finished yet but so far any physics we use  is pretty simple and always applied to a geological somethingarather. Its not like engineering with shit tonnes of massive equations and whatnot. The hardest maths ive had to do really has been trig :/ haha"

The data we receive from the lab is critical for decision making for things much larger than the small piece you are working on in your lab. You are right to be concerned. Discuss your concerns with your supervisor and if they don't take you seriously escalate it above them. I'm dead serious if I found out a lab I use was skirting procedures and potentially cross-contaminating samples (you are right to be cleaning all. the. time.) I would fire them immediately. In fact, I have fired labs in the past. Millions of dollars worth of work rides on the information we get back from the labs, if it's worthless because some jerk is taking on more work than he should and rushing things, there are plenty of other labs out there I can use."

They tell us to get it done in any way possible, which leads us to do some (in my opinion) unethical things such as reprocess dirt after its been used in a test.

The vast majority of blocks are granodiorite in composition; however, a small number (~5?) are granite, with abundant k-spar megacrysts. Being that this granite clearly isn't in situ it makes it somewhat difficult to pin point its origin; however, I was able to locate some information that may provides at least some further insight:    Site Description: Victoria Breakwater (1916) Ogden Point off Dallas Road     History: The contract for the building of the Victoria breakwater called for 1.25 million cubic feet of dimension stone, consisting of large, roughly squared blocks of up to 20 tons in weight. This estimate actually fell short of the amount of stone needed, for by the end of May 1916, 1.5 million cubic feet had been delivered and the wall was not completed until the end of that year.   Building Stone: The breakwaters constructed in both Victoria and Vancouver contain granite [granodiorite] from quarries on the southwest shore of Hardy Island. This stone contains a fair number of black knots which range up to 30 centimetres in diameter. This precluded its use as a decorative facing stone or as monumental stone but it has proven suitable for less ornamental uses as it is easily quarried in large blocks. The Victoria breakwater also incorporates basalt, quarried as rough rock and crushed stone, from Albert Head on lower Vancouver Island.   From Dimension Stone in Victoria, BC (pdf)  Note: Some of the blocks have been replaced since the initial construction and may be from other quarries."

It's good to stay flexible.  The best combination is a strong geology background with a solid understanding of the applications of geophysical techniques and their limitations (the non-uniqueness problem) that seems to slip by most clients.

In my opinion geology field work is more interesting because most often your working or looking at stuff that you can physically touch.

By doubling the costs, coal becomes a more expensive fuel source. The cost in steel alone to support the amine based carbon capture at one facility was around $1 billion, IIRC. This unfortunately plays into the partisan narrative of ""Obama's war on coal"".  However, if CCS measures are implemented full scale, this could equalize costs for coal and nuclear. Natural Gas though would probably become the favored option while prices are relatively low, but I would suspect that this would be relatively short lived. The main take away is that a diversified energy portfolio is essential, and that CCS would help put each energy source on a more equal footing in terms of cost.

In the end GIS is just another tool and as long as you have a base proficiency it will be very useful to you.

geology,3a3ab6,ajtrns,6,Tue Jun 16 21:59:43 2015 UTC,"Large amounts of mass transfer on land are certainly known to affect he underlying plates- that's what the principle of isostasy is based on. That said, the weight of a 1km thick ice sheet is a lot greater than the weight of the peats of Indonesia so I don't know if this would have a significant effect on the isostatic equilibrium of the region.  That said, if it did affect the isostasy of the plates and caused them to deform, then I guess it's theoretically possible it could have some effect on the release of stress along plate margins. I don't know though, someone with more knowledge might override me on that."
geology,3a3ab6,Silver_SnakeNZ,2,Tue Jun 16 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"some effect on the release of stress along plate margins   That's my take home point I think. It contributes to isostacy, but doubt it could hold weight (no pun intended) as a single theory on its own."
geology,3a3ab6,SahirPatel,3,Tue Jun 16 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"While a lot of the comments here focus on isostasy, that's not really the mechanism invoked for the potential interactions between large storm events or sudden mass movements and earthquakes that is mentioned in the OPs original post. Instead, what is typically argued is that stress changes in the upper crust, either from removal of overburden or actual changes in atmospheric pressure, decrease the normal stress on fault planes, lowering the strain required for an earthquake to occur (if memory serves, isostasy is argued to play more of a role in relation to earthquakes generated by filling of dams). Importantly, demonstrating that this has happened is quite difficult and while it's something that the media likes to pick up on (as evidenced by the links in OPs post), it is still not a particularly well supported idea.   The big point is that any of these, whether it's the events discussed in the links or the idea of peat burning changing overburden mass (which I, by the way, am incredibly skeptical of), do not drive tectonics in any way shape or form. Movement of the plates driven by gradients in density and temperature drive tectonics and the accumulation of strain. If these mechanisms do anything, they simply alter the time at which an earthquake would occur, but it was going to occur anyway at some point because of the strain being built up. So they may be the straw that broke the camel's back, but it fundamentally requires that the camel's back was already bludgeoned with a big freaking hammer (tectonically accumulated strain)."
geology,3a3ab6,CrustalTrudger,0,Wed Jun 17 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think it would be instructive as a thought experiment to imagine that such relatively small forces acting around the biosphere could drive plate tectonics. After returning to that thought experiment occasionally -- suspending disbelief and casting about for new mechanisms of action -- new and useful insights may crop up. Very small concentrations of chemicals can have global effects in a  ""climate geoengineering"" context, and there are plenty of other cases in the physical world where very small forces have outsize effects. Though our understanding of the planetary-scale masses involved in plate tectonics makes us think that all surface effects should be negligible, it may not be the case.  But of course, at present the most we could possibly say is that massive erosion or storm events, or uneven distribution of mass across oceans, on the surface of the earth -- that these things could at best trigger events that are on the brink of happening anyway for unrelated reasons, and that this idea is not well tested. I'm just a layperson working in an unrelated field, and I had this idea somewhat randomly in 2009. I've been pleasantly surprised to find that other much more capable people in a position to do real research were thinking about this at about the same time not too far away in the Himalayas and Taiwan. Score one for the spontaneous, simultaneous bubbling up of an idea in the culture at large."
geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,3,Wed Jun 17 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Score one for the spontaneous, simultaneous bubbling up of an idea in the culture at large.   No it isn't you complete fruitcake! Like /u/CrustalTrudger said, the ideas that have been put forward have been put forward in a lecture during a Geophysics meeting. It's one or two studies - nowhere near enough to conclude anything. In fact, it's just a correlation we're talking about here. The earth is an incredibly complex dynamical system; do you even begin to understand how many entirely unrelated things correlate?  To add insult to injury, one inch of rainfall on an acre of land already weighs well over a metric ton. India, being a country of almost 4 million square kilometers in size, receives well over 900 mm of average rainfall during a monsoon. If you calculate how much added weight that is, you'll come to find it's a number that can't even be expressed in Gigatons - you have to use a power of 10 to make sense of it (on the order of magnitude of a million billion - that's 1015 kg, or millions of Gigatons). Peat burning accounts for about 2-3 Gigatons of mass loss a year. That isn't even a millionth of a fraction of the rainfall in India. And even then, those millions of gigatons of rainfall only account for a mere ~3 kilopascals of change in the stress of the fault according tot the scientists in the article you linked to.  So, if millions of gigatons of rainfall in a year's time cause a meagre 3 kilopascals in stress change on the local faults, just imagine how impossibly small of an effect peat burning (about 2-3 Gt a year) has on tectonics or stress fields!   Even if we burned peat at the same rate for over a million years, we still wouldn't be able to induce the same change in stress-fields that the monsoon induces in one year.  Get off your high-horse buddy, your idea makes no sense."
geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,-1,Wed Jun 17 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"Could you quantify the effect on the water cycle in Indonesia of all this peat burning?

geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,2,Wed Jun 17 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"This isn't quantum chromodynamics; it's geology. You can't just quantify the effect on the water cycle in Indonesia like it's /r/theydidthemath up in here. The system is simply too complex and noisy. That's why I didn't calculate monsoon rainfall in terms of concrete numbers, I specifically spoke of orders of magnitude because that's all we can say, really.  With that being said, and with the general feel I was able to provide you with, the same line of reasoning holds for peat burning and droughts. The orders of magnitude involved in peat burning and droughts are so incredibly small, and so negligible compared to the other effects that play a role in fault mechanics, it's just beyond the realm of possibility. Take a look at Sumatra for example, arguably one of the primary locations for peat fires. It's less than half a million square kilometers in size. The whole of Indonesia still has less than half of India's land area.   Most of all: India lies on its own plate, the Indian plate - one of the smaller plates of the Earth's tectonic system. Even on this very localized tectonic zone, an unfathomably vast mass transfer in the form of millions of Gt of rain isn't enough to make a meaningful contribution to the surrounding stress fields.   Now take Indonesia. Pretty much all of Indonesia's land mass is on the Eurasian plate. Do a google search for ""Eurasian Plate"". See how stupendously big that plate is in comparison to the Indian plate? If millions of gigatons of mass transfer on India is barely enough to make a few kilopascals worth of difference in the faults of its very local and very small plate, what exactly do you expect will happen from a few insubstantial gigatons of mass transfer on a very small patch of an otherwise immense plate?  Even if we succumb to absolute madness, say we've lost our mind, and by some feat of bad science we find that there's thousands of gigatons of mass transfer on Indonesia because of peat burning. So what? Millions of gigatons were hardly enough to induce 3 kilopascals in India's confined fault system on its equally local and confined plate. If such absurd amounts of mass transfer due to rain on such a (comparatively) small amount of space (the Indian plate) still turn out to be minute, what is to be expected from far smaller mass transfers on far larger plates?  It's pointless and ill-conceived.   And finally, let's say we've lost our minds yet again, even more so than last time, and say we find that all this burning peat and the resulting erosion somehow - don't ask me how, probably by some divine intervention - manages to create a few kilopascals in stress change in the local faults. So what? Indonesia is practically on top of the ring of fire and right next to the place where the Eurasian, Philippine, Australian and Pacific plates meet! The incomprehensibly big forces, stresses, strains and other geodynamics of the region would most certainly drown out any such insignificant and minor effects that Indonesia's peat burning would cause. It's like dumping a few truck loads of water into a stormy ocean - it's not going to do or change a thing."
geology,3a3ab6,duckraul2,-1,Wed Jun 17 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"I can't help but get the feeling that you're the nutty one here. You do seem to be ignoring the cases of Haiti and Taiwan that are linked to above. Perhaps you think that research is wrong? Do all seismic events occur due to only forces that are comparable to the size of the plates involved? Are the small earthquakes precipitated by filling or draining dams, regional drought, or hydraulic fracturing -- are those real things? Do they exist? Do they involve forces that must act on the entire, say, North American plate? Or can they be relatively local events?  My guess is that the amount of water (including change in weather -- drought) and sediment lost from Indonesia due to peat burning (a relatively small part of the landscape that, when removed, has a large effect on local climate) -- my guess is that total mass is not insignificant. That it is probably quite similar to the masses moving around in Taiwan's typhoons, or in the case of Haiti. That's all. They seem similar. Worth investigating.  You don't have to spend any time on it. Feel free to recuse yourself from this area of research. If you want to ""prove"" me wrong though, feel free to quantify the masses involved, and see if their movement is associated with seismic activity. Shouldn't be too hard. No field research is really even involved. Just a large survey of the existing data. You seem to feel rather threatened by the idea that this could even be possible, much less that anyone would bother investigating it.  It may turn up conclusive evidence that drought, massive erosion of soils, and transient heavy-rain events do not correlate at all with seismic events. You seem to think that's settled science -- that it's a disgrace for me to even bring up the idea. You have a real talent for useless, non-constructive criticism.  I do love that final line in your comment above though. It reminds me of the ""geoengineering"" case of iron fertilization... ""like dumping a few truck loads of water in a stormy ocean"" as you say. Just a funny little echo there. How much lubricant (water, or something else?) would you have to pour into a fault to give it that little extra oomfph for a slip. Such an interesting field of study.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_fertilization"
geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,4,Wed Jun 17 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. You aren't just a silly layman chiming in with an equally silly idea - you're a delusional fool!  Let's start with Haiti and Taiwan. First of all, and this is very important, the amount of significance and certainty you attribute to one study (and your ability to use that study to make a case for your idea) is nothing short of absurd. On the other hand, the amount of doubt you're casting on well-established scientific consensus is worrisome, to say the least.  I'm a post-doc whose work is primarily concerned with earth rheology and continuum mechanics. Right now, I could conduct a study into the most obscure correlations between seismic activity and surface processes, and I guarantee you, I'd be able to find numerous such correlations.  Why? Because that's the nature of our terrestrial dynamic system. It's so dynamic and so chaotic, there's bound to be odd correlations that don't have to mean anything. Have a look at this website. Correlation does not imply causation.   So what is the issue here? Let's go through this.   You do seem to be ignoring the cases of Haiti and Taiwan that are linked to above. Perhaps you think that research is wrong?   The research doesn't have to be wrong for me to ignore it. Also, I'm not ignoring it - I'm prioritizing. The idea that there is ""earthquake weather"" is very, very controversial, and the geophysical consensus is quite clear on this (hell, even the news article you linked to begins with ""The U.S. Geological Survey’s website states it in no uncertain terms: “There is no such thing as ‘earthquake weather.’”""). This doesn't mean that the current science is infallible; far from it. So what does it mean?   That a layperson like yourself is in no position whatsoever to just declare certain studies as correct simply on the basis of ""it sounds reasonable"" or to make guesses about what seems insignificant and what doesn't (because you don't nearly have enough knowledge to do that). Don't you see how ridiculous you are? This is like me walking into /r/physics and saying ""yeah, see guys, my guess is that black holes produce thermal radiation and that this thermal radiation contains information about their inner structure because I read a few news articles that talked about Gauge-gravity duality."" No. I'm in no position to say such a thing because my PhD isn't in quantum gravity - it'd be absurd if we could just ""guess"" something like that. The same thing goes for geophysics. Just because geophysics seems to be more tangible and real than quantum gravity, that doesn't make it more valid for people to just guess and pick what seems more ""natural"" to them. There are people who devote their entire lives just studying one sort of fault, or one method by which fault mechanics takes place. For instance, take a look at this paper. This sort of subject matter isn't something a layperson like yourself can casually ""guess"" about. The studies you linked to actually don't support your idea at all. They're irrelevant to your idea. Sure, both papers explored possible triggers for earthquakes. But they explored these triggers specifically within the context of sudden, abrupt quantities of mass transfer. We're talking gigatons of rain in just a matter of days, not years like in the case of peat burning. And that's ultimately the problem here; for a critical stress-field to be triggered, you need a sudden, ""unnatural"" alteration of ambient factors, not a gradual change like in the case of peat fires because in that case, the effects of the mass transfer by peat burning will just be drowned out by regular ambient forces like tectonics - forces that are far more powerful in the long term. To give you an analogy; if I were to forcefully push you out of balance with my right hand, but in the process also gently poke you with the index finger on my left hand, would you argue that it was my index finger that pushed you out of balance? Of course not; the force exerted by my index finger on your body is negligible in comparison to the force exerted by my right hand. I could have just as well not poked you with my finger - it wouldn't have made a difference in the grand scheme of things. However, had you already been on the verge of losing your balance, and had I then poked you quite vigorously with my left index finger in a very short amount of time, you wouldn't have been able to regain your balance because of the speed by which this sudden force was introduced into your body. That's what these scientists are saying; that this sudden mass transfer caused by hurricanes in Taiwan in a very shot window of time is capable of triggering stress fields. The key thing here is the time-frame: the same amount of mass transfer spread out over a year would have made no worthwhile contribution to the escalation of the stress fields because in that same time-frame, much greater forces would have been at work (tectonics causing strain, compression, chemical processes causing failures in the structural integrity of the rock - every single one of these is magnitudes more significant and noticeable than mass transfer on the surface, unless that mass transfer is enormous like what happened in the various glacial periods).   I'll give you another analogy. Suppose you have an old-fashioned cast-iron bridge. Suppose the bridge can take a max. of 50 tonnes. Suppose you have a truck that weighs 20 tonnes. What would happen if we slowly drove that truck across at maybe 10-12 miles an hour? Nothing. The bridge could easily take it and would probably not even bulge - it might deform a few millimetres, maybe even a few centimetres (an inch or so), but on the scale of a bridge of a hundred metres in length, that's nothing (a milimetre is one one-hundred-thousandth part of a 100 metre bridge, and a few centimetres deformation would represent about one-ten-thousandth part of the size of the bridge). This is equivalent to your peat burning idea. Now, what would happen if we lifted that same truck 100 yards up in the air and dropped it onto that bridge? In this case you're introducing all this sudden kinetic energy and momentum into the bridge's structure in a very short amount of time, and the effects are going to be more noticeable. This is what happens in hurricanes; a very sudden and fast introduction of a lot of material that would otherwise have an insignificant effect, but is now amplified by the time-frame in which it takes place.   Are the small earthquakes precipitated by filling or draining dams, regional drought, or hydraulic fracturing -- are those real things? Do they exist? Do they involve forces that must act on the entire, say, North American plate? Or can they be relatively local events?   Sure they can be local events. Fracking causes small earthquakes because that's what it's designed to do; to fracture rock. As with the others; that's more controversial. Either way it doesn't matter because your idea was about plate tectonics: ""an idea for one mechanism behind plate tectonics"". Plate tectonics necessarily involves large plates. There's no way around it. And as such it's a silly idea, because plate tectonics entail some of the most powerful forces known to mankind. Peat burning is just laughably insignificant. Again, you're involving irrelevant things. The fact that hurricanes might trigger stress-fields to escalate into a seismic event has nothing to do with plate tectonics.    You don't have to spend any time on it. Feel free to recuse yourself from this area of research. If you want to ""prove"" me wrong though, feel free to quantify the masses involved, and see if their movement is associated with seismic activity. Shouldn't be too hard.   And here you show us just how delusional you really are. Shouldn't be too hard? Are you kidding me you utter whackjob? Do you have any clue how immensely difficult it is to quantify mass transfer in a given system without explicit field, production, and satellite data? What, I'm just supposed to find local erosion rates, study the local hydrological system to see what effect the erosion and peat burning has on subsurface water movement, find out what the hydrochemical properties are of the rest-mass of all those tonnes of burned peat, find out what the local geodynamics is (which happens to be incredibly complex due to the four plates meeting just northwest of Indonesia), do a statistical elimination of all these variables and then set up a correlation? You are literally asking me to do a study on this, and you're writing it off as ""shouldn't be too hard""? You know nothing about geology, and with your current arrogant demeanor, you never will. I have given you a lot of qualitative insight into why peat burning is insignificant compared to the sheer forces, masses and powers that are involved in plate tectonics. This is like asking an astronomer ""my guess is that shooting a rocket at a big, rocky planet will change its orbit by a thousand kilometres"" and then when the astronomer tells you that that's an absurd exaggeration, telling him to ""prove you wrong"" by working out a lot of tedious calculations just to show how your claims contradict known orbital mechanics. Only orbital mechanics are a lot simpler and a lot more straight-forward than geophysics. The onus isn't on me to prove you wrong, the onus is on you to prove your statement. You can't just say ""I think that deep inside black holes, there's a million different universes"" and then say ""well, you will have to prove me wrong"" That's not how science - or the world, for that matter - works. The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever."
geology,3a3ab6,CrustalTrudger,-2,Wed Jun 17 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"You seem to enjoy this. Because you are writing volumes. But you're shooting a missile at a tiny gnat. It's so adorable.  I'm seeing you willfully gloss over facts, such as    ""The island’s most devastating earthquake in recent history, the magnitude-7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake that killed an estimated 2,400 people in 1999, was preceded by Typhoon Herb in 1996, which dumped about 2 meters of rain.""   You'll notice the latency between the weather trigger and the event is ~3 years. That does not bode well for your loudly and uselessly expressed conviction that:   Sure, both papers explored possible triggers for earthquakes. But they explored these triggers specifically within the context of sudden, abrupt quantities of mass transfer. We're talking gigatons of rain in just a matter of days, not years like in the case of peat burning.   You also overlook that in both the Taiwan and Haiti studies, landslides and other forms of erosion were considered to be likely drivers of the ""trigger"", and those processes were taking place on the scale of months and years, not days as you would have it.   Your misreading of the source material to fit your view makes me thing you're not worth talking to.  Furthermore, no mechanism was investigated for those studies -- it could be excess water migrating into the faults and lubricating them -- Wdowinski doesn't propose to know. He just feels he's got a statistically significant correlation between typhoons, erosions events, and seismic activity. If you think he's a crank, fine! If you think I shouldn't be allowed to talk about his study and speculate on other parts of the world where the same methods of investigation could prove useful, you're a flaming jagoff.   The onus isn't on me to prove you wrong, the onus is on you to prove your statement.    Ah, but here's the crux of it, right? You seem rather mistaken here! There is no ""onus"". There is not need to prune me out of the discussion so vigorously. We would both agree that Wdowinski's studies are not conclusive. I'm not sure why you think it's off limits to discussion, or that we need to remind everyone at every turn how provisional the research is. This is not a package of cigarettes that must warn users of imminent danger, it's a DISCUSSION about A FEW STUDIES that are nowhere near joining the broader concensus. SO WHAT!  I could try to butt heads with you on this more, but you seem to be taking this completely out of proportion to what it is. I'm not making any extraordinary claims -- I'm making TINY claims. You're responding like I'm barging in and upsetting all the furniture. I'm just tapping on the glass and saying ""maybe we should look into all known large weather and erosion events, estimate their masses, and see if they correlate with seismic activity, probably with a lag time, like was done in these other studies.""  Maybe the title of my post should have been ""Could extreme weather events and erosion associated with peat burning and deforestation on large scales trigger seismic events up to a magnitude 5 or 6?"" Would that make you happy, my poor baby? Do you need the words spoonfed to you? Are you so sensitive that you can't accept a quick gloss of the issue as a start to a conversation?  I am completely in the right to talk about this research and link to it. I take it for what it is, highly provisional, likely to be proven wrong. But if it's true that a typhoon can trigger an earthquake, we might want to look around at similar events and see if they correlate with seismic activity too. How much effort could it take? How many human hours do you think went into Wdowinski's study?  I handle a lot of remote sensing data on a global scale. I can estimate the mass of sea ice across the entire world, because there's so much free data and so much footwork on that sort of thing. I can go out on a limb and ask questions like ""what is the mass of all apple trees in north america"" and even though no one has identified the specific spectral signature of all apples ina  way that is handed to me on a platter, it would at most take me a few months, maybe 200 hours of works at most, to get a good enough answer to the question to move onto the next step. I see no reason why Wdowinski's method can't be expanded to several other regions in a matter of tens of hours for a provisional look at the correlation between weather, erosion, and seismic events. I don't see what the fuss is about. I'll do the work myself eventually, but I'm here looking for useful insights into how best to go about it, and instead I'm been hit by your wall of hot air about why this line of thinking is so COMPLETELY OFF LIMITS."
geology,3a3ab6,NarcissisticDramaQwn,3,Thu Jun 18 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing you willfully gloss over facts, such as ""The island’s most devastating earthquake in recent history, the magnitude-7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake that killed an >estimated 2,400 people in 1999, was preceded by Typhoon Herb in 1996, which dumped about 2 meters of rain."" You'll notice the latency between the weather trigger and the event is ~3 years.    Okay? So the latency was 3 years between that specific rain event and that specific seismic event. What does that say? Were there no earthquakes and rain events in the meantime? I almost certainly doubt that. Also, correlation of this sort can depend greatly on the window of time you are using. Years, decades, months, weeks, days, hours. What is the cutoff, and why? You need to be able to explain why you used a certain temporal window to come to such a correlation, and that that cutoff has mechanical meaning behind it. Otherwise, to me, it just appears that ""Place which has complex active subduction zone and frequent typhoons/rain events has both earthquakes and rain, frequently"". We expect both of those things to happen independent of each other. In that case, using a large enough window of time (year(s)) you are almost guaranteed that a significant storm will happen, and a seismic event will happen; a quick search reveals that M5.5+ events are usually yearly or multiple per-year in frequency.   There are also plenty of earthquakes that happen on the west coast of North America without significant precipitation events, and there are also very infrequent earthquakes in the Pacific NW which is home to an active subduction zone and fairly heavy precipitation. The one commonality of all of these places is that they are situated in areas of complex and active plate tectonic activity. If you want to say there is correlation, fine, but that does not imply causation if you cannot provide a mechanism to reliably explain the phenomenon. If you think mass transfer/precipitation events trigger earthquakes in these areas, you need to explain why earthquakes are occuring just as, if not more frequently in areas without significant mass transfer/precipitation events  The above poster also fairly thoroughly worked through some qualitative explanations for you, I don't honestly know what else you expect. Do you want people to just agree with you? Will that satisfy your curiousity? This is a board more or less full of geologists, and so far nobody has stepped forward to support your idea of this being a driving force of plate tectonics/related seismicity anymore than it affects isostasy. The forces which drive plate tectonic motion and seismicity just so far outweigh (no pun intended) mass transfer/isostasy changes that so far it just has not been a worthwhile pursuit."
geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,-1,Thu Jun 18 08:10:15 2015 UTC,"The ""3 year latency"" observation was from a study in which the correlation between many weather and erosion events were found to occur in time with seismic events. I'm not taking it out of context. It exists in a much larger context. There have been proposed mechanisms for the action, but the important thing here is that there appears to be statistically non-random link between large surface mass transfers and seismic activity. You can tell me that it is random and they are not connected, but it's not me you'll be arguing with by saying that, it's Ader, Tsukanov and Wdowinski, and others.  It seem really disingenuous to me for you to take that comment out of context and attack it like it's some pseudo-science claim. It's a well-formed claim that is open to refutation, but you would need to refute Wdowinski's work in Taiwan. It may be that he did shoddy work which doesn't add up to what he says it does. I find it quite plausible, and see a pathway to confirm or deny it by testing for similar correlations in places with similar conditions: mountainous islands near fault lines experiencing massive weather and erosion events -- like on Sulawesi in Indonesia. Here again is the link in case you missed it:  http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/blame-it-rain-proposed-links-between-severe-storms-and-earthquakes   If you think mass transfer/precipitation events trigger earthquakes in these areas, you need to explain why earthquakes are occuring just as, if not more frequently in areas without significant mass transfer/precipitation events   No, I don't need to explain the mechanism, I just need to show that the correlation is strong. We can figure out and observe the mechanism later. Ader and Wdowinski both propose mechanisms. You seem to cast their thoughts aside and focus on me for some reason. I'm here to hold up their work as question marks, and no one seems to want to grapple with whether their work is legitimate.   The forces which drive plate tectonic motion and seismicity just so far outweigh (no pun intended) mass transfer/isostasy changes that so far it just has not been a worthwhile pursuit.   I just don't get why you are saying this. I'm not proposing with any sort of conviction that surface mass transfers in the biosphere are ""driving"" plate movements on million-year time scales. I'm just suggesting that they might trigger seismic events. That hypothesis has been proposed by many people, there are what I consider valuable and non-trivial studies on the subject in support of the idea, and I think it is ripe for further testing because the initial research consists largely of datamining of the historical record rather than time/labor/money-intensive field work. You seem to be hung up on the word ""drive"" for some reason. I may not be using technical words as carefully as you would like me to. You really need to get over that! I'm providing plenty of context and reference material here for you to know that I'm not suggesting that biosphere events are defining, say, convection currents in the mantle.  That said, I don't find it to be threatening or taboo to consider the possibility that the sum of all biosphere events could be affecting the mantle in a way that is as significant as tidal forces from the moon and sun, and to think about how we might test for that, but that's an area of speculation which seems to be so incredibly taboo among the other folks in this thread that's it's not even worth mentioning, and it elicits a violent negative reaction instead of just moving on with ""well, we've never had the data to know one way or another conclusively, we know there are much larger forces at work which makes us think these smaller events don't add up to anything, and we don't find studying the question productive, but if you'd like to investigate, here's the 8-year process that's probably necessary for you to go through in order to be in a position to do useful work in that area."""
geology,3a3ab6,tobyxero,2,Thu Jun 18 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to go into the things that /u/duckraul2 went into; he addressed some of your problems with far more patience than I could have mustered up this time around. He also seems to agree on the fact that my qualitative 'analysis' has been sufficiently clear to convey why your idea holds no water. If you want to go ahead and devote 200 hours of your time to an idea that is, in my professional opinion, insubstantial, then go ahead. Additionally, if you believe that you're capable of conducting a geological study into the effects of mass transfer by peat burning on a very complex and active seismic zone, then you're out of touch with reality. Estimating the mass of sea ice across the world or the mass of all apple trees in America is so easy, any mathematically literate undergrad could do it. It's an insult to the science that is geology to liken research into this phenomenon to mere remote data sensing. Good luck wasting your time - you can't even begin to comprehend what sort of things you should even account for.  With that being said, I will talk about a few things in conclusion.    We would both agree that Wdowinski's studies are not conclusive.    Then stop using them as the sole basis for your argument. If it comes down to Wdowinski vs known geological phenomena that likely counteract the small forces at play in your scenario, then don't write off every geological consensus that I tell you about. Take a moment to look through our discussion; the pattern is me explaining to you why your scenario is highly implausible, and you responding with ""ARE YOU LIMITING MY RIGHT TO MAKE IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIMS BASED ON IMPLAUSIBLE STUDIES!?!"" I'm not limiting you, I just don't take kindly to cocky amateurs who come into a geology subreddit looking for educated opinions and then proceed to ignore every such opinion, not just mine.   it could be excess water migrating into the faults and lubricating them   Highly unlikely. Water lubrication of faults doesn't work the way you think it does. There's a build-up of huge stresses and pressures in faults - not an ideal environment for water lubrication. In practice, the only lubrication known to play an established role is that of hydratred minerals, minerals that have H2O embedded in their crystal structure.    Maybe the title of my post should have been ""Could extreme weather events and erosion associated with peat burning and deforestation on large scales trigger seismic events up to a magnitude 5 or 6?"" Would that make you happy, my poor baby? Do you need the words spoonfed to you?   You're a layman. You know very little about geology and geological processes. Therefore, if I were in your shoes, I would try my best not to come off as snarky and pseudo-intelligent. Why do I say this? Because of your clear misunderstanding that this ""semantic"" mistake you're making isn't in fact a semantic mistake. You proposed a mechanism behind plate tectonics. That's what all my replies were about. Now you're talking about seismicity. Seismicity and plate tectonics are two completely different things. It's not about spoonfeeding me your exact question, it's about how you're framing this discussion wrong. Plate tectonics is governed by plate mechanics, and plate mechanics necessarily involve awe-inspiring forces that won't be impacted by a few gigatons of material (less or more). Plate tectonics is about enormous plates that move around by means of rheological processes. That is what your question was about, and it was too ridiculous a thought to merit consideration. However, now you've suddenly turned the tables and you're pretending that you weren't talking about a possible mechanism behind plate tectonics (even though that's literally in your title), but rather the impact on the local seismicity (even though that's not what your title says at all). You probably don't understand why this is a big deal, but it is. It's like me asking a physicist about a ""possible mechanism behind thermodynamics"" and then reframing the discussion in terms of optics and pretending like the difference between optics and thermodynamics is just semantics. And then acting like a wise-ass without realizing just how much of an idiot you are.  The mechanics behind plate tectonics is a completely different subject from locally induced seismic activity.    I am completely in the right to talk about this research and link to it. I take it for what it is, highly provisional, likely to be proven wrong.   Great, finally something we agree with then. In addition to understanding that this provisional research is likely to be proven wrong or simply insignificant, I have provided you with my own explanation as to why your proposed ""mechanism"" is implausible. You keep asking why we shouldn't even investigate it. Simply put, because I (and other people in this thread, as evidenced by the general response and upvote-count you're getting) have developed a feel for these kind of things over time. I know that building a house somewhere won't make the underlying plate sink. I know this because I know what orders of magnitudes are necessary for things like that to happen. I don't have to make a long-winded calculation involving stress tensors and complex force transfers to know that this is true. In much the same vein, the orders of magnitudes in your peat burning story are too inconsequential to have an impact on plate tectonics. They might seem sufficient to you, but they're not. Pick up a good book on geodynamics (I'd recommend ""Earth Rheology"" by Giorgio Ranalli) and get accustomed to the magnitudes we're talking about here.   You also overlook that in both the Taiwan and Haiti studies, landslides and other forms of erosion were considered to be likely drivers of the ""trigger"", and those processes were taking place on the scale of months and years, not days as you would have it.   Yes, that's because I've only skimmed through the Association's report to read up on the alleged correlation and methodology. I must have missed the timeframe, and if I did, then I still got to give you a general sense of why long exposures to mass transfer alone (like in the peat burning case) don't add up.   All things considered, I made my case. After your initial reply to that post in which I worked out the effect of India's monsoon on the local tectonics, I thought you might be susceptible to reason. Subsequent replies have shown me that you're nothing but a delusional fool who thinks he knows best. Being a good scientist is not only about challenging the scientific consensus; it's also about recognizing that if all you have is circumstantial evidence, the general scientific consensus might just be more correct than your unusual ideas are. You fail in this regard.  Have a nice day."

I'm not limiting you, I just don't take kindly to cocky amateurs who come into a geology subreddit looking for educated opinions and then proceed to ignore every such opinion, not just mine.   Good job, guardian of the sub! You've handled the situation in a supremely civil and mature way! You've won me over to the way of the asshole -- spew invective long and hard, and ask questions later!   Have a REALLY nice day!"
geology,3a3ab6,thetimbo2,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Well, as the saying goes, ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" To be blunt, the fundamental problems with all of these ideas, and especially the peat burning one, is that 1) they rely on correlation with little to no demonstrable mechanism and 2) they do not explicitly consider counter examples (i.e. how many similarly sized storms, episodes of peat burning, etc did not result in an earthquake either in the place of interest or elsewhere).   To continue to be blunt, a preponderance of field data and model results indicate that we understand the drivers of plate tectonics pretty darn well. While I generally agree that approaching problems from new avenues and attempting to be as open-minded as possible can lead to new insights, there is a limit to the utility of this approach. I'm not sure what that limit is, but ignoring the results of decades of careful work by hundreds to thousands of different geologists because of a perceived (emphasis on perceive as in your original post, you have not even demonstrated that the timing of peat burning in anyway correlates to the earthquake in question, just that they happened in the same place in general) correlation between two events is probably over that limit."

I doubt there is any native copper there as native base metals are usually formed in porphyry type hydrothermal and magmatic systems.  This is probably like another commenter said and oxidized biotite in schist, but my metamorphic geology is pretty poor.  The origin rock was most likely marine sediments including shales, mudstones, and turbidites.  There is a chance for proximal volcanics as well but that depends greatly on location."

The Li et al. paper describes the geology of the area where your specimen was found.   The skarns in this area were caused by the metasomatism of sedimentary rocks (micritic limestone) and marbles. Metasomatism is a type of metamorphism where country rock surrounding an igneous intrusion (granite, granodiorite, diorite) chemically reacts with hot hydrothermal fluids diffusing from the intrusion; in this area of Tibet, metasomatism formed important ore deposits of copper, molybdenum and gold.   The original sedimentary rocks are Jurassic to Cretaceous in age. The igneous intrusions were formed between 65–45 and 30–24 Million years ago, respectively. The younger igneous intrusions are associated with the skarns and ore deposits.  Li, G., Qin, K., et al. 2006.

Judging by what I have heard from other geology grads, I would suggest trying to network through your geology professors.  Many professors, especially at smaller universities, have connections in the field and may be able to get your foot in the door.  As for environmental science, check your state's department of natural resources web page. Often times DNR will hire seasonal workers. Although the pay is probably poor, it is a fantastic opportunity to get your name out there and network some more. Maybe even consider getting certifications in geographic information systems or other disciplines to become more marketable. Also, a masters degree is an option, but not the slightest bit of cheap... Good luck in your search."

Apply everywhere, even if they say 2 years experience. Check out if the company you are looking at has a recent grad program. Some do try to recruit right out of college.   Do your research - know the major environmental guidelines so you are informed in an interview. The best interview I ever had was one where I already knew I was under qualified and wasn't going to get the job, but the interviewer still went through with me and asked the questions, giving me information along the way. I'm so grateful to that person for what he taught me.   Take the first ASBOG test if you haven't already.

The resulting deposit, known as the Fish Canyon Tuff, has a volume of approximately 1,200 cubic miles (5,000 km3), rating it an 8 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. This is enough material to fill Lake Michigan. By comparison, the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens was only 0.25 cubic miles (1.0 km3) in volume. The eruption was energetically equivalent to up to 250,000 megatons of TNT.

However, because Tsar Bomba's reaction was complete within microseconds, while a volcanic explosion can take seconds or minutes, the power of the events are comparable if measured within the bounded respective timeframes.

So that explains why the top and bottom are flat an parallel.  As for the sides, the rock breaks that way due to stresses on it while is under the surface. These are called joints. Because the stresses on the rock while the joints are forming are, for the most part, uniform, they tend to form parallel groups. In this case there are 2 different sets of joints that happen to be 90 degrees from each other, which turns out to not be all that unusual.   Cool picture."

The Estwing ones are nice because they are specifically designed for rock hammers. On my field camp, I was just using a big carabiner for a while until I lost my hammer. With my next hammer, I also got a hammer holster, but it wasn't quite right for rock hammers and was awkward to use. I'd say for 13 dollars Amazon prime, go for the Estwing."

geology,39snm5,Niskanen204,2,Sun Jun 14 11:33:19 2015 UTC,"The other side of the coin is the inability to recognize an out-of-the-box opportunity when it comes along.   One small junior had a Ni-Cu deposit in a beautiful gabbro host that could easily be produced as dimension stone (i.e. buildings, countertops, tombstones, etc.). They were looking at supplying it to an existing shop which would have brought in $250-500k annually. I thought they should have sold the Ni-Cu property, produced the stone themselves, and actually turned into a going concern. Nope, no dice.  So there they sit years later at $0.015/share and 250,000,000+ diluted with no revenue."

A huge example is high-grade covellite ore, which frankly they should sell on Ebay as the raw ore instead of smelting. Covellite sells for a freaking fortune. I can say with 100% certainty that i'd be spending a lot of money on chunks of high-grade massive sulfide if some Sudbury miners would put the specimens on Ebay.

geology,39szxt,carbon-committee,6,Sun Jun 14 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Couple of things. First, very few of us have the privilege of living in close proximity to our field areas, some amount of traveling is usually required, hence why (amongst a host of other reasons and costs) funding is always required to do research. That may not be an insurmountable problem depending on your department or school (are there funds you can apply for to support undergraduate research), your adviser (does he/she have funds to support a research project), or the time you have left (do you have time to apply and wait for funds from a professional organization to support your research).  Second, as an undergrad, you're going to need a lot of help designing a research question and methodology. That's not meant to be insulting or discouraging, just recognizing that learning how to do research is a skill that requires mentoring. There is a reason grad school isn't (or at least shouldn't be) a 2-6 year independent study project. You will need to develop your project along with your adviser (or who ever in your department has a project that is interesting to you).  Third, I'm going to disagree with your adviser, at least a little bit. From the perspective of potential grad advisers or departments, undergraduate research experience is seldom important because of the topic you studied, but because of the experience you've gained in developing a research question and methodology, doing literature surveys, and hopefully writing. The ideal scenario would likely be doing undergraduate research that also provides relevant methodological or analytical skills, but those are a bonus, not necessarily a requirement. I think the advice of trying to doing a research project as close as you can to what you want to do in grad school makes sense, but if you're not able to study magma storage in undergrad, that's not going to keep you from being able to in grad school. Additionally, what your undergrad research ends up being focused on will largely depend on what your undergrad adviser works on (see point two above).  My advice would be to start researching potential sources of small amounts of funding for undergraduate research and thinking a little bit about potential projects you could do with said funding. When thinking about these projects, try to think about what your adviser is working on (assuming you have a good sense of this, if you don't, looking at their recent publications might help) and what types of projects you could do within the context of those. Ultimately, the rubber will meet the road when you meet with your adviser at the end of the summer to talk about potential projects. It's good to come to the table with ideas, but unless your a wunderkind, the chances of you showing up with a fully formed research question that is tractable in the time you have during your degree and is funded, is not good. That's ok, that conversation will be about developing a project idea that is tractable (this is actually one of the hardest things to do, even now as a PI on my own NSF grants I find it difficult sometimes to really figure out what is actually doable in the time and money allotted or requested). Best of luck."

It makes sense that the benefit of doing research in undergrad is to get experience designing a question and methodology. I'm really excited about the prospect of developing a question and doing some hands-on research and problem solving.   I'm not sure what the funding looks like at my school, it's a really small school and from what I've heard, the Geology department often gets overlooked. My professor is great though and really cares about his students, so I'm sure he'll point me in the right direction and try to secure what I need to conduct my research.

A museum would be unlikely to buy it, especially since most museums tend to feature a specific thing about their locality (though not all), so you'd have to find a local geological museum or something. Not a law, of course, just a common generality of museums.  The most likely person to buy it would be a collector, and some are stingy, others are affluent, and prices become very fluid as a result. It's very hard to put a price on something like that, though if I saw that at the local mineral shop, I'd expect it to be around a few thousand, or maybe several hundred because it's so opaque."

I would think that as long as you have necessary strict physics and/or chemistry classes then you wouldn't have too many issues getting into a grad program. And this is a very generalized thought, but it seems to me geophysics will generally lead you toward oil & gas whereas geochemistry could lead you more toward the environmental consulting side of things. I say that, but of course you could easily find the opposite to be true as well.   Hope this helps you at least get a perspective on things, I took both intro geophysics and intro geochem in my undergrad and enjoyed both classes. Geophysics was very math and technology based and geochemistry dealt much more with groundwater and surface water contamination, or how groundwater reacts with your local geology."

I'm where you are, a junior in geology at Western Carolina University, so I don;t have too many solid specifics that I can add.  This last semester I took a geophysics class where the professor gave a good overview of the subject and how different instruments and concepts work (we don't have a geophysics focus, so this was just an overview class with 10 students).  This professor also teaches a careers course for seniors and the gist I got from her for geophysics pretty much backs up what metal said, but I can also add that the oil and natural resource companies don't necessarily want more than a BS, because the geophysical instruments and methods can vary pretty significantly from company to company, so they are going to be training their new employees anyway.  I've always gone by the philosophy of ""do what you want to do."" From what I understand, geology is a good place for this because pretty much all disciplines will not be too hard to find jobs in.  I've recently been going pretty hard with planetary geology, and plan on going for a PHD with it.  Also, take as many opportunities as possible, I've worked for my university's hydrologic station for the past 2 summers and that helped me decide that I do not want to do hydrology.

I worked summers doing core logging, compaction tests, nuclear density guage site visits, construction monitoring, drafting, and a few other things.  I found this line of work not at all what I wanted to be as a geologist including bad pay, bad locations, political, projects I was morally opposed to, bosses that didn't care about me as an employee and didn't understand I wasn't a civil engineer.  After my experiences, I will never go back to geotech or environmental work.    Currently, I'm listed as unemployed, but I volunteer to work in a small underground gem mine.  This job has no need for a geologist anymore so everyone that works there has been doing mining in the area for most of their lives.  Only a handful of people work in the mine.  There are no quotas, deadlines, etc.  It's very casual despite the drilling, moving materials, and blowing up walls.  The owner lets me join the crew inside and I help with operations with the goal of learning the basics of mining.  Despite the incredibly beautiful pegmatite rocks, minerals, and lax environment, I'm still learning a fair bit about the operations.  The downside is it's not mining you would see at a major operation, but I'll still be able to add it to my resume.    Honestly, I've though about ditching geology as a whole.  Location wise I'm not in a great situation for exploring anything beyond geotech since the closest largest operating mine is hundreds of miles away and I'm still a fresh young geologist.  I'm hoping to move to Canada if I get an opportunity to work up there.  I'm not really sure what else I could do.

geology,39gech,KShults,12,Thu Jun 11 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Cliffs like this don't often erode away slowly and evenly. Large chunks fall off suddenly. Even if the poles were long enough to keep the house anchored to the remaining cliff (10s of meters maybe? im no geo-engineer), a direct hit of collapsing cliff on the back of the house could shear it from the beams or at least make it completely unsafe."
geology,39gech,lithofile,9,Thu Jun 11 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the speed with which the cliff face retreats, which is a function of wave action (seems pretty strong, but I'm no expert on that topic) and lithology of the cliff. It can be very variable, from zero to almost a meter per year, even on the same sequence of cliffs. For reference, the clifft of dover have an average retreat of 1 cm per year, and the cliffs at the french side balance between 0.05 m and 0.8 m per year, depending on the location.  Edit: well, that doesn't actually answer your question, sorry. If we take an average retreat of 1 cm (these cliffs seem quite sturdy, seeing as they are so steep), we only need 10 cm/decade +whatever you need to stabilize this thing in the first place. That is, if we ignore the effects of the structure on the cliff stability.  I still don't advise it though :p"

It was deposited in a shallow, hot and salty sea, on the edge of an equatorial continent.  The water depth never exceeded 175–200 m (574–656 ft),  and shallowed over time as bioherm detritus, and terrestrial sediments, filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery, when the sea was 50–100 m (160–330 ft) deep, and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record.  Some sandstones are present in the youngest rocks towards the south of the island, which represent sand bars deposited very close to the shore line.

geology,39c0y7,SnowGN,27,Wed Jun 10 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"This is a very special dike. To explain-  What this picture is showing is ridiculous. It's a basaltic dike intruding through various scorias/ignimbrites on pillow basalts. The dike lost pressure and the magma retreated down the tube. Then the dike got filled in by ashfall deposits. Note how the basalt is blocky and thick, a singular unit, up to the height of my professor's shoulder. All of the rest is ashfall deposits. You can see the layering further upwards. Even a compositional change in the ashfall layers towards the top of the dike. I believe that the uppermost white strata are showing phonolitic tuffs, not the felsics that you'd normally expect.   The picture was taken on a coastal road in Santo Antao, Cape Verde, on a field and methods course organized by the University of Copenhagen."

geology,39cpkc,TulipSamurai,6,Wed Jun 10 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, there are plenty of subdisciplines within geology that require little to no fieldwork. Not all, but various kinds of geophysics can be completely computer based (e.g. if you're research is geodynamic modeling of the mantle, you probably don't have to do any fieldwork if you don't want to). Lots of the more lab based branches of geology (geochemistry, geochronology, etc) don't always require huge field components. Field work might be a few days of grabbing rocks as opposed to spending weeks/months out doors for more traditionally field based branches of geology (e.g. structure, stratigraphy, etc). I haven't known too many people who got into a particular branch of geology specifically to avoid field work, but I think for some it was at least part of the decision in terms of recognizing that they're better and more comfortable in the lab than in the field. In general, I'd say purely field based geology is kind of on its way out. Even people like myself who do a lot of field work also do a lot of lab and computational work as well."

Though it seems you are implying that you don't like outdoors-ish type work, I was surprised that despite my total lack of outdoors experience I ended up really liking the field aspect. Though I do like the field aspect if geology, I'm not sure I could still be classified as an outdoor person because outside of field trips I don't really just go camping.   To answer your other question, there are plenty of people who successfully practice geology without liking field work. I think the caveat to that is that even if you don't love field work, you absolutely need to have an understanding of field work and field relationships to reach realistic conclusions based on lab work that you may have conducted."
geology,39cpkc,duckraul2,3,Wed Jun 10 23:11:50 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely.

Geophysics is mostly a desk job analyzing seismic surveys for oil companies. There are other geophysics jobs of course that involve gravity, aeromag, IP, EM, and other geophysical surveys. These usually have a minor field component when collecting the data then more of an office component to analyze it. Economic geology is strongly field based and in my opinion would be the best if you really enjoy field work."

I heard that traveling around the world was the ""worst part of the job"" for a lot of geologists and it's often listed as a negative/con on websites. I personally couldn't think of a better bonus to a career than traveling the world (yes, even remote places). Based on my rather thorough googling on the matter, I found that environmental geologists are the most likely to be outdoors. And petroleum geologists being more of the ""go to this desolate area to look for oil."""
geology,39csur,manofthewild07,3,Fri Jun 12 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, most petroleum geologists spend their time in offices processing digital data. Geophysicists might get out in the field a bit.  There really are no hard and fast rules for who will end up in the field the most, and it often changes with job level. Different companies do it differently too.  Personally, I like volcanology. I can get out to remote volcanoes every few years, I get at least annual international conferences, and I can travel to see collaborators.  Of course it depends on you getting a PhD, being successful at winning research funding in an increasingly competitive market, and sticking yourself on the postdoc treadmill for the best part of a decade, but them's the breaks."

geology,398mcj,frymn810,5,Wed Jun 10 13:38:29 2015 UTC,Its most likely that the horizontal layers are bedding (you can see gradations in the layers that are primary sedimentary features). The other 'lines' may me a tectonic cleavage that is oblique to the primary layering. The regular spacing of these lines broadly supports this interpretation. The 'circular' pattern is just  an interference pattern of the cleavage with interacting with the irregular erosional surface.

A lot of people have suggested theories that are possible, this is just my own. The angled layers look to be the original bedding, which could be aeolian but its tough to tell. The roundeness suggests water weathering for an extended period of time but not forever, obviously. The horizontal lines look to be modern weathering artifacts, probably the water surface of a lake, pond, or quiescent stream."
