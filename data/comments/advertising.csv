Those were my idea.    edit:  not that anyone asked but I'll provide a little texture to this: I worked at McCann in Tokyo from 1990 to 1995.  One of our biggest accounts was Coke (""red"" coke, Fanta, and Georgia canned coffee).   From '90 to '93 or so I shared a house with a guy that worked at CCJC (Coca-Cola Japan Co).  Both he and I are from the US and we would have family send video tapes of TV shows/series to us from time to time.   We had the entire first 2 seasons of ""Twin Peaks"" sent to us sometime in '92 and we were hooked.    At one point, after Agent Cooper once again said ""damn fine coffee!"" I told my housemate that it would be an awesome campaign to have Agent Cooper promote Georgia (Twin Peaks had a bit of a cult following already in Japan).  That was pretty much the extent of my ""pitch"" and he suggested it to his boss at Coke and the creative director at McCann the next day.     Long story short, after a bit of research (house mate's boss hadn't seen Twin Peaks) they loved the idea and decided to go all-in and get Lynch to direct and create a story line with a missing Japanese girl, etc.   The CD ultimately fucked me over by giving me no credit for the idea (after all, he was shooting film with David Lynch) but the group account director (and the client) knew the history of the idea and I at least got credit internally."

Kyle MacLachlan was there...and I think maybe the Log Lady? (don't remember).  Lynch wasn't present.   For all that, the campaign wasn't really all that successful and I don't think they made more than 4 or 5 spots that aired in 93-ish.   There was an option to do more but Lynch was expensive and the whole vibe was pretty far from the standard Georgia messaging."

Btw, I charge Â£350 as a daily rate so this is just a freebie.  The point of your product is changing currency without transaction fees. Change is a very interesting concept. Hire a street magician and spend a day filming him with a handheld camera. Only this guy, right, is the Worst Magician Ever. All his tricks are transformations, but somehow he manages to fuck every single one up. For example he can smash up someone's watch, then he conjures up a new one but it's a $5 plastic piece of shit. He makes someone's wallet disappear but when it reappears all the bills are replaced with $1. Every trick ends with people pissed off and angry and he has to run away. Picture it. Hilarious.  As for the people you use - 'hire' actors on the basis that you'll pay for their travel, expenses and food. Or find a huge load of community-school amateur actors who will do it for free. Ask your friends and family. Pull strings. Ask your friend's friends. Do what you have to.  And the end of the film say something like 'Don't you hate it when changes go wrong?

Automatic skip.  AirBnB - Uhhh, I love that fact that you guys did the research, and the design elements do look good... but the actual idea. I mean, there's no brand connection. Also, it's so generic. You took all of your wonderful research and insights, and just chose to do a mascot? One that doesn't even seem ownable to AirBnB?  Everyday Red - This once again seems like a bit of a generic execution. Trying to be the renegade brand, but the message is a hard one to translate. In terms of the print ads, I think the second one works better than the first. Additionally, when you get to the TV spots, I'm sure the answer is that you didn't have the resources to do cartoon animation for this, but having it go from cartoon to live action breaks the visual look and feel you are trying to accomplish  Rogue - Great concept, and love the TV spot. But, your guerrilla and social media are falling a little flat. Like, I get what you want to do, but if you did research into this TA (18-25 year olds), did you check to see if they scan QR Codes? They probably don't. So when they see these stickers in the wild, would they want to scan them? Or mistake them for some sort of street artist doing it? The branding needs to be more obvious.   Nintendo: The art direction is fine for this, but as a concept, how much research has been done for this? Also, why change the Target Audience? The reason Nintendo is arguable still around is because they aim for the younger audiences. By having them aim for the 18-30 M/F audience, you're saying they now have to go against their main competition directly? Nintendo has had a history of this not working out well for them, from the SNES, N64 and Gamecube. Also, why is this supposed to be a complete rebrand, and not just a new campaign? I say this, because as someone who used to be a student, people hate seeing graduates making big sweeps like this. We get that you want to show us the 360 thinking, but simply put, this isn't really how rebrands work. There's a lot more effort put into them. I can see this, because your gaming packaging, your console packaging and reskins of the WiiU are not good, especially compared to the rest of it. Also, your shot of the website is wrong. In fact, it actually looks pretty similar to what you have now.   And that's all the time I have. As one general statement, you guys are making a big mistake that a lot of advertising people do where you are doing campaign work that's targeted only in your bracket. Everything I saw is so far all aimed towards people who are your age (18-30ish). Which is bad, because most agencies have a bunch of clients with different target audiences with other age groups.   Additionally, you guys need to start distancing yourself from you HK roots. Not saying you can't have pride, but when you present yourself, I should only be caring about your work, not the place it comes from. Cause it means that you two are pegging yourselves as the ""HK Creatives"", which can be both good and bad. I know personally, if I saw your work now and you were trying to work in the US, I'd be hesitant to hire you, because it seems like you try to focus on Hong Kong so much, that I don't know if you'd be able to do other markets."
advertising,3di2gj,theirisnetwork,3,Thu Jul 16 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what stood out to me, I hope this isn't too harsh. I don't know what the market is like in Hong Kong but a lot of people need a good portfolio school after college here in the U.S. and I'd definitely recommend that to you two to help round out your books.  First and foremost take the Economist stuff down right away. The Economist is known for having some of the greatest headlines ever and not only do yours not live up to them, many are just less good versions of ones that already exist. While I commend you for trying to take that on right now it doesn't make you look good.  Nintendo - I like the art direction but I just think the tag line could be so much better. There's no tidbit of gamer language you can get in there? Something about replaying or hitting continue on your childhood? As it is now the writing is very flat for a company that should be very fun to write for.  Rogue - I like the concept (even if you are basically just stealing from r/firstworldanarchists) but with that in mind I just think there can be so many better executions. The best one to me is the kid not holding the handrails and the people playing pool with putters. The social idea is good but (at least here in America) QR codes are usually poo-pooed instantly (maybe that's different in Asia though).  Vespoochi - great insight but I really don't get the execution. I'm sorry because I see all this work that it looks like you put into researching and presenting this but I just don't see an ad I like.  I liked Everyday Red. It is pretty solid but I think it's lacking a bit of the attitude you're trying to convey and there's no reason to me that there can't be more than two print ads. The way I learned it, any good campaign has at least 3 executions. The first video falls very flat to me. Too much talking, not enough funny action. I'd rather see someone artlessly scarfing a burger and french fries with a classy VO saying things about ""Sophistication"".  Segway - the art direction looks so similar to the style of Everyday Red and similar to that campaign there's no reason there can't be a lot more of these."

If so, there are many ways to do this.  Most of which depends on: the target audience, the types of misconceptions and where/how they're appearing, and how they're negatively impacting the brand (perception? sales? social pass along?)  Advertising can do a lot to help change perceptions of a brand - especially within the digital space.  Have you considered digital content series that lays out the ""reasons to believe"" in the brand?  Or a re-targeting campaign that specifically feeds up that content to people who have seen/visited sites where they consumed these ""rumors""?  Or an influencer strategy using people respected in that product's community to tell the real story?"

From a packaging perspective, the cups are good, but the mugs can be done so much better. As a concept, it's a start, but there's so much more room for you to do this better. Despite your flavorful language, what you basically are telling us is that you have bold colors and do seasonal campaigns. That's not that big of a differentiator and doesn't really justify you making a new brand for this. Why couldn't this just be a subbrand for Starbucks or something else? The bus shelter ads aren't bad, but the key thing here is that if I change the logo to something else, can it still work for them? If it does, then your brand identity still isn't there yet.   Humbucker: This is a solid brand identity. But dude, show more process! Show things like sketches, and give this more tiles to give us a better story of it. Especially when you show us the final brand identity, you can make this thing really big, and show us all the details of it. Slight nit pick though from the digital dude. I see that you have a phone and tablet on the table, but it only shows the logo. What are these? Are they wallpapers? Is it you showing us the website? Right now if you're using them as just a visual element on the table, people will call out these two elements  Speedo: These are decent, but the big problem is that it seems like you're presenting to me three ideas, instead of a cohesive campaign. I love the first one. It's subtle and works. But the second two seem a bit weaker. Visually the second one doesn't look as good as the first, and the third one is too obvious. I'd run with the first execution and then keep making elements for it.  Fairtales: Solid, show it bigger and have more detail shots!  Website Propaganda: The design for these is really solid, but if you're trying to get into advertising, what's the concept behind this? Don't tell me ""it's for fun"". If these exist, there needs to be a purpose for it. Is it for an organization? A non-profit? Is it for a competing social networking site? If you're just wanting to do graphic design, they're fine, but for advertising unless there's a purpose for these, they're a weak point in your book.  Neuromancer: These look good, and the work seems solid, but you did a pretty crappy job of showing them. If you did the copywriting, why would you make it so that I can't read any of the copy well?  Odyssey: Visually, these are great. I'm confused why they're not one of the first projects I see, because it's clean and well done. Only crit I have for this is that for the adventure pack, I'd recommend putting the stuff on real life elements. You did it with the other ones, so I'd continue with the theme.   Avon Homes: Solid, but maybe a bit generic. I'd recommend showing a website or something, because Photoshopping the logo on a Macbook screen doesn't mean anything and doesn't add anything.   Scratch Media: In terms of branding, this is great. I'm assuming that due to the nature of the comps, this was something that went into production right? Fucking put this as one of the first ones!"

advertising,3dbzat,Smeedly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:55:48 2015 UTC,Is your goal to get people together without them knowing it? Reunite old friends who have grown apart? Incentivize people for getting together?  Here's a nice example of reuniting friends who have grown apart from Jagermeister that you've probably seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LE1-mIPgfk

advertising,3dapzl,deercorn,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:49 2015 UTC,You looking at digital banner ads has nothing to do with advertising and learning the craft.  Literally nothing.
advertising,3dapzl,AdvertisingDoosh,2,Wed Jul 15 19:50:09 2015 UTC,Ask yourself: When was the last time a banner ad made you feel like buying something?
advertising,3dapzl,thesuff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:31 2015 UTC,"Depends whether you want to see that stuff, I guess. It could be useful if you end up making digital ads one day, which you probably will, but personally I get enough advertising without having to look at it in my spare time (though I'm not a student.)"

advertising,3dapzl,DogfaceDino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:20:00 2015 UTC,"I work as a copywriter and I use Adblocker for all sites. While it's definitely important to keep up with what others are doing, there are better ways of doing that than wading through countless, repetitive ads in your everyday.  You can keep up with what's good in advertising by routinely browsing sites that gather the best ads. To write â as an author, for example â you have to read but no one expects you to read through all the worst books all the time. You pick the best and invest your time in them.  Let's say you're working on a specific project later on. You can do research on that topic and get a cross-section of what has been done before, what has worked and what you like about it. An analytic, active approach is better than the passive influence you get by disabling Adblocker."

advertising,3d7gs2,EasySmeasy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:35:04 2015 UTC,"There's a great bit in the show Happyish about an insurance company wanting to follow the pack and use humor and why they shouldn't. Some of the books here are good, but I would take a novel approach by emphasizing the correlation between pathos appeals and an ever younger target audience. Explore themes of naivity, insincerity, the death of character and the rise of personality. Plenty of good approaches that haven't been beaten to death by the associated press."
advertising,3d7gs2,EasySmeasy,2,Tue Jul 14 14:47:51 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thank you. Can you explain a little further what you mean by death of character.
advertising,3d7gs2,frenchybop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"Sure. There's an idea floating around about the end of character and the rise of personality. I haven't really delved into the matter, but my understanding is that previous generations emphasized quality, genuineness, the origin of a product and indeed the morality of companies - qualities associated with the schema of ""character."" Think ""...a family company"" or ""Farm to table.""  Personality is less about the product and substance of a marketer and more about the results - What does it do? How does this make my life better? Me me me. Personality gives you a relationship to your patronage often times literally through social media. You have to mention cereal here - 5 identical products from 5 identical companies - all go to market and non talk about the American corn farmer and how General Mills has been around the longest. They introduce you to Count Chocula and Capn Crunch.  This discourse describing the difference between character and personality in business, I believe, is engineered to shed light on a generation gap in advertising. In reality, most advertising is shades of both camp, but studying how younger audiences effect that balance may yield some interesting result."

advertising,3d89e9,mcmunchie,4,Tue Jul 14 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I have to echo the other two Redditors:  Do not work for free.  Is this client work? If so, they are billing the client for an art director and you're not getting any of that.  Is this internal? If so, they are using whatever you're doing to promote themselves and you aren't seeing any return on investment.   I cannot stress this enough. I have worked in advertising for a while and I've never heard of something like this. The only people who work for free are interns.   If they decide to offer you a job, now they know you're so eager that they don't have to pay you as much as they may have otherwise.   Instead of working for free, work on your portfolio. It's all about the portfolio. You can be a terrible presenter but if you have a good book you have a good book.  In case I wasn't clear: do not work for free."
advertising,3d89e9,TheAdManCanMarge,3,Tue Jul 14 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"You have a great attitude man. I haven't even seen a single piece of your work but I am in no doubt you are going to make it.  However, I have to say: the agency that you have been in contact with are fucking you around. Getting you to make a short film to compete for an unpaid internship? Fuck that man, that's just pure humiliation. Your book is either good enough to be offered an internship, or it isn't. At least, that's the way it should be. This ""Ok, we like your book...now we want you to beg for it"" bullshit is not fair.   Say goodbye to these guys. I bet it's a shitty agency anyway."

advertising,3d89e9,theirisnetwork,6,Tue Jul 14 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Be careful. No one cares about your experience in this industry. They care about your portfolio. So don't ""just try and get some experience to get started."" It might not get you started at all."
advertising,3d89e9,theirisnetwork,4,Tue Jul 14 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a question I'm curious to hear about from people here. What are your thoughts on people just getting into the industry trying to document their events in an effort to help people out?  I say this because I remember a couple years ago I started doing this. I gave a couple talks and occasionally would offer some good insight to students and jog the minds of some creative directors.  But, in general, I look back and realize that most of the advice and insight I was giving was pretty naive and wrong. It was just simply me trying to run before I learned to walk.   The advice I gave as a student trying to find work, was completely different from me when I was a graduate, and then when I got my junior position, then promotion and so on.   So it seems like this guy is facing the issue I had a couple years ago. Where he's writing from his personal experience, and thinks he's got it down and while he's not right, he thinks he's on the right track. But, the issue we are feeling here is that we as professionals  can see he's making some pretty obvious mistakes, but is presenting this as if what he's presenting is the right course of action. In fact, he's wording this reddit post as advice for ad students.  I'm not trying to knock what you're doing dude, when I was looking for work I tried to do outlets like this. I'm just saying that as you can already tell, it's hard to tell people advice when you're starting out, because the experiences you have are your own and don't reflect everyone else's, and in one of your scenarios (the unpaid internship) you're just flat out wrong. Like, I know you want to think that what you're doing is correct... but /u/TheAdManCanMarge is pretty spot on with it.   I'd say focus more on you making your book good enough so that you get hired, instead of trying to make Medium articles. Not because you're bad at it, but because your focus should 100% be on getting hired. Because I hate to break it to you man, why would an ad student want to read a blog about someone who's unemployed and is already making wrong decisions?"
advertising,3d89e9,TheAdManCanMarge,0,Tue Jul 14 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you mean. Rather than trying to give advice, I'm just trying to record what I think worked and comment on my process. I even start off my article by saying that I have no idea what I'm talking about. My ""objective"" is just to try to vocalize what I've been through so far and hopefully be able to do it in a way that's enjoyable to read.  With this, hopefully if I am able to celebrate small successes, my opinions/methods will change throughout the length of the blog."
advertising,3d89e9,LONG_COCK_OF_THE_LAW,4,Tue Jul 14 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, that I completely understand. But what I was trying to tell you, as someone who's been through this is that when you decide to do side projects like this, you're removing valuable time you could be spending on stuff that can get your hired.   Like... no one is going to care that you're writing Medium articles in your spare time. They will care if you decide to spend that hour or two writing and making a portfolio piece.   Trust me in saying that you'll have plenty of time once you're hired to be able to be introspective and write stuff like this. But right now, you should be focusing on getting hired. Not documenting it, not making it entertaining, just grinding and applying and making your work good enough so that you don't have the free time to write these things.  I say this because, as someone who's been a mentor as a younger age and had my stint of documenting my experiences, I've learned that on the whole people just don't give a shit about it. Sure, it gives you a great feeling to create something and put it out there, but I'd say that, in your current state (unemployed and looking for a job), any spare moment shouldn't be spend on things like this, it should be spent on activities which will make you a better candidate to get hired.  Here's a simple example. Writing, editing and posting this article must've taken you like what, 30-90 minutes? In that timeframe you could've been on Lynda learning a new program, or learning to code on CodeAcademy or spending time browsing Creative Ham trying to look for openings to apply for.   Sure, you can make the argument that you have a lot of free time and want to do this for fun, but as someone who was laid off who was trying to apply for jobs, I learned quickly that you can only stroke your ego so much before realizing that if it doesn't help you out, then it needs to take a backseat."
