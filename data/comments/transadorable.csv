You want the best light in front of you, preferably a window with natural light coming in, if not a lamp will do. You'll be amazed at the difference of having natural light on your face. I think you look fantastic so I can only figure it's the pictures you don't like."

(and let's face it, there's always something, right?) But it's not like I hate every other picture I ever took, it's just that when it comes to uploading stuff I get very, very selective.  And yeah, I know about the miracles of natural light it just always happens to be night when I'm in picture-taking mood :D (Case in point, I took this at 4 a.m.)"

We got a report on this, but it's all OK.  For a quick rundown of what's not cool, here's a few items:   Genitalia - Obviously Bare breasts or chests - This applies to ANY gender, not just femme ones. ""Erotic"" posing - This is a little more subjective, but basically means anything that's kind of suggestive or more than suggestive.   These are the main ones, but there are others! Underwear shots are OK, so long as there's no/limited bulges or ""accidental"" nipslips etc.   We're not just applying this to femme-presenting peeps, so all these rules apply to any gender or presentation!"

transadorable,3ac5iy,Phoebe_Inanna,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:34:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! And this is NYX's High voltage line which is vegan as long as you don't mind beeswax. Some have it and others don't. http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/p-291-high-voltage-lipstick.aspx  None of them though contain gelatin or animal products. They are also all cruelty free. I'm a vegetarian so it's important to me as well.

It's the Guardian from the NES game Guardian Legend, one of my favorite all time. If you're not familiar, you play as a woman that turns into a spaceship; the gameplay is a mix between classic shmup and original Zelda. Also the idea of transforming into a woman is not something that I ignored, even at a young age =) also the OST is amazing!!!  Here's a better picture of it: http://i.imgur.com/Jbektz0.jpg  It was fun to make, although I ended up inhaling more glue than I was comfortable with."

He follows this butterfly through a crowd on the street into an alley and finds himself in a fantastic world with nothing but nature and serenity. He has a revelation here as he stares at ants working to support the anthill that cities and humans are actually closer to nature than ever before; we're all simply constructing our own ""chrome ecosystem"" just as ants do! We're all simply doing what nature intended for us to do.   It was pretty hippy/transcendentalist of me but I liked the idea :)"

transadorable,380lrj,Raptorrocket,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:58:27 2015 UTC,I think if we do we need a trial run. It's probably going to be stalemate until the first person posts. Maybe a sticky thread for the first one and see how it goes from there?
transadorable,380lrj,Shipsexual,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:01:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the sticky is a good idea as well as a trial period. Perhaps we could have a sticky thread on the day and all posts could be direct links in comments? And then the regular selfies could be posted as usual. This way it is a bit more organized.

I'm sorry that your friend feels dysphoric over not being very masculine, but what I do when I get like that is I remember that gender is a huge spectrum and gender expression and gender identity are very different! How I express myself doesn't make me any less of a man."

Startled the heck out of me when he swam right up to me and just dodged me.)"

transadorable,32iom7,TranshumansFTW,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:37:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! Oh no, is it for work or something?? Mine has to be natural colors during marching band, so during the off season, I do as much with it as I can to get it out of my system hehe"
transadorable,32iom7,TranshumansFTW,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, apparently it puts people off when they're getting stethoscoped by a person with pink and blue hair :P"
transadorable,32iom7,samuelmouse,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"Aw, pfft, that sucks. I've always thought that was quite silly, since even if the person has colored hair, they still had to go through the same training as those without the colored hair! ...but hey, that's just me :P"

transadorable,32digr,Unreasoning,2,Sun Apr 12 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I really like the idea of this subreddit. It's awesome and you're awesome for creating it! :)  I do have one question though: it doesn't really matter that much and it's not like I want to, but what exactly is so bad about name-dropping in general?"
transadorable,32digr,Unreasoning,2,Mon Apr 13 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't create it, /u/Freddies_Mercury created it :) But thanks!  Name-dropping is banned for two reasons:   This sub is not your personal soapbox. This is where we post cuteness, and upvote cuteness. That is all. We should promote this sub, and try to keep our community central. Splinter communities result in fractures in the community itself, and weaken our general unity."
transadorable,3284d4,lorettaw,5,Sat Apr 11 12:42:49 2015 UTC,Oh my gods adorable! :D So cute!

transadorable,326v6r,Kit-ra,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"your facial structure will be very kind to you. your proportions are not that different from mine. you have a relatively small nose and your brow is not really pronounced, you have good cheekbones and your jaw is quite soft.  I don't know how old you are but I think you look 26."

transadorable,324jmj,DesilynnCyto,2,Fri Apr 10 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"Your skin is so perfect! You look much younger than I do and I'm only 21. Tell me the secret to eternal youth, please."
transadorable,324jmj,eldritchsugardaddy,2,Tue Apr 14 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"Really? You think so? Well, thanks. haha.  Um... I know I did full face makeup this day, lots of blending and not applying too too much. I think the lighting of the pic helps lol.   I see my face and I notice every little zit scar, and the masculine shape of my face. But, I know I'm biased and hard on myself so... I dunno.   I live in the desert too. Everything SHOULD be dry and gross haha."
