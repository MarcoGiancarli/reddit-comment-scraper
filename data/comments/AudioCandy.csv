Hot damn, now I know you're on drugs. XD  That having been said, if you wanna see some tips on script writing, I wrote this guide once. It's decent, but there are some really strong counter-points in the comments. Check it out!  And seriously, thanks again man. Excessive or not, that's an awesome boost to the ego in a time kind of full of bummers. =] Cheers!"

(and the audio cleanup post on PTA as well) Definitely helped cement a few tenets of writing in my mind as I was getting script ideas rolling, most appreciated. I don't know if anyone will actually be interested in the scripts rather than the audios so thankfully, not having too hard a time communicating my voice right now, but I'll definitely give it a re-read if anyone requests a cleaned up script  You got it, friend. Sorry to hear things aren't so good, and very happy to be able to shine a little light <3 the motherfucker even uses the same smiley face as me goddammit"

Because I think you haven't talked enough."
AudioCandy,3dv2gl,JimmyBoombox,2,Sun Jul 19 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not that fussy. It's gotta be long enough to run fingers through, look shiny and soft. If it's dark hair, then that's a bonus.

Gosh, so pushy! :P (Ha, you just wanna make fun of me for saying things weird.)"
AudioCandy,3dv2gl,JimmyBoombox,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:38 2015 UTC,Perfect. My friend has all of those qualities so I will most definitely let him know.  Fashionably late is what I do. Also that's partially right about you saying saying words funny. Like when you said you had a tattoo on your wrist I thought you said breast. So I was like wha wha what?! Then I re-listened and I was like oh you said wrist. But what is your wrist tattoo?

AudioCandy,3dv2gl,JimmyBoombox,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"B-bu- Fiiine!   Haha, perhaps.   It's called a luckenbooth. Kinda looks like this"

Tell your doctor about your lack of sleep and maybe they can see if they can help you.  3. yes tattoo faces and piercing faced people are to be avoided. Kissing is awkward enough without getting someones metal in your pores.  4. I eat a banana every single day if not more then one. 5 Yayyy I am not the only teenager who likes show tunes! Whats some of your fav shows? If you ever come to the east coast we should see a broadway show! 6 your sweet rambles are amazing and I love this audio. 7. If you wanna move have you though about transferring to another college...perhaps one in Mass or somewhere near me? :D 8.I'm so glad i live in the universe where your head has not been hit by any solid and dangerous objects 9. None of your business...ohh girlll do I sense a man in your life? ;) ha ha just teasing. Your love life can and should be just that..yours. Although I hope its going well. :)

I'd like that. Right now I need to let the ground settle.  Aww I'm so happy to hear that. Because I wasn't sure if it would be dull for me to just ramble on.

Maybe that one instead.  I'm sorry to hear about the boy problems, SM; that's truly a bummer. I always thought he was a really sweet kid, so to hear him suddenly get so grody at the end is a real shock. On a more positive note, you sound like you're springing back quite nicely and this questionnaire was a lot of fun to listen to. Have some peanut butter for me next time, hmm? Cheers!"

Your comments (always but especially today) put a whole body smile on my face. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to and reply to anything I post.  Oh and appreciation for my awkward done liners is a nice surprise. Perhaps I should make t-shirts? ha ha.  And yeah I have always  been a person who can get over things rather well, plus like you said it was a shock, but the nastiness was his own doing.

A lot of problems that come along with stereo mics or other external mics such as background noises, computer fan noises, thunderous breaths etc you probably never have by just using a phone. That's why it is so popular to use them. Unfiortunately I have no experiences with USB mics like the yeti or smart phones, but with almost anything that exists (all sorts of external mics and digital audio recorder devices). I think you're in good hands by using your smart phone"

One for a primary focus and one for tertiary media, like cycling images or, more often than not, reruns of some of my favorite shows. As for my rig itself, it's pretty decent; I went with a prebuilt by iBuyPower, as over the years I've found that piecing together my own boxes simply isn't worth the effort (and, on multiple occasions, the short-induced heartache). I can link the particulars if you're interested!"
AudioCandy,3cwynv,ImAlwaysOn,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:44 2015 UTC,I actually did the same thing! I bought a prebuilt CyberPower and added onto it over the past 3 years or so. It runs all games like a dream.

The way you talk about those in your section, I can pretty much hear you smiling as you speak of them so fondly.   Your lexicon sounds interesting :)  Also I loved the part where you were going over your audition music. It was so soothing. I love your voice ;w;  also ps. my username doesn't have a p haha XD"
AudioCandy,3c2j06,kkemt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:18:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much :) I could probably talk about band for hours. I might have to do a ramble just for that hehe.  I accidentally started choking up when I was singing the audition music xD I was like HOLD IT IN NOT NOW NOT NOW!!   Dude, the worst part is that I know your name doesn't have a p in it. Typo and I had an entire conversation about it yesterday hahahahaha, and when I was writing the title for this I was like, ""Okay, remember, there's no p in kkemt"" and then I pressed enter and shit there was a p -_-"
AudioCandy,3c2j06,sallowmoon,2,Sat Jul 4 13:36:30 2015 UTC,"awww you did so well with the audition music, I would've never known. seriously it was super pretty :)"

It was nice to  hear you ramble and just go through some of your happy memories, It helped me know a bit more about you, I never knew you were in band before! I'm sorry to hear that your stressed, if you ever want a listening ear let me know :)"

Also haha at the not the fun drilling part, cheeky. But yeah your nightmares really are something. Like they seem like they actually happen and shit. I'm telling you it must be that haunted basement."
AudioCandy,3c2j1d,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat Jul 4 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked that ;)  Must be haunted. That's when they were the worst anyway. I had the first two when I lived upstairs, but in that same house. I dunno. I think I just read too many scary stories haha. Either that or I'm just crazy. All seem plausible haha"
AudioCandy,3c2j1d,JimmyBoombox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:47:20 2015 UTC,Yup I did.  Nah man whole house be haunted with the worst spirits/demons living in the basement. Do you still get them while not living in your parents house? Also why pick the basement as your room?
AudioCandy,3c2j1d,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat Jul 4 05:11:22 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple bad dreams/ eerie things happen when I first moved into this new place. Like one scary dream and two pictures falling off the wall and hitting me in the face while I was asleep. But only like the first month or so I was here. Ever since, it's been peaches and cream.  I used to have my bedroom upstairs with everybody else, but I had the smallest room and it was always really hot in there. The basement was unfinished, but basically like it's own apartment. There is a kitchen area, a living room area, a bedroom, an office, and a bathroom. I wanted to get the heck out of my little room of heat, so when my brother moved out of the basement, I moved in."
AudioCandy,3c2j1d,JimmyBoombox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:55:28 2015 UTC,So like they fell then flew towards your face and hit you?  But that's cool you had like your own apartment setup before having to actually move out.
AudioCandy,3c2j1d,Cardlin,2,Sat Jul 4 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"No, well, kind of. One was a painting nailed to the wall above my couch. I was sleeping on it and the whole painting fell somehow, but the nails were still in the wall. Then later that week a dry erase calendar that I have on my headboard fell and hit me in the face haha. These things haven't fallen or moved since, just that first month or so I was living here.  Yeah it was nice. I didn't have to move out, I just really wanted to and could afford it. My parents wanted me to stay until... I got married off I guess haha"

AudioCandy,3bocpk,Cardlin,3,Wed Jul 1 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"What a sweet, cute voice you have! Great audio quality, too. Thanks so much for signing up! Hopefully I got the flair right; let me know if I didn't. =] Swing by Mumble sometime! We're always in there.   If you don't mind my asking, just cuz I'm always curious, how'd you hear of us?"
AudioCandy,3bocpk,Cardlin,3,Tue Jun 30 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks bunches! You flatter me so!! :3 My pleasure and thank you for my flair! I will, next time I am home alone. Forgive me I'm a noob and not sure how Mumble works and all....help pls?   Not sure how exactly I heard about you guys, I think I heard about you from seeing you guys on the submitted part of a user who does audios on both AC and GWA."
AudioCandy,3bocpk,JimmyBoombox,3,Wed Jul 1 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, nice! =]  Mumble's easy peezy. It works very similar to Teamspeak, Raidcall or Ventrilo, if you're familiar.    Download the Mumble Client from here Install and launch the program (there's an intro/tutorial/setup thing you go through, should be easy) When you're all done, hit Connect, Add New and then type in the Mumble info:     Server Name: AudioCandy.typefrag.com Port: 5495 Password: CandyAddict   Set your Nickname to whatever you want (so long as we can identify you) and you'll be all set. =]"

After all whats the hard work of going against the current when you have a lovely twin there to offer genuine kindness and support. I'm glad you liked the poem, you should check out her books if you like her style. The handmaid's tale in particular, shes a wonderful author."

AudioCandy,3blgyk,breakfastwithmelissa,4,Tue Jun 30 04:35:13 2015 UTC,"The way you said ""How do you live without without life?"" kinda just broke me. And that was just the beginning.  This completely hurt so much. Hurt so much, it was beautiful.   This is just so heartbreaking. I've reduced to a blubbering mess now. Ugh, this was really good. Really amazing.  /u/Cardlin did great with the script, but I adore even more the direction that you took it Mel. It was perfect. Just perfect and heartbreaking and just I'm an emotional mess with snot everywhere lol."

AudioCandy,3blgyk,Cardlin,2,Tue Jun 30 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Mel, you've managed to take my script and make it real and biting, that soul-scouring kind of ache that it takes the best of shows seasons to build up to. Though the words were familiar to me the emotions were all fresh and new, and it really caught me off-guard; I was not expecting to be so emotionally riveted this morning. Thanks for this sweet little surprise and for your amazing performance. =]   Definitely worth the wait."
AudioCandy,3blgyk,Cardlin,2,Tue Jun 30 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Yay! I'm glad you enjoyed listening to this. I hope it was a bittersweet experience for you - and moreso on the sweeter side.  Perhaps one day I'll finally be able to show this to V :3 I hope it's worth the wait for him, as well."

You've got a great voice, SM. =] The writing reminded me a lot of my favorite author; are you familiar with Chuck Palahniuk's work? You two share a similar hold-your-breath pacing to your reading that serves to really grab hold of the listener and not let go until you're good and ready.    Great read, great write.

AudioCandy,3bdsk7,JimmyBoombox,2,Mon Jun 29 07:07:54 2015 UTC,whaaaaaaaaaat I don't even know which one you're talking about.

AudioCandy,3bdsk7,FreshCadence,2,Mon Jun 29 15:38:11 2015 UTC,Oh that one. I only showed that one to people who PM'd me for it because they were making a response. Doesn't count :P
AudioCandy,3bdsk7,FreshCadence,2,Mon Jun 29 15:41:08 2015 UTC,You still shared it so technically it does. So I was right once again.
AudioCandy,3bdsk7,Cuddly_Bear_,2,Mon Jun 29 15:42:51 2015 UTC,It wasn't shared with the intent of other people performing it. Completely different.
AudioCandy,3bdsk7,Cuddly_Bear_,2,Mon Jun 29 15:44:34 2015 UTC,But you just said you shared it so people could make a response to it...  They still preformed it. I was right.

That was a ride that grabbed hold of me with the first line and didn't let go of me until well after the last had already been spoken. The way you lament the swag-lined staircase to ignorance certainly doesn't fall on deaf ears here, though I have to admit that I drink the kool-aid from time to time. I'm a sucker for trashy TV.  Maybe I'll read a book tonight instead of watching cartoons. =] Either way, thank you so much for your amazing delivery and insightful words; you'e a wonderful addition to the community.

And cartoon wise why not check out Futurama.  All the humor of a cartoon with some deep thinking moments and plenty of science jokes!

But it's not a park, it's just like fields of cane. Technically it's private property, so maybe I was breaking the law a little bit, but it wasn't a big deal. I still don't know what to call them :P  I was so confused when you said ""fingering."" I had to relisten to my audio to figure out what you were talking about. I was like Damn, Epi.

I was kind of mad at myself for drifting in and out so much because I found myself really wanting to appreciate every bit of the audio, so I listened again, hahaha.

AudioCandy,3afrk4,vocalixx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"1) We will be using PST to schedule everything, but people of any timezone can take part as long as they are okay with working (playing?) awkward hours. Once we decide on a final cast, specific hours will be set for the project, and we'll try to make it work out the best we can for everyone involved.  2) A simple American accent will be our standard simply to make things easier for the majority of our cast. That being said, many of the roles are foreigners or could be foreign (ex. Viola, Sebastian, Antonio, Feste, the houseworkers) so people with other accents are very welcome to join in the fun.   Thanks!"

I'm glad I listened to this one, too.  The line about the bedroom was extremely ominous; I'm very worried about it. Other than that, I love the way things are unfurling; the author has managed to get into the mind of a young woman with what I can only imagine is surprising accuracy, focusing in on details that I would never think to (and are thus very interesting to me).   I'm really looking forward to see where this goes, Sleepy. ^__^ This is a story I would have never picked up otherwise so thanks for the share and the read. =]"

AND THE KOREAN FOOD? NO. The little dishes are called banchan.   I recommend Japan. AND YES HOT SPRINGS. If you're cool with getting naked with random people. If you go to Hokkaido in February you can go to the Sapporo Snow Festival and then go around Hokkaido and visit hotels around the hot spring area.   Kindle should get on the solar power train.

AudioCandy,39lkjx,stef93,2,Fri Jun 12 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"Stef, your accent just keeps growing on me. You'd better not lose it when you come to the New World :P  I really really liked this audio, and it definitely helped me out. I know exactly what you mean when it comes to the people around you holding you back because they've known you for so long . . . It was nice to know that someone else has been there too.   I haven't done many crazy things, but when I was seven I made the ""Save the Ants"" club at my school. We built ant piles out of loose dirt and protected established antpiles from cruel seven-year-old boys. I suppose that was pretty crazy :)"
AudioCandy,39lkjx,alwaysslightlysleepy,3,Sat Jun 13 00:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'll do my best to keep my Old World accent. And if I lose it, I hope there's another one in the lost and found box :P  I didn't mean to make this audio helpful, but it's great to hear that it did. I'll let you know whether (temporarily) removing yourself from those people helps or not.  That's pretty crazy? No, that's pretty freaking adorable! If you keep telling me these kinds of things, I don't know if I can withstand all your cuteness ;) Oh by the way, I think there's an ant crawling up your leg right now."
AudioCandy,39lkjx,kkemt,2,Sat Jun 13 09:37:09 2015 UTC,"I can definitely relate to this. Lately I've been exhibiting certain behaviours that some of my friends have deemed ""out of character"" and while they're not bad behaviours, I'm inclined to agree. But at the same time, I'm embracing it :) thankfully there are a few friends who are very supportive.  Regarding the feelings you had towards certain comments/people on PTA, I understand that you know yourself the best but at the same time, I hope you don't have to minimise or discount your feelings. minimizing and discounting your feelings. The feelings you feel or felt may not  always be logical, but they are always valid. Because if you feel something, then you feel it and it’s real to you.  As for crazy... I entered into a long distance relationship not long ago. My first ever LDR, and previously I've never even considered LDRs as a valid way of being in a relationship. I've always been pretty cynical but this guy has opened up my eyes (and heart) to so many possibilities. It's his LDR too so I guess we're both pretty crazy.  Now I just can't imagine my life without him. Maybe it's a little crazy, but it's a good crazy :)"
AudioCandy,39lkjx,kkemt,2,Sat Jun 13 05:39:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""out of character"" response is no fun. I'm glad you have some good support to help you with that :)  Haha, that's exactly what I always say about other people's emotions. Nice! I used to have very bad and dysfunctional beliefs about myself and other and that caused me to have many unhealthy emotions: very needy, easily depressed, bitter, etc. Nowadays, I rarely get those feelings anymore and certainly not with the same magnitude. Still, I want to be the break in someone's day or a breath of fresh air, but I can't be that or bring positive emotions when I feel insecure or bitter. I keep a close eye on what I feel, where it comes from (bad situation or simply dysfunctional thinking), and whether it helps me to connect with other people. If it turns out that it comes from bad thoughts or if it stops me from connecting, that means there is work to do :)  I'm happy your LDR is working out. How do you make it work without the physical side (or with very little of that)?"

I tried to emphasize locations I expected would be most likely to be represented among redditors (though many are still unlikely), especially those with nontrivial numbers of English-speakers. Oh, and places where there's most likely to be free, fast access to the internet, too. (Sorry, Cuba, North Korea, and Burma/Myanmar.) This is therefore typically the most populous cities in certain time zones or local capitals. (I wasn't super-consistent in picking between these, however; e.g., Brasilia over São Paulo, but Chicago over Springfield, Houston over Austin, New Orleans over Baton Rouge, etc.)  Oh, and the relative time offsets between locations are often dependent on when—or whether—a particular location observes daylight savings time. So the relative time differences may be different for you six months from now, for example.  Anyway, hope this helps!"
AudioCandy,39ba35,lurking_quietly,3,Wed Jun 10 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"Coordinated Universal Time:       Coordinated Universal Time (French: temps universel coordonné), abbreviated as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;  it does not observe daylight saving time. It is one of several closely related successors to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.  UTC was officially formalized in 1960 by the International Radio Consultative Committee in Recommendation 374,  having been initiated by several national time laboratories. The system was adjusted several times until leap seconds were adopted in 1972 to simplify future adjustments. A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds but no consensus has yet been reached.  The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions  and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of Earth's rotation.  Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of universal time, UT1.  See the ""Current number of leap seconds"" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.

You've got such a clear, sweet voice and you absolutely NAILED that Taylor Swift song. =] When you focus and have a script, you're delightfully gathered and even more of a joy to listen to. What a great way to wake up; thanks for this!"

AudioCandy,37qoj7,typothrowaway,5,Fri May 29 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Hey Typo! If this can be a place where you can let loose and express your emotions, keep doing that. I wouldn't want to hear anything other than the uncensored you. Everything you feel is valid. Forget about the other people who have it worse. It's not comparable. They're all completely different situations. Just because some people have it worse, that doesn't mean that you should feel happy when you really don't. Thinking like that doesn't help you out. You feel what you feel.   Now squeeze me until it hurts...Then squeeze some more :P"
AudioCandy,37qoj7,stef93,3,Sat May 30 08:21:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Stef. You made me smile. :D  I'll squeeeeeze you till you pop! :P"

AudioCandy,37qoj7,lilifai,2,Fri May 29 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Oh Typo :(  I'm so sorry you're feeling like shit today. I have those days, those weeks, too, and I promise that we all do. I understand exactly what you were describing about your feelings and doubting your feelings because they don't seem to ""work.""  The most important thing is to have hope, okay? The sun will rise again tomorrow, and so can you. You can wake up, have a glass of water, step outside, and bask in the fresh light. When the big things are too much to deal with, enjoy the little things :)   You can do this! <3"

My parents were driving behind me actually, they got the fright of their lives!

Shouldn't be hard, though; as always, your voice is a pleasure to listen to.  Thanks for this, Mel!"
AudioCandy,37nj9q,Cardlin,2,Fri May 29 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the compliments, Cardlin!  So the genre of this story is magic realism and it's very abstract, so there may be more than one meaning to it, maybe not.  What I thought of the story was that perhaps she's not really turning into a cloud. We do know that she never turned before the marriage, so it might be delving deeper into relationships and intimacy and the fact that John might not really know Eleanor at all but they're willing to work through their differences by thinking that ""couples go through these kinds of things"" or when they go to see that ""weather/relationship specialist"".  Just some food for thought. I'd love to hear what you think! It might not be anything at all, and that's okay :D  Edit: wow I haven't talked like this since college and I miss it. I should do it more often hahah"

Like Epi said, you're so strong and it really shows you care a lot about people by overcoming your fears (is that the right word?) and hardships by sharing this with others.  And with that, I'll leave you this :DDDD"
AudioCandy,37df09,JimmyBoombox,2,Tue May 26 22:07:20 2015 UTC,You're very welcome :)   THAT IS THE CUTEST EVER AND OLIVE U TOO BBY <3
AudioCandy,37df09,JimmyBoombox,2,Tue May 26 22:18:51 2015 UTC,Thank you Sleepy for educating me on this subject!!!!! This is so punny
AudioCandy,37df09,JimmyBoombox,1 point,Tue May 26 22:11:33 2015 UTC,:D I'm appeeled that you would send that to me.
AudioCandy,37df09,JimmyBoombox,2,Tue May 26 22:19:41 2015 UTC,At first I was like what's TW but then I got it. So yeah you scared me a bit with the things you have described because they sounded like things I would have. But as you went more into detail then it became less scary because I didn't experience those things. But yeah I don't really have the koalafications for this. So uh good job on your recovery and this post to educate people.  Did your parents know about this at all?
AudioCandy,37df09,JimmyBoombox,2,Wed May 27 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you :)  My parents knew some of it . . . I mean, it was hard for them not to notice the physical changes, you know? But they didn't understand it really. They did take me to a hospital once, but the hospital in our town is crap, so they gave my parents a pamphlet with a food pyramid on it and sent us out the door, haha.   But yeah, my parents are more of the distant type when it comes to things that are . . . not the way they're supposed to be. They pretty much just started avoiding and ignoring me when everything was at it's worst."
AudioCandy,37df09,kkemt,2,Wed May 27 15:21:37 2015 UTC,Funny. I'm the distant one while my parents were the ones that did care. But orange you glad of all that progress you've made? I would be stoaked. But when did you know for sure that you had a eating disorder?
AudioCandy,37df09,kkemt,2,Wed May 27 18:17:10 2015 UTC,":D I am glad!  I actually didn't fully admit it to myself until I was in recovery. I knew it, I know I did, but I didn't let myself think it."
AudioCandy,37df09,kkemt,2,Wed May 27 19:13:58 2015 UTC,That sounded tigerrible I bet not to admit it to yourself till you were in pretty deep.   So what was the lowest weight you were at?

And then I download it to my computer and convert it into audio, then edit it onto Audacity. I know, long-winded >.< Raw recordings are most of the time the best! :)"

AudioCandy,3701vz,typothrowaway,1 point,Sun May 24 02:56:53 2015 UTC,Ya'll killing me here...
AudioCandy,3701vz,typothrowaway,2,Sun May 24 05:00:41 2015 UTC,Sorry we're not all as tech savy as the Great and Powerful Jimmard of Oz
AudioCandy,3701vz,JimmyBoombox,2,Sun May 24 05:39:52 2015 UTC,I die a little inside now after each new person says they don't know how.
AudioCandy,3701vz,typothrowaway,1 point,Sun May 24 05:46:23 2015 UTC,Why are you making it so complicated?!?
AudioCandy,3701vz,JimmyBoombox,1 point,Sun May 24 05:00:24 2015 UTC,IKR? Cus I dunno how to do it differently
AudioCandy,3701vz,typothrowaway,2,Sun May 24 05:14:56 2015 UTC,Plug USB cable to phone then to PC...
AudioCandy,3701vz,JimmyBoombox,1 point,Sun May 24 05:17:25 2015 UTC,I dunno how D:
AudioCandy,3701vz,Cardlin,1 point,Sun May 24 05:17:40 2015 UTC,"Actually I do know how but it's very hard to navigate ;_;  If you dig hard enough on YouTube, you might find videos with black screens and my voice. :x I'M A NOOB"
AudioCandy,36xiya,alwaysslightlysleepy,2,Fri May 22 23:01:02 2015 UTC,Wow that was beautiful! You had me sad smiling the entire time :) Great foreshadowing too. I realized halfway through that I was dead and that made me appreciate it even more. And that near crying at the end...Why are you doing this to me ;)
AudioCandy,36xiya,stef93,1 point,Fri May 22 23:37:05 2015 UTC,I'm glad you enjoyed it! I'm doing it to you because you did it to all of us yesterday. :P
AudioCandy,36xiya,stef93,2,Fri May 22 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"What, you're not going to comfort me? Not even a hug?! How am I supposed to sleep now :P"
AudioCandy,36xiya,stef93,1 point,Sat May 23 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, you can handle being slightly sleepy for a little longer."
AudioCandy,36xiya,Cardlin,1 point,Sat May 23 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, look who's giving me a hard time. That's cute ;) I'm willing to stay sleepy a little longer...but only if you behave..."
AudioCandy,36xiya,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat May 23 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"Sleepy, this was truly and utterly devastating. You broke me down and built me back up again, and I'm still reeling from the emotional blow. You've truly managed to capture that aching bittersweet romance of lost love, and the hopeful optimism of a heart that just won't quit. =] Great job with this, script and delivery alike. Brava."
AudioCandy,36xiya,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat May 23 00:03:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I do have someone to thank for help with the script. :P  Thank you so much for your kind words, Cardlin. You're the bestest of the best :D I'm glad you enjoyed it!"
AudioCandy,36xiya,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat May 23 00:16:12 2015 UTC,So i'm suppose to feel sad? Because I felt nothing. But then again I have a cold icy heart in a void of nothing...  Also how did you know chocolate was my favorite? Oh bae <3
AudioCandy,36xiya,JimmyBoombox,2,Sat May 23 00:21:31 2015 UTC,I had no idea chocolate was your favorite :) I didn't do it for you at all. It's a completely selfish love. Because all of the chocolate is mine mine mine.
