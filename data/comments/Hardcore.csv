In your opinion - what could I do to push it to the point where YOU would want to come? Are there certain bands that are offputting, or is there something missing within it?  Oh and fuck the flack - the fest changes every time anyway. That's not something that bothers me, I just book bands I think are awesome."
Hardcore,3dvq2r,DINOSAUR_BLOOD,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"To tell you the truth, a big issue for you is going to be getting know bands to the UK, or finding bands in the UK. Switching up the lineup is a great tip, but try and find a local scene with a few bands that play together often, invite them, then ask if they know anyone who's willing to play. Unity and friendship goes a long way in hardcore."

Hardcore,3duv84,ProspectSean,6,Sun Jul 19 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"I saw this the other day and read through it, sat with it for a couple days and revisited it to make sure I wasnt being reactionary. I have all the respect in the world for Scott Vogel but does anyone else feel that this is out of touch and overly critical.  Complaining that bands have nothing to say anymore in their lyrics, saying that they all want to cash in, that no one cares anymore. I feel like this is all stuff said about every generation of hardcore and it's never really true on the grander scale. Plenty of new bands have great lyrics and a deep rooted ethos and are doing well (Mindset comes to mind as well as Break Away).  I don't know, this just rubs me the wrong way and really feels like someone who just doesn't want change or growth. In one of his points he essentially says theres too much variety and too many shows, that sounds like a good problem? Sure if someone says theyre a hardcore band you cant know exactly what they sound like but could you ever? The 90s had bands like Sick of It All, H2O, Madball, and Gorilla Biscuits, all completely varying parts of the spectrum. And ok maybe there isn't a ""Big Event"" feeling for every hardcore show in your area, but to me thats a good thing, I love being able to go out every other week to a show, the more hardcore the better, and there still is a ""Big Event"" feel when large touring bands come through my area.  Like I said, all the respect in the world for Scott Vogel and what he's done, Terror is one of my favorite bands, but I just am not finding this criticism very valid.  What does everyone else think?"
Hardcore,3duv84,systemsXoverload,5,Sun Jul 19 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"I read this a few days ago, and it felt like lot of what he was saying was about Terror's career rather than the actual hardcore scene. All the stuff about bands being more corporate and selling more merch just seem like things that have happened to Terror in the course of becoming one of the biggest hardcore bands going. It really just seems like him complaining about playing energy drink tours as if that's representative of the hardcore scene in general."
Hardcore,3duv84,tubcat,6,Sun Jul 19 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"The lead singer of Trap Them had a wonderful open letter about the folks frustrated about sponsored/free concerts ( here ). Basically, he's fine with a corporation as a true patron and spreading his art because the fans apparently don't want to pay out to give him a fair living. If getting paid enough to support himself means having a booth with free Monster at his show, that's fine by him."
Hardcore,3duv84,The_Same_Sun,0,Sun Jul 19 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"for the most part he is right about bands not saying shit. Very few bands today are talking about anything of importance, I'll give you mindset. I do not agree with break away. Scott got involved in Hardcore in the 90s where everything was about the message. Today it seems its more about personal matters. I wish there was a balance because both are important to have."
Hardcore,3duv84,drewxdeficit,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that bands should have something to say and a message within their lyrics, but I don't think that concept and writing about personal matters are mutually exclusive.   I got into punk and (by extension) hardcore because of political lyrics, and my beliefs have been shaped because of my exposure to counterculture ideals. Bands that express similar ideas in their songs always have my respect and admiration. This is what prompted me to begin writing punk songs—the need to express something innate that I thought needed to be spread.   Now, some 13-14 years later, I find myself gravitating toward writing about my personal issues. I still feel like what I have to say is important (and we can chalk that up to narcissism, too) if only to appease myself.   Hardcore is an interesting genre because it's perfectly reasonable for a band to make it known that they perform for themselves and not for fans. Yeah, it's great when people dig what you're playing, but make no mistake: every hardcore band you ever see is writing and playing music to make themselves feel better.   That may seem like an unimportant point to make in this conversation, but I think it's paramount. I know I suck at writing lyrics that touch on political or social issues, but I can write something I'm proud of if I'm trying to come to terms with something internal (again, chalk it up to narcissism). However, the challenge is always to write something that isn't a copy of someone else's work. Try like hell to make something wholly your own.   I say all of that simply to make this point: the message is there, but sometimes it's not so overt. Even if I'm writing about something personal, I think you'll have an idea of a larger message if you listen for it. It's there, but I've gotta get some stuff off my chest for 20 minutes at a time."
Hardcore,3duv84,Alergic2Victory,4,Mon Jul 20 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of what Scott says rings true for us older hardcore fans. Much of these changes are from the increase of the internet and social media. It has deluted the scene. Instead of the quality of your music and what you represent, it's image and marketing that creates a popular band. When Hatebreed started blowing up concerts got a little weird. They would be missing hardcore bands and metal bands together. He's the shows would usually be a trainwreck. Even though both Slayer and Earth Crisis are heavy there a message and their fans are quite different. At these shows there would be a plethora of fights or close to it. Back then there is a clear distinction between metal, punk and hardcore shows. There were different expectations of you as a fan in each of those scenes. What was ok in one scene might not be acceptable in another. What you have now is a bunch of scenes without a distinct personality. They have all melted into each other."
Hardcore,3duv84,tlahwm1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"That's been my experience as well. My experiences at hardcore shows can be put into 2 categories: before Hatebreed and after Hatebreed. Before, it was all hardcore bands. After, it was a mix of all types of metal and hardcore and it was a cool, but weird, type of show. Seeing hardcore bands play for Dimmu Borgir and Cannibal Corpse definitely was interesting."
Hardcore,3duv84,BobSacamanosSynapses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"The quality isn't diluted if you look in the right places, at least where i'm from. Personally i dig that where i'm from people from different scenes have started to collaborate, it has yielded some interesting results musically as well as a community which is active and engaged and a little bigger than any of the scenes seperated. Staying in your own niche is fine but stepping out of your comfort zone can be way more rewarding. We have more venues, more people recording and doing distros/labels and doing bands and generally more going on for such a small city."
Hardcore,3duv84,ClydeFrawg,2,Mon Jul 20 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"I always though if you started a hardcore band you wrote songs about things that mattered and were relevant to you and your band. Whether it be work, school, social issues, or religious beliefs. You should be in a band and play the music YOU want for whatever reason YOU choose. Too many are upset nowadays when an album drops and it's not what they wanted or expected.  Too bad, it's not your band. Don't like it, make your own music."
Hardcore,3duv84,drewxdeficit,4,Mon Jul 20 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"That last sentence is the most important part of what hardcore is. The cornerstone is that anyone can do it.

Hardcore,3dua2j,Reggie-a,23,Sun Jul 19 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"How do you know you're not racist?  And saying ""all lives matter"" isn't wrong, but it's often said as a rebuttal of sorts of ""black lives matter."" The problem here is that when we're trying to talk about institutionalized racism, specifically anti-black racism, trying to switch the topic away (usually to include white people) is an example of racism. It's just as asshole a move as going to a cancer fundraiser and yelling that all diseases matter. Nobody's saying they don't, we're just focused on this particular one right now."
Hardcore,3dua2j,anarchoqueer,9,Sun Jul 19 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I thought the same thing like ""Wait, why do people care if they assert that all lives matter"" but hearing explained like this makes perfect sense, thank you. Honestly I think a lot of people are having a knee jerk defensive response to the ""Black Lives Matter"" because they see it as a divide between them and others, and I think theyre just confused. For sure there are some racists involved in saying this stuff, but I wanna be optimistic and think that most people saying ""All Lives Matter"" are just confused and reactionary"
Hardcore,3dua2j,ProspectSean,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"It may be that way for some people but not all. I just see it as a rallying call more than a movement.   Like how post Freddie Gray, Baltimore had the worst month for homicides in 40 years. Yet no one was saying anything about that or those black lives. Chicago continues to have soaring black on black violence. It is a knee jerk reaction because these things prove that the black community as a whole apparently doesn't believe in black lives matter and calling people racist for saying all lives matter is incredible divisive."
Hardcore,3dua2j,ClydeFrawg,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:36 2015 UTC,"So you would rather throw all other races (I'm ""latino"" for example) under the bus because ""black lives matter""?  So we're just supposed to ignore police brutality, murder, and abuse when it happens to anyone other than black people?  Are we just supposed to be silent about it?  I can tell you first hand, cops hassle latino communities in different ways than they do black communities but they still fuck with us.  Am I not allowed to say ""all lives matter""?  I can't participate in an anti-police movement on my own terms?  I should have to put my own struggles to the side because what?  Because black people?  Fuck that identity politics shit!  If you listen to what he was saying, he was saying that cops recently killed several people there in Canada who were other than black.  The point being that cop's abuses aren't limited to black people.  Yes, there is a very important point to be made that cops do disproportionately affect black folks but the fact that a white person sees that struggle as important to him and his experiences as a white person enough to say and do something about it is called solidarity not fucking racism.  Get the fuck off of tumblr and lay off the bullshit freshman collage social justice garbage.  That shit will rot your brains."

Hardcore,3dua2j,anarchoqueer,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with the ""black lives matter"" is that as a normal white male I have no stake in the issue. I'm against racism but if we're not going to be all-inclusive, there's less of a benefit for me and thus less reason for me to get behind the movement. It's like comparing anti-male ""feminists"" versus feminists who are about equality for everyone. Saying ""all lives matter"" is an asshole thing to say, especially in response to someone saying ""black lives matter"", but there has to be another, better phrase to get behind here."

If you want a diverse movement against the police, then fuck off with the identity politics or stay in your ideological ghetto.    No one is speaking above black voices.  Those voices matter because they are telling us what we don't see.  Shit that goes on in their communities all the time.

Regardless of your evaluations of the term, it certainly still holds its weight in our culture. Also see Foucault's idea of the panopticon for similar/related concepts.  And because people obsessed with calling people ""SJWs"" are usually the sort of /r/TumblrInAction or /r/MensRights crowd espousing incredibly unnuanced views on any matters sociological, psychological, philosophical, ethical, etc. in order to casually dismiss any contrasting viewpoints as ""tumblr SJW bullshit"". Most people who seriously get upset about ""social justice warriors"" probably aren't worth listening to, nor their viewpoints worth considering.

Then wouldn't that also include, by extension, ""SJWs"" doing their thing without regard for anybody else under the purview of hardcore?  It seems more like what you're getting at is ""to me, hardcore is about people who think and act like me doing what ever the fuck we want, fuck everybody else.""  Which I mean, you're entitled to feel that way, but I'm not sure how you can accuse a group of people of doing hardcore wrong in one breath and then say ""hardcore is about doing whatever the fuck you want,"" in an other.  Either punk and hardcore is an umbrella for anything and everything or it's  not in fact about doing whatever you want, but it can't be about doing whatever you want until I don't like what you're doing."
Hardcore,3dua2j,ClydeFrawg,-9,Sun Jul 19 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're projecting.  Yes, I do mean they can also say whatever they want, but this is hardcore so don't get offended if someone says something you don't like, especially when it could have been much worse than all lives matter. Hardcore is about doing whatever you want. Posi bands can scream acceptance and inclusiveness all they want but listen to OLC pure disgust, that's hardcore and doesn't sound very inclusive.   My point being hardcore is a genre with a lot of different types of people. It's stupid to expect a whole genre's fanbase to turn on some guy for saying something positive just apparently not PC."
Hardcore,3dua2j,slayeryouth,8,Sun Jul 19 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm projecting much.  I just think it's a bit much to say ""SJWs are ruining hardcore"" and ""hardcore is about doing whatever you want.""  Full disclosure though: I've never been too jazzed on the idea that punk and hardcore should exist as a space for anyone and everyone and that if you're going to have this anything goes mentality then you also need to accept that everybody is going to be alienating somebody.  It doesn't need to be some elitist club, but it doesn't need to exist for everyone and anyone either. Now for the record, as far this Chokehold thing goes, I think both sides are wrong but that as a rule the person who punches people is generally wronger.  I also think that call out culture is pretty counter productive in terms of encouraging dialogue, and more often than not about dumb political posturing.  From the audio recording it seems pretty apparent that what they said was in good faith but misguided and out of touch and the reasonable thing to do would have been to approach them for an actual conversation instead of snarky heckling and name calling.  But on the other hand, if you're going to get violent and expect to come out of it the good guy, you're going to have a bad time.  I also think that the current righteous indignation directed at the band is kind of silly.  Like if people want to stop listening to them that's fine, but I'm seriously rolling my eyes at people who think that deleting the MP3s they downloaded for free or flipping their merch on eBay has any impact on anything."

Hardcore,3dua2j,whatauniqueopinion,5,Mon Jul 20 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you but Hardcore was really based on fighting racism, and other thing that you call ""SJW"". While in other genres it's easier to say to just focus on the music, a lot of people can't do that with Hardcore because the message is so tightly woven into everything about the bands. That's why a lot of people are so offended over this remark, because what he said is used VERY often by racists when the topic of police brutality faced by the African Americans, and the phrase ""black lives matter"" is brought up. People are reacting to it so heavily because racism has a long history of being in these harder genres of music and people want to fight it because it often breeds hate and more violence."
Hardcore,3dua2j,ClydeFrawg,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:05:12 2015 UTC,You say it 'was' based as if that has any relevance to the majority of hardcore today.   I say that some had spray painted black lives matter on a Christopher Columbus statue in Boston when the man never set foot in north america. They need to tone it down. Not everything needs to be a race issue. It's there we get it but you can't call someone racist for saying he doesn't think that just because black deaths are more prevalent in the news that other lives aren't.

This reddit lacktivisim and idea of not focusing too hard on an artists political beliefs that i see more often than not throughout reddit, and all over this thread is incredibly annoying. The simple fact of the matter is that what he said is used very often by racists and definitely has received a racist connotation.

Also, the term ""race-baiting"" is used almost exclusivly by the reactionaries and new school racists that you see online and I fail to see how speaking out about what can be perceived as racist is race-baiting."

Obviously that's not to support punching people, but I'm not really sure how much I understand the idea of going to see a band from a different era and then getting surprised when they talk and behave like they're from a different era.   I think a lot of it comes down to kids projecting their own sensibilities onto their favourite bands (and hardcore in general) and then inevitably feeling let down.  I think a lot of it also comes down bands and people from past eras assuming that hardcore's remained static over the years and not knowing how to navigate the scene today.

Totally feels like a cash-in, and if you read all their interviews prior to the records release, you can kind of tell they knew it was a sub par record.  Tbh, if this record had been anything but a ""REFUSED"" record, I doubt anyone would rag on it as hard as some people are ragging on it. But I doubt anyone would of given it a listen, either."
Hardcore,3dr55w,HearshotAtomDisaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:23 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they realized how much money they could make touring as a reason to get back together in the first place.
Hardcore,3dr55w,carpisxxx,5,Sat Jul 18 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I can get behind them touring ""just cause"". I could even get behind a band touring to cash in on the legion of fans that never had a chance to see them for whatever reason. What I can't get behind is a great band putting out a crap record just as an excuse to cash in. It ends up tainting their legacy, which granted is totally theirs to taint. I expect shit like that from the Rolling Stones or Aerosmith."

Hardcore,3dewnp,Madvices,7,Wed Jul 15 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"Beatdown is a very varied genre and my knowledge of UK beatdown is pretty good but oversees, I only really know the biggest names. The so called originators of the genre are people like Bulldoze and Terror's song Stick Tight  More on the Hardcore side of things you have bands like Malevolence although they are more commonly classed as metallic hardcore they do have some beatdowns in there. There are also a really good band who are quite local to me who are playing their last few shows together called Basilisk (a live video is all I could find, sorry).   On to the more straight up beatdown, you have some amazing bands like Nasty, Cold Hard Truth, and, I have to mention them, Desolated. If you like any of the bands mentioned, give their other stuff a listen and if you want funny, very aggressive beatdown, check out Malevolence and Desolated's side project Gunishment.  Now on to the heavy end. This is where the crossover with slam comes in, with bands like Sentenced, Contagion, and I've even heard bands like Xibalba described as beatdown.  I have to also give a shoutout to /r/BeatdownHC and just a reminder that there are so many awesome bands I haven't mentioned like Curbstomp SCBD (cheesy but pretty good), Machete 187, No Zodiac, No Altars, Solemn Promise, Betray Your King and a pretty small band local to me that I like called Built Upon Hatred (they have an awesome single out at the minute called The Faults in My Peers). Hope this helps."

Hardcore,3dewnp,satan-says-meow,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"No worries. Beatdown shows are something else though. If you live in the UK, there is a very healthy beatdown community in most cities but especially around the midlands. If you are wanting to properly get into beatdown, I can only advise you to watch a lot of pit videos before you go. I reccommend the Skintfest video. It's a good video and shows a typical beatdown pit."
Hardcore,3dewnp,nukestrike96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"Terror's Stick Tight originating Beatdown? Damn that's edgy. Beatdown has been around for decades, and Terror has got nothing to do with it. But all the other bands you mentioned are pretty spot on. Don't forget to check Drowning, Providence, Cunthunt 777, The Last Charge, xViciousx and Knocked Loose."
Hardcore,3dewnp,satan-says-meow,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from but Terror embraced the beatdown style with Stick Tight and introduced it to a much wider audience. So, maybe originating wasn't the right word but popularized. Knocked Loose and Cunthunt 777 are amazing, can't believe I forgot about them. Haven't heard of those other bands but I'll check them out. Another few bands I forgot are other SCBD bands of which there are lots, Grove Street Families on the hardcore side of things and Stab from Belgium who I am off to see next week with Contagion."
Hardcore,3dewnp,nukestrike96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yea ok, the song is heavy, but that's all. They're definitely not a beatdown band.  GSF is nice, and STAB is sick, saw them once with Your Demise 2004 (with George Noble), and they did put on a sick show. Also just remembered about Warhound and Pallass, both bands that are amazing live. Isolationist from NC, USA aren't that bad either and Back Down from the UK have just released one of the best EP's of 2015 and even tho it's not really beatdown, it's way closer to it than Terror :P"
Hardcore,3dewnp,satan-says-meow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll check them all out. I forgot to mention Revelations from Chesterfield and Gassed Up who mix beatdown with grime, it really shouldn't work but it does."
Hardcore,3dewnp,nukestrike96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"If those are the Revelations I'm thinking about, yea they're cool, but it's kind of a Malev rip-off. Never heard of Gassed Up, but I'll give them a listen, I dig some grime."
Hardcore,3dewnp,satan-says-meow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they are the same Revelations, when I saw them live they didn't sound too much like Malev, they sounded more heavy and they put on a hell of a show too. Gassed Up are awesome, check out Gas in the Attic on their bandcamp."
Hardcore,3dewnp,nukestrike96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Yea, I just looked it up and they're from Chesterfield indeed so, same band I suppose. https://revelationstheband.bandcamp.com/ Those riffs sound like Malev leftovers with some slam breakdowns thrown in randomly hahah The guy even sounds like a weaker Alex...

""Bliss Beach,"" for instance, tells the tale of the Times Beach catastrophe from the point of view of Russell Bliss, who Webb feels was a patsy during that canard of local history.

Hardcore,3d78mz,Biaswords_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:02:08 2015 UTC,In all fairness this particular style WAS the 90s / early 00s
Hardcore,3d78mz,oscar9909,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true, but you would expect some more bands to continue that sound."
Hardcore,3d78mz,Biaswords_,3,Tue Jul 14 13:04:48 2015 UTC,Everything in hardcore always repeats itself. Youth Crew came and went again and now 90s metalcore is around. I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a lot of Earth Crisis worship bands popup in the near future
Hardcore,3d78mz,oscar9909,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:38 2015 UTC,I hope so
Hardcore,3d78mz,Suspiciousoldlady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"Agree, that's why i posted here to hopefully find some new ones."

Hardcore,3d78mz,imranorchid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:49:21 2015 UTC,"you guys should check out Hessian, not on the list but they're amazing. They're still pretty small though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCM6UsnBkao"
Hardcore,3d78mz,xStevestabbedaguyx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:02:22 2015 UTC,You should really check out Malevolence from the UK. They are a really heavy hardcore band with a big metal influence. They are pretty big in the UK but pretty unknown elsewhere (I have been told). They have beatdown sections too
Hardcore,3d78mz,passive_sinner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:18:25 2015 UTC,Solid list! Throw in Day of Suffering and I'm moshing.
Hardcore,3d78mz,Skinbeater,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"A few other bands worth checking are Bonedance, Of Feather and Bone, Pulling Teeth, Hierophant, Rise and Fall, and Harms Way."

Hardcore,3cyi09,selfcontortion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:26:36 2015 UTC,I don't think I could ever see this band enough.

Hardcore,3cwalk,samsaBEAR,7,Sat Jul 11 10:20:54 2015 UTC,Thanks man!  We just dropped a couple of tracks. New UK hardcore band. First time ever actually writing hardcore so hope you guys enjoy!  https://barfightuk.bandcamp.com/releases

Hardcore,3cw0oj,UnChienAndYou,2,Sat Jul 11 06:22:27 2015 UTC,It's my (extremely unpopular) opinion that BTAT is miles ahead of YOT
Hardcore,3cw0oj,garbagemask,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:18:14 2015 UTC,I'm with you there. Just One and Value Driven are just great.
Hardcore,3cw0oj,x__x,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:44:36 2015 UTC,Man I go kind of back and forth on this. For me it just boils down to the fact that in general I listen to heavier and more aggro stuff (in terms of sound) more often then I do more melodic stuff so I end up liking Youth of Today better most of the time just because they are more raw but no less positive. I would say that on a song by song basis BTAT is better by in general YOT is better
Hardcore,3cw0oj,rocktogether,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"I see the argument that BTAT is a better band, but YOT is just classic and holds a larger part in my heart."
Hardcore,3cvual,jufakrn,4,Sat Jul 11 05:05:48 2015 UTC,I feel like this album isn't getting nearly enough credit. I've been jamming on it so hard

Hardcore,3cu8x4,mac_mcmac,6,Fri Jul 10 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that SFTP will be the next RATM but they'll destroy their 'image' before they get that following. So much energy live, just too many 'juvenile' lyrics to get the respect they deserve."
Hardcore,3cu8x4,bleedingfingaz,4,Sat Jul 11 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm overreacting, but I see a lot of people on Facebook love the 'Germany in '42 line', but I can't help but feel comparing the American police force to Nazi Germany is a little OTT."
Hardcore,3cu8x4,samsaBEAR,6,Sat Jul 11 12:21:33 2015 UTC,Anyone have any idea what this song could be about?
Hardcore,3cu8x4,ManTheWombat,3,Sat Jul 11 11:11:38 2015 UTC,lol the original lineup went to my school. solid dudes.
Hardcore,3cu8x4,isetmyfriendsonfire,2,Sun Jul 12 08:26:01 2015 UTC,I don't think they have a clear understanding of what Germany was like in 1942. We certainly aren't living in the same culture or political climate.

Hardcore,3cswp5,jaycooob,2,Fri Jul 10 20:52:44 2015 UTC,Honestly though. I've been stoked for this album to come out for so long. They did not disappoint. Some of the best riffs of any hardcore band.
