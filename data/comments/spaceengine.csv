The current Rift for sale is a developer kit ($350), I would advise not to get this as the commercial version of the Rift is coming out in Q1 2016.  It'll be better in every respect.  There will be a pair of motion tracked controllers called Oculus Touch that'll go on sale separately in Q2 2016.  The cost of either unit hasn't been announced yet but they have said that they are aiming for the same kind of price as the previous development kits, but don't be suprised if it's a little more.  The HTC Vive goes on sale in Q4 2015 and includes two motion tracked wands, however HTC have been quoted to say it'll cost 'a little more' than the Oculus.  Headset wise the Rift and the Vive are virtually identical at the moment (it's possible the specs of one or both may change prior to their respective releases.    We'll find out the final missing pieces for the Rift (cost, pre-order date, final specs) during Oculus Connect 2 in late September, and we'll find out the final design, specs and price for Vive in October (TBA).    Finally, both the Rift and the Vive is going to need a monster of a PC to play it: the Rift's recommended specs are Intel i5, GTX 970 and 8Gb RAM.  The number one requirement for VR is a PC capable of maintaining 90fps as us humans are particularly sensitive to latency and lag.  TL;DR: Don't go near the Rift dev kits this close to release, hold off until October to find out the final details of both headsets to decide which is the right one for you, and make sure your PC is up to spec!"

spaceengine,3d5j9x,baudtack,13,Mon Jul 13 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"its spinning so rapidly that it's become very oblate, most likely due to the gravitational pull of the other star. The bulges are because the inner heat makes gasses in the outer corona bulge out and fluff up. Giant stars are so ""fluffy"" they aren't very dense. They're so light in fact that the outer corona is more like a red, hot vacuum.  Wikipedia page for Betelgeuse Red Giant   The supergiant consistently displays irregular photometric, polarimetric and spectroscopic variations, phenomena pointing to complex activity on the star's surface and its extended atmosphere.[36] Martin Schwarzschild in 1975 attributed these brightness fluctuations to the changing granulation pattern formed by a few giant convection cells covering the surface of these stars.[40][62] For the Sun, these convection cells, known as solar granules, represent the foremost mode of heat transferâhence those convective elements dominate the brightness variations in the solar photosphere.[40] The typical diameter for a solar granule is about 2000 km (a surface area roughly the size of India), with an average depth of 700 km. With a surface of roughly 6 trillion km2, there are about 2 million such granules on the Sun's photosphere, and this large number produces a relatively constant flux.[63] By contrast, Schwarzschild argues that stars like Betelgeuse may only have a dozen granules with diameters of 180 million kilometers or more dominating the surface of the star with depths of about 60 million kilometers, which, due to the low temperatures and extremely low density found in red supergiant envelopes, result in convective inefficiency. Consequently, if only a third of these convective cells are visible at any one time, the variations in their observable light emission may result in the recorded irregular brightness variations of the overall light from the star.[40] The hypothesis that gigantic convection cells dominate the surface of red giants and supergiants remains accepted by the astronomical community. When the Hubble Space Telescope captured its first direct image of Betelgeuse in 1995 revealing a mysterious hot spot, astronomers attributed it to convection.[64] Two years later, astronomers observed intricate asymmetries in the brightness distribution of the star, revealing at least three bright spots, the magnitude of which was ""consistent with convective surface hotspots.""[37] In 2000, another team of astronomers, led by Alex Lobel of the HarvardâSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, noted that Betelgeuse exhibits raging storms of hot and cold gas in its turbulent atmosphere. The team surmised that large areas of the star's photosphere bulge out in different directions at times, ejecting long plumes of warm gas into the cold dust envelope. Another explanation is the occurrence of shock waves caused by warm gas traversing cooler regions of the star.[61][65] Observing the atmosphere of Betelgeuse over a period of five years between 1998 and 2003 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard Hubble, the team likened the rise and fall of convection cells in the chromosphere to the blobs in a lava lamp.[65]"

Hit editor, one of the buttons on the top right corner will be ""export script"" click it. Now exit space engine.  Go into your space engine folder /exports. The script should be here as a word or notepad file, I use wordpad myself. Rename the file to whatever you want. Open it, here you'll find all the configurable parameters. First rename the planet to something other than the RS number. Then give it a parent body of a named catalogued star, not an RS star. When we're done the planet will appear orbiting this star.  Scroll down into the physical descriptions until you see the color codes. Here you'll see something that looks like ""colorBiome (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)"". This is where you can paint your planet. The first three numbers are always between 0 and 1 and represent red green and blue. Just google ""lsl colors chart"" and find a color chart. The last number I believe determines how reflective the surface is but I'm not entirely sure.  Once you have your planet configured how you want it save it as yourplanet.sc to SpaceEngine0.973/catalogs/planets. If there isn't a planets folder in your catalogs then you'll have to make it by right clicking and making a new folder. Go into your config folder and open universe.cfg. Scroll until you see PlanetsCatalog // planets catalogs. Add ""catalogs/planets/yourplanet.sc"" to the list of planet catalogs.  There you go.

spaceengine,3cmi89,Bells_Theorem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:16:24 2015 UTC,That seems to be the easiest solution for now! Thank you!
spaceengine,3ckpxh,_invoker,3,Wed Jul 8 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Had a very similar experience when I found it. I've been using it look up stars and learn about their life cycle. I pick out random points of light and visit then do research on what I find. If I find a B0 I star, I try to find out what what means and align it with the information provided. If I find a named object, research what it is and whatever else. Next step is getting a good telescope and going out and exploring some of the things I find in game."
spaceengine,3ckpxh,PiaJr,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:15 2015 UTC,God this game makes me want to help get humans colonizing other worlds really bad.
spaceengine,3ckpxh,murrypurryfurryfury,2,Fri Jul 10 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I just found this program a friggin week ago, I have been geekin out on it ever since, runs pretty well on my i5  GTX 750ti.  Trying to explain this program to people is difficult to really get the awesomeness across, I've gotten several blank stares and ""uhh - huh"", you just have to see it for yourself and realize how much detail and vastness there is to explore.  Wish there was an easy way to put it on Android but don't think it would even be the same, really got to try it on a full wall projector!  Still kind of blows my mind I can pick out an entire galaxy out of the whole universe, zone in on a single star system, and check out an asteroid orbiting one of its planet's moons!  Hope they are able to put more detail on surfaces and display more detailed life in the future"
spaceengine,3ckpxh,net403,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:14:37 2015 UTC,It's inspired me to start doing some video editing. Hopefully it will be something I will continue.
spaceengine,3ckpxh,Bells_Theorem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:10:58 2015 UTC,"If you haven't picked out a scope yet, I strongly recommend getting the largest Dobsonian you can afford. They are generally excellent and less dollar per aperture inch than refractors. And then you don't also have to drop a ton on a good mount. I have an 8 inch Orion SkyQuest and can't recommend it enough. Also research what to expect with whatever you get so you won't expect something your scope can't possibly do and then be disappointed.   Also get a pair of like 10x50 binoculars. They really help with learning the sky and spotting when you're having problems. And are a pretty cheap way Rio get started as fast as possible."

spaceengine,3cl2hh,Bells_Theorem,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"It might be that Space Engine has a limited terrain color selection by default. You can find some better, bigger selections on the forum, in the mods & addons section. :)"
spaceengine,3cil9h,OM3N1R,4,Wed Jul 8 04:51:02 2015 UTC,How did one person make this thing? It is completely beyond anything I have ever witnessed.   So. Beautiful. No words. Should have sent a poet.
spaceengine,3cil9h,_invoker,2,Wed Jul 8 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"While it's impressive work for one person's work, most of the planets you see in SE is randomly formed by the simulator.   Also, I know how that feels. It's like installing a fresh copy of Skyrim and the game automatically sets your graphics to Ultra."
spaceengine,3cil9h,Bells_Theorem,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"I know it's procedurally generated. It's the fact that the procedural generation is so beautiful, diverse and efficient that is amazing. Every Vista is a painting."
spaceengine,3cil9h,ExtraNoise,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:13:54 2015 UTC,They are actually formed non randomly. Procedural generation is a non random process and the results are completely and static dependent on starting seed values.
