It probably needs a lot of time and thinking to come at least close to an answer. Most people on a realtionship break have fluctuating feelings, bpd works like an amplifier in that situation. In my opinion, open conversations could help to make it clear what both of you are feeling, maybe you can find a way to go from there on? It would be a bad idea to accept your situation and to stay in it bc of financial issues, but that's probably not the primary issue. I think it's important to find out what you really want, not just from your boyfriend but from your life in general...even if it takes a while to figure it out."

BPD,3dzrwi,thatguyfromnewyork,4,Tue Jul 21 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like calling him a lazy arsehole wasn't a joke, because the comment was laced with seriousness and you felt anger because he chose a sleep day over you. Pretending something was a joke when you're in truth angry over it is being emotionally manipulative.  When you ask someone to do something, they are allowed to say no. If you get upset and angry, then you're not really asking but more demanding/telling them to do something, which is different.   He is tired and scheduled sleep over seeing you - some people need their sleep to function and covet a long sleep in.  Some people do act differently when they are tired or have had a bad day, both BPDs and NONs are guilty of this. I only know a select few people who are completely even tempered no matter their day or energy level."
BPD,3dzrwi,YoungJolie,2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:00 2015 UTC,I wasn't really pretending it was a joke. I was half joking and half annoyed. I would never call him something like that 100% seriously. The problem is he can come over and sleep more in my bed or I can go to his house and we can sleep more in his bed. He's still sleeping whether I'm involved or not. I have already apologised to him for calling him that.  I have really bad stomach problems because of my meds almost every day and I don't let it affect how I treat anyone. I may be whiny because it hurts but I'm not mean when it happens.  He always chooses ridiculous amounts of sleep over me and it's really frustrating.

Also, if he works with the public, talks a lot at work, it is possible he needed some downtime/quiet.    I think you're reading too much into his quest for sleep.  I know it's hard, but step back and breathe."
BPD,3dzrwi,jogden2015,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:22 2015 UTC,Like I asked him to come over Tuesday when it was still Sunday and he automatically assumed he was going to be sleeping in all day.

I am continually frustrated with how he has been treating me differently when he's tired or had a bad day.   It couldn't have been too much of a joke if you're frustrated with the actions that made you say it.  Have you communicated to him about your feelings on him doing this?  How would you feel if he called you the equivalent if you were having a down/depressing day and he didn't like your attitude?  Would you take it as a joke or would your mind begin to wander on what could cause such a statement and start to grow into animosity or being offended by it?   I ask these latter questions in observation of what your relationship dynamics are.  Is he used to you poking fun at him with such things, so he doesn't take offense, or does it sting him a little but he doesn't say anything as to not make the situation worse."
BPD,3dzrwi,I_am_chris_dorner,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"I told him how it makes me feel and I don't think anything changed.

BPD,3dx4qw,Goth_Annie,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! My ex used to encourage my writing, it's a part of myself  that I thought I lost when I lost him. So your words mean an awful lot :)   And yeah, when I first moved into this place I used to make risotto with fresh stuff from the farmer's market, and had a job. But I was still very heartbroken, so I guess not that much has changed."
BPD,3dx4qw,jojoet,2,Mon Jul 20 08:42:46 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I didn't know I could relate to a recipe this much. Thank you for posting that, made me chuckle and get feels at the same time."
BPD,3dxyop,fuckmeanywayuwant,2,Mon Jul 20 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"Psychologically speaking, if it worries you, talk to a shrink about it.  Otherwise, and this comes from someone who used to be afraid of what they were into, and sex in general:  Sex is fun. It's enjoyable. And as long as it's safe and between two consenting adults, what you include in sex is up to the both of you.  Yes, you may have a type, or something you look for so embrace your fetishes. You are more than what turns you on.  Being self aware is great, but once you admit you like it then it becomes about enjoyment and you can really find your limits.  I repeat again. Be. Safe.  Until I was 24 I didn't have sex with emotions. So I kept very strict rules. For me they were    Always use protection, Always be somewhere you feel safe, Always have a safe word. (Especially if it's rough, bdsm, or any type of power/control based play) Always be honest. (About who you are and what you want)   Number four is a big one. It's fun to play into the emotional high of the sex. And as a guy with bpd playing the Casanova who sweeps someone off their feet in an emotional tidal wave makes me feel like a god. So I always said I didn't want a relationship, just sex, and I stuck to it, the second they started thinking otherwise, cut it off."
BPD,3dxyop,Destac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I remember having the same question as you do and, for some reason, a lot of people told me to not have sex reasoning that I obviously was not emotionally equipped to handle it at the moment because sex is supposed to be such a big deal. Whatever.  I ended up not having sex with randoms although I came pretty close a few times, and now that I think about it, I am glad I didn't because I, at some point for sure, would get paranoid about stds despite using protection and/or paranoid about some of the guys stalking me afterwards (I know, I know, a bit crazy, but you don't tell your paranoia what to think lol...).  And now it turned out (through therapy) that I wanted all the random sex to reiterate for myself that sex means nothing and by that diminish the 'significance' of abuse I experienced. As in, then it was not by choice and now it's essentially the same activity only by my own free will - kinda rationalizing that it's not that bad or smth. I still don't think it's such a bad thing to have random sex, if anything, I secretly envy people who have random sex and I think I will definitely do that sooner or later.  Anyway, my point is, such encounters can actually lead to retraumatization (my case), so one has to be careful and mindful of one's emotions throughout. One of the times I almost had such random sex, I realized that I actually froze and my heartbeat went up in an anxious and not excited way and I said we should stop and I left, the guy was a bit pissed (more like humiliated on the inside, probably) and I even at one point felt for him but then I thought DUDE, you have been right there with me and could've noticed all the lack of enthusiasm! So listen to yourself and put yourself first. If you just like random sex, then like random sex, and if I try to use random sex to other end (relive my trauma), I should probably seek therapy for that and not pretend I just like random sex...:)"
BPD,3dzeq3,tosh123no,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:35 2015 UTC,this has absolutely nothing to do with bpd. your girlfriend is an individual independent from you and is entitled to have her own opinions/perspectives/interactions. not all men are rapists.
BPD,3dzeq3,vespertine_vulpes,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:12:20 2015 UTC,I guess i will just stand by while men try and rape her...
BPD,3dx1xg,Cillianonymous,4,Mon Jul 20 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone with BPD, trust me when i say what she is feeling is most probably a trait from the illness. We doubt ourselves and most often don't feel like we are deserving of 'love' even if that's all we crave, as we tend to be self destructive, almost always unintentionally.  The best advice i can give is to just be there for her when she needs you, instead of saying it, find ways to show it and try to accept that she may often have these worrying thoughts that you may not love her, but most of the time they pass and we realize how irrational we have acted, but only AFTER the episode has ended.  Just be there for her, and if she needs the re-assurance, find small gestures to show it to remind her that you'll always be there for her."
BPD,3dx1xg,NAWilliams92,3,Mon Jul 20 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"You're an absolute sweetheart. :) I don't know if this will help your girlfriend, but I know for me it helps to have a lot of (small) material gifts (cards, flowers, stuffed animals etc.) that I can look at and hold even when the person isn't there.  The cards especially - if you can just write what you've written above in the second person...that would absolutely melt my heart if someone told me that. Unfortunately my current SO doesn't have a ""traditionally romantic"" bone in his body, and it stresses me out so much.  I've only just realised that it's a part of BPD and the 'object permanence' thing.  I thought I was just a demanding, high-maintenance bitch.  (Well, I may be those things, but at least there's an underlying cause...)  ETA: It sounds like you guys have such fantastic open communication; I'm sure you can ask her what would help her to believe you.  She may not know, but it's worth asking. :)"
BPD,3dx1xg,blauerosen,3,Mon Jul 20 08:06:00 2015 UTC,"Can't reiterate what u/blauerosen has said enough. My SO bought me and him one of those necklace pairs with the half heart on each and they fit together. We both wear them every day, even though they were just cheap tat and they've gone discoloured, it means the world to me. I also have a ring that he bought me (not an engagement ring, we're just boyfriend and girlfriend at the moment and I don't wear it on my ring finger) but I never, ever take it off unless I'm doing something really messy like making cookie dough. That really helps me to feel close to him. I know it sounds lame, but I have really bad issues with object permanence and before we were living together it felt like I only had a part time boyfriend and he didn't even exist on the days I didn't see him, which really messed with my head. And we talked online a lot and texted a lot so it's not like we weren't in contact.  Anyway, good luck. You sound like you're really willing to help and put in the effort and that means a lot."
BPD,3dx1xg,NekoStorm,2,Mon Jul 20 09:29:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for the ideas everyone.  I think we'll get skully and mulder rings

BPD,3dx1xg,SRPayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you can't make her feel a certain way. If she feels that you don't love her even when you go out of your way to prove it, then you can't make her feel that way. I bet you really do love her."
BPD,3dwp0n,crazylostunreal,5,Mon Jul 20 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel like this is something people do. I don't have bpd but only like once every twenty times me and my friends plan on hanging out do we actually hang out (hope thay makes sense, I worded it weird.) It might also be because I'm a newer friend to them idk.  With your boyfriend, what do you mean by rarely talking to you? Like has he not talked to you at all in the past three days?"
BPD,3dwp0n,throwawaythract,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:10 2015 UTC,"I mean I wouldn't care so much if they didn't make such a big deal about how much they miss me because we never talk or hang out anymore even though I'll text them and get no response 99% of the time. I know things come up, but it's literally every time.   He'll talk to me, but it'll be like ""okay hi, I'm doing this, sorry work sucks, I'm gonna go play video games for the next 10 hours bye."" Normally he'll text me throughout the day, but lately I'm lucky if he'll text me for like 20 minutes. Idk."
BPD,3dwp0n,throwawaythract,2,Mon Jul 20 04:56:03 2015 UTC,"How do they make a big deal out of missing you?  And with your bf, maybe he just doesn't want to talk. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong or that's in you in particular he doesn't want to talk to, he might just want some time to himself. As long as he's still talking to you somewhat and hasn't been completely ignoring you for 3 days I would try not to worry too much."
BPD,3dwp0n,throwawaythract,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"The one friend texted me earlier this week like ""omg I need some crazylostunreal in my life, I miss your face!"" kinda stuff. And then we make plans, and the day comes and goes without so much as a response to a text, and their snapchat story is full of pictures and videos of them with other friends.  I don't know it's just weird and frustrating to me because he won't tell me anything and we normally spend some time together but he has never really told me he wants me to come over or anything, it's more I'll be like ""hey cool do you care if I come over"" and he's like fine whatever. Idk I feel like he doesn't really want to be with me anymore."
BPD,3dwp0n,throwawaythract,4,Mon Jul 20 05:05:18 2015 UTC,"This might be a stupid question but on the day you're supposed to hang out do you text them and say something like ""Are we still hanging out today?"" That's usually what I have to do even though I hate it because I feel like I'm being pushy.  And that's a tricky spot with your bf because if you stopped being the one who asked to hang out he might think you don't want to. I think you should see how things work out for maybe the next 3 days and then try to get him to ask, even if he's not really asking. Like ask if he wants to hang out the next day and if he says yes tell him to text you at a good time. Then slowly try to get him to start asking first (but not directly)."
BPD,3dwp0n,JunkieSuiBunny,2,Mon Jul 20 05:12:37 2015 UTC,"I just texted her a quick ""hey"" and never got a response. Which happens a lot when I text her, especially if we're supposed to hang out. I probably would've chalked it up as her having lost her phone again except she posted a facebook status from mobile like 5 minutes later. So there's that.   I've tried that before. I usually spend like 3 nights in a row there and when I leave for work I'm usually like ""do you want me to come back tonight or would you rather I go home after, I don't mind either way"" because I really don't and the only thing I ever get is ""I don't care, it's up to you"" which makes me feel like I'm just kind of showing up at his house and I'm not really wanted there? I don't know, it bothers the everloving shit out of me that he can't just be like ""yes I want you to come back."" Like I feel like that's not asking for much. I don't know."
BPD,3dwp0n,JunkieSuiBunny,3,Mon Jul 20 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well you're not really asking for anything. It doesn't sound like he knows you want him to straight up ask you, it sounds like he doesn't want to bother you so he let's you decide."
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:30 2015 UTC,I mean I've talked to him about it before he just kinda brushes it off.
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,2,Mon Jul 20 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry you've had such bad responses on this thread, OP. I'd be really hurt if I was in your position.   You totally have a right to feel bad - maybe you could bring this up to your friends? Sometimes it can feel way too awkward, though, especially when it feels like you care about 'this stuff' more than other people do. That doesn't mean your feelings aren't valid. They might well have a perfectly good reason (or just 'lol, ditzy~'), but that doesn't make it not hurt your feelings, you know? It's kind of jerk behaviour, even if it's unintentional.   The boyfriend thing would really bother me too. I feel like I need reassurance that people I care about need me around, and that kind of behaviour is kind of the opposite of that. Maybe he's just bad at expressing himself, or doesn't realize how much of an effect it has on you... But I know I'd feel really hurt if I was always asking if my partner wanted me there and their response was 'shrug whatever, if you want to be', and didn't seek out my company. Especially if they also had time to do a lot of other things like play video games. Seriously, maybe he's just bad at showing he cares or doesn't need as much social time as some people, but I don't think I could put up with that shit without throwing a serious paddy! :P  You probably didn't do anything wrong, OP. The unfortunate truth is I think we often read into these things a lot more than normal people - people with BPD are the epitome of 'has no chill' ;). But I don't think they're being very good friends to a) make plans with you and then ignore you/blow you off, and, b) not take into account how their actions might make you feel. I'd say the same of your boyfriend, too."
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah that whole having no chill thing is getting exhausting haha I've talked to them before about it and they've always said they're sorry and we'll hang out soon then disappear of the face of the earth. So it's probably a lost cause with them.   With my boyfriend, he'll actually talk things through with me when I'm not being hostile and he actually tries to work with me. It's better with him now that I'm not having an episode. It's just frustrating. And I'm rambling. But anyway thank you!"
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,3,Mon Jul 20 23:22:53 2015 UTC,Bleh :/ Sorry they're not being cool.   I'm glad stuff is working out ok with the BF though <3 I hope you manage to sort some stuff out! :D
BPD,3dwp0n,CuttlefishCuller69,3,Tue Jul 21 21:44:00 2015 UTC,Maybe you did nothing wrong it's just a coincidence they both had something to do. Either way its be embarrassing to bring it up so you should let it go and act like nothing happened next time you hang out with them.
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:09 2015 UTC,"That's assuming I'll hang out with them. I haven't seen the high school friends in months. And the whole ""just let it go and act like nothing happened"" bullshit is just continuing to add to the issues? Like? Okay. Cool."
BPD,3dwp0n,werewolf35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:09 2015 UTC,Well confront them angrily then for missing your date. I'm sure that will go over well.

BPD,3dx45z,NAWilliams92,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:47 2015 UTC,"I can't say I relate, but I am sorry. If it's any consolation, I felt that way at 23. I sat behind my computer playing games and it was great. I met alot of awesome fucking people, and had some great fuckin laughs. Good times, but I wish I had done more with my time then.  26 now and i'm just now starting to enjoy life. I've traveled a bit, seen some cool shit, met alot of awesome fucking people and worked jobs I despised with a passion. Unfortunately, that life has come to an end and i'm back to sitting here playing games, but i'm even more motivated to do that shit again. I've been working out and trying to change me. I've lost 75 pounds. I was 375 in january of 2014 and when I was weighed during partial hospitalization, I am 305. I ordered a weight bench so I can left weights at home,  Sorry, kind of doing a whole ""i'm doing great!"" thing. >_> Not so great, but things are okay. Anyways, I guess the whole point is is that I think it's never okay to give up unless you have no quality of life. I believe in assisted suicides, but I believe a decision that's not to be taken lightly. I wanted to give in so many times and there have been nights i've held a knife to my wrist and wanted to be over with so badly. I know things get better if I hold on. There are good times and there are bad times. Everything will pass."
BPD,3dx45z,Youknow_whatever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:02:09 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the weight loss! That's awesome and definitely something to be happy about. My weight is fine, but at the same time i am incredibly unfit, i can just never find the motivation to exercise, even after buying equipment for home (my treadmill is just a $2,000 clothes hanger).  I can definitely relate to the gaming, it's such a great way to just forget about the world and the problems we experience in it. I played WoW since it's original launch, but quit just after the MoP expansion as the game had just changed too much from it's original demographic and i wasn't enjoying it anymore, it also didn't help that everyone i used to play with IRL had moved on with their lives. I now only really play Hearthstone on the PC and have switched to PS4, which i've found has given me a little more freedom in my gaming, as WoW did basically consume my life, even if i have just switched it up by playing Elder Scrolls Online on the PS4 now.  Don't apologize for doing a 'i'm doing great' post. If anything it gives me hope that maybe i'll eventually catch a break, or at the very least it's nice to know that at least some of us are getting somewhere in life and enjoying it.  I've been through many of those nights and know the feels all too well, i'm actually considering getting a tattoo on my left wrist to remind me that i've survived those nights before and will survive them again, i've been designing it over the past few weeks.

Best thing you can do is just get up and start walking on it a bit. That's what I did. I just went outside and started lifting weights, fuck it. It actually helped control the crazy in my head.   I played WoW from vanilla up until the beginning of this year. I actually just stopped playing altogether. I unsubbed and resubbed to Everquest. I don't regret it. I'm playing it right now, lol.  Honestly, I can't say it's been great, but it's...tolerable. Bad things happen, I try to balance them out with somewhat decent things. I miss my psychotherapist. That was something I really looked forward to every week. Life is ups and downs, I just go with it 'cause i'm too stubborn to kill myself. I got through abuse, I can get through this.You have bad nights, you have good nights. If anything, I know I can control my urges. At least so far I can."

Out of curiosity, what server did you play on? I played on Khaz'Goroth.  I might have to give Everquest a look into, but i'm all over Elder Scrolls Online at the moment.  I used to read all the x-men comics as a kid, and am obsessed with most things Marvel, never been much of a DC fan.   To geek myself out even further i'm obsessed with manga and anime too, so i'm just your all-round geek, though you wouldn't be able to tell from my appearance.  I'm in the process of getting back in touch with a psychotherapist at the moment, i feel like i need the weekly support again, even if it's just to vent my bullshit to someone and let my emotions out to someone i know won't judge me.

His relationship with you likely is something he cherishes fondly.  Everyone has their struggles and he's just willing to help you with yours.

I know it's hard to live with all of this going on in your head and I know it's so damn hard to see situations like these from the outside, but he has his reasons for staying. Just the fact that he is willing to talk this through with you and doesn't just dismiss it as you ""being crazy"" or something is a sign that he really loves you."
