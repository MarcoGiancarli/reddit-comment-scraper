The Melvin A. Anderson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, acquired the rights to the tape in 1950. It was commonly used in construction to wrap air ducts.  Following this application, the name ""duct tape"" came into use in the 1950s, along with tape products that were colored silvery gray like tin ductwork. Specialized heat- and cold-resistant tapes were developed for heating and air-conditioning ducts. By 1960 a St. Louis, Missouri, HVAC company, Albert Arno, Inc., trademarked the name ""Ductape"" for their ""flame-resistant"" duct tape"

Mainly most of the vigil watchers were not around to press, but the biggest contributor seemed to be a technical failure of one of the remaining zombie button bots.  A bot was in use with many user accounts linked to it that allowed the button to be pressed when it reaches 1 second. This bot was able to recognize whether accounts it had been given had pressed the button already, but failed to recognize if an account ""couldn't"" press the button due to being created after April 1st, 2015. This led to an account popping up next in line that was tasked with pressing, but could not, while being in front of hundreds of other accounts, perfectly capable of pressing, just lower on the list. To my knowledge these accounts were donated to the bot by users, so at this time, the discussion is whether someone could have done this on purpose as a sort of ""ticking time bomb"" or not.  I've also heard the Admins just got tired of it and decided to nuke the place, leaving only the grays to bare silent witness to the destruction, eyes looking forwards with tears of joy.

It also borrows a lot from Old West Norse thanks to the Danelaw, but that's less noticeable due to the similarity of Old West Norse and Anglo-Saxon.

Doesn't negate the sound of the weapon cycling or the sound of the bullet going supersonic, but large enough suppressors can almost entirely muffle the noise of gas expansion.  Further enhancements can be made to muffle the action, and the user can load sub-sonic ammunition, resulting in guns that basically just make a CLICK noise when they fire."

Others believe that the disabled should not be excluded from the sacraments. Different Christian denominations have different philosophies and regulations in this regard.

It is the only United States Air Force production aircraft designed solely for close air support, including attacking tanks, armored vehicles, and other ground targets with limited air defenses.  The A-10 was designed around the 30Â mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon that is its primary armament. The A-10's airframe was designed for durability, with measures such as 1,200 pounds (540Â kg) of titanium aircraft armour to protect the cockpit and aircraft systems, enabling it to absorb a significant amount of damage and continue flying. The A-10A single-seat variant was the only version built, though one A-10A was converted to an A-10B twin-seat version. In 2005, a program was begun to upgrade remaining A-10A aircraft to the A-10C configuration.  The A-10's official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt of World War II, a fighter that was particularly effective at close air support. The A-10 is more commonly known by its nicknames ""Warthog"" or ""Hog"". Its secondary mission is to provide airborne forward air control, directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets. Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10. With a variety of upgrades and wing replacements, the A-10's service life may be extended to 2028, though there are proposals to retire it sooner.

CasualTodayILearned,2xuqgo,ZadocPaet,2,Wed Mar 4 03:31:23 2015 UTC,I wonder how many mods could be added before a sub implodes .
