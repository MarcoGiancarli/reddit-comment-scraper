I personally am not caught up with current music and my tastes seem to be stuck in the past from when I was a teenager and they're pretty embarrassing lol.

I am working weird hours in my summer job and just accepted a position through Americorps in the fall. I have tons of free time and a very sad bank account that does not allow me to do some things I wish I could: like a yoga membership, weekend trips up to Vancouver or down to Portland, or being able to add guacamole to my burritos without a second thought. I moved here to support my boyfriend in his music career, which is still in the writing and perfecting stage before he records his first EP.  A little more about me: I have been a vegetarian for almost a year, I majored in English during my undergrad and studied abroad in London for a semester, and I love cats. You sound like someone I would be friends with, or at least we would be able to share some common interests. I also quite enjoy baking, biking, and Netflixing. I'm working my way through the most recent seasons of House of Cards and OITNB right now!  I've tried to find a penal once before, but it didn't click for whatever reason, so I am very hopeful that we can get to know each other through the written word, which as you said, is very underrated.

Discussion around topics such as the ones you want is excellent, but very draining, like writing about controversial things take a whole lot out of you. Try to incorporate more daily topics, and most importantly talk to your penpal about the schedule at which you will respond, unfortunately most humans these days forget about someone they don't talk to for a day.

When it comes to Missy Higgins, Silverchair, and Bliss n Eso ... how famous are they in Australia?  I am from what I have discovered a huge fan of Australian culture.  I have from time to time watched Australian Football games on Youtube and your continent and country seems amazing to me.  I would just be curious to know.  Silverchair was my first favorite band that I was into when I was well, their age. I bought Frogstomp and loved it to death.  I learned about Missy Higgins from a Starbucks sampler CD and fell in love with ""The Special Two"" from her song catalog and sometimes I still listen to her on Spotify hoping I can listen to her songs enough that Spotify can sponsor her work some more in cheque.  I found Bliss n Eso when I looked into Hip Hop in Australia and was blown away with how old school and slick their flows are.   I just notice how much fun it seems Australia has in their performance arts and I just wouldn't mind knowing how famous the most famous Australian artists I know of are.

I think Daniel Johns has a solo thing going on at the moment which I've been seeing here and there.   I don't think Missy Higgins had been doing much, then again I don't actively seek out her stuff.  I know she did a few movies here and there.   I'm not the best person to ask sadly, I'm not into a lot of Australian music.  I prefer a lot of the older classics and I predominantly listen to metal these days.  Australia has a few decent metal bands though, which is good.   It does depend on where you live, I'm originally from South Australia and have found it very different to Sydney /New South Wales. A lot of stuff that is popular there isn't even on Sydney's radar, for example AFL is huge in SA, Vic and WA but not so much in the other states and territories as they prefer NRL."

Maybe we could give each other book suggestions. I also really enjoy your style of writing. Anyway, if you're at all interested feel free to contact me."

Have always thought of migrating but realise that I love this little dysfunctional island too much to want to uproot and go anywhere.  I used to play games on the PS3 but sold that off (desperate times) and have now gone back to PC gaming. Currently the sorta-constant game I play is DoTa 2. Other standalone stuff like This War is Mine, Watchdogs, Baldur's Gate, Monkey Island and Commander Keen.  The last 3 are really old games I know. But they were the miracles of my childhood gaming memories.  Which part of the US are you at? And send my regards to your lovely wife. Happy couples and happy families give me hope. The world's too saturated with negativity :/"

I hope they expand on that universe.   How are the people? Nice? You obviously like the food. Any links to some of the good stuff?  I guess that means you looked through my history?

penpals,3cp22a,IamAnoobcake,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"DoTA2 is the bomb. I played LoL and HotS and I find that I still prefer DoTA2. The way the game is structure, everything is balanced and it really depends on your abilities to micro-manage and strategise and also to work with the occasional idiots that might be thrown into your team.  Singaporeans are nice. We're generally nice. You could stop anyone of us on the road and ask for directions. Some of us, if we're not rushing, would even walk along with you to where you need to go. Our drivers though, might not be nice at times. So if you ever come here, please don't drive. Public transportation is safe and cheap. It kinda depends on what kinda good stuff you want? Like food? Or entertainment?   Occupational hazard. Or that I'm always curious to know a bit more about the person I'm talking to or engaging with coz it's only polite. And it helps ease the potential awkwardness. Unless that just counts as stalker creepy then sorry my bad. Not entirely sure what you mean by negative attention (unless I'm reading things wrong or... I just haven't been playing close attention). So don't worry."

What made things work so well for us is that we're both very inquisitive and ""philosophical,"" so I'll often ask an open ended question that will be discussed in lots of emails while on top of that we'll be talking about our lives and by the time we've reached the end of this subject, one of us will already have found something else equally as open ended to discuss. Once again, this is what worked for us and it comes down to our personalities matching in that respect."

penpals,3c7p8z,lannisterstark,2,Sun Jul 5 20:01:06 2015 UTC,"It's unrealistic to expect constant, consistent mail correspondence with someone. Not everyone has the time (or the composure) to sit down and write letters every week. Be patient. There are people I've been writing with for several years now and we sometimes go months without writing to each other. It just makes the notes all the more exciting and appreciated when they do trickle in. Send a card for every holiday. I may not always have something fantastic or terribly thoughtful to say, but I send out holiday cards for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Valentine's, birthdays, anniversaries, any holiday or special occasion. Sometimes they don't say anything more than, ""Happy [Holiday]!"", but at least they know I'm thinking about them. (I don't really celebrate most of those holidays, but I really love holiday cards and it's always fun to get them in the Post.) Letters don't always have to have words in them. Doodles, newspaper clippings, photographs, film/concert ticket stubs, and other small, postable items are always nice to find in your mail. Keep a journal. Let some of your letters reflect your journal entries. Maybe nothing too personal or private, but the random things you experience or think about. Personally, I try to avoid talking about myself too much. Focus on them. Ask questions. Keep up with news and events in their area. I subscribe to a number of subreddits for major cities or areas where my penpals live, and I keep an eye on news websites from those cities so there is always something to discuss. Extend your awareness to accommodate them, if only just a little. Read a book lately? Seen a film? Send them your analysis. Ask what they thought. Offer to share it with them.   This is my approach to having a penpal, at least with the ones that really grow on me."

penpals,3c7p8z,ToastToaster,2,Fri Jul 10 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"A couple of points, first of all the information in these comments is gold, seriously I can agree with almost everything that's been mentioned here. First, learn about what you want from the friendship, many of us, especially guys here are ""secretly"" thinking of pen pals as come kind of romantic relationship, if it might be, but seldom is. Romantic attraction has a kind drive that isn't usually seen in friendship, friendship is a kind of slow-burning incense, the longer you stay engaged the longer that sweet aroma permeates you! Now that you've decided what you're looking for, use conversation starters, and I know this is painfully difficult, especially when you've answered the same questions a hundred times before, but be steadfast, and hopeful that this one will last! Talk about the logistics, when you expect to receive an email, and when realistically you'll be able to reply, and then try your hardest to stay true to your word. Try to keep a small number of friends, preferably 1, this will ensure you ""spill your guts"" only once, and then get to real interesting topics. What's so difficult is that there is this crescendo, where personality, and interests meet, right before you start to share your deepest aspirations, you goals in life, and finally gain that support of another human being you came here looking for! When that happens you'll realize all of the above really was a small price to pay. What worked for me, and this has been already mentioned here, is analyze a book or movie you've currently finished, this will facilitate your pen pal to get to know you on a deeper level, without it being awkward. Finally, the most important point, something which I can't emphasize enough, actually part ways, this might sound harsh, but as will any relationship, forcing someone else to stay committed to something that will never be is very draining, and while you might think this is a bit harsh, trust me in this media its very much necessary! I hope you find someone interesting, but just don't get up hope, it is very difficult to find someone you ""click"" with, and all you can do is be patient."

I'll tell you a little about myself.  I am 19/female and go to college in the US, Texas to be specific. My ethnicity is Bangladeshi. It's a very small country in South Asia. My parents came to America about thirty years ago.  I absolutely love photography! I think my favorite to shoot is landscape just because of how beautiful mother nature can be if you have the ability to capture it right. I love working with film cameras. Digital cameras scare me because I think I'm going to screw them up. Haha. I also love the developing process of films. I find professional photography very cool. I think my favorite would have to be between wedding and music photography. Polar opposites, I know. I guess there's a lot behind why I go with those two.  I started Game of Thrones in May and am kind of into it. I'm not an avid fan or anything. It took me this long to get to season two, episode seven. I think my favorite shows would have to be The Office, The Mindy Project, Parks and Rec (I've only seen a couple episodes but love it!). How to Get Away With Murder, New Girl, and Empire. They are a mixture of comedy and drama shows.  I love sociology and medicine. I am actually a sociology major in college and pursuing a career in the medical field. Hopefully I will be able to become a plastic surgeon.  I love all sorts of music! Some of my favorite artists are The 1975, All Time Low, Blink 182, MGK, Yellow Claw, Oscar Wylde/Caked Up, Bastille, Two Door Cinema Club, Bring Me the Horizon, La Dispute, and A Day to Remember. There are a lot more but that's all I can think of for now.  Let me know if you'd like to write."

penpals,3b607n,thehat22,2,Sun Jun 28 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"For sure. I don't think it's something I so much have a choice about. I know that sounds silly. And I also, briefly, want to apologize for my abrupt answers. I was answering from my phone.    Yeah, I love writing. I know I sounded so glum about it. It is glum. It isn't the best hobby to have. And if you want to take it seriously it can't just be a hobby. And that's the problem. Until you hit it big you can either write and teach, which might alot enough free time and enough integration into your day to day for it to work. Or you can hit it big, or big enough to make some decent moeny and live off your writing. But then after you make a lil bit you better write somethign else if you want to keep getting paid. So it seems like a vicious cycle. And if something flops, you're fucked.    So I think it's best to make some decent money, real decent money, where life isn't so stressed because of money. And when you have enough to actually take off here and there and life isn't so  pressure cooker, you can actually use your weekends, and actually dedicate that time.     I guess? I'm not really sure but I'll write again when I have an idea strike me enough I suppose. I write short stories in the mean time. All the time. Well maybe not as much as I should, at least recently."

penpals,3b4khp,rrr_zzz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:23:36 2015 UTC,Anything in particular. I am from St. Louis but I have lived in Chicago and my sister lives in NY and compared to either of those our transits not very good. Probably because those cities built up rail lines early on but we just have a very small rail that largely just goes east and west. I loved being in Chicago never needed a car but here I wouldn't live without one. It also doesn't help we have a lot of sprawl so anything outside of the city itself quickly becomes pretty hard to get to by bus.

Hannah tends to get pushed over at times, Ray can be blunt and I certainly have that. But I have all the bad sides of Hannah.   I wish I was like Jessa minus the drug addiction.

penpals,3at5lo,Tjrainey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"Actually if memory serves me right the actor was Max Schreck who was rumoured to be quite reclusive during filming and was also believed to have gotten so into his character that it was rumoured he drank blood like a vampire.   This was not true. Much like the rumours surrounding Heath Ledger who played the Joker in the Dark Knight movie was believed to have gotten so into the character that he killed himself when in fact it was a simple misunderstanding which involved two doctors perscribing medicines to him, one to help him sleep and another to wake him up. Harmless on their own but once combined, caused a fatal heart attack which killed the actor.   Rumours turn into stories which become legends but Max Schreck (Who shares his name with Christopher Walken's character from the Batman Returns movie) was not a vampire but instead an incredibly versatile actor who was ahead of his time.  (Sorry for all the Batman references but I have a thing for bats... go figure.)"

Probably more skewed towards the late 70s-mid 80s, mostly bluesrock and classic metal, but quite a lot of poppy , or folky stuff as well as heavier stuff in there too (Sabbath, RATM, SOAD). Im currently spinning the soundtrack to the film The Guest (which is like 80s synth stuff), my weekend music is usually Judas Preist or Saxon, and I like to chill to some Robert Cray, or Steeley Dan or Santana or something- Cray probably gets the most plays. So soulful.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK65fS7Y4uc  My wife is very much more on the pop side of the spectrum. We have a lot of Fleetwood Mac etc.."

On one hand, Ive had so many failed starts that surely the best method is to send out lots of leads and hope one of them snags a good one.  On the other hand, perhaps Ive had so many failed starts that its indicating im searching too wide and finding people who just arnt right for me.  I do have a bunch of criteria that a person really must meet for me to get in touch though, but thats built on a lot of experience about people who clearly wernt going to work out.  My advice is to just go for it.  Youre not going to find ""just right"" because if you set your standards too high, there will be nobody left.  Imperfect people are interesting people, so dont be too afraid to get out the comfort zone.  The search continues!"

penpals,38wev3,humpbackturtle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:29:33 2015 UTC,Isn't it? I imagine things go much smoother on computer but my phone is too technologically advanced for its time not to use it.

penpals,38vdlk,cateatsglitter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:22:17 2015 UTC,I'm interested to know too. But also a little scared o.o

penpals,38vdlk,cateatsglitter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:50:38 2015 UTC,But that still begs the question. What exactly is the bible belt? If you don't mind me asking.
penpals,38vdlk,cateatsglitter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:21:02 2015 UTC,This godforsaken belt of states that are still more predominantly ruled by religion instead of logic and reason.

penpals,38s8hy,llamadicks,2,Sat Jun 6 10:44:45 2015 UTC,"22/M. What a coincidence! I'm also going insane, and for the opposite reason: I've failed to prepare a proper summer adventure, so I'm just marathoning neglected TV shows while waiting for excitement. (legit strat) Medicine is pretty great, I find biology in general is. One drop of basic ethology / comparative anatomy and you're hooked!"
penpals,38s8hy,Varaiya,2,Sat Jun 6 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, oh dear. Never too late to kick off a plan!  What shows are you watching? I just finished House MD for the second time- no regrets.  Right? Biology is fantastic. I've been obsessed since I was in high school."
penpals,38s8hy,Varaiya,2,Sun Jun 7 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"When I binge-watched House I probably overdid it, seeing as the basic episode formula is mostly unchanged it got really predictable. Had to give up mid-season 7, might have gone better with better pacing. Just did the 3rd season of House of Cards. Contemplating joining the Game of Thrones train, but I just can't push through the first episode. Probably the weight of my colossal expectations that just crushes the excitement a first episode usually has. I'm currently rewatching Sunny in Philadelphia, love that show!  My father's a doctor so I've pretty much grown up with medicine. He's got no filter at all so I've for better or worse been in that world since I can remember. I'm off to study it next year, can't wait! Are you studying anything related to this common enthusiasm?"
penpals,38s8hy,Varaiya,2,Sun Jun 7 06:25:24 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. It gets incredibly predictable but I adore it anyway, in all its mind numbing glory.  House of Cards was awesome! Kevin Spacey is a God. I've adored him since I saw American Beauty. He works a lot in theatre, too- so lovely.  Game of Thrones never did it for me. I feel kind of bad. Everyone loves it. I may read it.  That's awesome- none of my family have any medical training. :(  I'm not studying directly for it yet, but I'm in a bridging course to get into University. :)"
penpals,38s8hy,Imperator42,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:29:19 2015 UTC,"3rd HoC season wasn't my favorite, the whole Claire situation got really frustrating to me, my tendency to side with the villain I suppose. I still can't wait for the 4th season, I'm so excited that Doug is back on the team! I can relate to feeling bad for not instantly loving GoT, as I did when I just gave up on Breaking Bad after 2 seasons. I don't have time to love every show, but not watching phenomenons will cost social points. I wish my friends were bigger fans of movies, that's how my motion picture enthusiasm started. Takes so much less time and arguably more enjoyable. It's a different experience I guess. A lot of shit TV shows, my filter is set really crazy high so I don't waste time. Anyway, where are you on holiday?"
