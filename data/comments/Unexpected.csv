Unexpected,3dyc7x,evildead4075,-6,Tue Jul 21 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, let me explain this to you in a way you might understand. See, the video was taken with a device that is known as a ""smart phone"", ""iphone"", ""android"", or something along those lines. When they shot the video they were holding their device vertically (that means up and down, not side to side) and so the result is a tall, skinny video. (Bonus fact: if you hold the device sideways, it will take pictures and videos that actually look right on screens.) So when the video is shown on a short, wide screen, there's nothing for the sides, usually they're just left black. But rather than  showing black, some folks will extend (extend means stretch) the edges out, or show a blurry piece of the video so it's less distracting (distracting means it draws attention away from where you're supposed to be looking.)     Sorry about the big words."

Unexpected,3dvx39,Wolfey1618,138,Mon Jul 20 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a joke, but having worked with people who had severe dementia, it's a sad truth.  We had several people who were at a stage where they couldn't phrase a single comprehensible word. At the end of the day, we had to get them back home, where many of them lived alone.  These people would frequently just get out of their appartments in whatever they happened to wear at the time and just wander off sometimes. If they made it out of the building and the doors closed behind them, they could find themselves in freezing temperatures only wearing pants and a shirt with no way back in since obviously they wouldn't know of the existence of their key safe next to the door, nevermind the combination to open it.  It's really sad and very dangerous. I'm happy nothing like that happened during the time I was there (at least not at life-endangering temperatures), but it's bound to eventually."
Unexpected,3dvx39,scorpzrage,38,Mon Jul 20 05:43:23 2015 UTC,Yep. Both a joke and serious.   Thank you for your story. My pop is suffering from it and its getting weirder by the day. He's not talking very much anymore and its really hard to tell he's suffering because of that.
Unexpected,3dvx39,Wolfey1618,38,Mon Jul 20 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that.  If it's any consolation, people suffering from dementia don't seem to be generally unhappy and, from my experience, tend to enjoy the more simple joys like feeling sunrays on their skin on a somewhat chilly morning, taking a walk in the park, dancing, listening to music and the likes.  One of our customers was a man who went nowhere without his crutches despite not needing them at all. He always seemed lost and confused, usually preferred to just sit in a chair all day long and not say a single word. Twice a week, one of the creative staff would gather a group of people, play the guitar and sing old songs at around 10AM. The guy always participated and most of the time, he would happily sing other songs he knew for several hours, sometimes until we brought everybody back home at 4 or 5PM.  What's most important is that they're all still human beings and should be treated as such.  I probably can't imagine how difficult it is to see a close relative going through that, especially when it gets worse as quickly as it sometimes does, so if it gets too hard for whoever is taking care of your dad, they should definitely get help in some form."
Unexpected,3dvx39,scorpzrage,5,Mon Jul 20 06:08:05 2015 UTC,"I heard that it's more likely for smart people to get Alzheimer's, so I think I'm pretty safe. I'm glad, because it sounds really awful."

Unexpected,3dvx39,theunnoanprojec,4,Mon Jul 20 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"Sister-in-law is a nurse, and did a shortish stint at a nursing home. There are two things that she's told me about that have stuck with me for many years.  This place had a bus stop in the back yard. A few of the people there would sit out at the bus stop talking to each other for most of the day and when dinner or lunch time came a staff member would go out, ""welcome them back from the shops"", and invite them in for food.   It's a nice solution to a serious problem. There's an actual bus stop out the front and patients had managed to find there way there, and hop on a bus heading no-where in particular, and not knowing where they came from.   The second was the man with a padlock on his wardrobe. Because any time his wardrobe wasn't locked by the nursing staff, when the morning people checked on him, they'd probably find him wearing all of his clothes; at once; regardless of the temperature. He'd just start getting dressed, and then wouldn't stop until there was nothing else to stretch over the rest of his clothes. If he lived in an area that got cold, this might be helpful, but he did not. Not even sort of."

Two of her grandkids (so my second cousins) are around the same age as my brother and I, so whenever Wed visit her together shed think we were them. She was always even more confused if she'd see us with our cousins. If I visited her without my brother she thought I was my brother. When she got to the really late stage with it before she died, my brother was the only person she actually remembered. But only when he visited her without me."

Unexpected,3dvx39,ChoccyCupcake,15,Mon Jul 20 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"Well I'll give you a few reasons. A lot of us Reddit on mobile/our phones and it's generally much easier and more convenient to load and watch a small compressed part of a full video without having to open up the YouTube app or whatever. Plus, if you're out in public it's very rude to play sound from a video out loud if you lack headphones, which you don't have to deal with when it's a gif.   Then there's also people who Reddit at work/school and don't want to disturb the whole office with the sound of the video. Or maybe their work/school blocks YouTube and doesn't block gfycat/gify/imgur.   Yeah, when I'm at home on my home computer I prefer the video, but for the people who prefer it the video link is almost always one of the top comments anyways.   So yeah, OP's who post gifs are just trying to reach as many people as they possibly can, which IMO isn't reason to be called a ""git""."
Unexpected,3dvx39,StinginPlatypus,5,Mon Jul 20 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"Your reasons are OK, except on this case it is the whole video (except cutting the author off the front) and the file is bigger than the actual video (as gif is a terrible compression system)"
Unexpected,3dvx39,ChoccyCupcake,6,Mon Jul 20 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you got me there. I was talking more in general and not just about this post because yeah, you're absolutely right about this one haha. And I agree that it would be nice if the OP could at least link the video as the first comment as soon as they make the post so the author can still get their proper views.  I guess it's all kind of situational, really."
Unexpected,3dvx39,StinginPlatypus,5,Mon Jul 20 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"While what you say is correct, many people (myself included) would simply skip over the video immediately upon seeing that it is in fact a video. Just by being a video, the submission carries the implication of needing sound, and sound is often not an option (as /u/StinginPlatypus mentioned). I know that sound often isn't required, as is the case in this particular submission, but the implication of it is enough to make us skip over the link, just because there's no quick way to determine if we can fully enjoy the submission without sound or not. The fact that this submission is a gif means people like me are still able to enjoy it."
Unexpected,3dvx39,schwagle,8,Mon Jul 20 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"Generally gifs get more people watching them as they're easier to open + watch than a video. Happens all over reddit, which is odd because I personally prefer videos =/"

Unexpected,3dm9j6,auto180sx,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:13 2015 UTC,"That's hard on your throw out bearing, keep your foot off the clutch as much as possible."
Unexpected,3dm9j6,everythings_alright,9,Fri Jul 17 15:30:48 2015 UTC,I heard that you shouldn't be doing that. Having the feet on the clutch for a long time is apparently not good for the transmission or whatever. It's probably not a big deal at all and maybe even false.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,Untitledone,7,Fri Jul 17 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"It will wear out the clutch release bearing. When your foot is off the clutch, it is engaged and will not wear out. When your foot is pressing the clutch pedal down it is pressing on the pressure plate with the release bearing. That means there is a large force being applied to the release bearing and it is also spinning at a few hundred RPM. This will lead to a lot of wear over time.  Replacing a release bearing takes as much time and almost as much money as replacing an entire clutch."
Unexpected,3dm9j6,LiquidEnvy,2,Fri Jul 17 15:17:47 2015 UTC,Depending on the length of the light I'll stick the car in neutral. In my brain I'm saving some gear on the breaks.  Obviously only applies the road is relatively level.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,xb4r7x,2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Idk about wherever you are, but around here the lights can last minutes. It's tiring to keep your foot firmly on the clutch and brake for that long. I usually shift into neutral and just use the brake unless I think the light is going to change soon.  It's just easier on the feet."
Unexpected,3dm9j6,Drak3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:15:55 2015 UTC,I think my clutch must be light.  its a bit lighter than my brake pedal.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,xb4r7x,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you have to push it all the way to the floor...  With your brakes you just have to put enough pressure on the pedal to keep the car from rolling away. Even with a light clutch you have to extend your leg to the floor - I've got short legs, so that means fully extending, which is an annoying position to hold for more than 20 seconds or so."
Unexpected,3dm9j6,Drak3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"I can see why that might not work for everyone.  I'm not terribly short, and have my seat adjusted so its not uncomfortable."
Unexpected,3dm9j6,xb4r7x,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for me, if I were to adjust the seat to make it uncomfortable, the airbag would kill me in a crash!"
Unexpected,3dm9j6,theeyeeats,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:12 2015 UTC,I always switch to neutral to rest my foot. I'm driving a lot and it's better than to constantly put pressure on the clutch.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,Gabe_20,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"This may be a dumb question, but why can't you just shift into 1st instead of neutral and keep your foot on the brake until the light changes?"
Unexpected,3dm9j6,theeyeeats,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:52 2015 UTC,Then you have to keep your left foot on the clutch the whole time or else the motor turns off (quite harshly). It's not like in an automatic transmission where when you're in drive the car automatically accelerates. You have to press the gas pedal for that. So to rest your foot you go into neutral when standing. I hope that helps.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,goocy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:44 2015 UTC,That stalls your engine.
Unexpected,3dm9j6,G19Gen3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:56 2015 UTC,Better for the car to shift in to neutral unless it's a really short light.

Sure cars will have the option to manually shift gears but most people just drive auto.

Unexpected,3dm9j6,WordUP60,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:45 2015 UTC,This isn't about putting the car in gear. Back in the 1980s there were campaigns all over Europe to turn off your car at red lights to conserve fuel and harm the environment less. The red-yellow was to give you time to restart your engine.  I believe people stopped turning off their engines sometime in the 1990s. Some modern cars (both automatic and manual) will turn the engine off automatically when stopped and restart when you're taking off again.

Unexpected,3di0rq,Harry_Flugelman,25,Thu Jul 16 18:09:36 2015 UTC,It's pretty hard to break your neck on a trampoline.  Even if you land directly on your head you'll just slide out of it and the cushion from the springs doesn't really have enough force to snap bone.  When people break their neck it's usually because they fell off the trampoline or went in to the supports.
Unexpected,3di0rq,onetrickwolf,42,Thu Jul 16 19:15:15 2015 UTC,"When you add other people jumping, it becomes far more likely. If the trampoline is already springing back up from another person's jump, it adds more kinetic energy to the impact, rather than absorbing it."
Unexpected,3di0rq,SanctusLetum,25,Thu Jul 16 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"That's why most trampolines say ""1 person at a time."" But no one pays attention to that rule."

Unexpected,3di0rq,JagerBaBomb,12,Thu Jul 16 19:12:58 2015 UTC,"I was shoved off of one when I was younger. There we're ~8 people on the trampoline (I was 7, too young to have very good judgement) with one 70-year-old watching over us (Who was asleep the whole time.) Anyways, as we jumped, some asshole shoved me and sent me flying backwards a good eight feet onto my shoulder, breaking the epiphyseal plate. I looked up to see every other kid gone; little shits ran away to avoid getting in trouble before seeing if I was even okay.   My cousin's family then refused to take me to an actual doctor; they thought it was only dislocated and that I was exaggerating. 1 1/2 hours of waiting in the clinics' office later only for him to tell us that I had to see my doctor. Reluctantly, they drove me to the hospital, dropped me off, and left. (My immediate family was already there, but they still just let me out and drove off.) I required two pins to be inserted into my arm as a result. Haven't spoken to anyone on my dad's side of the family since, and I'm better off for it.   Although, ironically, (is it ironic? I think it actually is in this case) my immediate family owned a trampoline for several years after that event, and the worst anyone ever got on our trampoline was a rolled ankle and motion sickness. Just goes to show you that anything can be dangerous in the hands of your white trash extended family.  TL;DR: Broke my shoulder on a trampoline. It sucked."
Unexpected,3di0rq,IBeAPotato,9,Thu Jul 16 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"What I got out of this is that your family thinks that a dislocated shoulder does not warrant a hospital visit. I bet they're all doctors, huh?"
