TopGear,3dye0y,FloppY_,43,Mon Jul 20 21:10:22 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt you will have any problems with that at all. Half of the license plate is over the grill on the ones driving around here in europe. Here is a picture of how a Mini usually has its front plate mounted here.  As long as you are topped up on fluids and not red-lining the engine constantly it's almost impossible to overheat a modern car.

TopGear,3dye0y,niliti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:45 2015 UTC,Yeah minis don't really have any cooling problems in especially the r53. I really miss my mini.

To fix that you get so arogel to put under the cooler and a bigger hood scoop.
TopGear,3dye0y,blueshiftlabs,5,Tue Jul 21 10:10:00 2015 UTC,Be thankful you don't live in a US state that requires a front license plate.  Some cars it damn near covers the entire grill.  http://i.imgur.com/zw37qJ6.jpg

TopGear,3dzets,matthewpl,56,Mon Jul 20 20:11:05 2015 UTC,Structurally reinforced with steel beams all over underneath the wood.
TopGear,3dzets,Dan_Of_Time,55,Mon Jul 20 20:13:22 2015 UTC,I always figured they would do something like that just to ensure their safety and the local people's safety. Where was this revealed? I love learning TG secrets.

TopGear,3dzets,hidden_cat,7,Tue Jul 21 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"That would be a joist girder, not a beam."
TopGear,3dzets,vyruz32,3,Tue Jul 21 09:33:00 2015 UTC,Near the bottom right where some wood is sticking out you can see some of the steel frame
TopGear,3dzets,despairepair,5,Tue Jul 21 06:36:48 2015 UTC,"You can actually see a steel beam at the middle of the bridge during Jeremy's run as the camera pans out when Clarkson says ""I'm weakening it for Hammond""."
TopGear,3dzets,MistaJinx,0,Tue Jul 21 02:43:48 2015 UTC,Something about a slope on the bridge....no wait

TopGear,3dzets,CanadianBreakin,7,Tue Jul 21 04:53:17 2015 UTC,"If they didn't cheat, how knows if it would have even stood up. Part of it did flow down the river when they were building it."
TopGear,3dzets,Gregger90,29,Mon Jul 20 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"TIL you can cheat while building a bridge, using only structural reinforcement!"
TopGear,3dzets,Snagprophet,21,Mon Jul 20 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"They used materials not allowed or available and surely must have used some engineers, machinery, power tools and ""over budget "" for the historical reenactment of building the bridge over river kwai/kok"
TopGear,3dzets,Darkar_95,5,Mon Jul 20 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"I mean you really didn't think it was legit? Did you think they built it themselves just off the top of their head? That they built a shady, dangerous bridge and then just left it to the locals to get hurt on?"
TopGear,3dzets,InsertEvilLaugh,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:10:15 2015 UTC,It's a bit sad because even with all that work there was still a slope on it.
TopGear,3dzets,GoldAuFTW,3,Tue Jul 21 11:36:23 2015 UTC,I didn't know that new game poly bridge had good graphics
TopGear,3dzets,egtownsend,2,Tue Jul 21 05:54:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't mind they cheated. For one, they lived, and for another, they are three old men who had to build it in a very short period of time. A little cheating is expected, but oh well, still fun as hell to watch."
TopGear,3dzets,cikamatko,2,Tue Jul 21 11:00:49 2015 UTC,Do people really believe 3 baffoons and a production team made a rickety bridge capable of getting those incredibly heavy trucks across? It's television for God's sake
TopGear,3dzets,The_Bilbo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:38:46 2015 UTC,Even when professionals don't cheat they don't always succeed. Building a bridge is a sort of achievement even if it did have steel beams.
TopGear,3dzets,cikamatko,-8,Tue Jul 21 07:09:34 2015 UTC,But what about the jet fuel?

I'm pretty sure none of us are even slightly offended at all by this, because if you had even the smallest crumb of conscience, you'd see that this is nothing but an off-hand joke. Clarkson is not going out of his way to purposefully upset, insult or offend gay people.  Just the media looking for another reason."

TopGear,3dxa0w,leonryan,27,Mon Jul 20 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"Hammond did the same thing, why is he free from criticism in the daily mirrors eyes? Just an opportunity to call Clarkson a shit head isn't it"
TopGear,3dxa0w,DaLateDentArthurDent,7,Mon Jul 20 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"I've always had this theory that Hammond is actually the most offensive of the three, but he's quieter about it (Mexican stand-off excluded) and therefore the louder Clarkson takes the brunt of the blame. Still love them both, but it's my theory."

TopGear,3dxa0w,ShowBaggs,6,Mon Jul 20 09:36:21 2015 UTC,"It does make me wonder how people would react to actual hatred of gay people.   No doubt they'd ignore it unless a white person says it. They make it seem like uttering 'fudge packer' is like uttering nigger. Not that Clarkson's uttered nigger but I can't help but think disproportionate.  It seems more like one of those ""you came to that conclusion, you were thinking it so you're the homophobe"" sort of joke. It's double entendre."
