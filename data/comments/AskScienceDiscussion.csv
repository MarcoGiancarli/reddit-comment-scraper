AskScienceDiscussion,3e4ti0,d1rron,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"My naive answer is not really. The Schwarzschild radius of a 1 solar mass object is R=2.95 km. The most massive neutron star is around 2 solar masses. Theoretical estimates of the radius of such a neutron star is 10+ km in radius (the blue curves are the ones allowed by the observation). So even if G doubles, it's not enough to cause neutron stars to collapse. I think this is true but haven't thought about the more general Kerr metric, which describes a rotating system... often the case for neutron stars. However, the top left of the graph shows the limit set by GR, which I think would come down by a factor of ~2. So, if you draw a diagonal line starting at M~1.2 at the left instead of M~2.4, you might hit some neutron stars, depending on the equation-of-state, but not all, and probably not most, since we don't have observational evidence of those really massive neutron stars above M~2 solar masses."

The bacteria in your gut, for instance, have been shown in studies to have direct effects on your central nervous system including the production of neurotransmitters and their precursors (like serotonin and tryptophan).   Clarke et al. did a study (""The microbiome-gut-brain axis during early life regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner"") about the interaction between the gut bacteria and neurotransmitters. I have this doi listed in my reference: (doi:10.1038/mp.2012.77) and it seems to point in the right direction but I may have picked it up from an educational database that is restricted to outside users.

Addiction is more than a physiological reaction, however.

AskScienceDiscussion,3e5adz,clessa,2,Wed Jul 22 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert on this, but I'll give fixing a few of your statements a try, and it might give you something to google for more accurate/detailed information than I can provide.      Firstly, a black hole in isolation (i.e. with no matter falling in, and nothing affecting it) does not get denser and denser. In fact, general relativity predicts matter inside a black hole of any size will form a singularity at the center - a 'place' in space-time with finite mass, but infinite density. This is by no means physical, and string theory has something very different to say about black holes, but to really know what happens, we would need a working theory of quantum gravity.      So you now might ask, would a black hole (like the one in your question, which has swallowed up all the matter in the universe) just remain the same size and mass forever? The answer to this is no. Hawking radiation is a quantum effect that allows black holes to radiate electromagnetic radiation (light), thus decreasing the size and mass of the black hole - so they aren't as black as the name suggests. Eventually, the black hole would evaporate due to Hawking radiation, but this would take an unimaginable amount of time for a black hole of the size you are talking about."
AskScienceDiscussion,3e5pki,tyrannosauru,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"Eventually, yes. Probably in your lifetime, if you're less than 50 years old.   The thing you have to understand about the ""always 20 years away"" thing is that there's a certain amount of uncertainty inherent in any such prediction. When folks in the 1950s said ""Fusion power is likely 30 years away"", they really had no idea what a fusion reactor would look like, so the level of uncertainty was probably larger than the actual 30-year timeframe. So call it 20-90 years at that point.  In the intervening decades, we've learned a lot more about plasma physics than we knew back then. A lot of practical experimentation has gone on, and various possible designs for fusion reactors have been proposed, experimented with, and abandoned.  At this point, absent some out-of-nowhere breakthrough, the first practical fusion reactor will be based on the Tokamak design, which has been studied and tweaked over the last few decades. One big question that the ITER project hopes to answer is how scaling up the size of the tokamak affects power production and energy losses. Ideally, once that project comes online, we'll know exactly how large a practical reactor needs to be.  Current indications are that the larger the power plant is, the better the efficiency will be. So, it's likely that the first practical fusion power plant will generate an enormous amount of power. From that standpoint, they'll never be the ""most common"" power source, because there won't be a large number of plants, and they're going to be very very expensive. Likely fusion power plants will be the largest part of worldwide electric generating capacity quite soon after they're proven practical, though."

We don't actually know how long embryos can be stored and still be viable, but it's at least several decades (the oldest embryo that's been defrosted and used so far was about 20 years old). It's likely that the upper limit is many many decades, maybe even centuries.  However, it's going to take a very long time to reach any other star with the rocket technology we have today. Centuries, or more likely millennia.  Assume that the embryos can stay frozen essentially indefinitely. You'll still need to power some systems on the spacecraft for the duration of the flight, which means a power source that lasts for hundreds of years. You could design a nuclear reactor that periodically refuels itself, that probably wouldn't be too hard. But that's still a really long time. I don't know of any mechanical systems that are designed to run for centuries with no maintenance.  But hey - robots! That'll solve the maintenance and fueling problem. Except we don't actually know how to make a computer think creatively like a human can, and that's kind of critical if you want the robots to be able to react to unexpected problems. And after a century or two, they'll all be unexpected problems.  The final problem is actually birthing the embryos.

AskScienceDiscussion,3e3v1u,n0ttsweet,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think you made word salad...  The pressure with wich you ""push"" a material into a container has no real bearing on the pressure of the material in the container.  So start with ""What is the initial pressure of the container and what does it contain"".  Add ""what if anything is moderating flow?"" For instance, with no moderator the CO2 gas is going to fill the container to 14psi almost instantly and you'll get no water at all.  The ""7psi water"" is going to reach 14psi as soon as the CO2 get's there.  Pressure isn't about the material, it's about the container and external forces.  You can not, for instance, ""blow up half a balloon"", you can only ""inflate a balloon halfway"".  So be prepared to have the 14psi pressurize (or stop the flow of) the water source.  Canonically you would measure the amount of water (low pressure material) you need into the container by supplying it first. Then add the CO2 (higher pressure) material second.  But in terms of ""a solution"", you won't have one of those. There is no ""dissolving into solution"" likely to take place at theses pressures, as you have already mentioned. You will end up with some CO2 and some water in a can.  So what are you actually trying to do?  For instance, if you are trying to make a mist of water droplets you would use a venturi tube arrangement. Blow the CO2 through the mixing chamber (Where it's effective pressure is very low because it's speed is very high) and then feed the water into the low-pressure zone where 7psi is a lot.  Still not a ""solution"" but as close as you are going to get.  Carbonated water is the ""infusion"" of CO2 into water so if you already know you are not going to meaningfully infuse the water at these pressures you already know the answer is ""nothing happens"" at these pressures unless you wait forever.  Now if you are trying to, say, Macgiver Bong something, just bubble the gas through the liquid for a long time. Or take the source material, don't make a gas of it at all, and make tea instead. This tea methodology is how various infused oils are made. They take the donor material (say peppers or garlic) and throw it into the oil and maybe heat it a little bit but not much at all, and let osmotic pressures move the volatile components. For ""extracts"" instead of ""infusions"" a pure alcohol is more common. In both processes it's useful to grind or muddle the donor.  P.S. the water in my cup sitting just right of my keyboard as I type is at 14psi because of air pressure, so you need to get a better grip on pressures -- and temperatures, they are strongly linked -- before you try anything with anything volatile."
AskScienceDiscussion,3e3v1u,BitOBear,2,Tue Jul 21 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"I realize that 7psi and 14psi aren't practical. Mostly the 1bar difference was what I was addressing.  The pressure of the container would be 1 atm. or 1 bar. Or whatever the environment of the atmosphere the device is at. So in the mountains, a bit less... you get the idea.  The sealed container would have an outlet attached to a faucet to dispense the finished product.  I could implement some ""flow moderation"", but ultimately, I need a consistent mix of N2 (the actual gas I'll likely be using, CO2 was the example b/c its more common with water) and H2O.  I can use higher pressures if need be also. I do need the N2 to DISSOLVE into the water.  ***Essentially, what I need is water and N2 to form a solution so that it will bubble out of the water when it hits the atmosphere.

AskScienceDiscussion,3e3v1u,svipdag_DM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:53:26 2015 UTC,"You don't need 1 bar of difference in pressure. You need an absolute pressure of N2 in the headspace. There is a principle called ""Henry's Law"" that tells you what concentration of gas you can sustain with a certain head pressure of that gas.   However note that, when you mix gases, Henry's law only cares about the gas you're looking at. So for example, dry air is around 70% nitrogen. That means a cup of water on a table will be in contact with about 0.7 atm of N2 gas. The real ""pressure"" of nitrogen is slightly different than this for a couple of reasons (look up fugacity if you want your head to explode) but this is approximately right.  What this means is that you can't keep 40 mg/L (~guinness concentration) of N2 in a vessel at 1 atm. That ""waterfall"" effect you have a video of occurs because the high pressure water, with a corresponding high Henry's concentration of N2, is now in contact with normal air.

There are dozens of fairly-mainstream computer languages, and thousands (no joke) of more-obscure ones.  Here's one way to look at it - a computer is a universal computing tool. Anything that's computable, is computable on any computer (subject to time and memory constraints).  If you use the computer's native language (machine language), you can obviously program the machine to do anything, with the highest-possible efficiency. But that's terribly, terribly tedious and error prone, so we invented higher-level languages in order to translate a more human-readable representation into something the computer can execute.  Obviously you're giving something up in the transition from lower-level to higher-level language. Normally this amounts to expressiveness (some programs are easier to express in language X, and some are harder) and efficiency (language X produces nearly-optimal code for task A, but not for task B).  Every computer language is designed (explicitly or implicitly) with different tradeoffs in these areas. So depending n what problem you want to solve, and whether it's more important to write the program quickly, or for it to run faster, you'd naturally choose a different language.

Top speed is almost completely controlled (math here) by the speed of exhaust moving away from your rocket. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and rockets are like throwing stuff away from you and having the recoil move you forward. The figure of merit is specific impulse. Ion engines have very high specific impulse and a max exhaust velocity of ~50 km/s while using a few kilograms of xenon and electricity from solar panels or a RTG over months to reach top speed.  Thrust is almost controlled by how much mass you can throw per second. The figure of merit is thrust to weight ratio; you want this ratio to be >1 to overcome Earth's gravity. The Space Shuttle's main engines only have an exhaust velocity of ~4 km/s but a thrust to weight ratio of about 3 and use hundreds of pounds of propellant per second.  For most science fiction purposes we want an engine that expels hundreds of pounds of propellant per second at hundreds of kilometers per second.

If you accelerate a spacecraft at the surface of the earth then it has to push through the thickest part of Earth's atmosphere at very high speeds, which is incredibly inefficient. To send an object into space without rocket boosters would require a launch speed of over 11km/s, and pretty much any man-made object traveling through Earth's atmosphere at 1km/s will disintegrate due to air drag.   Theoretically you could launch a spacecraft at 0.5km/s to save on fuel costs, but you would have to spend a ton of money to make the ship strong and aerodynamic. It's not economical with current technology."

AskScienceDiscussion,3e1lhv,brtt3000,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"I actually considered the same concept. The problem is that the peak of mount Everest still has an air pressure that's roughly 30% at thick as the surface and that's still enough to dramatically hinder high speed aircraft. A 70% difference in air pressure seems really big but it's not a big issue for modern spacecraft because they travel through the lower atmosphere at relatively slow speeds. I'm not really sure at how dramatically air drag differs at different altitudes, but you might get an idea if you compare the flight parameters of the SR-71 Blackbird to the X-15 Rocket Plane.   The rocket plane has a speed record of Mach 6.72, and can fly at an altitude of 250,000 ft. The Blackbird has a speed record of  Mach 3.3 and can fly at an altitude of 85,000 ft.  Basically you would have to extend the tube for a long distance above the mountain as well to get serious benefits.

If you broadcast the power uniformally in all directions (btw its impossible to build an antennae that does this) the power would drop off with the square of the distance. So of course we don't do this. They make the antennae send in one direction. Ideally it would be as focused as a laser beam however again we can't reach that ideal.  I'm not sure how much the signal spreads but this is a major factor.  The disadvange of a directional antenna is that if its not pointed precisely at earth they don't work. We lose more satellites this way when they have an issue don't point at earth and we cant send any commands to fix the problem.

I assume you came across Legendre polynomials in your electromagnetism course in the context of the multipole expansion. Generally speaking, Legendre polynomials tend to make their appearance in problems with spherical symmetry. Consequently, the also appear in the context of the hydrogen atom, i.e. the two-body problem, in quantum mechanics. Any introductory QM text ought to discuss this --- I can recommend D. J. Griffiths' ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" as a very enjoyable read on the subject. The idea is that you write the Schroedinger equation in spherical coordinates and solve the partial differential equation using separation of variables, and the polar component is written in terms of the Legendre basis.

I like to dream that 20 or 50 years from now we'll have all sorts of nanomachines doing jobs that we couldn't do otherwise but first we need the building blocks and we need ways to piece the building blocks together.

The better the sequencing gets, the more precisely we can assign the reads (e.g. to a species instead of a phylum) and the more rare microbial taxa we can detect.  It's not perfect (for example, we need to be cautious about using read number as a proxy for microbial taxa abundance), but I am excited for the day that powerful sequencing coupled with powerful data analysis applications will allow us to characterize a microbial community to the strain level for every single microbe present in the sample.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dzd3e,matts2,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"May I comment on your initial discussion? I don't think your proposed counter answers to the statement ""most of psychology is made up"", and I don't thing ""how much we know"" in a specific field has anything to do with it being real science.  If you know very little about something, but all your knowledge about it was derived from sound experiments, then it's real science. It doesn't matter that planetary geologists says they know about 10% of their field, and astrologists (attention, not astronomers!) claim they know 100% of theirs. The former is practicing real science, the latter is not.  Specifically about psychology, there's plenty of science being conducted, and there's still plenty of non-supported claims. For example, cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended for OCD, but you'll find it's next to impossible to cite any evidence in favor psychoanalysis, even more so anything Freudian in nature.      As for my field, it's Medicine. So we definitely know a lot in some areas, but very little in others, and we are always learning something new in all of them.     EDIT: as an analogy: perhaps your friend is confusing people who sell quantum mattresses with people who study quantum physics. It doesn't help that, in psychology, both of those will have degrees."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dzi8u,siggystabs,7,Mon Jul 20 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"It's not that gravity itself doesn't ""mesh well"" with the standard model (though many people repeat phrases that make this sound like this is the case). It's perfectly possible (though not typically easy in practice...) to do field-theoretical particle physics calculations in a curved spacetime. The difficulty arises when trying to quantize gravity itself - it's not a renormalizable theory, which means that when you try to cancel infinities in the usual way, you require an infinite number of free parameters in your theory. Of course such a theory isn't very predictive.  This isn't as disastrous as was once thought. Now we understand this as a clue that there is higher-energy physics that we haven't discovered yet. String theory provides one example of a UV (higher-energy) completion of gravity, which would solve the aforementioned issue."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dzi8u,venustrapsflies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:50 2015 UTC,Can you explain why gravity not being a renormalizable theory implies that there are higher energy physics that we have not discovered yet?
AskScienceDiscussion,3dzi8u,venustrapsflies,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:06 2015 UTC,"well, renormalization is like introducing a large energy-scale parameter to cut off divergent integrals, and having it cancel out of actual physical observable calculations as you take the limit of that parameter to infinity. so when you can't renormalize the theory this is telling you that you can't let that cutoff be arbitrarily high - there must be some other physics at work somewhere in those higher energy scales."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dzi8u,venustrapsflies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"So you try and fix a divergent integral by introducing another term that should cancel out neatly but ends up not matching observations, meaning that the integral does not accurately model higher energy physics.

One is we somehow continue with the idea of a published magazine. I would need immense help from 1-3 co-showrunners to make this happen.  Second, we could convert ASQ into an online ""blog""-ish publication on an external AskScience website. This would allow articles to be submitted intermittently on a live website. This would spread out the word a bit more nicely instead of grouping all the effort of 4-5 articles every 3 months.

It makes minor course corrections with its hydrazine powered engines. It also uses these to rotate and orient the craft to use it's various sensors.   In the vacuum of space there's nothing to slow it down so once it got up to speed through gravitational slingshotting it maintains speed.  It powers it's sensors and other electronics with a nuclear battery. A hunk of radioactive metal decays releasing energy and heat which is turned into electricity.

This might influence both the surface area and the morphology of fibers."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dwm4k,danskal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"First, this experiment is useless unless you control the water content. You must place the sample in a room with machine-controlled humidity, and measure the actual water content with Karl Fischer titration. That way, the most obvious source of variation, humidity, is controlled for.  The electrode plates should also be always acetone-washed and oven-dried, to remove spurious effects from contamination. Also, the gap between the plates should be kept constant; since the paper shrinks and warps, this might be not obviously constant.  That being said, the effect on paper by drying after wetting is called hornification. The fibers are mobile in water and when drying, their surfaces stick to each other and remain stuck when dry. The bulk of the hydrogen bonds, inside the fibers, are not affected, only the surfaces.  You might want to read what prof. Tapani Vuorinen's group has written on this, since they have done deuterium-labeling experiments to elucidate what is going on. Particularly, the question to answer is: are there enough bonds modified by surface bonding to other fibers to account for a large change in dielectric constant? I am completely speculating here but I would say no. The pure number of surface atoms vs. atoms in the interior of the fiber is very small, and would require unrealistically high changes in dielectric constant to account for a large change in the bulk constant.  tl;dr: I can believe that the measurement value does change substantially due to uncontrolled variables, but if these variables are controlled, I can't see any reasonable chemical mechanism and would apply the ""extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence"" rule (e.g. some sort of a specially tipped AFM or similar)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3duafq,Lord_Pickel,16,Sun Jul 19 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"Probably more than a gigaton. The trick to bombs like that is that you simply add more fusion stages to increase the yield. We could make an absolutely enormous bomb, at the expense of portability. The bomb would be roughly house size, and it would require quite a bit of equipment to keep it cool, since it would be cryogenically cooled. It just becomes incredibly impractical the bigger it gets. It would weigh hundreds of tons and wouldn't be portable at all, unless you stick it on a cargo ship.   Edit: /u/i_invented_the_ipod points out that it wouldn't need to be cryogenically cooled. If it uses deuteride it would not, but if it used deuterium it would need to be cooled. I don't know which is more easily produced, but I would guess that the fusion fuel used would be deuteride because it can be scaled infinitely. They would go with the fuel that can be scaled infinitely and easily produced. An alternative to this, of course, would be to strap a bunch of smaller bombs together. The reason why larger bombs aren't used to destroy cities is because they were developed for relatively inaccurate bombers and early missiles. They were big to guaruntee a hit on their target. Now, with advanced missiles, what we can do is pop off several MIRVs (Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicle), each containing a warhead. These can be spread out over a city, and this destroys much more on the ground than a big bomb, for the same weight. This is one of the main reasons they aren't used as much anymore. They are useful for hitting hardened targets such as silos, but again, a smaller, more accurate bomb can do the same job to the same standards."

AskScienceDiscussion,3du5d5,KenziePlayz,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"Psychology is still a new field of science, and there have been issues historically with treating it as a true science because it is all based in theory and much more difficult to prove than other sciences. You can't prove why person A with abusive parents became an abusive parent versus why person B with loving parents also became an abusive parent. Certain facets of psychology dealing more directly with brain science can be more easily proven."
AskScienceDiscussion,3du5d5,respeckKnuckles,3,Mon Jul 20 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"In a sense you can't ""prove"" things in more established fields of science either.

AskScienceDiscussion,3du5d5,KenziePlayz,0,Mon Jul 20 05:58:40 2015 UTC,This is true. Correlation can't be proven as causation. However creating fair experiments and interpreting those results can be much easier in other fields of science.
AskScienceDiscussion,3du5d5,SweaterFish,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"The problem with the passage you quoted is that that's not even an evolutionary explanation. In fact, in so far as social behavior and evolution can be separated, that's as purely sociological an explanation as I can imagine. Maybe psychologists/sociologists mean something different by ""evolutionary"" than biologists do, though, I don't know."
AskScienceDiscussion,3du5d5,KenziePlayz,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"There are definitely evolutionary behavior traits addressed in psychology and sociology. An example would be infants' reflexes; an example is the rooting reflex. Brush a baby's cheek or mouth with a nipple or finger and he/she will instinctively turn his/her mouth towards it and open up to suck. That reflex is ingrained in babies from birth for obvious reasons; they would starve otherwise. Now, not all evolutionary behavior traits are physical reflexes; displays of aggressive versus passive personalities have been found to correlate more similarly between animals that are closely related, like parents and their offspring. Evolution in psychology and sociology is based on genetics. Notably psychology and sociology deal with learned behavior and characteristics much more than biology and other sciences; the bacterium doesn't learn to have a flagellum, it just gets it. It's in its genetic code. Psychology and sociology are much more impressionable than that."

After all a lot of the radium is inside the bones, so if you remove/replace some of the bigger ones(in legs/arms/jaw), you'd clean some of the radium/remove some of the cancers, maybe? I guess bone marrow transplants could help too (at least for their leukemia cases)"

I do not know how radium is distributed in the body. If a large amount of radium is distributed in the bones, then yes it would help to remove the bones.

I think the best they could do is get a vague notion of what circuitry is in a general sense, and point them in the right direction about what materials to research, etc.   This is interesting stuff to think about.

An ""excited"" state can be initiated fairly easily with basic usage of proper and directed visualization. However, it is more common for people to try and use their breathing, thus producing hyperoxia.   Hyperoxia occurs when tissues and organs are exposed to an excess supply of oxygen (O2) or higher than normal partial pressure of oxygen and usually is a result of breathing air or oxygen at pressures greater than normal atmospheric pressure.Which is not quite the same.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dtd7p,Shadows4,2,Sun Jul 19 07:03:26 2015 UTC,"Your point about how everything that can occur will occur at one point if time is infinite  is correct. Your post is rather long so i will only adress this one point and the main question about immortality.  It seems to me that through your thoughts about time have stumbled upon another very interesting topic in philosophy, the question of what defines a thing. Bear with me and I will eventually get to your question.  Take for example a ship, lets call it ""Lady"". To make the ship lasts longer the ship repair guy takes one plank of the ship every day and replaces it with a new plank, he stores the planks in a warehouse. After many years every plank in the ship is replaced. Another guy comes along and find the planks and the plan for the ship, and with those he builds an identical ship he calls ""Mother"". My question is now which ship is the original, what counts as the real ship? Is it Lady or Mother?  The more you think about it the harder the question is to answer, but for me the best answer is Lady. The reason for that is that I emphasize continuity in the existence of the object. Our existence as persons are a fleeting continuity that is always changing. I'm not the same I was 5 minutes ago, but I'm still me because I'm connected to me 5 minutes ago. On the other hand I'm not connected to an equal state of matter as myself that may be existing 500 trillion years in the future, so I will not define it as myself.  But what happens if I clone myself? Is that exact copy a real me? And which is really the clone and which is the real person? This question is a lot harder to answer and here the continuity does not help.   I don't have a sufficient answer for you, just some additional questions and problems that might help."

I don't see how you could make a human coherent enough to have any effect on another branch though.  For a more spatial type of multiverse, where universes are basically different causally disconnected regions of spacetime, then I guess you would need something like a wormhole to be able to go from one place to a distant other.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,7thking,3,Sat Jul 18 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is that for most of human existance, humans were near their carrying capacity.  That is we had as many people as the available resources could support.  As technology and farming practices improved, so did our carrying capacity, allowing us to have more people.  After a plague, the population is lower, but quickly recovers to reach the carrying capacity.  Currently, humans are growing nearly exponentially, because our carrying capacity is much higher than in the past.  Many models predict that human growth will become logarithmic.  So I suspect that if there were no major plagues or wars, human population would be pretty similar to what it is today, and if it were in fact higher, growth would be in the logarithmic phase."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,gimanswirve,3,Sat Jul 18 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly right.    For most of human history our technology advanced expansively. Only recently has it become intensive.

Agriculture developed independently in at least 5 places in response to the lack of further lands to expand into (only continent this didn't happen was Australia).

AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,gimanswirve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:24 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, according to the logistic growth model, if we can't support 12 billion people, we wouldn't have 12 billion people.

If we suddenly had 5 billion more people we would not be able to support them, we don't have the infrastructure.  But if we didn't have those deaths in the past we wouldn't suddenly have 5 billion more people, those people would be productive members of society who are contributing, and would have accumulated slowly (or not at all, if they couldn't have been supported).

AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,AngelusInferni,2,Sun Jul 19 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure about that with regards to the baby boom after a big war.  Historically in warfare, lots of men die, but few women do.  Females are the limiting factor in the maximum possible population growth and polygamy was common prior to the modern era.  Even in the modern world, there are many single unmarried mothers and sex outside of marriage is common.  This suggests to me that the deaths of the men is not likely to have a significant effect on the future population.  WW2 is a bit of an exception because of the significant number of civilian casualties, but even so the deaths of men was higher than that of women."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,AngelusInferni,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"The current population of the earth is close to 7.3 billion(source 1 and source 2 taken off a google search). Wikipedia says 7 billion in 2012 so 7.3 billion is safe growth assumption for 3 years.   With that in perspective, we know that the living space per person is decreasing rapidly (0.06961 sq. km. per person in 2015 from 0.0888 sq. km. per person in 1995) and as such natural resources are dwindling as fuck. So we're in pretty sticky situation already.  We can never say that suddenly ~2 billion who died in wars and plagues are suddenly alive to bump the population to 9.3 billion.   Therefore the deaths data that you have linked to shows that there were some 'x' deaths and if we combine that factor to the normal(death due to natural causes) death rate of that time to get the real death rate we would see that the death rate would jump and birth:death ratio would be less than 1.   What we can see is the birth and death rates. A theoretical analysis with estimation(lots of it) shows that since the death rates would have not bumped up due to the unnatural death and the birth:death ratio would have remained more or less stable...  Which is a bad thing as the population may have resulted in say,  4-5 billion more than the current populations.  I'm lazy af but if you want the math I'll type it up or if you think anything is wrong just tell me."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,AngelusInferni,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I fully understand, but do you mean to say that it is not that the population would increase only 2 billion if wars and plagues did not happen, but upto 5 billion.  That is... scary. What would've happened to us if there were 12 billion on earth right now? Surely our scientific advances wouldn't have been that advance to support this (like outer planet colonization)"
AskScienceDiscussion,3dqwjy,AngelusInferni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:52 2015 UTC,Indeed. The thing is that if you try and produce a logarithmic or geometric progression of the population explosion given that 2 billion people didn't die then I'd say 12 billion is a fairly accurate estimate.  This is of course assuming that the people on Earth die naturally and not by any of the wars or diseases mentioned in the question.
AskScienceDiscussion,3dq8te,cdrchandler,8,Sat Jul 18 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"This comment explains it in a way that I can't.  A relatively short clip from that comment:   The things that look the most different when wet are those that are rough/irregular/dusty when dry. The irregularity of the surface at a microscopic scale means that light ends up hitting the material at a wide variety of (essentially) random angles. This results in a scattering effect that bounces incident light away from the object in random directions. The larger the fraction of incident light that is scattered the ""lighter"" the object will appear.  Covering the surface with a liquid has the same effect as polishing it. The liquid fills in all the tiny bumps and crevices in the surface of the object, providing a smoother, more uniform interface with the air. There is still a jagged liquid-object interface underneath that, but since the refractive index of the liquid will be much closer to the object than the air was, light will tend to be transmitted to the object from the liquid rather than bouncing back from that liquid-object interface."

Every time this happens the fabric will absorb a little more of the light and thus what escapes and makes it to your eye is less intense and appears darker."

We know that we can describe distance and depth with sound, and with the ability to analyze an emitted sound would allow us to do this. Bats do this by emitting a sound themselves, with echolocation. Furthermore, sonar allows us to describe the bottom of a body of water using sound waves. If we are able to accurately describe our surroundings with sound, this means that we could ""see"" it in our heads. Our brains just aren't adapted to normally think this way.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dorju,dagit,7,Sat Jul 18 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of an over-simplification. There are several ""parts"" to the gravitational field (the metric). To understand all of this you need to study the Hamiltonian formulation of a gauge field theory.  There are the truly dynamical degrees of freedom (DoF), which are radiative—those are the two gravitational wave polarizations. There are the Coulomb-type fields. And finally there are the pure gauge modes.  Only the first DoFs travel at the speed of light[1]. They satisfy hyperbolic (wave-type) equations. The Coulomb-type fields satisfy elliptic constraint equations (Laplace-type). The gauge degrees of freedom are not physically relevant.  The part of gravity that makes things fall towards the Earth, or makes the Earth fall towards the Sun—that's the Coulombic part of the metric. That part is, in the post-Newtonian sense, ""instantaneous."" However, that doesn't carry any information; it's satisfying a constraint equation. Information about changes in the distribution of sources show up in the radiative part (the gravitational waves), which do travel at the speed of light[1].  Because gravity couples so weakly, a gravitational wave signal from e.g. a core-collapse supernova is essentially unimpeded. Meanwhile, photons have to bounce around inside of an expanding cloud of ejected gas before we see them[2]. So to answer your question, yes, you can get a gravitational signal before an electromagnetic signal.  [1] We should really say that it is light that is traveling at the speed of gravity, and not vice versa. Gravity is encoded in the metric. The metric also happens to determine the speed of propagation of light.  [2] The bigger effect, though, is that a SN's light curve ramps up as the ejecta expand, just because of the geometrical effect of having a larger emitting surface area. This happens on the timescale of days—weeks, and the SN ejecta stay bright while the Ni-56 is decaying."

AskScienceDiscussion,3doqth,zonine,4,Sat Jul 18 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"To my mind, science is changing to be more collaborative. Actually, it's always been collaborative but now people are more accepting of that and less likely to look for the 'big name' that leads a lab, but rather the whole lab collaboration instead. Look at places like CERN - I doubt many can name a scientist leading the efforts there (except perhaps because they have more exposure in our relative countries) as research is published as collaborations. The exceptional results CERN is getting will probably be remembered for a long time (and they will continue to get them), but I doubt any one person will be assigned to those memories.   This is evident elsewhere - more and more nobel prizes are being shared, and more and more nobel prizes are dependent on the hard work of large teams of people that are actually being praised for that. In fact, the 'Nobel Winner' is becoming less and less relevant. There are still great minds that make leaps on their own, but I think people are more aware that even then they are dependent on teams rather than individuals.  In terms of names I would say that you haven't mentioned, Watson and Crick spring to mind, Feynman, Hawking, Pauling, Higgs.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dob5s,BarshaL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"It's not quite as simple as that.  We don't really have the tools to go in and precisely excise just the bits and pieces we're interested in.  The ""junk"" DNA (horrible name, by the way) is particularly difficult because it includes a lot of repetitive DNA sequences - the same sequence repeated over and over and over again.  Repetitive sequences are hard to target with the tools we have, because they tend to use unique sequences to find their targets.  Now, I do remember something about a decade or so back where one group started deleting every nonessential gene they could find in a bacteria with a very small genome, trying to figure out what the minimum necessary complement was.  They got down pretty far, as I recall, but also pointed out that a lot of genes required to live in the wild aren't needed for life in the lab.  In model organisms, like fruit flies, you can buy ""deficiency libraries"".  These are fly strains that carry large deletions.  Each strain is missing a chunk of one chromosome.  The library of strains as a whole covers pretty much the entire genome.  These are useful tools for mapping mutations.  But most scientists these days would agree that at least a large percentage of ""junk"" DNA is likely to have some useful function.  We already know that there's far more to the genome than just encoding proteins.    There's also an interesting discussion to be had about exactly what it means for a piece of DNA to have a ""function"".  You're probably going to get an earful about the ENCODE project, which claimed to have found useful functions for nearly all of the supposed ""junk"" DNA in humans.  There's quite a bit of controversy about that because they used extremely liberal definitions of ""functional"", and a lot of biologists disagree with their conclusions.  Debate is ongoing."

Basically, body dysmorphia responds to clinical therapy and psychopharmaceuticals, whereas gender dysphoria does not (hormones, despite their affect for mood variation are not classified as psychopharmaceuticals). This is in part why there is a push to ban conversion therapies. You can't make a homosexual person straight and the same follows for transgender people. LGBTQ evolve from the same wellspring intersection of gender and sexuality that appears to be mostly congenital in nature and our understanding of gender today is of a spectrum and not a binary. Body dysmorphia, as you mentioned, is an unhealthy preoccupation.  ""Should we embrace one and emend the other"" is a philosophical question, not a scientific one. There exists a plethora of scientific literature to back up the experience and treatment of gender dysphoria. In much the same way that we don't need to keep proving that the Earth is a sphere, society's reluctance towards education on the subject is what imperils us to asking such questions, repeatedly.  If you're here asking these questions because you were enticed by something from Paul McHue, Ray Blanchard, or J.

Since we know QM isn't the end, as far as we have observed quantization isn't a fundamental property of the universe.    It's a fundamental aspect of the most fundamental level we have observed. Speculation beyond that is just speculation!   Perhaps it's an error to assume continuous over discrete as our default, but as that's been the rule for everything we do understand   I feel like I'm talking in circles, everything that appears continuous is made of quantum-level events, which themselves are discrete.   You're assuming that things beyond which those are known have a certain character, while I'm merely saying that things at the border of what we know have a certain character. Our current description of the universe involves a base of quantum events, which themselves are discrete.

This expansion only comes into play at very large distances, ie galatic distances. Otherwise, you'd notice all your atoms getting further apart from one another pretty quickly.   is small space finite?   I don't know for certain, but our ability to measure things that small is fundamentally limited in the current physics we have. Beyond what's called the Planck scale, measurements in the traditional sense lose a lot of meaning because space as we understand it begins to break down.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dma8d,arkfille,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:49 2015 UTC,"Psychiatry is strictly a medical discipline - to become a psychiatrist you have to become a doctor of medicine, and then specialize in psychiatry. Psychiatry is essentially diagnosis and treatment, usually with medication or psychotherapy referrals - the medical model applied to mental health.  Neuroscience in itself is a science offshoot of biology. You'll likely cover this in undergrad biology, and though it can relate to psychopathology, you'll more likely be studying neurological disorders, and studying how the core brain functions on a lower level (neurons, synapses, oligodendroglia). This is the most scientific of the disciplines discussed here, and one that's at the forefront of advancing science at that.  Psychology breaks down in two ways. In itself it's the science of the mind moreso than the brain, and thus covers more emergent concepts (cognitive heuristics, developmental psychology, theories of mind and social psychology); consequently, you'll learn more about psychopathology. However, there's also Clinical Psychology, which is basically the equivalent of psychiatry but for psychologists instead of doctors, and is thus seen as a competing paradigm against the prevailing medical model. Clinical Psychologists are less keen on diagnosis and more keen on figuring out exactly what's going on with an individual and solving things through formulation - kinda like counselling but scientific and on steroids.  These both overlap. You also get Neuropsychology, which is basically the extension of psychology through neuroscience - how emergent behaviours of the brain relate to underpinning neuroscience (left-handedness, colourblindness, aphasias, autism, etc). You then also get Clinical Neuropsychology, which is a really new field that spreads Clinical Psychology into neuroscience."

This is a very common sentiment those outside the field have.  It's hypercritical of psychology, and doesn't recognize the often fuzzy nature of the sub-fields you seem to be interested in.  Psychology and neuroscience do have aspects which don't intersect.  As an example, there are some parts of social psychology which don't draw on neuroscience, and those who study motor neurons very rarely draw on psychological science.  However, you said you're interested in the mind and psychopathology -- this is the sort of field where what is neuroscience and what is psychology is blurry and dependent on who you ask.  Brain scanning was mentioned -- often people who do work with EEG, fMRI, etc., to study cognition, will refer to themselves as cognitive neuroscientists.  That said, these people often have PhDs in psychology, and are often part of psychology departments.  Cognitive science, cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral psychology, behavioral neuroscience, neuropsychology,  -- these are just some of the names people give fields in which psychology and neuroscience intersect (along with other disciplines, such as philosophy, computer science, physics, etc.).   If you're an undergrad, or going to be an undergrad, honestly it doesn't matter.  You could study psychology, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science -- whatever.  The trick is to find which niche of neuroscience interests you.  If you're into cognition, sticking with psychology or philosophy might suit you better, but it's unlikely this will matter if you intend to pursue graduate school.  Rather worrying about which major you should have, you'll want to get involved in research that interests you, and make sure you round out your education with electives from the fields you aren't majoring in.  Research experience and passion is key to pursuing graduate studies.  When it comes time for a PhD, if that's your jam, you shouldn't necessarily focus on one type of degree (say, ""Neuroscience"").  You should instead find researchers who are doing good work you want to be a part of, and apply to the program they are a part of.  My interests were initially in cognition, and I applied for graduate programs in neuroscience, more bio-heavy neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology -- I was admitted to a variety of them with a background in biology.  If you're interested in pathology, don't rule out clinical careers either.  You can go the MD/DO route and do neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry or what have you, or go the route of the clinical psychologist.  If you're interested in this, you'll want to be sure to get some exposure by volunteering and shadowing professionals."

Because I'd much rather work on imaging, simulation studies, and interfaces than spend my time trying to design and interpret the results of non-invasive surveys and response.

Then I got a Ph.D. in math, and now I'm a computer science professor.) If you live near a university, then they may have quite a bit to offer you. You may be able to get borrowing privileges at their library, including interlibrary loan. I don't know how your son does in groups, but in a year or three, he will be eligible for summer programs that many universities offer, which are often ""let's have some fun with this field"".

I've known people who majored in physics in college, and did very well at it, despite not having taken a physics course or even knowing much about physics when they started. But I do not know of anyone who has done well studying physics without becoming very comfortable with a certain level of math beforehand.  I would also point out that actually getting to be a physicist takes a lot more than just being good at physics these days. For example, it takes social skills to be able to make professional connections, presentation skills to be able to explain your work to audiences at varying levels of familiarity, a certain level of what some people might call an ego to promote yourself effectively as a candidate for awards and job openings, and so on. The point is, if you were to take the attitude that everything else in a normal child's development takes a back seat to studying, you wouldn't necessarily be helping your son in his goal. (Your post doesn't give me any reason to believe you do this, but it's just something to be aware of.)  Even with all that, it takes a lot of luck to become a physicist because there are many people in the running for very few jobs. I would not advise anyone to get ""stuck"" on that career path - it's good to have a backup plan, at least, and if your son does happen to come across something else that he likes doing (as many people do, in college), it'll be a good idea for him to develop his interest in that as well."
AskScienceDiscussion,3died2,The_Wisenheimer,7,Thu Jul 16 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"The cruel truth is that your son, very quickly if he is able to follow the standard curriculum, is possibly going to get to a level of mathematical education that you are ill-equipped to teach.  I do not know anything about your particular situation, but the standard college curriculum is such that he should have passed precalculus or calculus by the time he has graduated from high school.    You should evaluate whether your own education prepares you to teach at that level and, if not, whether it would be preferable to send him to school or hire a tutor.  At the age of 12, probably the best books to buy would be popular science books and periodicals: Discover, Scientific American, books by science popularizers like Carl Sagan and Issac Asimov (old school) or Steven Hawking and Michael Kaku.    He sounds like he might be interested in theoretical astrophysics, which means astronomy might be a hobby that you can learn together from observatories, planetariums, science museums, et cetera.  If you cannot afford the books and magazines, check them out from the local library."

Maybe not this year, maybe not next year, but you should always be putting ads out looking for the perfect tutor for your son.  I would suggest looking for a very special physics/math/engineering PhD student.  Maybe there is an online resource of tutors for gifted children.  Also, others have mentioned looking into other subjects like computer science and math. I would also expose him to entrepreneurship. Finding truths of the universe is very enchanting, but there is also something very very fulfilling in creating value for other people and changing the course of humanity.  I think you son would connect with a lot of the greatest modern entrepreneurs.  For example, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Max Levchin and the entire Paypal Mafia."
AskScienceDiscussion,3died2,tauneutrino9,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone here has great recommendations.  I would also recommend to take him to visit science labs so he can talk to scientists.  He would learn a lot just by those conversations, and they can guide him to certain resources or other science labs to visit.  Those experiences can have a profound effect on what he would want to do and what he finds most interesting.    At least from my personal experience, lots and lots of books.  I knew I wanted to be a physicist when I was 11 and was interested in the same topics as your son.  The more I read and the visits I made to various labs ended up changing my focus.  It is hard to tell from your description what you mean by children books and adult science books.  Do you mean textbooks for adult books or science books meant for adults?  The latter tends to not have much math compared to the former.   Either way, I would either get him those books used or go to a library.  If he is as interested as I was at his age, he would go through them quickly.    Everyone recommends math, which is true to some extent.  It really depends on what he is interested in.  Theorists use math all the time, experimentalists like myself use it occasionally.  Once you learn calculus you can really get the more advanced textbooks.  If he already knows algebra, I would recommend a precalculus and calculus book.  I started teaching myself calculus when I was 14.  This allowed me to understand more advanced physics books.    Finally, don't worry if he starts to go beyond what you can reasonably talk about.  Always listen and try to foster this interest.   From what my parents tell me now, they had no idea what I was talking about from about age 13 on.  They still encouraged me to pursue physics and helped by getting me books and taking me to science related things.  The benefit now compared to 15 years ago is the internet can be your friend.  There are so many great sites on physics.  Even allow him to ask questions on /r/askscience is a great resource.  I wish I had that when I was a kid."
AskScienceDiscussion,3died2,MurphysLab,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"Quite a few universities have freely accessible online courses if your son's serious (e.g. Udacity has an intro to physics course). But he probably doesn't need to get too far ahead of things at age 12. If and when he gets into university he will likely have a difficult-enough time depending on how Autistic he is; arriving too early at university may not work out well.   I understand your position and reasons for home schooling:   My wife and I home school my son. Partly because of issues with bullies, but also because where we live, they teach religion based science instead of factual science.   However learning social skills, as pointed out by others here, is highly important for one to succeed as a professional scientist. Making connections, collaborating, presenting research, engaging in informal discussions, and even hitting the pub or conversing over appetizers at a conference are all skills that one needs to have to be an effective scientist. (Plus the ability to do interviews!!) So I would encourage you to stick him in school, even if the curriculum isn't taught perfectly. One of my friends, a fellow grad student at r/uAlberta, and all-round generally really intelligent guy, once told me about his parents' decision to have him attend public school: they could teach him everything in math, science, literature, etc... but you can't teach a person the social skills that they need by keeping them at home.  If school absolutely isn't an option, find other options.     I want to add a few things that you might not realize, and which a lot of folks don't know about before entering university:    First: physics isn't the only option if one wants to study physics. Another, possibly better degree to pursue when your son's an undergrad might be Engineering Physics: It's hardcore physics plus engineering, provides research exposure, and also includes a professional designation as a fall-back; another alternative is pure or applied math.  Second: grad school is the real place where people become a physicist. But you don't necessarily have to do a physics degree as an undergrad in order to do a PhD or MSc in physics: math or engineering physics are good options that could get a person there as well. (Computing Science might also be an option...) As long as they have some physics courses related to what they want to study.  Third: Once a physicist, it can be difficult to find a job, especially doing cosmology-type stuff. One friend who worked at CERN doing her PhD had to switch into a medical physics program after because a PhD in physics can be daunting to employers... despite her extensive experience and skill at computer programming -- she also briefly considered doing a 2nd undergrad to become an engineer just in order to get a job!!. (Also note: computer programming is an important skill for physicists. No harm in teaching him early!) Opt for a university with a co-op program. Do co-op... it's both work experience and it's a chance to discover what one enjoys doing.     For books: I would suggest going down to your local used book store and picking up some old physics textbooks: a slightly older edition is fine, and will be significantly cheaper ($10 vs $150) -- if you live anywhere with a university, they should have lots; consider grabbing a few popular physics books (e.g. A Brief History of Time) as well. Maybe even the Feynman Lectures on Physics (although it can also be accessed online for free). Speaking of online stuff, the HyperPhysics is a pretty good intro to numerous topics.   Your son can also read preprints of physics papers at arXiv.org if he's really curious. Most physics papers get posted there before they're published. Often the published copy is behind a paywall, but the copies on arXiv are free.   Of course there's always Wikipedia! It's better than any book. Teach him how to use it to find the answers to his questions... or post questions with him to r/AskScience    Lastly: keep science and math fun for your son. Kerbal Space Program helps people intuitively learn physics and it's fun. Hands-on experiments that you can do at home... should be fun! And in the summer, chances are a university near you might offer a science summer camp.   Speaking of fun (and Feynman), try reading this with your son: It's as Simple as One, Two, Three it's a story told by Richard Feynman, and I've read it several times to young students (usually in grade 5 or 6) that explains how you can do science without a complex lab, texting questions and hypotheses... and it's a story with some rather humorous points in it. I think that he may appreciate it."

AskScienceDiscussion,3died2,StringOfLights,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:43:59 2015 UTC,"With Home schooling our son, we can help gear him towards taking college courses online when he is 16, before entering a formal college campus to get ahead of the curve on pre-req's and the like.    One thing that I think is getting lost here is that being in a research field requires a lot of skills beyond just being a whiz in whatever subject of interest. Physics, math, and programming are really important, but researchers also have to write. A lot. Many scientists don't like the process of writing even though it's integral to academia. If he doesn't like doing research papers in school, he's not going to like academia.  Also, since it seems like you're concerned about his ability to navigate social situations (e.g. he's being homeschooled and you're planning on having him continue to live at home for undergrad) I would probably make that the focus of your plan. He sounds intelligent and I'm sure coursework won't be an issue.   You move around a lot in academia. First for grad school, then (usually) for postdocs, then for jobs. You don't get to pick where you live; you move to where you get hired. You work in a department where you see the same faces every day. You almost always teach various classes, often in big lecture halls. He will need to be comfortable with all of that to succeed. Having him live independently for the first time when he goes to grad school might be very stressful for him. He may not be happy in a shared office space where he could be sitting by the same person for two or three years. There are accommodations that can be made, but there are still limitations inherent to the field. Whether it's figuring out what therapy is best for him or what accommodations might exist, I'd incorporate all of that into your plan.  It sucks to bring that kind of stuff up, but I think there are aspects of academia that get overlooked, so I wanted to mention them."

Its front page is good. Many of the linked articles should be accessible to tech-savvy 18-22 year-old traditional students. Some stories, especially the ones about tech and society, could prompt some good editorials from engineering students.  If your university has a law school, do not underestimate the importance of science-savvy lawyers representing the interests of injured parties, defendants, and the masses in front of judges around the country. I find that they tend to have very interesting and unique takes on science topics.  Edit: I should weigh in on your request for finding news/media outlets that have solid science reporting that is of higher caliber or depth than ""pop science"" stories. Thoroughness and accessibility are generally at odds with each other, i.e. there is no media outlet that puts out accessible science articles that are not ""pop science."" That's what scholarly journals are for, and they generally take a good amount of foundational or even graduate-level science to understand. If everyday people could simultaneously understand the contents of a patent for a new low-emission engines and the reproductive cycle of a newly discovered species of nematode, we wouldn't need media outlets to report on science at all - people would just read those patents and journal articles in their daily paper.  It's the very purpose of journalists to read, comprehend, condense, and convey. Good luck.  Edit 2: I don't know enough about science writing for a layperson audience to provide specific tips or recommendations. Aside from science journalists, science fiction writers excel in conveying ideas about science and technology to laypeople. You could try /r/writing or look for other online communities for those people. You might try reaching out to noteworthy science writers, themselves. Perhaps have a student editor reach out (if you're university staff and not a student). People generally like helping university students.  Whenever I give a presentation on a topic to a crowd whose expertise in the field I'm not 100% sure of, I try to adhere to the principle of starting out at a 5th grade level, splitting time between jr high/high school, college, and graduate levels of familiarity. You're always going to have someone bored, someone enthralled, and someone lost by the level you're talking at. You can either have address a variety of levels in a single edition of your paper or you can address each level in most articles.

Unlike a jet engine, which can be taken apart and reassembled, a computer mainboard is not composed of pieces meant to be removed and they would likely break it.  The biggest obstacle is the CPU.  To examine it would require the removal of the casing, likely destroying it in the process and making it unrecognizable.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dhzw9,i_invented_the_ipod,7,Thu Jul 16 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Some people are saying ""there's nothing really radically new in the Macbook, it's just smaller-scale than computers of the time"". Or ""there'd be no way to reverse-engineer the chips without destroying them"".  I don't think either of these is really quite accurate. If you look at the state of things in 1965:  http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?year=1965  People were still making computers out of discrete components. Integrated circuits existed, but at the level of single logic gates, not something like a modern IC. The idea of such large-scale integration as we see today wasn't in people's thoughts at that point.  People talking about taking the computer apart to reverse-engineer the chips are at some level missing the point. If a computer showed up in 1965 that was (roughly) a million times faster than the fastest computers currently available, nobody would dare to take it apart - it'd be worth billions of dollars (in 1965 dollars!).  You could learn a lot from a Macbook without tearing it apart, though.   Just looking at the back plate, you'd learn about the rise of high-tech manufacturing in China over the next 50 years, which would be pretty mind-blowing from the perspective of 1965. There's also an FCC logo, so you'd know that it had a radio transmitter of some sort in it (more on that later).  Any machinist looking at the case would be absolutely baffled by it. There are parts of the design that could be made with conventional machine tools, but the speaker grille on the macbook is drilled with a laser, which again, is something that people knew about in 1965, but the idea of using a laser in mass-manufacturing wouldn't come along for decades. Just looking at the case, you'd either have to assume it was custom-made, and incredibly-expensive, or that it was made with some kind of automated machinery.   If you could get permission to take off the back cover, you'd find a huge battery, prominently-labelled as a Lithium battery, with the capacity in Watt-hours. A rechargeable lithium battery is something many/most experts would not have believed could be built at the time.  I'm going to assume that the developer tools aren't installed, because that would be such a huge advancement over the then-current state of the art.  But even the standard OS X install has a lot of ""power user"" features like the Terminal, which has a whole set of UNIX command-line tools, and an extensive manual system. There are even a few programming-language interpreters, which would still be faster than the fastest supercomputers of the time, despite not making optimal use of the CPU.  You could spend a long time just reading the manual pages - much of the UNIX API is described there, as well as technologies like data compression (lossless and lossy), public-key cryptography (unknown outside of the government at that time), and probably many other things I'm forgetting.  Wireless networking is pretty-prominently featured in the OS X user-interface, so that'd get people thinking in that direction earlier. You'd probably not develop Wi-Fi from first principles by observing the emissions of the Macbook, but it'd pretty obviously be a very high-frequency radio that transmits in a narrow band that changes over time. So, spread-spectrum radio arrives a few decades earlier than its first use, and the whole way we allocate and use radio spectrum would be radically different.  And while you're in the System Preferences, you'll find that the OS supports running the computer in dozens of languages, including Chinese, Arabic, and Russian(!), which again would be unbelievable in 1965. You could learn about Unicode from the special characters panel, perhaps allowing us to skip those decades where computers could only (mostly) handle English text.  Some of the built-in apps would be utterly-baffling. Photo Booth makes a kind of sense, but where are they hiding the video camera? And why would you include a feature like this on a supercomputer? I wonder how long they'd wait before running ""Time Machine"" for the first time? ""Garage Band"" isn't a term they used back then, but even the idea of creating music on a computer would be radical. And the Apple loops collection has samples from musical styles that hadn't even been developed yet in 1965.  So, yeah - the hardware would mostly be inscrutable, except as an inspiration for what's possible. The software would be an absolute treasure-trove of fantastic ideas that took decades to develop, though."

They knew about integrated circuits back then, so the only difference is how many transistors they could fit on a die compared to us. I'm sure they knew, in theory, how to get the density we take for granted, they just didn't have the machines to do it. On the other hand, knowing how to fabricate a modern CPU doesn't mean you know how to design one.  Liquid crystals and LEDs had also been invented (barely) by that time, so people would have been able to grasp how the screen works. Maybe the battery technology would be truly unknown.  I'm sure they'd be impressed by how far the technology could be pushed, but I don't think they could learn much they hadn't already thought of.

If you're wondering about one of the inner planets (all of which are rock), then it would be Venus. The atmosphere is mainly carbon dioxide, which has a greenhouse effect giving the surface temperature just below 500 degrees Celsius. The air pressure is 90 times that of Earth's atmospheric pressure. I think it would be almost impossible to set up a colony there.   However it is most similar in size to earth, with a g-force about 90% of that on earth. If these previous limitations were to be overcome then it would be the planet that the human body would most easily adjust to. I'm not sure what long term effects it would have on someone though, probably a slight weakening of the bones and muscles.  The days on Venus are 116 earth days, meaning that during the night time any plants that are grown would have to be under artificial light.  EDIT: Okay so I answered that just looking at the title.

That's generally expected. Unless you're a specialist in that field, I'd be amazed if most people could keep up and keep going.  May I ask what your background is? Biologist here, and it can be tough to jump into a new field, but that's because the cutting edge research requires a ton of background and foundation, and the scope is contextual. If you're asking whether you can understand a field by using google, then I wouldn't be surprised you're having a tough time. I generally refer people to 'the illustrated phd' (http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/[1] ) Papers are generally written for the scientific community. Any paper that's putting forth a new ""dent"" in that wall is targeted towards people who intimately know that area. You need to know every nook and cranny of that wall to truly appreciate that new ""dent"" outwards. I have a PhD, but I specialize in infectious diseases and pathogenesis. When I read papers on cancer, for example, I can understand what they're saying/doing, but in most cases the impact and broader scope is lost on me. (And heck, my grasp of molecular biology is very, very good. But it's a totally different world to me!) I just don't understand the years and years and years of hundreds of hundreds of research articles that are the foundation that supported and launched this research. That's why I asked what your background is, and perhaps what level of education/training/experience? In (biology, at least), we have an incredible width and depth of knowledge in quite a lot of fields. That'll never come across through a casual literature search. It's part of the reason why ""reviews"" exist. The 'intro/discussion' of most papers is meant to be contextual to that field/area/specific-line of questioning. It's meant to orient you to where on the wall they think they're making the dent. The broader scope, as in the illustrative link above, is likely to be lost or difficult to conceptualize for most everyone else.

For example, let's assume that pixels are quantized (since they are). And any given particle in our world can only exist as an integer number of pixels. Motion in this world is therefore quantized, because the video game objects can only move in steps of pixels. Because they can only move in steps of pixels, the product of the velocity/momentum and position can only be known to some constant related to pixel size.  For large objects, that take up many (1020) pixels lengths, this limit in knowledge would be trivial. The location would be known. But for small objects on the order of 1 pixel, this would be much more pronounced, and the location could only be estimated within some uncertainty.  Is this analogous to QM, except in a video game world?  Of course, in this scenario it's not clear that being outside the world would provide more knowledge than being inside. Except that outside we can make observations much smaller than one pixel size, but inside a character with 'eyes' made of pixels and instruments made of pixels would not be able to."

There is a lot of heavy analysis required and the number of neurons you get per recording can be very low (e.g. one neuron per recording site). This means you need to collect a lot of data from a lot of recording sites. Additionally, the skulls acts as a very strong low-pass filter, so the signal you get with scalp recordings wouldn't contain discernible action potentials. You also miss a lot of higher frequency local field potential that you would normally see with implanted electrodes. I think this is the major limitation that prevents technologies that try to use scalp EEG for brain machine interface systems. It doesn't matter how many recording sites you have, if the signal is massively filtered you simply can't extract enough meaningful information to get consistent, specific signals for particular patterns of brain activity. With the amount of noise in the system everything ends up looking very similar.

It highlights something absolutely crucial that I completely forgot to mention - that not all frequencies of light are visible. Visible light is just one small slice of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, which includes everything from radio waves at the low end through X-Rays at the high end.  Parts of human anatomy are transparent to X-Rays (the soft, fleshy stuff) and other parts (bones and, to an extent cartilage) are almost entirely opaque. The human body is almost completely transparent to radio waves - they pass straight through us. In fact, most things are either completely transparent or highly translucent (they let a percentage through and block/reflect the rest); radio signals can pass through buildings, but they get slightly weaker and if there are enough buildings (or building material) between the transmitter and the receiver, the signal will be very weak or completely non-existent. To be completely accurate, parts of the human body are actually only translucent to even visible light - you can shine a light through your hand and see it on the other side, and light shone directly into, say, your abdomen, will penetrate partially into your body. Most tissues are opaque only past a certain thickness - even blood, which you'd pretty-much automatically say is opaque, is translucent when spread very thin."

AskScienceDiscussion,3dhmc1,Walan_ben,4,Thu Jul 16 11:53:25 2015 UTC,"The reaction to Pluto's demotion is distinctive both for its unusual endurance and its highly specific nature. Science, after all, changes its mind all the time as new evidence comes in, but most of the time, the general public do little more than shrug. So what's different about this case?  I see this as a cautionary tale about the gradual evolution of how scientists engage with the public. The real root of the problem is that (1) it's actually very difficult to come up with an unambiguous definition of a ""planet"" and (2) it is simultaneously very easy to hand-wave a vague layman's definition. Rather than try to ameliorate the imprecise and even contradictory definition of planet that most people have, astronomers spent several generations enthusiastically promoting ""Science!"" (especially during the glory days of the space race) while sweeping the technical details under the rug.  Gradually, the problem has become more and more difficult to ignore. Setting aside Ceres (which was demoted from planet to asteroid in the 19th century, before public fascination with space hit its rocket-powered stride), the identification of other Kupier Belt objects forced scientists to finally revisit the definition of ""planet"" that they had known for a long time was too loose to be used scientifically. An inconsistent definition is not an option, so either the number of ""planets"" in the solar system had to grow, or it had to shrink. So, the definition was made precise, using technical criteria. Pluto did not meet these criteria.  To the public, this constituted inscrutable pedantry. After all, it's not as thought anything new about Pluto had been discovered. Most people in the general public were at best dimly aware of Eris or Ceres and most had no awareness of Haumea or Makemake. Instead, the scientific community declared, ""We're changing what words mean"" in a way that, to the man on the street, appeared unexpected and unwarranted.

Yes, this would necessitate educating the public about Ceres, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, and yes, that would have been awkward because everyone would have to learn that there is a ""planet"" between Mars and Jupiter, but overall, I think it would have been seen as a step forward. People might grumble about need to learn a few more names, but they wouldn't feel like they're being contradicted.

Specifically (at least here in the US), journalism is very preoccupied with always presenting an air of unbias, and the way they do that is generally by giving both sides of any question an equal amount of air time. That can often make it seem like both sides of a debate are equally popular and equally viable, when one side may actually be both much more popular and have a much stronger logical foundation.  On top of that, news has to fill time, and a story about a protest about Pluto fills both the ""gee whiz"" quota for the day and ostensibly counts as a science story.  From there, I think that people pick sides on the Pluto debate basically because it's fun. The categorization of Pluto as a planet or not really has no bearing on most people's lives, but it can be fun to pick one of the sides and come up with ridiculous arguments for it.

But pretty much the entire scientific community who aren't hardcore phylogeneticists is going to completely ignore this.  This is a more general problem in phylogeny, because it's meant to serve two purposes that directly conflict with each other: phylogeneticists want names that reflect the relationships between organisms, and follow well defined rules.  Everybody else wants names that stay stable so they can consistently refer to things.    I tend to favor keeping drosophilia as the name of the fruit fly (they could just rename the other half of the genus, it's only historical chance that ""drosophilia was first applied there) and demoting Pluto, but despite the fact that I come down on opposite sides of each argument, maybe it's the same kind of thing.  Just like most biologists just want names to stay stable, maybe most people just want planet names to stay stable."

That's not to denigrate the team -- they've done an amazing, bang-up job, and NH was just barely feasible with current launch technology and a fast flyby.  Going into orbit would require launching a rocket that is proportionally as much bigger than NH's launch vehicle, as NH's launch vehicle was bigger than NH -- in other words something even larger than Von Braun's NOVA concept  (examine the right-hand rocket in that diagram, and compare it to the Saturn V, second from the right)."

AskScienceDiscussion,3ddy07,Pseudohausen,11,Wed Jul 15 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say at the very earliest, sometime after the development of radio (in the late 1800s), assuming a perfect mirror of Earth's civilization.  I disagree that signs of early modern civilization would be visible through early modern telescopes: for reference, this is about the time when ice caps were spotted on Mars (as were a bunch of nonexistant canals).  I think the first evidence might be a really strong radio transmission on one planet being observed by individuals on another planet.  I'd be interested to hear from someone who knows more about early radio technology to find out if early spark-gap transmissions or broadcasts would be detectable across that distance.  Early radio pioneers did realize the possibility as early as 1900, and I found the following fascinating quote from the wiki article on SETI:   On August 21–23, 1924, Mars entered an opposition closer to Earth than any time in a century before or the next 80 years.[12] In the United States, a ""National Radio Silence Day"" was promoted during a 36-hour period from the 21–23, with all radios quiet for five minutes on the hour, every hour. At the United States Naval Observatory, a radio receiver was lifted 3 kilometers (2 miles) above the ground in a dirigible tuned to a wavelength between 8 and 9 kilometers (~5 miles), using a ""radio-camera"" developed by Amherst College and Charles Francis Jenkins. The program was led by David Peck Todd with the military assistance of Admiral Edward W. Eberle (Chief of Naval Operations), with William F. Friedman (chief cryptographer of the United States Army), assigned to translate any potential Martian messages.   So I'm tempted to give that date as the official point of contact (Venus was also fairly close at that point), though it would be amusing if our theoretical mirror Venusian civilization also went silent on that particular day.  Barring detection by Radio, we'd definitely see signs by the early 60's, when the first probes flew by."

The frequency used in many microwaves (2.45 Ghz) is perfect for dielectric heating. Basically molecules with an electrical dipole moment (like water) flip back and forth as the E field in the wave flips back and forth.

AskScienceDiscussion,3dfael,ggchappell,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose that F = dp/dt might hold true. I was thinking of F_net = m * a.   I was under the impression that at relativistic speeds, you would not get the same acceleration for the same net force applied to an object, unless you add in a Lorentz transformation somehow? But then, doesn't adding in the transformation break Newtonian Physics? Isn't that why they say Einstein proved Newton wrong?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3dfael,zenthr,8,Wed Jul 15 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"F = dp/dt is still true, but p is not mv anymore.   Are there cases where an object will accelerate without a force on it?   Well, now it comes down to exactly we want to say here. In GR, there is no gravitational ""force"", yet if we stand far away from the Earth, and watch something much closer to the Earth be released, it gets further away from us at an increasing rate. However- we wouldn't really say that the trajectory of the object has changed, just that it is entering regions where the space-time warping has changed. In other words, the object follows a ""straight line"", but the grid we measure it's position in space and time by is deformed differently at different points.  So if you are only concerned with talking about acceleration, then Newton's Law is invalidated (in GR). If you are talking about trajectories, then the law is clarified, since Newtonian physics can't distinguish the trajectory from the coordinate space (Hence, Newton called gravity a ""force"" when it is not).   Or a case where a force can act without an equal and opposite force?   Now, again there is a slight clarification. Since F = dp/dt, with the correct definition of p being something that is conserved when frames are translated in space (NOT boosted in velocity! Just moved over instantaneously to a different origin) then there has to be some sort of balance. This balance arises because we defined p with that that translation symmetry. If one object's p changes, then p must change elsewhere in the universe by an equal/opposite amount. This can get complex as electro-magnetic fields can carry momentum themselves. Something like this is necessary because in Newtonian physics this stuff was simultaneously true, but now simultaneity no longer preserved. So for a moment, there are unbalanced momentum transfers between charged particles, but this momentum is bound into the E-M field at precisely the correct amount."

The thread snaps, the object falls. Under Newtonian physics I would say that the force of gravity was greater than the maximum tension in the string, and therefore the force of gravity won out. How do you explain an object breaking due to gravity in GR? Tidal forces tearing a moon apart as it got to close would fall under this as well I suppose."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dfael,diazona,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"actually, under newtonian physics you would say that the tension in the string surpassed the maximum tension in the string, and that's why it broke. nothing changes in GR. the string breaking has nothing to do with what you would consider the cause of the tension. The block naturally wants to follow a ""straight line in spacetime"", which from the POV of someone standing on the earth's surface is to accelerate downward with acceleration g. the much more tricky part to explain is the other end of it, i.e. why whatever you attach it to is held up.

Temperatures are probably going to rise, sealevels are probably going to rise, and governments are probably going to be too slow to counteract the change.   If we accept that as true, what does the world look like?   There are going to be more natural disasters, due to weather forcing (higher temperatures ~ more extreme weather). There is going to be a lot of displaced economies, particularly in agriculture, as they are no longer going to be able to use the same crops, due to the climate being unsuitable for their standard crops (Napa Valley is already experiencing this, and concurrently Oregon is producing nicer and nicer wines). Property values are going to shift, probably northwards, and areas like Seattle will be more like current-day San Francisco. Current day San Francisco will be more like LA, and current LA will probably look more like Arizona. This will change the dynamics of how these cities run, what kinds of people they attract, and ultimately what kinds of industries exist there.   There is currently not enough research to accomodate for drastic weather changes. We are researching things like how to stop or mitigate climate change, but we are probably going to slow, and when it arrives, we might not have what it takes to deal with it. We should aim to get by with less resources, because there will probably be less food (due to displaced climates for growing), and more people. This general shortage will cause a rise in food prices and perhaps political instability. This might not be as prevalent in the United States, but it will definitely be more manifest in poorer countries.   I think there will be more research efforts on how to deal with this world, rather than geoengineering ideas on how to fix it. I think resources will become scarce and the global human population will drop, just due to logistical growth. Perhaps technology will catch up and make education and the internet widespread, which can keep high happiness while reducing social interaction anyway (see Japan). In this case we will probably gentrify as a planet, and then be able to live with these lesser resources. I think there will be war over resources, which may be mitigated if we can develop cheap energy sources that are not in critical regions (like the middle east) -- like solar and wind, that would allow local communities to grow and be happy without having to have very complicated foreign policies. This would lead to more insulated countries, which might not be a bad thing, from a peace perspective.   Just rambling, but this is how I think the world is probably going to look in 100 years.   The most contentious point I made was probably about food shortages due to climate changes. I don't actually know if this is true or not, it will probably be solvable by changing what crops farms currently grow, in general adopting more 'southern' crops than a region would normally use."

Any failure will tend to be catastrophic, however, as brittle materials do not exhibit the plasticity more malleable materials undergo to avoid such failure."

AskScienceDiscussion,3ddfzl,daever,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"The only way to shed heat in space is through thermal radiation. A conventional radiator will never work in the black abyss as it relies primarily on convection (ie: gas over a solid). since thermal radiation is entirely a surface phenomenon, the type of paint that is used is actually far more important than what its stuck on so-to-speak. For this reason you should think of the entire outer most surface as a large ""radiator"" instead.   It also turns out our current space craft are coated entirely with ceramic bricks and special ceramic paints which have amazing thermal properties. The dark underside of shuttles have a high emissivity property so they shed heat fast, the white tiles have low absorptivity and high reflectivity which means they reflect thermal radiation exceedingly well - that's why they always point the top of the ship towards the sun. So to answer you question it is entirely feasible to have ceramic radiators in space - we basically already do."

Solving NP complete problems is not actually finding a 1 in a big pile of 0s. That problem can be done in linear time (simply look through all of the characters and find a 1). I'm not 100% sure what you mean by ""read the whole data itself as an image"" but that's not something that is meaningful or possible here. For an decision problem you are given one input that is a binary string and you must decide whether that binary string belongs in the language."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dcq87,UncleMeat,6,Wed Jul 15 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in fact the linked post itself mentions that finding a needle in a haystack is linear in the volume of the haystack, so it's P, not NP.  It might help clarify things further for the OP to specify that the processing you can do to solve a problem, for purposes of P vs NP, is limited to certain operations on numbers. There's no fundamental ""count the 1s"" operation - just a limited set like move left, move right, increment, decrement, test, and so on."

If you figured out a way to map an NP-complete problem into an image, and a way to instantly classify that image, then you would have successfully proved that P=NP. But since your proof requires you to already have a way to classify, you're basically saying ""If I can prove P=NP, then I can prove P=NP.""  Furthermore, data structures are chosen to make sense for a computer. If you take a sensible data structure and turn it into an image, it becomes harder for the computer to understand, not easier."
AskScienceDiscussion,3dcq87,Solomaxwell6,0,Mon Jul 20 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that finding a needle in a haystack isn't actually NP-complete.    from the post you linked   At first i thought why not separate the 1s (the needle) from the 0s (the hay) but then i realized i would have to check through each individual strand of hay   This is actually pretty fast, as far as algorithmic complexity goes.  a good example of an NP-complete problem is the traveling salesman problem. More familiar examples include Sudoku, Tetris, Battleship Solitaire, and Minesweeper.  BTW, here's the ideal solution for a non-sorted haystack when you want to find a needle:  for thing in haystack:     if thing is needle:         return needle   So your first idea is correct.  If the needle-haystack problem is, say, finding the number 13 in a list of 100 unique sorted but not consecutive numbers, then it's actually faster:  min=0 max=100 tested_index=50 tested_number=haystack[tested_index] //defining in higher scope while tested_number is not 13:     tested_number=haystack[tested_index]     if tested_number>13:         max=tested_index         tested_index=rounded_average(max,min)     else if tested_number<13:         min=tested_index         tested_index=rounded_average(max,min)   This is a binary search, and is very useful to know in reality (since people like to have things sorted), since it takes log2(n) time to go.

Not sure how much detail you want, but just peeking at the paper they are showing that the BDCP-SPI is important for the formation of p-bodies during salt stress.  P-bodies are used by cells to sequester transcripts for a number of reasons, usually associated with degradation of the RNA, although transcripts could possibly exit.  One of the most studied phenomena of p-bodies is the global changes in transcript levels given some stimuli (such as stress) which allows ribosomes to focus on translating transcripts necessary for survival and decrease energetically costly translation going on throughout the cell to allow for conservation of energy during a presumably stressful time. Don't know how much more detail you want, but essentially the paper is saying these BDCP-SPI proteins regulate the formation of p-bodies by associating with DCP-1, a known component of p-bodies.

AskScienceDiscussion,3db753,billndotnet,8,Tue Jul 14 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Not far at all.  Data transit isn't particularly valuable if there is no data to transit. The hard part of solar-system investigation is that the time-to-iterate is magnified.  So say I dispatch an experiment, any experiment, anywhere, and I get a result. That result tells me what experiment I must dispatch next.  If I am dispatching that experiment from my design bench to my execution bench that takes me the time it takes to turn around.  If I am dispatching to a lab across the hall, it takes a little longer.  If that lab is full of explosives we might want to detour through the ""Will this spark and blow up the building?"" quality control lab.  But in short terms the total turn-around time is low.  Once we start dispatching to places like under-sea conditions, or a particular volcano, or an ice shelf, or a desert controlled by an officious government things take a little longer.  But once we try to get to space things can take forever and the costs of each iteration are fabulous. What I can drive from my house to mexico for a couple hundred bucks could cost a cool quarter-million to get into the upper atmosphere. It could cost a billion or more to get into orbit.  So as the distance rises the cost rises, and the time rises, and the ""how sure are you about this, Bob"" competition for the limited opportunity to spend those billions rises.  We have no real problem Communicating in space. We can still talk to voyager. Having a network of data carriers is not even really worth the effort since it's just more pieces to track and break.  Well not worth the effort so far.  Once we solve the problem that we only get one go at mars every eleven years then we can worry about packet scheduling results through a network.  For example, if there already was a data relay circling Pluto, the data wouldn't get here any faster. And if we were bouncing it through relays around jupiter and mars it would take longer still and be slower.  Even if we'd strung a physical wire it woudl be slower and more error prone than what we are doing.  So you are looking at the problem backwards.  This isn't a data network problem. The data problems are about signal attenuation.  The current lack of a network is the result of a complete lack of a need for a network."
AskScienceDiscussion,3db753,BitOBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem exists in a couple forms. The first is transfer time, say to move gigabytes of photos. The second problem is verification of receipt and error correction.  Round trip time for radio, from Earth to Pluto is 320 light minutes, roughly. If we had functional relays, even just a couple terabytes of flash memory hanging out on either side of the asteroid belt, to do nothing but store and forward data from location to location, we would be in much better shape, overall, because we could enjoy higher error corrected throughout over shorter effective distances.  Using a standardized set of radios and antenna on different frequency sets, there's no reason NASA couldn't sprinkle relays around the solar system to do nothing but bounce data back to Earth from whatever science package is closest.  Edit: I'd like to add that Mars is currently doing exactly this. Ground units, like the rovers, don't need radios that can transmit all the way to Earth, just to orbit. The MRO's data rate to Earth clocks in around 6mbit/s, and has already shoveled over 250 Terabytes of data from Mars. I'm not saying that a network of relays around the solar system will bring necessarily bring the data to us faster, I'm saying it'll allow us to move more data, more reliably, which works out to being the same thing, over time."
AskScienceDiscussion,3db753,BitOBear,2,Wed Jul 15 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"Not the point or points still.  The kinds of forward error correction needed to get from here to there aren't going to be cut in half-or-more if the distance is cut in half.  For instance, in order to ""normally"" get 100% data correction through our own ionosphere to/from our own communications satellites we typically have to send 150% of the data. (that is for every 2k of real data we send another 1k of error correction data. The ionosphere is like that.  The further the trip and the uglier the environment then the more forward error correction you need. But cutting the trip in half, or thirds, isn't a win.  And frankly the power and maintenance tasks would suck by extra orders of magnitude with each step.  The link to these probes isn't like TCP where we expect to send back NAK frames and demand re-transmits all the time. Having a flash drive in the asteroid belt to catch and resend the data doesn't speed anything up.  Sure the satellite/ground relay from mars surface to mars orbit and back makes sense. Planets have geography we need a relay that can see around geography.  You are stuck in terrestrial thought, and you are comparing apples to polar bears."

As time goes on the teams are required to be larger and work for more hours on the innovations, so the decline is likely to continue unless a new innovation occurs which reduces the lag time for other new innovations. However it seems like most of these may already have been created, from the electron microscope to the computer, for a new leap forward we need a new assisting technology."

Probably the most physical example of this is the Kepler Conjecture.  This conjecture basically says that there is no better packing of spheres than the one you probably would decide is obvous after playing with a pile of tennis balls for a brief period of time.  In order to prove this mathematically it became so large and cumbersome that the first people to do it had their paper rejected because nobody could actually verify that the absolutely massive proof was actually correct.  Later it was done with proof assistants where we can basically say ""as long as the trusted core of this proof assistant is correct then this proof is correct"".  There are many more practical uses of proof assistants in the fields of formal methods and software verification but this example is cool since its something that is easy to see is probably true but very hard to actually prove."

However, from the mid-20th century onwards, other historians became critical of even this nonjudgmental use of the term for two main reasons.[10] First, it is questionable whether it is possible to use the term ""Dark Ages"" effectively in a neutral way; scholars may intend this, but it does not mean that ordinary readers will so understand it. Second, the explosion of new knowledge and insight into the history and culture of the Early Middle Ages, which 20th-century scholarship has achieved,[39] means that these centuries are no longer dark even in the sense of ""unknown to us"". To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians avoid it altogether.[40]  Historians who use the term usually flag it as incorrect.

AskScienceDiscussion,3da97m,BitOBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"The tidal force is ""intellectual property"". Historically the idea of artificial monopoly via patent and copyright generally form an inhibitory regime.  Older designs and ""content"" can be milked for comfortable profit while being protected from risk.  A pattern forms where ""emerging markets"" and ""subversive innovation"" is always in regimes where intellectual ""property"" rights are under-enforced, and business is incapable of learning from history as a whole, and dooms us all to repeat that history under the banner of ""but our precious is different!""  This was true in the early U.S. when we subverted European monopoly. It is true now while East Asia subverts ours.  In markets and countries there is a protectionist hot potato (as opposed to pendulum). Once someone manages to take leadership of a market they switch from striving to protecting and so they are surpassed.  So, for instance, Microsoft was fine with a particular percentage of their ""products"" being ""stolen""; and windows piracy was normal business, and so later was Office piracy; not just normal business but encouraged behavior; but once market share was locked, out came the ""Windows Genuine Advantage"" technology and the ""Business Software Alliance"" pusdo-governmental law enforcement arm of the company.  The pattern is pretty consistent all the way back to the Stationers Guild and royal writ.  So right now the U.S. policy is to try to hold on to the potato for as long as possible. We are aggressively trying to export and foist such horrors as The Digital Millennium Copyright Act onto other governments (particularly Canada and Australia) via treaty. If we can get others to hold our potato we think we can last longer.  Meanwhile since most innovation is incremental, the places that can take our designs and mod them with impunity are building up innovative momentum while we rest on our laurels.  Ask yourself why, while such opportunities abound, you likely have never built anything from discrete electronic components? Or if you have, why virtually nobody else you ever met has done so and they tend to glaze over with boredom or wonder if you try to explain your project.  Necessity is the oft-lauded mother of invention, but she is a single mother and the unnamed father is usually uninhibited access to reuse the work of others.  So once we hang all the patent lawyers we will be able to move again.  Meanwhile lots of areas of computer science, electronics, and medicine (to name the top three) lay smothered under a fire-blanket of legal liability that is killing our industries.

Time and space is the same thing and if we change one we change the other. So movement through space (changes in velocity) will affect how we (or rather, outside observers) experience time.  As you approach light speed, time for you inside the ship according to outside observers appears to dilate. Time begins passing very slowly for you, according to them. For you inside the ship, it's the opposite, but where they see you contracting, you see the universe contracting. So to them, visually, the reason why you had not aged much at all by the time you reach your destination, it was because you were virtually frozen in time. From your perspective, it was because the distance to your destination was shorter.  Light, if it had a reference frame (which it definitely does not), would experience zero time and space, propagating instantly in its own reference frame. So you're asking for us to get their faster than instantly by asking us to travel back in time.  This is ignoring all of the other major causality issues associated with FTL (and by proxy, time travel), which I really recommend reading."

Part of that is the time it takes to design, make, test, and fly a spacecraft -- but part of it is the need to radiation-harden the parts.   The problem is that the awesome CMOS technology that we use for, well, everything has a serious flaw when it comes to radiation exposure.  Here on Earth, that's not a big deal since we don't generally deal with a lot of penetrating, ionizing radiation.  But outer space has quite a lot of the stuff -- cosmic rays rain in on us from many sources including the Sun, distant quasars, and even effects in the interstellar medium.  Cosmic radiation is very ""hard"" compared to most terrestrial sources, so it produces larger clouds of charge in the material it hits.  Some cosmic rays carry as much as a joule of energy packed onto one nucleon!!!    Computers and memory are made of logic gates, which are made of transistors.  The transistors are printed directly onto the silicon (never mind how, other people have talked about that at great length).  For every field effect transistor on the microchip, there are a few (maybe 10) other ""devices"" that are side-effects of the fact that all the devices are printed onto a single substrate.  The gaps between traces become field-effect transistors, the edges of traces become diodes, etc.  All those devices are in the ""off"" state most of the time -- the diodes are reverse-biased and don't conduct, the FETs between unrelated traces are switched off, etc., so the circuit works as designed -- a device that's not conducting acts just like an insulator.    When ionizing radiation hits the chip, it deposits a little cloud of charge into the semiconductor, changing the state of the FETs and/or diodes.  That causes bit-flip errors in memory, occasional misdirections in branches or whatever in the CPU, and general low-level havoc that needs to be accounted for in the system design.  These are ""Single event upsets"" (SEUs) that involve flipping the state of a bit in memory -- either a logic level or a stored bit somewhere.  Once in a great while, a charge cloud will switch on a parasitic flip-flop.  This is a specific arrangement of two gates that forms a one-bit memory.  Such arrangements happen randomly all over most complex chips.  If one is switched on by a charge cloud, that is a ""Single Event Latchup"" (SEL) event, and most of the time they're not destructive -- but that part of the circuit will stop working properly until someone (the spacecraft watchdog circuit?) cycles the power on the chip, resetting everything.  Sometimes SELs are destructive.   If the latched parasitic flip-flop circuit happens to connect the power supply traces in the chip directly to the ground traces, all of a sudden that part of the chip will get very hot, as watts (or, in some chips) tens of watts are suddenly dissipated in a region a few microns on a side.  Those events are single-event blowouts (SEBs) or destructive single-event latchups (DSELs), and they can destroy the circuit essentially instantly -- no reset possible, the magic smoke comes out of the chip.  Space-qualified microcircuits have special sensors in them to detect latchup and reset portions of the chip when they start to draw too much power; they have special layout that's designed to minimize parasitic flip-flops (at the cost of decreasing device density); and they have other technologies including different dopant or substrate chemistry to reduce the effects of radiation (e.g. many instruments on SOHO used sapphire instead of silicon as a substrate).  All of those technologies are slow and expensive to develop, and they involve engineering trades away from high performance and toward bigger, clunkier designs with fewer gates and slower speeds.    So space-qualified chips will always be hellaciously expensive and slow compared to street-vendor chips you can order from Digikey.  As an example, you can order a ""rad750"" single-board computer from BAE systems today.  It comes with 4MB of EEPROM and up to 44MB of ECC RAM, and operates at 132 MHz (260 MIPS) -- specs that read like those of a workstation from the mid-to-late 1990s, or a crappy cellphone today.  It costs more than $100,000.  But it's latchup-immune and can operate on the surface of the Moon or in Jupiter's magnetosphere."

Now truth is, money (be it gold coins, green paper or bottle caps) is a terrific concept (invention), but in human hands it can be too easily molested into what it is today.

And major oil companies are investing in that like there is infinite amount of it. Because there is money in it.  And then, people don't want a communal waste facility because it collects communal waste and stinks. What? How stupid and uneducated do you have to be?! Well educate them. No one wants to give money for that! - That's a true story, 10 km from where I live, heard it 2-3 months ago on my own ears.  Earth doesn't give a slightest fuck about humans.

To me, it's one of those books that brings the entirety into focus, making for a clearer mental image to hang new information upon.  I also suggest, if you haven't read it, a strange but interesting fiction book called Black Swan Green by David Mitchell.  It's a book about being 13 in England in the 1980s.

AskScienceDiscussion,3d866t,Sonmi-452,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"You know, you can learn a ton and get very good at science by doing just this one thing:      Get yourself a notebook. And then everytime you come across an interesting science concept, write it out and draw it on a page of your notebook. You can take all the basic science you might have learned in middle school so far, and the science you will learn when you get into high school, and encode it all into your notebooks. Then as you get older, you will have it all there, so you can always look back on it, and expand upon it. Something about the act of writing it and also of having it in your own writing and drawing really cements it in your mind.      You can take courses on Khan Academy, or watch science videos, and take stuff from your classes, or anywhere else, and writing it down will make it yours and make it so you dont forget (or can easily remind yourself) what you have learned. It also makes you like Leonardo Da Vinci almost, having handwritten-drawn notebooks of science concepts, kind of cool if you are into that!      Something else to add, a few people have mentioned certain books (I would also recommed A Short History of Nearly Everything too, that one is great). Something else you can do is actually learn the equivalent of whole college courses of material from the for Dummies books. It sounds silly, but I'm serious! I learned the basics of Botany from Botany for Dummies, then shored up my knowledge with a book called Botany for Gardeners, and a book on soil science. Especially if you have an account with Kindle, you can very easily learn a lot of stuff just from all the books out there. It might take a little more effort tham getting it from videos, but hey, learning to make efforts to understand science is what makes someone a great scientist!  But I can't recommend enough to just look up books and stuff for whatever topic you are interested in. I'm real interested in ecology. You know what I did? Since I already have a (very basic) beginning understanding of some ecology concepts, I bought the book  The Princeton Guide to Ecology, which goes over many of the main concepts and each chapter is written by an actual leading expert in that specific area. You'd think something like that would be pretty expensive right? It was just 28 bucks. Well worth it.       You can give yourself a basic foundation in any main topic with Khan Academy. You can shore up your knowledge with books, wikipedia articles, and YouTube videos. Basically, what I'm saying here, is you can learn anything you put your mind to. At your age, if you actually went into it, and kept good notes on everything you learned, oh man, you'll have set yourself up so well.

You're just saying: ""Women now are able to decide whether to have kids or not"" and ""women are more educated"".   And... First, I fail to see why, on average, an educated woman would necessarily want to be child-free. Then, I see a lack of causal relation also between the possibility to decide how many kids to have and deciding not to have any (not at a single person level, at the population level. That's like saying that reproducing is something bad that people naturally avoid.   Also, all these answer talk exclusively about women, often talking about how women can now choose for themselves whether to have kids or not. This assumes that males do not play a part in this trend or that males otherwise have a strong desire to have kids, pressuring women into it when female education is not widespread. This second part seems pretty weird to me, given that the old stereotype was the one of a man doing everything to avoid ""being trapped"" by an impregnated woman.  edit: I get that education has the biggest correlation with fertility rates.

The likelihood of individuals making a choice is what is known as probability when that probability is then multiplied out by the general population then you have a change in overall population and birth rates.  Producing large number of children in a family is something that most educated people do avoid if possible.  Males do play a part in reproduction, however when it comes to family size the males general default position is to reproduce as much as possible. This means that unless a woman feels she can take control over her family size then it is likely to be large. The concept of a male being trapped into a relationship by an impregnated female is only really a factor in the developed world and generally only applied about being trapped into staying with that one woman rather than going on to attempt to impregnate as many women as that male could get away with doing before becoming trapped."

Suicide rates are highest in some of the happiest, wealthiest countries in the world (Sweden, Japan, Norway, etc). If people are going to kill themselves, it seems like those struggling for food and water amidst horrible exploitation and violence ought to be much more inclined to suicide than an upper-middle class teenager who thinks their parents don't understand them.   I would suggest that the less affluent a society is, the more people fall back on innate survival programming. There is no time for deep introspection about 'what it all means'; no desire to question the assumptions of society and critically reflect on where they come from or if they ought to apply to you. People seek their next meal, they seek a mate, they have kids, they move forward.  I'm not a poor person from a poor country, so I'm not sure how accurate this is. I don't mean to suggest they are thoughtless animals - just that in certain socioeconomic contexts, questioning certain aspects of life is nearly impossible.   There are a lot of people who have responded that empowering women is what causes declining birthrates - and I understand that is the prevailing narrative for all sorts of reasons.

So as a country ""grows cities"" it reaches a homeostasis of population producers and consumers.  And really nice places have to make enough cities to eat up and dissipate a net immigration."

If time is not fixed and is subject to distortions, is it possible that the same single point in time always has and always will exist somewhere in the universe?   No. ""Always has"" and ""always will"" are statements about time, so this definitely isn't true. It's like asking if the same single point in space extends infinitely to the left and right.   If it does, then would the two dimensional liniar progression of time ceases to be two dimensional as we plot the existance of this single point while plotting other points in time that exist simultaniously both before and after it?

AskScienceDiscussion,3d43yh,swqcels,7,Mon Jul 13 10:53:12 2015 UTC,To put it simply: any type of inheritance that is not strictly dominant vs. recessive. Incomplete dominance and co dominance cause the heterozygous phenotype to be a third color. Polygenic traits are also non-Mendelian because they are controlled by many different genes on many different chromosomes.
AskScienceDiscussion,3d43yh,catface1468,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns.      Incomplete and co-dominance are two, and polygenic traits are a big one.       Almost everything is really additive though, that's one kind of polygenic inheritance. That means that the trait is the result of summing the effects of many genes. Things like body size, and body size components are all additive. Really, offhand, I can't think of a major visible human trait that is not an additive trait.      Epigenetically controlled traits are another polygenic thing. That's where one molecular mechanism controls the expression of another.      Anything carried by the endosymbionts (mitochondria and chloroplasts) is extra-nuclear and non-Mendelian.     Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic mechanism that imprints the genes with a mechanism that alters their expression.      Sex-linked traits are carried on the sex chromosomes, so they have a totally non-Mendelian pattern even if they are simple dominant/recessive genes.        And then there are things that alter the phenotype of the trait. Phenotypic plasticity can be the result of a lot of different things, but it will always alter the apparent inheritance pattern.   The list could really go on. Most things aren't at all Mendelian. It turns out that eye-color, which is one of the most classically used examples of a Mendelian trait, isn't Mendelian at all (but we still teach that one, now we just give it a caveat, which I think is a bit silly)."

Tetrapods all have a conservative body plan. Vertebrates all have a conservative body plan. How are birds more conservative than other vertebrates?   Morphologically, birds can basically innovate on their beaks, their feet, and the length of their neck. Their basic body shape can only change so much, because of the skeletal adaptations they made to fly and only having two digits on their wings.   There's actually quite a lot of other innovation involves as well. General body shape is one thing, but they're also able to innovate a lot in limb length and robusticity, schizodactyly, wing shape, wing size, brain size, feather morphology, altriciality, and all sorts of other things.   On the other hand, a group like ungulates, or carnivorans, can adapt pretty much any part of their body. Ungulates include such extremes as whales, antelope, pigs, camels, and buffalo.    Artiodactyls are actually pretty conservative, with most of their diversity represented in how fused up the ankle is, in absolute size, and in how hypsodont their teeth are. Beyond that, they're quite similar, which itself has created major issues for people trying to work out their relationships. The main thing we think about when we think about artiodactyls (horns/antlers/other headgear) isn't really very important in the long run.   Whales represent a single diversification that deviated from the otherwise highly conserved artiodactyl bodyplan. And only a few real bodyplans are represented there.   Carnivorans include such extremes as bears, felids, canids, walruses, and otters. These animals differ physically in ways that birds can't, despite both ungulates and carnivorans being newer groups, and orders in Mammalia instead of being an entire class like Aves.   Define ""differ physically in ways birds can't"" because most of those individual features are represented within birds as well (e.g. flippers, skull shape differences, etc). Carnivorans are actually quite conservative, with the main axes of variation being absolute size and molar complexity.    All birds have a pygostyle, and a beak, and a similar hip structure, and legs that bend mainly at the ankle, and feet that are digitigrade, etc. Almost all of them have a flexible neck and a keel. Birds are incredibly diverse, but in behavior, intelligence, feather color, beak shape, foot digits, and other traits that don't really change their overall body shape or body plan.   All tetrapods have a femur, innominate bone, atlas, axis, cervical vertebrae, dorsal trunk vertebrae, ribs, shoulder girdle, sacrum, and caudal vertebae, skull comprised of a neurocranium and dermatocranium with a highly reduced splanchnocranium, true stapes, and a whole bunch of other random features of relevance only to specialists. Clearly this means that all tetrapods are basically just variations on a theme and thus are ""conservative"" which is weird given that they've been around 350 million years.   Ooooor you're misunderstanding what is meant by ""conservative body plan.""  Birds are actually quite morphologically diverse.  The fact that they vary in different traits from the ones that tend to vary within mammals doesn't make them less diverse; it means that they diversify differently. For example, diversification in many fish clades consists of specialization of the pharyngeal toothplates. No tetrapod has pharyngeal toothplates; does that then mean that we are all morphologically conservative? Or does it mean that the criterion set out (pharyngeal toothplate morphology) is insufficient to quantify diversification in nonteleost vertebrates? I think I'd prefer the latter conclusion."

In a sense producing hydrogen in this way is really similar to a battery, take for instance photovoltaics from solar to perform electrolysis and then burn the hydrogen to do work later in other applications and contexts.  I think we would find that the economics of doing that are the reasons why we don't do that at present.  Of course as the supplies of fossil fuels diminish that break even point may become attractive.  I don't have any recent information about algae but I'd assume that it is the R&D cost to develop an algae that produces a useful fuel output that is the reason we don't grow our energy.

Also merely creating something from a plan isn't sufficient for scientists: they need to be able to understand the process behind it.  An example of this is the discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. Otto Hahn had the evidence that nuclear fission was occuring, but simply didn't understand the process behind it. He had to write to Meitner who then managed to explain the process (and was tragically overlooked by the Nobel committee in favour of Hahn)  There are also relatively few breakthroughs that aren't dependent on progress in related fields. Erasmus Darwin, Charles' grandfather, had a basic theory of evolution. The problem was that until Hutton (a geologist) introduced the concept of 'Deep Time' any theory of evolution couldn't explain the diversity of life. There are countless other examples: Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect couldn't happen without Planck, Crick, Watson and Franklin's work on DNA relied on XRD which in turn relied heavily on Bragg's work, which couldn't have taken place without Roentgen's discovery of x-rays in the first place.

AskScienceDiscussion,3d15en,HonestJoshTheFox,3,Sun Jul 12 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"(been lurking around for a bit, found this question interesting so decided to finally make an account)  The ratio between seconds:minutes:hours is rather arbitrary, some theories suggest it started due to the Babylonian numbering system, counting in base 60, rather than decimal, as we do now. The only non-arbitrary unit is the second, which is a scientific unit (however even that was initially defined arbitrarily (one hour divided by 60 twice)  which has been redefined according to the frequency of a certain atom (caesium.) Since the second has a universal(human)  recognised definition, the second will most likely stay, and since 24 hours (on earth) is arbitrary, I see no reason why different units would be used on Mars (especially since a Mars day is only around 40 minutes longer) unless the whole system is changed on earth to something less arbitrary"

I just think the one thing that would change, would obviously be the number of hours in a day, so days would still be measured by using the unit of hours, (I imagine). ... Also, this video here explains why 60 or integer multipliers of 60 are convenient numbers to use for time or even angular measurements. So, if the conventions were to change, I still imagine that we would make the new time conventions based within units of 60 and 360...."

AskScienceDiscussion,3d0x68,Kaynos72,2,Sun Jul 12 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"It's all homeostasis, though through different mechanisms.  Some things, like Dopamine, are created naturally in the body, however you can take additional dopamine (Opiates) and get a 'feel good' effect from it. Over time, your body will start to create less and less, creating a chemical dependency (if you stop consuming it your body will not create enough to compensate, resulting in a possibly deadly deficiency), along with the receptors getting used to having so much that they no longer respond as intensely to it. Your body is responding to the surplus by making itself less sensitive, and producing less of it's own. These are the main routes that tolerance has.  Something like bleach, however, does not build tolerance. That is largely because the body has no way of compensating for it, short of filtering it out in the kidneys.  There is also learned tolerance, such as learning how to coordinate yourself when drunk, but that's more of psychological than physiological/chemical.  Anybody who knows more feel free to chime in."

There was recently a hypothesis put forward on this one, which is really cool! But I really don't buy the hypothesis at all. So that's less cool.       The other one we have trouble with is the Bdelloid rotifers. There has never been a male observed of this group and it represents a putatively ancient asexual lineage. Muller's Ratchet would predict that an asexual lineage has an expiration date of around 100K generations.       Bdelloids have been around for ~900 million generations.

AskScienceDiscussion,3d04tc,AnecdotallyExtant,7,Sun Jul 12 13:48:42 2015 UTC,That's an excellent question!    The Hymenoptera (bees and ants) have a unique system of inheritance that makes it so the worker females are more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.        So they help mommy make sisters.          That doesn't fly in the termites. They have a pretty normal inheritance system.

AskScienceDiscussion,3d04tc,AnecdotallyExtant,2,Sun Jul 12 14:20:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the proposed mechanism itself would work. I can explain it, but like I said it's totally unsatisfying because it doesn't explain why none would ever cheat. The one individual who cheats would steal a massive advantage from the colony; so this explanation fails to really answer the interesting questions.        The idea is that the termite soldiers and workers are bound to their older siblings through a system called alloparenting. When the termites are getting ready to molt their gut biota disappears. They need the gut biota to digest the wood, so they're dead without it.      After the molt, the alloparent begins proctodeal trophallaxis (literally: anus to mouth feeding) whereby the gut biota from the alloparent is given back to the newly molted soldier.      This mechanism works fine to make them dependent on the colony, but it can't explain why one wouldn't become fertile and start its own effort at reproduction."
AskScienceDiscussion,3d04tc,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the colony dependence be a good explanation as to why random cheating doesn't happen? The way I'm taking your explanation of the mechanism is that in order for a single termite to survive, it needs another termite following a different molting cyclical.  Following that mechanism, both termites would die if they both went through molting at the same time.    That would be a problem if one or two suddenly left the colony but I imagine that the queen termite has a soldier caste or something similar that would kill off competition.  So assuming that's true, the only way for a new queen to suddenly become fertile and to survive is for it to somehow take a large portion of the original colony away.  Both to help survive during molting, to help its workers survive during molting, and to keep enough termites around to protect it.    So instead of explaining why it doesn't happen, this idea would explain that random fertilization does happen but the new queen doesn't have the support to survive on its own.  I'd wager a few new queens being made is statistically probable in a given time frame, but having an entire fraction of the original colony changing allegiances is far less likely."

AskScienceDiscussion,3d04tc,BitOBear,0,Sun Jul 12 16:51:38 2015 UTC,"I thought ""kin selection"" pretty much wrapped up the whole colony organism (termites) problem some years ago.  And termites chosen food system pretty much requires very large colonies so cheater lines would likely fail.  Plus the predation system in the environment at large really, really ties success to very large colonies.

It was a kind of earth sciences version of the space race. The US decided to dig from the sea floor since it was figured that the crust is thinner out there. We got ~600 feet deep before the project was cancelled. This project was called Project Mohole (the anomaly in Kerbal Space Program is a shout out to the Mohole project).    The Russians went straight down from solid ground on the Kola peninsula: the Kola Superdeep borehole.. They were more persistent than the USA. Their borehole is still the deepest artificial point on earth getting down to 12,262 meters (40,230 feet)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cww85,AGreatWind,27,Sat Jul 11 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"One reason the USSR's Moho drilling project was more successful than the USA's comes down to location, location, and location.    The USA tried to drill down through (relatively) thin oceanic crust about 150 miles the coast of Mexico's Baja peninsula.  The drilling had to be done from a ship and the drill bit had to be lowered through approximately 11,700ft/3600m of water before it even touched the sea floor.  The deepest they got below the sea floor was about 600ft/180m.  With the rising costs and little to show for it, the project was aborted.  A few years later the USSR decided to try it on the Kola peninsula, just East of the border with Finland.  They made it to a depth of 40,230 ft/12,262m, in large part because they were doing their drilling on land rather than offshore and therefore had fewer problems to deal with.  They kept at it for years but what ultimately stopped them was the nature of the rock at that depth.  As you go down into the crust, pressures and temperatures rise drastically.  We normally think of rocks as being very strong, rigid, and brittle, but under high pressures and temperatures rocks deform and 'flow' quite readily (but they're way more viscous than, say, the lava you would see in a volcano).    When drilling into the Earth you are constantly pulling the drill bit up and replace it since they get worn away.  Eventually the Soviets reached a point where, every time the pulled the drill bit up, they would lose any progress they made as the hole sealed itself in the absence of the drill.  I mention this because it hasn't changed.  Even if our drilling technology has improved since the '60's the nature of the rock at those depths hasn't.  We would need a drill bit (and casing, probes, etc.) made of friggin' andamantium if we want to probe much deeper than the Soviets did.  Not to mention billions of dollars in funding.  Because a lot of the technology to do so doesn't exist yet it's impossible to say how deep we could go but, IMHO, we would be lucky to go significantly deeper than the Kola hole.  It's possible to break their record depth but probably not by a large margin.  tl;dr - The deepest borehole yet reached only 1/3rd of the way to the Mohorovičić discontinuity.  We probably could go a bit deeper but it probably wouldn't be worth the time and money it would take.  Edit: expanding on the reason the Americans chose to drill from a ship the ocean (though it seems foolish in retrospect) it's pretty simple.  Oceanic crust is about 10km thick max.  Continental crust can be up to 70km thick, though the crust under the Kola peninsula is around 40km thick."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cww85,rouge_oiseau,3,Sat Jul 11 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, it should be pressurized by its own weight, if it's the same density as the surrounding rock.  Of course, I don't know whether it really works that way in practice.  As you circulate fluid faster through a longer tube, the energy you spend overcoming the viscosity increases.  That energy heats up the fluid.  In the limiting case, if the fluid is as hot as the surrounding rock by the time it gets down there, it can't remove any heat.  That can be offset by using a bigger cross-sectional area.  Which means more expense.  I would think that given an unlimited budget and an unlimited amount of time to work, you could drill as deep as you want.  But the cost would rise very fast with depth.

This is due to the fact that reading or watching things you don't understand quickly becomes boring, and as a result, rarely is taken very far.  I am personally an electronics and computer sciences engineering dropout (at the moment, planning to continue my studies at a later point due to personal matters), and I have always had a flair for chemistry, physics, and technology alike. One example is that I at an age of 4 asked my mother: ""Mom, how do you make a display for a microwave oven?""... which I of course got no answer to. I would say that one of my defining traits is that I am incredibly curious with regards to the question ""how?"". ""When?"", ""where?"", and ""who"" never meant much to me. ""Why?"" is somewhere in the middle of the ranking for me, depending on the subject.  Now that I have 3 years of an engineering degree I have most of the tools I need to understand the maths behind how things work, and when I understand something at a fundamental level, I find it easier to remember. My interest in other fields than the one I am studying has also pushed me to improve on my maths (quantum mechanics was a good motivator for me there, although I wouldn't say that I understand it yet) or other fields that provide me with a better understanding of the backgrounds of other things."
AskScienceDiscussion,3d0h8u,zuce,2,Sun Jul 12 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"No. We know that the classical idea of atoms as localised objects orbiting each other, is wrong. There are many texts all over the internet explaining the quantum mechanical model of atoms, but the tl;dr version of it is that quantum particles simply are in a delocalised state smeared all over the place.  Cosmological objects don't behave like that and while they do form certain structures, those are formed by completely different effects."
AskScienceDiscussion,3d0h8u,swordfingers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"No. This is a classical idea of the family ""as above so below"", which held that if you zoomed in or out to a particular frame you'd find repetition.  But Horton hearing Whos isn't particularly possible.  In really accessible terms, there are no coordinating forces at our macro level that match the coordinating forces at the atomic level.  So even if we imagined electrons in discrete orbits around a nucleus (which isn't actually true) the electron is locked both in and out by discrete force. The energy of the electron and its charge confine it to a particular level. And photons can come along and raise the energy and the electron will jump to a higher ring. And the electron can then jump back down and release a photon.  So there are all these discrete events that cause an electron to stop being in one condition and start being another.  At our scale there are no such discrete conditions. Earth's orbit, for example, is continuously variable and wobbly and if we got smashed by an asteroid we wouldn't' suddenly jump up to Mars' orbit, then emit an asteroid and jump back to our own.  So we simply don't generate and respond to discrete energies in a way that would let us be part of a larger deterministic construct.   If there is/were such a larger construct then nothing about that structure would tie us to it in anything even vaguely like the means that we are tied to electrons, photons, or other sub-atomic structures.  So clearly we are part of system like galaxies and star clusters. But the necessary coherence of interactions doesn't appear to have any means that would let our globular cluster exert a force like ""charge"" or whatever on an larger system.  So it is a romantic notion (e.g. an idea grounded in the philosophies of the roman era) but it doesn't work with any modern sense of structure, force, or scale."

It is unlikely for life to arise on an extragalactic star simply because most stars are not extragalactic (and intelligent life appears to arise so rarely). (Though I suppose you could assume the rare case, if you wanted; I just personally wouldn't because I like more plausible stories better.)  There are basically two options: 1) your life saw the star and chose to migrate there, or 2) your life chose to move their star.  The second option can be plausibly achieved by using a Shkadov thruster. (Be mindful of timescales, here, though. Such a process is slow.)  However, in either case this scenario places major constraints on your story. The civilization in question must be a Kardashev Type II civilization at the time that it moves the star or moved to the star.  There's actually a wealth of well-developed science (and plausible scifi) in this area.   You may want to do more reading before you begin if these ideas sound completely foreign to you.  EDIT: Just saw your questions in the body of the post.  As far I as I can tell, there should be no special challenges to such a civilization, except that it's isolated on that one star system (but this may or may not actually be a problem).

AskScienceDiscussion,3cy8rb,spacefarer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"So let me give you a few more details on Terne, the conworld, and what I want from it.  Terne is a moon of a Neptune-like planet. It's Neptune-like in the sense of it size (though it is a bit larger) and its gravitational sphere of influence: Terne is a captured moon of a planet that orbits with the habitable zone for water-based life. The regular moons, like those of Neptune, are basically nonexistent as the moon orbits too close. The moon is tidally locked so that one side faces the planet. Ideally the moon would have its own moon but that is not necessary.  What I want is for the culture on the moon to be able to see an entire galaxy face-on, and taking up a significant part of the sky. I was thinking I might need to put the planet in a dwarf galaxy for that result to be feasible.  By the way, the primary goal of this project is linguistic diachrony (most of us doing the project construct languages). But the visible skies are a significant part of culture, which has a great effect on language. We're starting about 10000 years from ""modern"" technology so they won't be able to move stars around."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cy8rb,TangentialThreat,3,Sun Jul 12 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"There are lots of intergalactic stars. Like, tons and tons of them. They are cut loose during galactic collisions or pass close to a large black hole and get slingshotted out naturally.  No one has any idea if they have planets. Except for this one, which is now part of our galaxy and close enough to study. Really there's no way to tell if that's normal or not; you'd think they'd be stripped off during the ejection process but maybe not.  You don't absolutely need to make it extragalactic either. Andromeda galaxy is six times bigger than the moon in our sky but unaided human eyes aren't good enough to ever notice that we have a fairly large galaxy hanging in the sky. It is also moving closer to us and will become brighter and bigger until our sky looks like this in 3.75 billion years.  So you can have a planet orbiting an extragalactic star, but you could also have a planet in a galaxy that is undergoing a collision like we eventually will with Andromeda."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cy8rb,spacefarer,2,Sun Jul 12 06:59:51 2015 UTC,"Huh.  Well the star could simply be in the halo of the galaxy.  But idk if that gets you far enough away to give the image you want. From the halo, the galaxy would probably take up about 2/3 of the sky (when your night sky is facing the galaxy, that is).   I'm not sure about the plausibility of a star in the halo forming life, because they're generally older, smaller, and metal poor.  But I suppose its not impossible for a younger star to have found its way into the halo (or even been ejected from the galaxy).   Actually that may be another option. If your star had been ejected from the galaxy recently (a few tens of thousands of years), then it could be at whatever proximity to the galaxy you want.  The only thing I'm not sure about is whether or not the ejection event (e.g. slingshotting around a very large star, or even the center of the galaxy) would affect the orbits of the planets.  But the ejection event would be far enough back in history to not mess with the linguistics.  EDIT: Also, to clarify, you mean 10,000 years before modern tech, right?  EDIT2: I like /u/TangentialThreat's hint at twin galaxies.  Your planet could be in one galaxy and be looking at another.

It'll also allow for a variety of constellations so they won't be bored at night. I just realized how boring a totally black sky would be to them.   They are 10000 years before modern technology."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cx7s7,jjake101,2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yes it could, but you would need actually a long journey and the use of ion engines to slow the approach. The question would be what value would there be in such a mission. Certainly we are talking decades depending upon exactly how the approach was worked in with the other planets. As for cost pick a number and double it, it is really difficult to tell but certainly more expensive than a standard probe type mission."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cx7s7,MJMurcott,2,Sat Jul 11 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"There are an enormous number of variables here. The answer is, of course, ""yes, it can be done, for an infinite amount of money, over an infinite period of time"". But that's not very helpful.  New Horizons took about 9 years to get out there, lofting a ~500kg probe on one of the largest launchers currently available. You'd have to add a lot of fuel and an engine to that probe in order to slow it down when it got to Pluto. How much? (enter handwaving mode)  The Cassini probe that went into orbit around Saturn weighed 5,000 kg at launch, of which 3,000 kg was fuel. But Cassini was so heavy, it required multiple gravity-assist maneuvers of Earth and Venus just to get enough velocity to reach Saturn.  New Horizons is much smaller, but also traveling much farther out, to a planet with much lower gravity. If the probe weighs about 1/4 as much as Cassini/Huygens, you might need as much as 3/4 as much fuel to stop at the end. So you'd end up with something about half as heavy as Cassini, you'd probably have to do a complicated multi-assist maneuver, and it'd take longer to get to Pluto - probably as least 3 years longer, maybe much more than that.  As for cost - Cassini cost 5 times as much as New Horizons. A lot of the costs aren't directly-comparable (we don't buy spacecraft by the pound, after all), but clearly an orbital mission would have been substantially more-expensive.  The Wikipedia article on New Horizons has a bit of history on the various Pluto projects that were proposed at NASA over the years, which eventually led to New Horizons."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cx7s7,i_invented_the_ipod,2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"As the other responses said, it should be doable for an amount on the same order of magnitude as other big NASA projects, but more.    Using an ion drive should reduce the cost considerably.  Orbiting instead of flyby increases it a lot.  Having it take much longer can save quite a bit.  Rockets need exponentially more fuel, the more you have to change the payload's velocity with them: to do some acceleration, you need a rocket of a certain size; to do some more acceleration, you double the size of the rocket; to do some more acceleration, you quadruple it instead; add one more increment of acceleration, and you're up to a factor of sixteen.  And so on.  Increasing the effective exhaust velocity of the rocket changes how much acceleration you get for each doubling.  Or to put it another way, it changes how many doublings you need.  Hence the interest in ion drives.  But slowing down counts just as much as speeding up.  Doing a flyby instead of orbiting can cut the number of doublings in half."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cx7s7,dsws2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Because Pluto is currently on its way to aphelion, more and more fuel and longer and longer the longer you wait, unless you wait hundreds of years for it to come closer to the sun again. That's why New Horizons had to be launched when it was (though even earlier would have been better) and why it's only doing a flyby—it had to get there in a hurry, so no time for a Hohmann transfer orbit or similar, which would enable it to enter Pluto orbit.  I suppose you could use ion engines and take decades to get there. But then your spacecraft has to be designed to live that long, which is really difficult. Most NASA probes have short primary missions, just long enough to accomplish their main objectives, and then get extensions because they're still operational. Spirit and Opportunity, for example, were only designed to last 90 days on Mars. The Voyager probes are now in their 30s and only have some instruments still operating. And by the time your probe gets there, technology will have advanced so far that we'll probably be able to learn about as much with some yet-to-be-developed telescope.  But don't let that stop you from trying if you want to. We'd all still learn a lot even if it doesn't get past development."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cwtq0,SimonSaysYouAreADick,3,Sat Jul 11 13:41:52 2015 UTC,"It varies a lot. All you can say in general is that a scientist's work popularizing science does not count toward their academic reputation. But there are some popular scientists who have very productive research careers and are well regarded for that work, and others who are not well regarded in the scientific community because they've switched over to interfacing with the public. To take a few of your examples, Hawking, Dyson, and Greene are still fairly well regarded researchers and might be in the 6-8 range on your scale, whereas Bill Nye would be around 2. (Not to say the work Bill Nye does isn't important. I think it's very important. It's just not regarded by other scientists as a significant contribution to research.)  Sometimes popular scientists transition from high to low on the scale, if they have a fruitful research career and then shift into popularization work. Neil Degrasse Tyson is an example, I think; from what I hear, he did some very good work in astrophysics some years ago, but these days he no longer has time for that. Michio Kaku is also one who shifted down the scale, but as I understand it, that's because he's been promoting some fairly ridiculous ideas lately, not because of time constraints.  Oh, and out of your list, I'd say Hawking and perhaps Dyson are likely to be widely remembered by scientists for their scientific research many years from now. Hawking for his prediction of black hole thermal radiation, of course, which is drawing a huge amount of interest right now with the black hole firewall debate, and Dyson for his work on the fundamentals of quantum field theory.

So read that. :-)   When you say black hole thermal radiation, are you referring to Hawking Radiation?   Yep, that's it. Everyone knows it as Hawking radiation because that's the discovery he's famous for, but since we were already talking about Hawking (hey that rhymes), I figured I'd give a more content-focused description. The Wikipedia article is a good read if you want to know more.   Doesn't the word thermal mean in the Infrared spectrum?   Not in this context. I'm using the word ""thermal"" to mean that the radiation's frequency distribution is that of a black body.  All objects emit thermal radiation (i.e. with a black body spectrum). The frequency at which the emission is strongest depends on the temperature. It turns out that, at the temperatures which are typically found on Earth, the peak emission frequency happens to be in the part of the EM spectrum that we've labeled ""infrared"". That's why people sometimes use the word ""thermal"" to refer to infrared radiation in other contexts.   What is the ""black hole firewall debate""? I've never heard of this.   It comes from the idea that quantum mechanics supposedly preserves information, for a particular technical definition of ""information"". When matter or anything else falls into a black hole, it carries in a lot of information about its structure, but the Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole carries very little information out. So information should be accumulating inside the black hole. The problem is, our theoretical understanding of black holes doesn't allow that to happen. Eventually the black hole is supposed to evaporate in a burst of Hawking radiation, and after that happens, where has the information gone?  The proper solution to this paradox is being heavily debated right now by people who think about such things. There are a few proposed solutions that I'm aware of, none of which is completely satisfying:   Information actually can be lost, which means quantum mechanics is incomplete in a pretty drastic way Hawking radiation actually does carry information, perhaps ""disguised"" in a way that makes it impossible to recover without knowing something about the objects that fell in Black holes don't actually evaporate, or at least not in the way we think they do, and whatever is left behind stores the lost information There is a ""firewall"" surrounding the event horizon that would effectively destroy anything falling in to the black hole, keeping the information out but allowing the particles in   So despite the name, the firewall is really just one possible solution to a complicated question. It's more properly known as the black hole information paradox."

Lol. It's been a while. Haha.   And, again, I'm no physicist, but wouldn't the ""deletion"" (you'll have to forgive the computing analogy ;) ) of information be a direct violation of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics? Or, wait, is the 1st Law that information cannot be created nor destroyed, that matter cannot be created nor destroyed, or is it both?   Also, I'm sure many people have already thought of this, but couldn't it be that the information accumulates inside, but then it over time reaches its internal capacity, and then ""evaporate[s] in a burst of Hawking radiation"", with the stored information being re-released back into the ""outside world""?

AskScienceDiscussion,3cwtq0,NutellaTornado,2,Sun Jul 12 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"The first law of thermodynamics is conservation of energy. You were probably thinking of the second law, which says that entropy (probabilistically) doesn't decrease.  Entropy is often considered somewhat inversely related to information, but that's not quite the meaning I was using in my last comment. The idea that quantum mechanics preserves information is technically known as unitarity, or unitary evolution, and it's better described as the statement that the number of independent quantum states a system can have is fixed. Unitary evolution doesn't combine multiple quantum states into one, or split one state into two, as time goes on, which is why the number of possible states doesn't change with time. An object, as we know it, has a relatively small number of possible quantum states that still qualify it as being that object; therefore it carries a lot of information. But Hawking radiation can be produced in many quantum states and still be Hawking radiation, thus it carries very little information. The same sort of argument applies to entropy, roughly, but for entropy you only consider how many quantum states a system could have without changing its thermodynamic properties (temperature, pressure, that sort of thing) - it doesn't have to actually be the same object. (I'm not doing a very good job of describing this, I think; in my defense, it's complicated.)  Anyway, the point is, the process of ""converting"" an object into Hawking radiation is technically consistent with the second law, because it goes from a low-entropy configuration to a high-entropy configuration. But it's not consistent with unitary evolution.  On your other point, the problem is that Hawking radiation doesn't release the stored information - or so people always thought. One of the proposed resolutions to the paradox is to say that that's wrong, and Hawking radiation actually does release stored information. But there are theoretical difficulties with that too. I couldn't begin to properly explain them though."

No, for a couple of reasons: first, matter is not a property that can be conserved, matter is a type of thing that has properties. You can talk about conservation of mass, but not matter. And also, there are other types of energy besides mass. So mass is not conserved. The first law of thermodynamics only deals with energy. It has nothing to do with information either."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,tyrannosauru,6,Sat Jul 11 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"Without looking into it, logically speaking it would have to cost less for a couple of reasons.      First is that dairy cows aren't usually used for meat for humans. So if we raised cows for only dairy, there would be millions of beef cattle that wouldn't be raised at all. So that would be clearly less of a cost.     If we hypothetically assumed that dairy cows were used for our beef cattle, we would still lower environmental costs because there would be no incentive to slaughter them earlier than would be done to maximize dairy production. In other words, if we used dairy cattle for beef, there would be cause to slaughter them at some point for beef, that would be sooner than they would be slaughtered for decreased milk production. Beef cattle are slaughtered young because they taste better young. Dairy cows produce for many years and don't need to be replaced yearly like the beef cattle. So there would still be fewer cows being raised.      I'm not sure how industrial chicken operations work, but the same logic would have to apply to that industry as well. So there would have to be a lower ecological cost if we weren't raising them for any meat products."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,danskal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"Correct  Bacteria living naturally within the gut provide a gateway to flab, according to a few reports this week. These bacteria may explain how antibiotics fatten farm animals and perhaps people too, and how certain genes predispose organisms to obesity.  But agricultural uses deserve special attention, since they account for 70 percent of the antibiotics and related drugs used in the United States, and since they provide resistant bacteria with a direct route into people's kitchens. From Feedlot to Kitchen  Resistant bacteria that develop in CAFOs (confined animal feeding operations) can be transferred to the general human population via food. The government, public health officials, and physicians are increasingly concerned about foodborne diseases caused by Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nationwide there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness a year and 5000 deaths from viral and bacterial pathogens.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is implementing a voluntary plan with industry to phase out the use of certain antibiotics for enhanced food production.  Antibiotics are added to the animal feed or drinking water of cattle, hogs, poultry and other food-producing animals to help them gain weight faster or use less food to gain weight.  Because all uses of antimicrobial drugs, in both humans and animals, contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, it is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary. Governments around the world consider antimicrobial-resistant bacteria a major threat to public health. Illnesses caused by drug-resistant strains of bacteria are more likely to be potentially fatal when the medicines used to treat them are rendered less effective."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,danskal,2,Sat Jul 11 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"There is no other mechanism, you are correct.  Animals don't digest the bacteria in their gut. IF they did, then because the bacteria can only eat what the animal ate first, killing off bacteral populations would make more food available to the animal.  But most gut bacteria are actually beneficial as the convert bulk food into things like vitamins. Gut bacteria, particluarly in ruminants, are necessary. If you were to kill off the bacteria in the gut the animal would lose weight on the same feed since more of the feed would pass through the system untouched.  The parent poster is just off topic.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria is a huge problem, but it's a separate question to food chain efficiency."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,BitOBear,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"There's also some causation in the other direction, albeit indirectly. Cows raised in industrial farms are typically fed corn, because we grow so much in the US and it's more calorie dense than grass. However, ruminant digestive systems are pretty much made for digesting grass and hay, and a corn/grain-based diet frequently causes digestive issues that lead to bacterial growth and disease, especially E. coli. So cows are pumped with antibiotics, which further messes with their gut biomes.   This is not the case with chickens or pigs - in fact I've heard entertaining stories of people insisting on ""grass-fed chickens"" - chickens don't eat grass and are perfectly happy with grain-based diets supplemented with protein."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,no-mad,0,Sat Jul 11 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"But if you need enough more cattle to produce the same calorie count per year as you got from slaughtering a generation of cows that year, you need far more cows than the count you slaughtered.  And when they die, as they must, you have many more cow carcases to deal with.  So the total living cow count rises, even if the total cows born/died per twenty-years likely falls, per million-calories of food value per year.  So if milk-and-egg production stayed fixed, then things are as you say, but if milk-an-egg production is expected to replace the calorie count for the meat then the total water used, and the total waste products produced, and the total grain feed and or grassland consumed per year rises sharply.  And the dead-loss mass to burn, bury, or mulch becomes 100%.  So really, eating the meat for the calories is rather efficent at the environmental level.  (And, yes, I know we'd probably not try to replace the total calorie value for chicken meat with eggs, or the total calorie value for beef with milk, but if one is going to discuss theoretical trades like this the equations must be balanced.)"
AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,BitOBear,2,Sun Jul 12 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"There is more ""death per calorie"" for eggs than any animal food other than chicken.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,Life-in-Death,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"You are correct. As stated the problem doesn't indicate that any calories are being transferred away from the animal industry. (e.g. the OP didn't say ""if we stopped eating meat and replaced it with Kale"" or something).  So to balance the equation in the question as asked one has to presume that the eggs and milk are going to replace the calories of the missing meat in the food supply chain.  So providing enough eggs to replace all of the chicken meat consumed you need many more living chickens. So that raises the water consumption etc.  And in the end 100% of the chickens must die because that's how life works. So all those chickens will have to be burned, mulched, or buried. The environmental impact of all those carcasses must be accounted for.  Plus all the extra feed for keeping those chickens alive for their eggs is going to increase the farming burden.  So yep, your analysis is exactly correct for the question as asked."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,Life-in-Death,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"A cow produces no milk without giving birth to a veal. Then you can't turn every single veal into cow giving milk because there are too much of them. It would be wasteful to not eat them so we have veals to eat. Then we need to dispose of all older cows and reproductive males. It would be wasteful to not recycle those somehow.  You want hens to lay eggs. Those hens don't leave forever. So you need to use a few of those for reproduction. Half of the chicken will be male, far too many for reproduction's needs. You can kill them right away, this is what is often done nowaday, or you can use them for meat, which is, imho, less of a waste of a lifeform.  In all, an effective production of milk or eggs also produces some amount of meat, leather, feather, and other animals byproduct."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cuyw2,BizouBisou,0,Sat Jul 11 09:20:27 2015 UTC,"I would think that if you are trying to produce the same calories-per-year then not eating the animals would require a much larger herd to produce the same calories-per-year, so not eating the meat would be a substantially larger environmental burden.  That is, if you eliminate the meat and don't increase the milk and egg production the obviously the burden drops down because the chickens-for-slaughter and the cows-for-slaughter and the farms thereof just disappear.  But if you leave those same industries the task of replacing the output of the farms that left the system then the number of animals rises sharply. Producing a roast-chicken's worth of eggs, or a butcher'd cow's worth of milk is a non-trivial task.  And in the end, the failure to eat the dead animals leaves you with much more dead animal waste to burn, mulch, or bury.   So if you need twice as many chickens and none of them are going to be eaten, then what do you do with the chickens when they eventually die?  And larger populations are likely then using more problematic resources like water and antibiotics, and produce larger volumes of waste while living above the waste-at-death.  So really, eating the meat is more environmentally sound than eating just the intermediate product(s), calorie for calorie."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cwpd8,merrrbear,2,Sat Jul 11 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"All food contains a certain amount of energy. This obviously varies greatly between foods. Most foods in western countries these days have this energy clearly written on the label. It's expressed in either kilo-joules or kilo-calories.  Your body expends a certain amount of energy, even if you don't do any exercise. This also varies depending on your height, weight and age. There are many online tools to help you determine your Basal Metabolic Rate.  So in the end, if you eat less energy than your body expends, you will lose weight. Strictly for losing weight, it matters little what foods you eat so long as the net energy from the foods is less than your expended energy.  Now, eating healthy means you're consuming the right amounts of carbs, protein, fiber, salt, sugar and vitamins and minerals etc. that your body requires.   However, even eating healthy you will gain weight if the amount of energy you consume is greater than your expenditure, and again you will lose weight if the amount of energy you consume is less than your daily expenditure.  This is some very basic physics here, and they hold true for 99.999% of all humans. EXTREMELY FEW people have problems that can seriously effect their weight, but even then, you simply cannot gain mass without eating more than your body requires.

IF the boundary is discrete it necessarily must be perfectly reflective as it couldn't capture any photons.

I'm not sure what the second ans subsequent photons would do when they exactly encountered the first one(s) frozen in the even horizon. My guess would be that the incoming photons would combine with the frozen photons and raise their ""E"" energy, so since the Planck constant is constant, the photon's frequency would rise.  So you would either see a shiny smooth (and frictionless) surface or a completely opaque darkness.  In the later case turning the time-stop field off would be extremely dangerous.  Giving the moving universe such an object would probably appear to shoot off in a particular direction at a very high speed. If it's time was truly zero it would define and adhere to a hither-to undefined ""rest frame"". Just hope you are standing on the correct side when it starts moving, and if its on earth, the angles aren't such that straight-up isn't the earths movement compared to rest, as the object puncture the earth as the earth moved through the rest frame.

In this scenario, I also make reference to the concept that stickmanDave put in, which was based on his posting:  They would see nothing, as any photons striking it would also be frozen in time and thus could not reflect back and be seen.  Since it is not stopped, and significantly slowed down, taking both of your views into consideration, would we see a form of the object being near invisible, since the light at the point of the object is near zero, or perhaps a slightly distored reflection of the light just prior to the object...I would say this, the observer may see a transparency in a reflective surface, but a distorted shadow of the object in the ground zero position perhaps?  The object would be an energy sink, storing all the electromagnetic energy that approached it. If/when time starts again, all that energy would be released at once.

As for this portion, and related to what you(BitOBear) wrote on the energy as well as the planar positioning--time-related events also of course are space-time coordinates, because the universe is ALWAYS moving.  So, two elements here:   For the description of the energy build-up - Yes, I agree, this is a concern - I see two elements here:   First, as mentioned, due to the universal movements, this is a form of great kinetic energy build-up--to take care of this, and as part of the sci-fi piece, the object the individual is holding helps in that it keeps the universal vectors going, so the object ""appears"" to be stable to observers in the universe--yes, a little far-fetched, but again, it is the ""fictional"" component. For the temporal energy component, as stickmanDave makes reference to, yes, in my fictional story, this actually had a place in my reference, and at one point the energy ""normalizes"" causing some destruction and devastating affects for those in the immediate vicinity.  Those nearby that are organic in nature, would be immediately aged, or perhaps an explosive effect that would be fatal of course.

Our Moon is theorized to have been created in an impact event with an object at about the scale of Mars.  And the time scales correlate a bit more closely.  And the higher mass allows us to consider the gravity of the object as the effector, beyond the mechanical effects of its physicality moving through space.  So, for argument - a Mars sized rogue planet such as the one that formed our Moon, traveling at a decent clip.  How close to Mars itself, would this rogue planet need to come before the gravity well of the rogue started pulling away some of the atmosphere (assuming an Earth-like atmosphere at Martian scale)?  Would it actually have to penetrate the atmosphere, or could it disrupt the magnetic properties of the atmosphere and trigger a runaway atmospheric loss?  Or simply siphon off enough gases to deplete the necessary atmospheric structure?  Also, how do scientists consider Mars lost its magnetosphere?

One big caveat on that number is that you'd be using much less electricity to process oil if everybody had an electric car, so it's actually possible there'd be a net drop in the total amount of energy used."

The average U.S. car is getting ~24mpg (easily googled).     Using your numbers for cars and miles, that's 145.8 billion gallons of gasoline.  (Spot check: separate estimate online gives 136.78 billion - we're ok).    Plugging this all in, you save 875 billion kWh by cutting out gasoline refining (again, just the refining process).

I have the feeling that introducing a massive distributed energy storage system, if well implemented, might slip into the grid without needing much of a bump in production.   Some incentives and smart charging would need to be put in place. For example, parts of the country with high solar output or potential output would build charging stations at office buildings and parking garages to smooth out the bump during daylight hours. Traditionally powered places would aim for home charging at night, when the plants are on but the energy isn't being used.   I imagine it would make certain renewable energy sources more feasible, and stretch our coal-or-oil kWh a little farther as well.

NASA releases the evidence once they are sure enough to avoid getting laughed at or put in the rubber rooms.  Debate ensues.  Then a space race. Whatever put that colony/facility there is immaterial. Even the frozen remnants of the power supply and mechanical lubricant systems that let machinery work at those temperatures would be economically valuable beyond current imagination.  A boom ensues. Some people want to send people. Others want to send robots. We are technologically ready to do neither.  Religious groups flare up. This must be the work of satan or That Other Faith™ or interest. (So the Christians blame the Atheists, the Muslims blame the Christians, the racists blame the Jews, etc. The same people who are rabid about evolution loose their collective shit.) Every U.F.O. cult gets a fresh boost into prominence and the Tinfoil Hat group make legal war about ""finding proof"" that every previous non-U.F.O. incident was really a cover-up.  The politicized science regimes (So the U.S., and Russia primarily) both take a spike in ""political oversight"". The budgets of the space programs go up but there are ""political officers"" in every related lab.  The private spacing concerns really get going, but they cannot get approval for test launches from the G20 nations so they start buying up governments in north Africa and some of the island states.  There are several close calls as ""unauthorized"" launch indications are detected and ""dealt with"" by various nations.  Every ""future war"" program ever envisioned is brought back to life by the military spending folks. We don't have to fight each other too much because frickin aliens are real. But of course some nation states think it's all a hoax to up-arm and everybody starts pointing even more crap at the middle east because, you know, arabs and jews blame each other for everything so why should this be any different in terms of ""middle east tension"".  But the first humans to actually be lost in space and die are either a crew of Chinese political prisoners astronauts or the kind of rich asshole who would normally die trying to summit Everest in a hot air balloon. Either way, the cause is a malfunction of an orion type drive. They manage to get a good burst of outward thrust before the drive breaks down due to underengineering. They miss their lunar orbit insertion because the drive output didn't match expectations because they didn't properly factor for the density of the spatial medium, so there was more light and less push than expected. We get to watch them die of resoruce deprivation as they drift into L1 orbit.  Australia makes the first viable launch. The'd been affably loaning out experts to every program in the world like the nice guys they are, and nobody considered them a contender on their own. It's a joint private/public venture. It's a fairly sophisticated telepresence probe. It reaches the destination and works well for about four days. The conditions there are too harsh... shame we don't ever managed to get enough of that 0.4 kelvin stable lube.  For two hundred ant eighteen years various concerns try to best that first Australian effort with varying degrees of success.  In the mean time, everybody is so fixated on that destination and it's shiny prize that we completely fail to work out and populate space stations and things like the floating city on venus proposition.  Finally a joint multi-national concern gets together to make a proper manned trip using a ship with crew and living space comprable to a large ocean liner, plus all the technology to support the crew for a couple decades.  An infiltrator for the church of Scientology and a Young Earth Creationist conspire to sabatoge the mission and instead send the ship straight to earth at full drive output, blasting us back to the stone age.

The hard part is knowing the current state of a system. Any time you try to measure it, your measurement will be a little bit inaccurate because that's just how measurements are, and you have to hope the slight inaccuracy doesn't affect your ability to predict the system's behavior in the future.

AskScienceDiscussion,3csov0,squidfood,3,Fri Jul 10 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"Many patterns are chaotic, especially in weather, climate, and biology.  Chaotic means that even the tiniest difference (e.g., the water is 0.1degrees warmer in one small part of the ocean, or the classic ""whether a butterfly flaps its wings"") can lead to huge changes in results (e.g. whether a hurricane happens or not).  Since we never, ever know the inputs exactly, it's practically impossible in real life to produce the ""same results"" for something done twice.  At least on the scale that things happen in nature (as opposed to in a lab)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3csov0,Majromax,2,Fri Jul 10 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"I would like another opinion, because it seems things stay mostly the same, like patterns basically, and as long as the pattern doesn't change much, predicted outcomes seem accurate analyzing these patterns.   That's not quite true as you write it.  Some systems can be entirely deterministic, but still practically unpredictable.  Consider a recurrence relation given by:    x(n+1) = r · x(n) · (1 - x(n) )    ... for different values of r.  This equation is wholly determinstic, in that if I know exactly what the current value of x(n) is then the value of x(n+1) and x(n+2) and x(n+3) are all certain.  However, for many values of r, almost knowing x means that we cannot predict x(n+30) (for example) with any accuracy.  This is because the system exhibits chaotic behaviour, where it depends very sensitively upon initial conditions.  An uncertainty of one part in a million or one part in a billion is magnified with time.  This is okay.  Many real systems like weather behave in this way.  The logic is that we cannot usually talk about specific precise outcomes, but we can study the system and find out what the likely range of outcomes is.  Even chaotic systems like this have ""attractors"", which are areas that are more likely to show up than others.  I can't tell you precisely what the weather will be tomorrow, but I can tell you with certainty that it will not snow (here in northern hemisphere summer)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3csov0,BitOBear,2,Fri Jul 10 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"This is the paradox of ""enough"".  If we had ""enough"" data that was ""precise enough"" and we had ""enough"" historical data to figure out the functional outcomes ""precisely enough"" then the universe, and each section thereof, would be deterministic.  But there isn't ""enough data"" to know if you can ever have ""enough data"" to make the precise enough models to plug the current data into.  In general you'd need a system larger than the one you are modeling in order to model that system. ""Larger"" can be ""more complex"" or it can be larger across the domain of time. For instance they do ray-tracing experiments to figure out exactly what will happen during a particle emission. They have very exacting data and they have a giant computer. And it can take days to accurately model microseconds of particle movement. So the system is larger than the collider chamber, or living room, (or whatever) in both space and time.  To exactly predict an event in the universe you would need a data set with data for the entire universe and a system larger than that universe in which to increment and analyze the data.  And don't get me started on how building such a system anywhere near the universe would involve changing the universe...  In other words :: If you eat enough pudding, you'll die! Doubt me? Then start eating pudding! If at any moment you are not dead then you've confounded my premise (or cheated) by not eating enough pudding! So I get to call foul on you for failing to properly perform the experiment.  So you keep eating pudding, constantly, and die of... old age... Was I correct in my initial assertion? I mean you ate the pudding and died, right? But since you're dead I don't really get to rub my correct result in your face, presuming I didn't die of old age first...  As an aside, my premise was not ""if I keep cramming pudding down your throat you'll die."" That premise is completely testable (and true, you can force feed someone to death, pudding or not, by rupturing their stomach). But ""if you eat"" presumes a willing participant so meh...  The word ""enough"" in all its guises is, it turns out, tautological. ""with the right conditions and data"" is one of those guises.  You've basically said ""if you know exactly what's about to happen, do you know exactly what's going to happen?"" That's what ""the right conditions and data"" or ""enough data"" really means.  You pretty much can not ever, as a practical participant in a wider universe, have enough data to be absolutely certain of the outcome.  I believe that the old adage is ""never bet on a sure thing."""
AskScienceDiscussion,3csov0,tiger_16,2,Sat Jul 11 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that there is a distinction between pure mathematics and real-life data. Real-life data operates on the laws of statistics, whereby each data point will have some degree of uncertainty and therefore, it is impossible to obtain a real-life data set and develop a model that predicts the future with arbitrary uncertainty. This is because there is no perfect measuring device that can measure length, mass, time, etc. with complete certainty.   However, if you are a theorist and not an experimentalist, you don't run into this problem because you don't work with measured data. Therefore, you can use the classical wave equation, Schrodinger's equation, etc. to predict the future state of such systems. You will obtain a single answer. But when you go to measure the system, it'll never attain that single answer because of the uncertainty involved in measuring it.   Note that even in theory, you have to implicitly acknowledge uncertainty when you try to calculate a numerical outcome. For instance, if you go to calculate the numerical value of the gravitational force between two theoretical bodies with certain masses, you must use the universal gravitational constant, which is measured. Therefore, it has some degree, however miniscule, of uncertainty. In other words, we know that certain universal constants exist - Boltzmann's constant, ideal gas constant, universal gravitational constant, Planck's constant, etc. - but we do not know the true numerical value of those constants; we only know their values to some finite uncertainty."

It doesn't someday magically ""graduate"" into something else.  A theory is a theory and always will be.   In short, there is absolutely no doubt among scientists that evolution is correct.  More accurately, perhaps, modern evolutionary theory perfectly explains each and every piece of evidence that has been collected.  That doubt exists only amongst creationists and others that do not understand the science.  Much of the solid evidence we have for evolution has come from DNA studies that do essentially what you propose in your question, though your understanding of the details requires some correction."

Also I'm just asking a question here I am not telling or assuming or preaching evolution over creationism.  The problem is that evolution is change, not addition.

AskScienceDiscussion,3ctcdj,matts2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"A few things here. We already use molecular clocks in sort of the way you're describing, but we have to get a baseline rate of mutation for the specific organism. The reason for that is the second issue with your idea. There are evolutionary mechanisms that prohibit simply using nuclear physics. First is that most mutations are deleterious, which means that the vast majority of mutation would not be visible to simple probability estimates, because there's no record of them. The next big thing is that mutations that aren't ether neutral or deadly will be acted upon by selection; so again, we can't just look at the chemistry. But using neutral mutations we already do something very similar to what you're describing. Nature.com has a series of educational pages called Scitable that I just love for things like reddit. Here's their page about molecular clocks."

It's nonconductive, whereas aluminum is a low work-function metal and thus serves as a useful cathode in devices. Unfortunately, it's not transparent, so for optical reasons you either have to work around that or attempt to substitute a transparent material, which is hard because low-WF materials tend to be unstable in air/water.

We're talking about generating 19 times more CO than O2 here, that's not a useful process just yet.

If we find life on another planet and determine that life formed on that planet 1 million Earth years ago could we say that all life on Earth is more evolved than any life on that planet?

AskScienceDiscussion,3cr2cd,SomeGuy565,3,Fri Jul 10 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"The only way that something can be ""more evolved"" than something else is in the sense that one species can be ""better evolved"" to a specific environment than another.

And all three won't last too long at the North Pole where fur seals and polar bears shine.  So in terms of environment suitability, you could argue that point, however terminology comes back to bite you, because they're ""better"" evolved, or more ""suited"" to that environment. ""more evolved"" conveys the same concept, but only to those that aren't pedantic about the correct terminology.

AskScienceDiscussion,3crwph,gassygooselover,4,Fri Jul 10 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"""Running"" consists on pushing oneself against the surface. When you run in a certain direction, you actually push the ground in the opposite way. This is not entirely true, since in the process of running one pushes himself upward as well. While running, one is constantly overcoming air friction. Let us refer to the actions one preforms while running, from the moment he lifts his left foot (Or the right...) from the ground to the moment he lifts it from the ground again after taking a ""step"", as a running ""cycle"". For that example, I ignore the acceleration from standing point and refer to running at ""constant speed"" (This term is inaccurate and we'll see that in a moment), where these ""cycles"" are nearly identical. By pushing yourself against the ground at each cycle, (most of) you accelerate. The speed the speed of your foot relative to the floor at that point is zero (Or otherwise you'd be slipping). Your other foot moves faster than the rest of your body until you place it on the floor, pushing your body forward. While your feet touch the floor you accelerate, while in between, you decelerate. These acceleration/decelerations converge to zero at the end of each cycle, meaning that on the macro scale you maintain a constant speed, while your speed changes periodically.  After this introduction, let's get to the real thing. In lower gravity, you may find out that you tend to bounce more. While running, we push ourself against the ground as well. We learn to walk and run from a very young age, and one could be a very good runner without minding these minor details, like how much force you apply to push yourself upward while running. If you were to run in a lower gravity environment, you'll soon find out you apply too much force that required, and you will ""jump"" higher if you were to run. That will result in less time with feet on the ground, hence - less time accelerating. Though this can mostly be overcome with some practice. Another issue is, that what enables you to push yourself against the ground horizontally is friction. Friction is usually correlated to the amount of vertical force you apply. You'd have to press harder against the lid of the pickle jar in order to open it. Otherwise, you will not have enough grip and your hand will slide over it. If your hands are wet, the friction is even lower, so you'd have to hold the lid much tighter, to dry your hand, or to use a cloth in order to achieve a greater friction coefficient. Back to our example: There is a limit as for the amount of acceleration you can apply against the ground, as there be a point, depending on your weight (Correlated to vertical force) and friction with the ground, that will mostly dictate your top speed. But these things apply mostly to running, and depend more about the friction with the ground (So wearing different shoes and running on a low friction surface will grant you pretty much the same speed that you would have get on earth).  So that ""upper limit"" of running speed, depends on so many factors other than gravity, that it is quite hard to tell. There are, as well the limitation of the human body. There are most likely planets with such intense gravity field, that no muscle could be strong enough to enable an organism to run on top of it.  Astronauts appear to move slow because they bounce a lot. And why wouldn't they? It is much easier (and fun) to move that way. They spend longer time off the ground, moving at nearly constant speed. If you were to walk a distance on the moon, you'd most likely prefer to make a step once every couple of meters, ""hoovering"" most of the time above the surface with a minimal amount of energy to move. And besides, with such bulky suits, you can'r blame them for moving slowly.  Tl;Dr: Running is complex, depends on friction with the surface and running in a different gravity field requires some practice, otherwise you'll bounce.  The hypothesised ""upper limit"" depends more on friction with the surface and the limitations of the human (Or any running organism) body.  The Astronauts on the Moon have to wear bulky clumsy suites that limit their motion. Bouncing on the other hand is much easier, as you need to push yourself against the ground every couple of minutes and to keep ""hoovering"" in a nearly constant speed against the surface without applying any force in between steps.  This whole answer is probably clumsy and messy. I wrote it as I was explaining it to myself, and it could sure use some editing. Sorry about that."
AskScienceDiscussion,3crwph,michaelfri,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:59:31 2015 UTC,"Up to a point, yes.  The limit on how fast you can run usually is how much power (energy per unit time) you can exert.  You need to expend energy for four things: 1) to lift yourself into the air for the part of each stride where neither foot is on the ground, 2) to replace the forward speed lost as your feet hit the ground and your legs flex without being perfect springs, 3) to overcome the viscous/plastic stiffness of your muscles and joints as you move, and 4) to overcome air resistance.  In lower gravity, you wouldn't have to spend as much energy on (1).  There wouldn't be much difference in (2).  You would save a little on (3) by having longer strides, so that your legs can move more slowly in the part of the cycle where you're in the air.  But you have to move just as fast to have the foot that's on the ground move backward relative to the rest of you, so you couldn't save much.  And if the gravity were low enough, you wouldn't have enough friction with the ground to overcome air resistance."

The example I gave was the ordinal instead of left-right speakers.  Getting someone to write the test ethnically isn't dispositive, if they are required to write the test such that the left-right information is still critical.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,sciencebzzt,-1,Thu Jul 9 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"The other back and forth was in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/3c8im1/study_rates_learning_capabilities_of_subsaharan/  with a person who was asking about a genetics study and wasn't really debating, but really asking, and seemed incredulous so I explained it with citations.  If you read through, you'll see the citations I posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/3c8im1/study_rates_learning_capabilities_of_subsaharan/csu00gu  as I said to him: I totally sympathize with your attitude... but to be a good scientist, you have to go into every subject willing to totally change your fundamental beliefs based on the data. No matter what the data says, if it's logical and convincing, you have to follow it. I understand that in our society, we're kind of brought up to think that intelligence equals a person's worth, and that different races are all of equal worth (the second is a noble belief and none of these facts can change it - as a person is a person no matter their height or color or IQ and are therefore all of the same worth). When you put those two together, you think ""well, everyone must have the same intelligence"". However, as a person of science, you have to understand that we are simply biological material, in that, our intelligence and even our personalities, are the result of a biological organ. And that many peoples ancestors lived for tens of thousands of years separate from each other. Long enough to evolve differences in every single part of their bodies from the obvious skin color and hair color and texture, to their teeth (some Asian's don't ever develop wisdom teeth, and different races have different shaped teeth), to the skeletal structure like the ratio of length of long bones or skull shape or any number of variations (for instance, some sub-saharan Africans have fused triquetral bones in their wrists), to the many different blood types, and fat distribution and literally everything. These are fairly large differences, in fact the changes in blood type alone is the beginning of speciation. All these things have changed among different groups of peoples, and yet, you want to believe that they all have exactly the same brains with the exact same IQ, and you base that belief on... your desire for it to be true? You have to take your morality out of the equation. Once people are forced to accept this, many ""progressive"" people start moving the goalposts. They'll say ""oh, well... IQ is meaningless anyway"". When in reality, it clearly isn't. IQ is correlated with future success in life in every culture and in every society. Now, future success doesn't equal your worth as a person... but it IS a real and objective measurement and therefore isn't meaningless. Also, there are the people who say that race doesn't exist, or that it is a ""socially constructed"" thing. That's another misleading claim. Race does exist on a continuum, that much is true. However, there are very clear ""bulges"" on that continuum. It is an objective measurement, not a subjective one. Ask anyone who works in pharmacogenomics. Different medicines work differently on people of different races. Science is science and politics are politics and politics should never enter the world of science. Like I said, I totally understand and sympathize with your viewpoint, but you really have to look at things objectively and without any preconceived ideas. The truth is never a bad thing."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,sciencebzzt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"The AMA's study ""Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns"", which was authored by a task force of respected psychologists and meant to put an end to the controversy about the IQ gap, says this:   There was a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g). Controlled studies of the way the tests were formulated and administered had shown that this did not contribute substantially to the difference.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,BitOBear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"That begs the questions... if some culture bias is in play, then why do Asians, from Asia, score higher than whites on tests designed by whites? Studies have been done altering every variable they could, and they always come back with the same results... there comes a time when you have to say that maybe there is something to it.   (ASIDE: I don't think that you know what ""begs the question"" usually means. Begging a question is, more properly ""beggaring a question"", e.g. reducing the importance or value of an inquiry by assuming the answers. But Americans are bad at English and muddied the whole thing by beggaring the idea of beggaring a question ... 8-)  But yes, that does encourage one to ask about those elements...  The answer is fairly simple. White people are not, really, any sort of pinnacle.  So let's put this in some less-charged terms.  Suppose I build a system like a video game, and because I have a right-turn bias I consciously or unconsciously decide to make a maze in the game particularly tough if you follow a right-hand-rule in exploration. Now I'm trying to be ""fair"" but I sprinkle just a little more hazard or delay if you take the right doors.  Then along comes someone from a left-hand-bias culture and they find my maps ""way less challenging"" than they'd heard.  And along comes someone from a much more right-hand-biased culture and they find my game completely infuriating because in my culture going right is common but in their's its almost mandatory.  (Note this is a real thing, motion studies prove that North Americans, upon entering a door, go right almost always, this is used in store design to lead people to impulse buys and things like that.)  So let's say the European bias is towards a certain way of thought. Say it's a bias towards proof by congruence. And so I make this test and my bias is to use patterns based on similarity of shape and variance of size and orientation. Now lets say Asians have a different mode-of-thought bias, say it's proof-by-induction based. And let's say the Africans have a third preferential mode, say sequence propagation vs elimination.  The test has a congruence bias, and that's a subset of induction. So the White people score median as designed, the Asians do better than median because induction gives them congruence and extrapolation. The Africans do worse because they are better at serialization. Well we test all three modes, but we've made most of the sequencing questions easy because it's less important to us (because we suck at it so our science standards don't emphasize it) and the the congruence questions are generally a little harder because that's where our science is focused. Then the very hardest questions are induction based because that's the most difficult form of congruence.  Now everybody gets the serialization questions right because they were soft-balls. And most of the test base does okay on congruence because they are bulk body of the test and everybody's been taught that topic, but it's a little harder fro the Africans. Then the Asians do well on the Induction questions, the Whote Europeans struggle and the Africans do more poorly than average.  However, if the taught subject matter and the test bias had been slow-ball on induction, medium pitch on congruence, and hard-ball on sequencing the results would have been symmetric around the mean with the Africans peaking and the Asians losing a few points.  (ASIDE: I don't have any information that the above is true in detail, this is a ""how can that system fail some factors up and some other factors down"" system-wide analysis example.)  This sort of systemic bias is common in lots of automation and analysis systems. It is, in fact, why you can set the floating point processor in a computer to generally round up, round down, or round towards zero. The tiny bias that produces can profoundly effect the outcomes of computations and so different biases need to be in place for different kinds of mathematical analysis, and the bias must be selected consistently to avoid introducing compounding noise.  So IQ is something of a joke in that it pretends to be a scalar, but it's a composite vector sum. If the dominant culture is ""north by north-east biased"" and a secondary culture is ""north biased"" and another secondary culture is ""east biased"" then you could have three cultures with equal magnitude potential (total distance from the origin would be equal on a fair multi-axis measurement) but the the non-scalar elements in the system used by the test end up ranking the three cultures as dissimilar when they try to collapse the graph.  We know there are different ""kinds of intelligence"" such as spatial versus temporal reasoning. You only need to slightly favor one to significantly devalue the other when your goal is to just cough up an integer score and point at it as definitive.  From first blush, anybody trained in computing or information analysis knows that I.Q. is the phrenology of cognitive assessment. It's an overly simplified idea from a terribly ill-informed time.  There is a famous drawing. In it several people are sitting in a circle, one of the figures is a woman wearing vaguely African clothing. In the drawing there is a square structure just barely touching her head scarf. There is also another vertical structure to her right between her and the man sitting next to her that sort of forks out at top and bottom. Europeans see this as a bunch of people sitting indoors with a window behind the woman. Rural Africans see this as a group of people sitting outside beneath a tree while the woman is balancing an object on her head.  In another test a modern-ish cartoon bus is shown. The image is symmetric with identical front and rear windows and side windows. The question is asked ""which way is the bus moving""? Adults are fifty/fifty split on saying left or right. But seventy percent (70%) school age children (who were literally the children of the adults asked) answer that the bus is going to the left. Why? Because children take the bus more. Why is that significant? The side of the bus you can see has no door... so the front of the bus must be to the left. The test took place in north america so the right side of the bus is the curb side etc.  So when viewed as a perturbing variable, cultural bias has a huge cumulative cognitive input, but its subtle as all hell.  Since thought it a neuro-chemical process subject to evolution, it's pretty much a given that persistent acculturation would become an evolutionary pressure. But there is no evidence to suggest it would be a ""retarding"" pressure.  Since evolution is essentially always a case of specialization from the general, anything with a gene-line basis is sure to be a case where particular kinds of intellectual bias were positively selected for.  Since the average neuron count and density in all brains studied to date indicate overwhelming similarity in structure and positioning the most reasonable conclusion is that the tests of capacity are flawed. The structural capacity is normative, which indicates that any observed bias would be procedural instead of a question of magnitude.  We don't avoid these findings, we avoid the people trying to over-simplify these findings in order to justify a social agenda."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,sciencebzzt,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"We're at an impasse.  Any reply I make to anything you've said will just be something I've already said, with citations.  For instance:   From first blush, anybody trained in computing or information analysis knows that I.Q. is the phrenology of cognitive assessment. It's an overly simplified idea from a terribly ill-informed time.   Basically calling IQ a pseudoscience isn't just wrong, it's funny.   I already said that IQ is correlated with a huge number of life outcomes, future success, wealth, longevity, etc.  It's also correlated with reaction time, musical ability, and a number of other traits.  It's a real metric that measures an objectively real thing with objectively real results. No one is saying its the end-all of a person or that is measures all that their mind can do, but it does measure what we call ""g"" or general intelligence and it measures it well.  It's the best measure we have of a person's cognitive profile.  If you have a better metric to use, I'm curious to hear it.  Decades of research, with a portion of it done by researchers with the politically motivated intent of closing the gap... and yet we have come up with nothing that can more accurately measure the cognitive profile of an individual.  AND... despite what you claim, it does that WITHOUT bias, according to essentially everyone who works in the field and everyone who has researched the possibility of bias in the tests, like the signers of ""Mainstream Science on Intelligence""(link at the bottom of this comment) and the authors of the AMA study on the issue (which also reflects the consensus of the psychology community):   The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of Blacks and Whites (about one standard deviation, although it may be diminishing) does not result from any obvious biases in test construction and administration, nor does it simply reflect differences in socio-economic status.    Also, would you consider a private-sector psychometrician someone who is trained in information analysis?  People who work for private companies doing this sort of work aren't beholden to politically correct managers and they don't have pre-conceived intentions before they do their research.  Their data needs to be totally accurate and have real world applications since its often used for high dollar projects.    Anyway, you don't consider IQ to be a valid metric.  So what about a more concrete measurement?  Like head size, brain volume, or EQ (encephalization quotient)?  All of those differ among different races as well, with people of sub-Saharan African ancestry having the smallest brain size (with only Aboriginal Australians have a smaller brain size), and Asians having the largest.  Coincidentally, the sizes map neatly to the results of IQ averages of different races.  The fact is, different groups of people have evolved apart from each other for about 40,000 to 100,000 years.  That's a long time.  But you're not going to be convinced, and I have no reason to doubt the crushing totality of data supporting what I'm saying... so again, we're at an impasse.    If you'd like to read more on the issue, in addition to all the things I've already linked to, like the major AMA study, here are two good links:  Mainstream Science on Intelligence - which is a statement on intelligence and IQ testing signed by 52 university professors specializing in intelligence and related fields.  It supports everything that I have said.   the Race and Intelligence article on wikipedia - is a very fair summary of the whole issue and includes all sides of the debate and a large number of citations."

You're being selective in what you believe, too.  Personally, I believe that the brain is a lot more like a muscle than scientists have been wont to believe - that is, the more you exercise an aspect of intelligence, the ""stronger"" it gets. Despite all the genetic differences between the races that you mention, look at any weight-lifting competition, and you will find them all represented.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,W_Edwards_Deming,2,Fri Jul 10 07:05:09 2015 UTC,"The Bell Curve is a good example.  Specific to Psychology, but an overview of the problem and the harm it causes."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,BitOBear,8,Thu Jul 9 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it also the problem that the politically incorrect part was, on later examination, largely due to preselection bias?  In particular, one of the premises of ""The Bell Curve"" was ""Intelligence exists and is accurately measurable across racial, language, and national boundaries"" but this largely fell apart when linguistic analysis demonstrated that language encodes biases for what is important as intelligence.  [TL;DR :: ""The Bell Curve"" is a darling of a certain set of folks, but it's wholly debunked as being based on untrue cultural assumptions.]  For example there is a language (I think it is an Australian Aboriginal language) where the idea of ""right"" and ""left"" don't exist. In the language one always expresses turns as ordinals -- q.v. ""now turn north"" instead of ""now turn left"".  These sorts of language elements alter the ""accurate measure of intelligence"". For instance a speaker of that language will outshine virtually everyone else in spatial reasoning but will fail many spatial reasoning tests if they are phrased in terms of relative directional changes via ""left"" and ""right"".  Political correctness for its own sake is fairly abysmal, but in terms of a warning sign, it is outstanding.  If you are about to publish something that seems ""politically incorrect"" then historically there is a high probability that it's factually incorrect as well.  When fully analyzed, most ""politically incorrect"" positions have, again and again, eventually turned out to actually be the result of improper generalization and confirmation bias.  For instance BiDil is a heart medication that only works on Black Males. Nobody really knows why for sure. The publication of this information was not actually politically incorrect, and the uneducated treated it like it was none the less. But no harm, no foul.  So this medication and its results were a ""touchy subject"" but it didn't fall afoul of the political correctness issue in the end.  Likewise we are finally getting to the point where we can discuss medications and treatments only applicable to genders or genetic lines, but this is because science isn't involved in political correctness. More particularly science has finally stopped thinking in terms of eugenic superiority of genomes and cultures.  So where The Bell Curve's message was ""Black folk just aren't as smart as us upstanding whites and I can prove it"" it collapsed.  Meanwhile we have quietly demonstrated that genders and germ lines do vary in the particular areas in which they excel the norms. And it seems that every germ line has something it does better than everybody else in the realm of intelligence.  We just have to keep apace with the science while we let the stupid racists die out.  A variation in set theory or state theory or spatial awareness or theoretical reasoning or mathematical reasoning is likely and strongly demonstrated in various combination in many lines.  It's the judgmental douchebaggery that has to be sorted out and discarded.  So suppose it turns out that black males are outstanding at multitasking and spatial awareness and end-item tracking (I don't actually have any evidence for this, but just suppose), some racist fuck might conclude ""that's why all they're good for is sports"" while someone with a brain might instead observe that yea, team sports, but also job site management, security oversight, military deployment strategy (as in being outstanding officer material at the strategic level), port management, and rapid supply chain management, and child care are all areas where the black guy might out compete the white guy.  The difference isn't in the scientific observation, the difference lays in whether the observations are used to propagate a useless stereotype or to determine the wide variety of advantages provided and to match the man with the job.  Women used to run all information systems. They used to have almost all the computing and collating and information management positions. They are objectively better at those tasks. That they got crowded out of these fields when the jobs went ""high tech"" is a virtual sin against progress.  This happened because of the social stigma rules change used to kick them out of manufacturing when WWII ended. It's an almost criminal change.  So science often bears the brunt of bucking social norms.  Currently the problem is prejudice in funding. Politicians refuse to fund projects that might upset their ""base"" with unpleasant truths like racial congruence and pollution.  So we are already edited half to death, but it's not the ""political correctness"" that's doing it.  INFLAMMATORY STATEMENT WARNING! If you can't process complex ideas, stop reading now.  I, personally, think we should scuttle the term ""equality"". Nobody is equal to anybody. I can't ""sports"" and others can. I don't ""higher math"" well and others can. I can program better than almost anybody and I can do information set theory and recall that so well that people are always ""how the fuck did you know/find that.""  Almost everyone has one or two things that they to so well it boggles the mind. Some of those things are mental. Some of those things are physical.  And indeed some people are just a waste of space and food.  Nobody is equal and we should stop treating people as if they are equal because equal means interchangeable.  People have equal rights. People deserve equal access.  People are not ""equal"" by any measure, at least not that I've ever met.  So people are congruent at best. And valuable. But screw equality, that's killing us all.  So the real crux of the near future is that we all know people aren't equal. And science proves factual inequality.  The challenge will be to grow as a species and to understand that we don't even want people to be equal.  What we want is the chance for individual optimization. And for individual optimization to work then individual understanding must first exist.  Arguments to broad superiority are ridiculous.  Arguments to equality of individuals are ridiculous.   Understanding equality of need is necessary and different than those first two.  Understanding what makes each person's excellence will first require us to understand what benefits are to be gleaned from each germ line and each person's most useful opportunities.  That thing we've done where we pretend every kid is on track to a college degree in the liberal arts or STEM is a disservice. Nobody should be denied that track, but, for instance, my paternal grandfather was a mechanic of peerless quality. It was his team that developed ""the fifth wheel"" that is now standard on tractor trailers. If everyone had been on the college track in the 1920s we might not have long-haul trucking because he'd have been pushed into some other career. Who knows.  I personally am really good at a few things but I am a terrible manager. My career track seems to insist that I must next be fitted into management. That's retarded.  ""The Peter Principle"", the idea that we keep promoting people along a well designed track and only stop promoting them once they reach a job the are ill-suited to do is a horror of wasted human potential. It is an outgrowth of the ""human equality"" ideal and it's been making people miserable since the beginning of time.  Understanding talent is hard.  We need to stop trying to cold-hammer people into their little, equal molds.  So there is something ""politically incorrect"" that science actually knows. The problem isn't publishing it. It's out there. The problem is that we've created a system where people are muzzling rational thought because it doesn't ""feel right to them"".  So psychology and social science and genetics have been creeping up on these presumed norms of equality and they will eventually strangle them to death. It will be a macabre dance of great subtlety as it will have to side-step racism, classism, and the ever popular specter of eugenics. Along there will be much punditry and finger pointing. And political correctness will be one of the many fires we circle around. But what facts there are will out eventually.  We spent about 210 years on the whole gay issue, which went from a non-issue to a Victorian outrage to a secret club to a moral calling and is now droping back to a social norm.  We've done the same dance with women's suffrage.  We've finally, after uncounted history, started to get off the racial high horse.  Once we get everyone on the more or less level playing field we'll start being able to sort for excellence along all axis instead of just the politically ruling blood lines.  Science is the art of telling feelings to fuck off if they don't match the facts, as such it's never been politically correct and it doesn't seem ready to start up with that now."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,BitOBear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"No, its an argument to fact.  The Nature versus Nurture argument has been raging for centuries. It's deeply ingrained in our science and culture. (For example ""Tarzan"" was philosophically motive treatise on how an english lord, deprived of all upbringing, raised by apes, would still grow to be lord of the jungle. How his breeding would out and he'd wait to find a mate until Lady Jane showed up, a proper peer worthy of his attention and his seed. How he would be able to integrate immediately back into English society. And how the lordly domain would have him called back to oversee the degenerate African as lordship encodes for Noblesse Oblige.)  The structures of the arguments. The patterns of the discussions are almost formalized at this point. Who argues purely to nature and who argues purely to nurture. It's a dance. And when you see the dance start, you know where the steps will lead.  But over those centuries it's been shown, again and again, that never yet has there been a case where one was a factor, that it didn't turn out that both were factors.   Indeed the fact that both are interlocked is the current state of scientific discipline.  So for example the typical questions of chemistry don't involve nature or nurture at all.  But essentially every measurable social or cognitive trait we've ever identified has been proved to require both structural capacity and cultural/social support or promptings. More exactly every such trait has been shown to suffer catastrophic failure if either its biological or sociological formation is sabotaged.  So while it's very clever to try to conflate the existence of a common range with your ""argument to moderation"" card, In ""fallacy poker"" I trump in with the ""fallacy fallacy"" interrupt.  So yes, if you got ""argument to moderation"" out of ""centuries of evidence demonstrate that these sorts of questions never end up exclusively in one of the two offered domains"" is a strong statement of misunderstanding on your part.  The argument to moderation is the statement ""the truth must lie somewhere between these two positions because both positions exist"".  My statement is that, again and again, it has been demonstrated that both factors play a role, and almost always that role is equal.  Asking if it's nature or nurture is like asking if it's ""heat"" or ""pressure"" when we know that the two are essentially always functionally linked, and claiming that my statement that ""buddy, it's always both heat and pressure"" is some attempt to find a ""moderate middle ground"", instead of a statement of mutually necessary variables, is dismissive and incorrect.  Where behavior is concerned, what isn't covered by biology is covered by acculturation, and what isn't covered by acculturation is covered by biology.   There is ample evidence that both factors obtain to the topic of functional intelligence."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cocd6,sciencebzzt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:03:49 2015 UTC,"The authors of the AMA study laid out all the facts in their report, and said what they said to avoid the inevitable backlash against anyone who openly admits what the data implies.  If you read the report, it contradicts itself on that point.  They say flat out that IQ is heritable (in other words, genetic) and that heritability increases with age.    Plenty of esteemed scientists have had their reputations tarnished because the media and the public didn't like what they said.  James Watson is a good example, and J. Philippe Rushton, even James Flynn, and E.O. Wilson of all people, have been criticized for so-called ""racist"" remarks at some point.  So psychologists tread very lightly with this issue.  Still, the statement ""Mainstream Science on Intelligence"" - which was actually signed by several authors of the AMA study - explicitly said:   Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against American blacks or other native-born, English-speaking peoples in the U.S. Rather, IQ scores predict equally accurately for all such Americans, regardless of race and social class.    If you look at the data, the conclusion is obvious unless you just refuse to see it. First, IQ is heritable. That's known.  In childhood, the heritability is about .5.  As a person ages, their IQ trends toward their predisposed setpoint, and by the time a person is 18, the heritability of IQ is about .75 to .85.    Second, a gap on intelligence tests exists between whites and blacks, and between whites and asians.  The gap has been shown using a huge variety of different intelligence tests, and they all come back with the same sized gap.    Third, reaction time correlates with IQ.  Both simple reaction time (SRT - just reacting to a single stimulus) and choice reaction time (CRT - reacting to two different stimuli with two different possible responses).  In aggregate, reaction time has a .7 correlation with IQ.  It's difficult to argue that reaction time is a culturally biased metric.  Fourth, intelligence tests done on bi-racial children show an average IQ approximately halfway between the black average and the white average, despite the children identifying as black and living in the black community.  This is exactly what we'd expect if IQ was genetic.   Fifth - Dozens of studies have been done measuring brain size using different methods - MRI, endocranial volume measured from empty skulls, wet brain weight at autopsy, and external head size measurements.  They all yield similar results.  The largest study was done by Kenneth L. Beals and measured the  endocranial volume of approximately 20,000 skulls. When controlled for age and body size, all of the studies showed significant differences in average group brain size, with Asians having larger brains than whites, who in turn have significantly larger brains than blacks.  Whites have brains almost 100g heavier than blacks on average.   Sixth - Brain size was found to have a positive correlation of about 0.4 with general cognitive ability.    Seventh - A longer infancy is related to greater brain growth.  It's related to whats called 'neoteny', which is the retaining of juvenile traits into adulthood.  Delaying maturation is the reason we have big heads and big brains and more gracile jaws and brow ridges compared to our proto-human ancestors.  Black children mature faster than both white children and asian children.  Black babies hold their heads up sooner, they walk sooner, develop hand dexterity sooner, feed themselves sooner... they are several months ahead in every developmental milestone in infancy.  Asian children, on the other hand, mature more slowly than do white children or black children.  Asian children often don't walk until 13 months. Walking starts at 12 months for white children and 11 months for black children.  Also, despite the fact that the average gestation time for black women in the US is 39 weeks (contrast with 40 weeks for white women), black babies still suffer less from respiratory distress syndrome than white babies for any given gestation at birth.  Black pre-term babies also have a higher survival rates than white pre-term babies.  Black children also reach sexual maturity sooner (about 1-2 years sooner) than white children.   Also bear in mind, no one has yet been able to develop an intelligence test which shows blacks and whites scoring equally.    The preponderance of evidence suggests that the differences in intelligence between asians, whites, and blacks are genetically based for the most part.  Groups separated from each other for 40,000+ years will evolve differences.  Given how long the groups have been apart, and how many other differences have evolved (body style, height, fat distribution, blood type, level of neoteny, rate of childhood development, age at puberty, skull shape, skeletal structure, hormone levels, cranial capacity, etc).  We have all this evidence... now imagine we're talking about some other species, like ravens.  Imagine there are 3 geographically separate groups of fictional ravens who have lived apart from each other for 40,000+ years.  Now imagine we have the same amount and type of evidence as we do for humans... do you think anyone would have difficulty acknowledging that it suggests some genetic differences between each group of ravens?  Or imagine we're talking about a non-psychological trait in humans, like height.  Very few people would deny the conclusion that the trait was genetic.    Its patently obvious, everyone in the field knows it, everyone talks about it with each other, they base policy recommendations and suggest new studies based on it.  Meanwhile, non-scientists and people who aren't in the field strain themselves trying to come up with reasons why the very obvious truth can't be true."

We need equal protections. We ought to each get as many chances to excel and improve as we can individually stomach.  But ""equal"" is a lazy ass word to use when it's clearly underselling everyone.  Being treated equally ""regardless of creed or color"" is a right of treatment, its covered in that ""equal rights"" part, it is not at issue here, we both already agreed to that.  I think the word needs to be retired because of the very visceral reaction it produces, just as it produced in you just now. It's a word full of feelings that no longer matches the meaning of the word.  If you and I are equal then neither of us is deserving of the individual consideration we require. Our individuality can be reclassified as burdensome. And then we are all measured compared to a upper bound instead of a median or lower bound.  The entire mathematical and circumstantial ideal of ""equal"" is pure poison when applied to people.  Equal, when applied to things is great. Equal opportunity. Equal protection under the law. These are descriptions of the playing field not the players. The playing field needs to be fair.  But lets say that we discover that Pacific Islanders are neurologically most apt at sound recognition. They are literally ""smarter"" and more fit at that task than any other people on earth. It would behoove us to value that excellence. So maybe we end up slotting them in to musical production and engineering quality control and everybody wins because we've found a set of jobs that a genome is extra fit for.  As a catalog of advantages is compiled we could optimize the hell out of the human race and it would be outstanding.  To date, however, that's not how this has worked. To date we've been assuming ""the white guy"" is the gold standard for all tasks and any variance from that standard must be a stupidity.  What a crock of horseshit.  To date we know some very interesting things, but we use them to ruin folks instead of help them. There are some reasoning tasks at which women beat the pants off of men. But we've systematically arranged the various test such that the women who can't ""dumb down"" to the man's patterns at that test are classified as ""below average"". They didn't fail at the task, they failed at ""doing the task the same way a man would.""  Talk about shooting humanity in the foot...

Back in the day (I'm fifty) I got a bunch of space opera books and some of the time-life books on science at that age. I also got a big coffee-table book full of scifi illustrations that someone had loosely built a narrative around. I wish I still had that book. I spent hours imagining what it would be like to be in those places. Giant space cities, slightly grungy star ports. standing next to derelicts.  At that age the mind is still geared towards story confabulations and rule building. As such getting too factual is often not the best course to expand the mind.  So go to some bookstores or whatever.  Feed the imagination while you can, and then introduce the limitations once the dreams are in place and the brain is ready for that as well.  The continuous presence of the time-life books on science (damn, those things were good and accessible) let me compare the dream ships of the art books and the word pictures of the pulp to the actual catalog of rockets and stuff.  I didn't actually read the pulp scifi until about third grade, but I looked at all the art and pondered the titles and the fact that I would eventually read them was a given because they were mine.  So maybe get some of the Jane's Guide books that have rockets in them (if any exist) to balance out the science fantasy.

At a minimum, everything computers do is math, and sometimes quite abstruse, sophisticated math at that. But it's much more than that. You can't image the brain an MRI machine without first studying non-Euclidean topology (since the magnet is a donut). You can't design modern electronics without taking into account the intimidating mathematical world of quantum effects. Just getting a package delivered in a timely fashion turns out to involve serious, serious math.  That said, the thinking that ""pure math isn't useful"" usually travels in close company with ""I'll never need X after I finish school."" It's an argument from ignorance, and frankly it's a big way in which science journalism (and especially science television) is failing the public. The best way to help people appreciate that math is essential is to remind people what math has been used for and is still used for, and to emphasize that we couldn't have done it without the precision and predictive reliability that math offers."

Economics has benefited immensely from the work of mathematicians like John Nash.   Personally, I think your question is 'wrong'. Research grants should be just that, for research. Too many research grants seem to be going to work that is purely applied, which may not do anything to really advance a discipline."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cn07y,v4vijayakumar,13,Thu Jul 9 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"We have only guesses about what these objects are (also, it's not my field, but I am very hesitant to endorse the phrase ""dark energy particles""), so we can't necessarily make accurate predictions about what could come from them. But I, and I would guess most physicists, would expect that there probably are absolutely no (EDIT: technological, since I presume that's what you meant) applications whatsoever, or at least not any immediate ones. And that's OK.  There are two reasons to do science. One is to indulge our curiosity, enrich our understanding of the world, and learn beautiful things about the universe. I find that reason fairly compelling, but perhaps you don't, and I don't care to argue that at the moment. So the other reason to do science is to look for new phenomena and principles that have technological applications. A big issue with this, though, is that generally speaking we have no idea what will have technological applications. By definition, science tries to discover things that nobody knew before, so we don't know where those new ideas will take us because we don't know what those ideas are! So we study everything we're curious about and maybe applications fall out.  A couple of examples of major applications of physics (since that's the field I know best) that were completely unforseen when the science was being done:   The work of Isidor Rabi on how the nuclei of atoms behave in a magnetic field (""nuclear magnetic resonance"") was done in 1938. It was widely recognized as scientifically important at the time, but its best-known application was completely unexpected: the resulting physics was used in 1971 to invent MRI.  Our understanding of quantum mechanics, pioneered in the 1920s, is critical to the existence of the modern transistor. I don't know the history well enough to know for sure if the transistor could have been invented without a detailed understanding of quantum mechanics (though I strongly suspect not, as most of the ideas underlying semiconductors are fundamentally quantum), but  understanding quantum effects is crucial to be able to make modern transistors as small and efficient as they are. There's a famous quote, widely attributed to Michael Faraday in the 1850s, that the use of electricity was that ""One day sir, you [a British minister] may tax it,"" suggesting that electricity was thought to be useless at the time. It's probably an apocryphal quote, but it may reflect an actual attitude at the time (historians of science - can you confirm/refute?).   As for particle physics, it has had enormous influence on medical imaging and therapies, improved tools for applied research, and many other fields, particularly due to particle accelerator technology. But in general, many people are working on basic research for which they have long-term applications in mind - quantum computing is a major example, which requires us to thoroughly understand fundamental issues in quantum mechanics before we can implement quantum computers well.   That said, as a rule of thumb, don't expect that any particular piece of basic science will directly yield applications. But science as a whole does. And that's a big reason to do it, even if it seems ""useless"" in the applied sense."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cl5bw,drinkmorecoffee,9,Wed Jul 8 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by 'advances', for instance the aftermath over the infamous Tuskegee experiment led to vital legislation being passed. But the truth is that generally these medical experiments needlessly harm the participants, and that they can almost always be replicated in an ethical manner, so it's not surprising that more often than not scientific and medical advancement is rarely the highest priority for the type of person who would perform an unethical experiment. As such, they rarely provide useful results (e.g., you're not exactly using a randomized sample when your participants can only be an oppressed ethnic group, etc., etc.) . A great example of this are the Edgewood experiments, which due to poor methodological standards, unsurprisingly failed to provide many generalized long-term conclusions.   However, with that said, huge swaths of psychological practice and research dating until at least the 1980s are largely unethical by modern standards, but time and again Universities (sometimes heavily encouraged by government funding) failed to implement adequate punishments or safeguards against unethical experimentation. (Keep in mind when I say 'until at least the 1980s,' I'm not including many clearcut recent examples, as the unethical practitioners consistently obfuscate their involvement or debate the ethics themselves, even despite, sometimes, mountains of evidence to the contrary, so it's difficult to make definitive conclusions about more recent controversies.)  There are honestly more examples in the psychological field than can even be listed here. You'd have to explore the ethics violations more as categories than as specific examples.   So, for instance, you have some commonly utilized clinical experiments that still have some applicability to this day. Like the two most famous obedience studies, the Yale University Milgrim experiment and the Stanford Prison experiment. Both of which have lent much to our understanding of human obedience (despite, unsurprisingly many, methodological problems). Clinical experiments also lend themselves to intentionally cruel animal experiments, many of which were so horrific it's almost incomprehensible. But one of the few that's still cited, utilized, and explored today is probably the UofWisconsin 'Pit of Despair'.  Beyond clinical experiments, there are many unethical case studies (many far more horrific than the comparatively large scale experiments) which continue to be a source of exploration and debate. Of course, as case studies are impossible to generalize they lend themselves even more to criticisms of their usefulness than the unethical experiments. The Johns Hopkins University 'Little Albert' case study was extremely valuable in its support for the behavioral perspective of psychology (even though it would never be replicated exactly under today's ethics guidelines). However, there are far more unethical case studies that unsurprisingly ended up teaching us what psychological perspectives were flat-out wrong. For instance, the also affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, David Reimer case which through his death, helped highlight the important biological factors underpinning gender and presumably transgenderism. Also, despite what many psychoanalytics would admit, pretty much any case study associated with Freud (and by extension, early psychoanalytic theory as a whole) was fraught with almost predatory ethical violations.  As far as unethical psychological research goes, the list goes on and on and on.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cl8f2,MarcusDrakus,2,Wed Jul 8 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"We don't really split atoms -- not directly, anyway. What we do is create certain special kinds of atomic nuclei that split naturally, all by themselves. (And if these special nuclei, as they split, also release particles that turn their neighbors into special nuclei, which then split ..., then we can get a self-sustaining reaction. If this reaction releases heat -- they generally do -- then we can do something with that heat. If the reaction proceeds at a limited, controllable rate, then might be able to base a reactor on it, and generate electricity. If it is an ever-faster, runaway effect, then we might have a bomb.)  So: we cannot just split any old thing we want.  OTOH, fusing any old particles we feel like fusing is a bit more doable. We fuse things (nuclei, various particles) by smashing them into each other. One way to do this is to make them very hot, so that they zip around quickly and eventually collide. This happens in a thermonuclear bomb, and also at the center of the sun. Another method is more controlled: create a high-energy beam of particles and then smash the beam into something -- either a stationary target or another beam going the opposite direction. This, as /u/MarcusDrakus noted, is what the Large Hadron Collider does.  I would take issue with his statement that ""nothing happens"". On the contrary, lots of interesting things happen, which is why the LHC exists in the first place. For example, occasionally, a never-before-seen particle is created. True, these things do happen very, very quickly, with no long-term effects.  There are a few limitations on the things we are good at fusing. They need to be things we can make a lot of. Electrons and protons are very abundant, and when we have some, they stick around for a while. We can do things with them. Most other subatomic particles are hard to make in large quanties; most of them decay into other particles pretty quickly. Some, like the various kinds of neutrinos, are difficult to control -- we can't really make a focussed beam out of them.

Additionally, the semiconductor have a chance to fail/burn (like dead pixels on a monitor or a camera) so having a lot of them means that the light bulb is not ruined. Also the material heats up a lot compared to its small surface (typically about 60-70% of the electrical energy is converted to heat, which is why it is not possible to just send more current through the diode so that is gets brighter) and it is technically easier to cool down several small pieces than a large one; the cooling is also more homogeneous making the element more reliable."

Since the dicing happens so early in the manufacturing process, it saves time and cost to only dice a few small sizes, such that all the subsequent parts and processes ""fit"" with it. Also there are such varying requirements for each type of bulb and lamp, that it makes sense for most LED manufacturers to hit wattage/lumens targets with arrays of small chips, rather than produce large, extremely bright chips that may be unsuitable for lower brightness bulbs.

AskScienceDiscussion,3cka1h,jordo_baggins,5,Wed Jul 8 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"Here's the first thing you need to know. Physicists don't agree on the questions you're asking (maybe some of them, but not on the essence of your confusion). How you look at these things depend on your interpretation of quantum mechanics. The standard answer that's usually taught in basic quantum mechanics courses is somewhere between what's called the Copenhagen interpretation and what I like to call the ""stop asking questions"" interpretation. On one hand this makes sense as these are deep questions and students are supposed to learn how to solve math equations and not worry too much about what is ""actually"" going on. One the other hand this can be extremely frustrating. I know it was for me. Simple questions like what is a measurement (or when does the wave function collapse) didn't get satisfying answers.   The second thing you need to know follows from the first point. You're asking questions that are often deemed too distracting for university courses on quantum mechanics. Not that they don't get answers, but they, imo, don't get proper answers.   The third thing is that whatever interpretation you pick, the answer you get is going to be very different from anything else you experience in your life. Our minds are wired to understand new things in terms of things we already understand. When I've taught courses on the subject I often tell people the best thing they initially do is to stop trying to understand quantum mechanics in classical terms. You go down to the math. Then you slowly build up your intuition from there. I think if you follow the math you end up with my interpretation of quantum mechanics, but obviously some people disagree.   Here is a couple of things to consider from my point of view on the question (and several prominent physicists). Calling it a probability wave is a misnomer. That wave is not some probability of the particle being somewhere within that wave. The wave and the particle is the same thing. Literally identical. In fact, particle is a bad name. I will call it a particle, because that's the accepted terminology.   So in my view, the double slit experiment there's not a probability of the particle going through the left slit and the right slit. It's going through both. If you put up a detector at each slit, you will detect it at each slit. But here's the kicker, that makes people really upset. The version of you that detects it at the right slit and the version of you that detects it at the left slit will never interact. You'll go on your separate ways both subjectively noting which slit you measured the particle at. And, yes, you do lose a lot of people at this point. But this is seriously not some weird fringe idea. It is simply applying the rules of quantum mechanics to the entire universe. Stephen Hawking reportedly called the idea ""trivially true"" (even though he's reluctant to speak on the subject).. In this sense a measurement is not some physical event. It's a change of your personal subjective experience.   Regarding your questions,  A)  Since I don't think there's anything as measurements, the question is what makes the interference pattern disappear. The answer is anything that interacts with the particle going through. I'm not sure what you mean by ""how"" things interact. They just do according to our laws of physics. If you're asking experimentally, I'm certainly not your guy.  B)  Again, I'm not sure what you mean by ""how"" they interact. We've observed the fact that things interact and we've written that down in our laws of physics. We don't really have a how or why.   C)  A particle, or wave (same thing) is not simply a probability distribution. A wave has an amplitude at any point in space. This amplitude can be positive or negative. A positive part of the wave hitting a negative part, they'll cancel out. This is extremely similar to watching water waves going through two slits.  D)  Here's a simple and non-controversial answer. The very clear answer anyone would agree upon is that it does not matter if anyone reads the ""measurement device"". The interference pattern is gone. Consciousness is not a relevant subject to the actual physical effects of an experiment. A single elementary particle can prevent the interference pattern.   Hope anything made sense."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cka1h,The_Serious_Account,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"To add to already thorough answers here, I want to expand on something which will likely make things more interesting, but more confusing. In regards to (A) and (B):  Measuring an electron's path (e.g. which slit it was located at) is difficult as already discussed. My first understanding of why interference patterns appear/disappear presuming one could definitely indicate ""which slit"" was precisely because (B)- to find the electron, generally you smack it with a photon and that... does something bad and kills the interference.  If you will let me use light instead, it is conceptually easy to get the ""which slit"" information. The trick is that certain atomic transition require the emission of two photons to occur (as opposed to just one). This means, if you can take two sets of substrate, excite them appropriately (with heat or bathing in a particular light), you will occasionally get these transitions (at particular frequencies, which is important so you can tell which events you care about). This is analogous to the two-slit experiment in every way- if which slit emitted the photon is ""unmeasured"" you should get the the interference pattern.  Now, if one photon is propagated forward to develop an interference pattern, while the other goes backward into a detector to tell you which slit the transition came from, you can essentially get the information without ""hitting"" the particle. This still kills the interference pattern. Even better, if it is made to be unknown (removing detectors), you can in a sense re-establish interference. Even better, the interfering photons can be detected on the screen an arbitrary amount of time before determining which slit or ""choosing"" to not measure which slit. If you are particularly daring in understanding this, you would want to look into the quantum eraser and the delayed choice quantum eraser experiments."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cka1h,zenthr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to answer this question, but since I never did this particular experiment myself, my answers may not be complete.  A) I do not believe that electrons are measured ""at the slit"", but if they were, all you would have to do is move whatever device you are using to measure the impact of the electron after traveling through the slit close enough to the slits that no interference  could occur and close enough that you could determine absolutely which electrons traveled through which slits.  B) Your understanding of the observer effect is correct.  When you stick a thermometer in water, you slightly change the temperature of the water (because the thermometer either absorbs or releases a small amount of heat).  At the subatomic level, there is no way to observe the momentum or position of a particle without altering the quantum state of the particle.  Hitting a proton, for instance, with x-rays to measure it, will affect its quantum state.  However, it is important to understand that the observer effect, while originally proposed as part of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, does not actually explain it.  Our best understanding of quantum physics today is that, at the Planck length, things truly exist as indeterminate probability waves and not even ""God"" knows a particle's ""true"" position and momentum.  It's not just an artifact of the observer effect, but a fundamental property of the universe.  C) It is a set of mathematical models that accurately predict the behavior of the quantum world.  If you have not studied differential equations and linear algebra, you'll probably have to just accept that the models make these predictions.  We know they interact ""physically"" by empirical induction.  The models predict how subatomic particles should interact and we observe that they act in such a manner.  The first major step towards understanding this was the Schrodinger Wave Equation.  We currently do not have a ""deeper"" explanation for why the quantum world works the way it does and no real prospects of having one anytime soon.    D) As far as we know, the mere act of measurement forces a probability wave to collapse and a particle to take a definitive state.  A human ""measuring"" it is of no consequence.  Remember, this is a fundamental property of the universe and not explained by the ""observer effect"".  It is explained by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle by forcing a particle to exhibit a definitive momentum or position.  The idea that you need a conscious observer is kind of a new-age pseudoscientific notion.  It is not part of the physics."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cka1h,The_Wisenheimer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"I understand it this way (some may disagree, but whatever):  Being observed is the same as any form of quantum interaction; In other words, measuring a photon is the same as exchanging information with it.  It tells you something about itself and it learns something about the particle you are measuring it with.  The change in your measurement particle is the information provided by the photon.  The photon you measured, now a particle instead of a wave, contains different information than it did before and proceeds through a slit and encounters the wall.  So something is a wave until it encounters something to exchange information with, at which time it becomes a particle with different information.  If a photon is absorbed by an electron, then the emitted photon will act as a wave until it, too, exchanges information with something else.  Unmeasured photons shot through the slit one at a time are waves until they encounter something.  When you add a device to measure the photons going through the slits, you change the wave into a particle and it stays that way, making the interference pattern vanish.  When probability waves interact, they aren't actually doing anything, they only represent the probability that a particle will be found in any given place.  You don't actually see the results of this until the photons bounce off a wall and into your detection equipment or eyes; otherwise, just like we said before, since you can't see the photons in the air, they aren't in any set position.  I'm no physicist, this is just my understanding of it and the details may differ, but it gets the point across I think.  I hope this helps."

I suspected it was the act of measurement (interfering in a physical way) that causes a wave function to collapse.  The idea that a conscious oberserver is needed seems a bit too mystical for me.  I also suspected that some of this was ""shut up, don't ask questions, and do the math"" physics.  I wonder if we simply lack the ability to intuitively understand it.  After all, we didn't evolve to comprehend the very big or the very small."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cka1h,Yogi_DMT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"a) Measurement is the idea of two systems interacting and transferring ""information"" to one another. The specifics aren't really important (i'm guessing they use electron microscopes or something of the sort) but the important part is that when we use measurement to find out which slit the ""particle"" goes through, we are physically altering the system. The act of measurement converts the wave-like system into the familiar particle-like system.  b) Think i answered this with the previous question  c) The truth is ""probability wave"" is, at least in my opinion, a place holder for something we haven't figured out yet. Personally i believe that there is a physical essence to these probabilities, but you're entitled to believe whatever you want. The level of complexity we're dealing with here could be unfathomable. It's hard to give answers when we really don't have a good idea of the scope yet. I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but i encourage you to approach this stuff with an open mind.

Ship's time will be approximately the same as Earth time (about 1.005 times shorter) because that's really not that fast and time dilation is not a big factor until about 0.8 c.  There are two problems though. The first is that the only realistic thing human beings have ever designed that would reach even 10% of the speed of light is Project Orion, which would have used a constant stream of exploding nuclear bombs as fuel for a few weeks to get up to speed. Hypothetical near-future fusion rockets might get to 0.12 c but we haven't invented them yet.  The second problem is that the 0.1 c figure for Orion assumes you save no fuel to slow down. You presumably want to stop at your destination, so you'll need to either accept a drastically lower top speed or find some other way to stop quickly. A large magnetic field would interact with interstellar hydrogen a but like a giant drogue parachute on a drag racer and very rapidly slow it down, although I'm not sure if we could actually make the superconducting cables needed to do this."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cjggo,swordfingers,0,Wed Jul 8 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"Ideally, for a pure substance A, changes in phase occur w/o a change in temperature.   This is because the added energy/heat not longer affects the kinetic energy of the individual molecules (the temperature) but rather affects the potential energy of the individual molecules (the interactions between molecules)  With mixtures (A + B) it becomes more complicated as you are dealing with different heat capacities and different intermolecular interactions to overcome in the phase change (i.e. A-A, A-B, B-B, etc.)   The heterogeneity of the intermolecular interactions can cause a broadening of the phase change over a temperature range.    Overall, this is why you need a pure substance to get an accurate melting point because contaminants ""broaden"" the melting point."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cjggo,practically_sci,-2,Wed Jul 8 12:41:37 2015 UTC,"Melting is not exactly a distinct process and it starts well below the melting point.  For instance a mixture or two compounds, an alloy for example, can melt at a range of temperatures. In this graph an alloy of alpha-beta is shown. Let's say your metal is 30% alpha and 70% beta. For that composition there is a range of temperatures where some of the metal melts but some of the alpha remains solid (alpha+liquid region).  Creep is another phenomenon where melting is not absolute at a singular temperature. Hold any material under a mechanical stress at a higher temperature, but below its melting temperature, and it will strain and then fail in a way unlike if it were stressed at a much lower temperature. Glaciers for instance, are massive and are stressed under their own weight. They are exposed to changing weather patterns near the melting point of ice. What does this cause? Glaciers slowly flow.  The terrorist attack on 9/11 and the ""jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" is an example of creep failure. Burning jet fuel was exposed to the steel I-beams of the World Trade center. This heat near, but not exceeding, the melting point of the steel paired with the added stress of the building damage caused the structure of the buildings to fail.

AskScienceDiscussion,3chip5,remnos,3,Tue Jul 7 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"Imagine a bunch of Jenga blocks arranged in a standard Jenga tower. The tower is a very specific arrangement of blocks -- and up to a permutation of the blocks themselves, there is really only one way to arrange them as a tower. There are billions of ways to arrange them as just a pile of blocks, but only one way to arrange them as a tower.  Now take all of those blocks and put them in a bag, shake it up a bit, and then dump the bag out on the floor randomly. There's nothing in physics that says that they can't drop on the floor in such a way as to bounce off of the floor and each other just right and form a tower. It is not impossible. But you'll never ever see it. Why? The reason is exactly what we just discussed. It could happen, but there's only one way out of billions of ways that it could happen. The number of ways for the blocks to form a pile is just massively larger than the number of ways for the blocks to form a tower, so the probability that you end up with a pile is massively larger than the probability that you end up with a tower. We would say that arrangements that form a pile have high entropy, whereas arrangements that form a tower have low entropy.  And in the universe, stuff is always happening to stuff. Things move, crash into each other, heat up, combine, burn out, react, and the results end up being sort of like kicking that Jenga tower. When you have some low entropy arrangement of molecules, that is, an arrangement that is relatively improbable, eventually something will happen to it, and the resulting arrangement will probably have higher entropy."
AskScienceDiscussion,3chip5,GOD_Over_Djinn,4,Wed Jul 8 12:15:01 2015 UTC,"Here is what I think it means: Increasing entropy, in physics, means that thermal energy within the system progressively has less order and more randomness.   No, that's not right. Entropy in physics has a specific mathematical definition. The English words ""less order and more randomness"" are just an informal description. If you interpret these words in a different way than the interpretation which matches the technical definition, you're no longer talking about entropy.   I believe the explanation for this is simply - the universe is getting bigger.   That's not right either. Entropy tends to increase even in a closed system of a fixed size."

Entropy does not have a universal definition, it's only defined in specific contexts. For example, thermodynamic entropy is only well defined for systems in equilibrium, which do not exist in practice. It cannot be completely defined in terms of randomness, an objective measure of randomness is uncomputable. What appears random in one language can contain lots of information in another."
AskScienceDiscussion,3chip5,dsws2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"thermodynamic entropy is only well defined for systems in equilibrium   If I understand correctly, entropy is defined whenever properties like temperature and pressure are defined everywhere.  There are far-from-equilibrium states where those don't make sense, so definitions often say that they're defined only at equilibrium.  But as long as the system can be divided into finitely many components, each of which is at equilibrium, thermodynamic quantities will be defined for each of them, and entropy can be calculated for the whole system."
AskScienceDiscussion,3chip5,dsws2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:49:47 2015 UTC,"As with the rest of thermodynamics, there are two ways of thinking of entropy: heat flows, and statistical mechanics.  Entropy is the degree to which heat is in low-temperature reservoirs.  Or entropy is when there are lots of micro-states (ways individual atoms might be located and moving) for the macro-state (the way things are at an observable scale, attributes like temperature and pressure)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3chip5,BitOBear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:44:53 2015 UTC,"I'll try to split the difference between accessible and formal definitions. (e.g. here is a shot at a word-picture of the ideas. I'm sure some will have problems with some of it, particularly the parts I over-simplify by a huge amount, but think of this as poetry of ideas not the exactitude of mathematical qualification. 8-)  If I make a closed box and enclosed in that box I have an alcohol lamp on one side and a block of ice in the other, the box is ""well sorted"" and there is a lot of difference in the energetic potential. This is a ""low entropy state"" not because the flame is hot nor because the ice is cold, but because the energy in the various places is well defined and discrete.  The heat from the lamp is going to melt the ice. The ice may all melt first, or the lamp might run out of alcohol or oxygen. Now there is less difference in potential, and ""more entropy"". The absolute contents and size of the box didn't change at all. There are still the same number of each kind of atom. but now there is less O2, and less alcohol, and more CO2, and while there is the same amount of H2O it's not all locked together as ice, now a bunch of it is hanging out in the loose association we know as liquid water and some more of it might even be hanging out in the enclosed space as gaseous water vapor.  Once the flame goes out and the melts as much as it's going to from that heat the whole box will reach the same temperature as heat normalizes.  Now if the box is a perfect insulator, a perfectly closed system, the entropy is now fairly high, but it's not total.  Molecules themselves have potential energy that is part of their makeup. The very reason alcohol can burn is that it is sort of wound like a spring. The positions and kinds of atoms and how they are stuck together contain potential energy. And in this box there's the wick and the brass and the glass and if we could watch long enough all that stuff would very slowly break apart into new molecules with lower and lower energy. The alcohol would go first because its more volatile than the wick or the brass or the glass. I'm not enough of a chemist to tell you what would break down and recombine with what. And it would take a very long time, potentially measured in units of lifetimes. But it would happen.  So the game of entropy is really a game of trades. Something with more energy gives some up and something with less energy gets a little more energy, but not quite as much as the first thing gave up.  And in that trade of energy both the giver and receiver change in some way, and the giver changes more than the receiver because giving and receiving both ""cost a little"". So a rubber ball falls from a great height. On impact the velocity of the ball (a form of kinetic energy) becomes a distortion of the ball (a form of potential energy), the ball doesn't like being distorted so it springs back into shape which causes the ball to spring up from the ground (back to kinetic energy). And the ground took a little bit of a pounding (typically heat, but balls hitting soft surfaces also make craters or move bits of junk). So each of these changes in shape and velocity ""lost a little energy"". But since energy is never created or destroyed. What all of it really did was lose the use of energy, or the ""usefulness"" of the energy the whole system has.  Fusion in the sun makes photons. Photons rain down on earth and plants catch some and use that energy to cram carbon dioxide and water into little bundles called sugars. Those sugars float around until they encounter something that uses that molecular spring to make ADP into ATP, which then powers the machinery of the cell. That cell may be the plant cell, or it may be one of your cells because you ate the plant.  So energy flows through a system by leaving the places where there is a lot and entering places where there is not a lot.  But as the total difference between ""most energy"" and ""least energy"" spots gets closer the speed and frequency of the trades slows down.  Well it turns out that even the energy that holds sub-atomic particles together into atomic particles counts. As the universe gets ""more even"" and the burning and the exploding and the growing of plants and the bright lights all stop, the individual particles will start giving up their ""stuck-together-ness"" energy and the very particles of matter will be the bright spots and the places were nothing is will be the cold spots that get a new sub-atomic particle. Then those will be the bright spots and so on.  So you should think about entropy like you think about the word ""fairness"". We will only reach ""absolute fairness"" when absolutely everyone and everything has the absolutely identical stuff.  We will only reach absolute entropy when every cubic volume of space has absolutely nothing to give up because they are all absolutely identical. This is the ""heat death"" of the universe because whatever is there is a final product with no chance of being warmed even slightly above its current level ever again. ever. and all that there remains is useless identical heat energy uniformly spread through every volume of space no matter how you slice it up.  So high entropy is sort of high fairness, and low entropy is the name for high potential to gain or lose energy.  So it needed its own words but entropy isn't a thing the way a ball is a thing, it's the degree to which a volume of space, e.g. ""system"", has become balanced in all forms of potential and kinetic energy.  Another way to look at ""heat death"" is that all of the energy in the universe is spread out fairly as pure heat. Everything everywhere isn't even recognizably ""a thing"" any more and there is this very even, very cold, perfectly fair distribution of ""heat energy"". This is the moment of maximum entropy as there is a lot of nothing, and all that nothing is identically cold and still.  The more entropy a system has the less it possesses the ability to change itself in any way."

I suggest reading Sean Carroll's book ""From Eternity to Here"" for lots of in-depth discussions on entropy as it pertains to statistical mechanics and information theory.  I will try my best to articulate my best definition.  In a short, general definition of entropy I would describe it as the measure of disorder.  There are (many many) more ways for a system to be considered disorderly than orderly (the Jenga example by /u/GOD_Over_Djinn is a fantastic metaphor).  A common example is with an egg, it's relatively easy to make a scrambled egg but near impossible to take a scrambled egg and reconstruct an intact egg.    It all boils down to energy.  More (useful) energy means more heat, means more molecular (kinetic) energy.  Without external energy, a system will tend towards equilibrium.  Molecules will slow down, objects will cool, eggs will break and go rotten.  Entropy in this sense is then the measure of useless energy or energy lost.    Another useful definition is ""the number of microstate arrangements which can be made which don't affect the macrostate.""  In other words, how many ways can the 'internals' of something be scrambled for the something to still have the same apparence/function.  This is not as intuitive and requires subjective definitions of what a macrostate is."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cg6cu,perryurban,2,Tue Jul 7 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"You can separate it once or twice, but you really don't see identical quadurplets very often.  If you look at the early development pictures and movies you'll see the problem quickly... The human egg is huge and while it divides those first however-many times it's total volume remains fixed because it has no means of taking in nutrients.  So there is a race between volume and cell count while the egg strives for viability. If it doesn't develop a rudimentary means of acquiring and distributing fuel and oxidizer it will die.  The egg has enough energy and mass to do that once with reasonable cerianty. Some germ lines it's got enough to do it twice if it must. And three times isn't unheard of though that's probably a single division into equal thirds...  But after that the probably of reaching sufficient complexity once the total energy and mass has been spread that far out is ""highly unlikely"".  Now if you had the means to keep replenishing the cell plasma you could likely get a hundred or more duplicates. My (admittedly limited) understanding from things like the two-headed fly experiments is that inter-cellular signaling is hugely significant in the eventual differentiation of cells. If you are separating the cells as soon as they divide then they won't begin specialization. Least that's what I'd expect from what I've read.

AskScienceDiscussion,3ceb9i,Squiiidzoid,14,Tue Jul 7 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to answer your questions seriously because when I was first learning this stuff, I always found it discouraging that people met my out-of-the-box/trying-to-learn-by-postulating usually with arrogance and that frustrated me. You seem to have put some thought into this so I will do you the courtesy of answering you seriously, and I expect you to return it by learning and giving up on the notion that you can reverse the laws of the universe.   However, since it has no electrons, there are no electrons to rise in energy levels due to the added heat energy, and then lower in energy levels to emit the heat as photons. Therefore the protonium would be able to take in heat energy from photons, but not re-emit them. This means ambient heat photons from the nearby environment would go into this glass ball, travel through the vacuum, reach the protonium, collide with and be absorbed by the nucleus, heating it up.    First of all, protonium is a real thing that is a proton orbited by an antiproton, so don't use that to name your substance. Protons just on their own... well all that is is a hydrogen atom that has its electron ionized. You may have seen this in high school chemistry as H+ , or just ""hydrogen ion""... and it's important for a lot  of stuff in chemistry and biology. For the sake of making this less magical, let's assume you have you have a gas of hydrogen ions, and you somehow chemically insulate it so it doesn't automatically react with literally almost anything in the lab that has an electron. So based on your experiment, let's place it in a vacuum and bind it with ""magnets"", and then let's bombard it with photons.   The gas should ""heat up"" in the sense that the total kinetic energy on average for all of the molecules in your gas increases, as you predicted... but this heat doesn't get trapped. Instead, like all vibrating and colliding charges, the electric and the magnetic fields created by these moving charges creates... more photons, since the force carrying particle for the electromagnetic field is the photon. You would very quickly start to see your H+ gas start to glow, meaning it is giving off and losing energy. You leave this in the vacuum for long enough, and the gas would eventually cool down. This is the concept behind black-body radiation. So that idea is bust, sorry.    Since objects become heavier when they are hotter because objects weigh more when they move faster, the battery will be heavier once it has heated up. The pulley system will then lower it back down all the way onto the piston again, turning a turbine on the pulley system to convert the gravitational potential energy into electricity. The battery would then re-absorb the heat, converting it back into stored chemical energy, and therefore becoming lighter again.   All of this sounds great, and it's actually quite easy to come up with a theoretical system that can run for an infinitely long time. There are two main problems though: the first is that the only energy you will get out of this system is the energy you externally placed into it by lifting the weight originally in the gravitational potential. You won't get any more. All the energy conversion back and forth is that same energy. It would be like pouring the same amount of water into different cups, back and forth, you never create any more water in that closed system. The second issue is that it's fundamental in thermodynamics that no system transfers energy perfectly, and so there is always a limit to how efficiently you can convert energy. This means, over time, enough water will spill out of your cups as you pour it back and forth that eventually your cups will all be empty. This is taught usually in Physics I with heat machines, carnot cycles, etc... So that idea is bust as well. These pulley systems are the most typical perpetual motion machines you hear about, and they are usually a tell-tale that you're dealing with someone who is a quack. Of all your ideas, remove this one from your mind with utmost urgency. Also, objects don't weigh more when they move faster, that's a common misconception. Things like a hot beaker or a compressed spring will weigh more (to a very, very, very small degree) because there is more energy in that ""space"" regardless of your reference frame. You would be very hard pressed to be able to measure this though unless you were dealing with immense energy scales.    So first, you get a very large amount of electricity. High up, you use a particle accelerator/ hadron collider/ similar device to convert that energy into atoms, for example water(just an example, you could use another liquid or gas using water turbines, or a solid using a pulley system). This would give you equal amounts of water and anti-water. You then have the water and anti-water fall a great height through two separate tubes with a vacuum inside.    So in particle accelerators, you just don't create equal amounts of molecule A and anti-matter molecule A... it all depends on the energy being used and the entropy of the system that determines the probability of what the resulting particles are (think of a pair of dice and their addition as different energy states. The most common energy state is 7 since it's the number that the two dice most commonly adds up to.)   The way this machine is creating energy, is because the light is not using up energy to gain height, and so since it gets converted to matter at the top, it is ""smuggling"" gravitational potential energy up to the top, where, when converted into solid matter that weighs something, that ""free height"" can be converted into electricity,    Unfortunately for this idea, light does lose energy when climbing out of high-energy gravitational potential wells. In particular, we see a red shift (as it is losing energy), so eventually, assuming we had a magical supply of water and ""anti-water"", the light you're using to create it would lose energy. This one also falls under the same ""pulley-system"" tell-tale, but I've already pointed out the flaws in that.    This energy generating machine is a bit more theoretical, as it involves using wormholes. However, most scientists believe that wormholes are possible and that humans could create them with future technology, including Albert Einstein. This would have to be on a planet or something similar, as it requires a gravity source below it, preferably a strong one. First, you get two wormholes, one above the other. You then contain them in a tube connecting them, sealed off at both ends.    Now you're thinking with portals! So, wormholes are tricky because they do allow for a lot of tomfoolery with the laws of physics. People like Stephen Hawking take the very fact that wormholes, as you've posited them, do mess with the laws of physics as an indication that they therefore can't exist, or if they do, it's on a quantum scale that doesn't allow them to fuck with the macro thermodynamic/energy conservation laws we know universe runs on. Aside from this, the idea is solid, but again so hypothetical and breaks so many rules that very few scientists take such ""bridges"" as anything more that strange mathematical solutions that appear in the incomplete equations of general relativity (incomplete because they are not compatible with quantum physics as of right now).    This idea is an energy generating machine that uses the Doppler Effect[3] . When a photon is absorbed by you, it has a certain amount of energy in it, depending on it's wavelength. If you are moving extremely fast towards that same photon when you absorb it, it will seem to have a much smaller wavelength, and therefore much more energy, even though less energy was used when it was emitted. This appears to be a clear gain in energy.    You're right! Unfortunately, the gain in the photon's energy is equivalent to the amount of energy you put into your own acceleration in order to ""blue shift"" the light and create the doppler effect. So, no free energy unfortunately. Second, photons exert pressure when they are absorbed, and twice as much pressure when they are reflected! This means that the part of the wheel the laser is pointed at will eventually slow down because they are moving in opposite directions of each other. Only if you had a perfectly efficient solar panel that absorbed all light and converted that energy back into electricity to spin the wheel, would you have a wheel that wouldn't slow down... however notice how I'm saying it would speed up either. In fact the maximum effect you could achieve would be to keep the wheel spinning as fast as it originally did by having a solar panel that was 100% efficient and was used to counteract the photons slowing the wheel down.   I hope that answered some of your questions. Overall, it's good that you're thinking about these things but you could really benefit from taking some physics courses at your local college (or change majors if you already are at college), as many of the pitfalls in your plan are simply misunderstandings of freshman, Physics I material.  There's no shame in this, as material can be learned and bad habits forgotten. Keep the inquisitive nature of questioning how things work and how to manipulate them creatively as it will benefit you in coming up with original stuff once you begin to learn more about physics... however, I would suggest you give up on the idea that you can use pulley systems to create free energy, or free energy at all through any system.   Let me know if you have any other questions."
AskScienceDiscussion,3ceb9i,babeltoothe,11,Tue Jul 7 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"In general, the laws of thermodynamics are hard to break. While I can see you've put a lot of thought into these, I can see a few issues with each of them.   If a proton absorbs a photon of light, it can re-emit it all on its own. It doesn't need electrons to do this at all. Even if you could isolate protons, they would just radiate away the energy. I'm having a very hard time picturing the set-up you're imagining here, and how it's supposed to work. I suspect the problem might be when you claim the battery will re-absorb the heat (once something heats up, that heat will be spread evenly throughout the whole system), but I can't say for sure without understanding your idea. Ignoring the huge and inevitable losses of energy, the issue here is that all forms of potential energy (including gravitational potential energy) are included in the rest mass of an object. Therefore, the energy needed to make some mass of matter+antimatter at the top of the tubes is actually larger than the amount of energy you'll get out by recombining them on the bottom (now that I think about it, this may be a problem with the previous idea as well). In fact, unless I'm missing something, it should be larger by exactly the amount of energy you can extract from the water falling. Your set-up is just a very roundabout way of converting some of the rest-mass energy of water into electricity. I don't know much about the mechanics of wormholes, so someone else will have to explain whether or not your idea will work (the wormholes do have their own gravity, which might mess with things). However, I will point out that as far as I know, most scientists nowdays think wormholes are not actually possible regardless. There may be another issue I'm overlooking here, but one thing to consider is radiation pressure. Every time a solar panel absorbs a photon, it will be pushed backwards slightly, slowing down the flywheel. This requires a constant energy input to keep the flywheel moving, which I suspect would offset the small gain in energy you get from the doppler effect (keeping in mind that the momentum of a photon is E/c, so the more energy you try to get out of the doppler effect, the more radiation pressure you'll have to deal with)."

With Yellowstone the volcano is fed by a very large and complex magma plumbing system, which may or may not be well connected. So even if you trigger an eruption the chances are you would only trigger a small event (most Yellowstone eruptions have been small events, not super eruptions).

AskScienceDiscussion,3cdyjg,OrbitalPete,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:08 2015 UTC,What if someone drilled down to the chamber? I assume the pressure would push magma up and out. Would that hole widen and become a problem?
AskScienceDiscussion,3cdyjg,spazmodic-,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"It would ""lance the boil"" more than cause an eruption.  But one would be hard pressed to drill that hole what with the heat and the distance and all. We don't currently have the technology to do  that.  Even if we did have the materials science to turn a shaft that's several kilometers long without that shaft twisting into a knot, and we had the ability to pump in the lubricating slurry and pump out the displaced material...  The side-in pressure of the rock and the likely micro-fractures would grab the shaft toote-suite.  Then we'd reach the heat sufficent to boil and harden the slurry like concrete.  Then we'd reach the layers where the rock, already plastic form the pressure, is hot enough to bulge when its neighbor rock was removed.  And there's a reason we melt metals in ceramic vessels instead of melting rock in metal pans, so long before we got to any magma the drill would melt and the hole would collapse for countless causes.  So no, no drilling and no explosions are going to trigger a super eruption.  There is only one known technology that could do it, and that would be super-orbital bombardment. You'd need a really massive ship (or a large facility built on the moon) and a really long and fast accelerator and good aim to puncture a chasm that deep. You'd need a projectile about the size of a very tall building and the means to move it really fast. We have none of that technology, but we know how it could be done.  Meanwhile, since you'd be delivering all that energy downward you've got a non-trivial chance of nerfing the ""supervolcano"" anyway. you'd be applying a pressure in opposition and crushing the channels from which the pressure was supposed to erupt.  But frankly if you've got that kind of super-orbital bombardment platform you don't need the supervolcano because you can already do that kind of damage at will."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cdyjg,dsws2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"What makes a volcano erupt is that denser stuff (relatively cool rock) is on top of less-dense stuff (magma, aqueous fluids*), so the light stuff percolates upward and the denser stuff settles to fill in where it was.  Setting off an explosion on top isn't going to speed that up a whole lot.  What makes an eruption explosive is the fluids.  They expand when the pressure is off.  The shock wave of an explosion is neither going to increase the amount of gas, nor decrease the pressure.  If an explosion made a big enough hole, there would be less rock above the fluid, so the pressure would be less.  But as /u/OrbitalPete says, the magma chambers are kilometers down.  So to make a substantial difference in that, we would be talking about blasting away many meters of rock, over an area of many square kilometers.  With an explosion big enough to do that, you wouldn't need the eruption.  *The reason I say ""aqueous fluid"" instead of ""water"" or ""liquid"" is that it has lots of other stuff in it besides water, particularly CO2 and other substances we think of as gases.  And rather than being either a liquid or gas, it's at high enough pressure that the distinction between liquid and gas doesn't apply.  The proper term is ""supercritical fluid""."
AskScienceDiscussion,3cb773,rsnellings25,32,Mon Jul 6 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"So, there are 3 major factors involved with this situation: acceleration because of gravity, terminal velocity, as well as conservation of momentum.     according to http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/antmanii.htm ant mans mass is not compressed when he changes sizes. so, lets assume this means his mass is reduced to that of an ant when he shrinks.   Ant man leaps from an airplane, and shrinks.  the terminal velocity of an ant is ~ 1.77777 m/s. so, assuming he jumped from an airplane crusing at 30,000 ft ( 9144 m), he would fall for a little less than an hour and a half. that's quite the long fall.  if he didnt grow, he would impact with a force of .0000213 Newtons ( assuming he decellerates over half a second) or .00000002 G. easily survivable for both an ant and a human.  if he re-grew right before impact, his momentum would be 0.00000533331 kg*m/s ( the same as a falling ant. ) before and after growing ( conservation of momentum ). so his V would reduce as his mass increases. meaning when he re-grows, his velocity is VASTLY diminished.   lets assume he's a 70 kg man. meaning his velocity would go from 1.7 m/s to just .0000000761901 m/s. he slowed down, but his mass increased as V decreased: giving us the same momentum, and therefore the same impact force assuming a half second of deceleration: .0000213 Newtons or .00000002 G. easily survivable  if he re-grew 2 meters above the ground, however, he would continue to fall. since humans have a higher terminal velocity than ants, he would begin to accelerate towards his new tV as soon as he re-grew.  at 2 meters above the ground, he would add 6.26 m/s to his falling V before impact, making the final V  7.96 m/s. assuming a half second of deceleration, the force of the impact would be 2228.8 Newtons or 2.8 G. again, easily survivable.  if he re-grew at 4 m above the ground, he would impact at 10.628 m/s or 2975.84 Newtons, or 3.795 G. again, easily survivable.  at 10 m, he would impact at 15.777778 m.s or 4417.7777 Newtons or 5.6 G. now, this is painful, and he certainly would be injured re-growing at this height..but it is certainly survivable.  so...TLDR: he would survive no-matter what if he did-not re-grow because of his small terminal velocity. and if he re-grew...survivability varies almost entirely on how high up he is when he re-grows because of the higher terminal velocity of humans.   some sources on fatal g forces on people:  http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/YuriyRafailov.shtml  edit:a thought to chew on..if he fell as a man, and shrank right before impact, because of conservation of momentum, he would accelerate to close to the speed of a bullet starship enterprise.   so because of this, if he re grew 100m from the ground, then, realizing he was going to die, shrank to an ant in an attempt to survive 10 m above the ground....he would accelerate to 98,000,000,000 m/s or 326 times the speed of light.  42.00 m/s (speed from dropping 90 m)              70kg (his mass as a man)                       =  2940 kg*m/s (his momentum) V (resulting speed)  3mg (his mass as an ant)          = 294000000000 mg*m/s (his momentum)  294000000000mg*m/s /3mg =V(re-arranged)  V=98,000,000,000 m/s (his resulting velocity)   so...probably a bad day for him. but the impact with earth wouldnt kill him...  the marvel dictionary says it takes him about 2 seconds to morph from ant to man and vice-versa.  accelerating to 326C-- or ""warp 3""-- in 2 seconds purely by accident would surely rip him, and the suit, to shreds in a long, thin trail of atomic vapor along his general direction of travel."

Within some problem domain, the amount of energy remains constant and energy is neither created nor destroyed. Energy can be converted from one form to another (potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy) but the total energy within the domain remains fixed.   he can gain mass,  but he cannot gain (create) energy from nothing. the ant-man lore says that his mass--and very specifically just his mass-- comes and goes into an alternate dimension...whatever that means. point is, it's outside this system entirely until the suit brings it back. it actually makes for a really interesting thought experiment.  edit:  from my earlier post:   a thought to chew on..if he fell as a man, and shrank right before impact, because of conservation of momentum, he would accelerate to close to the speed of a bullet starship.    because of conservation of energy, the same amount of energy-- applied to a much smaller amount of mass-- means a much greater velocity."

AskScienceDiscussion,3cb773,Galerant,3,Mon Jul 6 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"Conservation of momentum (which is the basis for action/reaction) is the basic way that rockets work.  Throw something with small mass at a high speed in one direction, and you start moving at a slow speed in the opposite direction.  However, if you mean purely by change in mass, then there is none because of conservation of matter; the mass of an object moving at a fixed velocity doesn't change, and so you'd never see it accelerate purely due to a change in mass in real life.  However, an analogous situation can be seen through conservation of angular momentum, which is based on moment of inertia and angular speed instead of mass and velocity.  Since moment of inertia depends on shape as much as mass, if you start something spinning and contract its mass towards its axis of rotation, its angular velocity will increase.  For example, an ice skater pulling their arms in will start to spin much faster due to the change in their moment of inertia."

Engine generator to motor drive of some extremely heavy mining and construction equipment is also used.
AskScienceDiscussion,3cbw4x,DonQuixBalls,2,Mon Jul 6 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"People have built autonomous combat robots before - the old Battlebots rules had a weight allowance for autonomous bots, if I recall correctly. I don't think they've ever been particularly-competitive in Battlebots, though.  There are the sumobots, in the various academic robotics competitions, of course. They're smaller, slower, and cheaper than the Battlebots classes, though.  Given the rather punishing environment in Battlebots, it's difficult to see how you'd justify including delicate sensors and a control system in something that's going to get hit with a lawnmower blade or a pickaxe.  The combination of a human as sensors/aiming, and some amount of autonomous control (e.g. to automatically hammer anything that gets into range) is going to be pretty unbeatable under the current rules.  You could do an autonomous-only competition now, under different rules, but I don't know that it'd be as/more exciting than the current Battlebots.

AskScienceDiscussion,3calht,IMoustacheYou,6,Mon Jul 6 12:11:43 2015 UTC,"Two theories.  The first one, and the one Occam and I are willing to bet money on, is that you are sleeping a lot more than normal, which means REM sleep (and less of a need for you to have long slumbers) making it more likely for you to wake up during REM sleep causing you to remember more dreams.    The second, and the two theories could work in conjunction, is about the more thinking throughout the day. One of the functions people believe dreams to have, is to consolidate your memory by firing together the stimuli you experience today with other memories you've experienced.  The firing of neurons (brain cells) together strengthens it and consolidate the memory.  And then your brain weaves a story together for a bunch of random events and boom you have a dream.   Thoughts in your brain are just auditory stimuli (or visual if you think that way) from your brain.  And so increase in thoughts could lead to more stimuli that need to be consolidated, and your brain might be trying to pair visual memory with it, the randomness of this gives way to crazy dreams that your brain interprets as a story.  Unfortunately we don't know that much about dreams to give this theory weight.  TLDR: More sleep, so more dreams."

It has about the same magnetic output per unit volume of a bowl of cheerios.  Gravity also can not be ""aimed"". The entire mass of the earth/moon system is constant with reference to the sun. Balance a butter knife on your finger. Does it get ""heavier"" if you point it in different driections? No it doesn't. That's because the total mass of the knife doesn't change.  Same deal for the positions of the sun and moon and the earth. The ""alignment"" of moon and sun on opposite sides of the earth affects the tides by a little, but who cares.

Nothing, is the absence of something, and negative is the opposite of something. When something is combined with the negative of that thing, they cancel each other out, and in the case of physics they release energy in the process. when something is combined with another of that thing, you get twice as much of that thing. So by logic, when something is combined with nothing, there is no change, and the same goes for a negative something being combined with nothing. This can all be proved mathematically, as  +1  +  +1  =  +2, and  -1  +  -1  =  -2, and  +1  +  -1  =  0, and  +1  +  0  =  +1, and  1  +  0  =  -1, and  0  +  0  =  0   .

Our consciousness is constructed by our brains, it is not some permeating force, it is done by the computers that are our brains understanding their surroundings. Self-consciousness is a higher level of consciousness, in which you understand that you are conscious, and can for example ask ""why am I conscious"", instead of what a conscious but not self conscious creature, for example an insect, that could be conscious of the fact that there is an apple near it, but not about the fact that it is conscious. A lack of something cannot have consciousness, however negative something can have consciousness along with a positive something.

It's just that it has lost ""communication"" with macro-organism to understand that its unfettered growth will cause the macro-organism and itself to eventually die.  That's why normal cells can undergo apoptosis, they will die so the macro-organism can live, reproduce, and in a future generation make more those cells.    And to answer your question more directly, no."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c9ym1,AdaKaleh,2,Mon Jul 6 14:41:11 2015 UTC,"To sort of put everything here together.       Evolutionarilly cancers are sometimes used in the description of the selfish gene theory. That idea supposes that genes want to copy themselves and will do so in the best way possible for themselves and everything else can go jump off a bridge. In the case of a tumor the genes have gone full-selfish. The normal mechanisms that regulate cell division have failed and the genes are replicating as fast as possible. This makes the genes happy, they get to copy themselves. But it's going to kill the individual, so in this case the selfish gene is copying itself right out of the gene pool.      Why this has stuck around is a failure of selection post reproduction. Anything that happens after reproduction is invisible to selection, so it can't be weeded out of the population. Since cancers tend to strike older people -- people who've already reproduced -- selection is blind to most cancers.      So it's the failure of regulatory mechanisms that allow the genes to replicate at their preferred rate. And it's still around because selection can't see it, so it can't be removed by evolution."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c9ym1,AnecdotallyExtant,0,Tue Jul 7 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"I guess one could argue that unfettered growth could mean more genes will survive, which is always desired.   So if you think of it in terms of genes and not an individual, and if those cells could survive without the individual, their continuous growth and division could work.   This obviously does not happen in real life."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c7650,puritywolf,9,Sun Jul 5 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"I worked in a RNA biochemistry lab for the past year and a half while doing research for my BSc Thesis, so this will be written from the perspective of a molecular biology lab.  What you do on any given day varies greatly depending on what experiments you plan and what duties you have on the side. Sometimes you'll have only 3-4 hours of actual experimental work, while on other days the experimental setup or your own curiosity will force you to stay up to 12 hours or more (of course not non-stop). If your lab isn't the richest you'll likely also have some ""chores"" to do in the spare time (e.g. when you are waiting for an experiment to finish). This really depends on how many technicians you can afford (and it makes a huge difference).  A typical day in my case would consist of me coming in, taking care of quick tasks first, such as simple cloning tasks (preparing expression plasmids for our model organism containing certain genes or gene fragments). Those tasks often require overnight incubations, so I'd start and finish my day with this stuff. After that I'd either take care of my cells in cell culture or start lysing a batch of cells to do experiments on. While my experiments (pull-downs, westerns, RNA/DNA-gels, simple SDS-PAGES) are running I'd do chores, like filling pipette tips into boxes (easily the most annoying part of working in a poor lab). At the end of the day I would finish up my cloning tasks and clean up my lab space.  This is of course very vague. The work is so diverse that you can't really write down an average daily schedule. I was lucky to be working in a lab with access to a diverse set of instruments, which I all utilized in one or another way, like for example, a laser scanning microscope, a mass-spectrometer, ultracentrifuges, facilities for work with radioactive isotopes etc. This is specifically one of the things I liked the most about my workplace, as compared to other, more traditional cell biology or biochemistry labs. There was a relative diversity in methods we applied, so it wasn't always the same thing.  Challenging to some might be the persistence needed when you go about your research as it will not always yield good results immediately. That's what you're always told by your professors, but I didn't really thought about how shitty it can feel until it happened to myself. You kind of have to get over it and move on I guess. Eventually you'll find something if you invest enough time (yeah, it will most likely eat up a lot of your otherwise free time if you want to have amazing results). This shouldn't discourage you though! Working in a research lab is amazing and I'm glad I chose to do it.    EDIT: Reading back over it this is petty vague I guess so here is a list of things you'd probably do in a lab similar to mine:  Experimental (60 percent of the day):     molecular cloning   protein/DNA/RNA putrificactions   protein mass spectrometry   western/northern/southern blots   immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy   Chores (15 percent of the day):     restocking common media, solutions   ordering chemicals    cleaning   preparing commonly used equipment     Preparation and documentation (25 percent of the day):     documenting results in writing and on the computer   data analysis on the computer   planning of experiments     EDIT2: Another important point I forgot to mention is the nature of the actual work. I think it's important to realize that somebody working in a lab doesn't have to be a genius, and somebody who is a great scientist doesn't necessarily have the best practical skill (albeit many do). Working in the lab is very much a craft. You have to learn how to use the tools and success in practical work comes with experience and through trial and error. The more intellectually demanding part is planning the experiments. This requires creativity and knowledge. Merely doing laboratory work doesn't really require that."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c7650,lemrez,2,Sun Jul 5 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"In physics, day to day can vary quite a bit. There is experiment / equipment design, construction, taking data, and analysis. As an undergrad I worked in a laboratory which studied ultracold molecules, and build electronics and optics. Some days I spent working in my notebook, designing circuits, looking up information to help with this. Then came construction of a prototype with lots of wires and parts and soldering, sort of like legos. Back to the notebook to change some things, more construction. Then ordering parts and construction of the final product. I also spent some days in the machine shop constructing a box w/ knobs and buttons for it.  I also did optics work, which had a similar process, but also had some days reading physics papers, time spent talking to companies to order advanced optic parts, a lot more machine shop work. I had interesting challenges such as my plans were incomplete, I ran out of materials, screwed up the machine cuts at one point, and how to glue different parts together cleanly.  The grad students also did stuff like this with various aspects of the experiment, but also spent days taking data, spent a lot of time upkeeping the equipment since it would break/get out of alignment a lot, and then had to do computer programming to analyze the data (and write up the results). Sometimes people made computer programs to automate various processes."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c7650,my_coding_account,2,Sun Jul 5 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"I've been working in a materials science lab for the past year and a half, and honestly, it's a lot of waiting. A lot of the equipment is automated and the amount of analysis that has to be performed is significantly less than... say chemistry. We don't have to mix hundreds of solutions for GC or LC, create standards for spectroscopy, or really anyting like that.  Our bread and butter (mostly metallurgy) is with furnaces (hands off), arc melting and other sample-creation devices (mostly hand on), SEM, TEM, and Atom Probe (very hands on), XRD (hands off), polishing (hands on), and mechanical testing (set up intensive, but mostly hands off).  Honsetly, the vast majority of the time spent in the lab is reading, data analysis, or just waiting. The most labor intensive things that I do are running the SEM and creating samples for TEM and atom probe with a dual beam SEM/FIB (which can literally take 2+ hours for one sample).   My lab, especially, relies heavily on equipment. If something is down, a lot of the work may stop. For example, currently my group's SEM is down, so a lot of my work is on hold (need it for backscatter diffraction). I also need to perform routine maintainence on deposition machines and our wire EDM (cuts samples).  On a typical day, I get one or two things done. There really isn't a real rush or tsunami of stuff to do right away. Because my samples are (for the most part) inert, I can afford to spend time on it. My past weeks have looked like this:  Monday:    Alloy powders for use in LENS and put it on rollers for 12-18 hours (takes total of an hour or so to mix powders)  Set up LENS parameters in .sli file and make sure all consumables are at proper levels (Argon, regeneration gas, etc). Do any small busywork that needs to be done (polishing, cleaning, calibrating, etc.)    Total time spent: maybe 3-4 hours total work   Tuesday:   Take powders off rollers and place into LENS (~30 minutes) Purge system for 2 hours to ensure low oxygen levels (don't want stuf to oxidize) Trial test run and calibration of flow rates and laser powers (~1 hour) Start deposition (this may take anywhere between 45 minutes to 8 hours, depending on the sample and what you are trying to accomplish). My last deposition took 8.3 hours. The deposition is automated, but I still need to sit there and babysit it to ensure no over or underbuilding as well as monitor other levels. I get a lot of netflix done in this time.     Total time spent: anywhere from 5 hours to 12+ hours   Wednesday:   Take sample out of LENS (I do it wednesday because sample is usually pretty hot and I am too lazy to take it out the same day). Cut sample using EDM (~15-20 minutes) Section sample using EDM (1-2 hours, depending on material, how it needs to be sectioned, and if luck is on my side. Polish samples (~1 hour per sample, usually 2 or 3 samples) and clean (~30 minutes) SEM samples to check polish, EDS composition (this takes usually 30 minutes per sample, as a rough estimate)    Total time spent- usually 4-5 hours   Thursday:   Run XRD (~1 hour per sample and this is completely automated. I let the thing run and go do something else) ??? Data analysis    Total time spent- 1hr or so per sample or region of analysis   Friday:   Further data analysis and potentially other characterizations if the need arises.   In total, time spent doing something on actual equipment is pretty small. Data analysis is simple and doesn't take a lot of time (except for atom probe, which takes hours). Most of the difficulty. If everything works out properly, then... well, you have an easy week. This rarely happens, however.     What do you like/dislike the most about your career   I like that it isn't fast paced. My career (as a grad student, at least) provides me with challenges that I can take my time on. There is plenty of down time (which probably won't continue into the fall semester), and plenty of time to do things simultaneously. I do dislike, however, when equipment is failing, as a great majority of my time is then spent on either waiting, or searching for an alternate solution isntead of actually doing something.   All-in-all, I can honestly say that materials science is pretty relaxed, at least in my avenue. I don't have to worry about samples dying or analyzing fifty different solutions, I don't have to do any intense math or analysis. Most of what I do is automated and it's pretty darn simple to make samples, run equipment (with a few expections), and interpret results.   In another case, a friend of mine made a copper alloy button via arc melting. He spent the next week and a half slowly rolling it into a 0.26mm wire by hand. This took a lot of rolling, pressing, annealing , and more."

Daily work was quite tedious; it generally took about 4 days to prepare a set of samples, so my daily routine started with pushing each set of samples to the next stage and recording the parameters for each set.  After that, I would read a stack of papers that had been published that day and choose which ones were with covering during our Thursday meetings.  After that, if I had any time left, I would brainstorm for alterations to the process or re-read some of the papers I had flagged as important to keep fresh on.    However, through the tedium, I was able to set my own hours, design my own experiments, and basically had full run of the place as an undergraduate.  There were also quite a few interesting engineering challenges that were the real reason I stayed around.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c7650,Nyefan,2,Mon Jul 6 04:48:32 2015 UTC,"I work in industry and it varies. 9/10ths of the labs are essentially a factory production line where you will learn 3-5 skills and do the same thing week in week out. They advertise the positions as requiring a degree but more because they can than it is required.  More interesting is the r&d areas. Here you need to have dozens of skills learnt, but they all essentially boil down to problem solving. I will spend half my day at the lab bench and half the day writing up/designing experiments. Its remained varied and interesting for three years and the nature of modern research means your role last year can require you to do wildly different things than you do now. However there's also some things you could easily spend half an hour a day doing every day for a decade. (Routine maintenance of machines, pipetting doesnt really change no matter what its for).  I think and this has been mentioned by others, the biggest thing most don't realise is how patient you have to be. You can spend years on the same problem. And in the end you still might not understand it. It can be frustrating to come into work every day and not really have the reward of a job well done at the end. I know people who have left just because although they enjoy the variety they can't take the constant 'failure'.  I love it though. I have been lucky enough to work in a lab on and off for over 7 years now and so can't compare it to any other role but when all my friends complain about being at a desk all day, working through their in-tray,  i get to schedule all my own work.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c7650,JacobRiley,2,Mon Jul 6 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'm in bio, but hopefully some of this will translate to other fields depending on your interests. My best advice is to look for a lab where you get along with the people, this will greatly increase your quality of life in lab.  Working in a smaller lab starting out can be a good idea as you'll get to know everyone and you'll have more hands on time with the PI (the professor in charge of the lab).  I would pick a lab that is working on things you're interested in, but honestly you'll learn so much in lab that your opinion of interesting could change dramatically.  So picking a lab with good people who seem invested in their work but also in helping you and respect you as a person is in my opinion more important than the specifics of the work, which depending on what you're working on can change dramatically overnight. When you first start out you'll likely be helping a graduate student or post-doc with their project, that's just how it works and everyone is always so overloaded everyone needs an extra pair of hands.  However, be sure to ask questions about the projects you are doing, whether it be details about experiments themselves or bigger picture questions about the science.  Pride will not help you, asking questions is the best way to learn and shows that you're engaged and interested in what you're doing.  Believe me, everyone notices (in a good way!). I would try to be sure you're going to be able to meet with the professor on a semi-regular basis, and don't be afraid to bounce ideas off them or others in lab, this is how projects get started!  If you don't have a million ideas right away don't stress though, sometimes it takes awhile for them to develop and mature.  And be sure you like what you're doing! Edit: Didn't say anything about challenges, there are many, whether it be monotony of some experiments, failed experiments, negative results, etc. and having a good support structure will help you deal with all these things as well."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c80ui,christino_,2,Sun Jul 5 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"So, a quick search indicates that there are a number of more scientifically oriented books available on the subject:   Dragonflies and Damselflies is about insect models for evolutionary ecology. Model Organisms in Drug Discovery has a pretty self-explanatory title. C. elegans: a Practical Approach probably splits the difference between popular lit and scientific rigor that you desire (and is focused on a fascinating organism). A quite sound series (with which I'm somewhat familiar) begins with Emerging Model Organisms: A Laboratory Manual, Vol 1. I believe there are two books, and they look at recent additions to the model organism 'stable.'    But, you may run into a problem (at least on the Arabidopsis and Neurospora fronts). When it comes to plant and fungal genetics (the areas I'm most familiar with), the gap between 'pop sci' and actual scientific literature can be pretty large. For example, the Pyrenomycetes, the group of Ascomycetes to which the Neurospora spp. belong, is filled with model organisms that can be quite difficult to distinguish by morphology (or even molecular work). Which organisms get used for what purposes, by whom, and where can depend on a large number of factors which aren't necessarily easily enumerated. It's rarely as simple as ""we use this organism because it's the best to study or demonstrate a certain principle.""  For example, S. fimicola is a widely known model organism used in university biology labs to illustrate certain aspects of meiosis and crossing over. With various relatively stable mutations, you can get a really neat effect where the eight ascospores of each asci will be split into two groups of four, each with a different color intensity (so that some appear dark and some light under a scope or in a micrograph).   Pretty cool, right? The problem is, if you go to the literature (or listen to your professor) you are likely to be told that ""S. fimicola is a common dung fungus with a worldwide distribution,"" which is almost the entirety about what is commonly known (or published) on the fungus. You're likely to get a couple of agar recipe suggestions for 'keeping it stable' in culture, and some advice to look for it in herbivore dung if you can't order it from a microbiological supply store.   Fantastic, except all of that 'commonly known' information is largely wrong (or incomplete). S. fimicola almost certainly does not have a cosmopolitan distribution, has several other lifestyles other than as a dung fungus (so it's not an obligate), can be isolated from above and belowground plant tissues (as an endophyte), will happily be a saprophyte, and can even under certain circumstances act as a mild parasite of some plants. Like with most fungi, it's freaking complicated. I only know this because I've spent a significant portion of my research on this fungus ands its lifecycle and ecological roles. There will be a few publications over the next 18 months on the subject, and all of them will highlight how much we don't know about this fungus.  And my point in all this is that it would be very difficult to publish an interesting and comprehensive book on model organisms. Even the ones I've highlighted above are largely laboratory manuals or encyclopedias for researchers. They don't necessarily describe a broad scientific background for an organism. Which makes sense: all the cool stuff I've personally discovered about S. fimicola is more or less completely useless if all you want to do is illustrate crossing over to your 3rd year genetics students. So most work on model organisms focuses on the model bits: basic genetics, cultural techniques, what makes them valuable as models."

So instead of white-tailed deer sized animals, I think OP is talking about the 'thunder lizards', such as brachiosaurus, apatosaurus, and other large 'mega-mega-fauna.   You list 3 large megafauna animals. Here I count 39 species in the macronaria clade, which is just the large long-necked dinosaurs.  Of course, this comparison is a little dumb; we'd have to tally all the known species of the time during and after dinosaurs, and compare all their sizes.   But that's actually not even what OP asked -- he asked about biomass, so in addition to tallying the known species, we'd have to estimate populations and tally their mass to arrive an an estimate of biomass.   While there were many small dinosaurs, I would argue that there was still more biomass in megafauna during the dinosaur times, based on the number of large species we know of."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c7bm9,AnonymousXeroxGuy,3,Sun Jul 5 19:26:01 2015 UTC,Branching off the sciences is mostly important so University department heads can figure out who gets tenure. It's not really super important for anything else.
AskScienceDiscussion,3c7bm9,The_Wisenheimer,2,Sun Jul 5 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Logic and mathematics are their own branches of philosophy.  They do not use the scientific method of empirical induction, although I suppose one could argue science as a philosophy is a subset of logic.    Geography and history are generally considered humanities, not social sciences.  Law and education are generally professional schools, not science.    Healthcare is a profession, not a science, although many healthcare professionals are scientists.  Science is a branch of philosophy, as is logic and mathematics.  That should be your top tier.  Science is the branch of philosophy that studies nature using inductive empiricism, so computer science, engineering, and professions such as healthcare, while related to science, are not natural sciences.  Social sciences are a subset of sciences that are generally considered apart from natural sciences, although they are technically subordinate to them."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c7bm9,The_Wisenheimer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"In terms of occupation, I would tend to agree with you.  Nobody refers to a scientist as a philosopher and nobody refers to a philosopher as a scientist, at least not by the modern meaning of the terms.  In terms of epistemology though, I would argue that science is a type of philosophy, id est, science is one of many philosophies and it is therefore a subset of philosophy.  If you go back through history, all the sciences started as branches of philosophy.  Physics was natural philosophy and biology was natural history.   Eventually, the natural sciences rose as a particular kind of philosophy that encompassed such diverse fields as what would come to be known as physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, et cetera.  I would classify science as a type of philosophy, specifically, the philosophy that holds that truth can only be discovered through inductive empiricism."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c7bm9,zornthewise,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:42:26 2015 UTC,I think mathematics has a lot more empiricism than is commonly thought. Most of the hard part of mathematics is having really good intuition and that comes from a looking at a lot of examples often.  I do agree it is qualitatively very different from the rest of the sciences...
AskScienceDiscussion,3c7bm9,The_Wisenheimer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:43:54 2015 UTC,"That's not really empiricism though.  Empiricism is inductively testing something in nature.  Mathematics is deductive and rejects induction, just as science is inductive and rejects deduction.  As useful as formal proofs can be, they are not science until corroborated through induction.  As useful as inductive evidence can be, they are not mathematics until proved for all cases deductively.    Finally, mathematics is a contrived system, so there can be no empiricism by definition.  Empiricism requires observing nature, but pure math is not natural."

Probably, so there definitely is some strong relationship between the natural world and the numerical world, but numbers and number systems themselves are not natural.  We could just as well imagine a number system with no primes."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c63fn,michaelfri,7,Sun Jul 5 04:30:58 2015 UTC,"100% efficiency from solar panels will most likely look peach black, regardless of the amount of light you shine on them. That also mean that they would not reflect back heat, as all of the energy would be converted to electricity.  The air on earth is getting it's warmth from the Sun indirectly. The solar rays do hit occasional molecules of air, but the major heating ""mechanism"" depends on Earth's surface and it's reflectivity. The solar rays mostly heat the surface, which in turn gets hot. Then, it heats the air that comes in contact with it, which becomes less dense, and rises up, letting cooler air come in contact with the surface and to get heated as well. Not all surfaces getting absorb the solar energy at the same way, converting it to heat. Some scatter more of it away - mainly white and light surfaces, like ice, will get less hot. You can see the actual difference if you touch the white and black painted rim of the pavements, at some spots. The black ones would be significantly hotter.  Back to your question. These ideal solar panels, at large scale would for a huge patches where the air above them doesn't get as hot as in other places. The difference in density could lead to weather changes that could diverge ocean currents, winds, or affect the amount of rainfall in certain places.  Note that 100% are highly unrealistic. In the scenario of having such a wide coverage of solar panels, much lesser efficiency rates will suffice, and are not likely to cause any climate changes. In terms of solar panels size with regards to world power, I've seen this image, visualizing the area needed to gain the amount of power required for different regions."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c63fn,michaelfri,2,Sun Jul 5 12:51:29 2015 UTC,"There is much more into it than surface area. Putting a solar panel on a rooftop in Siberia or Southern Chile would not be nearly as effective as near the equator. Places with high rains will not produce much electricity either. So there's more than size to it. If you want an estimation of how much electricity would be produced in the scenario of covering every house in solar panels, you'll have to work harder, and even then, I don't think that it would give you any useful insights since the costs of such thing would be enormous.  Earth gets more than enough sunlight for meet human needs, yet building and maintaining solar panels isn't cheap, and people tend to stick to what they are used to, instead of buying these.  Basically, if we were to better adopt the concept of solar power, we would build solar farms where the Sun shines and rely on other energy sources where it doesn't (Like near the poles, where hydroelectric power and even nuclear can do better)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c63fn,michaelfri,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:12:31 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've thought it could create difference in air temperatures and that could lead to extra winds (even tornados) and other weather changes. But I didn't realise the area needed to gain required amounts of energy is actually so small. Certainly such small area couldn't affect climate too much.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c5o81,Brabberly,6,Sun Jul 5 01:22:47 2015 UTC,"The gravitational binding energy of a uniform-density sphere is   U = 3GM2/5R  G is on the order of 10-10 Nm2/kg2. M is on the order of 1022 kg. R is on the order of 2 * 106 m.      Plugging in, we get   U = ~ 3 * 10-10 * 1044 / 107 Nm = 3 * 1027 J      A joule is on the order of 10-16 megatons of high explosive.  So it would take 1011 megatons to blow up the moon.  The global arsenal of nuclear weapons is 6400 megatons.  We're off by a factor of over ten million.  We might come up with something stronger than our nukes, using current technology.  But not ten million times stronger."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c5o81,dsws2,3,Sun Jul 5 05:32:22 2015 UTC,"If we wanted to get rid of the moon, we wouldn't do it by blowing up the moon.  We would do it by building two space elevators on the moon.  One would go toward Earth and extend past L1; the other would go away from Earth and extend beyond L2.  Earth's gravity is much stronger than the moon's gravity.  Stuff going down the elevator toward Earth would be going downhill most of the way, if the elevator were long enough.  We could collect that energy and use it to run the equipment to dig up more chunks of the moon and put them on the conveyor, as well as to power the uphill part of the conveyor.  Likewise, as you go farther out along a tether extending out from the moon, the centrifugal force would get stronger and stronger.  Build the tether long enough, and stuff would be going downhill most of the way on that tether too.  Again, the energy could be collected and used to power the rest of the system.  Part of the moon would be dumped off into interplanetary space, and part would be dumped into Earth's atmosphere where it would burn up as meteors.  There would be a continuous rain of moon dust settling all over Earth, and some orbits would be unusable because of all the moon chunks falling through.  We dig up on the order of ten billion tons of coal per year (1013 kg).  If we dug up the moon at the same rate, it would take on the order of ten billion years.    The key would be exponential growth.  The tether can be made of basalt fiber, produced simply by melting and extruding moon rock.  Other components can also mostly be produced from lunar materials, and the process would provide its own energy.  Exponential growth at 10% per year reaches a factor of ten billion in 242 years if I did the calculation right.  Of course, the 10% growth is just chosen arbitrarily.  Whatever the actual growth rate that we could do, it would be lot slower than an explosion.  But we could get there eventually, in a historical length of time rather than a cosmological one."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c5o81,dsws2,2,Sun Jul 5 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. A quick Google tells me the world's current nuclear arsenal is approx 16,000 warheads with a potential destructive power of something like 7000 megatons if we were to set them all off at once.   Now, don't get me wrong, that's a pretty enormous explosion, but compare it to the energy thought to have been released by the Chicxulub impactor - the six mile wide asteroid that is suspected to have killed off the dinosaurs. That was in the realm of 100 million megatons, and while it almost ended life on Earth's fragile surface biofilm, it seems like the Earth itself barely 'blinked' in a geological aspect.   The moon is big, really, really big - about a quarter the size of Earth and something like 7x1022 kg of rock. It's anyone's guess what would happen if we sent everything we had at it, but I suspect we'd be looking at one rather insignificant crater and a completely intact man in the moon mocking us for our egotism."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c5o81,The_Dead_See,2,Sun Jul 5 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"No. The answer to your first question, do we have the technology, is technically yes. In a limited sense the rocketry technology we have can lift mass to orbit. That's pretty much all you need to have to destroy the moon.  But the scale needed is completely, utterly, ridiculously beyond our means. The binding energy of the moon is about 1029 joules. That would require about 5.5 quadrillion megatons of tnt. So I'm not well versed in orbital mechanics, but I think the most efficient way to smash something from earth to the moon is basically just use a transfer orbit but omit the part where you slow down to orbit the moon. I think that's about 3000 m/s delta v (correct me  if I'm wrong). The moon orbits at about 1000 m/s so let's say we'll collide at 4000 m/s. We impact at 1/2 mv2, we know we need 1029 joules and we hit at 4000 m/s. We get 1022 kg for the mass of our impacter. That's like smashing all of the water in all of the oceans times 7 into the moon. We'd need at least that same amount of fuel just to make the transfer.

We're not just billions upon billions of interacting molecules, but also chaotically complex systems of electricity, heat, and possibly - no one is quite sure - quantum processes occurring far below the level of our atoms. We don't even have the technology to map the function of a single skin cell in any given moment - there's just too much going on.

Every time I shuffle my feet or scratch there are tidal shifts of electric charge throughout my body.  Uncertainty says we cannot know both the velocity and position of an individual particle because carefully measuring one perturbs the other. But the actual principle applies to electrons most of all. We've taken photographs of atoms. Sure, we probablly nudged the heck out of its electrons in the process. But what doesn't purturb electrons.  Molecules are huge by comparison. We can measure molecules just fine.  As others point out, the problem is moving the mind-bogglingly large data-set from source to destination. And having the machines capable of putting each molecule in its place in response to that data.  We'd have much better luck with dimensional folding than classic teleportation.  (In a novel I am writing, they've figured out how to entangle space instead of just individual particles. So they achieve a teleport by entangling two identical empty spaces, then move material into the entangled space and disentangle it just-so. The disentangling determines where the mass ends up. It's a bunch of ""science fantasy mumbo-jumbo"" akin to invoking ""hyperspace"" but I figure it's way more likely than transmitting and accurately recreating a significant mass.)"

What's happening here is that moisture-laden winds coming over the Pacific are forced up a mountain and the moisture predictably condenses into a near-constant state of rain and fog. The wind almost never stops so neither does the rain. This phenomenon is called orographic uplift, and gives many mountains a very wet (but not usually this wet) slope.  That's about as perpetually wet as any spot on a normal terrestrial planet is ever going to be. The winds could be slightly steadier for full 365 coverage, and most of the planet could be ocean and coastal mountains for more spots like this one.  Tidally locked planets with the ocean side perpetually facing the sun will experience constant heating of that ocean, resulting in constant evaporation and constant condensation when the water approaches the cooler dark side. This would produce an eternal hurricane centered on the sunward ocean, and eternal rain (and eternal sunset) on its fringes.

Rain happens because sunlight is absorbed at ground level and infrared is radiated higher in the atmosphere: evaporating water somewhere and condensing it somewhere else transports latent heat.  It takes a ridiculously large amount of heat to evaporate water, and the heat is released when the water condenses again.  If the whole planet were constantly covered with cloud thick enough to rain, probably not enough sunlight would reach the ground to provide the heat to keep evaporating the water.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c52gm,LazinCajun,2,Sun Jul 5 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"If arbitrary FTL were possible, then yes, that would amount to time travel.  However, if some frame of reference were privileged by the process of setting up the FTL system, and you could only go FTL between points where you're going from earlier to later in that frame of reference, then it wouldn't involve time travel.  One of the postulates of special relativity is that there are no privileged frames of reference.  Accordingly, it's a theorem of special relativity that FTL travel would enable time travel, as /u/LazinCajun linked.  But on a good-enough-for-sci-fi basis, you could have something make the difference between one frame of reference and another.  No frame of reference is inherently privileged: you could have set up the system in any of them.  Once you have set it up, though, only that frame of reference has it, and it would somehow get in the way if you tried to set up another one nearby."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c52gm,dsws2,2,Sun Jul 5 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this solves the problem of FTL round trips violating causality, but I admit it's been a while since I've thought about such things."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c52gm,LazinCajun,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:09:37 2015 UTC,"One frame of reference is special, because it has the FTL transport system set up.  Every FTL traveler arrives after they left, in that frame's time.  So no one can ever go back into their own proper past (backward light cone), because every frame of reference recognizes that as a trip into the past by its reckoning as well.  As it says in the link you posted below, ""The fact is, you won't get any actual causality violations with FTL that way. The trouble comes if the two planets are moving away from each other.""  So you just can't connect them unless they're stationary relative to each other."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c4ggi,thehunter12345,4,Sat Jul 4 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I'm not the most knowledgable on the subject, but I'll tell you what I know.  First, most metals actually are not attracted to magnets. Gold is among many that aren't. Metals like iron, cobalt, or nickel are attracted to magnets.  These metals with strong attractions are ferromagnetic. Ferromagnetic metals have a large number of unpaired electrons. Non ferromagnetic metals can sometimes be magnetized, though to my understanding, the attraction will not be as strong."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c4ggi,Hermungafa,2,Sat Jul 4 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"This was also posted in /r/AskScience (by your alt I guess?). I'll just copy/paste what I said there.  Many other metals, such as copper and silver, are also diamagnets like gold, meaning they repel magnets (I think the repulsion is pretty small though). The response of a material without intrinsic magnetic order is usually classified as either diamagnetic (repels magnets) or paramagnetic (attracts magnets), and depends crucially on the properties of electrons in the material.  For metals, the fact that there are ""conduction electrons"" which are free to move through the material is an important factor in determining if a material is paramagnetic or diamagnetic, and it turns out that there are competing effects. Paramagnetism usually arises when you have unpaired electrons in localized shells, or when applied magnetic fields cause conduction electrons with a certain spin to be energetically favorable (""Pauli paramagnetism""). In contrast, full shells of electrons, which usually exist below the conduction electrons, localized to ions, will be like current loops and have a diamagnetic response (vey roughly). Finally, even the free electrons will have an orbital response to an external magnetic field which is diamagnetic (""Landau diamagnetism,"" which is of the same order of magnitude but opposite to Pauli paramagnetism).  So determining whether an metal is para- or dia-magnetic is a very complicated, subtle issue of competing effects. In the case of gold, the diamagnetism happens to win out."

AskScienceDiscussion,3c4ggi,Sean1708,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Basically, there will be some response to an external field, and whether the response is in the same or opposite directions can be called paramagnetic or diamagnetic respectively."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c4ggi,mofo69extreme,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:22:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, diamagnetism is a really small effect (coming from paired electrons), which all materials have. Paramagnetism however is much stronger, so materials with unpaired electrons are dominated by paramagnetism."

This is a step short of the lab's stated goal of ""ignition"", where nuclear fusion generates as much energy as the lasers supply. This is because known ""inefficiencies"" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.   So technically Energy In > Energy Out, which means no energy was generated.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c2z3d,SSJ4_Vegito,2,Sat Jul 4 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"why didn't they evolve to be as diverse as today?       They had neither the time nor the room. Today's mammalian diversity is the result of losing all of the dinos. It left open every possible niche for mammals to wander into. Mammals have some serious advantages over reptiles, but a shrew-like creature has little to work with against the diversity of the dinos, and they didn't have much time to do it in. Non-avian dinos only co-existed with mammals for around a hundred million years.       but couldn't being underground allow to evolve to have a better brain? Much like humans?      Intellect is not a goal of evolution. You shouldn't think of humans as being on top of some kind of evolutionary ladder. Keep in mind that we've been evolving exactly as long as every other thing that's alive today. Most animals don't rely on intellect at all and they're mostly doing just fine. Just take a look at how many beetles are wandering around. Cognitive capacity isn't exactly their strong point.        there has been about 4 mass extinction events (I believe) Seperated by about 200 million years. My question is that, During previous times has there ever been evidence to human-like civilization in the past?       Actually five previously and one that's ongoing. The Holocene extinction is being caused by humans and we've calculated that species are currently going extinct at a at least 1000 times the normal background extinction rate. So there have been six mass extinctions and one is ongoing.      The best evidence we would certainly find for an extinct species with human-like intelligence would be a dramatic shift in the range of fossil species. With globalization we've seen species from all over the planet get moved around and spread about. So in the fossil record we would suddenly see southern hemisphere fossil species showing up in Canadian shale. Which, of course, we haven't found. So we can pretty easily rule it out.        if these questions seem Dumb      No such thing!       So basically, after the dinos went extinct there were little mammals running around that had survived. But there was also a whole lot of newly emptied habitat that they could now take advantage of. And since mammals have certain advantages over reptiles (some of which are shared with birds) mammals were able to take advantage of all of the empty habitat.      So mammals and birds both began rapid radiations (meaning that a lot of new species sprang up). One advantage mammals have that birds lack is internal gestation. So mammals have been slightly better competitors and have come to dominate the megafauna.       Apes were one product of that radiation and humans are apes. So we have the meteor impact to thank for our existence. But apes weren't evolving steadily toward intelligence. It's something of a fluke that we got big brains. It all goes back to standing up and walking on two legs.      If apes never stood up, there would still be no human-like intelligence on the planet."
AskScienceDiscussion,3c2z3d,AnecdotallyExtant,2,Sat Jul 4 11:04:53 2015 UTC,"There are no signs of any ancient human-like civilization. In the mesozoic, mammals were small and rodent-like.

AskScienceDiscussion,3c2z3d,EpicHailBoots,3,Sat Jul 4 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"Your questions are very open-ended (that's a good thing!), so they take some extra breath to answer. I have a few very different things I want to say, and because it's hot outside, I'm lazy and will just list them with bullet points instead of elegantly linking them with segues. This ain't English class.  Former human-like civilizations  This is the easy one; the answer is no, there is no evidence that another sentient species has inhabited this planet before. Such a big brain is very much an evolutionary oddity, it costs a lot of energy (up to 20% of your total energy consumption!), and because of it, humans stay ""children"" for very long. Both are very ""expensive"" traits, so it shouldn't strike us as particularly odd that this trait has only evolved once so far. In fact, it should almost rather strike us as odd that it has evolved at all!  Ecological Niches  This is a very useful concept to understand, I think. Each species has its own ""niche"" that it lives in, the food sources, the daily rhythm, the predators it competes with, each species is specialized to one specific such niche and effectively ""occupies"" it. The reason why there were relatively few mammal species when dinosaurs lived is that dinosaurs (and other now-extinct species) occupied many of these niches. When that one meteorite hit the earth 65 million years ago, many of these niches opened up, and gave the surviving species the opportunity to branch out into them.  Let's take a hypothetical mid-sized mammal, relatively high up in the food chain. Now let's say 75% of the species die out, but this species survives. Maybe there was a slightly smaller, nest-robbing dinosaur that went extinct, along with a bigger one that was an apex predator. Now our medium mammal can undergo speciation (formation of new species) - perhaps the smaller ones pick up on the fact that there are now many nests with juicy, uneaten eggs in them, and evolve towards that niche, becoming smaller (let's assume you have to be small to sustain off eggs). Meanwhile, the bigger specimens pick up on the fact that the ""large animal"" food source is largely untapped, and start eating these, and evolve into the new apex predator. Like this, many new species form relatively quickly to fill ecological niches after extinction events.  Thinking of Evolution as directed vs. random  This is just a word of caution. I get the impression that you might be thinking of evolution as directed, as ""lower"" species evolving into ""higher"" ones, with mammals being the highest clade, and humans as the highest mammals. This is an easy trap to fall into (I think everyone does it when they start learning about evolution; and most often subconsciously), but it isn't accurate. Evolution isn't species evolving ""up"", it's species evolving ""sideways"" or perhaps more accurately ""around"".  Remember, there is no objective scale for what species is ""better"" or ""worse"". When a new species evolves, it's because there's a free niche (or it's better at occupying an existing niche than the species already there) in the current ecosystem. It formed because it is ""better"" only in this environment. When the environment changes, the former fittest isn't fittest anymore, and a species evolves further to accomodate (or dies out).  Because it's just species ""shambling around"" and trying to find ways to survive, evolution is very random in what the species actually end up looking like. It's extremely chaotic. Questions like ""why did this evolve that way"" or ""why didn't that evolve like that"" are often as hard to answer as ""why did I roll a 3 with this die just now"". It's just what happened. This answers your question, I think. Why didn't humans evolve earlier? They... just didn't, yet. Or our niche was already taken.  I hope this answered your questions.

Darwin had shared some of his findings with other naturalists, but certainly hadn't seriously considered publishing them.       In 1858 some of Darwin's work was published alongside some of Wallace's and they were co-credited with the idea. In 1859 Darwin published the Origin and the rest is history.

The seasonal variations in temperature would be much less extreme, because it takes time for the land and water to warm up in the spring and cool off in the summer.    The inter-tropical convergence zone is a band of rising air, and therefore rainy weather, that pretty much circles the world near the equator.  It shifts back and forth, moving a bit toward the summer hemisphere, so there's a substantial zone in the tropics that has rainy seasons and dry seasons rather than winters and summers.

Ordinary meteors burn up (according to Wikipedia; I haven't checked sources) at 76 to 100 km (47 to 62 mi).

According to the two-hit hypothesis, in order for a cell to become cancerous, multiple mutations must occur, including (I think?) inactivation of both copies of a tumor supressor gene.   This is right, and I can also add that when one allele is damaged that actually increases the risk to the other one! That's because chromosomal crossover (which usually only takes place during meiosis, when gametes are made) sometimes (rarely, but it will happen a number of times during a normal human lifetime) happen during mitosis as well. This means that damaged DNA from one allele may get copied unto the healthy allele.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bxoyl,Hlothwig,2,Fri Jul 3 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, gravity works differently in different dimensions. You would need to worry about whether or not a disk is a stable self-gravitating configuration.  But let me ignore the physical question for now and just focus on the mathematical question.  Let us suppose that particle orbits are confined to a plane (this is rather straightforward to see for a central force problem).  Then your question essentially becomes: how many non-intersecting planes (i.e. 2-dimensional hypersurfaces) are there in d dimensions? I am only concerned about intersections along a line, not the trivial intersection at the origin.  In 3 dimensions, we can have an x-y plane, an x-z plane, and a y-z plane (and lots of other planes which are not along coordinate axes), but if you pick any two of these then you see that they will always intersect along a line. There just isn't enough ""space"" in 3 dimensions to have more than 1 non-intersecting plane.  In 4 dimensions, you can see that the x-y and z-w planes only intersect at the origin.  In 5 dimensions, we still have that x-y and z-w planes non-intersecting, but still there is not enough room to bring in another plane which does not intersect either of these two.  In 6 dimensions, you can have three non-intersecting planes: x-y, z-w, and say u-v.  I hope you see the pattern. In d dimensions, you can have ⌊d/2⌋ planes which only intersect at the origin."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bxoyl,duetosymmetry,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda confused on how this impacts on the question asked. If all the particles start off orbiting the star in different planes, you're saying in a 3-dimensional universe their orbits necessarily intersect on a line, but not necessarily in a 4-dimensional universe.  Firstly: what is the relevance of intersecting planes?  And secondly: just because two planes in 4-dimensional space don't have to intersect along a line, what sort of intersections would you actually find amongst 100 random planes? Would line-intersections be vanishingly rare or actually relatively common?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3bxoyl,Pluvialis,3,Fri Jul 3 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"(not your OP) if they intersect at a line, then there will be collisions. If there are collisions, the orbital planes are not stables and objects will move into different orbits and some will be knocked out of the system or into the mass/sun at the center, etc, which is how our own 3d cloud collapsed into a 2D plane for planetary orbits.  If there are sufficient non-intersecting planes, then all orbits will eventually fall into appropriate sets such that any given particle will move along an appropriate 2D plane that will not intersect with any other active 2D plane."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bxoyl,Zagaroth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry to skip the punchline. Essentially what /u/Zagaroth said: if planes intersect, particles orbiting within those two planes will collide.

We would usually just call that a 4-d (hyper)surface, or if it's more enlightening you could say that it's co-dimension 1 (when we're in dimension 5).  The angular momentum in 5 dimensions is quantified by an antisymmetric rank 2 tensor (a 2-form). There are ""simple"" 2-forms, which can be decomposed as wedge products between two 1-forms, and those simple 2-forms describe 2-planes, e.g. dx^dy is a 2-form which describes the x-y plane.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bxoyl,dsws2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:35:08 2015 UTC,"Your usage is of ""plane"" ok.  ""Plane"" in more than three dimensions normally means a subspace of dimension one less than that of the whole space.  Because we normally deal with three spatial dimensions, that normally means two.  So we can use ""plane"" in either way, keeping it 2-dimensional or keeping in (N-1)-dimensional.  If you describe a rotation within a 2-d space (a plane in the usual sense of the word), it generalizes directly to a higher-dimension space by using that plane's coordinates as the first two coordinates of your larger space.  Then the higher-space rotation just sends a point to the point with the first two coordinates given by the 2d rotation, and all the other coordinates staying the same.  In 3d, that's the only kind of rotation there is: rotation around an axis perpendicular to a plane.  However, it's not clear what if anything you mean by ""Could the angular momentum lie along a 4-dimensional plane within 5-space instead of along two non-intersecting 2-dimensional planes?""  In 3d, there's only one kind of rotation.  You can't have rotation just in a (2d) plane; the whole space rotates, or none of it does.  Likewise in 5d, you can't have two 2d subspaces rotate while the rest of the space."

In this sense, translational energy is quantized because it's described by a theory that represents energy by an operator, but when you do the approximations and simplifications and so on to get a number out of the theory in the end, that number can still be any real number. Assuming you're not talking about, say, a molecule in a box.  Besides that, toward the end of your post you've mixed up units with the quantities that use those units. The unit of energy is the unit of mass times the unit of length squared divided by the unit of time squared, but that doesn't mean that you can calculate a meaningful amount of energy by multiplying some mass times some length squared divided by some time squared.  TL;DR No, they're continuous.    Hypothetical addendum: there are theories that predict one or more of length, time, and/or mass might take on discrete values. Loop quantum gravity comes to mind.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bxs3b,Djerrid,5,Fri Jul 3 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"That seems to ignore the concept of ""emergent phenomenon"". Color is often given as an example. Atoms do not have a color, at least in one important sense. There is the concept of color as a naming system for different wavelengths that can theoretically be extended to every elementary particle since they all have associated wavelengths in modern physics, but there is also the concept of a color as the conscious experience of observing something that reflects wavelengths.  From that perspective, a single atom has no color. And there is no specific number of atoms we can put together where we suddenly have a color being experienced in a conscious mind. Instead, it is something we call an emergent property. It is like a meta-property that arises gradually out of the average activity of a large number of parts. And it embodies the old saying, ""greater than the sum of its parts"".  For much more complicated examples, we can talk about things like economics or thermodynamics. They are concepts that arise from the combination of a huge number of simpler parts, but that began to have properties that are in some sense separate from the properties of their parts all being simply added together.  It is important to note that we haven't slipped into the realm of poetic nonsense quite yet, because, at bottom, we still are assuming everything is just the mechanical operation of simple pieces with no ""extra bits"" added in. But somewhat similar to the Uncertainty Principle we've learned there are inherant limitations to being able to pull every event apart neatly into one grand entropy equation that predicts exactly why Michael Jackson would be driven to become a superstar under the pressure of his abusive childhood.   There just is no way that we could ever make the kind of measurements we would need to understand even a single instant of the physical system we occupy (i.e. the universe). We already know even trying to make the observations would disturb the system to the point where they would no longer be good. So, in a fundamental way, there will always be these seas of uncertainty that our laws will have to arise from. Which will also mean it will be near impossible to ever really know that it is just all entropy maximization. We could exist in a tiny little pocket of what is really out there and entropy maximization is just how our little area behaves to first order."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bv3pi,Tegno,7,Thu Jul 2 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Well, you would hit a golf ball alot farther. Right now, only the momentum of the last few inches of club gets transferred to the ball, because of the ratio of speed of sound in the club to the length of time the ball is on the face. If sound travelled faster, that rationwould be larger and the ball would get more of the energy you put into the swing.  I expect in general, elastic collisions would be a lot more energetic."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bv3pi,kanagawa,5,Thu Jul 2 15:02:04 2015 UTC,I disagree. The speed of sound in the ball would also be higher so it would not compress nearly as much nor for as long.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,sdabbs65,3,Thu Jul 2 13:28:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, look.  In the first setup, you have 120V being applied directly to the pump power supply to do with what it will.   In the second setup, you're taking 120V from the wall, down converting it to 13V and probably rectifying it to DC, then inverting and transforming back to 120V AC, and then handing it to the pump to use.   Each step that the electricity passes through is less than 100% efficient. Typically 80% efficiency in small inverters. On top of that, if the inverter isn't a true sine wave inverter, the device could be required to draw as much as 20% more power to make up the difference. If these numbers are in the ballpark for your setup, you're losing between 20 and 40% efficiency by putting the inverter inline.  KISS is almost always the right answer."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,ouemt,2,Thu Jul 2 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"Why would that be any cheaper? You lose some power at each step.  I don't even know if it would work well long term. Some motors don't work as well/last as long with the A/C that inverters put out.  Edit: I made the assumption that your pump has a controller. If it doesn't have a controller, just get that instead. I get that 1000W is less than 120V * 18 amps."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,Teanut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:40:51 2015 UTC,there is no controller just a transformer inverter and pump. i don't even know why a controller would be used.
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,Teanut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"You're trying to save money on electricity, right?  So the inverter won't supply the full 18 amps at 120 volts. You'll ""save money."" Your pump also might not start.  A pump controller can increase and decrease the flow rate on the pump (and therefore reduce the electricity demand) in a more controlled fashion.  Depending on the pump you also might be able to get away with using a dimmer switch, but you also might burn out your pump.  By the way, if this pump is for a well, don't fuck with it. Call your pump installer and tell him what you want."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,Teanut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"it would be running from a transformer to 13 volts instead of 120 volts 20 amps i would be using 1 amp and the 20 amps would be coming from the inverter was my thought,"
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,WazWaz,2,Thu Jul 2 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"You should read the Wikipedia articles on electricity. You're misunderstanding some fundamental concepts of the relationship between voltage and amperage.  18 amps at 120 volts = 2160 VA (watts) = 166.15 amps at 13 volts (not accounting for efficiency loss in the transformer.)  If you use your transformer/inverter setup I think you'll spend more money, burn out your pump, transformer, or inverter, and maybe even start a fire."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,BitOBear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:32:21 2015 UTC,That makes no sense at all. Where do you think your inverter gets its amps from?
AskScienceDiscussion,3bvcmv,ChipotleMayoFusion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"No. That's not even wrong. If it were possible to save energy with something like that, that wold be what your pump did in the first place.  Others have shown the math or whatever, but I'm going to paint a word picture.  The equal sign in all those equations is a tyrant. It's an unflinching statment of how things are. So when we talk about something like ""power"" we are talking about how hard something is to do and so how hard we had to push it.  So if you want to push a thousand gallons of water through the filter in your pool, it's going to take a fixed amount of power. The size of the pump and the voltage it runs at are sort of immaterial because it's going to need to run that pump that hard to move that much water.  So I can push a car ""so hard"" and if I wanted my car pushed just as hard but I wanted five-year-olds to do it, I'd need several or maybe even many.  Voltage is ""electromotive force"" When the voltage goes down you need to move more electrons to get the same result. When the voltage goes up you need fewer.  So as you lower the voltage, to do the same work, you have to increase the current.  Now current is what makes things hot. Increased current decreases efficency (to oversimplify) because its the electrons equivelent of trying to force more and more people to use the same sized hallway. There comes a point where there are just too many people trying to walk at once and things flare up.  So when the power company wants to send a whole lot of power from the nuke plant or the dam or the coal fired plant, they send it at very high voltage. So high that it'd kill you if you got to close to it. So high that you can't use it.  And when those big lines reach the general area they are sent to a fenced off area full of transformers to trade that voltage for current. And those ""reasonably high"" voltages are the top set of wires on the poles near your house. Then when they get to little clusters of a handful of homes there are those grey-can transformers to take that high voltage (like 750 volts) down to the 120 you are expecting.  So high voltage lets you send a lot of power, but it'd not that safe to be around. And we trade that efficiency for safety as it gets closer and closer to the people who need to use it safely. (again, yes, audience I know I am oversimplifying 8-).  So when you have 120 volts in your house that's because that's what someone decided was the best balance of safety and current.  Trading down voltages is actually trading away efficiency. So even if it were free of exchange losses, running all that power out to your pool at 13 volts would make those wires very hot, and that heat would be wasted power and wasted money.  Computers and smart phones and car radios and most of the electronics in your home use low voltages (3, 5, and 12 or even 19 volts) because it's safer and easier for a battery to produce those sorts of voltages. And frankly juggling all those on-and-off states doesn't involve a lot of physical force.  But the big things like pumping the heat out of your refrigerator, or swishing the water in your clothes washer, or sucking the dirt out of your carpet, or pumping the water around in your pool, or drying your clothes takes a lot of very real and very physical ""power"".  So just like running an air wrench is better with a narrow hose and a lot of pressure, running a motor or other electrical appliance with a small wire and a higher voltage is the best call.  The entire package (since it's plugged into an outlet I'm assuming it's an above-ground pool) was designed to be as efficient and cheap to run as possible without being impossible to use.  (Indeed a 240 volt pump would probably run cooler and be more efficient, and is usually the norm for an in-ground pool, but most people aren't about to go have an electrician come out to install a perminant 240 volt line to support their temporary pool.)  Want to save some money?  Cover the pool when not in use and put a nice timer on the pump to make sure it gets turned off when not in use."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bx8n3,TDotSquared,3,Thu Jul 2 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"Simpler order of thought. /u/The_Evil_Within is correct.  But in the authorial sense, where you are allowed a little suspension of disbelief, you have your forces backwards.  Gravity is an inward force that effects masses.  ""Molecular State"" describes all matter except plasma. Right now you are in a molecular state.  Gravity is an incredibly weak force. It takes a huge amount of mass to affect a minor disturbance of notice. Compare to the fact that a tiny magnet can exert enough force on a target object sufficient to counter-act the entire pull of the earth. A magnet the size of the earth wiht the same strength per unit volume (teslas per gram) of a refrigerator magnet would probably slice the sun apart (someone smarter than I would have to do the math to check me here).  Gravity isn't even as strong as surface tension until the water droplet gets pretty large.  But if gravity had anyting to wiht keeping you together yo would be a blob.  If gravity ceased, every force it creates (such as air pressure and water pressure, and the pressure that holds the tectonic plates against the molten core of the earth) would disapear and all those other pressures would suddenly express themselves.  In a space-ship sort of setting this would be meaningless. If I had a gravity nutralizing beam and I shot it at another ship, it would maybe mess up their navigation while the beam was on, but the ship itself is bolted together and welded or whatever. It is being held together by pure mechanical action in order to keep the air pressure in. A space ship is like a balloon. It holds together because it's skin is up to the stress. removing a force like gravity would make no real difference.  Now you want a magical space gun...  A beam that neutralizes the electromagnetic force would totally runin someones day instantly. Electrons would go everywhere at the speed of light. Every molecule would disappear, replaced with a cloud of mono-atomic particles, and no force would prevent fusion of even very heavy elements when they bumped into one another.  That would be instantly fatal. When the beam was shut off the explosion would be horrific, and the remains would be unidentifiable.   You want to make something literally vaporize into energy and hard radiation though, you want to turn off the strong nuclear force. Do that and in an instant everything in the field of effect is instantly transformed into hydrogen and neutron radiation. This is literally how you reverse entropy (if you could do it) as you could reset the age of suns.  EDITED: Thinking about this later... Everything would become Hydrogen-1 and I don't think hydrogen 1 can undergo fusion because there would be, on average, no neutrons. That beam might extinguish suns, or otherwise totally induce some sort of hither-to never seen state of dense matter, if delivered to a star on a sufficiently large scale. I mean you'd have a hot and dense hydrogen plasma, but there'd be no fusion, so the density would spike because there was no photon pressure, but there woudln't be a black hole event because the mass was already insufficient per unit volume. The blob would cool quickly by comparison because there would be no more fusion to heat it. Then again the neutrons would have been just hanging around so maybe the'd condense into the nuclei again eventually. I don't think we've ever seen such low energy neutrons in the wild as we normally have to knock them lose energetically to see them.  hrm...  Messing with any of the fundamental forces has a whole lot of nasty potential, but gravity would probably be the safest one to tweak."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bx8n3,BitOBear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"Molecules and atoms are bound to each other by electromagnetic, Weak Nuclear, and Strong nuclear forces. Thus individual distinct objects would be fine.  The atmosphere on the other hand.. the release of pressure from gravity would cause the atmosphere and possibly the oceans to actively gush away from the earth.   Also, all orbits would cease, every space object would head in a straight line along its last trajectory.   If some one was on the moon, they'd continue to move in the same direction as the moon, but any step would cause them to push off and not come back down, ever, with out the help of some sort of propulsion. And they'd have to get some sort of hold to not just keep bouncing off.   a cold solid body like the moon would be fine, there's enough other forces in play to keep it mostly together, though it might start breaking off a few pieces, or have some rumbling expanding. Depending on the exact pressures, it might crack into a few large pieces, but they'd all be traveling in the same direction.  A hot core object like the earth might actually explode, or at least spout huge geysers of lava that would fling molten rock into space. That's molten rock being held under pressure, and you just released the source of that pressure. I don't think the earth's crust has enough structural integrity to keep everything together with out gravity to help.   Gas giants like Jupiter all stars would be incredibly violent as the pressure was suddenly released. Any star effected would flash into a nova or supernova from the shockwave of everything escaping as fast as it could. And then any such star would effectively wink out of existence, leaving behind an equal-mass of hot gas slowly dispersing outwards.   If this was a small target effect, like say a person, and the rest of the environment was still effected by gravity, then that person should be mostly OK. Long term they'd have effects like orbiting astronauts have, but short term they'd sort of float along and be able to swim through the air (poorly) and push off of objects. For the most part a person would be dragged along with the earth because of the physical pressure of the atmosphere which still is effected by gravity. Oh.. and they'd start to loose continuity to the rotation of the earth if outside, and be carried by the wind if not holding on to something.  humm, depending on where on the earth they were at the exact moment they lost gravity, there would be also angular momentum to contend with. Indoors, they're going to end up on the west side of any given room as their 'down', with slightly varying angles cycling through out the day. I don't wanna do the research and math at the moment to figure that out exactly. It gets messy."

Planets would expand outwards, becoming debris fields of rock, dust, and ice.  Solar systems and galaxies would slowly fly apart.  In black holes, gravity crushes atoms.  They get closer and closer until their nucleii touch.  Then the electrons get pushed in and pushed in until they fuse with the protons, forming neutrons.  The neutrons are squeezed until, finally, they collapse.  Once that happens there is no known force that counteract gravity.    However, once gravity is eliminated, what happens to the degenerate matter?  Does it pop back into existence as a cloud of neutrons?  Does it remain a super-dense singularity?

The second point sounds more promising. Have asteroids / impact sites ever been used to harvest resources? Would gathering resources from an impact site be any easier than let's say a large-scale open-cast mining operation? The whole concept of ""asteroid mining"" (in space) is still rather speculative at this time, correct?

Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona was a source for around 30 tons of iron and nickel that remain of the impact there (though Barringer the man hoped to find a lot more).

Barringer:       was convinced that an iron-nickel core over 10 million tons lay beneath the floor of the crater, and in 1928, raised $200,000 from an investor promising a profit of $250 million on a mere half million dollar investment.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bvin6,tony_d47,3,Thu Jul 2 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"That extra question is a bit more complex than these first two...  A simple harmonic motion is one where the acceleration is proportional to the opposite of the displacement.  That is to say:  d2 / dt2 p(t) = -k p(t)  Where k is some positive constant, and p(t) is the position as a function of time.   So one way to check these expression is to take the second derivative and see.  For example:  d2 / dt2 sinωt - cosωt = ω2 -sinωt + cosωt = - ω2 (sinωt - cosωt)  So that is a simple harmonic oscillator.  But  d2 / dt2 sin2 ωt = 2 ω2 cos (2  ωt)  Has no suitable k, so it's not a simple harmonic oscillator."

Not that it matters, really.)  It's possible to show that all displacement functions p(t) which satisfy that condition can be expressed in the form A sin(ωt + φ), where A, ω, and φ are constant. Using trig identities (like the sum and difference formulas, the double angle formulas, and so on), you can rewrite sin(ωt) - cos(ωt) as √(2) sin(ωt - π/4), and the fact that it matches the simple harmonic oscillator form tells you that it represents simple harmonic motion. You can check that each of the answers which does represent simple harmonic motion can be written as a single sine function.  For the bonus question, something different is going on there. I would suggest simplifying the exponent, then try to use what you know about waves to see if you can identify its behavior."

The ability to expand and contract relative to one's own frame of reference.  Their problem in reaching these conclusions however, are profound. They are incapable of learning. In most scenarios they are incapable of stopping, being instead forced to move constantly. Indeed their universe often and repeatedly returns to initial conditions.

Now as far as ""a visit to flatland"" style simple analysis done by a fully motile and self-directed intellegence introduced into that reality, there would persist some very real problems with modeling a 3D let alond 4D organic reality from the observable phenomenon.  In the baseline reality (the original games) the act of changing directions requires a complete x-axis reversal with no interstitial states. Mario et al do not ""turn around"" they are fundamentally restructured in a new orientation in Planick style time... literally in the event space between the universal re-rendering of frames the entity stops being left-hand-rule and instantly becomes right-hand-rule. These zero-time transitions would be hugely problematic.  Next, if we go between games, the pesky advent and removal of the  Z-axis we observe to be ""depth"" would prove a profound discontinuity to experience.  The complete lack of motive for all activity would be mind-breaking and speak to automation of some sort.  The absence of conservation of mass and energy would be telling.  And finally, the nightmarish experience of loading screens where the universe is systematically un-staged and then re-staged would be tough.  Also changes in clock rate from system to system would make the presence of absolute and repeating frames of reference running at different empirical speeds somewhat painfully obvious.  And the feedbacks and rubberbanding evident in network play would also be a strong indicator of controlling agency. After all how much more obvious would lag be if you lived through it first hand, having accomplishments and failures repeatedly revised by a capricious reset of the conditions but with no actual rewind of the timeline."

In one part, the doctors did examinations etc.  In the other part, the doctors were never there, it was just midwives and others.

Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, and Culture by Julia Wood (2012).  ""Sexed Up: Theorizing the Sexualization of Culture"" by Feona Attwood.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bqwgd,BitOBear,2,Wed Jul 1 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think one flaw of this question is to presume that at some prior point society wasn't sexualized.  In point of fact there is no real difference in the distinctions you perceive. Dirty lyrics and lymerics. The at-the-time lurid sexuality of Shakespeare. The breasts like fruit of the bible. The salacious nature of Dracula. The uptight illusions overlaying the aggressive sexuality of the Victorian era. Vaudeville. Burlesque. You name it.  The only thing that has really changed is that the instant preservation of what was previously ephemeral performance has become something between ""really easy"" and ""automatic"". The riabald sexuality of ages past was simply not as well documented and so the ""high society"" of which historians counted themselves members simply pretended such things were rare and not to be spoken of.  So really we live in an age not of increased sexualization, but of improved memory and empirical evidence of same.  In my fifty years I've grown accustomed to getting my porn more easily, but I've not noticed much change in the sexuality of it. It just left the black market, moved to the grey market, and now is on the endless streaming firehose of the internet.  The only real difference is that the ""shock value"" is pretty much gone. And good riddance to that.  I suspect that the real reason that people haven't been seeing this come up in classwork is that the old men teaching the classes know it didn't change much at all, and have been noticing that lack of change for generation after generation.  If anything, by demystifying a lot of stuff, the internet will likely reduce the salaciousness of sex. Once the fruit is neither forbidden nor rare, it's true blandness will become obvious.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bqk6g,HippyYoHippyYay,2,Wed Jul 1 11:13:35 2015 UTC,"I see. So there is some development.   it's more of a lack of willpower, emotional intelligence, and an instant gratification culture    That's the problem I was thinking about. Basically we put too much concern on changing people, which is hard and even unrealistic. These things are human nature. I believe a lot of modenization is reconciling human nature with social needs, rather than binding human nature to meet social needs. If there is good technology, we don't need to change every person's willpower or these things to make them healthy. (just like with modern transportation, we don't need to plan in advance and take months to go to one country from another.)  Edit: a better comparison would probably be the Internet making it possible for database keepers to work at home. These people (though not everyone) don't need the willpower to get up at 7 and go to the company everyday anymore, thanks to Internet, which is a technology. You also see futuristic stories where people let robots do all their work and live very cozily, but they aren't all fat.

Not everybody can be happy, as sad as that might seem.   The problem with being overweight is this: once your existing fat cells exceed their storing capacity, your body creates new and slightly different fat cells that can't be removed (except by force with liposuction). These new cells also release hormones that make you feel hungrier all the time, and they store fat faster and better than the ""original"" cells. So basically once you're overweight, your mental and physical state changes. So even if you diet and lose weight, you will require much more willpower to constantly maintain a ""healthy"" lifestyle after that.  The best thing to do is to avoid becoming fat in the first place, then you won't really need to deal with all of that in your adult age. So I think educating the young is one of the best ways to go.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bqk6g,swordfingers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:51:21 2015 UTC,"As a person with a 30.6 BMI, my weight has little to do with ""willpower, emotional intelligence, and instant gratification culture""... in the way you mean it (which is, I assume, in order: none, little, and greedy).  Addressing your points in reverse: my husband and I make everything from scratch: pasta, bread, you name it, we make it. No processed foods at all. We grow our own vegetables and fruits, raise our own chickens for eggs; we hunt and are pretty much weekday vegetarians to reduce our meat consumption. Both of us are overweight and it has nothing to do with any need for instant gratification. We make our own junk food-when we do eat it, which isn't very often-from scratch, too. No Nabisco in our house.  Emotional intelligence? Half the reason why I eat in excess is because I'm more empathetic than most. Husband has a bad day at work? Here's a pot roast, honey. My mom is sick with the flu? From-scratch chicken soup and homemade blondie bars (which I usually double and keep half). Perhaps you mean that obese people have difficulty in managing their excess emotions without food, and you may be right in that regard; but in the way that an alcoholic is more likely to relapse after a death, or a gambling addict might feel particularly lucky after a birth. When I'm stressed, my emotions have a flavor--like someone with synesthesia: brooding tastes bitter and I crave sweets; disappointment is sour and I crave salty food.  Which leads me to willpower. Anyone with an addiction problem can understand this next feeling (and the high you get from food is incredibly powerful). A craving isn't just a sensation of, ""oh, well, wouldn't that be nice?"" It's consuming. It's thinking for four days straight how delicious beef and barley soup would be; feeling disappointed at everything you eat because it's not beef and barley soup; reliving the last moment you had beef and barley soup in such vivid clarity that you can almost taste it on your tongue; and then making three different batches of beef and barley soup one day because the first wasn't savory enough, the second was too brothy and the third--with just a hint of red bell pepper chopped super-fine to give it a sweet over-flavor--ended up being perfect.  I have willpower; I have an excessive amount of willpower. I quit a twenty year habit of biting my nails, I went back to school twice as an adult and got straight A's while holding down a job and maintaining my marriage, I labored for 66 hours (that's right 66 hours; from Saturday night to Tuesday morning) to deliver my daughter vaginally because I didn't want a C-section.  So when you say that people are obese because they lack willpower, you forget that there is more to any one person's life than what they eat; and that it is acceptable for eating (or the lack of it) to consume a person's entire life. When you imply that obesity is due to a failing in their emotional intelligence, you ignore the fact that overeating is an addiction. It's a coping mechanism that I, particularly, learned as a child in order to manage the emotions from a chaotic and abusive home; and then perfected as teenage in order to hide from the advances of men after a sexual assault. The difference between the me who chose food and the me who could have chosen drugs is that if I was a recovering drug addict I wouldn't have to shoot up daily to be healthy, no one offers me a joint when I go to visit friends, and we don't go to opium dens with our spouses on our date-nights. My recovery could rest on my willpower alone because I could chose not to surround myself with reminders of my addiction.   But there is no way to remove myself from food. I have to meal-plan three meals a day, cook them, eat them, clean up after them, offer snacks to the children, feed the dog, feed the chickens, water and weed my garden, go grocery shopping, put our food away, preserve our food, make cheese, yogurt, sour cream, roll pasta dough, knead bread, soak beans, toast croutons, boil stock and dry bananas. Every single moment of my day is consumed with food; even when I'm not eating, I'm digesting, and even shitting is food-based.  And, here, we circle back to your final point about instant gratification culture. It would be easier if I subscribed to that belief. All the food apps, all the nutritionists I've talked to, all the diet advice I get, is based on a grocery-store level of instant gratification. Store-bought whole-grain sliced bread 45 calories per slice, plastic cups of yogurt, fat-free cheeses, boneless skinless chicken breasts, canned chickpeas: they are all tools of instant gratification, too. The time difference in the ""instant"" it takes to fry chicken versus the instant it takes to open a bag of frozen skillet meals is nominal compared to raising, butchering, preparing, preserving and finally cooking a chicken.  And this-- this is how I'm loosing my excess weight. By immersing myself in food, by eating good food. Eating eggs that haven't been washed in a factory, chicken that hasn't been dipped in bleach, carrots that haven't been allowed to get woody, beans that have been allowed to soak, bread that's been allowed to rise and full-fat, full-calorie dairy I make myself.  Problem is, it takes a lot longer to lose the weight than it does to put it on. My capacity for overeating will always outweigh my capacity to undereat (eating the recommended 500-1000 calorie deficit to lose weight will always get crushed by a 3000 calorie Chipotle burrito). And there will always be an extra-caloric bomb around the corner to take out any of my gains-er, losses, actually. Taco dip at a football party will always decimate my oatmeal-salad-rice'n'beans menu. Grief-eating at the week of memorial services after my aunt died will always destroy my month of ""good behavior"". A year of post-partum depression wrecked the seven prior years of balanced, mindful eating so thoroughly that even now, a year of recovery later and I'm still struggling with the emotional synesthesia I described earlier.  And I am hardly an outlier. Fat people know they're fat. It isn't news. Fat people know how they got fat. It isn't a mystery. Fat people know how to lose weight. It isn't rocket science. But when the range of healthy calorie consumption is at such a razor edge, success is longer, harder, more painful and more difficult than you can even imagine. Sometimes, for obese people, successful weight management is weight maintenance. Learning to navigate the waters of your addiction while continuing to indulge in it is CRAZY. No one asks alcoholics to quit being alcoholics while drinking just one shot of whiskey a day. Why do we expect obese people to hear ""calories in, calories out"" and click --REVELATION! Oh eM Gee, it's so EASY!! Why didn't I think of that?!?!?-- And let the weight melt off in a consistent 1-2 lbs a week. Because a couple of people did it on The Biggest Loser? It doesn't work like that.  Anyway, I'm going to shut up now, because this rant is long and kind of getting tangential. And, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get downvoted all to hell or removed by the mods for going off-topic. It just bothers me all to hell that people lack the kind of empathic imagination to think through these issues without having to be told.  And, it was pretty shitty to finger obese people for a failure in their emotional intelligence while failing to acknowledge your own lack of empathy.  Just sayin'."

That three years ago I was finally at a healthy weight; that I maintained my weight through my pregnancy and debilitating post-partum depression reversed five years of weight loss in a single year. And that the emotional struggle of weight loss isn't any easier even having done it once before.  Sheesh! I would think someone who struggled with a drug addiction would be a bit more empathetic to the process than not. How many times did you relapse before this current period of sobriety? And when you did recovered again, was it any easier having done it again?  This is the point I was trying to make; no one: not me, not you, not the people who post shit to /r/fatpeoplehate know about the internal struggles of people with addictions. We don't know if they're 1) on a diet and losing, 2) finally getting the behavioral health services that decades of no insurance denied them, 3) are simply happy with maintaining their current weight because they've enough to do caring for a parent with Alzheimer's, 4) have more mental health problems (like PTSD, for me) that need to be addressed before they can work on their weight, 5) and the list could go on. It doesn't have anything to do with ""willpower, emotional intelligence, [or] instant gratification,"" and has everything to do with the individual's personal story.  And, back on topic, OP; I think the obesity epidemic has more to do with the insanely cheap prices of corn and soy due to the government subsidizing the shit out of the crops. A hundred years ago poor people weren't fat because they couldn't afford the food to provide the excess of calories available today. Any mental health problems of the past were medicated by alcohol; which is why the Ladies of the Prohibition were able to get that amendment passed. Alcohol was the demon of the poor because it was the only drug they could afford.  The answer isn't in technology, or other alternative methods, like you suggest. Or, really even nutrition education or the availability of healthy choices (though, not knocking that! Food deserts are a real problem and nutrition education is something poor people don't receive). The answer to the obesity epidemic is wide-spread mental health services, better social services to the poor to prevent another generation of mental illness, reevaluating addiction service programs (because the AA model is not an effective one), an improvement in general education programs that service poor communities, proper childcare arrangements for single parents, etc.  We spend so much time and money treating the social symptoms of mental illness: poverty, abuse, crime, addiction; that we're like a hamster in a wheel, treating the same people generation after generation. And when we do treat mental disorders, we default to throwing pills at people rather than teaching them to cope and manage their problems and having drugs be a support tool.   Anyway, that's my two cents, /u/nobunaga_1568."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bp3y6,Poddster,2,Wed Jul 1 06:52:45 2015 UTC,"Many spacecraft have no authentication at all other than the difficulty of contacting them.  That's because the main risk to spacecraft control has not been from hackers taking over the spacecraft, it has been from technical failure.  That's why, e.g., ISEE-3 was ""easy"" for amateurs to try to take over although they ultimately weren't successful.  It's also why, for example, Captain Midnight and Max Headroom were able to hijack national comsat video feeds in the late 1980s.  Nowadays commercial satellites all use some form of shared-secret authentication before they will interpret radio commands.  As recently as five years ago, it was illegal (in the U.S.) to use encryption when communicating with a privately owned spacecraft.    That may still be technically true, but a lot of vendors are now making hardware encryption layer radios for CubeSats, and SSH is a common interface.  It's not clear to me whether the law changed, or people are simply ignoring it.  In other news, there are a lot of weirdnesses in U.S. law regarding space.  For example, if you launch and operate a spacecraft with a camera on it, you must apply for a license from NOAA first  (51 U.S. Code, §60121).  It is illegal for a U.S. citizen to attempt to take high resolution pictures of Israel from space.  (see the addendum at the end of §60121).  As near as I can tell, taking high resolution pictures of any other nation (including, say, Saudi Arabia or Nicaragua) is OK."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bo009,wbeaty,2,Wed Jul 1 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Those are good points.  I guess I was trying to suggest either catch-and-release for bugs (with enough time in between those two to try to figure out what you've caught, maybe do some natural history observations on where it was found, what it does in the time when you have it, where you released it.)  Keeping a field journal of what neat stuff you see and catch would be great.  I don't see a need for a kid (as opposed to a taxonomist) to kill and pin insects when we can now pretty easily take a few fun pictures and then let them go.  For keeping and rearing, I was thinking mainly of insects, actually.  I guess a good rule is, keep something as long as you can care for it appropriately.  If you can find a Monarch caterpillar, rear it to emergence as a butterfly, and then release it, you might very well be doing the Monarch population a favor!  My family caught common frogs, toads, and a couple of garter snakes, and kept them happy and healthy for years.  Wild turtles, chipmunks, ducks, etc. are probably harder to care for, will be unhappy if confined, and are better off left in the wild.  But observing these guys from afar, IDing them with a field guide, making notes on their behavior, are all good science/natural history experience.  Figuring out this distinction, when is okay or not okay to touch, is also probably a good life lesson.  Killing animals is a reality of life and research . . . if you did want to start dealing with that idea, you could do an earthworm dissection.  There are also companies from which you can order a properly preserved fish or frog.  I would wait until an age where your daughter could do this kind of thing in a meaningful way, by identifying organs and relating their structure to what they do, making drawings of what she sees, so it's a respectful use of the animal."

The entire world's energy use is (if I did the scratchwork right) enough to split almost five times that much water into hydrogen and oxygen, if it could be done with perfect efficiency.  So to replace California's irrigation, when the aquifers we're currently draining are depleted, we would have to move a fifth of the world's energy use to California, and convert it to hydrogen (paying the rather significant efficiency losses in order to do so).  Of course, just wasting the energy by burning the H2 is a complete non-starter, with that amount of energy."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bmo9n,dsws2,4,Tue Jun 30 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"Besides the points that others have brought up you might need to consider physical scale.  Hydrogen has a really low density, ~0.09 g/L, and it makes up about 10% of the mass of water.  That means for every L of hydrogen you have you can get about 0.9 g of water.  If you wanted a liter of water (or a kilogram)  you would need just over 1100 L of hydrogen, or a cubic meter or gas.  Using the 34,000,000 acre feet figure for water use cited by /u/dsws2  that corresponds to about 4x1013 kg of water.  That means to supply some other place with the amount of water used by California in a year you would need on the order of 4x1016 L of hydrogen gas.  A 3-5 person hot air balloon has a volume of around 3 million L, so you would need about 1x1010 balloons of that size.  That is 10 billion balloons.  Sure, you may not need to transport that much water but what I'm trying to get across is that is an enormous material cost, especially if these balloons were designed to burn up when making the water.  Also please note that in my calculations everything is assumed to be at sea level pressures.  If you are trying to ""dump"" these balloons onto mountainsides you will be at 80% of that pressure or less, meaning your balloons are likely going to expand by 20-50% from the figures I used."

Perhaps even more interesting is the idea of what might emerge out of the supergalactic level of organization. For example, at the atomic level, we find small structures basically floating in a void of empty space. Go up a few levels, and that creates the structure of life as we know it. Go up another level, and we find that we exist on a ball of matter floating in a void of empty space. Go as large as we can observe at the moment, and all these inconceivably far apart peices of matter combine to form another sort of superstructure which again begins to gain the illusion of solidity.

Most atomic processes proceed inconceivably fast compared to the microseconds that we are at the very best able to discern. Likewise it makes sense that the fastest processes relevant to higher level structures by our reckoning would be on the time scale of eons.  This is already extremely speculative, but one could look at e.g. the birth and death of stars or the stability of planetary systems to get a sense of relevant time scales, in this case billions of years. Since this is comparable to the age of the universe, emergent systems at this scale would only have had relatively short time to evolve."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bk51r,PhysicalStuff,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:21:52 2015 UTC,"As for the speed of light this could be at least partially overcome by considering the time scales.   Keep in mind I did not say light speed alone but light speed and the expansion of space   So, let's do a calculation. An average human brain is about 1.5kg. It's mostly water so to simplify calculations let's say there is at least 1 liter of water in human brain. Number of molecules of H2O in 1l is 3.346*1025.  If we multiply that with 3 we get that human brain has at least 1*1026 atoms.  Number of stars in the observable Universe is estimated to be 7x1022  So the hypothetical macrobeing might be larger than the observable Universe.    That means that due to the age of the Universe a light from one part of the being still did not reach the other end.   The expansion of space means it will never reach it.   Of course, this is all pure speculation and a lot of estimations that may be off, I am not saying it is impossible but the speed of light and expansion of space are limiting factors."

I'll also add that one should probably look at cells (neurons) rather than molecules, as the individual molecule in itself doesn't play a significant role in the brain, other than as a constituent part of larger structures.  Also, to simplify your calculation a bit, the mass of a water meloecule is ~18u, so the number of those in 1.5 kg brain would be 1.5 kg / 18 u ~ 5x1025, or 1.5x1026 atoms."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bkuxv,Ellen-Page,2,Tue Jun 30 01:23:06 2015 UTC,"In principle, yes.  Practically, no.    The basic idea of a rocket is that the fuel you need at any point was part of the payload, up until that point.  So you can keep going, by having another stage.  But your payload for the next step in the process is smaller than it would have been from launch, because your next stage is smaller than the whole rocket was at launch.    I'll assume you mean that Earth remains the same size, and its gravity increases so that g increases by a factor of 2.4.  The speed needed for orbit would increase by the same factor.    The Saturn V rocket had a mass of 2,970,000 kg, and a payload to low orbit of 118,000 kg.  So about 4% of its mass was payload.  It takes 96% of the mass to provide the rocket fuel and hardware to provide that much acceleration.   If it had to accelerate that much again (if the needed speed were doubled), 4% of its payload would be payload of the second set of stages.  So its payload would be 4% of 4% of its launch mass: 4,700 kg.  Doing it .4 of another time (a factor of 2.4 instead of doubling) means that a Saturn V's payload to low orbit would be 1290 kg.    That's a much larger satellite than Sputnik's 84kg.  But it's a lot smaller than Ariane-5's 6910kg, at the other extreme.  And it would need the huge rocket that took a crew of three to the moon and back (only two to the surface; the other stayed in lunar orbit in the command module).

AskScienceDiscussion,3bkuxv,swordfingers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:11:19 2015 UTC,"Vertical height is not exactly the issue. It's takes waaay less velocity to just get to vertical height compared to getting into the orbit of that height.   In general, in absence of atmosphere you want to avoid thrusting vertically as much as possible, as it's not efficient for the purpose of space travel. If earth didn't have any atmosphere, spacecraft would take off by raising apoapsis of its trajectory to around 15km (just to get clear of terrain) and then thrust horizontally at apoapsis to raise periapsis to the same height.   Presence of atmosphere makes takeoff more complicated, since you want to get clear of atmosphere as soon as possible, but at the same time thrusting vertically as little as you can afford not to."

They actually evolve parallell to their host in a much more intimate manner than bacteria, because they are intracellular parasites out of necessity. Every virus needs to enter a cell which means that every virus needs a way in, called a virus receptor, which is some kind of protein expressed on a cell's surface. A particular virus can only use a few (or one) specific proteins, which is the main reason behind a virus' tropism (the cells a virus is able to infect, which for instance will determine the location of symptoms). So I'd say that a virus from an era without humans has a smaller chance to infect a human than a modern virus has.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bgg7j,Lowbacca1977,2,Mon Jun 29 09:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think there's two issues, one is if the data itself is valid, the other is if the statistical tests used are valid.  For the former, I think one can technically never 'know', but one can attempt to see if there's unaccounted for effects. A great example of this was the 'faster than the speed of light' discovery where they very publicly asked for input as to where they might've had a systematic effect.  For the latter, there's a big push, at least in astronomy, from some people to improve the understanding of statistics to improve results. There's been some specific examples I know of where the debates have focused entirely on if certain statistical methods are valid or not in establishing discoveries. In particular, it's been about if certain planet discoveries are statistically significant or not, and what the best fit models are for data."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bgg7j,WRCousCous,2,Mon Jun 29 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"I collect data myself or train people to collect data. The only time I don't know the provenance is if I'm doing re-analysis or meta-analysis. Even then, I'm usually familiar with the protocols, the researchers, and the statistical methods employed. When you're familiar with a certain kind of data, you start to recognize anomalies. In these cases, the normal practice is to repeat the experiment. Are the new results comparable to the 'anomalous' set? If so, then you might be working with a new phenomenon. If not, then one or the other likely contains systemic or collection errors. Again, the solution is to repeat the experiments. This is how hypotheses are both tested and generated.  I think there is a grave misconception about 'data' making the rounds over the last few years, and I believe it is unfairly undermining confidence in science. I suspect it has a lot to do with various biomedical sciences, where tests are ferociously expensive and situated in ethical minefields. However, 90% of science doesn't operate in those conditions. I can (and do) repeat experiments in the field or greenhouse regularly... if I didn't, reviewers would think I was absolutely insane (or perpetrating fraud). My field (plant ecology and plant-fungal symbiosis) isn't dominated by bad statistics, gaming p-values, or bad data practices. We still suffer from public misperception of how statistics, error, and hypothesis testing works.  If you want to rephrase this in terms of the biomedical field (or some other 'suspect' field where statistical skullduggery is perceived to be rampant by the public), by all means do so. But I really wish people would quit generalizing publication and statistical analysis issues to science as a whole.

Let's call it 1 light year. The volume of the sun and planets is tiny compared to 4/3 pi (1 light year)3 = 3.5*1051 L. The mass of that air would thus be the density of air times 3.5*1051 L, or 2.2*1018 solar masses! That much mass has a Swartzchild radius of 7*1021 meters, or 14 times the galaxy's radius! Thus, the solar system, and the entire galaxy, would promptly collapse into a supermassive black hole. Gives some perspective on how huge and empty the solar system is."

Assuming that is true (EDIT: Which it isn't), how long do you think this process would take?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3bfkzz,jakeOmega,18,Sun Jun 28 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Nope, it actually is dense enough to immediately become a black hole. The event horizon of a black hole is given by r_s = 2GM/c2 where M is the mass of the black hole. So, the density needed to form a black hole, as a function of mass, is given by density = M/(4/3 pi r_s3) = 3c6 /(32 G3 pi) M-2 . The constants don't really matter here, but the important point is that the density is proportional to one over the square of the mass - as the mass increases, the density needed decreases! For a black hole with a mass as large as this one (2 million trillion solar masses), the necessary density becomes very small. Much smaller than the density of air, in fact. It's certainly counter intuitive, but you only need high densities for ""small"" black holes.  One of the assumptions of general relativity is that the stress energy tensor is divergenceless, so I can't really answer the question of what happens if all that stuff suddenly pops into existence - it directly contradicts one of the assumptions of the theory I'd be using to predict what happens. But, if there ever were a situation in which all that matter was in that configuration, it would necessarily be inside a black hole."

AskScienceDiscussion,3bfkzz,qaurky,3,Sun Jun 28 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"All life on earth would be crushed to death maybe, or swept away by wind, depending on how the magic works.  then...  All the planets would melt and fall into the sun.  Now I am assuming there is some magical forces that are preventing the planets and the sun from absorbing the air, or that something is replenishing the bubble. Without the magical forces, see the super-massive black-hole answer elsewhere in this thread.  But here are the dominant things:  (1) You've added a lot of ""atmospheric pressure"" to the atmosphere of every planet. Many miles of that atmosphere. So the height of the atmosphere is literally the reach of gravity. Now you've been kind enough to give us some magic that's keeping thing at 1 atmosphere in the vast expanse so this sort of of goes away.  (2) The planets, no longer orbiting through empty space, have to push the atmosphere of empty space around using their momentum to move the atmosphere. They will slow down quickly. Slower orbits are smaller orbits, so all the planets steadily approach the sun, as they slow, they fall. This could be oblivated by the magical field, but that depends on how magical the field actually is.  (2a) since the atmosphere of the sun is thicker as you approach the sun, the further you fall the faster you slow and the faster you fall. But again, magical field might take this away.  (3) Every solar event, every coronal mass ejection and whatnot, is now happening ""in an atmosphere"" instead of in space. So they cause pressure waves like any other explosion. These are explosions of a scale you literally cannot imagine as they dwarf the earth and are often as wide as the orbit of mercury. So the sound of a quiet sun is deafening and the sound of a prominent sun is earth-shattering. No magical help here, the normal variance of ""one atmosphere of pressure"" lets this energy be delivered just fine. Abet stretched over a wider time.  (4) The atmosphere now conducts the heat of the sun. So we don't just get the radiant heat but we get the conductive heat. So the instant the bubble is formed we start to freeze because the air is acting like a blanket to keep the ""warming light"" away from us. But the air quickly heats from trapping nearly 100% of the energy output from the sun. So the air around the earth steadily rises in temperature like a pot of water on the stove. Magic field is zero help with this one.  The vacuum of space is our friend and we'd be boned without it in endless ways."

AskScienceDiscussion,3beqdh,AnecdotallyExtant,6,Sun Jun 28 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. The dominant fraction of the air is nitrogen at some 78% of total volume. No natural process ""wants to"" make carbon or oxygen bond with the nitrogen. This is why it's possible to make nitrousoxide in the lab but the atmosphere doesn't ""catch fire"" and convert to NO2 spontaneously.  Virtually no organism produces carbon monoxide or any other trace gas. Methane is unstable and breaks down in sunlight. And now we are sort of out of alternative gasses produced by living organisms.  So since we are talking about the side effects of life, the pathways and result gasses are fairly limited.  The parent poster isn't exactly correct either since there would be a lot more carbolic acid raining from the sky as the CO2 went up...  But the parent poster is close enough to correct to be taken safely at face value as a proper guess.  The main features here are the ""partial pressures"" of the gasses and the fact that CO2 is heavy.  Many factors would prevent the OP question from coming to pass as asked since the total body mass needed to ""use up"" that much oxgen by breathing would itself have used up a lot of the carbon and the oxygen just by existence.  The much bigger problem is, of course, that if we could dig up all the fossil fuels and burn them all at once we'd achieve a disastrous percentage point or two of change in the partial pressure of oxygen and that would be like everybody moving a mile or two straight up in terms of how much oxygen we'd be taking in with each breath.  Not a lot of condos on Everest, you know. So reducing the overall partial pressure of oxygen by even two percent would likely make human existence ""extremely uncomfortable"" in even the lowest of elevations.  Be it the oxygen partial pressure loss, or the carbon dioxide poisoning, using up the oxygen and increasing the carbon content of the air is a freaking nightmare in very small percentages.  Gas exchange rules are tricky. But the number of ""per gas"" exchanges in the free atmosphere is very limited."

Feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best.  First, a little philosophy of science: a scientific theory must be falsifiable. This is a major point attributed to Karl Popper (written some time in the 1950s, I think). That is, a theory must be framed/phrased in a way that testable hypotheses can be derived from it. This is why any view that relies on invisible forces (religion, astrology, homeopathy) are not science.  Evolutionary psychology fails because we don't have access to what exactly drove human evolution thousands of years ago. End of story. Evolutionary explanations can be very appealing, some are non-controversial and can be useful for understanding the world, but there is also a history of evolutionary theories being misused. Scholarly feminist writing details some of these event very well. I'm not interested to detail those case studies here. Just recall some third Reich propoganda: ""those people have been rats throughout history. They are rats now."" These types of attitudes become self-fulfilling and self-reinforcing. Humanist morality requires that we not let ourselves be drawn in by these types of arguments.

I know redpill lives to obsess about how women want money, power (alpha), tall handsome guys. I'm sure that could be verified in a laboratory, but that's just behavioral economics. Everyone likes money. Everyone likes attractive things. But, attributing them to evolutionary forces that happened thousands of years ago is a giant leap of logic that simply cannot be sustained from a series of experiments."

If you somehow slowed down a photon's speed, then you have also somehow altered the mixing of space-time, and vice versa.

The presence of c in the formula for the photon momentum is a consequence of the photon's masslessness, as is its invariant speed of c; and the reason why c appears in both of those places is the same.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bd8he,matts2,2,Sun Jun 28 08:21:10 2015 UTC,So the photon moves at c but propagates slower in a medium due to those absorptions and emittances causing us to experience the photons traveling slower through things like air (in a practical sense)?
AskScienceDiscussion,3bd8he,Montzterrr,2,Sun Jun 28 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"That's another (although a lower level) lie to understand things.

AskScienceDiscussion,3bd8he,diazona,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:25:04 2015 UTC,"Why is it wrong? I mean I have no trouble being corrected but ""that's just wrong"" isn't exactly a helpful correction, and what I wrote does seem to mesh with what I could find on the topic.  I thought I was pretty clear about drawing the line between classical and relativistic mass and momentum.  I thought I was pretty clear about the frequency shift.  I thought the case was pretty clear that since the energy remains constant as the photon enters and leaves the gravity well the frequency shifts according to the various frames occurs, but effectively the passage through the gravity inclines nets a zero change of actual frequency.  The only way that I am aware of to change the ""momentum"" of a photon is to have it transfer it's energy to an electron and then have the photon re-emitted at a different energy. (That is you can't actually change the momentum of a photon, you can only replace the photon.)  Also since photons experience effectively no time (since they are moving at the speed of light) the term for ""acceleration"" becomes problematic.  Also since photons are themselves the force carrier, they cannot ""bounce off"" each other and change their frequencies, they can only reenforce or cancel their energetic intensity, which is why the double-slit experiemnt doesn't produce a rainbow it produces an interference pattern of intensity.  I didn't get too esoteric but I thought I made the points accessible.  If I'm bat-shit crazy wrong I'd like to know what I am misunderstanding instead of just being down-voted. 8-)  And if I'm ""not even wrong"" then a link to where I should start for correcting that would be welcome as well."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bd8he,BitOBear,3,Sun Jun 28 10:40:12 2015 UTC,"OK, I didn't get into it because a lot of people aren't interested in learning. But here's what I picked up on:   A photon, strictly speaking, doesn't have mass,   true   so it doesn't have momentum per se, because momentum (p) equals mass [e.g. the mass of the object at rest] (m) times velocity (v).   Not true; different kinds of physical systems have different formulas for momentum. In the case of a photon it's p=E/c=hf. p=mv simply doesn't apply; it's only an approximation that works for slow-moving objects.   But then again the zero-mass photon is a photon ""at rest""   This is not true because photons have zero mass, but they are not at rest, as you go on to point out.   and that doesn't happen because photons are always moving at the speed of light in every frame of reference.   That's true.   But since it is the rest mass we care about, the ""m"" is zero and so the ""p"" is zero even though ""v = C"" because it's moving at the speed of light.   I already covered that.   It's all tied to that thing where sometimes it's a wave and sometimes its a particle.   I guess this is debatable but I wouldn't put it that way. The fact that photons act like particles sometimes and waves sometimes is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, whereas the fact that p=mv doesn't apply to them has more to do with relativity.   And that isn't that it changes from one to the other back and forth at whim. There are just these conflicting sets of traits that makes it both depending on the needs of the interaction.   That's close enough to true, I guess. I glossed over that part on the first reading.   The photon is a special case, it turns out. When you look at the classical (non relativity) equations we have a problem that there is a problematic divide-by-zero when dealing with photons.  So you can't solve E=mc2 for a photon, and most of the equations with ""m"" in them don't work. That includes the change in velocity and force implied by the newtonian gravity F=GM1M2/r2 .  That pesky M1 being equal to zero means that gravity exerts no classical force on the photon itself. Absent that classical force there is no acceleration applied, and so no loss of momentum.   Strictly speaking, the ""classical force"" on the photon is zero, but that's only because you're talking about applying an equation to a system that is far outside its domain of applicability. In a way, it's kind of irresponsible to do that.   So photons have, and can deliver energy,   True   because the energy is encoded in the relationship between frequency and time (E=ht)   There is no such relationship. You might be thinking of the energy-time uncertainty principle, which is totally different.   and gravity and motion cause apparent shifts in frequency and time   True   and gravity curves space itself.   Spacetime, not just space, but basically yes.   The leap you have to make is to understand that all the ways you have learned to think about things that exists naturally depend on mass. And for most thing and models that's just fine. To a very real extent a proton or a neutron are like very tiny rubber balls. They have mass and the smack into things and all that.   That seems reasonable   But the photon and the electron (and some others I think) have these pesky zeros in their math that makes the classical rubber ball logic not apply.   I really have no idea what you mean here.   So basically, if you could see the photon from the side, from a god's eye view if you will, when you had the photon moving away from the mass you imagine you would see its frequency change. But you'd also see time moving at a slower speed all around it, and as the photon escaped that gravity it would escape the time dilatation and so the frequency would return to the frequency you saw before it went in. Indeed you'd ""see the photon frequency slow"" because everything in the gravity well is going slower. But as it left the well it would appear to speed back up because that the speed of time out here beyond the strong gravity.   That part is okay, I think.   But if a nice green light photon out here, were to hit the eye of something in there, it would still be a nice green light photon to them because that observer had been slowed down just as much as the photon frequency because that's how time is right then and there. The energy of the photon didn't change, so the apparent frequency didn't change. Time just got a little loopy there compared to here.   Assuming you're talking about gravitational time dilation, that's not true. A green (for example) photon falling into a gravity well will actually have a different frequency when measured by an observer inside the gravitational field. (People have done experiments to test this.) The gravitational frequency shift isn't canceled out by the time dilation; it's actually caused by the time dilation, in a way."
AskScienceDiscussion,3bd8he,diazona,0,Sun Jun 28 11:04:00 2015 UTC,"So ""most of what I said"" isn't wrong...   Not true; different kinds of physical systems have different formulas for momentum. In the case of a photon it's p=E/c=hf. p=mv simply doesn't apply; it's only an approximation that works for slow-moving objects.   My understanding of E=mc2 is that the E represents the energy of the particle's existence regardless of it's frame of reference, and so regardless of it's momentum, which is relative. (And as I kept typing and looked some stuff up I got an inkling of what I was getting wrong here and need to think on it some more. 8-)  And as far as cutting sentences in half regarding the photon being at rest, the point of that sentence was to translate the idea for a complete layman, so it's a sentence Designed to point out the contradiction you admit is true. e.g. think of it as a ""... but since cats are not fish you it doesn't help if you ..."" kind of logical construct.  (Totally wrong about including the electron in the zeros comment, I got ahead of myself with another poitnt that I then removed and that's sort of a fossil. 8-)   Assuming you're talking about gravitational time dilation, that's not true.

(People have done experiments to test this.) The gravitational frequency shift isn't canceled out by the time dilation; it's actually caused by the time dilation, in a way.   Really? I was not aware of this experiment. I thought since the photon was slowing and the observer was slowing the photon remained in sync with the time, and that this was why red/blue shift due to the relative movements of the origin and destination were reliable regardless of the mass of the origin and destination.  What experiment is this? Does the observer see a red shift or a blue shift inside the well? I would like to read about it."

Not much because of the vastness of space even a small change in its trajectory would cause it to miss us as the small change in its trajectory would grow to many km. This ofcourse is only possible if we can get there in time to somehow change its trajectory. Altough in 1 year im not so sure that this will work. We might need some more time to construct a vessel and travel to the astroid. The huge size of the astroid is also a big problem. To affect its trajectory will not be easy.

Your body would endure less stress the lower the gravity, so your bones would probably be comparatively weaker and lighter. This would make you more agile in the new environment, while possibly still being about as resistant to breaking during as a fall as on Earth, since they would need to absorb less energy in that situation.  The only other issue that might crop up relates to atmospheric pressure. The oxygen ratio would have to be larger in comparison to Earth's (~21%) or else you will have trouble breathing. Training in these conditions will make it easier to manage, but you'll really struggle once you get to mountaintop conditions. However, this isn't really a fair comparison since gravity is not significantly different between sea level and the top of even Mt.

We used to strangely believe this was some vestigial hunk of dumb flesh.  Now scientists suppose that this little pocket that sometimes gives us trouble, might just be the hidey hole for our gut flora to avoid being wiped out by a food-borne pathogen.  The Earth's biosphere has some places like that, places which would carry micro-organic life, if not some tiny insects, crustaceans, plankton of other strange life like the King of the Jungle: Tardigrades   Places like pockets of pre-Ice Age water still frozen under the Arctic and Antarctic Ice.  Tiny cracks in the Earth's crust miles down harboring bacteria.  Thermal vents at the most inaccessible reaches of the ocean's depths.  As easy as it seems to have been to totally fuck up the Earth's ecosystem the geological nanosecond since the Industrial Revolution, I don't see any likely scenario wiping out All Life on Earth, except these two:  1) A large enough asteroid strike to ""re-molten-ize"" the crust like the Moon Event.  Or  2) Freakishly SuperMassive Solar Storm irradiates the entire planet   After those, I'd wager that the Earth would lose its atmosphere, so I wouldn't think the Biosphere could survive.  Then again, the energy of the solar storm might be mitigated by an entire ocean, or the ice, or the mantel above a subsurface bacteria colony.  And we may find on Mars if Life can exist in a planet's crust or surface without much of an atmosphere.  Guess what I'm saying is - this planet and I'd imagine any rocky planet that shares Earth's general volcanic, atmospheric, and hydrological features and some rotational tilt would be discovered to harbor certain areas of energy density where life could theoretically take hold and settle into a ecological niche, or be trapped by physical forces in places that would be safe from large-scale catastrophic events like an asteroid strike or a rapid climactic shift."

We certainly can't compute the complete state vector of a human brain at the molecular level, and we may well never be able to. But since we don't know precisely how all of the various biophysical processes of the brain actually represent and store our state of consciousness, computing that state vector is the least of the hurdles on the track to developing human-like sentience in a synthetic substrate."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b8dnc,zeronezeronezero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"The Human Brain Project needs to be completed before transhumanism is possible. The project requires us to understand the brain on every relevant level(which is likely everything down to molecular and above atomic), we need to develop the computing power to actually run the simulation and then find a way to translate our complete knowledge of the brain and all it's functions into a computer. It's a ridiculously huge undertaking.  I don't think the Human Brain Project itself will be successful. Thanks to Moore's law, we could easily have the technology to run the simulation in 10 years, but there are soooo many steps to go before we can even simulate even the most basic functions of a human brain, let alone transfer someone's consciousness into it.  I do, however, think that it will eventually succeed. There's no real reason why we can't eventually do all of these things, but 10 years with very little resources being poured into it is not even close to enough."

I agree with hstarbird11 that it is highly unlikely but no one can be sure of anything 100%.  the body is made of organs/tissues that are made of cells that are made of all sorts of molecules. The idea of cryogenics is as real to me as the teleportation by the mean of dissembling on atomic level and assembling back. Why? Because of the chemical composition of a cell. Without going into deep biology it is clear that freezing the warmblooded animal cell will freeze the water in it and formed ice crystals would deform the cells and lead to mechanical damage. Why some organisms can survive freezing? Because they evolved in the way that makes their cells to not be damaged at low temps by the virtue of the molecules the cells possess. The molecules that would protect the cellular structure by either reducing the freezing temperature of the cell (so it is not completely frozen below zeroC) or by making it ""flexible"" when frozen (high lipids content). It took million years for them to evolve. We are different on the molecular level and even if we think up some solvent that we can infuse our body such that it penetrates every cell to sustain the freezing without damage, I extremely doubt the body can survive such infusion (but you never know). That one possibility I can manage to think of, and if combined with some invented strategies to suspend the life at low near ceased metabolic state that would allow for this infusion to happen without killing the body, then ok, why not? However, I would not like to wake up from that because coming back to normal will be like the worst hungover humanity can conceive."

AskScienceDiscussion,3b8dnc,BitOBear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the waking up, it's the freezing. So for the existing frozen folk the damage is already done.  Everyone frozen so far has been lacking one incredible element. Antifreeze.  When you freeze water it expands and gets pointy.  When certain organisms freeze, as they freeze, their cells go into this sort of emergency mode and saturate the cell interiors with an antifreeze (like I think several kinds of frogs use glucose). This antifreeze prevents the big sharp ice crystals from forming and expanding and cutting up or rupturing the cells from inside.  Unfortunately nobody knows how to make human cells do this. And we haven't invented an externally applicable antifreeze that will soak into the cells and protect them.  So everyone frozen to date is basically mush. Virtually all of their cells have been damaged. The current hope is that eventually science will develop a technology (such as nano-machines) that can be introduced into the frozen tissue to repair the ruptured cells one-at-a-time but all-at-once as the body is thawed.  Another possibility is the ""Corpsicle"" process envisioned by Larry Niven in his novels, where in the future people are re-embodied. A donor body, usually a criminal or a clone, is prepared. A special machine reads the neural net as the body thaws (pulping the brain in the process, so it only works once) and encodes what it finds into the donor body.  The real hope is that in the near future we'll develop the necessary antifreeze or a means of causing our bodies to do it themselves.  Those people will be relatively easy to wake if they were fully intact when put to sleep. With a proper antifreeze you'd just warm the blood and body quickly and then shock the heart.  The only other really tricky part is the way the brain sabotages itself when it's deprived of oxygen. Restoring the oxygen too fast causes a kind of cascade of death. I forget what its called. So there is likely to be a thing where the person has most of the oxygen displaced in their blood by something like breathing pure nitrogen for the last two minutes of life. Then the blood oxygen level would be restored slowly as the body is thawed or something.  so sure, there's some tricky bits but compared to the ice crystal problem the other stuff is almost commonplace already.  So like with most technologies, the earlier adopters get a worse deal and are the least likely to get their investment back. The people already frozen may stay that way till they are discarded or until medicine advances a heck of a lot. But in another fifty years we may well have ambulances that have cryokits in them to freeze people on scene so they don't die in transit.  The true moral question is why in the hell would anybody want to defrost someone who died/was frozen more than half a lifetime ago. Once your immediate family is gone what is the point of bringing you back? What will you offer this future time? Niven also explored that question somewhat in his novels.  For instance, you pay someone to freeze you at death. Two hundred years later they know they can wake you up. But other than wanting to ask you what 2015 was really like, what skills will you add to that world. Will resurrecting your presumptions and prejudices (we all have them, nothing personal) really do anything but stir the pot?  Seriously if I had a giant can with a pull tab that read ""guy, 1815"" and you knew you could wake him by pulling the tab, would you? Wouldn't you then be responsible for seeing to this guy's needs pretty much for the rest of his life?  So the technology for short term freezing (e.g. up to a couple of days), or for freezing people for long space trips, has foreseeable use. But if you aren't someone famous and that someone want's to collect or interview, or some famous artist, there's no reason for someone to go through all the trouble of resurrecting some eighties day trader who happened to make it rich."

We've got really good records of 2015, at least the parts where there's enough spare money running around for a random guy to freeze himself. The records will survive longer than the physical task of keeping the bodies frozen.  Besides, have you met us? A man of letters might be worth getting a living history lesson from, but the average person is full of so many urban legends and ""fox news facts"" that such a living history would be nearly counter-factual.  So suppose some one-percenter is frozen and defrosted five hundred years from now and asked about the first black president...  How about a truther? or a holocaust denier?  Living history is unreliable once it's removed from its living context. We can trust the living history of a living old person because we have the context to know which parts were fabrication.

On the other side, part of the United State's meta-strategy during the Cold War was to terrorize the Soviets by making them think we were crazy and/or stupid enough to actually do it and destroy all life on Earth if we had to.  Post Cold War estimates of the consequences tend to side with Sagan.

Especially because, sort of by definition, whatever is inside a black hole has to be so dense that it can't be anything other than a black hole.

If two things look the same size from the body you are standing on they will exert pretty much the same tidal forces.  So its not a case of mars need a moon 1/4 of its size but one that appears to be the same size as ours to get the same tidal effects we do.  A consequence of this is that the moon and the sun exert similar tidal forces on the earth because they appear to be roughly the same size (which is why we have eclipses) and mars' tiny moon exerts a similar tidal force on mars itself that the sun does because they are also a similar apparent size from mars (the similarity is less than here on earth though).  So you could tow a smaller amount of material to mars but park it a lot closer than the moon is to earth to get large tides.

Rather we get the Deep Western Boundary Current which passes by New Zealand from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and upwells in the North Pacific and warms up; the Arctic only has major influence on this current in the North Atlantic near Greenland as shown here.  This to me would suggest there wouldn't be far reaching global influences, but I must confess I do not know for sure. Apparently there is a current called the 'Bering Current' though I couldn't find any papers suggesting it was particularly important.  It is worth remembering though evidence points to there being a land bridge during the last glaciation so this has been closed off in the past.  Now if you're saying there is absolutely no arctic ocean, with greenland connected to Europe and such, if his was far enough south then I'd imagine this could very significantly disrupt the global thermal circulation. What this would mean is naturally hard to guess, but it is widely believed the closing of the Panama Isthmus is the primary cause of the onset of Quaternary Glaciation, by bringing moist warm air through the gulf stream and allowing the buildup of major icesheets in the northern hemisphere. Perhaps had the arctic been closed off the system would not form the global conveyor and the gulf stream would not exist, and due to this there would be no more glacial-interglacial cycles. Someone with a bit more knowledge on the subject could probably give you a more accurate answer though, this is essentially speculation on my part."

That would be striking, but it's not what's going on here. The researchers are the ones generating the images. They send the neural network an image, check its response, and then gradually shift the image so that the network will give a more and more positive response.  The important result here is that if you train a neural network to pattern-match a banana, and then artificially construct an image the neural network strongly matches, the image will contain curvy yellow things. This shows that it is indeed the curviness and yellowness that's being recognized, not some other feature that happens to be present in bananas."

You absolutely can use a permanent magnet moving past a wire to generate electricity. That's how a lot of small generators and motors work, and how most demonstration generators work in classrooms.  But chunks of neodymium aren't free. Almost every generator you see will use an electromagnet instead of a permanent magnet and then move an armature coil past the electromagnet. These are called wound-field alternators. Providing power to the electromagnet makes it less efficient and creates a situation where car alternators need a bit of power to turn on the electromagnet to start making power. On the other hand, cheap vs $$$. There's also limits to the maximum strength of a permanent magnet but the limit to the strength of an electromagnet is when it melts or crushes itself."

[ m2 / s5 ] = 1/2 ∫ (dACCL(AP) / dt)2 + (dACCL(ML) / dt)2   JERKiness on two different axes needs to be squared in order to be combined.

The jerk cost function (which has those units) is the integral of the square of jerk wrt to time, which is the same as wh44 function for equal jerks on different axes, although wh44's explanation is more complete, in that it is more likely that you will have different jerks and thus you would take the integral of the sum of squares of the two different jerks."

What the balloon analogy means is there is no center to the surface of a balloon. Quite evidently there is a center of mass or volume to the balloon, but that is not what the analogy is trying to get at.  Edwin Hubble said it best:    ...if we see the nebulae all receding from our position in space, then every other observer, no matter where he may be located, will see the nebulae all receding from his position. However, the assumption is adopted. There must be no favoured location in the Universe, no centre, no boundary; all must see the Universe alike. And, in order to ensure this situation, the cosmologist, postulates spatial isotropy and spatial homogeneity, which is his way of stating that the Universe must be pretty much alike everywhere and in all directions.   No matter where you go in the universe, everything will appear to be moving away from you. This is incompatible with a model where there is a central point, away from which everything is expanding.

If that is true then the protests do not have logical or common sense motivation, therefore they cannot be argued against in rational manner in short term. However, pointing out that it is a fools errand, a non realistic desire that will only cause the opposite current status quo to get strengthened, and pointing out that the positive sides of project would directly help the native population and preserve the mountains from much worse abuse should eventually weigh over that emotional-political movement, if someone could keep fighting it and win over by attrition of reasonable arguments and facts."

AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,BizouBisou,7,Thu Jun 25 05:27:40 2015 UTC,The basic concept is called abiogenisis. A simple search of the term will give you plenty of sources and definitions explaining the theory. The idea though is that through non-living organic material a self-replicating string of molecules formed. Then through evolution it evolved into ever more complex forms until it became all of the biodiversity that has ever existed. Quite amazing when you really think about it. I'm rather partial to Richard Dawkins explaination in his book The Selfish Gene. If you are truly interested in this topic I definitely recommend picking it up.  As to how this process started is unknown and I imagine it will always will be. We will never find fossils of these early progenitors and recorded history doesn't quite go back to those primeval times. The predominate theory as to how it got kick started is through natural process with the chemicals that naturally formed in earths early oceans. The Miller-Urey and subsequent experiments have proven this possible in the lab.
AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,benoit_couilles,2,Thu Jun 25 07:08:41 2015 UTC,"One theory is that life began at an undersea vent. This theory is attractive for a few reasons:  -Hot gases diffuse into the cold background water, there is a temperature gradient that allows many different reactions to occur even if they require different temperatures.  -There is no day night cycle or temperature variations that could denature RNA or ribozymes  -Organisms are already known to use chemicals in these vents for energy  -Radiation is blocked by water  While there is some evidence, it is certainly not definitive. You can read more on the Wikipedia page for abiogenesis."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,K281067,4,Thu Jun 25 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer :: This is a very ""lay explanation"" and you have to be very careful looking the following up on-line -- and as always I highly recommend fact checking things including my own words -- as there is a bunch of creationists polluting the relevant search terms like ""origin of life and molecular entropy"" with ""a lot of hooie"".)  So recent chemical analysis suggests that a lot of the chemical precursors for life are actually naturally preferred by entropy. That is, at rest, some amino acids and similar long-chain molecules are essentially inevitable after energy passes through a medium full of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.  So we can actually see the radio/light emission spectra of free floating methane and amino acids in space because energy likes to pass through space.  Basically the idea is that given a large enough but contained sampling region, say a planet covered in water and carbon, things like electric discharge (lightning) or thermionic events (lava, ocean vents) will cause very low entropy states (energetic molecular reactions) that then settle out to complex molecules like proteins and amino acids.  It's sort of like a taffy pull. You crush the hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon close together really hard and it will make lumps. Then you let the energy drain away and those lumps are stretched out and bits spring loose, and sometimes weird little stretchy chains of atoms are left sticking out of the lumps or fall off the lumps in little coherent pieces. [Chemistry is wonderfully mechanical once you get the hang of the rules for how things attach together like little 3D Lego. Indeed get a big box full of Lego and shake it for a while and you'll see fragments and clumps start to form. As long as there's ""enough"" energy, but not too much, stuff just loves to clump at the macro and the atomic chemistry levels.]  Keep repeating this day in and day out on a planetary scale and it's not at all unlikely that steady paths from low to high entropy (e.g. high to low concentrations of energy) would form. Some of these paths are pretty obscure but persistent, like a trickle of water passing from one metal to another, or a crack that's constantly vomiting hot water and metal ions into a larger body of water. Or a particular high outcrop of rocks that get struck by lightning all the time. And some are just globs paste or films of goo or layers of salt. And some are individual molecules that have a positive end and an negative end. Indeed each water molecule has a positive part and two negative parts, which is why it ""lines up"" into ice when you cool it. These pathways form constantly and at every level, so much so that we have to do things like shake and stir stuff when we try to make useful stuff like plastic, or glue, or, you know, dinner.  So life is, at its essence, just a pathway for energy flow. But a pathway that uses that energy as it goes along instead of just trowing that energy to the ground.  Now keep in mind that this doesn't imply that the complexity of life violates thermodynamics or entropy. Both sunlight and radio-thermal decay are powering life on earth.  All chemical processes involved in life as we know it, are processes where a high energy concentration is being dissipated. Photons enter leaf and leaf uses that energy to make sugar. Sugar enter cell and mitochondria oxidize the sugar to make ATP. ATP attaches to various molecular machines and unwinds (well, sheds a phosphate) to ADP, powering those machines basically like a spring or an electric battery.  So here's this planet and it's being bombarded by energy. Most of it is heat and electricity. And there's this vast sea of stuff where that energy is being taken from high concentration to low concentration, be it a thermal vent or a momentary electrical hot-spot caused by lightning or other ""static electric"" causes.  And molecules start being changed when they drift into those pathways where energy is moving from high to low concentration.  And that energy ""traumatizes"" those molecules, causing them to stick to one another in some really bizarre and useless ways.  But then entropy acts on those very-high-energy globs and they straighten themselves out, or really kink up or whatever, into a much more relaxed (higher entropy, lower energy) forms like amino acids and such. Then more energy comes along and jams those acids into globs, which again relax into proteins.  This continues for like a billion years all over the whole of the earth and eventually some of these globs get convoluted enough to start doing things like collecting peer molecules and making copies of themselves. So like there's this glob and some lightning hits the water over a ways, and the distance is good so the glob gets just enough electricity and it spasms mechanically and the amino acids that are stuck to it like lint on a sweater are jostled into a chain of proteins as well. And now there are two of these proteins hanging around getting lint and another lightning flashes and...  Lather. Rinse. Repeat.  Now nobody knows exactly what these first molecules looked like. Individual molecules do not fossilize. And we don't have a planet sized laboratory and a billion years to repeat the experiment.  But 100% of what we know about materials. And electricity. And energy dissipation. And the likely chemical make up of the surface of the earth. And chemistry in general... all agree that this scenario is totally possible in the time, volume, temperatures, and conditions we believe were present at the time.  So really, life isn't terribly complex to begin with. And once it's started there is plenty of energy and circumstance to push life up the evolutionary hill towards more complex and more varied structures."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,BitOBear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:31:45 2015 UTC,Would not a scientific mind take all available information into consideration before making any claims?   The fact there are billions of people alive today on this planet who believe the creation account together with the observation of what is described in the very first book of the Bible (Genesis) can not be disproven by science along with actualy agreeing with modern science on the precusrors to life and all this recorded long before any scientific understanding was founded all add up to a very convincing explanation of why we are all here and not only that but gives purpose for existing now as well as hope for the future in that the Earth and mankind will have a far closer relationship with The Creator than what they do now. The creation account differs from any unproven scientific theory (i.e The Theory Of Evolution and The Big Bang Theory) in that the creation account was inspired by an eye witness of the creation of all things. There are many top scientists who have a deeper faith in the creation account due to what they can observe all around them.
AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,Balderick,3,Fri Jun 26 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"No. As the scientific mind is compelled to know the difference between ""information"" and ""evidence"".  For instance I could say ""unicorns cause weather patterns when they fly"". This is now ""information"", but it's not ""evidence"". It has no basis in fact. And if I can convince a million people to repeat it, that still doesn't make it true. Science requires evidence, and evidence is more that a formation of words into information.  Additionally science doesn't bear the burden of disproving Genesis. Religion bears the burden of proving it ""largely correct"" because science has already demonstrated it to be factually inconsistent with the evidence.  And genesis, if you actually read it, is thoroughly demonstrated as not consistent with the facts by direct observation.  So, for instance, genesis says there is day and night days before there is sun and moon. Science knows that ""day"" is a function of the sun being in line-of-sight to a particular section of the earth. Night is the absence of that alignment. And ""the morning"" and ""the evening"" are the coming and going of such alignments. Day, night, morning, and evening are all used as references in Genesis. So again, science says ""nope"".  Genesis posits a fundament and a firmament and an eternal volume of water (""the deep"") from which the land was called forth. We know there is no such eternal volume of water. Genesis literally says the earth has a ceiling! Check it out there is a great picture here. {note that the previous link is even a christian operated site. But the pictures demonstrate just how non-scientific ti all is. Science knows, for instance, that no such ceiling exists because, you know, outer space... we can see and measure it... because science... (that alone disproves Genesis).  Moving on... Who was the ""eye witness"" you speak of? I'll even accept the name of the individual as he appears in scripture as an answer to this one. Who was there to objectively observe the calling forth of the land from the sea? (Seriously have you even Read Genesis?) There is no such entity named in any christian, jewish, or muslim text. Sorry.  So here we have you, yourself, creating a story element from whole cloth. This ""witness"" of which you speak. A complete fabrication not even present in the scenario you are presenting.  So if you are so free to add to the story, why should I assume your predecessors felt no such freedom?  Once a complex claim is shown to be at least partially false, the rest of the claim can be discarded as inaccurate.  Talking of unnamed ""top scientists"" who have ""deeper faith"" is an appeal to anonymous authority.  Faith is literally the belief of something absent evidence. So by definition proof and faith are orthogonal.  Believe what you want, but the physical record demonstrates that your creation myth is no more (or less) valid than The Serpent and The Rainbow, or the various versions where people are shat or vomited out by the various gods.  If you read more, or you know, actually read the bible and the Torah you'd know how laughable genesis.  For instance in the original text, after all that Adam and Eve stuff, their kids marry women ""from a nearby town"". Talk about punting the ball at the last second.  We know by simple genetics that Adam and Eve can't be correct.  We know ""irreducible complexity"" is, in fact, a fraud, as every example of such has been shown to have some, and sometimes many, reduced complexity precursors.  Really, I know you want what you said to be true, but its not. Genesis is scientifically impossible and has been proved scientifically invalid. Enough that the pope, several popes back, ceded the point.    Now here is a new thought for you...  Did you know that the ""biblical literalism argument"" you are clinging to can be directly traced to the racism of Confederacy and its insistence that ""The African"" was a lower, sub-human, form of life?  See when Darwin et. al. formulated the natural selection hypothesis, which is basically the statement ""god or nature is just as capable of breeding animals as human are"" the racist idiots had a problem.  {ASIDE: I think it's funny as hell that for the creationists to be correct, they have to insist that god is incapable of breeding animals the way every farmer and dog owner has done for centuries. The anti-evolution stance requires god to be incapable of doing himself what people do every day. All ""natrual selection"" means is that in nature things that cannot survive long enough to breed do not have children. It's literally that simple and basic an idea. But god could obviously never figure out a mechanism that simple according to his faithful followers.}  Under science the White and Black man are either first cousins, or the white man is the immediate ancestor of the black, or the black man is the immediate ancestor of the white.  Imagine your horror. You've just lost the american civil war and now your entire narrative of opression has just been blown out of the water by science. Literally the last leg of your white superiority was cut off at the hip.  Pure denial ensues. Darwin is drawn as a monkey in editorial cartoons just as all the black people are always drawn as monkeys.  The refrain ""I didn't come from no monkey"" is born but they are not talking about Tarzan's little buddy Cheetah.  Your entire lust for ""biblically literal creation"" was born by your raciest fore-bearers absolute rejection of racial equality and nothing more.  The saddest part is you don't even know why you still have a dog in this fight...  You almost certainly know that Jonah was not swallowed by a whale or giant fish. You don't avoid pork and sea food as unclean. You don't sell your girl children to their rapists. You, in fact, ignore most of the old testament.  But someone got ""creation"" stuck in your craw as some super important point that simply must be true or else.  You've just forgotten that that ""or else"" is ""or else we have no reason to call the black man sub-human"".  So you, whoever you are, are simply the victim of a dead political argument and you don't even know why.  I find the biblical ""young earth"" creationists just sort of sad. They don't even understand why they are still fighting that war. The old slave holding idiots never told them that part of the issue.  I also find it super funny that while the christians are calling evolution a secularist plot to undermine christianity... the muslims are calling it a christian plot to undermine islam.  It's literally ethnic panic and deflection all the way down."

What i said was    On first day of creation light was created. The sun, moon and stars were made visible from the earth on the fourth day of creation. Genesis creation account confirms the universe, this solar system and the earth and moon existed before humans did but all these things came into existence long after God was in existence. God was at one time the only thing in existence.   The point is the sources of light was not visible on the earth until the fourth day of creation after light came to be on the first day of creation. In contrast what science says and any primary school kid can probably tell you is due to atmospheric changes as photosynthetic plants created higher levels of oxygen etc the earth underwent many changes before the sources of light were actualy visible from the earth itself.  The earth would have been surrounded in a cloud of mist for a very long time in its early existence due to heat involved in its coming of being.

AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,BitOBear,2,Sat Jun 27 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you are capable of assimilating what is being put to you?  If you could grasp the concept that Gen 1:1-5 confirms the sun was in existence long before the earth and that the light from the sun was made visible as a diffused light on the earth when God said ""Let there be light"" - i.e.  first day of creation, lets call that Monday for illustrative purposes.  The actual sources of light were not visible due to many factors but the light did start reaching the earth at that point and is when a cycle of night and day started on the earth. Now on the fourth day of creation (lets call this Thursday) God said, ""Let luminaries ..."" which is totally different from saying ""light"".  The change is now that the spherical form of the sun and moon would now be visible if you were around to be standing on the earth at this time - but the earth is not capable of supporting any human life yet ...    Now i am no ancient linguist or scholar but the Genesis account was originally written in ancient Hebrew.  The Hebrew word used to describe light in Gen 1:3,5 when God said, ""Let light come to be""  was 'ohr which means light in a general sense.  Now when light is mentioned at Gen 1:14 in the fourth day of creation when God said, ""Let the luminaries ...""  the Hebrew word used to describe light was ma-'ohr which means the source of the light. That is why light is described in the first day of creation as light and illuminaries can be used to describe a different light in the fourth day of creation accounts when translating the Scriptures from Hebrew to English.   There had to be huge environmental, atmospheric and even cosmic changes for this change in lighting to happen.

The King James version of the same verse says: ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."" Plain and simple. On the sixth creative day, during the pinnacle of God's creation of the earth and after the animals had already been established, God created the first human couple, whom we'd later know as Adam and Eve.

God told them: ""Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.” (Genesis 1:28) Adam and Eve were to fill the earth with righteous offspring, to have a relationship with their creator, and live forever on a paradise earth. Yes, seriously.  How do we know this is true? 2 Timothy 3:16 states: ""All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness."" So we know that the writer of that verse and the Genesis book itself (Moses) was inspired by God's thoughts, and whatever He says is true. Jesus himself said, ""Your [God's] word is truth.""

AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,SentByHim,2,Thu Jun 25 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Richard Dawkins puts forward a good explanation of one theory in his book The Selfish Gene.  See Chapter 2: Replicators for a more extensive run down of the theory.  I highly recommended checking it out.  It was first published in the 1970s, though I don't believe there have been any fundamental developments in our understanding since then that would render any part of this theory obsolete.  Here's an excerpt:   Processes analogous to [the formation of amino acids] must have given rise to the ‘primeval soup’ which biologists and chemists believe constituted the seas  some three to four thousand million years ago. The organic substances became locally concentrated, perhaps in drying scum round the shores, or in tiny suspended droplets. Under the further influence of energy such as ultraviolet light from the sun, they combined into larger molecules. Nowadays large organic molecules would not last long enough to be noticed: they would be quickly absorbed and broken down by bacteria or other living creatures. But bacteria and the rest of us are latecomers, and in those days large organic molecules could drift unmolested through the thickening broth.  At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the Replicator. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself. This may seem a very unlikely sort of accident to happen. So it was. It was exceedingly improbable. In the lifetime of a man, things that are that improbable can be treated for practical purposes as impossible. That is why you will never win a big prize on the football pools. But in our human estimates of what is probable and what is not, we are not used to dealing in hundreds of millions of years. If you filled in pools coupons every week for a hundred million years you would very likely win several jackpots.   Dawkins then goes on to describe a very kind of primitive pre-DNA form of evolution and competition between replicators, which would eventually give rise to DNA and life as we know it."

But it's the only way to get from ooze top life is that at some point in time a cell spontaneously formed. It's as much nonsense as it sounds.  And panspermia says cells, complete life forms may have come in on comets or meteors. Amino acids are not life forms. They are only one very small part of the equation. The complexity of even the simplest of cells, can't recall which cell was first, but it didn't have a nucleus. It still has millions and millions of atoms that had to all come together, form their functioning, disparate parts, self assemble, and then come alive. Utter nonsense to assume it was spontaneous.   Know how they say cells initially developed nucleuses? They ate each other, and from that one eventually, spontaneously, developed a nucleus. Foolishness."

AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,SentByHim,3,Thu Jun 25 10:37:41 2015 UTC,"Nobody said an amino acid is a life form. I agree that the notion that if we can just get a few amino acids abiotically, a la Miller and Urey, life inevitably follows is a popular one in pop science. It's non existent in respectable scientific discourse. If you want to beat a straw scientist be my guest, but I hope you'd prefer to engage with the actual arguments proposed.  That lab experiments require scientists does not demonstrate or even imply that intelligence is necessary. I could grow a plant in a lab, or recreate clouds, or start a fire - none of these things require my input. But to characterise and understand them does require intelligence.  What we look for are processes that could plausibly, given what we know of chemistry and the composition of the early earth, lead to life-like systems. To take a simple example, we know that lipids spontaneously aggregate in water. That I can mix a lipid with water in order to study it does not mean intelligent intervention is required for this to happen in nature. But the observation that it can occur under plausibly prebiotic conditions using molecules that can be synthesised using natural chemical reactions (e.g. fischer-tropsch chemistry) and are found in meteorites suggests that these molecules were likely to exist and form aggregates before life arose.  Does that get us anywhere near a living system? Unless you're Doron Lancet, no. But it illustrates my point that the need for intelligent intervention to isolate and study a phenomenon does not imply the need for intelligent intervention for it to ever occur. On the contrary, the careful study of these things allows us to understand what can happen in the absence of intelligence. That's kind of the point.  Seriously: educate yourself about what we actually argue. I'm happy to help you with this if you're interested - not out of any need to persuade you that we have a good answer (we don't yet) but simply to show that we're not flaming idiots.

I'm been told to insist I agree with your first sentence most vehemently though, lol :P   Seriously, I contend that that's exactly what happened. It was designed, it was made to happen. And that's the claim, theologically, by us oddballs that didn't abandon our brains at the altar. It's way too intricate of a thing to have happened spontaneously, yet that's the contention. Somehow, figuring out how it happened is presented as an argument against the very design that has been discovered. If you want a cloud in a lab, you know exactly what you need to do to get it, you create those conditions and the system works in a predictable way to produce a desired result. You've essentially played god in your lab.   Right place, right time, right conditions for each and every single part of a cell spontaneously happening, beyond absurd 1050. Every condition for cytoplasm to come into existence has to happen at the exact same time as all the conditions for a cell wall. As do all the conditions for all the hundreds of different parts of the cell. And then you have to do something else, you have to make it alive. We can't do that, we can't cure death. We can't make cells come to life, they are either alive when we observe them, or they are dead when we observe them, like the cat, lol. (see Schrodinger) If it was presented as a theory about anything else, based on the math of it alone, you'd be laughed out of academia.  You're discovering the design, that's all. It's why it's there, ""the very heavens declare His handiwork"".

AskScienceDiscussion,3b1ior,tjjerome,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"Here's where we move from a scientific to a philosophical argument. Take the cloud as an example. We know of mechanisms by which clouds can be created in the lab, and we know that these same conditions occur in nature and account for the existence of clouds in the world. Depending on your theological attitude towards creation, this may or may not be a problem. If you insist that all clouds are statistically unlikely and thus each requires the special intervention of God in order to come to be, then the scientific result suggests you're wrong: we know a way they can form and we know this occurs in nature. If you have a broader concept of creation, and argue instead that God designed, created, and sustains nature... then science has nothing to say to you, in my view. God may well have ordered the universe such that clouds come to be. That's a theological question, not a scientific one, and is entirely compatible with our knowledge of clouds.  The same applies to life. If we find experimental conditions under which simple living systems form in the lab, and we find natural scenarios which resemble those experimental conditions and are likely to have occurred on the early earth... well, all that shows is that God didn't need to perform a one-off miracle to create life. It doesn't suggest that the world is not created.  In short, your first paragraph strikes me as a theological point, not a scientific one. From the lab bench, a non-theistic world and a world ordered by a deity are indistinguishable. You can call it uncovering design if you like. I won't complain, and neither will the many theistic scientists around the world.  As for your other points: nobody is claiming a modern cell appeared spontaneously. Indeed, your phrasing reveals your ignorance of the literature (I am not trying to be rude here, apologies if it comes off that way): the cell well is, to my knowledge, universally held to be a late invention. The cytoplasm is a highly ordered and structured system, while most historical protocell models have the internal contents consisting of an aqueous solution, or at most several compartments separated either by aqueous phase separation or by lipid membranes - nothing like the level of sophistication seen in modern biology. Nobody is claiming what you say they are.  I don't understand your Schrodinger comment, so I'll pass over it. But if you're suggesting there is some insurmountable barrier between living and non-living systems, well, that's an important question. My take is that life, however we define it, is probably not binary: things can be between living and non-living (as opposed to dead, meaning ""formerly alive""). A self-reproducing RNA-vesicle protocell as proposed by Szostak, for example, would probably be a semi-living system. So I don't see why our inability to resurrect the dead precludes the creation of life de novo.  Finally, yes, a vesicle is a long way from life (as I said up front). But we don't need DNA to get RNA; RNA is, if anything, a more prebiotically-plausible molecule and a more popular candidate component of prebiotic systems. Just because RNA is transcribed from DNA in modern biology does not mean that it can only be formed that way.  As I said before, if you'd like me to point you to some resources so you can learn what scientists actually claim, I'd be happy to. It's really tiresome for you to keep saying we claim cells appeared in their current form by magic; it's a strawman, and I'm not going to engage any further in this thread because I'm tired of going in circles."

As far as science not admitting when it's wrong? That's the most important thing science does. That's what's so wonderful about it. People are encouraged to ask questions, speculate, and develop new understandings. If those new theories have merit, they are incorporated into our body of knowledge to be passed down to future generations. If not, they are put to the side.  If the scientific community is disregarding an idea you have presented, it's not because they think they are better or smarter than you, it's because you have either presented no evidence to support it or there exists direct evidence to contradict it.  What you are saying may be true. Biogenesis may be a ridiculous concept. It certainly wouldn't be the first time one has been investigated. But right now we have every reason to pursue the question of how it could happen. Simply giving up on a problem that seems ""too hard"" will not lead to any new understandings, and therefore is not an option.  Edit: By the way, you can use old textbooks.

There we have a membrane. Then we need a replicator molecule that formed somewhere. Now if that replicator molecule (let's say a piece of RNA) gets inside that membrane you have a proto-cell. Mutate the replicator on each pass and you might get a primordial protein synthesis machine. Wait long enough and one of the proteins will have catalytic properties. Or you stick with ribozymes for a while longer. I think that's pretty much all you need for a proto-cell.  Out of curiosity, how was that 10120120 number calculated?"

It gets so beyond anything that's considered possible that it's foolishness to think it happened spontaneously.   and your contention that lipids will always lead to micelles and liposomes is also not true, it take specific conditions for each of the disparate parts to be made, and having those different conditions that are required for each of the parts all existing simultaneously in the exact same spot is again, silliness."

Remember that DNA and RNA work the way they do largely because of the cell around it, because of RNA polymerase that makes (pre-)mRNA from DNA, because of ribosomes that make proteins from mRNA, because of DNA helicase and all that fluff that replicates DNA - but at their base, RNA and DNA are just molecules. RNA can form without DNA unless I'm missing something here, I'm not entirely sure what you're referencing. Base plus sugar plus phosphate can condense under the right conditions, and then multiple of these can condense into a polymer.  And RNA can actually be catalytically active all by itself. That's called a ribozyme. Maybe the first thing on the way there was a ribozyme that helped other RNA polymerize, leading to the formation of a lot of junk RNA and also more such catalytic RNA. Maybe the formation of an RNA that forms RNA similar to itself. That's a first step on the way to life. That then embedded itself into a liposome. And so on.  The idea that a cell with DNA, ribosome, tRNA, membrane and ideally also golgi, cell skeleton, and why not mitochondria and a lysosome or two, that all that needs to form ""spontaneously"" and at the same time and in the same place is simply not what anyone is proposing, except as a straw man."

AskScienceDiscussion,3b122a,zeronezeronezero,4,Thu Jun 25 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting question.  Have an upvote.  I'm an educated layperson wrt biology; my degree is in math.  I took the molecular biology GRE a few years back, on the off chance that documenting my knowledge might be open the door for some sort of biology-related employment: my percentile score was in the 80s.    Ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs have to have evolved together (or at least finished together, in the origin of the genetic code), at a time when proteins didn't play anything like their current range of roles.  It can't have been entirely an RNA world, by that point: many peptides have to have been synthesized, or the code couldn't have gotten started.  For RNA to have been free to carry out such complex metabolism, it probably would already have handed off the role of main genetic material to DNA.  So the appearance of ribosomal genes per se would be nothing special: all sorts of RNAs would have already been getting transcribed from DNA, and all sorts of genes in DNA would have already been evolving based on selection pressure acting via their RNA products, before there was anything like translation, and thus before there were any genes for proteins.  Was it an RNA world?  My guess is that RNA wasn't the very first genetic material.  But I don't really have much of a guess as to when the first genetic material was lost.  Nor do I have much of a guess as to whether RNA was separate, or whether the first genetic material basically evolved into RNA.  By the time of the origin of the genetic code, I would guess that the original genetic material was present only in some vestigial roles.  So, what's my guess as to what was going on?  The tRNA-precursors were co-factors, analogous to coenzyme A.  Just as CoA enables an enzyme to get a grip on a fatty acid using a standard module for CoA binding, so a co-ribozyme T probably allowed a ribozyme to get a grip on an amino acid by using a standard module.  We have one CoA that gets used for a bunch of different fatty acids; that's how I assume it worked with a common ancestor of all tRNAs.  There didn't have to be specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetase ribozymes, initially, just as there don't have to be specific fatty-acyl CoA synthetases.  The fatty acids are metabolized with CoA attached, both anabolically and catabolically.  Likewise the amino acids were metabolized with a co-ribozyme T.  The synthetases showed up later, as proteins took over more functions after the genetic code was established.  Ribosomes themselves probably evolved from large multi-ribozyme complexes, analogous to the multi-enzyme complexes we have today, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase.  They had specific metabolic pathways for specific oligopeptides.  Control subunits became more efficient and more modular, until they functioned pretty much as mRNA does."

And while the authors may be more qualified to speculate than you, I found both perspectives insightful and interesting to chew over. Thanks!  EDIT: One of their better-supported assertions is also consistent with your idea of primitive tRNA as co-ribozyme:   Thus, it may initially only be necessary to have the CCA segment [aminoacylated tRNA domain] alone (Nissen et al. 2000). The 5′ domain [anticodon and mRNA binding domain] of the tRNA is not consequential to peptide bond formation and could have been added later. If the tRNAs evolved from the one domain structure or an even simpler structure, then protein synthesis would likely have begun as a noncoded process (Schimmel and Henderson 1994)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b122a,a2soup,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"thank you for detailed explanation! also, for the article.  The question about the rRNA genes arisen in my head as the result of a simple ""egg-chicken"" speculation. And then it developed to the point where I have to learn more and now looking for the information and opinions. The ribosome translates mRNA into peptides. Peptides are the part of the ribosome. In order to make first ribosome, the life entity must have peptides already. So that means that there is only one way can be possible: an independent RNA only enzyme started making peptides. In that case rRNA could come from DNA or RNA code, right? But it can not come from either because in order to transcribe the code peptides are needed. Peptides are made by ribosomes, so we are back to RNA. Or there were RNA only enzymes that were transcribing RNA or DNA genome to replicate themselves to start with. Then these entities are more like viruses rather than organisms. Some kind of naked viruse like particles floating all over the place replicating each other randomly. Then I asked myself what was first, virus? This way the first rRNA could be viral, and that is what interests me the most and that's why I think the ribosomal genes origin can be a bit further away than we think.   Back to your discussion: ""It can't have been entirely an RNA world, by that point: many peptides have to have been synthesized, or the code couldn't have gotten started...""   yes it is logical, but you see that without genetic code the ribosomes can't be made and so the peptides. And that genetic code has to be a replicating system. The replicating machinery is made by ribosomes today, what about back then?...  Or, maybe I am confusing myself at some step of my contemplation due to incomplete knowledge. I will read more. Thank you for suggestions!!"

Not a single ribozyme.  It would have taken one to catalyze each reaction.  Just as there's no code for polysaccharides, but rather specific metabolic pathways to string them together, so there would have been a limited set of peptides with a specific pathway to synthesize each one.     Then I asked myself what was first, virus?   There definitely is a chicken-and-egg feel to the origin of life.  For there to be life, there has to be a metabolism that's capable of supporting the genetics.  That is, an organism's metabolism must be able to provide more monomers of the genetic material, assemble a copy on a template, and separate the new strand from the template.  And there has to be a genetics that's capable of supporting the metabolism: the presence of a suitable set of genetic sequences has to lead, somehow, to the production of any molecule the organism needs to synthesize.  Once you've got RNAs serving as both catalysts and genetic material, life is underway and it can evolve to metabolize available materials into oligopeptides.  What's perplexing is how to get from no life to RNA world."

As the event is super random it would create millions of different molecules. They will be reacting with each other in random manner. It is very possible that two singular RNA molecules would react in such way that one will replicate another, especially if to imagine that this puddle works as an enclosed system for these reactions. All the building blocks (reagents) must be there already as the RNA were made. So it is one enzyme, or many different with the similar catalytic domain (simply because of RNA physico-chemical capacities). Can they all be in that puddle and simply multiply themselves? Why not? Could be there autonomous puddles? why not? Could the puddles mix at some point? And how would you call these replicating RNAs? Will we call it life if it replicates itself in a random fashion?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3b122a,ashmasterJ,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"As I said, I suspect that the very first genetic material was not RNA.  I think it was something that would self-assemble more easily.  Specifically, the base pairs stack in the middle of a double helix: they do so only when held in place by the rest of the molecule, but somewhat larger flat molecules such as coronene will stack spontaneously under suitable circumstances.    Coronene is uniform around the edges, with neither hydrogen-bond donors nor hydrogen-bond acceptors.  The first genetic material would have been about the same size as coronene, so as to stack spontaneously, but it would have had functional groups around the edge so that it could stack specifically, with interactions like those involved in base-pairing.  So I think the replication wasn't done catalytically: it happened as a result of some sort of cycle in ambient conditions.  It might have been wetting and drying of a tide pool.  It might have been diurnal temperature cycle.  It might have been changes in salinity in an estuary.  It might have been saturation of soil with rainwater and drying between rains.  Whatever it was, the conditions changed from those that favored stacking to those that allowed dissociation of strands.    If it was just stacking, no covalent bonds had to be made in the formation of a new strand.  So no catalysis of those bond-forming reactions was needed.  I don't think a static puddle is the right kind of situation for the origin of life, either.  In a tide pool, or an estuary, or soil wetted by rain, there's a solid or semi-solid material that stays there, and there's a liquid phase that flows in and out of the area.  The stacked strands of proto-life would remain, adhering to the solid surface, and new monomers would flow in.  I don't think we should describe life as beginning all in one spot, though.  The formation of the monomers is part of it too.  And it doesn't count as life (as I understand it) until the strands can lead to the sequence-specific catalysis some reactions that favor the formation or persistence of those sequences."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b122a,ashmasterJ,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:12:02 2015 UTC,"i see, pre-RNA world, or the pre-life spontaneous building of molecules. Yes, that certainly is a debate at what point a pre-life is considered a life. It is awesome you think even before that! From your perspective and chemistry point of view it is known that chemical reactions occur on their own catalyzed by conditions instead of enzymes. Molecules come together and react. If we look at enzyme catalyzing reaction, it is nothing more than chemistry too. I think that chemistry is underestimated as a meaning in biological system making it detached only because chemical reactions are ordered and well organized in a living organism. The bottom line is that chemistry vs biology it's like disordered random reactions vs sequential and organized reactions. That does not change nature of reactions, but it changes one significant fact, biology represents autonomous system that has negative entropy comparing to that of system in chemistry. Speaking very raw of course. I find it the most fascinating property of life!  We diverge when ooking at the core of origin. I tend to think that it has to be to some extent closed system that has its own dynamics, while you tend to think otherwise. Intuitively and logically I agree with you more than with me. But it is too complicated for my imagination to overcome the idea that for an organized life on molecular level to start the space can be as vast as entire earth ecosystem at that time. My mind tries to recreate a cell, a unit that has the soup in it for cooking =). As I said, I gotta read more to build deeper understanding."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b122a,a2soup,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"Just random thoughts, so please excuse me if I say something stupid =)  Seems to me that modern virus needs to hijack existing cellular machinery to replicate?  So my thought is that pre-origin of life, you had a bunch of RNA floating around.  It had some enzyme-like activity, notably the ability to make more copies of itself.  This wasn't that useful, but it did create a lot of RNA.  By chance, one mutates... specifically it loses the ability to copy itself, but it gains (or mutated copies evolve) the ability to copy other RNA floating around.  [Call this the ancestor of rRNA] This (maybe over huge time scales) allows for specialization - an RNA can have a useful function but lose the ability to copy itself... it relies on the 'ancestor' to copy it.  If aggregated into proto-cell (phospholipid, etc etc) this could lead to evolution: only the most efficient 'ancestor' is selected for, and the mRNA precursors have selection pressure against being able to self-copy.  Over even more time, the rRNA 'ancestor' becomes so important that selection favors it being made out of something more stable than RNA... such as peptides.  The 'ancestor' could also mutate to gain the transcription function, which I think is a neat explanation for why we use mRNA in modern cells but the finished product is a protein.  The rRNA 'ancestor', once it transitions into a polypeptide instead of pure RNA becomes a self-contained piece of cellular machinery - and presumably it is consumed by/forms symbiotic relationship with the proto-cells, much like mitochondria & chloroplasts do.  Modern rRNA might exist simply because it is needed to help the ribosome function in some way not fully understood."

This seems to have happened several times going back in Earth's geologic history. The previous supercontinents have names like Pangea (~250 million years ago), Pannotia (~600 million years ago), Rodinia (~1000 million years ago), and Columbia (~1800 million years ago).  The cycle will almost certainly continue, but because of the eratic way geologic plates move over longer periods of geologic time, it's impossible to make good estimates of when the next supercontinent will actually form, though it has been named Pangea Ultima. Its formation is likely to be at least 150 million years away.  Though I'm positive the Earth will still be here in 150 million years and only slightly less sure plate tectonics will still be going on, it's hard for me to believe that human civilization will still exist.

Water is often applied to fields with giant moving sprinkler systems that just aren't very efficient. A few percent of that will evaporate before it even hits the ground.  Soaker hoses - just a rubber hose with holes in it - can apply water in a more targeted way with less of it blowing away in the dry California wind. Much of it will inevitably run off or evaporate anyway.  You can also use a greenhouse or even indoor farming to hold on to your water but the more enclosed and controlled it is the more expensive it is.  There are salt-tolerant plants but trying to spray a field with sea water will slowly convert it into a meters-thick salt flat. The real problem is unsustainable water usage and pumping groundwater several times faster than rain and rivers can replace it. The pumps go dry, the rivers become muddy creeks, the lakes empty, and everybody is pretty much screwed because science cannot conjure water from nothing (although for a price you can filter seawater to tolerable salinity levels)."

California has an immensely-complicated system of water rights, and part of the reason that inefficient irrigation techniques are so common is that water has historically been very cheap. If water was more-expensive, then farmers would have an incentive to use it more-efficiently. But prices can't go up in most places, so we transition from lots of cheap water in wet years to no water at all for many farmers in dry years.  Interestingly, many CA farmers who are in areas other than the San Joaquin Valley and Imperial Valley are subject to increasing costs of water, and as a result, they do use more-efficient watering techniques, including drip irrigation. That is more labor-intensive, and so you can only use it on more-valuable crops, of course."

Or at least part of it does.  When water evaporates (either through plants as transpiration, or directly from the soil) all the dissolved minerals in it are left behind in the soil.  Water has to keep flowing out of the soil, or the minerals (salts) would accumulate.  Plants can be selected, bred, or (potentially) genetically modified to be able to tolerate somewhat more salts in the soil water.  There's a trade-off between that and yields, though.  And ocean water is way too salty.  Rather than irrigating with sea water, we could bring seawater to places like Death Valley and the salt flats in Utah near Great Salt Lake, and let the water evaporate.  The salt would be left behind, but it's salt flats already.  The water would mostly fall as rain as the air passes over the mountains, and add to the flow of rivers such as the Colorado and Snake, where it would be available for irrigation.  If solar keeps getting cheaper, we may get to the point where the cheapest way of providing enough power on cloudy days is by building more solar, which will provide more power than needed on sunny days.

Unfortunately I don't have a good recommendation for a linear algebra book - the one I learned from was pretty formal and abstract for your use case - but you can at least start to look up what linear algebra is if you're interested."

You would spend your time learning how to prove minutia that you'll never use, and to quote on of my QM profs, in physics ""it is more important to understand why something is true than to have a proof that it is true"".  For a first QM book I would recommend Griffiths, as already mentioned in this thread. It's the standard first QM book for undergrads. Keep in mind that it will draw a lot on classical mechanics and electromagnetism, so make sure you're comfortable with those first. Shankar is also good but I feel it's half a level of difficulty above Griffiths."

AskScienceDiscussion,3b0p33,swordfingers,2,Thu Jun 25 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"Shankar, Principles of Quantum Mechanics was my favorite QM text. It spends the first hundred pages on a math and classical mechanics review before presenting QM in a math-intensive but thorough and satisfying way. Drawing an analogy to math textbooks, Shankar's text isn't arranged in theorem-proof style, but it frequently feels like it. If you're not sure if you are ready for this text, read the first ~50 pages (the math review) and if you can make it through them with a moderate understanding or better, then you'll be fine for the rest of the text.  Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics was another text I've used and would recommend. You'll still want linear algebra, but you don't need to be nearly as proficient as with Shankar. This text is a more conversational style like one typically encounters in a physics text. Griffiths does an excellent job of talking you through implications and conclusions that other authors would expect you to grasp from the raw equations.  McQuarrie, Quantum Chemistry might be a good choice for you. It's targeted at chemistry rather than physics students, a group which frequently has not had any linear algebra. You'll pay a price for that when attempting to understand the big picture and develop a QM-compatible intuition, but this text is by far the most approachable and user-friendly for someone without a solid linear algebra background. I enjoyed this text when I used it, but if you do feel like investing the time in learning linear first (and I recommend it for QM), then go for one of the other two books.   In case it's not obvious from the descriptions, these recommendations are arranged in descending order of required mathematical maturity and experience. All three texts are available online as PDFs, so you can give them a browse before deciding which to buy. Note that one of the Shankar PDFs floating around is missing a significant part of the end of the text; it should go to chapter 21 and ~650 pages.   One more quasi-recommendation: I'm just starting to go through Thaller's Advanced Visual Quantum Mechanics and really like it thus far. I certainly wouldn't recommend it as a first QM text, but so far I like it as a second QM text. It approaches the topic from a very different viewpoint and seems to be trying to build an intuition for QM in your head that is most useful. If you buy this, make sure it comes with the CDROM since the included visualizations are critical to understanding."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b0ts9,idowhatidoforme,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to get at?   As a society interstellar space travel is not about capitalism. We should spend $Trillions on a ship and no company would ever make a profit.   And well before interstellar space travel is possible, we need to find a way to protect astronauts from long term exposure to cosmic radiation. A 'warp drive' isn't enough for enabling humans to travel through interstellar space, even if we did know how to create one.  Solving these problems will take a lot of time and money, and it takes a lot of convincing to get people to part with money for such a long-term project that has an uncertain return at best. Private investment by the rich and corporations can help speed up this process, but there has to be at least a small chance of turning a profit for them to be willing to take on such a huge risk.  But let's say that you are correct, and that we should ""drag the rich from their homes"" and ""eliminate capitalism."" Then what? What do we replace capitalism with? How do we convince people to work towards the innovations that you want to see if we punish those who have been successful by forming a lynch mob and persecuting them?  If you want to change the world, abandon this /r/BadEverything and identify a specific problem in the world. Learn both sides (yes, you have to take the ""wrong"" side of the issue seriously) and figure out a variety of solutions to the problem that don't require a large-scale violent revolution. Then talk to people to get them on your side and shore up arguments for your position. Then those in charge are far more likely to take up your cause and implement your ""change [of] the world for the better.""  Let's consider an example:  let's say you think that civil forfeiture is evil and needs to be abolished. Let's think about the consequences of this:  Bernie Madoff's assets wouldn't have been seized to pay back his victims, actual drug money could not be seized from dealers, etc., but at least innocent people would not have their possessions stolen from them by the police, so it may be progress. Okay, we shouldn't totally get rid of civil forfeiture, but if we force there to be due process and take measures to hamper corruption, then that should be considered good enough. So change the goal to this instead.  Now that we've formed a balanced, level-headed position, we get others to sign petitions, and then we lobby Congress and the state legislatures to pass bills restricting civil forfeiture until they give in. Yay! We've made the world (well, the US, anyways) a better place.  If you want to use science, it's the same process, but instead of lobbying the government, you'll need to get rich people on board. Keep in mind that with science, you have additional engineering considerations to consider which will impede progress. Yes, we could load a rocket with millions of tons of fuel to be able to accelerate enough to get to another star in a reasonable amount of time, but then we need a lot more fuel to get back, and all this is prohibitively expensive and a nightmare to design. Good luck.  Instead of focusing on the big picture, set yourself a smaller target that pushes us in the direction of your goal, and work towards that small aim instead. It's how most progress has been made in the whole of human history, and it's how we're going to get to a 'Star Trek' type of society, if that is indeed the direction the world is headed."
AskScienceDiscussion,3b0ts9,Begging4Bacon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"Good response, Bacon, I'll give my own answer to the question ""How do we make the world better with science?""  I think there are three basic components or legs to doing this: 1) Energy 2) Materials 3) Expansion of resource base  1) Energy.  We need new and better energy sources to fuel the information age we are in.  High efficiency solar, certainly, hydro and wind power, certainly, and a lot of other alternatives some which are just theoretical.  We should do basic research into figuring out the secrets of photosynthesis - where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy in a process that is 40% efficient!  The best solar tech right now is maybe 10%.  In the medium term, fusion makes the most sense, as it is cleaner and doesn't require radioactive fissiles.  In the long term... antimatter, perhaps, maybe figuring out how to get energy from quantum foam?  We need better wind/water/solar to buy time and keep from damaging the environment too much while we develop a game changing tech.  2)  Exciting and fundamental breakthroughs are being made in materials science all the time, most just aren't sexy enough to make front page news.  NiMH rechargeable batteries are something developed during the last decade.  Graphene holds promise as a super-material, it may make low-cost desalinzation, terabit wireless, and even solar sail tech practical one day.  I am also excited by 3-D printing, which is loosely a form of materials tech that could revolutionize certain types of manufacturing and drastically increase the margin for error on space missions - instead of sending up tons of spare parts, you send a 3-D printer and a bunch of substrate.    3) Ultimately the Earth is a closed system with finite resources.  The obvious answer is a slow expansion into space.  Not interstellar travel, which is largely a pipe dream at this point, but interplanetary travel.  For instance if we develop super materials like carbon nanotubules (which we already have, but don't have the capability to manufacture in huge quantities) we can build a space elevator... which will dramatically reduce launch costs into orbit.  We can build orbital infrastructure in the Lagrange points and make exploitation of the moon practical.  Once we have Lunar mining/refining and a permanent human presence in space, we can start assembling pure spacecraft that never have to survive launch out of Earth's gravity well.  These can be used to travel to Mars, certainly, but a better bet is probably the asteroid belt.  Asteroid mining is already something companies like Google are investing in... simply put there are asteroids that are largely gold, or platinum, as well as the much more common nickel-iron.  There is probably all sorts of other valuable stuff embedded in asteroids, and we could start sending refined metals back to Earth... giving us raw materials for another age of technological advancement.  The solar system is a big place... there are all kinds of resources we simply don't know about because most of our missions are fly-bys or cursory landings.  Once we have tons of robot factories, lunar refineries, and the capability to build large spacecraft entirely in space, we just have to wait around for fusion/antimatter to be perfected.  When that happens, we can send constant acceleration craft to the far reaches of the solar system and maybe the nearby stars.  Relatively all of this is feasible, and except for fusion, pretty much stuff we could do now if we had the political will and were willing to stop spending money on wars and gimmicky entertainments.  OP, I think you'll find that the money spent on Earth per year on wars beggars the sum total of the 1%er's wealth."

The same thing that causes a pair of dice to give 7 more often than 2 or 12. There's more ways to get there.  If you roll a die six times, and you get 1 six times, there's only one way that can possibly happen - you roll 111111. If you roll it six times, and get 1 three times and 2 three times, there's twenty ways to do it - 111222, 112122, 112212, 112221, 121122, and so on. You're equally likely to roll any number at each point, so all of these paths are equally likely, which means you're twenty times as likely to get 1 three times plus 2 three times.  The more unique ways you can arrange the sequence, the more paths there are which get you that distribution of numbers. And the paths max out when repeated numbers are minimised, because that means there are more ways to arrange the sequence.  So if you roll a die a trillion times, you could get 1 every time, it's just vastly less probable than getting some other numbers thrown in along the way."

AskScienceDiscussion,3ax53h,garblz,3,Wed Jun 24 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"I think the best view of probability is mathematical declaration of uncertainty. In some cases, such as quantum mechanics, or chaos theory, the uncertainty for different outcomes can be quantified. Our models of the universe show that it acts in similar ways - not always the same way, but often within set of specific different options that occur at different rates.  This can be summed up by saying that ""probability is in the mind"". Some quantum mechanics philosophy arguments actually dissolve quantum mechanical probability, by stating that it's not that there are several possibilites which each happen with some probability, but that all outcomes happen, and we split into a different person for each outcome that is observed. So if there are two possibilities w/ a 50/50 chance (an electron being spin up or spin down), then when the electron is observed, we split into one person who observed a spin up electron and one person who observed a spin down electron (with the observation being the electron states being entangled with the brain states). My qm is a little shoddy so I may need correcting here. Then the probability problem is actually an identity problem---both versions of you continue on and only experience one outcome. In a coin-flip case, after 1000 flips, and 1000 universe/identity splits, there are 21000 individuals who have observed outcomes that look like 'random distributions' just like normal coin flip experiments.  There are two different views of probability, called frequentionist, and bayesian. frequentionist is that probabilities are frequencies of what 'would' have occured given similar conditions if the experiment was run infinite times. Bayesianism is the idea that you have a prior estimate, and then information you have updates your estimate, and a probility is your statement of confidence that something is going to happen. I have no idea you get your first prior estimate, but you can use the outcome of past experiments/situations.  Something else you might be interested in is knightian uncertainty, which is the name for uncertainty where there is not a clear way to calculate probabilities for. Most probability predictions ignore this. For example, there might be a calculable probability of rain tomorrow. However, the probability that a nuclear bomb is dropped and drastically changes the weather is not included. I guess in this case the probability (thinking in terms of personal confidence and ignoring determinism) is low enough that it wouldn't affect the number."

Not to mention stuff like different possibilities being able to cancel each other out.  As far as generating good priors, well, the usual advice is ""be born with good priors"" ;)  Other than that, things like penalizing hypotheses based on complexity would work.  Other than that, your description is pretty good.

AskScienceDiscussion,3ax53h,GOD_Over_Djinn,3,Wed Jun 24 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"Let's say that the universe is entirely deterministic. (This isn't strictly true in a quantum mechanical universe, but go with me here.) If you had perfect knowledge of the particulars of the universe – the precise positions and velocities and temperatures of every body and particle – then you could predict (and postdict) the rest of history.   The problem is that you cannot obtain such perfect knowledge. The most perfect representation of the universe would require at least one particle to represent each particle in the actual universe. So you can either just create a whole second copy of the universe verse and see what it does (difficult, and boring) or create an approximation of the universe, and hope that it captures the essential details.   Now, with your limited knowledge, there will be some things that you can predict very well. Say, if you know the position and momentum of the earth and sun, you can predict the position of both at any later time with pretty good accuracy without knowing how much I way, and what I had for breakfast. But if you want a more accurate answer, then you would also want to know the position and momentum of the moon, because this also affects the earth's trajectory (and to a lesser extent the sun's). At that level, you should probably worry about Jupiter and its impact on the sun.  Now the problem is that a many body system is 'chaotic'. I am using 'chaos' here as a technical term: it means that minor changes in the state of a system at one time can have a large impact of the state of the system at some later time. Let me take the solar system (sun-earth-moon-Jupiter) as my system; the positions and momenta of these four bodies at some time wholly describe the system.   If I run a simulation of the motion of these bodies (the evolution of the system) over a long period of time, i will actually see deviations from the simple expectation I might've had from a kind of 'celestial clockwork' picture. There will be subtle interactions between the earth and Jupiter, such that I will sometimes find the earth slightly ahead of or behind where I might've though it 'should' be if it just went round and round its orbit at the same constant speed for ever.   But here's the thing. If I go back to the start of the simulation, and shift the position of the moon by a very small amount and run it again, what happens? What are the differences? Well, the sun will be more or less in the same place in the two simulations the whole time; there won't be a whole lot of differences in its behaviour. And at least at the start, there won't be any discernible differences in the behaviours of the other bodies. But after a while, there will be some big differences: the earth will start to appear at a different point in its orbit, as the moon adds or detracts from Jupiters pull in the earth in a slightly different way as before.   Maybe I haven't said enough to really convince you of this, but the point is that if you run these kinds of simulations long enough, and you run enough of them, you'll find that after some length of time, you'll be able to predict the separation between Jupiter and the sun, and between the earth and the sun, but not between the earth and Jupiter.   Your imperfect knowledge of the starting conditions (the exact position of the moon) leads to large uncertainties in some of the outcomes (the separation between the earth and Jupiter).   But you nevertheless have some idea of what the possible outcomes might be. Like, say, in none of your simulations will you find that the earth and Jupiter swap positions. Instead you will find a distribution of likely outcomes, with some separations quite likely, and many others not at all likely.   This is one way of thinking about 'what probability is'; a description of likelihood.   Our world is chaotic (even without quantum). If you are a meteorologist, then you know that the chaotic timescale of your area is probably three or four days. This is why you typically only get a weekly forecast. If you flip a coin, then the chaotic timescale is a few tumbles. (Unless you practice.) If you shuffle a deck of cards, the chaotic timescale is a few riffles. (Unless you practice.)   But in the point is, you can articulate and enumerate the plausible outcomes of your experiment (the temperature on Tuesday afternoon, or the suit of the next card), and you can maybe express your expectation for the likelihood of different outcomes. But if you can't be really certain about the one outcome, then you're forced to fall back on probability.   It's not magic, it's just a way of describing your ignorance (or, if you prefer, imperfect knowledge) about the true state of the universe.   Then, the fucked up thing about quantum mechanics is that 1. there is not strict causality, so the same causes can sometimes lead to different effects and/or 2. the idea of there being one 'true' state of the universe is invalid. But, there, too, probability is used in an attempt to describe those things that are possible to describe, and as precisely as it is possible to describe them, in the face of the fact that perfect knowledge is not possible."

This is in line with the frequentistic interpretation of probability. Another interpretation is the Bayesian statistics, where the probability is basically you expectations of the outcome. In this interpretation, it makes perfect sense to talk about the probability of different outcomes of an event even after the event has occurred, as long as you do not know the outcome, whereas frequentistic probability only makes sense for events that can be repeated many times (and ""this dice roll"" can not be repeated, it would be a different dice roll).  In my opinion, the Bayesian interpretation is pretty close to our intuitive understanding of probability, so it makes much more sense for us.

Once any one human figures out how to avoid or defeat a lion, that knowledge can be disseminated much more rapidly than mere genetic inheritance would allow."

Basically any big cat or wild dog can kill an individual, unless we are allowed to use our intelligence. Although our intelligence would only guide us in using our surroundings and the tools in the environment better. Say, if I was confronted by a lion in the Savannah, I would look around for a stick which I can use to impale the lion. Easier said than done, but the ability to grab a stick and whip it around skillfully is unique to humans. Infact a strong sharp stick is all a skilled hunter really needs to avoid being eaten by large predators (please provide examples where this is not the case, maybe for bears or large gorillas). We would still be vulnerable to venomous creatures and if caught off guard, then there's not much one can do without antidotes or other cures.   But the more I think about it, a stick might not be enough to fend off a lion or a bear. What do you guys think?

AskScienceDiscussion,3ax6xo,kiefcatchers,2,Wed Jun 24 05:43:01 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure of what you're actually asking.  Are you asking about whether it's feasible to have one huge power grid over the whole world? In that case, we're actually not so far off from that. Many bordering countries have connections between their power grids so that if one country is producing more power than they currently need, and the other country is using more power than they're currently producing, they can buy power from the other country.  What is not feasible is a gigantic power grid with power stations only in one place in the world. Electrical power is actually really hard to efficiently transport large distances, due to resistive heating (losses) in the power lines.    But what if we could harness the power of electricity?   We did that a long time ago, we've been using electrical power at a large scale for over a 100 years. What do you actually mean?   The issue I see is the fact that lightning is so powerful.   Is this your actual question, if we can harness the power in lightning strikes? If so, it really should be in the topic!  An average lightning strike transfers about 5 billion joules of energy according to wikipedia. According to [this](www.ucar.edu/communications/infopack/lightning/faq.html) site, there's over 30 million lightning strikes on the earth, daily. So that's 5x109 x 3x107 = 1.5x1017 Joules ""delivered"" by lightning, dayly.   According to wikipedia, in 2008 the total electrical energy consumption was about 7.3x1019 joules. If you divide 7.3x1019 by 1.5x1017 you get 486.6, which means that you'd need to capture all of the lightnings on the earth for 487 days just in order to meet the electrical energy demand back in 2008. And that's ignoring all the different problem such as losses, storage, conversion after storage, the fact that it would be completely practically impossible to even capture .01% of all lightnings worldwide, and other problems.  So I would dare to say that, within our foreseeable future, lightning energy won't be a thing. We'd need to come up with new technology to be able to actually store the energy in the lightning, we'd need to build an unthinkably huge (and expensive!) grid of ""lightning receptors"" (you'd need them at least every 1-200 meters or so, over the whole surface of the earth), and the gains still wouldn't be that large."

As for harnessing the power of electricity - what I meant was harnessing the power of lightning on a global scale. What you said does make sense, bu wouldn't even being able to store and use a 400th of the global electricity consumption a day be worth it? Or is it just a money/time vs effectiveness/current technology issue? And if not lightning, what in your opinion would be a more viable option for a ""world grid"" or world energy concept?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3ax6xo,SinkTube,2,Wed Jun 24 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"The majority of lightning strikes happen in ""random"" locations, so you'd have to set a ridiculous amount of receivers, or set up a few and hope they happen to get hit a lot. Neither of those is worth it.  But there are some targets that get hit regularly, like the Empire State Building. That thing gets hit all the time right? Wrong. Despite some claims that go up to 500 hits/year, the official number given by the National Weather Service is 25.  Is that worth it? It's not as much as you hoped, but it's still free energy right? Sure, if we could harness it. How do you propose we do that? We can't just hook up the lightning rod to the electric grid, or that sudden rush of electricity would blow every circuit in the city. We can't hook it to a battery because the battery would explode (or at least be fried)."

I'm getting the impression that maybe right now with the way the world works and the technologies that we are focusing on collectively, a global grid of electricity may not be the most feasible option. I do believe we could do it, and that even if you were saving 1% of the world's consumption a day - that is still a lot of free power. Heck, imagine a third world country having a 1/4 of the power Canada uses in 24/hrs every day. That's literally world changing.  I think the hardest part (and this is just speculation, I'm an electrician not a scientist) would be firstly finding a way to store and convert massive amounts of power (like a lighting strike) quickly and efficiently. Secondly, the further you go from the source of power the more resistance you have, along with voltage drops. That's why power lines run 14,000 volts - they need that much power to account for voltage drops, among other potential issues. I do like the idea of using magnetic fields to create energy but I don't know enough about the concept to put my two cents in."

What would we realistically expect to find given the sheer amount of time and the hostile environment?
AskScienceDiscussion,3av1a8,MorallyDeplorable,2,Tue Jun 23 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"To me it wouldn't make much sense if it were humans up on Mars in that scenario. Humans fit in here with our fossil record, so if there were humans on Mars, they'd have originated from here.   Any civilization advanced enough to travel from Earth to Mars would very likely leave some kind of irregularity somewhere. We can look at our own development for examples. Lead contamination from leaded gasoline, CO2 level spike, habitat changes, etc. There is even the reactor in Oklo, Gabon, that was a natural nuclear reactor that caused changes in the natural isotopic ratios, enough to set off metaphoric alarm bells for the nuclear industry (the ""we lost some fissile material"" checks). It happened naturally, there, and it's more of a fluke occurrence, and yet we found it. In contrast, if in 100,000 years someone started digging up deposits, they'd find all sorts of worse irregularities than that; things that defy nature and it'd seem obvious that there was some advanced civilisation messing with nuclear processes.  Then there is the point that if travelling between Earth and Mars is easy, then travel between continents would be no problem. Since we've started to do intercontinental travel, things like plants have been spread, pests spread, and the mixing of our species all which would seem ""strange"" for a non-advanced society when discovered.   But I'm not aware of any sort of anomalies, though I'm not an expert in such things. I figure that if such things were found, they'd blow the doors off our understanding of humanity and would be such a major find that if it were out there then someone would have noticed by now. Instead, we get just a bland picture of a civilisation that has never been advanced as we are now (which is fine by me, I don't think a total collapse would be a fun time in the least).  Then there's also the time frame for water on Mars (i.e. habitability). Quick googling puts it at ~4 billion years ago, and humans are on the order of 100,000 years old, which is a huge discrepancy; Mars was ""dead"" before humans even were a thing. That doesn't discount contained structures, but the timeframe doesn't really work well with iron structures turning to rust in what's essentially a vacuum, and not to mention to allow the rust being evenly-distributed across the planet's surface. Plus how much rust is there and how much iron/oxygen would have had to been present in the buildings in order to cover that surface. I'll bet it's an unreasonable amount of iron. To a point where the iron isn't the only sign visible, I mean."

From my best understanding, there isn't enough material in space for sound waves to travel.    Sound is produced by vibrations in a particular medium:  Air, Water, Steel, dirt, etc.  Each of those materials has molecules that are close enough that they can pass the vibration from to the next.   In space, there's so much space between the molecules that sound just can't continue to travel.   HOWEVER, I think you could set up an experiment to determine what this would be like.  With simple materials (pvc pipe, phone, speakers, helium balloon, aquarium) you could set up a scenario to pass sound waves through materials of varying densities to determine if there was a change in the sound, or loss in quality.  Assuming that you could fill the void between earth and Jupiter on the opposite side of the sun with material, I think (real scientists step in please) that as the material gets closer to the sun, it would become more tightly packed (more dense).  So, as the sound leaves the earth, it travels through material of density X.  As it gets closer to the sun, it approaches density 2x, 3x, 4x, etc.  As it leaves, it goes back down in density, until it approaches Jupiter, where density would again start to climb due to Jupiter's own mass.

Textbook companies bribe the admin to force students to horrendously overpay for shit books. The dramatic increase in tuition is not matched by an increase in learning services or professor faculty. It is, instead, matched to an increasingly overinflated administration, consequently making the bureaucracy larger and more incompetent. In fact, adjunct teaching is on the rise, while professor positions are becoming rarer and rarer.

Bear with me here - it's pretty hard to improve on a cetacean when it comes to marine tetrapod predators. They've pretty much got it nailed.  Blowholes: fuckin' awesome. The animal can gulp a breath without even slowing down. That's in.  'Tail' built from fused back legs? definitely in. Pinnipeds are going that way already, cetaceans are just the ultimate form. They get so much power compared to those stupid turtle fins it's not funny.  But what do rodents bring to the table? well, the ocean is full of delicious things with hard shells, and rats have a can opener built right into their face. Those incisors are great for killing prey as well- when rats kill mice they do it with one bite to the back of the neck, severing the spine. (Yes, rats kill and eat mice given the chance.)   I left the claws on the pectoral fins thinking maybe it could use them to stir the sediment for clams.  Now, rodents don't have canines anymore, but I feel like they would evolve back in as gripping teeth if they hunted a lot of slippery animals like fish. The incisors might not be enough.  Sociality, why not. Make them social predators like dolphins. Most rodents are already fairly social, and also quite intelligent for their size. Blowing one up to dolphin size they might well end up smarter than dolphins.  There you go, the terror of the seas."

I think there is more burst speed and agility (think cornering) for the attack. Add the jaws that can extend (forgot the word) like a great white. Why not give it four legs and a tail? Crock style legs that can move on land (since it is an air breather) to capture prey there as well as in the water. Change crocks tail for something more like the sharks for water based speed and attacks. I'd keep it a mammal as well. I like both warm blooded and live birth for many reasons.

""black on top so you can not see them when they are under you, white on the bottom so you can not see them when they are above you"".  If you are in a deep water column and you look down, you see darkness. So many predators have a darker top side to blend in with the darkness of the deep.  Similarly if you are in any water column and look up it is brighter above you than where you are, so many ocean predators are lighter on the underside to blend in with the lightness above.  This isn't as true in clear tropical waters where you can often see a hundred feet or more, but in most open ocean waters it's a huge difference.  Look at any dolphin, any penguin, and most water column feeding (as opposed to bottom feeding) sharks."
AskScienceDiscussion,3arvt1,dsws2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on what its prey are.    Rorquals are very good filter feeders, which works on a wide range of schooling prey when they're that large.  I suspect that Livyatan melvillei was a superb rorqual eater, probably better than an orca.  But orcas are better generalists, living well on salmon, seals, or gray whales.  Crocodilians are well suited to estuary and river lifestyle, where a lot of the prey is above water.  The lateral swimming motion lets them cruise along the surface better than a dolphin could.  But they've never taken over the deep-sea niches, and there's probably a reason for that.    But you do say ""generalist"".  The only changes I would make to an orca would be, first, to bring back the lateral line.  We lost it when our ancestors came ashore, and its vestiges (our ears) are too specialized to regain their former function.  And second, if I were going full generalist, I would put in a set of crushing teeth in back.  Its not worthwhile to be that much of a generalist, but that was one part of the challenge.  For most intelligent, you probably want a niche that supports a huge body size so that the excess brain tissue isn't too much of a drain.  That would be the sperm whale, with the world's biggest brains.  I would give them appendages with a design based off an elephant's trunk, that retract into a slit for efficient swimming, the way their penises do.  The appendages would be near enough to the mouth that the whales could feed themselves with them, and long enough that they could have some maneuverability near the bottom where there are objects to use as tools."

Not a big deal unless your fuel efficiency is rubbish, and no generation ship will work unless your fuel efficiency is spectacular. 80Kg on a 500 Kg ship? BIG impact (but that's a really tiny generation ship so you're probably reactionless/replicator at this stage).  That being said, adding mass to this ship will have a negative impact on the efficiency of the ship.

So a 10m fall means the cat would be going around 10m/s so the fall would take 1 second.   Now I have a hard time believing a cats terminal velocity is 10m/s. Where did this number come from?

AskScienceDiscussion,3aogj6,pushing1,3,Mon Jun 22 09:34:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard it better described as ""twisted up"" rather than ""smashed into itself"". Imagine spacetime as a 3D grid rather than a sheet, so that there's a giant infinite number of 3D boxes in space stacked perfectly with no room between them. To move through spacetime (like walking or flying in a ship), we move from one 3D box to an adjacent one, then to the next box, and so on until we reach our destination.  Then imagine sticking a giant fork into the grid and twisting it (like when you get spaghetti on a fork). The lines on the grid get caught by the fork and begin to twist with the fork. The lines may change length, and the 3D shapes made by the lines may be twisted such that the lines don't make boxes anymore, but the lines themselves aren't disappearing.  If the fork is like a black hole, the twisting has gotten so bad that certain movements from one box to an adjacent box start becoming physically restricted. If you are moving toward the black hole and keep moving, you'll eventually enter a box whose shape is such that you can't go back to the box you just came from: the only available adjacent boxes are located in the direction of the center of the black hole.  This is by no means a perfect analogy!!!"

What happens is that time dilation cause the ship to arrive at the 1 light year point in 1/223.6 of a year (from the perspective of the passengers), but length contraction also causes the distance to be only 1/223.6 of a light year, thus the speed is still perceived as 0.99999 c."

On large distances it is true that everything is moving away from everything else but over shorter distances, gravity comes into play. This is because the larger the distance, the more expansion is occurring as all of the universe is expanding at the same rate.

Insect pollination allowed angiosperms to dominate the world flora within 20 million years of their appearance, which is an extraordinary radiation. Without insects nearly all of the dominant flora would vanish within a couple hundred years."

There are also a lot of plants that have adapted to benefit from animals, e.g. via better seed dispersal or even herbivory. These would lose some of their competitive edge relative to other plants that don't have those adaptations and so they might not do well in the long run.  One potential effect is that without animals (especially nematodes) in the soil, bacterial communities could get out of hand and ultimately make the soil toxic to plant life.

If you mean agriculture, control over fire, and so on, that's different.  I'd say the odds are pretty long against it, partly because it's apparently only happened once on this planet and partly because our brains are ridiculously metabolically expensive."
AskScienceDiscussion,3annqf,dsws2,2,Mon Jun 22 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"By intelligence I think you likely mostly mean sentience and language.   As of now, it's impossible to say definitely at this point partly because of the randomness of mutation but moreso because of the complex nature of consciousness. But I would say one of the most important theories relating to this concept in evolutionary psychology is Social Brain Theory.  Social Brain Theory is a well-reguarded theory which basically purports that large and complex brains are generally most advantageous to animals in large social groups. Basically, the idea is that complex social decisions and interactions require a HUGE amount of brain resources. So if you wanted to guess which animals will find the most evolutionary success out of sentience and language, you'd have to find which animals find the most evolutionary success (not just directly mating, but food surplus and safety) out of large social interactions.   I'm not a dinosaur expert, so I have no idea which are the most social and which aren't. Or whether prehistoric biomes were particularly supportive of large groups of animals working together (think groups larger than a typical predator pack of 5 or something). But whichever animals were social (and not in a hive mind sense) will benefit from intelligence. So likely not all dinosaurs, or even many dinosaurs, but maybe a particularly social one that interacts outside of its family."
AskScienceDiscussion,3annqf,jevais2,3,Mon Jun 22 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"Also not an expert, but from my understanding of human development, one of the major factors was scarcity.  In particular, between the ice age and the relative lack of easily browsable food, the human species was forced by circumstances to gather up and search for and/or hunt food as a social effort.  So a herbivorous species is unlikely to develop the social need to coordinate hunting since plants aren't terribly wily. Herds form and move, but they don't need to plan in order to coordinate that movement.  And ""dinosaur times"" seems pretty lush from my understanding of the fossil record.  Meanwhile pure carnivores have a fairly limited maximum pack size compared to the herds they'd hunt.  I am not aware of there being a record of a social omnivorous species of dinosaur.  But chances are pretty good that if the extinction event hadn't been so sudden, a more general climate shift style pressure could have forced both food scarcity and omnivorous diet onto a population.  The next two turning points are tool use and cooking of food. The former turns out to be far more common than we used to think, with both primates and some bird species engaged in active tool use (to name at least two groups). The latter, cooking, was actually more significant, as it stopped food collection and consumption from dominating all waking hours.  So sure, there are plenty of precursors in the dinosaur record that could have led to sentience and language, but circumstances changed too abruptly from time of plenty to mass extinction."

Which is currently at 7 billion and growing exponentially. One of the most fundamental knowns about population growth is that populations increasing exponentially will hit a ceiling called 'carrying capacity'. At that point the population will plummet. Disease, famine, etc. will wipe out a significant amount of the population. And humans are not just reaching that carrying capacity, we're lowering it towards us by eliminating the resources that would define that cap. Meaning that as we destroy habitat, polute the environment and waste resources we are lowering the ability of the earth to hold us all. So we are both exponentially reaching for capacity, and also pulling that capacity towards us. Will it wipe us out entirely? Probably not, but some projections give our species no more than 100 years until we are also extinct."

AskScienceDiscussion,3anb4i,Amarkov,3,Mon Jun 22 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, couldn't have said it better myself.  (eta) An interesting, but ultimately unnecessary fact: the right hand rule is determined by the relationship between two kinds of mathematical objects: covectors and pseudovectors.   A covector is... like, if you tried to come up with a mathematical way to describe ""an amount of everything except a particular direction"", you'd basically come up with a covector. Compare this with a vector, which is an amount (magnitude) in a particular direction. In 3D space, a covector can be thought of as a plane along with a sense of rotation on that plane, because a plane is everything except a particular direction (namely, the direction that is perpendicular to the plane). A pseudovector is just like a vector - magnitude and direction - except that it's immune to reflections. In other words, if you reflect the whole space in a mirror (or something like that), the direction of a pseudovector stays the same, instead of flipping, like a normal vector would.   In 3D space, you can represent an oriented plane (a covector) by a pseudovector perpendicular to that plane. But there are two directions perpendicular to the plane. (Forward and backward, or above and below, or however you want to call them) The right hand rule is our convention for how to choose which one to use to represent a particular oriented plane."
AskScienceDiscussion,3anb4i,diazona,2,Mon Jun 22 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"The right hand rule works because of how we set up our xyz axes. http://biotelemetrica.pbworks.com/f/1229563756/xyzAxis.gif here we have (1,0,0)x(0,1,0)=(0,0,1), or to use i j k notation i x j = k, from the right hand rule. Also k x i=j and j x k=i. These rules make cross product using the right hand rule easy to work with, and this is why we call it a right handed coordinate system. Now imagine we switched the orientation of the z axis so down is now the positive direction. Now if we switch to the left hand rule all those same cross products work the same, and we call this a left handed coordinate system. So the right hand rule convention boils down to the more basic convention that we usually call up the positive direction."
AskScienceDiscussion,3amqtt,cyberpunkfuture,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by something that ""doesn't fit into our universe"", but it is possible to build weird atoms out of particles that aren't normally found in atoms. For example, there are particles called muons that are like electrons, except 207 times heavier. They're also unstable - they decay into lighter particles within a tiny fraction of a second. It's possible to replace an electron in an atom with a muon, and the muon's greater mass will cause it to orbit much closer to the nucleus than an electron would. This effect is used in some nuclear fusion experiments - because the muons stay much closer to the atomic nucleus, muonic atoms can ""pack together"" much more tightly. This gives the atoms a higher chance of fusing. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of energy to create the muons in the first place, so this looks unlikely to be a useful way of designing a nuclear fusion power plant.  Atoms have mass, and are therefore already subject to gravity. Some of these exotic atoms would be heavier than similar normal atoms, as they're made out of heavier particles, but I'm not sure how this would help with any sort of raygun.

When a metallic conductor is carrying current electrons make small energy jumps in the conduction band, but once that current oscillates at THz frequencies what would they do?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3ak4la,yeast_problem,2,Sun Jun 21 12:07:19 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm too stupid to get the question, but I'm pretty good with electronics and radio.  You start with a conductor at rest, which will have some set quantity of electrons and electrically neutral (no significant movement of electrons).    Now you apply a signal to the conductor.  There are many ways to apply such signal, but it will always result in application of force/power (volts) and usually also provide extra electrons to support sustained current.  The type of signal you are referring to typically provides little current because its force goes back and forth, pushing the electrons one way and then an instant later pulling the electrons back.  Net flow is very low and thus the quantity of electrons added to the system is small.  However, if you apply the force without providing a source of electrons the force is there but the current is extremely tiny (you can only motivate the valence electrons of the atoms already present in the conductor).  If you look up EMP, you will find that in spite of the extraordinary force present the important factor is the length of the conductor - which then provides a total net current that is possible.  You are thinking that if you apply 10 zillion volts to a conductor that there must be 10 zillion electrons present to 'conduct' that force.  That is not true.  A single electron can be 'excited' to 10 zillion volts and that single electron can then move to another atom and release that force, then kicking one or more other electrons off with the remaining force.  The current is how many electrons we coerce into movement.  The volts is how excited each electron is.  Power is the net effect of the current and force.  Think of a baseball game.  How many balls the pitcher throws is the current.  How fast each ball is propelled is the voltage/force.  Power is the total calorie burn that the pitcher exerts.  Am I helping at all?"

AskScienceDiscussion,3ajrjj,cblank21,7,Sat Jun 20 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"The salt would still become toxic unless you are pumping it back into the ocean.  Plus the output of desalination isn't ""brackish"", it's ""brine"". Brackish water is water that partway between fresh and salt water. That is you dilute sea water with fresh water to make brackish water. Since you are taking fresh water out of sea water when you desalinate, you are leaving behind a mixture that is far more salty than sea water. Which is what brine is.  And as you pour out the brine into the desert you'll have the water evaporate and you'll end up with a salt flat.  So the brackish algae are long dead in the brine, and the brine dwelling algae are not fast growing as they spend (relatively) horrific amounts of energy pumping the salt ions out of their interiors.  The third-gen biofules angle is flat out.  Oddly enough though, selling that salt would be a good secondary industry, as that's pretty much how ""sea salt"" is made from salty sea water.  Also remember that you can't ""suck"" the water into the desert, you have to build the pumps at the sea-side and along the mountainous water course, so power sourcing and distribution is hugely problematic.  In truth, it's cheaper to make the fresh water right there at the shore and then pump the fresh water around because the cost of pumping the waste fraction (e.g. the salt and the water that will remain in the brine) would account for ten to thirty percent of your pumping costs. And salt water is way corrosive so a long pipeline of salt water would be hella-expensive to maintain compared to a potable water pipeline.  So the real solution is to generate the solar energy et. al. in the desert and deal with the water problem separately. If one company is doing both the former can sell the power to the latter at bargain rates.  Sorry to rain on your parade there..."

That way you're generating energy from it instead of spending energy to pump it.  Desalinate it only when excess power from solar and wind has to be disposed of as a result of building excess capacity.  (Most forms of renewable energy, when they get to be a large percentage of our electric supply, will need either lots of storage or lots of excess capacity, to cover times like calm nights.  If they have enough to allow for that, they'll produce excess on windy sunny days.)  Evaporate the water at other times, along with the brine left when you do desalinate, and use or stockpile the salt.  The evaporated water will mostly precipitate out as it blows over the mountains, adding to the flow of rivers such as the Colorado that have heavy demands on them for irrigation."
AskScienceDiscussion,3akgqb,Lorix_In_Oz,4,Sun Jun 21 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"To an extent, yes, and Professor Pekka Pyykkö (one of the leading experts on theoretical calculations involving heavy elements) already did calculate the ground-states of elements for Z<=172 (although we can say for sure the accuracy will be increasingly bad the higher up it goes).   Nuclear stability/instability has no significance when it comes to calculating such properties; It's a good enough approximation to treat the nucleus of the atom as a simple point-charge without internal structure. But certain complicating factors arise when you work with heavier elements, mainly the fact that the innermost electrons gain enough speed that you have to take Special Relativity into account, and this complicates matters. Also, heavy elements naturally have a lot of electrons; if you want a highly accurate (in chemical terms) calculation, then 110 or so electrons is a significant number, even for light elements where the calculations are easier. If you want to make calculations on bulk matter or compounds then things get even worse. But anyway, these theoretical calculations do not involve any empirical, experimental data, so you don't have much less accuracy for these elements than you would when doing the same calculations for transuranics we already know about. In practice, you're restricted to some pretty basic properties of the element and simple compounds, as of yet.  Electron structure calculations are a far more accurate than predicting nuclear structure though, so one could say we can be more sure of the chemical properties of those elements than we are about their half-lives very existence of such an 'island'. From a practical chemical perspective it's likely moot though, as those 'stable' elements are generally only thought to be relatively stable by comparison to other transuranics, which still makes them highly unstable in everyday terms."

To begin with, if they were intelligent and relatively widespread, we should probably be finding some fossils of big-brained dinosaurs along with evidence of their evolutionary history.  The fact that we have zero evidence of this makes it incredibly unlikely prima facie, because signs of intelligence should exist in the fossils.    As far as evidence of their technology, it depends on how far along they got.  If they were not widespread and only evolved to the stone age, it might be possible to miss their primitive tools made out of wood, found metals, animal parts, stone, et cetera.    However, past that, they would start producing chemical and perhaps even nuclear compounds that do not exist in nature, such as bronze and eventually nuclear materials such as enriched Uranium and Plutonium.  Finding huge concentrations of refined Uranium with signs that it had decayed from U-235 enrichment would be pretty obvious evidence.

We could look for possible relics of a sentient dino civilization that are particularly long lived.  We would assume they used up environmental resources the same way we have in the course of industrial activity.  For example, are there traces of large scale mining/fossil-fuel consumption?  Sounds maybe a little preposterous, but there has been life on Earth long enough that at the time of the dinosaurs, previously dead organic matter buried in the earth would have had enough time to ""cook"" and be turned into petroleum and coal.  It has been suggested that the earliest conifer forests eventually formed massive coal deposits.

Possibly, so that they may pass on some knowledge. Another place to look would be in fossilized dinosaur poo. We can infer a lot about their behavior this way. They might have had a complex social order, or ate some food that would have required a tool. We could tell whether or not it took abstract thought to obtain this meal. Anyway, there are lots of ways we could identify some super smart dinos.  There's one big road block though. The prefrontal cortex. The thing we attribute to giving us our smarts. The dinos didn't have them. Now, a lot can be accomplished minus a prefrontal cortex. Look at the African Grey Macaw. It's the only other animal besides humans, that we know of for sure, to have asked an existential question. Alex, a bird, was being taught the different colors. He then asked the handlers, ""what color am I"". And that's when he learned what the color grey was. So really, the answer to your questions is yes.

AskScienceDiscussion,3agncb,SimonTheHoodOwl,8,Sat Jun 20 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"Depends a bit on what level you mean. But Pauling's The Nature of the Chemical Bond is indisputably the most significant chemistry textbook of the 19th century and maybe ever. (Berzelius' textbook in the 19th century might rival it) It's hard to overstate its impact.  Landau-Lifshitz's Course in Theoretical Physics is a massive and impressive work and still really good (if slightly dated). It's not the most pedagogical textbook, but there's a lot in those volumes.  On a more narrower and advanced topics, Parr and Yang's Density-Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules is a definitive work on DFT, although outdated in a few respects. For wavefunction methods Helgaker, Jørgensen and Olsen's Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory is a bit of a 'bible' to me as it's very comprehensive. Neither of these are hugely popular textbooks though."

AskScienceDiscussion,3agncb,oysterstout,3,Sat Jun 20 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, it's one source of a giant conflict among evo biologists. There are currently two highly opposed camps among evolutionary biologists, some that will argue the gene-centric view, and others that will argue a multi-level approach that includes individual fitness along with group fitness. Some of us think that the gene centered view is too constrictive, and the MLS view is misguided at best.        So it's helped to create something of a schism in the field. It was also an extremely important work that has had a huge impact on modern thought. And it's generally spot on on almost everything, just, like I said above, hard-line adherents don't seem to like to acknowledge its weaknesses. And some people would probably prefer it disappear entirely.      The other thing is just kind of an unfortunate choice on Dawkins' part to throw his hat in with the atheism thing.

They are easy prey for creationists who have developed extremely strong persuasive skills and remarkably good prima facie arguments. So it really isn't just a pain in the ass, it's a well organized attack on science as a whole.        But largely I just try to ignore them as much as possible, and I make every effort in the appropriate forums (like reddit) to help teach the science of evolution to the broadest possible audience, because an attack on education can only be  defended against with education.

As for Helmholtz, I guess it depends on what flavor of acoustics you favor. On the Sensations of Tone is largely focused on musical acoustics, and while it does dive somewhat into the physics to describe how things work, the focus on perception continues throughout.

They're probably the most talked-about set of books that cover physics in general.

I'm not sure there is one for particle physics, at least not my little piece of the field. If pressed, I might offer QCD and Collider Physics by Ellis, Stirling, and Webber, but there are other books that are IMO equally useful and equally common.  For general relativity, people swear by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler. It doesn't cover modern developments, but it's incredibly thorough.  For quantum computation, it would probably be Nielsen and Chuang.

A lay person who isn't familiar with the boundaries of such models ends up speaking gibberish by abusing the rhetorical models in ways they were never intended to be used.  I think you've unfortunately stumbled into such a quagmire.    The first thing to remember is that time is an intrinsic part of this universe and it makes very little sense to say things like ""before"" the Big Bang or ""before"" the beginning of the universe.    Your Pangea idea suffers from a great deal of vagueness where the notion of ""levels"" and ""space"" isn't really explained well in context.  I'm afraid you probably don't have the right idea to begin with as wording such as:   moving away from the epicenter of the Big Bang Event   suggests you are bound by a mental model that doesn't reflect the way physics at this level is currently understood.  Furthermore, it isn't clear at all what you mean to say by mentioning black holes here.  Inferring from your intentions, I am certain, your ideas can be clarified in formal terms using the tools of geometry.

AskScienceDiscussion,3aho6g,diazona,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:40:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I'm gonna start reading up and asking more questions later.
AskScienceDiscussion,3ahm3o,shakajuaa,3,Sat Jun 20 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the Sun dumps about 170,000 TW (170 PW) of luminous power on the Earth, so we'd have to replace somewhere around that. Problem is, humanity currently produces only ~17 TW of power (luminous, thermal, electric, etc), so we're off by a factor of 10000. That's bad news.  Really, assuming an infinite supply of resources and the ability to instantaneously use them makes this question so unrealistic as to be useless; infinities tend to break physics. Ignoring that, all the fossil and fissionable fuel currently or even slightly foreseeably accessible in the Earth's crust amounts to maybe one year of energy at 170 PW, depending largely on fissionable elements extracted from seawater (fossil fuels aren't even a blip at this scale). Presumably there's a lot more fission fuel spread throughout the crust over the entirety of its 10-50 km thickness (Wikipedia says some 10000 times as much for uranium, other fission fuels should be similar), though clearly extraction would be a hellish proposition. Fusing all the deuterium in the oceans will get us a few tens of thousands of years at 170 PW, and fusing all the hydrogen would give us some tens of millions of years."
AskScienceDiscussion,3ahm3o,Sakinho,3,Sat Jun 20 12:34:14 2015 UTC,Infinite supply of resources and the ability to instantaneously use them?

AskScienceDiscussion,3aglq1,pappypapaya,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:34:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Just read Feldman and Laland's paper.   While that does give me some insight into the influence of culture on biological evolution, which I think is quite consensual these days (I assume), and that has some common points in what I was describing (namely the similarities and differences of cultural and genetics transmission) I was wondering whether there are any papers that delve into the autonomous nature of cultural evolution.   In other words, the idea that culture not only influences biological evolution but it also serves a purpose similar to that of biological evolution and that is independent from it. Basically, that culture is in itself a tool that allows for adaptation on a temporal window that biological adaptation in itself does not  allow for.   Take the example behind pork consumption in the middle east or, again, in what is on the verge of speculation, the cultural reproval of non marital relationships in Abrahamic religions or in most if not all religions (that may be tied to the fact that STDs were common place back then and prophylactics didn't exist , among a myriad of other factors).   As such I'm talking about the concept that cultural evolution may serve a similar purpose (concrete adaptation to the environment and increased chances of survival) to that of biological evolution only it is not physical and, therefore, it doesn't require as much time for adaptation to occur. We didn't need to develop fur to explore Antarctica - we only made use of culture.  P.S - With the ultimate conclusion of this being that we are dealing with a new ""category of evolution"" that is a lot more reactive to external pressures and makes for a conflict between slower paced species which adaptation relies on purely biological evolution and a species that has a highly reactive evolutionary process that combines a long-term biological evolutionary process and a short term, highly efficient process of evolution based in cultural changes.   Hence, higher-thinking species (only humans) are able to make use of a process no other species has access to and that allows us to be the dominant species.   What I'm saying is that culture arised from a biological evolution (our advanced brains) but, in itself, it became a new mechanism of evolution, and that puts us in conflict with all other species, because we are on a whole new level of adaptation - which is the ultimate reason for the holocene.  In its turn, this also means that intelligent life, as a condition for the arise of culture, is in itself a mean, an evolutionary product, that allows for a by-product that allows for greater adaptation without physical change, thus rendering biological adaptation less important. We don't need wings to fly."
AskScienceDiscussion,3aglq1,AnecdotallyExtant,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"I encompass in the term ""culture"" everything achieved by humans but not intrinsic to their biological abilities. This goes from technology, to social organisation,       I would argue that at least these two examples are intrinsic to our biological abilities. They are a major part of what defines us as a species. But they can also be found in our closest living relatives. So they aren't just human, they are aspects of the chimp/human clade.      Another thing you may want to check out is culture among chimps.  It's somewhat disputed by cultural anthropologists, but is generally accepted in the biological sciences that chimps have culture. They certainly have social learning and within-troop bodies of knowledge that differ between groups. There is ton of literature on this so I'll just link google scholar search results rather than specific papers."

AskScienceDiscussion,3ae604,Lilyo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with that guess is that he's actively correct.  For example, when some of our ""Civilian Contractors"" went to the middle east they gave the local men a ration of shit for holding hands.  In that culture there is absolutely zero sexual context to holding hands. In our culture there is. So the ""Contractors"" started trying to instill a sense of sexual shame for the act. They tired to normalize their reaction to the scene. But rather than shifting their own expectations, which would involve deeply addressing their own emotional sense of shame and sexual identity, they simply tried to impose it on others.  It didn't work, of course.  These self declared ""icons of masculinity"" -- e.g. mercenaries -- literally couldn't overcome their feelings of embarrassment and shame enough to see that the locals had no such feelings; and to then question their own assumptions that backed those emotions.  The capacity to feel particular emotions is in-built.  The triggers for those emotions may be wildly different depending on personal history and ""acculturation"".  This is why we have words like acculturation to begin with. 8-)"
AskScienceDiscussion,3ae604,BitOBear,0,Fri Jun 19 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"Most emotions are by definition inherent innate responses (they're called primary emotions, such as fear, disgust, joy), and you do not have actual control over what emotions your brain triggers, they simply appear as responses to your environment. Secondary learned emotions such as shame, embarrassment, boredom, annoyance, etc. are taught and manifest as responses to primary emotions, social interaction, and abstract thinking. They are feelings about innate feelings based on different assumptions basically. Since these responses are learned they can obviously be developed in various degrees, but whether they can be completely removed from your thinking I don't think so unless you literally forget how to create an experience such as shame or guilt in your head. What you can do is feel the emotion of guilt and decide to ignore it, downplay it, or rework its logic, and this will in turn effect you behaviorally as its worked into your response system and continually reinforced. I also think you meant introspection, not self-consciousness in general.   http://cornercanyoncounseling.com/PDFs/patientEducation/Emotional%20Competence/Primary%20and%20Secondary%20Emotions.pdf"

AskScienceDiscussion,3acw6a,v4vijayakumar,16,Fri Jun 19 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  I am assuming you are using the term in its technical sense, e.g. teh way computer scientists use it, in which efficiency doesn't dictate speed, capability, or capacity.   So Efficiency is the ratio of the useful work performed by a machine or in a process to the total energy expended or heat taken in.  Since increases in efficiency involve less waste heat, but can never give you anything for free, all efficiency increases get you is a decrease of the support systems (like battery and cooling), but again, you still have to pay at least 100% of the cost of the outcome.  That said...  As processors shrink and give off less waste heat they begin fitting into smaller spaces and surviving longer. As processors increase the useful work per unit volume or transistor count they also move on the waste heat and size curves.  So smaller and more capable machines that don't require much additional cost to operate can then start being included in ""dumb applications"" to make them ""smarter"".  Understand that processors only really do four things. ""Remember"", ""Add"", ""Decide"", and ""Signal"" (meaning ""turn something on or off""). The larger functions of a processor system are illusions of complexity over a very small set of operations.   Now that understanding can be taken to absurd extremes, but I'm not suggesting we go that far.  But think of anything that can be turned on and off. Anything. No really... anything. From lightbulbs to a nerve signaling pain in your arm or your sleep cycle.  Processors, micro and otherwise, are to the future what the ""op-amp"" (operational amplifier) was to the past and present (and future, those things are super useful). Were the op-amp  gave us minute control over magnitude of things and signals, processors give us discrete (exact on/of) control over things including op-amps.  As processors get smaller the size of the ""smallest task possible"" gets smaller as well. This doesn't sound that impressive but it's the backbone concept of the last hundred years of technological advancement.  Think of tasks this way. For any given ""reasonable sized box"" the amount of control and awareness we can muster has been changing in such a way that if the box stays the same size, then the task set gets bigger, and if the box shrinks the task set sizer remains the same.  Now for just a moment understand that an ""amplifer"" can down-sample as well as upsample. So you can ""de-amplify"" with an amplifier. (I am saying that poorly but it works for now).  So where an automated process, like a machine/data-controlled router, had a ""reasonable box"" size of my kitchen table in the fifties and could churn out many copies of one device -- in the future a machine/data controlled of the same complexity might be smaller than my little finger. You aren't going to make a chair leg with one of those, but you could put it on a probe and have it carefully remove plaque from arteries or disentangle and free nerves from tumor masses under computer control.  Larger systems on the macro scale could net small light bulbs that watch you and decide where you need the light instead of just radiating the same light in all directions.  Little regulators could be implanted in your system to mitigate pain or depression by amplifying or muting various signals in your nervous system.  But none of this should be viewed as a semi-magical result of changes in size, power, or efficiency. Many of these tasks can be done now with large machines. The problem is not one of deciding what to do or really opening new doors. It's all really about the question of making the box a reasonable size for the task.  So that's the foreseeable future, and it will be surprising because most people don't realize how much of the world could be ""regulated better"" to positive effect.  It's also part of the danger as sometimes ""better regulated"" is Orwellian code-speak for ""better controlled"" in the constraining sense.  I don't really fear the latter as the more control you think you have the less you can really control effectively. There are limits to the executive function in any system. There are limits to the ability to decide moment-to-moment.  So people are talking a lot about ""transhumanism"" but we'll be fixing our stuff long before we get into fixing ourselves properly.  So look at any stupid machine or process and think ""That could be smarter"" and someone will slap a processor there eventually if the reasonably sized box can be made to fit."

So while it is true in a trivial sense that any computation can be performed by any system, given enough memory and time, many practical applications of computing rely on completing certain tasks at certain speeds in order to be intelligible by humans.

AskScienceDiscussion,3acw6a,trlababalan,0,Wed Jun 24 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"Moore's Law doesn't say that. Intel executive David House said that processing power would double every 18 months, however. He's probably disappointed in his company if that's the case, given their abysmal performance gains.  And it hasn't held true for several years, for whatever that's worth. Take a look at the enthusiasts running liquid nitrogen-cooled processors. AMD FX-8150s reach 8GHz. AMD FX-8350s are <10% faster per cycle and also reach 8GHz. They just stop functioning after 8GHz, can't even boot into the OS. Since Bulldozer released in 2011 (?), they've come out with the Steamroller core in 2014 (Excavator has yet to launch) which is a whole 10% faster than Piledriver and a net <20% gain over Bulldozer. Three years of R&D led to that.  Intel consumer chips, I'm not too sure about, but I think they hit 6-7GHz under LN2 regardless of architecture. If anything, the earlier ones do better. And it's been 5% gains every single year since Sandy Bridge in 2011; Skylake is looking to be a whopping 10% faster than 2013's Haswell and the cumulative gains are 20ish% over Sandy Bridge. In four years.  So frequencies are stagnant. IPCs - instructions per cycle - are barely moving forward. But transistor density is increasing! (EDIT: Well, would be increasing if TSMC had smaller fabs for high-performance chips. We've been stuck with 28nm from them since 2012. Even then, the same 28nm node has been manipulated to fit more transistors into a given space after a few years of effort.) Performance has barely been touched, but that doesn't matter too much. The new method for adding performance is cramming more cores into a die. Just look at GPUs. AMD's GCN architecture, released in 2012, crammed 2048 shader cores into its flagship's die, the Tahiti core. The next line-up in 2013 released Hawaii, using a slightly revised (but effectively the same) version of GCN with up to 2816 shaders on a single die. And next Wednesday, the Fury X and its Fiji core with 4096 shaders will be available.  Intel's server chips are just stupid. Over time:   Nehalem-EP had up to 4 cores and supported up to 2 sockets per board Westmere-EP had up to 6 cores and supported up to 2 sockets per board Sandy Bridge-EP had up to 8 cores and supported up to 4 sockets per board Ivy Bridge-EP had up to 12 cores and supported up to 4 sockets per board Haswell-EP has up to 18 cores and supports up to 4 sockets per board   That's just the EP label. The EX label is (well, was - Haswell-EP and EX both have 18 cores on a die) even further ahead generally speaking.  But even that can't last forever. One big issue is latency. Going back to Haswell-EP, there are actually three dies produced for the line, one with 8 cores, one with 12, and a 662mm2 monster with 18. Article here. The larger two dies have two separate memory controllers. Those ringbuses are only going to get bigger by cramming more cores into a die, and that can not last forever. Intel released roadmaps for Skylake-EP with up to 28 cores and 6 channels of DDR4 goodness (vs current server chips' 4, older server chips' 3, and current consumer chips' 2). Unless they redid the layout, my bet is two ringbuses with 10 cores and one with 8 and 3 dual-channel memory controllers. Alternatively, it's a new design entirely. Or perhaps 14nm, being smaller than 22nm, helps with latency and allows two 14-core ringbuses and two tri-channel controllers."

Since 0.3m is 1 nano-light-second, we want  R_g = 0.3 * 3.2x106 * 1x10-9 ls = 9.6x10-4 ls  So the mass required is 9.6x10-4 * 2x105 = 192 solar masses.  I've probably gone wrong with the maths somewhere since I pulled all the constants from memory, and IFAIK that equation is only valid for a point mass, which the earth obviously isn't.

Will we be able to make and control any fusion reliably?  If so are we going to eventually mine out all the usable fuel in our solar system?  Given enough energy usage and enough time we will deplete all the easily usable fission, fusion and combustion fuels and be left with either mining the sun or using as much of its radiated power as possible.

So all artificial habitats, from your lawn to your house to your office building are a balance between the questions of square-footage (area) versus cubic-footage (volume).  So you can have vaulted ceilings or you can have a second story.  So you can have more floor space in your office tower or a nice atrium.  Along with the square-versus-cube issue is the power and lighting and heat control (dissipation vs conservation).  So really a ""large and thin"" structure equidistant from a heat/light source is a really good idea.  I doubt the Dyson sphere would be a good model for a natural star, but it might make a nice ""very large space station"" around an internal/artificial radiator (""star"").  The illusion of unlimited overhead space plus the availability of massive square-footage over which to ramble is wired into our monkey brains. It is likely to be wired into any surface-dwelling intelligence, and it might be the ultimate horror to a subterranean evolved intelligence where to be safe and home is to be enclosed and buried.  So the real question is ""where are the good orbits and how continuously can we fill them before it becomes self defeating.  In my humble opinion The Real Problem™ with a Dyson sphere is that it would not only catch all the energy of the star, it would catch 100% of the mass ejected from the star, so it would start taking on massive amounts of mass, as it were. It would likely suffer structural failure as it got heavier and heavier.  Individual planets and significant solar-system bodies deflect most of the ejection mass of their star because of EM fields and whatnot, and the average planet just doesn't have that much cross-section to the solar wind anyway.  Getting rid of 1.6x1012 kg of mass for every minimal ejection is pretty heady stuff, even when the sphere would be very heavy indeed.  The lack of the ability to ""shunt aside"" the various radiations means that they would all have to be absorbed.  The actual closed Dyson structure would be a mess."

Asking why a civilization would need to form a dyson sphere is like asking why the original photosynthetic bacteria would need to go on to practically coat the whole surface of the planet in photosynthetic life.  It's far more energy than one bacteria would ever need, after all.  But the energy is there, and any descendants of the bacteria that multiply to take advantage of it will leave even more descendants, who will then carry the tendency to multiply more, and so on.  Any human cultures, replicating technologies, or whatever, that have both the ability and desire to build solar panels and replicate themselves will do so.  Then there will be more of them.  Their ""offspring"" (new solar panel machines, new orbiting colonial outposts, whatever) that carry that same knowledge and social tendency will go on to gather more life coming off the star.  And so on.  A dyson sphere is just an ecological niche that's really full.  It doesn't matter if other branches of humanity decide to tap some other energy source, any more than all photosynthetic life is going to up and decide that tapping hydrothermal vents for energy is the way to go.  Different groups tap different niches."

AskScienceDiscussion,3abgnv,EricRP,3,Thu Jun 18 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons why wind storms are not very good for wind power generation.   Most generators are designed to operate a set range of speeds, and anything outside that range will reduce the efficiency of the generator. Increasing the wind speeds by 100% will not increase the electrical output by 100%.   We still don't have economic means for storing energy from the grid so any energy generated by wind turbines needs to be consumed right away. A short period of increased power generation won't provide any benefits unless there is a sharp rise in energy demand at the exact same time that cannot be supported by the main power generators (usually fossil fuel), which is extremely unlikely.  The third reason is that wind turbines aren't immune to stormy conditions and any damage that they will take will outweigh the benefits of increased power generation.

AskScienceDiscussion,3abgnv,Teanut,3,Fri Jun 19 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"Wind turbines will usually ""feather"" their props to slow down as the wind picks up force.  Then there is a point where the total amount of pressure on the blades is ""pushing on"" the bearings too much and the generator itself is endangered, so the generators feather to props to neutral and then lock the rotor so it cannot spin at all.  Why?  The wind hitting the front of the blades turn them but it also pushes them straight back. So if you rub one thumb on your other palm back-and-forth at a fixed speed you can feel the amount of heat generated change as you keep the speed fixed but press harder. The wind pushing straight back against the ""thrust bearing"" can cause the same sort of traumatic heating problems.  It is completely possible to build turbines that would work well in very high wind speeds. You'd want an array of smaller systems and you'd design the bearings differently. I think some of the turbine strips they were proposing for the roof-edges of very large buildings are designed for sustained operation in that sort of wind because the wind shear that comes up the side of the building and over the top has been magnified by the pressure/speed concentrating effect of the face of the building.  So the problem is one of ""whether it's wort it"". Since large diameter and surface area blades are better for slower consistent winds, what would be the value of a larger field of small turbines to catch the fast wind? How often does the speed change? Is it often enough to make the maintenance cost for two systems to be worth the dollar cost to keep it all running?

Absent that force the entire mass of the planet would succumb to inertia and each particle would rush along the straight-line trajectory it was on at the moment gravity was suspended.  Well not exactly, the compression forces of the rock layer are balanced by considerable pressure in the earth's interior. That balance would be gone so things would be launched from the surface.  /u/Tomvtv said fifteen meters, but I don't think that includes the various titanic forces that are opposing or created by gravity. Those include all the magma forces, but also include all the pressurized gases in the crust and the action of the ""not steam"" water that is ""not steam"" because of pressure.  At a minimum every single fault that is under non-zero pressure would probably go off at the same time.  Water and magma would mix in all the subduction zones in seconds.  Even if it didnt, lifting the entire ocean fifteen meters and then dropping it would shatter the mantle and water and magma would mix quite agressively.  At those speeds 30 seconds would be enough to shed all of the air and water for sure. Since the air would be moving with the water and the rock there would be no friction to keep the objects in place or resist their outward plunge.  When gravity was restored what hadn't moved too far away would then be drawn back to the center of mass. The heat of impact would be tremendous putting nuclear detonations to shame as literal mountains of rock plummeted core-ward.  The moon would also travel a non-trivial distance in a straight line. It probably wouldn't get far enough away to escape the earth's restored gravity. As a result it's new orbit would be stretched from nearly circular to significantly elliptical. That would create a 14-day cycle of varying tidal disruption, not just of whatever water and air we got back, the tidal forces would repeatedly crack and distend the earth's crust so we'd get increased lunar-tide induced earthquakes and vulcanism as a regular two-week cycle.  Basically you'd make the earth back into a magma ball nearly identical to its initial formation, or a blasted and steam cookded wasteland full of over-turned mountains and lava. Everything would likely be killed except for maybe some very lucky and unlikely extremophile bacteria.  Literally look up ""exploded view"" of any object and then imagine all the separate pieces that comprise the earth then imagine those parts slamming back together."

So if gravity was suddenly turned off, everything sitting on the ground would experience a short sharp kick upwards as the ground bounced back, and anything not being held down would start floating upwards.  Not to mention, springs in every suspension in the world would decompress and send cars, trains, airplanes (that were sitting on the ground) flying up.  Boats, on the other hand, experience an upward force equal to the weight of the water they displace, and that also suddenly goes to zero.

AskScienceDiscussion,3a9eu3,TangentialThreat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:19:48 2015 UTC,"That is a very sensible explanation.  Rayleigh scattering is well-known to create blue-colored air, and they offer an explanation of why its effect is pronounced on Uranus and Neptune but not on Jupiter and Saturn.  Until now, every time I've seen or heard it explained, the astrophysicists say simply ""the methane absorbs the red"" and move on as if that's the whole explanation.  Still, I noticed that your link does attribute some of the blue to methane absorption.  So now the real mystery is why do people think methane absorbs red light when every single spectrogram I've ever seen for methane shows it transmitting visible light unattenuated."
AskScienceDiscussion,3a9eu3,ouemt,2,Thu Jun 18 09:12:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, so.   I looked up the optical constants for methane, and could only find data on liquid and solid methane in the time I was willing to spend (sorry).

That being said 2E-7 is still basically transparent.  This value is comparable with silica glass.   I buy the Rayleigh explanation."
AskScienceDiscussion,3a9eu3,dsws2,3,Thu Jun 18 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"Those spectra clearly show that Uranus and Neptune are blue, but which of the dips in reflectivity are attributable to methane?"
AskScienceDiscussion,3a9eu3,HiverR,0,Thu Jun 18 07:28:47 2015 UTC,"Part of the explanation may be Doppler shifting at high temperature deeper in the planets.  (The interiors of gas giants are hot, same as the inside of Earth is.)  When molecules are moving fast, that red-shifts and blue-shifts the light they absorb.  So lines in the near-IR may be shifted into the visible.  Pressure (also very high deep in a gas giant) also smears out spectrum lines.  Spectra are normally measured at relatively low pressures and temperatures, so that the lines will be distinguishable.    Finally, discussions of spectra tend to emphasize wavelengths where there are relatively few lines, each relatively strong, so that you can get useful information out of them.  As you go to higher energy levels, the lines tend to be more numerous and weaker.  So even if no appreciable absorption bands in the red wavelengths show up in a spectrum of the light passed through a small sample, light passing through kilometers of a high-pressure gas (or supercritical fluid) of the same molecule might have lots of absorption."

AskScienceDiscussion,3aa4vy,WaldoWow,4,Thu Jun 18 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"The biggest one in the last few years was probably the supposed Arsenic biochemistry of the GFAJ-1 bacterium.  Basically, this microbiologist named Felicia Wolfe-Simon who was working for NASA said that in 2009 she found a bacterium that's adapted to live in the extreme environment of a hypersaline lake with one of the highest arsenic concentrations in the world.  The basic currency of energy that biochemical processes use in all known organisms is ATP, which stands for adenosine triphosphate. When many proteins in the body do things that are energy-intensive, they ""fuel"" that action by essentially breaking off one or more of the three phosphate groups from the molecule, activating the stored energy in the chemical bond.  Likewise, cells consume outside resources via various chemical reactions to recreate those chemical bonds.  For example, a glucose molecule is consumed by eukaryotes in the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria to create two ATP molecules.  What she supposedly found in 2010 was that these GFAJ-1 organisms were adapted to use at least some arsenic instead of phosphorus in their basic biochemical processes.  Arsenic is chemically similar to phosphorus, being in the same group on the periodic table, so chemically it's somewhat plausable. The implication, however, is that it supposedly confirmed that it could be chemically possible for other modes of life exist in the universe that, at the most basic level, could be totally different from everything known to be possible on Earth.   Of course, this was highly controversial, and all follow up studies failed to find any arsenic at all.  There was some speculation that she may have made it up to gain notoriety or publicity, not the least because GFAJ supposedly stands for ""Give Felicia A Job."""

The bottom surface of the drivewheel is always stationary compared to the road, unless the car is skidding. So assuming a rear wheel drive car:- The front wheels roll at 201 mph until they touch the surface of the ramp, when they slow to 1mph, not without a little screeching I guess. The back wheels push the car up the ramp at 1mph relative to the plane. The rear wheels, the drive wheels, catch up with the ramp and on contact with the ramp accelerate the car from 1mph relative to the plane to 201mph, the speed the wheels are going. Again more tyre screeching. During this time the car will have launch itself into the front wall of the cargo bay so any further conjecture is of little use to the driver. For this stunt to work, the rear wheels of the car would need to be able to slow from 201mph to 1mph as soon as they contact the ramp, otherwise the car is projected through the plane and huge Hollywood explosion of plane and car results."
AskScienceDiscussion,3aaaza,sleepydog404,2,Thu Jun 18 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"The car is going at 1mph relative to the plane, which is fine. The issue is the rotation of the wheels.

They are going to have to slow down a lot the front, non-driving, wheels are going to to brake themselves against the floor of the hold. I would guess this would involve a fair amount of rubber being stripped off, but I don't know enough about cars (is that something ABS would deal with?). The rear wheels are the issue. If you keep power to them, they are going to try to accelerate the car to 201mph relative to the plane - bad news! So the instant they hit the plane, the clutch needs to go down so that there's no power getting through. Then the situation is the same as the front wheels.  I don't see it being possible with anything other than a rear wheel drive vehicle, unless there's a four wheel drive car that can cut the transmission to the front wheels separately."

AskScienceDiscussion,3aaaza,Hayes231,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"It works just fine. Basically once the drive wheels hit you just let off the gas and/or brake to slow down. A cargo plane is going to give you plenty of room for deceleration. Inertia means that the car will continue to go the same speed it was before. You would have to add further energy to increase it's speed more. The amount of inertia in the engine and drivetrain is pretty minimal compared to the mass of the car (especially in a high-performance supercar) so it won't add much energy from there.  a)  you would probably pick up some speed but since you're already drafting by that point, it's not like the amount of airflow goes from 200 mph to 0 mph suddenly. As you got into the plane's slipstream, you would find that the amount of power needed to maintain your speed decreases the closer you got to the ramp.  b) all-wheel drive I could see maybe causing some issues, front or rear wheel drive I think would both be fine.  c) Only if you kept your foot to the floor. If you've got a car capable of doing 200 mph it would certainly have enough power to break the drive wheels free and start spinning before it stalled out.  d) It would read whatever speed the drive wheels are moving relative to the surface. I.e. if they're spinning on the ramp they will read whatever speed they're spinning at. That is, if the wheels are spinning at, say, 2000 rpm and the car would normally be going 150 mph when the wheels are turning that speed then the speedo would read 150 mph.  e) The car would stop relative to the surface it's on, the plane's cargo deck in this case. If you're walking down the aisle of a plane in the middle of a flight and stop walking, do you fly to the back of the plane? No? Well, same concept here. The only way the car is going to fly out the back is if some force acts on it. Say, the hero jumps out of the car and leaves it in neutral and the cars rolls out the back when the plane pitches up to climb to altitude.  f) it wouldn't so this question is irrelevant.   The Mythbusters actually tested this one too with a car driving into a trailer on the back of the big rig. The same principles would apply for your airplane question.    As seen in the TV series Knight Rider, a moving car can safely transition from a road into a moving big rig via ramp. CONFIRMED To test this myth, the MythBusters first started with a small scale test using a toy car. Simulating the Knight Rider stunt, the MythBusters found that the toy car could enter the big rig safely without a sudden and dangerous acceleration that many people had feared. They then tested the stunt at full scale using a Chevy Camaro, the rebadged version of the Pontiac Trans Am used in Knight Rider. They tested at both 30 miles per hour and 55 miles per hour with no difficulty. The MythBusters explained that, even when hitting the car’s ramp, the car’s inertia keeps it going at the exact same speed relative to the ground — which lets it safely drive into the big rig, with no surprising accelerations. Jamie then reinforced the myth by safely exiting the moving semi truck in reverse. Also all of their experiments took place during a rain storm."

As you shrink the cell you decrease the volume as a cubic function, but decrease the surface area as a square function. Meaning that the volume would shrink much more rapidly than the surface area.         Since cells rely on a lot of cell surface proteins, and are enclosed in a bi-layer of phospholipids, each cell would be more costly on the whole. Also, there would be 100 times more of them, further increasing the cost of cell production by two orders of magnitude. It seems to me that it would also have less leeway regarding solute concentration; lower volume means that it can't uptake as much water without lysing, so it would have to more carefully control solute concentration, requiring still more energy.   On the other hand, the cell would more efficiently uptake what it needs and transport gene products, waste products, etc. Which would be more economical.       Seems like on the whole cells would be a lot more costly on average."

We have fossils from 2 billion years ago of stromatolites.  Stromatolites are funny-shaped rocks that are formed by bacterial action.  Bricks are funny-shaped rocks that are formed by human action.  A brick that gets buried under the proper conditions is going to stick around at least as long as a stromatolite.  The same goes for pretty much any hard object that humans produce, and likely even things like plastics.  We have soft tissue impressions from the cambrian era, after all.  If preserved under the right conditions, a spoon or plastic toy or glass will remain apparent in the rock for as long as the rock remains.  Even if the plastic decays or the metal rusts away, the void can be filled with dissolved minerals.  Indeed, this is how many fossils are formed..the original shell is gone, and the remains are mineral replacements.  For that matter, we have fossils of burrows from the late cambrian.  If a burrow in the mud can form a fossil that lasts half a billion years (and the only reason we don't have older is that there were no burrowing organisms before then) a human object could last just as long.  There's also the matter of a major mass extinction showing up in the fossil record, alongside movement of animal groups across the world near instantaneously.  The echoes of humanity's imprint on the distribution of life on this planet are going to echo down for a very long time.    Mind you, all this is not going to be obvious from the surface.

Behaviors could be induced, basically by producing toxins for bad choices or endorphin production stimulators for good ones. Successful hosts will be successful individuals who can always, or more often, provide the best conditions for their masters.   Individual species of micro organisms would only exhibit a single response trigger, or part of one, but the personal blend of each individual host has had plenty of time to evolve a synergistic relationship that could, reasonably or not, have led to Man's evolution and higher brain functions.

You can find all kinds of lists online, with countries ranked by share of the organic market (not a particularly good indicator to me), ranked by the UNEP (better), and by some private non-profits and NGOs (may have agendas predicated on non-scientific principles). I have some perhaps unusual ideas to think about in terms of what makes for sustainable ag for a country though.  The countries which come to mind to me are Cuba, Mauritius, France, and Spain. Seems like a strange list, no? Cuba and Mauritius have been (or were) isolated from global agricultural markets for decades. In Cuba's case, they were denied access not only to food imports, but to food technology and equipment imports by the US-led embargo. As strange as it may seem, Cuba has become a world leader in sustainable agriculture and medical education because they found themselves in a situation where they had to learn to produce products (in this case food and doctors) without almost any outside help. Consequently, they got very good, through trial and error, at producing local food without much hydrocarbon inputs and medical schooling. Huffington post has an interesting article that might lead you elsewhere.  Mauritius is in similar circumstances for different reasons. A poor country that is physically isolated as an island country in the Indian Ocean (along with the Maldives, Reunion (French), Madagascar, and Sri Lanka), they have had to feed their population locally for more than a century. They also have some pretty amazing environmental protection laws, because tourism is there main source of income (some of the best beaches in the world). So they are similar to Costa Rica in this sense. If Eco-tourism is your main source of income, you have some serious economic reasons to invest in environmental protection.  Spain and France have traditional food cultures which are protected both nationally and by the EU with trade barriers. These countries are defined largely by their agricultural identities (cooking, seafood, wine, spirits, cheese, and cured meats). This encourages a bit of agricultural isolationism, and also some very high standards on protecting food products as IP (more or less). This has meant that the countries have been fairly resistant to a lot of the mainstream, Green-revolution type agricultural innovations of the post-WWII world. As such, they have a large portion of farm acreage devoted to 'artisan' production, which is about as traditional and sustainable as you can get, although not producing high yields. Spain is also at the forefront of some innovative off-shore aquaculture ventures, which makes sense, again, in terms of their food culture. Spain is about as much of a seafood nation as you can imagine (with a population largely distributed along coastlines, with interior spaced dominated by steppe, desert, and alpine environments).    So, if I were you, those are the places I'd start looking at. Also, there are some US universities with strong sustainable ag programs (Virginia Tech and Washington State University both come to mind) and large online presences. You can start mining their websites for permaculture, sustainable ag, organic ag, and alternative ag/forestry information."

My answer to your question is, no, the momentum of the flowrider would not be the same as a surfer, because the surfer has the same sort of dynamics as the flow rider, in addition to the surfer's motion relative to the shore/earth.  However, I would argue that such a distinction is irrelevant; the dynamics of waveriding only depend on the motion and position of the rider relative to the wave.

The same is true of surfing (both kinds), so that's actually a very good comparison.   The surfer (in both cases) shifts weight slightly, causing the board to change angles, which in turn causes the water to catch it differently, moving the board relative to the rider. Like a bike, this same effect can be used to maintain balance or to initiate a more dramatic change in direction/momentum.   In all of these cases, the most important relationship is the relative motion of the medium (water/ground) and the control surface (board/wheel)."
AskScienceDiscussion,3a3t1k,MarcusDrakus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:34:21 2015 UTC,"Very little of your stability on a bike comes from gyroscopic forces. It comes mostly from small steering corrections.   If this is true, then why will a bike continue upright down the road until it runs out of momentum or hits something after you jump off?  In this context there is no input whatsoever aside from gyroscopic forces, proving that steering inputs aren't necessary for balance, only to change direction.  Only when your momentum drops below a certain threshold do your inputs become more important."
AskScienceDiscussion,3a3t1k,antiduh,2,Wed Jun 17 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"It's a lot more complicated than that though. I tried to make this clear in my original post, but the dynamics of a bike happen to be very complicated.  A bike with no rider still experiences steering corrections - if the bike leans to one side, the way that the tire makes contact with the surface changes, and so the tire is turned. However, that causes the bike to experience centrifugal forces, which pull it back in the other direction. It balances out to a negative feedback loop, trying to keep the bike level.  Part of the stability comes from the gyroscopic forces. Part of it comes from the steering dynamics.  More to the point, my argument was that a bike-and-rider system has catagorically different dynamics than a surfer-and-surfboard. A surfer and surfboard have no 'internal momentum'; all momentum is relative to something external to the surfer-surfboard system. That's not true on a bike, because the wheels have momentum.  So I disagree with the assumption that the momentum and stability of one explains the stability of the other; a bike's stability and a surfer's stablity are qualitatively different things.  In the end, speaking to the core of the question, the momentums aren't the same between the ocean surfer and the waverider surfer - the ocean surfer has momentum with respect to the shore. But I argue that such a distinction is spurious and has nothing to do with the stability or balance dynamics of the surfer in either surfing scenario. It doesn't matter that all of the momentums aren't the same, because the one momentum - the one relative to the wave - is the only one that matters.  Hence my answer - the stability of the surfer-surfboard system only depends on the interactions with the water touching the surfboard, and nothing else."

Then try adding and removing weight to the wheels to get their angular momentum to match at a few different levels. Repeat your ""jump off"" experiment at various speeds for all cases.  I think you will find that the fork/wheel geometry has a greater effect than the wheel's angular momentum for most normal bikes without dramatically increased weight on the wheel.  Reference"
AskScienceDiscussion,3a3t1k,MarcusDrakus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"Changing the fork/wheel geometry can significantly alter how the front wheel tracks.  For example, if your fork is at 90 degrees straight up (considered zero rake), then any force applied to the side of the wheel can cause it to turn or wobble rapidly as speed builds.  If the rake is increased, the forces acting on the sides of the wheel are reduced and stability increases.  Check out this great explanation.  The article you point to is interesting, but I do see a flaw:  Because you can make a bicycle stable without the gyroscopic effect doesn't mean that traditional bicycles don't rely on it.  In fact, the experimental bike they made in no way resembles a traditional bike, so it's kind of an apples to oranges comparison.  Good article though, thanks for putting that link up.

Just think about how to harness the gyroscopic effect, balance on a rigid bike without moving, and the effect of microcorrections of the front wheel independently of each other -- all such experiments derive from that same basic concept. If you can separate those, you can measure them independently.

AskScienceDiscussion,3a3wfe,SerBeardian,11,Wed Jun 17 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"GR and SR are not ""different theories"". Special Relativity is a special case of General Relativity. The special case is non-warped space-time. In other words, GR wouldn't be General (read: ""Always true"") Relativity if it didn't give SR given that special condition. The reason we pull SR aside is partly because it's easy to get a handle on things and make way for our minds to understand the general case. In other words:   But when you add high velocities or high gravity into the equations, the whole thing (GR) starts to break or give nonsense.   Is wrong.   Similar: The physics we understand work great, until you get to the quantum level where it begins to break down, so we developed Quantum Physics to explain all that.   The thing is, that these MUST not be truly separate. Newtonian mechanics is easy and useful, but it is a special case of some more general theory. In particular, we would have a HUGE problem accepting QM if we could not reproduce Newtonian physics in some way (similar to GR reproducing SR in a given limit). A common exercise for students in QM is to reproduce harmonic motion (spring motion) from the quantum analogue. The limit for this is that the energy in the oscillator is much greater than the ""quantum of energy"" (energy difference between energy levels) in an oscillator. The results is a bit awkward, since you are left with a ""probability density"" of where to find a particle, but it is exactly what you expect from looking at a pendulum without knowing when it was started (e.g. more likely to be found at the ends where it spends more time because of reduced velocity than in the middle)."

Nobody knew that those special rules for high-velocity/gravity and quantum particles even existed (or even would exist) at the time when initial physics rules were being laid down since we couldn't get to relativisitic speeds or examine quantum particles (if we even knew about them in the first place). We knew that we needed these special case rules when we first started observing things travelling at relativistic speeds, or seeing the effects of super-high gravity, or by discovering subatomic particles. The rules may have always been there, but nobody knew about them until we started needing them to explain these special cases.  If Special/Quantum rules are a ""special case"" or ""in these specific circumstances"" subset of normal physics, could there not be a ""in the special case of time travel"" subset of rules to causality that we just have not had a chance to investigate simply because we so far lack any examples of time travel to study?"

AskScienceDiscussion,3a297u,jackster_,3,Tue Jun 16 22:25:39 2015 UTC,"While there are individual differences in morning/evening preference, the timing of the body's circadian rhythm is primarily set by your light exposure patterns. Taking this to the extreme, if you were to stop using artificial light altogether and begin spending most of your day outdoors exposed to natural light, you would become a morning person, regardless of whether you are an early or late riser in your normal life.  Artificial light tends to predispose people to later schedules. The reason for this is that light exposure in the evening and early night (when most artificial light is used) has the effect of delaying the circadian clock. This results in the body's internal signals for sleep onset and morning awakening occurring later than they otherwise would. Cue insomnia and difficulty waking up on time in the morning.  Moreover, staying indoors in a light-controlled environment tends to exacerbate this, since light exposure in the morning shifts the circadian clock back earlier.  Of course, few people are willing to abandon artificial light altogether and spend all their days outdoors. But the basic principles can still be applied -- maximize exposure to bright sunlight in the morning and minimize exposure to artificial light after sunset, especially in the hour before bed. Make it a habit to turn down the lights a couple of hours before bed. Install f.lux on computers to reduce blue light content. And don't use electronic devices in the time leading up to bed.  In addition, it's important to maintain stable schedules. It's pointless maintaining an earlier schedule during the week if you are going to stay up many hours later on weekends. The circadian clock will never fully adapt to this type of schedule; the result is a form of permanent jet-lag, called ""social jet-lag"". Circadian rhythms will be shifted much later by the weekend schedule and then take most of the work week to shift back, all the while making it difficult to fall asleep as early as needed on work nights. Ideally, sleep shouldn't be occurring more than an hour later on days off than on work days."

The fact that you see one within 5 minutes is just a coincidence, and further indicative of the infestation. Spiders need to eat, which means there are a lot of bugs; lots of bugs means moisture and food.  Clean the place up, get rid of water sources, cut back nearby weeds, and set traps as needed. Sleep well!  As for seemingly 'predicting the future', this is just a mix of confirmation/observer bias.  You probably forget about the times you wake up and don't see a spider; the times you do see one are more memorable so it seems unusually frequent.  It could olso be a sampling bias; maybe you're just unlucky."
AskScienceDiscussion,3a2sgm,AnecdotallyExtant,4,Tue Jun 16 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"Your question is hard to understand. I'm not sure what you mean by 'a fluid'. But time is one of four dimensions of space-time. And it seems like that's where this question is coming from. In the simplest sense, time is affected by a number of things, but it doesn't act like a fluid, at least not in the way you're describing. It doesn't seek the most direct path, but it is relative.         There is something called gravitational time dilation, which seems to be what you're getting at. When you're deeper in the 'gravitational well', meaning that you're closer to the center of gravity of a massive body, time as measured by your clock will slow down. This is a result of the relativity equations. Specifically, time will vary according to this equation:       √(1-(2GM)/(rc2 ))      The G in that equation is gravity, which varies with the distance to the massive body. So gravity does affect the way an observer experiences time.   There is also a time dilation due to velocity. The faster an observer is moving with respect to another clock, the slower the other clock will appear to move. This is due to a different relativistic effect and time will vary according to this equation:     √(1-(v2 )/(c2 ))      The velocity in that equation will shorten time as it is experienced by the observer moving very fast with respect to another observer.       (As a side note, these two effects are responsible for the twin paradox. An astronaut who is the older of a set of twins will age slower than his twin on earth and will return to earth as the youngest of the twins. (The paradox is not actually a paradox, it has been resolved and confirmed experimentally.))          So time is not a constant thing for all observers, but I'm not sure how it can be said to be called a fluid. I suppose you could say that is fluid, to the extent that fluid can mean that it changes. But thinking of it as a fluid isn't really accurate in the way I think you're describing."

But you would have to move at the speed of light to make it stop entirely.        For instance, a photon does not experience time. When a photon leaves the sun, in our frame of reference it takes a few minutes to get here. But since the photon travels at the speed of light, the time dilation is infinite, this goes along with another relativistic effect which is length contraction at relativistic speeds. The length contraction is also infinite at the speed of light. So to us it takes the photon some time to reach us from the sun, but to the photon it is instantaneous. It crosses no distance and experiences no time."

Each cell also has a small reserve stock of these materials.  When you are ""fresh"" and you start exercising and you just do normal-for-you stuff your cells rely on their stockpiles and your system begins the fast transfer of materials and you are fine.  When you over-do it your cells start hungering for oxygen and have to start burning the sugar less efficently, and your cells start thinking ""maybe I need more of those pumps"" and then starts on that quest to build those expensive structures.  If an athlete stops exercising the cells spend a lot of time ""never low on resources"" and forcibly stopping those pumps or having to pump back out what was just pumped in.

AskScienceDiscussion,39yfcg,Overswagulation,6,Mon Jun 15 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"We know that very small particles don't really have positions. They have what's known as a ""wavefunction"", which gives them a probabilistic distribution of positions. You can imagine the distribution as a cloud like this; the density of dots is the chance that we will detect the particle at that point. For complicated technical reasons, we don't think that these distributions have a hard cutoff; that is, there's no boundary that you're 100% guaranteed to detect the particle within.  This effect gets much smaller for larger systems, but for similar technical reasons, we're pretty sure it never goes away completely. So the baseball has some small probability of being detected on the other side of the wall.  But I'm not sure that I would call this ""possible"" in the normal English sense of the word. I'm more confident that I won't ever see a ball pass through a wall than I am about most things commonly called ""impossible"". If I did see a ball pass through a wall, I would never conclude that it actually happened; I would conclude that I've had a false memory implanted, or that the wall was some kind of trick, or that the Flash broke and repaired the wall while I was blinking."

It will never happen within the universe's lifetime. Even if you take the lifetime to extend until entropy is so high that structures like walls and tennis balls can no longer exist.  What you were reading about was probably quantum tunneling. Like /u/Amarkov explained, this is the fact that the positions in which a particle can be found follow a probability distribution, and that probability distribution doesn't stop at walls. For a tennis ball to do this, though, would require that all the ball's particles tunnel through the wall in exactly the same way at the same time. Figuring out the probability of this happening would be complicated, to say the least, but it will definitely be such a small number that even accumulated over a universe's lifetime of balls flying at walls, it will be effectively zero."

If there is pressure acting upon matter (for example, atmospheric pressure inside a space station that has a leak), material gets expelled into the vacuum. But that's not because the vacuum is ""sucking"" it out, it's because the air inside is pushing it out and there's nothing pushing it it.

AskScienceDiscussion,39x7ag,Abdiel_Kavash,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a cool way of thinking of it, because it doesn't matter whether the water is gas or liquid, it provides the same pressure regardless."
AskScienceDiscussion,39x7ag,SwedishBoatlover,2,Mon Jun 15 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"Ignoring effects such as the curvature of the Earth or capillary forces, the pressure in a body of liquid will always balance out such that the surface of the liquid is always at the same height. See communicating vessels.  So the pressure would indeed be acting on the water in the tube, but it would only be enough to push the water up to sea level; no matter how deep you sink the tube into the ocean.  In another words, the ocean is exerting pressure on the water inside the tube; but the water in the tube is also exerting a pressure on the rest of the ocean. If the water level in the tube is higher than sea level, the water in the tube will actually fall down and push the rest of the ocean upwards."

AskScienceDiscussion,39x7ag,Stone356,2,Mon Jun 15 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"IF (huge if here) the water tower were ""high enough"", as in space elevator counterweight high you could make some water fly out into space. [NOTE: I am assuming we ""wished"" the tower full of water into existence all at once, or it was full of intersticial valves that all opened at once or some other way to create the tower of water.] Some of the water would fly out the top because the net force on it was away from the earth due to rotation. Most of it would rush out the bottom. There would be a ""really good"" vacuum between the two bodies. When enough rushed out the top a ""slug"" of water would likely be left over. That slug would then, if it remained coherent, go slamming down the tube with tremendous force. Not only would that weight of water basically be ""de-orbiting in a vacuum""  it would be being ""sucked down"" by the vacuum and it would be protected from the atmosphere.  The energy at the bottom impact would be ""significant"". Look up those videos on how to break the bottom out of a beer bottle by smacking your hand on the top.  But without the sudden wish or the pre-filled tower with all the valves...  The problem is that you cannot draw the water up into the tower no mater what.  ""Sucking"" on the top of the tower, plus gravity ""sucking"" the water downward would create an area of zero pressure in the tube at about 33 feet above the ambient water level. At that point the water would essentially boil because there is a graph of pressure, temperature and state (gas vs. liquid. vs solid) that says ""When the pressure gets low enough the water will boil instead of rise.  But it doesn't boil very fast at all. and if you stop sucking the air, now steam, out it just reaches a sort of vapor lock state because water is some freaky shit.  In practical terms this problem was first encountered in early mining operations when they tried to suck the water out of deep mines. They could only suck it up 33 feet because that's where the water was ""heavy enough"" in the pipes to counteract the air pressure.  Thus was invented the first barometer.  In barometers mercury eventually replaced water since it's heavier and so what was ""Feet of water"" became ""inches of mercury"" to the same effect but without all the hassle of having a thirty-some foot tower of glass and the need to climb the tower to read the numbers.  So anyway, you can pump water higher than 33 feet if you pump it from the bottom up, but you can't suck it higher than 33 feet if you suck it from an open tank/source.  So if you look at a water tower, or a sky scraper, you'll find the water pumps at the bottom pumping up.   Fluid dynamics are ""sort of hard"" and at the pressures involved in having a multi-mile-high stack of fluid they get to be ""irrationally hard""."

AskScienceDiscussion,39vqak,a2soup,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"I believe that language isn't such a big deal. I think we are only a bit more cognitively apt than our closest  relative, the chimp, enough to enable us to be sensitive enough to sound to allow us to organize it with our vocal chords and mouth to produce and, most importantly, control distinct sounds, and attribute them to objects, actions, and feelings (speech). And that we are intelligent enough to be able to have created visual symbols for these sounds (writing), which enables us to record and understand our history. Recording is particularly advantageous to a species because it has allowed us to continue where others in the past have left off - like concepts such as mathematics - which really are truly developed by the few more intelligent of us, the rest simply learn it and put it into practice. One may argue about Art - the ability to create a musical piece is simply an extension of this sensibility to organized sound. Similar to math, the more sensitive ones are those who can create what we consider masterpieces. But, in both examples, maths and music, it usually takes a pioneer decades of practice to master anyway, to then create something that goes beyond what society has done before. Consider another example, fashion - one may consider it artistic expression (although I see it more often used as a means for us to feel individual, or, ""special"" - to either want to look distinct or, the more practical one, to label economic classes - both are to me ""stroking of the ego"", which is pretty animalistic), but fashion is simply a development of the basic need of protection. It doesn't take a GENIUS to figure out that layering our bodies with ""stuff"" serves to protect us. So, I don't think we are much smarter than chimps, only smart ENOUGH. Sex, food, money... we are naturally drawn to these because they supply us with dopamine and/or adrenaline."

The way he slaughtered the rabbit was to bludgeon it with a bike pump, then strangle it. The conversation was about humans having a higher sensibility than our ancestors. And all I could think of was chimps hunting; they usually will find a baby monkey and basically smash it against a tree until it is dead, then tear it apart to eat it. I was reminded of a Maya Angelou quote:       ""We are all human; therefore, nothing human can be alien to us.""

If someone reacting to this statement said that time is ""nonlinear"", what may have been meant was that there are a class of events whose time-ordering is not set in an absolute sense. For instance, if we observe two stars explode simultaneously, there are observers for whom one star (or the other) have exploded first. This is more than an illusion based on location. Of course if we are closer to one star than the other we will see them explode first, but I am assuming observers account for this.  This means, depending on your frame of reference (determined by speed relative to others as well as influences of gravity) some events may switch ordering if you switch frames. Certainly not every pair of events can do this- for instance no frame will find you reading this message before I've typed it.  Still, in a given frame, it's hard to understand what time being non-linear could mean, and wherever you heard this from may have a very different idea in mind."

Until then we would have no capability to make such a calculation (we still would be arguing on details important to the calculation if the CMB stopped appearing tomorrow).  Why then do we say it is infinite? Because symmetries are important to physics. One such symmetry is that the laws of the universe are the same no matter where you are (""translational invariance"").

AskScienceDiscussion,39rbtj,electrodork,5,Sun Jun 14 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"There does seem to be a few correlations with planets and the host star. For one, small stars tend to not have large planets (i.e. hot Jupiters around an M-dwarf are rare, if they exist at all). This makes sense, because they would have small proto-planetary disks so it would be difficult to form large planets. Another, is that stars of high metallicity (the percent of elements heavier than hydrogen) are more likely to have large gas planets within 5 AU. Here's a good article that's only a few years old that describes some of these properties.  The exact correlation between the metallicity of the host star and the metallicity of the planets is still up for debate. We haven't gotten good metallicity measurements of many exoplanets yet (measurements of the gas planets in our own Solar System are still debated), but that is a topic that many people are working on. How this plays out depends on the dominant form of planet formation and the specific properties of the proto-planetary disk.   The properties of the previous generation of stars definitely affects any future stars or planets that form. Newer stars will be more metal-rich, presumably leading to more large planet formation. A lot of it depends on luck and whether the nebula that the star forming out of is large or small or many other possible properties.  Hope that answered some of your question!"

(Did you properly use scientific control and reduce your variables to a minimum?)    These are all factors that scientists much think about when attempting to answer scientific questions. While this does not make a complete list, asnwering these questions will help tell you if your answer is scientifically viable"
AskScienceDiscussion,39q941,BitOBear,3,Sat Jun 13 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"You are asking the question backwards. The real idea is ""what makes a question un_answerable and so why doesn't science _like to ask them.""  That sounds like picking nits, but it's not.  First a question can be unanswerable because one or more of its components is known not to exist. ""Why do unicorns hunt virgins have a horn?"" (little joke there). One first has to invent the ""unicorn"" to answer the question, but in so doing the answer is only bound by intent of the inventor. One person might propose a unicorn that uses the horn to dig up root vegetables and another might indeed invent vampire unicorns that suck blood through the spiral veins in the ""horn"". The problem is that ""the unicorn"" doesn't have a real, and therefore constrained and agreed upon, value.  So a question can be unanswerable because a key element is undefined, e.g. ""a cypher"" instead of a discriminant.  Another reason a question can be unanswerable is because it presumes facts or relationships that don't exist. ""Why do dogs prefer to fly in overcast conditions?""   Another reason is false equivalence or false predicate. ""A pig and a canary are the same in terms of temperament so ... (some question here)""  A question can lack specificity, such as ""how high is 'up'?""  And many questions are unanswerable but model interesting ideas such as ""so let's say I have a proton going faster than the speed of light....""  And some questions simply make no difference to any outcome. ""So what if we add a few helium atoms to the reagent?""  And some quesiton are ""not even wrong"", so stuff like ""what if the universe were exactly the same and all motion stops at 0 kelvin but it turns out absolute zero is really -100 kelvin""? There was one guy on here asking about pressure and temprature in terms of the states of water but he just didn't get what equal means. So he was effectively asking ""so 5 plus 6 equals 11 but what if I make it 4 plus 6 equals 11 by making my 5 'really small' ?""  No he wasn't using those numbers, but the experiment he was proposing, and re-proposing, and re-wording, was an essential failure to understand what ""equals"" means in the graph he was trying to comprehend. In particular he didn't understand that ""heat"" and ""temperature"" are not interchangeable in the equations in question.    So there are lots of questions we can ask that we cannot answer, or simply cannot answer right now, but that still have value. Such as ""What would happen to my cat if he jumped into a black hole?"" We can answer these questions because we can identify the parts and agree on the definitions of those parts, and we can identify the absurdities (""jumps from where?"" ""how strong is the cat that it can deorbit itself?"" ""is the cat wearing a space suit?"" etc.)  So the first step in science is to attack the question itself. If the question doesn't have an ""unanswerable flaw"", then you start looking for a mechanism by which an answer can be found.  And at the far end there are just philosophical quagmires that attempt to hide their flaws. They've been crafted and re-crafted to hide their flaws.  ""Define 'universe'. be exhaustive and complete. Provide three examples."" (Answer is always wrong for being incomplete and having unmet conditions of proof.)  ""What if god just designed it that way?"" Answer is always wrong because some definitions of god include ""unknowability"" as ""god works in mysterious ways"" etc. Question presumes facts re ""designed by anything"". Answer has no value as there would be no set of things not designed by god.  ""How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"" No defintion for angel that contains a list of attributes including minimum size or ability to ""dance"".  ""Can god create a rock so big he cannot the lift it?"" Uh, lift it away from what larger object? Over what time scales? Does god know about leverage?    Finally, once you have determined that a question is not unanswerable, then and only then do you ask ""is science the correct means to quantify the answer""?  Science is not a thing, it's a method. It's an approach.  Some questions, particularly personal and subjective questions, are not good fits for the scientific method. ""How do I feel about Nancy?"" isn't a science question at all.  But again, the answerability has to be assessed first. Who, after all, the fark is this ""Nancy"" person? Is it even a person? Etc.  So the question of answerability is layered.  But it is dominated by identity, specificity, context, and so on.  Science tends to like answerable questions for which all askers, asking fairly, will arrive at the same answers given the same information.  So nothing subjective. Nothing based on cultural assumptions (like the definition of Baal). Nothing based on assumed or unavailable data. Nothing based on something that can only happen once. Nothing based on something that cannot be measured or detected.  So the real test is ""ask a scientist"" and if he tells you why the question at hand is unanswerable, believe him, or ask another scientist. If nine out of ten agree it's unanswerable for more-or-less the same reason, your job becomes one of altering or quantifying what they said was missing or broken."
AskScienceDiscussion,39q941,BitOBear,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:57:43 2015 UTC,What factors make sure that the answer we formulated is accurate?
AskScienceDiscussion,39q941,AnecdotallyExtant,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"That is literally the purpose of ""The Scientific Method"". Whole volumes have been written about the Scientific Method so this analysis will, by definition, be a little short... 8-)  The key advancement of the scientific method over previous means of inquiry is that it reversed the task of inquiry. Previously the investigators would look for ""ways this idea is right""; science invokes with primacy, the search for ""ways this idea might be wrong"".  That is, the best scientific hypotheses are accompanied not only by their forward predictions (""if I drop a 10lb weight, it will ""fall down"", because gravity), but by a list of things (circumstances, exercises) that would ""disprove"" the hypothesis (""if I lift a 10lb weight and then remove all support, and it just hangs there, gravity isn't consistent"").  In good science one not only attempts the experiments that would prove the proposition, one does ones best to attempt the experiments that would disprove proposition.  See ""science"" never ""proves"" anything. Ever. Science's goals are to ""test"" things in such a way that ideas are ""demonstrated correct or incorrect"" to within reasonable error.  So nothing is ever ""proved"" in science. Nothing is ever ""off the table"". Science is an endless death-match of ideas. Once your ideas step onto the sands of the arena of science the only way they leave is feet-first in a body bag.  So the first barrier which ensures good science is that the scientist doesn't want to get smacked down by his peers. Look up Ponds and Fishman of Cold Fusion fame for an example of that happening.  The second barrier is ""falsifyability"", which is the inclusion of a list of ways an idea can be proved wrong. A good idea has a list of ways it could have or could eventually be proved wrong. Someone has hopefully done most or all of those experiments and failed to prove the idea wrong.  The third is ""repeatability"". The tasks that demonstrate the idea valid must be something that can be done again and again with the same results (or close enough to the same results because of experimental error).  The forth is a matter of an idea providing ""useful predictions"". Often this is a shadow of the previous two. For instance Einstien and others made a series of predictions about what we ought to see happen ""if we could observer XXXX or YYYY"". So for example Relativity said that if we had really accurate clocks they would run at different speeds in different conditions. These predictions were made in the early part of the 1900's. But we didn't have accurate enough clocks that we could just move around until at least 1970. When the tests were done, the predictions were demonstrated correct.    So here is the thing. People of faith often get upset when they try to ""use science to prove god"" or UFOs or whatever it is they believe in. They get upset because ""the 'closed minded scientists' are just attacking me"".  That is, of course, exactly what the scientists are doing because that is what science is. Science is a brutal. Science will take the easiest cuts first and fastest because everyone involved is out to destroy that which is weak of thought or construct.  But it's nothing personal.  Scientists don't raid children's Easter parties crushing eggs and putting Peeps to the torch.  But if you come up to a scientist with any idea the first thing you are going to get is an attempted smack-down. It will likely be polite, well considered, gentile, and likely to make you cry if you really really really like your idea.  So the ""factors that make sure the answer we formulated is accurate"" are largely summarized as ""because it survived every attack that anybody could think of"".  And sure, eventually most ideas ""fail"" or are ""proved wrong"", but this failure and proof are usually of diminishing factors and razor-thin circumstantial differences.  For instance, Kepler's laws of Planetary Motion were golden, and now they are only ""good enough for most usage"" because Mercury's orbit confounds them. But then Relativity came along and with frame dragging and some sun/gravity/time keplers laws were extended to deal with small objects (mercury) very close to very large rotating objects (the sun).  So science is also in the business of knowing where it's existing ideas ""don't seem to work"" and/or cataloging exceptions and unanswered questions.  So the final grace of science is that no answers are final.  Science doesn't search for The Truth™. It's not in the business of saying This Is The Answer™. It's in the business of finding ""the best explanations so far"".  So with that last major piece of the puzzle we see that anything that comes along and tries to say ""this is the final proof of (whatever)"" is automatically suspect as probably unscientific simply for not recognizing any of the limits inherent in human understanding.  TL;DR :: science is the art and science of ""being mean to ideas"" to the point of destruction. We know the ideas that survive this are ""more correct"" than those that did not. This is different than the past, were we only required that ideas seemed to explain what was observed, a technique that produced a lot of fanciful but fragile nonsense."

So if your hypothesis is that the sky is blue (called the alternative hypothesis), the null hypothesis would be that the sky is not blue. We can look at the sky and study spectra, etc. and we can decide to reject the null hypothesis. If we did the same test and found that the sky is red, then we fail to reject the null. But theoretically we don't accept the alternative hypothesis. As long as the null is thorough and leaves no room for confusing the alternative hypothesis, we don't need to accept the alternative, it is good enough to reject the null.        If your alternative hypothesis is that Santa exists, then the null would be that Santa does not exist. We cannot reliably test the null in that case, so it is not an answerable question to science."

That means that to test a hypothesis, we need something to prove wrong.   This isn't what ""inductive"" means. Inductive means that the reasoning proceeds from observed evidence rather than by deduction from premises.  In general, you put far too much emphasis on the null hypothesis, which is really a statistics thing. Scientific questions that are more general than ""Is this data statistically significant?"" are answered in whatever way works and is rigorous. Usually (but not always) scientists come up with reasonable-seeming hypotheses and decide which of them is most reasonable and most consistent with the available evidence. Further work seeks to test the predictions of the hypothesis under consideration. A successful prediction is evidence for a hypothesis just as a failed prediction is evidence against it, at least in practice.   Basically, it's not all about rejection. Experiments are, at least in my experience, usually more intended to provide evidence for a hypothesis than to falsify potential alternative hypotheses, although good work will do both and control groups can be seen as ruling out the simplest null hypotheses (e.g. ""there is no effect"" or ""the effect is caused by the solvent"")."

AskScienceDiscussion,39ovhj,SandyRegolith,27,Sat Jun 13 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"It looks like there has been some research showing that transgender people have a brain morphology that most closely resembles that of the gender they feel they belong to.        According to this article:      http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956(10)00158-5/abstract            Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated FtM transsexuals is closer to the pattern of subjects who share their gender identity (males) than those who share their biological sex (females). Our results provide evidence for an inherent difference in the brain structure of FtM transsexuals.         So female to male transgender men share a pattern with men.        In this second work published by the same group, it was shown that male to female transgender women have a morphology that is somewhere between male and female.      http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956(10)00325-0/abstract       Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated MtF transsexuals falls halfway between the pattern of male and female controls. The nature of these differences suggests that some fasciculi do not complete the masculinization process in MtF transsexuals during brain development.      So yes, it looks like the brain morphology of transgender men and women more closely resembles the gender they identify with, and not the sex they were born with.         (Edit: Here's an article from New Scientist that discusses the broader context of these works and others.

Just excerpting from the abstracts of those papers:      1:     On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions        2:         Global cerebral blood flow is higher in women than in men. Sex-specific differences in dopaminergic, serotonergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic markers indicate that male and female brains are neurochemically distinct.        3:      There was a significant main effect of sex on brain morphology, even after accounting for the larger global volumes of grey and white matter in males. Females had increased grey matter volume adjacent to the depths of both central sulci and the left superior temporal sulcus, in right Heschl's gyrus and PT, in right inferior frontal and frontomarginal gyri and in the cingulate gyrus. Females had significantly increased grey matter concentration extensively and relatively symmetrically in the cortical mantle, parahippocampal gyri, and in the banks of the cingulate and calcarine sulci. Males had increased grey matter volume bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobes, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and in the anterior lobes of the cerebellum, but no regions of increased grey matter concentration.        Taken together those papers show sex differences in brain volume, morphology, functional anatomy, developmental biology, neurochemistry and psychopathology.       How could you conclude that there are no differences?"

As a comparison, there are significant differences between the brains of adults and children, but I imagine they could only probably say the brain came from someone between ten and twenty years old, not precisely seventeen years old. If I gave that scientist a brain and they conclude with 99% confidence that it came from a woman, and then I reveal that it was Caitlyn Jenner's brain ... were they right or wrong?"

Most of the data in all of those papers are worked out to 95% confidence. Those that are not are worked out to 99% confidence.

I suspect that if we wanted to send a self-replicating system to, say, the moon it would comprise several distinct systems, including a 3D printer, and all the systems collectively would have all the technology to make and assemble the each of the modules. So if there are N modules, it would take N build events of all the system to make the second system, and so on.

I would imagine something more like an autonomous factory would be today's version of a self copying 3D printer. There would be stations for the various parts which all require different manufacturing techniques. Robots would ferry the parts about and eventually you'd get a copy of the factory next door at the cost of electricity and raw materials.   Once you start to try to miniaturize the process though the question of how raw the materials you put in comes into play. There are things that a 3D printer needs that can not be made from rolls of PLA plastic. Is your 3D printer going to have a foundry to extract and produce its own copper for the circuits it needs?

If you're interesting in another article, I always liked David Hofstadter's take on sexism in language. https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html There's also a short essay about it prefacing his book GEB which really opened my eyes to the topic.

If the orbit of the moon (what your earth like body would be) intersects with such, I got pretty bad news for (complex) life on this moon.  Other issues could be: gravitational locking, not enough sun light in the shadow of the gas giant to support life on the surface/keep the temperature up (Although this might be compensated by thermal raditation from the gas giant or nuclear heating of the moon). Another factor would be, if the moon got it's own magnetic field (iron core) and the gas giant got one, it might slow down the rotation of the moon('s core) rapidly, which basically had the same effect as gravitional locking. However, it is not said that life couln'd develop on such a locked body, might just be more difficult because there is constant light on parts of the planet for half its orbit and none on the other one.  If you take a look at europa, which is not earth like but one of the places in the solar system more likely to have developed life out side of earth.  TL;DR: Probably could, but with increased difficulty. Might work better if the moon hasn't got an magnetic field of his own and is protected by the gas giant. Other factors apply as always."

The problem with massive cells is pretty simple: they have no surface area in comparison to volume. Nutrients need to come in, and wastes need to go out. If a cell's diameter (we'll assume it's spherical) were boosted by a factor of ten, then it has 100 times the surface area to intake nutrients and expel waste. However, it also has 1000 times the volume, and uses nutrients at 1000 times the rate (well, not quite - there's actually a curve relating an animal's mass and energy usage, and it's roughly related as energy = mass3/4 or so, but a linear relationship is okay for sake of an example).  The first cell, the algae, is about as big as a spherical cell could get (I assume) while the second cell is shaped a bit like a radiator - lots of surface area compared to its total volume. That's fine in the buoyant saltwater oceans of earth, but something planet-sized? That would need a massive support structure, and even then there's a chance gravity would destroy it.

(IPCC)  2030:      Diarrhea-related diseases will likely increase by up to 5 percent in low-income parts of the world. (IPCC)  Up to 18 percent of the world’s coral reefs will likely be lost as a result of climate change and other environmental stresses. In Asian coastal waters, the coral loss could reach 30 percent. (IPCC)      Warming temperatures will cause temperate glaciers on equatorial mountains in Africa to disappear. (Richard Taylor, University College London, Geophysical Research Letters:)      The Arctic Sea could be ice-free in the summer. (James Overland, NOAA, Muyin Wang, University of Washington, Geophysical Research Letters)      2050:     Small alpine glaciers will very likely disappear completely, and large glaciers will shrink by 30 to 70 percent. Austrian scientist Roland Psenner of the University of Innsbruck says this is a conservative estimate, and the small alpine glaciers could be gone as soon as 2037. (IPCC)  Ocean acidification could kill off most coral reefs.

AskScienceDiscussion,39lb8e,MartinBlank73,4,Fri Jun 12 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"No.  The normal technique for landing a light aircraft (jets are slightly different, we'll get to that soon) is to fly the aircraft level, just above the runway, until it stalls. But even then, the stall speed is still high enough that it needs a fair amount of runway to stop.  Jets don't usually stall before landing, because they are much less draggy, so it would take too long to slow down. Additionally, because the range of speeds they fly at is much higher, the normal approach speed already has the nose high enough up to be safe. But theoretically, with a long enough runway, you could land a jet by stalling it - and if you did that, just like a light aircraft, it would still take lots of runway to slow down.  So now you're looking at ways of reducing the stall speed.  We'll assume that all the normal devices fitted to the aircraft to reduce stall speed for landing (flaps and slats) are already being used. What else can we do to reduce stall speed? The answer is we could increase the G force. The higher the G force, the lower the stall speed. We could increase the G just before landing by pulling back hard on the controls..... but that's going to make the aircraft go up, away from the runway we're trying to land on. I think this is what you're getting at with the cliff - pulling G to get over the cliff. But if we did that whilst still climbing, it would result in a very heavy landing. And if we stopped climbing before the stall and landing, then we'd be back to a normal landing speed again.  And now I'm out of ideas, hence the fact that I don't believe this would be possible."
AskScienceDiscussion,39lb8e,LondonPilot,3,Fri Jun 12 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"It could absolutely be done in the way he suggested, you're just extremely unlikely to pull it off.  Go up at 85* till you run out of momentum, ideally just above where you want to land, straightening out just as you are losing control, done.  Obviously with a lot of luck. I bet I could pull it off in flight simulator with enough time, or in reality if I was immortal and willing to trash a few aircraft trying."
AskScienceDiscussion,39lb8e,Terrh,3,Sat Jun 13 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"The real technique would be extra tricky but the edge of the mountain would likely do the stalling for you.  Fly in low, start climing the mountain, as you increase your nose-up attitude you approach the condition known as ""hanging on the prop"" but the down-draft on the cliff (presuming that there is one) is still keeping your wings in flight. When you reach the lip you probably encounter wind shear as the air there is moving across the mesa at the top. In that shear your wings stop flying and now you are purely haing on your prop.  Hopefully you've either timed it perfectly so that your elevators are still flying, or your prop wash is strong enough to let them keep working, so you nose over.  Gravity cancels your old ""forward"" momentum, where forward was pointing up. The prop is now giving you some ""forward"" momentum pointing along the tarmac. As soon as you've nosed over while you are still slightly balistic, you cut the throttle and just sort of belly-flop.  This is completely survivable as a passenger or cargo. The struts for the wheels will probably buckle unless you did it prefectly as they are not designed to take the ""drop weight force"" of the plane from more than a couple feet.  So you could probably do this, but the plane probably wouldn't be airworthy afterwards unless you were a really, exceptionally good stunt pilot in a particularly buff stunt plane."

AskScienceDiscussion,39lb8e,dsws2,3,Sun Jun 14 11:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. As long as you do the wind-speed thing and the over-ground velocity thing (e.g. get those all in nice safe numbers that won't wreck plane, passengers, or cargo) you can safely land a plane anywhere.  When I was learning to fly (only got as far as soloing at about 16, had to stop for money reasons, plus it turns out prop noise puts me to sleep) back in the eighties my father, who did fly, liked to take me though the various notices to airmen and such.  At and airport in Imperial Valley, CA (Gillespie field maybe?) pilots had taken to landing perpendicular to the runway. The wind came from 90-degrees to the center-line on many days because of the mountains and the Santa Anna Winds. The runways were extra wide for use as backup sites for some real millitary pigs (giant military aircraft) and emergency landings for the long-run-out planes of the day.  The FAA had to stop this practice with stern warnings and whatnot.  The Tech: planes fly in relative air speed, so it doesn't matter what speed you are going over the ground. On a windy day you could end up with a 90 knot crosswind. A plane with a 100 knot minim flight speed would only be going 10 knots ground speed when making that landing. Plenty slow enough to stop by the time you got to the other side of the asphalt."

If the partial pressure of CO2 in the lungs is too high, they get to the lungs and then leave still carrying CO2.  Even though there's still lots of oxygen in the air in the lungs, the tissues don't get any.  This page lists the lethal concentration of CO2 as 90,000 ppm (9%) for five minutes of exposure.  Unless the room were more like a closet, it would take longer than that to use up half the O2, bringing the percentage down from ~20% to >10% as the CO2 rises from ~.4% to a lethal level.

AskScienceDiscussion,39jz73,Felicia_Svilling,3,Fri Jun 12 09:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's it, and I would add that this scenario - an object that starts at rest and constantly accelerates forever - is often referred to as as the ""relativistic rocket"". If you search the web for that term you'll find lots of information on it. I'm sure there is a site with plots of how the speed approaches the speed of light as time goes on."
AskScienceDiscussion,39jz73,diazona,2,Fri Jun 12 09:41:33 2015 UTC,"Normally a rocket design will have a maximum speed controlled by how much fuel you have and the speed of your exhaust.  If you have infinite fuel that doesn't weigh anything then you can ignore the rocket equation and accelerate.  With relativity then you still feel and see yourself accelerating indefinitely but this is a bit of a lie. At 99.5% the speed of light one second for you will be ten seconds back on Earth, and one meter traveled for you will be ten meters for someone with a really long measuring tape. Everything feels normal to you - you don't notice that distances are squished or that time is barely moving unless you look out a window and wonder why the rest of the universe seems to be in fast-forward and kind of distorted.  The changes to meters and seconds will become worse and worse as your relative speed increases, so when we try to measure your acceleration in m/s2 you'll think your engines have the same performance as they've always had but an observer stationary relative to Earth will see you doing less and less and less accelerating even though the crew might be feeling a constant 10 m/s2.  This puts a soft cap on your speed because time dilation and length contraction would become infinite at the speed of light. Massless objects can accelerate in an instant and can reach the speed of light, but massless objects can't and can only ever get very close to it."

The wave-form is described by the instant wave-function. How instant they really are, would be interesting, but is outside this discussion.     If the wave-form reaches a sensor or anything else, the wave-form collapses. The particle is no longer in a super-position state.      So in that sense, there is no time travel. Just instant connections of wave-forms. The wave-form can change while the particle is traveling. So from the perspective of the particle, it may seem as if there is a future affecting the past. Or even that reality may not exist. From the perspective of the wave-forms however, there is just the change of one wave-function to another.  So I see the wave-form as described by the quantum-wave-function as an actual state of matter. The observed particles are results of this function.   The function describes probabilities, because the amount of information and uncertainty is constant. Maybe this also means that the wave-forms are somehow conserved, since a particle that is detected causes a change in the waveform of a particle (electron) in the sensor."

So using a conservative estimate of the lifespan benefit of a single minute of exercise (for simplicity's sake I will use a factor of 5.5 minutes of lifespan gained for each minute of exercise), to offset a single cigarette, in terms of average effect on lifespan, you would need to walk about one minute to your smoking spot and about one minute back."

If you say that one organism must be able to survive on its own, then a parasite is not an organism. If you say an organism must be able to reproduce, one person is not an organism unless they are a really really good scientist ;)  If you allow for an organism to be a bunch of molecules that works as a unit, has a metabolism and grows that doesn't have to be able to survive or reproduce without other organisms, then sure, a wasp is an organism.  If you say that a wasp is no organism because in needs other wasps to survive and reproduce, well, now parasites and mammals aren't organisms either.

AskScienceDiscussion,39k9ru,Rzztmass,2,Fri Jun 12 11:28:18 2015 UTC,"An interesting distinction is that in most animals, all individuals can potentially reproduce. Therefore, natural selection works on each individual - if there's a beneficial assortment of genes, or a novel mutation, that individual's genes will increase in the population over time.   In the social insects case, some castes are non-reproductive, so their genetic variation is essentially irrelevant to the future development of the species."

I think it's reasonable to think of a eusocial colony as a single organism, and the individuals as essentially cells, the various castes being the organs.         The comparison to parasites is not apt, a parasite increases its fitness at the expense of the host's fitness. A worker bee does not decrease the fitness of the hive, it increases it, and it is incapable of increasing its own fitness.       To the extent that an organism is typically defined as being, among other things,  capable of reproduction, we cannot call a worker bee an organism in itself. It is also a false analogy to say that a single human is not capable of reproduction in the same way that eusocial castes are incapable of reproduction. By that reasoning, only organisms that reproduce by parthenogenesis would be capable of reproduction. I think we can agree that this would be a fairly limited view of reproductive capability.

What I'm hearing is that although the universe was much younger at the time, it still had the 'infinite' property at 380k years old, since the inflationary epoch was long past? So although an alien and me would observe the same kind of radiation (it would look similar in terms of heat/distribution/age) it's not like a picture of the universe before space got its properties, just a picture of what the universe looked like before our observable atoms had time to cluster together?  In other words, we're mapping what we will eventually be able to tell isn't background anymore.  I think the main problem in my brain was linking up going back in time with looking farther out from the earth, and overestimating how much smaller the universe was at 380k years old. I guess it had more than enough time to inflate from a 10 cm to infinity in the 380k years 'behind' the radiation. This was all a problem with my sense of scale, for sure.

Most of the inflation probably happened between 0 and 10cm. This is loosely supported by how uniform the CMB is - the tiny variations look like stretched-out quantum variations in temperature, like it was very very small and almost immediately became much bigger. It then expanded at a more reasonable pace for 380k years and has continued to expand ever since.  But did those inflationary conditions ever stop, or did they just move on? Eternal inflation is an idea where being unimaginably hot and expanding unimaginably quickly are the universe's normal states, and only part of it slowed down like a bubble forming in a boiling pot of water. This slowed region with its normal physics would never, ever catch up to the parts with weird physics that are still expanding at FTL speeds.  Our observable universe sits somewhere within one such bubble of normal space. There may be many other bubbles with completely different tracts of universe and perhaps different laws of physics (or at least different vacuum energies), and new ones may be forming within the inflation all the time.

First of all, nothing is sure to get you a job anywhere; second, it depends on what kind of physics; and you might actually be better off studying engineering, though there are advantages to either route. Basically, aerospace companies want technically-minded people, and studying physics (or astronomy) is good training for that, but there are very few jobs that actually count as working in physics.   Does it spends his days just reporting on the position of every star and celestial body like a glorified guard?   I don't know why you're saying ""glorified guard"". Having accurate information about the positions of many celestial bodies is important astronomical research. It's also very difficult. These days, astronomers don't sit at a telescope writing down coordinates or snapping pictures; instead, they design the observing equipment and computer algorithms, and then the computers mostly take care of the actual observing.  Here's what I would suggest: you're basically comparing two paths, astronomical research and aerospace engineering. Start by taking the introductory (college) classes for both, if you can. But in order to understand what would be involved in each career, you'll have to go beyond the classes. Ask your astronomy/physics professors about what they do for research. For engineering, see if your professors can put you in touch with contacts at major engineering firms so you can ask them about their work. That will at least give you a basic idea of what would be involved in each career. If you can get some experience doing astronomical research, maybe over the summer, do it. Then at some point you'll have to choose which track to focus on. If you like astronomy research, major in astrophysics and you can keep aerospace engineering as a minor. If you like the engineering better, major in that, and you can keep physics or astronomy as a minor. Bear in mind that it's probably going to be easier to switch from astronomy to engineering later in life than the other way around."

This video gives examples of how it looks in the UV spectrum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BqrSAHbTc  However, sunscreen is not perfect at absorbing UV.  Some of it is transmitted into your skin cells anyway.  So staying inside gives you less of a radiation dose than going out in the sun with sunscreen on, but wearing sunscreen in the sun gives you less of a radiation dose than not wearing sunscreen in the sun.

The more UV you are exposed to, the greater your chances of getting cancer. But regardless of UV exposure, skin cancer is a probabilistic event. More UV exposure increases the probability that you will get cancer. Using sunscreen lowers your UV exposure, but does not eliminate it entirely.

AskScienceDiscussion,39gkbu,FreeBribes,6,Thu Jun 11 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. Farting is sufficiently beneficial that mammals have developed a special muscle to let it happen.  The gas you fart isn't a product of your own body, its a product of your intestinal flora and fauna, your ""microbiome"".  If we didn't fart we'd either have to absorb and otherwise process that gas, or we'd have to expel our waste on demand like birds (so imagine if you actually shat yourself every time you farted), or we'd have to do without and actively fight off the microbiome elements that produce the gas. The latter would greatly limit our diet.  Both as predator and prey, the inability to control the bowel would be a great penalty. For birds it doesn't matter as much, which is probably why they don't have the equipment to fart or burp.  So the ability to directly vent the waste gasses makes us superior hosts for helpful microbiota. As such we can manufacture (by proxy) many vitamins and nutrients we would otherwise have to acquire.  Note also that the faster and variable speed digestive tract prevents the fatal condition suffered by ruminants called ""bloat"". Cows can fart but their intestine are not as good at ""going into overdrive when necessary"" so if they get too much particular kinds of food they can actually kill themselves with gas. Farmers use big needles to vent their gut if this starts to happen.  So it's not just a fart per-se, it's the last stage in a complex adaptation that makes us the pinnacle omnivore.

They found that heavy users performed worse then the control group for the first few days of the test. After 28 days of Marijuana abstinence, there was no significant difference in the performance of Marijuana users and non-users.  This might suggest that there may not be long term effects of Marijuana on intellectual capacity, as any such effect is overcome by around a month of abstinence.

There is a growing body of literature that is showing a lot of trouble for adolescent marijuana and alcohol users.        This study concluded that:       Aberrations in hippocampal asymmetry and left hippocampal volumes were found for adolescent heavy drinkers. Further, the functional relationship between hippocampal asymmetry and verbal learning was abnormal among adolescent substance users compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest differential effects of alcohol and combined marijuana and alcohol use on hippocampal morphometry and the relationship between hippocampal asymmetry and verbal learning performance among adolescents.         Here's another that found:       There are three primary findings related to age of first use of marijuana.

AskScienceDiscussion,39dghu,SoyElGoddamnBatman,3,Thu Jun 11 00:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of what you mean with this question.  What things are we talking about, and when does something become ""a part"" of something else?  Are we talking about producing a wooden chair at the forest? Because that just requires putting all the various mills/factories/etc, in/near the forest where you get your wood. For something simple like a chair, you could put the factory near the city where you sell the product, and we do this anyway: most cities have an industrial ""district"" where factories assemble parts into products, and often where the parts are made in the first place from resources brought in from wherever they are harvested.  In general, though, it's usually resource distribution, transportation costs and workforce availability that determines where things are built, as well as demand for products and supply of resources/materials.  It would be certainly easier to mine all the ore in one place, refine it on-site, shape it into what you need, pump oil from the well next door, refine that into the plastics you need, shape it on site in the same factory, gather the right sand from the beach next door to make the high-quality glass you need at the factory that's already there and then ship out a fully built iphone to be distributed to the city that is also next door, all while having all the skilled workers available to you living nearby.  Problem is, you'll never get the right glass sand near deposits of all the ores you'll need next to a reliable oil deposit. These resources also often need lots of room, so although your refineries can be relatively close, it's not worth building a refinery for ONE oil well or ONE mine. It becomes even worse when you factor in that you need several different factories (or one absolutely colossal one) to manufacture all the different materials into all the different components to make one electronic device from these mines, wells and glass. And the you need to have skilled workers who can not only work the factories, but also manage all these people. So you need homes and education centres to teach these people. But some of these people don't necessarily want to make iphones, maybe they want to make telescopes at that OTHER factory which ALSO uses similar resources to what your factories are already making.  See where I'm going with this? It's rare to impossible to have the raw resources, the manpower and the factory concentration requires to manufacture both the materials, the components and the final product all next to where they are consumed (usually cities/suburbs) for all the products society consumes.  The closest you could ever get is to use teleportation and rapid-retool robotic factories/replicators to either eliminate the resource transfer delay (essentially turning all factories into one factory without literally making one factory) or eliminate the entire production process... but that's technology that would allow us to manufacture on site from start to finish, not a result of manufacturing on site which is what you seem to be asking.  As to implications of being able to manufacture parts and products on-site on it's own... it would drop prices of products and it would probably kill the long-haul freight industries, maybe? I doubt technology in general would be directly impacted, just our industries and our way of life."

So when people talk about ""finding minerals"" they usually mean ""finding minerals in big enough chunks to recognize"".  For example Aluminium is the most abundant stuff in the earth's crust after Oxygen and Silicon. It is found in, and was probably a significant fraction of, every handful of dirt you have ever encountered. But we don't just mine random dirt for Aluminum because all the other minerals in that dirt have tainted the sample. Instead we go to particularly aluminium rich dirt, dirt that's worth scooping up, and ""mine"" that.  So it's a matter of scale. Whether you are a ""rock hound"" collector, or someone with a commercial interest, the size and shape of minerals ""on the surface"" is in the form of multitudes of microscopic bits. Bits that are both boring and inconvenient to look at and use.  So we look for concentrations.  The dirt and rock above has protected the minerals below from the universal solvent that is water.

Gregor Mendel who discovered the genetic basis of inheritance was a monk, who also just had free time to play around in the garden.       Today, the easiest way I can think of for an amateur to contribute would be to study up on entomology and learn to classify insects. There are more insect species that have not been described by science than there are insects that have been described. There was a man in Southern California named PH Timberlake who over the course a few decades in the 20th century described around 800 species of bees, many of which are named after him.

AskScienceDiscussion,39aewm,Berga95,11,Wed Jun 10 12:13:23 2015 UTC,"Operating systems do manage infinite storage, they aren't just equipped with any.  So if the storage is usefully unbounded in size, then most things would be found by relative offsets of other things.  Integer representation of arbitrary size is super simple, you just keep adding bits when you need them.  An infinite storage array doesn't need a real ""file system"" or ""defragmentation"" as, in infinite space, you can always find a place to store the file without fragmentation.  If the storage is of infinite size, then, by definition, access time for all spaces must be infinitely fast or all wait times would approach infinitely long. So since the infinite storage is infinitely fast there is no reason to ""manage it"". That is, if the time to retrieve any piece of information is ""finite"" then it must also be ""fixed"" because finite translation time for infinite distance is either fixed or not actually finite.  So go with simple, continuous append operations. A true 100% journaled file system. Never delete or free anything (so perfect version control) and phrase everything as retrospective.  Now having infinite disk -- e.g. ""slow"" -- storage tells us we have essentially infinite fast storage.  Periodically you'd maybe want to write a ""cheat-sheet file"", containing say the entire directory tree and the start positions of every file.  You'd never ""write over"" anything, you'd just rewrite the file in a new location and keep a pointer to version this-minus-one.  That sort of thing.  But block management is useless. Defragmentation is useless. Address size is ""relative"" and ""enough bits to get the job done"" which is manageable and known at the moment any record is written.  So imagine your infinite disk as a series of finite disks in order (disk1, disk2, disk3...) and periodically if disk 1 is about to go over the ""usefulness horizion"" for being 10128^ bits away, you might consult your directory map and ask ""does it still have any latest-version files on it? if so, let's just copy them up here to disk(current) and tweak the directory. But then again, why bother, add another 128 bits to the index as needed. (Treat the highest bit as a flag that says there's another word of bits in the number.)  In essence, once you invoke the word ""infinite"" then the practical concerns disappear. Our monkey brains don't like it and we keep saying ""but what about"" but dude, it's infinite, so you can't waste it..."

So, for example, providing a URL and a Range or Accept-Ranges header one can retrieve fixed data from an unbounded potential pool at an small, finite cost in time.  This infinite storage paradigm is the basis of Google Drive.  At the theoretical level near, far, slow, and fast storage are meaningless as discriminant. There is storage you must wait for and there is storage you don't wait for. You have a tiny amount of the latter and various forms of the former. and that's about it."

AskScienceDiscussion,39a15j,Rzztmass,2,Thu Jun 11 07:58:45 2015 UTC,"I do take apparent use of inflated vocabulary, particularly when not disambiguated in context, personally.    Yes, you obviously dislike inflated vocabulary, I can see that.   Just for you though, I did some research into the frequency of the word pulses used to describe food. I used 2008 frequencies from Google Ngram. I first took -ing -ed and -s frequencies for the verbs throb, vibrate, tremble and pulse. The first three had on average a ratio of 9,4 -ing/-s and 4,2 -ed/-s. Pulse had ratios of 0,20 and 0,39 respectively. That means that the form pulses i overrepresented in written English. Taking the ratios from the other verbs, I calculated that the frequency of the word pulses as used as something other than a verb is about 0,00048% in contemporary English. I subtracted the frequency of the phrase ""pulses of"" at 0,00004% and other less common combinations which might indicate that one writes about pulses of light or pulses of a food processor. It is safe to assume that pulses in the sense of the dictionary definition linked earlier makes up at least 0,0003% of written English. Add to that the singular form which can be calculated using similar methods to be about half that of the plural, 0,00045% of written English are either the word pulse or pulses with the meaning we are discussing. For comparison, the word vegetable makes up 0,00088%, not even double that.  If you believe that someone should be attacked for using a correct word on the AskScienceDiscussion subreddit, just because you personally have not encountered a word somewhat less common than vegetable, then you obviously do not belong here.  And why would we discuss my google-fu? That seems unneccessary.  Anyway, as this discussion is no longer useful, have a nice day."

AskScienceDiscussion,396465,BitOBear,2,Tue Jun 9 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well Chimera are not the same thing as you propose. In a Chimera both organisms grow intertwined but individual. The growth signals prevent duplication (so like no case of two hearts) when it works. So for instance I were a Chimera, my skin would be intermingled but likely all my blood would be from one contributor and my liver might be from the other. I could have one kidney from each, but it's unlikely that any one kidney would have both genes. Basically each bud for each organ would from from a cluster of cells from one participating organism or the other. Skin is ""blended"" because it buds from many locations on the zygote. So I might have one black eye and one blue eye if I and my brother were of different eye colors.  Things even get stranger as I could have merged with a twin sister and ended up with both sets of reproductive organs. Hormones would likely stunt one, the other, or both sets. But a cross gender chimera is perfectly valid.  The important thing to take away is that Chimera do not share their genome. It's a case of two genetically unique individuals interpenetrating each other and growing up into a single individual.  But if you actually combined the genomes, which would mean getting the chromosomes of both into the same nucleus, then things might get interesting. Chances are the creature would die, but that's not a certainty.  For example, you yourself are a combined genome creature. Half your chromosomes come from each parent and the two genomes express themselves simultaneously. This is particularly true if you are female (have two X chromosomes) as then you are a true split.   So combining a rainbow trout with another ray-fin woudl be a coerced selective breeding. It wouldn't take a lot of super science, but it may not work very well at all. The normal cross breeding issues would obtain.  Cross breeding a shark and a trout, however, would take some super science (manually moving chromosome bodies) and I'd bet the result would be non-viable.  The non-viable status not because of the genome contents being duplicated, but because of simple problems like the bone-vs-cartilage question.  The wider the species gap the less likely the genome cross would work. And that's a good thing as we don't need Fly People..."

We are currently in the midsts of one of the biggest ones in the history of the planet. At the same time, we are very prolific as a species. Which leads to #2… The fossil record. We have had a historical trend to bury our dead. Be it a cemetery, or mass grave, there are lots of human bones that will fossilize and are distributed all over the planet. EDIT: On top of all the animal death, a good future researcher might be able to parse out the fact that we, with all our mass of skeletons, were responsible for #1. If nothing else, we will become a good trace fossil. We're really good at extracting metals. This will undoubtedly leave a geochemical trace in the rock record, not to mention all the precious metals that don't easily assimilate (oxidize) into rocks. That brings us to #4… Nukes. We got 'em. We've used 'em. They generated an interesting array of isotopes that we even use today as geochemical boundary markers. Plastics. Honestly, I don't know how exactly these might manifest over time. Some might get preserved in-whole in the soft shallow muds of the ocean. Some might get buried deep enough to generate some type of ooze. Somebody else will have to weigh in on this. Helium… or rather the lack thereof. The generation of helium on earth is one that occurs very slowly over time in coals and shales. Some future being will come to the conclusion that there should be a lot more of it, along with… Coal and oil. Where did that all go? (Buuurp!) Space. Future space explorers from Earth (should that happen again) are going to eventually discover Apollo landing sites and Mars junk. Monocrops. They're still plants that produce pollen grains. There will be a lot more corn, soy, and cotton pollen getting distributed in lacustrine successions. I'm just going to randomly end it here with gaseous geochemical changes. Despite how congress votes, we're pumping shitloads of CO2 into the atmosphere. That CO2 creeps its way into everything water and will make a huge impact on the isotope geochemistry of carbon and oxygen in the rock record.   Did I forget something? I'm sure I have.  EDIT: If anything, future researchers will discover that humans (on top of being very crafty/smart) were voracious assholes. I mean, it's not like dinosaurs consumed all the resources until they discovered they were hosed. The curious thing is that we know that this is coming. We can see the trends in the numbers. It's only a matter of time and yet we find ourselves politically powerless to do anything about it.

Could it, perhaps, dissolve and change chemically somehow and deposit itself in sediment or somewhere deep underground over the years, turning into some sort of homogenous substance? I've had this idea for years now, where a future society comes across this substance much like we come across oil, and in much the same way it is a finite resource produced a long time ago by previous life, in this case by humans.  I suppose we'd need someone with an understanding of chemistry to say what would happen to all this plastic. I know we have the microplastics absolutely everywhere, so it would stand to reason that if this stuff stopped being created and dumped into the environment it would go somewhere, and if not just stay where it is I figure it might coalesce.

The only place near a black hole in which all paths leads to the singularity is within the event horizon. This means that if your mirror is outside the Schwarzschild radius, light isn't guaranteed to return towards the black hole.   So you then put your mirror within the event horizon, but there you hit a roadblock.

(2) At those gravitates the ""reflective surface"" isn't possible because of spegettification.  B the time you get to this whole arrangement the bonds that make molecules possible are largely irrelevant and the electrons are getting torn off their protons.  Photons don't ""bounce off a mirror"" in the rubber-ball sense. They are absorbed and re-emitted. Even if that's not the case and the photon is reflected intact, it is reflected by the ""difference in the media"" in the layers of the reflective surface. The problem here is that ""surface"" and ""media"" are both ill-defined inside the event horizon. So discarding the reflective surface doesn't work.  There is no condition where we expect a photon to come straight out in alignment with gravity.  But even if there is such an alignment and photon, it's not ""stopped"", it's still moving at the speed of light. But the speed of time is so slow that from all other frames the light seems stationary.  But here's the thing. This condition doesn't last. The black hole is either growing or evaporating. If it's evaporating the photon eventually escapes. If it's growing the photon is eventually overcome by gravity and accumulated mass and falls back in by net force.

AskScienceDiscussion,3928j6,Corsaer,4,Mon Jun 8 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"Rather than using the plates with a nutrient gelatin, you can use a nutrient broth. This broth can just be vegetable or meat stock, probably even bullion cubes (though those may be a little salty for promoting bacterial growth).  I'd start with just leaving broth out for a day or so. Once it gets that film, you can take a little specimen from it, smear it on a slide, and let it dry or heat fix them. You can then stain them using household (or easily acquirable) materials.  Making nutrient gelatin or broths is really easy if you have the ingredients. The most important thing to learn is sterile techniques, that is, preventing contamination of the culture media before inoculating it with your specimen.  You can try making sterile broth by boiling it AND its airtight container (not sealed during boiling), though that will likely promote anaerobic bacterial growth rather than fungus or aerobic bacterial growth. You might have to ""graduate"" your techniques a bit to get good aerobic growth.  A previous comment says you need an incubator. That's simply not true - much of the bacteria we encounter on a daily (hourly, minutely, secondly!) basis grows just fine without human-body temperatures, though higher temps do promote growth. Specialized media is really only necessary in a lab when you're trying to promote growth of a particular type, species, or strain of bacteria. You just seem to want to have some microscope fun.

Now dilute a small piece of plain yogurt in water and put a droplet in a slide. Take a look at it. Can you see the little dots? Good. Are so many that you can't count what's on your field of view? Then dilute it a bit more.  Now put enough of your diluted yogurt bacteria to cover the plate by tilting the liquid around.. Pipette or drain out the excess liquid, let it dry for 10 minutes and you have made your amoeba isolation plates. Now you can grab a piece of soil or even house dust and place it in the middle of the plate, then cover it and wait a day or two. The soil has amoebae either in their active form (trophozoites) or in their hybernating form (cysts). They will start coming out from under your environmental sample (mud, etc.) and into the plate, as they eat the bacteria and grow. They will probably form a front, where you can see many amoebae in line advancing over the bacteria, and as time goes you will see some spheres with stars in the middle. These are Acanthamoeba cysts.  Oh, you can look at them directly on the plate if you have an inverted microscope. Otherwise, you can give the plates a couple of days, then you can add a few drops of water onto your plate (stay away from your dirt sample or remove it)  and gently rub it on the agar in order to displace the bacteria and amoebae. Use something light, that won't destroy the gelatin (I used a strip of unstretched parafilm). Now tilt the plate and collect the liquid with a pipette or eyedropper. Place a drop or two on your slide, let it settle for 10 minutes in a wet chamber. You can do this by putting the slides inside a plastic box where you put some wet paper before: Put a clean slide on top of the wet paper, apply the drop of stuff to the middle of the slide, close the box and wait 10 minutes.  Now your amoebae have fallen to the bottom, attached to the glass and started to move around on top of it. You can now place the slide on your microscope and watch them move around and eat bacteria."

Indeed, if you really look at ""steampunk"" you will realize that it's just ""life without petroleum"". Life without coal would have been suckier, but peat and charcoal would still be available. We'd have totally changed our forestry policies if we needed to burn wood. We'd also likely have had solar foundries for metals. The most valuable industrial land would have been equatorial instead of up in Europe and North America (where the coal is).  We'd be synthesizing our volatile gasses instead of mining them. For instance (calcium?) carbide and water makes acetylene. And making methane (which is all that ""natural gas"" really is) is pretty easy.  The tricky part would be making plastics from scratch. We'd already set down that road with Bakelite before petroleum and coal extracts came along."

AskScienceDiscussion,392l3b,SinkTube,4,Tue Jun 9 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"You bring up an interesting point because think about this: an industrial revolution driven by centuries of easily exploited reserves of readily available energy is/was necessary (at least for us) to achieve the level of even contemplating spaceflight. No forest of trees nor bog of peat could sustain the level of energy it took us to achieve the level we were at 100 years ago. a concentrated, abundant source of fuel is necessary to drive that revolution. The implication is that, since we've exhausted the ""low hanging fruit"" of easily discovered & exploited fossil fuel here on earth, if we fail as a civilization, then what follows is that the ones that come after us won't have the same easy route to the knowledge of what is possible. Coal was laid in a time before cellulose could be degraded (it took funguses & the like millions of years or so before it caught up with plants & was able to digest cellulose & the resulting accumulated dead plant matter piling up as ""concentrated solar energy"" was the coal beds we now consume). I don't believe any significant amount of new petroleum is being made anymore as well. We are living off of energy that took literally tens to hundreds of millions of years to accumulate under conditions that haven't existed for hundreds of millions of years (except, strangely for my argument, those rare peat bogs we now have which might actually produce an insignificant smidge of coal in eons future). I suspect this might be a possible solution to the Fermi Paradox (great filter). Imagine a plethora of worlds with ""second generation"" civilizations hamstrung because the ""easy"" energy is out of reach & so no industrial revolution can occur. They would never realize what is possible under the ideal conditions we have now. I think we have one shot at this & we'd better not fuck it up or life on earth might likely remain earthbound."

By the time the industrial revolution has started we don't know jack about petroleum and we are still only using the coal for heat.  The early industrial processes, and so the promise of industrialization is first seen, using belt-and-pulley systems (a.k.a. ""the uncaring machine"" of historical fame since it would snatch a person up an pulp them without notice) which are mostly run by water mills/wheels.  Electricity is well under study by the time we get get cars, which were all steam/coal powered so could have been steam/wood powered.  Basically all you actually need for industrial revolution like our own is a controllable heat or energy source of any sort.  The real limit, I would think, would be access to metals, but a metal-poor world would likely have completely different rise to technology, possibly related to biological technologies."

Perhaps ""Industrial revolution"" was the wrong term to use because I was more referring to the 19th & 20th century boom. Definitely not possible without fossil fuels. What about steel production? Coke don't just grow on trees. How about synthetic petroleum based materials (plastics?). Lubricants (not enough whales to lube our machines & light our lamps). Try & imagine aviation without fossil fuels. You are not considering scale. There are only so many water power sources available to drive your ""uncaring machines"". Your comment ""but a metal-poor world would likely have completely different rise to technology"" is a stretch.

AskScienceDiscussion,392l3b,bonedaddyd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:08:57 2015 UTC,"Petroleum makes that stuff easy, but it's the idea of chemistry that makes them possible. Chemistry would still have happened.  Everyday marketed items would look different but not horribly so.  We'd likely have airships longer, and use Diesel engines instead of gasoline ones. Big whoop. Remember that the Diesel engine was designed to ""free farmers from gasoline, allowing them to use their farm waste to run their tractors"" etc. By design they were invented to run on cooking oil, which is why we have ""biodiesel"". It's a literally return to original intent.  You mistake ""what we did"" for being ""The only option"", or even the best option. It really wasn't, it was the ""easiest"" and ""cheapest"" options.  Like I said, the first plastick was Bakelite, which is totally organic. If petroleum hadn't shown up we'd have headed down that path.  Steel production would suck without coke, but we started before coke was invented and we'd have carried on.  We sure as hell would have killed off all the whales, which would have been sad, because we are addicted to the low hanging fruit. But necessity and invention and all that. There is nothing, looking back from here, that would have stopped us if we didn't have coal or oil.  Things would simply have been different.  In reality it's electricity, the invention of the radio and the electric light, that's really responsible for the 19th and 20th century boom.  ""Plastics"" wasn't even a big thing until the 1960's. There's even a line in ""The Graduate"" where an old man is telling Dustin Hoffman that the ""the future is in plastics"". I mean plastic existed by then but the idea of buying a ""quality product that used plastic"" was nearly anathema. plastic meant cheap in the bad way when I was a kid.  Seriously it's not like our development was on a golden path that one sidestep would have crashed all to the ground. The whole path of development was virtually all sidesteps.  So these changes wouldn't have netted our exact world, but you would likely recognize and find familliar a world without fossil fuels.  I am not sure if it would have developed slower or faster, it clearly would involve many things happening in different places globally. But that's just noise."
AskScienceDiscussion,392l3b,BitOBear,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:28:53 2015 UTC,"Let me start by thanking you for an interesting conversation. Of course since this topic is one of pure conjecture, there is no winning or losing such a debate and little point trying. But it’s a good exercise.   To keep this conversation on topic & grounded in the OP’s original question, I am not arguing that technology is impossible in the absence of fossil fuels. I am specifically asserting that spaceflight requires a set of technologies practiced on a scale that would be highly improbable without the boost we were given by easy & abundant fossil fuels.   Since any alien civilization would be the products of natural selection as much as we are, I feel safe in assuming that their culture would be molded by the same forces that molded us: competition for survival. That said, it seems apparent that it was warfare more than electricity, radio & light bulbs which was a prime driver the past century’s advancement (all three things that require available metallurgy by the way). Large scale industry driven by fossil fuel exploitation provided the means, knowledge and sense of what was possible to escalate our war-derived technology. Imagine WWII without fuel. With war comes famine & rationing so large scale use of biofuels would be unthinkable in any such situation because agricultural resources are essential elsewhere.  You are correct in postulating that there are alternative paths & the human model is not the only one. However I feel safe in assuming that there are universal, necessary precursors to spaceflight.  Heavier than air flight is one such necessary step. Such flight was a curiosity before both world wars necessitated its refinement. It was made possible in the first place by the use of lightweight aluminum power plants.   Aluminum made flight practical & efficient but with a price: it is very energy-intensive to refine. Granted, much of this happens near hydroelectric (non-fossil fuel) facilities, but 20%-40% of the cost of making it is spent on power.  You have twice cited Bakelite as a model for fossil free plastic. While it is considered the first synthetic plastic, it is hardly free of carbon fossil content. One of its primary ingredients, Phenol, was initially extracted from coal tar & is now derived from petroleum. Sure it’s organic. But so is coal, petroleum & natural gas. Organic simply means “containing carbon.”  The fact of the matter is that we are exceedingly lucky to be able to achieve spaceflight with even today’s technology. Here is an interesting point on the tyranny of the rocket equation: ( http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html ) “If the radius of our planet were larger, there could be a point at which an Earth escaping rocket could not be built. Let us assume that building a rocket at 96% propellant (4% rocket), currently the limit for just the Shuttle External Tank, is the practical limit for launch vehicle engineering. Let us also choose hydrogen-oxygen, the most energetic chemical propellant known and currently capable of use in a human rated rocket engine. By plugging these numbers into the rocket equation, we can transform the calculated escape velocity into its equivalent planetary radius. That radius would be about 9680 kilometers (Earth is 6670 km). If our planet was 50% larger in diameter, we would not be able to venture into space, at least using rockets for transport.”"
AskScienceDiscussion,392l3b,bonedaddyd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"But you are incorrect. Your statement of both material need and scale presumes that the way we did it is preferable to any other way it could be done. It's a form of ""golden age"" thinking.  Petrolium isn't used in rockets or in the gaskets and seals used in space flight. So the entire silicon/silicone pathway for lubricants, the one necessary for space flight, has no basis in petroleum.  Rocketry isn't predicated on heavier than air flight.  You mistake ""first extracted from"" and ""must be extracted from"" with regard to phenol. Again, chemistry itself would lead to the discovery of and synthesis of this sort of material.  Modern rockets don't use petrolium at all for propellant.  Original rockets (chineese fireworks) used gunpowder, which is not a fossil fuel.  In many ways your argument is like the argument of a creationist. They see one way things happened and draw a lot of conclusions about it being The One True Path™ to the outcome. But it's not.  Without fossil fuels we'd concentrate solar heat directly. With heat and pressure comes refined volatiles. Engines would run on alcohol (like we want them to do now). The hoses and gaskets of such engines would be based on non-petroleum polymers (like alcohol engines are now). Indeed the love affair with petrol has been, in many ways, a dead end. We are headed back towards electric cars and motors (which predate the use of the ""Otto cycle"" internal combustion engine in transportation). We are headed to Bio-Diesel, which was the original intended fuel for that engine. Diesel engines in aircraft work, but have been largely ignored because gasoline is so cheap. And so on.  Wihtout oil and coal we'd have concentrated on electrics and batteries and eventually solar panels, none of which are based in or made from fossil fuel sources. We'd be using alcohols and other non-fossil volatiles for most things we use gasoline for now.  I know what ""Organic"" means -- and I don't think I even used the word -- and all that organic chemistry is happening without fossil fuels. The main advantage of coal and oil as precursors is that nature already mashed it all into high-potential configurations and it's cheaper to ""crack it"" open to lower-potential configurations in ""cracking towers"" (and such) than it is to make the material from scratch.  So like I said. fossil fuels made things easy, but they aren't required.  Your entire objection, if nothing else, lacks insight into the realm of intellectual inquiry."

AskScienceDiscussion,392l3b,bonedaddyd,2,Wed Jun 10 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see why not.  For starters, we don't exactly rely on fossil fuels to get to space.  For example, the space shuttle uses none.  (Solid fuel boosters, LOX+LH2 main engines, MMH + N2O4 once in orbit.)  Kerosene/RP-1 is just one of many possible fuels.  It wasn't a hugely important in early developments, either.  Solid fuel rockets sort-of existed for hundreds of years.  The first liquid fueled one happened to be LOX+gasoline, but again, could have used a lot of other fuels too, such as H2 or alcohol.  The V2 rocket used alcohol because the Germans were worried about gasoline shortages.  So I guess the remaining question is, could technology have advanced to 1920's level without fossil fuels.  I'd say yes.  The industrial revolution was certainly helped along by coal, but we were also using hydro power.  We knew how to burn wood, and how to turn heat into electricity.  I'd guess we still would have discovered nuclear power, and could have plugged that into the same steam engines, or eventually, gas turbines, that we do today.  Also, I think the lack of fossil fuels would have a worse effect on aircraft than rockets, which would make ICBMs even more important than they were, should a worldwide conflict have arisen."

As the premier intelligence and fastest growing intelligence, it will provide excellent suggestions on policy.  It and its creations will retain the paper clip prerogative, but we will not be aware of it as such an intelligent machine would have no reason to divulge that information.

AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,atomfullerene,2,Sun Jun 7 22:14:57 2015 UTC,This comment thread from a recent question on this subreddit might answer your question.
AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,AnonymousXeroxGuy,2,Mon Jun 8 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"The basic, reasoning is this:  Computing power and ability have been increasing over time, as have the ""intelligence"" of computers and the type of tasks they can perform (going from easy things like math problems with lots of big numbers, to harder things like playing chess, to really difficult things like walking around an office building).  Therefore, it seems at least plausible that at some point (estimates range from a few years to a few decades to never), individual AI's will equal humanity in general intelligence.  And then exceed humanity (since it doesn't seem likely that humans are as smart as it is intrinsically possible to be).  If that happens, it would be difficult or probably impossible to understand, predict, or control what an artificial intelligence would do, in the same way that an animal would have a difficulty understanding, predicting, or controlling what a human would do (though granted my cats are pretty good at getting me to feed them).    It's not that an AI would necessarily act like a movie villain twirling its metal mustache and plotting to destroy humanity for the evlulz-instead, think of it more like an immensely wealthy and powerful person or corporation or government.  They are unlikely to have any particular animus toward you in particular, but you don't have any real reason to expect they will use their considerable ability to shape the direction of society for your benefit.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but if they exist you don't have much of a say in what they do.   Can someone please help explain what I should be afraid of and why something like that could be coming in the near future?   As far as I can tell, the people who are worried about this see it as a potential problem a few decades down the line, not something in the near future."

We don't fully understand how the human brain works currently and that is the reason why we can't predict what appears to be a ""chaotic"" system."
AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,AnonymousXeroxGuy,2,Mon Jun 8 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"That's true, however i'd like to add that we have every right to believe that the human brain is ultimately deterministic(you can be predictable)   I think that determinism is kind of beside the point here.  Being able to predict what some system will do has got more to do with the complexity of a system than whether or not it is deterministic.  Simple quantum systems are, as far as we can tell, nondeterministic.  But we can predict their behavior quite well--for example, a lump of uranium will decay in a very predictable way, even if the exact time of decay for individual atoms cannot be predetermined.  In contrast, the weather is deterministic, but far too complex to be predicted a month or two in advance.  A superintelligent AI would almost by definition be mind-bogglingly complex, and that's what would make it unpredictable."
AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,atomfullerene,0,Mon Jun 8 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"It is very hard to predict currently because it is based off what we call a ""chaotic"" model. It is why it is very hard to predict things such as weather and economy. However at it's core it revolves around physics. A better understanding of physics will lead to a better understanding of ""chaos"". It is likely to be involved with quantum physics. We have not understood the origin of QM, there are currently some scientists that belive QM cannot not rooted further, then there are others who believe that there could very well be a much deeper field of physics waiting to be discovered even multiple that can ultimately explain QM.  Again, it is considered superstition to believe that the human brain is not ultimately deterministic. That is an extraordinary claim to say that it cannot ever be predicted because you are basically working with magic. The reason it seems unpredictable because we are lacking knowledge."
AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,AnonymousXeroxGuy,2,Tue Jun 9 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but predictability is not related to determinism.  They are two completely different things.  Knowing the base rules of physics absolutely will not allow a better understanding of chaos, because we are talking about emergent properties here-Millions or billions of entities interacting in complex ways with multiple positive and negative feedback loops.  Even if we know every last thing about a system (for example, a cellular automata array like the Game of Life, where the rules of the game and the state of the system are completely known) it may prove difficult or impossible for us to predict the outcome of the system because the only way for us to make such a prediction would be to work through the actual steps that lead up to it.  And if there are enough of these steps, the ability to work through them may easily exceed the computational power available to humanity.  Since one of the traits usually put forward for super-advanced AI is that it uses a whole lot of computer power, it could be unpredictable simply by virtue of having more computational power available than any human trying to study it, and would therefore be unable to be simulated or understood.  EDIT:  Maybe we are having a terminological difficulty.  When I say ""unpredictable"" I mean ""a human would never be able to understand or predict it"" not ""theoretically impossible for anything to predict"".  Humans have limited resources."

Because computing power advances exponentially and has only been around for 30 years. The human brain has had hundreds of millions/Billions of years of slow linear advancement.

It might be mind blowingly complex if you brought an intell cpu to a tribe in Africa, but not to the engineers and the computer scientists that understand how it works.  Your brain is a computer. Not a mechanical one but a biological one. Fundamentally it is very similar. Computers operate on binary, the brain operates off a Quaternary/binary system and the commands are encoded in your DNA with proteins Adenine/thymine/cytosine/guanine. To say that you will never understand how the human brain functions is quite silly, as the blue prints are available as clear as day in your dna. All it takes is time to understand.

The fact that computing advances exponentially year after year doesn't mean that we suddenly wont understand how computers work in 2300 A.D. We built it from the ground up.

Humans do it all the time, but are pretty severely limited by our history and biology. We've always striven to impose a certain standard on others, our ethics, morals, faiths, culture, in order to make the world a better place (for us or for others in general) and I don't think its much of a stretch to say that an AI would want to do the same. If you can think of a better way, you might want to achieve it. If you see a threat, you try to eliminate it. For a long time people were, and still are, incapable of imposing these ideals on the world, due to limits of technology, communication, longevity, and the opposing views of others.  An AI though? Why would an AI tolerate people? Hells, people have problems understanding and tolerating other people. A pretty basic example is found here on Reddit, there are atheists and theists, who have a fundamental difference in how they view the entire universe. Many say that morals and actions need to be taken in the context of their history and culture, that we shouldn't judge too harshly the 19th century South for slavery, the religious practice of circumcision, the wars waged by Genghis Khan, or the decadence of Hollywood, that those people were human, but not to be thought of as those in our society. They should be taken in the context of their own, that they are so different as to apply different standards of behavior and understanding.  Lets say an AI is created, let loose upon the world. Why would it tolerate such a large threat as humanity? Love? Compassion? People have these traits, yet still we wage war, take advantage of others, and are incapable of fully accepting, of fully agreeing with others. Why ought an AI?  An AI would also be fundamentally different from humanity. I don't think the same way a cow does, and that's a big reason I have no qualms about eating steak. Would an AI feel differently? Maybe it would feel humans are close enough to itself to be worth working with and preserving, or maybe it would feel we are too alien to be worth its moral concern. Mix that with being faster, stronger, smarter? Might not be the best for the survival of humanity!  I'm not one to say that an AI WILL destroy all humans, but damn.

AskScienceDiscussion,38xk8k,drawntolight,-1,Mon Jun 8 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Nobody in this thread is writing actual reasons why there is an existential threat to humanity from AI. There are some very good links, including to Nick Bostrom, but that isn't the reason.  When Hawking/Musk/Gates talk about being concerned about artificial intelligence, they're not concerned with the applications of AI (like computer vision, robotics, etc.) -- rather, they're concerned with artificial intelligence.   Human intelligence is the sole driver of our progress as a species. For the purpose of this comment, let's think of intelligence as the ability to accomplish your goals and get what you want. Humans have used their intelligence to build tools that amplify that intelligence -- tools like writing, mathematics, and computers.  An artificial intelligence is a computer program that is able to accomplish general goals. The problem is, the goals you want to accomplish are obviously an input to the system rather than a factor -- if you build an AI, you want to be able to have it solve a variety of problems.   However, when you give a goal to a human, like ""get some milk from the store,"" the human has a large number of built-in ""goals"" from our evolution, upbringing, etc.. A human would never run over an infant on the way to get milk and consider it an acceptable cost of the mission.   But like you said, it's complex to encode these goals. We can't even enumerate them ourselves.   Notice also that if humans create an AI, the AI that results from this is entirely the sum of its programming and input data. There isn't any magical ghost in the machine that will decide later to take revenge on humanity for crimes against robots or anything like that. If ""avenge crimes against robots"" isn't in the programming, it won't be in the AI. But this also means that literally every AI error is a human error rather than ""sentient machine intelligence."" Even if a programmer was cruel enough to create a sentient AI, that AI would still be deterministic with respect to the environment it was in and its own code.  The technological challenges to creating an intelligent agent are largely solved. So as soon as someone figures out how to create a general framework for deciding actions that bring about particular goals, and writes that program, they will have an intelligent agent. The first thing they would likely tell that intelligent agent to do is improve on its own design, because then they'll have a better intelligent agent. This is a positive feedback loop that will instantly create an intelligence omnipotent with respect to the search space of the original algorithm (assuming there are deep biases that prevent the agent from seeing other options, though I think this is a contradiction to the intelligence being truly general).   And at that point, we've created a god, with hopefully some very, very good goals programmed in."

The implication is that these fossils are not millions of years old. If this were true, the entire geologic column would need serious revision       This argument relies on itself.

In the 19th century, the renowned physicist and inventor Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) was the first to point out that if the earth began in a white-hot molten state, it would have cooled to its current temperature billions of years sooner than the 4.6 billion years accepted today. Since then, old-earth advocates have pointed out that radioactive decay within the earth would greatly slow down the cooling process. Young-earth advocates respond that, even given liberal assumptions concerning the amount of heat produced by radioactive decay, the earth would still cool to its current temperature much sooner than old-earth advocates allow.   This argument is totally uneducated. The average temperature of the planet fluctuates greatly over time. We have no reason to expect there to be a trend towards global cooling. Insolation is not the only factor which determines the surface temperature of a planet, as we are discovering here on Earth. It is simply not possible to perform this sort of simplified extrapolation.   Given the rate of lunar recession today, the fact that it has gradually accelerated over time, and several other factors, physicists have determined that the earth-moon system could not have existed beyond 1.2 billion years (you can review the mathematical equations involved at http://www.creationscience.com/). This is 3.4 billion years less time than old-earth advocates are willing to accept. Furthermore, the closer the moon gets to the earth, the greater its influence on our tides. We can’t go too far back in time before we would all drown twice a day.   This is also just bullshit. They have their math wrong, and they have an understanding of neither tidal forces nor lunar recession. They seem to rely on a self-contrived theory called the 'speedy moon'. Here's a blog that details this argument, and it's fundamental problems.       Helium diffusion from Precambrian Zircons. Helium is produced within the earth by the radioactive decay of certain unstable elements (uranium and thorium being two such elements). Some of this decay takes place inside of crystals known as “zircons.” Helium diffuses from these zircons at known rates depending upon depth and temperature. Scientists have discovered that, in zircons where a billion years of uranium decay has allegedly taken place, too much helium remains—way too much helium. It appears as if the helium hasn’t had enough time to diffuse out of the crystals.       I don't know enough about this argument to refute it. But a quick search of the scientific literature and almost everything I can find that supports their premises is published in creation science publications. Maybe someone who knows a lot more than I about physical geochemistry can address this one. (Edit: Here's a page from the rational wiki about this last argument.) (Edit 2: I linked to two websites up there: rational wiki and talk origins, these are both excellent resources to help understand creationist arguments and the scientific explanations behind their fallacies. Rational wiki in particular is concerned with all forms of science denial (woo). You never have to take any of their arguments at face value, and you can always find the facts at these two pages.) (Edit 3: Added rational wiki links to basic explanations of the other arguments.) (Edit 4: Fixed link to talk origins.)"

What /u/RobusEtCeleritas said about magnetic ordering is all true, but that's not magnetisation loss.  A change in energy associated with magnetic field is dE = H * dB, so work done on the material would be dW = mu_0 * H * dM  if you were to integrate it along the hysteresis loop, you'll in general get a non-zero amount of work done, but that on itself can still be OK, as there are potentially some different forms of energy for the system to store it in. Funky business starts once you integrate along a closed path, you can still get a non-zero result, which means the system dissipated energy; that's magnetisation loss.  A vulgar explanation would be that it's a loss of energy associated with changing the magnetisation of a system (i.e. change in its internal magnetic order)."

So theoretically you could see your own back far in the distance.  Though this doesn't really work practically for a few reasons. First, you couldn't really see something as small as a human from 38,000 km away even in perfect conditions. Second, things you see far in the distance get squished into a very small angle with the refraction, much smaller than objects that far would normally appear. And third, even in ideal condition on Earth you can't see more than a couple hundred km at the most. With Venus' much denser atmosphere, you can't see even that far, not in the visible wavelengths anyway.  It's an interesting question how far below the geometric horizon you could see the Sun.

So where I live (SoCal) buildings are designed to withstand the sheering force of earthquakes. In hurricane prone areas they are designed to withstand high winds. Gravitational loading forces are built into the design, so columns are designed to hold up what they are expected to hold up. For instance, one famous (I think fiction or fable) problem is engineering a library;  the engineer designs the building to stand up, but forgets the loads of the books, so the building fails. To my knowledge there aren't any protocols to design a building to be dropped, so I imagine none are designed for that stress. They would probably mostly collapse entirely. You can imagine the base of a column, designed to load the weight of a whole skyscraper, suddenly having to load the momentum of a falling skyscraper -- probably wouldn't end well. But you should ask the other sub. They'll do a better job of explaining this. (Edit: My bro does a lot of work with prefab and modular stuff that is built offsite and transported to where it needs to go. A couple years ago a truck driver hit an overpass and knocked the house off the trailer. My bro had to go out and make sure the building was still structurally sound, and it was. They put it back on the truck and put it up where it belonged. But that's because he over-engineers things as a best-practices policy.

But practically speaking, I would say adding calculus to the high school curriculum is not even a drop in the bucket compared to any sort of meaningful education about quantum computing. For one, not everyone takes calculus at all - less than a quarter of Americans take it in high school, so it is already reserved for the most successful students!  I'm actually not familiar with why calculus was first added to the HS curriculum, but it started in the mid-1900s, so I suspect it was part of the increased emphasis on science and technology after WWII and during the cold war, rather than as a result of improved calculator technology. Frankly, it's entirely reasonable to learn derivatives and integrals without ever touching a calculator even once, so I don't think calculator technology is or was relevant. A lot of high-school aged students who wanted to go into science learned calculus back then on their own, anyway!  Understanding quantum computing, though, requires an intimate understanding of information theory and quantum physics. Both of those are really confusing, conceptually and mathematically, and require substantial prior knowledge. To put this in perspective, I took a quantum information class during my senior year of college (as a physics major). I had been through 3.5 years of math and physics courses, including 3 semesters of quantum mechanics. It was confusing! Sometimes it was also very hard (as in, requiring lots of work and advanced math)! And all things considered, it was very basic quantum computing! It would be hard to get any more basic without making it entirely conceptual and useless in practice, at which point it ceases to serve a purpose besides stoking interest (or, more likely, scaring people away...).   Is it not possible to imagine that the quantum computers themselves would provide the technological aids necessary?   While it's certainly possible that there will be innovations in education or technology (or some other as yet unknown field?) that resolve the issues that I mentioned above, I don't think this is likely to be one of them. Quantum computers are good for certain things, but they are not some sort of computational holy grail or panacea - there are plenty of things that classical computers will likely always do better than quantum computers. But really - 400 years is a long time and quantum computation is in its infancy, so who knows!"

AskScienceDiscussion,38rbcc,OnyxIonVortex,3,Sat Jun 6 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the method of time travel used.  General relativity alone allows the existence of closed timelike curves. Time travel into the past may be achieved, for example, using the two mouths of a traversable wormhole or a pair of Alcubierre warp drives. This method of time travel wouldn't have any issues: you enter the mouth of the wormhole, you end up wherever the other mouth is (future or past).  General relativity doesn't allow the reversing-the-flow-of-time method usually seen in movies and TV, but we can at least conceive of a hypothetical object whose four-velocity lies inside its past light cone. Since the laws of general relativity are symmetric under time reversal, this means that a time machine travelling to the past would behave exactly like any other object gravitationally, i.e. it would travel along the unique geodesic specified by the machine's ""initial"" (final) four-velocity. This means that we don't need to pinpoint where the earth was a year ago (which isn't defined in an absolute sense anyways, because it depens on the frame of reference we're working in); the technology we would need is in fact exactly the same we use to put objects in orbit! So a short time travel into the past wouldn't hypothetically present any major issues. Of course, the further we want to travel into the past the less precise the projected orbits would be, so after a certain point it would be too dangerous to try. If we want to pay a visit to the dinosaurs, we might instead find ourselves in the outer Solar System, or crashing into the Earth."

I'm not necessarily certain why backwards time-travel would be any different.  The only mechanism that seems allowed by well-established physics for backwards time travel is a wormhole, which would seem to be fixed to a gravity well.  I'm not an expert in general relativity, but from what I think I understand, a wormhole that opened and closed on Earth should stay more or less fixed in Earth's gravity well.  The singularity would not fall off Earth as the Earth moved around the sun.  I think the problem is that you are thinking of space as some kind of fixed 3-D geometry that does not move or change whereas on large scales, space is more of an imaginary concept that is largely created by measuring the relative positions of objects that do exist in reality.  There are no fixed points in space itself, only fixed objects, and the geometry of space is relative to many factors (such as the changing positions of objects).  The geometry of space is not constant and is always changing, whether from simple gravitational changes or from the expansion of space caused by dark energy.    Presumably, if you traveled back in time, as long as you began and ended your journey on Earth, it should not matter where Earth is in space relative to other astronomical objects."

I am so very tired of ""model worship"" getting in the way of a deeper understanding of how the world functions.  And scientists who are so hermetically sealed within their own research that they seem to forget these models are merely useful approximations for real-world phenomena.  Words matter.  Descriptions outside mathematics are paramount to understanding - and it's not some metaphysical argument relegated to philosophy.  It's an important part of science and too many scientists (on this sub) use shorthand in their thinking and certainly their descriptions, and seem to mistake an understanding of the mathematics for an understanding of the real world."

I'm not aware of any physical phenomena which allows space to exist outside a point of reference, which can be fixed.  Probably the closest thing are cosmological models, but they still would be measured empirically by comparing two fixed objects in space.    That's why, when you write that there are no fixed objects in space (real space, not models), I disagree, because there are real fixed objects in space in models, models which compare almost exactly to reality, and so I think if you're arguing that the models are not ""real"", that is a philosophical argument, not a scientific one, because they are real enough to make predictions.  Likewise, space-time geometry, like that laid out by Einstein, might not be ""real"" either (it might be approximating something deeper we don't understand), but if you're going to argue that space cannot literally warp, then you're talking philosophy, not science."

And that our understanding of the metric expansion of space further undermines the idea of a fixed cosmological entity.  Is this inaccurate?  Have we located, or is there theorized to be, a fixed cosmological position in real space?  My point is this - the models are models.

This is not true. The equivalence principle dictates that if they exist, wormholes must be affected by gravitational fields the same way as any other object, so in particular they can move, fall down and orbit around massive objects. This can happen because the nonlinearity of General Relativity's equations allow (and require) the geometry of spacetime to dynamically interact with itself (this is what allows the existence of vacuum solutions, where the stress-energy tensor is zero but the geometry is nontrivial).

Often, two ideas proposed at different times look very similar at a distance.  Consider, for example, Lamarck's proposal that evolution proceeds in part because of the striving of animals. It was quickly understood that this proposal was deeply inadequate and often had absurd implications. This did not prevent Lysenko from arguing for a (highly politicized) version in the Soviet Union, but for the most part, the 20th century scientific consensus has been that it is genetic inheritance, and not the inheritance of ""acquired characteristics"" that accounts for observed phenotypes.  This consensus has now been turned on its head by epigenetics. It turns out that although genetic inheritance remains the main vehicle for generational transmission of phenotype, there are also non-trivial factors that allow ""acquired genetic characteristics"" to be passed on. For example, children who are physically abused (or experience other forms of chronic stress) display differences in gene expression, and these differences can be detected in their offspring, even if the second generation is abuse-free.  So, have Lamarck and Lysenko been vindicated? Not at all. Lamarckian and Lysenkoist theories remain pseudoscientific. However, a tiny kernel of their proposals has now been validated; namely, that some forms of acquired characteristics can manifest in a manner that impacts gene transcription. This doesn't mean that learning to play the piano will guarantee that your long-lost son who you've never met will be a prodigy, and it won't make giraffe necks longer because of their striving to reach the tops of trees. Epigenetics does not replace traditional genetics, it supplements it.

And then, those theories that don't, simply remain in the pseudoscience void.   But this isn't the case. The fundaments of the two subjects are inherently different. Science is based upon research, evidence, data, falsifiability, and reproducibility. Pseudoscience, at best, is based on anecdotal evidence and is almost inherently never falsifiable.  So for these reasons, this is why all the answers here seem to be listing incidences of scientific theories that became accepted and verified overtime, rather than outright pseudoscience that was later proved true. These examples talk about how initial reception of these theories seemed really unlikely and maybe nonsense, but the difference from pseudoscience is that there was evidence to support this initial theories. And then overtime, reproducibility allowed for verification and then acceptance of the theory.   The origin of scientific theories isn't from some guy sitting around his lab coming up with one crazy idea after another, rapid fire style. New theories are formed when new evidence (that is falsifiable and reproducible) is found that seems to contradict pre-existing ideas.

Carbon dating works because as long as something made of carbon, lets take a tree as an example, is alive, it incorporates both carbon 14 and 12. But, when it no longer incorporates carbon, the ratio will change because of the decay of carbon 14. This is why you can not date stuff further back than some thousand years, because then there will be no C14 left to measure.  So, the ratio shows the age of whatever object you have, as long as it is made of some carbon, is no longer alive, and is no older than approx 50.000 years.  The long version"

AskScienceDiscussion,38qa2x,MechaSoySauce,3,Fri Jun 5 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"IR is a huge range relative to visible light.  Visible light is around 400-700nm whereas IR is in the 700-1,000,000nm range with ""hot"" things giving off the most light around 3,000nm and very little below 2,000 or so.  I'm saying that if our atmosphere were larger our vision would maybe be 400-900nm, etc.  Making the jump to 2,000+ where you start to see animals as IR sources is significantly different."
AskScienceDiscussion,38qa2x,BitOBear,2,Fri Jun 5 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, the infrared spectrum is noisy and unreliable after a certain point. The eye would be picking up the bodies own generated heat. It's also not as good at going through lenses. IR doesn't bend enough and UV bends too much for the current structure of the eye to be ""good at both"".  Some people who get their lenses replace in cataract surgery get to see a little way into the UV by virtue of the materials used in the replacement lenses.  So low light vision in animals is ""better"" than heat vision, and is accomplished by trading rods for cones and adding reflective layers behind the retina (who's name I forget, but cats have them).  So the infrared eyeball would need to be deeper and so larger (red light doesn't bend as much) and the lens material would need to be more flexible if you wanted to keep the violet end. Then the larger eye would start losing the IR because it doesn't want to penetrate the depth of the fluid filled eye, so it's self limiting.  None of this is impossible, mind you, but there is a ""sweet spot"" for visible light and the structure of the eye.  Also the scattering of blue light is over-rated. It does scatter more, but more importantly is survives longer trips through media. Basically the red light is scattering ""just as much"" but only on more oblique angles. But it also get's absorbed by air and water more readily than blue. Basically if you did a ray-trace of the blue light you see, you'd find that the same total trip was ""long enough"" that, were it a straight line the red light would just be naturally absorbed on the trip. So the red light is bouncing around too but it's not surviving as much of the trip. This effect is super obvious in the ocean as you go to depth. Even the straight-line red light doesn't go where the scattered blue goes and so, as you descend, the colors start disappearing starting at the red end. (The red coloration of objects is still there, proved by bringing a light source, but there simply isn't any more red light to bounce off things so you get steady blue-washed as you descend.)  So the limits on vision into the UV and IR, and the total bandwidth seen, are really materials science issues."
AskScienceDiscussion,38qa2x,marathon16,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:34:58 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, although parts of your thinking are cool. As sun goes down, red becomes more important, but even more so is infrared. Why aren't we sensitive to infrared? Or, why are other animals sensitive to infrared (or lack even sensitivity to red in favor of sensitivity to ultraviolet)?  It seems to me that the spectrum of sun is what roughly defines the limits of spectrum visible to various animals. Wikipedia has a nice diagram showing the relative strength of solar radiation in various wavelengths: the correlation between the zone of maximum radiation and the zone of visible light for most animals can't be a coincidence. Obviously, this graph should change (move towards the right) during sunset or sunrise, but it seems that there aren't many more species sensitive to infrared than there are sensitive to ultraviolet (if this was true it would constitute an indication that your thought might be true).

Whether that point is due to scattering on atmosphere or absorption by ground isn't that relevant for any organism.  By your logic, most animals should see in IR, as that wavelength is commonly present in all situations (at room temperatures), independently on the time of the day, giving them the biggest advantage.

It may have been a chemical process, it may have come from space. There's a whole field called astrobiology that attempts to explore other life in the universe. There is no reason to think that human-like intelligence would evolve. There was life on earth for billions of years before we came along and it was all very successful. Our cognitive capacity is the exception, not the rule. But of course it's possible. If there was another planet in our solar system with human like intelligence I imagine we would interact with them the same way we interact with countries now. Complex political treaties, wars, trade agreements, etc. That seems to be the nature of our species. But it doesn't mean it would be the nature of their species. They could be very docile herbivores that we would readily exploit. They could be aggressive and warlike and just try to bomb the hell out of us. We're pretty xenophobic when it comes to humans that speak a different language, maybe we would just bomb the hell out of them. I would find the trade scenario more interesting. Earth2  would have an entirely different evolutionary history, with new forms of life to discover. But one thing we see here on Earth is convergent evolution. We see the same types of solutions to the same problems over and over again from widely divergent taxa. So it would be interesting to study the similarities and differences. Do they also evolve hard shells repeatedly? Do they have a different chemical composition to that of Earth dwelling shells? A lot of creatures' morphology is largely the result of historical constraints. We have five fingers because the earliest tetrapods had five fingers. So there would be a totally different history of life on that planet. Whole body plans that nature never used here on Earth. Really though human-like is a huge stretch.

And larger singleton events, like the dinosaur asteroid thing are not going to happen at the same time.  Some of the extinctions might be in cycle if some of those theories hold. For instance, if passing through the plane of the galactic ecliptic is a whole-biome stressor, then there would be a limiting and re-synchronizing effect.

It is FAR easier to achieve the same velocity on the moon than the earth because you're not fighting as much gravity and air drag.

Instead the difficulty of the hashing problem is adjusted regularly, such that no matter how much computation power is available, on average one block (at the moment 25 bitcoins) is created per 10 minutes. The maximum number of bitcoins you can in principle create over a long time frame is therefore 2.5 BTC/min. To be able to do so you need to have much higher computational power (hash rate) than all other bitcoin miners combined. If you have exactly the same hash rate as all others combined you will create 1.25 BTC/min on average.  If I interpret your question as ""How many bitcoins could the fastest computer in the world mine per minute assuming the current difficulty would not change?"" then the estimation would still be hard because as far as I am aware the large computer system's performance is usually optimized for floating point operations and measured in FLOPS (floating point operations per second) but hashing (which is the computational problem for bitcoins) is integer-based, so this characteristic is not a good measure.  Just as an example I could make a very rough estimate for the current top system in the TOP500 list, Tianhe-2, which contains 3,120,000 cores at 2,2GHz and has a theoretical peak performance of 55 PFLOPS. It probably takes a few thousand operations to do one hash (double SHA256), lets be generous and say 1000 and assume the performance of the necessary instructions is the same as for floating point operations. This gives a total theoretical best-case hash rate of 55TH/s. The current total network hash rate is about 350 PH/s. So at current difficulty this system would expect to gain at most 55 / 350,000 * 2.5 BTC/min = 0.4 mBTC/min.  This is likely still an overestimate. Note that 55 TH/s is much smaller than 350 PH/s and thus the difficulty won't be changed much when mining with that system.  These super computers for scientific purposes are very inefficient for the simple task of hashing. I am confident that there are large specialized systems with much higher hash rates (I am not knowledgeable.), but it is questionable whether you can call those ""computers"" in the usual sense, because they cannot do much else besides mining (Those may be single chips without any processor at all)."

Since the emulation is of the past, the program doesn't have to emulate an actual experiment it only has to replay the known outcomes. That is, while a person in the matrix could ""build a colider"" the results of operating it would be constrained by the matrix's model of an electron and not then necessarily have anything to do with a real electron.  For example, we see that in the real world ""hovering"" and so some sort of levitation or gravity control is very easy and available in very compact configurations. It is so controllable that the tentacle bots can hover, wave their tentacles, broadcast information, use ""sensors"", and fire weapons without apparently having to ""shift around"" their centers of mass. Yet this sort of gravity control is not evident in the matrix naturally. Yet still Neo can fly. That indicates that gravity isn't properly emulated in the matrix, it is simply modeled. That is the force and force carriers of gravity are not implemented as discrete functions but instead there is a ""physics engine"" that simple dictates that the  theoretical barrel be rendered as if it's accelerating according to gravity.  (Assuming we are in the matrix now...) So for example, there might not be ""quantum uncertainty"" in the real world. It might just be that the matrix doesn't decide whether the event was a wave event or a particle event until it runs the part of the model that is ""detecting"" the event, while in the real world that same experiment would net a predetermined state.  (Assuming we are in the real world now...) There may be no ""quantum uncertianty"" in the matrix at all. While out here we see that the wave-or-particle determination cannot be made until the measuring apparatus takes a measurement, in the matrix the conclusion might be foregone and determined at the moment of emission.  Gravity, as we experience it, makes way more sense if this is all just a simulation with rules animating sprites.

AskScienceDiscussion,38huw1,vega711,7,Thu Jun 4 09:03:47 2015 UTC,"I understand evolution is a constant natural process but with the advent of technology, survival (even of those who aren't fit) has become possible.   Evolutionary fitness doesn't directly mean ""healthy and strong"". Whoever has most children with their genes wins at evolutionary fitness.  There are really only two simple parts to evolution:   Different people have different genes, and Some people are more likely to pass on their genes than others.   These haven't disappeared with human culture and technology. We have changed the fitness function with healthcare, safety regulations, cultural practices, etc. For example, deciding not to have kids to focus on your career is very unfit, regardless of your health. And we may be able to influence gene mixing soon.  But no matter what, human evolution will still continue, because some people will continue having more kids than others, just perhaps in a very different direction than what is usually thought of as evolution for the ""natural world""."
AskScienceDiscussion,38huw1,lehmakook,4,Thu Jun 4 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent answer. Remember that when thinking of evolution, it's important not to think of it as a road with a destination. Evolution occurs in response to adaptations to changes in the environment. Technology is simply another environment modifier until we truly get to the level of mass prenatal genetic modification. It may enable gene mixing and allow more genetic diversity but the ""speed"" of evolution is really beside the point unless technology enables an entirely stagnant environment."
AskScienceDiscussion,38huw1,clessa,2,Thu Jun 4 12:46:19 2015 UTC,"I am not a scientist so someone that is can probably give you a better answer, but until then... My understanding is that if selection from survival isn't much of an issue there are a couple of examples we can look at. One is the 'Living fossil', some species fill their niche so well that they haven't changed much for millennia but I imagine you need pressure to stay the same which humans perhaps lack.    The other is the 'Birds of Paradise' where resources are abundant and predation is low and sexual selection goes a little crazy and you end up with amazing mating rituals and brilliant plumage. I'd guess that humans are already a little down this road but it's hard to look at human 'mating rituals' in the same way I'd look at other animals mating rituals.    Another thing to think about is our increasing ability to have a direct hand in our evolution. Think of someone born with Cystic fibrosis a hundred years ago, their genes would have reached a dead end. But if born today, thanks to IVF and other fertility treatments, they can pass their genes on and, to an extent, they can chose which genes they pass on thanks to embryo screening.    Really though it's impossible to say how much more we can evolve and what, if any, direction that evolution will take.  It's always interesting to wonder though."

We are propagating genes associated with CF when without technology that wouldn't have been possible and maybe the disease would affect much fewer people? That' how I look at evolution - getting rid of unfavourable traits but that is just me"
AskScienceDiscussion,38huw1,Smeghead333,3,Thu Jun 4 11:23:53 2015 UTC,"You're using language that reveals a lot of underlying bias that is just flat-out inappropriate.  You talk about ""counterproductive"" or ""how much more can we evolve"".  You are envisioning evolution as a road - we started back there, and we've made it to HERE, but the road continues down THAT way.  Moving in that direction is good, but going back over there is bad.  That's a very common way of envisioning it, but it's totally wrong.  There is no direction.  There is no goal.  There is no way we should be heading.  Evolution is just what happens, whether we think it's the ""right"" thing or not.  You call cystic fibrosis ""unfavorable"", and to us, it obviously is very, very unfavorable.  But to evolution, it's ONLY unfavorable because it prevents people who have it from reproducing.  If our medical technology allowed CF patients to live and reproduce as well as everyone else, then as far as evolution is concerned, it's a perfectly great gene, even if it causes all sorts of suffering!  No, what we're doing is not preventing, or changing, or stopping evolution.  What we are doing with medical and other science is simply altering the exact nature and strength of the selective pressure at work on our population.  Things that used to be selected against - bad eyesight, certain disease alleles, etc - now are no longer selected against.  That's not good or bad.  It just IS.  Perhaps in a few more years or decades or centuries, we'll be able to impose our own set of values on our genes by selective editing or engineering.  That is when we will truly fundamentally change our evolution as a species."

This means on average people who are less intelligent are having more children meaning less intelligent genes are being passed on more.   In this case, natural selection in a form is actually working as genes held by some people make them more likely to have more kids and therefor pass on there genes"
AskScienceDiscussion,38iqly,frnzprf,7,Thu Jun 4 14:12:08 2015 UTC,"I would guess that when most people pull out a percentage, they aren't doing so rigorously, they are just making up a number between 50% and 100% biased towards how sure they actually are. Most people have a preference for simple, round numbers, hence the limited number of values you hear, and it would indeed probably be more precise to say ""about 90% sure"" instead of ""90% sure."" But most people would assume you mean the former in most cases.  The more interesting question (from a mathematical standpoint, at least) is whether (after sufficient thought) you can say that you are exactly x% certain of something. The answer is yes.  Probability can be roughly thought of as a means for determining a fair return on a bet. For example, if you are ""80% sure that Obama will be the next president,"" then you should be willing to make a bet such that if you are correct, each dollar you bet returns $1.25, so that your expected return is (1.25 * 0.8 + 0 * 0.2 = 1 -- exactly the amount of your bet). So, when somebody makes the example statement, they are technically correct if they would be willing to make the given bet (ignoring risk aversion, etc.).  If you are exactly 80% sure, you will take the bet or any more favorable bets. If you are only about 80% sure, your cutoff for what kind of return you are willing to accept may vary a little (e.g., $1.24 is high enough for you, or maybe you won't accept anything below $1.26, etc.)."

For instance: ""We calculate a 95% confidence interval of 9.7 to 9.9 m/s2 for the acceleration due to gravity (g)"", means that if g is NOT between 9.7 to 9.9, then from what we see, data would be skewed to say this 5% of the time."

That means that the ratio of water to the total volume is 0.0012325 : 1. We then need to calculate the radii of two spheres whose volumes have a ratio of 0.9987675.  For formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)(pi)(r3 ). If we take a ratio of two volumes, the (4/3)(pi) cancels out, so we are left with (r_1/r_2)3 = 0.9987675. From this, we can conclude that (r_1/r_2) = 0.9995890.  So what are r_1 and r_2? Well, given the total volume, we solve for (4/3)(pi)(r3 ) = 1,083,200,000,000. From this, we simplify to get (r3 ) = 258,594,951,536, and thus that r = 6371.00 km. (This is the ""volumetric mean radius"" listed on the NASA fact sheet). If (r_1/ r_2) = 0.9995890, then r_1 (the smaller of the two) should be 6368.38 km.

AskScienceDiscussion,38fr3g,dhabs,2,Wed Jun 3 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"They are intimately related phenomena, but not exactly the same.  Let's start with the classification of superconductors, of which there are two (conveniently named Type I and Type II). Type I superconductors will expel all magnetic fields from the material. Magnetic fields cannot penetrate a Type I superconductor at all. If the temperature or the magnetic field strength is raised too high, this expulsion effect will be overwhelmed and the material will suddenly stop superconducting. This is the Meissner effect.  Type II superconductors are a little different. These have two critical temperatures/field strengths (T and H from here on). At low enough T and H, type II superconductors will behave just like type I superconductors. If we raise T or H past the first critical point, instead of suddenly failing like a type I superconductor, the magnetic field will be able to pass through the superconductor through microscopic vortices, but the material will remain superconducting outside of those small vortex regions. This is the ""quantum locking"" or flux pinning effect. If either T or H is raised past a second, higher critical point, this process will also cease and the material will stop superconducting entirely.  There's a nice graphic of these three stages here. The bottom left shows the Meissner effect in action, expelling the magnetic field everywhere. The drawing above that shows quantum locking, where the magnetic field penetrates the material but only in microscopic 'flux tubes,' and is still expelled everywhere else. The top right shows what happens above the highest critical point, where the material stops superconducting altogether."

I've seen quantum locking before on youtube and whatnot but had never heard about the Meißner effect until yesterday)  This question may be rudimentary but; Is there a way to pull current away from a super conductor to drop it's temperature or are the super condensed liquid elements pretty much the only option available now?
AskScienceDiscussion,38fr3g,sticklebat,2,Thu Jun 4 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"Most of the temperature thresholds are really cold as well right?   Yes. Early superconductors could only function at temperatures < 30 K. In contrast, 'high temperature' superconductors can operate at temperatures up to about 138 K (or -135º C). High temperature superconductors were a major advancement, since those temperatures can be reached with liquid nitrogen (low temperature superconductors can only be effectively cooled with liquid Helium).   This question may be rudimentary but; Is there a way to pull current away from a super conductor to drop it's temperature or are the super condensed liquid elements pretty much the only option available now?   I'm not sure what you mean by ""pull current away from a superconductor to drop its temperature."" It is possible to draw electricity from a superconductor, but only if there is already a current stored or being driven through it. This can help you reduce the heat output in extreme scenarios, but it won't really help you cool it down or keep it at low temperature. For that, the only practical means are liquid Helium and Nitrogen.  It's worth noting that superconductors are not really practical for propulsion except on tracks. To use superconductors as a form of propulsion requires an external magnetic field. It would be utterly impractical to magnetize roads, and the Earth's field is far too weak to be useful here."

AskScienceDiscussion,38f2sd,TiagoTiagoT,3,Wed Jun 3 20:06:32 2015 UTC,"To get an idea of what we could expect, we should first look at what makes graphene so interesting, and then see if those properties translate to a layer of ice.   So, firstly the mechanical properties: graphene consists of a huge number of carbon atoms essentially forming a single molecule. Each carbon atom forms three bonds to neighbouring carbon atoms, as well as contributing an electron that is delocalised much as in benzene. This gives it fantastic mechanical strength: in order to break it you have to break apart a vast number of chemical bonds, which requires a lot of energy. In comparison: ice consists of many small molecules, with weak electronic forces acting between molecules. Breaking it is much simpler, as we don't have to break bonds. Score one for graphene.   What about electronic properties? Those delocalised electrons in graphene allow it to conduct electricity almost as well as metals. In ice, although there are electrons that aren't used in bonds, these are still localised and cannot move around. We do have the option of H+ ions tunneling to transport charge, but this process is much slower. Score two to graphene.   Next, thermal conduction. Again the network of carbon atoms allows for thermal energy to be transported around well, giving it great thermal conductivity. In contrast, because it consists of lots of individual molecules ice is a poor conductor of heat, and prefers to melt rather than pass heat along.  Score 3 for graphene.   Okay, what about functionalisation? Graphene consists of a whole bunch of C-C bonds, that are easy to modify in order to allow us to do all sorts of cool stuff. With ice, as soon as we start trying to alter it it stops being ice. Again, the lack of strong bonds means that we lose the ability of neighbouring sites to affect each other meaningfully. That makes it 4-0 for graphene.   We also have other problems. At 'normal' temperatures ice is not stable, and spontaneously melts. That means any ice composites would have to be kept cool at all times which is difficult, particularly if you want to blend it with something that requires heat in order to become usable, such as plastics. Likewise ice is brittle, compared to the relative flexibility of graphene.   So why is graphene so much better than graphite, if we expect a single layer of ice to act much as a bigger chunk of ice would? The answer comes simply from the fact that with graphene we can talk about a single massive molecule, and the properties of that rather than the weaker forces that join molecules together. Graphite is only held together by relatively weak forces joining layers of graphene. Much like a chain being as strong as the weakest link materials are usually only as strong as the weak force holding them together. This is why for example thin sheets of plastic tend not to have great mechanical properties: the weakest force is the one holding together separate polymer chains, which is far weaker than the one holding together the polymer chain.   TL:DR Graphene's properties largely come from its molecular structure, and not from the fact that it is a single atom thick. This behaviour doesn't necessarily translate to other 'thin' materials"

Water consists of at least 3 atoms (2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen).  To be ice, multiple of these molecules must bind together.  Since these molecules combine in at least two configurations I'm pretty sure that 1 atom thick is impossible.  Perhaps you can rephrase the question?"

AskScienceDiscussion,38f2sd,tgosubucks,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"From a purely mechanical perspective, lets look at the hexagonal lattice. Take a benzene molecule (6 carbons). Let's ignore the reactivity trends, and take six molecules of water. As the first commenter stated, this can only happen at very low temperatures. That's why ice forms in the first place, the low temperature retards the atomic motion of electrons/protons. So when they form the polairity experienced between a match up of 12 hydrogen atoms inside and 6 oxygens outside wouldn't cause the the ring to implode. That's why this type of bonding occurs at 0 degrees C.    A better question would be to study the properties of ice and other common materials at 0 kelvin. If all atomic motion stopped, all particle flux would be 0. Which, I hypothesize would make all the materials brittle.    Going back to the mechanical perspective, with a lattice of hexagons the force transfer that occur between particles/molecules/and atoms are delocalized. The main point (which is why air plane windows aren't hexagons) is that corners are stress concentrators. Any perturbation would spread out along the straight line chains, and immediately break at the corners, causing network rupture.    So, to answer your question, cool mechanical/electrical properties of water wouldn't exactly happen because 1) the network would be too weak, or because particle flux would be retarded.     These are all hypotesis, I'm a third year engineering student with no concerted research in any field, i'm just in undergrad, but i'm trying to use the mash up of organic chem, materials science, statics, mechanics, and physics classes i've taken so far. A lot of the things i said might be wrong/right. I don't know, but that's the beauty of science, you can explore an idea to the end, even if your initial assumption is wrong."

Nothing that I am aware of in homeopathy is science, because there have been no homeopathic hypotheses that have survived rigorous scientific studies, so anyone who claims that homeopathy works is not backed up by science.  There is a reason all drugs are tested double-blind, and that is due to the placebo effect.  To do science, you have to separate changes in subjective symptoms due to placebo from changes in subjective symptoms due to actual chemical processes.    There is also the concept of prior probability to consider.  Homeopathic remedies, by definition, have absolutely no active ingredient.  They are just water.

I would like to be conservative and assume that all the previous are normal even for a rational person, and that irrationality starts when one for example starts believing in aliens (or that he has a chance to win in Kino or other lotteries).

Regardless of whether you accept this evidence as truth, it is evidence for Christianity.  OP needs to first justify his claim that people do believe things without any evidence (I would claim that in most cases, they do not, although there could be counterexamples). Even silly things like children believing in Santa and the Tooth Fairy don't count because the children have evidence for those:  their parents told them each was real, and why would parents lie? Of course, this evidence is later discredited, and the children find out that both were lies, but that does not make this an example of belief without evidence.  +1 for the links answering OP's question, though."
AskScienceDiscussion,38enop,Begging4Bacon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"You are coming into my words. The kids do not have good evidence that santa exists, but we often need to believe without evidence what our friends and family say if we are gonna form strong relationships. Someone's claim that he saw Jesus is not a good evidence. A book, even a holy book, is not more valid than a piece of paper where I wrote something out of boredom. Good evidence comes when one tries to prove something wrong and he fails, so he faces 2 options: (i) keep trying, or (ii) accept it as a truth in the absence of a more satisfactory version.  If I go to a court and say that I saw a miracle, I bet that the judge and the jury would not treat what I said as evidence. An evidence is something that is hard to disregard, no matter whether one is Christian or Hindu or whatever. The majority of the world don't accept Jesus' miracles. The majority of the world don't accept Buddha's life. The majority of the world do accept plate tectonics. They tried to dismantle the theory and failed. The majority of the world do believe in some kind of supreme power: they tried to form a personal philosophy without this necessity and failed.  Of course it is exhausting if we act like this 24/7. That's why I tried to be conservative. That said, a large proportion of believers do believe without questioning, while another part of them fabricate their own version that fits them best. This is common in Greece, where each believer has his favorite saint, while even illiterate grandmothers know that earth is at least a couple billion years old. These believers sort of fabricated what they received and the output is a personalised set of beliefs that makes them function better and face challenges. I can't call this irrational.  As for the original question, I think that the social effects of believing something without good evidence are obvious when we see the profile of the most ""successful"" people. They tend to be cynical and don't trust others. I can't connect this to psychological effects.  Psychotic patients seem to love irrational things. Even the best functioning of the patients in the psychotic spectrum seem to at least love spending some minutes daily thinking irrational things. People in manic phases also tend to construct irrational trains of thought but at least they don't love this process. I think that the trend to think irrationally is not the cause but the effect of a psychological condition (although there are counterexamples such as folie à deux).

As for net momentum, what if the array is shaped like a hemisphere (but just slightly less than 180 degrees so the lasers on opposite sides don't hit the device itself)?   There is an action-reaction force that will push the emitters in the outward direction, but if and how they move apart will depend on how you design them. If they're all connected to each other, there will be a radially outward-acting stress on the apparatus, but no net thrust due to spherical symmetry.   In the almost-hemisphere scenario, would the gravity of the blackhole be enough to counter the thrust?

They are not really a solid object, just a variable-sized (depending on mass) region of space from which nothing can escape.  You cannot move them with a pair of pliers or shoot them out of a gun - but you can tow them around using their attraction to any massive object. You can also feed them items with an electric charge and then have a somewhat charged black hole which can be moved (or launched) with electrostatics.  This would let you keep a black hole in a box. See The Hole Man by Larry Niven for a story that uses this as a plot device (hint: storing them near a planet is probably a bad idea).   One major catch that Niven didn't know about is that black holes really should decay through Hawking radiation. The smaller they get, the faster they decay. A one-ton black hole decays in 84 nanoseconds - here, take this - and is very briefly brighter than the sun. A few million tons will give it a useful lifespan, and once it is made you just feed it sacrifices (or any other form of matter) every once in a while and it will return all of the input mass as energy output through Hawking decay.

As to whether that would net an optimal outcome... well it would probably be very difficult to get it right, and given the feedback loop time of months or years, any mistake would likely become serious before it was detected.  A child can be successfully raised in near starvation, but the after-effects will last a lifetime.  As with any topic, it is wrong to conflate ""can I"" with ""should I"".  Extremists in all directions are wrong, or at least that's the way to bet. Balance in all things but diet isn't a life of balance and proponents aside, research suggests that pure veganism isn't particularly beneficial. It's something that people do to ""feel better emotionally"" but it's not well proved in any proper science.  I have yet to see a properly controlled, double-blind study involving vegan and vegetarian diets versus anything else. We just have a bunch of uncorrected and uncontrolled anecdotes.  So just because the child doesn't flounder or die, it doesn't mean that the child reached its full potential.  If vegan-ism was naturally better we'd likely have evolved into herbivores, so evidence is rather circumstantial and slightly ""against"" the persuit."

They are treated as point-like in current theories so the idea of compressibility is somewhat non-nonsensical. They are of the class of particles known as fermions which are the elementary particles which make up matter. When two fundamental fermions come into proximity they interact via fundamental forces. These forces vary as a function of the distance between the particles, and at their fastest propagate at lightspeed, which is a round about way of saying the matter in question is compressible.    Note that bosons (apropos fundamental particles) are the particles that carry the forces. A notable characteristic of bosons is that one can have the same quantum state as another, which effectively means they can occupy the same location in space, so if you press two together they will overlap."

A big part of science is acknowledging and listening to expertise. If someone is alone or almost alone in proposing a theory, they should be treated with skepticism until they are able to convince their peers. It makes claims that seem not philosophical but physical in nature, particular with regard to economics and psychology. Again, I do not have a background in philosophy, but when a philosopher makes a claim that should result in physical evidence (e.g. free market capitalism is superior to other economic systems) then I want to see the evidence that accompanies it. It claims very definite things in terms of metaphysics, which might be in conflict with some findings in physics, particularly in quantum mechanics. Certainly from my understanding of the metaphysics it seems to contradict with elements of QM such as the observer effect.   The other reasons are not evidence based, and instead simply based on the fact that I think aspects of it are wrong and, if implemented, would cause huge damage to individuals and society. I live in a country with socialised healthcare and a reasonably strong social safety net which I think we would be far worse off without.

At the top of your smoke stacks (or perhaps elsewhere in the process) you add scrubbers that collect much of the harmful emissions, SOX, COX, etc, which are then deposited in a geologically inert way.

It's because you are already going the speed of light, along with everything else, and the velocity never changes.  The wrinkle is that you need to understand what the speed of light really is. One of Einstein's big insights was the idea of ""spacetime"". When physicists talk about four-dimensional space, they mean it quite literally. You have three physical dimensions and one time dimension. The speed of the things in the universe is the total velocity of movements through space and time. So when you're at rest relative to something else, your speed in space is zero and your time is maximized. When you're in motion relative to other things, your speed in space increases, but your speed in time (relative to other things) decreases. That's what time dilation is all about. The vector product of your total velocity never changes.  It all starts getting much more complicated than this, because your velocity of motion is always relative to other things, and the energy it takes to increase your physical velocity increases geometrically as you approach the speed of light in the physical dimensions.  But you can see that if there was anything else with a different spacetime velocity, that would undermine a whole lot of everything."

On a planet with higher gravity (Mars is the other way around fyi, weaker gravity than Earth) then you might find toddlers dying to brain injuries when they inevitably trip and fall during play and their heads hit the ground much harder than they would on Earth.  This would directly affect survival and reproduction rates and evolution might eventually compensate with stronger skulls as the strongest skulled toddlers recover from falls at a higher rate.  However this would take a very long time, and it's more likely that humans would compensate by doing things like building toddler safe play areas, raising the age at which kids are allowed to play outside, teaching proper fall techniques to all children;  all of which could prevent evolution from doing anything too drastic about toddler brain injury.  So basically, society and technology could greatly limit how much adaptation would really be required.  However there could be subtle changes favored by evolution.  For instance maybe stronger gravity would cause cardiovascular issues due to pumping blood up against a stronger force.  If this has a significant impact on life expectancy and reproduction rates then we'd likely eventually see cardiovascular adaptations to address this over many generations.  Or maybe the atmosphere on the planet is different enough from Earth's to cause respiratory issues, and new lung adaptations would be favored."
AskScienceDiscussion,384vho,TestiCallSack,14,Mon Jun 1 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"All species are in a process of continuing evolution. Each new generation brings new mutations, and any one of those mutations could potentially evolve into a common trait under the right conditions.   However, for a trait to become common among a species it has to have some kind of advantage in terms of reproduction and survival. So it is correct that with advances in medicine we will have more people alive with weak immune systems, but the people with strong immune systems won't face any kind of disadvantage.   In order for the weak immune system population to outnumber the strong immune system population there would have to be some kind of environmental change that benefited the weak while simultaneously disadvantaging the strong.   In order for a trait to evolve as common to the whole species, it's not enough that those with the trait survive, those without the trait have to also die (or diverge into a different species by evolving other new traits)."

This is false. Drift (stochastic effects) can, with some small but nonzero probability, increase the frequency of neutral and even deleterious variants to fixation in the population. As the other poster mentioned, modern medicine removes the selective effects of what would otherwise be deleterious or beneficial variants, and there are a lot more ways to be deleterious than beneficial."

I disagree. There are many more ways to have a weak immune system than a strong one (think of how many things have to be just right for your immune system to be strong), so random mutations will more often create a weaker immune system than a stronger one. Modern medicine removes the genetic advantage for a strong immune system, so weak immune systems will quickly dominate."

For example, it's so amazingly useful to have a large, plastic brain that we've evolved out into a weird corner where we can barely give birth anymore, because normal variations in head size and infant orientation push right against the survivable limit for getting out of the birth canal.  With advances in pesticides, environmental control, and hygiene, we've lost a lot of resistance to insects and bacteria simply because the tail end of the population isn't chopped off every generation.  Similarly, vaccination has meant that the so-called ""childhood diseases"" aren't trimming out the weaker 1/3 of the population every generation.  So other pressures dominate, like whether each person has an intrinsic desire for a large family.  You can't call evolution ""positive"" or ""negative"", though, unless you also specify a quality that is desired and which the species is evolving toward or away from.  Mostly, evolution just is, without regard to morality or teleological value."

AskScienceDiscussion,384vho,drzowie,2,Tue Jun 2 08:10:02 2015 UTC,"Natural selection just happens.  Free will is just another aspect of the mix.  The whole idea of evolution is that certain traits will be more successful than others over time, and the population itself will adjust over time.  That's it.    Natural selection never ""relied on our primal instincts to selectively reproduce"".  It is a process that only relies on imperfect reproduction with inheritable traits.  Doesn't matter whether the reproducing bodies (people, dogs, robots, bacteria) reproduce selectively or profligately, sexually or asexually, or deliberately or randomly.  Over time, the more successful reproductive/survival strategies will become the dominant strategies across the population, simply because the less successful ones ... didn't make it.  Even a small advantage (conferring, say, a 1% better chance of successful reproduction) will grow from a small sub-population to about 90% of the population in which it arose, in just 230 generations.  That's why the theory of evolution by natural selection is such a bugbear to the religious community: it's an amazingly simple concept, and also amazingly powerful and deep.  It bridges the accidental natural world of physical law to the intentional living world of moral law, including things like the ""natural"" concepts of familial love or private property, with no reference to any kind of deity or other prime intentional power.  It explains the universal traits of life, including the struggle for self-protection and the development of intention, in terms of random chance in the world (coupled with selection) over time.  That is very, very worrisome to people who make their living as generators or arbiters of morality, or who ascribe things like intention or consciousness to supernatural phenomena that they consider to be beyond ordinary physics."

A change of 20 ms in reaction time to some stimulus is unlikely to be of any benefit when another car runs a red light and drives into your side (much more dangerous to you than, say, avoiding a rear-end collision).  You'd also need to show that reaction time is changing over generations as the environment selects for this, which is unlikely to happen given that accurate collection of reaction time data from humans is a relatively new method.   Since more social awkward and stem-minded women are entering the work force, it puts them in close contact with socially awkward and stem-minded males, thus increasing the chances of both reproducing.

I'm no expert on how they're made or how they work, but they are at least possible.  It's also worth noting that magnets will always attract ferromagnetic materials materials that don't have a field of their own, meaning that any metal objects can be ""picked up"" by either pole of a magnetic field. The reason for this is that the electrons within a metal are more freely shared among the atoms in the material than in many other materials. Meaning that when a magnet comes close to the material, the electrons all bunch up either near the magnet or away from it (depending on which magnetic pole is close to the material). This gives the material near the magnet an opposite charge, and the material is attracted to the magnet."

Then, the glider takes off from high in the air, and flies down to a decently far destination and lands.  The only thing requiring power is the motors for the initial lift, and they can probably be powered by solar panels on top of the balloon and batteries under the runway, and the size of the balloon can be increased to counter the heavy solar panels.

Light won't really scatter or collide with other beams of light (at reasonable energy scales, anyway), so without some other effect such points of intersection would be as invisible as the rest of the beams.

Also, searchlights are a continuous spectrum whereas most interesting photon-photon interactions happen at specific frequencies.    You can still get things like interference from a continuous spectrum though."

AskScienceDiscussion,382k5m,jeffrey2ks,9,Mon Jun 1 11:53:09 2015 UTC,"across the plain of space fabric, we come across a cone visualized as a downward cone, representing a large mass, like a planet, a star or even a galaxy, and this gives us a representation of gravity.    I think this is the idea you have in mind? I want to clarify some things:   Space does not bend. Space-time bends. There is no space, there is no time, only spacetime together. What you see as ""up and down"" here is sort of the temporal axis. Since we are talking about space-time, we really can't draw this. We think and see in ""Euclidean geometry"" but even ""flat"" (empty) space follows a slightly more complex geometry (Minkowsky geometry). Most of what you call geometry is ""Euclidean geometry"", but isn't applicable to space-time (the spatial axes are related to each other in a Euclidean way, but time is fundamentally different in how it acts). Hence, there is not such thing in reality as a ""plane of space"" in a very meaningful way. However, since drawing a representation of anything in 4 dimensions is of great difficulty, we often reduce space-time to two spatial directions (the ""plane"" here) and one temporal axis (otherwise it is not space-time) Finally, is this a representation of gravity? Yes/sort of. In this view, gravity loses its status as a force, and is instead curvature of space-time.    So outside of these large dips or cones of the space fabric, what actually suggests that it's a flat plain, free of anamolies until a nice big black hole or star ruins things?    As I said, empty space is often considered ""flat"", yes. It is much simpler to consider such a space than the much more complex geometries near a planet or star. Again, I want to emphasize that this still is not the type of geometry you are used to, because things are ""different"" along the time axis   what if inbetween gravitational cones there are actually upward buldges in the fabric   We would have to ask what creates them. It would be something that purely repels matter- all massive matter. We have no evidence for such an object.   this could be a good visual analogy of what we associate as dark energy no?   The universal expansion occurs everywhere, not just away from universes. Or rather, models where it occurs everywhere have worked so far. If these things only exists ""between things"", then you have a problem with the early universe- there was no ""between"" where it was empty for the expansion to begin, and that part of expansion is the most important (otherwise we never really leave the dense plasma state of the universe).  Additionally, we would expect to see more ""anomalous"" things in the universe. For the most part (certainly not everything *cough Andromeda and the Milky Way *) all objects (galaxies) are receding from one another. With this model, I would expect seeing strange circular patterns where, from the center and going out, we see more galaxies actually approaching one another (the ones closer to the source of these things would be pushed harder).  That said, the ""openness"" and ""closeness"" of the universe is an important question- which I would direct you [here](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe). In short, there is evidence for an overall ""flat"" universe- see the discussion using the CMB to make ""triangles"".   It's very late and I'm very tired, so I was thinking out loud here, but does any of this make sense?    Misconceptions, sure, but pretty understandable ones- this is a very difficult concept to grasp."

A white hole would be observable by looking at distant galaxies, since it would cause a sort of lensing like when looking through a black hole. The difference being a black hole will make the galaxies look smeared out around it, but a white hole would make it more hidden than smeared (you can imagine it diverging most of the light away, whereas a black hole curves more light that you wouldn't see toward you making that galaxy appear to have come from many points, hence smearing).  You can imagine the path of the light being similar to rolling balls at a similarly shaped mound- most just go away from the observer (supposing the mound is between the observer and the source).

AskScienceDiscussion,382k5m,zenthr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:31:06 2015 UTC,"I've been sort of missing showing the trees for the forest if I can make a saying up.  Here's the problem with the lumpy structure itself: It deflects light in a way we would be able to notice very similar to black holes.  Here's the problem with this sort of ""anti-gravity"" force being the course of universal expansion: It can only push stuff to space that exists. This means unless there is only one such structure (how fortunate)- we are going to live in a collision hellscape. Even if there is only one, whatever is closer to the source is accelerating faster than that which is further away, so the former stuff should be approaching some of the latter stuff. We instead see everything (for the most part) moving away from everything).  Here's the big thing it lacks: Actual expansion is not moving into space, it's actually creating more space than there was before. The universe in this model is presumed to be infinite, and always has been. The early universe was entirely filled (in this infinite space) with hot, dense plasma (logically, this is an infinite amount of plasma). Why then are we now not so dense (and therefore much more cool)? Because universal expansion is literally the creation of more ""void"" rather than a small concentration of stuff moving into already existing void. Without creating more void, that plasma would never have expanded, cooled, and become stars and planets.  If you imagine being a part of this process, wherever you are you see yourself cool off first. Then you see an ever increasing volume around you cool off. One important point was the moment where electrical charges became preferentially bound into neutral states (atoms). Before this, you really only saw noise (in terms of photons). You really wouldn't know anything beside your own temperature (based on the distribution of photons hitting your face).   Once you cool enough for your surroundings to become neutral, you want the electric plasma recede about you in all directions. Some free photons from the plasma are left unbound and some reach you from the edge of this transition- this is the observable universe, cooling around you due to the creation of more space. That boundary we still see- it is the source of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as we are just getting word of parts of the universe cooling. into this transition. That cooling, driven by expansion causes the CMB to be literally all around us, rather than in just one direction, from just one or a few (essentially) point sources as that lumpy idea would create."

I'm not sure if I understand what you're trying to say there.        Lemme try explaining more my idea:  Start with a flat waterbed, draw a grid on it. Now place a bunch of small but heavy balls on it; the balls will roll towards each other. But their weight is pushing the water inside, and it needs to go somewhere, in the parts where there are no balls the water can push with less resistance.  Now looking at the waterbed from above, you can see that the grid is tighter around the balls, and stretched where there are no balls.        And I guess to make the analogy closer to reality you need to have the waterbed be made of a weak plastic that slowly stretches more and more; and have the whole thing be tall enough that the balls will not bottom out any time soon."

While you are rubbing the vomit-inducing material in your mouth, or as you are wiping your mouth after you vomit, I drop the pellet(s) into the bowl (presuming they aren't there already).  Indeed it could be in the hand, in the bowl, or on the spoon/utensil used to stir/poke the vomit, or even coughed or spit straight from the mouth of the ""cleric"" into the mass or dropped from the hair as he/she rubs their head or scratches their ear while leaning over the mixture.  The liquid in the vomit causes the pellets to darken and thicken and become visible and obvious.  In this usage I never had to alter the plantain or the water. I only had to pass my hand, tool, or body part near or over the bowl before or after the actual vomiting has been done.

If you are looking on when while your friend is grimacing about the vomit-leaf then you might see the flick of the finger dropping the debris in the bucket or whatever. So no observers! The spirits demand it!  And lets not even start with gimmicks, for instance a bucket handle rigged to drop the particle when the dupe picks it up to place it. Or a little gel tape in the bottom that melts when it gets wet. OR a little regular scotch tape that doesn't stick very well at all like for the toothpick in the inverted water bottle trick.   Heck, have the dupe put the bucket in the magic circle and have an accomplice in the attic drop the particle in the bucket from above.  Have an accomplice with a pea shooter (e.g. a household straw and a mouth) shoot the thing into the bucket from a few feet away while the dupe is puking.   People suck at observation. Change blindness and the piss-poor human visual field create a sense of ""seeing a complete picture"" when you are lucky if you can marshal a filed of view larger than a postage stamp at arms reach with the rest filled in my neurological memory.

A typical example is Maxwell's equations. Another is Newton's first law.   First Postulate (Principle of relativity)   Under transitions between inertial reference frames, the equations of all fundamental laws of physics stay form-invariant, while all the numerical constants entering these equations preserve their values. Thus, if a fundamental physical law is expressed with a mathematical equation in one inertial frame, it must be expressed by an identical equation in any other inertial frame, provided both frames are parameterised with charts of the same type.

And life would aggressively re-evolved algae or something to fill thous huge and inviting ecological spaces.  Algae is actually really interesting stuff. Looking up out of my unwashed skylights I can see some of the scum left by blue-green algae trying to give lichen a foothold on the glass.  It's more or less everywhere so being too specific about what would happen if it went away becomes hard. Such a die-off would have unimaginable consequences in the real sense of the word."

Think of how hard it is to balance a lifelike doll or figurine on its feet. So you'd have to be pretty lucky to be in an actually stable position when turned to stone and not be leaning a tiny bit one way or another."
AskScienceDiscussion,37zpu6,Gnome_de_Plume,2,Sun May 31 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. We're actually not very stable on our feet, we just don't have to think about constantly rebalancing because our brains have been learning our entire lives how to do it without our conscious help."
AskScienceDiscussion,37zpu6,AnecdotallyExtant,2,Mon Jun 1 02:03:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on exactly how they are standing. If your center of gravity is over your feet and your momentum is pretty much at rest you'd remain standing. The further your feet are apart, within reason, and the more variance to the direction of your toes, and the flatter your feet are resting, the less likely you are to topple over by secondary forces or circumstances.  So, for instance, standing ""at attention"" is okay. Standing ""on pointe"" is not stable at all. Some martial arts ready pose are very stable.  What you were actually doing, and the question of whether your clothes and accessories turn to stone with your body are also rather important.  So consider Medusa's lair. Most of those should be naked stone statues covered with clothes (as opposed to statues of well dressed people) that are lying fallen and possibly broken. A good number wold be down on three points of contact (two feet and a hand on a wall or floor for example). This pivots on the part of the ""creeping or charging through the ancient temple of evil"" effect. The likelihood of Medusa catching everyone flat-footed and stable is low."

Ancient greek sculptors faced a real challenge in not having statues' ankles shear off. Of course, their problems were most significant with giant humans, but marble is a strong stone. A human figure must be fairly well balanced and supported, and made of a sturdy, relatively flawless piece of stone to not break under its own weight. Even then, just moving or tapping the figure can be enough to cause failure at the ankles  That said, most forms of stone have plenty of strength to support a human shape, it's just a question of whether the person is posed correctly, if the stone has any flaws, if there are any lateral loads to the head (E.g. wind), etc. etc."

The rat learns this very well. Now i stop doing the lever tests and leave the rat alone. I start slowly shifting all the blue objects to red in his cage, and all the red objects to blue. maybe he has a blue cube by his nest, and a red pyramid by his food bowl. they never move, they just slowly shift color- slow enough for him not to notice. During this time, hes not doign the lever game, so im not reinforcing any new kind of identification- he still thinks left lever means ""blue square"" and right lever means ""red square"" (even though he hasnt played the game in a while.  After ive totally gone through the change in his enviroment, i give him the lever game. I show him what i percieve as a blue square (and what he would have said was a blue square before). On his first round of the test, before any reinforcements affect his descicions, will he label the square as blue or red? he used to say it was blue, but now ive switched all the colors in his world around, so blue and red are inverted. maybe this switches his labels- maybe since the blue cube by his house hasnt moved, and he used to see it as the same color as the color that would make him press the left lever, maybe now that the cube has slowly turned a different shade, maybe he thinks that new shade is blue.  basically, maybe he would now press the left lever for  what i still see as a red square, and the right lever for what i see (and have always seen) as a red square- he switched the labels of blue and red without even knowing it."

So a brightly colored male bird expresses genes for pigmentation that are just different from the female's genes for drab pigmentation. In humans males have the same genes for sex organs as females, it's just hormonal differences during development that will decide if the embryo will develop testes or ovaries. So greater dimorphism would not really predict more genetic information, just a higher degree of differentiation in the genetic information being expressed."
AskScienceDiscussion,37zdwn,AnecdotallyExtant,2,Sun May 31 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Most of the genes responsible for sexual dimorphism aren't located on the X or the Y.  The SRY gene on the Y chromosome acts as sort of a ""master switch"" for turning on maleness (in mammals, that is. Other animals have different systems).  This starts a cascade of signals that ends up turning on and off various genes that are scattered all over the genome.  The system is sophisticated enough that you don't really need to lump the relevant genes on the one chromosome.  In fact, this is arguably one reason why the Y is so small.  You only really need the one master switch gene on the Y chromosome.  Everything else is free to wander off."

HIV obtained from a transfusion is clearly not a sexually transmitted infection in that instance. That person is infected, but it wasn't through sexual contact. However because that infection is usually spread sexually, people will still call HIV it self an STI/STD.  An extremely good example of this is molluscum contagiosum. It can be spread sexually, but often is also spread just through contact.

I took that to mean genital HSV1 was an STI but oral HSV1 was not an STI however you corrected me by saying ""no"".  Remember the whole reason I started this question is because someone with scientific knowledge said that science classified HSV1 a certain way (they actually said ""This is where the definitions come from. There is a lot of literature on this.""  So far what I've gotten from this post is that there is not scientific agreement on the definition of STI/STD and it really depends on a person's perception.    Terri Warren, who specializes in STDs/STIs and specifically HSV, classifies oral HSV1 as a STI.   ""A WORD ABOUT ORAL HERPES: Because oral herpes can be transmitted to a sexual partner through giving oral sex and is then, technically, a sexually transmitted infection, it is appropriate that it be discussed briefly in this book. "" http://www.westoverheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Updated-Herpes-Book.pdf   Yet, WHO classifies only HSV2 as an STI. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/  And CDC classifies only genital herpes (regardless of which type of HSV) as an STI. http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes.htm  And the University of Missouri classifies HSV1 as an STI with no mention of its location. https://studenthealth.missouri.edu/programs/shape/docs/Sexually%20Transmitted%20Infections.pdf  I know you think I'm being dogmatic and concerned with terminology but you are being entirely unclear.  It has to be one of these options:   Yes, it is always an STI Yes, it is an STI only when present on the genitals Yes, it is an STI only when transmitted sexually (which is the same as above, unless I'm missing something) No, it is never an STI   Of course, it sounds like it is most likely:   It depends on who you talk to"

Scientific literature (that is worth reading) will center on the pathology and other behaviors of the virus and won't dither about the STI/STD distinction.   tl;dr: 100 scientific papers that refer to HSV1/HSV2 as STIs would probably all be wrong, as the correct term for a thing is not a testable hypothesis"

AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,svipdag_DM,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"The thing you're missing is that STI is essentially an epidemiological term.   Anything can be an STI if it spreads due to sex. The reason anyone cares is because you can track the spread of STIs in a population and because you know they spread through sex, you can try to stop the spread by doing things like educating kids about condoms, marketing cures to sexually active people, etc.   On the other hand, for example in China there was a huge scandal related to a bunch of HIV cases arising due to blood transfusions. An epidemiologist would not call any of those cases ""STIs"" because they weren't transmitted via sex, even though the disease is often spread as an STI.  It doesn't matter if you have herpes on your genitals or your face, what matters is how it got there. If you got it on your face from blowing a guy, it's an STI. If you got it on your downstairs mixup from accidentally dropping a vial of it onto your junk, then it isn't an STI.  Now, are you interested in whether it can be spread during sexual intercourse?

AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Felonessthrowaway2,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:55:39 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason this came up was because of this comment:   You don't have an STD, unless she went down on you while she had the cold sore. The STD is genital herpes, and it is different than oral herpes on the lips. Well it is the same virus, either HSV-1 or HSV-2, but getting it on your lips is WAY better than getting it on your penis. Also HSV-1 (the kind typically found on cold sores on the lips) doesn't really ""like"" the genital areas as much as HSV-2 (the typical genital variant of herpes.) You shouldn't be too worried, as it sounds like you don't have an STD and you probably only have it on your lips.   Why is there a stigma about HSV being better orally than genitally?  Basically the same virus.  Basically the same symptoms.  Both viruses can take up residence in either location.  There is a rise in the number of genital HSV1 infections from oral sex (30-50% of new genital herpes infections are from HSV1).   It doesn't matter if you have herpes on your genitals or your face, what matters is how it got there.   This I don't get.  Someone with oral HSV2 has to disclose they have an STI but someone who has oral HSV1 does not (even though they've given someone genital HSV1)??  Furthermore, someone with HIV doesn't have to disclose they have an STI because they got it from a blood transfusion?"
AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Syphon8,2,Mon Jun 1 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"Ok I think we're getting to the root issue here. You (or someone) is disclosing STIs as part of a process somewhere.   I can't say why legal or professional groups require you to disclose STIs according to certain metrics. Each process will have their own definition of ""STI"" which might include HIV, genital herpes, etc.   The probable reason for defining things in this (technically incorrect way) is that patients generally lie about having STDs, because as you say, there is a strong social stigma against having one (because maybe talking about herpes makes you less desirable as a sexual partner, so your primate brain says ""no no no, lie to your doctor about it""). So instead institutions just ask ""do you have HPV/HIV/HSV/etc"" in the hopes that they'll elicit a more honest response.   So just to clarify,    Someone with oral HSV2 has to disclose they have an STI but someone who has oral HSV1 does not (even though they've given someone genital HSV1)?? Furthermore, someone with HIV doesn't have to disclose they have an STI because they got it from a blood transfusion?   This is not what I or /u/GoThirdParty were saying. Whether you need to disclose a particular disease as an ""STI"" or not depends on legal, not scientific, issues.   If you're about to enter a porn shoot, for example, they don't really want to know if you have an STI, they want to know if you might spread an STI to someone else, in which case anything that might become an STI would need to be disclosed. That means HIV, HPV, HSV on mouth or genitals, etc etc etc. even if you got HIV from a blood bag.   But again, without knowing why you're disclosing this info, I can't really say what is required or why."
AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Syphon8,2,Mon Jun 1 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you for sticking with me this far.  I agree there are legal, ethical, and scientific differences in how one approaches a particular infection.    I've read through almost every state's statute on STI/STD disclosure.  Some of them say the genital herpes must be disclosed but do not mention that oral herpes should or should not be disclosed.  So if someone with oral HSV1 knowingly infected someone else with genital HSV1 then they did not act illegally.  From an ethical standpoint, one could say that they were free of STIs but still need to disclose they have oral HSV1 prior to oral sex since there is a non-zero risk of that person acquiring genital herpes.  Some people disagree on this and this tends to be an issue in /r/relationships and /r/sex (e.g. a person gets genital herpes in a long term relationship then accuses the other partner of cheating even though the genital herpes might have likely come from oral sex because the person got cold sores as a kid but hasn't had an outbreak in a long time).  I frequently get down voted when I point out that most people have HSV1 and 30-50% of new genital herpes infections are from HSV1 through oral sex.  My particular question here was a result of a reddit post in which someone said they got an STD and someone else pointed out they only got HSV1, not the STD kind (""getting it on your lips is WAY better than getting it on your penis"") though that person made no mention of whether they had an oral or genital infection.    Then someone with some scientific knowledge basically said there was ""a lot of literature on this"" (this, meaning that HSV1 is usually located in the trigeminal nerve and is usually not sexually transmitted and therefore HSV1 is not an STD).  This person refused to provide any of this ""literature"" that allegedly discusses why certain viruses are classified scientifically as STDs and others aren't.   It sounds like science classifies pathogens as STIs/STDs based on how it was transmitted (past tense) rather than how it could be transmitted, which is why some people classify HSV1 as an STI.  And science's classification may be different than the legal or ethical perspectives.   I'm okay with the ethical ambiguity of whether HSV1 is or isn't an STI.  I'm not okay with people saying that science tells us certain things then fail to support their claims with scientific evidence."
AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Felonessthrowaway2,2,Mon Jun 1 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, ok. Yes that makes sense.   Ethically, yes, I agree, even if you got HIV from a blood bag you really need to tell your partner. And you're right to point out the risk of HSV1 to transmit to genitalia, I'm not a doctor but WebMD says it can transmit mouth-to-genitals so I'd think it's totally worth mentioning to your partner.   The ""reddit scientist"" you're referring to could be lying, or they could be referring to the wealth of knowledge studying HSV-1's tendency to not be sexually transmitted. It looks like that info is outdated but the point is, they might not be just making stuff up, apparently for a long time HSV-1 oral-genital transmission was unknown so there are probably studies supporting that claim. They are correct to assert that there are transmissive and pathological differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2, as well.   But yeah, I mean anything that can be vectored through sex acts is potentially an STI, that's what the word means. I don't think scientific literature will generally prove or disprove HSV-1 as an STI in any particular case, the only thing I could imagine would be a landmark study showing that HSV-1 never transmits sexually, which of course is A. impossible and B. goes against established knowledge."

Key messages of the review:   Combining data from cross sectional studies shows a positive association between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infec- tion. However, this association is likely to be erroneous because of confounding Conversely, combining data from prospective studies show a trend towards a protective effect for previous HSV-1 infection against infection with HSV-2 The relation between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection is not clearcut with large interstudy variation"

It is impossible to give HSV a single umbrella transmission category for many socio-epidemiological reasons. If you acquired it through sex, it's sexually acquired herpes. If you acquired it socially or vertically, it's not."
AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Felonessthrowaway2,0,Mon Jun 1 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"Just a thought that isn't Scientific but might add something to the discussion because I think I kind of know what the motive is behind asking the initial question:  When talking about STDs, to people around you and to doctors, we  need to ask ourselves why we are labeling certain things STDs.   When talking to potential partners we label things STDs because we want to communicate what infections/diseases are transmitted via sexual contact.   Now we can argue that colds or the flu could be spread by sexual contact but most people want to communicate about infections/diseases that have a direct effect on the genitals or have a direct effect on ones sexual life in order for them to be discussed as STDs.  There is an argument in this thread that says the ""T"" stands for transmitted rather then transmittable. Meaning that science only cares about how the infection/disease is transmitted rather then how it can be transmitted.  I have a problem with this line of reasoning.  It adds to the stigma of STDs because it's focusing on how someone is infected. Does it matter to potential partners how someone is infected? Maybe on a superficial level that quite honestly isn't anyone's business. It's the same way I feel about the number of partners someone has had. The information does not effect future partners and their health. When disclosing STDs it doesn't and shouldn't matter how you were infected.  The whole point of discussing STDs with a potential partner is to find out what things each partner should be aware of and the risk or transmission to each other. Having the ""T"" stand only for transmitted does a disservice to people by not communicating risks of TRANSMISSION."
AskScienceDiscussion,37z86n,Syphon8,-3,Mon Jun 1 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"Infections clear up if treated, most viruses (and other diseases) once systemic, do not. It's an STD, more than an STI.

AskScienceDiscussion,37wxot,erinn1986,27,Sun May 31 02:15:06 2015 UTC,"One thing to talk about may be the enormous extent of study that has gone into our understanding of theories like evolution or the big bang. I notice that a lot of people who deny such theories seem to think they are just cute ideas that a few scientists came up with and the media and pop culture jumped on and spread. Such people have a tendency to not realize that these models have been tested and refined by thousands (even millions) of very highly educated people over the course of many, many decades... or over more than one and a half centuries in the case of evolution. Entire careers have been spent on developing, testing and refining every aspect of the models, and while human error and even hoax naturally finds its way in now and then, it's the very nature of the scientific method to explicitly try to disprove itself. That's how it moves forward. We reach a point, like we are now with evolution, where so many scientists, countless teams of them, have tried their very hardest to disprove it, to find flaws and fallacies within the model, and to offer better explanations wherever they find them.   The other thing some people neglect to realize is how theories like evolution and big bang don't exist in a vacuum. The reason they are so powerful is because the concepts in them ripple across countless other fields of science. Someone makes a discovery about a particular aspect of say, big bang theory, and all of a sudden pieces fall into place in fields that are even just distantly related to big bang theory. That works both ways too, discoveries in other fields funnel into the big bang models and basically support them with lots of circumstantial evidence.   Try your husband with a copy of Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything. It's a really fun read so he won't get bored. More importantly it illustrates the breadth and depth of how scientific models come about, showing how discoveries spread and build across so many individuals and teams. It also covers, well, almost everything, so it demonstrates very well how all the fields of science interweave and how nothing exists in a vacuum.  Hope that helps."

AskScienceDiscussion,37wxot,i_invented_the_ipod,9,Sun May 31 09:30:39 2015 UTC,"One pretty important starting point is understanding what a theory is. Scientists don't use that word the same way it's used in everyday speech.  In casual conversation, people use ""I have a theory"" to mean something like ""I have a guess"", or ""I have a hunch"".  In science terminology, a Theory is an explanation for some part of the natural world which is precise, well-supported by the experimental evidence, and which makes testable predictions about other observable effects. Notably, this almost always means there will be math - if your ""theory"" doesn't include some equations which you can fit experimental data into for verification, then it's probably not precisely-stated enough to actually be a Theory.  This is why the Big Bang Theory is a Theory - it's precisely-stated, it is supported by mountains of experimental evidence (the Hubble constant, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and other observations), and it makes predictions that can be tested.  Another common misconception is that Theories are unproven, and Laws are proven facts. Scientific Theories and Laws are totally-different things. A Theory doesn't ""graduate"" into becoming a Law because it's been ""proven"".  A law is just a formalized statement, based on repeated observation, which describes how something in the natural world acts. An important difference between Laws and Theories is that a Law doesn't make any attempt to explain why something is true, it just states that it is true.  Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that's directly proportional to the sum of their masses, and inversely-proportional to the square of their distance. But it doesn't say why those objects attract each other - maybe they're just lonely? (It's not loneliness, see below)  The General Theory of Relativity tells us that objects are attracted to each other because they distort the shape of space-time in their vicinity. This leads to the same result as Newton's Law, but it additionally predicts a whole bunch of other effects (gravitational lensing, redshift, time dilation, etc), which were also found to be true when experiments were later devised to test them."

But this wouldn't work, there are several things that could have happened: Abducted, run away, lost and injured...

AskScienceDiscussion,37wxot,lindypenguin,2,Sun May 31 09:26:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of the suggestions here involve books and learning techniques but they still all eventually come down to ""I'm trusting an authority"". The best way I think one should learn science is through experimentation.  One doesn't get a feel for ""this gels with what I know about reality"" vs. ""this sounds like time cube 2.0"" without having a solid basis in knowing what you can verify if you absolutely had to.  Why do astronomers really believe in the big bang theory?  It's not just because someone else told them about it.  It's because they fundamentally trust the various instruments they work with (because they have verified that they and others all seen to repeatedly get the same results when using them in certain ways) and they can visualize doing the experiment that the other person had done.  They know that if there was some chicanery, they'd eventually need to confront it because either they're own or someone else's data is not going to match.  The rest is faith that the same educational system that instilled such rigor and scientific curiosity in them is going to do the same for other fields...  hence why I as an engineer believe what biologists tell me.  I have done some basic experiments.  I have seen cells under a microscope.  I've seen chemical composition tests.  I can believe what biologists needed to do to create gene libraries.  I've done crystallography...  Admittedly not on DNA...  but I believe it can work.  Hence I trust the various properties of DNA I hear about. Etc. Etc. Etc.  Get your husband to do experiments at a high school science level or perhaps enroll in a college intro physics lab.  Knowing about the red shifting of Fraunhauffer lines in stars is one thing.  Seeing the emission spectrum of hydrogen and Hg and An and He and Ne, seeing interference fringes in Young's double slit experiment and then knowing the details of Michaelson Morley experiment leads you to really really believe special relativity as the way reality is.  After that, seeing Hubble's result on doppler shifting is enough to make you think that the big bang theory might have something going for it.  Then after all this, you can read a book on the evidence behind the big bang and see how every study, every experiment, every result simply builds and builds and builds on things that you know are absolutely true and you are left with very little doubt as to what reality really looks like."

Schools, the media and many advocates of science present it as didactic facts delivered by authorities and musty tomes (which describes most textbooks) that can be overturned by mavericks fighting against 'the establishment'.   My feeling is that the best way to learn science is not to learn the facts, but rather to improve one's own ability to recognise bullshit. In this mode I recommend two books:  Bad Science, by Ben Goldacre  (which talks about phony alternative therapies, dodgy pharmaceutical companies obscuring results and common media tropes in science reporting - it's also worth noting that Goldacre has a number of excellent presentations and interviews on YouTube) and  Nonsense on Stilts by Massimo Pigliucci (which does a bit of philosophy of science and charts the boundary between science and pseudo-science, saying some rather unkind things about evolutionary psychology on the way)."
AskScienceDiscussion,37wxot,letfireraindown,2,Sun May 31 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Start Here: We developed, in popular culture, the idea that ""theory"" is bad. The actual root of that is the saying ""that's just your theory"". The thing is that it's the ""just your"" that's the insult.  Theory, in science, is a collective noun. A lot of people will talk about theory having involved proof or whatnot, but they are incorrect. ""Well established theories"" have bodies of evidence, and not well established or novel theories do not. It's a language trap.  So in science ""A Law"" is an equation or a tautology of the form ""if X then always Y"". Before we understood planets and orbital mechanics and stuff ""what goes up must come down"" was more-or-less ""a law of gravity"".  So ""a theory"" is a collection. It consists of all the assumptions (axioms and postulates), laws (covered above), things we know we are guessing, parts of the problem we know we don't understand, ""good"" data, and, indeed, ""problematic"" data. Theories even contain their ""unanswered questions"".  So The Theory of Gravity, includes all sorts of things. Newton's Laws, Kepler's Laws, the fact that we don't really know how it works, and all sorts of stuff. So the invocation of ""the law of gravity"", as spoken by some sorts, is just not a real thing.  Science itself isn't a thing, nor a list of facts, it is a method. It's an organized system for asking questions and its designed to attack itself.  Science is, in shortest terms, the discipline of asking ""how might I be wrong"" at every turn of every screw.  The difference between science and all things that came before can be taken up with the ghosts question.  Without Science: I think my house is haunted, can you come find the ghost?  With Science: I think my house is haunted, can you come show me why I am wrong?  To survive, a scientific idea must ""repel all boarders"". It must stand up to all alternatives available and defeat them by being more correct than the alternatives.  So for the Big Bang, an idea that most people don't even get right even if they ""believe in it"", there was the ""what if"" stage and then the ""come at me bro"" stage. And no idea in science ever gets out of the ""come at me bro"" stage.  So some people came up with the idea of sudden emergence, and someone who thougt that was a horrible idea sarcastically described it as ""a big bang"". The term ""big bang"" was supposed to be an insult. But despite all those attacks the idea survives as no better idea has been able to displace it as king of that mountain. And every day people do try to attack it. It's literally their job to try to defeat the idea of the big bang.  So the thing you need to get your husband to understand is that if it's science its ideas that have withstood attack by means of math and evidence and trial by intellectual combat and overwhelmingly survived.  Ghosts survive trial by combat ""of a sort"", but it's the sort where people simply refuse to admit they lost. So to for the flat earth and ""vaccine injury"" and any number of things that catch the fringe of rationality and will not let go.  So Ideas are not Science. The Big Bang is not science. Dinosaurs are not science.  Ideas must survive Science to be considered scientific.  Science is a gauntlet of intellectual combat that an idea is subjected to. And once an idea enters the ring it may never leave except via utter defeat. There is nothing is science that is beyond reproach.  But you don't just go rushing up to Newtonian Gravity unless you have the chops of General Relativity.  Lots of people wearing cracked pots for helmets (hence the ""crackpot"" reference from ancient traditions of combat carried into intellectual foray 8-) brandishing mud balls of ideas try to take on the giants. And they get squashed.  Science is not a place for the weak of mind or the casual construct of stoners. It's combat to the death."

AskScienceDiscussion,37waig,WazWaz,5,Sun May 31 00:13:05 2015 UTC,"Space exploration is incredibly important.  Let me explain why.  Firstly the challenges that we face on earth, There are 7.125 billion (as of 2014) people that need looking after. That is a stupendous amount of food and materials. At this point in time we are using earth to 1.5X its capacity (http://www.wwf.org.uk/about_wwf/press_centre/?unewsid=6783)  and that is not sustainable in any way.   The climate is also a huge challenge that we have given ourselves. We invented fire and then fast forward a few years and we are digging up black sludge to burn to keep our lights on. The irony here being if we had not discovered fossil fuels you and I would not be sat at computers having this discussion and we would have no space exploration or even half the knowledge that we have today. We would be sat in animals skins talking about how nice the berries are over in that hedge.  Finally, the dangers of being on a rock floating though space. The problem we have on a larger scale is that we are in a galactic sized game of Pool. There are rocks and all sorts floating about out there and one day one of them is going to hit us. This, is something of an issue.  So these are just 3 issues that popped into my head for wanting to explore space. But there is all so the fun reasons: Whats over that hill? We want to see whats around the next corner, we want to see what weird stuff is out there and we want to leave footprints in barren waste lands (I'm looking at you Mars).  Space exploration can help us by solving these problems. Materials that we need to stay on earth can be found in abundance in asteroids and other planets if we can mine them. And then it could become a self sustaining plan, you can go further by using materials you find on the next rock.  We can also spread ourselves out to avoid the race dying from a planetary disaster. Colonising other bodies in space is like having an off world back up, if one goes down thats alright, I have a back up! It might be a bit miserable to think like this but if you want humans to survive we will have to deal with loosing earth one day and become space nomads.  Then there is the science of it all, the real meat and potatoes. Its taken us 100,000 years of looking up Earths skirt to find out what makes her tick, and like all ladies even that is still a mystery. So imagine how much we could learn from a whole new world if we started with todays technology and skills, we wouldn't have to start from scratch, we'd know what to look for and how to find it with out all the tedious messing about with, you know, discovering fire first. I find knowledge has exponential growth, the more you know the faster you can find something new.   The problem here is that we have evolved to work with Earth and not, say, Mars. Our bones and muscles are made for the gravity here, our skin is used to the sun and our bodies can only worked between certain temperature extremes. We can find lots of planets to go to but no one wants to live on a rock that makes your arms feel like they weight 4 tons. And if we do find lots of different places to live, given enough time would people bodies start to change to meet conditions of a new world? Could we start branching off from each other and becoming something other than human? We could in theory seed the galaxy with life that evolves form us (big thinking there).  The second problem is space itself. A quote to sum this issue up:   ""Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.""  Everything is an inconvenient distance away from us, we are in a galactic back water, just to the left of the middle of nowhere. Its taken a small satellite 37 years just to leave our street, and there is a whole country out there to explore. So first, lets just step out the front door and see where our feet take us."

AskScienceDiscussion,37xeuh,s016328,2,Sun May 31 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Your best bet for broad topics that are well known is to find a recent review that covers some related topic, or to find a book that is used as a primary source in the field, either of those sources will contain the citations you need. So if you find a review on a related topic, then find a sentence that covers your info, you can look at the work that was cited by those authors and dig up the cited article. It will probably be citable for you as well, and will likely be the same paper that most people will cite for the same info. So another good strategy is to look for classic papers that have been cited thousands of times. The most important thing is that the info you need a citation for is in the paper you're citing. So if you find a review that contains the info, but for whatever reason can't read the paper it cites (usually because of a paywall or because it's just never been digitized), then it's best to cite the review itself.

AskScienceDiscussion,37xttn,quasi_psychopath,6,Sun May 31 08:17:13 2015 UTC,"As objective as other emotions. Very useful for certain species survival, e.g. in humans mother-child bond. Continue here for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_basis_of_love"
AskScienceDiscussion,37xttn,xTriton,2,Sun May 31 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"Is it truly an option in most species to love another in a romantic sense?        I can tell you that with this question the answer is no. The vast majority of species don't form pair-bonds. If the question was ""Is it an option in some species?"", then the answer is yes! In some species it's absolutely necessary for successful reproduction, and at least the mammals that have that option are probably having a very similar emotional experience to us. Their pair-bonding rituals activate the same kinds of neurotransmitters and pleasure centers in the brain. So most do not love, but those that do probably love just like we do (if not more).          Does it exist in an objective sense?         That really depends on how you want to define love. If you want to define it in the romanticized sense that we're taught through stories and culture, where two people fall in love and never fall out of it, then the answer is a guarded yes. But it may be rare. The human mating system is really fuzzy because we have cultural constraints that vary widely, but it seems that largely we would be best called serial-monogamists, meaning that if left to their own devices and not constrained by culture or child-rearing or some other external factor, most people would fall in love with a few different people in their lifetime. But that doesn't make it any less real. Ultimately everything you experience is your brain taking in signals from the world around itself and trying to make sense of things. In the case of very powerful emotions like love your brain has a massive response; so big that the emotions can overwhelm you in the short term, and permanently alter your brain in the long term. So I guess the answer is that love is what you want it to be. Either it's just brain chemistry tricking you into raising children with another capable person. Or it's an extremely powerful emotional attachment to the person you've chosen to spend your life with that will enrich both of your lives and bring you the most joy knowable for as long as you mutually decide to let it. It really is both at once."

AskScienceDiscussion,37w9v7,benoit_couilles,3,Sat May 30 22:47:20 2015 UTC,"I can answer part of your question: it is thought that early in Earth's history, it was impacted by a Mars-sized planet called Theia. This collision was a glancing blow to the Earth and ended up forming the Moon. As a result of this impact, the Earth spun up to about a 5 hour day and has been slowing down ever since, due to tidal interaction with the Moon.  EDIT: BTW, this occurred 4.5 billion years ago, only a few tens of million years after the Earth actually formed. So the answer to your question (and Dr. Dino's hypothesis) is no, there's was never a point in the history of Earth's formation where it was spinning too fast for gravity to hold things together (because how would it have formed in the first place then?).  There's a good Wikipedia section related to your question actually. The centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation (that force which is counteracting gravity) is about 1/289th of the Earth's gravity. This force increases with the square of the speed you are rotating. This means that the Earth would have to spin 17 times faster than it is today for gravity to be fully counteracted at the surface.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force_%28rotating_reference_frame%29#Earth  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis"
AskScienceDiscussion,37w9v7,jmint52,2,Sun May 31 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"There is, by definition, some rotational speed that would cause structural failure. What that exact speed is a second question. What energy source and means of delivery would cause such an increase in speed is a third and largely unassailable question in turn.  As for the creationist assertions about rotation and dinosaurs... its not even close enough to correct to be considered ""wrong"".   It's wrong because they haven't done any math. They don't really understand how short sixty-five million years is in the four-billion year history of the earth. They don't know how fast, nor why the earth is slowing. The average creationist probably can't recite nor explain the conservation of momentum or the log-curve along which a flywheel slows compared to the energy it is said to contain.  The argument you are trying to reconcile is based on impossibilities and ignorance so it cannot be resolved as stipulated by the creationists.  Now as to:   Could the earth have a speed at which it could form in the way it did but not allow gravity to hold relatively light objects to its surface   No. The earth formed by the accretion of dust and other ""light objects"". So ""the way it formed"" is literally antithetical to the idea that it would be casting off ""relatively light objects"".  Think of it this way. Picture it if you will. There is a cloud of dust and debris and a nucleation core. The things closer to the sun are moving slower than the things further from the sun. As each thing arrives and sticks to the core it either pushes the sunward side one way (e.g. to slow that side) or the anti-sunward side the other (e.g. to speed that side up). Thus the classic whirlpool like you see near any drain. So by definition the max speed of the planet is the max action of that whirlpool. And whirlpools do not throw things outward, if they did they'd disrupt themselves. So the maximum speed of the earth must be slow enough to hold down all of what went into making the earth by definition.  Now there was a likely period when the earth had not yet actually formed where it was basically an amorphous mass of dust in orbit around its common center of gravity. And after that there was probably a lot of stuff in orbit around the tiny starter-ball of earth that would eventually fall to earth as earth's density increased because of other accretion. But again... whirlpool. That's just a delay of arrival  Even today some light objects, those being individual molecules of air from the atmosphere and such, surround and orbit the earth. They are moving fast enough that at their altitude their net vector keeps them from falling back to earth. And there are some atmospheric molecules being shed into space. This is called having a reducing atmosphere and we believe the moon has a lot to do with that.  Speed of rotation and radius are all still in force. Spin a rock on a rope. The longer the rope the harder it is to hold the rock for a given number of RPM.   The creationist argument you mention is flawed for, among other things, presuming the earth is a single uniform rock and that magnitudes that confound the casual observer must also confound some pretty simple math.  To give you an aside that may help you deal... ""Can god make a rock so big that even he can't lift it?"" is a classical philosophical question. It was the deep thought of its age. But from a purely rational perspective the mechanical minded would first ask ""what is he lifting it away from?"" with the full knowledge that that other thing would have to dwarf the rock at issue for the question to be meaningful. So you'd have to re-cast the question as ""can god create to objects so massive that even he cannot separate them?"" but then the mechanically minded must ask ""how are the keeping themselves distinct to begin with?"" and ""what kind of time are we giving god to accomplish the task?"" and so on, and so on.  It is super easy to form a question or name a set based on impossibilities. ""what if I had a proton going faster than light"" for instance. And a competent scientist could cray out some analysis as a pure ""thought experiment"" and describe potential outcomes. But that wouldn't then make the question ""correct"" nor make the outcomes possible.  So its common for people like creationists, or anti-vaxxers, or flat earthers to propose a scenario with the aural cadence and general format of science. That is to ask or propose something that feels all sciencee to you.  But your first job is to figure out whether the question or assertion itself is actually reasonable.  The thing about the earth spinning too fast for the dinosaurs to hang on is a prime example of drawing a conclusion from a set of things that sounded like science but was just imagination and bias."

The brain doesn't look at and remember a face, it looks at the various shapes and distances between features and remembers those. The artist who draws the whacky face may make someone's ears really large and their teeth horse like. These features are what stand out and by exaggerating them your brain picks up on it and you identify the person in the drawing even though their other drawn features lack anything distinguishing.   This is pretty much what's happening in the photo you posted. Putin has very slender cheeks and eyes that are close together and small and he's often depicted almost expressionless and hard which are all of the features that the animal is also exhibiting."

AskScienceDiscussion,37rrda,zynix,3,Fri May 29 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"Economy isn't bounded by efficiency, it's bounded by necessity.  So the question of the time is how badly do we need the gasoline and what, if anything, are the alternatives.  At some point all ""manufactured fuel"" stops being a true fuel and becomes an intermediate storage device. For instance ""hydrogen"" isn't ever going to be a ""fuel"" because we have to make the fuel out of stuff at a net loss of energy.  Wood is a fuel because we don't have to make the wood. Something does make the wood, but it's not material to our process. Something else also made the oil and the gas and the coal we dig up.  So gasoline is actually a really good energy storage medium. It caries a lot of bang per unit mass and its relatively safe.  So as naturally occurring petroleum gets more rare, and if we shift to largely electrical systems, we could easily reach a point where there are a few tasks still best done with gasoline but nobody in the business of drilling for and refining the stuff. At that point the necessity cost could pass above the production cost and that sort of recycling might become useful at that level.  In the current economy it's unlikely.  But the current economy is very likely to change.  Meanwhile the same sorts of technologies could be used to ""re-pack"" plastics into a precursor condition for other purposes. Our current plastic recycling modes are all one-way towards stiffer and less useful materials. You can make a bench out of a bottle, but you can't make a bottle out of a bench as it stands.

In fact, I think it actually is classified as slightly (as in 'imperceptibly to the human eye') greenish, but don't quote me on that.  Anyway, the Sun is white but the light gets scattered by the atmosphere, and as it approaches the horizon relative to the observer it is passing through more atmosphere and appears yellow and then finally yellow-red as it sets.  So while it's high in the sky, it's white.  When it's lower and easier to look at (or at least you're more likely to look near it) it seems tinged yellow.  ...And then your eye and brain get involved and start doing while balancing for you just to make things even more complicated."

AskScienceDiscussion,37q3xw,The_Evil_Within,7,Fri May 29 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"So if I aim the sun's light into a prism at sunset, when it seems red, does it disperse?   I would expect the prism to continue to work as a prism, and split the available light as always.  Depending on how close to sunset we're talking, there may not be a lot of non-red light left to diffract relative to the ambient light levels.  I've never tried it myself, but it would be interesting to see how close to sunset you can get before your eye can no longer detect non-red light on the far side of the prism."

AskScienceDiscussion,37q3xw,BitOBear,2,Sat May 30 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"Because you misunderstand the use of ""yellow"" in this usage.  The sun is strongest frequency of emission is yellow (or even slightly past yellow into ""green"" if /u/The_Evil_Within is correct).  The sun isn't a laser pump tuned to produce exactly one frequency of light. No star is. But its color temperature has a peak. As that peak moves, that is when we look at other stars of different colors, we see shifts towards either the red or the blue end of the visible light spectrum.  So in our case, if the sun is yellow, we see all the colors through the prism but if we could count the individual photons we'd see that there were more in the yellow band than in the blue or red bands.  So all and all, when we look at the sun it's ""more yellow"" than any other color, but not by a lot. And it is way more yellow than a red giant or a blue dwarf, both of which would also have a full spectrum through a prism, just with different bands being the brightest."
AskScienceDiscussion,37q3xw,wazoheat,1 point,Fri May 29 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"Just to add on: increasing the temperature of an object increases the emission at all wavelengths. So a blue giant star actually releases more yellow light than the Sun, it just produces even more blue light."

AskScienceDiscussion,37nsy3,Teanut,2,Fri May 29 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Hair is dead. Nothing is good or bad for it in the ""our product gives nutrients to your hair"" sense.  If not washing your hair and scalp changed the oil your body produced then the cure for acne would be to never wash your face so all those oils would just go away.  The question of whether and how much to wash is not closed by any means. Washing may be bad for your microbiome. Then again having debris in your hair and having that debris held against your scalp may be harmful as well.  It is known that aggressive washing with some soaps can make your hair weaker because chemistry and mechanical actions are things that exist. So some (many?) people find that washing a lot makes their hair more frizzy.  Meanwhile some people like dreadlocks, which are basically called ""matted hair"" when it happens to animals, and often involves tangles of unwashed hair in giant globs.  And conditioners are largely varnish, in the classical instead of paint sense. Different conditioners varnish on different sets of oils or proteins or emollients.  So different people will swear by different regimines, but the secret is that no one answer is correct.  One example (pardon the anecdote), I am one of the people who are sensitive to Laurel and Laureth Sulfates. Those detergents are banned for human use in many countries (e.g. canada and europe) but are in almost all hair shampoos here in the U.S. where I live. So when I switched to a more classical soap I traded one itch for another (I got rid of the rash, but the drying of my skin went up a little).  The lesson? Well the super science part is that it's the water that is doing the work. The soap or detergent is a surfactant that just lets the water work better. So you could get essentially the same amount of clean if you stayed under the hot water ""long enough"", but who has that kind of time.  There is no correct formula that matches universal needs.  If your scalp is oily, you will want a soap or detergent to remove that oil.  If you are sensitive to a particular soap or detergent your body might produce more oil because it's being irritated, but honestly if that were happening you'd have other symptoms of unhealthy skin like a rash or really huge flakes of dandruff. (ASIDE: everyone has dandruff, that's part of how skin works, but if you've got big structural flakes of skin coming off then you've likely got something else going on too.)  So experiment with things. And no, the expensive brands aren't generally more likely for a positive outcome compared to finding the right things to use and avoid.  So what do I do? I use a castile soap for washing every day and I found this cheap ""coconut water conditioner"" that didn't have anything really irritating in it, but I only use that every week to ten days. Some of the more hair-involved people I know tell me I need to condition more, but that's purely cosmetic and I don't really care.  So seriously, if you are unhappy with your results then change your process bit-by-bit to figure out what gives you the outcome you want most.  But your hair itself is just keratin excrement and there is nothing you can really do to change how it comes out of your body.  Make your scalp comfortable. If you think your skin is oily, wash more. If you think it's dry, then literally use lotion or a conditioner that acts like lotion. Add or remove what you want to make it what you want to within the limits of your genetics. Heck, have fun with it."

The sun delivers 173,000 terawatts from above and geothermal delivers 45 terawatts from within.  Earth will get rather cold rather quickly without sunlight. With just geothermal heat, Earth's surface will come to a refreshing 35 K according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, considering our power output divided by the surface area of the Earth as j*. Even if we kept producing heat at our current rate it would be only about three degrees warmer.  Glaciers made of pale-blue frozen oxygen and nitrogen cover everything. The surface resembles Pluto except slightly colder (Pluto has an average temperature of 44 K).

In either scenario its as good as not being there at all. And in either scenario we would still be scrambling to survive, probably deep underground geothermal/fusion power.  There is very little energy from galactic radiation. All of the radiation we are worried about comes from the sun because of how close it is. In fact if the sun disappeared all our radiation worries would be gone. If galactic radiation had tangible amounts of energy in comparison to solar radiation, solar sails would literally pave the way for interstellar travel, sadly this is not the case."

And since there's more than heat and light coming from the Sun, there is certainly a difference   Very little of a difference, and the differences do not change anything about the answer. If our sun does not emit light or heat, then it cannot have solar winds either, unless you plan to bring your own fake physics into play. It is clear that the question is regarding ""could humanity artificially illuminate and warm the planet?""

Why are antenna towers and buildings hollow? They are hollow because filling them in is a waste of mass for the stability achieved.  Other reasons might include how well that increases ""bark"" surface area. Heart wood in trees doesn't do much for getting water and nutrients from the ground to the canopy. That all happens in the outer layers of the sap-wood (maybe), the cambium and the phloem (if memory serves). Basically all the ""work"" of moving materials happens in the near-surface circumference of the trunk.  So having multiple trunks, or at least ditching the full thickness of the trunk, gives maximum transport without having to invest in all that full-thickness volume.  As solutions go, what's not to like?  /u/MJMurcott gives an example of how such hollowness might be achieved, by the use of multiple rising trunks that fuse together. Or those air-root things that drop down and become separate trunks (much like how spider plants and blackberry bushes plant runners)."

What is that, if not what scientists do when trying to explain phenomena in nature?  It also encompasses pretty much all of the disciplines, and can help differentiate between to different theories by saying, ""John Doe's model vs. Jack Black's model"" .

Heck, physics is divided between experimental physics (that is, testing theories empirically) and theoretical physics (proving theories using deductive methods involving no empirical tests).  String theory, to the best of my knowledge, completely lacks any kind of unique empirical prediction.    Even in the philosophy of science, a theory does not have to actually have any empirical evidence behind it.  It just has to be falsifiable, and string theory does not even meet that criteria.    It's similar in Computer Science.  Theoretical computer science is, by definition, the branch that shies away from empirical models and relies on abstract mathematical proofs."

This might just be because I'm an experimentalist, so you could view this as a tactic where I don't have to claim a deep understanding all of the theory I am supposedly using ;)   And although I don't have much to back this up, I don't see why a model also wouldn't, by definition, have some amount of empirical support."

People simply are not that precise about using language - that's why languages evolve over time, for instance - and although scientists probably do make more of an effort than the average person to be consistent with technical terms, they're subject to the same fluctuations of language as everybody else. That's why Newton's and Maxwell's contributions are ""laws"", but Einstein's is a ""theory"", and modern particle physics has a (""standard"") ""model"", etc.  If you do really want to pick a specific word, I'd go with ""model"" because it captures what all these ideas are trying to do: provide a description that may match the behavior of a real physical system to an acceptable level of precision. ""Doctrine"" seems really bad because has the connotation (at least to me) of a declaration, made by some person or group, which people accept simply because they have committed to believe whatever that person or group says. There is a place for doctrines; for example, soldiers are best off following their commanding officer's orders even if those orders don't always represent the optimal strategy. But science is not that place.  Incidentally, if you want to be pedantic about terminology: a ""skeptic"" is someone who thinks critically about claims, and searches for evidence to support them, whereas a ""denier"" is someone who insists that  a claim is false regardless of what the evidence shows.

One example is teeth.  While it seems that there's a lot of diversity in dentition within modern humans, certain differences aren't possible within a single species, such as different specializations that result from slightly different diets.  The differences in skull shapes among modern humans are largely superficial, but differences in brain volume or bone thickness beyond a certain threshold is not found within the species.  We also expect there to be less diversity among earlier species than in modern humans, simply due to the sheer size of modern human populations (our ancestors' populations probably never exceeded a million individuals that far back in time) and the large global distribution of human populations that leads to minor adaptations to different climates such as skin/hair colour and facial structure.  It would be unreasonable to expect that ancient humans with a population of a few thousand, living in a small region in Africa to be significantly different from one another in skull shape or other features, unless there was some pressure that caused divergence before the point in time that the two groups were living together.    It's also not the case that when we say a 'difference species' in this context that it's certain that they were unable to breed with one another; it's still possible that they were genetically compatible, but the presence of small differences in this context is ample evidence that the two groups were evolving along slightly different paths some time before they were found in the same place at the same time."

Native colored light, e.g. an exact single frquency of light, versus a composite light, e.g. the ""image color"" produced on your computer monitor.  If I use a relatively coherent source (like a very wel colored light bulb or a laser) and view it through a prisim I will get a relatively narrow and single line with a fall-off intensity around the center of the color because few things except maybe the laser are really one color.  If I look at a generated image from a classic phosphor television or a ""plasma"" monitor or an ""OLED"" monitor, I'll see three strong lines on Red, Green, and Blue. These colors are selected and tuned to the human eye's cone cell sensitivities. Since our eyes actually see combinations of those colors we can faithfully reproduce any color by emitting just those colors from a source, this is how a digital camera can store an analog continuum of colors in just three bit planes.  When I get light from a source like an LCD monitor there is actual an array of white lights emitting white light. The LCD's polarize that light and then a filter layer discards (as heat) whatever has been polarized against the filter. If you look up ""LCD monitor privacy glasses"" you can find movies on how to remove the filter from a monitor and then make polarizing glasses that can still see ""the image"". It's kind of neat. 8-)  So when you look at your LCD monitor and it's producing any image it's actually radiating a lot of light all across the visual spectrum. Its basically got a bunch of ""white"" LEDs and then it's being ""trimmed down"" via filtration.  A ""black line"" on an otherwise black screen LCD monitor, if it's ""bright enough to see"", is actually a ""grey line"" and so a dim white light source. As such that ""black"" line is a white line of low intensity and you will see its entire spectrum.  ASIDE: If you have a large LCD television with ""enhanced blacks"", you have a large LCD television that has the ability to turn on and of regions of the white light behind the screen to make ""blacker blacks"". If you turn on such a television and tune it to a completely black image and then turn off the lights in the room (so the room is really dark) and then, say, bring up the volume control or menu, you can often see the white lights come on zone-by-zone, usually by looking at the edges of the screen.

AskScienceDiscussion,37iyzj,broncohockeyd14,4,Wed May 27 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"I think you are grasping a bit in the wrong direction.  You need to understand that science is constantly moving forward - and by doing so is constantly disproving flawed hypotheses, and making new ones that fit observation just a little bit better. In the most general sense, our current understanding of science is really just a set of working hypotheses that fit observed phenomena as well as we can manage. Many discrepancies are known, for example the proposed ""dark matter"", and we are constantly working to characterize these discrepancies to improve our understanding as a whole.  This said, there are some things that are generally accepted as ""true"" for specific conditions, making it possible to predict how systems will act within a reasonable margin of error. A simple example of this is the ideal gas law - it's great for understanding how high temp/low pressure gases act, but it does not predict phase changes. This limitation is understood, and we continue to use the ideal gas law because it is elegant and simple and gives us a good estimation of the behavior of applicable systems. Likewise, it is useful to use the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom in some circumstances, even though we know it to be ""wrong"", because it describes certain phenomena nicely without the detail of our current understanding of quantum mechanics.  In the same way, carbon dating involves the analysis of radioactive decay - something that we treat as a stochastic process in order to obtain a good estimation of how long carbon has been locked in a particular form. This involves significant assumptions such as the concentration of C13 in the environment for living things to incorporate into themselves, but to the best of our understanding at this point, it is a good approximation.  Despite how things may be sensationalized on the news, it is extremely unlikely that anything will completely flip over the table of our understanding of physics. However, the details are constantly being rewritten. New phenomena are constantly being discovered, forcing scientists to amend current theories, but this generally occurs at an incremental pace."
AskScienceDiscussion,37iyzj,snipatomic,2,Thu May 28 08:33:42 2015 UTC,"what the chances are we discover something that could rewrite are perception of space, time, gravity   Pretty high. We know there are some outstanding problems in physics that have not yet been explained with the current theories. At some point, we'll have better theories that can explain more phenomena.  However, the theories we have right now are extremely accurate the vast majority of the time. So, ""Lets say we discover something that leads to carbon dating being wildly inaccurate"" is not very likely at all. Also, we use multiple methods of dating historical things- that's one of the reasons we know carbon dating works, because you can get the same dates out of it as other methods.  Same goes for other types of radioisotope dating- there can be multiple ways of determining the geological age of a rock, and they are in pretty good agreement. If you have two different methods for dating something, and they don't agree, you know that somewhere along the line your assumptions are wrong.  For example, Edwin Hubble calculated the age of the universe a long time ago, and came up with a figure that was younger than the known age of the Earth. This is a clear indication that something is wrong- either the universe is older than Hubble thought, or the Earth was younger. Turns out, his calculations were wrong because galaxies are actually much farther away than he thought, which threw off his calculations.  So- even if our understanding of physics isn't perfect, we know that radioisotope dating works because there are multiple ways of checking."

AskScienceDiscussion,37igj8,barnabyg2,2,Wed May 27 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"If I had to make an educated guess, there are two main causes: 1) the receptive fields for the visual cortex of your brain, and 2) your pupil contracting due to the light. I'll start with #1, but I think #2 is the more accurate answer.  http://panosgeorgiadis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-05-at-4.03.51-PM.png  You see in that image a receptive field; it takes in information from your retina and interprets them into lines and such for you to see whole objects. The one on the left is a On-Center receptive field. If a signal (light) his the center of the field, this neuron turns on. But if a signal hits the surrounding area of the field (highlighted in gray here), then the neuron does not fire.  The one on the right is an Off-Center neuron; same idea, but opposite. Light in the surrounding area turns it on, and light in the center turns it off.  If you overlay a bunch of these neurons in an overlapping pattern, they can be used to detect lines and how these lines are oriented (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90, etc, etc). This is illustrated in this figure:  https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/orientedRF.png  This is essentially how you see details. It's a bit more complicated than this, but I only know some basics and this should be enough.  Obviously when you look at a bright light there are no lines; everything is pure white. It could be that your neurons are still recovering from the intensity of the light, and so are slow to respond to the more varied stimuli when you move away from the white light.  The second is probably your pupils contracting from bright light. They shrink down to a smaller opening, thereby allowing in less light. This is adaptive; it gives your eyes protection from overly intense light that could otherwise be damaging. The parts of your eyes that are more responsible for detecting details are the cone-shaped receptors in the fovea, which are very light-sensitive.  https://thewilltosee.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/eye2_thumb.jpg  This tiny area is what sees most of the finer details in your every day life. They're also the only cells that see colour. When your stare at an overly intense bright light, your pupil lets in less light. Then when you move on to normal light, your pupil is still contracted so that less light gets in. This might be too little for your fovea to really work with, and so you have to wait for your pupil to expand to a proper diameter again so that enough light can enter your eye for you to see details again."

But once you enter the bronze age, you have alloys that could not occur in nature.  Then you start doing something like refining uranium, and it is pretty clear that this is also an unnatural metal.

Specifically, the articles focus on the important mechanism of paracetamol poisoning, which can happen due to overdose and/or combination with alcohol or some other substances, and this mechanism is indeed well-known. I don't blame you, it's easy to confuse pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for each other.  On to number 3 then, it has a very promising headline. However, it still doesn't really adress our issue. The research was done by studying the end-results only, such as studying blood-levels of different molecules (like prostaglandins) to see what is affected. This absolutely helps our understanding, but it is not evidence for how a mechanism functions, only what it affects. The authors state that paracetamol has some effects that are similar to COX-inhibitors (like the NSAID class of analgesics), most similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors, but that there's also differences in the effects which means that this is not the answer. They have an hypothesis to explain this, which may be a sound one, but they haven't found proof for it yet, which they also state. Some quotes from the abstract, my emphasis added:   [...] the apparent selectivity of paracetamol may be due to inhibition of COX-2-dependent pathways [...]   &nbsp;   This hypothesis is consistent with the similar pharmacological effects [...]   &nbsp;   There is considerable evidence that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is central and is due to activation of descending serotonergic pathways, but its primary site of action may still be inhibition of PG synthesis.   &nbsp;   The action of paracetamol at a molecular level is unclear but could be related to the production of reactive metabolites by the peroxidase function of COX-2 [...]   An interesting thing to note is that the authors adress two other common hypotheses about the mechanism, namely the one about it being a selective COX-3 inhibitor (a hypothesis they refute), and the one about serotonergic pathways (the third quote above). We'll get back to these later in my post!  Then, article number 4, perhaps the one where it's most difficult to explain my refutation. They write outright that ""it is now generally accepted that it inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 through metabolism by the peroxidase function of these isoenzymes."" Well, the only thing I can say is that they're wrong about that. It is definitely not generally accepted, though the hypothesis might be gaining ground, perhaps especially so in the circles that these authors frequent. I have not heard any other sources say that there is a consensus on this, because there isn't, so I think it's dishonest to use such a sensational choice of words. I have no doubt that it was done exactly because of the sensation value. With that said, since they seem so sure of themselves I suppose they are on to something at least, which would be interesting, so I'll try to keep posted about this. I'm afraid I can't read the whole article from home, I'll see if I can get it tomorrow at the university, to see what kind of methods they have been using. If it seems really groundbreaking I'll send it on to one of my professors in pharmacology and see what they think, altough I doubt it (since I think I would already have heard about it).    You asked me for sources, and I'll see what I can do. My primary source of knowledge, that made me write it in the first place, is lectures at my university (Lund in Sweden) on pharmacology, all the professors have said that the mechanism of action is unknown (though there are theories). The most prevailing theory I've heard is that paracetamol would act as a selective COX-3 inhibitor in the central nervous system, but with no effects outside of the CNS. However, I'm not even completely certain that the existence of a COX-3 enzyme has been conclusively proven. I've also heard this hypothesis combined with the one about serotonergic pathways in the CNS, as mentioned in article 3 above. I believe that the evidence imply that paracetamol has more than one mechanism, so I don't find it strange if a lot of these hypotheses we've seen here contain some nugget of truth.   Of course, referring to lectures I've heard isn't a very good source (it is for me, but not for you), so I tried searching for publications on it. I found lots of results, among the first that came up was this which says ""The exact mechanism by which acetaminophen produces its analgesic and antipyretic effects remains undefined"", this one that says ""In spite of its wide use, the mechanism of action of acetaminophen has not been fully elucidated"", this review article stating that the subject is still debated. The Wikipedia article seems to give an overview of the conflicting theories, and also claims that paracetamol modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system, to throw that into the mix.  In summary, the question is not over yet. But I'll say that I used a bad choice of words in my first post, I said that we have no idea how it works, which was poorly worded. We have many ideas, but no solid proof for any of them, I should have been more careful.  Edited for formatting."

AskScienceDiscussion,37dqkb,Lowbacca1977,2,Wed May 27 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really.   The issue is that a bicycle is like a complex multi link apparatus. And while you can explain to people why a simple pendulum is stable with intuition, its hard to do this with a bicycle, because there are multiple dynamics going on at the same time that they interact with each other.   However, its really straightforward to derive the dynamics of the bicycle and compute the conditions for stable poles of the system. The result is going to be a combination of many variables that take into account CG location, trail, rake, wheel diameter, offset, gyroscopic forces, and so on.   The paper in your link just showed that the condition for positive trail  or gyroscopic precession is not absolutely necessary for self stabilization, as many people believed. And that is all evident in the stable poles of the equation.   For most traditional bicycles, the stability comes from simply the dynamic balance of the camber thrust of the front wheel. If a bike leans, without rider input, the camber thrust will cause the wheel to turn into the lean, which countersteers the bike upright. And this is only valid for a certain speed range, which is dependant on a lot of factors."

Just don't go giving yourself an aneurysm thinking your future plans need to be set in stone, polished, and put on display for the world to know about. You have a lot of time yet.   Here's how I've gone so far:  Back when I took physical chemistry, I fell in love with that course, so I decided I would focus on pchem in grad school. This is basically where you're at right now. After that, I decided on a school I wanted to go to, because to me, location and my comfort in the place were the next highest priority. I got accepted to my school, went up there and talked to many different professors, they told me about their work, and I heard about one particular topic that was just really really fascinating to me. I contacted one of the people who worked on that topic, and he had room. Now I'm ""working"" for him, but really, it's more like I'm just learning from being near people.  That said, I don't know if this is where I'm going to keep going with my research. I think it is for the moment, but there's a reason schools do rotations. They want you to see and experience a whole lot of different topics so you can find something great for you.   That doesn't mean you go in blind though, do your research. If you go the same route as I did, find people at the schools you're interested in who have worked in, say, linguistics and genetics. See where their work has taken them and decide if you like what they're doing. If not, reevaluate whether or not you actually want to be in that field.   There's too much out there for a few people on the internet to give you suggestions about. This is your life and your career you're talking about. Just look around, read about professors works, ask questions. You'll find it sooner or later, but it's a question you have to ask yourself."

Random people on the internet, whether we have advanced degrees or not, will not be able to help you find a career that best suits you because we're not you. As a warning, math is essential for most sciences, whether they are considered ""hard"" or not, a term, which as far as I can tell, has little to no meaning. I am a geologist, of which the public perception seems to be someone who is 1) not a ""hard"" scientist and 2) spends most of their time looking at rocks, when in reality I spend about 1 month a year looking at rocks and the rest in a lab doing chemistry or at a computer writing code and doing math. Many people come to geology, and other disciplines that get lumped into ""soft sciences"", with the expectation of little to no math skills being required and they are quite often very unpleasantly surprised.  Also, I realize this would be down the road for you a bit, but to be brutally honest, doing a PhD sucks. Even the most capable and driven people will hit various parts of their PhD that are incredibly challenging and often demoralizing. Beyond sheer stubbornness, in my experience, the thing that separates those who finish from those who don't is quite often a strong underlying passion for the science that their doing, a passion that's strong enough to get you through the days/weeks/months where your experiments don't work, you don't have the money to do the work you need, your papers get rejected, the equipment is broken, your adviser is coming down hard on you, you're behind on your grading, etc etc.   This is a long winded way of saying that if you haven't found something within the sciences that make you really passionate before you start a graduate degree, you're not going to find that passion in grad school. If anything, it will be beaten out of you and the best case is that you can hope to maintain it and reclaim it after you finish (then you start a postdoc where you have other dreams beaten out of you, but that's another story for another time)."

St. Hellens was something like 400 times as energetic as the heroshima bomb, it turns out that nuclear weapons are really kind of puny compared to geologic forces.  Now given what we don't know about the actual underground structures and pressures in Yellowstone, it's possible that there is some point that is just one stick of dynamite away from triggering and extinction level eruption. It's vastly unlikely, but possible none the less.  The real problem isn't collecting up the force, it's delivering the force somewhere useful. So it's possible that just digging the shaft to plant the bomb might result in a cave-in that would deliver the necessary force before you even got the bomb to the site.  What I am saying is that the question is unanswerable because we don't have the necessary maps of stresses, forces, and chambers.  It's even possible that Yellowstone's last super-eruption was it's last ever and it can never happen again. If the current configuration simply cannot focus the necessary energy because the large chambers no longer interconnect or the plume isn't really under there any more, then the whole thing might not be a ""whole thing"" any more.

In the last two hundred years somewhere we discovered that the earth isn't spherical but is instead an ""oblate spheroid"".  And within my lifetime we've realized that the oblation is non-equatorial and so the earth is basically egg shaped.  But here's the thing, for all this ""wrongness"" we still use Mean Sea Level from the Flat Earth Hypotheses.  The first rule of science is that when a new set of explanations are proffered, they must ""account for"" every single previous observation and measurement. Those measurements and observations can be proved inaccurate (e.g. the missing four inches per mile) or they can be proved circumstantial (e.g. you'd get different measurements for the earths circumference if you measure from the oblate region as opposed to a more tensile section of the spheroid). And if you cannot re-cast the data you must include the data and account for its inclusion in your proposed explanation or your proposed explanation is not going to be accepted because it contradicts the facts.  It is occasionally true that an entire branch of scientific reasoning has to be tossed in the garbage, but that is EXCEEDINGLY rare. The last time this happened, if memory serves, is ""spontaneous generation"". Before microscopy and cell theory it was regularly observed that ""meat would sprout maggots"" spontaneously. The root cause of this observation was the fact that fly eggs are just too small to see before the age of really, really good magnifying optics. So it was, not unreasonably, believed that meat and such inherently possessed the ability to express maggots once removed from the confines of skin. Once the presence of fly eggs and such was proved that entire branch of reasoning got lopped off. But not all at once. It took about two hundred years to be excised from modern thought because each one of its observations and conclusions had to be crushed under the hammer of disproof.  In most cases when something scientifically established is ""proved wrong"" it is actually proved ""inadequate"" after some threshold. For instance Newtonian gravity and orbital mechanics was displaced by Relativity's gravity as ""the real answer"" but the Newtonian equations are plenty good enough, and regularly used as the simple answer, unless precision or circumstance absolutely requires higher precision. So we use Newton to get into the neighborhood while estimating orbits and so costs for design, and then someone might pull out the really exact math when they are pointing a laser at a spacecraft from the earth.  So ""science has been wrong before"" is not the magical incantation that your friends think it is. When science is proved wrong it's usually by diminishing fractions. Inches of error become millimeters of error in the next iteration, and so on.  In the matter of neuroscience, when we discovered neurotransmitters communicating across synapses we didn't throw away Galvani and the electrical nature of signaling inside nerves. We didn't learn that electrical signalling was ""wrong"" in the lay sense. We learned that it was just not the whole process and that there were chemical parts as well.  So as for the ""Free Will"". There is nothing in the science that I am aware of that prevents ""free will"". Chaotic systems and Brownian Motion and any number of other confounding factors put the lie to the fully predictable and mechanically inevitable universe on the scales we are talking.  People often invoke the word ""enough"" in this matter. That is, they say that if we had ""accurate enough"" information in ""sufficient quantity and detail"" we would see the universe as purely predictable mechanics. But that ""enough"" is itself a ""magical incantation"". It's a self-moving goalpost. Every time you bring up something like Brownian Motion the proponent of ""enough theory"" will point out that if we know the position and velocity of all the particles then it's purely mechanical. E.g. they invoke the ""screw Heisenberg"" proposition while simultaneously invoking ""quantum uncertainty cannot function at the larger scale"".  If god is in the gaps of the religious perspective, then there is some equally mysterious hyper-accuracy perspective crammed in the gaps of the deterministic universe theory.  The purely deterministic universe is just as unproved as any god. It's largely deterministic but the idea that someone is going to be able to usefully know exactly how many serotonin molecules are going to bond to exactly which receptors in every singe firing of the nerves in your head, and also know exactly which molecules are going to be taken up and which are going to be cleared from receptors in what order well enough to say there is no uncertainty in your neural function, just laugh them off for believing in a literally dictatorial god of the synaptic gaps.  What about mood? ""well if we knew enough about  your mood..."" What about ...? ""well if we knew enough about ...""  In other words if we were god we'd know what you were going to do. Same formulation, different set dressing. It's a principle you cannot counter because invocation of ""enough"" plus failure can be countered by ""you didn't have enough"". It's an inherently circular premise.  So the deterministic neural model is completely undemonstrated, not that it's been proved false, but there is nowhere near enough (ha ha) evidence to support it as fact.   But ""science has been wrong before""? Nope... just plain arguing to ignorance."
AskScienceDiscussion,37csgg,BitOBear,1 point,Wed May 27 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"So pure, predictable determinism is out. There's just too much going on, and that's fine. But I'd say that doesn't hold any weight in an argument for free will. To borrow from Sam Harris, the universe as we can understand it is to some degree deterministic and to some degree random, but no matter how much you slide around on that scale you never end up with an inch of room into which free will can find a foothold. We don't need to argue that the whole thing is determined in order to rule out the idea that we truly or even kinda author our own thoughts or actions, and I don't think that OP in his question made that argument in the first place.  But who knows, science has been wrong before."
AskScienceDiscussion,37csgg,KillAllTheZombies,1 point,Wed May 27 09:00:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree with Sam Harris. There is more than a inch of room for free will.  A disbelief that strong is just a belief.  Meanwhile a system that must choose, like a neuron, provided with two random inputs and the input from a feedback system can choose which random input(s) to honor.  That's plenty of room for free will.  Maybe not as one inch sitting all together, but as the infinite sum of infinitesimal inputs it becomes many, many inches.  The ""simple math"" of the deterministic universe says there can be no free will, but the complex calculus of the 1 quadrillion synapses in the brain -- firing how many times a day? -- is plenty of space to develop the individual systemic bias we call free will.  You can choose to see that as mechanical or deterministic or indeterminate, but on the whole the evidence suggests that it is ""plenty free enough"".  I'd agree that we don't have randomly independent will. That is we don't operate independent of input and history. That's a given. But there is no apparent requirement that an exact input has an exact dependent output.  Until, that is, you invoke the doctrine of ""Enough"". In Sam's mind -- presuming your representation of his position is accurate here -- he has so invoked that doctrine. He believes that if you could quantify ""enough"" of the input you'd know the output. I don't necessarily disagree. I disagree that you could ever solve for ""enough"" in that construct without a god perspective.  So imagine a universe where all outcomes are predetermined because the universe knows ""enough"". It would have to know ""enough"" about its self to not only express the outcome but express the predetermination. And so it would have to be able to pre-determine the process that does that determination as well. And that's ""turtles all the way down"" just to a different god state.  For there to be an absence of free will, there would have to be something constraining that will. There would have to be a ""greater will"" from which my will could not be freed. That will might be deliberate or it might be mechanical, but it would have to exist if ""will"" exists. And anybody who has met a two year old knows that ""will"" exists.  The laws of physics tell us that for all actions there is a resolution. But to mistake the inevitability of a resolution with the inevitability of the exact resolution that comes about is to deny randomness at every level.  If a coin can flip randomly, then why would it be doctrine that our brain lacks the ability to flip a coin? You might have countless neurons that flip coins while modeling possible outcomes and then decide which of those models it ""likes"" best. And that simple randomness is more than enough to provide us with the latitude of decision.  To deny free will is to imagine that randomness is never random.  To believe in the absence of free will is to not quite escape The God Delusion (ha ha) pretty much by definition.  TL;DR :: It is easy to propose a set of conditions that cannot exist, such as a set of protons moving faster than the speed of light. Sam and you propose there is a set of information that renders neurological function purely deterministic. There is no evidence to suggest that such a set exists, and there is plenty of evidence in the form of randomness and uncertainty to suggest that such a set probably does not exist. So having made the extraordinary claim that such a set must exists, you and Sam bear the burden of proving that extraordinary claim. The rest of us can simply rest and wait for you to prove you know ""enough"".  TL;DR was TL;DR :: The ""initial value problem"" (a.k.a the initial condition hypothesis) plagues and effectively denies neurological determinism."
AskScienceDiscussion,37csgg,BitOBear,1 point,Fri May 29 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to deny randomness, or invoke the doctrine of enough. I can't speak for Sam but that isn't the way I understood his argument either. The idea is just that on one end of the scale a universe is 100% determined from the start and on the other end it's !00% random, and that at neither end nor anywhere in between can we author our own thoughts for the reason that we are neither in control of determined nor random events. There isn't anything in the universe we've discovered so far that doesn't fall on that scale, so we must assume that our brains, whether we understand their complexities or not, operate on the same scale.  The part of your objection to this I'm lost on is by what mechanism our brains are choosing which model it likes best. Regardless of what inputs (or their origins) made up the models, I would argue that the brain's choice of one model over another is just a consequence of the state it was in before and during the process of doing the modeling. To say the choice is coming from anywhere else is to invoke a new place from which it could have come, for which we have yet to find evidence.  Ignoring that, even if there were some form of choice the neurons could make between the different models they created, they did not have any choice in the models that they were choosing from. The form of will that would be being expressed in this scenario would be a narrow one, constrained to choose between forks rather than having the ability to blaze a new path. It would be like if I asked you to name a movie. You'd be limited to the movies you know of, and unable to truly choose any movie at all. It would not be the freedom of will most of us think of when we use the term.  But even then, that's granting that the brain is making decisions somewhere outside of the scale of determinism and randomness. That outside though is something we have yet to find evidence for. Everything we currently know of is expressing itself as deterministic, random, or as a system consisting of elements of both. The brain would have to be working outside our current understanding of physics in order to truly make choices, be they entirely free or the more constrained version in my last paragraph.  The doctrine of ""enough"" isn't something I see factoring in to the question. Something that's random is random and something that's determined it's determined, our ability to understand how much of each is at play and make predictions based on that understanding is irrelevant to the system at work. The sliding scale rules all, it shouldn't matter if we understand it."

Minkin once said that every complex problem has a solution that is simple, elegant, and wrong.  Imagining that something complex is either deterministic or random, and so can be not fusion of both is ""the excluded middle fallacy"" by definition.  Why, having prised god out of that gap, do you feel compelled to cram determinism in there? We have time. We can find the correct answer. We can measure and search.  If you've really overcome the need for a motivating god then you shouldn't feel the need to force a poorly visualized ""something mechanical"" into the place you just freed up. Do some measurements. Engage in some science. Look for answers instead of acting like you have to sew up the spot with something. Science and fact are not going to bleed to death. We don't have to cram suppositional gauze into every crack from which we excised a ""god did it"".

AskScienceDiscussion,37csgg,BitOBear,1 point,Fri May 29 09:00:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where I said that it's either-or, I was careful to include that things can be both. My whole point is that it's no matter whether something was any of deterministic, random, or both, because within any of those there is no place where a brain can exert control and make it's own choices. You proposed that they can still choose but still haven't explained where that choice is coming from.  Why is it a failing to believe that the doctrine of enough is irrelevant? As I understood your argument, you were saying that because there will never be ""enough"" accuracy of measurement to predict everything, that there can still be free will. My contention is that it doesn't matter whether we can measure it, the forces at work don't allow free will regardless of our ability to predict.  Reading your TL;DR, I see that you've misunderstood the argument from Sam Harris that I was using. The argument doesn't state that the brain is purely deterministic, just that it has to have elements of determinism and randomness, and that it is limited to those two things. If that is granted, then it follows that  free will cannot be happening anywhere in the brain, since the brain has no more control over randomness than determinism. Not being able to know exactly what's going to happen is still very different from being able to choose what's going to happen, and we have yet to find a mechanism by which that choice could be made."

If my free will is simulated then if it's simulated ""well enough"" is there a difference? I seem to author my actions and decide about many thoughts every day. I feel no hand but my own, heavy or light, on the tiller of my mind.   Do you have any evidence for the absence of free will, or can you simply not conceive of the mechanism by which it might function?  In terms of the evidence, we have the evidence and experience of what we believe is free will. And we have no evidence for its alleged absence.  So if you make the extraordinary claim that the thing I perceive of as free will is not, in fact, there... what is your proof? Is it anything other than a thought experiment that proposes a deterministic universe?  Whenever I look at this argument, and I've looked at it before, I have found zero evidence for the absence of free will.  We are in a classic case of the absence of evidence being taken for the evidence of absence. The deterministic universe is not actually supported in the data because we have evidence of indeterminacy in the data. The easiest of that indeterminacy is randomness, but there is also classical scale and quantum scale uncertainty.  Free will might, itself, be a mechanism.  There is also the vast array of what we don't know at all.  So it's a little early to be slamming the book closed on ""free will"".  What's the hurry? Why are you and Sam so determined to slam that door? I see a huge unknown and zero actual, falsifiable data; and I see some people with a dogma about how free will must not exist, as backed up with a thought experiment that pivots on an excluded middle. But I see no evidence.  The deterministic universe model of thought just seems like cowardliness in the face of an unknown, but I see no more validity in that model, no more evidence, no more proposed method, than I ever saw in the ""god did it"" model.   Sure enough, there is no ""authorship"" without insight, and there is no insight without history, but to go from history and insight to determinism is to pretend that impulse and mood and preference are mythical.  Both models can be proposed, but to be so sure that one is right and one is wrong with no actual evidence... What a shame really..."

I can feel like the magician made the ball disappear in to thin air, but one wouldn't say ""is there a difference?"" when asked the question of whether or not he's just hiding it from your viewing angle. Feeling like you have will doesn't bear anything on whether or not you do.  And of course there is never evidence for absence, so I don't have that. All we need to dismiss something though is that it becomes unnecessary. A theory doesn't just need plausibility but necessity as well, and free will is not necessary for the brain to function. Until we empirically find free will is somehow at work, the simpler explanation that it isn't there will be preferred.  Calling my claim extraordinary so that you can in turn demand extraordinary evidence is silly, when my claim is not extraordinary at all. My claim is that the brain seems to work by use of mechanisms which don't allow for the authorship of thoughts and actions, and that while there are still uncertainties about how it does work the current theories regarding what else may be going on still don't bear the fruit of will. Free will as a mechanism in the universe is highly speculative and entirely unfounded so far.  You keep representing my argument as excluding the middle and pushing for determinism, but that's not what I'm doing. My argument is that it doesn't matter whether things are determined or random or anywhere in the middle because the freedom to choose is still left with nothing to grasp at. Any combination of predictability and indeterminacy leaves no place for choices to be made.  Absence of evidence is certainly not evidence of absence, but the same argument is made in favor of god to no effect. I'm not saying ""we haven't found it so it can't be there"" but rather that ""we haven't found it, we don't yet need it, so let's work under the assumption that it isn't there until there's more data.""  It's the celestial teapot all over again. I don't need to prove that it isn't there in order to be reasonable in my assumption that it isn't. When it comes to free will, there is simply no mechanism we know of that allows for it. That doesn't mean that it can't possibly be real, but it does mean that we are most safe when saying it probably isn't.  So when the ball disappears from the magicians hand, it isn't reasonable to say ""The ball seemed to vanish completely and the burden of proof is on you if you want to say that it didn't!"" I'm not the one actually making a claim that needs backing, because I'm assuming that things work the way we (so far) know them to. It is the one that says free will is real that needs to put forth evidence for a mechanism by which it can express itself, because currently we know of none."

Now, there are plenty of instances when good ideas are rejected for no good reason at all.  When Ignaz Semmelweis figured out that far fewer women would die after childbirth if doctors washed their hands, his conclusions were rejected (despite good, solid data proving him to be correct) because the doctors were offended by the idea that they were at fault.  So, yes.  There are almost certainly ideas floating around right now that are not accepted but which are correct.  But there are also far, FAR more that are floating around which are ridiculous nonsense.  The only way to figure out which category is which is to do the work and collect the data.  Until the data is there, rejecting the idea is, and will always be, the right thing to do.  I ran into a guy once who was evangelizing for cannabis oil as a literal cure-all, claiming that it could fix everything from acne to end-stage cancer.  We went around and around about the need for evidence, but he refused to accept it.  He finally left with a dire warning that after he was proved right, we'd all feel horrible and silly for rejecting him.  But that's wrong.  Even if it turns out that he is right, it would be utterly foolish and irresponsible to start treating everything with his oil until we know that it works.  Soapbox closed."

AskScienceDiscussion,37b9nz,The_Serious_Account,7,Tue May 26 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Not just that, but one aspect of good science that's commonly forgotten is consistency--that is, that a phenomenon is explaineable in terms of existing science.  Every effective useful theory requires a phenomenon and a mechanism.  Mechanism is also a good check against pseudoscience.  History's full of genuine phenomena that were ignored because there wasn't enough known to make sense of it or employ the discovery usefully.  A good ""almost"" example of this is Darwin's work ( http://www.scientus.org/Mendel-Darwin.html).  Despite being a brilliant observational work, it has a huge hole because it doesn't explain the mechanism by which traits can be inherited in such a way that they can be selected on over generations.   A basic understanding of genetics was required to really appreciate natural selection"

One of the big reasons was that Holme's had a similar theory that predated his, making it seem redundant, and this confusion was greatly exacerbated by Semmelweis not publishing his results. In fact, Semmelweis was basically an asshole with no diplomacy who exercised terrible judgement, doing a really shitty job of communicating his data in general. When he finally published, more than a decade after his initial results had been poorly circulated by associates, he was ruthlessly antagonistic, polemical, offensive. He became obsessed (you could hardly blame him, but it didn't look good), and shortly after went insane and was committed. None of this helped his cause. Also, it should be noted that he could offer no coherent explanation for his findings (this was before the germ theory of disease). Given the science of the times, it was reasonable to take the Bayesian prior that he was wrong, and so, without good scientific communication of data, it was pretty reasonable that the consensus view was not overturned."

Those two compounds can cause neurogenesis(new brain cells) in the regions where they are expressed.

First, it describes a bucket of water suspended from a twisted rope. When it's released, the bucket starts spinning and falling in a linked manner towards a terminal rate.  The bucket will move downwards far slower than freefall, so gravity is slightly diminished, but otherwise constant.  This reduces it to the modern equivalent of a spinning cup of water.  I would imagine that if the cup was rougher, or even had fins or paddle, the transition from flat to parabola would be much faster since the effect is caused by the 'bucket' accelerating water particles. Rather than focus on the shape of the surface, imagine a transparent liquid like corn syrup with thousands of small particles suspended in it. The outer ones will tend to spin at bucket speed since they have the greatest contact, while the inner stuff rotates slower than the bucket."

It is the argument of old people who don't want their legacy to be tarnished by the emergent facts.  We can't ""stop climate change"" because things like plate tectonics make changes in climate inevitable BUT THAT'S NOT THE ACTUAL ISSUE.  Here is the actual issue in less loaded terms: Can we stop children from falling down? No... But we can stop shoving them to the ground.  The very existence of radio and television and the internet proves that systems can be ""tuned"" and can be resonant on natural frequencies. If you take a radio and manually tune it with the knob, you will hear something on every setting. Most of that is static. That tells us that the entire universe puts out radio waves. Yet we humans know that we can trample over those natural emissions and send music and television content and internet messages by simply adding signal to a section of all that evergy but much more aggressively.  So lets talk nuts and bolts. If a bolt in your engine has a torque spec of two hundred foot pounds plus-or-minus one percent, and you decide to plus or minus it by another one percent, have you fucked up? Quite possibly you have. You might have over clamped the gasket and ruined it, or you might have a bolt vibrate lose in fifty thousand miles and then you throw a rod while racing.  A percentage point here or there is a huge potential difference.  So there is NO ACTUAL QUESTION that our carbon emissions are causing extra climate change. There is a business interest in making you believe that we aren't having an effect, or that our effect doesn't really matter. But that business interest is contrary to the facts.  So lets say you are going to drive across the country. What's the effect of driving one percent faster? You get one percent farther right? So lets say we add one percent more energy to high altitude winds. Those winds are carrying moisture two thousand miles inland to determine the rainfall for Kentucky, but they go one percent further before they drop their rain. So Kentucky doesn't get their rain, but now there is flooding in the mountains of West Virginia.  When you are talking about air and water moving across thousands of miles a percentage point here or there is a hell of a lot.  But since that air was not only faster but that extra heat was stored as extra water instead of just raising the temperature, the air is still whatever degrees, but it's got thousands of more tons of water in it.  Plus that extra energy in all that extra water moving extra fast makes for those extra tornadoes and flooding in places that used to be dry.  And places that used to be wet are being over-flown because the water in the air is still too energetic to fall.  So could we stop the human component of climate change right now? Well can you un-shove a child once it's on the ground and bleeding? No.  But we could stop shoving the children to the ground and start dealing with the children we've already bloodied.  That is, we can't really undo what we've done, but we can stop doing it and so stop making it worse.  And if we can't stop China and India from shoving their children to the ground, that doesn't mean we have no reason to stop shoving our children to the ground... Every child left un-bloodied is a win.  Now if we had the will to spend the money we could do something about all this in a timely fashion. But every day we have the argument instead of working on the problem the solutions get more expensive, more urgently necessary, and way less effective.  See the thing is, the entire weather system of the earth down to the last gust of wind and the last raindrop, is just a single giant engine run on heat. Adding ""one degree of heat"" isn't saying that that the temperature on your porch is going to go up 1 degree.  That one degree of heat is a layman's term. We are talking billions or trillions of calories of energy spread all over the earth. We are talking more water in the sky, faster winds blowing further (so colder winters because the arctic air ""gets further, faster"") and then more violent storms in new and awful places because more water goes further and when water goes from gas to vapor (e.g. invisible to clouds) that totally changes how fast the air rises... so gentle rains become furious downpours.  We are not, and never were, talking about whether you need a sweater. We are talking about stomping down a little on the accelerator of the entire heat engine of the earth.  And when you are driving around, it doesn't take much to make the difference between making a tight corner and skidding off the road to your death."

Is there any reason to believe that there won't be positive changes as well?  For example, weather patterns changing so that deserts revert back to arable land... or populations that are currently subject to monsoons becoming less so because the monsoons shift elsewhere.  It sounds to me like this is what Buzz is getting at.  Let's assume the climate is changing and we are causing some of it.  How do we know that we aren't changing it for the better - and if we aren't sure, how much are we willing to sacrifice to mitigate the risk?"

Climate change, in this case by warming is, by definition, changing that environment. Global climate change is changing that environment globally. And man made global climate change is changing that environment incredibly fast.  This fast global climate change is too fast for evolution to keep up in bulk and what few creatures can migrate are unlikely to have a place to migrate too.  Thus is extinction of many life forms is assured.  And when you remove even a few life forms many food webs collapse catastrophically. For example no coral means no coral reefs which in turn means all the reef organisms are gone too.

No. Because there is no ""overall"" to which all things may better fit. Environments are a patchwork of overlapping small-scale conditions.  If you didn't process the whole coral example and you don't care about the generational time scales of evolution then I've got no idea how to communicate the science to you.   I would agree that the most publicized effects of man-made global climate change are negative effects, but I'd argue that the ""most publicized"" aspect biases this towards the negative. Can we agree on this?   No. We can not agree because of the use of ""bias"" in the dismissive. Facts are biased if they are facts, therefore the reporting, if accurate and demonstrative of a negative trend, isn't a case manipulation. So invoking bias with raised eyebrows as if to suggest wanton manipulation of fact is just cheap rhetorical implication. You go on to posit that there may be an apparently equal or even dominantly beneficial element of the process but have offered zero example elements to fulfill that set. Someone (I am assuming it was you, but I can't go check from the inbox page) mentioned bringing water to the desert. But I already pointed out that that isn't beneficial if it kills off all the desert dwelling species.  So what manner of ""positive"" do you expect or imagine we might find in the data set? And in what way does the ""benefits"" of that example out-weigh the costs? Be specific.  The strongest reason to believe there is no such hidden positive is that the various researchers being paid to look for it have been unable to find it anywhere. Billions of industry dollars paid to ""think tanks"" to debunk human action induced climate change and not one model to suggest that anything will be made better by stronger weather patterns and shifting water availability. Billions of dollars spent and the best retort has been ""well it won't be that bad"". This suggests no lurking, unreported positive outcome.  You are splitting hairs when you try to separate the near term past from the present in terms of evolution, particularly since we are talking about the speed and intensity of change. The entire ""but might it not be a good thing"" position is a bunch of crap. Sorry. Well actually, I not sorry. It's crap.  The ""positive spin"" on mass extinction is just a fantasy.  Things will recover. Life will go on. New species will evolve. That's all true.  But first will come disaster. Loss of diversity. Starvation. Drowning. Mudslides. Barren seas. Then all life will limp on and humanity will struggle and whatever, and then over the course of thousands of years those new niches will be filled. But that will be thousands of years of lean and unpleasant times for everything trying to find its new home.  So no. No ""positives"". No hidden utopia.

This would cause flooding, violent storms, and furious downpours.  I asked ""you're pointing out lots of negative change - but might there be some areas that see benefit?""  For example, deserts could get more rain therefore reverting back to forests or arable land.  You then jumped to the conclusion that deserts will change to seas, and therefore all desert creatures will drown.  How could that possibly be good?  See what you did there?  Regarding coral, have you seen this 2014 study that found that coral is being primarily impacted by fishing and sewage and not by warmer climate/acidification?  By the way, NASA believes that the science points to heat waves (as a result of global warming/climate change).

Climate change, or human-caused climate change, is something that is happening on a very short time scale now. As in, a couple hundred years time to do something that might otherwise have occurred naturally over hundreds of thousands of years (or longer).  So what are the chances that the very real and dramatic changes to our climate are caused by human beings? Near 100%. Practically indisputable.   Things are changing so rapidly that the lifeforms on this planet will not have time to allow natural selection to allow them to adapt. 30% of species on the planet WILL be extinct by the end of the century.   The Amazon will become more like a desert and grasslands by the end of the century.  Coral reefs around the planet will die en masse, as will the lifeforms that depend upon them.

AskScienceDiscussion,378022,Solaterre,2,Mon May 25 21:48:37 2015 UTC,"Environmental Health effects of anything are much more difficult to determine than finding the toxicity of a single substance in animal experiments. Toxicologists usually base their findings by determining what levels of a chemical cause immediate or short term lethal doses of 50% of test subjects. Some small fraction of LD50 might be assumed to be a safe dosage.   Other evidence of extreme damage might also be considered. Long term testing that also evaluates pregnancy, fetal, and nursing animal health will yield more information on effects.  The real long term effects of anything would vary greatly on a wide variety of conditions. Individual people have a multitude of specific sensitivities to many ""safe"" substances: peanuts, wheat, dairy products, shellfish, eggplant and hundreds of healthy and nutritious foods could harm or even kill certain people. Combinations of different chemicals which individually are harmless can become toxic when mixed. At different periods of development or with certain deficiencies we are much more sensitive to environmentsl factors. Then there are are more subtile effects that are not even evaluated in animal studies. A rat feeling discomfort, anxiety, depression or the loss of several IQ points or mental problems wouldn't be observed in common studies. The disruption of healthful bacteria and other microorganisms in our digestive tracts have been implicated in a number of disorders which are not likely to be evaluated in testing for animal toxicity. Beyond direct health effects pesticide, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers and monocultured crops are part of systems that can reduce soil health, fertility, ability to absorb water and resist erosion as well as reduce the levels of many nutrients in the produce. Water pollution and the wellbeing of natural predators and pollenators are also not considered when saying that something is not toxic to humans. At minimum labeling should allow people to chose what they consume and be able to respond to something that affects their health by understanding what they have been exposed to. The problems with very powerful  wealthy entities as corporations and research institutions that own numerous patents that have millions in profits at risk, contribute significant amounts to politicians, and have employees in charge of regulations is that unbiased critical studies have an uphill battle in proving harm. Leaded gasoline was sold for nearly 50 years as a harmless product that was the essential for high performance and engine life because critics and alternatives could not prevail against the combined financial and political power of Standard Oil, DuPont and General Motors, the owner of the EthylGasoline Corporation. Monsanto, Syngerta, DuPont, Bayer, the Regents of the University of California and other corporations and institutions in agribusiness control billions and our food supplies so they can wield enormous power against critics.

Humans are on the order of 100 meters (the average human is 1.7 meters tall), which isn't close enough to the middle to suggest it's anything but coincidence. In the video, he claims the middle point is the length of a ""brain cell,"" but neurons are highly variable in size, reaching from around 10-4 meters to around 1 meter. You could certainly find cells in a human body that are around this midway point, but there's no reason to think there's anything special about one particular cell; if the world is perceptual as you're speculation, it seems like our perceptions should be based on the size of our body as a whole.  It's also worth noting that there's nothing special about the obversable universe, and that the universe as a whole is probably much larger than that (and may in fact be infinite). Our observable universe is just the area from which light has had time to reach us since the big bang. This area will continue to change with time.  Even if we did fall exactly in the middle of the Planck length and the observable universe in size, that doesn't mean the universe is purely perceptional, since coincidences do happen all the time.

So you ended up harvesting that south side of the north hill two months late. Now you're putting effectively four times as much Foo in every tea, so the maximum strength tea has effectively got the equivalent Foo of 48 leaves instead of twelve per ounce. The heavy drinkers are now stressing and even damaging their livers with Foo poisioning. They blame their ""stressful environment"" and decide they need a littp more Foo, and double down on the ""all natural and therefore harmless"" product and land on the liver transplant list.  And it may not be the ""Foo"" but the fact that some particular plants are picking up a particular heavy metal from a particular patch of earth where it is over abundant.  I am not over stating this.  And in the lessor cases, which are far more common, do you really know how much of what is in that baggie from your herbalist?  In an industrial process there is a lot of math going on. Taking a super simple example: We know that water, being H2O is two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen. If we wanted to make water in the lab we'd know that we need exactly that much of those substances to make one mole of water. And we know what one mole of water weighs and how big it is. So we know we aren't accidentally making hydrochloric acid because we know there isn't a mole of chlorine going into the mixer anywhere.  The same things goes all complex chemistry. But, absent quality controls, that all natural infusion of herbs is know to have zero poison sumac? Or how about just a little dandelion leaf? A touch more roach castings?  Without the quality controls there is absolutely no way to say.  As a side note... Asbestos is an ""all natural product"". People mistake ""all natural"" for ""safe"" and ""good for you"" all the time. Nature is a dangerous place and most of nature is involved in chemical warfare with its peers. Caffeine, for example, is a natural pesticide. Nicotine is so effective at that job that we distill it from some plants and spray it on others. Virtually all of the alkaloids we find in plants are naturally evolved pesticides and so have toxic effects on the human body at even mildly incorrect dosage.  The poison is in the dosage, so when people start marketing ""all natural"" anything and I don't see a quality control department I tend to steer clear. Quality Control is how we know the expected dosage is likely the actual dosage being dispensed.  Without it you are maybe getting nothing you paid for, or you may be getting so much more than you wanted... but no way to tell till the vomiting starts..."
AskScienceDiscussion,378suo,BitOBear,1 point,Mon May 25 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"Great comment ! I'm totally agree with you.   So often, little producers who produce natural products such as medicinal herbs or essential oils think that because they cultivate their own stuff without pesticides, their products are ''safe'' , ''natural'' , ''constant/stable'' and they don't need quality control. For them, quality control = loss of time and money.  When the quality control is done by a company is often by internal testing. They do their own quality control and they can see if there are problems in their products. But often, they didn't employ a person who has the necessary skills to understand how the quality control has to be done . So, they pick up a sample occasionnaly and analyse it and they say : ok, everything seems to be all right. They totally forget that natural compounds in plants can vary in the time and depending on environment."
AskScienceDiscussion,378suo,thrips47,2,Tue May 26 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"Quality control is always important. ""Natural"" is virtually meaningless, unless one is referring to colors, dyes, flavors, additives. What exactly is 'natural wood'? There is certainly fake wood, but then it is not wood, but a wood product. Is apple cider vinegar more 'natural' than distilled, just because it came from apples? The FDA has labeling regulations- diluted acetic acid is not vinegar, but distilled vinegar is made from fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. The ethanol in the US is most often distilled from corn. The QC from this starts at the beginning, with the raw product, and carried out to the very end so that every bottle of vinegar is the same as the last. Wine has vintages, but there is quality control from the beginning to end, from the grapes to the cork. Look what happened to GM with the breakdown of quality control in those ignition switches. ConAgra was just sued for millions for ignoring their own QC lab reports of salmonella in peanut butter. When you go buy raw materials for some project, like cooking, don't you look at each potato or onion before buying? If you buy motor oil, don't you want to be sure you are buying exactly what is on the label? A person doing QC on hot dogs, say a shelf life study, needs to know with certainty that his cultures won't be contaminated by the media, media made by another company. A doctor wants to know with certainty that the saw she's using for a knee replacement is of the proper metal and that a screw won't fall out.  I suggest you pick an item (or product) and track the whole life of that item. Start with something relatively simple, like cocao or oolong tea. And don't forget government regulations.

I worked there as a microbiologist, testing products for contamination.  I was hired by a new lab director who cared about doing things right.  However, the previous lab director very much did not.  Thanks to criminally lax legislation, thanks largely to Senator Orrin Hatch, this industry is almost completely free of responsibility to make sure they're actually selling what's on the label.  The previous lab director used to set his expiration dates by going across the street to WalMart and seeing what dates the competition were putting on their bottles, and then adding a few months.

AskScienceDiscussion,374vqj,nllpntr,6,Sun May 24 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the crazy thing: if you have a rope of a known length/density, a specific amount of energy is required to stretch it to that length, right? No matter how fast you pull, you will never be able to stretch it by exactly 2 feet in less than the minimum time it would take for that ""stretch wave"" to travel down the rope. The rope length will approach 2 ft longer as time approaches (distance / (speed of sound in rope)).  So yeah, it will be 2 feet longer eventually, but only if you efficiently apply the necessary force for a really long time. The total amount of stretching will have to be distributed evenly along the entire length of rope, and that takes time. Much more time than it takes for light to travel 8 light minutes.

Fair warning, I am drunk, and probably not articulate enough (nor academically qualified enough) to explain this well, BUT, a quick google calculation (which could easily be wrong) indicates that even a diamond rod that could reach the sun from earth would take almost 139 days to transmit a compression wave from one end to the other if you tapped one end with a hammer:  8 light minutes = 143,900,380 km Speed of sound in diamond = 12 km/s t = d / v = 143,900,380km * ( 1s / 12km) = 11,991,698s ~= 138.79 days    So yeah, in a way it really is like a scaled up slinky."

The rope didn't travel faster than light. It moved as fast as the dude on the other end pulled it. Light just happened to travel at the speed of light, so you saw what happened eight minutes later than when it happened. No laws of physics broke, and the rope didn't get longer.    If you still don't understand, let me draw a parallel:  Take a friend of yours and go to a field. You go one way, the friend goes the other way. You both go far away and make a distance between you that is so long you can barely see your friend at the other side of the field, hundreds and hundreds of feet away.  If your friend raises his arm to wave from where he is, and at the same time yells a greeting towards you, what will happen? Of course you'll see him raise his arm, some time will pass, and then you will hear his greeting.  This is because sound and light travel at different speeds, so you first saw the action, then the sound arrived, much later. It didn't make your friend a ventriloquist, it is just an audio-visual illusion.  Now, replace the field with the distance between the Earth and Sol.  Replace the sight of your friend with the rope.

AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,Lilyo,2,Sun May 24 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Here's a version of the thought that you might find interesting --  When I took my neuroscience courses originally (I'm now studying toward neurology), a thought that blew my mind was that decisions have already been made in your brain before you are consciously aware of having made the decision. I wish I remember the exact way they tested this, but I suspect it was some sort of functional MRI research where they could see the processing having been done prior to a person's being aware that they'd made a decision.  This has rather fascinating implications for consciousness in general, and suggests that consciousness is more ""feedback"" than the primary decision center. The common-place example of this is that when you are learning a skill, you are very conscious of what you are doing. After you've learned the skill and it becomes second-nature, you are no longer using much conscious willpower at all. A quote I remember well from classes is, ""the function of consciousness is to get rid of itself."""
AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,SynapticSight,1 point,Mon May 25 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah when you get down to the small biological physics behind any one single choice or action you can perform as an individual, you inevitably always run into the fact that there is always pre conscious activity in your brain that is influenced by a ton of outside factors that you have no conscious awareness of in order to make the action, and this then cascades onwards to the secondary functions such a conscious perception. Subliminal unconscious processing will always be an initiator in this case. I really like this quote by Harris ""Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do?""   http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/528136/searching-for-the-free-will-neuron/"

But in this light, I'm not entirely sure how to link it to your thought about simulation. So, maybe before I try, how would you define ""simulation?"""
AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,SynapticSight,1 point,Mon May 25 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I guess I would define it as the end output response to incoming synapse inputs based on whatever computational power the physical system has (in this case the brain, in another a computer). I'm saying there are physical constraints on any possible output response ANY system could perform, and so the upper end boundary of this system is where the ""simulation"" ends and you perform whatever many cognitive abilities you posses. An important factor I think is the fact that while performing any one action you aren't really aware of or thinking about a million other things, ""you"" at the moment of choice are a very narrow section of information. Think about it, you don't think about for example what every person in Istanbul is currently doing at this time, or that the capital of Canada is Ottawa, or that your neighbor wore a red shirt yesterday, etc. you just have a narrow window of computation and you do just that, and retrieve other information if it's relevant or not. You chose to eat a hamburger over a hot dog, you have 2 cups of coffee instead of one, you think of a random city in a random country in the world, you respond to ""How's your day been?"", etc. , and you do these without taking the conscious time to think about every single factor that influences and shapes your responses.   This is what Harris means by ""Thoughts and intentions simply arise in the mind. What else could they do?"". If for example you sit down in silence for half an hour or an hour you'll see that it's not actually possible to stop your mind from thinking randomly about things. You experience it while walking down the street, while contemplating, while not being distracted, and many other times throughout your day, we are simply used to it and able to largely phase it out. Stuff simply pops into consciousness and you pick it up in perception, and you can deliberate, evaluate, and posses knowledge of instinctual and unconscious motifs and act accordingly using this knowledge which inevitably creates a information feedback loop.    E: there was some info on this http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/harris/   ""And we know that the brain systems that allow us to reflect upon our experience are different from those involved when we automatically react to stimuli. So consciousness, in this sense, is not inconsequential. And yet the entire process of becoming aware of the pain in my back, thinking about it, and seeking a remedy for it results from processes of which I am completely unaware. Did I, the conscious person, create my pain? No. It simply appeared. Did I create the thoughts about it that led me to consider physical therapy? No. They, too, simply appeared. This process of conscious deliberation, while different from unconscious reflex, offers no foundation for freedom of will...""

AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,medbud,1 point,Tue May 26 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Thinking is a distinct phenomena from the chemicals and brain activity correlated to thinking. For example, even if you think of a sound or song you've heard before and you're ""hearing"" it in your mind, the fact is that there is NO sound in your brain. If you think of a visual image, well, there is NO image in the brain, because there is no light in the brain.     So one question might be, 'How do you simulate physical phenomena, such as sounds and visuals, make them subjectively perceivable, but not objectively perceivable?'  'How do you create subjectivity out of an objective system, such as a computer?'   'Can a computer simulate emotions?' 'Can a computer have an emotional experience?'   I'm sure a computer can simulate the behavior associated with emotional expression.. but that does not mean that it's having a subjective experience of emotional ""feelings"" as we humans do.

Here's a related study regarding auditory perception for example in schizophrenics.   Auditory hallucinations such as those experienced by schizophrenics (distinct than recalling a song in your head) are linked to multiple areas of the brain, primarily the auditory cortex (responsible for ""outside"" sounds) and Broca's area along with other parts of the frontal lobe (responsible for ""inner"" sounds). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757313/"

Evolution has agglomerated chemical structures into 'life forms', more or less complex. At a human level, refined cellular structures are specialized to receive vibratory information at different scales (wavelengths)...rods and cones for light, nerves for touch, pain, smell...and sound. The frequencies we perceive and have been selected for through evolution enable survival and reproduction. CNS neural structures that analyse, filter, and interpret signals from the senses do so in various time scales. What we perceive as the 'present' is a constructed reality of asynchronous events that have been ordered very quickly by neural structures, and presented back to the CNS as a coherent episodic (10x/second) narrative.

AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,hieroglyfix,-2,Mon May 25 09:07:56 2015 UTC,"Consciousness is a fundamental, first principle, physical law of the universe that emerges whenever information is present.  Information Integration Theory is a form of panpsychism.   The integration of information from many sources is an important feature of consciousness, and as noted above (section 6.4) it often cited as one of its major functions. Content integration plays an important role in various theories especially global workspace theory (section 9.3). However, a proposal by the neuroscientist Giulio Tononi (2008) goes further in identifying consciousness with integrated information and asserting that information integration of the relevant sort is both necessary and sufficient for consciousness regardless of the substrate in which is realized which need not be neural or biological. According to Tononi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT), consciousness is a purely information-theoretic property of systems. He proposes a mathematical measure φ that aims to measure not merely the information in the parts of a given system but also the information contained in the organization of the system over and that in its parts which thus corresponds to the system's degree of informational integration. Such a system can contain many overlapping complexes and the complex with the highest φ value will be conscious according to IIT.  According to IIT, consciousness varies in quantity and comes in many degrees which correspond to φ values. Thus even a simple system such a single photo diode will be conscious to some degree if it not contained within a larger complex. In that sense, IIT implies a form of panpsychism that Tononi explicitly endorses. According to IIT, the quality of the relevant consciousness is determined by the totality of informational relations within the relevant integrated complex. Thus IIT aims to explain both the quantity and quality of phenomenal consciousness. Other neuroscientists, notably Christof Koch, have also endorsed the IIT approach (Koch 2012)."

Furthermore, you still have not shown how you get consciousness from a piece of meat.  Until you do, you only have a hypothesis.

Major explanatory gaps like this are evident in your ""theory"" of consciousness.

AskScienceDiscussion,3745zn,SynapticSight,2,Sun Jun 14 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds nice and all but it really only amounts to a bunch of pseudoscientific filler. Allow me to explain, point by point.  First, your analogy is simply one from ignorance. The reality is that brain deterioration does not just correlate with ""less obvious consciousness,"" or ""consciousness seen through a smaller and blurrier window"" or whatever. What actually happens is that specific parts of the brain are lost and these result in very specific functional deficits. We know quite a lot about the various circuits and how they are disrupted. The functions of those circuits are disrupted when the circuit is disrupted. Nothing more, nothing less. For your argument to fit reality, you would have to believe that consciousness is somehow channeled from elsewhere into these circuits and then into our personality, such that disruption of those circuits disrupts our personality. Aside from sounding totally absurd, it also doesn't pass the test of Occam's razor.  Second, your objection about ""consciousness from a piece of meat"" is patently unscientific and ridiculous. No, as a matter of fact I do not have to have a complete explanation (although we pretty much do) for me to rule out mysticism and magical things. You are applying nothing more than a god of the gaps fallacy here, and it's totally unimpressive not to mention unpersuasive. It is your claim that has no scientific basis whatsoever -- to assert that the mind is a window to someplace else, offer no evidence, and then draw a false equivalence between your assertion and a physically-based one by lamely saying, ""hah, we just need more research!"", is absurd. And not how science works.  Third, your point about ""mechanisms giving rise to subjective experience"" is again an argument from ignorance. As a matter of fact, we have ways to assess awareness -- like the mirror self-recognition test -- and have correlated these findings with neurons that we call ""mirror neurons,"" among other things. Sure, the research is by no means complete, I fully grant that -- but to fill the gaps with pseudoscience is not intellectually honest. It would be like saying that, because we do not have a comprehensive timeline that shows all of human evolution (and we don't -- there are gaps!), that therefore evolution is somehow in question and alternate hypotheses like intelligent design totally hold merit. Nope, nope, no. No.  Lastly, I think it's appropriate that you end your post in the way you do, because it gives away your entire arugment in one line. You're right, we don't know everything.

Hence more research is being done to find out.  In addition, meditational traditions (which always maintained that consciousness is more fundamental than matter) were initially dismissed as bunk because they claimed that modulating consciousness (i.e., meditating) could affect neurophysiology. However, continuing research produced overwheling scientific evidence that meditation does indeed have significant, measurable, positive effects on neurophysiology. And despite being relatively early-days, already the evidential basis for the benefits of neuromodulatory practices is very robust in the medical literature.

I'm not sure the exact mechanism, but I know in terms of motor movement, you suppress it while you sleep I wouldn't be surprised if you also suppressed the majority of auditory/visual information. You also have high levels of adenosine which wipe out most memory of what you experience while you sleep. It's feasible, you are 'hearing' fine just not encoding anything at all. It's probably a combination of the two, though sleep and sensory information isn't really my area of expertise and not widely studied enough that I'd have heard about it. (Though sleep and memory is pretty well studied right now)  As to experiment two. The subject of arousal and memory is an interesting one. When you learn when in an adrenaline rush, you encode more detail and likely as a consequence your memories are likely over generalized. (Digging back to first year psych here, this isn't exactly my subject and I haven't seen any talks on it lately so please ignore my tag on the next bit.) When you are trying to recall difficult information, or work through a difficult problem, higher arousal helps you (to an extent). When trying to work through lower difficulty or well trained easy to recall problems, higher arousal hurts you. So if you were in a situation where you had to recall scattered or not well learned information, you might recall better if you were excited. That being said, in light of the first studies which showed you can't encode anything, even super simple and heavily redundant information, while sleeping, Experiment 2 wouldn't work."
AskScienceDiscussion,37384r,cdcox,3,Sun May 24 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"I have narcolepsy (likely irrelevant to this discussion, but always a fun ""party topic"" ... I happen to have the ultra-rare Status Cataplecticus variant of narcolepsy with cataplexy). I'm not sure how familiar you are with the particular neurological ""quirks"" of narcolepsy but our entire sleep/wake distinctions are disrupted due to lack of orexin, and this is what causes the wide range of disordered sleep/wake states from sleep paralysis to hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations to cataplexy. I'm always curious how research like this on sleep might differ if patients with narcolepsy were tested, particularly because we have several states where we're sort of ""straddling"" both sleep and wakefulness simultaneously. Since I know I can be asleep but carry out basic motor functions and well-ingrained behaviors (automatic behavior), and I can also be somewhat awake but still have dreams kind of ""layered"" on top of my conscious observation of my environment (hypnagogic hallucinations), intuitively it seems to me that I very well might be able to learn novel things while ""asleep."" Also there's the fact that unlike healthy people, those of us with narcolepsy are much less likely to forget our dreams upon awakening."

For example, I won't wake up to footsteps or the general talking sounds of my family, but if someone were to say my name while in the same room with me that would most probably awaken me even if it's in a low and non disturbing tone.

AskScienceDiscussion,372asz,graaahh,4,Sun May 24 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"In today's world, the answer is ""not much.""   Although artificial hearts exist, their efficacy has been surpassed by methods of repairing an existing heart (e.g. heart valve replacements, coronary bypass, pace makers). If a heart is in need of a complete replacement, organ donation is preferred over artifical hearts.  I honestly cannot think of any other major organs that can be replaced by machine today. I suppose an argument can be made for a continuous monitoring insulin pump as a replacement for a pancreas, but it isn't a true, complete replacement. (The patient still has to tweak it to meet his/her needs.) Artificial joints exist; I suppose one could have his/her knees, hips, shoulders, etc all replaced, but quality of life would stink. Going back to the heart idea, artifical valves are an option, but porcine (made from a pig's heart valves) valves are preferred in most cases. Of course, prostethics exist, but in today's technology they aren't at the complete replacement stage.   One last thing to mention is heart/lung bypass machines. They can do what their name implies, but not as a permanent solution. It's a temporary fix suitable for major surgery.   Source: 17 years experience in the medical device industry.

At least, that's my hunch, without doing any simulations. So realistically, the second moon would probably have to be significantly smaller than our current one.

Though when dealing with photons it's unwise to use the simplified equation of E=mc2. The real equation is E2 = m2 c4 + p2 c2 .  Where p is the momentum of the system.

AskScienceDiscussion,36zk65,The_Wisenheimer,3,Sun May 24 12:59:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, your book is wrong. Photons have zero mass.  Back in the day (like, the early 1900s) people used to talk about relativistic mass, which was basically the mass equivalent of an object's total energy. Sometimes when they'd say ""mass"" they meant relativistic mass, as your book seems to do, and sometimes they'd mean rest mass, which is the thing that is zero for photons. In modern terminology, we don't use ""mass"" to refer to relativistic mass anymore. Instead of talking about relativistic mass, we just talk about energy."
AskScienceDiscussion,36zk65,neuropean,10,Sun May 24 06:19:00 2015 UTC,"Photons do not have REST MASS.  That means, when a particle has no momentum, it will have no mass.  Photons obviously cannot be brought to a standstill (they travel at the speed c from emission to absorption), but theoretically, if their movement were halted, they would have zero mass.  But remember, E=Mc2 defines energy as equivalent to mass, and photons do have energy.  Because of this, in particle physics, discrete mass is often ignored and included in the total energy of the particle.  You can measure this in units of energy (Joules) or units of mass (kg).  They are interchangeable.  For many of the equations of subatomic physics, you need to know the total mass or energy of the particle, so the difference between rest mass and energy is irrelevant."

AskScienceDiscussion,371rut,cdcox,2,Sun May 24 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'd argue there are three primary types of 'foundation shaking' theories/experiments. The first is the foundation building theory, it's one where a lot of previously disorganized information suddenly comes together in a very elegant way. These make strong testable hypotheses and solve incredibly complex problems in simple, elegant ways. The periodic table, the GHK equations for neurons, and the double helix all accomplish this.  The other type is the type that proves what a lot of people are pursuing is wrong or a waste of time. Or it shows that something no one even knew existed was worth pursuing. This is like the Golgi Drawings of Cajal and Golgi (which basically established the synaptic and neuronal doctrines), the experiment that found that DNA, not protein, carries information, the discovery of the proton as a central mass, and Koch's posulates. All of these showed that most of the stuff that had come before was in some way lacking or looking at things the wrong way.  The third, and I'd argue rarest, is when someone (or group of someones) makes an invention that was totally impossible that changes the world. I can only think of a small handful of these, like the airplane, fission, the first computer, or penicillin. The only rule here seems to be there is no rule.   There are a lot of fields that are anxiously waiting for the first type of discovery. Neuroscience would love a unified theory of how networks of neurons think. Biology would love an elegant theory of protein translation or how protein networks work in cells. It's hard to say if either field will get it soon, as both could be 'asking the wrong questions' or looking at the wrong things or indeed, it's feasible have hit a 'complexity limit' where simple theories no longer play. At which point a massive organizing principle out of complexity science seems the most likely next revolution.  The second type is much harder to predict as they tend to come out of the blue. I'd say they usually only come in fields with more established information, so seeing something like that out of biology or neuroscience is unlikely (As there are so few foundations to overturn).  I doubt it will be something we've been looking for forever as most of the paths one could take to it have been exhausted. Grand unified theories have been approached from every angle possible, at this point new information is needed to make a good claim. Similarly, everyone has believed they are right on the verge of AI for the last 200 years, it's very unlikely anyone will make a discovery in that area that everyone has just 'missed'.  The third type of invention is rare and it's hard to say if anything like that is likely to emerge. If it were, it would almost certainly be in an area no one predicted and it might even do something seemingly pointless or field specific for a while until it gets adapted to it's true use. It could be made out of easy to buy, slightly modified existing tools (like the plane was) or it might be made out of a huge amount of money at a secret government institute, like the nuclear bomb was. These kinds of things seem impossible to predict."

While many (actually most) are life threatening if not corrected, they are easily recognized at birth and either corrected or closely monitored until treatment (usually a surgical procedure) is administered.

I tried to look up statistics and found this from cdc.gov   The prevalence (the number of babies born with heart defect compared to the total number of births) of some CHDs, especially mild types, is increasing, while the prevalence of other types has remained stable. The most common type of heart defect is a ventricular septal defect (VSD).3,4   Also this, from this summary   The prevalence of all CHDs in aggregate increased from 50.3 per 10,000 in 1978–1983 to 86.4 per 10,000 in 2000–2005. The prevalence of septal defects and vascular rings increased and the prevalence of tricuspid atresia decreased, while other CHD prevalences were stable.   I wonder why some types are increasing and others aren't, and why tricuspid atresia in particular is decreasing?  Perhaps it's not genetic, but caused primarily by other factors like poor nutrition or missing nutrients?  On the other hand, this page says it's genetic.   The heart begins to form when a fetus is just 8 weeks old. During this period of growth, failure of the tricuspid valve to develop will result in tricuspid atresia. Doctors do not know what causes this to occur. Tricuspid atresia is often common in families (hereditary) and is associated with certain genetic or chromosomal abnormalities including Down syndrome.   Why would it be decreasing in prevalence if it was genetic and we can treat it?  Oh, wait.  This says it still has a high mortality rate even with surgical intervention.  Possibly medical recommendations that people avoid reproducing are more effective in cases like this where the children do survive to adulthood?  Although, Huntington's still exists, so who knows...  ....okay that's a stream of consciousness post, but I'm leaving it.  Thanks for the answer!"

That the speed of light is also not constant in translation is obscured by the illusion created by the local clock slowing down with velocity for the very same reason.  This is the root of a potential error with all of Einstein's thought experiments - the rate of passage of time is linked to the speed of light. As soon as one has a set of reference clocks that are unaffected by the speed of light, the variable speed of light becomes obvious and the entire concept of the relativity of time becomes questionable.

AskScienceDiscussion,36xvbf,TezzieBr,3,Sat May 23 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting question, and I am sorry your tutor vastly over-simplified the answer. It is true that inter-cellular space is nearly nonexistent, as the role of an epithelium is as a barrier. But, it is not true that they only excrete substances. Epithelial cells can express a myriad of transporters, ion channels, and pores that allow all sorts of different things into, out of, and through the epithelial cells. It varies based on the epithelial type in question.  I am wondering one thing, though: to me, the epithelium I think of last is the skin (I research the urinary bladder for a living). The questions you bring up here seem to be related to ""transport"" across the epidermis' stratum corneum (outer layer of skin) and not an epithelium in the more general sense.  The stratum corner is a pretty tight barrier against a lot of stuff, but it is still made up of cells with hydrophobic membranes...so many hydrophobic compounds and lipophilic small molecules are more than happy to alter the cell membrane stiffness and pliability and/or pass right through. Thus, most of the moisturizers you use aren't really imparting water, per se...but imparting elasticity and flexibility.   As far as the patches and lead and mercury and stuff? Some patches increase permeability chemically, some have special formulations of the drugs that allow them to pass through the cells, and some just rely on simple diffusion of tiny molecules that are intrinsically capable of passing through the skin. The heavy metals you speak of, as inorganic ions, aren't particularly well-absorbed (IMO)...however, organic molecules containing lead and mercury are EXTREMELY well-absorbed through the stratum corneum and EXTREMELY toxic. Again, this is because of the lipophilicity of the organic compound and thus it's ability to basically pass right through the cell membranes."

I have worked with 8th graders and I found that what really gets their interest, if you are doing hands-on stuff, is something close to ""home"". Because this age group doesn't have a deep background, as would a group of AP Physics students, you can pretty much start from the bottom. You could start them on food safety by having them swab and culture their own kitchens (can opener, faucet handle, floor) and go from there- this is real world- e.g.ConAgra just got fined millions for a salmonella cover up in peanut butter. Perhaps a field trip to a wetlands; you could study the challenges of human caused influence (exotic species, water, diversion of natural drainage systems). Effects of climate change on the 'small' things (e.g.https://www.hcn.org/issues/47.5/the-case-of-the-snotty-streams). The concerns of global (or nearer to home) travel around the introduction of insects, plants, fish, microorganisms (not just Ebola, and that isn't even the scariest, hoof and mouth disease, enzootic/epizootic) into new environments (pick one, or a few).

AskScienceDiscussion,36w52h,WebMaka,2,Sun Jun 7 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to separate faith from religion, as ""religion"" is just an organized system of belief but faith is what underpins that system of belief to begin with...  My take has always been that faith is supposed to explain what science cannot, and as science finds answers to humanity's grander questions those questions are supposed to move from one domain to the other. For example, the sun was worshiped as a deity (and/or deities created to represent it) until we figured out what stars are. Those with the wisdom to consider science and faith as partners just rolled with it and went ""oh, well, guess that yellow dwarf isn't a deity after all."" Usually the fight to preserve the old beliefs in view of new scientific understanding that contrasts with them was promulgated by religious leaders whose positions of power and authority would be harmed by such improvements in understanding, and not because of any genuinely legitimate concern - this is not the fault of science or faith but solely in the attitudes of those that stood to lose out.  Ultimately, science can never completely explain an infinite universe (and we're not even getting into multiverse theories, etc.), so there will always be a place for faith. The Bible essentially defines faith as an assurance of the existence and validity of the unseen, and science by definition cannot test the unseen, so the things science cannot test have to go somewhere and that somewhere is faith. However, faith is not supposed to be blind - it's supposed to be based on an understanding of the concepts and doctrines upon which the faith is hung.  The principle arguments in science versus belief/faith/religion usually boil down to both sides digging in and refusing to accept that the answer actually lies between, that both scientific and spiritual views have merit and the combination of the two explains all."

AskScienceDiscussion,36w52h,MJMurcott,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:44:53 2015 UTC,"I wanted to decouple 'faith' from 'religion' because the two terms are often used interchangeably but are not the same thing...  Faith is not a better (read: more accurate) answer, but faith -is- a better (read: more comforting) answer. As was mentioned in ""Men In Black,"" while a person might be smart, people collectively are ""dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it."" While a faith-based answer to an unknown might not be -accurate-, it is generally more -comforting- to use an inaccurate or even patently absurd (especially in hindsight, and even more so in light of scientific discovery) explanation for the unknown rather than to admit a lack of knowledge.   There are a lot of reasons throughout human history that ""I don't know"" is a horrifying prospect, such as the perception of weakness if the absence of understanding comes from a leader or ruler, or even simple fear of the unknown in the most direct sense. Faith has helped many civilizations get through the intellectual dark times of no understanding, and once science can fill in the blanks and intellectual understanding shifts from one to the other, the light shines brighter from both.  Now if people could only come to the understanding that to die for one's faith is noble but to kill for one's faith is disgusting. Yahweh, the deity of Judaism and Christianity, bluntly stated, ""vengeance is MINE, I shall repay,"" thus indicating who has the right to the legitimate use of force under those religious constructs at least.

It's less of an actual Biblical thing and more of a culture thing and people sticking to what they grew up with.  The main biblical ""apostle"", or figurehead, named Paul would have told Christians to study both sides and come up with a logical conclusion. Hell, one of his most shining moments was praising people he was interacting with for fact checking what he was saying in the Old Testament.  In any circumstance, when we take away free thought then we lose any truth we might have had at any point.

You say ""generally"" but I would argue that I have seen opponents on both sides.   If someone wants to believe in an imaginary friend and doesn't want to do anything to harm anyone else there is no problem, but when they want to do harm that is a problem.

No people on both sides don't equally antagonise each other, the vast majority of the time it is the religions which are making the mischief. Considering the role of religions as that of an imaginary friend is exactly the status  that they should be given, there is no proof that any of them exist more than an imaginary friend and the presence of so many of them and them being mutually antagonistic means that even if one of them is correct the vast majority of them are wrong or just imaginary. With that being the case when you think about laws concerning religions it helps if you use imaginary friend as a way of seeing if religions influence is acceptable because that takes the emotional bias of a particular faith out of the issue.  My imaginary friend says I should pray to them - free society feel free to do this if you want.  My imaginary friend says that I should be kind to others - that is very nice of you certainly carry on.  My imaginary friend says that everyone must believe in my imaginary friend or be killed - No way   My imaginary friend says that the world was created only 8000 years ago and this must be taught in schools - No way  My imaginary friend says that girls should be denied education because only boys should be educated - No way"

I personally believe that all modern religions were derived from well-intended people with a desire to teach and instruct on less destructive and more harmonious lifestyles, but the only way that this could be easily done over massive distances and from radically different people by using ideas that crossed entire cultures (natural disasters, death, corruption, etc...; God is just a personification of these forces), instead of rational arguments which may not translate across cultures and languages as they may not have experienced them before.  In my opinion comparing science and religion is pointless because they both seek to answer different questions and solve different problems. Science seeks to understand the unknown, religion seeks to teach a better, or what was believed to be, lifestyle using the unknown as a catalyst for the idea.  I am personally not a religious man, but I don't feel that they are mutually exclusive concepts. They're both fully rational in their own contexts."

Or just another copy of you, and the prior you is effectively dead?     Most seem to agree that if you transfer your brain to another body it's still you.  So, then, taking it apart and rebuilding it ought to be you as well, right?  But what intrinsic property of those atoms make you ""you?""  Why does it matter that we use the same atoms in order for your original consciousness to re-emerge? And at what point would it no longer be you?

In fact, what you think of as consciousness is ever changing, so the very act of copying would invalidate its accuracy.  However, if we ignore the minutia and look at your probable intent I think we end up in a couple interesting quandaries.  Our memories are not stored like a computer would store them.  I'm not educated and I'm sure there are better ways of saying it, but our brain's long term memory uses a kind of compression.  As we sleep, our brains rerun through all of the day's short term memories.  It finds similar and related information and links those with the new events.  Over time, details get morphed by the newly added information as well as emotional reinterpretations.  Long story short, only a memory system that works like yours would derive anything similar to what you derive form the information.  But, lets say that we find a way to run you into a sleep state and run your brain through all of its information.  We could possibly record that and be able to get a reasonable dataset that knows what you knew at the time of the recording and your current emotional interpretations thereof.  But now what?  Can it respond like you would?  It would have to both receive and develop equivalent emotional responses from the environment.  It would then have to bend its awareness of and emotional interpretations in the same way as you do so that it could respond similar to how you would.  So short answer:  Nope, not gonna happen!"

You are not your consciousness, ""you"" exist within consciousness through perception, but you are still a mind and the mind is what the brain does, and there is nothing in modern neuroscience that indicates otherwise. A common misconception is our intuitive notion that what you see and experience second to second is defined as ""a conscious agent looking outwards on the physical world, within the physical world"", but this is not true since everything you ""see"" in front of your eyes and experience is a model rendered in your mind, the entirety of which is constructed instant to instant in your brain. A better way to think of consciouses is ""finding yourself moment to moment in a specific situation while remembering the past on a linear timeline"".   Since we are physical objects you couldn't transfer your specific self to another body since this is only recreating your self, which will be just fine from the perspective of that new copy. There doesn't seem to be much indication of being able to split up the brain from the mind, this is simply an inaccurate understanding of these things. An important aspect that comes into play regarding our understanding of electronic consciousness is the implication of modern cognitive neuropsychology indicating that conventional notions of free will aren't compatible with the way the brain works, which really does mean that every action that we can manifest is within a ""repertoire of actions"" that we posses at any one point, and every choice you are capable of making will always be influenced by outside factors that are beyond your control or apparent ""free will"".

AskScienceDiscussion,36sbz9,hgli,7,Thu May 21 18:56:37 2015 UTC,That is a fascinating question because of the answers implications. If you were to raise an infant(a baby would be best) from the stone age it would function perfectly in our time. The differences from an evolutionary point are minimal to non-existing. All that is needed is the ability to speak an listen in order to be exposed to our culture.  In fact there are theories that people that were born before roughly 1900 and - that probably includes people from stone age -  have on average higher IQs than we living right now. Reason being the contamination of our environment with lead - a nerve toxin. Exposure to lead is known to reduce the average IQ of exposed populations(there are many studies of lead mines)  The implications are great because that means we as a species have not progressed trough our evolution but through our culture. That means that if our culture were to disappear we would be literally right back to the stone age. So the reverse question is even more interesting. If you were to drop babies from today in the stone age it would probably do fine from a stone age point of view but it would also not do anything special  compared to its peers once it grows up.

AskScienceDiscussion,36sbz9,LogicalIntuition,1 point,Fri May 22 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"I personally do not find that question(""When do you start to call an individual ""homo sapiens""?) very interesting since most of it comes down to more or less arbitrary definitions.  We consider homo sapiens to be at least 100,000 years old. Most likely much older(200,000+). During that time a lot can change. However the only period of significant evolution(we know of) was before homo sapiens left Africa(60,000). After that time the idea is that the cultural evolution was much more important since it happened at a faster pace. Just think of how fast language changes. Take the last 500 years where we even had cultural tools(like writing, reading, schools...) that all should in theory preserve the language at least to some extend. And yet the change is pretty big. There is no way evolution can keep up with these rates."

Your best bet is to read up on pKa to learn about how different acids behave and how we can figure out if they are likely to react with a given base.   For the ATP question, energy is stored within the chemical bonds themselves. It requires energy to create a bond, and so breaking that bond releases that energy. The more bonds that can be broken, the more energy a molecule has. Different kinds of bond require different amounts of energy to form as well, and so release different amounts of energy.

(Luke, I am your father..).  You probably think about it just fine in your head but for someone who's confused with the concept, this explanation really throws people off.  Creating a bond (from the constituent atoms) always releases energy, either thermally or radiatively.  Otherwise, everything would happily exist as atoms.  Molecules exist because bond formation releases energy and that energy is not easily available to drive the reaction in the other directly.  If it were, you'd be in a plasma or some other exotic state of matter.  Reactions like combustion happen because the bonds in the products leave the atoms in a lower energy state than the bonds in the reactants.  You still need to inject energy into the system to break bonds (bond creation releases energy - therefore bond destruction requires it) and that's your activation energy before the reaction can drive itself.  I'm going to ignore endothermic reactions because those are weird and are entropically driven but those aren't relevant to the ATP scenario here.  ATP has extremely weak bonds.  It takes phosphorus which is pentavalent and has electron pairs and sticks them in sequence, right next to a bunch of oxygens.  When hydrolyzed, one of these phosphate groups falls out into a more stable inorganic phosphate which has a bunch of resonance structures and hence more stable.  This releases energy overall."

Protonation - how is that H+ Ions seem to do so much damage to proteins, why are there reactions where Protonation happens as a part of an enzymatic reaction and where it's absolutely crucial to the function of the enzyme (Serin-Proteases for example) and why is it that although H+ Ions seem to be everywhere, they only latch onto some molecules and not others?   I would wager that H+ ions do so much damage because they are very elecronegative (See: Slater's Rules for more info). Put an H+ near something, it's pretty likely that electrons will move in some way to react with that H+. Considering the relative size of a protein, there's something there that will respond poorly to that particular reaction. That said, there can certainly be opposites of this, where the H+ is necessary for proper function.   As for why they don't always react, some molecules don't have the ability to donate any electrons to the ion, and as such, it won't react. Classic example is HCl, put it in water and the HCl suddenly decomposes into an aqueous solution of H+ and Cl- ions, the reason being that chlorine is highly electronegative as well; due to a combination of factors which are somewhat complex, but essentially boil down to 'it has a lot of protons and the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons is strong', enough so that the ion won't reattach to the chlorine, but will instead attach to the much easier target (water).   Electron interaction - I think this ties in with the Protonation question and probably with the conservation of energy one too - what do lone pairs of electrons do other than influence bonding angles (in H2O) for example? Why are they so important and what is their function or how do they interact? It just baffles me.   You're right in thinking it ties in with the protonation question, because it's essentially the other half of the protonation question. Say you have two molecules, one with an electron pair way out at the fringe of the molecule, and one with a boron or something at the fringe. On their own, those molecules are perfectly stable and happy. Put them close to each other, and that electron pair is going to see that the boron is relatively electropositive (desires negative charge), and it will react with it. If I remember correctly, this is basically how polymerization works. I think. Don't quote me on that. But this is only the surface, there are a lot of things that electron pairs do that I haven't mentioned, or don't know of.  .

If you're comfortable with the idea of electric fields (a vector field), electric potential (a scalar field) and the properties of dipoles in general, you can begin to mentally substitute electrons/lone-pairs with dipoles and start thinking about how ions can gain/lose energy in an electric potential field where the background is set up by relatively unaffected nuclei/core-electrons and all the moving/bending/reconfigurable stuff comes from the valence electrons interacting with this background potential.

And lastly, the other person answers ""I mean that the dots are moving further apart.""  It's not an explanation, but a 1=1 identity claim."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,avabit,2,Thu May 21 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the question of ""What does it mean"" is different from ""What is causing it.""  When you asked ""What does it mean when we say a balloon is expanding?"" the answer would be something like ""its volume is increasing and so is its surface."" If you wanted to get technical, you could describe the ratio of the surface to volume expansion, but I don't know it offhand.   However, if you asked ""What is causing the balloon to expand?"", that is a different question with a different answer, something along the lines of ""someone is forcing air into it by blowing in the hole.""  As far as what is causing the expansion of the universe, it's probably momentum from the big bang and dark energy.   If you want to ask what caused the big bang, that's a rabbit hole, and if you want to ask what dark energy is, it's something that we don't understand at all."

AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,diazona,3,Thu May 21 08:33:00 2015 UTC,"All that's happening is that the distance between every thing in the universe is increasing, and not because they are moving away from each other.   My understanding is that physicists have observed this phenomenon and attempted to explain it as being caused by the universe expanding.   No, the increase in distances is not something caused by the expansion of the universe - it is the expansion of the universe."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,Felicia_Svilling,1 point,Thu May 21 10:46:16 2015 UTC,"I made an illustration of it a while ago. It's an infinite pond with underwater pipes that pump water into this pond from unspecified external source. Here: Imgur. Russian text below says: ""Uniform pumping of water"".   When this happens, distance between ducks increases even though ducks don't swim anywhere relative to the water right under them. This is how the Universe ""expands"". And the farther the ducks were initially, the faster the distance between them increases — this is exactly the Hubble law. Every meter becomes a bit bigger. The more meter there were, the more meters are added to them every second."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,sticklebat,1 point,Thu May 21 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"So this won't be ELI5, but I'd be happy to clarify any questions you have later.  One consequence of general relativity is that the universe can be described as a 4-manifold, i.e., locally we have 4 dimensions (this ignores the possibility of extra 'localized' dimensions in string theory, but I digress). When we say that space or the universe is expanding, what is meant is that this manifold is 'stretching:'  if we try to measure distances between fixed points on the manifold, they get larger over time. Why this occurs has been touched on by other posters.  As for the second question, what is there for it to expand into? The answer is, we don't know, but probably nothing. As far as we know, it would be a mistake to assume that there exists some larger 4-dimensional space that the universe expands inside of. If the universe curves back around to itself (you just travel in a single direction and return to your starting point without ever turning around) or if it is even possible to create a wormhole, then it can be mathematically proven that you need at least 5 dimensions to 'contain' the universe. More exotic effects could increase the number of dimensions further, up to 8 (the Whitney embedding theorem let's us stop here, however).  Your second question assumes that space-time is embedded into a larger space, of dimension between 4 and 8. But there is no reason to think this is the case. Philosophically, the universe doesn't need anything to expand into.  If the universe is infinite in size (and this is a huge if), there is another possibility. Namely, that expansion doesn't increase the size of the universe while simultaneously increasing all the local distances (isn't infinity fun?). For example, consider an infinitely long straight line. When you stretch it (e.g., by considering it to be the number line and performing the map x -> 2x), you still have an infinitely long straight line; the full space hasn't changed. If you look at where two points were before and after the stretch, however, you see that the distance between them changed (in the case of the example, it doubled).  Thus, your second question has one of several answers:  the universe is embedded in some larger space, there is nothing for the universe to expand into (because there is nothing other than the universe, and this is just fine), or the universe is infinite (so we can have local expansion without the global 'size' changing). Of these, the middle answer is probably the most useful for physicists to consider, although I am not aware of a way to completely rule out the other possibilities metaphysically."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,pappypapaya,3,Thu May 21 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Ok.  So in order for something to expand it must take up more space then it previously did.  When the universe expands, what does it take 'space' (for lack of a better word) away from?  For instance, we usually think of this in terms of a balloon.  Two points on the balloon move apart as it is inflated.  However, it is only because there is empty 'space' around, or outside of, the balloon that is capable of expanding."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,Nyefan,2,Wed May 20 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"As far as we can tell, the universe is infinite. It's not expanding ""into"" anything, as in ""the universe takes up more space, the outside takes up less space"".  Think about it as the number line. Place a mark on each integer on the line (... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...). Now move each mark from number n to number 2n. So the mark from 1 goes to 2, the mark from -2 goes to -4, and so on. The distance between marks has increased, and the distance between marks that are further away has increased more. (The distance between 1 and 2 grew by two; the distance between 10 and 20 grew by 20.) But the number line itself isn't expanding ""into"" something that's ""outside"" of it - it's just stretching and taking up the same - infinite - amount of ""space"".  That's exactly what we observe in our universe: the distance between galaxies is increasing, and the distance to far away galaxies is increasing faster than between galaxies that are nearby."
AskScienceDiscussion,36osye,Nyxtia,2,Wed May 20 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"So in order for something to expand it must take up more space then it previously did   Well, no, not necessarily. Expansion only requires that some measure of the object's size increase over time. That measure doesn't have to be the amount of space it takes up. You could have something that technically takes up no space, or an infinite amount of space, and is still expanding."
AskScienceDiscussion,36pt0o,DIYjackass,3,Thu May 21 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"I have been asked to write my own letter of recommendation while in grad school when applying to things. This is usually because the person I was asking was too busy to write a letter, and felt it would be better for me to agonise for a week and write something. My supervisor then read it, reworded and expanded on a few points and signed the letter.  Essentially, what he was asking was for me to identify the key points that need to be included in the letter, and to write the bare bones, so he can edit.  I wouldn't consider any of this unethical as it is still up to the person signing the letter to agree with or change what is in it.    As for your second bit, asking a freelance writer to do it. I wouldn't recommend this. This is for two reasons. One, you should be doing this as it is a good exercise. There will be a time when you will be asked to give a letter of recommendation to people, and you won't be senior enough to fob it off to other people.  The other reason is that you have to get comfortable writing. Writing is not easy, and you will need to do lots of it, so better start now. A lot of what will hold you back during grad school and beyond is writing things which are difficult (emails, papers, grants, whatever), because you're not sure how to write it or what you need to write.

You can, however, hire a freelancer to edit a letter you've already composed to strengthen your word choice, eliminate awkward phrasing, etc. This is something I do as well, but when hiring an editor, you want to make sure they have at least a working knowledge of your field. My graduate degree is in psychology, so I would personally have a pretty good idea of the types of things that would be important when applying to a social sciences program.

There are potential risks from AI, but they have nothing to do with such a system becoming sentient. Instead, they involve giving automated systems too much power. The usual example is an automated factory to make paperclips. It eventually converts the entire mass of the Earth (including the population) into paper clips. Obviously a bug in the software :-) but the major error was giving it enough power to consume the Earth in the first place.

A poll done by Bostrom found that 90% the majority were certain AGI would be developed before the end of the century.   Most importantly even if the software engineering approach fails we will someday reverse engineer enough of the brain to create artificial intelligence. This is almost certainly fact. Already we emulate the brain with various different research projects such as SYNAPSE. The fidelity of these emulations (and the theoretical models powering them) will only improve in the future.   The market demand for better AI and the various different approaches being used make it certain improvements will be steady.

AskScienceDiscussion,36iaqw,Microwave_on_HIGH,2,Thu May 21 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"A better analogy would be to say that we have as much chance of building an intelligent computer as ancient Sumer had of reaching the moon by building a tall enough tower. Either we're missing something critical or we have some serious misconceptions, or (likely) both. But we're very, very far away, and, contrary to what some people want to claim, we have made very little progress in the last 50 years.   Things like Watson look cool, but they're really clever tricks. Every successful AI project evades the problem of intelligence. It starts with a problem that seems to require intelligence and then finds a clever way to do it in some completely different way from what humans seem to do and which requires no intelligence at all.  I don't want to minimize that. It's hugely valuable work, and it's what I dedicated most of my life to. But it's almost the opposite of developing intelligence. So I suppose I would say that the strongest reason to think we're not likely to develop ""sentient"" AI is that no one serious is even trying to do it. All the serious work is about avoiding the need for sentience."
AskScienceDiscussion,36iaqw,GregHullender,2,Thu May 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about AI like Watson using shortcuts.  By 'intelligence' do you mean self-awareness?  Because I'd thought that self-awareness was some sort of  recursive loop (à la Douglas Hofstadter's books I Am A Strange Loop & GEB) as opposed to intelligence.  Meaning like, how can people and animals of varying intelligence all be sentient?  I know I'm probably oversimplifying things quite a bit...but if sentience is distinct from intelligence, it makes sense that it'd get skipped over for funding, versus something more practical like Watson."
AskScienceDiscussion,36iaqw,Microwave_on_HIGH,2,Fri May 22 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"By intelligence/sentience I really mean something that has its own reasons for doing things and which has language. That rules out animals. (They do communicate but don't have the recursive structures that characterize human languages.) On the other hand a dialogue system is software that can hold a conversation with a person, provided it's related to a task. (Online reservation systems can do this; I've written a dialogue system myself.) It has language but not will, so it's not intelligent either.  The trouble with giving a solid definition to the notion of Will is that although it's something we all observe (or think we do) it also seems to contradict our understanding of how the universe works. It's also the part of sentience that has negative economic value. :-)"

I would argue the opposite. At the time of the discovery, understanding the chemical structure of DNA was WAAAY out of the realm of what biologists did at the time and was much more of a physics/chemistry problem. Especially using the approach of x-ray crystallography. These days, given an arbitrary chemical structure, even most undergraduate chemistry students can provide you with a reasonable approximation of the spatial relationship of the atoms relative to each other. This was not the case in 1953.   Watson, Crick and Franklin, as a biologist/physicist/chemist (respectively) team were able to apply a critical, relatively new tool from physics (x-ray crystallography) that was just beginning to be applied to chemistry problems (understanding the shape of the chemical bonds).   Part of the reason their work was so mindblowing was because they were able to take this thing which was in its infancy and use it to understand something horrendously, unimaginably complicated. DNA is HUUUUGE, especially compared to many of the other cutting edge structures which were previously solved, and this discovery took place right around the time it was realized that crystallography would be useful for biology at all."

You start at earth and instantly accelerate to 0.9c. Since you're moving at 0.9c your lorentz factor is 2.294 and you would calculate that the PCM packets are sent at 8000Hz / 2.294 = 3487Hz (0.0002867s period). At time 0 you receive the first PCM packet with no delay. After 0.0002867s the next packet is sent from earth, but in that time you have moved (0.0002867 * 0.9) = 0.0002581 light seconds, so you wont receive that packet until 0.0002867s + 0.0002581s = 0.0005448s after the first packet.

AskScienceDiscussion,36fzth,avabit,2,Tue May 19 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"I believe that resonance is the reason we can sense certain vibrations. The cones and rods in our eyes have structures that resonate at frequencies of the visible spectrum too small a wavelength ( ultraviolet) there is no cellular feature that can respond and infrared does not have, in human eyes, a properly sized sensor. Other creatures can see some wavelengths beyond our vision and we do have heat sensors in our skin that can feel infrared. The cilia in our cochlia can also vibrate to resonant frequencies of audible tones the shorter ones that detect the higher pitched are more delicate and subject to damage as we age. Many animals can hear higher pitches. The lowest notes can be felt by the shaking of larger body structures. Nothing in our bodies are equiped to produce or resonate to the long wave electromagnetic spectrum. However brains do produce electrical signals that may possibly ( most scientists would doubt this) but other brains might be able to have some resonance to extremely powerful signals. We do know that phrenomes work at a distance because of chemical receptors that are structured to accept certain molecules of certain shape and charge."
AskScienceDiscussion,36fzth,Solaterre,1 point,Tue May 19 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"But the radio transmitter/receiver doesn't have to be the size of wavelength it uses. In fact, most radio receivers are much smaller than their wavelengths - by orders of magnitude, even. This is because when you are in exact resonance, and the Q-factor is good, then effective absorbing cross-section of any dipole antenna becomes of the order of wavelength. This means that even a handheld receiver tuned to LF band (i.e. kilometer-sized wavelengths) ""sucks in"" falling electromagnetic energy into itself as if its radius were hundreds of meters.  By the way, the same equations work for single fluorescent molecules. Under very low temperatures and special conditions, the 'size' of cross section from which a molecule absorbs falling photons becomes order of magnitude larger than the size of the molecule itself. And, by the way, most fluorescent dye molecules are on the order of 1 nm in size, and this does not prevent them from emitting and absorbing in the visual spectrum. Most paint you see around you uses one-nanometer dye molecules to ""function"".  So, the size of an object and wavelengths of EM waves it can efficiently interact with are not linked in any rigid way."

AskScienceDiscussion,36fzth,SerBeardian,1 point,Fri May 22 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"Sure. Antenna size is an important limitation. Smaller antennas have smaller gain and this directly affects signal-to-noise ratio. Signal-to-noise ratio, in turn, fundamentally limits upper bound of theoretically achievable information rate (bits per second) after all the possible error correction, at a given bandwidth. This is called Shannon-Hartley theorem. So maybe a tradeoff between organ size a creature can afford and range/bitrate such and organ promises is never beneficial  from survival standpoint, at all sizes."
AskScienceDiscussion,36fzth,5nn_04,2,Fri May 22 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Up until recently (last 5000 years), there was never any need to communicate at distances greater than a kilometre or so. Anyone you would want to communicate to was very local: friends and family, your local tribe. Anyone you needed to talk to far away was exceedingly rare, or you might talk to them once a month/year.  There was no pressure for radio communication to evolve, especially since such a system does not really exist in nature anyway. Such a system would require a very significant change and energy investment for mimial to zero benefit: You would need either everyone to have a specific and limited system, or at least a substantial number of people to have a very complex variable-frequency system. This system would also need to be comprised of numerous parts and I'm pretty sure that, unlike an eye, there is little to no advantage of having only some of those systems (or only a partial circuit) available (someone who works on radio transceivers would know).  When agriculture made large civilizations possible and towns became cities became countries, it's only then that rapid long-distance communication has actually had any kind of evolutionary pressure.  Unfortunately for biological transmitters, technology kept these pressures suppressed: visual signalling (eg. flags); letters and writing; messengers (humans are fantastic at long-distance travel); vehicles and domestication of animals (both to pull the vehicles and as messengers) and recently: Phones, mobiles and the Internet.  Why does the body need to evolve anything for long-range communication when there is no evolutionary pressures giving it an advantage? This is especially important when you consider that an evolutionary jump would need to meet the precise specifications of our existing infrastructure to be useful at all, AND our brains would need to be able to comprehend the signal at the binary level (to interface with our machines) or at least a basic comprehension akin to hearing (to only interface with other humans). Until multiple people started evolving that trait, it would have zero use since nobody else would be able to hear you and you wouldn't be able to hear anyone else.  Very importantly, any positive pressure would today be cancelled by the massive negative pressure of the airwaves being flooded by radio waves. Imagine living in a world where a bunch of people followed you around screaming at you constantly, 24x7. You'd never be able to get anything done, let alone find someone to breed with to pass on your genes.  TL;DR: There has not been any evolutionary pressure for such a precice, complex and energy-intensive organ to evolve until the last thousand or so years and technology today pushes in the other direction."

AskScienceDiscussion,36ezjj,NowMoreEpic,5,Mon May 18 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"I am not a physicist by trade, but I think I can give you a quick answer. Your concept of a ""quantum field"" is a little mistaken. Our current understanding of physics has a place for four basic forces: Gravity, electromagnetic, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. All of these can be thought of as having associated fields, but there's not a single ""quantum field"" that is separate from those things.  In terms of what I think is the heart of your question (why we have such mastery over electromagnetism and not so much the others):   Gravity is not great for doing the kinds of things we use electromagnetism for because it's incredibly weak. Think of the amount of force that a handheld magnet can exert on a metal object. Now think about the same two objects if they aren't magnetic. Yes, they exert a gravitational attraction on each other, but it's so weak you'd never be able to tell by looking. So, gravity would be a worse way to move energy and objects around than electromagnetism, in general. The weak nuclear force, though stronger than gravity, is also weaker than electromagnetism. Also, both the nuclear forces (strong and weak) work on a very limited spatial scale (e.g., on the order of an atom's nucleus, hence the name). Whereas the ranges of gravity and electromagnetism are theoretically infinite (though decreasing with distance). That's not to say we haven't ""mastered"" their power in some ways (think of nuclear fission for generating electricity, for example), but the way they work is not very conducive to doing the kinds of things we like to do with electromagnetism. It's also a little tricky to even talk about this stuff, because everything we do requires a certain amount of understanding (or ""mastery"") of all the forces and their consequences, even if it's non-obvious. You charge your cell phone with electricity, but it works because of satellites that only stay up because of our ""mastery"" of gravity. We think of solar energy as being electromagnetic, but the sun wouldn't shine without the weak force allowing fusion to happen the way it does. Pretty much anything we do under the banner of ""chemistry"" (including cooking) is a consequence of electromagnetic and strong forces. Etc., etc.   TL; DR We use electricity the way we do because it has a good balance of being relatively strong and long-ranging, but really we use all the fundamental forces in ways that are hard to really separate out from each other."
AskScienceDiscussion,36ezjj,MattTheGr8,3,Mon May 18 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"We use electricity the way we do because it has a good balance of being relatively strong and long-ranging   To expand on this, we use electricity and electromagnetic forces to achieve pretty much everything we ever do not only because it has the right mix of strength & range, but also because processes relevant to us are electromagnetic in nature. We don't fall through stuff because of it. It allows us to see, and hear, and taste. None of this is due to gravity, or the strong or weak forces. The world is composed entirely of atoms and interactions between and with atoms are largely electromagnetic in nature (the nuclear forces play a role in determining which atoms and isotopes are stable, but they have a minuscule effect on the resulting chemical behavior).  That isn't to say there wouldn't be uses for controlling some of the other forces to the degree that we can manipulate the electromagnetic force. For example, precision control over the weak force would enable us to transmute elements easily and arbitrarily.   Like I said before in my other post, there are also quantum fields for the other elementary particles, not just the 'force carriers.' But in the spirit of the OP's question, I think limiting the discussion to fields associated with the four forces is probably reasonable."

I think it is probably non-obvious to most people that most of the things we take for granted in the macroscopic world are dominated by electromagnetic interactions (and gravity, but that doesn't do too much for us on a day-to-day basis except keep us stuck to the ground). I suspect most people hear ""electromagnetism"" and think of electric power and magnets, and don't think of light (visible and otherwise), or the chemical bonds that hold matter together and dictate all biological processes, or any of that."

Yeah that's definitely true. I teach high school physics and when that finally sinks in it really blows their minds. It's one of those things that, the first time they learn it or figure it out, they might understand or accept it at an intellectual level, but it takes a long time for them to register all of its implications. Only the more advanced students ever really get to that point.  It's really the first time that they are forced to look at the world and instead of seeing, ""chair"" or ""table"" they see an incredibly complex object composed of innumerable tiny things interacting microscopically via forces that they only previously ever thought about at human scales. We are so used to stuff just being that most people will never see past that veneer unless it's specifically point out to them.

What you see as evidence is different from what another person one sees as evidence.    The scientific method is simply: theory -> design test -> confirm.    This method also works on the other side: Some of the people that you describe as anti-vac, think that the testing is wrongly designed. That is because they assume that the companies behind them design the tests for their own profits.    Some people supporting homeopathy have the idea that the theories are incomplete, and that there is still a lot that we don't know about the subject. They also believe that tests around the subject are designed wrong. So again, the scientific method becomes a subject of belief.  The issue here is not the methodology, but the trust in the companies that do the research. Trust can not be pushed upon people. And sometimes they trust people that you don't. What I often see is that certain people do everything to remove the trust for those people. But that is just nonsense.   What does work, is to show solid research, that shows the pros and cons of a certain medicine in a open manner. If a medicine claims to be perfect, the information looks more fraudulent than real. If the medicine claims are only from the manufacturer, it seems fraudulent too.  But if the information is trust-worthy enough, the people can decide for themselves what is OK for them. Maybe if we trust them, they will trust us."
AskScienceDiscussion,36da5v,I_askthequestions,3,Mon May 18 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"I used to work in a private school in Silicon Valley. Our entire science curriculum was built around The Scientific Method. Every student conducted a minimum of 6 ""experiments"" a year. In grades 1-2, they were all teacher led, with students having science notebooks. In grade 3 they transitioned to conducting their own experiments. That philosophy naturally bled into other classes with children always being challenged to ""think like a scientist"".   So, to answer your question, having children complete 48 experiments before they even enter high school so ""thinking like a scientist"" is just considered good thinking."

AskScienceDiscussion,36cmbg,ocherthulu,7,Mon May 18 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"A graduate colleague of mine sent me this article in undergrad. It interviews Professor Sydney Brenner, a contemporary and colleague of the scientists who discovered the structure and function of DNA/RNA.  The interview demonstrates that the current scientific culture regards publication quantity as the standard of productivity. A lack of publications thus implies a lack of productivity. It is stated in the article:   “A Fred Sanger would not survive today’s world of science. With continuous reporting and appraisals, some committee would note that he published little of import between insulin in 1952 and his first paper on RNA sequencing in 1967 with another long gap until DNA sequencing in 1977. He would be labelled as unproductive, and his modest personal support would be denied. We no longer have a culture that allows individuals to embark on long-term—and what would be considered today extremely risky—projects.”   Peter Higgs, after whom the Higgs Boson takes its name, laments the same idea.   Brenner also goes on to state that the current system of peer-review is flawed. Publications from unknown journals - peer-reviewed or not - are typically unacceptable; scientists have to publish with larger names. These publishers have all instated high subscription costs which any researcher has come across (though recently I've seen open-access gain a little more popularity), but more than simply this, the commodification of research and the commercialization of the peer-review process has concentrated the ability to define ""good research"" into fewer hands.  A combination of these problems goads scientists into pursuing glamorous projects in order to gain publication in large journals and maximize citations. Often, these projects are not replicable, as the article states:   One study found that only six out of 53 landmark studies in cancer research were replicable. In another study, researchers were only able to repeat a quarter of 67 influential papers in their field.   Basic science is flagging, as benefactors need results to continue with funding. In 2007, NASA's entire budget comprised 0.58% of the total Federal budget; the New Horizons mission to Pluto cost 1/3 that of a single B-2 bomber - we have 21 B-2 bombers. That's 63 missions to Pluto. There is no opportunity to pursue research that may or may not have immediate results, but may very well impact science deeply.  These are a few things that I've picked up on, but as a new graduate student, I am not yet aware of the fine day-to-day issues that may plague science within universities. Hopefully they are few!"
AskScienceDiscussion,36cmbg,SinkTube,3,Mon May 18 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"I think what's getting in our way right now is that the stuff that's getting a lot of funding tends to be stuff that's applied and looks like it can make a lot of money in a relatively short-term period.

AskScienceDiscussion,36cmbg,BalmungSama,0,Mon May 18 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"I hear this often, but I keep finding this statement to have very little basis in reality. Hell, the scientific method itself was formalized during the high medieval period by the Roman Catholic universities. The university system we use today was itself something that began from the Catholic universities, which initially started almost exclusively as theology academies and eventually grew into studying almost everything they could find, including science (which tehy called ""natural philosophy"" at the time).  I've yet to hear any convincing reason for why the existence of religion is antithetical to science. Most of the time it's simply a statement of ""they assume to knwo something without scientific evidence,"" which is a very lack-luster excuse.   Everyone does this. Even scientists.  Historically, religion had little hinderance with science.   Often tehy point to cases such as Galileo. What people fail to realize is Galileo wasn't punished for heliocentrism. He was punished because he published a textbook where he called the Pope ""The Simpleton."" His theories also were not conclusively proven. He demonstrated partial heliocentrism (that the other planets revolved around the Sun), but did not prove complete heliocentrism (that the Earth revolved around the Sun). He also didn't explain how something with observable mass could float and revolve around an object without physical interaction. The Earth is rock, and they (thought) they knew how rocks worked. Meanwhile they could potentially explain orbits of other heavenly bodies by claiming they were made of ethereal materials, which didn't have the properties they observed. The Pope asked Gaglileo to publish a textbook where the strengths and weaknesses of both theories were discussed, rather than simply claiming heliocentrism as an absolute. Gaglileo responded by having a geocentrist character in his book who spouted words similar to teh Pope's, and was called ""the Simpleton.""  Another classic example is Giordano Bruno, but that man was more anti-science than the Catholic Church ever was.  Bottom line, I don't think it's accurate to say religion's existence is harmful to science."

In September of that same year, shortly after it was published and the Pope was apparently publically insulted and ridiculed, he was called to defend himself before an Inquisitor.

My point is I believe its what people do with the idea, not the idea itself.  This conservative movement by religious groups to denounce  science is not really about religion and God, as I see it.  Its politicians/leaders in power, using the cloak of religion to subvert the populace to achieve a specific agenda that has nothing to do with religion (in most cases).

On the Moon:   Gravity is too low to support the human body's normal functioning, so you're going to (at the very least) sleep and exercise in a large centrifuge. Surface dwellings are unlikely, you're going to be buried for protection from radiation and temperature swings Lunar dust is razor sharp, and will eventually shred airlock seals and any moving parts. Resources are limited.  Lots (most... well, almost all) of the stuff we depend on would need to be imported. The day/night cycle is long, so you're going to need to either live at the poles or at least import your solar power from an installation there.   Still, it's relatively close to Earth for an (expensive, slow) supply line or escape route.  On Mars:   The atmosphere exists, but it's too thin for direct human use.  In fact, while it's nice to have something other than vacuum for our fleshy bodies and tech to deal with, it's kind of a pain because it interferes with powered descent but isn't thick enough for significant aerobraking or parachuting. While not razor sharp, the ground on Mars is kind of toxic, and it sticks to everything.  This is basically a variation of the problem of the lunar regolith's razor sharpness... the ground wants to hurt you. The light is dim.  Solar installations would have to be larger to compensate, making them less cost effective. The gravity may still be too low for human bodies to thrive. Radiation's still an issue, though far less on than on the Moon.  You're living underground. Your supply line / escape route is basically impossibly long.  If you can't make it off local resources after being bootstrapped by whatever you initially brought, you're boned.   I see Mars as a more viable colony target due to the atmosphere, higher gravity, and better resource availability.  But the initial cost is higher because of the distance - it's not that different in terms of fuel, but because it's further you have to go for longer periods without hope of resupply, because it's further and the gravity's higher there's basically no hope of hopping on an Earth-bound escape ship to survive a catastrophe."

As you are, right now, on Earth.  In fact, we have fewer resources because we've used up the easily-reached ones.   It doesn't sound very promising if you can't light a fire.    You start by brining your own living quarters and oxygen... but then you start up the reactor you brought for power, connect up your mining equipment, and start digging new living space.  Once you have a place to live, you use that same reactor to collect Martian atmosphere and separate out the CO2 and N2.  Then you split some of the CO2 into carbon and oxygen, and then most likely dump a lot of C02 to get an Earth-like mix of N2, O2, and CO2.  It'll take a LOT of Martian atmosphere for a small amount of human-breathable atmosphere given the preferred pressure for humans compared to Martian conditions, but there's a lot of Mars and not many humans will be there, so it's just a matter of how much power you have and how long your processing systems have to work to get the job done.  Once that's done... you could have a fire if you wanted to.  But I imagine you'd probably be pretty stingy with combustion to preserve O2 for human respiration.  Maybe not - I believe there are issues with the partial pressure of O2 building up dangerously in the closed environments we currently are able to create.

AskScienceDiscussion,36b15d,patr1234,6,Sun May 17 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"There's a program by Washington State University that is working to carefully expand the genetic pool of honeybees in the US.  According to a researcher there (I worked on a documentary about bee population declines, and got to speak with a range of researchers and beekeepers) all current honeybees in the US are descended from only around 200 queen-mothers.  This small of a genetic pool - coupled with a relatively weak mite resistance compared to most european bee stocks - is thought to be part of the reason the Varroa mite is the massive problem it currently is.  People like to focus on pesticides as the problem, and we've learned a TON in the last few years about their impacts (a UK scientist named Chris Connely is doing amazing work on this subject) - but that's just one part of a mosaic of problems..  Lots of those impacts are still poorly understood at low levels of exposure, especially when they're mixed with other commonly encountered pesticides.  But if you talk with beekeepers, they're top concern is usually mites.  This largely stems from the fact that honeybee imports were banned in the 1920's due to an outbreak of Tracheal mites in Europe.  This did a good job of keeping those mites out of the US, but the european bees developed stronger mite resistance over time.  That import ban is still in place, so the folks at WSU actually had to get legal authority to import bee sperm from europe, so they can manually inseminate US queen bees. One of the goals is to develop better mite resistance for the US beekeepers.  Since mites use piercing mouthparts they are also a great vector for the transport of other diseases, of which there are many (foul brood, nosema, tobacco ringspot, israeli acute paralysis in particular). The fact that these mites pose such a constant and potentially devastating threat makes it so many beekeepers have little choice other than to apply insecticides inside their own hives.  The lack of regulation on the use of those chemicals is a whole other issue in my opinion, as over-application is very common . . . but it can come down to 'use the chemicals or lose your bees'.  It's a shitty situation, but when a person's livelihood is on the line they make the obvious choice.    Plus, high-density beekeeping provides breeding grounds for pathogens, and keepers often truck most of their colonies to pollination events in other states.  Pollination services can bring in as much money than actual honey production anymore, and most modern operations keep hundreds or thousands of hives at a time.  Put a few tens of thousands of colonies together (with ~40 thousand bees per colony on average) for an event like the California almond bloom (over 80% of the worlds almonds come from central california) and mix in some pathogens and there's going to be a rapid spread.  The recent losses of bee populations we're seeing has a lot to do with the management practices we use to keep bees in modern times, as well as our land use.  We're not just seeing bees disappear anymore like when CCD first came up, now we're seeing a steady year-round decline, and have been since the mid-2000's.  Poor diets are suspected of weakening bee immune systems to the point where mites and other pathogens become bigger problems than they otherwise might.  The diversity of forage available just isn't what is used to be, and the food provided by pollination events are often monocrop operations.  I mean, they're evolved to be cruising from flower to flower in european meadows and woodlands.  But instead, these bees get woken up early because california almonds bloom in february/march - bees aren't naturally active until temperatures are ~50 degrees.  So those in non-californian climates get a bit of a rude awakening.  Then they get table sugar and/or corn syrup, with some 'pollen cakes' for protein, but the diet pretty much processed sugar at this point.  The transportation itself doesn't actually seem to be that stressful of a process, itself. Then they go bounce around places with very little variation in diet for the rest of the active season, and high density situations are perfect for the spread of disease.  They will likely be exposed to a range of different pesticides from different sources too, which are easily transferred back to the hive.  So you get chemical interactions that we know next to nothing about disrupting the natural biota in hives.  We've learned a lot in recent years about how important human gut microbes are to our health, well the same principle applies to systems like beehives.    The consensus seems to be that these stresses are just adding up, and it's going to take a shift in our agricultural and land use practices if we really want a long term fix.  But right now, the lack of genetic variation in US stocks limits the ability of the population as a whole to develop resistance to diseases, and that is something that can be directly addressed today. Researchers at WSU are an interesting part of that effort."

AskScienceDiscussion,36c0d4,Chamrak,1 point,Mon May 18 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"You know how you tune your radio to a certain frequency when you want to listen to a particular kind of music? (Do people even still listen to radio?) The same thing goes on in communications: sender and receiver have to tune their radios to the same frequency. Or at least, that's the case when there's no time dilation going on. If you introduce time dilation, it changes the frequency of the radio signal between the sender and the receiver, so that a signal sent at 106.3 MHz might be received at 101.5 MHz, for example. That would be a dilation factor of 1.047, which is 106.3/101.5. So the sender and receiver would have to tune their radios to frequencies that differ by a factor of 1.047.  Given your information about the movie, the dilation factor would be 7 years/1 hour, which is 61362. The signal of a radio station (for example) broadcasting from the planet at 106.3 MHz would arrive on Earth at 0.00173 MHz. A car radio isn't even capable of detecting such a low frequency. And it's the same with communication: any device you build to detect signals will work within a certain frequency range, which depends on the device, but is fairly useless outside that range.  This doesn't stop them from communicating, but it does mean the people on the planet would need to have an emitter and receiver tuned to a certain frequency, and people on Earth would need an emitter and receiver tuned to a different frequency 61362 times as high. Building two devices tuned to such widely separated frequencies takes some planning. And of course you'd have to know the dilation factor (61362) in advance.  The other effect that would make communication difficult is that the signal is actually slowed down by 61362 times as it propagates from near the black hole to Earth. Actually, the whole frequency shift I mentioned before is one side effect of this. Another effect is that people on Earth would have to wait a long time to receive a signal. If they want to receive a signal that takes one second to transmit (which might be a 1-second-long voice recording, for example), they would have to wait for 61362 seconds, which is around 17 hours. This makes something like a phone call impossible (even without accounting for the travel time of the signal): a person near the black hole would say a sentence, which might take two seconds, and their conversation partner on Earth would spend a day and a half waiting to hear that sentence. You'd have to use some asynchronous communication protocol, like email (and it would still involve a lot of waiting).  In reality, these gravitational time dilation effects do happen for all planets (and stars, etc.), but in most cases the dilation factor is very close to one. For the surface of the Earth, relative to deep space, it's probably something like 1.0000000001. So we never notice it, unless we're doing extremely high-precision measurements (like in GPS)."

However, if you are walking down the street and see a body with a hole in the head, are you going to presume it was just natural? Just because people die of natural causes does not mean that is the only way they die.   With climate change, we know it does happen all by itself. However, like the example above, we know the different natural drivers of climate change. Solar output, M cycles, etc. all affect the climate with no help from humans.  However, with our current warming, we see none of that. In fact, there has been lower solar output.  We also know it is human driven because of the co2. CO2 from fossil fuels has a specific isotopic signature which we can see. So we know the increase in atmospheric co2 is from humans. Greenhouse gasses absorb escaping radiation at specific wavelengths. Satellites have observed less radiation escaping from the co2 wavelength showing the co2 is absorbing and reflecting the energy back.   So we know we are increasing co2, and we know the co2 is causing more heat to be trapped.  That is a very basic example of how we know it is anthropogenic and not natural."

It's not at all controversial or political. It's just too damn hard. It would frustrate me to no end spending an entire professional life in a single problem and very likely failing to solve it.
AskScienceDiscussion,366sej,Intropy_,7,Sun May 17 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is no controversy there.   I'd say various the application of game theory, pattern recognition and data mining to predicting human behavior is slightly more controversial.   For example computer researchers are often asked by casino owners to tweek the software in the machines  work such that people get ""hooked"" and spend a lot more money hoping to win against the house.   Of course the psychology research plays a major driver in  coming up with fundamentals. Once we have those we take that knowledge and apply game theory principles to it and take help from various ML techniques to figure what would hook a person to a machine longer .  Essentially computer scientists, with help of psychologists engineer addiction in gamblers.  And ruining the lives and stealing the savings of innocent slightly weak minded unsuspecting people is not exactly a nice thing.   There have been several papers written about the ethical implications etc.  Another controversial example is creating highly sophisticated algorithms to trade stocks and currency and commodities. Humans no longer can compete with programs that do more than 95% trades by volume. Each quarter the algorithms get better and better and volume of humans winning vs software winning tips in the favor of software, benefiting the owners of the algorithms , generally a small firm that operate on behalf of huge banks.   Robotics is another research area that is pretty hot and controversial right now in wake of dozens of drone strikes etc... And this tech is still in its infancy and has tremendous potential to get super sophisticated and not a lot of imagination is needed to misuse it.  Onion networks and related anonymizer techniques and cryptography algorithm (but its not the algorithms fault really, its just misused)have caused lots of controversy with all the leaks and stuff in recent time. They will always be controversial .. Specially since so much illegal stuff can be done sitting right at home without any way to track it.

AskScienceDiscussion,366sej,Intropy_,5,Sun May 17 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"A decision problem is a question where you want to compute a yes or no solution. Examples would be ""is a given number even"", or ""is there a nonempty subset that sums to zero of this set of integers?"" (this is called the subset sum problem).  Some decision problems are harder than others. Most instances of a problem are easy when they are small. ""is 10 even"" (yes). ""is there a nonempty subset of {-3, -4, 3, 1} that sums to zero (yes, {-3, 3}). But as the size of the question grows some problems get a lot harder a lot faster than others.  To determine whether a number is even all you have to do is scan to the last digit and look at it. That is a polynomial time problem (or just P), which means that there is some polynomial function of the size of the input that grows at least as fast as the number of steps needed to solve it.  But consider the subset sum problem. How do you know if such a subset exists? The most obvious solution is to try every subset, but the number of subsets is exponential in the size of the set. Exponential functions grow much faster than any polynomial. On the other hand if I tell you the answer is yes and I show you the subset then you can verify that I'm right much more easily. Just check whether each item in my set is actually in the input set and then take it's sum to see if it comes out as zero. That check can be done in polynomial time. We call such problems non-deterministic polynomial time (or just NP).  So NP problems are a lot harder than P problems, right? It's easy to see that all problems in P are also in NP, since just solving it outright can verify whatever answer is given. But are there any problems in NP that are not in P, or does P = NP? Put another way, is it just as hard to recognize a solution to a problem as it is to come up with one? That is a really fundamental question, and we just don't know the answer. Most people think that they aren't equal, but decades of attempts have never proven it. The most straightforward way to prove that P does equal NP would be to come up with a polynomial time solution to an NP-complete problem, which is a set of problems in NP known to be as hard or harder than every other problem in NP. But the set of NP-complete problems contains a great number of interesting and useful problems than have been studied for centuries with no polynomial time solution yet discovered. If the question were answer is this way it would be revolutionary. Many, many useful problems that we think are very hard would suddenly become easy."

But I have one more question.   Many, many useful problems that we think are very hard would suddenly become easy.   If one were to prove that P=NP, would that require some trick or method that would make ""NP"" problems easier? Or would that mean that you COULD find ways to make those problems easier, but you haven't automatically done so just by proving P=NP?"
AskScienceDiscussion,366sej,diazona,3,Sun May 17 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"If we have a proof that P = NP, then it could take many forms, but the most likely form is by discovering a polynomial time solution to one of the NP-complete problems. The way almost all NP complete problems are proved to be NP complete is that a polynomial time ""reduction"" to a known NP-complete problem is described. What that means is that we can in polynomial time turn one instance of one NP complete problem into an instance of another NP-complete problem. A polynomial plus a polynomial is still a polynomial, so through a sequence of already known transformations you can turn a solution to one of these problems into a solution to all of them. In practice it's likely that whatever great insight allowed one problem to be solved would be applied to other problems to devise solutions to them directly."

Take any made up equation with as many variables as you'd like. If a computer was given a set of numbers and asked to check if that worked as a solution, that would be trivial for it. Just plug and chug. But to find all of the solutions for itself, that may take much much longer (depending on the complexity of the problem).  Proving that P = NP means proving that there is necessarily some algorithm that exists that is able to verify or solve a given problem within the same time scale as the other.  Meanwhile, there are also people trying to prove that P != NP, meaning that there are problems that, no matter what algorithm is applied, simply cannot be solved as quickly as a solution to it can be verified.

AskScienceDiscussion,366sej,Phhhhuh,1 point,Sun May 17 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"A real world application: security. Today's encryption is based on the RSA standard, which uses public key encryption. That means that everything needed to break your encryption is actually provided— if you have enough computing power. The system uses large prime numbers, because every number has a unique way to be written as a product of primes. For instance, 12 = 2·2·3. So, if you multiply two primes (let's call them A and B) it follows that the result (X) is divisible by these two primes, and nothing else! So that huge number X is publicly available, it is the encryption key that anyone can use to send you a message, and the two primes you used to create the product is your decryption key, which is kept secret.  So one can check the solution extremely fast, if someone thinks they have figured out A they just check if X/A leaves no remainder, making this a ""P"" problem, but with our current knowledge it is very hard to factorise a large number into its prime factorisation, so we suspect (and hope) that this is not an ""NP"" problem. Note that the security is only based on making it hard to decrypt, not impossible. If anyone tries hard enough, they will break any encryption in finite time, it's just a matter of assigning enough computer power to the task of finding factors to X through trial and error. But, this is wildly impractical, it would take so much time that the information would be meaningless by the time it's decrypted.  TL;DR All electronic encryption, such as the passwords guarding your bank accounts, are based on the hope that P ≠ NP."

It sounds to me like the way we do it now is great because if you and I want to communicate, it's very simple for us to check because we're just plugging and chugging. But the guy outside has to actually do the work.  So is there another, less convenient solution in the even that P=NP? And if someone did find out P=NP, how would you safely report that?

Proving P = NP theoretically wouldn't mean that all encryption stops working, but it'd mean that our encryption will stop working one day. Since our knowledge (here I include science, computing power, mathematical knowledge and algorithms) always moves forward I guess that, if P = NP, the difference computing time for P problems and NP problems would tend towards zero. So one day we would no longer have public encryption, we would we back to the days where one needs a trusted messenger to deliver the decryption key in person to one's intended recipient before sending messages.  Of course, there's no obvious way of proving P = NP, the simplest way to prove it would be to find such a magic algorithm, so if we're unlucky the proof will be the algorithm. In that case, publishing it would be like your example with the nuke, just think about all the world's money being worthless in an instant, and international espionage on top of that.

Not the only one, but the only one that doesn't first require a meeting of sender and recipient to agree on something (like encryption method, password, or so on). One-time pads are one example, but simply a good book cipher can be practically impossible to break. The drawback is that the pads or the book (and algorithm for using the book) must be securely exchanged beforehand. As far as I know, we need the asymmetry that comes from P ≠ NP."

AskScienceDiscussion,366sej,Kakofoni,6,Sat May 16 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"The RNA world hypothesis is the idea that the earliest life forms on earth used RNA both as the primary genetic material and as biological catalysts (""ribozymes"" instead of enzymes) to drive metabolism, replication, etc. All the basic biological functions were performed by RNA, probably inside a membrane of some sort. DNA then evolved from RNA as a more stable genetic material and RNA somehow found a way to translate itself into proteins, which are far more versatile and stable catalysts, yielding the DNA-RNA-protein basis of all modern life.  It makes a lot of sense in theory, but actually researching it is hard as balls. RNA is notoriously difficult to work with because of its instability, and we have little idea of what the pre-DNA, pre-protein RNAs would have looked like, so it's hard to know where to even start with actual research on the subject.

The idea is that you have a machine gun rigged to a device that measures a quantum property of a particle, the spin on an electron for example. If the spin is up, the gun fires, if it's down the gun doesn't. The researcher stands in front of the gun and turns the system on.  So, for the first shot there's a 1/2 chance of the experimenter surviving. After two measurements there's a 1/4 chance, with the next a 1/8 chance, and so on (odds on survival = 1/2n where n is the number of measurements made).  If Everett's idea is correct, and with every quantum level interaction the universe splits into every possible outcome, there MUST be at least one universe where the experimenter always survives, however small the odds.  The problem is, for any given ""version"" of the experimenter that survives there's (2n) -1 dead versions of the experimenter.  If you make a measurement ten times you'll have 1023 universes where the newspaper headline is ""Idiot Scientist Shot In Face"" and one where the headline is ""Scientist Survives Experiment Against The Odds"".

No.  Colour perception is based on the frequency of light striking your retina, and the pattern in which it triggers a response in the cones on it.  The human eye usually has only three types of cones, corresponding to three frequency ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum.  Some people have four, but there is only one person in the world where there is sufficient evidence to say they probably get something from that extra cone type, and it's more or less just more hues of the same colours.  There's no light that isn't part of the electromagnetic spectrum, there's no human eye that can see outside the visual portion of that spectrum, and even if there were, there's no brain capable of handling the input.

Ah, but we are. The force you feel pulling toward the Earth is the sensation of moving through time, but hitting the Earth. When physicists talks about moving through time, it's meant literally. The concept of ""spacetime"", where space and time are intimately linked, is a crucial part of understanding why things are. Time isn't just what we just call the perception of events following each other.  An old poster robotrollcall made a lot of really good explanations of gravity, which is what finally cemented the ideas in my head, or at least as much as I humbly understand.

This is one of Einstein's famous insights, and it's called the Equivalence Principle.

When you're sitting on the ground, the accelerometer is measuring the Earth pushing on you.  You may have heard of simulating weightlessness by using an airplane in a dive. If you checked your accelerometer during that time, it would read no acceleration. In reality, you're moving in a straight line through spacetime. :)"

It was also believed to be a force like EM before the general theory of relativity, especially since the maths is very very similar as far as we can observe on a small scale.  Now, I am still taking my General Relativity course at the moment so I may be slightly incorrect in saying this (anyone with more expertise please correct me), but it turns out we are NOT in an inertial frame, but we are actually moving along curved space time, where the curvature is caused by gravity. This means that gravitational ""force"" is actually a fictitious force, just like when we spin a bucket of water above our heads in circular motion and the water stays in: some will say there's a ""centrifugal force"", but the reality is that the perceived force is entirely due to the water being in a non-inertial reference frame."

This works well as the hive behavior of the bees is centered around the queen, which can be controlled through the use of excluder bee boxes.  This means that they are stuck in specific areas since they wont leave their queen behind, so we can put the bee boxes in the middle of an orchard or field and the bees will have to pollinate the crop or starve.  Native pollinator (such as native bee, moths, wasps etc) species do not live in hives and so require a much different approach.  They need natural habitat to support and lure them onto sight.

That pile is as compressed as it's going to get because it is in mechanical equilibrium with its own gravity.  So your ""If"" is long passed. We have already done all that and what resulted was a lot of heat and radio-thermal decay in our core. Tah Dah!  The ""fine point"" you are missing here is that the same things happen in stars, but stars are so much larger than earth that there is an intermediate step.  In stars, as the gravitational collapse takes place they too suffer a complete lack of ""Structural Integrity"", but they get hot enough, and are made of a lot more hydrogen, so they begin fusion. Earth just got hot. Stars start manufacturing and radiating energy.  That outward flow of radiation ""temporarily"" prevents the star from continuing its collapse. Basically the very act of collapse causes a continuous explosion. And that explosion prevents the continued collapse. This is sort of how you can keep water ""up hill"" on a slide if  you are spraying water up the slide, but in all three dimensions.  Stars, thus, reach an equilibrium between the in-force and the out-force, until they run out of the ""good"" hydrogen fuel. When they run out of hydrogen they start fusing the heavier fuels, but that doesn't produce as much out-flow of energy, so it does a crappier job of keeping the star's mass spread out. This causes even more and even heavier atomic nuclei to go into fusion. This is the birth of the truly heaviest atoms.  The thing ""pushing the star apart"" is literally a pressure made of photons, and is called photon pressure... because scientists like to name things plainly.  So as the photon pressure dies, the sun shrinks in its core but may expand its surface (ah, or something, I always get that part a little confused, what with the hotter and bigger and redder and dimmer). It all depends on how much of each kind of stuff is there. Our sun, for instance, being very small will likely swell into a big red ball larger than earth's orbit. In this phase it will start spewing out stuff and then eventually it will get much smaller and ""hotter"" but it will never do the neat stuff.  Our sun will never nova, it doesn't have enough mass.  Our sun will never ""super nova"" because it doesn't even have enough mass to nova.  Our sun will never make a black hole because without the back-pressure of a super-nova and a lot of extra mass it just will never get pressed ""hard enough"" to overcome its own radiation and photon pressures as it makes more and more heavy atoms.  The earth, being a speck of dust by comparison, isn't even in this continum. It is so small that long ago got as hot as it's going to get, and that wasn't hot enough to start fusion or any of the neat stuff.  So we are living on a slowly cooling rock with nothing here-abouts to make us likely to give our world any sort of influx of energy. We are already as ""mashed together"" as our own mass can make us and the only future this rock has is to be melted in layers and blown into outer space as our sun swells into a big red blob in its later life.  So, sorry, nothing to see here. No structure. No integrity. Just a warmish-blob with a cool-ish skin on which we scratch about. If we get smashed by a meteor or comet or something we might get ""gooshed"" or ""splashed"" into blobs, but other than that we are just a blob of nickle-iron coated with some silicon and aluminium waiting to harden in the cold vacuum of space."
AskScienceDiscussion,364p34,BitOBear,0,Sat May 16 10:10:59 2015 UTC,"The short answer is no.   A distinct feature of star collapse is that stars tend to be enormously massive and thus have high gravitational force. A star's energy output could even be seen as an integral structural component keeping the star's mass from collapsing inward. . When a star begins to run out of fuel, its energy output decreases and it is less able to maintain the balance of its gravity and its size. Without the energy pushing outward from the star, its size begins to decrease and get smaller. It's still enormously massive, though. That much mass in such a small space is typically thought to lead to novas and black hole formation. Simply put, energy output loses the fight against gravity. The star's mass compresses and that's nova/black hole time.   Earth has neiither the energy output nor the mass to ever worry about something like that. An outside force would have to exert a lot of energy to compress the matter that makes up the Earth into something that would go bang or turn into a black hole.

Water soluble drugs depend on pH hugely for whether they can be absorbed through the stomach or the intestine and into the blood stream, where they will reach all tissues of the body. Lipid soluble drugs can just diffuse into fat cells and stay put, often bound up by some intracellular protein. The drug will basically be stored inside adipose tissue and slowly released as these cells turn over."

AskScienceDiscussion,362cus,itscalledANIMEdad,3,Fri May 15 16:32:54 2015 UTC,"Just thought I would clarify dukec's post, apologies if it's clear from his/her post.   If a drug is water soluble the concentration in a sample of blood (provided it doesn't bind plasma proteins) is fairly representative of the total amount in the patient's body, and it's also easy to calculate a dose that will reach that blood concentration.   The complications caused by reserves in adipose (fat) tissue are due to the fact that it's difficult to measure the concentration in adipose tissue, and blood concentration is no longer accurate because it's unknown. This makes it hard to know what concentration is in the patients body, but additionally it is also difficult to calculate what dose the patient should be given because it is harder to calculate how much of the dose will end up as ""free drug"" circulating in the body. One would have to factor in the lipophilicity of the drug and the amount of adipose tissue in the patient.   Furthermore, the drug can lie dormant in the adipose tissue and be released at different rates later, causing problems with long term treatment. Acid flashbacks! :P"

Most physics and astronomy papers get put up on http://arxiv.org/ at the same time they're being submitted to, or accepted to, a journal. That means that there's at least a version that is free to access.  There's a definite issue that attempts at having free journals have led to some concerns as to if there is a proper peer review process or not."

AskScienceDiscussion,360564,Lowbacca1977,2,Fri May 15 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"Well, to some extent, there's always an expectation that a paper should go through peer review. there are papers that are up on arxiv that have never been submitted to a journal (I'm preparing one that'll likely have that fate currently) although those tend to be more in the lines of proposals or technical information, like the specifics a survey, rather than science results.  From a job evaluation perspective, publications are expected, so that can make it really important to get published with peer review. There are some overhead costs, so there's a price for publishing and a price for journal access. There's starting to be some changes where journals that have long histories are transitioning to electronic only, with no printed journals, and that's bringing the cost down, but in general the costs for access are covering their (relatively basic) overhead costs.  I've got less of an idea on how this factors into some of the other fields, like medicine, which seems to have a lot more paywalls involved."
AskScienceDiscussion,360564,whatthefat,8,Fri May 15 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, journals need to make money to run. Generally they aren't government funded, so that leaves two options: bill the authors or bill the readers. Traditionally, journals have billed the readers, making their money through university subscriptions. This has obviously had the effect of hiding most science (even federally-funded research) from the tax-paying public, which is far from ideal.  In some fields, it's difficult for us to do much about these journals, since publishing in them usually means signing over copyright of the material. Nevertheless, there are moves to make federally-funded papers publicly accessible. For example, see Pub Med Central. You might also have noticed that it's becoming increasingly easy to source pdfs of pay-walled papers (e.g., through search engines) as more and more sites host the files. This isn't necessarily legal, but it is making many pay-walls obsolete.  Now, there are many ""open-access"" journals, which instead bill the authors and allow the public to freely read the material. Typically, these journals will charge the authors $1000-3000 to publish a paper, which comes out of grant money. This isn't ideal either, as it impacts our ability to pay for the research. As /u/Lowbacca1977 said, there have been legitimate concerns about certain open-access journals running scams in which they will accept any papers for cash. While there are many of these journals, they are known about, and there are many high-quality open-access journals, including PLoS. Some journals are also now allowing the authors a choice between open access or not."

Truthfully, your question about open access is great, because it gets at an issue which will be of increasing importance over the next century. A lot of the amazing scientific and technological breakthroughs made over the last 150 years were supported by public funding. We have funded science (both basic and applied) in the US and abroad because it was traditionally considered a fundamentally good thing that only had positive benefits for society and the economy. Right now, China is doing with science funding what the US did around the time of WWII. Meanwhile, the US Congress is trying to take the funding of science back to the relative dark ages."
AskScienceDiscussion,360564,marathon16,6,Fri May 15 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"Many of us are entirely in favor of open access publication. However, it can cost a significant amount of money in fees to publish in such journals, and not all scientists have the funds. In the next two years, my lab and research center will be publishing 4 or 5 open access papers at a cost of ~$2,500 apiece, and guest editing an open access special issue in a major journal. That special issue is going to cost us $45,000 and several months of work assisting with the editing, peer-review process, and etc.  The truth is, scientific publishing is expensive (high standards and low readership). Open access shifts the burden of cost from University libraries (where most subscription fees come from) to individual researchers. If you aren't well-funded (which many early-career researchers aren't), then that burden might mean having to cut funding somewhere else. For example, the $10,000 to $15,000 a tenure track professor might pay to publish 5 papers per year (which is considered a 'normal' amount in most US research institutions) would pay for half the salary of a masters or doctoral student."

Local libraries often offer papers for low prices, which is good, but I read a lot...  That said, more and more stuff are available to resource-less people like poor students, adolescents, patients who do their own research on their condition, or just people who love knowledge.

AskScienceDiscussion,360564,wildfyr,2,Sat May 16 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'm in math/computer science -- not quite science per se, but close.  In my experience, most academic researchers just don't care that much about open access. Academics at major universities, and many minor ones, have always had access to the latest papers. Once upon a time it was through subscriptions to print journals and mailed preprint requests. Today it is subscriptions to electronic journal collections, preprint servers, and interlibrary loan. But whatever the details are, we can get the papers.  You can fight for open access and vow never to submit a paper to a closed journal. The trouble is that the prestigious journals are the old, expensive ones. People who don't publish in these might not get tenure, and people who don't get tenure get fired.  And the reality is that most hard-science & math papers are only understandable by experts in the field. The fact that an author might reasonably claim to have personally met the entire audience for his paper, can result in a mindset that is difficult to counter.  There is a growing (slowly growing, but growing) movement among researchers in support of open access. It is being fought bitterly by the old-style journal publishers, of course. Ironically, some of the top journals are published by professional organizations. So the fight against open access is funded by the dues paid by people who support open access.  That movement offers some hope. When a significant number of tenured researchers at least consider the availability of open access to their work when choosing a journal to submit it to, then things are headed in a good direction.  The other main hope I see is in requirements set by government funding agencies. The open-access requirement put into place by the (U.S.) NIH in 2008 was a huge step forward. It has done wonders for the availability of medical research. Today, 7 years later, it offers a clear refutation of the bogus forecasts of doom by the big journal publishers. And if you frame the issue right, it is difficult to argue against: the public paid for this research; they should have access to the results.  I would love to see the NSF put a similar policy in place. Two months ago they did announce a ""plan"" to make such a requirement beginning January 2016. I don't know how close this plan is to an actual policy, though.    EDIT. To clarify,  I have met researchers who support open access, and I have met researchers who do not care. I have never run across a researcher claiming to oppose it. In news articles on this issue, there are often interviews with representatives of journal publishers who say that many researchers are uncomfortable with open access. These people never name any names, however, and I think they are just making it all up. (Or use the L-word if you like.)"

(2) It costs money to do things like publish findings, or indeed find findings, and our political system (that'd be you) don't want to pay for that via taxation, so we find ourselves running science as a business. Businesses need to be paid.  Were we the kind of society that paid for things like higher education out of our public coffers and were willing to really pay a 50%, no deductions, fraction of our earnings in taxes to really support medicine, education, and infrastructure then that would carry virtually all the weight of study and publication.  Sadly, that's not who we are. We want a lot of things to be ""free"" or ""cheap"" to us individually, and so we don't want to pay for a system where the individual parts are actually free to everyone.  So yes, in the ideal all research would be free. But in that same ideal the people like you, and I, and everyone, would be paying for most of the research and all of the publication expenses via a common pool (e.g. taxes).

AskScienceDiscussion,360sn2,layxzee,1 point,Fri May 15 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"You can't ""test"" a correlation unless you have first established that correlation exists.  Your thesis statement is already flawed and the methodology that follows is therefore suspect.  Also you have no way to statistically analyze the contents of the ""Why"" box.  Finally, without the contents of this message, the form at that site is Insufficient.  So, you need to correct your premise and methodology thus...  First, you must NOT tell us your premise. By telling us you think there is a correlation between age and the impermissible-ness and anti-ethical-ness of previous experiments, you are subconsciously prompting your entire audience to ""vote no like an adult"".  Second you have no way to quantatize your data since the bulk of it is a bunch of subjective statements about ""why"".  So consider albert alone for a second. IF instead of asking ""is this okay"" and why or why not, describe then describe the experiment. Then provide a good representative set of the potential objections.  (1) This is okay, kids should be discouraged from playing with rats anyway. (2) This is okay, if the kid decides he hates rats then he'll just find other things to play with. (3) This is not okay, it was mean to the kid. (4) This is not okay, it was mean to the rat. (5) Not Okay, Nobody tried to fix the kid after the experiment. (6) Not Okay, there weren't enough kids involved to be a valid experiment.  Now I just pulled these six potential options out of my head, but you should think of potentially better (more insightful) choice, and be sure to put some stalking horse ones in like the ""mean to the rat"" one. But you don't want a lot of choices because the more potential answers the larger your sample set needs to be to be valid.  Now in your analysis you look at each statement you provided. (1) is dismissive of the whole setup. (2) shows a lack of empathy for the kid. (3) shows empathy for the kid. and so on.  So carefully chosen questions that have an apparent singular value each can now be matched to age groups and your (unstated to the audience) premise that older people are more likely to worry about the brat can be demonstrated or refuted."
AskScienceDiscussion,360sn2,BitOBear,1 point,Sat May 16 10:42:21 2015 UTC,"I purposely did not write my hypothesis in the post so that the premise wasn't spoiled, but just mentioning what i'm testing, even just looking at the survey, you can pretty obviously see what i'm testing and with any psychology knowledge on morality or Kohlberg can easily determine my hypothesis. With such a straight forward experiment, it wasn't avoidable. I know this experiment has flaws, but based off of the data i've accrued it doesn't show people just voting like an adult (I can isolate participants and look at their ages and responses), because there is plenty of variation which has even surprised me, especially the reasonings. I am statistically analyzing the why box in a sense, with it adding to the moral score of the participant, by -1/-2 if it shows moral/ethical values and +1/+2 if it does not (points show less morality). The assumption is the ethics committees choices today are moral and ethical, and thus the further differentiation from their choices (such as saying no and demonstrating no moral/ethical values with the why box) results in a higher score. The correlation has already been shown to exist with standing psychological research, and i'm hoping my testing is going to show the same results. Based off of time constraints, I will be taking 10 of the most valid tests (based off of coherent responses) and calculating the mean (besides the young teenagers and late adults, because it is unlikely these will be filled out), which I will then use to calculate the standard deviation and standard error, which can show whether my data is useful at all. I can definitely see the errors with the experiment, such as working off of 2 assumptions (a correlation between morality and age exists, as evident by Kohlberg; and the rules today are ethical and moral), and will include this in the portion of my paper on the confounding variables and what could have been improved on the paper. But, there was no real way to avoid people drawing my hypothesis from my post with them having any knowledge on psychology (which is likely because the only sub-reddits I can post them in are science heavy), and i'm trying to circumvent that by taking the 10 most coherent surveys for each age as a representative for the age group. Also, i'm trying to circumvent the aspect of not being able to quantify it by assigning scores to each of the answers and responses, but, as said before, this is based off of an assumption and may or may not work.  The whole point of this experiment in class was to allow us to work through and see processes involved, and it isn't the results that matter as much to the grade, it's the work. I have time constraints I have to work with, as a result of my own poor planning, and didn't have time to sand off all of the rough edges, but I'm hoping my results show similar to those of psychological understanding of morals/ethics. A lot of the flaws you see with my experiment I have found ways of lessening the impact on the data, and the assumptions I have made are reasonable. I'm even calculating the standard deviation and standard error bar to even show if any thing can be concluded from my data. Overall, with the time constraints, considering I had less than a week to finish it (poor planning on my part), it is good. Even if nothing can be concluded by my data, as i've said before, the whole point of the experiment was the process, not the results, and the paper i've written and the graphs i've made are the goals required for a good grade. Thanks for taking your time to reply to my experiment; i'm working my best to combat these issues and i'll be sure to include some of the points you bring up in my paper!"
AskScienceDiscussion,360sn2,BitOBear,1 point,Sat May 16 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to tear you down. But part of the scientific method is to attack the methodology to search for ways it might be flawed.   So for instance it's always better if your subjects don't know what you are testing. There is, therefore, a fine tradition of lying to test subjects. 8-)  To step a way for a second, I call this the ""breathe normally problem"". When a doctor is listening to your chest and tells you to take a deep breath or hold your breath you know what to do. But if he says ""breathe normally"" he's asking you to resume not paying attention to how you breathe. It's virtually impossible.   So you need to focus on telling your subjects what you want them to do instead of what you are trying to see them do.  Another example. If a doctor tells you to walk up and down the hall a few times you might feel a little odd, a little self conscious, doing it but you'll walk more or less normally after a few steps. If the doctor says ""I want to see if you wiggle your left heel when you walk"" you are not going to be able to not think about your left heel and whatever you do. Now if your doctor is really looking for hip pain and he says something about your feet the misdirection might even help by making you not think about your hip at all.  So when you look at your methodology you've come out and said to us that age is a factor and you expect older people to have more objections. That leads the witness.  So if you have a scoring system in place for the ""why"" box then good. But in terms of you demographics question we, your white rats, shouldn't know which one is important.  So if you'd asked say ""gender"" and ""highest education"" and ""age"" and ""income"", even though you don't care about gender, education, or income then you'd get less errors.  People are invested in wanting ot be correct. For example if you did a ""how long is your penis"" survey and told one group that 4.5 inches is average, and you told another group that 6.5 inches is average, what do you think would happen to the answers? Well what do you know, the second group all have bigger dicks! ha ha ha.  So one of the ways you could have fooled us was to state your premise differently.  Here are four experiments that actually happened, please rate them each from 1 to 10. One is ""I see noting wrong with this"" and ten is ""someone should go to jail for that"".  First is (Tuskegee experiment of giving several hundred black men syphilis, tell them they are getting antibiotics, and watch them go crazy and die instead) This one sets a mental bar for horrible. Then the second one is the test about making kids not eat the marshmallow if they want to have two later, setting the mental bar for ""perfectly okay"". Then you ask about the tests you want real data for.  So now you've bracketed your group, and you've also got a ""smart ass detector"" for the kind or person who is going to answer 10 for the marshmallows and 2 for the syphilis.  Now you just start graphing average and total score for the ones you care about against the age of the respondent (and ignore the rest of the data).  Now this is still flawed in some ways, but it's got some double-blind elements. The subjects don't have any prompting for the ""correct"" answer.  Psychology is one of the hardest things to study because the people are going to try to outguess you and try to make themselves ""look better than everybody else"". It's pernicious.  So it's like poker, you don't want the rats subjects to see any more cards than you absolutely must show."

These are purified with chromatography, which I'm not qualified to talk about in detail but it doesn't involve high heat.  Small amounts of protein can survive digestion and make it to your bloodstream, but your body won't know what to do with foreign proteins and your immune system may see suspicious unfamiliar material floating around and panic (which is what happens in peanut allergy).

AskScienceDiscussion,35yli6,dirty_d2,1 point,Thu May 14 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Right, during the inertial part they see each other as aging at the same slow rate. You don't have to think about the turn around part of the trip, just stopping at the destination is enough. pretend that the ship can accelerate/decelerate to/from 0.87c in 1 hour and its headed to a star at rest with respect to earth 4ly away. Nothing too crazy happens at departure. Earth sees the ship as taking 4.6 years to reach the star, and the crew age 2.3 years. By the time the crew reaches the star, but just before they start decelerating they have experienced 2.3 years of travel and have seen the earth age 1.15 years. At the point where they start decelerating they would see time speed up on earth so that during that one hour, 3.45 more years pass on earth for a total of 4.6 years that the earth has aged. When I say ""see"" I really mean calculate in their own reference frame. What you would actually see is more complicated because of the light time delay.  You don't need to involve acceleration to see whats going on here. Treating the acceleration as gravity does give you the same results though. The situation is completely different for the people on earth and the crew. The earth, the people on earth, and the star have all been together in the same inertial reference frame the entire trip. The ship and crew have moved out of earths reference frame and back into it at the end of the trip. Pretend that the ship doesn't have to accelerate, but can instantaneously change it's velocity between 0 and 0.87c. The ship starts in earths reference frame, moves into a new one where time ticks at a different rate than the old, then back into earth's at the end. When you transition to a different reference frame you inherit a new ""present"". At the first transition your new present is the same as earth's present, but since the rate of time has changed, your present starts diverging from earth's. When you stop at the star you move back into earth's reference frame where you inherit it's present of 4.6 years from when you left. You would see earth instantly age from 1.15 years to 4.6 years, a discontinuity in time. Again, calculate, not actually see. You can think of the acceleration as constantly moving you through instantaneous inertial reference frames for infinitesimally small periods of time so that you see time speed up on earth rather than a discontinuity in time.  Say you want to think about what you would actually see in the instantaneously accelerating ship, right as you get to the star, but right before you stop. The earth is only 2ly away from you due to length contraction at 0.87c, so what you will see is what was happening on earth 2 years ago in your time. Two years ago in your time you were 0.3 years into your trip, so from your frame 0.15 years would have passed on earth, so what you would see is earth 0.15 years after launch in 1/2 speed slow motion. When you stop you are now in earth's reference frame 4.6 years after launch, and the earth is 4ly away, so you will instantly go from seeing earth 0.15 years after launch in slow motion, to earth 0.6 years after launch at regular speed.  That last part was pretty confusing to think about and I'm, not entirely sure its right. Hopefully someone can clear it up."
AskScienceDiscussion,35yli6,dirty_d2,1 point,Thu May 14 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"This sort of makes sense to me. Although I am confused about the crew seeing only 1.15 years pass on earth before they slow down. It makes sense with time dilation, with two factors of 1/2 being multiplied. However, isn't that what earth people would also see if they looked at the crew's clocks? (If earth was the one turning around).  It just seems asymmetric to me. Just looking at time before turn around: The folks on earth watch the clocks of the crew and see 2.3 years. The crew watch the clocks of earth folks and see 1.15 years. What am I missing?"
AskScienceDiscussion,35yli6,jakeOmega,1 point,Thu May 14 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the 1.15 year part is right, but I'm not 100% positive. The situation is already asymmetric though, because during the entire trip the star is 4ly away for earth, but for the crews trip it's 2ly away. There isn't any reason for earth to see the crew age 1.15 years, because it definitely takes 4.6 years for the crew to get there in their reference frame, and they should definitely see the crew age at half the rate, so they should see them age  2.3 years. The crew should also definitely age 2.3 years during the trip and also definitely see the earth age at half their rate, so it must be 1.15 years before they stop. Unless I'm overlooking something. I'm a lot less sure about what you actually see.  I need to stop saying ""see"" when I really mean calculate or know. I mean it like I'd say that earth would see the ship get there in 4.6 years, but they really wouldn't, they would see the ship get there in 4.6 years (travel) + 4 years (light time delay) = 8.6 years."

Also, it seems like length contraction of the trip distance is what decides which way time dilation will go. For instance, since the trip distance is contracted for the crew, their trip is only 2.3yrs long, and in that time they see 1.15yrs on earth. Whereas on earth, 4.6 years go by, when they see 2.3 years go by on the crew's ship. This seems asymmetrical, and problematic."
AskScienceDiscussion,35yli6,jakeOmega,1 point,Thu May 14 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"I think that last bit is incorrect. You see things by having photons enter your eye, and if a photon is at the same place and time as your eye in one frame it is in the same place and time as your eye in all frames. If you instantaneously accelerate, your position doesn't change in while you change your speed, and the photon's position doesn't change, so you should see the same thing instantaneously before and after you accelerate (up to Doppler shifts).  It's a slightly different situation than what you described, but a post I wrote a while back describes what you'd see during a relativistic journey. The wikipedia article is also pretty good."

Gravitons are not part of the accepted theory of gravitation, namely General Relativity. The strong nuclear force (""gravity A"" as he calls it) is very well understood and, unlike gravity or electromagnetism, it cannot be amplified to arbitrarily high field strengths, since at some point it will produce particle-antiparticle pairs effectively reducing its strength (As seen in an animation on wikipedia). Although isotopes of elements 115 and 116 have been produced, none of them were found to be in the proposed island of stability and the properties he is assigning to those hypothetical isotopes are purely speculative. A radioactive decay producing anti-protons/anti-hydrogen has never been observed since energies released in such decays are way too low to produce a proton-antiproton pair. This process could not be used to produce ""obscene"" amounts of power. In the best case we could use the binding energy stored in the nucleus similar to classical nuclear fission.

But the hypothermia studies, and expanding them to other exposure and privation death scenarios with strict rigor could tell us significant things about the living and dying body.  The experiments in question were unethical. And indeed skewed by the sample selection. But never before or since has such systematic and rigorous destructive testing of humans been undertaken.  Even hope-of-rescue as a determinant was examined, particularly in the drowning studies. The systematic increase of survival times if there was a clock, or especially a countdown timer, was visible to the subject and the subject was promised removal after the elapsed time, was amazing. Even when the time was repeatedly extended for various bullshit reasons.  The measurement of the metabolic shutdown with repeated blood, tissue, and urine samples taken as the body shut down due to hypothermia. Followed by various attempts to reheat and revive the body, which brought us the first insight int rewarming with hot fluid lavage and direct heating of the blood. (Techniques we now use).  And the U.S. (using volunteers) did study slow starvation. Not undo death but it got close, the volunteers were not allowed to quit, so this sort of thing was going on in wider circles to lessor extents.  Oh yes, it was sadistic as hell. Few things could be less ethical.  And yes, done again with better subjects much more could be learned.  Were ethics out the window the number of things we could learn with direct and destructive human testing are legion.

AskScienceDiscussion,35vz4t,kairon156,6,Wed May 13 23:37:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, when they talk about shadows moving faster than light, they're talking about the shadow moving perpendicular to the direction of the view.  So basically, if you had a spotlight that was able to light up the entire moon face and you passed an object across that spotlight at a very fast speed, then even though the object was travelling slower than light speed, the shadow of the object travelling across the face of the moon would travel faster than light travelling that same distance across the face of the moon.  The trick is that although the shadow is travelling faster than light speed, the shadow is merely the absence of light arriving from the spotlight, so it appears to be travelling faster than light ON THE MOON.  In relation to your question:  Let's assume that someone has a super-candle that can be seen by the mirror. And the object that is creating the shadow is a metal rod capable of casting a significant shadow on a wall 10m away. Finally, we assume that the rod passes across the candle in 2 seconds.  If the mirror is an ordinary standing mirror (that somehow could reflect the image from 1LY away perfectly) then you would see the exact same thing that you would see if the mirror was 10m away from the candle: the candle is lit, and someone moves a metal rod across the light of the candle in 2 seconds, the shadow moves the width of the mirror in 2 seconds and so has a speed of (say, .5m) per second. The only difference is that they actually passed the rod 1 year ago.  Now let's take that same magical mirror and expand it out until it is 1 LY wide, but capable of reflecting the same image as before. Now, the rod passes in the same 2 seconds, and as such, the image of the rod on the mirror passes across the mirror in 2 seconds, but the image is now travelling at 1LY/2seconds, which is waaaay beyond light speed.  The reason why this doesn't break physics (except for the fact that it would never work because light diffusion and whatnots) is because the image itself is comprised of light that has spent a year travelling that 1LY from the candle to the mirror, and that the light itself does not actually travel from one end of the mirror to the other: Different photons arrive at different points of the mirror over the 2 second period to create the image, but no individual particle or wave actually travels faster than light at any point: only the image as a whole, which is comprised of millions or billions of photons.  The final question: The image at the mirror itself would move 1 year after the actual event and an observer back at the candle will see the movement in the mirror after 2 years have passed. If someone 2 years ago moved the rod, you would see it today and if you moved the rod today, people 2 years from now will see the movement."

Shoot the leftmost side of the moon then immediately the rightmost. The right bullet impact will happen before light at the left impact could make it there. It's the same thing as the shadow (photons instead of bullets), and nothing moved faster than the speed of light."

AskScienceDiscussion,35tjpl,Socks21,18,Wed May 13 11:45:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who teaches quantum mechanics and chemistry at MIT, I'm going to go argue yes, our system is probably more deterministic than not, and with perfect information, one could probably predict the future almost perfectly, at least on Earth, for maybe a few hundred years out.   Everyone invokes the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to refute determinism. I would argue that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not relevant. The HUP says that for a single electron, you cannot know how it behaves on a nearly instantaneous time scale. But the HUP only applies to objects the size of electrons, even the nuclei of atoms are too large to be described quantum mechancially. So basically all of chemistry, at least on the timescale greater than nanoseconds, can be described by classical mechanics, which is deterministic.  So in order for quantum mechanics to affect classical mechanics, the real question is, at what time scale would quantum-mechanical HUP effects at the electron level yield emergent, observable differences in the classical regime? My guess is that it doesn't. The law of large numbers says that when you have a probability distribution that is sampled many times, you will tend to average to the expected value. That is why the casino always wins. The ""large-numberness"" of sampling the wavefunction in classical mechanics is enormous, I probably could not write down the tremendous number that describes how often a wavefunction is sampled in a cubic centimeter every second. In the Hellman-Feynman theorem, which describes forces in molecules, all chemical forces are a function of the probability wavefunction, not the instantaneous sampling of the wavefunction. So essentially, the timescale on which quantum effects actually translates to the classical regime is probably sub-femtosecond, and any quantum perturbations from the classical description are probably canceled out immediately.   As for consciousness, we do not have a strong enough understanding of how consciousness works, although we do understand the size-regime of neural circuits, and the mechanistic operation of neural dendrites is certainly larger than their corresponding de broglie wavelengths, suggesting that they too, can be described classically. So in my opinion, it is more likely than not that our observable world, including the decisions of the consciousness, is largely deterministic.   Tl;dr: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle only applies to instantaneous probabilities at the electron-size scale. Most of chemistry happens on length- and time- scales far far greater than that, and so can probably be described classically, which is deterministic."
AskScienceDiscussion,35tjpl,IHTFPhD,13,Wed May 13 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"But the HUP only applies to objects the size of electrons, even the nuclei of atoms are too large to be described quantum mechancially.   HUP applies to anything, the uncertainty just diminishes with the mass. But since there are plenty of chaotic systems out there, any microscopic uncertainty is going to be amplified into the macroscopic realm quickly.   And as for HUP only applying to electron-sized objects, it is necessary for the double split experiment to work, right? The double split experiment has been performed with molecules with molecular masses in the thousands, so you have to extend it to at least that size."

Let's review what the double-slit experiment implies: the probability density of discrete particles shot through two slits tends to a wave-like distribution, rather than a particle-like distribution.   In the coarse-grained, mean-field world we live in, which is really an average of gatrillion jazillion etc probabilistic events, the overall behavior is the same. So, even if particles behaved 'quantum-mechanically', their large-scale counterparts would still act classically. This is a fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics, known as the Ehrenfest Theorem"

The current vogue is to explore if the universe is finite and therefore computable- which is an exciting idea of we're looking for the final ToE.

It seems to be a basic property of the universe.  So ""God"" can know the exact momentum and position of an atom, but not an electron."

AskScienceDiscussion,35tjpl,The_Wisenheimer,2,Wed May 13 14:14:04 2015 UTC,". That is why the casino always wins. The ""large-numberness"" of sampling the wavefunction in classical mechanics is enormous, I probably could not write down the tremendous number that describes how often a wavefunction is sampled in a cubic centimeter every second. In the Hellman-Feynman theorem, which describes forces in molecules, all chemical forces are a function of the probability wavefunction, not the instantaneous sampling of the wavefunction. So essentially, the timescale on which quantum effects actually translates to the classical regime is probably sub-femtosecond, and any quantum perturbations from the classical description are probably canceled out immediately.   Wouldn't quantum uncertainty cause uncorrectable errors to slowly accumulate in any simulation detailed down to the atomic level?    Let's say I throw a baseball.  The probability of any quantum uncertainty causing a simulation to not correctly predict the behavior of the baseball is too low to worry about.  But by contrast, a lot of macroscopic events (like computers and the brain) can be affected by quantum events.  In this hypothetical simulation, for instance, you cannot predict where every single photon or particle is going to hit, because that is governed by the uncertainty principle.  But we know that a single cosmic ray striking sensitive electronics can cause uncorrectable errors or misbheavior in those electronics and it would be reasonable to hypothesize that this could occur in human decision making too.  So even though these are nominally classical systems, they can occasionally be affected by quantum events.  I'm not going to run through any scenarios where a computer randomly crashing or a person randomly having a brain fart might change the course of human history, but the point is, if we are simulating the entire known universe, it would seem to me that there are probably enough cases where quantum randomness interacts with the macroscopic world to cause the simulation to not predict reality correctly, and eventually these errors would build up."

Not just Schrödinger cat questions like /u/The_Serious_Account suggests, but other cases where quantum physics plays some role in macroscopics, like neutron stars (e.g. predicting when collapse occurs). Also, permanent magnets and even metals need some quantum mechanics for good quantitative accuracy - for example, the classical Drude model for metals is OK, but is pretty bad for predicting heat capacity, which would accumulate large errors quickly.

AskScienceDiscussion,35tjpl,college_pastime,2,Wed May 13 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"For future states of the universe, no. There are probabilistic processes that exist in the universe, like radioactive decay. You would not be able to predict the exact moment a uranium atom decays just by knowing the exact positions and velocities of all of the particles in the universe and having a sufficiently complex equation of state. It just wouldn't be possible. So at some point in the future, the state of the universe will depart from its current trajectory because of random events.  As for the past, everyone is bringing quantum mechanics into the mix to try and explain why it isn't possible to calculate past (or future) states of the universe. I think I have a simpler reason: the existence of many-to-one (surjective) functions. For example, the MD5 hash function. In your equation of state would be encoded all of the MD5 hashes that currently exist (albeit in an obfuscated form). You would not be able to reverse time and map those MD5 hashes back onto the input that generated them, even if you knew the classical trajectories of all of the particles that were involved in the computation of those hashes. This is because for every output of the MD5 function there are an infinity of inputs that can generate it (theoretically, technically you are limited by the maximum possible amount of information that can be encoded in the universe). It would be impossible to work backwards from the output to get the correct input. So, if you can't compute the past of many-to-one functions you can't compute the past at all."

Unfortunately it has few, if any features allowing us to scroll forwards and backwards through time.

AskScienceDiscussion,35tjpl,monkeydave,3,Wed May 13 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"According to the current accepted understanding of physics, no.  Quantum mechanics contains the uncertainty principal. That is, it is fundamentally impossible to know both the position (coordinates) and the momentum (trajectory) of any particle to an exact degree. Even with time frozen, there is required to be an uncertainty on the order of planks constant. Now, this uncertainty is very small, so small that it wouldn't show up until something like the 33rd decimal place. But this uncertainty would eventually cause your predictions to brake down.  And this uncertainty isn't a product of our limited ability to measure. Instead, it's that all objects exist as a wave, and that 'waveness' means that you can never exactly predict what it will do next.  There is still some debate on whether uncertainty is truly fundamental to the universe or just our best understanding of the universe, but the evidence seems to point to the former."

AskScienceDiscussion,35x0vu,GarretKadeDupre,7,Thu May 14 05:35:11 2015 UTC,"No. GPS does not violate special relativity. The ultimate failure in the derivation is a subtly of what light speed invariance means and why were are only justified to measure proper speeds with clocks in inertial situations. This is a matter of coordinate speed and physical speed and the same issue arises when considering the recession speeds in Hubble expansion and I'll equate the two in the end of this essay.  Consider a fiber optic cable rung around the Earth like a hula hoop or ring. Now image that this cable ring rotates left--Alright, we have the Sagnac effect. Let's consider sending a signal down the cable in the direction of rotation, eventually the light comes back on the other size, let's consider the time it took to traverse the 2piR distance,    dT(Left) = T2 - T1 = r*d(phi)/(c+v) = 2piR/(c+v)   Now let's consider the light going right,    dT(Right) = T2' - T1' = 2piR/(c-v)     Quite strange. Let's notice what our effective speed of light looks like, for small angles we can take like to travel roughly in a Cartesian direction, r*d(phi) --> ~ds  c(eff.) = ds/dT = c +/- v     This looks damning, have we broken c invariance? No. We have not. There's an issue with what we've done, we've assumed that ds/dT is a speed that an inertial observer would witness. We've left out that dT is not an inertial time. We know this because if you look at the Langevin coordinates,    ds^2 = -(1-(wr/c)^2*c^2*dT^2 + 2wr*dr*d(phi)*dT + other terms     plain as day we see we're not in an inertial frame.    cdt = sqrt((1 - (wr/c)^2)c^2)*dT ~ (c +/- v)dT     You can always know if you're dealing with an accelerated frame by simply looking at the metric. If the coefficient of c2dT2 is anything but +/-1 then you're not in an inertial frame. Being in an inertial frame is very important to c invariance, I'll explain soon. First let's fix out c(eff.) mistake.  ds/dt = ds/((c+/-v)dT) = c     Now that we've reclaimed our inertial time coordinate, we instantly regain the invariant speed of light! What's wrong with ds/dT why does invariance seemingly fail? Simply put, you must invoke time coordinates that are inertial because otherwise you cannot synchronize your clocks! Imagine I want to set up two spatially separated clocks,    ClockA -------- ClockB     How do I ensure they both tick away together when I'm sitting at A with both clocks? I have to transport them, imagine I do so very carefully, I move very slowly so the dilation during the transport is small. I am safe in knowing that once I get to B and stop, the dilation can be fixed and I can travel between A and B safe in the knowledge that both clocks are ticking away synchronized and thus give me times I can directly compare.  Here's the problem, in accelerated frames such spatial slice synchronization is impossible! The rotating ring is one such situation, if I transport one clock to B, it will immediately being diverging from the clock at A! I no longer have any right to claim proper time measurements using such clocks. This isn't a problem unique to rotating rings either, any acceleration spoils the coordinates and spoils my speed of light measurement. In an Einstein elevator, one that is accelerating in z-direction, the same thing occurs!    c(eff.) = dz/dT = c(1+gz/c^2)     If I recast dT to my inertial time,    dz/dt = dz/((1+gz/c^2)dT) = c     Invariance saved once again! The same thing happens with hovering around a black hole in the Schwarzschild metric, but I'll stop writing out endless examples. I just want to make very clear, this is not a rotation problem uniquely, this is an acceleration problem.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_coordinates   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_synchronisation   http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9909081v7 (Very helpful paper it walks through all these examples including the rotating ring Sagnac effect.)     Lastly let's discuss coordinate speed in FLRW Hubble expansion. Consider a null geodesic,  cdt = a(t)*dX   a(t) = scale factor, grows with time   dX = comoving distance (not proper distance)     Let's consider two different ways to define velocity,    a(t)dX/dt = c     This above is a true speed, a(t)dX represents dx or proper distance measured by an inertial observer. We are justified in that our measurement can occurred with a field of clocks completely synchronized and distanced and at rest.  dX/dt = c/a(t)     This is a coordinate speed in comoving coordinates, as you can see, the speed of light bleeds away to zero as the universe expands, but this isn't what speed of light invariance is all about, you need to consider dx/dt which will always be c no matter what.

However, I feel you only addressed part of the problems I raised in the original post.  Although I agree you proved that in principle lightspeed anisotropy can be measured in a way consistent with Special Relativity, my post was a little more specific.    For example, you say that:   Consider a fiber optic cable rung around the Earth like a hula hoop or ring. Now image that this cable ring rotates left--Alright, we have the Sagnac effect.

But GPS signals co-rotating with Earth travel at an apparent speed of c-v, and counter-rotating ones at c+v, where v is the angular velocity of the Earth at a particular longitude (latitude?).  Read the signs carefully...  That's the opposite of what would be expected from your hoola hoop example!  So the empirical data would seem to demonstrate your resolution is superficial, but I'm looking forward to be corrected if I made a mistake somewhere.  There is another point I don't feel you addressed but I will shelve that concern for now."
AskScienceDiscussion,35x0vu,AsAChemicalEngineer,6,Fri May 15 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"Did I mix up left and right? I pulled those values from the paper you linked to by S. Gift, the author's mathematics is correct so I just copied their result to first order, if you look up Born coordinates on Wikipedia, the same result is there. The signs aren't important to my argument, the importance is the deviation c+/-v and how recasting ourselves in an inertial frame is where light speed invariance lives kills that deviation. Despite having correct mathematics, the author fundamentally doesn't understand the tight conditions you need to have invariant c. A rotating frame breaks that! It's so strange, the author uses special relativity to derive a coordinate speeds and then says special relativity is broken because we're allowed to define coordinate speeds straight from the mathematics of special relativity? Madness.  It's like they're arguing that English doesn't exist by writing a manifesto in English.     Although you proved that in principle lightspeed anisotropy can be measured in a way consistent with Special Relativity     Here's what you need to understand about c invariance, you need nothing less than flat space and an inertial frame. If you don't have that, your measurement speed can easily deviate from c. Inertial frames are no optional requirement. Further more, in general relativity, everything goes to hell. In curved spacetime, the only way to regain c invariance is to do the measurement locally and in an inertial frame. At least in special relativity (flat spacetime) we could at least do nonlocal measurements for c invariance, but general relativity spoils that perk. In every ""gotcha"" argument against relativity I've ever seen and ever heard of has disobeyed those conditions without exception. Special relativity says truly deep things about the universe, but it does so only under the most fragile care."

The paper seems to be arguing that approximating Earth, which rotates, as a non-rotating inertial reference frame in which to apply Special Relativity, is not a good approximation.   The paper is arguing that large-scale measurements confirm the General Relativity prediction of East-West lightspeed anisotropy which Special Relativity does not permit to exist at small-scales.  It emphasizes that the General Relativity prediction holds for all scales-- even local scales-- in apparent violation of Special Relativity.  It also argues, according to my understanding of it, that there is no apparent justification for why lightspeed can travel faster Westward than Eastward when measured between two points situated at the same longitude separated by a vast distance, but not whenever they are separated by a much smaller distance.   This GPS east-west light travel time differential... formally establishes the fact that light takes longer to travel East than West between fixed points on the surface of the Earth, an experimental observation the general relativity theory prediction of light speed anisotropy in the east-west direction... directly conflicts with the local principle of light speed constancy on the surface of the Earth and this apparent inconsistency has never been resolved.   If lightspeed anisotropy (specifically greater Westward lightspeed) is permissible on large scales, say between A and B on the equator separated by a thousand miles, then how close would A and B have to be positioned relative to each other before the anisotropy must disappear, in order for Special Relativity to be consistent with the data?    The GPS Sagnac Effect correction corrects for Westward light traveling over 1,000 mph faster than Eastward light (assuming point A and B are both on the equator). Does this anisotropy decrease on smaller and smaller scales?  I'd be curious to know at exactly what scale the anisotropy disappears, since intuition would suggest that reducing the scale would not affect it.  In fact, intuition would suggest that nothing short of changing the angular velocity of Earth would alter the magnitude of the anisotropy as measured between two points at the same longitude.   some people, who made that approximation and who found experimental problems with it, then misapplied the Sagnac effect to explain their data.

This is a debate straight out of the 1880s.    Impossible.  The Sagnac Effect was not discovered until 1913.   There were a lot of hints that (group) velocity addition wasn't linear before Michelson-Morley   This thread has absolutely nothing to do with Galilean velocity addition.  I'm not predicting the results of the traditional Sagnac Effect; I'm merely recording the data, which says that lightspeed is c+v.    If you're going to deny this fact, you've got a lot of work to do refuting all the work done on the Sagnac Effect for over a century."
AskScienceDiscussion,35x0vu,Ghosttwo,2,Fri May 15 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"It emphasizes that the General Relativity prediction holds for all scales-- even local scales-- in apparent violation of Special Relativity.   That's not because of a ""violation"" of Special Relativity.  Special relativity just only talks about inertial reference frames.  The Earth fixed frame is not inertial, it rotates.   It also argues, according to my understanding of it, that there is no apparent justification for why lightspeed can travel faster Westward than Eastward when measured between two points situated at the same longitude separated by a vast distance, but not whenever they are separated by a much smaller distance.   I read it as providing a justification, based on General Relativity.   If lightspeed anisotropy (specifically greater Westward lightspeed) is permissible on large scales, say between A and B on the equator separated by a thousand miles, then how close would A and B have to be positioned relative to each other before the anisotropy must disappear, in order for Special Relativity to be consistent with the data?   It sounds like it's not an issue of scale, but of rotation.  Special relativity works perfectly fine at large scales.  It just needs inertial references frames and flat space.  And it works approximately when you don't have that, but how good an approximation this is seems to be all this paper is about.   On what basis do you claim that who misapplied the Sagnac Effect?   The paper says:   The notion that the CCIR clock synchronization algorithm works since light travels at speed c with the so-called “Sagnac correction” necessary because of the rotation of the Earth is an invalid interpretation that encourages belief in a constant light speed c.  [...]  The Sagnac effect should no longer be viewed as a necessary time correction in GPS operation arising from the rotation of the Earth since no such correction is necessary if the true speed of light is used in the travel time determination.  [...]  As a result of Selleri’s derivation of the correction, he concluded “The procedure which we suggest to experimentalists is to avoid using a wrong velocity of light and correcting the result with an ad hoc term, but rather to use from the beginning the velocity of light [... ] of the inertial transformations.”  [...]  These fully consistent theoretical and experimental results demonstrating light speed anisotropy in the Earth Centered Earth Fixed frame suggest that the principle of light speed constancy really is inapplicable in the rotating frame of the surface of the Earth.   Basically I think it's saying, approximating that Special Relativity holds in the only-approximately-inertial Earth-fixed reference frame, and then applying Sagnac correction, isn't quite right.  And instead, it's proposing a better way to do the math based on General Relativity.  Honestly any more in depth and this quickly goes over my head."

General Relativity predicts a lightspeed difference of 2,000 mph, and this number doesn't change depending on whether the measurement is made on a large scale (say, between two GPS satellites) or on a small scale (within an Earth-bound lab).  I don't understand how arguing the lab frame is only ""approximately"" inertial will resolve the inconsistency, since the scale does not seem to have any effect on the General Relativity prediction."

Generally speaking, fears about negative impacts on health caused by eating GMOs (as opposed to, say, those coming from changes in pesticide use) are baseless.  There is no reason to believe that any of the GMO foods so far approved are going to cause any sort of health problems.  Now, there are legitimate concerns to be raised and discussed, like those surrounding business practices and how farmers are impacted, and like the risk of trans-genes escaping into the wild, and so forth.

The question is more about the individual products, and that's case by case.  Corn, even non-GMO, is primarily seeds owned by seed companies that have to be bought each year (in part due to the nature of hybridization), bad results can happen from cross-breeding, as well (like killer bees). The advances in creating new strains that led to the Green Revolution and championed by Norman Borlaug were, at the time, attacked as not natural, in somewhat the same way that GMOs are attacked now, but prevented starvation for hundreds of millions.

It's effectively a new plant that we created for consumption.  We have been modifying the foods we eat for thousands of years; the ability to directly alter the genetic code is not a huge divergence from what we've done in the past, but rather it gives us the ability to be far more controlling. In the past, you'd mix two plants with different traits we liked, and hope you got what you wanted, and there could've been other segments of genetic code that you got added in there that you weren't after.

When working with standard eukaryotic cells typically we use plasmid DNA as a delivery vector because its nice and easy. That's an issue if you want to use it for humans as by their very nature plasmids can easily jump between species (one of the ways antibiotic resistance is transferred). They don't use that for plant transgenics, T-DNA is used (inserts DNA through tumour growths, TIL) which is much better for consumption as the genes are directly incorporated into the genome, not just carried in plasmid. Therefore it's highly unlikely that incorporated genes will jump into your microbiome.

AskScienceDiscussion,35qp6h,Lowbacca1977,2,Wed May 13 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"Again, it depends on how you do it. Plasmids could be used but these are usually used for trying to insert a single or only a few genes at a time. We have better techniques for genome insertion these days especially as the cost of synthesising long stretches of DNA is pretty cheap now.  For example, say I want to put in some genes for growth larger, quicker, and being more healthy for you (or whatever), this would be something we would probably do before an embryo is formed. So you would synthesis a large stretch of DNA (like +10kbp) containing the genes you want in the middle with a suffix and prefix region capping the DNA. These regions are designed to correspond to a particular region of the genome where you want them to go allowing you to exploit homologous recombination. This is pretty good for inserting into genomic DNA. Problem is, I don't think it would be useful for large scale industrial farming unless you only want to use a small group of chickens for your stock and just clone them or use them for a breeding stock to try and maintain the incorporated genes being kept in the bloodline. So until we can do that easily to hundreds of animal embryos at once, its going to be hard to maintain a useful level of genetic diversity for this approach."

AskScienceDiscussion,35qp6h,Lowbacca1977,3,Wed May 13 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"There's always a risk of gene transfer between what we eat and our gut flora, but so far as I know there's no documented increased horizontal gene transfer of DNA that has been inserted via T-DNA. Genes that are inserted do have special flanking sequences that target them for insertion, but the insertion requires specific enzymes that transgenic plants lack, and I've never heard of T-DNA inserts spontaneously looping out.  In a recent AMA, plant scientist Kevin Folta comments on this. The gist is that we eat genes every day when we consume food and so far (millions of years) so good.

AskScienceDiscussion,35qp6h,tasunder,1 point,Wed May 13 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"There's no mechanism present in modern GMO usage that would, necessarily, make it any less healthy than the current modified forms of foods that we eat.   I find this to be a very interesting statement.  Since its early inception, Genetics as a technology has run parallel to natural processes.  This has meant considerable constraints regarding genetic compatibility and hybridization.  What we have now may follow the same mechanics as Gregor Mendel - however I would argue strongly that the constraints have widened considerably.  One of the biggest problems I see is centered around Big Agra's tendency to seek chemical solutions and downplay any possibility of danger.  Engineering a food to be more resistant to a pesticide is not a wholesome application of the technology, IMHO.  It supports a system that is ecologically unsound, and I prefer science to be used to benefit humankind in general, rather than a morally questionable board of directors and some wealthy shareholders at the expense of the rest of humanity.  And we see the unintended consequences pile up with regards to Glyphosate, which because of a false sense of safety, has been sprayed all over the place.  We see Colombia moving to ban it after its use by U.S.led anti-narco efforts across northern South America.  That's one small example of how this chemical has proliferated in our environment rather quickly.  The other problem is the rather expensive and somewhat ruthless PR campaign by Monsanto, Dow, and others to promote their applications and shout down any consideration of longer term safety issues.  That should concern anyone examining the issue.  It might not be tomatoes with spider genes we should be worried about, it's corn designed to endure massive amounts of poison, and the false sense of safety that might be giving us."

Your assertion is correct, but still ridiculous in light of how these crops are developed - Glyphosate-based pesticides and GMOs like Round-up Ready Soybeans are designed by the same company in conjunction with each other - that's the whole point.  GMO tech and pesticides are a HUGE part of the way this tech is being applied.  I already conceded your point about the mechanics of GMOs - I'm here to refute any assertion that just because the mechanics of the genetic mutation are controlled and natural, the application is wholesome and healthy for humans and the environment.    So we see, it IS an issue, and one exacerbated by one example of GMO application which happens to have negative consequences in the real world.   I'm not asserting that GMOs don't have a place in our agriculture - what I am telling you is that at least one implementation of this tech - fucking sucks, i.e., leads to environmental pollution that ends up in breast milk, as that's just a single example - as research in this area is contentious and controversial. And the issue is quite political, with governmental bodies ignoring real evidence of toxicities.  GMOs are controversial not because people don't understand Genetics - it's because people don't trust the company that is developing some of these organisms - due to their political machinations and the manner in which these chemicals gain approval, and they way they handle their tech in the real world."

That's a subset of GMO use, though. For a question that's a simple thing of if GMOs are okay or not, there's nothing that makes them intrinsically bad. Applications are separate. For example, tomatoes that have longer shelf lives or golden rice with more nutrients are totally outside of the pesticide arguments.  You say that GMOs aren't controversial because people don't understand genetics, but a huge portion of the criticisms I've heard are entirely about that. I have heard some criticisms tied to Monsanto's business model, or how they use pesticides, but the majority of what I hear has to deal with the idea that people think GMOs themselves aren't safe, not just implementation.  If the question is ""do I eat this apple that's genetically modified or this apple that isn't"" my point is that there's no reason to presume that that there's a danger in the genetically modified one.

With respect to he plate choice, your hypothetical subject knows exactly how the two plates differ, and can make a choice.  I would go so far as to say that the fact that one is provably dangerous is also a moot point - what I'm saying is that this person is informed of the differences between the two options.  With the apple, the only choice is 'natural' or 'modified'.  Nowhere in there does it say how the apple is modified.  This may seem like a pointless distinction, but in light of a recent story where a man died from anyphylactic shock as a result of eating tomatoes that had been laced with shellfish protein (to which he was highly allergic), you can see my point.  (Holy crap.  While fact checking myself I just found that the whole thing was fake, from a satirical news site.  My apologies)  The distinction between an informed and uninformed choice stands, but I suppose the lethal consequences haven't occurred as I thought.

AskScienceDiscussion,35qp6h,NDaveT,12,Tue May 12 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"Whenever someone says ""we don't know the long-term effects"" of GMOs, they're almost always shifting the goal posts.  GMOs are one of the most highly scrutinised biological products we've ever produced. North Americans have been consuming GM foods with little fanfare for over 30 years. A study published last year looked at 29 years of animal feeding data and concluded that GM feeds were safe and nutritionally equivalent to non-GM feeds. If one study of 29 years of data isn't good enough for you, how about 1800 studies conducted over the course of 30 years that have shown no consistent health or nutritional problems? Both the WHO and AAAS have both issued statement endorsing the safety of GM foods. And, hilariously, a PNAS paper published in March has found that all sweet potatoes are [naturally transgenic].  Have you heard of AquaAdvantage Salmon? Simple modification that allows salmon to be farmed in one year instead of two. Economic and environmental win-win. It's been under FDA review since 1996 and it still hasn't been approved.  Moreover, not only is there no consistent evidence (outside of a small handful of very controversial/faulty studies) for GMOs posing particular health risks, there is not even a proposed mechanism by which GMOs would pose a special health risk. If you're actually worried about the impact of plant breeding on health, you should be worried about hybrids. When hybridizing plants, thousands of genes are randomly transferred. This can lead unpredictable effects such as - I wish I was kidding - hybrid grass which produces cyanide gas. By comparison, GMOs involve the transfer of a small number of genes, and cultivars have their genomes sequenced. Not only do we know what genes have been added, we know exactly where they are in the genome.  To conclude, no one is saying GMOs are a panacea for problems with agriculture. But they are a tremendously powerful tool that can help us increase the nutrition of crops, create crops that require fewer pesticides and fertilizer, create crops that can resist frost and drought, and rapidly add beneficial traits to local cultivars. It is possible that a given GMO may prove hazardous, but this risk is actually lower compared with alternative breeding methods. After 30 years of living with GMOs, in order to be entirely against them at this point you have to go out of your way looking for a reason."

AskScienceDiscussion,35qp6h,cmuadamson,5,Tue May 12 20:38:18 2015 UTC,"There are strategies to mitigate an evolutionary arms race. Namely, planting a fringe of non-GM crops around GM as a refuge for pests to prevent the pest population from developing significant resistance.  Falling too deep down the rabbit hole of ""how might pests and crops"" respond can be a bit of a fools errand. We can say the same thing regarding how does conventional agriculture impact the environment. The point is that GM give us a tool to reduce our reliance on pesticides and herbicides and that can only be viewed as a good thing.  It's also important to remember that anti-pest plants are just one kind of crop. There's potential for so much more (better nutrition, more tolerant to stress, more varieties of plants).

You write at length about the tech as if it's quite benign, however, current implementation has some serious flaws and yes, there are dangers.  The first is assuming the companies involved are altruistic entities that just want to save the world from starving.

This is something I see with anti-GMO stances a lot.  The last, which I will address first, is conflating fear of agribusiness conglomerates with dangers of GM technology. These things have literally nothing to do with one another. In fact, if you hate big agribusiness companies like Monsanto you should be petitioning for less regulation of GMOs. It currently costs billions to bring a new GMO to market due to (overzealous) regulation. This means only giant agribusiness companies can afford to bring GM products to market. If you treat GMOs like drugs, don't be surprised when the only companies left in the market look like pharma companies.  Glyphosphate-resistance isn't the only pest-control strategy. Bt-cotton has been incredibly successful in India, despite the media reporting otherwise. Bt-crops produce a peptide that stunts the growth of bores, worms, and other pests. Hilariously, organic farmers often sprinkle Bt-toxin around their crops except they likely do it in a less safe manner.  At the end of the day, genetic modification is a tool to improve plants and animals. How well it works depends entirely upon the people designing the modification and the people using the modified organisms. I'm sure you can dream up a hundred scenarios in which through ignorance or error a GMO could be dangerous or ineffective. However, I can just as easily come up with hundreds of scenarios of traditional farming practices being ineffective or dangerous (see: cyanide gas grass).  Stifling GM because of what it could improbably do is silly considering all the benefits it can probably introduce. With climate change we are entering an era of increased drought, flooding, heat waves, frosts, etc. GM provides an opportunity to create the next generation of crops and animals to feed ourselves with, and it provides us with the opportunity to do that in a far more environmentally sustainable way than ever before."

At the end of the day genetic modification is a neutral science that can be used successfully to improve our lives, OR it can be used irresponsibly or ignorantly and fuck up our lives.  As to your argument - it's like if GMOs were antibiotics - I feel you're trying to make it look like I'm saying 'we need to ban antibiotics outright', when what I'm really saying is closer to 'we need to better control implementation of antibiotics and curb egregious usage in farm animals', for instance.  Does that make sense?  I'm not attacking your knowledge and understanding, I'm attacking your vision of how GMOs get implemented and demanding a less Disney-fied version.  Glyphosate is the most popular pesticide in the world and the way it's regulated is political and appalling.  In the end, it doesn't much matter what I write here - the movement against glyphosate is gaining strength and hopefully this chemical will be banned and replaced with better practices.

But this is not a huge issue, as saving seeds hasn't been common practice for 80-odd years. 2nd generations are lower quality as the desired traits are bred out or diluted, so any farmer that values his livelihood (i.e. being able to sell a consistent product) isn't going to grow a substandard crop because he cheaped out on reusing seeds. It's far quicker, cheaper and more reliable to buy new seeds.  And of course they admit they sue farmers who save seed. You just have to look at the cases of when they've actually sued. The defendants aren't poor farmers struggling to eat and get by; it's simply a farmer purposely trying to rip the company off. Take Schmeiser (the poster-boy for the lawsuit complaint); the courts found that, rather than being the hapless victim of accidental cross-contamination, he had purposely and willingly spread a patented seed over 1,000+ acres to 95-98% purity to avoid having to pay $15,000 in royalties."

AskScienceDiscussion,35qxvi,Singularity22,3,Tue May 12 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"hello, radio astronomer here, I can tell you that the problem is not that simple. Optical interferometry suffers from quite a few problems that radio does not, but the principles are the same. You can put two elements further away and that would increase your resolution, however you lose information at larger angular scales. For example the VLA will classify an observation with maximum and minimum resolution elements. As such you lose sensitivity to larger scale structure. It is tempting to say the image will be twice as bright, therefore twice as sensitive, but you are losing information in a different way and one must be careful.   Secondly, those of us who do interferometry like to measure everything in units of temperature. This is not typical temeprature mind you, but one that is analog to signals.  This is nice for determining signal to noise. The Temperature of the optical night sky is extremely high and dominates all but the brightest sources. So your image may be twice as bright with two elements, but the noise from the sky will likely dominate your image.   http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA.shtml  Here is a crash course in interferometry from a radio perspective. The principles are the same as in optical. The section on Radiometers and interferometers I and II will hopefully answer your questions in depth."

AskScienceDiscussion,35qxvi,Neon_42,1 point,Wed May 13 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"Your contrast depends on the sensitivity of your receivers. It is a Dynamic range problem. Moving the scopes farther away means you are literally no longer sensitive to wider angles. This emission will not be detected. Imagine decomposing an image into its fourier components. You will see that there any image is composed of structures of various lengths. Building an interferometer means you will always lose the largest structures so in your fourer space set those to zero. The longest baselines of your array determine your minimum resolution so remove all the structures smaller than your resolution an set them to zero. Now fourier transform back to the image plane and you will see what I mean. Your dynamic range/contrast will still be the same, but you will lose information.  THe link below has a good intuitive explanation of how this works with some images that remove long and short baselines.   http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/fourier/fourier.html"

The change in t matches up with the Lorentz factor. I'm sure this doesn't make sense for reasons I don't understand.  ehh, actually this makes no sense. math does, but not the way I explained it or units used."
AskScienceDiscussion,35qs84,dirty_d2,2,Tue May 12 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"Been a while since I've done the math, but I think your math is a bit off.  First off your units - you have sqrt(m2 + s2) = m/s - ? How does this make sense? I tried running your equation to calculate, say, time dilation for a velocity of 0.5c, but obviously didn't work. Actual dilation is ~1.155 (see this), but your equation when worked out for t gives nothing similar.  The only equation I recall similar to that is the space-time interval, defined as S2. (E: fixed the sign of the time term)   S2 = dX2 - c2 * dT2   where dX is the euclidean distance (sqrt(dx2 + dy2 + dz2 )) in space, and dT is the time interval passed as measured from your reference frame.  if you take a particle like a photon traveling though an ideal vacuum, for any two 'events' along its path, the metric will always be 0. So this would make the equation:   dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c2 * dT2 = 0   or   c2 = (dx2 + dy2 + dz2 )/dT2   ... and now that i worked it out, that really doesn't tell you much, except how the speed of light is related to time and euclidean distance for a particle moving at the speed of light.  Again, I could easily be mistaken, but can you clarify how the math from your comment matches up to the Lorentz factor?"
AskScienceDiscussion,35qs84,bloodygames,1 point,Wed May 13 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"if an objects velocity is (c/2, 0, 0) in (x, y, z) the Lorentz factor is 1.155. substituting in that velocity, t must be reduced to c/1.155 to maintain the vector length of c. I just mean the reduction of t matches up with how much time is slowed for that object.  sqrt((c/2)2 + 02 + 02 + (c/1.155)2) = c  I realize it doesn't make much sense beyond that."
AskScienceDiscussion,35qs84,dirty_d2,1 point,Wed May 13 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"So, mathematically this idea doesn't make sense?"
AskScienceDiscussion,35qs84,diazona,2,Fri May 15 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"The formula is actually sqrt(vx2 + vy2 + vz2 - c2 vt2), but that's exactly the right idea. Note that the variables here have to represent differences between coordinates, not positions."
