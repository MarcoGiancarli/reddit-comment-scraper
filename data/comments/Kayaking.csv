Kayaking,3e5dit,revaeb,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"In Canada (USA is different1 ) each club puts on a ""CanoeKids"" program (which I joined before that moniker) which teaches the basics in a very ""summer camp"" atmosphere - basically goofing off for 30 minutes, paddling for 30, and repeat for 3-6 hours. I did that when I was 14 (the oldest you'd want to enter like that), then joined their entry level competitive group, and got really into it because I finally found a sport and athletic activity that I enjoyed and didn't find stupidly frustrating. (This then led me to pick up xskiing, weight lifting, get better at swimming (before WW ruined it for me) and cycling). I've since spent over ten years racing and coaching.  1 - Every Canadian club sees itself as a place where you have 10 year olds learning to paddle and Olympians training at the same club. Some American clubs are more like that, others are more a ""racing team"" and it's just oriented towards performance, and developing athletes for Nationals/Junior Worlds/Worlds."

Kayaking,3e40vn,TheFlyingDavenport,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Just did a 65-70 mile trip last weekend on a local slow river in Iowa.  My advice is make sure you pack your heaviest gear close to the center of the boat as it will help with turning. Bring lots of sunscreen, bug spray, and beverages. First aid kit also. Dry bags are a must to keep your gear from getting wet.   I don't think 10 miles would warrant an over night camp however. You will likely only need 4 hours to float that distance with minimal paddling."
Kayaking,3e40vn,mrwrigles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:12 2015 UTC,Go for it! Take it easy and let the current take you downstream.   The shakedown run is a good idea. I do kayak camping on Lake Superior. A kayak fully loaded with camping gear will handle much differently than an unloaded one. Practice loading your gear and distributing the weight.
Kayaking,3e3afe,fire-borne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Most around here agree that buying a used kayak is better worth the cost of one of those new. I bought used and I am glad I did. Many people are happy with their sundolphins though, so just peek on Craigslist and make your decision from there. Don't forget to budget in a paddle and life vest. Skimping on either will make your time out less enjoyable and less safe."

Kayaking,3e3nl5,breakfastlizard,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"Do you know how to wet exit? Because if you don't I recommend you get it down well before going on the river. Make sure to practice with other people around too. Being flipped over in a kayak can be a scary experience at first, so I'd recommend trying to get used to it before you get in rapids. If you don't you might panic and find yourself temporarily stuck in the boat-likely a situation you'd want to avoid."
Kayaking,3e3nl5,SalmonPowerRanger,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"I don't! I was a bit concerned about that as well. My husband worked for a rafting/kayaking agency and told this horror story of someone who'd gotten flipped over and trapped in their boat due to some freak circumstances, and he drowned.   I wonder if they'll give me a little instruction before shipping me off? Or if it's just ""have a nice day, see you later!""  How would you recommend practicing? Just flipping the boat over and trying to get out?"
Kayaking,3e3nl5,SalmonPowerRanger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"I recommend starting on dry land first. Set the boat on a flat piece of land hull down, get in the boat, put the sprayskirt fully on, and practice tucking forward onto the deck, taking off the skirt, and pushing yourself out of the boat. See this video for specifics of how to do it. Once you feel comfortable doing it on land, find a calm stretch of water or a pool to practice in. I highly recommend doing this part with other people around, just in case. Practice a few times and you'll get the hang of it, the hardest part of this is fighting your own instinct to panic when you're trapped underwater, and doing it some in a controlled environment will help with that.   Once you feel confident you can try it out on the river, but I'd highly recommend that you have someone who knows what they're doing along with you. From your responses in this thread it sounds like you've never been in a kayak before. I worry about your ability to control the boat, catch eddies, and self-rescue. It's highly unlikely you'll die, but its possible you could have a pretty shitty day if you go out there, flip in a rapid, don't know how to get your boat to shore, and end up swimming for a long time or hiking out midway through. Trust me, I've done it before, it's not fun.   Anyway, if it's possible try to find someone else who can look after you and your gear if this is your first time. Where are you located, btw? There are plenty of local paddling communities in most parts of the states that host beginner trips and have people willing to meet up and paddle with beginners. Whatever you do, I hope you have fun out there.  P.S: Stay away from trees in the river, and if you swim keep your feet off the bottom."

Kayaking,3e3nl5,Eloth,2,Tue Jul 21 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"A bit of info that helped me steer was to lean opposite the direction you want to move. Coupled with a long sweep, you can turn 120-degrees at once. Get to know how much you can lean before you start to tip before leaving the dock and keep you paddle in the water."
Kayaking,3e3nl5,noccusJohnstein,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"That's only really useful for sea kayaks and WWR boats; WW boats (and presumably rec boats) will turn best on a sweep when flat. WW boats should be leant slightly into the turn when moving to avoid catching edges, but a stationary sweep should always be flat."
Kayaking,3e3nl5,Eloth,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"With what I've seen in terms of rental kayaks, I doubt they'll be renting true WW kayaks.

I've never been in anything shorter than 10'- which is what I tend to see at rental places."

Besides the weight you have to carry you are stressing the hull in a way it was designed to take stress. You should even load your boat on dry ground unless you know it is supported completely along the hull.

In practice it's not always possible to load or unload your boat in the water when waves are crashing on the beach, or rain is pouring on you... or simply you are wasting a lot of time moving things back and forth from the loading / unloading spot due to the terrain.

If you are a more average paddler, as crazy as it sounds, a 'fast' boat can be slower at cruising speed than a slow boat.  I have people buy plans for my boats with faster speed potential when they are just average paddlers that will never do more than an occasional sprint. Some of my other, slower designs actually have lower resistance at the 2-3 mph speed were most of us spend 99% of our time."

Some have gps, some have alert systems, it comes down to where you're going to be paddling, how extreme the conditions (if you're paddling solo in Alaska I would go with a gps locator one so if anything happened people would be notified...) I mostly paddle in safe-ish coastal areas so just being able to contact other paddlers and the coastguard is enough for me.   As far as using it, there's many resources online for it.

This kayak will mostly be used for flat water putzing.. and moseying.. but I do want the option of kayak camping, rivers, and maybe some more adventurous endeavors.. but those things wouldn't be that frequent."
Kayaking,3dynck,meohmy13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"I have a LL Remix XP9.  I spent 10+ years surfing a sit-on-top but over time I've moved farther from the ocean and my parents sold their little condo at the beach.  I am fortunate in my current town to have ready access to some calm, flat rivers and lakes, so I started looking for a better boat.  My surf boat is a blast in the ocean but is just awful in flat water.  But I would like to get into WW in the near future and I still go surfing a few times a year and wanted something that I could use for surf/WW but would at least still be pleasant to paddle on the flat water, so the crossovers seemed a good choice.    I don't really have anything to compare it against, so I'll just give you some thoughts on it...  First, the cockpit is a pretty tight fit.  I like this, others may not (although I am 5'7"" so you may not find it quite so tight).  My surf boat is fully outfitted with a backrest and leg straps, so I am used to feeling ""connected"" to the boat with my legs and hips, so much so that when I take it in flat water I still use the leg straps because it feels disconcerting to not be connected to the boat.  Note that the Stinger XP has a slightly smaller cockpit opening than the XP9 even thought it's a good bit bigger of a boat.    The skeg does exactly what you imagine it does.  Drop that skeg down and it keeps pretty much on course.  But folks here (myself included) will caution to not rely on the skeg at the expense of learning/practicing good stroke technique.  Without the skeg, the XP9 is extremely unforgiving (it's a WW boat at it's core and it behaves like one in flat water)...a few minor technical errors in stroke will send you spinning.  But if you paddle correctly, it will go in a straight line.  I make it a point to spend at least 5-10 min paddling without the skeg during every session.  It's good for your technique, plus that skeg can break so it's good to know how to paddle effectively without it.    It's biggest weakness is speed.  It's short and stubby and pretty pokey.  I am a strong paddler and I can about keep it at top speed but at the end of the day it can physically only go so fast and people with longer, pointier boats will outrun me any day of the week.  By way of example, my ""regular run"" is a 5 mile loop.  There is an annual race here and the winners are usually around 40 minutes...I can sometimes do it in under an hour.    It also doesn't have a ton of storage.   I did some digging on the Vertex.  It's 8.5' and weighs 38 lbs.  You'll be hard pressed to find something smaller/lighter, so I think you'll always have to fight to get the boat on/off the car and down to the water.  But, still take note of the specs of any boat you consider.  The Stinger XP looks great but it's 12' and 55 lbs, so it's going be that much more cumbersome to move around.  Another thing to consider is the minimum weight capacity - if you're under that, you may find that you need to add ballast to get optimal performance.    Anyway, I like the XP9 quite a bit, but honestly I'm not sure if you really need a crossover.  If you're really not that interested in getting into surf or WW, what options do you really need?  They often say that ""all around"" boats are not great at anything (or in some cases bad at everything).  If the chances of you taking your boat into a WW or surf situation are very slim, then instead of compromising on flat water performance ""just in case"" you go in moving water, you might be much better served getting more of a light touring boat that will be faster and have more storage for camping.  If you start getting into whitewater later on, then you can deal with that eventuality when the time comes.    You're in a good position as having an actual budget compared to many of our posters who are wondering what's the best boat under $200 including PFD and paddle (don't forget to budget for PFD and paddle), so do plenty of research, test paddle as much as you can if at all possible, and don't forget that you can get a lot more boat for your dollar if you buy secondhand.    In any case if you have any specific questions about the XP9, let me know."
Kayaking,3dynck,meohmy13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all of the info!  I suppose, if the call of WW really gets to me.. I'll just get another boat. If I really want it that badly. But for now, yes, I suppose a touring boat may be better. I don't want something too huge though. Yes, I definitely want something longer than 8ft.. in fact.. I'd like something relatively long. Again, I'd really like speed and good tracking.. something with a skeg. I wouldn't say that I'm a beginner kayaker because I've been kayaking for years.. but I don't really know much either. I don't know what a good paddle technique looks like. I mean, if I was able to get the Vertex going in a relatively straight line, given that it basically wants to turn with every stroke and is one of the stumpiest boats out there, does that mean I have a good paddling technique?  And yeah, for budget.. I would prefer something around $600.. but I will go up to $1000 if it's worth my money. I bought Kastle skis after demoing them because they were amazing and preformed far better than some of the lower end skis. So. Even though I'm not made of tons and tons of money.. I'm willing to spend what I have on something good!  Would I need a ballast in just about any boat if I'm 107lbs?  And... where can I test paddle boats! Somewhere on the east coast/New England perhaps? I also probably won't be purchasing until next summer.. or the winter.. so will that mean that whatever model I tried out will have gone on sale? Are there winter sales? Do they come out with new models yearly the way they do with skis?  Thanks!"

Yes, I definitely want something longer than 8ft.. in fact.. I'd like something relatively long. Again, I'd really like speed and good tracking.. something with a skeg.     A lot of tracking and speed comes from the hull shape, and you'll find that a lot of longer boats track just fine without a skeg and are reasonably fast.  I'd consider it a nice feature on any boat but not necessarily a must-have especially on something longer than 12'.  A lot of boats you can add one if you really want it, too.     if I was able to get the Vertex going in a relatively straight line...does that mean I have a good paddling technique?     Not necessarily....I paddled my surf boat horribly for 10 solid years.  I had read about how to do it, and thought I was doing it correctly but I was dead wrong!  My surf boat zig zags with every stroke, but it can't spin.  You'll never find yourself facing the wrong direction unintentionally.  Not so much with the XP9 where one second you're looking at where you want to go and the next second you're turned the opposite direction.  It surfaces your bad habits instantly.  You can do pretty well with $600, especially if you find something second hand.  Don't forget how durable they are....my surf boat is over 15 years old and aside from some scratches and fading it works as well as the day I got it.  Which is to say that, IMO, like good skis spending a few hundred dollars extra is worth the investment.     Would I need a ballast in just about any boat if I'm 107lbs?     Maybe!  Hard to say without paddling it, though.    Where to test paddle...this seems to get harder to find every day.  Call around to outdoorsy type stores.  Some will let you do a free ""test drive"" while others will basically charge a rental fee that they apply to the cost of the boat if you buy it.  Sometimes there are convention/boat show events where vendors will bring demos.  If you can find a canoe/kayak/WW club in your area they might be able to point you in the right direction.  Many brands come out with new model updates every year, and many stores also sell the demo boats they were using for test drives at the end of the warm season, so there is a chance of getting some discounts in the fall months if they have what you want.  It often feels like there is a better selection on Craigslist in the fall, too."
Kayaking,3dynck,milespaddled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited! Maybe I'll google around and find some place that does demos. Is it almost never a good idea to purchase during the summer? Always during the winter or getting the model you want when the new one comes out the next year?

As far as paddling technique, and I know that's not the topic of this post but.. how would you suggest improving? I don't know where I could take classes.. is it possible to just learn online. I saw a video on this subreddit of a man's improvement over the years and it was incredible! I'd love to be able to do that! Also, if I were to get a less forgiving boat and have all my flaws exposed because of it, it would still help me learn how to do it properly right? Maybe even improve my technique a little faster?"
Kayaking,3dynck,milespaddled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Is it almost never a good idea to purchase during the summer? Always during the winter or getting the model you want when the new one comes out the next year?     It's kind of like buying a car.  You can pay more and get exactly what you want in the spring/summer while everything is in stock, or you can wait until fall when they are clearing last year's models and demos where you'll pay less but you're limited to what the store has left, so you might not get the exact model or color or options you want.     Or, would you say that it's worth just getting one now and enjoying the rest of my summer and early fall with it?     Personally, I think they are too expensive to rush into buying.  With one exception being maybe used - if you can find a cheap but decent second hand boat on craiglist you could potentially sell it in the spring for about the same price if you don't like it.  Or you may find you love it and decide to just hang on to it.  You might as well keep an eye on CL either way.   As far as paddling technique, and I know that's not the topic of this post but.. how would you suggest improving?     We had a good thread here not too long ago.  There's a lot of instructional videos online, and you can also watch videos of racers.  That said, while I always knew what I was ""supposed"" to be doing (engaging my core/lower body, not using my forearms, etc), I thought I actually was doing that for a good 10 years until I started paddling with people who were knowledgable and pointed out that I was not doing that at all.     Also, if I were to get a less forgiving boat and have all my flaws exposed because of it, it would still help me learn how to do it properly right? Maybe even improve my technique a little faster?     Yes probably, but, only if you can troubleshoot your stroke and figure out what you're doing wrong and try to correct it.  It can be tedious and frustrating and at the end of the day even if you can make a whitewater boat go more or less straight in flat water if you concentrate, it's much nicer to not have to focus on it all of the time.  The crossovers are maybe nice in that regard but I still wouldn't recommend getting one just for that."

At the same time, do not underestimate the sound. You'll need sea worthy kayaks if you want to explore the sound. You should be ok without them if you stay within protected harbors. However, if they open up or if you want to explore, definitely only do it with sea worthy boats.   The sound can be peaceful and calm, and change to rough waters and lots of wind in a matter of minutes. So please be vigilant, be safe and wear your pfd's. I live in westchester so the sound is my #1 paddling spot, usually from Mamaroneck harbor and from Norwalk in Connecticut and we often go across to LI. It's a great spot to paddle.   If possible take a rescue class so you guys are comfortable getting back in your boats and assisting each other to do so. Unless you've already done it on your paddles upstate.   Cheers!"
Kayaking,3dwxib,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jul 20 12:17:13 2015 UTC,"/u/Yourbrainonscience - what is home base for you? There are endless choices, and I can try and find the right spot close to home. Easy to get to will mean you go out and play more often :)  I'm Huntington based, so know western Suffolk best, but I do paddle all over.  I totally agree that North shore offers more variety to choose from than the south shore. The south shore can be great fun (and better surfing!) but that'll come later.  Many of the harbors have a wide range of conditions to play in. Most will eventually open up to the Sound which most days will step up the skill level you want to have. The Sound can be glassy, but rarely is. It can easily get 5+ foot waves and difficult winds.  Long Island being Long Island...towns are frustrating and limit parking at most beaches to residents making launch points more limited to a degree. So again, knowing where you are (and were your town permit allows you to get to--or state park permit) will help answer your question :)  Let me know and I'll make a list."
Kayaking,3dwxib,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"Grew up there and paddled a lot, but it has been a decade since I was there. But, north shore is better than south shore in terms of good available protected access. Literally every harbor on the north shore has great protected access for paddlers. Huntington bay, Manasset bay. Connetquot. Really unlimited. You can even use google earth and look for roads that run along the beach. The only place I had a problem was port Jefferson, they wanted a 20$ ramp fee. But there is a road just to the north where I could walk my kayak across the beach and launch."
Kayaking,3dwxib,brttf3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"all good spots, Im assuming suffolk county since you're mentioning peconic/sag harbor. Good easy spots are Mt. Sinai Harbor, Port Jefferson (you can put in here or here, just park in the dirt lot after the yacht club for free from dawn to dusk (dirt lot gets locked after dusk)   other places are connequot river, carman's river (brookhaven residents can use the kayak rental place to launch from for free i think), stony brook harbor/west meadow creek, flanders bay. I'd watch the tides for the rivers/stony brook as timing is the best for those as you get better/more confident. Stony brook if you stay in the harbor area it will be like a lake at high tide.   I also use this launch site to find new places on the island."
Kayaking,3dtz6a,Eloth,3,Sun Jul 19 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"Nice!  There appears to be so much variety in WW boats. What drives all the differences? Type of rapids? speed of water? what you want to do when you hit the rough water (play vs cross or?)?  Might not be a simple answer, but so curious :)"
Kayaking,3dtz6a,Myatariisbusted,4,Sun Jul 19 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"So a boat like this is a freestyle kayak, designed primarily for surfing waves and throwing tricks in holes.   Most other common WW boats fall into a couple of categories; there's your creekboats, and your river-runners. Both of these are aimed at going down rivers; the differences between these two are the types of river. Creekboats are designed with steep, low-volume rivers in mind; they have rounded hulls for glancing off rocks and dissipating the force of landing a drop into water. River-runners have slightly less rounded hulls, with more of a defined edge, for driving through lines on pushy, high-volume water. We also have low-volume river-runners, like my Necky Jive, which are aimed at lower grade whitewater, have flatter hulls and sharper edges -- these are for playing the river, making tight eddies, difficult lines and doing everything with style. They're also awesome race boats on this kind of water and great for downriver freestyle -- rockspins, rocksplats...  There are also inbetweens between a few of these styles, as well as old-school varieties -- freestyle kayaks used to be about having as little volume as possible for cartwheels and vertical moves; now they've got high volume aimed at huge aerial moves.  There are also competition boats; WWR boats for racing class I-III in very straight lines; long boats for racing class IV/V in less straight lines; short race boats for the short boat category races from classes III to VI; Slalom boats for making gates and tight turns in the quickest time possible..."

Kayaking,3dtz6a,BadinBoarder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"The tiny playboats like this are made for doing flips and loops and tricks in holes and standing waves. The longer ones, like 6 and 8 ft, are more for creeking, just bombing a river, like the Liquid Logic Remix. Some are meant for speed, some for stability. Then there are old school boats, which are a mix of both. Like the Dagger RPM, which has the hard edges for playing and tricks and the length for speed and stability and creekability.   White water boats are somewhere along the spectrum from pure play boat to pure stability boat."

Far too many beginners to playboating -- and kayaking in general -- blame their failures on their boat, rather than their technique; the fact is that pretty much any playboat can do most moves easily with the right technique. Same story with rolling -- there's only one boat I've found difficult to roll and that's a wavehopper (without a fitting spraydeck).   Most cases, it's not the boat, it's you -- a boat's failings can be overcome by good technique. Well done on your bow stalling!"

I use three ratchet tie downs to be safe: one goes from the end of the bed (near tailgate) through the kayak carrying straps; one goes from the end of the bed (again, near the tailgate) over the top of the kayak and parallel to the tailgate; the third tie down I put diagonal across the truck bed so it holds down the kayak at the middle."

More important by far is instruction and safety cover (not to say you can go out there and do whitewater in a shitty rec bathtub, because you should never do that). You cannot just go out there and hit whitewater. At best, you won't learn proper technique and will probably end up injuring yourself or losing your boat. At worst, you'll die.  Whitewater is not to be fucked with.  So you want to get into whitewater, you join your local whitewater club. My club -- case may be different in your area -- provides instruction, takes you on trips, covers safety, and will rent you gear at a good price. At this stage, you don't necessarily know what gear would be best for your paddling -- nor what you want to get into (freestyle? creeking? river running? -- the possibilities are endless, and you'll want a different boat for each). Hit up your club. If they don't do gear rental, come back here and we can get you sorted with finding a boat, in all probability."
Kayaking,3dnf6m,Eloth,3,Fri Jul 17 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"This! Renting gear and paddling with a club is the best way to do it. Then when you know what you want you can even look for it used since you know what to look for. And half the time paddlers in the club will be looking to sell their gear anyway, so you might be able to pick up a bunch of stuff at the same time for super cheap."

Kayaking,3dnf6m,KayakHipster,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:13 2015 UTC,No problem. You'll see soon most paddlers are always thinking about their next boat or piece of gear... They make too much cool stuff out there for paddling.
Kayaking,3dnf6m,bobbyfiend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:38 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the advice, I found a semi-close club that I'm lookin into. If they don't do rwntals, I'll definitely take you up on help finding a boat. Thanks!"
Kayaking,3dnf6m,bobbyfiend,3,Fri Jul 17 23:36:35 2015 UTC,"Numero uno: get trained for WW. It's worth it. WW can quickly become scary/dangerous/deadly, even when it's only class II (and easily in class III).  Part of the problem with your suggestion is the rigidity of the boat. WW boats are usually designed with stronger hulls and/or they are reinforced. One of the more terrifying nightmares for WW is your boat wrapping itself around you due to the force of the current and pinning you underwater--say, under a partially-submerged tree trunk. WW boats can have this happen, too (water is really, really powerful when it gets moving), but they will generally resist this longer and better than a rec boat will.  Final suggestion: if you want to get some minimal instruction from a decent instructor then just run rivers (not play in the waves), get an old-school long (I think 10' plus) river-running WW boat. They weren't made to stop in the waves and do cartwheels; they did a better job of punching through the rapids and continuing downriver. Bonus: they can sometimes be found very cheaply.   If you get a more modern WW boat (especially a playboat), you might find yourself spending terrifying time in every wave and hole you come to, whether you like it or not; they are made for hanging around and (in the hands of a skilled kayaker) having fun in such places."
Kayaking,3dnf6m,Sir_not_sir,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:49 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the great advice. I looked up the closest club to my area and it's 1.5 hrs away. I plan to look into the classes provided and get involved. Thanks again

Kayaking,3dou1n,Kayakish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"So you're after whitewater?  First thing is, a class isn't enough. It's very rare for ANY paddler to solo a river, even the experienced ones. You need a group of people to paddle with, who have whitewater experience and relevant training. I typically paddle with a group of 4, maybe 5 people; we're all trained kayaking coaches, whitewater qualified, and certified whitewater safety and rescue technicians.  That said, whitewater kayaking is not an inaccessible sport. The best way to get into it is simply to find your local club and join it -- in the case of my club, they provide instruction, river trips, safety cover, and rent whitewater gear. Check here: https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Affiliate/view/  I don't really know exactly how the situation works in the US, but this should get you started."

It's a safety precaution for you, especially when adding a variable like your pup on the boat. PFDs are recommended for all times, and you never know when your pup might cause you to lose your balance. They seem small enough, but any little thing could cause a capsize. A pfd will just make it easier to get back in."

Line on the girl, then line on the dog?  What do you do from there?  Line up the rescuer too, and try to hand/toss the dog across first?  It's got to be dog first doesn't it?  The interesting part to me is that they even said yeah it's slippery, but they were more thinking about the raft than the woman/dog.  In fact he said we are going to need you to come across, clearly thinking he didn't want the raft to maybe hit her, but not considering the potential of her situation.

Kayaking,3dj00l,InfiniteHobbyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, a bit baffled why nobody grew her a rope. My guess would be that the parties involved didn't have the best swift water rescue training, or if they had the training, they hadn't practiced it much. As much as I'd like to avoid the reputation for armchair quarterbacking, this video is a pretty solid teachable moment with several ""what could have been done better?"" examples. I don't think the image showed whether the rescuer was strapped into anything himself, but that should have been the starting point.   All that being said, it did indeed look like a tough situation to work with, with some of the hazards being either hidden or far worse than they looked at a glance. Lots of opportunities for mistakes, and lots of consequences.   So let's all remember to take our ropes out this weekend and do a few practice throws! Especially if you're planning to be out on a release or festival with a lot of newbies. No better time than now to refresh and review some river safety."

Kayaking,3dj00l,lev00r,2,Fri Jul 17 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to describe spotting a sieve but basically you look for where the water isn't behaving the way that it should in a corner. If there were no sieve there, there would be a reaction wave or a tongue pushing water upward as it channeled through those rocks, forming a pillow around them.  The low surface of the water suggests that there's more flow underneath. It's not really easy to know the specific hazard that is under there, but good river reading can help you to at least determine where not to go.   One book that really helped me to get a little better at reading rivers is William Nealy's ""Kayak."" It has been around for decades and I paid all of $3 on Amazon for my copy."
Kayaking,3dj00l,NotRoryWilliams,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:16:35 2015 UTC,"You can see the water flowing very quickly around and under the raft -- this is where anything that gets caught up in that water is going to go. Same applies to rocks, logs, etc. If you have fast current going under something or through a crack that's too small for a person/boat, you have a sieve."
Kayaking,3dj00l,space_jam_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:57:08 2015 UTC,"I went white water rafting once as a ""fun group activity"". Never been in a raft before in my entire life and after a 15 minute education hopped right in. Our first class 5 we had to make one of two passages around these ridiculously huge boulders. Needless to say we didn't make it through at the exact right angle and our raft started to get pulverized by the sheer force... Just stranded there until finally clamoring up the biggest boulder until the guides could dislodge the raft. Standing on top of that boulder and watching the amount of water pass down and around that thing, hitting the bottom and swirling into a cavern the water had carved for itself was both gorgeous and shit inspiring. At that exact moment I realized I am NOT an extreme person and I was a fucking idiot for being out there.  I love to watch extreme stuff from the comfort of my couch, but it is not for me. This is exactly how quick things can go wrong."
Kayaking,3dj00l,SarCal,0,Fri Jul 17 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"I personally don't take much issue with the dog. I think one thing they could have done was slowed down and taken their time to get proper footing. There wasn't a need to rush since nobody was in any immediate danger. Looked like she just slipped and he did a good job of getting her air, and then back up quickly. Problem for her is that she fell into the worse side (downstream would have been better). Very lucky she was able to hold onto the line. Could have been really ugly of he had to go down digging for her and there wasn't enough room for her to swim though. Also, they could have had people downstream ready to go with throw ropes. Maybe some shoes with better traction and helmets.  Slow is steady, and steady is fast."
Kayaking,3dmg7b,Odditea,3,Fri Jul 17 13:39:22 2015 UTC,You might find a kayaking specific PFD more comfortable.  Most of them are low profile and allow for a lot more freedom of movement.  I have one and I am absolutely in love with it for canoeing and kayaking.  Here's what mine looks like.
Kayaking,3dmg7b,understep,2,Fri Jul 17 13:53:01 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of pfd's out there that will give you great arm mobility. Then there's some that will give you great back comfort.   I would recommend going to a kayaking store that carries the main brands and trying everything on. Grab a couple of them, go over to a floor model kayak and sit in it with the pfd. Adjust all the straps. Make sure you're comfortable.   That would help you pick one you'll actually wear out on the water.   Here's an example of one that has floatation in the back near your shoulders, so that the back is free of padding. It doesn't ride up.   http://www.nrs.com/product/21511/nrs-clearwater-mesh-back-pfd  Also, there's a lot of different good brands and prices. It can get expensive quick. So look for what you want and then you can also check online to see if you can get a good sale on it. Lots of kayak shops will run great sales over the holidays. You can also sign up for coupons from REI and take advantage of one of their sales.   The main big brands are kokatat, astral, stolquist, nrs, I can't think of any others right now.   I started with a crappy one from dicks, then moved on to a stolquist that I used for two years and loved, and now have an awesome kokatat.   there's always the used route. Many times paddlers will get new PFDs and after a year have not worn them much, and choose to get rid of them.   Hope that helps!"
Kayaking,3dmg7b,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"I have this one from Dicks Sporting Goods, which is a similar design  to yours and I have a similar issue on some longer trips. I always make sure to wear a comfy shirt underneath and loosen the top buckle some to take a little pressure off my neck (making sure the bottom straps are pretty tight keeps it from riding up too bad also). Truthfully, this style of PDF probably isn't designed for paddling (more like skiing, tubing, etc), but I find it does the job pretty well for the price. Most of the PFDs marketed for paddling have the buoyant material mostly around the mid section and then mesh over the shoulders to keep it from riding up and aggravating your neck/shoulders."
Kayaking,3dk6cv,guitarfury,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Normally kayakers dread this lake!! lol. I've paddled soooooo many miles on lake Tugalo, never fished it though. about 2 months ago we were setting shuttle at the lake parking lot and about 6 guys in 3 boats pulled up. They said they had caught over 300 fish over the past week of fishing, and that they do it every year.    As beautiful as this lake is, IMO the true beauty is well below the surface. Covered in   a century of silt and mud is the original course of the Chatooga, and its confluence with the Tallulah. Apparently the original Bull Sluice is down there, more than twice the size of the rapid that holds the name today. Someday section V of the Chatooga will run again. It ran for 250 million years before we put a wall up to temporally halt its journey. We the humans take out the dam or nature has to do it herself, that river will flow freely eventually."

Kayaking,3dgf31,the_wondersmith,2,Thu Jul 16 18:46:40 2015 UTC,Sorry I don't. So the entire center is touching all the way back (since the highest point of the kayak top is the top of the curve. So the plywood touches that all the way back). Then up front I have two 2x4 blocks that just rest on top of the kayak. It works with my kayak an is very stable.   The key is the cutout that fits up against the back of the opening. The two elastic cords pull the entire platform into that curve and keep it centered.

Kayaking,3dk8bv,Idontwashmyjeans,2,Thu Jul 16 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"So you want to get into whitewater?  The boat isn't necessarily the important part. More important by far is instruction and safety cover (not to say you can go out there and do whitewater in a shitty rec bathtub, because you should never do that). You cannot just go out there and hit whitewater. At best, you won't learn proper technique and will probably end up injuring yourself or losing your boat. At worst, you'll die.  Whitewater is not to be fucked with.  Join your local whitewater club. My club -- case may be different in your area -- provides instruction, takes you on trips, covers safety, and will rent you gear at a good price. At this stage, you don't necessarily know what gear would be best for your paddling -- nor what you want to get into (freestyle? creeking? river running? -- the possibilities are endless, and you'll want a different boat for each). Hit up your club. If they don't do gear rental, come back here and we can get you sorted with finding a boat, in all probability."

Kayaking,3diuk1,Bamapanadon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a fantastic gift, but it is also a gift that is difficult to get exactly right without spilling the surprise. Kayaks come in many shapes, colors, and sizes. On top of that, they are outfitted in many different ways to accommodate the exact purpose that users want to have them for.   I would suggest to get him a gift card to the sporting goods store near you, and put it in a card with a picture of a kayak. Tell him you just bought him a kayak, but he has to go pick it out. If you give him about 400, that should pretty much take care of most of the basic boats. 300 would give him a few options as well. Keep in mind, those prices do not include paddles and life vests, generally, so he may have to get that on his own anyway.   Best of luck to you and let us know if you have more details or more questions and we will try to help you out. Anyone willing to buy a guy a kayak must be a keeper."
Kayaking,3diuk1,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"You'll need to have the future owner involved in the buying process. Even if it's a surprise, surprise him by taking him to get it.   A good kayak will fit the person like a pair of jeans. Height, weight, type of water, all go into what kayak is best suited. Lastly, they need to sit in them (or on them) and test as much as possible so you can be sure you can spend hours out on the water."
Kayaking,3diuk1,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm still kind of a newb, but my first kayak was a dagger axis and I've decided that it's perfect for a beginner because of its versatility. It has a fair amount of storage and weight capacity for possible camping trips. It has a skeg which means that it can be switched between steady tracking or easy maneuvering on the fly. So you can easily explore different environments. It's well balanced and comfortable with a high quality seat, adjustable footrests, and pads for your knees. I agree with the other posts suggesting you should involve him in the process but check out the axis. I have the twelve foot and I would like another.  They start around $750 I think but you may be able to find a nice used one."

I transport two 12' Kayaks on my 14' Corolla with no problems.

Kayaking,3daglq,Capt_BrickBeard,2,Wed Jul 15 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"I own a 17' canoe and a 12 foot native. The native is going to give you a lot more options if you have a lot of small water around you and is going to be easier to paddle. I got mine for 500 on cl and other then the clip holding the right side of the seat in place was in good condition. You also don't need an expensive rack for the kayak. I put it on top of my roof racks like a canoe plus some foam blocks and it works perfect. I've got it pretty much outfitted now, just need to add the depth finder: http://imgur.com/9knnt58.  If you're going to be soloing alot and you get the canoe I'd highly recommend buying a depth finder and definitely buy a trolling motor. My first few summers at college I did the rock in front me paddling in back routine when I couldn't find anyone to fish and it was MUCH easier to get around with the motor, in a straight line at least. Keep in mind to think about where you are putting the weight in the boat as well, you're going to want the battery for the motor to counterbalance it on the other side of the canoe. I actually mounted mine on the side but you can buy or make mounting hardware to put it on the back.   For 200 you'll most likely be picking up a 15-17 aluminum, if you can I would hold out and find a grumman. I've taught around 25 or so people how to canoe in that boat, taken it to Isle Royale and back, put holes in it and had them welded shut, it's even been hit by a snow plow and still floats. My dad bought his in college and we still use it for canoe trips 30+ years later. Mine is two years newer then his and I've had it for almost ten years.  Edit: I also noticed you said you are a bigger guy. I am about 240-250 and regularly go out in my native 12 with my bulldog (40lbs) with no issues. I probably wouldn't take her out in anything really choppy but for floating rivers and small lakes I never have issues."

I'll tell you, i bought a used one a couple years ago and absolutely love it. The seat is amazing. I'm tall and needed a boat that would let me stretch and move and not be confined in. The seat-back and seat(seat?) are adjustable independent of each other so you can lean back or sit forward however you like. it breaths so you never feel like you're just sitting on heat. there is a TON of room and since the hull is open from end to end you'll never have a problem getting to something even if it's in the front and you're on the water.   i will tell you this...you don't need a $500 rack to put it on your car. i used two foam pool noodles with a bit of paracord through them tied to the top of my car and then put the boat on that. used some straps to hold it down and it was good to go. http://imgur.com/VG3EmmF  i'd say do what you can to get in one and try it out. if you can find one used even better."

Kayaking,3daglq,BiggC,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Canoe.  Definitely.  It gives you a lot more flexibility.  They're easier to repair, modify, and throw stuff in.  One big advantage of canoes for big guys (I'm 245 and had my wife and dog out in the boat this weekend), is that you can get a slim, efficient hull with enough displacement to carry you without a problem.  I'd advise against the Old Town.  Plastic boats are heavy and they have a good bit of flex to them, which decreases their paddling efficiency.    I'm a fan of fiberglass, but it's a dying material.  Royalex/Royalite's great.  Aluminum will last forever and take an enormous beating, but it's very loud and gets hot in direct sunlight.  My advice would be to pick up a used canoe off of craigslist to get your feet wet in the hobby."

Saying that, check this out:  http://jacksonkayak.com/blog/kayak/tripper-12/  It's a VERY nice compromise between the 2.  One of the liveries I frequent has a few of these boats, and we always try and get one when we're going out with a large group, as it can handle lots of gear, and I've seen folks with dogs in them as well.  Great boat if you're a larger person and want to bring along food/drinks/etc.  With the right kayak, packing drinks is no problem, even if there's minimal space.  Just pack them into a smaller soft-side cooler.  I have no problem bringing a case + food and a drybag of spare clothes along in a 12' with the rear compartment.  You just have to stop every so often and grab stuff out of the ""trunk"""

Kayaking,3daglq,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"I use my kayaks more than my canoe.    My canoe is a 16' long made of Royalex.  The positives of the canoe are the higher seating (I like to be able to see into the water around me) and the ability to have 2 more people in the boat with me.  The negatives are the weight of the canoe, and it's difficult to paddle alone.  Because I wanted to go out on my own more often, I ended up buying two inexpensive sit on top kayaks.  A small cooler straps just fine onto the back of the kayak and someone can come along for the trip.  The one downside is they are slow - but I like to enjoy the scenery more than run races, so that's okay with me."

Shorter canoes are much slower (because of hydrodynamics) and have less carrying capacity. (I personally prefer 18 footers for these reasons) and since hauling isn't an issue - no reason to get tiny boat - you're in Texas after all."

Kayaking,3d9w8i,littlebear1130,3,Tue Jul 14 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"The one reason I think a kayak leash might be nice is in sea/openwater kayaking: a leash attached to the boat (not to you) and very short (just a few inches, or even only a couple of inches) can be handy to hold your paddle for a minute or two while you arrange your cockpit or maybe set up a rescue.  But as I recall an instructor saying one of the first times I went on a WW trip: ""dangly things in the water: Very Bad."" So I fully agree that the standard kayak leash is a bad combination of risky and useless."
Kayaking,3d9w8i,bobbyfiend,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"I use a bungee for touring. I wouldn't consider it in whitewater, for safety, and it's kinda funny since my whitewater paddle cost twice what my touring paddle cost.

Kayaking,3d9w8i,NotRoryWilliams,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:11:25 2015 UTC,"It certainly makes more sense for touring. I'm not a hardcore kayaker, but I don't feel there's much danger of losing my paddle on flatwater (even when it gets seriously choppy and not so flat). I suppose I tell myself that, since I have a spare paddle, if I drop the one in my hands, I can use the spare and go get the one I dropped. This might be nearly impossible in WW, of course.  Edit: can't type."

Kayaking,3d9w8i,turtlessf128,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:25 2015 UTC,Yeah -- a paddle leash is nothing more than an entrapment hazard in any water where losing your paddles is even a remote possibility. No point bringing one.
Kayaking,3d9w8i,Eloth,2,Tue Jul 14 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"Depending on the style, yes and no.  I use it when I am fishing offshore from my fishing ski, but don't use it on the sit in sea kayak. When fishing, the reason being that I may put the paddle down hastily if I get a good hit whilst trolling. It can easily roll off and suddenly I'd be 4-8 km offshore with no paddle. Can't always rely on the fish to tow us home."
Kayaking,3d9w8i,l4pse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:34:37 2015 UTC,"Funny story...I always use a leash while surfing, and since I have it, I was using it on flat water, too.  But in the XP9 I got last year it rubs against the outfitting as I paddle and I stopped using the leash in those conditions.    Well just a couple weeks ago there was a pretty good, steady breeze...I sat my paddle down across the gunnels to get a drink, and the wind blew my paddle clear off the boat and into the water!  The one time that leash would have been useful..."

Kayaking,3d9w8i,nittanyvalley,4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna somewhat disagree with you on drip rings. But only in very specific times. For sea kayak touring, especially in the winter, drip rings can help keep you a tiny bit drier/warmer. Rest of the time they do nothing. But at some specific times I'm glad I've had them on."
Kayaking,3d9w8i,KayakHipster,4,Tue Jul 14 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"Drip rings have kept my hands drier, which helped reduce blisters. Other than this, completely agree"
Kayaking,3d9w8i,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but usually when I paddle I have my hands in the water on every other stroke, so they're almost always wet the entire time I'm out.

Kayaking,3dbpsl,somevelvetmorning,3,Wed Jul 15 01:00:04 2015 UTC,The Pungo is a great boat. I've owned a 120 and 140. The seats are comfortable. The chines offer nice stability. It's light and durable.  Is there a place nearby that you can test paddle any of these? It's always a good idea to try before you buy.
Kayaking,3dbpsl,sabr0sa,2,Wed Jul 15 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"I went with Dagger Zydeco 11 and Perception Prodigy 10, but it looks like you've got a larger budget to play with. Of the four, I'd try either the Dirigo or the Rip 10. I was very impressed with the Old Town Vapor 10xt, so the Dirigo would be outstanding. I also like the Rip 10 for it's features. Are you fixed on the larger cockpit models?"
Kayaking,3dbpsl,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:56:30 2015 UTC,Not necessarily - what other options would you recommend if that's not a requirement?
Kayaking,3dbpsl,sabr0sa,2,Wed Jul 15 12:41:53 2015 UTC,Replying to myself because I can edit on mobile apparently...  The Pungo also has an available dashboard that gives you storage and cup holder ability.  You may want to consider something slightly longer. A 12' kayak will track a lot better than a 10'er. This will allow you to make less corrective strokes and make for a more enjoyable paddle. You'll also get more glide.
Kayaking,3dbpsl,sabr0sa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:21:45 2015 UTC,Would you recommend a Pungo 120 or Dirigo 120?  I'm concerned w/the added weight of the 120s.
Kayaking,3dbpsl,vagrantsoul,2,Wed Jul 15 12:56:30 2015 UTC,"I've never paddled a Dirigo 120, but the design seems very similar to the Pungo. I've owned many Wilderness Systems kayaks and always had great experiences with them so I'd probably lean that way. Old Town makes quality stuff too though. I guess it'd boils down to price.  I never had a problem lifting my Pungo 120. It's listed at 49 pounds. The Pungo 100 is listed at 47 pounds. That's negligible considering the trade off in glide and tracking.  The 100 is slightly wider which will give you a bit more stability. The stability is great for the first few times out, then you'll be wishing the boat paddled faster/straighter/easier."
Kayaking,3dbpsl,knobbysideup,2,Wed Jul 15 13:15:29 2015 UTC,"just got done testing the dirigo 120, camden 120, and the pungo 120... going with the camden actually...   i prefer the stance in the water with my frame for the camden, the material is a three layer (plastic,foam,plastic) which will seem to take abuse better, holds form better on stress and heat... not to mention the pungos lack a drain plug. they (the pungo and camden) were close in the way of tracking and turning, the camden just seemed to feel a little better on me... also went with the 12' after having a 10'... want the extra space, length (speed, tracking).   tl/dr - test them out, suggest looking at the camden in lieu of the dirigo, was stuck between these after hating my pelican boat."
Kayaking,3dbpsl,Thatguy7242,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:12 2015 UTC,This is exactly the kind of response I was looking for.  Checking out the Camden too.  There's a place nearby that lets you test all of these out.  I'll visit them this weekend.
Kayaking,3dbef7,colavs23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:40 2015 UTC,I think the place that makes the most sense is centerline in front of the cockpit. The boats with holders behind the cockpit seem more like trawlers.
Kayaking,3dbef7,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:05:49 2015 UTC,"Rod holders mounted behind you are best for actually paddling around, as the rods are then out of your way. One or two somewhere in front of you are beneficial for the actual fishing setup. Flushmount holders, (like Scotty brand ones) would likely work best, but do require you to drill holes into your kayak.   Any more questions, maybe bring them over to r/kayakfishing. We're a nice helpful bunch"
Kayaking,3dbef7,jimmythespider,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"I attached a Scotty rod holder to the front of the sit in model.

Kayaking,3d9qxu,oceanic_815,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:21 2015 UTC,How much do you want to spend? I went with a Dagger Zydeco 11 for $570. The Perception Prodigy 10 is very similar with a larger cockpit for $525. Both should be fine for your needs.
Kayaking,3d9qxu,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"That price is probably towards the high end of what I would spend, but I will spend what I need to get something that I like.   I think the length as well as the cockpit size and overall shape of the Perception kayak is better for me as I am more used to kayaking in a bigger cockpit. The seat also looks very comfortable which matters to me because of slight scoliosis and a tendency for my back to hurt during kayaking.  Any recommendations for a cheap securing system for a car roof? Could I get away with the cheap block and straps?"
Kayaking,3d9qxu,Sir_not_sir,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:50 2015 UTC,block and straps are okay for one kayak.  You should also look at Old Town kayaks. I would have gotten a Vapor 10 XT if they weren't sold out. Cabela's had 15% off in store.

I have had a friend almost lose his boat to not declaring it when importing it - and it was the second or third time it entered Canada. The guard looked at the boats, asked him what country his boat was made in, and if he paid duty when importing it. He hadn't. That cost him his Nexus card, so I'd make sure you're on the up and up with all this - but if you are a Nexus cardholder, you should already know that."

Once you get off the dock/beach, they kinda go away - they can't fly that far and you should be able to paddle out of their range easily.

The second time I went kayaking a bee landed on my leg and spent a couple minutes climbing all over my pants before flying off.  So far that's been the biggest insect problem I've had.
Kayaking,3d6wi4,heatherbalch,2,Tue Jul 14 00:10:40 2015 UTC,I would advise out of the water. I can't give any scientific reasons but my gut says so.
Kayaking,3d6wi4,soulslawter,2,Tue Jul 14 00:17:25 2015 UTC,Store it outside of the water ideally on its side. On a rack is perfect and make sure to keep it out of the sun. Keep in mind to watch for animals building homes in it when it's left outside
Kayaking,3d6wi4,batmanorsuperman,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:29 2015 UTC,Thank you! The boat rack is in the shade so I'll stick with that option - my gut made me think that would be best but I wanted to be sure.  Too many friends opted for the in-water option and I wasn't sure if I was making a mistake. :)

Kayaking,3d4q41,danhimself36,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Great! Thank you! I was thinking about doing that rigging for the holder, but the paddle fits oddly in that little lip before it goes down the side, I think that the bungee rigging is the way I'm going to go, makes it a bit more flexible as to where I can put it, so it wont smack my knuckles while paddling.    I already use the deck to strap down the PFD, but I actually just picked up this pretty bangerang Fanny Pack that I'm going to cut up and carabineer to some holes I'm going to drill in the lip.

Kayaking,3d2k07,phuchmileif,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"I just use them so I don't blow air out of my nose when rolling. If I fail, then I'm out of air. I can get 3-5 attempts in if it results to that. Sometimes on the river, your first one is instinctive just to get air, so you bring your head out first. Obviously, that's the last thing that needs to come up, so with your nose plugs in, you can give 'er another shot.   I always put them in when I'm hitting a class 3/4 rapid. Get Cottonmouth nose plugs from NRS.com. They're amazing."

Kayaking,3d3cz5,Tomagone,0,Mon Jul 13 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"Full faces can scare the shit out of newer/inexperience paddlers and wreck their confidence. They'll be wondering why you're wearing one and they're not, should they be wearing one, is it that dangerous e.c.t. Once they've lost their confidence they'll paddle worse and have less fun.  I also find it's harder to communicate and have been told they're harder to remove if the paddler has a suspected spinal injury (not sure how accurate that is though, luckily I've never been in that position!)  Sometime the benefits will out way the draw backs but on the whole I wouldn't say they're an essential piece of kit, more of a personal choice, and personally I think a helmet with a decent (but breakable) peak suffices."
Kayaking,3d3cz5,nittanyvalley,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"It's difficult, and probably dangerous, to make that sweeping generalization about people and helmets.

Personally, I don't really care what other people wear, but I know that I feel a lot more confident and comfortable when I'm wearing my full face.

Keep in mind that if you bump one and get spun sideways, you're most likely going to tip or fill up with water if you don't have a skirt on. That can lead to a bit of a bad time.

I've actually had an issue with leaving a kayak on crossbars but it was a super beat up boat where the plastic was was already giving up the ghost. I think the big thing is like /u/Kayak4eva said was loosen up the straps. With mine I left it tied tight and out in the sun for the day, and wound up with two long divots from where the crossbars heated up and left an impression in the deck."
Kayaking,3d13zt,kryptorofthecloset,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"Just make sure that your lines and straps aren't pulling on the boat while it's being heated by the sun: loosen them when the vehicle is stopped for long periods of time (several hours).  I've been hauling plastic boats for years on the roof rack without any serious deformations.    I might be a bit more concerned if I were using J cradles as any deformation that did take place might warp the boat in a ""crooked"" fashion, since the boat is on it's side.  I don't know if that's really a problem though - I've never used J cradles."

It's my first kayak, so unfortunately I have nothing to compare it to, but it has been perfectly fine for me on flatwater. I haven't gone huge distances in it, as I'm simply not fit enough yet, but I do intend to try it out in the sea this year.  I'm trying to upload some pics, but my internet connection is screwed at the moment.  EDIT: http://imgur.com/a/gfmVt  2nd EDIT: I live in a small flat, but one thing you do have to do is re-inflate it when you get home so you can let it dry out, so make sure you have a space to do that in."

Kayaking,3cyihm,Tim_The_Enchanter,4,Sat Jul 11 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"Seguin Island Lighthouse. Has a little cove you can beach your boat and go tour the lighthouse. Out, circle the island and back came out to about 8 miles.   We bought a pair of used Wilderness Tsunami 145's from a rental outfit in Rockport Mass after going on a tour with them last weekend. We are a bit nomadic and are planning on spending the next 6 weeks on the coast of Maine. Seemed like a good as time as any to get kayaks so we pulled the trigger. The 145 might be a little big for how we will normally be using them, but for today they were perfect."
Kayaking,3cyihm,Dbigg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at the tsunami line but havent been able to look at one in person yet.  Since you've done a little touring in them, do you think they would be able to handle enough gear for a multi-week trip, or are they not quite big enough?"
Kayaking,3cyihm,KayakHipster,6,Sat Jul 11 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"If you want to camp out of your boat, I'd recommend going for one of the longer ones. More cargo space. While the tsunami 140 and 145 are great boats, I wouldn't consider them to be true touring boats. They're extremely stable and spacious, but they're  right at the cut-off for ocean worthy length wise. Most people that will do multi day or week trips will usually go with boats in the 17-18' range due to more capacity as well as better able to deal with rougher conditions. If you want to stay with wilderness systems, you can find the longer tsunamis or their brother, the tempest (superb boat).   One last thing to mention on the tsunamis - and OP, please take this into account when you guys spend time on the water - they are high volume boats that are affected by wind. Please take that into consideration. If the wind is blowing or might gust high, don't go out or seek shelter. Other boats with lower profiles have an easier time out on the water with high wind. The tsunamis, while absolutely great handling boats and very stable, can have trouble maneuvering in wind. So just be careful with that."
Kayaking,3cyihm,KayakHipster,3,Sun Jul 12 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. We will keep it in mind for sure.   I was a little hesitant when my wife suggested todays paddle, but the tides, the wind and the weather all lined up perfectly. It was easy."
Kayaking,3cyihm,Dbigg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Like I said, they're great boats. But open waters and the weather can be extremely unforgiving and change in minutes, so as you grow into your tsunamis, learn about on their limitations and grow with them in mind. No one boat out there does everything perfectly."
Kayaking,3cyihm,KayakHipster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:50:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. This is exactly what I wanted to know. I had primarily been looking at the biggest tsunami, the 175, and I think I'll keep focusing on that."
Kayaking,3cyihm,doplebanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that the lengths also have a high and low volume version. I'm not sure if that's the case for the 175, but for the 140 vs 145 and 160 vs 165, you have a length and then high and low volume to fit different sizes of paddlers. 145 for larger paddlers, 140 for smaller. Same with 165 and 160. So def try both sizes in whatever length so that the boat fits you well. Sit in it for sure and try to get it out on the water before making the decision. Most shops will let you demo the boat before having to buy it."
Kayaking,3cyihm,KayakHipster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"The 140 and 145 have different length and volume, there are not different versions of the Tsunami that have different volumes, but the same length. This is the case with all WS boats. The longer, the higher the volume. They don't have multiple models in the same length. Unless you are comparing across the Tempest, Tsunami, Focus, and Zephyr lines."
Kayaking,3cyihm,doplebanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but doesn't the 140 and 145 refer to 14' and 14'6"" respectively? What I meant is, they are both in the 14' range and can accommodate smaller and bigger paddlers. Same with the zephyr 155 and 160. 15. Something feet for 155 and 16' for 160, and therefore accommodate different sized people. I meant it as a generalization."
Kayaking,3cyihm,Noonproductions,2,Sun Jul 12 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't much to compare to but I imagine it would be a good choice. I'm 6'4"" and about 220 and the boat is really stable with me in it. I have yet to feel like i might tip or have much more than a little splash over the deck. (And I'm not good with balance).   The place we got them from gave us a 140 by mistake. Comparing the 140 and 145 side by side you could really see the 145 has a higher deck around the cockpit. We went back and exchanged it for a 145. Much more comfortable for us."
Kayaking,3cyihm,kickstand,2,Sun Jul 12 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"The 145 is on the shorter end for touring boats, but especially with a rudder, it should be fine for light touring, even in wind or currents. Most touring kayaks are 16' or longer, but have rocker in the bow and stern, giving them a shorter waterline, closer to 15' give or take. The Tsunami however has little rocker and molded ""keel"" shaped stern that will help a lot with tracking.  As far as volume (storage space) goes, the Tsunami is the Harley Fatboy of kayaks. Plenty of room."

Kayaking,3d0nxu,RickyfB,5,Sun Jul 12 15:01:09 2015 UTC,It is worth it to get a more expensive jacket that flexes and moves with your body. It will not get in your way like you've got packing foam loosely strapped to your body. Try a few on in Dick's and go through your casting motion. If you have a comfortable one you will never even think twice about wearing it.
Kayaking,3d0nxu,wargh_gmr,2,Sun Jul 12 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'll second that. Those little orange things are shit. Get something somewhat decent, you can nab a basic one for around 30 to 40 bucks that has pockets and doesn't get in your way. The point of a PFD is that you will wear it, and I won't wear those."
Kayaking,3czluv,My_Empty_Wallet,3,Sun Jul 12 05:39:53 2015 UTC,Sweet! Brings back memories. I went two years ago and we went so much farther into the city. Wonder why they changed the tour. You had calmer waters at least. I've kayaked three oceans and Lakes Superior and Michigan. The tour down the Chicago River was the roughest water I had ever been on!
Kayaking,3czluv,Kick79,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:29:40 2015 UTC,I've been on this tour twice and the water has been calm both times. Once you hit the east spur the water gets colder and cleaner which is nice.  The tour barges are a bit obnoxious though

Kayaking,3cy9dw,Sir_not_sir,3,Sat Jul 11 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"I can't comment a lot on the Camden, but I do have a Pungo 120. For flat water or light chop it does really well. It tracks very straight even with beginner level paddle technique. I got a used one and the seat is a bit worn out, but it's pretty comfy and the backrest is adjustable to help with that. It has a console that's relatively water-tight, though I wouldn't put my phone unprotected in that.  Likewise, the console is just bungee strapped on, so if you flip it, there's a solid chance it'll pop off, especially in a river. The thigh pads are nice and the foot braces are very easy to adjust on the fly. I like it. My wife and sister love it. The cockpit is large enough that I don't see your size being an issue. We often take the console off and sit my 4 year old in front of us to paddle about on the local lakes.  It doesn't turn easily at all. For local rivers with bends, it's fine but if you have sharp turns to get around obstacles, you have to plan ahead and realize it's not going to happen quickly. For this reason, it's not very good to take down any shallow rivers where you might have to navigate even small class I rapids (unless you're sure to find a straight line down). If you capsize it, the thing is a beast to get the water out of. There is no drain plug.  The rear compartment is very easy to get in and out of and seems to stay watertight.  I'd recommend it. Easy to paddle, fast, and roomy make it a great boat for lakes and flatwater rivers. Whether it's better than the other, I can't say since I've not used the other."
Kayaking,3cy9dw,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"The maverick is no fun either, the rush of water popped the one buoyancy block out when someone grabbed and flipped it a few weeks ago. Even having the plug didn't help much"

I really like the console on the front of the Pungo, I wish I could buy something like that for the Camden.

Kayaking,3cyf1e,nittanyvalley,5,Sat Jul 11 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"Class. As others said, not intuitive and you could hurt yourself doing it without meaning to.   Also, rolling is all muscle memory. Your body wants to do the opposite of what rolling is. Your brain wants your head out of the water getting air, and a good roll leaves your head in the water until the last moment. So you don't want to learn something incorrectly. It's better to have someone with you teaching you the right thing first, then practicing it a hundred times until it works well."
Kayaking,3cyf1e,KayakHipster,2,Sun Jul 12 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"You might try looking up kayaking groups on meetup.com as well. There's a small kayaking community where I'm at, but they meet now and again for roll sessions at lakes and in the off-season, at the local YMCA pool to practice."
Kayaking,3cyf1e,antisocialoctopus,2,Sun Jul 12 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others. Meet up with others to learn or sign up for a class. 75 bucks is well worth learning to roll for the rest of your life. It is a strange thing to learn. Also, there was something else but I forgot it....gentleman jack whiskey is deliciois by the way. Oh, you have to commit to what you're doing. You cannot half ass a roll. The best first step is to get comfortable under the boat. That will allow you to get set up properly."
Kayaking,3cyf1e,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"Take a class, but before you do start doing some yoga and stretches. That and some low bracing and sculling for support practice. Get someone to show you the proper technique too. Practice makes permanent so you want to practice properly. You could watch videos on rolling but I say don't, you might just wind up with too much info in your brain and you can't sort all of it out when you're upside down and under water. A good instructor will be able to see what your biggest problem is and work on that."

I've been using a snorkel mask when practicing to make being upside down underwater a little easier for now, but you are correct it gets confusing. Tried many things, I know I focus on the paddle too much as some of my rolls without a paddle seem closer then my rolls with a paddle, but I've still never managed to roll back upright yet.

Kayaking,3cxl88,TheFlyingDavenport,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:59:33 2015 UTC,I would check out Thule and/or Yakima and run through their 'fit my vehicle' pages to determine what you need. You are more than likely going to get one that clamps on the door jams.   From there I would check craigslist for the towers/cross bars you need because they will be a lot cheaper. You will probably have to buy the fit kit new (basically the adapter for your specific car) because that is harder to find used.   I would also check out forums for your car as there are probably suggestions and things to avoid.

If the discussion was to be seen by everyone so that experienced paddlers' views can be shared for all to learn, I'd say this is not needed. But I am concerned about posts where this might not be the case."

Flagging the post as dangerous and the community giving more positive and helpful insight instead of ""you're stupid!"" type comments might help with that. Of course, sometimes the most important thing we could agree on is ""You have no business doing that."" and it might not be taken well. That can't be helped."
Kayaking,3cwf5g,E11i0t,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point, and one we've aimed to address; as stated previously, the proposal as it stands involves replacing any removed post with a new thread specifically targeted at safety in that area."
Kayaking,3cwf5g,E11i0t,5,Sat Jul 11 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"That is a a really silly proposal. Removing user content to replace it with ""mod-approved"" content is harmful to the community. Sharing knowledge of safe behavior is great, but there's no need to use censorship to force a solitary position on what constitutes safe behavior."
Kayaking,3cwf5g,Kayak4Eva,0,Sat Jul 11 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"If we didn't feel there was a need to do it, we would not have made this proposal.   Obviously we don't want to stray into outright censorship, and it's important that we preserve discussion on the subject. That's why it would be a safety discussion, rather than a simple PSA.  As stated, our only problem is when a bad example is presented to newcomers to the sport as an acceptable thing to do. I -- speaking as an individual -- do not feel that the community would be greatly harmed by losing these posts. Since I became a moderator, there have been only two posts that I would have deleted, both made very recently. In the case of these posts, there was no discourse when it came to safety; it was a clear-cut black and white issue. I think it causes more harm to the community to have a post sitting on our front page -- implying we condone it -- demonstrating something no sensible paddler should ever attempt than it ever would simply to remove the post."

A front-page post doesn't mean the community condones or encourages the behavior, it simply means the content is of interest and upvoted accordingly."
Kayaking,3cwf5g,E11i0t,9,Sat Jul 11 19:48:53 2015 UTC,I feel like any time a dangerous video is posted OP gets ripped a new one. Do we need to protect people that can't bother to read comments over educating an OP that may be running borderline WW in a cheap rec boat? I don't know if I agree or not. I will say that over at /r/whitewater there is a good bit of unsafe and poor rescue content that has provided more insight than the perfect rescue video because responses often breakdown the right way to handle the situation and why.
Kayaking,3cwf5g,doplebanger,0,Sat Jul 11 11:14:06 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it's important to remember the differences between the userbase of /r/whitewater and our own. We tend to get greater numbers of inexperienced paddlers, and people who haven't even tried the sport -- it's vital to give users the right impression when it comes to safety. By way of contrast, most of /r/whitewater's audience are already experienced in a whitewater environment -- this is in vast contrast to the users in /r/kayaking, most of whom lack the knowledge of whitewater safety fundamentals to judge whether or not a situation is potentially life-threatening.   unsafe and poor rescue content that has provided more insight than the perfect rescue video because responses often breakdown the right way to handle the situation and why.   Of course, this is something we aim to preserve! There's no point if we don't learn from our experiences; this is why the proposal includes replacing any deleted thread with a relevant safety topic."

Kayaking,3cwf5g,OldButStillFat,2,Sat Jul 11 16:50:39 2015 UTC,It's definitely something we could consider.  The problem with this and similar solutions is that they will serve to draw attention - more than anything else - to the offending post. It'd also need to be carefully phrased such as not to give validation to the activity or the poster; we don't want to be awarding a 'certified badass' sticker.

Kayaking,3cwf5g,rushbcom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"However, not all of our users read the comments and we've often had posts sit on the front page of the subreddit even as they demonstrate dangerous -- even life-threatening -- behaviour. Even worse, posts of the like have been made, seen by a large number of users, and then deleted with the first dissenting comment -- meaning that many of those original viewers may never realise that the activity depicted was severely dangerous. Our current proposal is that we remove any post that presents a serious breach of safety that could easily result in the death of an individual who follows its example -- and possibly replace it with a thread about safety."

Kayaking,3cta3p,wyshy,6,Sat Jul 11 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"In the context of boating on a river, a strainer is something that's not moving but the water is rushing through it, like a tree or pile of logs.  It's very easy for a person in a boat to get caught in one, especially when there's a flood, and once you're stuck in one the water pressure usually forces you under while the object holds you there and you drown."
Kayaking,3cta3p,Thjoth,3,Sat Jul 11 06:44:14 2015 UTC,Trees and such on the side of the river that hang onto the water creating a strainer like seive where water goes through but people and gear don't. Bad news.

Kayaking,3cta3p,meohmy13,3,Fri Jul 10 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, serious paddlers don't use them generally...

Kayaking,3cta3p,Eloth,4,Fri Jul 10 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Most sea kayak paddles come with them. For touring they can be very helpful, they'll keep your skirt dry. Especially in the winter.

Honestly they don't keep anything ""dry"" since the water still drips off of off them but they do help with water running off the paddle, down your arm and onto your head and lap which can be annoying in a flat water situation.  It's like water torture.  I don't mind getting soaked by waves, splashing, capsizing or whatever else but for some reason that dribble of water coming down off my arm at the catch is different somehow."
Kayaking,3cta3p,meohmy13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:02:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough :)   I can understand that reasoning. I have kept my drip rings on my euro paddle. I don't see any reason to remove them.

All classes take place on the shallow end, so instructors can stand comfortably next to the students.

Kayaking,3cu5do,phuchmileif,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:24:49 2015 UTC,"I've tried taking my ~40lb corgi mix on a cheap sit-on and I find it to be like riding a buoy while I swing a bowling ball on a rope over my head. Maybe it would work better with a more sophisticated 'yak that keep the center of gravity lower...but if you can't get the dog to sit still, you are just going to have some issues.  What seems optimal to me is a sit-in with a huge cockpit. Like an Old Town Vapor, maybe. Gives the dog some space, but keeps him low."
Kayaking,3crgp7,Splorinstuff,10,Fri Jul 10 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"I would say you DON'T want a Kayak. To say that kayaks are more stable (as u/p90sg22 suggests) is a gross generalization. But it is not a gross generalization to say that canoes have MUCH more space and cargo capacity. I regularly paddle 16-18ft canoes with a partner and two dogs, and there is still room for a week's worth of gear and rations (a 16-18 footer will also be much faster than a 14.5 footer). Also, Canoes are easier to pack and unpack, and are generally much cheaper than kayaks. BUT if you don't know how to paddle a canoe - you're going to be very frustrated. If you don't know how to do a J-stroke, a draw stroke, and what ""trim"" is  - and why it's important - then you need to take a class."
Kayaking,3crgp7,theblackdane,5,Fri Jul 10 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"You want a canoe, especially for carrying both the girlfriend and the dog on the same trip. You probably like the idea of putting your camping stuff in a kayak's waterproof compartment, but lots of people buy waterproof bags for their stuff even for kayak transport. You're losing nothing if you go with a canoe and gaining space and stability."

Kayaking,3crgp7,kayakerjosh,4,Fri Jul 10 12:24:00 2015 UTC,you want a canoe
Kayaking,3crgp7,nittanyvalley,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"Wow talk about a response thanks yall. It sounds like Im heading for a canoe. Just so everyone knows, none of the lakes or rivers I paddle will be high waves. Arizona is small lakes and rivers and we hope to paddle the lower colorado south of the hoover dam. Its going to be primarily small water.  So here's my next question. Arizona at least has a lot of shallow water with rough rocks. I had been looking at the more affordabe outfitter canoes because despite being heavy the hold up pretty well. Whats the toughest material out there for these things?"
Kayaking,3crgp7,nittanyvalley,3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"For abrasion resistance and toughness, you want a hull made of polyethylene or Royalex. Royalex is no longer being made new, so you'd probably have to find one of those boats used (good luck, they are in high demand)."
Kayaking,3crgp7,antisocialoctopus,2,Fri Jul 10 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"Gonna pop in and say you might want to check out the Native Watercraft Ultimate 14.5 tandem. /u/p90sg22 suggested it but got downvoted out due to his statement that kayaks are more stable. It's a good hybrid of canoe and kayak that does offer a good bit of stability. A good friend of mine owns one and has enough room for both his kids and a day's worth of supplies for cooking out (food, camp stove, water, cookware, etc) without being cramped."

Kayaking,3crgp7,thenatureboy_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on where you plan to paddle.  If you will be on big lakes with lots of wind and big waves, you want a kayak.  Kayaks can handle rougher water than canoes.  But in my opinion, being out in the middle of big lakes is pretty boring.  When I'm picking canoe routes up here in Canada, I prefer the routes with smaller lakes, even though it can mean more portages.  And on smaller lakes kayaks have no advantages.  If you won't be facing strong winds and/or rough water, a canoe is easier, cheaper, more comfortable, and can carry more stuff."

Kayaking,3crgp7,Eloth,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:26:19 2015 UTC,Kayaks are more stable. Check out the Native Ultimate 14.5 tandem. I want one really bad. It's perfect I think. A tandem that incorporates the pluses of a kayak and a canoe.

Kayaking,3cq2o3,phuchmileif,3,Thu Jul 9 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"congratulations! one piece of advice that i'd give would be to make sure that you have a strap or secondary safety rope going through a grab loop on the boat.  This way there is no possibility for the kayak to slide off of the car.  Right now, it appears that your boat could possibly come free and fly onto the road.  It's much easier to have happen then you would think!  Enjoy!"
Kayaking,3cq2o3,Morangutan_,2,Fri Jul 10 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"double this, with the foam type blocks you are using.  they can compress or thh boat can move more due to this.     i stopped using these when i noticed how much the yak was denting in (look at the back of your yak, as pictured), the kayak is 'bent in' due to the narrow footprint of the foam block."
Kayaking,3cq2o3,JohnRav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"I had carried my XP10 flawlessly like this...until I noticed that I had dented the hull on it, too. So I changed to stackers. However, I didn't want to store just this one boat like that while transporting it, so I revertered...it was a bad choice. The wind really wanted to blow it sideways on my short rack. I had a bow strap on for the interstate, and this only made it worse (have to tie in to an off-center tow hook). I'm learning: best to carry two sideways, both strapped down and strapped together (...I had two try to separate on me...)"

Kayaking,3cnwja,xplosivo,3,Thu Jul 9 11:00:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to spend $400 (or have $400 to spend) on j-hooks for my rack so I got some cheapos from amazon. They work just fine, though you can't fold them down when not in use, of course. There were a lot of reviews saying how hard they were to put together, but I didn't find them difficult at all."
Kayaking,3cnwja,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:37:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking about doing that too actually. The horizontal carriers seem like they would hold a lot better.. so I'll probably do that in the long run if I start going solo enough to justify it.
Kayaking,3cnwja,Storm_Johnson,2,Thu Jul 9 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"as someone else mentioned, you could get 2 sets of J hooks for the roof.   If they are sit on top yaks, you could stack them.

I think it's more versatile and more useful in the long run.   Don't get me wrong- tandem kayaks have their uses- but at the low end I think there's better comfort and utility for about the same price when you get a canoe.

Kayaking,3cn46j,PaddleYakker,2,Fri Jul 10 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, In the north I would use a sit inside , keep you more dry.  In the south , in warm waters I would get a Sit On Top. To me they are easier to get in and out of, and allow you to play in the water. Lots of kinds have rod holders for your fishing poles or you could build one with a milk crate and attach some rocket launchers to.    As for shade you can always make shift a bimini , this is a crude prototype, but it got better.  You want to make sure you arent making a sail."
Kayaking,3cn46j,PaddleYakker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:50:31 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks. I'll definitely look into a bimini. I guess an umbrella could pick up some wind. I live in the south so perhaps SOT might be best for me, however (correct me if I'm wrong) I have this slight feeling that in an SOT you will end up getting wet just about every trip.. is that true? Would there be any disadvantage to SOT other than getting cold in certain conditions?   There's a guy looking to sell his SOT on craigslist near me so he can get a sit in. Made me think twice about going SOT."
Kayaking,3cn46j,PaddleYakker,2,Thu Jul 9 06:29:52 2015 UTC,"That Kayak might be fun but you would making 2 times the strokes to get anywhere.  Look for something with some kind of keel for tracking.   Once you figure out how to get inside your kayak you can keep it pretty dry, I carry a huge car washing sponge to soak up any water and ring it out.    Sit inside really isnt that bad, lots of people prefer them, its just my own style that I prefer sit on top.  Here in the south, I like getting wet, but I dont really like sitting in water while I paddle."
Kayaking,3cn46j,SteadyDietOfNothing,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:43:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. Do keels add cost? Would I be able to find them on a new/used decent kayak in my price range? ($300-500) Do SOTs usually have scuppers or built in ways to drain water? What brand(s) do you like?
Kayaking,3cn46j,PaddleYakker,2,Thu Jul 9 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"Keels are part of a kayak, some or totally flat bottom some have a small keel, some have drop down keels.  If you are going for long distance drop down keels are good, if you are just going to put around a river or lake the built in Keels work just find.    SOT have scuppers that let water out, you can buy scupper plugs that go in so water doesnt come in.  I got most of my Yaks off CL, you can find great deals as people upgrade their yaks.  I would go this route until you know for sure you truly enjoy it.     I started with a Pelican sit inside, moved to an Ocean Frenzy sit on top, but then realized my dog needed her own space so she didnt fall out all the time and researched until I found this one  which we both love.   Its kind of a hybrid, its a SOT but you are sitting in in, kind of like a canoe, its comfy, tracks nice and has plenty of room.  The Kayak you see in my comment I got at Academy Sports for under $500 .   What I do is, I find one I like, that fits all my needs and then I research reviews on it.  If anywhere in a review someone says anything about it tracking poorly, I move on.   That was my biggest frustration when I first started paddling, trying to get somewhere and the bow following each stroke. It almost turned me off from ever paddling again.   Useful page  Shows what a keel is"

Kayaking,3ch9h5,meohmy13,0,Wed Jul 8 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"Let me go on a minor little rant here:  I never wear a PFD.  I only kayak on the lakes of OK/TX and rivers as lazy as my English Bulldog.  I was a competitive swimmer for almost 15 years, 8 of those with USA swimming, and a Junior Olympic medalist -- plus all of the HS regional/state hardware.  I'm by no means the world's greatest swimmer, but I can hold my own.  The point being this:  If something were to happen while in my kayak, the last thing I want is to have my ability to swim under/around/over an obstacle hampered by a buoyancy device.   In most situations, I trust my swimming ability to get me out of a problem more so than popping up to the surface like a cork.  Now, if I were on the ocean or going down some rapids then it'd be an entirely different story -- I'd wear that PFD.  But a calm body of water like in the pic?  No way."
Kayaking,3ch9h5,Foxfire2,7,Wed Jul 8 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"You're more than welcome to have your opinion on the matter, and wear or not wear a pfd as much as you want. In my training as a paddler, numbers have shown that PFDs not being worn were critical in deaths due to paddling. Especially amongst beginners who don't know what they're getting themselves into.   One particular exercise I was shown included an Olympic swimmer as well as EMT's and coast guard members that were no strangers to swimming. All of them were tested on tasks with and without PFDs. Of course this was aimed at colder waters, but the results were as expected. All of them performed better when wearing them. Even the Olympic swimmer was not able to complete the tasks without the pfd. Let me say again, this was NOT done in a warm, calm place, like in the photo. Regardless, over and over we are highly encouraged to mention (especially to beginners) anytime we see paddlers without PFDs.   I can't assume every person in our sub's photos is an Olympic swimmer. I can't assume every person is paddling in a foot of calm water and the water temperature is 80 deg F. So I like to point it out when I see it so discussions like this can take place. It can hopefully promote safety amongst paddlers, especially those that don't know how useful a comfortable pfd can be."
Kayaking,3ch9h5,mrgermanninja,5,Wed Jul 8 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"My perspective...I'm not quite as strong a swimmer as you, but I also spent 10+ years swimming competitively and countless hours in the years before and after swimming in pools and oceans.  The trouble is, even on calm waters the unexpected can happen.  Weather can get ugly, equipment can fail, injury/emergency...I don't even know (and if I did I'd be planning for it!).    If I'm ever in a situation where I don't have it on and find that I suddenly need to have it on, I'm guessing that's a situation where it would be damn near impossible to get it on.  I honestly can't envision a situation that I could have swum out of unaided that would be made somehow worse or more dangerous because I had a PFD on, but I can think of plenty for which the reverse is true.  So I always wear mine, even in my slow, shallow ""home river"" that is at times barely navigable in the dry summer because it's too shallow in some places....you just never know what can happen."

Kayaking,3cl47v,slugbutter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"My wife had it for a while and thought it was very stable.   As far as rudders go: learn to paddle without it. Go as long as possible without it. Learn sweep strokes, correcting strokes, edging and rudder strokes. Then see how you feel about using a rudder.   Many people start using the rudder too early on, and then depend on it. They never develop good paddling technique because the rudder can do it easily. Then if a cable breaks they're screwed.   Rudders are very helpful in specific scenarios. But can harm paddlers if they become too dependent on them. At the same time, I believe your boat doesn't have a skeg, right? A rudder might be a good idea but wait a while...  Enjoy!"

Kayaking,3cjyr1,twoblades,3,Wed Jul 8 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'd suggest adding stern flotation at least plus bow flotation is possible, particularly if you'll be using the boat in moving water. These will help you immensely in self- or assisted rescues (which you should get training in and practice) and will displace a great deal of water weight. Never absolutely rely on hatch covers being watertight. Get a bilge pump for higher volumes of water in the boat plus a sponge for lower volumes of water in the boat. A sound-making device (whistle) is required in all navigable waters of the US and in every state of which I'm aware. A PFD (worn at all times) goes without saying. If you'll be on the water between sunset and sunrise a white light source is required that you can deploy in time to prevent collision. Drybag for extras, including a set of dry clothing (e.g. polypropylene shirt and bottoms) plus a better drybox of delicate electronics (camera/cell phone). Sunglasses and hat. A water bottle that can be clipped into the boat. I'm not a fan of paddle leashes, but some are. Consider and reach your own conclusion about what you'll do if you lose your paddle and get separated from it by wind...and it will happen. An extra 15' cam strap is a great multitasker to use in a stirrup rescue or as an over-shoulder tow system. Others have already mentioned compass, even of the simplest variety and even if you just stash one in your pfd pocket. Write your name and your emergency contact info in the boat in case you ever get separated from your boat so that it can be reunited with you and authorities don't spend thousands in needless search-and-rescue if you're sitting safe somewhere while your boat is floating around."

Use bow and stern lines if it is windy or going longer distances.  Bow and stern lines keep the boat from shifting and might keep it from ripping your roof rack off.    You have a $1,000 plastic sail riding around on the top of your car.  Bow and stern lines act as a good insurance policy.    I'm not sure what sort of tow points your Impreza/WRX/STI has.  Your best bet would probably be nylon webbing loops to secure under the hood or using the tow hook in the bumper"

Kayaking,3cf1vs,LazyEvaluation,2,Thu Jul 9 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"Most recently we did a trip going in on spoon lake.  It's pretty nice there because it is a bunch of lakes and they are all connected so you can go where you want.  There is a little stream flowing into Kohlman lake that goes back a ways and under a road which is pretty fun.    Lakes are nice when you are learning, or with inexperienced people because you can put in and get out at the same place without having to worry about going upstream at some point.  I've done a fair bit of paddling around Minehaha park on the Mississippi and that is pretty fun, as well as down by Fort Snelling.  I've been meaning to visit Pig's Eye Lake because of the egret/heron/etc nesting area on the island there, but there is no direct access so I haven't got around to it yet.  Most of these places I've found by just going on google maps and looking around until I find something that looks interesting then going to the DNRs recreational compass to find public accesses nearby."

Kayaking,3ch9c3,ashTr33,2,Tue Jul 7 22:08:34 2015 UTC,I had the same problem and sadly just replaced it with nuts from the hardware store. The hardware it comes with rusted very quickly so I replaced it all with better bolts and nuts.
Kayaking,3ch9c3,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Sound piece of advice. thanks for that.  Being that it was a previously owned craigslist buy,  I probably should have read a few more reviews before I made the purchase.  Which rack did you buy the 3-in-1 which can hold two kayaks or a canoe if you lay the bar flat?  I'm struggling to find the best position to place the yaks since the bar is more of an upside T than J saddles."
Kayaking,3ch9c3,KayakHipster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"I had the 3 in 1 rack. It has the middle arm that swings up to vertical. It was good while we used it - about two years. We had a Honda Fit so it was easy to load the boats onto it. We eventually moved on to a subaru and its roof is a bit wider, so it was hard to mount the boats all the way in the middle of the roof. I've since switched to yakima bow downs, those fold and sit right at the edge of the roof.   When we placed the middle arm vertical on the swiss rack, we were able to get both kayak on their sides onto it just fine. I would run cam straps from the vertical arm around the boat and onto the crossbars. Never had a problem with it besides the mounting hardware rusting. Oh, I also added some extra padding all around. On the top areas where the boats rested, as well as in the middle of the bottoms. I'll try to find an old photo.   Edit - found photos  http://imgur.com/YXAG3cO http://imgur.com/3l82oEG"
Kayaking,3cdt9y,Myatariisbusted,4,Tue Jul 7 03:19:32 2015 UTC,Haha wow I have never even heard of this one before. You're getting into some kooky rolls. You have to get yourself out of the tempest 170 and into a kooky Greenland boat.
Kayaking,3cdt9y,doplebanger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:54:47 2015 UTC,"The wackiness of it was the draw (and that it seemed attainable).  Now I need to get back to some foundations--my balance brace still sucks!  The Tempest does make some of the techniques a challenge as if I want to really lay back I have to thrust my hips a good 4+ inches out of the seat, which messes up my leg control. I'll be building a stitch and glue Petrel at the end of September. While not a Greenland boat, it has much lower volume both front and back (vs the Tempest) and a 20"" beam. A much more playful boat.  If I find that it doesn't go 'Greenland' enough for me, I may follow up by building a Black Pearl next year, but I'll focus on the first one first!"

Kayaking,3cdt9y,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"So when would you use this?   I don't know anything about kayaking, just delving in with some recreational sit-on-top action...but I'm very curious.  I understand there are different rolls, for different reasons?"
Kayaking,3cdt9y,MatildaMcCracken,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"This is possibly the least pragmatic roll I can think of. It only serves as entertainment.   Well... On one level, the better I  can understand any roll,  the better I'll eventually be at other ones. This one really isn't a building block for anything I know of.   Simply had it on my list of silly paddling tricks."
Kayaking,3cdt9y,nittanyvalley,3,Tue Jul 7 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"Nah man, I disagree. Although you'd never use this in real paddling, it's excellent as practice. You're essentially locking your arms and shoulders and forcing your torso to do all the movement needed for your roll. This is a fantastic exercise. Doing these kinds of rolls reinforces muscle memory in certain muscle groups. If you can roll with just a few muscles, think of how much easier your regular rolls will feel after getting these down. Well done man! Keep adding to the party tricks and make your regular rolls even better!"
Kayaking,3cdt9y,nittanyvalley,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:33:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  It did seem like a weird circumstance that you'd have both arms up and out over your paddle, but I bet the more you try, the more comfortable you get with rolls.  Good work--I would definitely freak out doing a roll!"
Kayaking,3cdt9y,Eloth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:27:15 2015 UTC,Nice! Heard of this but never seen it before. Very cool. I wonder if it can be done in a whitewater boat...
Kayaking,3cdt9y,nittanyvalley,3,Tue Jul 7 14:00:43 2015 UTC,"My assumption is always that whitewater folks    Have crazy strength and skills and can do anything with their boats Are crazy people and therefore have no limits to what they can do Are stereotyped by sea kayakers like me, but hopefully in a good way Hopefully don't take offence to my stereotyping since they are crazy and might hunt me down!   Hope to hear that you pulled it off in a ww boat!"
Kayaking,3cdt9y,Eloth,2,Tue Jul 7 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"I have a ton of respect for sea kayakers. I think of them as the road bikers of the kayaking community to the mountain biking-like dirt bags of the whitewater scene. Still doing different sports, but there is a set of skills that require practice and hard work with each. And a lot of those skills probably translate over."
Kayaking,3cdt9y,TheAnimatedFish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"I would say yes. I can straitjacket roll my river-runner (and am currently working towards a backdeck straitjacket -- any sea kayakers care to weigh in and tell me whether this is or isn't a thing?), and I would assume this is probably slightly easier."
Kayaking,3ccu80,h20rabbit,5,Mon Jul 6 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"The explosive in the water is the really dangerous element here. As water is not compressible, shockwaves from and explosion are not cushionned as much as in air and are much much more dangerous.

Kayaking,3ccu80,FlyingStirFryMonster,2,Mon Jul 6 22:57:22 2015 UTC,Yup.  This is pretty much how a depth charge works.....the kind they use to sink subs.  Guess it works on idiots in a kayak too.

Kayaking,3ccu80,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:15:52 2015 UTC,I agree. Basic safety is to light it and immediately move away a safe distance. I am just saying that the distance you need to be safe would be much bigger in water than air.

Kayaking,3cebxn,Ostirious,2,Tue Jul 7 06:28:09 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of beaver dams on the streams in our area.  If they are low enough, you can hit them at high speed to get part way up them, then use your sturdiest paddle, combined with weight shifts to jerk your way over the barrier.  It's tough on the boat and the paddle and looks pretty foolish.  Higher dams, you get out of the boat, drag it over, and get back in.  Good non-slip footwear is highly recommended."
Kayaking,3cebxn,Kayak4Eva,2,Tue Jul 7 10:06:46 2015 UTC,If it's early in the season around here I tend to bring a folding saw. There's a bunch of wetlands around here where it's really difficult to go around obstructions and sometimes just easier to spend the 10 minutes clearing the debris.  http://www.gerbergear.com/Hunting/Gear/Myth-Folding-Saw_31-001167  I use something like that.
Kayaking,3cebxn,Canadian_driver,2,Tue Jul 7 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"A small folding saw, or a chain/cable saw can be a great thing to have with you for many reasons. If this type of obstacle is common, the folding saw would probably do the trick. As mentioned, you can sometimes hit the o stacle with speed to slide onto it, then rock your way over. Lean back when you get near it to raise the front of your boat and get as much boat over as you can. Then lean forward and scoot your boat forward. This works better on some boats than it does others."
Kayaking,3cebxn,WheelsAndGears,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"Boof it or avoid it. Be careful around any kind of branches. I guess if it's flatwater, then it's not really a strainer."

Kayaking,3cebxn,Kudzupatch,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I have to ask why you were paddling there if you feel it is contaminated? The reason I ask is that you can go for a swim at any moment for any number of reasons. Anyone that has paddled very long can attest to the fact, when you least expect it is when you go swimming. So if you feel it is contaminated you shouldn't be paddling there."
Kayaking,3cebxn,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"It looks like that little jam up has been collecting a bit of crap for a while, by the amount of half rotten vegetation stuck in it. I can't speak for OP of course, but I feel like he was saying that he'd rather not considering all the crap sitting right there. A canal is usually fine to get out if you need to, but you're gonna sink up to your knees in muck a good bit of the time around here. It's a lot better to stay in unless you need to get out. From the picture, it looks like climbing around wasn't really an option, either. That grass will eat you up."

Kayaking,3ceq9f,BillNyeDeGrasseTyson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it was just the line of kayak I bought, but my first kayak was a Pelican and was awful. After one creek trip the seat rivets were showing through the bottom of the kayak, and getting a spray skirt to stay on it was virtually impossible. I brought it back the next day and went with a Wilderness Systems that was on sale at EMS. Between my friends and I we have 5 of the Wilderness Systems boats and they've all been awesome, highly recommended. They're a little pricier than most of your options, but you can usually find them on a good sale."
Kayaking,3ceq9f,DetroitOutpost,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:39:30 2015 UTC,"My first choice was an Elie, but the hubby convinced me to try and get our first boats used (OK, makes sense), so the higher end kayaks are harder to come across! I'm alright with spending a bit more, because I don't want to go through the hassle of trying to sell the boat in a year or two, when we realize we need the upgrade. I haven't seen any used Wildernesses yet. But I'll keep an eye out!"
Kayaking,3cdfcw,subLimb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:23:10 2015 UTC,"Very nice. A friend and I did 11 miles of the Roanoke river last week and were considering the new river. I was curious how the waters were with the route you took, if you hit any rough patches or complications. We encountered a bunch of shallow areas and my friend overturned his Cuda and lost his car keys out of what he thought was a secure dry hatch."
Kayaking,3cdfcw,Odditea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"The water level seemed to be just right for us. Rapids were all class 1 or 2. We each got a little stuck at least once on that route, but no more than a couple of times. Also, one of our kayakers took a pretty big spill around mile 12 on that map. Right around there, there is a rather large rapid and its not a great place to lose your boat. I had to circle back and help get his kayak to the bank so we could empty out the water. I was on a sit on top kayak which seemed to work perfectly.  We were all fairly inexperienced so I think the route should be fine for beginner to intermediate level. One other thing I would do differently is to leave earlier in the day if you plan to do a route that long. We left around 2:30 and got to our destination around 9, just as the sun was going down.  We kayaked on July 4th, here's a link where you can see what the water level was then: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/va/nwis/uv/?site_no=03175500&PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,62620,00062  Scroll down the page a bit for the graph."

Thanks for replying I really appreciate your input"
Kayaking,3cdc5s,Gnarfunkel,2,Tue Jul 7 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy both the Carolina and the Prodigy (10 and 12), for their own purposes. The Carolina I like to describe as a recreational touring boat, while the Prodigy 10 I call the bread and butter of the ponds. I live by saltwater ponds, small (30 min to paddle the longest length), and the ocean so touring is a real possibility. The impulse was 399 last year and they upped the price and didn't change the boat at all so the shop I work at actually stopped carrying it. 505 is the MSRP for Prodigy 10, or at least what we sell it at.  Prodigy 10 - Stable, slow, comfortable. This is suitable for your size and weight, if you were 6'4 250 I might recommend the 12 foot instead. For floating around and just hanging out this is a great great boat, I love it for that purpose and sell like 30 a year.  Carolina 12 - Sleaker, tighter cockpit area, still comfy. The 2 extra feet will give you better tracking and glide, think of a bike when you stop peddling and the bike glides. At 12 ft if you want to add a rudder I believe it is rudder ready (less than an hour and easy to install a rudder).  The Prodigy comes in a 12ft and the Carolinas we sell/rent are the 14s, that said they are different boats. Prodigy is the kind of boat you lift up your knees and chill, the Carolina is a step from the Prodigy towards a touring boat, much better if you want to paddle for distance/exercise or just want a bit more paddling performance.   The RIP is kind of a mix between these boats, recreational kayak moving towards a touring boat. Could be a good fit for you.  The kestral is a staple of the kayaking world and most similar to the Carolina but is it's own shape entirely.  I would reccomend sitting in them, flipping them over and looking at the shape of the bottom (Bath tub vs soft angles) and hopefully test paddling the models.   FYI: Spend the money and get a nicer paddle, it is what you hold in your hands and really is nice to have. (We sell 70$ alum shaft, plastic blade paddles but Carbon blend shaft, plastic blade at 130$ is so worth it, as is full fiberglass paddle for 165."
Kayaking,3cdc5s,Gnarfunkel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for responding, It was very insightful. So I'm wondering if the Carolina is worth the extra $400 because all I plan on doing is hanging out and cruising at a decent speed. Would you say the impulse/Prodigy 10 provide me that?"
Kayaking,3cdc5s,Bakerzona,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely can do that. The carolina will be faster in the water, but at 400$ if you plan to just have leisure days on the water it may not be worth. The prodigy is a very capable boat at a good price, rotomolded not blow molded so it is very durable. We sell wilderness systems boats and have loads of used stuff. Sometimes people buy used ""gloveboxes"" as I call them, when they buy a new prodigy because they are pretty nice, and fit snug over the cockpit while not encroaching to much.  http://www.amazon.com/Harmony-Kayak-Konsole-2014/dp/B00HZRFATM"

As a result we were put in a very dangerous position which could have easily resulted in death. Had it not been for the inexperience of one of our group members, we would have been nowhere near the river hazard, everyone would have stayed in their boats, and we would have paddled out the rest of the river without incident. The incident is a result of inexperience and it is our fault for bringing someone inexperienced with us. The incident is not a result of the equipment.

Kayaking,3cbw7d,BillNyeDeGrasseTyson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"My lessons learned/takeaways were not welcome. Stay away from strainers and let weaker kayakers stick to the lake. That's my takeaway.   Everyone elses takeaway was you shouldn't be on any moving water in a rec boat, which I disagree with. Simple as that. Why do they make spray skirts for rec boats if they're not supposed to be in moving water?"
Kayaking,3cbw7d,BillNyeDeGrasseTyson,5,Mon Jul 6 18:40:46 2015 UTC,I believe for small splash back. I've used them in pool sessions and even there they took in water.
Kayaking,3cbw7d,nittanyvalley,0,Mon Jul 6 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"They make splash decks for small splash back, spray skirts are meant to keep water out that comes over the top of the kayak."
Kayaking,3cbw7d,BillNyeDeGrasseTyson,5,Mon Jul 6 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're oversimplifying it.   I think everyone is in agreement that it was lack if skill and experience that got you here, but rec boats don't require any skill to paddle, whereas a whitewater boat is not nearly as forgiving, and therefore it actually forces one to learn some boat control. Plus, they typically have all the usual safety features that rec boats do not have (whitewater skirt, pillar to keep the boat from crushing, floatation, grab loops, etc.)"
Kayaking,3cbw7d,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"I understand the safety features of a whitewater boat, I own one. I intentionally left it at home as I don't think it is well suited to this particular river which is mainly flatwater. It takes a lot more skill to operate and is a lot less forgiving, as you mentioned."
Kayaking,3cbw7d,E11i0t,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. At this point, I feel like you're the dead horse and people are just beating you to death.  The videos I saw of your trip were some easy class I river stuff. I wouldn't say there was any need to have a whitewater boat for a river that just offered up some very quick sections. What seemed to have gotten you guys both times was not avoiding strainers. That could have easily been managed in a rec boat with more a more skilled person leading the way and the rest of the group following to avoid them. I think it's a bit overkill to say you need a spray skirt, crushproof boat, and intimate knowledge to typically handle a relatively easy waterway.  Can people get hurt in easy waterways? Sure! Your videos were a great example of the easiest way for things to go wrong: obstructions. At the same time, there are tons of folks navigating class I and easy II rivers in a sit on top with nothing but a pfd and a hat quite safely. Here in upstate SC there are some class I & II that people inner tube down regularly without incident."
Kayaking,3cbw7d,nittanyvalley,0,Mon Jul 6 19:34:05 2015 UTC,Whitewater is less forgiving.
Kayaking,3cbw7d,nittanyvalley,2,Mon Jul 6 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm a sea kayaker so a lot of this is good info for me to learn even if I might never use it.   I understand thoroughly the differences between rec and WW boats, have paddled both, and understand the difference in maneuverability. I've never paddled in a WW setting though, only WW rafting.   I have however been in a strainer situation with my sea kayak, and although I was safe while it was happening, the sheer magnitude of the force of the water onto my boat was scary as hell.   We were ending a class on playing with current. Around 6 knots. I was pulling over to the dock from which we launched, and immediately the boat got sucked in against the dock. Afterwards this was obvious and extremely stupid, as well as extremely dangerous. I certainly learned my lesson of always going to the far side of a dock when current is present.   In any case, the moment that happened, I was out of my boat and holding onto the dock, and my classmates made sure I safely went around the dock with the current and swam in behind the dock. My boat was being held against the dock since the cockpit filled with water. The pressure was tremendous. We spun the boat and then were able to move it from that position. While this happened we were all in safe places and were able to easily reach the boat while being on the dock.   It was a great lesson.   Now, having that in mind, what are the big points that allow a WW boat to safely deal with a strainer that a rec boat won't?   These are my assumptions, but I'd like to know which are right and wrong.    rec boats won't allow the maneuverability needed to avoid an obstacle quickly and safely - in this case a strainer a WW boat will allow a tough/watertight skirt (I use an expedition snap dragon that is ridiculously waterproof. Can take 5' waves crashing easily, stays on and dry) to keep water from flooding the boat. Will this also help in the case of a strainer? is the class I vs class II dispute dependent on water volume and/or speed? if a paddler is pinned in a strainer - what's usually the protocol for a rescue?"
Kayaking,3cbw7d,nittanyvalley,5,Wed Jul 8 11:36:23 2015 UTC,"They have a tighter seal on the deck, they have foam pillars to prevent the boat from crushing on your legs, they have grab loops, float bags, more maneuverable, and smaller in length and volume, with more rounded edges (more likely to slip through strainer).  Protocol is case by case, but if possible, eddy out behind the obstruction and get up on it and stabilize the person. Then figure out how best to extract them.  If you are the person going into the strainer, you want to try and jump up on/over it when you get to it. This involves a good bit of timing. If you miss, then you get swept down and under, and hopefully it is clear. I've done strainer drill practice in a class II section of river with a PVC pipe, and it is surprisingly difficult to not get swept under it."
Kayaking,3cbw7d,knobbysideup,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:22:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, awesome. That makes sense.   What about being the person in the strainer. I know it completely depends on the case - but is it better to try to keep them in the boat (skirt on) or for them to bail and try to get out first and worry about the boat after?  what I mean is, the boat is of no consequence if lost compared to a person. But in your experience, have you pulled people from danger like that out of their boats or is it easier to keep them in the boat?"
Kayaking,3cbw7d,knobbysideup,5,Mon Jul 6 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"I've never been in real situation involving a strainer. And hopefully I never will, but again it's case-by-case.  Anytime somebody is swimming in whitewater, your primary responsibility is to the person. Gear can be replaced. That being said, if the person is in a position to self-rescue themselves, I will then start to go after gear (if someone else hasn't already).  In a strainer situation, you first want to stabilize the person (i.e. keeping them from slipping under more...and in a position where they can breathe). This could be as simple as grabbing ahold of their PFD, or it could mean fastening webbing or ropes to them, or a stability line. Next, you work on what needs to be done to extract them, whether or not that is simply pulling or, worst case scenario, setting up a z-drag.   So again, since stabilizing the victim is priority, if they are still in their boat and stable, sometimes it makes sense to keep them there with their skirt on until you are ready to make a move. As soon as you pop the skirt and let the boat fill with water, the boat is going to start moving, and could take them with it.  Also, you need to move quickly, but do not be out of control. Time is always a factor in whitewater.  EDIT: Also, I am not an SWR instructor nor totally up to speed on latest best practices. This is just what I was taught and would I would do in a situation. Somebody else might have better recommendations. Best thing with strainers is to just avoid them altogether."
Kayaking,3cbw7d,kisielk,2,Mon Jul 6 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, got it. Yes, of course, gear is irrelevant when rescuing someone. I wondered what's the usual step list when trying to get someone out. That makes sense.   It's so interesting. For us in coastal kayaking our set of rules (once again, changes case by case) are so different. That's why it's so important to always paddle with people that know that particular discipline. You might know how to paddle, but you won't know the protocol for safety in situations that can pop up, as well as what those situations could be.   One of my instructors always talks about these stages:   don't know what we don't know know what we don't know  know what we know    It's a mix of both learning and experience. You need to learn from those who know more because they'll present you with cases you didn't know existed, and then hopefully you can learn how to deal with them."

So on the way out, I was turning into the wind, away from wakes. On the way back I was turning into wakes, with the wind.  I take pains to ensure that the paddle is centered. I'm actually stronger on the right than on the left, so it seems odd that I veer left.  I have had better luck with molded skeg designs as far as tracking but this has to be the least stable kayak that I've had the unpleasant experience of paddling."

Kayaking,3catn9,am0x,3,Mon Jul 6 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are many more cost effective routes to take. However, if you only have two doors, you may find it hard to secure the full kayak. They sell foam blocks that will secure the kayak properly, but then you have to make sure that it's going to be secured. It'll save you 100's, but it's a bit more risky and time consuming with each use."
Kayaking,3catn9,WeazelBear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:46:16 2015 UTC,Another option if you don' want a rack is a trailer. Uhaul will put a light duty hitch on most cars for around $150. Then you can get a Harbor freight 800lb trailer for ~200-250 and build a wooden rack to hold the yaks for $50.

Kayaking,3c8zvz,Languageofbromance,2,Mon Jul 6 00:47:18 2015 UTC,"Are you interested in sea/ocean kayaking, freshwater kayaking, or both? Do you want to do short trips (1-3 hours), all day trips (day touring), or potentially overnight trips? Do you want something extremely stable, or do you want something a bit more performance oriented (faster, ability to edge on its side, lean into turns, etc)?   Based on what you've said so far, it looks like at least a day touring kayak would be on your list.  I recently got started sea kayaking. My ocean kayaking, multi-tape gear list included (and is still incomplete):  Basics:   Kayak (in my case, a Delta 16 sea kayak) PFD Spray skirt  Paddle Signalling device Fox 40 pealess whistle). 50' of floating throw line (North Water Micro Throw Line) Pump (Aqua-Bound BilgeMaster) Sponge Compass Neoprene booties Reboarding device (North Water Sea Tec Paddle Float) Wall mounting hardware for garage Roof rack foam mounts, bow-line/sterm-line tie ropes, roof rack straps.   Other things you may want to consider:   Watertight flashlight Knife First aid kit Spare paddle Flares Emergency repair equipment (e.g. Duck Tape)   For your average paddler most of that will be overkill, but I'm going to be going on multi-day trips on the Pacific.   The hardest part for me was choosing which type of kayak to get. Your entry level ""fun on the lake"" options would be something akin to a Pelican - these are the ones you'd see at Costco/Walmart/hardware store/fishing store etc. Think $400-$800. These are called ""recreational kayaks"".   Stepping up from that, you'd be looking at a day touring kayak - e.g. Wilderness Systems Tsunami, Necky, etc. Typically made of polycarbonate plastic. $800-$1400. These typically have quite a bit of flex in the hull - a few brands (won't name names) have been cheaping out and using thinner plastic on even their higher end models; shop around. You'd want to get these from a proper paddling store (canoe/kayak store) who can fit you properly into one. These are typically referred to as ""Touring"" kayaks. You mentioned longer trips, so I wouldn't go for anything smaller than a touring kayak.  From there, things diverge quite a bit. You can get into multiday touring and sea kayaking. Delta Kayaks sit in the mid-range, made of thermoformed plastic which adds a bit of strength and a glossier appearance. Beyond that, $2000-$4000) you'd be looking at composite - fiberglass or some other similar material. Composite kayaks aren't generally a good idea for a beginner, given the cost and risk of damaging them.  I definitely agree with alfalfasprouts about taking lessons first. What I ended up doing was taking 12 hours of sea kayaking lessons, then jumping into the gear. Definitely try a lot of kayaks before you buy - it's a high upfront cost, but basically free (outside of gas) after that. You want something you'll be happy in, without the risk of overbuying or having them sit in the garage collecting dust."

It is great for storage in the apartment, but heavy to carry and awkward with the paddle and pump separate. It takes me about ten minutes to pump all chambers.

Kayaking,3c6cbh,clangerhammer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:59:50 2015 UTC,"I just bought this Oru kayak on Wednesday, so honestly this is the first time I've assembled/disassembled it! Setup and disassembly is pretty straightforward, takes me about 30 minutes while reading instructions and everything, but I'm confident that with time I'll be able to shave that down to 5-10 minutes.   It's a foldable, so no pumping required. As for transport and storage - it packs neatly into the back of my car and into the corner of my room at home :)  I haven't been in that many kayaks so I can't comment on how it compares. But in comparison to rental kayaks I've used, I like mine a lot better. It seems faster and more responsive. I think the Oru also tracks pretty well. Initial stability is low but secondary stability is high. I haven't capsized yet!"

Kayaking,3c28jp,WorldsGr8estHipster,3,Sat Jul 4 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"Our instructor group was taught and presented with enough cases where the pfd was key in people drowning or not. That doesn't mean every case is exactly the same, but there's many immediate things the pfd provides:  The best one is buoyancy. Especially for beginners in rec kayaks. Usually beginners have never attempted to flip their boats or tried getting back in while out on the water. Many claim ""I'm a great swimmer, no need"" but the simple fact that if you're wearing it you don't really have to tread water can make a huge difference.   Let's say it's your first time getting flipped. You'd need to first get calm after flipping, and hopefully there weren't any objects nearby that could hurt you. (Rocks, branches, etc) at this point you're treading water and figuring out how to flip back over a boat full of water. Remember, rec boats (especially entry level ones) don't have bulkheads and hatches, so dealing with a swamped boat is heavy work. If you add buoyancy to the person, they can focus on dealing with the boat and not worry so much about staying afloat. If you have to do it all in a deep place (trust me, it's hard swimming a swamped boat back to shore. A boat with watertight hatches, no problem. But a swamped rec boat is much heavier)   Second, getting back in. If you've never practiced this before, it's not easy. Especially if you're not athletic, flexible, and have good balance. Sit on tops are easier. Sea kayakers often practice rescues together. WW kayakers often know what they're doing because they paddle in groups for safety. Rec boaters might have never done this before, therefore if they're trying to figure it out for the first time, it's tiresome. Some people need assistance getting back in, or should be using a paddle float technique to do so but have never learned how to do it. Anyway, a pfd will help you get a bit extra oomph to get back into the boat. It'll also give you more attempts because you won't be as tired from treading water.   Last thing, putting on a pfd while in the water is ridiculously hard. People say ""I'll put it on when I flip"". Try it sometime. Also, let's say there's a tiny bit of current or wind when you flip. Guess where the pfd will be? Attached to the boat floating away and you're left treading water. And trust me, in some wind, there's no way you can swim fast enough to catch your boat.   These are just a couple of scenarios as instructors we're taught with. I don't claim to know the settings for every photo I see here, but if I can bring up these points and have a discussion every time I see someone not wearing them, I might get them to think about it next time.   Sorry, one more last thing. When I go over to help rescue someone, it's 100% better for me if they have a pfd. Automatic handles for me to pull on and help them up. I don't have to worry about them sinking, meaning, I can let them float while I take care of their flipped boat without worry of them sinking. All around, it helps with rescue situations.   And that's my rant. It's always up to the person to wear them. But in almost all drowning cases, the first thing the rescue team reports is ""pfd not worn""."

Kayaking,3c21mz,the__Real_SlimShady,2,Sat Jul 4 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"I got the same kayak from Costco, two of them actually. I went with the cheapest rack on Amazon, I believe it was $75 for two sets. It was a pain putting it on the roof rack. Since yours is already up, you're good. I had ratchet straps that I loop under the rack and over both kayaks. One in the front and one in the back. It does a great job keeping them tied to the car. My longest trip has been under half an hour, but the kayaks don't move at all, something there (I think it's the seat straps) vibrate and make some noise, other than that they stay put. If you're talking about buggy cords or something similar, I'd be nervous putting them up there, I tend to see a lot of those on the side of the road.  As for how often you should check, it's been about 6 weeks and I noticed the rack moves more when I shake it. So it's time to go over the bolts one more time. I didn't notice any loose bolts, but they must've loosened just a little.  Also, the kayak is 50 pounds, it's very awkward carrying it by yourself. The seat will come off the kayak. It's held with screws, but if you shift at all, you just rio them off the kayak. I just put it down and sit. If you don't plan on flipping it over, it should be ok. Good luck, I hope this helps. Enjoy."

I was also told it would zigzag its way but really have not had that issue either. The only issue is I would have liked a compartment to put stuff in, just a small one but it's really not a big issue. The one in the back is fine, I just have to be an owl to get stuff from back there."
Kayaking,3c21mz,KayakHipster,2,Sat Jul 4 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"We usually recommend cam straps instead of ratchets to not damage the boat. Those will go around the boat and secure it to the crossbars or roof rack, not the J rack. That way if the bolts fail, it's still attached holding onto your car.   Then run a bow and stern line. You can go from the handles in the front and back to any solid part of your car. On my subaru I attach the back one to one of my hitch loops, and on the front I have metal hooks right under the front bumper for just that purpose. I'm sure your jeep has something like it. Just make sure it's a solid part of the chassis.   Edit - I'm unsure if what I said was clear. I usually loop the cam strap through the top of the J bar, around the boat, and down onto the crossbars. Someone I know likes going from crossbar, up and around the boat, and back down to the crossbar. Whatever works for you as long as you have some of it attached on the crossbars/roof rack rather than J rack only."
Kayaking,3c21mz,Rumhead1,2,Sat Jul 4 01:32:37 2015 UTC,Have a jeep as well. I have an upright load bar for the rear - http://www.amazon.com/Tricam-SLE-1-Extender-350-Pound-Capacity/dp/B00HDL2DX6. For the front I just take off the front panels of the hard top and tie directly to the roll cage resting on the windshield frame (with a pool noodle).  I also have a  short steel cable looped around the cage and attached to the one of the kayak handles with a carabiner. That's my OCD last resort if somehow everything else fails.  Edit - duh didnt realize you were going 8 hours. Probably don't want to do that with the top off. I recommend the load bar though!

Kayaking,3c0fcm,kayakerjosh,3,Fri Jul 3 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"oh wow.  you are new to this.  i fished out of a ride 135 for shark for a couple years, but i mainly do whitewater now in one of these.  tracking (without a skeg or rudder) is 5% the boat, 15% wind and current, and 80% paddling technique, so don't sweat that.  to develop your picture a little better, the boat spectrum runs from the boats you're looking at now all the way to luxury boats like the jackson fishing boats (coosa and cuda) and ""mirage drive"" hobies (outback or pro angler).  i'd check craigslist as boats lose value like cars.  despite what people say, plastic is difficult to repair, so if something has a crack or a deep gouge, walk away.  hobie boats are the most expensive, but they hold value like blue chip stocks.  the mirage drive is pretty awesome for fishing.  here's a bunch of seats.  inflatables are pretty plush as are the lifted folding chair style like on the jackson boats, but own the boat for a bit before you buy a seat.  even the least comfortable seats are fine for a few hours a day, and after about 4 hours, even the most comfortable seats are just stadium seats with backs.  every manufacturer claims their boats are so stable you can stand in them.  you can (maybe) stand in optimal conditions, but you wont be able to cast from that position without outriggers (also called ""amas"").  dont even bother with outriggers your first season, they're a pain: make paddling difficult and slow the boat down by adding drag.  PFD: the life vest.  buy one that looks cool and is comfortable.  wear it like your life depends on it.  don't get an inflatable.  paddle: here's rei's article on it.  start with a plastic one.  i could write a thesis on paddle variables, don't spend a lot and dont panic. i like 35 degree offset.  longer shafts will let you paddle without hitting the boat so much, shorter shafts will make the paddle more vertical and closer to the boat which will help with tracking.  it's really not as big of a deal as people make it out to be, but it's a great conversation starter with other paddlers.  you'll learn to work with what you have.  reduced weight and blade rigidity are what you pay for here.  accessories: a fishing crate, diy.  a plastic (floats) fish gripper is nice to have  josh's ghetto fab roof rack: 1 car you don't mind scratching up a little, 2 pool noodles, 2 ratchet straps around the sides (tight, should be able to rock the car by shaking the boat with these 2 straps alone), put some twists in them to eliminate the BZZZZZZZ sound above 35mph.  bow and stern rope (firm, but not tight) tied to something metal (NOT plastic body parts).  the driver is responsible for any damage caused by things they lose.   recommend playing in the boat once without any gear to practice paddling, flipping it, and getting back in.  if you get something really big, loosen the drag when you bring it up to the boat so it can't get leverage.  sun screen and a hat are nice to bring.  in the winter, grab some scupper plugs to fit in the holes (scuppers) in the bottom of the boat.  don't put a pole in the scupper as they are weak points on the boat.  good luck!"
Kayaking,3c0fcm,kayakerjosh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:48:53 2015 UTC,Awesome! That's a lot of great info. Didn't even think of the paddle as something I need to invest in as well. I'm thinking that a sit on top kayak might be my best bet according to everyone's consensus. Thank you!

If I were to get serious about kayak fishing, especially fly fishing, I would be looking for a kayak designed for fishing.  Many of new one are very wide and stable and raise the seat  up a good bit which would be really nice for fly fishing... heck, any type of fishing.  Now everyone is different and sitting down low might not a present a problem for you, but I would find it very awkward to flyfish that low to the water. That is why I would want a real fishing kayak. But I can also tell you that $500 probably would not buy one."

Kayaking,3bxycv,nittanyvalley,2,Fri Jul 3 02:25:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do it. I think you compromise a lot with modular and inflatable kayaks. The only reason I would ever get one was if you have absolutely no place to store a kayak.
Kayaking,3bxycv,Bad-Phish,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"How open is the open water you're talking about?  I haven't tried the modular kayaks, but two kayaks (in my opinion) are much better than a tandem. Tandems require great communication and coordination between the two paddlers. This is not easy to do when starting out, and can lead to arguments.   Also, being able to just grab one boat anytime you want to go by yourself is alone worth two smaller boats.   Then again, if it turns out the modular boats handle well maybe you can disregard my comment. But I would recommend for two separate ones instead.   Cheers!"
Kayaking,3bxycv,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:11:30 2015 UTC,"I dont know how modular yaks handle, my only concern would be that after a while in sun and seawater, the joins better hold as you dont want it splitting in the right middle of the choppy water. From experience, I own a tandem and a single kayak. But I will be getting rid of my tandem as it is too hard to handle especially with both paddlers battling for balance. My tandems maiden yak fishing voyage ended in disaster when one of the paddler (a mate) over balanced and a small wave helped it along. A solo yak is more fun and easier to handle and at least you can have the partner who is out of the water assist if one capsizes. Jusy my opinion though, as one day I would probably look at the Hobie tandems as they seem very stable for a duo."
Kayaking,3bxycv,mrhodes667,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:52:25 2015 UTC,I've done both and definitely prefer individual kayaks. I have no experience with the modular design but would guess they are heavier.

Kayaking,3bv6ca,jahallah,2,Thu Jul 2 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"You may think this is a big no-no, however, I have been hauling multiple boats around for years and never use them.  This includes Kayaks, Canoes and Jon-boats.  All on roofracks.  That being said, I never use ""cinch straps""  I always use 2 positive locking ratchet straps and make sure that they are nice and tight and if I have to drive any major distance, I double up and use 4 of them.  Never had any problem whatsoever with this method.  The only issue is that you have to make sure to put a twist in the straps so they don't ""hum/vibrate"" when going at highway speeds.  I have seen people lose a boat before (1 kayak, 1 canoe), but it's always been because they used either rope or cinch straps.  Always carry at least 2 extra ratchet straps with you as well just in case you break one, or need extra protection.  Also, if possible, always anchor the straps to the feet of the rack, and not the bars.  That's a much stronger anchor point.  The bars flex.  the feet don't."
Kayaking,3bv6ca,iaintcommenting,3,Thu Jul 2 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"And what happens if you're in a collision or your roof rack fails or the feet of your rack fail or either of your two straps fails?  Do you wear a pfd while boating or a seat belt while driving? The answer is probably yes because it's foolish not to. You can add bow and stern tie down in less than 120 second and they cost less than $10. If you don't have them and anything fails in your system then your boat can and will become airborne and you are liable for any property damage, injury, or loss of life caused by that. Can you really rationalize that risk just because you don't feel like securing your cargo properly?"

Kayaking,3bv6ca,Starfire66,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"The odds of anything you described having an affect on how I carry my boats is extremely small.  If anything were to be violent enough to remove the rack from my car, a bow/stern line isn't going to save the situation.  Believe me, I am very aware of what may happen with an unsecured load.  I've hauled all manner of small/medium/large and light to very heavy objects thousands of miles.  (cars, trucks, boats, engines, generator sets, small buildings, etc.)  Once you've done enough of it, you generally know what the limitations are for the straps & chains you're using vs. the load.  Even the small generic 1"" ratchet straps have a 2000lb+ break strength and 700lb working load strength.  If my 50-60lb boats break those due to some other outside force (collision, wind shear, etc.) I have much bigger problems to deal with than losing a boat off the roof."
Kayaking,3bv6ca,jahallah,2,Thu Jul 2 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how you are attaching your boats and the material your boats are made of. the safest way is with all the stress pulling the boats against the bar. Any other way and you are going to cause some damage to either the boat our your car/roof.  That having been said, you typically need to load your straps around the tapered ends of the kayak, i.e. where it starts to get skinny but not too skinny. The problem with this is after a certain amount of time, high crosswinds can make your boat turn and flex, especially if it's plastic. there needs to be a secure line on your bow to prevent slippage out of the center tiedowns ideal position.   Heat, sun and wind will affect your tie down on the road, especially with plastic boats and without bow and stern tiedowns will eventually wiggle themselves out of the ideal position making them a danger to others."
Kayaking,3bv6ca,iaintcommenting,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:53 2015 UTC,That's why you always check your straps/load every time the vehicle is stopped.  ;-)
Kayaking,3bv6ca,Starfire66,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"Right, which only helps for the time between just after you stopped and when it wiggles itself loose again, which could happen instantly. ;-)  The bow/stern tiedowns aren't there to prevent strap failure, they are there to prevent your kayak from sliding or wiggling out of the side strap effective threshold. I have a plastic SOT that loves to catch wind on J bars and wiggled  the wing nuts loos and slid down the cross bar. Nothing happened, but that's probably because I had my front and rear tiedowns."
Kayaking,3bv6ca,Ringo7979,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that what I'm suggesting is incredibly unlikely, but the probability of needing a seat belt or a pfd is extremely low and you still use them, right? There's 4 reasons somebody doesn't use simple safety practices like that: they couldn't be bothered to take the extra couple seconds to do it right, they don't want to incur the extra expense of doing it right, they're ignorant of the risk, or they simply don't care about the risk.  ""I don't bother because it won't happen to me"" isn't a good enough reason."

Kayaking,3buqml,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"Nonsense.  There's lots of times a rec boat is perfectly appropriate.   If you want one boat that will do a little of everything then a rec boat is fine.  They're cheap, nigh indestructible, and very stable.    You just need to know your limits.  Putting a rec boat in water like this is VERY dangerous because even though the rapids aren't particularly bad, the level is up and you just don't have the maneuvering ability to get out of the way of strainers.  Compounding the danger is the lack of appropriate gear and knowledge.   Here he is in the same getup while there's ice on the water."

Kayaking,3buqml,balls_deep_theist,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly my stance on it. Nothing wrong with 8-10 foot Pelicans. Yes, they're slow and not great materials, but it can get out on the water and enjoying yourself for super cheap. And you can safely paddle for years with them. That's where my wife and I started. We had a ton of fun paddling lakes in NY, CT and NJ for an entire year before we decided sea kayaking was our next step.   On the other hand, we continue to see tons of posts of people that head in to dicks, get a entry level boat that's only meant for calm waters, and go paddling in swift currents or open ocean, often without a pfd and not knowing the first thing about safety.   Edit - wanted to add: a big part of my gripe isn't with the actual boat, but with the places where they are sold. Employees at a real kayak shop will usually advise new paddlers on accessories to get and safety measures for their new boat. Dicks and Walmart won't care if someone buys a boat there and then goes down some WW five minutes later."

Basically their (Dick's/Walmart/Dunham's + Pelican/Dolphin) business model is get these boats in people's hands as cheaply as possible. I'm all for lowering the barrier of entry to a sport, but at some point it starts to attract the wrong kind of people, or people with the wrong mentality or mindset. It's like when you visit wilderness attractions that are roadside vs. ones you have to actually put some effort to get to. (My other gripe is they are way overpriced sometimes for the quality of boat. $300-$500 for a thermo-formed kayak? Yeah right.)  EDIT: This is also one of my biggest gripes with PFDs as well. A lot of the lower end ones are NOT comfortable at all, and I'm sure that plays a large role in why people don't wear them. I tell people all the time, get a paddling-specific PFD and you'll want to wear it. They are actually quite comfortable, and have lots of useful features on them for on the river."
Kayaking,3buqml,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was all in jest. We make fun of rec boats but I'd say that's where most kayakers start. I still own two of them.

Kayaking,3buqml,somewhereonariver,3,Thu Jul 2 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you'd fit in nicely with these other Alaskans, who want signage put up on the rivers to warn them of rapids because it was harder than they expected.  Having paddled a few of the rivers in your videos, a couple of things stick out:   You are not dressed appropriately for the conditions. Kayaking in Alaska pretty much requires drysuits, or wetsuits and dry tops at a minimum. You need to dress for immersion. And have a backup plan if you can't paddle out, especially considering how remote Alaska and it's rivers are. You are using kayaks that are not suited for the type of water you are paddling. Big box store rec kayaks are not suitable for swift moving water that requires maneuvering, especially with the log jams that you can frequently find on Alaska's rivers. You all lack the requisite paddling skills to safely be paddling those rivers. Find somebody to teach you how to paddle. You should be able to eddy turn, peel out, ferry, read water, and know basic safety. I didn't see any of that in this video. They are simple skills to learn, require some practice, but are difficult to learn on your own.   If this comes off as arrogant or condescending....sorry? It's these kinds of videos and paddlers that screw up paddling, river access, and the entire sport for the rest of us. In my 2+ years of whitewater kayaking, I've dealt with and read about enough bad incidents on the river. Anything that can be done to help prevent or minimize them in the future should be heeded. Lots of people here are giving some tough advice and harsh criticism. Don't let your ego get in the way of following some good advice that can probably save you or your wife's life in the future."

The basics are a sleeping pad, sleeping bag and some shelter/tent.  Some yakking friends prefer a hammock these days.  If you want to cook meals, get a camp stove for boiling water and food that is made by boiling water - traditional cooking adds a lot of complexity for a yak camping trip."

If you want to build a fire you need a lighter and preferably some fuel/lighter fluid to get it started.  You can start a fire with just the lighter, but it can be pretty difficult if you can't find the right tinder to get started (no small stuff, too wet, etc.).  If you don't want to carry a bottle of lighter fluid (like charcoal lighter fluid)  you can buy a small camping fuel bottle (spun aluminum) and a gallon of white gas (camp stove fuel) and just take that.  Camp stove fuel is similar to lighter fluid, it has a lower flash point so it's not dangerous like gasoline."

Kayaking,3bmoux,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 30 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"We had a tour this past weekend and one person came unannounced. We didn't have a kayak for him. He rented a SOT to still come out with the group and when the wind got going, he was an out of control barge while the rest of us in nice sea kayaks were enjoying the chop. We had to have him in tow the entire time we were exposed to the wind - and mind you, he was a strong guy and was paddling hard the entire time."

I feel like myself, and a lot of craiglist users in this area for marine equipment are looking to get on the water as cheaply as possible. If we were trying to spend more than around 200, we could easily just go to a store since there is a plethora of kayaks at the 250 dollar range in brand new condition."

Kayaking,3bpv4e,DoIBowOrDoICurtsy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"Give it some time unless you need the cash. Looking at other kayaks in your area, it seems most are going for lower, though many of them are sit on top or fishing setups. Worst case scenario, you drop the price some. In the meantime, think about maybe tossing in a paddle or PFD to sweeten the deal a bit if you're not using them for another boat."

Kayaking,3bpv4e,nittanyvalley,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe $300. But still, even though it is in nice condition it's a pretty base rec boat. Not worth $600."
Kayaking,3bpv4e,doplebanger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"I think that depends a lot more on the area than whether or not it's a base rec boat. If you're in a place where there aren't many sit-in boats for sale, you'll get more. If the market is flooded with them, you'll get less. I think anyone would buy a boat for $500 or so if they liked that model rather than pay $1000 for a new one."
Kayaking,3bpv4e,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:29:50 2015 UTC,Depends entirely on location and market. I'm in MN and $500 is definitely a solid price for this boat. I bought my 9.5' perception sound rec boat for $200 w/o a paddle 4 years ago and I could easily resell if for about the same any year in spring/summer when people are looking for yaks.

Kayaking,3bmxjo,lexicohollis,5,Tue Jun 30 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"If you're asking if it handles flatwater well, no.  Whitewater kayaks are not designed to go straight. They will spin out constantly, one way or the other if you aren't paddling with good technique (it's a feature, not a bug).  You could look into getting a crossover with a skeg (Dagger Katana, LiquidLogic Remix XP, Jackson Rogue, Wavesport Ethos), but they aren't the best whitewater kayaks to learn in either. If you want to do whitewater, I suggest getting a whitewater specific boat. Can always buy a rec boat later.  Anecdote: I started off in a crossover kayak because I didn't know anyone who did whitewater and all my friends paddled rec boats ""all the time"". I've since found out that my rec boating friends hardly ever paddle compared to the local whitewater boaters...who are out multiple times a week. Within 6 months, I bought a whitewater specific boat because I was already starting to see the limitations of my crossover in whitewater. If you want to learn how to kayak, and be out doing it a lot, get in with whitewater, sea kayakers, or touring kayakers. Those are the easy-to-access paddling disciplines that require skills, technique, and will incrementally challenge you. I will say that in my case, once I started to learn whitewater, flatwater/rec boating just wasn't that appealing anymore, unless it's stellar company."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,nittanyvalley,4,Tue Jun 30 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice. And I completely agree with calm conditions not being appealing unless with great company. I'd like to add if it's in great scenery. Some lakes or calm rivers are truly stunning and I'd put up with a boring paddle if that feeling of ""crap, I'm so lucky to be out here right now"" is there."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 30 17:41:09 2015 UTC,True...great company and/or great scenery.

Kayaking,3bmxjo,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 30 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"All of the above really.

Kayaking,3bmxjo,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 30 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"I would stay off the crossovers and just join a club. Maybe rent a whitewater boat and buy a rec boat. Whitewater boats are pricey, rec boats aren't.  Mind you, a river-runner will probably do most flatwater than most of the bathtub rec boats out there. Either way I find most people who buy crossovers either never use them on WW or sell them in favour of a proper WW boat."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,Eloth,2,Tue Jun 30 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"I know we've gone back and forth on the whole ""buy vs. demo/rent"" for getting into whitewater. Here's an interesting take I just read on that from a guy near me that owns an outfitter. Granted, he is biased because part of his job is to sell boats, but he's probably got more first hand experience than anybody in terms of what keeps people paddling:   My take on paddling whitewater and many have heard this before. First get that first boat, buy into the sport. You'll need this boat in your possession as one of the tricks to success is repetition. You will have a bad day, owning your own boat will make it a little more difficult to walk away, your likely to shake off the bad day, give it another chance and have the time of your life. Owning this said boat will have you becoming part of the paddling community. As you have now bought that first boat and are financially tied to the sport those paddlers who know where to go, when to go and know how to do it will certainly give you their time. Kayaking is a sport of information with it you will likely succeed. The only reason that you will ever fail is if you give up. You will find that your usually only a trip or two away from figuring it out ...."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,nittanyvalley,3,Thu Jul 2 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not really going to argue for renting vs buying -- I don't think it makes a difference. The reason I sometimes suggest renting from a club is because they'll give you appropriate equipment for what you're doing and your size. A 13 year old in a Jefe Grande is going to have a hard time, for instance.  That said, buying first is maybe the better choice so long as you get the right boat. I had the luck of being given my Necky Jive for a birthday present, which got me into whitewater. Fortunately, it happens to be an amazing river-runner and ended up being the perfect size for the way I am now, so yeah. If buying a boat got me started as good as it did, I'm not going to criticise.  In this case I suggested renting because of OP's dual requirements."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,Eloth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:50:24 2015 UTC,"Good deal. Yeah I wasn't trying to turn this into an argument, but he brings up some good points. That being said, at least around us, not that many clubs have extra gear around for demo/rent it seems (I'm wondering if that has a lot to do with liability in U.S.?). Your best luck is to find someone willing to let you borrow for a bit, but it's still a short term loan. Anybody who asks us about getting into whitewater, we typically point them towards a modern river runner or river running play boat (i.e. Jackson Fun) to get into it. Hard to go wrong with any of those, assuming they are the correct size. Also, the used boat market here is pretty good, so always suggest buying used, and if you don't like it, sell and get out or get a different boat. It'll still be a small loss, but still much cheaper than renting or buying new."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,nittanyvalley,2,Thu Jul 2 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. I can't really speak for other clubs but my own club will rent newbies gear (we have a fleet of Z.ones and Master TGs as well as a few Axioms and assorted other boats). Would definitely never suggest buying new if you're just getting into WW!"

Kayaking,3bmxjo,Eloth,2,Thu Jul 2 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of it comes down to the fact that many kayaks are designed to do one thing well. Sea kayaks are designed to go in a straight line, be sea worthy in bad conditions and be able to haul a decent amount of gear. But you wouldn't want to take a 17 foot sea kayak down a narrow river or on any whitewater as it would perform very poorly (and most likely get destroyed). A whitewater play boat would be great on the river but incredibly slow on any large open bodies of flat water.   Where things deviate from this is rec boats. They are the all around boat that can do everything, just rather poorly. I'd your plan is to paddle easy things casually this may be the perfect compromise, it really comes down to deciding what your intentions are in kayaking, then getting a boat to match. If you have friends that are into whitewater get a whitewater boat. If your into kayak camping on big open bodies of water, get a sea kayak. If your crew is into the frequent chill booze cruise down your local river, a rec boat is your friend.   Regardless of what you choose, get out there and enjoy the water!"
Kayaking,3bmxjo,hypothesize_this,3,Tue Jun 30 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"They are the all around boat that can do everything, just rather poorly.   Rec boats can't do everything. In fact, they can't do much of anything, and what they can do, they do rather poorly. You can really only take them on calm lakes and some class I-II- moving water, but you can do that with a lot of other boats and get much more out of the experience."
Kayaking,3bmxjo,nittanyvalley,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:52:18 2015 UTC,It's possible to paddle Sea Kayaks in pretty intense whitewater if you're a good enough boater.   Rec Boats? Nope.   I only say the bit about Sea Kayaks because I've been passed by Sea Kayaks on Class V big water rivers. It hurt me right in the ego.

I didn't realize it would just dive through the waves like that, front or rear."
Kayaking,3blyto,captain_manatee,3,Tue Jun 30 08:15:06 2015 UTC,It's really designed to be paddled with a skirt
Kayaking,3blyto,Eloth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:36:19 2015 UTC,"J hooks -- $9. I expect to use 20 or so, wide in the rear and tight in the front. Lashings all over, stainless steel screws from work. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TZS5MC4?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=ITMNSBLXZCXWY&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl[3]  Cording -- $10. I figured nylon paracord would be the most water restistant, and was cheapest.. and LIME GREEN. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HAMIUNK?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=IHHH77VI4GFX8&psc=1&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl[4]    Do you actually need this? None of my boats have it, and in moving water it's going to be an entrapment hazard more than anything else (though I really don't suggest you go in any serious moving water). You'd also probably want something more elastic than paracord.   Handles -- Free, $7, or $12+Shipping. Point of contention. I can always just use plastic tubing and tie it off properly. I'm leaning towards the rubber bike handles and using paracord to connect them (I'd trim the handles to fit), they're only for carrying after all. I don't think standard handles will fit this kayak, or you'll destroy them too easy because of how tight they would be. The molded gaps are atleast 4"" apart, I'm afraid it will just rip the prebuilts apart. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1Q85V0?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=I22KLG26ZZLDWX&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl[5] versus prebuilt http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RQZTVE?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=I2TT7L5GXTITMB&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl[6]    Those 'prebuilt' handles are designed to go on the rope that's already there. Really I'd just stick with what it's already got.   Footpegs -- Free, $7, or $30. Another vs.... I'm so tight in this kayak, I have two places to put my legs -- relaxed and on the pegs -- that aren't there. I will never adjust these things, ever from what I can tell (3 hours time so far)... so my impression on this is either A)use threaded aluminum with pool tubes on it (free), or B)Bike pegs, again free or $5, or C)Spend the $30 on 15"" adjustible footpegs.. and they look damn cheap, like I'd break them cheap.. I don't expect this to be adjustible, I can take things apart and remove/replace/adjust myself if needed. If someone can come up with a reason, or even HOW to do it in the kayak, I'll gladly listen listen. I'm leaning towards A or B. B being -- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAGJNGQ?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=I18FIUK56RZGKS&psc=1&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl[7] and C being -- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O1KR3Y?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=IQ0HIKNITHQT5&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl[8]    Don't bother with footpegs. Use minicell foam to build a bulkhead in the front. Again, we don't use footpegs in moving water (and again, I would suggest you stay away from the moving water). Should be a cheap, easy, and safe solution.   Spray Skirt -- $50. This is the only thing I truly don't know about. I got SOAKED (4"" deep inside of a 8-9ft kayak) the first time I truly messed up in ~2ft rapids. I want to go cheap, the spray skirt costs almost as much as the entire kayak itself. $50. The fit size on the site and reviews sold me, really. Total lack of knowledge here, and everything better is up into ~$150 territory, more than the kayak and upgrades total. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IE4X4MK?colid=3TXH72A2YSWQ7&coliid=IVSUKCOE38CKV&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl   That's a full nylon deck. Alright if all you plan on taking is the occasional splash, but it won't keep much water out.   stickerbombing   Haven't seen it done, and it may just peel off or look crap. Scratches might ruin the effect. Do it if you want, I can't advise you on how it'll turn out."
Kayaking,3blyto,captain_manatee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:55:34 2015 UTC,"eloth did a good job of going through everything, I just have a few other things to add.  I'm assuming you've checked craigslist, but have you checked the northeast paddler's message board? at http://www.npmb.com/ The people are spread all over the northeast but you may find something close-ish.  Another resource for the skirt is http://www.skirtfit.com/ which will help you find the dimensions for your boat and make sure the skirt fits. You might be able to get a nicer skirt used for a similar price?  And to reiterate what eloth said on the feet placement, whitewater boats made in the last 20 years don't use pegs. Most have adjustable bulkheads that are wide enough that your feet can't slip past.  Getting one for an old boat like the sparc may be pretty difficult, so foam may be your best bet."
Kayaking,3bm5jv,haliwood13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:47:24 2015 UTC,"Its OK to put the mount outside the bar's foot.  Just when you lash the kayak down, make sure the strap goes inside the bar.  Otherwise there is a risk the strap pops off the end.  I do this with my canoe all the time.  My bars extend much further out than yours, I've put complete bikes on the outside with no problem.  As long as everything fits and tightens up good, you'll be fine.  If you want to play it really safe, pull over after 10-15 minutes and check everything is still tight.  I check boats every coupld hours on longer trips.  I've been using bar racks since '97 and haven't lost anything yet."

Kayaking,3biib2,yourenotmydad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:31:20 2015 UTC,Fwiw: I was told not to store my plastic kayak in direct sunlight for prolonged periods -- the heat and UVs breakdown the plastic. If that's truly the case then a vehicle may not be a good choice.

Kayaking,3bksc6,BlowDuck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Well, not necessarily. ""Great Lakes Paddling"" covers a variety of paddling. It's kept general because based on your skill level and route, you certainly may need some fancy outfitting or you may just be out on a sit-on-top or a rec boat splashing in the shallows near Cave Point."

Kayaking,3bjisp,crycrywolf,7,Mon Jun 29 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"When paddling correctly, the entire body should be engaged, especially the core. Do a quick search on Google or YouTube for ""the kayaking forward stroke"" and you'll see how much emphasis goes into using all major muscle groups, rather than ""bicycling"" your hands and only using biceps.   It is truly a great workout and it's up to you how much you want to push each time you're on the water.   Just like biking or hiking in beautiful areas, kayaking allows you to work your body in a truly beautiful setting (if you have access to it) and the sound of the water and wildlife always helps.   One thing to mention though, kayaks have to fit your body very well. You should only buy your friend's boat if you two share a very similar build. Otherwise I recommend you find a boat that fits you, and will do what you want to get out of it.   Cheers!"

That's when I started really feeling it. Other than the seat my only complaint is the back storage isn't water tight. My dad and I are working on making a hard plastic cut out that we can fit in the storage and seal the back from the rest.  The problem with making a seal there is that it will make the spout at the back useless due to being blocked of from the rest of the kayak. So we're thinking running a tube from the spout to the center of the plastic seal and basically funneling the water right to the tube.

It's also very stable, although the biggest waves I've seen on a lake with it were a little less than a foot and I haven't taken it on any rivers yet.    I'm 6'2 and pretty heavy so you might want to take a look at the 10' ones. It is a bit heavy, although well balanced so it's not too much of a problem for me to get it on the car.  See if you can pick one up and move it around at the store to get a better feel for the weight.  I got it on sale for around $640, but its normally around 800, so I'm not sure that would be in your price range.  Are you still in Maine or buying it here?  I got mine from Maine Sport Outfitters just outside Rockport on route 1.  They have a pond where you can try out any kayaks right next to the store.  Here are a couple pictures I have of it.  You can see the seat controls, the front of the seat can lift up or down by pulling the red cord, the red tab on the sides let you move the seat back forward or back, and the knob on the seat back lets you change the height. http://imgur.com/a/ScW8h"

I was planning on using it for fishing and recreation, so I loaded it up with a fishfinder and everything. It's been great. I landed on that model because it's light enough for me to lift onto the roof of my car (around 45lbs), and it had the features I was looking for. I paid close to a grand for that online at Gander Mountain, but that includes $150 freight costs. A few days ago, I bought a second Old Town kayak; a Heron 9XT. That one is for my girlfriend, and we haven't had it out on the water yet, but it was on sale for 390 at Cabelas, is light (39lbs, even lighter than the Dirigo), has a decent set of features, and had generally good reviews. And that price is hard to beat for a brand new kayak. Based on your description, I'd say you can't go wrong with this one."
Kayaking,3biea7,PaddlePartner,4,Mon Jun 29 14:00:37 2015 UTC,I was following this with great anticipation. Then it released and the price was ridiculous and it only had like one waterway and it was no where near me. Now it has what 5? and they are still no where near me....  Maybe if you drop the price and let people create trips or trails so you can crowd source your data it would have some greater value.

Kayaking,3bgkpq,MmmmmCookieees,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:12:12 2015 UTC,You can always just list it on Craigslist. I see them on there regularly. Usually folks with paddle / skirt / pfd or what not list everything at once with an option for lower price if the buyer doesn't need everything (and you're willing to try to sell a skirt / paddle single). I'd list it together and then list your skirt size as well.   It seems folks that shop craigslist for boats are looking to get into the sport and aren't worried about having a perfect fitting skirt or the best paddle. They're looking for a good entry level price into kayaking.

Kayaking,3bd9ns,floobadedoo,3,Sun Jun 28 04:34:40 2015 UTC,"Deffo a sit on, if fishing is your main thing. Many sit on kayaks come with holes for fishing rods as well. Sit ins are designed more more long distance stuff, more choppy water (e.g the sea) and are more streamlined. A sit on kayak is easier to get in and out of and is also cheaper."
Kayaking,3bd9ns,antisocialoctopus,2,Sun Jun 28 07:53:43 2015 UTC,You could always go with a bit of hybrid with a Native Watercraft kayak. They're a bit of canoe and kayak in one.
Kayaking,3bd9ns,actuallyachick,2,Sun Jun 28 12:14:32 2015 UTC,"It seems I change my mind constantly between the two. I want to use the kayak for paddling a couple miles around the lake for fun but I also want to use it for fishing when I want. I see myself kayaking a lot during summer when it's hot, but I don't want to stop just because the weather gets cool. I currently have a Pelican Trailblazer 100 which is your standard very low end 10ft sit in. When I go to the lake with my friend who has a 12'  Wilderness Systems brand, I struggle to keep up just due to the fact that his boat cuts thru the water/waves nicely whereas mine kinda plows thru. I want stability for when I'm fishing, but also would like speed and decent tracking. I'm thinking something like the Jackson Kilroy/Tripper  might best fit me.  It's sit it, but it has a huge cockpit for gear/fishing stuff. I don't know if they make a spray skirt that big, but at least I could stay dry during the cooler months of the year. Thoughts?"
Kayaking,3bd9ns,POCKALEELEE,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"I know youve settled on the sit on top, my husband did as well for fishing. I have a sit in and we are modifying it with deeper rod holders, snaps for extra gear, better dashboard, etc.. if you're into DIY and you were learning toward a sit in, thats always an option."
Kayaking,3bd9ns,homewreker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on when and where you plan to go. We do a lot of winter kayaking, in fact the first day we ever went was Christmas. Sit-in is the best option if you do all-season IMO."
Kayaking,3bd9ns,stuihe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:47:35 2015 UTC,Look at a wilderness systems commander 120. It is both a sit in and on top kayak. I have had mine for a year now.  I've done both and carried 2 boxers with me.
Kayaking,3bd9ns,Odditea,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"This will probably echo what has already been said, but I recently bought a sit-in, after owning a sit-on for the last few years.  The sit-in feels more like what I expected a kayak to be, faster, sleeker, more responsive, and a bit unstable.  Even though it's bigger (16.5' vs 14' for the sit-on), it's much easier to handle out of the water, I can throw it up on my shoulder whereas the sit-on pretty much has to be dragged everywhere.   The sit-on, which I bought for fishing and camping, works as a great stable platform for both of those.  I'm fairly certain setting the hook in my sit-in would flip me right over, but I can practically stand on the sit-on.  It takes more abuse, but is certainly not a great choice to get out and paddle a few miles of lake or river.  That said, I love em both."
Kayaking,3bd9ns,PaddleYakker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:05:50 2015 UTC,I have a Future Beach Trophy 126 (sit-in) it's not a very high end yak but its super stable for fishing and tracks very well. You definitely wont win any races but it also maneuvers very well. I am quite new to the kayaking world but as a first buy I am very pleased with it. I have been to a few demos and used a lot of sit on tops and loved the freedom you have with them and I was really drawn to he Natives which are a canoe kayak hybrid but a bit pricey. If you can do some research and find demo events in your area that in my opinion is the best way to see what you are comfortable with

Kayaking,3bdjq3,samsara_kayak,8,Sun Jun 28 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'd say it's borderline bad idea. What length is yours? I was looking online and it seems to me that it does not have thigh braces to lock you into your boat.   It does have the two airtight hatches, but in my opinion it's too short. Should be at least 14' at a minimum. It's also lacking other things a sea worthy boat needs. - perimeter lines, thigh braces, skeg, etc.   Skirts are a must in the ocean because any little bit of splashing or surf can flood your cockpit. Perimeter lines are a must in case you capsize. You need to be able to hold on to the boat from any point on the boat. Sparse bungees are not enough. A skeg will help you control the boat when winds and currents pick up. Lastly, thigh braces allow you to control your lean and edging, which is crucial when dealing with waves/surf.   There's a lot of other safety items that are a must when ocean paddling. Here are some.   Way to communicate (vhf radio) Flares of some sort Strobe light for PFD Bilge pump Sponge Paddle float A way to tow/be towed  I would recommend against it unless you know you'll be in a very sheltered bay or inlet that will not have waves and you are 100% certain the weather report is perfect all day. Still, I don't trust the ocean with weather reports. It can change in minutes and turn a beautiful paddle into a shitshow quick. So please be careful before making the decision to do it."

Kayaking,3bdjq3,Hygrocybe,3,Sun Jun 28 16:28:26 2015 UTC,I use an open sit on top kayak. I would never go saltwater with a sit inside.
Kayaking,3bdjq3,blackbutters,2,Sun Jun 28 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, weird. I feel cozy and safe in a sit in. I would be extremely nervous to do ocean stuff in a sit on top.  EDIT: Didn't realize you're OP. I googled your kayak and only saw sit ins, so disregard the spray skirt thing."
Kayaking,3bdjq3,Hygrocybe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:00:15 2015 UTC,Even on a sit on top I use foam pool noodles stuffed inside the sealed portion to ensure I can float long enough to get back to shore.
Kayaking,3bd70l,hotham,7,Sun Jun 28 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"A quick Google search suggests that the average speed of a touring kayak is between 2 and 4 MPH.   Let's say you're on the upper end of that. That's still 2.5 hours to and from work for a 10 mile trip. Realistically, you're on flat water and might be tired, so you'll be closer to the 2-3 MPH range. That puts you between 3.3 and 5 hours each way.  That same page suggests a racing kayaker may get up to 7MPH. That would still be about 1.5 hours, but it would be difficult to maintain that rate for that long, twice a day. Even so, this is the ideal case. Realistically you're going to take longer.  That seems like quite a workout, and certainly a long commute. If you're willing to put in the time, there's certainly no reason not to, but if you're looking to ditch the car, you might consider a bike."
Kayaking,3bd70l,VortexLine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:31:21 2015 UTC,"That was my worry. Maybe I will stick to the car and kayak in the morning before work. I will still give it a shot on my next day off, but will be prepared for the worst. Thank you for the warning."

Kayaking,3bd70l,TheLogDog,2,Sun Jun 28 03:05:46 2015 UTC,I mean that's what I'd do. Just to see not only time wise but just to see how you might be tired or any unknowns that you haven't thought about. Then if all goes well then go for it. I couldn't think of a better way to start my day haha.
Kayaking,3bd70l,samsara_kayak,2,Sun Jun 28 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think it would be awesome! Save gas money and stay in shape. I was more or less throwing the distance out there to see if it was completely unrealistic, as I have never kayaked any substantial distance, and for all I knew it could be an all-day affair. I'm going to take the kayak out on my days off this week and give it a shot I guess!"
Kayaking,3bd70l,ILitYourBabyOnFire,3,Sun Jun 28 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"20 miles a day is considerable distance to add to a full day of work. I'm not saying that you can't (all the power to you), but don't expect it to be a cakewalk."

Kayaking,3baxxq,G0PACKGO,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:26:24 2015 UTC,A 12 foot boat would probably be OK for checking out the mainland sea caves or paddling out to some of the closer in islands like Sand or Basswood. I wouldn't try anything more than that in a boat that size. Keep an eye on the weather and know how to do a roll or wet exit. Wetsuits are recommended.
Kayaking,3baxxq,G0PACKGO,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:52:07 2015 UTC,I am comfortable doing wet exits and wet re-entries
Kayaking,3baxxq,liquidswan,2,Sun Jun 28 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"You should give it a try. Here is where I would recommend putting in:   Little Sand Bay: It's a 3 mile crossing to Sand Island, nice sea caves on the point south of Justice Bay. Meyers Beach (Just off of 13 a little east of Cornucopia): Paddle east along the shore for about a mile and you'll get to the mainland sea caves.  Red Cliff Casino boat ramp: It's a little over a mile to get to Basswood island, there isn't much on Basswood but it short crossing and it is pretty protected."

Kayaking,3b9mgw,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:59:02 2015 UTC,"How do you like the remix XP? I want to get a pair for me and the girlfriend. She is tiny so even the 9 might feel like a bathtub.   I'm 6'1"", 175lbs. Not sure which is right for me."
Kayaking,3b9mgw,rocketmike,2,Sat Jun 27 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"I have the XP 10 and really like it. Thanks to my previously sedentary lifestyle, I'm 5'3"" and about 200lbs. It doesn't feel like too much boat but it's also comfortable for a day of goofing around. I'm still new to kayaking, so the drop down skeg helps keep me from spinning around as I work out the kinks in my paddling technique. I like that when I'm ready to do more in the way of whitewater, I can use it for that as well instead of slower rivers with some small class I - II here and there."
Kayaking,3b9mgw,antisocialoctopus,2,Sat Jun 27 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'8 and have the XP9. It's a very well made, versatile little boat. It's very stable and easy to paddle. I have 3 kayaks, the other two are touring kayaks. The XP9 is my go-to even on flat water just because it's easier to load onto my car, it's tough and difficult to damage, and it's certainly good enough to be enjoyable to paddle on lakes.  I don't have problems keeping up with my buddies in their 14ft touring kayaks on shorter trips. The skeg makes life easy, but I tend to leave it up for a workout and a more challenging paddle. It's great on rivers and remains forgiving and manageable on rapids. I wanted a boat that was good on rivers, but was more interested in safety than particularly challenging conditions. That's changing, and I'm more interested in trying my hand at some class 2 &amp;amp; 3 now. The boat makes me more confident. I like that I can mix it up and have lots of different paddling experiences now in the rivers and lakes around me.  I am interested in trying out the longer XP10. When I first bought the boat I was glad that I had gone for the smaller model, because it still felt large to me. I stacked the included hip pads and felt like I could use more to get a better fit (I'm a guy with slim guy hips and I'm about 175lbs). Now I wish my feet had a bit more room and that I had more storage. I think your girlfriend would likely be very comfortable in the XP9 as long as she takes the time to tailor the outfitting to her size and shape. You should go for the 10."
Kayaking,3b9mgw,clangerhammer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:23:44 2015 UTC,"I love it! There is no way to be disappointed by this boat. It tracks well with the skeg down and is super stable on white water. The outfitting is incredibly comfortable (as far as kayaks go). There's plenty of room for multi-day trips and the dry hatch actually stays dry! For 4 days I carried a roll top bag with sleeping bag, hammock, etc. up front, a cooler with 8-10 ""sodas"" right behind my seat, and a bunch of food in the dry hatch. I never once felt cramped or that I couldn't stretch out. I'd recommend the 10 for you and the 9 for her. I'm about 5'10""/170lbs and although roomy, the foot rests and knee pads adjust as tight as you need them to. I'd also recommend getting the higher back rest. It's great for when the river gets flat and you feel like kicking back a little."
Kayaking,3b9mgw,rocketmike,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"She's 5' tall, 105 lbs. Still think the 9 is fine?"
Kayaking,3b9mgw,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"The 9 should be fine. It'll be a little roomy, but with the included padding and adjustments you can make it won't be too big. I'm not much taller than her at 5'3"" and the XP10 works fine for me now that I have it all dialed in. LiquidLogic has some videos available about how to make the seat, thigh pads, and such slide about. It's all very easy."

Kayaking,3bc4qs,Rez_Judicata,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:41:39 2015 UTC,What size boats do you carry and do you use bow and stern ties? I just put the Yakima Whispbar system with those exact bowdown kayak holders and they seem held in solid without the bow or stern lines.
Kayaking,3bc4qs,253Disc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"I use my Sentra. I lay down pool noodles with a piece of PVC through the center for support. I put the boat on the noodles so it's not sitting directly on the roof.Then I hook my ratchet straps to the clothes hanger hooks and grab handles inside the car. Make sure the doors are open for this, throwing the strap over the door means you won't be able to open it lol.   Beware my method dents the roof of your car. I don't care about roof dents since my car is old and made of dents. This can be avoided if your vehicle has any sort of roof rack. Just lay down the pool noodles to keep your kayak separate from said rack.   The other issue is that the straps clamp down on the weather stripping. This is only an issue when it's pouring rain and the car is parked. It leaks water into the car. So I need to be sure to loosen the straps if I plan on letting it sit on my car in the rain. This takes the pressure off the weather stripping and lets it work as normal. Also remembering To strap it again is important. I forgot that this morning and said ""huh, the boat sure is wobbling a lot...OH CRAP!""   Cheap and effective. Pool noodles are cheap. So is PVC. Along with Harbor Freight ratchet straps. I use two. I've tested this up to 110 MPH and for hundreds of miles. Doesn't budge an inch."
Kayaking,3bc4qs,ILitYourBabyOnFire,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a bit scary to me. Those hanger and hand hooks are not made to be able to take the force your straps are going to be creating. If anything I would connect the straps to themselves on the inside of the vehicle. The straps can take a ton of weight, so I wouldn't think they will break. I know you'll probably say you've been doing this for years, I'm guessing the top of the door frames are providing enough friction to lessen the strain on the hanger hooks, but that rubber will get worn out in time and I wouldn't want to be behind you the day it finally decides to go."
Kayaking,3bc4qs,KayakHipster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:45:18 2015 UTC,Idk why I never thought of that. I'm dumb as shit. I'm going to go connect them to each other inside. Thanks!

Kayaking,3bc4qs,KayakHipster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"Any car with good mileage that has Thule or Yakima racks available.   Make sure that your boat is perfectly aligned with the long axis of the car (it's not slanted to the right or left) or else you'll murder your economy. Also ease off the gas a bit - on one trip, we found that the increase from 120 km/h to 130 km/h destroyed our mileage as much as 50-120 km/h did.   And buy real racks and don't use ratchet straps. Ratchet straps invite user error. Cam straps are a good middle ground of ""easy to tighten, not too easy to crush your boat""."

If your seat has a high back, they make pfd's with padding up top to allow you to comfortably sit back. If it doesn't, you can get anything else you want.   Make sure that when you put it on and adjust straps, pull the tops off of your shoulders. They should not go past your ears.

Kayaking,3b8jr2,waltzingmatildas,5,Fri Jun 26 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would spend the $$ on a used good rack. Especially if you have a sun/moon roof. I would not want to put any pressure on that. Alignment, messing with the seals, I think that would be more expensive than getting a good used rack.   The main brands everyone trusts are Thule, yakima, Malone, etc. you can check on their sites for what rack size you need, then check craigslist or ebay.  That's what I did and never had a problem with my roof or racks."
Kayaking,3b8jr2,KayakHipster,5,Fri Jun 26 21:20:28 2015 UTC,Get a rack
Kayaking,3b8jr2,Rosie1991,4,Fri Jun 26 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"If you can get a rack, do it, especially if you're trying to carry two. If that's not possible at least look for a good set of foam blocks and tie down straps.  Will save your top and your boats. Those brands are good ones..."
Kayaking,3b8jr2,latenightcaller,3,Fri Jun 26 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"No. Don't endanger others on the road, get a rack. It's an investment that will last for years and usually can be transferred between vehicles."
Kayaking,3b8jr2,hypothesize_this,2,Sat Jun 27 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"Probably not the most popular opinion but I do it all the time. I have a Subaru with a roof rack and strap 2-3 kayaks up almost every weekend. I've ordered a kayak rack and will start using it but so far I've had no trouble. Just make sure you use lots of straps and do it well. Each kayak gets at least 3 straps, they all get strapped to each other, and the whole package gets locked down on all four sides. Don't over stress the plastic and be careful not to scratch your vehicle."
Kayaking,3b8jr2,dalton05,3,Sat Jun 27 02:54:39 2015 UTC,"Ive seen pool noodles used. Both placed across the roof, from driver side to passenger side.

And a strap around both kayaks. Holding them together."

I am not sure what the size range of ""another person"" to a small dog includes.  I find it kind of odd you chose to review the Angler variant, and barely mentioned its fishing capabilities. Otherwise, it was a helpful review. I've had an eye on the Pungo for a couple years now, but the price has been holding me back.  What is your opinion on the Ultralite? It was discontinued for a while, and appears to be back again. Between the dog, gear, and myself, we should be pushing 250lbs, so the reduced weight could be worth the price. However, I am not sure how well the slick plastic will hold up against the dogs claws."

There are some places that have a preferred carrier that gives them a discount. Some of those carriers have a local pickup point. That might get you to pay half the freight and/or drive half the distance. Aside from that, you could start by being nice about asking them to help/cover the freight and if you want to, you can escalate to the typical-dumb-fat-american move of raising cane until you get your way, but I don't like doing that."

Kayaking,3b2cwc,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, similar to how to get your crossbars to stop making sounds. You can spend 60-80$ on fancy wind fairing, or $2 on some paracord and twist it around the crossbars. Same thing.   The problem comes with airflow over symmetrical objects. By disturbing the flow in an erratic way, it can't find its point of resonance. It's just random airflow and therefore stays quiet. With straps, it finds ways to pick up the strap and have it vibrate. The twist makes sure that doesn't happen. I find it fascinating even though it's such a dumb thing."
Kayaking,3b2cwc,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:28:31 2015 UTC,Ohhh...the paracord on the cross bar is a new one to me. Thanks.
Kayaking,3b2cwc,nittanyvalley,2,Thu Jun 25 14:52:49 2015 UTC,"No problem. Just wrap it around from end to end, maybe going around the bar 4-6 times in the length of the bar. I used a pretty thin black one that's not really noticeable.   http://pursuitofexploration.com/2014/08/28/how-to-silence-the-howl-of-the-roof-rack/  If I don't use it, I'll get different notes from my naked crossbars at different speeds."
Kayaking,3b2cwc,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:53:39 2015 UTC,I just use duct tape to cover the holes/grooves in the cross bars. Sealing up the holes and such keeps them from howling.

Kayaking,3b2cwc,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:51:48 2015 UTC,Interesting. I guess the bar is just vibrating back and forth. I have not experienced this particular issue with any of my racks. I will keep that in mind down the road.
Kayaking,3b2cwc,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:54:00 2015 UTC,Exactly the case. I think that particular thing happens with circular/tube racks. That's why Thule came out with their aerodynamic ones that are supposed to be much quieter (but more expensive...)

Kayaking,3azh6x,Ilikesport,3,Wed Jun 24 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that kayak would sink if you tried to sink it as long as you don't fill it with rocks.  You can get a sprayskirt and flotation (you might want to think about floatation) for it, but I don't think it's necessary on flat water (lake).  I carry a big sponge to use as a bail, another paddler uses a plastic mug, and I've seen plastic bottles with the bottom cut out.  At first just take it out in waste deep water until you get used to it, even swamp it a couple of times so you know how it will behave when you do go over.  Most recommend a helmet and a good PFD, I don't always wear my helmet, but I always wear my PFD.  Now get out there and play.     edit: you might want to look around for a local paddling group, like http://www.americancanoe.org/, to hook up with until you feel comfortable."
Kayaking,3azh6x,OldButStillFat,3,Wed Jun 24 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"Great advice here. I'd re-iterate - always wear your pfd, and when the water is warm enough, try flipping over, getting it empty, and get back in. Do it in a safe place, make sure there's no rocks or anything you can get hurt with. Once you get that down a couple of times, practice pushing it to its edge as far as you can without tipping. I remember when I got my first rec boat I took it to my parents' house (they have a small pool) and I spent the day turning it over and testing how far I could edge it. Next time I went out I felt a lot more comfortable paddling since I could tell how far I could lean.   Just have fun and enjoy the water!"
Kayaking,3azh6x,KayakHipster,2,Thu Jun 25 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"Best piece of advice I can give you is to google for a nearby paddling club and join it, they should teach you everything you'll need to know, plus boating with others is safer/more fun!  Also you won't need to be able to roll to go out and enjoy yourself safely.  In a sheltered spot, with a mate on hand, deliberately go upside down and practice exiting (you will pretty much fall out). First without, then with a spraydeck.  I haven't ever paddled the kayak you have, and it looks like a pain to roll (because of the largish flatish top) but I am sure it is possible, but learning this alone will be hard. If you are with others who know how to deep water rescue, or are always within easy swimming distance from the shore rolling won't be necessary, but learning to roll for me was great for confidence on moving water.  In terms of sinking if you keep the cover securely on your storage hatch at the rear that should provide more than enough buoyancy to keep your boat afloat when swamped.  Hope that helps, join a club and paddle with others, you won't regret it!"

The hatch is not a bulkhead. It just allows for easier access to the stern.

This video demonstrates how to use a paddle float:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hkj2S4yxoQI I recommend that you keep the chambers partially inflated, tether the float to your kayak, and keep it stuffed in a spot that's easy to access.

He'll need to sit in it and test it.   You'll need to decide what type of water you'll be paddling. Coastal, white water, lakes, etc. there's different kayaks for each.   Lastly, look into paddling clubs near you, and go for a paddle. Or check on meetup. The point is, if you do it with people who know what they're doing first, you'll be safer out on the water later on. And you'll get to try stuff out to see what type of paddling you'd like to do.

I've been taking a larger trash bag now, but even then it fills up quicker than I'd like, plus I'm keeping it in the kayak, which is a little gross.   I'd love to find a solution for keeping it floating behind the boat without becoming waterlogged or sinking. Or too cumbersome.  Keep up the good work! High five!"

Kayaking,3au0uk,JohnPublic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:22:32 2015 UTC,Cans float and don't break into sharp shards that cut people. And they are much lighter. Way better option than glass.
Kayaking,3au0uk,nittanyvalley,2,Wed Jun 24 02:52:43 2015 UTC,"Regardless of being responsible or not, this is a good point. If you're going camping with your boat, you want the lightest gear possible. I would estimate that a 6 pack of cans will be lighter than 6pack of bottles since you're doing away with the glass. So with this entire ""responsible people don't break glass"" conversation aside, it would be beneficial to take less weight on the boat with cans.   Added to that is what others have said. You can break down cans to take out in bags (lighter and smaller) and lastly the possibility of broken glass is gone. So even if breaking the glass is not considered, the weight factor alone would help in choosing cans - at least for me. If I'm taking a super light sleeping bag, I want beer in the lightest container as well."

Kayaking,3au0uk,nittanyvalley,2,Wed Jun 24 04:10:23 2015 UTC,Hey!  So the put in was at the US190 bridge in Kempner Texas. We got out at Gravel Crossing boat ramp in Harker Heights. That was the 41mi trip. After rain you can do 190 to 2657 bridge in Oakalla for a solid 15mi day trip.   Unfortunately a lot of this portion the river is fairly low most of the year so it's only runnable after rain. Which hasn't exactly been abundant till recently.   All of our day 2 route was the most fun I've ever had kayaking though. Unfortunately those bridges in Killeen don't have really good take outs or put ins. I don't know how local you are to the area but PM me and I'll send you the .fit file from my Garmin or my strava post.  As far as I know there are no shuttle servIces and we had a drop off and pick up.

That's one of the problems with rudders. Paddlers become dependent on them and then have a harder time controlling their boats. It's usually easier to learn to paddle without them, and then use them only when needed.   Anyway, Ken Whitin has great videos on kayak control. Here's his video on sweep strokes.   http://youtu.be/1ebSOACHIyo  If you look at their channel, you'll find lots of other maneuvers for boat control. Bow rudders, stern rudders, hang draws, edging, etc. All of those strokes will give you an arsenal so you can pick and choose depending on the situation, as well as ways to link them for more efficiency."

Finally just hired a friend to weld up a proper rack on there.  LOVE my trailer. I use it even with just one boat rather than load it on the roof.
Kayaking,3aq7it,NotRoryWilliams,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:15 2015 UTC,Bold carrying on those canoes!  I like it.  How's the wind noise like that?
Kayaking,3aq7it,barnacle_schlong,2,Mon Jun 22 22:47:46 2015 UTC,Somewhere between a pissed off yeti and a stuck pig I would imagine...
Kayaking,3aq7it,nvertedflyer,2,Mon Jun 22 23:05:11 2015 UTC,They travel so nice. They are quiet at 60 mph and don't move at all. They are independently strapped with a tie down looped through both bows and stearns.
Kayaking,3aqxmq,c0r3yz,3,Mon Jun 22 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"It's so nice out there!  Here's a timelapse video of mine. Started out at Wekiva Springs, paddled to Rock Springs and back in a day. Battery died just as I turned around for the way back from the bridge that you can't paddle beyond.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_INQaVdsg24"
Kayaking,3aqxmq,PageFault,2,Mon Jun 22 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"Thats a hell of a haul in one day, i would love to do the same. Whats the cost at Wekiva springs? Is it just the cost to enter the park? How long did it take you?  I ran video on my gopro, gotta edit it and get it put up."
Kayaking,3aqxmq,PageFault,2,Mon Jun 22 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think it was like $4-6 bucks per car and that's it.  Yea, it was about 8 hours constant paddling. With 18+ miles, that puts me at about 2 mph. average.  It's a recreational kayak, and I'm not exactly an athlete, so I was quite sore by the end.  Gotta plug my Contour Roam here. The low profile helps keep hanging branches from bumping it."
Kayaking,3aqxmq,nvertedflyer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:13:17 2015 UTC,That looks like fun.  I've been looking for more places to try out locally (I'm in St Cloud).  Thanks for posting!
Kayaking,3arphk,doplebanger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"Love it! I dig the backwards surf with the high brace, followed by the backwards into the breaking wave (around 1:05) that reverses you into a forward side-surf and a tumble, all with a little mini-guitar solo. Good fun!    Looks like that whole Washington/BC area has some fantastic water to choose from.  What's the white disc you have on the foredeck? Alternate camera mount? I couldn't make it out and kept getting fixated on it :)  Oh, and do you find that the strong rocker on the rear of the Greenland T has any impact on surfing?"
Kayaking,3arphk,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"I wish the rocker was more. I'm actually trying to sell this boat so I can buy a progression, which is more oriented toward aggressive surf play.   The clips are also not in any particular order, chronologically, btw.  The white thing is the outlet for my automated bulge pump."
Kayaking,3arphk,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"I wasn't familiar with the progression, but that looks like a seriously playful boat for a long boat. The kind of boat you can really push limits in. Hope you get one!  hrm...automated bilge pump. Such a tempting idea when doing reentry and rolls! Find it effective? Quick enough to clear out enough water while in rough conditions to improve stability?"
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"It's mostly useful for if you're in open water and can't reach shore to empty your boat. In the video I'm doing a cowboy entry in the surf for practice and I didn't need to use it. I would only need it if I were a mile or so out and couldn't lift my boat as I did in the video (perhaps if it were full of touring gear). It is however a fun project that paddlers like to do, and it adds cool factor to any boat."
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:36:26 2015 UTC,Does it work with a battery? I've seen some with hand cranks and foot pumps as well. how much weight do you think it adds to the boat?
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 23 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it uses a lead acid battery that weighs 3 lbs. The whole thing together probably adds about 5 lbs. of weight.  Here is the build album from last year."
Kayaking,3arphk,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"Excellent video. Really enjoyed it. When you switch paddles, is that a storm paddle or your friends'? The white Gearlab paddle looks super slick.   Great job surfing backwards. It's something I def want to try but I'm not comfortable yet for it. And when you came up on your front deck, what roll did you do? Reverse sweep or storm? You can't see what you're doing underwater."
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"The forward finishing roll is a storm roll.   They are both normal paddles but the wood one is actually my spare. I was surfing at the beginning of the weekend and I got pitch poled on a huge wave (like 10') and while I was under getting thrown around, my paddle just came apart in my hands. So with the gearlab broken I used my spare for the remainder of the trip.  Edit: also, thanks, and the back surfing is fun but as you can see you can get pitch poled pretty easily. I ended up once (off camera) having my stern hit the beach and jolt me before rolling me over end over end."
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:04:05 2015 UTC,"No way, is the gearlab paddle done? Can they fix it for you?  Yeah, I don't think I need to worry too much about end over end yet since the waves I've been playing in are a bit smaller. The coast I have nearby usually has smaller waves, so a group of us are starting to make the drive an hour away once or twice a month to play in bigger stuff.   Were you using the default GoPro mount?"
Kayaking,3arphk,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"I was using the default mount. I bought some surf mounts but they were too large and flat and there was nowhere to put them on my deck, so this was all filmed using the normal curved mounts.  And Gearlab is actually going to be replacing my paddle free of charge."
Kayaking,3arphk,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Go GearLab. That is solid customer support. I keep thinking about carbon GPs (I have friends with various including a few GearLabs) and I like them, but never like them as much as the Western Red Cedar ones. I'd definitely be looking at GearLabs if I did though.  Curious about the break: where did it fail? Joint, shoulder, loom or blade?  10' wave is some pretty serious stuff! I would guess the biggest surf wave I've dealt with has been maybe 5-6', but not often. I suppose if it was in front of me (or behind me) I'd just treat it like any other and try to surf it or roll past it."
Kayaking,3arphk,meohmy13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"The paddle broke right at the shoulder, which is pretty odd. It didn't even hit anything, It just broke in the turbulent water. But yeah, I'm really lucky that they're replacing it hassle free."
Kayaking,3aseyu,2wutthebleep2,4,Tue Jun 23 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"No way.  $300-$450 range, depending on the paddle and PFD."
Kayaking,3aseyu,nittanyvalley,3,Tue Jun 23 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I just sold my WS Zephyr 155 for 800ish, it was 2 years old and in great shape - and it is a lot more boat than a used pungo."
Kayaking,3aseyu,KayakHipster,3,Tue Jun 23 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"My friend just picked up a Pungo 140 off craigslist.  http://imgur.com/QtbXeD0  (Middle Kayak)  He paid $350 for the Kayak, a life jacket, and two paddles, one of which is fiberglass  So no, definitely not worth it.  For $700, you should be able to find a much newer or nicer kayak on craigslist."
Kayaking,3as3ou,bluez4u,2,Tue Jun 23 01:44:05 2015 UTC,Check out http://www.intransit.tv/trips/#/mississippi-river/  Its a nice YouTube documentary series of a couple brothers that canoed it a while back. Also there's this guy who did it on a SUP: http://www.davecornthwaite.com/sup/4579327515  Wouldn't say its dangerous...just do your homework on the section you're thinking and know if there are locks you have to go through and where to camp along the way. Also watch out for barges and stay out of the shipping lane. I probably would avoid swimming in it too.
Kayaking,3as3ou,BigMoose318,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:12:56 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the info!
Kayaking,3ar8sk,hotham,3,Mon Jun 22 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yes.   I went from being skinny and hating sports to less-skinny and an athlete to not-skinny and uh, ""generally athletic"" when I stopped actually racing.   If you want a better workout in your boat:   Learn to paddle like a sprinter. Hands up, long reach, big rotation, big leg drive. Paddle in front of you, not behind.  Do intervals and race. And time controls.  Resistors.  Go lift so you get better on the water. Mark DeJonge isn't built like a freight train just because he paddles his boat, but because he crushes it in the gym too."
Kayaking,3ar8sk,moosekayak,2,Tue Jun 23 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have too much time to be on the water with classes, work, hiking on weekends so what I do is take my sea kayak here to the bay and do a few miles for an hour with good pace while working on torso rotation to get a good workout. I also sweat like a pig so have a hat and enough water."
Kayaking,3ar8sk,gzoztra,2,Mon Jun 22 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"I try to go out 2-3x a week for ~40 min.  Some days I do a steady state of intensity the whole time, some days I do intervals...mostly whatever I feel like since I'm not training for a specific event, just trying to get a workout.  I've lost 20 lbs over the last 18 months but I have to say that eating right is probably a bigger part of it for me.  But exercise is important, and the simple truth is I like paddling and I am way more motivated to get up at 5:30am in the warm months to paddle than I am to go running or to a gym or whatever even if though I can sleep an hour longer.  The exercise that you want to do is worth far more than the exercise you have to force yourself to do."
Kayaking,3ar8sk,meohmy13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"Many people do use kayaking for a good workout. It is one sport that can activate most of the body in a single workout. If done properly, you should get a good cardiovascular workout, while working your upper body, core, and legs. Many people do not perform their paddle-stroke in a way that engages their legs, but you can certainly get a leg workout when done correctly.   I do not have any specific stories of people using a kayak to get in shape, aside from meeting the weight capacity of my kayak being motivation for me to get into better shape. I am really looking forward to using my kayak to get a good workout though."
Kayaking,3ar8sk,WheelsAndGears,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I wouldn't use it as your primary means of fitness.  I have to say as a whitewater boater, you can be out of shape and still get down the river. A few extra pounds isn't going to make it so much more difficult because the water is doing a lot of the work. It's all about using the river to your advantage.  However, for a cyclist or runner, a few extra pounds makes a ton of difference."
Kayaking,3ar8sk,nittanyvalley,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:15 2015 UTC,"Naw, I'd disagree. For performance paddling, power to weight ratio makes all the difference. Skinny light paddler like me can literally skip down a river, snapping into eddies or flying over holes. My heavier friends more have to rely on muscling through or taking the beatings when they come. I'm almost always first off the start line too!  But yeah, whitewater boating isn't great as your sole workout. If you want to be good, make it your main sport -- but supplement it with gym sessions and/or another complementary sport."
Kayaking,3arvss,pizzapede,2,Tue Jun 23 00:33:22 2015 UTC,See if you can demo some at a local shop. Most of the ones here will let you take a couple out or arrange for you to try them first. See what you like and then look for something used that's the same or similar.
Kayaking,3arvss,antisocialoctopus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:16:51 2015 UTC,"That's pretty good advice. Not sure I'd want to take one out off the floor though, having never done it before I wouldn't want to accidentally damage it."
Kayaking,3arvss,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"Here, they pull out the used ones that are similar to the new you're looking at. Aside from scratching it up while you put it into the water, there's not a lot you can do to damage one, unless you're getting pretty crazy with crashing into things. Even if you just try some used, you can get a feel for what you like as far as length, model / brand, and type."
Kayaking,3arvss,GenerouslyLachrymose,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:35:41 2015 UTC,"You might try a rental place to find out what you like.  There's one store near where I live that has a pond next to it, so they let you try out kayaks right there before you buy."

Kayaking,3ao4xb,verdantwords,4,Mon Jun 22 05:17:23 2015 UTC,I've never heard of crab houses before. Care to share of his or your experiences there? The purpose is strictly for crabbing?
Kayaking,3ao4xb,TheNomadicOne,4,Mon Jun 22 05:40:43 2015 UTC,My grandfather used these houses to bring his crab pots to be processed. There's a bunch of vats where the crabs chilled until they peeled. He'd then pack em up and drive em up to Ocean City Maryland and other restaurants to be sold. It's good place to park your boat too.
Kayaking,3ao4xb,fullcircle_bflo,3,Mon Jun 22 15:04:46 2015 UTC,So these are abandoned/not in use? Or did he sell them?
Kayaking,3ao4xb,memory_limit,3,Mon Jun 22 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"We inherited them after he passed away, and we sold them to another waterman that's using it for crabs."

Kayaking,3ao4xb,monsda,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:46:58 2015 UTC,Dad said he'll give me a crab pot if I wanted to try it. I've never done it before. I went out clamming in the kayak yesterday which is a lotta fun.
Kayaking,3ao4xb,Iskandar11,3,Mon Jun 22 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'd go out, drop the pot.. yak around check it on your way back in. It's the best sort of lazy fishing."
Kayaking,3apyui,MrMatthewJ,2,Mon Jun 22 15:44:14 2015 UTC,You might need some scupper plugs for the drain holes. Dick's Sports is having a sale on the Future Beach Fusion 124 for $179. I think the GF and I are going to take the plunge and get them. I figure if we really don't like them we can probably sell them without much loss.
Kayaking,3apyui,JJHunter88,2,Mon Jun 22 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on the plugs, I'll check those out. I'm not getting a lot of water in the boat from outside, and even if I did, shouldn't the bails be letting the water out at some point?"
Kayaking,3apyui,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"From the pics I see, there aren't any drain holes in that boat, just lowered indentations to maybe put a pump in to bail out the boat. I've read quite a few reviews of people complaining that it tends to fill with water due to that. It is a budget boat, so maybe getting wet is just something that comes with it for now. Did you look around for something used? You can get a good deal sometimes, if you're not happy with what you have keeping you wet."
Kayaking,3apyui,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"They're definitely bail holes. I got an email from their customer service saying it could be caused by weight (I'm out of shape, but not that much) or misformed molds. They don't look bad to me, but I'm looking into either getting it replaced, or switching to a different model."
Kayaking,3apyui,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"I think with a sit on top or surf ski you know you'll be usually sitting in water. I'm not sure how others deal with it to keep it to a minimum (I paddle a sit - in with a skirt) but anytime I do have water under/around my seat I use this sponge  NRS Boat Sponge One Color, One Size https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073VY1NQ/  It's a beast. You'd be surprised how much water it can hold on each squeeze. Maybe it can help?"
Kayaking,3apyui,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 22 16:08:45 2015 UTC,"I paid a few hundred for mine and the ones my dad/brothers rent at the lake never have this kind of water issue. They get some splash in, but I'm sitting in a constant pool of water. Just doesn't seem like that should be happening by design."
Kayaking,3apyui,dispatch00,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:12:38 2015 UTC,Interesting. What are their seats like? Any idea what the difference could be?  Another question. Do you have drip rings on your paddle?
Kayaking,3apyui,dispatch00,2,Mon Jun 22 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"They have fully padded seats, whereas mine is just the back. I was thinking about returning mine and getting the 12' model, which has a full seat. Maybe that could help.  Yes, but that doesn't seem to keep water from hitting my legs. It's a small amount of water though."

Kayaking,3arbut,IDaZzleZz,3,Mon Jun 22 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off, being from the UK means you're near some serious coastal water. Please do not go out on the sea without a group and/or guide. Kayakers from the U.S. Travel to the UK for the higher level training because we simply don't get a lot of the conditions you guys get.   Now, sea kayaks and recreational kayaks are built differently. You can use a sea kayak in lakes, but you can't use a recreational kayak out at sea. Sea kayaks have a lot of safety features that make them sea worthy, while rec boats are simply made for enjoying yourself on calm lake waters.   So to get started, I'd look into paddling clubs near you (there have to be a ton, kayaking and the UK go hand in hand...). You probably have a ton of BCU trained instructors in your area as well. Go with a group and see how you like it. They'll be able to show you safety on the water, teach you about gear and you'll get an idea if you want to do coastal or recreational paddling. Please don't go out alone!  Do you guys have meetup groups in the UK?"
Kayaking,3arbut,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 23 02:00:33 2015 UTC,I found a local water sports center that does a BCU 1 star coarse for beginners or even taster sessions and kayaking introduction courses that I'm going to look into before buying anything. As for meetups none that I was aware of but a quick but a quick google search led me to this website for London meetups Meetup Website
Kayaking,3arbut,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 23 17:14:16 2015 UTC,Both of those options are perfect. Let us know how it goes.
Kayaking,3arbut,Eloth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Whereabouts are you based in the UK? I just qualified as a BC Level 1 coach (small steps)... If you're anywhere near me I may be able to help you get set up, but I'm a whitewater boater myself so I don't know..."
Kayaking,3aqzns,IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIl,2,Mon Jun 22 20:18:57 2015 UTC,Foam bulkheads typically mean that the storage hatches are sealed off from the cockpit on the inside. This means that they provide both structural integrity and buoyancy in the case of a capsized boat.
Kayaking,3aqzns,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"Okay great! I was worried that, instead of plastic or some solid material, the company had used foam, leading me to think they wouldn't be waterproof."
Kayaking,3aqzns,nittanyvalley,2,Mon Jun 22 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"Foam bulkheads are usuall made with closed-cell or minicell foam that is cemented in place, and then sealed around the edges. It usually looks like this: http://www.dbeweb.com/kayak/images/finish_42.jpg"

There are 3 chutes through the dam, looking downriver, the right was sketchy, the left was passable but only off to the center side, and center was the safest buttttt you'd have to boof over a few branches/logs that clogged the front of it. And if you botch the boof, it's bad news."

Kayaking,3ao7p3,babelworshiper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off welcome to your new addiction. Once you're out on the water in a new boat, it's all over.   There's a lot of different types of kayaks depending on the paddling you want to do. White water, Coastal, fishing, recreational, etc. Each boat will have attributes that allow it to do those well, but usually do not cross over. So before buying anything, I'd recommend to find paddling groups near you first. It can be through meetup, local kayaking clubs, you can use the ACA website (americancanoe.org) and go and try some paddles with groups. See what type of paddling you want to do.   Usually people in groups will be very helpful and will give you tips on gear and such, and after a couple of group paddles under your belt you'll feel more comfortable looking into getting your own gear. Also, it might give you the chance to pick up some used gear from paddlers — that'll be the best way to get your $$'s worth. Kayakers change gear often and will often sell their boats along with other accessories so you could luck out and get a bunch of stuff all at once for a great price.   Let us know if you have any questions about it anytime.   Cheers"
Kayaking,3ao7p3,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:41:32 2015 UTC,"I would consider the kayak to be 50-60% of what you plan on spending. You have to consider paddles, pfds, dry bags, and a way to transport (roof rack) too."
Kayaking,3ao7p3,mwf86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and don't let it discourage you, it might be a little pricey but it doesn't mean you have to get everything new, there's lots of good deals out there on craiglist in your area!"
Kayaking,3ansn3,Myatariisbusted,2,Mon Jun 22 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"Just a quick stitch together of some fun and my slowly building surf-skills. Always fun heading out through the suff zone, then a quick ride, and finally getting the low brace better for side-surfing. Much room to grow, but getting there!  Plenty of good rolling as well, and probably 10 reentry & rolls in a row. I'd get up fine, but wasn't skirting up while underwater, so when edging/bracing the wave would flood the cockpit and sooner or later I'd be in a handy position to do another reentry and roll, lol :)  We also did The Dump for the first time today. OMG what a simple and effective technique!"
Kayaking,3ansn3,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"That looked like a ton of fun. Where was it? Also, what boat were you in? Looked like a WS? Loved the slo-mo. Just drop some bad-ass music behind it and you're set.   I was just talking about the dump with a friend on Saturday! Did the person staying upright hold your boat while you did it?"
Kayaking,3ansn3,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 22 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"This was at Democrat Point at the west end of Robert Moses State Park. That is my WS Tempest 170. No chines at the rear to hold the waves, but no chines anywhere so is playful on the waves. I need to work on keeping  it perpendicular to the waves longer though. But...that was only my 3rd time out surfing, so I'll get there eventually.  I was the assist on the dump today. Edged a bit towards the oncoming boat, and stabilized it a tad as he came up on my deck, but mostly just made sure he wasn't going to slip off my boat, edge away a bit to give his bow more height, and gentle assist using his deck lines to right him as he rolled. His cockpit was amazingly dry. Far better than I'd imagined it would be. He had his camera on for it, but I haven't seen the footage yet."
Kayaking,3ansn3,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:52:42 2015 UTC,"Well, for a 3rd time surfing that was great. And nicely done when you brace into that wave that takes you down sideways for a bit.   I've been wanting to try it as well. Have your friend post the footage when he edits it. I'd love to see someone other than the body boat blade people doing it since they're pros and they make everything look too easy..."
Kayaking,3ansn3,meohmy13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:19:55 2015 UTC,"Here is his video. We'll need to record it via a 3rd person to get a better sense of the flow of things. Maybe we'll get that done this weekend at the HRGF.  Those BBB folks are killers. They look more comfortable playing around in Deception Pass than I do in my bathtub!   It is interesting to do so much bracing with the GP. It really feels like a different beast in that environment. Not better or worse, just different. It lacks the raw power and immediate lift you can get from a WW or Euro paddle, but is super-forgiving and allows for all kinds of quick recoveries and alterations. I really haven't used my Euro in ages, but should start breaking it out to get a feel for it again."
Kayaking,3ansn3,doplebanger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:16:50 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I was finding the same thing in my last surf session, I used my GP since I broke my euro blade.   Yes, I can see what's happening in the vid but a 3rd person perspective would be much better. Unless you mount your camera far by the tip of your bow looking back at you. We'd be able to see your buddy come up and do his trick.   Thanks for posting!"
Kayaking,3ansn3,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"Having a camera on the fore-deck is the only thing that might give me pause as the person being rescued. Would need to make sure the camera either gets far enough past the rescuer, or stays far enough before them to avoid breaking the mount.  Hope to come back with some better perspective next week."
Kayaking,3ansn3,doplebanger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"I need to work on keeping it perpendicular to the waves longer though.     It's hard to assess from a short first person clip, but I don't like to be perpendicular to the wave any longer than it takes to get some momentum from the drop.  If it's clear which way the wave is going to break I often set up 15-30 degrees in that direction so that I don't drop as hard and end up burying the leading edge or pearling.  What you're  doing at a glance looks actually looks ok to me.  Based on the last wave you might need to anticipate and start paddling a little sooner, but you could have just been caught off guard.  You look really good for having just started surfing.  YMMV though...a lot...my surf boat is an old OK Yak Board and is the polar opposite of the Tempest in pretty much every possible way.    I'm not sure if you can do it in 17 footer but one of my favorite surf tricks is, right as you get to the crest of a wave like in the beginning of the clip, give it one good hard high angle stroke and really fling your hips forward like you're pole vaulting (a boof basically) and you can get a little (sometimes a lot) air off the top of the wave."

Kayaking,3aop3c,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:05:34 2015 UTC,Do you think that a Wilderness Systems Cape Lookout 155 might also be a good fit? There is one locally for $550.  There is also a 16' Perception Avatar for $650 in town but I'm thinking that would only work well for touring.
Kayaking,3aop3c,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah both of those are solid options!  Pretty decent deal on the Cape Lookout and the Perception Avatar. I'd definitely go with either of those. Good boats you can ""grow into"" as you get better at paddling. I wouldn't take either on anything more than class II."
Kayaking,3ao93d,Autumpossum,5,Mon Jun 22 03:37:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that's a great deal.   The pelican is made cheaply, out of cheap materials that'll allow you only to paddle slowly on small lakes and very slow moving water.   Dagger is a very well known highly praised brand, they use good materials (I don't know how well this boat you're showing is made) but I would venture to say it's going to be way way better quality than the pelican. Lastly, you can see this boat has a hatch. I would also guess it's probably water tight since dagger makes good products. The pelican does not have a hatch. It has a plastic dip with a plastic cover that lets you put in a tiny bit of gear there. If the pelican fills with water, it'll sink. If the dagger fills with water and that is indeed a hatch with a bulkhead, it'll continue floating. In my opinion, no contest.   Now, they're throwing in a drytop, wetsuit, paddle and other goodies? That's awesome.   I would just check to see if the size of the boat suits your body, and if you'd be able to wear those items. Would you be able to go check it out in person and decide?   Edit - the dagger is also a rec kayak that's suited for calmer lakes and such. But because of the rear hatch I would trust it a little more on the water than the pelican, so I would feel a little safer going to some places the pelican can't. However, please do so with groups until you have enough experience to paddle alone."
Kayaking,3ao93d,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 22 11:25:29 2015 UTC,"If you can, see what boat is more comfortable for you. Personal fit makes a big difference. After that, everything u/kayakhipster said is spot on."

Kayaking,3anaou,whitewaterv,3,Sun Jun 21 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'll slow you down. How big are your blades? If they're on the bigger side you might get a bit tired after a day of touring, but speed wise you'll be fine.   Also, what's the length of the paddle? Usually you can paddle high angle for most of the day while on a touring boat (if it's narrow enough) and be fine. Many sea kayakers will opt for smaller blades, sometimes thinner or even greenland paddles to make it easier on their bodies. But if you're paddling for just one day, I don't see a problem.   In my group they paddle greenland paddles, Cyprus/shuna sizes and ikelos sizes (within werner as reference) and the lengths range from 205 for smaller paddlers to 215 for taller ones with larger wingspan.   Edit - wanted to add - touring paddlers will often go to narrower paddles as well, such as the skagit, but in my group no one uses them. Mostly Cyprus or ikelos (which I believe are comparable in size to WW, is that right?), otherwise GP."
Kayaking,3anaou,KayakHipster,2,Sun Jun 21 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"It will work and there isnt going to be a ton of difference. The open water paddles are usually a little longer and lighter, with smaller blades. You might work slightly harder, but one day isnt going to make a big difference. There is a chance that one of the others might have a spare paddle to lend you though."
Kayaking,3anaou,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:34:00 2015 UTC,That's a great point about a spare paddle. Almost everyone in my group always have one.
Kayaking,3alys1,tone_hails,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"agreed. if it really is a pinhole, you could probably just heat it up and push it closed.

Kayaking,3alys1,CMBurns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:00:18 2015 UTC,Marinetex won't stick to a poly boat. Gflex will but from what you've said about where the hole is I think melting the plastic is your best bet.
Kayaking,3amynv,ToweringPineapples,2,Sun Jun 21 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"I think for conditions like that you'd want a sea-worthy kayak. If you want to go for a sit-in kayak, usually the minimum length would be around 14 ft, it should have two airtight hatches (front and back) so that if your boat is swamped with water, the hatches will remain airtight and keep the boat afloat. Lastly, it is also recommended to have perimeter deck lines, so if you go over in rough conditions, you always have a line to grab on to. This also goes for rescuing others, as well as having to tow/be towed.   I'll let others chime in with sit-on-top requirements for lakes of that size that can turn pretty ugly with the right conditions.   Lastly, if you give us your height and weight, maybe we can give you some possible brands/models to research and if you get the chance try out to see if you like them or if they fit."
Kayaking,3amynv,KayakHipster,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"14 foot is bare minimum for Great Lakes/Ocean Kayaking(bigger is better), Sit-in only (Do not take a sit on top out on the Great Lakes if you are a beginner), get a good comfortable PFD and wear it, as well as a good spray skirt. Have in or attached to the deck lines, a Paddle float, bilge pump, and bailing sponge. And use a paddle leash to secure you paddle to the boat. And have a spare paddle along, even a cheap 5 piece break down stowed in a hatch is good. Strobe light on your PFD and another on the boat will be a good idea as well.   And please practice on some smaller bodies of water before going out on any of the Great Lakes. You are right the can be ferocious and dangerous at a moments notice, one minute calm and smooth the next big white caps and high winds trying to flip you. And always, always wear a PFD on big water.   Other things that can be helpful are a VHF/Marine radio or an EPERB Beacon, flares and dye packs if you do get in trouble. And try to always go out with at least one other person/boat, preferably a group  Also always dress for the temp of the water not the air. It could be warm out but if you dump the water on the lakes can be very chilly. And Hypothermia is more likely to kill you (even with a 70 degree air temp) than direct drowning."
Kayaking,3amynv,Carpenterdon,2,Sun Jun 21 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Really good points. Question though since I'm not well versed in sit on tops. Are any of them able to take truly rough water? I know there's many types of surf SOT's and i always see people fishing from SOT's out in the ocean. I don't really know much about it though.   For me, I would chose a sit-in 17ish footer that is designed for rough water with a skeg. And of course the safety points you mentioned would be must haves."
Kayaking,3amynv,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 22 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"Sots are a whole different fish. I wouldn't use one for big water simply because of the open nature. In a regular sit in you have more protection and they are more stable due to lower center of gravity. That said, a lot of people seem to use them in big water especially for fishing as you mentioned. I'm a sit in guy myself so I may biased a bit. But I stand by my previous comment of no sit on top for Great Lakes. Warm southern ocean or Caribbean island kayaking maybe but not on the rough cold lakes."
Kayaking,3amynv,Carpenterdon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:08:35 2015 UTC,Makes sense to me. I also prefer that sit-ins will  move around in waves but not truly want to stay flat on the water's surface the way sit on tops have in my past experience. I'd rather have a tippy boat that I know the waves won't affect as much.
Kayaking,3amynv,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"If you are a first time kayaker I really suggest you don't go out in waves above 1-2 feet (just check NOAA nearshore forecast online). You are asking for a tiring and very dangerous trip if you do that. As for what kayak you should get, I'd go for a cheap sit-on-top just to get you're feet wet just too see if this is something you wanna do before dumping lots of money into it."
Kayaking,3ajosb,forty2skates,2,Sat Jun 20 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"This hull is actually way too advanced for the kid, but it was never intended to be used solo. I wanted it very sleek so that as an outrigger for my boat there wouldn't be a ton of drag, unfortunately my boat hasn't quite happened yet. I towed him around the lake behind a rowboat today for a mile and a half or so, if I wasn't looking right at him I'd have never known he was there. The boat really glides along nicely.  When the boy outgrowns this boat I'll build his first boat specifically made for him to solo. It'll be short, wide, and shallow. Thankfully that's a good 2-3 years away yet."

Kayaking,3agk3v,forgotcl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"i have no experience with this so take what i say with a grain of salt. When i got my used native ultimate 12.5 i was told that i could put another seat in it if i wanted. I mentioned that to at guy who works at (maybe owns?) a local kayak/canoe/water gear store and that i wouldn't mind having the option. He basically said that a 2 person kayak is a homewrecker.   reasons for this is that it takes a lot of coordination and communication. This would only be made more difficult in the ocean (or possibly a large lake if the wind is up or there's lots of waves from other boats). He also said it can lead to fights about one or the other not pulling their weight. When you're in the middle of a lake or out in the ocean and you start fighting, there's probably no one else around and an argument can get heated. you're out in the sun, it's hot, you're sweaty, and now you're mad and you just want to go home. well you've still got to paddle back, put the boat up, drive home, take the boat off, and you're still at least upset if not even more mad over some other argument that took place anywhere after the first.   If neither of you have kayaked before i'd say each get your own. you'll each come to understand how you have to maneuver the boat to get it to go in the direction you want. this is much more important for ocean kayaking. waves and currents can really take you around if you're not careful. should you take a wave the wrong way because you'd each decided differently how to handle it, it could end up with one or both of you in the water. while that's not something impossible and def something you should plan and exercise for, if you can avoid it you'll have a better time.   you don't have many lakes but it sounds like you're not so far from the ocean that a day trip would be fairly possible. I'd be that there's probably a kayak rental place or maybe even a guided tour that you and your wife could try."
Kayaking,3agk3v,Capt_BrickBeard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:37:58 2015 UTC,"Adding to this.   Yes, they call them divorce boats for a reason. But at the same time, commodity is also an issue. Tandem boats are long and heavy. They're hard to lift, maneuver and put on top of your car. Regular single kayaks can be heavy and sometimes need 2 people to deal with. So, dealing with a tandem's weight is a problem with your significant other.   Also, if either one of you ever want to go by yourselves, it's a pain in the ass to try to do so with a tandem.   Therefore, two single boats are usually more versatile. You can kayak together side by side all day. Or you can take it out alone anytime. And, they will be lighter and shorter boats to deal with as well as for storage."
Kayaking,3agk3v,KayakHipster,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:23:00 2015 UTC,thanks i appreciate it. we are 3 hours from the ocean. thinking about it there are plenty of lakes closer than that. but the ocean would definately be cool.. I think ill try renting some on the river first. thanks!
Kayaking,3agk3v,KayakHipster,2,Sat Jun 20 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"River boats, lake boats and ocean boats are all completely different. They're designed specifically for those environments. The cheapest one which most people use to test the sport and see if they want to do it is recreational boats, which are only suited for calm smaller lakes and very very slow rivers. For WW or ocean paddling, boats become more expensive and more defined. For either of those types of paddling, I would recommend finding a club near you that can offer some lessons/guiding/tours so you can test things out and see what you like best. That way when you decide it's time to get something for yourselves, you'll be safer on the water and will be happy with your decision."

On the one hand it was a $180 boat, so it's a relatively small loss if the thing starts cracking after 5 years instead of 6.  On the other hand, it's probably relatively low-grade thin plastic, so it could fail a lot sooner than you expect even from the relatively low exposure."

Don't get any equipment until you take some classes and see where you want to go. No point to get a recreational kayak for lakes if you might want a WW boat instead and vice versa.

Kayaking,3abzbo,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. Kayaking is a really broad range of activities. Everything from hucking huge waterfalls to fishing a quiet lake to surfing ocean waves can be done in a kayak. It's all good fun, but try things out before spending a bunch of money on gear if you can. Also if there's a class 2ish river near you, you could see if there's an outfitter that would take you out in inflatable kayaks, so you can try ww kayaking in a forgiving boat."
Kayaking,3abzbo,d542east,2,Fri Jun 19 04:36:42 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  Whitewater boater here. I would suggest holding off on the equipment for now, because what you'll need to find first is a club that does whitewater. They'll give you flatwater training, safety cover, and take you on all the trips you need to get started in WW. They'll also rent appropriate kit at a reasonable price -- and as a beginner, you probably won't really know what you're after, so club boats are a great option."

I've had them on two different cars.   I don't think you'd be able to fit two boats side by side with foam blocks on a corolla, so I think a rack system will be the way to go. I tried one of the $50-60 dollars one the day I bought our first boats and it almost wrecked my roof. That night I looked on eBay until I found a good cheap rack system. I thought the $$ was worth it to not have to fix my roof with a cheap rack.   Hope that helps!"
Kayaking,3a9x6f,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:12:48 2015 UTC,"I just got a new car and splurged on some carriers. I ended up going with rhino rack and am very pleased with everything. The roof rack alone was $320, then we bought two pairs of J style kayak carriers for $200. However, you could easily cut those prices in half if you bought off-brand on amazon. I will tell you that I used foam kayak carriers for the last few years on my cavalier and it worked well. I mean you have to spend a little longer on finding the right position, but it's doable for someone on a budget. Hell, you could just buy some pool noodles and ratchet straps and it would be the same thing.  Here's two of our setups: http://imgur.com/Zhl11Wc http://imgur.com/PUie7ll"

Kayaking,3a7l58,c0r3yz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"Just in case anyone else comes here looking for answers to my questions:   From the looks of it, Wekiva Springs State Park does rent. I'm not sure what their rates are compared to King's Landing. The only other real option is to start at Wekiva Springs State Park and paddle upstream.  There, you pay per car to enter the park and then it's game on.  This isn't a bad option, but the current is stong.  At King's Landing, you're starting upstream and riding the current down. Their tandem kayaks are a Jackson Kayak SOT.  I think they are an older Rivera model.  They're not bad, but they don't track particularly well.  Their single kayaks looked like the JK Rogue, but I didn't pay too much attention to them since we didn't get one. No littering, no alcohol.  With stops, we did the full run in just over 4 hours.  Bring lots of water and sun protection. While there is a lot of shade along the run, there's still enough sun to do some damage.  Also, get their early. During the summer months especially, Kelly Park fills up fast due to people packing into the spring head for swimming.  This causes a LOT of traffic on the way to King's Landing, which is further up the road, and also causes a lot more people to try King's Landing as an alternative to going home when they close Kelly Park.  We spent a lot of time waiting in lines trying to register our party and pay our fees.   I hope this helps someone else!"

Kayaking,3a6ec1,Juno_Malone,2,Wed Jun 17 16:15:55 2015 UTC,How much do you weigh?
Kayaking,3a6ec1,mralex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"5'8"", 150lb. Dog is another 60lb. Also, I guess I'm not strictly limited to 2-person inflatables. If there are 1-person models that could seat my dog and I comfortably, I'd consider those as well."
Kayaking,3a6ec1,mralex,2,Wed Jun 17 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"OK, my experience comes from being 6'4"" and 300 pounds... so translate as best you can.  I think the concern I would have at your weight is that a double, especially an inflatable, would float too high in the water, and be subject to the wind--the front end would get blown around very easily when you're in the back and the front is empty. I've had this problem myself.   It's more expensive, but the AE Advanced Frame Convertible gets around the problem by allowing you rig the single seat in the middle. Then you'd be at least balanced against the wind front and back.  Innova's Sunny lets you do the same thing, and is a great boat.  But since your ambition is just for some lazy floating, you could probably get by with either of the boats you've selected. Might suggest the AE over the SE--the SE you've listed looks like a variant of the Sevylor Tahiti K-79--my first inflatable. Fun for floating, but couldn't go in a straight line AT  ALL. Was basically a pool toy, though many people used them for all kinds of paddling for years."
Kayaking,3a6ec1,mwf86,2,Wed Jun 17 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"AE's single-action hand pump will be a little better than that Sea Eagle foot pump...  I was never really impressed with AE until I paddled the AirFusion Elite, which I really do like -- but the AFE has an aluminum rod to keep it stiff. I do feel like AE is the best inflatable brand, if that makes any difference to you."

Kayaking,3a6ec1,anon1515,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"I've never paddled the Lagoon 2 with or without the backbone so I can't give you a definitive answer -- I will say that the AFE aluminum rail goes from bow to stern and the one you sent seems to go most of the way, but not all the way. So I think you gotta try it out. Sorry for not being more helpful."
Kayaking,3a6ec1,miliasoofenheim,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the Lagoon 2 also, but does anyone have experience with the Advanced Elements AE1007-R AdvancedFrame Convertible Inflatable Kayak (http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Elements-AdvancedFrame-Convertible-Inflatable/dp/B000J2O5VE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435448095&sr=8-1&keywords=Advanced+Elements+AdvancedFrame+Convertible+Tandem+Inflatable+Kayak)?

Yeah that's one thing that seems to be pretty consistent among reviews is that the seat in the F&S is garbage and needs replacing immediately.

It's the last functioning lock in the historic canal system so they like to show it off.    But then...From Lock 60 down to Port Providence, the river is very shallow barely navigable, especially since we haven't had a lot of rain.  There are several spots where you are certain to run aground and have to get out and walk.  Since they camp at Lock 60 they could easily put into the river the following morning, but the canal is a probably just a better experience especially with several dozen boats in the water."

Kayaking,39zhzt,samsara_kayak,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:17:32 2015 UTC,I keep my tent and sleeping gear in a 40 liter dry bag.  Then just bring whatever you would take on an overnight hiking trip.  Also bring a chair because its nice to have somewhere to sit thats not the ground or a log.  Also a collapsible fishing rod is nice to pass the time once you make camp.

Most people start with something basic like that and then either upgrade in a couple years, or get out of the sport. Getting a better boat now will make your time on the water more enjoyable and you will be more likely to stick around.   The price for a boat, vest and paddle isn't bad though. Especially if everything is in good shape."

However, I don't consider this a great deal simply because you'll likely not use it long. Either you'll love kayaking but instantly realize that everyone else is having more fun in their more expensive kayaks, or you'll get bored with kayaking it because it's not very fast or particularly interesting to paddle.  It's like buying a tennis racket from Target or...very similar to buying a $100 bicycle. Sure you'll get some fun out of it, but you're unlikely to get serious about cycling on a cheap bike, so you'll either never get into bikes or you'll get something a little better before you really start to develop the ""addiction"" that establishes the hobby. Does that make sense?  That's why so many folks recommend renting...or buying second hand. You can spend the same amount of money on a better experience."

Kayaking,39x3pt,wishiwasclevererer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:40:09 2015 UTC,Do you have space in your boat to take it in it/on it rather than in the water? Dragging a 100L drybag behind you will be like paddling with an anchor. I don't think you'll have a good time paddling with that kind of drag behind you.
Kayaking,39x3pt,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, ihave some space, but it is limited, and clearly not enough to store a tent, couple of duffle bags, food waters etc for a 2 day trip"
Kayaking,39x3pt,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 15 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Man, if you're thinking of putting water for 2 days, plus equipment, that'll be super heavy. I'd say see if you can use a different boat that can take that equipment on/in it. Have you ever tried towing another person behind you in the water? I would think after 5 minutes trying to pull that bag through the water you'll stop and try to come up with a better way. I just think it's too much to pull.   I'll let others chime in."
Kayaking,39x3pt,moosekayak,2,Mon Jun 15 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're set on towing stuff, maybe put the dry bag in a cadet sized kayak it'd be okay but still... bringing less stuff sounds like the optimal plan."

Kayaking,39x3pt,nojoy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"Dragging gear behind your boat is so so so dumb. At a minimum, it will slow you down significantly. On moving water, it's very, very dangerous. Also, in my experience, all dry bags leak a little bit.  Learn how to pack your kayak out for camping. That might involve getting some other gear (specifically gear for backpacking), or a different kayak, but that is better than having a 100L bag with gear drag your kayak under and put you at risk for drowning."
Kayaking,39x3pt,samsara_kayak,0,Wed Jun 17 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"A 30L or 40L will prob suffice for a weekend. I usually place hammock, bag, stuff I don't need until setting up camp, in a 30 and stuff in the bow past my feet. The usual day trip stuff goes in smaller dry bags in my stern storage. Dragging anything behind you is  a bad idea for a variety of reasons but mainly there's not enough buoyancy to keep a bag up while you are in motion."

If you're taking this out to sea (or doing anything serious with it, really), buy some airbags and stick them in the back. Floatation is a must."
Kayaking,39tsvz,Eloth,2,Sun Jun 14 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah around 4m long.  I have added foam inside since the last photos, will test it and see if she sinks when upside down before i go anywhere."
Kayaking,39tsvz,My_Empty_Wallet,2,Sun Jun 14 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"Can't identify the precise model -- there are lots of near-identical boats (all WW boats pretty much looked like that until the 1970s). Most common was the comanche, but it's not one of those. At that point, it wasn't rare for kayakers or clubs to have their own moulds and make all their own boats, so it might be one of them, I guess. It's a nice looking boat, and in pretty great condition.  What kind of foam have you used? Ideally you'll be wanting micro or minicell foam, but yeah, foam should work as floatation."

Kayaking,39tsvz,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:28:51 2015 UTC,"Looks good. One thing to mention about those small compasses - check with other compasses with and without the gopro mounted. The gopro being so close to the compasses might throw them off.   That's one of two reasons why on sea kayaks the compass is always mounted far towards the bow. You gotta remember not to put anything under it that will interfere, and in some cases it could cause  you to get sick while looking down in rougher water/bigger seas. (I've never experienced that but I've been told and read that's the case - the straighter out you look, the better for not getting sick)"
Kayaking,39tsvz,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:07:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I checked today and it seems fine with the gopro next to it. but will test it out in the water with another compass to check all is working as it should.

For camping and such, get a real and trustworthy touring boat that'll have airtight hatches for you to put your gear away, as well as to help you continue growing your skills.   At your height at weight I'd say you'll need the higher volume versions of touring boats. We can give you a list of boats we like, but you'll def need to try to have some demo days and sit/test several boats. For that budget, make sure to get something that fits you like a glove and will do exactly what you want it to do. are you interested in plastic or glass?"

Kayaking,39v91p,moscomule,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"I usually associate good flexibility with the sweep, and more brute strength with the C to C. A good roll to me is one that gets you upright without the chance of injury.   Both of those rolls, although they share several concepts, the body is doing very different things. Sometimes one clicks easier than the other. Nothing wrong with that.   It's also easier to learn other rolls when you have one of them nailed down on both sides. That way you're not worried about messing a new one up. You know you'll be up with your backup every time.   Keep practicing!  One last thing to mention - the sweep is usually more used by sea kayakers since we (usually) have less danger of rocks around us. (Unless you're rock gardening...) so if you're going to be doing WW, work on that C to C so you can get used to not having to throw your head around."

Kayaking,39v91p,Eloth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:56:21 2015 UTC,Other way round. C2C is less useful and more dangerous.
Kayaking,39v91p,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"Man, I could swear I've had arguments defending the sweep roll to WW paddlers. They kept saying laying back on the back deck was dangerous since you're essentially coming around and putting your head in danger.   In my opinion it's the quickest and strongest roll that I've successfully learned.   Edit - is it that I'm referring to the layback roll as a sweep and you guys mean short sweep without laying back?"
Kayaking,39v91p,nittanyvalley,2,Mon Jun 15 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're talking about a back deck roll, which is still used pretty frequently in whitewater (if you can hit it consistently and quickly, it's not a bad option because you're up super quick).  Sweep roll is basically a more fluid progression than C-to-C. Instead of a two step catch, you basically combine it into one fluid sweep motion and hip snap. There isn't a whole lot of difference between the two, but the small differences make the sweep more preferable, though sometimes C-to-C is easier to learn/teach at first. Either way, on both rolls you should be coming up in a position ready to take your next stroke, and not spending too much time (if any) on the back deck. This is not because you are exposed, it's because it doesn't provide good stability and it's not a good ready position.  This video does a good job of explaining the differences. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TcmtLMjsyzo"
Kayaking,39v91p,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"No, right, I think the confusion here is that even if I don't lay back, I still consider a sweep the same as a layback roll - since the motion is the same, you just either end laying back or sitting upright because you've already gotten yourself out before your body makes it to the back deck.   When we teach it, we push for people to lay back all the way to get the motion engrained. However, as they progress, the sweep is so strong that by the time the body is upright you're already out of the water and ready for the next stroke.   I'm not a fan of the c to c as is just because I don't see a reason to waste that motion going from setup to the perpendicular position of the paddle. In the time it takes to get that motion down, if you sweep the blade you're already out of the water..."

I'll have to check out your section sometime. Right now my girlfriend doesn't have a kayak yet so we have to rent one.
Kayaking,39qi38,wobblingwheeb,2,Sun Jun 14 11:42:16 2015 UTC,Heading down to the susquehanna in about 30 minutes. Love living a half mile from the river.

Kayaking,39qi38,52Hz_Whale,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:03:37 2015 UTC,Cool! There were lots of folks on the river yesterday. I went from ChesLen down to Shaw's Bridge myself.

Kayaking,39r96j,gombessaa,2,Sat Jun 13 23:49:21 2015 UTC,"The Tarpon is significantly better than the Eagle Talon (hence the price difference) and shouldn't have any issues keeping up...  Having said that, I personally prefer the Ride 115 and 135 to the Tarpon 120, especially for fishing."
Kayaking,39r96j,HindleMcCrindleberry,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:06:11 2015 UTC,What do you like better about the ride? Does the 115 still track straight/quick enough to keep up being a bit shorter and a few inches wider?
Kayaking,39r96j,HindleMcCrindleberry,2,Sun Jun 14 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"First of all, the Tarpon is a fantastic kayak and it's slightly faster and will track slightly better than the Ride.  The Ride is more stable though and you can easily stand and fish from it...  that's not really an option with the Tarpon.  At the end of the day, if you are going to fish from it, the Ride is the way to go, imo."
Kayaking,39r96j,HindleMcCrindleberry,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:34:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice :)  Do you happen to know where I can even find somewhere to try them out? I've not had any luck finding that information online in my area (SE Wisconsin). I don't know if there's somewhere already known I'm just missing?
Kayaking,39r96j,Papatheosis,2,Sun Jun 14 04:50:10 2015 UTC,"I know REI carries them and it looks like there are 2 stores in the Milwaukee area.  So you could see them in person there but they aren't going to let you actually test them (I don't think, anyway)."

Kayaking,39rcp1,KayakHipster,2,Sun Jun 14 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. Used would be a great way to go. Plus, people often sell more gear as a bundle.   You can also try the classifieds on paddling.net as well as any local kayak shop. They'll often have used boats they're trying to sell for local paddlers or know of such deals."
Kayaking,39rcp1,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"There are often roof racks on craigslist that you can pick up for cheap. For the DIY route or on the cheaper, you can go with foam blocks and straps or I've even read about some folks using pool noodles on top of their car. I feel like a bit of a rep, but I was really happy using Autoanything.com to get a new rack. You can put in your car's year and make and it'll give you the appropriate racks that will fit, if you want to go with something new. If nothing else, you can get a feel for base pricing on racks.

I even checked Honda's factory accessories site and they had nothing either. Was about to just call it quits for the day but saw your comment and found a perfect rack from Inno that will fit my vehicle! There's a few local rack shops near me that carry their stuff so I'll be checking them out. Thanks again!"

Kayaking,39q20w,sam-29-01-14,5,Sat Jun 13 17:21:24 2015 UTC,When you capsize a kayak if you don't have the ability to roll it just swim out. Its not like your tied into it. Try to capsize intentionally in a calm situation so you'll know how to deal with the real thing if/when it happens.
Kayaking,39q20w,badpig,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my thought process. With a rowing boat you are tied in, so this has to be an easier capsize escape right?"
Kayaking,39q20w,spaghettibeans,2,Sat Jun 13 18:13:51 2015 UTC,You just push out out like the kayak was a pair of pants and you're free. The only real way to be sure it to purposely flip and practice.
Kayaking,39q20w,badpig,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:52:30 2015 UTC,Oh yes. I have capsized mine a few times only once unintentionally I still can't roll it but I can flip it and get back in.

The river winds away and then back to the trail at Monkton, giving you about an hour or so if you just steer a bit and let the river do all the work.  Depending on recent weather, it can get really shallow ant rapid in places, but I never got stuck.  I beached it near a deep spot in the river and did some swimming.  The water is quite cool, and clear enough to see the bottom, so no need to worry about creepy creatures.    The area is popular for tubing, particularly on weekends, but I only encountered three groups altogether on a Friday afternoon.  All in all, it was a very nice day.  PS. I found the sunglasses in the picture floating in the river, so if you lost them, PM me and all gladly send them to you."

We also just purchased a house so most of my time has been fixing it up lately.   I used to use $5 glasses all the time and would lose them often, then got a great sale on some polarized natives and they're so awesome to have out on the water. Really cuts down on the glare - so I wear them with a strap. I was so pissed cause I though ""crap, this is why I should have kept to cheap sunglasses"" and then it turned out it they were exactly where I had placed them. Maybe I'll just put those clips in a tiny edit. Might be worth the laugh."

Kayaking,39kq67,moosekayak,2,Wed Jun 17 14:01:27 2015 UTC,"Ah man. At Canada Games our K4 was warming up for the final, and our first seat realized that he might want sunglasses given the big waves and salt water spray (like, 50cm waves and horrible blinding spray and bright sun), but hadn't bothered to bring a pair (our third seat skipped a spray skirt in the heat and nearly sunk us). He asked to borrow mine, and since he had to steer, I passed them up to him.  Except instead of grabbing them, he knocked them into the water. He's thinking he owes me ~$200 for my Oakleys, and just dying of mortification that he did that. He starts apologizing profusely. Meanwhile, I had actually managed to catch them right as they hit the water, and lent them to him again."

Kayaking,39kq67,misterjones4,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:32:12 2015 UTC,Are there bulkheads between the seats in those? Never seen one up close.
Kayaking,39noul,boboswede,3,Sat Jun 13 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I bought a used Conduit 13 off Craigslist for $275.  I was in the market this spring and was going to go for one of those $200 10 foot Pelicans.  Then I had the thoughts that anything cheap at 12 foot would be better than anything 10 foot so was looking at the Aruba 12.  Every time I would go to Dick's thought, I would look at the Conduit.  I was thrilled when I found it used.  It has sealed front and rear bulkheads.  This means if you flip it, it's not going to sink.  You will still swamp the cockpit but there will still be air in the front and rear of the hull which will keep it afloat.  I haven't capsized yet (thought I was going to when the current slammed me up into a 4 foot diameter log on a 90 bend in the river last week, but I didn't capsize.)  I am brand new to this.  I am loving my Conduit.  I can't say anything about speed as I have no experience and haven't paddled with others in a lake.  It seems to move ok for me.  Mapmyride is telling me I was paddling around 4 mph on the lake.  My paddle technique isn't up to par yet either.  My boat is a 2011 model that I purchased the end of April.  The previous owner used it in some whitewater and bought something more whitewater friendly.  Since it is a few years old, there is some wear in the seat, seat back, and knee braces which is to be expected  I find it  pretty comfy.  I want to get out after about 2 hours to take a break, stretch the legs a bit, and get up off the rear end for a spell.  It's not luxury comfort but I find the seat nicely angled and the back rest is adjustable and easy to adjust.  There is no where molded into the seat for a bottle of water or anything like you may find on cheaper molded in seats.  I just throw a bottle with easy reach to the deck bungies.  I don't know what to tell about it as I don't have much experience and have no experience in any other boat.  I would have to guess that it is a much better boat for a beginner than the typical Pelican 10 foot boats that every one buys.  Tracking, I rented an 8 foot at the lake last year to give it a shot.  As soon as I stopped paddling, those boats just spun in circles.  The Conduit will track for me pretty good.  I think my paddling technique, or lack of technique will veer it one way or another and I have to correct.  It doesn't plow through the water.  I can take one paddle stroke along the shore and it will glide seemingly forever. I had taken a sandwich with me for dinner last time I was at the lake and a deer was at the water edge eating and drinking.  I took a small stroke with the paddle to get closer and sat and watched the deer as I ate my sandwich.  Before I knew it, I was still gliding closer to the deer and had to stop the boat because I didn't want to scare it away.  I paddle on Lake Arthur in Butler County PA which has a good bit of boat traffic but a 20 hp limit.  The main body of the lake can get some decent size chop from the wind and the boat takes the small wind chop pretty good.  I have video, but I've never broken it down to put clips up on youtube.  It was a lot of fun though going through the chop out on the main part of the lake seeing the water wash over the deck and splashing the camera.  I've gotten surprised not paying attention with boat wake from the side.  Like I said, it's only 20 hp limit, so not huge wake or anything, but the boat just bobbed up and over the wake waves.  I am really enjoying it.  My first go at the lake when I first got in, I felt pretty wobbly.  I very quickly got use to the feeling and it is very stable.  I can now twist my hips and put and leave it edged a bit (up to the point where water would wash up into the cockpit which I don't have a skirt so I would swamp it leaning it any further.)  I just did 9 miles on a narrow twisty flat river (no rapids) and it was very maneuverable.  For a first boat, I am finding it suiting my needs very well.  I hope to do an over night trip as well."

Kayaking,39noul,antisocialoctopus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:59:54 2015 UTC,"On a warm day, you should capsize on purpose and practice a wet exit as well as getting back in your boat. It's super useful so when it happens and you're not expecting it, no big deal. Pop right back in."
Kayaking,39noul,KayakHipster,2,Sat Jun 13 11:04:20 2015 UTC,Get kayaks off Craigslist. I'd avoid buying new if you can.  Id sink that $$ you save into buying nice nice paddles.
Kayaking,39noul,lamasnot,2,Sat Jun 13 09:52:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with several posts here. See if you can find used versions of the boats - and see if you can test them out on the water as well as sit in them and check the fit. With your height differences (if you guys are also far in different weights) you would benefit from different boats. My wife is 5'3"" 110 lbs, and I'm 5'11"", 165 lbs. we paddle boats that look almost the same in shape, but hers is a smaller version with lower volume. They handle the same but designed for our respective sizes and weights. They both fit us like a glove.   Also, the post about saving $$ and using on a good paddle, great info. A light paddle will make your day so much better. However, lots of times paddlers will sell boats, pfd's and paddles as a bundle, so you might luck out and catch a great used deal."
Kayaking,39lza4,katecruel,2,Fri Jun 12 17:50:22 2015 UTC,0 if you don't tie down the bow and stern.  Anywhere from 6-9 if you tie it down properly.

I just used all my credit card points on a dream kayak, and it looks like getting a rack installed would be $400ish plus the kayak rack at $100-200. This is something I'm only going to use when I take the kayak out, so if foam will work then I'd prefer to just use that and put my money toward an oar, etc. I might look into taking back roads so I can crawl at a snail's pace home."

Backroads until you get a better feel for it isn't a bad idea at all."
Kayaking,39lza4,Cypher1710,2,Fri Jun 12 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"I was pulled over by a NH state trooper to check my straps because I was doing 70 in the middle lane w a 16"" canoe on top of my Honda Accord. Foam blocks and 3 ratchet straps. One through the inside of the car with he actual ratchet inside and the doors closed on it for the extra synch. (Not closing the doors on it leads to you entering the vehicle through the window.) Then a strap in front and back synched tight to the frame in front and transport hitch in the rear.   Use towels or more foam padding in places where the straps touch the paint. It will strip the paint right off the car with the vibration from the wind.   But I drove 350 miles from LI to Maine above the speed limit. Actually got better gas mileage with the canoe on top."
Kayaking,39lza4,iaintcommenting,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:09:18 2015 UTC,This. Bow and stern lines save lives (and boats).  If you tie it down right then your boat isn't going anywhere (source: I totaled my car and my kayak didn't budge)
Kayaking,39lza4,iaintcommenting,2,Fri Jun 12 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't even know what brand I use, I just grabbed the cheapest one I could find at Canadian Tire (I think the whole kit cost me about $30-35 with tax). As long as the straps will tighten down enough and the foam blocks don't budge when everything's strapped down then you're fine.   Just a tip though: make sure your bow and stern lines are tied to the frame of your car, not the bumper - you might be able to find hooks in the frame used for towing or your car may have come with some sort of hook that will screw into the frame on the front."

I continued on driving to the next town about 45 mph and stopped at a fast food joint for dinner.  That's where I snapped the picture above.  After eating, checked and the straps were still tight.  From there I got into some 50 mph 2 lane climbing up through the mountains.  After I got up to the top of the mountains, the road opened up to expressway, 4 lane and 65 mph.  Before I knew it, I had gained the confidence and was running 70-75 mph the rest of the way home."

Kayaking,39maun,K0NGO,3,Fri Jun 12 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"It's actually best that you start without gear. Find a paddling club near you that does what you're thinking of doing. Check for them on meetup, the ACA website (americancanoe.org), paddling.net or just google. See when they offer tours or group paddles. You can also check for instructors and classes near you if you want as well. The ACA website has a list by location.   That way you can test out different types of paddling (unless WW is it, then just look for WW groups/clubs/instructors) and jump right in. It's always recommended to get started with others that know the sport. Paddling can be done very safely, and doing it with experienced people is the best way to go. Don't just go solo without knowing what you're getting yourself into. A fun afternoon can turn ugly real quick.   Also, you'll get to try out all sorts of gear and test things, so you can then make educated decisions with gear you want to get. Lastly, kayakers are always getting new gear, so by just having groups of paddling friends, you'll always have a chance to get used gear for super cheap.   Hope that helps!  Cheers and welcome."
Kayaking,39maun,KayakHipster,2,Fri Jun 12 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"It's actually best that you start without gear.   I don't know if I necessarily agree with that. Sometimes it's possible, but the easiest way to get into it and stick with it is having your own gear. Having to borrow or rent seems to put up additional barriers to just going at it.  I know that more than half the guys I paddle with bought the boat first, and stumbled upon the whitewater community/boaters second."
Kayaking,39maun,nittanyvalley,2,Sat Jun 13 19:38:10 2015 UTC,True but think about it this way - I have so much stuff that I got thinking I was doing the right thing and then once I started paddling with groups I realized I had spent money on wrong gear. Or gear that was unnecessary. True that it's great to have your own stuff once you get going. But that first couple of times trying things out - might be better to just rent from a club and have them tell you why they put you in that gear.
Kayaking,39maun,KayakHipster,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:59:13 2015 UTC,How would I know which boat to buy without some experience?
Kayaking,39maun,nittanyvalley,2,Sat Jun 13 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"Well yeah it helps to demo boats.  But most modern river runners are pretty good with fitting for the masses, and they are fairly forgiving boats that allow you to do a little bit of everything, yet they are still boats that can (and are) paddled on Class IV and V whitewater by the pros (i.e. they aren't beginner boats per se). If you can find a good deal on a used one that is the right size for you, pull the trigger. Can always sell it later (or keep it) and get something else.  Something like a Liquid Logic Remix, Pyranha Burn or Karnali, Dagger Mamba, Jackson Zen, Wavesport Diesel, etc."

Kayaking,39lqer,katecruel,2,Fri Jun 12 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"YOU DON'T GIVE US ENOUGH INFORMATION TO JUDGE.  Sorry, had to take a potshot at your CAPS.  That's a fairly large boat, and it weighs ~61#s.  You may need help lifting it.    What kind of water do you (plan) to paddle?  This is going to be a boat more suited towards big water (larger lakes, ocean).  If you're doing small rivers or lakes I'd probably look at something in the 10-12' range.  But again, just my first take based on the little information given.  Again, the paddle depends.  I am rather partial to the AquaBound Sting Ray Fiberglass (retails around $100) or the Werner Skagit (a little more)."

You definitely want bulkheads -- airtight chambers that will keep the kayak afloat if you capsize.   I personally like tandems -- it keeps me near my SO, where normally I am way faster than her. Probably not good for fishing though.  Lastly, don't get the kayak you want to paddle today -- get the kayak you'll want to paddle a year from now when you are super comfortable on it.   And if you or your SO is comfortable working with tools you can always add rod holders and stuff to the deck later."

Kayaking,39hu7z,gm83,2,Fri Jun 12 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"Out of the choices in your photos, the last one is certainly out. That is a recreational sit-in that is not ocean worthy. In order to be safe for ocean use, it needs to have airtight hatches in the front and back. If that boat in the picture takes on water, it'll just sink. A sea kayak can have the entire cockpit full of water, you in it, and will continue to float. This also means they'll be at least 14' in length.   I'll let others give you advice on sit on tops, I know more about sit in sea kayaks. I tend to see most people that want to fish going after sit on tops, as they provide a lot of room for gear and are very stable. Sit in sea kayaks are designed to be very unstable. The more unstable they are, the easier they cope with waves.   People that can help you with sit on tops will need your heights and weights. Kayaks need to fit your body type."

Kayaking,39agzy,WheelsAndGears,5,Wed Jun 10 12:34:05 2015 UTC,This is a great post. Good paddling technique is crucial on the river. I've never understood the purpose of using a low angle paddle to track straight. A low angle stroke is pretty much results in a sweep.
Kayaking,39agzy,moscomule,2,Wed Jun 10 13:16:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, great post. Wanted to comment on the low angle paddling you mention. Depending on the width of the boat, low angle paddling might be the only available option. With some of the really wide rec boats out there, low angle will almost certainly will be the way to go - and you're right, it'll lead to mostly sweep strokes if paddlers don't pay attention to technique and how to improve their stroke.   I completely agree with OP though. It's all a matter of practice and technique that'll open your eyes and make you go ""wow. I've just paddled the same distance in half the time just because of how I'm holding the paddle, where I'm putting it in the water and how I'm taking it out."""
Kayaking,39agzy,KayakHipster,3,Wed Jun 10 13:27:41 2015 UTC,As a beginner this is very helpful. I've also realized that if I have two of us in the kayak I need to sit as far back as possible.
Kayaking,39agzy,Lighterless,3,Wed Jun 10 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think the issues of an unbalanced paddle stroke are also exacerbated by 'arm paddling' rather than paddling with core muscles. For example, when a paddler uses their arms they are often less focused on the length of time the blade is in the water, the angle of the blade, and the potentially uneven strength of their arms. All of these can lead to an uneven distribution of power from the paddle to the water.   When a paddler is using a proper forward stroke, all the power is provided by strong core muscles that are engaged by a subtle twisting of the torso and very little movement in the arms and shoulders. As a result, the wrists and arms are used to set the angle, entry, and exit of the paddle, and the twisting of the torso can be much more consistent (and strong!). I found that this provided a much more consistent paddle stroke and allowed for better fine tuning through the stroke to guide the boat, and improved tracking in kayaks of any shape or size.  A proper forward stroke also relies on having a firm yet relaxed connection to the boat, as OP has described. This relies on having a well fitting boat with contact at the feet, thighs, and hips and also allows for the use of edging. In my experience, a significant difference between a forward stroke and a sweep stroke has to do with how you use your lower body in connection with a paddle stroke. In the forward stroke, there is little engagement of the legs and lower body. If a paddler engages their lower body with a strong sweep stroke, they will find there is a ton of turning power available when necessary.  Thanks for a good post, OP!"
Kayaking,39agzy,burritoace,5,Wed Jun 10 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"You're right on all counts, but the torso twist need not be ""subtle"" and one could (should?) definitely engage the legs/lower body regardless of forward stroke vs. sweep stroke.    Watch K1 sprinters at work on YouTube - Olympics, ICF worlds, etc.  Its all forward stroke.  Note the way their legs ""bicycle"".  Note how much their core rotates - from a perpendicular vantage point on the bank, you can read the logo on their chest at the catch.  Some of these paddlers have swivel seats which exaggerate the motion but it's a good visual example of what it should look like in a perfect world that you can adapt to your own needs (and boat).  For me the only difference between my forward and sweep stroke is the sweep stroke has a lower angle and the blade stays in the water past my hip.  That power you find engaging your legs on the sweep?  I want that power in every stroke."

Kayaking,39agzy,meohmy13,2,Wed Jun 10 23:39:20 2015 UTC,Thanks OP I have been thinking the same thing.  The one guy who fab'ed a skeg for his boat showed some impressive ingenuity but some better paddling would probably have done a world of good.    I've got a short boat (9.5') with a retractable skeg....I always spend a little while paddling without the skeg deployed.  It's very unforgiving without it and I have to really focus on good technique that way.  My biggest issue (right now) is pulling past my hip on the forward stroke....really sends me spinning and also makes my shoulder sore.
Kayaking,39agzy,KayakHipster,3,Wed Jun 10 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Very good point. My instructors always pushed for anyone with a rudder to not use them until months after learning to paddle. People often use correcting devices and then become dependent on them to go straight, instead of working on a better forward stroke as well as corrective strokes. Don't get me wrong, rudders are very useful but can become a crutch if people don't learn to paddle without them first."

Kayaking,39agzy,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Just a note for Greenland paddles:  I've been instructed that for Greenland paddles, a normal forward stroke ends with the hands at the hip, and the blade is well behind you. Here is one discussion of the GP stroke.  This in no way suggests that this applies to non-Greenland paddles."

The drop down skeg did make a difference in how it paddled, but that boat was made for quick maneuvers. That was actually the boat that forced me to learn better paddling techniques. I believe THIS is the video I watched that taught me a lot about whitewater paddling specifically, but there is a ton of information on the web/youtube about proper paddling technique."
Kayaking,39agzy,rachelhduncan,2,Wed Jun 10 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"Just paddle a whitewater boat for awhile. Better, one with a displacement hull and lots of rocker.  In at the toes, out at the hips.  It's all technique."

Kayaking,39cn62,outta-here,3,Wed Jun 10 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"Methods others have said will help for sure. Practice practice practice. However, this post brings up a very good point. OP here took initiative to learn and practice the re-entry, and is having trouble with it. This is the main reason for people (especially beginners) to paddle in groups if possible. Just having that extra person to hold the boat in place will make all the difference in an emergency situation.   Don't get me wrong, solo trips are amazing. No noises, no one to bug you, etc. however, if conditions are not good enough within your skill level to go solo, going with one or two more paddlers can make a world of difference.   But tons of people will just go to dicks, buy a rec boat, get out on the water on their own and never try to see if they can get back in by themselves."
Kayaking,39cn62,KayakHipster,2,Wed Jun 10 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"First of all, well done for testing your abilities.  Many paddlers have no idea what to do in a capsize.    Another vote for stern entry, as I think that may be easier for you."
Kayaking,39cn62,dispatch00,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Good to see you taking interest in the sport. A couple of tips or ideas:  Like the other post says, try from the back of the boat. Put one hand on either side of the boat at the rear. Dip down into the water, kick as hard as you can, then push down with both hands as you try to straddle the back of the boat. The work your way forward.   There is another method used that involves a float bag or extra PFD. Place your paddle over the front of your boat. Place a strap around the boat to hold the paddle in place, then attach a floating device of some sort to the extended end of the paddle. This will give you a balance point to hold the boat steady as you re-enter from the side the float is on. This can be done without the strap going around the boat and paddle to save time. In a last-resort, you can use your own PFD on the end of the paddle, or placed under your feet to give you a little extra lift, But that should only be the last possible choice. It is best to be prepared with an extra PFD or a float bag of sorts.   If you check out articles/videos from ocean kayakers, they often use the float on the paddle trick, since their boats are so narrow and tippy. I have also seen paddlers use a strap around the paddle that would dangle into the water to be used as a step. This Page illustrates the strap and paddle float method well. accompany this with the foot loop and nearly anyone should be able to quickly and effectively get back in their boat.  The bottom line is probably weight, height, leverage, and strength that are causing your difficulty. Proper technique and proper gear can help you overcome any of that. Don't get discouraged though. It is a difficult thing for nearly any paddler to get back in a boat. that is why it takes practice and why there are products on the market to help. Good luck!"
Kayaking,39cn62,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:35:35 2015 UTC,I don't know if it'll help but when I self rescue I hold the stern of the kayak and kick my legs so I'll be kinda like superman in the water(belly flat close to the water line) and it's much easier to hop on   I can draw it if you want haha
Kayaking,39cn62,gzoztra,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"Stern approach recommended by others may work.  For the side approach, a lot of videos seem to suggest pressing down on the near side of the boat and boosting yourself up out of the water.  Personally, I reach all the way across to the far side of the boat and pull my torso up as far as I can, then swing one leg up toward the bow and then the other."

There are quite a few on craigslist in my area.   I'm also new to kayaking, but I think the length of the kayak is more dependent on how you want to use is and how much room that you have to store it, than it is on how tall you are.

You will have to be very careful with it causing the boat to tip, unless you attach an outrigger to balance it out. I believe there are some kits for this on the interwebs, but I don't have much personal experience with it.   Another idea for you is to get one of the large kites to use to pull you along. Something along THESE LINE But probably smaller. Be careful with any of this as it will likely make you flip a few times before you get it right.

Kayaking,396nm1,MannyCoon,5,Tue Jun 9 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Keep a good stroke rhythm and adjust your stroke strength as you start to turn.  Another good practice is to pick a point on the horizon and look at it as you paddle.  Try to keep the boat aimed at that point.  This will all become muscle memory at some point and you'll be able to subconsciously anticipate and correct for wind, current, and wake etc.    Some boats naturally track better than others of course, but there are a lot of things you can do with practice that will help you achieve and maintain glide speed on a straight course.    Good luck"

Kayaking,396nm1,paddlin84,3,Tue Jun 9 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"If you get good enough at paddling most of the techniques you will learn, sweep strokes and edging, to keep going straight will become second nature and automatic.

Kayaking,396nm1,jbaird,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"I just realized this weekend.. on year 3 of paddling and a full year last year with my sea kayak that I dont' really think about tracking or going in a straight line or really turning all that much, I just do it..   I was the same way when I started.. always kind of fighting with the boat to get it going straight.. soon you just learn to cope  if you have a spay skirt or.. maybe even if you don't I'd try to get in the habit of leaning the kayak to one side or the other, this is what I typically use to make minor corrections to keep myself going in a straight line or to even exagerate the turning power of a bigger stroke/sweep stroke"
Kayaking,396nm1,JohnnyLaces,4,Tue Jun 9 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"Wind and wake will always turn a boat perpendicular to it, it's called weather cocking. As far as what to do to correct it, you can try sweep strokes and edging."

Kayaking,398x0e,thehairyrussian,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"I paddle mostly on the north shore of the Long Island sound. Don't be fooled by the fact that it is usually on the calm side. It can change from 1-2' waves to 4-5 footers in the span of an hour as well as 30+ knot winds. I often see people set out with recreational kayaks because they see that it might be calm for a bit, but it can turn ugly fast and with off-shore winds you can get blown out quickly if you're not careful.   You should consider getting a sea worthy kayak for sure. If you want a sit-in, make sure it's at least 14' long with watertight hatches in the bow and stern.    Otherwise get a sea worthy sit on top, I'll let others advise on specs for those since I'm not as familiar with them.   Edit - wanted to add, you're in a location that will certainly allow you to find a lot of used options. It's usually the best bet for getting your money's worth."
Kayaking,398x0e,KayakHipster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:04:32 2015 UTC,"I never advise going with the cheapest boat option unless you just want something for your 4 year old to use in the pool. You get what you pay for with kayaks. This is not only a tool for fishing/fun, it is also a piece of safety equipment. Make sure you are getting the right tool for the job and that you are staying safe.   For an area like that, you will want a long boat(14 foot or more sounds about right). For fishing, a wider boat is generally more stable. Look up fishing boats and make note of the width of them. Nearly all of them are 30+ inches wide.   I would suggest going to a local boat store, not a chain like basspro, but a legit mom-and-pop boat shop and getting some advise. Or you can meet up with a local group and see what kinds of boats they use. Many of them will likely even let you paddle their around.   If you stay close to the shore on a calm day, you're probably going to be okay in most any boat. If you're a mile out and the swell hits 5 foot as you're fighting a 100 pound grouper, you're going to really appreciate the proper boat saving your life and allowing you to land the fish with confidence."

Kayaking,397ktb,Nietzsche__,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:19:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! I should have thought of that.
Kayaking,398s3r,hardnipst,2,Wed Jun 10 02:03:22 2015 UTC,Assuming you and your friend are renting from an outfitter they should provide you with the life jackets (pfd) and also assuming it's on calm water. Just make sure to bring your phone in a ziplock or two and some bottled water and I think you'll be fine.
Kayaking,398s3r,gm83,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:16:21 2015 UTC,I would put it in a dry box like a Pelican or Otterbox. Ziplock backs leak and they likely won't float.
Kayaking,398s3r,nittanyvalley,2,Wed Jun 10 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"Wear sunscreen, even if cloudy. The water reflects it and increases the effects of the sun on your skin. Bring plenty of water, especially if it'll be a hot day. Also a snack or two in case you guys want something to munch on. I would recommend bringing a change of clothes for sure - not necessarily to take with you out on the kayak if it's calm, but leave it in your car (along with a towel). There's a good chance you'll get wet and you'll want to change for the ride home.   Lastly, make sure you guys know where you're going. Either if it's a small lake and you'll be close to the outfitters, or if they're providing you with a map, etc. if it's your first time, just be conscious of where you're going so you can find your way back.   You'll have a great time!"
Kayaking,398s3r,KayakHipster,2,Wed Jun 10 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"From the sound of this, you're going with a more experienced person in the group. Is that correct? You could definitely ask them any of these questions. But, here is my general advice, a PFD is a personal flotation device. Yes, that generally means it is a life jacket. As long as it fits, you should be fine with most vests on the market in calm water.   Two beginners in a tandem kayak means you're probably both going to be fighting each other to go where you want. The person in the rear generally does most of the steering while the person in the front does more spotting/navigating(aka avoiding rocks and trees).   A small dry box(20 bucks) clipped or tied to the boat is wonderful for keys, phones, wallets, a little cash for a taxi back to the car or to bribe a local if things go bad, and TOILET PAPER. Don't forget the TP. Depending on where you're going that can be wonderful. The dry box will come in handy a dozen other times in your life too so it's worth the investment. Take it to the amusement park, ball games, beach, etc. It will give you a good place for your valuables and is handy if you get caught in a sudden rain. Your clothes might get soaked, but your phone will be dry when you get back to the car and your battery is dead, so you can still call for help.   As for clothes, dress for the weather, but also for the water temperature. In the summer, a couple of thin layers and a rain jacket just in case is usually sufficient. Wear shoes you don't mind getting a little muddy on the river bank. Don't wear big boots, especially if you have big feet. If your boat is not a sit-on-top, foot space can get a little limited. I suggest small tennis shoes or sandals most of the time. Water shoes are great too and you can get a pair for 10 bucks. Keep in mind, you may need to swim if things go bad, or good depending on the water.   If the person supplying the gear is any kind of decent person, you can probably trust them to not throw you into a dangerous situation. With the advise that everyone has given you, plus a little common sense and good judgement, you should be just fine.  If you provide more details of the trip, you may get more specific advise. Is it a group of friends, will it just be the two beginners and no-body else, is it at a resort, at a boat shop that does rentals, what type of water, the name of the body of water."
Kayaking,398s3r,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:14:11 2015 UTC,"Nope it's two complete beginners. We're renting it from a main place that a lot of people go to so I trust them there (we have to sign waivers and rental agreements). The only thing that is getting to me is when I emailed the guy if I should rent the kayak with my friend.   He told me renting it is probably not for you, and you should take a class.   I really want to go out this weekend since I won't have an opportunity for future classes so I want to do the rental."
Kayaking,398s3r,WheelsAndGears,2,Thu Jun 11 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"I would go if it is calm water and a stable boat. What I mean by calm water is, you are paddling around a lake on a day with good weather. Two first timers on a tandem should not go into hardly any current, so stay away from water with any real movement. You do not want the water to be able to push you into things.   A stable boat would be something like a sit-on-top tandem. Most of those are fairly wide recreational boats that are pretty stable.   Chances are, if they do boat rentals on a particular piece of water, they are probably going to have you on a pretty safe boat and a safe stretch of water. To cover their own butts, and make money off the class, they are going to tell you you should take a class first. With that said, I also encourage you to take a class, or at the very least, get more information about the trip. There may be others that have rented from there that have provided a review on their website or something that might give you an idea of what you're getting in to. I understand not wanting to miss out on a fun opportunity, but you don't want to miss out on your next 30 years either. I advise you to get more information. I would call the shop you are renting from and discuss this with them more."

Kayaking,395m0w,verdantwords,2,Tue Jun 9 15:04:55 2015 UTC,I would stick with the $50 set of j racks from eBay. The yaks you have are about 40 pounds.

Kayaking,395m0w,KayakHipster,2,Tue Jun 9 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"The main brands that are most trusted are Thule, yakima and Malone. Check on their websites for different styles, and then you can check on Craigslist, ebay and paddling.net classifieds for used gear if you'd like to save some money. Otherwise check on places like kayak shops, Amazon, etc if you want to buy new."
Kayaking,395m0w,Kudzupatch,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the bow and stern lines, but as long as you put them together and attach them to car, there is nothing to worry about. There cheap and sometimes a little annoying to put together, but they are not junk by any means!  I have 8 sets I use on my kayak trailer. I hauled boats a few thousand miles to the shows this spring and never had any issues at all.  I understand peoples concern and I wouldn't have bought them had I not seen them first But I can recommend them without any fear.  I have even considering buying them and putting them in my store."
Kayaking,395m0w,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they are - what worries me is how salt annihilates most metals that are on the cheap side. I remember my first rack was a swiss folding one, and while the rack was good, the bolts it came with were garbage. After a couple of months they were rusted to the point that I had to cut them to get them off. I replaced them with better hardware and didn't worry about it. The yakima rack I got since has much better parts. I feel a lot more confident in its clamps as well. Lastly, the padding on the yakimas is superb. For glass boats, I would be hesitant to put them on cheap metal J's without adding some extra padding. Not a big deal at all, but the yakimas had that covered out of the box. That's all. For a plastic rec boat though, or WW boats, I wouldn't think twice about using any old J's."

Kayaking,3946it,The_Mightiest_One,3,Tue Jun 9 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, put heaviest things near you in front and back. So start with the lightest things that you can shove into the bow and stern. Try to match weight of items in front and back. Then end with heaviest things towards you on both ends. When you're in the water, you want the heavy area around you so when you're trying to turn your kayak, the bow and stern are a bit easier to maneuver. Also, try to do the same from side to side. If you put a heavy water bottle on one side, try to match it with something else - or place it in the middle of the boat.   When you're done loading it, place it in the water and look at how it sits. Adjust gear until the boat sits as close to perfectly straight as possible. This is called trimming the boat.   If you get the boat to sit as close to level both front to back and side to side, you'll get the best performance out of it.   Hope that helps!  Cheers."

Kayaking,393nma,TheNiceSerealKiller,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"You have a few options. The cheapest decent option is a kit with foam blocks and some good straps to strap to the roof. This method works well and doesn't generally do any damage to the vehicle. You just go up from there.   If you have the money and/or find a good deal, use something like the yakima or thule roof rack systems. The possibilities are huge with those and you can get the basic roof bars at first, then add the kayak stackers or cradles as you desire. I have used a thule rack to put a 17 foot canoe on an 03 Mustang."
Kayaking,391pon,mpsullivan11,2,Mon Jun 8 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a pretty good deal.  Keep in mind that tandem kayaks are also known as ""divorce kayaks.""  If you're both beginners, getting in sync can be extremely difficult.  My wife wanted to get into kayaking so I just bought her a separate kayak. :)  Also, if you want to go fishing solo, tandem kayaks are a little more difficult to maneuver by yourself - you may need to add weight to the empty seat to help keep it straight."
Kayaking,391pon,frederick_pooperton,2,Mon Jun 8 18:00:39 2015 UTC,We go out fairly often and rent a tandem on a lake and we work pretty well together so not too worried about that. Although I do weigh 265 so I think you're right about me needing to weigh down the front while going solo.
Kayaking,391pon,KayakHipster,3,Mon Jun 8 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"I second the idea of two kayaks. If you guys are used to doing it together, great, but if you ever want to go alone, loading and unloading a tandem on your own is tough. If you have separate boats of course you can have just as much fun together, but when you're on your own, it's so much easier to deal with. Just an opinion though.   Cheers and Gluck!"

Standing Bear is another lake with cools pathways that lead into it. Chalco is another area. Glenn Cunningham reservoir is next on my list as far as lakes go. It looks great.
Kayaking,3926ae,TheLizardBox,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:35:58 2015 UTC,"I just looked it up and the beam is 29.5"". That means you'll have to go with a fairly long shaft for a somewhat low angle for paddling.   Do you have any paddle at all now? You can go the cheap route which would be any paddle from dicks. They will be extremely cheap but very heavy. Will serve their purpose but after a couple of hours on the water you'll be exhausted.   On the other hand, you can go slightly more expensive, maybe a carbon shaft and/or a fiberglass paddle, and you'd be able to stay out for hours.   Here's the dilemma. The rec boat you mentioned is wide, and if you ever change to a narrower boat, you'll have to get another paddle. So one thing you can do is look for a higher end model that can change length. Several brands do this. So you can get a paddle that'll suit your current boat, and if you change it later on it should still work for you.   Werner are great paddles but expensive Aquabound are more accessible but not as light, but I believe they have the extending models You have a lot of other brands out there. Dicks usually carries stuff like chute, etc. I believe they're around $40, but truly heavy."

I've had a pelican potomac for like 4 years now, mostly river runs, and it has gotten the job done more than enough. It's been in the lake holding me and my 2 year old, countless 15-19mi day trips on the river, and next weekend my first kayamping trip. Fits good on top of my small kia rio.

Kayaking,38yduk,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Congrats on launch, but two things on my end.   I know you spent a lot of time and effort on this app and want to make $$, but the price seems way too steep to have someone take a chance on this app. I currently use All Trails for something similar, and although I don't remember how much it was, I would bet it was half your price or less, and the UI is more polished. Personally I would set an intro price of 99c or 2 bucks and hope tons of people take a chance and try it, rather than most people will not be willing to sink $10 on it just to test it. Angry birds made millions selling their game at 99c, and they made money because of volume of buyers, not price point.   On your description, I don't think you need to use an exclamation point on every feature. It's a list of the things your app does. I'm not surprised it does this, it's just its function. No need for the !!!'s.   Other than that, best of luck with it."
Kayaking,38yduk,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:01:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for your feed back Trails.com is a wonderful site and just so you know angry birds made most of their millions off of $29.99 in app purchases.  The reviews will speak for themselves. Stay Tuned!
Kayaking,38yduk,gzoztra,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what else they've done, my point is this - I took a chance on alltrails because the entry price was so low.   Angry Birds at first had no in app purchases, and I believe they passed their million mark way before in app purchases became a thing.   I've never taken a chance on an app I didn't already want at your price point. I think the most expensive app I've ever bought was a music creation one that I had been waiting many months for its release. And that was a monster app. I believe other than that the most I've spent on an app has been $5 for one of the GTA games. That's self explanatory though. The rest of my apps will be in the 99c - $4 range.   Once again, this is a viewpoint from a consumer that might help. Only reason I'm sharing. I'm not in any way trying to put down your app or your efforts."

Kayaking,38zf60,BorealHound,4,Mon Jun 8 03:16:31 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'8"" 155# and paddle a Romany nearly every day in the summer for at least a few hours at a time as a sea kayak guide. I have a high angle stroke and use a Werner Cyprus neural bent 210cm. I would actually prefer a 205 for general touring (and an even shorter, bigger paddle for surf and rough water), but I frequently have to paddle a very wide tandem for work, so the 210 is a compromise. I would recommend the Cyprus, and while transitioning to a high angle stroke will serve you well in the long run, don't worry too much about having a paddle that perfectly fits your style. It's mostly marketing anyway. The one thing that will absolutely make a difference on longer tours is the weight of the paddle.  If you can, try to demo a bunch of paddles. There are so many variables like shaft diameter, length, stiffness, and blade size, that it's hard to know what you'll like without trying different paddles. You'll get an idea for what you prefer after a while."
Kayaking,38zf60,d542east,2,Mon Jun 8 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree here. After a couple of hours, weight of the paddle is a huge benefit if you go with carbon. I like the ikelos vs the Cyprus due to more surface area, but it is a bit too much if I spend a long time on the water. I switch between that and a greenland paddle though. I love the weight of the ikelos, and the Cyprus is indeed top notch. My wife uses it (as do most paddlers in our group) and I paddle it from time to time. Beautiful paddle, and if you can find it used, even better. My wife and I bought ours used from our two instructors, and they happened to fit perfectly. My ikelos is a 215, and it was perfect since I'm almost 6' with a large wingspan, and my wife's is a 205 bent shaft Cyprus which fits her perfectly."
Kayaking,38zf60,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Great, that's exactly what I'm looking for. I'd love to demo a wide variety but most of the local stores carry only Aqua Bound paddles, and only a limited selection of those. I'll check into the Cyprus and see if a friend has one I can try. Thanks!"
Kayaking,38zf60,lamasnot,2,Mon Jun 8 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"I have a really really long wingspan like 6'2"" I'm only 5'9"" tall. I like a 200cm with my 24"" wide boat.  I am a high angle paddler.  I grew up whitewater.  I'll paddle any paddle, I've used and borrowed a bunch in the past 12 years the biggest things to me in order are 1. Weight, weight weight 2. Adjustable feather, 3. Ability to get it in my car,  4. I like a bent shaft 5. Length and 6. Blade shape for high or low angle paddle etc ...  get a werner carbon fiber if you can afford it."

Carbon shift fiberglass blade,  the carbon blades have sandwich layer of flotation which makes for more effort putting blade in water.

It's a bit small for my size (6'2'') so I had to move the seat back. I think they make the 175 for my size but I got mine used do I didn't have that option.  Tracking is good but only with the skeg down..So I just keep it down pretty much all the time..  I love having the size though, lots of storage, pretty quick and at 17' it rides on choppy water do much nicer than my 10' kayak"
Kayaking,38xfhh,Alsandr,3,Sun Jun 7 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with the boat, but do you mean the centre pillar? Don't remove that. It's responsible for a decent amount of the structural integrity of the boat, and means that it won't sink if it's swamped."

Just make sure to go with others that know what they're doing at first, paddlers and instructors are always willing to pass on tons of info as well as tips on equipment.

Kayaking,38yg5c,rushbcom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"As an experienced paddler, I do feel comfortable going fishing on lakes and ponds by myself. I always wear a PFD and use good judgement/common sense. I would be somewhat okay with paddling a well-known creek/river by myself, but that is a situation that can go bad in a hurry. I have essentially taught swiftwater rescue classes to rescue teams, so I have a great deal of knowledge about what is going on. I have also seen the results of when things go wrong.... Very sad results. You do not want to be a victim or a statistic. Use good judgement, get all of the information you can, and learn to do the sport right so you can have a great and safe time on the water.   A beginner should always have a buddy and get any training/advice you can from other paddlers. If you buy a boat from some of the better shops, the small shops that sell the good boats, they will often throw in free lessons with the purchase of the boat. Many of them also offer lessons and have demo days when you can test out a variety of boats.   As stated, try to find groups to join up with or convince a friend to get into the sport too. If you're in an area with a lot of water, there will definitely be some paddling groups. Even if they use canoes or SUPs, they will most likely welcome you and be more than willing to help.   This is a wonderful sport filled with many helpful people. Aside from a few bad apples, most of them will fill you full of knowledge, wisdom and advice, whether you ask for it or not. You're taking a good first step in asking these questions here, before you get in the water."

If you have kayaked before and were comfortable this should be suitable. It won't be prime in smile rivers obviously but for lakes and ocean it would be great.

Plenty of room for minor modifications, if that's something you choose to do.  The best part is that it should hold its value, so when you're ready to upgrade, you can probably get back whatever you put into it by selling it on craigslist.

Kayaking,38rsg8,SumTingWong59,6,Sat Jun 6 06:46:43 2015 UTC,Sits in the bed just fine! Use two ropes or two ratchet straps to hold it in place and you should be just fine. Make sure at least one strap goes through a handle and the end sticking out of the bed has an orange hauling flag for safety reasons.
Kayaking,38rsg8,that_redneck_guy,2,Sat Jun 6 10:39:55 2015 UTC,"If you can find a nice stretch of water.....  seriously though, if you have a full size bed, throw a sheet of treated plywood in there to slide 4' over the tailgate as an extension.  Use tiedowns, single buckle cam straps are the norm.  If you have to use ratchet straps just be sure you're going finger tight; you'll always be able to get them tighter, even when your boat is permanently pinched in a V.  Don't eff up your kayak trying to keep it safe.  Some people build or use ladder racks for pickups, a nice permanent addition to your rig, but might set you back.  From there, you can get all sorts of fancier rack systems with kayak specific options.  Want to spend $10,000 before you even take a trip?  Kayaking can be that hobby for you."
Kayaking,38rsg8,NotSayingJustSaying,2,Sat Jun 6 08:34:09 2015 UTC,It depends on the size of your kayak and truck bed.  You don't want to have 8' of boat hanging out the back of your truck bed for sure.  3-4' is fine but you'll want to put a red flag/rag on the end of your yak when driving.  Another cheap option is a receiver rack.

As far as sit ins, you can do the same with the handles in the front or back, but in reality it's not as secure because someone could just cut your handles off"

Kayaking,38sdj8,bubabudan,2,Sat Jun 6 11:54:25 2015 UTC,"I can't say anything for the water really. It looks fairly calm though. The boat itself should float okay on flat water and you would likely be okay. The bolts through the fiberglass scare me the most. A little pressure on there and the fiberglass will be cracking/breaking. Hopefully they put something on the back side to spread the pressure out.   I did make some outriggers for a boat out of PVC pipe for about 20 dollars-US once. Then attached them with a ratchet strap. If you're just looking for the stability of an outrigger, they can be added to most boats fairly easily. Probably easier to do on a canoe even."
Kayaking,38sdj8,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:09:23 2015 UTC,Thanks mate! I ended up buying it. I'll send some pictures when i attach the outrigger. I've trawled through the net for different designs and I think i'm happy with one.  Until next time!

Kayaking,38q0no,yellowspiders308,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:47:52 2015 UTC,"I did this last summer. It's not as much kayaking as you would think. The first leg was maybe 10 mins, from Filling Station to Right Brain. There is no formal landing at Right Brain, you tie your kayak to a rope in the water and climb up a kind of steep dirt hill to get to the brewery. Expect to get wet.   From Right Brain to the next 3 breweries was maybe 20 mins, but you then leave the water (there's a dam in the way) and walk. My friend and I decided to walk to the remaining breweries (North Peak and Workshop) rather than kayak, as it was mainly walking rather than kayaking for the rest of the trip.   The kayaking park seemed more of a hassle, but the pub crawl part was pretty fun. I would highly recommend the Traverse City Ale Trail, we ended up going to all the area breweries in one weekend and got a free silicone pint glass out of it. But the Paddle for Pints event was more of a hassle than it was worth, especially since we brought our own kayaks. If you do go, have fun, but be careful. Drinking and kayaking can be dangerous."

That said, sitting sidesaddle in your poorly outfitted (no seat back, no helmet, no leg straps wtf) is hard to describe as ""destroying"" anything.  If he boofed off of every one of those weirs cleanly and confidently without falling off of the boat, that would be destroying it.

Kayaking,38ifj0,awkward_ostrich,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:46:38 2015 UTC,All three parallel to the kayaks? Or perpendicular spaced out?
Kayaking,38ifj0,nittanyvalley,2,Thu Jun 4 13:43:32 2015 UTC,"Perpendicular to give it something soft to rest on. Just buy 1 or 2 noodles and cut them into shorter pieces.  Best way to store kayaks is on their stern standing straight up. If you can't do that, on the sides is second best."
Kayaking,38ifj0,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"okay, we'll do that. There's enough room to stand them straight up.. but there are windows for the garage, and I'm worried about theft. Maybe if we covered the windows up..."

Kayaking,38ifj0,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Either end probably works, but usually the stern is a little heavier in my experience.

Kayaking,3899jx,valdez237,5,Tue Jun 2 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"This was a day trip a friend and I took out on Lake Murray, SC. The kayak was bought on CL. It is an older Wilderness Systems Alto. As for the tracking issues, I fabricated a stationary rudder which helped immensely with keeping the boat straight."
Kayaking,3899jx,samsara_kayak,2,Tue Jun 2 19:01:20 2015 UTC,Mind sharing a photo of your rudder? Purely for curiosity's sake
Kayaking,3899jx,safety3rd,2,Tue Jun 2 23:58:33 2015 UTC,"Here it is! It's made out of plexiglass and a scrap piece of metal a friend of mine got from work. The ""pulleys"" are just 100 yard fishing line spools. I left the line on because I plan on using it later on. I also have a rope to raise and lower it (not pictured). I didn't need it to help me turn. I just needed something to keep me straight. This is why I went for a stationary rudder (or skeg if you want to call it that).  After having issues the first couple times on the water I looked into home made fixes. The reviews for this boat also mirror my experience with it, so I didn't feel too bad with the addition."

Kayaking,3899jx,nittanyvalley,4,Wed Jun 3 02:54:42 2015 UTC,Grew up on Lake Murray and was out there this past weekend tubing with my family. The water was the clearest I have ever seen it. It's a really great lake. The litter on the islands is just awful though.
Kayaking,3899jx,moscomule,2,Tue Jun 2 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we saw some litter when we were out there. We didn't have any bags to clean it up though. I'll probably bring a trash bag with me next time."
Kayaking,38bc98,1_EYED_MONSTER,3,Wed Jun 3 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"OK, this is GENERALLY SPEAKING because everything in hull design is a compromise but one given is that short boats have to be wide to be stable and that makes them slow because they have a lot of wet surface area.   I have spent some time researching this with computer models and a 15 foot hull, assuming it is typical shape and width, is going to be the sweet spot for most paddlers.  Longer hulls will have more high speed potential but slightly higher resistance in the 2-4 mph range where most paddle.  When you get shorter the width has to go up and resistance starts to increase very quickly. Just to be clear, it is actually the water line length, not overall length that matters but that information is not typically available.  Yes, there can be /probably are exceptions to this and that is why I say generally speaking.  That said, I would be watching for used boat to come up around 15' overall length."
Kayaking,38bc98,Kudzupatch,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:07:23 2015 UTC,What is causing the extra resistance when you get a longer hull and narrower beam? I remember reading up on hull speed and being limited by a boat's bow wave but I don't remember how that relates to water line and width.
Kayaking,38bc98,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:51:28 2015 UTC,"Never really looked at why, but I suspect it is wetted surface area starts going up after about 15 feet. That is probably the biggest single factor. I don't claim to have a great understanding of how all this works. I have read a lot and while I understood what they were saying it is hard to apply it all."
Kayaking,38bc98,Kudzupatch,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, so do you think this makes sense - when the waterline increases past 15 ft, the amount of surface area in the water is larger than that sweet spot and creates more drag due to friction than the benefit of a longer water line benefitting speed.   It makes me wonder though, cause surf skis are damn long. A lot of them around 18 ft, and they have almost the entire length as their waterline. They have straight bows and the rudder is exactly at the end of the boat. I guess since they're so extremely narrow they have very little surface area in the water, while using their long waterline to their advantage and therefore get tremendous speed and tracking. The downside is how hard they are to keep upright. Does that make sense?"
Kayaking,38bc98,KayakHipster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:24:47 2015 UTC,While I have never really looked a Surf Ski numbers I think your line of thinking is right on. As I said everything in designing a hull is a compromise and they focus on making them fast and compromise on the other aspects. Of course the engines in most Ski's aren't average either and that is the biggest aspect. A good paddler can move a bad boat pretty fast.
Kayaking,38bc98,Kudzupatch,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"Basically looking for what I can get locally and don't have a ton of choices. I've got a Dick's, Gander, Dunham's, and a local place that sells Necky kayaks. Some models I've glanced at are the Perception Conduit 13 (or 12), Necky Rip 12, and Pelican Maverick 120x."
Kayaking,38bc98,dispatch00,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:22:54 2015 UTC,"Of those retailers, I didn't see any compelling deals, but given those choices I'd go with the Conduit 12/13.  Decent price, and I like Perception.  If you had a couple more dollars to spend, and could find somewhere to ship it to you for free (sometimes amazon or backcountry have shipping deals) I'd personally recommend the Dagger Axis 12.5.  I own the 10.5 version and I absolutely love it."

Kayaking,387ljq,mobius_sp,2,Tue Jun 2 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Wekiva Springs is a beautiful place. I've taken the family there once or twice; not for kayaking (we are interested in kayaking, but haven't made the plunge yet) but the canoeing was pretty nice as I recall.  If I might suggest: Blue Springs isn't very far from Wekiva Springs, and is likewise a nice place to paddle. I think it's perhaps 40 minutes, plus or minus. You have some great places to roam around in the center of the state."
Kayaking,38alrw,gzoztra,2,Tue Jun 2 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Generally yes.  But...  It's a good idea to check the forecast and weather websites to see if there is a chance of thunderstorms, or if their are any thunderstorms in the area.  Lightning doesn't always strike right beneath a thunderstorm- it can arc out miles to any side of it.  Also, hypothermia can be an issue in many areas at any time of year (even in summer) if you're out in sustained rainfall, especially if you're out on the water.  Make sure you've got extra synthetic layers in a dry bag, just in case.  Also, even if you're the type that typically has their PFD in the boat but not on, you may want to consider wearing it when paddling in the rain, just in case."
Kayaking,38alrw,DSettahr,2,Tue Jun 2 23:45:55 2015 UTC,Be mindful of watersheds and how they drain. Know how to read river gauges and what levels are appropriate for your skill level. You don't want to get stuck on a river while it's flashing. High water increases the risk factors exponentially.
Kayaking,38alrw,nittanyvalley,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:12:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't.  I've always feared that my paddle would act as a lightning rod.
Kayaking,38alrw,GoliathPrime,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:58:17 2015 UTC,"By the time it hits you, lightning has already traveled hundreds of feet through an excellent insulator (air).  I doubt that the material your paddle is made of is really going to make that much of a difference."
Kayaking,38alrw,DSettahr,0,Wed Jun 3 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"i worry about rising water levels when it rains, but i've always felt like a river is the safes place to be in a thunderstorm because you're at the lowest point you can get to.  i could be completely wrong, but it makes me worry less when the thunder starts rolling in."
Kayaking,38alrw,kayakerjosh,3,Wed Jun 3 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"Except that when you're on the water, you're the tallest point around- especially if you're on a larger body of water.  And if you're on a smaller stream or river, it is important to keep in mine that lightning tends to flow downhill after it strikes, like water.  I've alwasy been taught that the safest place to be during a thunderstorm is a bump on the side of a hill- something that sticks out just enough that any current flowing through the ground will be deflected aside, but not with enough prominence that it would become a target itself."

Kayaking,384bia,drew1111,3,Tue Jun 2 01:32:48 2015 UTC,What concerns me is that the engineers designing that roof (I'm assuming it's a removable piece) made the connection there to be strong enough to keep the removable piece in place. Not to withstand the massive pressure that kayak's side wall will generate against 50-70 mph winds.   I would keep that setup only for back roads where wind won't be an issue. That's just me though.

Kayaking,386f0k,quickkayakquestion,6,Tue Jun 2 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"Plus, sometimes I get crazy about being tracked   Maybe you should take the tinfoil hat off and read how GPS actually works, especially a dedicated GPS device.   I don't really want GPS because that uses overall distance rather than how far I've gone taking the current into account.   Huh?"
Kayaking,386f0k,nittanyvalley,5,Tue Jun 2 05:20:05 2015 UTC,"Seriously. If you have a Facebook, ""the man"" is already getting all they need out of you. They don't want to know how slowly you paddle around the local lake."
Kayaking,386f0k,doplebanger,3,Tue Jun 2 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"Additionally, GPS satellites don't track/receive your position. They only broadcast a signal.  GPS receivers use the signal from multiple satellites (usually 4 or more) to calculate your location, using trilateration. All of the math and data behind your location is done locally, on your handheld GPS receiver. Whether or not you broadcast your position (via smartphone or other comm radio) is up to you."
Kayaking,386f0k,nittanyvalley,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:22:54 2015 UTC,"I get what he's saying about the overall distance and current.  For example, if, according to the GPS, he were paddling 4 mph upstream against a current that was going 2 mph downstream, then in an hour he'd have paddled the equivalent of 6 miles but the GPS would only register 4."
Kayaking,386f0k,DSettahr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:19:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be a device that can track every single current we'll be around as we kayak and calculate it into our paddle numbers. I think it comes down to getting an accurate trip recording via gps and then doing the math if needed to calculate total miles paddled. As kayakers we should always know currents and tides, so it shouldn't be a big deal to do afterwards anyway.   I'm sure big ships have things like this, but being able to track every little stream that's affected by the tides sounds to me like an insane endeavor.   Maybe it's already out there and I can kindly show myself out."
Kayaking,386f0k,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't see the point. You've got other factors like wind, surface flow rate (which is variable with water levels), etc.   I don't see why a heart rate monitor, a stopwatch, and GPS can't get you all the info you need to figure out how hard you're working. Or put one of those accelerometer-enabled fitness trackers on your wrist to track paddle strokes."

Kayaking,386f0k,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, this totally does exist. Nielson Kellerman makes it, it's a little impeller on the bottom of your boat, designed for rowing shells but should also work for a kayak, although I've never seen any kayaks/canoes bother (we stuck to GPS's, I was the only one excited by this, and even then, not enough to drop the money).  http://www.nkhome.com/rowing-sports-products/rowing-performance/speedcoach-gps-model-2  It is slightly pricey, but is significantly more aero than wearing a tinfoil hat while doing a time control. (Also it totally has a GPS in it)  Edit:   If you want to be really McGyver you can just buy the impeller for $30, and then figure out how to read it (This probably requires actual electronics knowledge).   http://www.nkhome.com/rowing-sports-products/replacement-parts/speedcoach-impeller"
Kayaking,386f0k,moosekayak,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. So the impeller would essentially tell us how much we paddled taking into consideration if we're actually paddling with or against the current.   So then essentially the only thing we wouldn't be able to add into the equation is wind. Unless someone gets one of these, mounts it in front of their helmets and connects it via Bluetooth.   Ambient Weather WM-2 Handheld Weather Meter w/ Windspeed, Temperature, Wind Chill https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DF9VUC/  Haha, with so much prep and data, I'd forget to paddle. I can see the gps and impeller being very useful for people specifically training for races though."
Kayaking,386f0k,KayakHipster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:51:20 2015 UTC,"So you want to log distance with water speed,  direction,  wind speed?  You could make a plc log this type of data from sensors,  but accuracy and durability would be difficult to both have cheap.   Why not make / buy a paddle stroke counter?   Wouldn't that give you the basics of what you're after?  Edit: This is $225, but it integrates with some GPS. http://www.vaakacadence.com/store/products/vaaka-rowing-cadence-x2/"

Some of the spots we were in were very shallow (knee-waist deep). To get nice power from the GP I like using a somewhat high angle and was worried about bottoming out with it.

Kayaking,382qg3,jahallah,2,Mon Jun 1 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"1.) Universal. There are methods i learned based on the rack system I've used  to make my life easier, but that is more like practice makes perfect. I can tell you the book tells you the safest way to use the straps,  follow it, so many  times I've seen people over-kill this and it can adversely effect the security of the tie downs.  What rack system do you have?  2.) I don't , not sure what you mean by crate, but I prepare to get soaked every time I yak anyway and have a dry box / bag for anything water-sensitive.  3.) on the interstate with foam blocks is not too great. defienitely front ad rear  (bow and stern ) tie downs plus the two  on the cross bars. Like this  Then be sure to get these, making your life easier  I've seen them sold at home depot for 10 bucks each. just make sure the rope is long enough.   4.)Nope, sorry. No idea. But I will say this,  be sure to get a whistle, a plastic kayak whistle that won't rust. Airhorns are great but they rust quickly and become useless. plastic whistle will last forever.  5.) I have a tarpon 160 and love it, footpegs are for stability, be sure you can comfortably reach them.  I would get the cheapest saddles you can find. I bought my thule on sale for like $60 and they have lasted me 5 years.

I have a Wilderness Systems Tarpon 140 which I find to be perfect for fishing out of. Brand new it's something like $1100, however don't let that discourage you. Check craigslist, check local kayak shops, etc. If you're patient you will find amazing deals even if it requires a 20-30 mile drive.  I purchased my kayak from a local kayak shop that also rents kayaks all summer long, in the winter they sell off their rental fleet at about 50% off which is when I picked up my yak.  Something else to keep in mind is the cost of the peripherals. You NEED a PFD, and your shoulders, arms, and core will thank you if you spend more than $50 on a paddle."

Kayaking,381qb8,ArkasCaliGirl,2,Mon Jun 1 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"We've had two inflatables and we love them. With the ones I've seen, there is no way that a branch, rock, etc would puncture it. Our newer one is a sea eagle and on the website you can see them hitting the boat with a screwdriver and hammer and not puncture it - after owning that boat for 3 years I completely believe it. We've dragged it, done whitewater, and definitely hit lots of branches. Make sure you get a good quality one - not a toy. We really love our sea eagle (a FastTrack, but not the same model they have now - it looks more like their current explorer. Before that we had an Innova helios which was good, the valves started to malfunction after about 12 years. We could probably have fixed it but we were ready for something new. If you want advice on choosing one I'd be happy to help. Inflatables are very comfortable, very stable,  very versatile, and extremely convenient. The disadvantage, in general, is that they are slower in the water (but there are interesting newer models that might challenge that)."
Kayaking,381qb8,paradox50,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:46:47 2015 UTC,"I bought an inflatable one for my wife because she is clumsy. I love her but she does not get the balancing of a rigid kayak. I tried to teach her but she kept dumping it. Inflatable kayaks are very forgiving and is a great way to get into the sport. Rigid kayaks are either wide and short or long and narrow or a combination if the two. i like the rigid kayaks because I can control them better, but get out and test them both and see what you like."

The Mirage peddle drive system is an absolute blast, so easy to fish while pumping with your legs. It's more expensive than most inflatables, but I have no fear of puncturing the material. http://www.hobiecat.com/mirage/mirage-i9s/"
Kayaking,3839fy,MountainMan90,2,Mon Jun 1 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"for first timers its probably a great boat. but if you are looking to delve deeper i would recommend at least a 12 ft. if you are near the ocean, you want nothing less than a 14 pref 15 ft.  What type of kayaking do you want to do"

But I'm still a full time student and work a ton so the amount of time I have available will probably be limited to afternoons and the rare weekend. I used a 12ft not too long ago and it was wonderful but a lot of the kayaks in that size range are a little out of budget so when I saw a 10ft for $200 I got pretty excited knowing that I could buy a paddle and a life-vest with the money I would be saving via this sale"
Kayaking,3839fy,KayakHipster,2,Mon Jun 1 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, keep in mind the pelican you're referring to is only designed for very very calm lakes and extremely slow moving water. So no real rivers or big lakes, and certainly not the ocean.   Browse through the sub on descriptions on what boat is good for what - or just check online for descriptions on how to pick a boat. You have recreational ones (like the pelican you mention) for calm waters, sea kayaks for coastal kayaking, WW boats for fast moving rivers, and sit on tops can be specific for certain needs as well.   That way you can decide what boat to look at depending on what you want to do."

Kayaking,3839fy,razrielle,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have that specific kayak but I have one that's very similar. It's not a very fast boat, it doesn't track very well so you may have to put in a little extra effort to make it go strait, and it doesn't hold much gear. On the plus side, it's easily maneuverable, it's very light, easy to get on top of a car, very stable, and it's as close to indestructible as you can get. If you're looking for something for slow moving streams or small rivers then it should do the trick, but if you're looking at water that's a little larger or faster flowing then you'll end up fighting against it. If you're looking to do an overnight trip then you'll want something with more storage.  I'm far from an expert but I would say, for that price, it's a pretty good deal if you're only looking for something to get you on the water for a couple hours. It may also be worth looking for used kayaks in your area, you might be able to get a good deal on a boat that would normally have a higher price tag."

Kayaking,3805f2,nvertedflyer,2,Sun May 31 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"After getting caught in a deluge last week and only seeing the south end of Shingle Creek Paddle Trail, we decided to go check out the north end today.  It wasn't as tight and technical as the south end, but was still good fun for us beginners.    This time around we all got our own 'yaks instead of doing the tandems.  We rented the 12' Emotion AdvantEdge.  Seemed like a decent little boat, but that seat has gotta go.  Too low and at the wrong angle, which after googling it, turns out to be a common complaint with that specific boat.  They offer classes at the Shingle Creek Paddle Center for things like wet exits and self rescues and rolls, so I think that I'm going to attend a few to learn how to do these things the right-ish way before I buy my own kayak.  And of course, when doing things as a family, buying my own kayak will eventually mean buying five.  Think about that if you're considering having kids...lol.  ;-)  Edit:  Forgot to mention, I got a little too close to the turtle in one of the pictures, which startled him.  He got scared and tried to jump in the water, but didn't see where my boat was and accidentally jumped in it, which startled me.  Got him back in the water and off he swam.  Who said turtles are slow?"
Kayaking,381xzs,Noumenon72,4,Mon Jun 1 07:05:12 2015 UTC,I hold it with my whole hand. If you have a death grip on the paddle that's bad but two fingers doesn't sound too lite a touch to me

Kayaking,381xzs,moosekayak,2,Tue Jun 2 13:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thumb and one finger is excessively loose, but yes, you should have your pinky off the paddle.   So find your trusty broomstick (or your actual paddle if it's close at hand). Grab it like your paddle, and put yourself into the set up position - your bottom arm straight, your top arm is bent at ~90, upper arm level to the ""water"" (living room carpet), lower arm approaching vertical. Keep that arm in position, and try:   holding paddle with all four fingers - see how you wrist moves not using pinky and relaxing ring finger - see how the wrist can stay neutral holding paddle with all four fingers and keeping wrist neutral - and this pulls your top arm out of a strong set up position and gets you ready to rush your top arm forward (which then makes your paddle angle go negative too soon).    Now take your broompaddle and brace it against something (ie: similar body position as at the catch). Try to pull from the hip and feel a stretch in your lat, then switch to pulling from the lat. You should find that generating the pull starting at the hip (and feeling your lat stretch like a bungee cord) feels stronger. Remember that feeling, and the next time you're on the water, try a pause drill (stroke, set up, count ""1...2...3..."" stroke, set up, count ""1..2...3..""), really focusing on accelerating the paddle after the catch, by feeling the stretch through your lat from your driving pull-side hip. Catch at a normal speed or else you're just going to hammerthe catch and not work on the hip connection.  As your paddle reaches mid knee you can start to really think about pulling from the lat again - and by this point you should be able to close your ring finger around the paddle while keeping top hand position."

I'm still going to try that pause drill on the water tomorrow (I've got my Evernote so I can read your post on the lake).   put yourself into the set up position - your bottom arm straight, your top arm is bent at ~90, upper arm level to the ""water"" (living room carpet)   The top arm's forearm is coming in front of my face, also level to the carpet?

The design was apparently by some Porche engineer.  If I remember correctly the manufacturing was changed to China from somewhere in Europe.  A few things over the years that I have picked up while paddling with and in that kayak.  A very fast kayak. The bow is like a razor blade.  Can stow a huge amount of gear quite comfortably.   Struggles when stowing gear on top, which might not be an issue for some but we like to strap on Coolers and chairs fishing gear and guitar etc. So not great top heavy.  Easy to get in and out of from shore. Not sure about while one is  mid-water.  Not sure about pre-Chinese manufacture but it is crappy fibreglass with hulls so thin that sunlight barely has a problem passing through.  A few small leaks between hulls.  Rudder was demountable and has a horizontal skeg.  Rudder cables are thin fibre rather than stainless steel.  The firbreglass body is very, very fragile. Takes very little to put a dent in it. (Those star/web shaped dings)  The paintwork rubs off with no effort.  Has a compass slot in front of cockpit.  Not that great in choppy water.  Not great in windy conditions.  Really, really fast on flat water.  This was the cheaper fibre-glass version. It also came in a carbon composite material but after the shoddy construction in fibre-glass, I would not personally hold too much faith in a carbon/composite build from this company."

Kayaking,37wrdo,planification,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"Black bears are more pests than anything.  They'll try to get into anything that smells, but often run away at the sight of a human.  If you were in the position of killing one, you'd want a high caliber rifle, not a handgun.  But you shouldn't put yourself in that position.  Hang your scented items, and if you see one, back calmly away."
Kayaking,37wrdo,WeazelBear,1 point,Sun May 31 03:01:39 2015 UTC,I keep all of my food in a dry bag which I hang from a tree limb a good distance from my tent at night.  I think I need to do a little research about black bear encounters because I have heard conflicting advice from people.  Some people have said to stand your ground and make as much noise as possible.  And others have said to back slowly away from the bear.
Kayaking,37wrdo,TopographicOceans,2,Sun May 31 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always heard the saying, ""If it's brown, lay down. If it's black, fight back."" I had an encounter with one face to face in East Tennessee once and luckily had my shotgun on me. She had two cubs near her and bluff charged me, I shot the ground in front of me and she ran about 20 yards away, but kept her eye on me until I was gone. As far as a gun, it isn't necessary. Maybe get some spray and you'll be okay. They're fairly small creatures, but they can attack you if you don't respect their space or if they're hungry."
Kayaking,37wrdo,Thechubbyprotestant,1 point,Sun May 31 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure a pistol is very effective against a black bear. ""Best"" case scenario is you wound him. Worst case is you just piss him off."

Kayaking,37wrdo,NiceGunMrBurton,3,Sun May 31 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"You should carry bear spray in my opinion. Bears which are accustomed to certain camp sites can be dangerous, even black bears, and there are plenty of them of NC."
Kayaking,37wrdo,pedalpaddlehike,2,Mon Jun 1 16:10:22 2015 UTC,I used to own a pistol but I sold it when my son was old enough that I would need to keep it locked up.  I was thinking about getting some bear spray.  I was thinking that anything that could deter bears would deter people too and would not require cleaning after every camping trip.  With the additional bonus of being much cheaper.

Kayaking,37x6ry,zebra301,2,Sun May 31 03:38:58 2015 UTC,"Crossfire's a great boat! But yeah it's definitely meant for whitewater. By whitewater standards it'll track well and is relatively stable.   Granted I'm a whitewater paddler so this is just guessing, but by recreational standards it's probably considered tippy and constantly spinning out (as all whitewater boats are).  If you do have any interest in whitewater, especially if you are on a budget, this is a perfectly good boat if you want one boat to do both flatwater and whitewater.  Other thing to consider is that the cockpit rim might be relatively close to the waterline, so you may want to wear a sprayskirt when you paddle it."
Kayaking,37x6ry,captain_manatee,1 point,Sun May 31 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'd stay off whitewater in the crossfire. It's an old boat, you don't know how it's been stored -- the plastic could have degraded, which could up the sketch significantly."
Kayaking,37x6ry,Eloth,2,Sun May 31 09:59:59 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really thought of that, although in my experience old dagger plastic holds up pretty well. Only boat I've seen fail catastrophically was a jackson that had been left in the sun for years.

I think the spray kit might be a good idea I'll see if I can find a one on ebay.  I live in Ohio so not much white water here, I'm a beginner and white water is not really my goal.  I was going to buy a Cabella's or other standard cheap boat but this one popped up on craigslist, if I hate it I don't have a lot invested.  If I love kayaking I'll buy a better recreational one next season."

Kayaking,37wj8b,moosekayak,2,Sun May 31 07:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'd also suggest gluing some neoprene (or a mouse pad) under your footboard (ie: where your heels go) because since that's the only surface where you heel is in contact with the hull, it's the most likely to get cold.  Plus it avoids weird heel callouses if you have too much heel slide, although in that case, get a full footboard."
Kayaking,37wj8b,KayakHipster,3,Sun May 31 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"Some thin minicell will do the trick as well. I think in my old kayak I used some thin foam I found at Michaels. It was an 8.5x11 piece, about 1/4"" thick."

Kayaking,37tgqq,Ostirious,3,Sat May 30 06:41:30 2015 UTC,"I had one experience kajaking in the alps in heavy rain. There was one spot where two rivers met and you couldn't see the other stream until you got there. Well, we got home in time, but about an hour later the water level had risen about two meters and turned the usually clear stream into a dangerous brown mass. I don't think even an experienced kajaker could have safely gone down there. You could still kajak down the other river but the dangerous spot was where the two met. If you didn't scout the area beforehand (which we probably wouldn't have done since we thought we knew the area so well) you would find yourself in an unexpectedly difficult river. Luckily, a lot of people gathered at the shore to look at the water and waved and shouted at any people unknowingly kajaking down the calmer stream. Apparently, the water level was the highest it had been in many years so even some locals had never seen anything like it.  So, always be careful. Unusually heavy rains can change a river in ways you would not expect. When in doubt if it's safe to continue, always stop."
Kayaking,37tgqq,anyonesany,1 point,Sat May 30 07:26:35 2015 UTC,"I kayak in the rain on the ocean all the time. Just need a spray skirt on your yak, a dry top, a waterproof cap or hat, and no glasses and it's totally fine. Nowadays I have a drysuit with a built in hood which makes it even more convenient.   I'm surprised you were kayaking without a bilge pump in the first place, not sure about your area but that is illegal here."
Kayaking,37tgqq,kisielk,2,Sat May 30 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"I never kayak with a bilge pump, nor is it required. But, I'm kayaking rivers, not open water."

Kayaking,37tgqq,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Sat May 30 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"A little rain is no big deal. Flash flooding can be a serious problem though. I have seen small creeks turn into raging rivers in 30 minutes. Flood waters are extremely dangerous, especially when trees are being uprooted and tumbling through the water. Being caught in a summer shower on a lake is not too bad. Use caution and watch the weather."

Also get some good racheting straps for you to tie it to your car with. Wider boats need longer paddles usually. Tandem boats =divorce boats. And wear lots and lots of sun screen and get some cheep cheep shades and Eyewear retainers.  Ziplock Plastic bags or those cheep advertised electronics bags are not  waterproof. Don't ever put your electronics in there. Get a small pelican case or otter box that is water proof. Same thing for trash bags and clothing or grear. Get the fold over round bottomed waterproof bags. Always have extra water and a change of clothing. Mosquitos are an issue close to shore ( your not going miles out in open water as a newbe) bring bug spray and shoes in case you have to get out of your boat when and where you did not expect.   Keep asking yourself ""if I tip over can I swim that far to shore with my boat?""  Get out of the water well before it storms.  ALWAYS WEAR your life jacket (pfd). Don't ever store it on such a small boat. Don't go out alone and have some fun."

Weather was 70's and clear with 10-20mph winds though in protected waters with some wind break -- which made for good testing of weathercocking.  I stayed focused on the Petrel and played with both the Stitch and Glue and the Strip Plank version. Both performed very similarly, although the strip plank version doesn't have rubber hatches so is several pounds lighter and you can feel the difference in the responsiveness of the kayak.  My first impression was the weight. The S&G should be about 40 pounds, which is 20 pounds lighter than my tempest and carrying it to the water was a pleasure. Next came the initial stability. This boat has a 20"" beam and felt stable as a rock. I was actually a bit taken back by that. It also fits my body much better than the Tempest. Naturally snug to my hips, plenty of leg/foot room even with my size 12 feet.   Being light and narrow, I did not have to muscle it at all to lean, edge, or roll. Instead I had to tone down my movements to stop over-correcting etc. The back deck is low enough to lay flat out, but does have enough height to still weathercock in the strong winds we had. I'd still like a lower deck behind me I think. Dropping the skeg allowed for an amazing improvement in tracking in the wind. On edge you could basically spin like a top, which felt really nice in a 17 foot boat.  Overall I was very impressed and pleased. I spoke with Nick Schade (designer) about the flow at the workshop to build them (I am not --yet-- skilled enough to trust myself to do it solo), and he noted that they no longer use the first day to stain due to build complexity and time constraints. That means the finished product will have zero stain and be the natural (light) Okoume plywood color. I have to figure out if I can get the CLC shop to work with me around that and get the kit stained prior to the workshop, or if the aesthetic issue is a deal breaker for me.  If nothing else, I've come to realize that any boat I get next will have no more than an 18"" beam!"
Kayaking,37pj3g,Binasaur,2,Fri May 29 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"Here's a great article about the different types of kayaks and what they're good for: http://m.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/kayak.html  This part addresses your question:   Length: Shorter kayaks, like recreational ones, are easier to turn and maneuver. Longer kayaks are easier to paddle over long distances and hold a straight line better to stay on course. If transporting a kayak is a concern, shorter kayaks are less cumbersome than longer ones."
Kayaking,37pj3g,c0r3yz,2,Fri May 29 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'm reposting this answer from another thread with the same question. Btw, I had the zephyr 155 and loved it.   .   The longer the boat is, the better it'll track (straighter it'll go) and the faster the cruising speed it'll have.   The longer it is, usually means it'll be able to take more cargo.   Now, long vs short doesn't affect tall vs short people or cargo completely. Usually most models will be made in a high volume and low volume version. For example, the tsunami 145 mentioned above, is the higher volume version that'll fit bigger people and take slightly more cargo. Smaller people will go with a 140 version. The boats are made to fit average leg sizes as well as having its buoyancy set for a specific weight range.   Ok, now, to answer another one of your questions - shorter boats are easier to maneuver. That doesn't mean you can't turn a 17 footer easily. Edging helps to turn long boats. But if you're in narrow and winding creeks, full of gear, I'd recommend going shorter.   No one boat does everything well. Longer will be faster and carry more stuff. Shorter will be more maneuverable but slower. So, it's up to you to pick what you want to do first, list pros and cons and then decide what type of boat you want.   Let us know what you decide paddling wise and we can try giving you some advice to what models can fit those parameters."

I'm 6' 2"" and 250 lbs and an experienced kayaker.  I love the Zephyr 160 because it is long enough for open ocean paddling (day trips) but nimble enough for fairly small streams and rivers.  It has a decent amount of rocker so it turns well with just a bit of lean.  It also has a drop skeg if you want more tracking - but I seldom find that I need it.  It rolls really well, when you have the cockpit fitted to you.  It's a very versatile boat.   I found them just a bit short in legroom when I bought them so I fitted them out with new footpegs and rails that moved the pegs forward a few inches."

Understanding how to read water and how hydrology works is one of the biggest things that recreational kayakers, as a whole, lack. Whitewater kayakers learn this due to the nature of the sport.  Here is an excellent video explaining this phenomenon and why it is so dangerous: http://youtu.be/XsYgODmmiAM  The dam in the video above is especially dangerous because the boil line is very far from the dam, and the water is moving backwards quite quickly."
Kayaking,37k2ol,sanderlexander,3,Thu May 28 19:19:10 2015 UTC,I think it's all the time. It's due to there not being any obsticals or rocks for the water to flow around. So the entire length of the dam is a big circulating current. There are no natural places for the water to flow out of the current so people get stuck .

Kayaking,37hd5r,SamLynn79,2,Sun May 31 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you did better than I did then. I went in there for the memorial day sale when I saw the Boost 100 Angler was $120 off, bringing the price down to $229. I saw that on the website while I was at work at around 3:00am. I went to the store when they opened seven hours later at 10:00, and the price was now $299, only $50 off. Interestingly, when I opened up the web browser on my phone, it still showed the price at $229. I showed it to the manager, and then asked why there was a $70 price difference. The store manager tried to make up several bullshit excuses, telling me that online prices are often cheaper because of shipping. I wasn't buying that, it was obviously something he made up on the spot because he didn't know why. Unfortunately when I refreshed the page on my phone, the price was updated to $299. I showed it to him, and he realized that the sale ended that morning. I ended up buying the regular Boost 100 for $229 instead of the Boost 100 Angler, seeing as the only difference was a pair of $12 fishing rod holders which I ended up installing myself.  Thinking back, I should have just left instead of giving him and his store my business after the BS he tried to pull with his excuses. But, that being said, I'm happy with my kayak.

I was calling the last store that I was willing to drive to, asked to see if they had any red Maverick 100x kayaks in stock, only to be hung up on multiple times by the guy in the kayak section who didn't want to do his job. Went in personally and found the thing right there on the shelf. Had to call a manager over to get everything sorted out. He offered me a pretty good, all inclusive deal that gave me the boat, paddles, and PFD (which I was going to buy all of them anyways since I didn't have any to begin with) at a good price. He probably lost money on me but figured customer satisfaction was more important in hopes of me coming back in again to spend more money later.  I would have taken my business elsewhere, but it seems that Pelican is a Dick's exclusive brand. But, hey! What can you do?  How do you like fishing in your kayak?

I knew there were better options out there, but again, I didn't have a lot of money. The only thing that I had experience with before were the even lower end kayaks that my college uses for their kayak rental service that charge me $25 each time I want to take it down the Cuyahoga river.  I understood what I was getting when I paid for it, and I really enjoy this little guy. Even though I was pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel. I didn't know if I wanted to continue kayaking, and it's much easier to say I don't like it and lose out on a $230 boat vs losing out on a $500+ boat. If I continue to enjoy myself, I may upgrade next year or the year after.  It's the same way with me learning how to play guitar. My first one was a no name that I bought for $60 from a local dealer. It didn't sound all that great, but it was a guitar and got me started. Then later, as I got better and liked it more, I bought a Fender for about $800. I highly doubt anyone's first guitar is going to be a big name $700+ instrument. Same thing with kayaks, I assume. Most of my friends actually started out with sun dolphin aruba 10s, so yeah."

Kayaking,37hd5r,penis_lad_man,2,Wed May 27 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely nothing wrong with a pelican. I started with one myself.  The true problem with Pelicans can be their users. Often times people that want to get into the sport will see how accessible it is with a pelican, and believe that they can then take these kayaks anywhere. Fast moving water, coastal trips, etc. essentially, people can grab a boat, pfd and paddle and hit the water without a single drop of safety precautions. Usually when you buy a higher end kayak, the store clerks will be instructors themselves, or guides, and try to advise buyers (especially beginners) on where to take their boats.   Places like dicks and Walmart, they just want you to make the purchase. So as I've learned through the years about safety, paddled with clubs and moved on to more advanced boats, I see more and more people paddling boats in places they should not be venturing.   I wish places where Pelicans are sold would simply inform what these entry level boats are designed to do. Nothing wrong with the boats having limitations, but simply having their new owners being aware of them would ensure a safer paddling community."
Kayaking,37hd5r,My_Empty_Wallet,1 point,Wed May 27 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"I understand. I've kayaked multiple times before at my local college on the Cuyahoga river at sections that are typically very calm. However, they're only open on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. After doing some research (boat types, hull types, stability, PFDs, etc.), I decided that I would buy this low end pelican so that I can kayak on the Cuyahoga whenever I wanted and also on my local lake which is extremely calm. I'm not the kind of guy to kayak out in the open ocean, on a huge lake like Lake Erie, or do white water kind of stuff. I simply do this as a hobby for relaxation. I understand the limitations of my boat, and I don't plan on exceeding them.  I do get what you're saying, though. When I went into Dick's, the guy who was helping me basically was like, ""Yeah, man. These are kayaks. The more expensive ones are better, but I can't tell you why since I don't know."" I believe that Dick's employees are more like Wal-mart ones in which their primary job is to keep stock high rather than have the knowledge to sell. This is actually really dangerous when it comes to kayaking because people who don't know the limitations of the boats that they're buying can really get themselves into some terrible situations."

But like you said, you did the research. Lots of people don't and that can prove dangerous. We get a mix in this sub of people that will take the time to learn, and others that don't.   I remember when we bought ours from dicks, the dude had nothing to say about safety, gear, or where to use them. He pretty much said ""let me know which one you want to get, and we have a deal on pfd and paddles too.""   When we bought our sea kayaks, the owners of the store were instructors, we took lessons, and made sure we understood what we were getting into. I just wish rec boats got the same treatment."

Kayaking,37h731,hack_jalsey,1 point,Wed May 27 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"The American Legion Post, just outside of the Village, in East Aurora. It's a quick paddle, about 45 min before the creek is blocked and you have to turn around. It's really quiet and calm though. I've found that the best way to put in there is by walking out onto the damn and putting your boat in there."
Kayaking,37h731,hack_jalsey,1 point,Wed May 27 18:11:31 2015 UTC,Word. I'll definitely give that a shot.
Kayaking,37j0e8,My_Empty_Wallet,2,Wed May 27 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"I think they are all interesting... Honestly, the best gopro videos I've seen are ones with multiple angles that flip between perspectives, and are timed with the music. check out /r/gopro and you'll see some good videos. Granted, they may not be all kayak related, but they tend to follow the same ""montage"" feel."
Kayaking,37j0e8,brianle37,1 point,Thu May 28 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Head mount is best. Chest and kayak mount are too low. Only good view from mounted to kayak is if it's pointed back at you on bow (only good for small periods of time, long videos like this are bad), or stern mounted and high."
Kayaking,37j0e8,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 28 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"I also subscribe to /r/gopro and its alright but there isn't a lot of support for paddling there. It's fine if you're snowboarding but that's about it. Occasionally a whitewater kayaker will show up but it's always the same view strapped to the head.  So maybe I'll keep my clamp and also take my gopole out with me as well.   Would I be shooting myself in the foot by slapping an adhesive mount on a paddle blade?  Maybe I can put a mount on a piece of nylon webbing and wrap it around the boat, so I can slide the gopro underwater then retrieve it..."
Kayaking,37j0e8,brianle37,2,Thu May 28 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see you point on that. Kayaking tends to be a bit more... mellow.   I've always found head mounts to be a bit erratic as your head tends to move around a bit while you paddle. I would not use an adhesive mount on the paddle blade. perhaps a pole mount to the paddle shaft would work.   A flush mount fishing pole holder ($7) is worth it if you are willing to cut into your kayak. I think my take would be to have a pole set towards the back of the kayak, and the gopro pointing forward and slightly down. a sort of third person elevated view. This should give you a nice wide view, the kayak will give some stability in the shot, and you get to show off your pretty face. That along with some first person shots, a side mounted shot, and maybe a shot pointing back at you.   Just take a lot of angles, and figure out what you like best. I always try to keep it pretty varied.  Either way... you have a kayak and a gopro... most folks would be jealous of just that alone. Happy shooting!"
Kayaking,37j0e8,Tomagone,1 point,Thu May 28 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"A sticky mount on the bow with the camera pointing at you looks really cool. On your head or chest can work quite well, then we can see what you're seeing!"

Some people say that drinking a can of coke afterwards (or something) offsets the chance of getting an infection... I'm not sure there's any medical basis for this, but it can't hurt.  Wear earplugs and a noseclip if you're going to be capsizing frequently. Sinus infections are bad, and exostosis of the ear canal is something you really want to avoid."

I have even done river trips on days they were checking ecoli levels in the water and found them to be high. With that said, there are some drops that divers use to clean some crap out of their ears after dives. Not a bad idea if you take a swim in a questionable place.   I have honestly never worried much about it. You might ask your doctor about the chances of issues or speak with the local biologists to see if they feel comfortable swimming in it."
Kayaking,37iynj,bobbyfiend,2,Wed May 27 23:42:24 2015 UTC,How about a canoe?  In a couple years she can help paddle. And it's got a bit of room and stability for all the squirming around kids do.

Kayaking,37gifa,USMCSSGT,1 point,Wed May 27 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"It can be a long trip for a new paddler. With some current it would be about as much as I would recommend. About my 3rd time out a group took me on a 12 mile paddle and my shoulders hurt so bad on the way home I was near tears!    The problem is, being in good shape doesn't always prepare one for the thousands and thousands of repeat motions you make paddling 8 miles."
Kayaking,37gifa,Kudzupatch,1 point,Wed May 27 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"The problem is, being in good shape doesn't always prepare one for the thousands and thousands of repeat motions you make paddling 8 miles.   Totally agree, which is why I am wondering about the distance.  Do you think that 8 miles with the current moving with us, it will be fairly manageable though?   It sounds like we will be alright if you wen't 4 miles more when you were starting out."
Kayaking,37gifa,BlindlyWatching,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"One thing you really need to consider is if you two will be mainly floating and taking in the scenery or actually paddling your way through to reach the end.   My first kayak trip was a ten mile stretch, but we were more floating with intermittent paddling. I was far from in shape at the time, but I felt fine at the end.   Basically I'd say if you're planning on paddling through go a bit shorter; 4-6 miles. If you're wanting to do a more leisurely paddle, 8 shouldn't be a problem at all."

Just take your time, don't try to rush and power stroke the entire way, you'll wear yourself out in an hour. Take smooth easy strokes, find an easy speed and just cruise it. The difference in speed of a person going super hard paddling like a mad man, and a person taking smooth consistent strokes isn't enough to justify the extra energy being spent. Bring lots of stuff to drink, its hot in Florida and you will get dehydrated, then your arms will cramp up, and then you're screwed. Energy bars, beef jerky, other snacks, bring some and take breaks to refuel"
Kayaking,37dxyw,dragontville,1 point,Tue May 26 22:43:11 2015 UTC,Cool pic. You should consider turning your boats on their sides to reduce the risk of oil-canning the hulls.
Kayaking,37dxyw,dispatch00,1 point,Wed May 27 14:36:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment.  Unfortunately, there's another beam right above the boats so they won't fit if turned sideways.

Kayaking,37csab,BraidedClimber,3,Tue May 26 18:02:32 2015 UTC,That's fantastic.  Where did you put in?  Many rapids?  Did you have to much portaging around dams or low water bridges?
Kayaking,37csab,ArtDSellers,4,Tue May 26 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"So we put in right under the bridge by ""White House"" on Kauffmans Mill Road in Luray. Parked the car overnight. We kayaked about 20 miles and camped at this wonderful person's home that I believe was converted to a campground area called Country Place cabins. They did us an incredible favor by letting us stay only 1 night when they usually require at least 2!   We then started out planning to go another 20 miles the next day, but we learned that the river-front is private property and the National forest starts farther in (not according to Google Maps). We had to press on and go ~40 miles all the way to Front Royal. We made it to Eastham Park where we found really nice people to drive us the ~3 miles to our car that was parked at the VFW. We were so tired and hungry by the end that we just couldn't make it farther!  The rapids were totally manageable even when we got stuck on shallow areas, you just hop a little and the kayaks ride right over! There are hundreds of people who go tubing with outfitters along the ride and they just float over the rapids in tubes!   The only place we had to portage was at the damn. There isn't an official area to portage, so we had to make due with climbing through the woods and going around the damn to the lower edge. But on the left side there was a small rocky area where we could carry each kayak around and put back in at the calm area after the dam falls."

Kayaking,37e61a,PaddlePartner,1 point,Wed May 27 02:25:20 2015 UTC,I spent 3 days on the Neuse River paddling from the Falls of the Neuse Dam to the Town Commons in Smithfield North Carolina. The first day was tough. The river was shallow and I had to get out and drag my kayak numerous times. Then I had to portage about 200 yards around a Dam. I found a decent spot to camp but I woke up to the sound of someone throwing boulders into the river. I stumbled out of my tent to confront the boulder thrower to see a Beaver beating the water into submission with his tail. Day 2 was muuuuuchhhhh better. I woke up to a beautiful morning with a light mist on the river. After the 2nd Dam the river was much deeper and less populated which was nice. The river had a few small rapids which kept things interesting and I found a few nice spots to grab a bite to eat. That evening I found a nice spot to camp and was joined later by a nice couple floating down the river on a small pontoon type boat about the size of a truck bed. I woke up early the next morning and cranked out 10 miles in 2 hours to pull out in Smithfield. I can't wait to put back in and do another 50 miles on the Neuse.

It looks like the style that most Jackson 1 and 1.5s use (both of those are kids boats).  In general, check for cracks, welds, dents, deep gouges, oil canning (not so much of an issue on play boats), and the condition of the outfitting.  Also, if you're looking to get into whitewater, realize what kind of boat you're getting. This is a playboat (well, more river running playboat than a true playboat, but still a playboat). It's got edges and a planing hull. The experience of learning and paddling with one of these will be different than with a true river running boat. It'll be less forgiving to start, but if you're willing to stick with it and get over the learning curve, you'll likely be a better whitewater kayak because of it.  If you're not looking to do whitewater, don't buy this boat. You will hate it."

Kayaking,37b285,ohsnapt,1 point,Tue May 26 08:50:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't speak for inflatables. I have a skin-on-frame Folbot Greenland, but that weighs about 80 lbs when you factor in paddles and kit. They do have the Citibot which should be about 35lbs with all of the kit you'd need. That would be manageable on a bike I should think. The folbot I have is extremely durable, much more than I ever thought it would be. The only thing that has gone wrong with it is that the panels that the sponsons go in came un-glued, but I just glued them back in. Other than that it's been very reliable. I still have the original wilderness kit that is still unused."
Kayaking,37b285,guitbit,1 point,Tue May 26 18:58:47 2015 UTC,yeah 80 lbs is too much. what is set up time like? do you need tools. i am already over the max capacity of the citibot..... maybe that made the decision?

Kayaking,378mi6,JerbaHerba,1 point,Mon May 25 19:43:00 2015 UTC,For your price range and skills level don't look at any major name brands. Buy a fishing style kayak from dicks or basspro or where ever you can find one. Fishing boats are designed to be very stable to avoid roll overs. That being said- they do not roll back over if you tip. You'll get what you put into this sport. 300 bucks this year will find you a starter boat but it will limit what you can do with it. Next year maybe upgrade to something more specific to what you eant
Kayaking,378mi6,batmanorsuperman,1 point,Tue May 26 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Consider used.    Not only are you going to need a kayak, but you'll need a paddle, PFD, rack & straps (or way to transport).  That's not considering any of the other safety gear you could/ should have.  In this sport, $300 isn't really very much & used will take you further.   Also, kayak length has more to do with the type of paddling that you are doing than your size."
Kayaking,378mi6,h20rabbit,1 point,Tue May 26 00:56:59 2015 UTC,I was looking at a Sun Dolphin Aruba 10. Would you recommend this kayak?
Kayaking,378mi6,h20rabbit,3,Tue May 26 05:09:26 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult thing to answer.  For myself, I would not choose this kayak, though that is based on where I typically kayak and my personal knowledge of trying out many types of boats.  It is not based on any knowledge of this boat, or what kind of paddling you prefer.  I will say that shorter boats are typically harder to control on flat water.  Paddling.net usually has pretty good user reviews on a given kayak, here's what they have on this one - http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/showReviews.html?prod=3407  The best advice I got when shopping was to go our and rent, borrow or find an outfitter or club that would let you try as many kayaks as possible.  You'll soon figure out what feels right to you and the paddling you want to do.  It's not the kind of thing you want to hear when eager to get going, but as far as a big purchase like this, it pays off.  It sucks spending hard earned cash on a kayak you end up not loving.    Waiting and trying different boats really is worth it in the end to buy something you know you're going to love being in.  edit: found reviews & added"
Kayaking,378mi6,h20rabbit,0,Tue May 26 05:36:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your time. The way I was thinking was this: I don't kayak much. I'm not a novice, so I know my way around the boat. However, I wouldn't consider myself advanced. I primarily just take these out on local rivers that are extremely mild, and I have a local lake that isn't big at all which is also, generally, very mild. I originally wanted the Perception Sport Conduit 13': http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=32587606&camp=CSE:GooglePLA:32587606:10160887:WATER%20SPORTS&CAGPSPN=pla&CAWELAID=120138600000142752&catargetid=120138600001586826&cadevice=c  However, after totaling everything up (the kayak, paddles, having to buy a rack for my car to hold it, etc) it would have cost me roughly $900. I figured that I would buy a lower end kayak, see how much I actually use it, and then later on down the line, invest in a better kayak. They way I'm thinking is that I currently pay $25 for a rental kayak to go down my local river from Kent State University that only does kayak trips on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Also, KSU uses Perception Acadia 10' kayaks which are, unfortunately, discontinued. With the Aruba 10', after I include all of the things I need, will pay for itself in about 10 to 12 trips with the added benefit of me being able to kayak whenever I want to. I also figure that since I'm use to low end, 10' kayas (because KSU definitely doesn't buy the best in the world, haha) the Sun Dolphin Aruba 10' will be close in performance to the Perception Acadia. What do you think? :)"
Kayaking,378mi6,juliofuego92,1 point,Tue May 26 08:45:20 2015 UTC,"The 13' will handle better as an educated guess, but only paddling it will tell.  The paddling.net review on it is here http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/showReviews.html?prod=2924  Discontinued isn't always a bad thing.  My favorite boat of the 3 I own is probably the oldest.  I picked it up used and paid really not much for it.  It needed some love, deck lines and replacement hatch covers, but I love to take it out, and that's what matters.  Seriously consider used, check craigslist or similar in your area.  See if there is a local club that has classifieds.  If you don't own a PFD, add one to your list.  You'll get way more bang for your buck used."
Kayaking,378mi6,major_wood_num2,1 point,Tue May 26 13:22:27 2015 UTC,I purchased a Future Beach Fusion 124 at Dick's for 200. I am a beginner as well so I know its not the best one but I love it. Ive taken it in the river by me and also a lake. It's definitely a good first kayak for me.
Kayaking,378mi6,KauaiDoc,1 point,Wed May 27 03:04:05 2015 UTC,"I was looking at a Future Beach Fusion 124 at Dick's as well. However, in my region, they have it for $250. I was interested in it since the entire body is one piece, and it's made out of a higher quality plastic than other kayaks at the same price point. I've done a little bit of research and found a good consensus that their customer service leaves much to be desired. At the same time, I've also read that they have a design flaw that causes the stern to become heavy if it takes on too much water and will eventually swamp the kayak if not discovered quickly enough. I don't want to be swamped out in the middle of a lake. I was looking more at a Pelican Trailblazer 10' now.  It's roughly $230 at Dick's. It is a little of a down grade from the Future Beach since it's made from two pieces joined together, and it also has a little lower quality plastic. But the consensus seems to be mostly positive, and many people are choosing that for the first kayak. But I don't know. I'm still doing a lot of research from other brands as well."
Kayaking,379v1a,sillyinfidel,3,Tue May 26 01:25:10 2015 UTC,"If storage is a big concern, there's a folding kayak that fits into a backpack. Cool stuff but pricey. REI has them for about $1000 right now  http://www.orukayak.com/"
Kayaking,379v1a,sillyinfidel,1 point,Tue May 26 04:33:20 2015 UTC,Those look interesting.  But are they durable enough that I wouldn't have to be worried about being near it with hooks?  With an inflatable/folding yak I'm worried I would puncture it and end up swimming to short dragging it behind me.
Kayaking,379v1a,anderlec,3,Tue May 26 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's marine-grade plastic, so I would assume it's the same strength/durability as a regular kayak."

Kayaking,37842s,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 25 20:00:33 2015 UTC,I'm about you're same dimensions and have the Dagger Axis 12 and it's a wonderful boat. Its a crossover so it handles flat water and moving water pretty well. I would also recommend the Wilderness Systems Aspire 105. It has a capacity up 400 lbs and is super comfortable. My wife has it and we both go on lakes and rivers with no issue. I'd highly suggest a demo with a local outfitter if that is an option.

Kayaking,373sqd,tankenka,1 point,Sun May 24 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"For your budget used is probably going to be necessary. New doubles with a rudder start at around $1500 and that will be for something in the 15' range which is basically a recreational boat.   Pelican boats are not exactly quality. If you're dead set on going with a cheap new boat you can add an aftermarket rudder, select designs makes some. They run about $300. Hope that helps."
Kayaking,373sqd,CMBurns,0,Mon May 25 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience with a tandem, but unless the boat has a design problem rudders are not 'necessary'. What can happen is they become a crutch and people never learn to properly paddle and steer their boats. When something happens and the rudder fails, and they do, then they struggle because they don't know how to handle their boat without a rudder."
Kayaking,370v7j,Say_my-name,5,Sat May 23 20:38:47 2015 UTC,In ohio you only need tags if you are a resident. If you aren't then you just need to be legal in your home state. I called them when I visited last year. I'm a ky resident and not required to have tags. They said as long as I had my license as proof of residence I was ok.  Side note: Illinois requires all out of state kayaks (and some tubes) to be registered/tagged for like $70. I never have... Cause screw Illinois.

However, if you want to use it on any of the lakes or streams in State Parks, lakes controlled by US Army Corp of Engineers, or if you want to use boat launches that are maintained by the PA Fish and Boat commission, you are required to have a launch permit sticker ($10/year). However, note that this is good for any lake in any state park (we have 120 state parks), and all of PA's state parks are free admission. Alternatively, you can register your boat, which also covers this launch permit requirement."

Kayaking,370w1x,nittanyvalley,2,Sat May 23 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of adjustable length paddles fail in various ways. I'd get a fixed length for sure. I have a werner tybee and love it. the fit on the two sections is really really good, and you can adjust the feather to any degree you want rather than just straight or 45 like on a lot of paddles"
Kayaking,370w1x,DrRabbitt,1 point,Sat May 23 21:43:42 2015 UTC,+1 for the Tybee. Same one I use and it is fantastic. Werner makes some quality paddles.
Kayaking,370w1x,BigMoose318,2,Mon May 25 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"Those Werner paddles are great.  I paddle a Camano, but they are pricey.  Bending Branches, Carlisle, and AT make nice paddles that are more reasonably priced.  If you want to go cheaper, look at the Skagit, Camano, Kalliste paddles from Werner and then find a cheaper paddle with the same profile.    Paddle length is a function of your size and wingspan.  So, you don't need to have an adjustable paddle unless you plan to get taller.  You should go to a place where a knowledgeable sales rep can help you find the right paddle, i.e. not Dicks, Academy, Sports Authority etc.   Also, if there are multiple REIs in your market only one of them will have the full Water Sports inventory.  Call ahead to figure out which one it is."
Kayaking,370w1x,sjeckard,1 point,Sun May 24 01:21:55 2015 UTC,I have an adjustable because I've got some weird painful thing going on with my elbows. (doc appt pending) It reduces twisting and they feel better after kayaking.
Kayaking,370w1x,misskrumpet,1 point,Sun May 24 03:04:29 2015 UTC,I'd recommend checking out the carbon fiber No Limits paddles from Academy for a starter paddle if you are on a budget. Really great price for carbon fiber. It's been a great paddle for us.

Kayaking,36xtag,redditsucksandsodoyo,1 point,Sat May 23 05:40:27 2015 UTC,"A pfd can extend the amount of time a paddler can last in the water. Essentially allowing you to not worry so much about treading water - so people can focus on re-entry techniques, calling for help, etc etc. it also helps other paddlers get the capsized person back in their boat.   In cold water it's a must. In warm water, it's up to the paddler. I've been taught to try to encourage their use due to statistics pointing to PFDs not being worn. To each their own."
Kayaking,36xtag,KayakHipster,1 point,Sat May 23 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to be blunt: You're an idiot. Over 80% of drownings are people who are not wearing PFD's. Type as much as you want, you can't argue with statistics."
Kayaking,36xtag,redditsucksandsodoyo,2,Sat May 23 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"Apples and oranges. We're talking about boating accidents here, so talking about bathtub and pool drownings doesn't make sense.

Kayaking,36xtag,redditsucksandsodoyo,0,Sat May 23 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. I only paddle flatwater and haven't worn a PFD (in my kayak) since maybe 2010? I always have it in my boat, unless I'm in a race (in which case I'm effectively 30 seconds away from having a chase boat throw me one, which is probably faster than I could get it out of my boat anyway).   I wear one when I'm on the clock. I don't do surfski or WW; if I did I would wear a lifejacket, because in those situations, it would be a higher level of risk than I'm willing to take.   ETA: I actually do wear a PFD when I'm at my home club which is on a gently moving river (current speed is like, really slow. Like... under 3 km/h), except it's a little inflatable only rated for sprint canoe/kayak and sport rowing use. I totally forgot (when writing this post) that I wear it, even though I always do."

I would dress for the water temps, because not being outfitted correctly in cold water could kill you. Personally, I would look into a cheap, thin wetsuit for the warmer days. You can even buy some wet-suit vests that will keep your core a little warmer, but allow you to move and breathe without getting too hot on the pack to the water."
Kayaking,36wp75,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Fri May 22 22:52:07 2015 UTC,"I spent a weekend recently in South Carolina taking classes. Air temps were in the 60-70's, water temps had just broken 60's. I wore my drysuit every day. On the hottest day with just a very thin short sleeve rash guard and bathing suit under. If I wasn't taking classes I would probably dressed differently. But I knew I'd spend a lot of time in the water, and I was more comfortable staying dry the entire time than in a wetsuit. The few times I felt warm I cooled of by rolling.   If I knew it'd be calm conditions I would dress for immersion but differently, but sometimes it's just easier to throw on the drysuit and spend more time in the water.   If I know the water will be really cold, the drysuit is a must for me."
Kayaking,36wp75,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri May 22 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on how hot/cold you run. I personally get too hot in a dry suit for summer boating. Usually I'll just go with a t-shirt or skin to the wind. I also have a semi-try top for days when it might be a little chilly, but not cold enough for drysuit weather. A shorty is another good option in warm temps.  I personally haven't worn my wetsuit since I bought a drysuit."
Kayaking,36wp75,nittanyvalley,1 point,Sat May 23 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you are planning on getting wet and how hot it is outside. My cutoff for wearing my drysuit is about 60*, after that I'll be hot inside (mine is all black). You wear insulating layers beneath the suit and these can be changed out for thinner options.

Kayaking,36tckm,R3v4n07,2,Sat May 23 14:01:48 2015 UTC,"Professional UI Designer here! some tips/suggestions:   Consider brightening your Modal Windows, Or making it more opaque. Right now they blend with the darkened background. This is most likely because of how transparent they are. Which is good for cool points. bad for readability.  The whole app is pretty dark from what your showing here. You may consider taking that muted brown for the buttons and changing it to a nice orange to create a complement to the blues. Another idea may be just to add orange accents here and there. Adding in a complimentary color will add pop and liveliness to your layout without being overpowering.  lift your left and right arrows in the map section up just slightly. They are creating an uncomfortable relationship with the bottom of your top nav bar.  How are you navigating to or away from ""Current charted rivers""? I see only a log out button.   I really like the overall design of the app and I would definitely download it if it helps me out when I'm trying to make the choice of where to paddle or get supplies. By all means you don't have to listen to anything i suggest, but I'm bored at work so I figured I'd help."

Kayaking,36ul20,Eloth,1 point,Fri May 22 16:23:59 2015 UTC,Hopped in a playboat the other day and managed to do that off a hand roll. Wasn't sure whether to be proud or ashamed.
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,1 point,Sat May 23 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think when it comes to hand rolls, it should always lead to pride... Someday for me..."
Kayaking,36ul20,Eloth,1 point,Sat May 23 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's a lot easier than you'd expect. Get a friend ready to drop you an Eskimo rescue and give it a try.   To set up for a hand roll, (and I suggest you do this above water the first few times) put your hands out in front of you, palms down and thumbs together. Now twist your arms to the side you want to roll on, keeping your thumbs together, so that your palms are now facing up. With your hands in this position, capsize and reach for the surface just like a normal roll - and hip flick just like normal."
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon May 25 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a try. I have a good butterfly roll, I was thinking of trying it with a ping pong paddle next. Is there a video I can find of the technique you're referring to?"
Kayaking,36ul20,Eloth,1 point,Mon May 25 13:23:07 2015 UTC,Not as far as I know...
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 25 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious. Tell him that's a great balance brace. I was about to say tell him to do a quick forward scull at the end and he'll nail it, and then I saw him do just that when he does the rolls at the end of the video. Really nice! Is he in an WS tempest?"
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,2,Fri May 22 12:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I put the boat's name in the title because I find that helps the video to find exposure. He paddles a tempest 165."
Kayaking,36ul20,Myatariisbusted,1 point,Fri May 22 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense. I played the video on my phone so I don't see any of the video info. Straight play inside alien blue."
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri May 22 17:02:43 2015 UTC,The hand roll is hard to learn because it's scary going in with nothing in your hand
Kayaking,36ul20,KayakHipster,2,Sat May 23 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"Nice stuff. Really solid resting position in the balance brace (something I need to improve).  What is the loom length on that paddle? It may be the angle in the video, but it looks short for the beam of the tempest:  I've been using a 21"" loom in my tempest and it feels about right for the beam (and my anatomy). I do find though that the width of the boat is a bit too wide for my liking around my feet, and makes my catch a bit wonky.  Next week I'm testing out a Petrel which has a 20"" beam (compared to the 22 on the Tempest)."
Kayaking,36u7qf,DrunkenGerbils,1 point,Fri May 22 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"Werner makes the best IMO (Sherpa, Powerhouse, etc.), but if you're just trying to get something, Aquabound isn't a bad alternative. If you have a online gear swap near you, be on the lookout for a used paddle. They are hard to find, but worth it if they aren't too worn down. One with a fiberglass shaft and fiberglass blades is best deal and will last long. Plastic blades aren't terrible, but they have a little more flex and weight to them.  Other brands that work are Adventure Technology, Core, etc. As a beginner, most will probably be fine, but once you start running harder whitewater, you'll want a better paddle (but that will be a few years).  I believe the standard is a 30 degree offset. Get one with that, with whatever hand is your control hand."
Kayaking,36u7qf,nittanyvalley,1 point,Fri May 22 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"Werner's plastic blades are crap. Avoid those -- the blades are too small, have too much flex, and flutter like hell.  For a newbie I'd say glass shaft/plastic blades is the best balance -- it'll last you forever, and when you're ready to reap the benefits from a nice paddle the top-end stuff is enough of a jump to justify the expense."

If you're carrying sea kayaks, especially if they're glass, wood, or skin on frame, go for 3 J racks or 2 J's on the outside with a roller rack in the middle.   If you're thinking of carrying 2-3 boats, certainly go for one of the sturdy, good rack systems. It'll get heavy quick and you want to know its secure."

Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,5,Thu May 21 04:24:05 2015 UTC,Astral Green Jacket.   Pretty much the best whitewater PFD out there right now.
Kayaking,36ppmt,NotSayingJustSaying,1 point,Thu May 21 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"yeah I figured it out eventually (scroll down further).  I owned one in 2012.  Bought it at volume pricing, rafted all summer, sold it at the end of the season for a small profit.  Hell of a pfd."
Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 21 07:35:36 2015 UTC,Yeah they updated the jacket since then. One big thing is that they redid all of the pockets.
Kayaking,36ppmt,BiggC,1 point,Thu May 21 07:41:23 2015 UTC,like those two zipper pockets on the kidneys that would never stay shut?
Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 21 08:03:17 2015 UTC,Yep. They redid the angle on those to make them easier to open/close.
Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 21 09:27:06 2015 UTC,I had a NRS Ninja before winning this (still have it) but the big front pocket is really nice on this Green Jacket. It matches my green and black Pyranha too.
Kayaking,36ppmt,doplebanger,1 point,Thu May 21 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"It's a comfortable pfd with great storage, but as a rescue vest it has a major design flaw. The back harness quick release buckle is on the side next to a bunch of loose straps, making it difficult to find if you're being pushed around in the water, and harder to release with right hand."
Kayaking,36ppmt,NotSayingJustSaying,2,Thu May 21 16:24:33 2015 UTC,That's the first I've heard of someone complaining about the location. I've never had an issue getting to it.

Kayaking,36ppmt,Swatraptor,0,Thu May 21 04:54:05 2015 UTC,It's not... NRS and Astral are different companies.  That's an Astral pfd and it looks like it's either an Astral Willie or an Astral Sea Wolf.  Didn't it come with tags?
Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 21 04:58:26 2015 UTC,Of yeah you're right. I'm thinking of the Zen which is like NRS's version of this pfd. Small and low profile. My B.
Kayaking,36ppmt,nittanyvalley,1 point,Thu May 21 05:47:04 2015 UTC,no worries.  I actually just noticed the cross on it.  I guess it could be a Greenjacket.  I haven't seen a new one in a while.
Kayaking,36rv6r,unclepaulhargis,5,Thu May 21 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"Thule and Yakima are the best. Yakima can be found on Ebay easily. Not as much Thule on there though.  I just watch for a good deal and piece together the parts I need. I wouldn't call them cheap but you can get some good deals if you shop. And the best thing about either brand is that when  you change cars, you can just pick up clips or whatever you need to fit your new car and sell the old ones on Ebay."
Kayaking,36rv6r,Kudzupatch,1 point,Fri May 22 02:16:10 2015 UTC,My wife's friend uses a Malone HandiRack on her Toyota Camry. Depending on the length of your kayak you may need bow & stern tie downs also.
Kayaking,36rv6r,asmuth,1 point,Thu May 21 20:45:28 2015 UTC,Check out Amazon. Search for kayak bars and there are plenty of $40-$60 options that fit most cars without having to change anything.
Kayaking,36rv6r,gm83,1 point,Thu May 21 21:58:11 2015 UTC,"I use and see a lot of Thule racks. They're like $3-400 for a dual cross-bar system that can transport a single kayak. If you want to go cheap/free, I've seen lots of videos on youtube regarding using a foam block and straps that go through the inside of the car."
Kayaking,36rv6r,noccusJohnstein,1 point,Thu May 21 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen a bit of the same.  I'm hoping to find a good $100 option for something secure, not foam... and without spending tons of cash."
Kayaking,36rv6r,Minnesota2,2,Thu May 21 19:05:51 2015 UTC,I use the Handirack for my car. Works great and looks nice. Just be careful not to leave it on out in the rain.
Kayaking,36rccw,Sevelan,3,Thu May 21 14:39:32 2015 UTC,I would avoid if you going out on anything but a very calm Lake/pond.  Looks decent though.
Kayaking,36rccw,The_Real_XECH,1 point,Thu May 21 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have said that, yes it'll be almost entirely small lakes and slow streams.    I'll be honest, I've all but made up my mind to order it.  The size/weight fit for everything I need, from storage, getting to the water, price, everything.  Unless someone says it sinks or only goes backwards or something else glaringly obvious to anyone with experience, I am ordering it today.    Thank you for your reply."
Kayaking,36rccw,XoiRiot,3,Thu May 21 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"My step dad and I recently bought our first kayaks and this is the one he got for me. I like it a lot though I don't know nearly as much as most of the people on this sub. The back rod holders are a little short so check to see if they fit good. The last time I went out it was really choppy (I live in PCB, FL so we go into bay area a lot) and there were some good size rollers and it held up just fine. They paddle that comes with it works really good for me though it's a little short. The back rest needs to be tightened every so often if you lean back on it a lot. The foot rests are pretty good but they need grips on them so your feet don't slip off. I'm 5'10 and 145lbs and it works really well for the price. Like I said, I'm not an expert. Hope this helped :) Btw that price is even cheaper from when we got it. We got it for $220 I think."
Kayaking,36rccw,safety3rd,2,Thu May 21 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Hard to knock a sub 200$ boat, but I'll tell you why I wouldn't buy it- Too short. It will track so poorly it would frustrate me. In other words, a paddle stroke will turn the bow side to side instead of pushing it straight ahead. But it will get you on the water very cheaply and that's good!"
Kayaking,36rccw,stalker007,2,Thu May 21 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"I understand, thank you.  The smaller size was one of the selling points for me.  It'll both fit in my car, or well enough to get 20min to some water, and in my storage closet at my apt complex. I think I'll have to deal with poor tracking, for now at least.  If kayak fishing ends up being as good for me as I'm hoping, I'll definitely invest more money in better equipment."
Kayaking,36rccw,stalker007,2,Thu May 21 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think you should be fine in that kayak...but just be warned that the plastic will be thinner than other kayaks and will likely be soft in warm weather.  Also make sure that you are below the recommended 225lbs with all of your gear, otherwise the kayak will sit low in the water and track even worse than it already does.  Good deal to get you out on the water though."
Kayaking,36rccw,gm83,1 point,Thu May 21 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't think about gear weight, thank you for bringing up that point.  I'm about 175lbs, but wasn't planning on taking too much with me.  I figure a pole or two, a small tackle box and a bottle of water.  I don't plan on any long outtings, but I will be mindful of my gear weight."
Kayaking,36quiz,KayakHipster,3,Thu May 21 11:56:57 2015 UTC,"This drives me crazy. I left him a message urging to research dressing for cold water padding, and wearing their pfd's. But it brings up the same issue again. Do we annoy people asking them to be better informed and prepared so we hopefully don't hear about them in the paper? Or do we let everyone be and hope they eventually learn about it?  Lastly, I tried blurring all the important info on the photo. If you guys think it's still too much to share I'll take the post down. I thought it could be informative since we've been talking so much about cold water paddling this spring."
Kayaking,36quiz,nittanyvalley,3,Thu May 21 12:00:59 2015 UTC,They are actually breaking the law. New York state law requires PFDs to be worn between Nov. 1 and May 1.

Kayaking,36rsmc,FeedMeCletus,2,Thu May 21 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"You can, but unless you already have the hooks, I would just use straps as suggested.

It moved around on the roof constantly, seemed like it was going to dent it at any time. It's very flimsy and I used it just that very first time and got rid of it. I would have been better off using foam blocks, but I could not fit both boats on at the same time.   I then found a used yakima rack used on eBay, still have it today on a different car 4 years later. The good racks might seem expensive, but from everyone I know they keep them for years, if not for over a decade. Even as you change cars. In the long run, fixing your roof from a crappy rack will cost more than a used good roof rack.   Edit - *not"

Kayaking,36quyz,SlothDabski,1 point,Thu May 21 15:34:18 2015 UTC,buy a decent rack and cheap ass j-rack.  strap your kayak to the RACK crossbars while in the j-rack.  I do that with my 80lb fishing boat and it works great.

Kayaking,36q6b1,exbex,2,Thu May 21 06:28:23 2015 UTC,"I am 6' 1"" and about 215-210 lbs. I don't have extensive experience on the Pungo 120, but I did just buy one for the wife last weekend. We took it out with our 4 year old, who is just over 40lbs or so. It did really well with her sitting in front of me without the console. It felt much better by myself, without the extra 40 lbs. The kayak was more lively on the water, and I was able to get it going at a pretty good pace. Otherwise, with her with me, it sat a little lower in the water, but not bad.   That being said, I bought the 140 for myself because I do weigh 210lbs. I haven't taken it out yet, but I suspect it will carry my weight a little better, maybe track a little straighter. I do want to kayak camp with it in the future. I plan on doing lakes, and slow moving rivers.   I really like the hatches on the Pungos. They seems infinitely easier to open than a hatch that has to be peeled off. Just slide the locks back and it pop the lid up.  I could really dial in the seat on the Pungo, it felt really good.   I have no experience with the other two you mentioned. I don't think I would have considered them because I do want the option of taking our munchkin and the cockpit is really big on the Pungos.    Anyways, my .02, from a beginner.  Edit: Did I mention it was a hell of a lot of fun? I can't wait to go again. I would probably guess you couldn't go wrong with any of these choices, and just getting out there with any of these will be a blast."

Kayaking,36ot09,BorealHound,1 point,Wed May 20 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"I have both. I have a 10ft & 12ft kayak. Sometimes both are on the roof. Sometimes one.  When both are on I have to use the rails (wide kayaks don't fit side by side) but when I only have one kayak I have just used the foam blocks. I think they key to this is how they are strapped down. When two kayaks are on the roof my stock rails are likely overloaded weight wise. That said, when I have any kayaks on the roof I tie down the front & back as well as the roof straps. Without the front & rear straps they are shifted by the wind. With them tight they don't move.   I should mention these rails have also hauled a 17ft aluminum canoe as well as fiberglass & aluminum extension ladders. Stock rails on a 2002 truck.   I would think using the rails or just using the blocks as long as it's securely strapped to the truck it shouldn't matter. I never tie it solely to the rails for that reason. If a rail fails then the kayak is strapped to an unattached rail.   Not sure if this helps. Hope maybe it does."
Kayaking,36ot09,offspringin,1 point,Thu May 21 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"if you're not using bow and stern lines to tie down your kayak, you should be.  it's a big safety issue and it will help with the twisting/shifting in the wind.  if it's really windy, i'd strap directly to the roof rack.  J-cradles are great and make life a bit easier, but you are just putting a giant sail on the roof of your car when your kayak is sitting on its edge."
Kayaking,36ot09,WhoIsPurpleGoo,1 point,Thu May 21 03:45:18 2015 UTC,When I use the J cradles I run the straps around the rails just to be sure it won't get away.
Kayaking,36ot09,sschering,1 point,Thu May 21 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"From a safety aspect, it's really not enough.  When you only strap your kayak down to the rails or the cradle, you only have one attachment point to your vehicle.  If your cradle or rails fail, your kayak is no longer attached to your car.  If a strap breaks, your kayak is no longer attached to your car.  Bow and stern lines give you an additional attachment point.  Now, multiple things need to fail before your kayak comes free.  If you add wind into the equation, you also have something that prevents twisting and torquing your rails/cradle."

The lower profile of the boat lying flat will be less susceptible to crosswinds.  Bow and stern ties strongly recommended regardless of how the boat sits on the car."

If one person is smart enough to wear one then usually they are smart enough to not consider going out with someone who isn't wearing one.    But if it was murder imagine the stage. Your spouse wants to go out for a kayak. The water is still cold but with the PFD you feel confident enough to survive the 1-10-1 if things go wrong. Then as you get far enough out she says ""Your PFD looks ripped, let me take a look"". You have no reason to not believe your spouse so you take it off and hand it to her. She jabs you with her paddle knocking you into the waves. Maybe it leaves a mark but how many weird bruise type injuries have you given yourself just loading and unloading the kayaks? Plenty of times.  She begins to paddle away... You're fighting the 1 just trying to breathe. You make it to the 10 but too far away to do anything meaningful. You try anyway. She's been gone for what seems like a lifetime now. The current is strong. At least the cold is starting to go away. Your joints are getting so tight... All you can do is scream for help into the darkness.  Maybe they don't need to find the body. Maybe they just need to find the PFD,  Why wouldn't he grab his boat? Why wouldn't he grab her boat?

They are, however, a lot slower than other paddle craft, because they produce a lot more drag than hard-shelled canoes and kayaks.   This means that if I'm just cruising around on my own, with no particular hurry to get anywhere, they are fine.  If I'm in a group, I struggle to keep up, and they are much less fun."

There are $400 inflatables that are basically a raft. I personally love mine and took it on a 3 day portage trip in Algonquin park 2 weeks ago. It performed great!"
Kayaking,36ljp1,bradgillap,2,Wed May 20 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"I got a  Intex Challenger for next to nothing on ebay, that dragged me into kayaking, but soon found it to limiting. I upgraded to a Gumotex Swing 1, and more recently a fiberglass, but thats a bit to short for me (6'6"") so I will swap that out soon (anyone in southern Austria interested in one?=  The Swing is noticeable slower than my fiberglass one, but still decent. If you make a tour with someone who sits in a hard shell one, it won't be pleasant, but with other inflatables it goes pretty good - and as long as you don't have the comparison with someone faster you are happy too.   Main reasons I still will keep my inflatable even when I get a rigid one:   I can carry it in a backpack on my bike Its MUCH more stable than any rigid one I tried   I often took the inflatable with in the car, or on the bike and went to lake, drove around on the lake, got out, stored the boat in the backpack and pedaled home. And without dragging a kayak after me that is twice as long as the bike.  I often made trips along rivers, where both features became useful. I was never in risk of tipping over, while its wide footprint makes it slow on water, it makes it also almost untippable. Great when you want to travel along the river and snap photos on the way. And because it fits in a backpack, I could finish my trip on the river, get out, and take a bus or train back to my starting point. Try that with a rigid one.  Of course, when you mostly drive on calm lakes, you want something faster. I do too, thats why I look for a rigid one in addition to my inflatable one. But even then I would keep it for such occasions."

I'm a beginner on a budget just like you and I've had a blast paddling around in it. More experienced paddlers tend to bash the Pelican kayaks because they're not as fine tuned, but they're stable, light, and durable and I've been super happy with mine. 180 bucks really is a steal and I don't think you'll be sorry. As far as transport, I got cheap J racks on Amazon that are wonderful for the price. With you having a civic and presumably no cross bars to attach J Racks to, your best bet for very little money would probably be foam blocks and straps (just be careful not to over tighten because you can dent the hull). Some people actually use foam pool noodles to save even more money (you can search Google images for examples). Have fun!"

Once I get more experience I plan on upgrading. I have been eyeing the foam blocks as my best bet but I just worry about how safe they are, not that I plan on going 80 miles an hour down the road and I know other people use them but I just want to be certain that they will hold well. Your advice is awesome though and I greatly appreciate it!"
Kayaking,36myl8,iaintcommenting,1 point,Wed May 20 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"I don't have that particular boat but I do have a very similar one. It's a nice enough boat as long as you're staying in slow moving or still water. It's not a fast boat and it doesn't really want to go in a straight line so you'll have to put in a little extra effort to keep it straight. On the plus side, it is a small and very light boat so you should be able to get it on top of your small car without any issue - your cheapest option there is probably to just get a set of foam blocks, something like http://www.amazon.com/Attwood-Car-Top-Kayak-Carrier-Kit/dp/B003EET2OE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1432138724&sr=8-3  You can also look for used kayaks in that price range. with a little luck, you may be able to find something a little nicer for the same price."
Kayaking,36myl8,iaintcommenting,1 point,Wed May 20 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I only plan on going on lakes for now just to get the feel of everything and decide if I enjoy it enough to put more money into it. Being that I only plan on using it on lakes I'm not too concerned with going in a pin straight line and speed isn't a huge issue for me either at this time since I am only beginning although in the future it will be taken into consideration! As for the foam blocks do you, or someone you know, have any experience with them? I know people use them frequently but I'm a bit on edge about getting them. Also, I have looked on Craigslist but the only ones I've ever found have been priced at 400-500 used but thank you also for the advice!!"
Kayaking,36myl8,Mad_Gouki,1 point,Wed May 20 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"I've been using the foam blocks for a while, I haven't had any issue with them yet. They may take a little longer than a full rack to get set up properly (I usually take about 10 minutes to get my kayak up on the blocks, strapped in, and tied down) but if you're on a tight budget they'll hold your kayak on your car and get it where you want to be."

Kayaking,36lb5k,brasher,3,Wed May 20 05:49:55 2015 UTC,"So I don't really go coastal paddling but here's what I wear:  If it's really, really cold (as in below 0 and snowing e.c.t.) - Drysuit with a thermal onesie underneath  If it's a cold - Long Sleveed Cagdeck with dry trouseres (the dungaree type with shoulder straps)  When it's just a little bit chilly (or just not warm)- Long Sleveed Cagdeck and board shorts. Depending on the water temp and if I might get wet, I'll wear my neoprene lined shorts  When its warm and sunny - Short Sleeved Cagdeck and shorts  When it's really hot (normally only if I'm paddling abroad) - I just go skins and shorts.  Hope this helps, In my opinon, wetsuits are a bit naff. They're only really good at keeping you warm if you're wet and they're not breathable so if you're paddling loads and sweating lots it's not going to be very nice to wear!"
Kayaking,36lb5k,Tomagone,2,Wed May 20 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"I fucking loathe wetsuits, my problem is I just can't afford getting a good drysuit. You get all horrible and sweaty, but they're still cold unless you're in the water (and even then it's not pleasant because you're still all wet and you have a wetsuit stuck to you), because there is pretty much no wind protection so the air will just suck away any warmth you have."
Kayaking,36lb5k,JIDFshill87951,2,Wed May 20 10:30:50 2015 UTC,"A cheap mac will help with wind protection, like the ones that come in little sacks. You can normally pick them up cheap and they'll keep the wind off."

Kayaking,36lb5k,dBasement,3,Thu May 21 04:56:23 2015 UTC,Wetsuits also restrict your movement and/or chafe your skin.
Kayaking,36lb5k,drumbopiper,2,Wed May 20 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"There is an adage: ""Dress for the swim""    Wetsuits are OK, but as other people say they are chaffy and the wind will blow off your heat.   A two piece drysuit (drytop/drypants) isn't too bad, if you do swim, you will get wet, but depending on the temps you may be able to deal with it alright.  Many whitewater kayakers use a two piece system for spring/summer paddling."
Kayaking,36lb5k,doplebanger,2,Wed May 20 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"A farmer john wetsuit will not restrict your movement much because it doesn't cover your arms. So not a bad idea.  However I would advise against the dry top and bottom idea, I did it once and promptly sold the two for a drysuit. There will likely be no time where you feel that you only want a dry top, so there is not reason not to get a full suit. Not to mention, if you swim, the combo will not hold water out."
Kayaking,36k3fw,echo_098,3,Tue May 19 23:39:24 2015 UTC,"In most states any land above the navigable high water line is the property of the landowner.  So, you better have permission to camp.  Sheriffs can and will remove you, fine you, or hold you over for a court appearance if the landowner complains loud enough. Some landowners have been known to ignore the navigable water line and if you put a foot on ""their"" land they get mean real fast.  To get permission you can correlate Google Maps and the GIS system to determine the owner and contact information for just about any piece of land.  GIS maps can usually be accessed using the county government web site for each county."

Kayaking,36k3fw,flargenhargen,2,Wed May 20 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"""The shore"" is incredibly broad. Everywhere is different. I'd recommend finding a part of the coast that is a national seashore or other federal or state park that already has camping regulations figured out. If not, be sure to call the local police station for their laws and regulations on public beach camping. Always camp LNT. Nobody wants to see trash or waste on a beautiful beach."
Kayaking,36k3fw,hat___,1 point,Wed May 20 14:34:09 2015 UTC,Stealth camping without leaving a trace tends to ease landowner concerns. The world should be free and open to pitch a tent or hang a hammock for a night.

Not sure about the laws in WV, OH and PA, but never had in any problems paddling around those states. I live in Virginia now and ""crown grants"" are a frequent issue. Basically, some very old documents from the King of England in the 1700s are being used to not only limit shore access, but to also generally keep people off the rivers.  I've not had any direct run-ins with landowners, but hear there's been problems. It may just be a paranoid paddler thing, but it at least has a basis in fact.

Kayaking,36k3fw,samsara_kayak,1 point,Fri May 22 03:22:46 2015 UTC,"it depends on your location.   if you arrive late in the day, leave early and don't leave a trace you can probably get away with camping on most uncrowded public land.   that said, it is more relaxing  to not have to worry (and hurry) and  camp official sites.  many official sites also have useful facilities like nice flat/mown areas for pitching tents and toilets."

Kayaking,36hxdz,usaywha,2,Tue May 19 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"I'll let others that paddle WW chime in. On my end, this was my first boat when I wondered if I'd like kayaking years ago. I would not take this anywhere other than calm, small lakes, and extremely slow, slow moving water. It's very stable, great beginner boat, but can only handle very calm places. I would not take this to fast moving water.   We still keep the two of these we bought when family and friends that have never kayaked before want to come with us out on calm lakes."
Kayaking,36hxdz,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue May 19 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in the market for a kayak too and had been scrolling through Dicks inventory. I'll tell you what I've been hearing from all my kayaking buddies:  A 10ft for river use (not white water or fast moving. Duh) is about where you wanna be. Tracking isn't AS important since the river is moving you along.   Sit on tops are ideal if for someone reason you should roll. (True story, my mom was in a sit in and managed to get pinned between a strong current and some massive tree roots. She was underwater for a good bit but managed to stay calm and free herself before it was too late.)  Also, with sit ins, you apparently need a skirt to keep water from splashing in. Not sure how necessary that is on a slow moving river, though.   Make sure the seat is comfortable, especially if you'll be on a slow moving river. Lazy is fun until your back starts to ache.   Stay away from thinned hulled plastics. Easy to puncture.   That's basically what I've been told. I've been looking at the Pelican Soul 100. Seems to be a good boat for the price."
Kayaking,36hxdz,Oletwothumbs,1 point,Tue May 19 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"It's a good starter boat.  It is missing a lot of stuff that you'll only miss once you have it, like a paddle holder, water-tight bulkhead, cupholder, seat that won't hurt after 2 hours, thigh pads, etc.  It will work great on flat and slow moving water.  Probably up to class II but only if you're prepared to get swamped and self-rescue if necessary.  Probably can't get a decent skirt on this boat.  Depending on your usage and thirst to upgrade, you'll probably get 2-5 years out of this boat."
Kayaking,36hxdz,dispatch00,1 point,Tue May 19 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, it's a decent starter boat. Definitely take into account that you should only take it out on easy flat water or Maybe a slow moving river.  My experience with cheaper boats is that they can scare off beginner paddlers. I am no expert, but have been out in a variety of boats in a variety of waters. To me a kayak is something worth spending a little more money on. Because in the end, its about safety. I know that sounds lame, but you'll be cursing your frugal pocket when you are trying to flip a swamped boat in the middle of a lake.  Don't want to scare you away from the sport, but IMO some of the cheaper kayaks are borderline pool toys and can be pretty dangerous."
Kayaking,36hxdz,moreheavy,1 point,Tue May 19 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"I don't own my own kayak -yet- but I've been talking to some of my buddies who do. The two guys I was out with last weekend mentioned Pelican as something to stay away from. Something to do with the two-part kayaks tending to not be as watertight. If you haven't yet, try typing it into google and looking for user reviews. Other than that, good luck, and let us know what you end up with and how you feel about it!"
Kayaking,36hxdz,OmegaZuluIX,3,Tue May 19 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, they're not something to stay away from, but you get what you pay for. They're that cheap for a reason. This sub always recommends trying to get a used (better than pelican) kayak as a first, but most people want to just walk into dicks and walk out with a shiny new one. I was one of those people and don't regret it  even though I outgrew my purchase very quickly - but clearly getting a used better boat is a much better path to take if you want to get your money's worth."
Kayaking,36hxdz,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue May 19 19:45:33 2015 UTC,Pelicans are definitely bottom-of-the-barrel affairs. I would suggest avoiding them.
Kayaking,36hxdz,Eloth,1 point,Wed May 20 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"It has pretty much all been said here. I do want to add that I have seen similar boats get damaged easily on rocks and they do not have the type of support to reinforce the boat at all for whitewater. Meaning, a class 2 rapid is enough to swamp the boat with no skirt and then you are going to have a very hard time retrieving the boat because it will be full of water. Then if it does get pinned against something, it is very likely to suffer major damage. A buddy of mine experienced all of that and ended up trashing the boat.  So yes, they will work for flat and slow stuff. Longer periods of time in the boat are going to be much less comfortable. I would shoot for spending a little more to get a one-piece boat. I completely understand that is not in the budget for some people though. I've had a few cheaper boats and got by with them for a while. Once you save up to get a good boat, you will wonder why you ever did it a different way."
Kayaking,36hxdz,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Tue May 19 22:11:44 2015 UTC,"I just got one of these about a month ago, my first kayak. Pretty cool, been out 5-6 times on local creeks and a little lake in my area. Not a water-tight bulkhead and there's no paddle holder but a little red neck engineering can fix that. All in all I'd say it's pretty durable as I've bottomed out a few times pretty hard but so far so good."
Kayaking,36hxdz,u_r_naive,1 point,Wed May 20 19:06:02 2015 UTC,"Stay off the rapids in rec boats. They aren't built for it and you don't have the skills. You'll also need safety equipment - class II may not look like much, but a couple of thousand tons of water bearing down on you exerts a substantial force, no matter how slow it's moving.   Chances are, with class II, things would be fine - but why chance it? You probably will end up with a swamped or upside down boat in the best case scenario."

Kayaking,36iaq0,RetroProtoEncabulate,2,Tue May 19 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If they had any faith in their product they should do a production run and then sell the kayaks, not ask the customers to pay in advance for a kayak that may never ship."

Kayaking,36d8xh,PageFault,2,Mon May 18 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"Keeping dry isn't the issue, getting a signal through the water is the issue.  It is very difficult for a signal to make it more than a few meters through water.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_submarines"

I'm guessing op would have lost his kayak in a freshwater river less then 10 meters deep, if it did sink instead of just heading down stream before he could catch it. I don't know the area so signal might be a problem still."
Kayaking,36d8xh,PageFault,1 point,Mon May 18 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"It goes on to say 100's of meters for ultra low frequencies. The 20 meters was for the high powered equipment on a naval submarine at very low frequencies.  Cellphones have much cheaper transmitters and use ultra high frequencies.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies  If it's not too deep, it may still get a signal though, but the chances decrease exponentially with depth. Someone else in this thread said he knew someone that was lucky at a depth too deep to dive for. (I'm guessing he meant with no SCUBA gear.)  It's worth a try, I just would't have high hopes."

Kayaking,36b5wa,meohmy13,1 point,Mon May 18 01:49:07 2015 UTC,"That is a great first kayak. My first one was a pelican 10' from Costco. Hope you have lots of fun with it. I would suggest looking into some items such as paddle leash, dry bags and etc."
Kayaking,36b5wa,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 18 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"Be careful with paddle leashes. It's a very debated subject. Some ocean paddlers like them, WW usually hate them, pretty much anything that could potentially get tangled during a capsize and entrap you is a risk. Especially in WW. In calmer ocean or lake paddling, not anywhere as risky. However, if you always carry a knife on your PFD then not such a big deal."
Kayaking,36b5wa,meohmy13,2,Mon May 18 11:50:07 2015 UTC,I always use one in the surf on my sit on top and on both my boats in flat water.  I would not do it in whitewater nor surfing my sit-in.

Kayaking,36dd6b,sherbeck,2,Mon May 18 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of getting new crossbars, maybe you could get a kayak holder which holds the kayak on its side like this."
Kayaking,36dd6b,RetroProtoEncabulate,1 point,Mon May 18 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"yeah i was thinking about that too. right now, i am using an inno brand SUP rack for my kayak which actually works really well since i can ratchet it very tight with the knob. this takes up the majority of my cross bars. i have to double check to see if i can also fit a J cradle on the end without removing the other rack. i have always been paranoid about simply just using straps."
Kayaking,36dd6b,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 18 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"The yakima bowdowns take up 5 inches of the crossbars for clamping, and the rest can extend over the towers (see photo below). I've been able to fit two of them on facing out and a set of flat rollers in the middle for a third boat. They're not the cheapest option out there though, but they've been very good for me so far. I think they might be one of the j cradles that take up the least amount of clamping space. Maybe that'll let you fit the sup mount and a j next to it?  http://imgur.com/5AuKD2w"
Kayaking,36dd6b,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 18 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"i, too, drive the subaru impreza in white!  http://i.imgur.com/4H0nbUR.jpg  my other concern is, even if it DID fit, it would be pretty far off of the car with most of the weight distributed at the extreme edge of the cross bar. even though the smaller kayak is only 38 lbs, it just doesn't seem like a good idea. your system here looks great, but i imagine it would cost a small fortune."
Kayaking,36dd6b,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 18 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"It's a great car! Well, if you make sure the clamps are still on the inside of the cross bar, it's not too far outside the car. Notice on mine it just makes it to to edge of the car, but it's clamped on the inside.   The bow downs are I think around 100 or 120 for the pair. The actual cross bars and towers I got used on eBay to help with costs - and actually, I used to use the same crossbars on my old Honda Fit. I was delighted when I found out they used the same width bars. I just had to get different towers.   Edit - just checked on Amazon, they're selling them for 159. I remember paying 120. I must have caught a sale on them, I def didn't pay that much for them."

Kayaking,36d5wo,Eloth,2,Wed May 20 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"Airbags are fairly standard! While they are vital, there's not a lot of difference between them and you don't really gain anything by paying more, even for serious ww boating.   Bow airbags are an extra set that go behind the footrest: most people don't bother with them, and you shouldn't need to at your level.   Have fun out there and stay safe!"

Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,2,Mon May 18 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"And that left hand, keep it close to your chest. Similar to the pose you'd do if you just finished doing a pull-up. It'll force the boat to rotate without your body moving as much as it is in the photo. Keep it up!"
Kayaking,36bgir,KayakHipster,2,Mon May 18 12:12:13 2015 UTC,"I was going to say more but from the photo you can't really tell what he's doing. I just assume it's a roll because of the title. Further, you can't tell what kind of roll (because it definitely doesn't look like a standard sweep)."
Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 18 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, but to me it looks very similar to something I've had a several students do while attempting a sweep. Could be a c to c but that left hand should still stay closer to the power box position. I've seen, when people are learning the sweep, that while they're focusing on bringing the right hand in that full arc, they're not really paying attention to the left hand. (Of course this is just because they're starting out, it gets corrected quickly over time) I've noticed that having that roaming left hand follow the motion, it helps to dive the right blade even more, causing them to not come up completely - so they compensate by trying to get their heads out of the water first and right the boat.  If this image is similar to my experience in the pool, at this point if I told them to keep their left hand tight in that power position as they went through their sweep, it would cause them to change their head and body movement and flop the boat upright by this point in the next attempt since it'll keep the blade at the water surface.   It is just a photo though, so I might be completely off!"
Kayaking,36bgir,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon May 18 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"Well I have to say (no offense to OP) that going by the photo this is a pretty ugly failed roll. Everything is wrong, shoulders and head should still be in the water with the boat at this angle, paddle should be rotated 100 degrees clockwise or more.  Your advice is good but it's only the beginning of what's wrong. Now if we had the video this shot came from..."
Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 18 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well, for all we know it might have been a successful roll with bad technique that could lead to injury - but Rome wasn't built in a day... Rolling takes a lot of practice and we've all had attempts like this.   OP, do you have video footage of this attempt? It'd be great for us to check out so we can see what's going on.   At the same time, anything we say is nothing in comparison to having an instructor actually teaching you in person - assessing body motion in person is crucial to good technique. Was this during a class or just playing around?"
Kayaking,36bgir,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon May 18 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"I have the video but once I go under the water are too green and dark to see anything :S  This is not during a class this is just a rolling session I do near the beach I got no one to spot me so progress is a little slow  From that outing for an hour I did about 10 trials with having about 7 successful rolls but again the technique needs work since it wasn't a good roll and I did felt sometimes a little strain on my shoulder  I can post the video anyway, maybe get some more tips from you guys"
Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 18 22:25:50 2015 UTC,"No offense taken, I'm open to criticism !

Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 18 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"A suggestion I have for you is to get rid of the stuff on your deck, especially if you know you're practicing rolling and not going anywhere."

Kayaking,36bgir,doplebanger,1 point,Mon May 18 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"You can lay back in the boat. I would suggest going for an extended paddle sweep roll first, it's slower and easier than a c2c. Try looking up that or a standard Greenland roll video and tell me what you think. Looks easier right?"

The members of Lillesand Paddle Club who organized the trip, and the other experienced paddlers who participated were fantastic at making me and my girlfriend welcome and taken care of throughout the four day paddle.  The paddler Lars Verket has written a campsite book about the area. Lots of good spots in his book, and books on campsites in Norway. We slept at Merdøen, Valøyene, and at a small island in a lake up Reddals canal, until we finally had last camp at Skauerøya.  Midday lunch breaks were taken at various places, such as Grimstad and Saltholmen Lighthouse. I'm afraid I can't recall the two other places right now.

Not ""cut my wrists"" give up but possibly call the coast guard. It was that extreme. We just couldn't paddle anymore, and with a lack of water it was bad. I was using my iphone and google maps to help us along but it still keep turning us around when I had signal. Each time I stopped to even look at my phone and stop paddling the current in the mangroves would spin me around.  We screwed up by not watching the tides. We went out at high tide, against the current hoping for a better return but because of our idiocy, we came back when the tide came back. So we double screwed ourselves. Hell, I'm just lucky we came back. I don't want to be on the news."
Kayaking,36aqzi,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon May 18 00:24:00 2015 UTC,"Man, glad you guys are good, and glad it'll help for next time. Always carry sunscreen in your day hatch, I always try to even if I've put it on in case others forget it (same with a bit of water). Another good thing to do is to try to paddle against the current and/or wind at the start of the trip (if possible), so you can hopefully have an easier time coming home."
Kayaking,36aqzi,moscomule,1 point,Mon May 18 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"I had this happen to me on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Me and a friend (both about 14 at the time) went out with his parents and they somehow got way ahead of us. We got pulled out by the tide and had to wait on a makeshift island until his dad found us (using a rented jet ski) hours later. It was terrifying and honestly I held a grudge against kayaking because of it. 15 years later, I'm doing whitewater kayaking, but I still respect the beast it can be."

Kayaking,36byu3,dzhou10,1 point,Mon May 18 05:21:50 2015 UTC,"I bought my first kayak from Costco which was a Pelican Quest 100. I have used it in small rapids, lakes, rivers, and for over night trips with friends. It looks like this year or at least around here Costco is selling the Pelican Odyssey 100X to replace it. Which is basically the same except they got rid of the rear hatch in favor of a net I think. Which is not a big deal as you just use a dry bag.  Value wise it was great. I got mine on sale so coming with a roof carrier as I did not have my racks then, a paddle and a spray skirt I could not beat it. If the ones you are looking at come with the foam roof carrier and you buy it, be careful to not over tighten it as it can bow your roof in a bit. I now use it to take friends out to introduce them to kayaking. These kayaks are strictly for lakes, streams and rivers.  I doubt you will find something within the same range from Necky, Riot, Old Town and etc that comes with everything for a beginner. But do shop around with some local vendors to see what else is available as sometimes they clear out last years stock cheap."

You can find a new set from any online kayak store or Amazon, and make sure to use aquaseal to seal all holes thoroughly. I think I saw a YouTube video tutorial on it years ago.   One thing to add, I would not recommend using the kayak you mentioned in fast moving water. It is designed only for calm, flat water. If you want to get in fast moving water, please do it with a club or others who know what they're doing and using an appropriate boat for it. Fast moving water in a big rec kayak can be very dangerous.   Cheers and safe paddling!"
Kayaking,3637sg,KayakHipster,1 point,Sat May 16 20:19:16 2015 UTC,Is GOOP a satisfactory sealant?  I am assuming that the replacement pegs would come with screws and I could use the old screws to fill the gaps and just put sealant in with the screws and dremel off the end of the old screws or cover them up with padding.
Kayaking,3637sg,KayakHipster,1 point,Wed May 20 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't used goop before - what I like about aquaseal is that you can seal the entire head of the screw with it (around it and all over it, essentially making a bubble around it) and then place your screwdriver in the screw and get it out later. From what I read goop becomes hard and you might not be able to remove it later on? I really don't have any experience with it.   Yes, the new rails should come with screws. I believe mine came with screws like this - with a chunky head that can rest well on the outside of the kayak and you can seal well. It wasn't exactly these, just to give you an idea. That way if you rub up against it or hit a rock, it'll go right over without getting stuck or hurting you.

Kayaking,363jal,GrimeSquad1,3,Fri May 15 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, lots of questions in your post. Here's a couple of items that might help you.   The longer the boat is, the better it'll track (straighter it'll go) and the faster the cruising speed it'll have.   The longer it is, usually means it'll be able to take more cargo.   Now, long vs short doesn't affect tall vs short people or cargo completely. Usually most models will be made in a high volume and low volume version. For example, the taunami 145 mentioned above, is the higher volume version that'll fit bigger people and take slightly more cargo. Smaller people will go with a 140 version. The boat is made to fit average leg sizes as well as having its buoyancy set for a specific weight range.   Rudders allow you to focus on paddling forward only, and are very useful if you're looking for speed and or long expeditions. When you're paddling many miles day after day, a rudder will help paddlers. Also, by having a rudder, you get all of the back hatch space, since there's no skeg box.   I personally like skegs better. They are used to correct tracking in different situations, along with the boats tendency to turn into the wind. (Some will do this more than others). But you do lose a bit of cargo room in the back hatch. To me it's not a big deal because I don't go on expeditions.   Ok, now, to answer another one of your questions - shorter boats are easier to maneuver. That doesn't mean you can't turn a 17 footer easily. Edging helps to turn long boats. But if you're in narrow and winding creeks, full of gear, I'd recommend going shorter.   No one boat does everything well. Longer will be faster and carry more stuff. Shorter will be more maneuverable but slower. So, it's up to you to pick what you want to do first, list pros and cons and then decide what type of boat you want.   Many of those brands you listed are good. I doubt you'll find a good touring boat for $200, but CL does have good used sales.   Let us know what you decide paddling wise and we can try giving you some advice to what models can fit those parameters."
Kayaking,363jal,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri May 15 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"Alright thank you so much for the information! I really learned a lot I had no idea about the high volume versions and the exact use for the rudder/skeg Seems like I have a bit to consider with what I want, but I will make a list of what I really need and what brand I will look for I do not think i can get a touring boat for that price either but I will try to get one for a good price If I can get one I will let you know"
Kayaking,363jal,badpig,2,Sat May 16 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"I have a Tsunami 145 and I love the thing. It's got a ton of space and fairly maneuverable although you need to be comfortable with edging it to get it turned around quickly (I got mine w/o a rudder). Get a spray skirt cause it'll go over far enough that water pours into the cockpit when you edge it hard. I'm 6'2""  225# and it fits great although I'm planning to add some foam hip pads to make it fit a bit tighter to help with boat control."

I want to spend around $300 but i know getting a decent tour style that price is really pushing it and basically impossible.

Kayaking,363jal,doplebanger,1 point,Sat May 16 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately $300 is not going to be enough in most cases. You're going to want to push that budget. Or even wait another season and double it. It's only a couple hundred $$$ up front, but it makes all the difference over time. Often when you get up into the range of $600-1,000 you get package deals with a nice kayak, paddles, pfd, skirt etc."

Kayaking,35xwtb,BraidedClimber,3,Thu May 14 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"Check out the Shenandoah from Luray to Bentonville. IMO it is the perfect 3 day trip there are no portages and plenty of camping. Here is a good map of the float. We did the trip over 3 days doing 9 miles the first, 15 miles the second, and about 3 miles on the last day. The river has mile markers along the banks so it is easy to identify the camping spots if you follow the map and plan ahead."
Kayaking,35xwtb,Black_Lab,0,Thu May 14 18:53:35 2015 UTC,I think we are looking to average 12-15 miles per day. Though since we have a long weekend (memorial day weekend) we have plenty of time especially if we can drive up Friday afternoon
Kayaking,35xwtb,zachreborn,1 point,Thu May 14 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound really silly, but doesn't the Shenandoah flow north up into the Potomac? I'd highly recommend NOT going against the current for this sort of trip. You'd want to put in further south and get out at Front Royal or at the Potomac split.  In my experience for a relaxed trip 12-18 miles per day is a good target for multi-day trips. You can account for weather and unforeseen obstacles. Plus it allows for some seeing the sights time. This is a very leisurely pace though and if you don't stop paddling much you can go double that.  edit: missed a word"
Kayaking,35xwtb,zachreborn,1 point,Thu May 14 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"So I learned soon after posting this that its true, it does flow north. I think the current plan is to start in Luray and end in FR. Are there any good places to park a car near Luray? That are safe and/or cheap?"
Kayaking,35xwtb,Black_Lab,2,Thu May 14 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Haha don't feel too bad about it. I was planning a trip some time ago and realized after a few weeks of planning and talking about it with friends that the river flowed in the opposite direction I had expected.  I'm sure you can find a spot you'll trust near Luray. I've camped down there plenty of times and left my car for a day or two. Another option I've done is to find a homeowner with a large driveway or some land and ask if you can just park your car on their property for a weekend. Offer up $20 and you're set.

It's not worth giving a shit what other people think about your experience level, or how you look or whatever other excuse there is.    And really they aren't uncomfortable, they keep you warmer in cool water and hold snacks, or tools you may need.  Not to mention, being experienced usually brings the knowledge that a PFD is just part of your gear, and no weirder or necessary/ unnecessary than having a paddle."

So don't approach a weight limit on a boat thinking you'll be fine. That said, you need a big boat and I would suggest a sit on top, as big as is possible. Emotion kayaks has an 11' sit on top that is only $500. If your budget was higher, you could go even bigger as here are 14' sit on tops that you no doubt would find more comfortable."

Kayaking,35vbnd,Kudzupatch,1 point,Thu May 14 00:51:02 2015 UTC,I have to agree. You are a big guy and you need a bigger boat. A sit on top is going to be a good choice while you loose weight. I would strongly recommend looking at a longer/larger boat. You will be more comfortable and safer. Because you are going to be at the upper end of the capacity of most boats I would strongly suggest you try it out before you buy and make sure you like it.

Kayaking,35u59g,mustanggt90210,4,Wed May 13 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"On a $200 budget, you'll pretty much be buying disappointment. Kayaks are pretty expensive now, and most entry models start around $400. The expense goes up quickly when you get into fishing rigs, longer/faster kayaks, etc...  My suggestion is to find a place that sells them near you and ask for a demo run. I don't know where exactly you are in FL, but everyplace that sells them here lets you demo them before you buy (except Walmart)."
Kayaking,35u59g,saysomething234,1 point,Wed May 13 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"/u/saysomething234 is pretty dead on.  If you're budget is set, see if you can find a 10' Pelican on sale somewhere.  But remember a paddle and a PFD will add another 20% on top of your $200 boat.  Another option is, again - piggybacking on /u/saysomething234 - buying used boats from a dealer that sells their demo boats at the end of the year.  These boats tend to still be in great shape, whereas your average craigslist listing is (IME) a crap shoot and more frequently overpriced that not."

Kayaking,35qh1k,WheelsAndGears,3,Tue May 12 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like a decent rig. Advice:  Tie it down and make sure it doesn't get away from you. I have seen too many boats lost in the road, resulting in damage and/or someone else snagging them before you get back to pick it up.   Tie your stuff down in the boat. Yeah, it's pretty stable, but things happen quickly. You hook that big fish, you lose that big fish, you stand up to clear a snag, you get rocked by a boat wake, you catch a 40 pound catfish by surprise and you are going to lose some gear. Keep things strapped down and clipped in.   Don't take a bunch of extra garbage. Get a small tackle box and put your essentials in there. While you're at it, get a dry box/bag and put your keys and wallet and such in it. Losing your gear or your keys to get home makes for a really bad day.  Then the obvious of don't drink, don't litter, don't be stupid. Always wear a pfd.   Go have some fun! Share pictures of the catch."

Feel free to put the kayak in your truck just learn how to tie it up properly so it doesn't fly around. I've done this method with multiple kayaks at the same time with no issues.   Bring water. If you aren't going to wear your pfd, keep it handy and obstruction free at all times. Bring atleast two whistles with you. They will save your life, they saved mine. I carry four. One on my paddle, one in my life jacket,  one on my hat, and one on a string connected to my bail bucket.   If you're going to drink alcohol, drinking on the water alone is such a dumb idea.

Kayaking,35q6sd,thewonderblink,3,Tue May 12 16:36:42 2015 UTC,Those foam blocks work well enough if you're on a budget. I've used mine multiple times on all sorts of different roads (everything from steep hills on dirt roads to 4 lane highways). It may take a couple minutes longer to get it set up right than with a full rack but it'll do the trick.

Kayaking,35q6sd,Minnesota2,1 point,Tue May 12 21:52:00 2015 UTC,I used foam blocks and pool noodles over 700 miles plus through a nor'eastern with 40+ mph crosswinds at some points and heavy rain highways and all! No problems. I however did use 6 tie downs.
Kayaking,35q6sd,Dirtwolf,1 point,Tue May 12 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"I was spending most of my small amount of cash on a kayak, thus I went with the foam block kit and straps.  Roof racks for my MK4 Jetta are ridiculously expensive, seems to be $100-150 more than any other car for the same brand because they don't clamp to the door frame.  They bolt to 2 bolts under the weather stripping.  They are expensive.  Thus, the end of April I bought my kayak used and drove home 2.5 hours strapped to the foam blocks with stern and bow lines.  I was worried at first easing out onto the road and easing through town.  I pulled over after about 10 minutes to check the straps.  All was good.  As I drove more I got more confident and the speed increased.  After half an hour I stopped for dinner and checked everything again.  All was good.  Eventually I found myself cruising down the expressway without worry at speeds of  70 mph with no problems....  .... until I hit the bridge high over the Allegheny River.  It was really windy this day and when I got on the bridge out in the open, the boat shifted on me.  Scared me to death!.  All it did was kick the front of the boat a little to the side.  Being the straps are through the door it is very secured to the roof, there's no way it was coming off.  My main problem is I only have a tow hook in the front and rear both on the passenger side for bow and stern lines.  Had it been tied in the front to both sides at the bumper I don't think it would have shifted, the bow line would have prevented it.  Again, it was very windy up on the bridge.  If you can't tie bow and stern lines to the left and right, you can get loops that mount to a fender bolt under the hood to tie to.  I don't have them yet but plan on getting them.  That would have prevented the boat from getting pushed at an angle on the roof had I had them up on the bridge.  I've been out 4 times now and haven't had a problem at all.  My boat hauler is just an old work runner and not in the greatest of shape so I'm not worried about the paint finish.  I set the blocks at the edge of the roof hanging over the doors and pick my 51 lb. boat up over my head and place it on the blocks.  Then I lift up each end of the boat while sliding the blocks to the center of the roof.  If there is wind that will blow the blocks off the roof while you are picking up the boat, I just lay a strap across it and so far just the weight of the buckle has held them to the roof while lifting the kayak up.  Next year I'll probably pick up a factory rack which is narrower than Thule or Yakima, but a lot cheaper.  Until then, I don't foresee any problems.  The foam blocks work well."

Kayaking,35pdt0,investthis,4,Tue May 12 12:42:06 2015 UTC,"The offsets are called ""feather"" the top button position is for lefties the bottom for right handed people.  It is useful when paddeling in wind. The paddle blade that is up is perpendicular to the wind. I personally think It also saves your wrist if you have a more adjustable angle one. Usually when paddeling on the feather one hand grip stays stationary  and one rotates the blade in the palm.  The stationary hand is called the control hand.  I'm right handed but my left hand is my control hand."
Kayaking,35pdt0,lamasnot,1 point,Tue May 12 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it comes down to preference.  If you wanted to get really technical, I'm sure various offsets would make bracing easier, feathering easier, and easier on your wrists, but it seriously comes down to preference.   I have used a 30 degree offset my entire life for whitewater, but I have friends that paddle anywhere from a 0 degree offset to a 45 degree offset or even 90 degree offset. Hope that helps!"

That being said it is hard to find a boat that will perform well in WW and flat water.  Best to start off with a rec kayak keep off of anything more than class 1 rivers.  There are many good brands your best to look at online reviews to see if its has the quality, longevity, performance you are looking for.  Kayak companies usually have info on what size of boat is suitable for your weight. If your budget will support it there are some options for kayaks that will perform on WW and flat water.

Kayaking,35ntuf,Lendri,1 point,Tue May 12 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"Take it from me, I was in the same boat as you. I sold my Future Beach Trophy 126 and bought a Dagger Axis because I started doing more class 1 & 2 rivers. That turned into doing class 2/3+ and I my Dagger wasn't able to handle it. Anyways, I sold the Axis and got a Pyranha Shiva and I take that to lakes on the rare occasions that I go. I just feel that once anyone starts rivers, they're going to want more of them. Maybe that Jackson Rogue is a good idea since it seems to be more of a river crossover than rec crossover like my Dagger Axis was.   Edit: the other boats you listed are great choices also.

Kayaking,35ntuf,moscomule,1 point,Tue May 12 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"Dagger Katana or Remix XP would be my choice for crossover boats. I'm biased in that I started in a Remix XP, but quickly transitioned into a real whitewater boat (Remix 79). But, the Katana looks like it has the most legit setup of all the crossovers for running whitewater.   If you're serious about running whitewater, even just class II-III, get a full-on whitewater boat. There is a pretty good difference still between those and a 8-9' whitewater boat (river runner or creeker). You'll save yourself a boat acquisition step like many of us did (rec -> crossover -> whitewater).  Also, whitewater skills are hard to learn solo. Find a local club to get you introduced to people who can teach you the proper skills."

If you intend to do lots of paddling that has WW and flat water then either of these boats would be great.  If you are looking to do laps at your local WW area then I'd go with something without the skeg seeing as you have a great lake boat."

You mentioned he's 6'4"". What's his weight? what type of paddling will he be doing most? What type of water will he be paddling? It'll give us an idea of what style of kayak might be a good match."
Kayaking,35ldci,GogglesPisano,1 point,Mon May 11 22:08:03 2015 UTC,Sorry I haven't  been on til now. I would say easy paddling on calm waters. Nothing but small stream and lakes around
Kayaking,35nkar,randomly-generated,2,Mon May 11 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would agree with offspringin, get the Yakima foam blocks, otherwise the seat or horizontal rod holders might hang down too low. Always tie safety lines to the bow and stern as well as strapping it to the cross bars. That way if the rack fails, the boat won't shoot out in one direction or the other on the highway. (been there, done that.)"
Kayaking,35nkar,Noonproductions,1 point,Tue May 12 13:33:57 2015 UTC,Thanks will do.
Kayaking,35nkar,offspringin,1 point,Tue May 12 14:40:20 2015 UTC,I know it's not identical but my 02 Chevy Trailblazer stock racks have hauled a 17' Grumman Aluminum Canoe. Also routinely have a 12' & 10' kayak up there together.  I would think the trucks would be comparable being they are about the same year SUV.   Maybe someone with an Explorer will chime in
Kayaking,35nkar,offspringin,1 point,Mon May 11 23:52:14 2015 UTC,If I just put it over the stock crossbars should I put it top side facing down?  I don't see how I could do it any other way but I don't want to do something stupid by just assuming.

Kayaking,35jbfe,setthehook,1 point,Mon May 11 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"I have it(viper 10-4) and it serves me well. Its the only kayak I have paddled in ( besides a open top one in a small pond). It's decently heavy and wider then most I find, lots of storage though. I'vepaddling up a creek and a small lake with no problem, though the wideness makes it a bit challenging for shallow areas."
Kayaking,35khrr,StillARedditor,1 point,Mon May 11 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"I am in PNW and had the same requirements when shopping.  Size,  weight,  need to load it my self. I ended up with a Hurricane Santee 126. You might not want one that long,  but check it out for the oversized cockpit.  And it weighs about 42 lbs so I can shoulder it to the put ins.   I have basic jbars on my factory rack and can get it up there by myself. From the back of the SUV,  one end up first and then lift and push the rest up. I do need to climb on the wheels to strap it on,  or I could use a stool."
Kayaking,35khrr,misskrumpet,1 point,Mon May 11 06:42:04 2015 UTC,"As far as getting the boat on the car:  I cannot lift my boat onto the racks on my car.  However, it's very easy to slide it right up over the trunk onto the rack from the back.  (A towel protects the finish.)  The only lifting I do is hoisting the bow onto the trunk, and the rest is just sliding it up.  My cross-pieces comfortably hold two kayaks when I take a friend.  My kayaks are cheap ten-footers, but this worked for me  when I had a heavy fourteen-foot Old Town."
Kayaking,35khrr,spotlouise,1 point,Mon May 11 10:54:40 2015 UTC,"I am a petite female with medical problems who has a really hard time with car topping. I have narrow hips so width isn't an issue, but weight of the yak was critical. My roof rack is a Thule Glide. Once I get the front of the yak on the glides I can pick up the back end and slide it into place. I have a cheapo plastic step stool that I stand on to cinch the straps into place.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpv3DtKJE14  Here's a Kestrel 120 X which should be roomy and lightweight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwZUWQvPjs"
Kayaking,35jyea,J_Reece,2,Mon May 11 02:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well, to start, that Proline Perception S is a whitewater kayak.  For flat, open water, it seems people recommend ""longer is better"", but a boat with a rudder on it would probably be nice on the ocean."
Kayaking,35jyea,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon May 11 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I will skip on the Perception S then haha. Didn't really take too close of a look, but should have guessed with the lower price point. Now the one with the rudder is listed at $500, so would that be a good deal, or should I take a look at Tsunami and Avatar (kayak cart, cockpit cover, spray skirt, and a Bilge Pump included)? Also, as this would be my first kayak, what exactly would be the benefits of a rudder vs. a skeg, vs. nothing on the boat."
Kayaking,35jyea,lamasnot,1 point,Mon May 11 06:19:46 2015 UTC,Rudders fit on the top of the boat and flip down. It is cumbersome and annoying. Prone to scratch up your car and injure you.  Useless unless you have a poorly tracking boat or are going to go 678 miles across the ocean skip it.  Skeg = good. Small piece  of plastic that drops down out of the stern of the boat and helps tracking (going strait) without killing you.  I have found in my past 12 years of kayaking exactly 3 times I would have used a rudder over my skeg.  They take up a little rear hatch room but it's  worth it.  You can add a rudder to your boat easy enough but a skeg kinda has to have the spot molded in for it or your not going to be able to add it without massive effort and know how.
Kayaking,35jyea,fr500c,2,Mon May 11 09:01:24 2015 UTC,WS tsunami 140 is a solid boat. Great to learn on.
Kayaking,35jyea,lamasnot,1 point,Mon May 11 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"I was really between that one and the Avatar. The avatar was a little more appealing to me because it includes the kayak cart, cockpit cover, spray skirt, and a Bilge Pump? I don't know what that last thing is, but as you could probably guess this makes it more attractive at that price point."
Kayaking,35jyea,fr500c,1 point,Mon May 11 06:15:21 2015 UTC,Tsunami is a good boat but designed for a narrow hip paddler than a lot of women I've met.  Try it out on land. Usually you can sit in a plastic boat in the grass.
Kayaking,35jyea,lamasnot,1 point,Mon May 11 09:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'1"" 195 and paddled a Tsunami 145 for a season and it fit great."
Kayaking,35jyea,fr500c,1 point,Mon May 11 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad.  It's a nice boat to be sure but I'm a 5'10"" female and had issues with it at about 180 lbs. so... it may depend on body proportions etc..."
Kayaking,35jyea,fr500c,1 point,Tue May 12 12:55:44 2015 UTC,A bilge pump is to manually pump water out if you capsize. I've never used a kayak cart in my life and since you appear to be young... Put that thing on your shoulder not on a cart :) a bilge pump is about 30 bucks. Honestly don't buy the boat based on cheap accessories. Buy the best boat for you regardless of the little things they add. Unless it came with a really nice paddle you couldn't afford. The WS is still the better boat.
Kayaking,35jyea,KayakHipster,1 point,Mon May 11 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"Also, the Avatar is NOT what you want. Especially if you are still asking what a bilge pump is. It's a more advanced boat designed for surfing among other things. Trust me on this man, you will be 100% happier and a better paddler getting something more stable but plenty of fun like the WS."
Kayaking,35jyea,lamasnot,1 point,Mon May 11 14:41:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. The tsunami is a great starter boat that will let you grow into your paddling. There are others out there that will perform better in specific aspects, but the tsunami is a great all around boat. I feel like it's the Honda Civic of paddling. Or Corolla. The tsunamis are always seen on the water because they're forgiving and good to learn on. They also make them in so many sizes there's always one that'll fit you."

I use Palm Rock boots -- they're both light, compact, and flexible enough to fit in my boat as well as being tough, protective, and supportive enough for long hikes and portages over rocks. Decent grip as well.  If you want to go all-out on your water shoes, there's the Five-Ten and Astral offerings (water tennies/canyoneers and brewers/rasslers respectively). I don't have that kind of money, and if your dog eating one is a worry I'd probably avoid that."

I have never seen those before, I don't think I've seen people by me wear those (Wisconsin, US) but maybe I haven't looked. I like the idea though.   Do they get hot or stay cool. Do they keep sand out? I've had water shoes that let sand in through the sides/top and that is no fun."
Kayaking,35ikqn,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon May 11 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"They are mostly worn by whitewater and touring kayakers (serious paddlers), because they do a good job of keeping your feet warm and protected, and they stay on pretty well in rough water.  Most don't have very thick soles or good grip, so I'd go with something else if you're looking for a solid shoe for walking in also."

Kayaking,35ikqn,mrodgers83,1 point,Mon May 11 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think I originally paid around $90 but still expensive. They were worth it, or they would have been had they not been cut down in their prime before they had a chance to live a full life. They were very comfortable, fit well and handled the water well. They still had quite a few years left in them so I think the cost was justified.   That being said, since I have a leather eating predator lurching I should probably look for cheaper options.    Do you have any particular preference in the sandals you wear?"
Kayaking,35ikqn,BeerBellies,1 point,Mon May 11 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Do you have any particular preference in the sandals you wear?   Whatever I find to fit my wide feet.

Kayaking,35ior5,smallbutfierce,1 point,Sun May 10 19:28:34 2015 UTC,If it helps. My wife has the Fusion 124 (10ft) from Dicks. It's a cheap boat but it's served us well. The seat isn't super comfortable for more than 4 hrs. She uses a foam kneeling thing (for gardening) to sit on. It lacks any bells & whistles. Just a bare bones kayak. Has that rubber door thing that seals an area in the back. It doesn't track very straight.

Kayaking,35ior5,offspringin,1 point,Mon May 11 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"I wasn't super impressed with any of the sub 300 buck kayaks. Any of them work but at that price point they are all minimal send like. At the time I was pushing 300lbs and most the smaller boats are rated at 250. Your weight plus any gear/water and we take our dogs so I ended up with a fishing geared one, 12ft with 500lb capacity. Has a removable storage pod. Found one new with a crack in it (above the waterline). They knocked more off a sale price. Fixed the crack with some expensive 2 part glue & some HDPE plastic. Been going strong a few years now."
Kayaking,35i4i7,juliofuego92,1 point,Sun May 10 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of other attributes come into play with a paddle.   What type of boat are you paddling? What's the width of the boat? What style of paddling are you looking to do? Any materials in mind?   I'm guessing if you are at dicks trying to find a paddle, you're looking for a rec boat paddle in plastic. I would recommend if possible going for something slightly better - doesn't have to be top of the line. If you spend hours out on the water, a carbon shaft, fiberglass blade, or anything better than bottom of the line dicks paddle will make you enjoy yourself a lot more. You won't be as tired, will be able to paddle longer, better on your body and you'll enjoy yourself.   Also, it can be used as well. My main paddle as well as my wife's were bought used and we've gotten many years out of them.    Cheers"
Kayaking,35i4i7,KayakHipster,2,Sun May 10 16:57:40 2015 UTC,I had someone describe it to me as a one ounce savings in paddle weight is a pound every 16 strokes. That can easily equate to a couple pounds a minute. That can really add up over the course of the trip.   Obviously it doesn't really equate one to one but you get the picture.
Kayaking,35i4i7,hate_picking_names,1 point,Sun May 10 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"I just remember the difference was enormous. We started with regular cheap paddles from dicks (I think chute makes them?). After a year with them, we moved on to sea kayaks. In the process we were taking classes, and our instructors were getting rid of their used spare carbon fiber paddles for less than half price. We jumped on it and the change was incredible. We could all of a sudden spend the entire day on the water without complaining about being tired or sore. It makes a huge difference. The only problem is spending all that money if you're not completely certain that's the model, brand and style of paddling you want.  That's why I love swapping paddles with buddies to test everything I can get my hands on."

If sit on top, the rule of thumb is to go 230 unless it's really wide, then maybe go 240. If sit in, go 220, unless you've got some experience and like to go with a really high angle stroke, then I'd go 210. Your height has a role to play, but not as much as your boat type."

Can't believe how little time I have had to work on this one, but Spring has had me on the road doing all the Outdoor Shows and there just has not been much spare time.

Well the mini-cell seat is not in place but that won't show on my scales.  I was expecting a little lighter than my wife's (same design basically) because I used the light fabric, but they are the same.  Variations in wood probably account for the extra. Of course the change of paint color and extra paint could easily add a pound too."

It's got storage in the rear and a drink holder up front.  For the price, it will get you out on the water and will easily last several seasons as long as it's not heavily abused.  Looks to be a bit better hull design than the cheapie pelicans you see at dicks, etc."
Kayaking,35awrk,01v6cmro,1 point,Fri May 8 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"Not arguing with you at all, but as a pelican owner since last fall ($100 at Dunham's) what makes one hull design ""better"" than another?"
Kayaking,35awrk,01v6cmro,2,Sat May 9 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"From what I saw on it, just the general layout of how things are set up in the boat.  Shape of the cockpit, etc.  I've got a pelican myself (coleman badged, but the same boat) and it did me just fine for several years until I upgraded.  You get what you pay for.  These are entry level boats and if you scored a pelican for $100 out the door, you did very well on it!  I hope you get a lot of fun & enjoyment out of it this season."

My dad picked up a future beach 10.4 as well for $100 at the end of the season as well, and his is slower, but a hell of a lot more stable, and I like where his cupholder is. I bought mine to fish out of, as my truck doesn't have a hitch, but it has a 6’ bed. I think the 10.4 would've been a better choice for fishing, but for less than $250, I had a Yak, paddle, 3 rod holders, and PFD. I'm happy with it, though. Anyways, sorry for rambling.

Get yourself some Yakima railgrabs and crossbars.  Way better than OEM crossbars.  If you're going to carry two boats I'd also get some j-braces. EDIT: as such  Basement is fine.  Store it on it's side so you don't oilcan the hull.  Paddles do not come with a boat.  Spend $100 on a decent (and I'd recommend fiberglass) paddle such as an AquaBound StingRay or Werner Skagit.  My friends buy cheap paddles and have already spent more replacing them than I have on my single paddle.  I'd recommend a two-piece for many reasons.  These are just my personal preferences and there are of course zillions of other legit options."

Kayaking,35ance,ogie_oglethorpe,2,Fri May 8 15:20:40 2015 UTC,You should be able to pick up a standard kayak on cl for super cheap then (250 or so) You can either use pads and mount it on the roof racks or you can buy the Yakima Y racks. I've never had them but I'm pretty sure they need to mount ON a roof rack not a side rail so you might need to buy specific trails for them. Someone else should be able to answer that. A spray skirt wouldn't be a bad investment for you either.

I mean, I could just recommend you the one I got, because I'm pretty happy with it, but it may or may not suit your personal preferences.  If there is a place near you that lets you try some out before buying, I strongly recommend doing so."

I probably will not be able to take them out until next week, but I'm excited to just have them home! Here is an album the guy posted who I bought them from.

Kayaking,358ssf,mrodgers83,3,Fri May 8 10:09:39 2015 UTC,"Robbed, I wouldn't say.  Decent deal, sure.  The blue boat is $199 at Dick's.  Figure with a boat like that, no more than the $49 Dick's paddle I'd guess.  So, $250 for that boat gives the 2nd boat at $100, a decent deal.  What is the 2nd boat?  Nice ride too.  I have a 2010 V6.  You should have gotten the V6 :D  I carry with my work daily driver, so I don't know what the Rav4 has under the bumper for towhooks.  Better would be to get the loops you mount to a fender bolt under the hood.  Then you wouldn't be getting any abrasion on the paint of the vehicle from the straps rubbing."
Kayaking,358ssf,mrodgers83,1 point,Fri May 8 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"The red boat is this. I just bought it used. I wanted the better gas mileage and don't care too much for the speed/towing of the V6. That being said, they're both excellent engines and great cars."
Kayaking,358ssf,nfsnobody,1 point,Sat May 9 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"Future Beach.  I was trying to decide between those 2 you have or go with a little longer with the Sun Dolphin Aruba 12 until I found the Conduit 13 on Craigslist.  Craigslist is pretty lacking in my area where I've been seeing the boats you got asking more than you can buy them at Dick's or really good deals on really expensive kayaks.  As for the Rav4, looks like you live suburban.  I'm very very rural, I fly RC right in my back yard.  Being in PA and rural, We probably get better mileage out of the V6 than we would the 4 cyl.  My wife drives it, very aggressively I might add as she really loves the 269 hp, and averages 25-27 mpg in the summer (EPA highway is 26, just 1 below the 4 cyl.)  I think the 4 cyl would struggle on the hills we drive and mileage would suffer with increased throttle input over the V6.  Either way, it's a great car.  Oh and I am also brand new to this and excited as everyone else responding seems to be.  Been out on the lake once and the river once.  The river was a failure as being solo I want to go upstream and back down to my car at the launch.  I couldn't beat the current.  Perhaps as my skill improves."

Kayaking,358ssf,mikeclaudio,2,Fri May 8 13:11:52 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the new boats. FYI - Those front straps can and will rub a spot through your paint.  I find it best to run a strap through the grab loop in the back and tie that to the rack itself.  If you need some extra stability, also run a strap through the front loop and back to the rack.  This will keep it from sliding front/back and therefore getting loose.  NRS straps can't be beat. Enjoy!"
Kayaking,358ssf,mikeclaudio,2,Fri May 8 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting tying the bow and stern to the rack itself rather than the car?  The purpose of the bow and stern line is for safety in the event of a rack failure so that the boat doesn't project off your car into another's car.  If bow and stern is also tied to the rack along with the boats strapped down in the middle, they will become projectiles if the rack should fail for any reason, hence tying bow and stern to the vehicle itself."

Like a lab or pointer, etc. However, any dog is trainable and any dog is possible to have aggression issues. Adopting is an awesome thing to do. We've adopted a lot of pets. Breed is an influence but how they were raised and trained initially weighs a lot more.  Our family has had tons of labs who were awesome hunting dogs. We've also had labs who were dog aggressive and some who were just not trainable.  My current rescue is a pointer/pit mix. She is outrageously smart and crushes any training/training class we do. But she's highly aggressive towards almost all other dogs. Same is said for a family member's tiny yorkie terrier. Go figure.  My point is you can certainly narrow your choices down to known working/family friendly breeds but there's no guarantee.

Kayaking,358q27,BorealHound,3,Fri May 8 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"I paddled a zephyr 155 for 2.5 years and absolutely loved it. I'm 5'11, 165 lbs. it would fit you great. What's your shoe size?  It was a pleasure to paddle, learned to roll in it and always kept up with glass boats in groups doing fun things.   Pros   Extremely maneuverable. Turns on a dime.  Very very easy to edge Extremely playful. Likes rough water Great for surf since it's short Seat in my opinion is the best on the market for plastic boats Good hatches  Cons   Being 15.5 feet long, it won't be as fast as other boats out there. My group consists of mostly glass boats, and although I kept up with them, if they put the pedal down, I had to pump to keep up with 17 and 18 footers. Once again, no boat is good at everything.   Also, since it's 15.5, hatch space is limited compared to longer boats. You'll have to go ultra light and plan your packing ahead of time. Weekend trips are all good, but packing light.   Skeg system isn't the best, but if you take care of it it should be ok.   Foot pedals can slide on you when capsized, but if you wind up getting the boat let me know and I'll send you photos of an easy fix with a little foam and zip ties.   I'd say, if you get the chance, (or maybe you already did) paddle the tempest 165 since stores will have it, check out the fit and feel, and imagine it being more responsive and playful in everything you do. That's what I did. I had to order mine since no shop carried it and I was not disappointed.   Don't go for the zephyr 160. At your size it'll feel like a bathtub.   Let me know if you have any questions. I also have videos of paddling it.   Cheers!"
Kayaking,358q27,KayakHipster,1 point,Fri May 8 12:14:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I'll at least check out the Tempest 165 to get the feel for it. Also, per the other guy's response, if it seems like the extra foot will make a big difference I'd consider that boat as well.  I'm a size 11 shoe.   The fear I have of getting a large boat is exactly the bathtub feeling. The 17'+ boats I've tried just all seem like they're built for larger people, or, if they're not, they're radically more expensive."
Kayaking,358q27,KayakHipster,2,Fri May 8 12:38:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't completely agree with that post. Just because the 155 is under 16 ft doesn't make it less sea worthy. It's a full sea kayak designed to be a bit more maneuverable. I know many people that like taking the alchemy out to surf, and that's 14'.   The 160 will feel like a bathtub to you, since you're on the slender side. Same happens to me. I'm tall and slender, so when I tried lots of boats before I upgraded out of my zephyr, they all had to be the low volume version. If you notice, the tempest 165 is the low deck version of the tempest 170. Same for the zephyr 155 vs 160. I have size 11 feet as well.   If you were going for a used glass boat, I can recommend some others for you.   Actually, maybe add these non glass/composite onto your list for research if the parameters of the zephyr 155 are what you're looking for. These are all playful and I'm sure can be found used.

Kayaking,358q27,NotSayingJustSaying,2,Fri May 8 13:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'10 170lb.  I used to guide on Superior and have paddled many, many boats.  My favorite was an 18' fiberglass boat by Valley.  It was a large volume boat and I enjoyed it empty and packed to the gills.    If you're going to spend your time hitting the surf on the beach get a ww boat.  If you want to do coastal paddling & camping, get a full size boat.  I cannot think of a real good reason to get a boat in the 13-16' range.  They're too long to be good in the rivers and rapids, and too short to be good over distance and hauling loads.  At least, that's my opinion."
Kayaking,358q27,KayakHipster,2,Fri May 8 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Valid points. Still though, having had that particular boat for a couple of years, and now having had a 17+ footer for a while, I can recommend the zephyr without reservations. I highly enjoyed it. Very true, if I want to camp, I prefer my longer boat - but for day paddles and weekend trips, it served me well while it was my main boat. Also, it made learning to edge and turn easy since it was so playful.   Just like yours, it's only my opinion. It's not often that someone in my size happens to be looking for the exact boat that served me well.   Which 18 footer did you enjoy most?"
Kayaking,358q27,NotSayingJustSaying,1 point,Fri May 8 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback. I do realize that there are definite drawbacks to the size range that I listed. There is also a Prijon Kodiak for sale on CL that I've been looking at as well, and will consider (17 feet). I also tried the Tempest 170 today and liked the fit of it (but not necessarily the price point...). I'll be looking around and hopefully trying some boats out before committing."

That said, I don't recommend anything under 16' for a Big Lake... and it's probably a good idea to get something in the 18' range.  A sea kayak is what it is, don't compromise.

In fact I check craigslist every day for boats and I already have a few that come to mind.  Rudders are ok but in my personal opinion they are terrible, you do not want them because they break, especially on an alder kayak such as this.  This boat also lack any bulkheads at all! Not to mention it is just so damn outdated."
Kayaking,357q22,Euh_reddit,1 point,Thu May 7 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"It totally depends on the kayak because there are a ton of different hatch closure types. For example:  Rubbery KajakSport or similar  These hatches often leak when they get old and tired, try using armorall or a similar product which hydrates such materials. This will make them softer and seal better as a result.  Hatches on a wooden kayak, or any hard-shell hatch cover  Usually in this case it comes down to having enough pressure on the lid, this can be assisted by changing the way it's rigged. If you simply have some buckles going over it, it will probably leak. There are a lot of options such as using a cam-lever closure, or bungees beneath the deck. Make sure your gasket is also in good shape.  Hinged hard shell lids which have a lever closure  These are bad and never work. If you want them to remain watertight after a capsize, close them permanently with some marine sealant. unfortunately there's not really a way to improve the seal with these, they just suck.  Screw off access lids  Make sure to keep these clean, salt build up coupled with a shallow handle can make these extremely hard to open. They have a small gasket that must be kept clean and lubricated. But they will probably still leak a little.  Foam bulkhead in a poly boat  These often become loose due to the flex of the hull, and we usually seal any gaps with a silicone marine caulk called royalex. It works.  /thread"

Yea sure maybe it's not 100% safe but who would have ever made the first airplane if everyone worried about safety over building cool stuff.   He could always carry one of those emergency scuba tanks that gives you 5 or 10mins of air. They are small a canister which goes in your mouth and gives divers a emergency system.  What I find odd is the go power almost seems as if it's pedal power. It was like some sort of tail/paddle that moved side to side like a fish tail.

Kayaking,352xcd,Thjoth,3,Wed May 6 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"Pressure at 20 feet is 23 PSI.  If his hatch is two square feet, that's a little over 500lbs of pressure pushing down on the outside of the hatch.  He wouldn't be able to move it until the kayak fills completely with water and equalizes the pressure.  Let's suppose that it doesn't spring a leak, though, since that's probably unlikely.  Let's suppose instead that his ballast system malfunctions and the kayak drops to the bottom and can't resurface.  So there he is, basically stuck in a coffin, with a couple hours of air to think about the decisions he made that led him to this point."

Kayaking,352xcd,ignorantwanderer,2,Thu May 7 04:17:30 2015 UTC,"Pressure at 20ft below is only 8.67 psi.  Source Edit: This ""source's"" math is wrong.   So really, as long as he doesn't dive to deep I think he could force his way out and escape.   Edit 2: according to /u/mrgreen4242 This submarine is apparently pressurized so that there is no difference between the outside and the inside. I guess this makes more sense because this way the fiberglass (?) isn't crushed by the water's pressure."
Kayaking,352xcd,Cthulhu_Was_Right,2,Thu May 7 04:25:31 2015 UTC,"Pressure in salt water increases by right at 1atm (14.69psi) every 10m (33ft).  At sea level, you're already experiencing 1atm.  At 10m, that pressure is 2atm or 29.38psi.  That means that every meter adds 0.1atm or 1.47psi of pressure.   So at 20ft (6.09m), the pressure is, by my math, 1.60atm or 23.57psi.  I know this pressure is correct  because I'm not dead on the bottom of some body of water  somewhere due to oxygen toxicity from nitrox, but don't take my word for it because here's a calculator that's correct and shows that my math checks out.  I don't know what the pressure is inside the cabin, but I assume he keeps it at 1atm, which gives us a ΔP of 0.6atm between the two environments.  This is where your 8.67psi comes in.  That pressure differential on a two square foot orifice is equal to 208lbs of force on that opening. However, you have to remember that to move the hatch, you also have to move that water out of the way, which adds a significant amount of resistance. Also, even if you can bench that much, the cramped confines of the kayak means you can't actually exert your full strength on the hatch, so the odds are good that you'd either need to be rescued or die down there."
Kayaking,352xcd,n9ucs,1 point,Thu May 7 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"Huh. I guess my source was wrong. But are we talking about 20ft or 20m?   But even though lifting the hatch would be hard, you only need to open it a tiny bit before the seal is broken and the whole thing ""pops"". Bottom line here is to have some way to communicate with friends/ family so that you could be rescued if anything happens. Always plan for the worst case scenario."
Kayaking,352xcd,mrgreen4242,1 point,Thu May 7 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"20ft, or 6m.  20m would add  two whole atmospheres for a total of  3atm.  30m is 4atm, 40m is 5atm, and so on.  20m is the safe limit for the basic level of recreational SCUBA, and 35m is the absolute safe limit for advanced recreational SCUBA.  Past 30m your body starts experiencing things like nitrogen narcosis (you get really damn drunk, which is a problem when you have to be monitoring your own life support system), and nitrogen saturation in your soft tissues speeds up to the point that decompression procedures are needed on ascent after spending only a few minutes at depth, so specialized training and breathing gases (tailored nitrox formulations and trimix) are required to go deeper.  At around 60m, which is 7atm, the oxygen content in normal air becomes very toxic and will kill you quickly with no warning by causing your nervous system to go haywire and shut down, so further advanced training and even more complicated breathing gases containing less oxygen like trimix (which contains helium instead of a portion of nitrogen and oxygen) in conjunction with closed circuit rebreathers to reduce the number of gas cylinders to something remotely reasonable are needed to push deeper, and decompression from those depths (to avoid decompression sickness, aka the bends, aka dropping dead instantly or being paralyzed for life at a minimum upon surfacing) takes hours.  Changing your environmental pressure by just a couple atmospheres is a big deal, physiologically.  With lifting the hatch, you would have to lift it and keep it lifted until the two environments matched in order to take the pressure off.  Meaning, you'd have to keep it cracked open until water flooded the vessel.  You might be able to do it with a lever or something.  A way to communicate to observers on the surface, along with rescue divers prepared to raise the whole vessel, would really be the minimum in terms of safety."
Kayaking,352xcd,RambleMan,1 point,Thu May 7 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. According to the Huffington post article, the sub is pressurized so that it would be easy to open the hatch, however, because of the pressure the threat of ""the bends"" still applies. Really it depends on how far down he would go before surfacing might become deadly. However, at 20ft down this isn't an issue."
Kayaking,352xcd,IronColumn,2,Thu May 7 15:37:18 2015 UTC,A post further down indicates that the air inside is pressurized so the hatch will open with about as much ease as it does on the surface.

We've had them for a little over a year and my only complaint is that while playing in the surf I lost one of the deck straps (i.e., it was my fault).  They've primarily been used in Colorado, but we've also used them throughout Michigan and on Lake Winnipeg.  Performance-wise, they're agile, light, and a great bit of fun (a little bit like driving an MG B: super fun if not the best that's out there).  So far we've done just a few overnight trips. All of them have been 1-3 nights total. We had no issue fitting in tarp/sleeping bags/food.

Kayaking,34yhpq,GuyWhoHikes,2,Tue May 5 21:14:01 2015 UTC,I have yet to hear from anyone that has tried one. Are they any good?
Kayaking,34yhpq,deck_hand,2,Tue May 5 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"It's a very neat idea, but I think the cost is way too high.  I'm hoping they sell a lot of them, so that maybe they can get some economies of scale going and reduce the price for future models."
Kayaking,34yhpq,crockett5,2,Tue May 5 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Seems they have only gotten more expensive. I'd be interested in having one, but I'm damn sure not paying $1,500 for some fancy folded up plastic sign boards.   There is also the issue of how will the kayak hold up if it gets a crease in the plastic. Like if you beach it a bit hard or something and it happened to flex the nose section too much. I just can not see the ""value"" at a $1k which was their price last year much less the current price of $1.5k.   They are just pricing them selves out of the ballpark if you ask me.. Might as well buy a folbot or one of the other higher end folding kayaks at that price."
Kayaking,34yhpq,dementedsoldier,1 point,Wed May 6 00:01:37 2015 UTC,If you go to the site. The videos show its actually quite durable. They try it on rocks and toss off a roof I believe.  But yeah...

He was putting it together at a lake for the first time. I asked a few questions, but he seemed like he was a bit frustrated so I didn't bug him about it.   I was hoping to come back by and see how it did on the water but he was gone by the time I came back. Either out far on the lake or left. That's the only time I've ever seen one..

Kayaking,34yhpq,crockett5,1 point,Wed May 6 15:35:32 2015 UTC,Well my deal is I have a old vw camper van and travel around the country. I had a folbot but it took up too much room.

I'm not against building my own stuff and I've done a lot of research of skin on frame kayaks and DIY folders. My deal is I want a folder which does ok in normal rivers/lakes but can also handle class 2&3 rivers with in reason. Of course that only exists  with inflatables but they really suck on open water."

Price must have gone up in the last month because I was looking at it a month ago when it was listed $1195 I think.  Now it's $1275.  My thoughts on this or an inflatable was I carry my bike in the car every day to work to ride right after work.  I had thoughts of carrying one of these to work every day as well, thus I could do either directly after work.  I don't want to be carrying a kayak on the roof every single day.  I was also researching Advance Elements inflatable for the same reason.  It came down to cost for me, I needed a lot of work on the car and used all my kayak funds on the car, so I bought a boat off Craigslist.  After seeing pictures of foldables or inflatables in the back of an SUV, it put in the perspective for me that I would not be able to carry both the bike and kayak inside the car daily for an after work workout."

I got it last spring to ""get my feet wet"" and like you didn't want to blow buku cash on something I didn't have room for or even know if I was going to enjoy it. I think I paid like $300 for dual seats, 2 paddles, pump and stitch kit. I live on the coast so I do take it to the beach and surrounding islands. I take my 25lb dog with us and have gone over/through oyster beds with no problems. Honestly its a good  first kayak I would say it does what its supposed to pretty well. By all means a hard shell would be better at being a ""kayak"" but so far I haven't had any issues where I needed a hardshell. My favorite part about it is that its inflatable, meaning I can throw it in the back of my car or throw it in my closet and not have to worry too much about it. But if you're looking to buy one for the long run and know for a fact you're going to love and use it frequently then it would probably suggest just going hardshell. Hope this helps."
Kayaking,34z9z2,tametrees,1 point,Wed May 6 12:54:28 2015 UTC,Yes... but Sea Eagle puts a lot more effort into their products than Sevylor.  Most of the Sea Eagles have higher pressure drop stitch floors and the like.  Sevylor are just PVC pool floats.

Kayaking,34x08w,ManBearRoo,1 point,Tue May 5 14:09:05 2015 UTC,Its right off of the Roanoke River.  Right outside of Williamston North Carolina you make a right onto Devils Gut Creek and the platform is a few miles down on the left.  You will need to go to roanokeriverpartners.com to rent the platform for 25 dollars.  The platform is called Barred Owl Roost.  When  I went the Black Fish were spawning in the swamp and they would smack against the kayak as we made our way to the platform.

Kayaking,3503ch,wobblingwheeb,3,Wed May 6 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"Lots of factors come into play. Your first kayak is designed to be extremely stable, but that only accounts for certain conditions. ""Tippy-er"" kayaks are designed that way to allow for more confused conditions to not affect you as much. Seat time is the best cure for it, your body gets more and more used to it. Surf skis though, those are so tippy that you usually need to continue paddling to maintain good stability. On the other hand, they are built for some ridiculous speeds.   Anyway, don't use ""not tipping"" as a source of pride. We're all in-between swims. The more comfortable you get with falling in and getting back in your boat, the better a paddler you'll be. I now am confident when I want to do advanced maneuvers where I have to lean way over, and therefore have better control of my boat. If I was worried about capsizing, I would not be performing these strokes correctly. I know you mention you'll have all your gear — practice paddling a lot without gear until you're more comfortable, and then it won't be a big deal.   Just spend more butt time and it'll pass.   Cheers!"
Kayaking,3503ch,KayakHipster,2,Wed May 6 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"Not just butt time, but butt time with someone who knows what they are doing. Kayaking skills are hard to learn on your own. It really helps to have an experienced friend."

Kayaking,3503ch,TuckerGrover,1 point,Wed May 6 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"All things have strengths and weaknesses. You were comfortable in your old boat and that's okay. This kayak might cut into the water more and give you more feedback, but I would guess with time you will learn how to feel it. Your center of gravity is probably also higher, which feasibly could cause more flipping, but could offer some advantages with visibility, etc...  I would love a kayak that tracks better even if it causes me to be more aware of how I'm balanced. Good luck!"
Kayaking,3503ch,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed May 6 00:42:47 2015 UTC,"More time will help. Go out and play with no gear and be prepared to flip. Do it intentionally so you can practice recovery. Work on holding the boat on an edge so you know how far you can go.   Also, pack your gear with the heavy stuff low and tie it down in waterproof bags. Dont take a bunch of extra crap. Kayaking is very prone to water and flipping, even when things go right. Be prepared for both and go relax. Oh, and tensing up makes you less stable, so again, relax. Get your hips loose and keep a paddle ready to brace."
Kayaking,3503ch,PammyLZ,1 point,Wed May 6 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"I like to get in my kayak and sit in it with about a foot of water below me at the shore. I find, what I like to call my stable points. I sit there and I press down on one side of my hip to lean the side of the kayak into the water as far as I can go without actually tipping over. Then I do the other side. It lets me know how much to one side my kayak can lean to, without tipping me over. Every time I do this before heading out to open water, it calms my nerves because I know that I lean a little to one side I won't tip over. And in about a foot of water if you tip over, you could probably just catch yourself and right yourself back up.  I have yet to tip over, but I am a beginner and I've only been out in my kayak a handful of times. It's something I have to do to myself - tip myself over on purpose. I have a fear of being trapped if I were to tip over and I need to get over that. I hope to accomplish that this year. I almost drowned when I was 10, and that feeling of being pulled under the water has sorta never left me. I love my PFD. It has taken a lot of the fear I have right out of me when on the water."
Kayaking,34waj7,Nisspecvan,6,Tue May 5 02:13:24 2015 UTC,"Put on your PFD, go to some shallow water and try to capsize. You will probably find it is not as easy to tip over as you initially think. With time it will start to feel very comfortable and stable."
Kayaking,34waj7,Guillemot,1 point,Tue May 5 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"Expanding on that, here is a former sprint coaches (in-)complete guide to balance drills:  (I'm not responsible if you drown, don't be dumb)   Hold your paddle above your head with both hands for as long as you can, then helicopter it.  feather and lean out to the side as far as you can take 5-11 (odd number so you alternate sides) strokes, then brace hard and try to get water to come in over the gunwale by driving your hip down. Also teaches the loose hips. take 5 strokes, then hold paddle parallel to shoulders, and trunk twist back and forth as far as you can go (also useful for teaching trunk twist) Javelin toss: Throw your paddle like a javelin. Paddle to it with your hands. (Do on a calm day if you ever want to see your paddle again).  Paddle  with your feet in the water, not in the boat.  Paddle with your eyes closed.  Stand up.  Pass your paddle to yourself underneath your boat.  Find a buddy with a small (9 hp) motor boat. Get him to buzz around you and you try to keep your balance and your paddle above the water. Works best as a competition.  Paddle with your paddle upside down, or backwards. Might not apply as much to flat blades as wings though.    Do these, get better at balance."
Kayaking,34waj7,moosekayak,5,Wed May 6 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon with chocalotstarfish and say, if the boat is so tippy, more of a reason to have the pfd on. When you fall in (and trust me, we all fall in, all the time), the pfd makes it a lot easier to get back in your boat. Especially if it's so tippy — it'll be just as tippy trying to get back in.   Welcome and enjoy!"
Kayaking,34waj7,KayakHipster,3,Tue May 5 11:26:32 2015 UTC,Primary stability gets better when it is moving.  Eventually you'll be comfortable with it when you are still too.  Being tense and rigid rather than relaxed at the hips is what makes it feel 'tippy'.  It won't feel like this when you relax :-)

I had to look 2 hours away, but finally snagged the Perception Sport Conduit 13, which I had looked at every time I was at Dick's Sports for $600, for half the cost.  I was figuring I was going to be stuck with a $200-300 Pelican boat from Dick's and bought the Conduit for $275 on Craigslist.  It's not a fantastic boat anywhere close to the expensive stuff out there, but a huge difference than the $200 Pelican Trailblazer I was going to get.  For the same cost, I have a narrower boat with a decent seat and back support, and front and rear sealed bulkheads.  I saw and missed a deal on a Perception Carolina 14 for $500.

From the dock, sit on the edge of the dock, feet onto the floor of the boat, rotate and plop your butt down in the seat.  I do have trouble plopping the butt down.  At my weight, it's more of a crash, LOL.  At the river, I floated parallel to the shore.  I put my paddle behind the seat across over to the shore with the other paddle blade.  Bend down backwards holding onto the cockpit edge with one hand, paddle shaft putting weight onto the end of the paddle that is on shore with the other hand.  This stabilized the boat.  When I put my feet in, my weight started to push it down and stabilized it on the bottom of the shoreline.  Rotate and plop the butt into the seat (again, crash into the seat in my case.  At least, that's how I did it.  This is with cold water that I didn't want to start off walking in.  Warmer water later in the summer, I will just wade out, straddle the boat, and plop my butt down bringing my feet in last.  Getting out with my fat rear end is a totally different story."
Kayaking,34y2ip,mrodgers83,1 point,Tue May 5 17:45:41 2015 UTC,I don't use a skirt (go in the summer in Wisconsin) but I was taught to use the paddle as you described.
Kayaking,34y2ip,hate_picking_names,2,Sun May 10 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"Seal launch were possible, put skirt on before launching, bow first. Lean forward for balance and stability and back before you hit the water. Use a combination of hand and paddles, but definitely have your paddle in your hands/ don't want to leave that behind or have it get stuck. On lakes you can land in the same spot, on rivers get your car at the take out before hand, or arrange transportation back. DON'T FORGET YOUR KEYS. I usually try to beach myself as much as possible to ease on  getting out. Bring some rope it will make it a lot easier to drag the boat out."
Kayaking,34y2ip,LolzYourMother,1 point,Tue May 5 19:51:18 2015 UTC,Just hide your keys on your car. It's far better than losing them in the river or forgetting them in another shuttle vehicle.

My home club didn't have a dock for the first few years I was training though, so that was off of a river beach. Either way it's basically the same: put the boat in the water. Step into boat. If you're in the water, you don't do the straddle, because that's how you break your gunwwale. The boat doesn't touch the sand, because if you do, you should have to swim your next race.   I put my skirt on before I push off because it's really hard to get the back of it while on the water.   Also boats never ever ever (x20) touch sand."

Also, you don't have to break the bank getting all top of the line gear. I've found a lot of my stuff on Amazon, or through online kayak shops, sometimes through sales. Or if I had a gift card somewhere, I'd look for some of these items. Space blankets are usually a buck a pop, and I've used a total of two in the last two years, and only while winter camping.

Kayaking,34uylh,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue May 5 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"No problem. I personally like regular neoprene booties. I've used these for over 2 years and they still hold up perfectly.

For the summer I'll use thinner/smaller ones. I think it depends on where you're paddling. For us, we gotta have sole protection in case of rocks or oyster beds since we do coastal kayaking. If you dry them after use they won't stink, that's usually the biggest con on them. Or sometimes they can get hot if they're too thick on a hot day. But I usually get wet a lot and they don't bug me too much.   My wife is a big fan of the 5 toed shoes for the warmer seasons, and uses the same booties as I the rest of the time.   Some of the paddlers in my group like sandals/shoes like keens, etc. I've also seen NRS booties, etc. I can't speak to WW paddling, but I would guess due to rocks they'll use similar booties with rubber soles. I'll let others chime in."

I could build a small frame to run the length of it and ratchet strap it to the top of the trailer, This leaves 5 feet ish off of the front/back that I could caution flag. The center would be well supported, and the ends shouldn't tweak it at all.   Imma sleep on it, but this sounds like the way to do it, thanks"
Kayaking,34w264,kryrinn,2,Tue May 5 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"You could also get two 16 ft 2x6's to use as bunks to cradle the boat. Toenail in or brace in so that the 2"" is attached to the frame and obviously top 2"" touching the boat. Cut pool noodles in half hot dog style and slip over top the rails you just built to protect the boat. You might need a 2' wide or whatever works for your boat's width board joining the two boards at either in to keep lateral swaying under control. If you use a 2x4 at either end (not centered not to the top but flush with the bottom) you should be fine and have clearance for the boat to sit nicely in there."

Long trips are possible, didn't have any wind issues or anything until western KS. You'll need to set the boat with even overhang on the front and rear, and run straps from the end of the boat to under the bumper. Mine have pulley things to add more tension.  Keeps the end from bouncing and more supported."

Kayaking,34w264,mrodgers83,2,Tue May 5 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid the pulleys, FWIW. You can crack a boat's hull just by tightening straps by hand or with a cam strap, a pulley is overkill. Especially with a bow or stern tie down , although the Mako lacks harness points for that, so you'll be fine.   The other thing to look out for is alignment - make sure your boat isn't crooked. We had crooked boats once and it was limiting our gas mileage by... a lot. We fixed it and could travel 15 km/h faster with the same mileage."
Kayaking,34w264,kisielk,1 point,Wed May 6 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"A v-bar would be ideal, but if you can support it on the cab roof as well as the rack in the bed there should not be more than 2' overhanging at either end.  You also don't have to go 80MPH.  It adds a lot of travel time to go slower, but hopefully you don't have to take it on long hauls very often."

This started out one very windy day, and I thought I could maybe sail us back by making a sail with my raincoat and two paddles. It worked and it was crazy fun! So I went home, got online and saw that there is such a thing as a kayak sail :). Shortly after sea eagle started to come out with sails for their kayaks https://www.seaeagle.com/Accessories/sail. First we got the quick sail which is very simple - two bars in a X shape, with an upside down triangular sail in the top of the X. It's very fun, easy to just stow on board and pop it up at the opportune moment. You can only sail with the wind of course. The later we got their sail rig (similar to the sail rig on the link above, though they don't sell the sail rig for kayak anymore) which is more elaborate - there are leeboards, a mast etc,it takes about ten minutes to set up for two people, you definitely have to set it up before launching. Super fun and you can sail upwind. Anyways overall we have had a blast, I will say that you need good physical fitness and a good sense of balance and reflexes to manage the sail rig. I can definitely see tipping over and I always where a best which I never wear for just kayaking on flat water. Have fun, don't hesitate to ask me any questions. P.s. since ours is an inflatable kayak, this basically means that I fit a two person sailboat inside my corolla which I think is very cool!"
Kayaking,34p289,yuckyucky,1 point,Sun May 3 12:03:52 2015 UTC,That does sound cool! Is there any advantage to an inflatable over a regular kayak besides transport?
Kayaking,34p289,yuckyucky,1 point,Sun May 3 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons. Pros: transportation and storage are easy. Super comfortable (imagine lying down on a big mattress under covers floating down a river under the stars...). Very stable (can dive from it, climb back in, paddle it standing up). You can carry a lot (its kind of more canoe-shaped, i.e. open deck). The seats are configurable so we can be 1, 2 or 3 people, we can lie down, face each other to have lunch, etc. The cons would be: its slower than a hardshell kayak (more drag), and will last less long (our first one lasted about 12 years, I think this one will last longer). I think its probably heavier but Im not sure (it`s bigger so maybe hard to compare)."

Kayaking,34m84j,Myatariisbusted,2,Sun May 3 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly my favorite part of kayak surfing (the few times I've done it) is plowing headlong into a wave that breaks on my chest.  My last surf trip was (foolishly) while there was a hurricane offshore in the Atlantic last year, so we had 3-6 foot waves which were fun, but 30mph offshore winds. I know know: offshore winds = don't go surfing (at least at my skill level)"

Kayaking,34marn,TheFlyingDavenport,3,Sat May 2 13:05:13 2015 UTC,"It would be decent for a first time kayak.  Any person new to kayaking might be tempted to buy a cheap two-piece or a flimsy unibody, but this is very sturdy.  My parents bought old towns, but a little bigger models, and they love them.  You might want a slightly bigger yak down the line.   Do you plan on fishing at all?  If so, I'd look at others, which might be a little more stable and open.  Most fisherman don't like the sit-inside kind.   Hope that helps."

Kayaking,34k7ph,kiwicelt,2,Fri May 1 21:34:15 2015 UTC,So we are asking Kayakers around Ireland to help us with a charity event for the people of Nepal on the 10th of May. Our Pledge to Paddle is to raise funds for this country that has allowed so many Kayakers over the years to enjoy their rivers and people.  We have set up a Facebook page with more details and listings of the clubs and people that are running events on the day.  We'd love if your club or paddling group would organise a trip on the 10th with donations collected from all participants. More info to follow but spread the word to anyone you know who would be interested.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Irish-Kayakers-support-for-Nepal-Earthquake/1663898953830988

Kayaking,34l82u,aracauna,2,Sat May 2 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, questioning a kayak or canoe... Ultimately I chose a kayak.   I wanted to be able to go out to the lake anytime I wanted, but I also wanted to be able to take some friends or be able to do a paddling/camping trip with friends. But in all likelihood 9 time out of 10 it will be me going at it alone. I figured a canoe would be hard to handle solo without any prior experience so I opted for a kayak. And I'm glad I did!   There is a ton of space on the kayak for gear so I can still go camping if I want. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to take my dog along with me... But so far I am very happy with the kayak! I just need my friends to get some too!"
Kayaking,34l82u,coolbeans_bro,1 point,Sun May 3 14:26:20 2015 UTC,me and a few friends paddle in jacksonville all the time. I don't have canoe experience so I asked my friends who did and they all said kayak. It's much easier to maneuver in the small creeks around this area because kayaks are much more agile in thee water. Even the sea kayaks which I what I paddle.
Kayaking,34l82u,The_Brian_Davis,1 point,Sat May 2 11:28:57 2015 UTC,"Get a canoe. Something with a symmetrical hull like a Wenonah Adirondack, Nova Craft Pal, or Mad River Explorer. Those symmetrical boats can be paddled by either one person or two. You'll have more space and flexibility for everyone plus space for overnight gear.   Kayaks are not significantly more agile in the water, you just have to know how to handle a canoe.   The downside to those boats is that they're expensive, they used to start at about $1400 IIRC. Try and find a used one."
Kayaking,34k7hx,Tgg161,3,Fri May 1 21:32:25 2015 UTC,The latex will get looser with time. My dry suit felt a bit tight when I got it but now I don't even notice any more.

Problem is, I wanted to mount to a heavy board up above the ceiling joists and had to drill a small hole through the joist that is in the center and the rope (heavier rope than what came with the hoist) hangs up in the hole and only lets one side raise and lower.  I can't hang on a wall.  1 wall covered with cabinets and workbench, 1 wall is the door, 1 wall with exterior door and door to attached shed, and the only clear wall already holds my ladders and a bunch of tools and jigs for the table saw."

Kayaking,34hohv,nittanyvalley,1 point,Fri May 1 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"So it can fit in our cars easier. We both have small cars.. nissan centra (me) and honda civic (gf). If you know of any really great hard shell ones that could fit easily in one of those, id be happy to check it out!"
Kayaking,34hohv,doplebanger,2,Mon May 4 02:23:15 2015 UTC,Does it have to be inflatable? If so then NRS has a ton of rafts. Also there is a brand called Alpaca Rafts that makes a small package inflatable kayak.
Kayaking,34hohv,Ostirious,1 point,Fri May 1 07:43:00 2015 UTC,I would like it to be only because we do not have the best cars for transporting hardshell ones..its much easier to be able to fold it up so it fits in our trunks.  Bur thank you! I will check them out :D
Kayaking,34hohv,Ostirious,2,Mon May 4 02:20:05 2015 UTC,"I bought a Sea Eagle SE370 with Pro Package for $340 from Amazon and all I can say is that it performs very well, is comfortable and best of all is very easy to store and carry. This kayak had been great and I had use it on a calm river and on salt water with ease. The wind can slightly get you off course, but is not terribly bad that you cannot handle by paddling to reposition yourself. The kayak is surprisingly tough for being inflatable and the seats (also inflatable) from the Pro Package are comfortable and this model can carry two people with ease. I haven't tried kayaking with two people on water yet because I didn't have a second PFD but from my test at home both me (5'11"") and my brother (6'3"") manage to fit, but without our legs fully extended.   Inflating the kayak takes around 10-15 minutes using a very good air pump that comes with it. The paddles are awesome because you can assemble them easily (4 pieces each) and allows you to position them for different paddling styles. In one both paddles are in the same position and in another one of the paddles is slightly twisted so you need to rotate your arm to correctly paddle forward. I'm still a beginner so I'm not completly sure what difference does this make (any explanation would be great), but I found that leaving it both in the same position to be easier to use.  For more conform while transporting it around I'm using this compact foldable hand truck because once you fold up the kayak and store everything in the bag it weights around 30-35 pounds. You can carry it on your back without any problems, but in my case I use the hand truck whenever I can to prevent possible muscles spasm on my back.  They also have this model that is around 2 feet shorter that the one I bought. I bought the bigger one because I'm quite big (wanted to play it same) and I also wanted to be able to kayak with some friends or family. I'm quite happy that I bought the bigger one because I fit well along with my 10L waterproof bag and with enough space to carry many other things."
Kayaking,34hohv,BigAngryGorilla,1 point,Sat May 2 02:36:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I am going to have her look at that one and see if she likes it :)  I see its a two seater... does that make it hard to go out in it by yourself?
Kayaking,34hohv,BigAngryGorilla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:22:03 2015 UTC,"Not at all and you will have a lot of empty space to put all your stuff. The only downside is when you are kayaking on windy conditions. The kayak tends to be push by the wind causing it to move away from a straight path, but you can easily reposition the kayak by paddling back and forth. When you kayak with two people the wind is not as problematic because the kayak has more weight on it."

Kayaking,34hzn1,roanokephotog,2,Fri May 1 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"Rudders are really intended for Long boats in wind and sea.  A rudder on a short wide boat is silly and would only encourage bad paddling technique.  Focus on fundamentals of paddling, and when you get a longer boat you'll really gain performance.  I think you're meaning a skeg, which is a non-moveable fin.  Even they don't help a small boat track much better.  I can paddle my girlfriends short-as-hell and beamy little plug perfectly straight using only one side using various strokes.  Have fun, and pay attention to how paddling differently affects how your boat behaves!"

Kayaking,34gmg8,jahallah,3,Fri May 1 04:06:24 2015 UTC,They make fancy cords to hold your paddle. We just used paracord and small carabiners to clip it to the boat. You don't want to lose your paddle. We also use the waterproof box for phone/keys etc. I tie that to the boat as well. In the winter I put a folded towel at the bottom of the yak. Keeps my legs warmer. Have fun.

Kayaking,34gmg8,offspringin,2,Fri May 1 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"The best purchases I've ever made for my 'yaks are additional tie-downs and inside nets (I'm assuming by ""rec 'yak"", you mean a sit-in rather than a sit-on).

Kayaking,34f0kz,MajorStoney,2,Thu Apr 30 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"That's literally the worst boat you can buy. Don't believe me? Ask yourself why it is also the cheapest. Also I would venture to say that 230# is too heavy for a 10' boat. You're going to feel quite unstable.  Pros:   cheap as fuck  it floats (for a time)   Cons:   everything else   At your height an weight you need to be looking in at least the 12' range. I would suggest looking at emotion, perception, or wilderness systems kayaks (cheapest to most expensive)."
Kayaking,34f0kz,doplebanger,2,Thu Apr 30 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"This. When I bought my first two kayaks, I did 0 research and bought two Pelicans (same boat you listed). They were good beginner boats but I REALLY wish I had done more research before buying two kayaks lol.   They are not very stable, have a reputation for being leaky, and are just not very versatile in general. They are only good for slow moving, calm water, which is fine for some people…but if you want to go on an adventure…I would not trust that boat. They are very tippy and if you take a wave at the wrong angle, bad things can happen. I almost lost one of mine in the same way on a small and calmish lake.  One of my friends clocked in at 250# and when in this boat, the back of the boat was very, very dangerously low in the water and took on lots water with the slightest wave. The seat in his boat decided to rip out. Not a very well built boat.   There is not a lot of room for storing things either. When I first started kayaking, I only took a very small cooler and necessary safety gear like extra lifejacket, air horn, sunscreen, floating dry box, etc. It was very cramped with just these few essentials. The storage hatch on the front is a joke and barley stayed on as well as being too shallow be even be considered storage.    A good thing about this boat: it is somewhat zippy.   The person who said to browse CL is giving great advice. But I will warn you, since it is almost summer, you may not be getting the best deal. The best time to browse kayaks on CL is in the winter/fall months. But if you must have a kayak now, CL is best.   Personally, I do a lot of fishing from my kayaks so I recommend anything Ocean Kayak. They are a little more expensive but if you find a good deal on CL, you are golden! The second boat I ever owned was a Heritage Redfish 10. Again, a fishing boat so not really sure if that fits your need.   Also, a good way to get a feel of all the kayaks on the market: demo days. Marine places that carry kayaks usually have them once a month or so, where you can test out their boats. Find one that was a good fit, and then seek it out on CL!  If you intend to fish from your boat: try area kayak fishing forums! I got my favorite boat (Ocean Kayak Trident Prowler 11) from the texas kayak fishermen forum and it was an amazingly good deal too. Most if not all kayaking forums will have a section devoted to selling your kayaks and related gear. If you don’t plan to fish, still check them out because they will sell their non-fishing kayaks too sometimes.  Good luck and please don’t buy a Pelican like I did and regret it a month later!!"

Kayaking,34a9v4,moosekayak,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know the answer to that question. A quick search turned up this website which says:    Can you make a hovercraft stop and back up?  Yes, although it requires some mechanical wizardry since no part of the craft is in contact with the ground.  Currently, Neoteric Hovercraft, Inc. manufactures the only hovercraft on the market with effective brakes.   What I do know is that I used to work on boats in FL that had an average running speed of 30-35 mph, and while that's slower than many boats can go (for example, many bass boats regularly hit 70+, especially in competition), and unless you can stop on a literal dime, driving at that speeds is very dangerous in foggy situations."
Kayaking,34a9v4,CHIDJM,5,Wed Apr 29 23:01:54 2015 UTC,Use your lights if you have them but I think the hovercraft is at total fault and it's BS to try and blame the kayaker

I think it's pretty representative of a well-rounded educational experience for the first-timer on moving rivers up to class I whitewater (and maybe has a bit on an ""ACA spin"" to it). I'd agree that safety is a big concern and many of my entry-level students appreciate the rescue techniques and drills as much as the paddling skills. Life-jacket wear always tops the list. Moving water adds some hazards to paddling that aren't inherent in calm water. I try to emphasize common (and very real) hazards like strainers and other obstacles.

After everyone has a boat, take them out individually and stand in the water with them, make them flip and exit the kayak safely. Once everyone has done this you can take the new paddlers out and show them some basic strokes so they can maneuver basically.

Bearings. Plotting courses. Tides, currents, dealing with fog. Lots of great information on a basic level. Also good for going back to it for a quick glance if you forget something.   Fearless - Freya Hoffmeister's solo circumnavigation of Australia. Great read, although there is a lot of personal stuff in there as well.

The Alchemy comes into two sizes 14S and 14L, make sure you pick the right size.  I would pick the Dagger, unless you find its storgae space not sufficient."
Kayaking,3479ky,Euh_reddit,2,Tue Apr 28 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the sealution, but I know a lot of people that love the alchemy. It's not the fastest boat out there but I agree that it handles well. I also know of several that use it as an ocean playboat.   Would you get the chance to sit in each and test them before buying them? I think if possible your butt needs to tell you which you like better, and it would be even better if you get the chance to take a test paddle before having to make a decision."
Kayaking,3479ky,KayakHipster,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:51:36 2015 UTC,They're each about 1.5 hours away so I will have the opportunity to sit in at least one but probably won't be able to paddle either. Assuming the Alchemy this would still be much faster than the smaller Walmart/Gander boats that I've paddled though? Sifting through more reviews right now to see if the S would be an OK fit before take a 3hr round trip later this week.
Kayaking,3479ky,Euh_reddit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"(Dagger) I was a little worried about that, about 5'6"" @ ~175lbs, which per the website is an easy fit for the S. Saw a few reviews that said the boat was tight though for someone my size...unfortunately the only one available is a S."
Kayaking,341v69,Myatariisbusted,3,Mon Apr 27 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"Was a gorgeous day for a bit of a drive (Launched from New Jersey side) and a paddle in a new and interesting spot for me. Casual, calm day, more about sightseeing.  Only downside is that the water was a bit grimy/oily. Easy to clean off the boat, but now I feel the need to use a mild powder detergent to ensure I don't injure the drysuit."
Kayaking,341v69,KayakHipster,2,Mon Apr 27 17:30:04 2015 UTC,I've been thinking of making my way down there. Would you recommend it?
Kayaking,341v69,KayakHipster,3,Mon Apr 27 19:19:22 2015 UTC,"It is certainly interesting to paddle around the wrecks (always making sure you are not about to scrape your hull on something submerged). The drive wasn't too bad. The waterway itself was not so interesting aside from the wrecks (there are a few different spots to hit). I did catch one seal sunning on one wreck before he scampered away, and tons of osprey and geese nesting in them.  I'd say it is a nice change of pace trip, Dunno that I need to do it again though. The water seemed decently clean most of the time, but after a tide shift, it was less so. Most of the surrounding shores are oil company land (tanks, fueling stations etc).  I'd not make it a priority, but something to add to shake things up."

Kayaking,341v69,rcn85,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:46:00 2015 UTC,I live in SI and have not idea how to get there. I've had a kayak for 4 years and wanted to paddle out to there but have been unable to find a good launch site. Can you point out where you launched from?
Kayaking,343zcq,KayakHipster,2,Tue Apr 28 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"I was in Charleston for a week of classes, and I have so much footage it's overwhelming. So I started with the shortest class I had. It was a great surf class with Dale Williams.   We don't get big waves near me, so being down in SC in what to me felt like big surf all week was a great experience. Dale wanted to have us in different settings and try to help us develop control no matter the size of the wave.   I'm not an experienced kayak surfer by any means, so this class was excellent. First he took us to some nice swells that were not really breaking. It doesn't seem like it on the video, but they were around 2-3 feet, with occasional 4 footers.   Later we moved on to small crashing waves near the shore, to try to use the same techniques. I've always tried to come down the face of the wave when I tried surfing in the past. Instead, Dale was showing us how to try to stay above it, or to be able to come down the face, then move back up to the top again with our bodies and remain in control.   Another thing he showed us was how much edging controls your movement. You can see as the video progresses that I start getting more comfortable throwing my weight around and being more in control of my position.   If anything, check out my wipeout at the 1:20ish mark, and watch Dale come in to talk to me. He is so smooth, and even when he's in a couple of inches of water, he can still edge and turn like butter. It was awesome to see him do that on the bigger stuff. I wish I had both cameras going that day, but I was running late and only used the one on my stern.   I hope this video helps others that are developing their surfing skills. I have a long way to go.   Cheers!"

I have been working on this for the past month and have not been able to update the site very much but I have finally completed it. This took a lot of code and trial and error to make happen thank god I still had my JavaScript knowledge up to par!  This is basically a listings map that I created that lists businesses and points of interest in North America. It allows you to also add clubs and find different clubs in your area. I put a lot of effort into populating this with real listings from each area and there is also a add listing button.  So please, if you see something that I might've missed near you go ahead and add it to keep the community growing.  Also, please let me know if you have any ideas on how I could make this map better and what features I could add potentially make it more useful.  I don't think there's anything else like it around specific for kayaks. I know there are plenty of maps showing launch points so a directory of businesses and points of interest is very useful for our community in my opinion.  P.S I snuck an advert in there to cover the cost I might get from google developer tools if traffic picks up, love me :P.  Cheers,  Vlad"

Kayaking,33zvlw,moosekayak,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"You need a big nose like that to surf. If you watch surfski, they go nosedown hard, just due to how the waves and boat interact - having extra volume up front helps reduce that dive, which helps with handling. In my K1 I've tried to ride some big waves/wake and you can get ""stuck"" on a wave with your bow buried in the trough/next wave and you're pretty vulnerable there, although obviously, a k1 has much less bow volume.   Also having a rudder means that the additional up top wind profile matters less.  It is interesting that its 18' ft long though, since a usual ski is 22', so I don't think its necessarily an efficiency thing."
Kayaking,33zvlw,doplebanger,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:05:02 2015 UTC,I think my kayak probably has the lowest volume bow in the game and I've surfed pretty steep waves. I admit I don't know much about surf ski hill design but I don't know if these ultra touring boats are designed this way just to combat surf. If that was the case then I'd say it's overkill.

I personally love the idea of such an app! One of my favorite parts of kayaking is the ability to get off the beaten path and ""get lost""... even in my own town. I'm always more than happy to share ""my"" launch sites with anyone looking for the same- and am always looking for local incite when traveling. An easily accessible, go to guide for some local wisdom sounds phenomenal!  Thanks for the heads up on the app and I'm sure it's just a matter of getting the word out about the app itself (as you're doing now, obviously)... or maybe the great members of this sub have an idea of a similar site/app that already has a good sized following?? Either way, thank you for sharing! I'll definitely add a few of my favorite landings/launches from each spot I've been fortunate enough to call home and hopefully it will continue to build!  Happy paddling!"

That's extremely disheartening... it's one thing to mention it (""hey! looks like fun! btw, don't forget safe practice..."" or anything of the sort) as in a genuine concern for fun and safety; but from the looks of (almost) every comment, I'd think he was on lvl 5 rapids or teaching him how to roll... you guys don't know outside the frame (someone is taking the picture) or circumstance: nor was he asking for critique. He's sharing his enjoyment with his child on a forum with others who enjoy paddling, don't agree then just don't comment... either share in the fun or move on... the attacks (seriously, 7-8 posts in a row about the pfd?!) are completely unnecessary...   I'm not on the side of slaying OP here in any way, he seems to be out having a great time with his boy and honestly brings happiness to my night to see... Keep on gettin him out there with ya brother, paddling will be as second nature as walking for him!

I love the idea of passing along my love for the water and nature/outdoors to them with great memories of a lifetime!

Kayaking,33ywze,mkalil,5,Sun Apr 26 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a dirty whitewater heathen, predominantly, so my technique is likely substantially different from a sea kayaker's, but even I get a lot of ab and even a bit of back into paddling. You should learn about other types of paddle strokes, most notably a J stroke to help you control the boat.  One last thing, which I don't know if it matters in a sea kayak, is edging and body weight movement. I know y'all don't have edges the way we do, but you might still be able to get a bit of control from edging the boat, which is a technique where you roll the kayak slightly onto its side with your hips."
Kayaking,33ywze,disingenuous_dickwee,3,Mon Apr 27 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"Edging works well with mine. I use it to fine tune a line if need be, mostly when paddling in a cross or quartering wind."
Kayaking,33ywze,NedTaggart,2,Mon Apr 27 01:02:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Edging is essential to paddling in wind and in changing currents.
Kayaking,33ywze,KayakHipster,2,Mon Apr 27 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"Good to know. We mostly edge to handle current, but it behaves similarly, if you get a decent edge going you can paddle in circles even if you're just paddling on the inside. Or if you get the edge right and plant a stern rudder at the right angle, you can ferry across a river without paddling once in the current."
Kayaking,33ywze,disingenuous_dickwee,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. We were doing just that last week, practicing ferrying across current but we were using bow rudders."
Kayaking,33ywze,KayakHipster,3,Mon Apr 27 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"Edging in sea kayaks is the key to good boat control, I would guess just like in WW. For us, we have 15-18 feet of boat, depending on the kind it'll have a long water line. In mine, around 17 ft, I would guess my waterline is somewhere around 15ish ft. When I put it on a hard edge, I can take that waterline to somewhere around 10 feet. It's a lot easier to turn a 10 ft boat than it is a 15 footer.    We also use edging for course correction and turning. Essentially, edging unlocks the stern which keeps a sea kayak in a straight line. With a good edge, one can simply continue paddling forward and edging alone can turn the boat."
Kayaking,33ywze,KayakHipster,3,Mon Apr 27 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you're pulling the paddle towards you and in the process, torquing your abs, you're doing it wrong. If you're pulling the paddle toward your waist and torquing your abs, you ware going to make the boat waddle back and forth. You should be keeping your elbows at a constant angle (they should not be opening and closing, as you wrench the paddle towards you wildly). If you keep your elbows constant there's no way to paddle unless you rotate your shoulders and core. this is the correct way to paddle over long distances."
Kayaking,33ywze,doplebanger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Roger that. Also great name
Kayaking,33ywze,NedTaggart,2,Mon Apr 27 01:52:36 2015 UTC,"You probably are't bracing your feet properly. Also, it's not really just your abs, it's your entire core from your hips, up.  I don't really pull the blade through the water with my low arm, I guide it, using it as a fulcrum. Most of the power comes from pushing with my high arm and twisting from the hip, with my feet and thighs well braced.  There's another redditor that has a great website for working on the perfect stroke. His info helped me a LOT, and still does. Check out his series of posts on it - http://www.paddlingotaku.com/2010/03/beginnings_16.html?m=1"
Kayaking,33ywze,NedTaggart,2,Mon Apr 27 00:33:51 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, so your arms are somewhat locked in place"
Kayaking,33ywze,KayakHipster,4,Mon Apr 27 00:48:13 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. Imagine you have to hold a box between your chest and paddle, and keep it in place while you make your strokes.   You also want to make sure you are holding the paddle properly. If you hold it above your head, both elbows should be at right angles.   The stroke should be to twist and put the blade in the water around where your ankle is, then push (add power) with your upper arm while guiding it back (very little to no power) with your lower arm. When the blade is about even with your hip, the upper blade will be ready to drop into the water on the other side where your ankle is, repeat on the other side.   The arms stay mostly in a 90degree position. Hold the paddle lightly (I push with an open palm) and use your whole body...legs, hips and shoulders when you push."
Kayaking,33ywze,NedTaggart,2,Mon Apr 27 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here. I would add that I also focus on my legs/feet pushing on my footpegs, one at a time as I take my stroke. Some instructors have told me they like to see students' butts actually rotating slightly in the seat as they rotate their bodies."

Kayaking,33qy1d,snrpsnp,2,Fri Apr 24 19:57:44 2015 UTC,I've been looking at a 10 foot recreational kayak. How will it handle the ocean with less than 10mph winds? Any suggestions on a good all around kayak that would be good in both a river and the open lake/bay/sea?
Kayaking,33qy1d,GSXRjim,6,Fri Apr 24 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"I would not consider taking anything less than a 14' touring or day touring kayak* out on the open ocean (and longer would be even better). A 10' rec boat is slow and inefficient and will not track well. With currents, waves, and wind, you'd have to work extra hard to get where you're going. Cthulhu help you if conditions suddenly deteriorate and you have to scramble to shore.  *I assume we're taking about a cockpit-style boat. Sit-on-tops are a bit different."
Kayaking,33qy1d,52Hz_Whale,3,Fri Apr 24 22:12:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed here. For ocean, sit in needs to be at least 14'. Not only length, but they need to have two airtight hatches in case of a capsize.   Sit on tops have different requirements for sea worthiness. I'll let others that know about sit on tops chime in on that."
Kayaking,33qy1d,KayakHipster,2,Fri Apr 24 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"Great response, this is exactly what I was trying to figure out. So there is a stability/safety component to a sea kayak that makes it worth the extra money. I'm assuming that a sea kayak would perform fine a lake/fishing use?"
Kayaking,33qy1d,Dreistul,2,Sat Apr 25 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"I would agree with 52Hz that a 14' touring style (with front and rear hatches)  would be the absolute minimum that I would consider safe on open water, and with that, only under light wind conditions (maybe under 10mph?).  I have a 14' Tsunami. I love it for large pond/small lake and for decent sized, smooth rivers. I've used it in the Great Lakes in 10-15mph winds and thats about the max I felt comfortable with."
Kayaking,33qy1d,doplebanger,5,Fri Apr 24 23:32:56 2015 UTC,"A 10' boat won't be able to work against wind or current. You'll be at the mercy of the water.  Also the thing that makes sea kayaks safer than rec boats is that they have fore and aft bulkheads, this keeps them from sinking when you flip them over."
Kayaking,33qy1d,maddrops,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The details about bulkheads, etc. is what I need to know."
Kayaking,33qy1d,maddrops,2,Sat Apr 25 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"I think a sit-on-top might be a good solution for you. They are very stable and safe, even on ocean waters, and great for going relatively short distances. The downsides are the extra windage and exposure to the elements, and the inherently slow hull shape. Also, if you're considering buying a new kayak, it might be wise to spend the same amount of money on a used boat to get something better."
Kayaking,33qy1d,mkalil,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:29:39 2015 UTC,Good idea. What are the things to look for in a sea-safe sit on top kayak? What factors would make it safe to take in ocean waters?
Kayaking,33qy1d,KayakHipster,2,Sun Apr 26 00:49:34 2015 UTC,"Most sit on tops are appropriate for ocean use, since they tend to be self-bailing and have great initial stability, and are molded to track well (have a long keel). They are also easier to get back into after a capsize. Short boats will still be slow though. They are also most appropriate for warm-weather use, here in New England I really only use mine during the summer, and use my sit-inside boats the rest of the year. I use an Emotion Tandemonium for getting to and from sailboats in all sorts of conditions, either solo or with one or two other people. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you will be solo most of the time though, as it's quite large and heavy. Something like this might be more appropriate for your needs, just as an example."
Kayaking,33qy1d,bubabudan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:37:37 2015 UTC,"This is super helpful! I will probably be alone most of the time and I'm a pretty small person, so I'm really for the smallest/lightest kayak that would be safe to take on calm ocean waters like bays and estuaries. A full length sea kayak is both out of my price range (even used) and too large for me to reasonable handle by myself."

If you have somewhere safe, and people to help, try going in and getting back in your kayak in the kind of water temperatures you will be paddling in. You will be shocked how quickly it becomes impossible to get yourself in without help in cold water.  Related to the above two, practice rescues. Don't assume you won't need them, or that you will manage it on the day.

Kayaking,33ljih,CroMoGo,3,Thu Apr 23 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"First I came down the river Vilnele, and it was intense (for a novice). The strong current pushed me under a fallen tree, and my kayak filled with water in seconds. I was fully-clothed up to my waist, dragging it out. This happened twice!!   Sopping wet I persevered against the current up the river Neris. Wow, it was harder than I had imagined, but the chance of me falling in had gone down to 0%. Ngghhh ugghhh gnnnnnnh every inch of the way, I got 20 km up the river in two afternoons and camped out like a badass. Fire, food, music, beer, then sleep, sweet rest.   Today I came back downriver, but what's this? a stupidly strong headwind? I had to paddle hard all the way back in choppy waters. It was like being on the sea, breakers smashing the bow!   Awesome trip, my shoulders and hands ache like hell and I have blisters on my thumbs. I am not planning on going again immediately!   Thanks to /r/kayaking just for being all about kayaks. Much obliged."
Kayaking,33ljih,KayakHipster,3,Thu Apr 23 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a fun trip - I just want to find out about safety measures. Sounds like you went alone. Did you take ways to communicate in case the boat got swamped and you couldn't get it out?  Also, how were you dressed? What was the water temp?"
Kayaking,33ljih,KayakHipster,2,Thu Apr 23 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"I had a mobile phone all wrapped up in a roll-top bag. Also for the first part I was wearing a lifejacket. The water temp was bearable, no risk of hypothermia, though by evening I was really cold and had to have a big fire.   I learned that you have to keep really sharp eyes on the river ahead (when it is fast and rocky) because it will pull you where you don't want to go (into a fallen tree) and then it is too easy to capsize. I wouldn't want little kids doing it.   Yeah safety is important. I didn't use a helmet, and I don't think I needed to (it wasn't exactly white water!).   I had hiking trousers on and a jacket made by decathlon for boating (I bought it for cycle-touring last year) ""triboard"" is the brand. I also had waterproof trousers made by them (because cycling).   Fortunately the river Vilnele goes through some populous areas, so as long as I didn't drown, I could climb out and find people soon enough!"
Kayaking,33ljih,nittanyvalley,3,Thu Apr 23 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"Ok good. I'll let other river runners here chime in, on my end I care that people have a pfd ON, which it sounds like you did. A way to communicate with others in case of an emergency (ON you, if it's in the boat and it gets trapped, or for coastal kayaking the danger is it blowing away from you, then it does you no good). And dressed for immersion. No cotton, etc, and knowing that you can be in the water for a long period of time without worrying about getting cold.   I would just add, always take a drybag with a change of dry clothes so the moment you get soaked, you can change into warm stuff to keep going. Since you were camping I'm guessing you might have had other clothes to warm up with."
Kayaking,33m2i0,up9rade,4,Thu Apr 23 16:59:09 2015 UTC,I'm a sprint kayaker on the Canadian U23 National Team and one of the most important weight training exercises we do is called bench pull. Not a commonly known exercise in a normal gym environment but a very good workout for paddling as it focuses on a lot of back strength and pulling power in the position you will generally be paddling in. Not a whole lot of content out there about bench pull but this Youtube video seems to get the point across well enough if you're interested.

It looks like a pretty good beginner kayak. judging by the weight and how it was made it will probably be durable. That kayak is probably not going to be good for big lakes, It's not going to cover a lot of open water well. For smaller lakes and calm rivers it would be a pretty good kayak.

Kayaking,33jbel,Szzo,3,Wed Apr 22 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a shop that sold Prijon boats. They were the core of our rental fleet, and we had some that had seen years of abuse and held up really well. I think they have some of the most durable plastic on the market, though I haven't seen too many high-end plastic boats in person. They are notorious for being incredibly durable, even if they haven't been particularly well cared-for. Their Seayak is a classic boat, and I would have no qualms buying one that was over 10 years old if it the price was right.  The Capri is also the only recreational kayak I would wholeheartedly recommend. I haven't paddled a Pelican, but have paddled a number of boats like the Pungo, etc. The Capri outshines them all. It actually tracks decently and responds to edging. It's a great kayak that will allow a paddler to learn some real paddling skills. As someone who fell in love with sea kayaks, I actually enjoyed paddling the Capri quite a lot. And I think $240 is a damn good price.  Edit to add: Let me know if you have any more questions about the boat or the brand!"

I found this out the hard way when I took a girl out kayaking and one of the scupper holes (sot)  had seperated where it bonds together.  20 minutes in she was sinking.

I bet he was even wearing cotton.   It's not actually a miracle. Hypothermia is very survivable as long as you take appropriate steps. In this case, the guy had enough sense to conserve warmth as well as he could and get to shore as quickly as possible, and the bystanders had the sense to rid him of the deathcloth. He's lucky that he wasn't further out when it happened, but that's hardly a miracle.   There's a sad irony to proper safety gear: because it's expensive, specialized, and seen as inconvenient, beginners and casual paddlers usually decide that it's not worth it (or don't even know about it at all). Advanced paddlers are usually less dependent on that gear because advanced techniques and skills make it less likely to be used; if you have a properly skirted boat and a good roll, you're much less likely to swim in any condition. The only times I've ever swam from my touring boat were under controlled circumstances in warm water while practicing my roll.

However, rudders are bad, and a legs are good. So they fucked up there. Again, don't believe me? Wait till your rudder inevitably stops working.  All considered I would go for it.

Based on my past trips, I'm going to say upwards of 80% of my trips will be lakes and rivers. I have to imagine a 17 foot boat will be unwieldy in the small rivers and lakes around New England no? Then how the hell does my 5' 7"" tall midget body portage the damn thing?"
Kayaking,33ftck,doplebanger,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"That's true that 17' is a bit of overkill, and the tempest 165 (16.5') is a more more nimble and smaller boat. It would be ideal for your situation geographically. However being 230# and 5'7"" is just not ideal, you will either have a boat that is right for your weight but awkward for your length, or vis versa.  A 15' or 16' boat is a good, even ideal for your waterways, but it will feel awkward under your weight. The reason your 12' boat feels fine is because it's like 4"" wider than the sea kayaks we are discussing."
Kayaking,33ftck,Eloth,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"If you think you will need to portage, go for a 14' boat and/or get a cart like the trailtreker (paddlelogic).  Portaging a kayak is a pain. You would think that it would be easier compared to a canoe (at least I did), but in fact it's not: there is no convenient way to carry it on your shoulders, it takes much longer to pack/unpack"
Kayaking,33ftck,Euh_reddit,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:53:33 2015 UTC,there is no convenient way to carry it on your shoulders   Huh? Just shove it on one shoulder and go. There's not a lot to it.

(assuming you dont pack/unpack, which takes forever since you will normally optimize the space and weight distribution)  Added to the fact that: - Weight is almost never equally distributed between the back and front  - The weird shape of a Kayak makes it uncomfortable to carry on the shoulder...even if two people are carrying a boat at both ends.  The cart is a good solution, provided that the trails are not too rough and that you have enough space left in your boat to carry it."

Kayaking,33fx1z,Lythe,9,Wed Apr 22 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"Your kayak is not designed to go out on the open sea. Any wind at all will cause it to be pushed around and, more-than-likely, capsized. A splash skirt will not make you safe at all.   Even if it is a calm day do not risk going out, the weather on the sea can change very quickly."

There's no way you'd be able to cover that many miles in a day in a rec boat.   Please use your boat in places and trips that it can handle. Your kayak was designed for calm waters.  Paddle safe and enjoy!"

What would you recommend for  first sea worthy kayak?  We started out doing the Tickfaw river, Blood river, Amite etc. and then Took them from the Tickfaw to Lake Maurepas then to Lake Pontchartrain, so we thought the would be enough for the ocean since they did so well.  Reading through the comments up until yours really gave a bad taste about this subreddit."
Kayaking,33fx1z,doplebanger,5,Wed Apr 22 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"Read this, it's more than just your boat type. There are necessary skills you need to possess before attempting an open water crossing (self rescue, bracing/rolling, navigating, etc.). Then there is the gear: flotation, spare paddle, bailer, skirt, nav equipment, nautical charts, rudder, etc.  http://www.paddling.net/sameboat/archives/sameboat214.html  I'm being harsh because I want you to know the seriousness of this crossing, especially with your current gear and skill set. I come across too many recreational kayakers (many of them paddling pelicans) who think they know better and aren't looking for this answer. Even you post lacked the simple question of ""is this trip a good idea?"".  Going looking for a victim, or worse a body, in the water sucks and it's something I hope to never have to do again."
Kayaking,33fx1z,slackshack,2,Wed Apr 22 13:27:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info and I will def give that a read.

This post makes it pretty clear that you have never visited this subreddit or taken any time to browse the posts. Safety is stressed so hard here (and pretty much everywhere in the kayaking world) because we're tired of people dying because they didn't take the sport seriously. Safety posts literally make up half of the content here. So this post, a combination of the boat we tell people not to buy (really) and the thing we tell people not to do (go out in the ocean without a clue) it can be very frustrating."
Kayaking,33fx1z,Eloth,2,Wed Apr 22 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"You probably came in after some good advice was actually given.  When I posted about bad taste and jackasses, the only comments were wear a go pro so we can watch you drown.  And don't do it you are stupid but no information as to why.  Clearly I am worried about safety, hence the post.  As I said, we are planning, not that I was going this morning and hopping on the ocean.  I came for information on how to do it safely, is my gear enough etc.  Post just saying don't do it with no further info, or go drown are jackass comments.  I also did look at other posts before posting, but found no mention of my kayak and as I did do lakes and rivers with it wondered if it was enough.  Thankfully KayakHipster and nittanyvalley came with good advice and I do hope they can help a bit further with different kayak models that would be in my price range and tips and tricks to get us up to speed.  Comments that only criticize with no further helpful info are kinda pointless when someone is new and learning."
Kayaking,33fx1z,KayakHipster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fine, take several fucking courses, learn to roll in shit conditions and practice until it is a muscle memory , practice rescues until same, lead to read the ocean, weather and tide tables, learn to surf your boat, never do a crossing with less than three people all as well as  or better trained than yourself, don't paddle a boat that isnt seaworthy, anytime you paddle off shore father than you can swim back you better have your shit together.  Eleven plus years of paddling the Pacific Northwest here, rescued paddlers, been rescued, don't fuck around with the ocean, don't be unprepared, it can go from fun to shitty so fast you won't know wtf happened until it's too late."
Kayaking,33fx1z,KeithO,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the way everyone jumped on you, but give them the benefit of the doubt - look back through recent posts and you'll see why. We've now had many accounts just this spring of kayaking deaths due to dressing incorrectly or using kayaks that are not designed for rougher waters. It's a big problem we face every year when the air temperatures rise but water temperatures lag way behind. And the last couple of years, more and more stores carry rec kayaks that are great for calm waters, but people get a false sense of security from them and venture to rougher waters - but the boats are simply not designed for them.   Absolutely, we can help steer you towards a boat that can work for you. Tell us your height, weight, and ultimately the types of places you think you'll be paddling. Overnight/Weekend camping? Week long trips? Etc.   Lastly, a bit of info on why you felt your kayak performed so well: the way the kayak is designed will affect how it handles on the water. For a recreational kayak, it is flat and wide. This means it'll feel extremely stable to paddlers (especially beginners). Narrower sea kayaks will feel more ""tippy"", you'll feel like you might go in the water at anytime when you're starting out, but this is advantageous. When waves roll by, a narrower kayak will allow the wave to simply go by, because the hull allows it to do so. With a wide, stable kayak, it'll try to go up the face of the wave (keeping stable and perpendicular to the water surface) and ultimately you'll get capsized.   These elements are called primary and secondary stability. So, although your kayak felt stable in the areas you were paddling, as soon as bigger waves come by, there's a very likely chance of you going in the water.   One more point to make. Sea kayaks will also have airtight hatches. These not only allow paddlers to take equipment, but work as airtight buoyancy in case of a capsize. Just this past week, I capsized while playing in surf. It was too dangerous to have someone perform a full rescue in the waves, so I was able to get back into my completely swamped boat, and paddle to a calmer place to then empty out my boat, get back in and secure my skirt again. Even with all that water in my boat, there was no way it would sink. Recreational kayaks are not designed this way. If it gets swamped, down it goes.   Anyway, give us your info and we'll try to give you some suggestions of boats you can look into. Also, used ones are just fine, we can give you ballpark numbers on prices for used boats as well."
Kayaking,33fx1z,dirtyPirate,0,Wed Apr 22 13:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the info so far.  It was also a bit my fault for not giving you guys a bit more info as well.  We don't plan on doing the trip till at least early to mid July as we wanted the water to be warmer.  But we will hold off longer now till we get the right kayaks and a bit more skill under our belts.  I'm 5'8 and weigh about 155 to 160 lbs and he is is 5'11 and prob 150 to 155.  Right now we do 3 to 6 day trips camping down the rivers and it's been really fun so we def wanna learn and try out the ocean.  For price range we could spend no more than 500 each on new/used kayaks.  We do have lifejackets, gps(2 each for backups), compass, lights,flares and a few other things.  I do not have a bilge pump but I will get one before the trip as well.  I did learn the kayak roll while in the lakes.  And I guess I did let the calmer lake and river waters lull me into a false since of security in the kayak.  Any other info you may need I'll be more than happy to share as I do wanna make the trip safe.  That's why I'm hear and asking. :D  I can also understand where everyone else is coming from, but to be honest the way they shared there thoughts could be dangerous in and of itself.  A new person such as me asking and then getting those negative replies with no real info behind them will def make ya go well screw these assholes and move on and could possibly get them killed.  It's def not their faults by any means.  But it should be something everything thinks of before replying to something.  Is my reply giving info or am I just being a jerk, ya know?"
Kayaking,33fx1z,caffiend98,2,Wed Apr 22 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"I did learn the kayak roll while in the lakes.   Problem is, it's one thing being able to roll -- and quite another being able to roll when you aren't expecting it, in cold water, when you haven't had the chance to take a breath before you go under... It's probably going to be impossible, if not difficult to roll a rec boat like that.  Otherwise, what /u/kayakhipster's saying is great advice."

I'll think of some boats that might work, and also ask - are there any kayaking clubs nearby? Where are you located? It might be beneficial to see if there's any paddles or meetup groups near you doing day paddles - that way you can meet folks that have the equipment mentioned and you can get a first hand account on everything needed. Also, paddlers are often willing to let you try their boats (I always do) and to offer advice.   Same goes for classes near you. Instructors are not only great sources of info and skill, but of equipment. As I started getting my gear together, my instructors were always selling used equipment for super cheap, since they go through it quickly.   Look on the ACA website www.americancanoe.org for classes and instructors near you."

Kayaking,33egvs,Eloth,2,Wed Apr 22 04:44:25 2015 UTC,"Strength:  Chin ups. A chin up for a paddler is done with a paddler's grip, hands over the bar. Do them constantly.  The classic paddler exercises of bench row (low/pulley/bent over are okay), one arm pull and bench press and something for your legs (squats).   Endurance:   Do all the chin ups. Any horizontal bar is a chin up bar. It's too late for ski season, so maybe go for a few runs? The problem is that you don't want max aero power, you want sub-aerobic-cap, ability to keep paddling forever, which is really hard to get outside of the boat. Most important thing will be time in the boat when you have the chance, just go for as long as you can."
Kayaking,33egvs,moosekayak,3,Wed Apr 22 04:45:27 2015 UTC,Chin ups. A chin up   You mean pull-ups (which is what you're describing).  Otherwise the most important strength is core.

Kayaking,338fsw,Guillemot,8,Mon Apr 20 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"With the weather getting warm in the north it is a great time to get out on the water. But, in many places the water is only a few weeks beyond being frozen and is still very cold.  Very few people intend to capsize while kayaking, but it happens anyway. If you should fall in the water by accident you have about a minute where you will be trying to deal with the shock of the cold when you will have to try to gain control over your breathing. Many people don't survive the first minute. After that you need to get your body out of the water within about 10 minutes before you are too weak to take care of yourself. If you don't get out of the water, most people will last about an hour before succumbing to hypothermia.  Your best bet for surviving the 1st minute is to wear your life jacket. Have it zipped up tight. Even if you breath in water due to the shock, you will come to the surface and survive. Since the PFD will help you float you will not have to work as hard for the next 10 minutes just to stay up and can concentrate on getting out of the water.  If you don't succeed in getting out of the water, the life jacket provides the best chance that you will still be alive for the next hour or so in the hopes of a rescue.  To add to the safety of a life jacket you should dress for immersion. This means don't wear cotton clothes. Wear polypro, fleece etc. Wear a wet suit or even better a dry suit.  Several paddlers have already died this year in cold water. Don't be the next. Be smart, be safe."
Kayaking,338fsw,nittanyvalley,4,Mon Apr 20 14:16:08 2015 UTC,This needs to be hammered in. I wish everyone could experience an immersion event in cold water under controlled conditions just to see how overwhelming and exhausting it can be.

Kayaking,338fsw,mrodgers83,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hammer away.  I've been reading kayak info now for over a year.  Maybe finally picking up my first kayak this afternoon.  I've been reading about cold weather on these sites.  I saw the demonstration video last spring and was impressed by the info presented.    Thus, I'll pick up the kayak today but probably won't be in it until next month until I get to maiden it.  The fishing report site I am checking is saying water temp is around 54° right now.  I don't have any gear to wear.  Maybe next year after I've gained some experience."
Kayaking,338fsw,nittanyvalley,2,Tue Apr 21 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"This is a good attitude to have. But, I don't want you to not get on the water at all. You can pick up wet suits for fairly cheap <$80. That is a good start, and it will extend your season by many months.  See if you have a local club near you that you can get out with to get you some experience. I honestly didn't realize how little I knew about paddling until I started hanging out with the whitewater kayaking crowd. Those are the guys that know their stuff, because they are out paddling all year round on some of the most difficult creeks and rivers. They can help you with gear, technique, paddling skills, navigating moving water, reading water, safety, swiftwater rescue, etc."

Kayaking,338o5v,Myatariisbusted,3,Mon Apr 20 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"Founding member, Trip leader, and Instructor with North Brooklyn Boat Club here.   1. No, the view is amazing from the water. 2. The current is manageable all along the LIC shore, but the best spot I think is just north of the mouth of Newtown Creek  and south of LIC East River ferry stop. There is a little embayment left from some old train gantries. 3. The closest public launch is Manhattan Street end. One could also put in at Hallets Cove (if the currents timed right) 4. We have tested the water weekly for 3 yrs now and can tell you that from the boatyard to the mouth of the creek the water quality is very similar if not identical to the East River's (which meets EPA swimming standards most of the time.) It is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Gowanus thanks to the strong tidal flushing we get. (less true as you get further up creek - which is nearly 4 miles long)   FYI - NBBC almost always has trips for members on Manhattanhenge. Membership is still just $40/season (and allows you to sign up for all our trips and education programs - nearly all of which are free, or very low cost). All equipment is provided as well as trained trip leaders who know the currents, commercial ship traffic and other safety issues to guide the trips - so you can focus on enjoying yourself and learn as you go."

Kayaking,338kgy,mkalil,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"to be honest, any neoprene deck meant for sea kayaking (or neo/nylon hybrid) should do you fine, or any simple whitewater one.

Then thought it might be worthwhile to get a cheap 12 footer as opposed to a cheap 10 footer.  Been eyeing the Conduit 13 foot at Dick's but I can't swing the $600 this year.  Craigslist is few and far between with either cheap/inexpensive boats for more than new or really good deals on really expensive boats.  Luck may be on my side I hope.

Kayaking,336o90,lolodotkoli,3,Mon Apr 20 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"I have a 2007 Camry. Your best bet is Thule aftermarket racks. (Or Yakima. I have Yakima, but wish I had gotten Thule). They seem expensive, but they are worth it. All other options and you risk damaging/denting your roof, and it is expensive to fix.  If you go to their website, you can find the parts you need, and sometimes find some of them for cheap on Craigslist. The part that you will most likely have to order is the foot kit, which is car/model specific.  Also, you would need a separate mounting system for each of your cars. I don't think they use the same mount setup."
Kayaking,336o90,nittanyvalley,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:40:16 2015 UTC,I'd have to agree.  Look on Craigslist and you should be able to find some good deals on the crossbars and towers.  I was able to get my Thule setup for less than half of retail cost.  The only thing I had to buy from a store was the car-specific fit-kit.
Kayaking,336o90,CEND-Nick,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"I had a 1995 camry for almost a decade. It was convenient to throw some Styrofoam on top and put the kayaks on. I also didn't car much about the car so dents and scratches covered the top. Water from the return trip rusted some spots that had been scratched more and more over time. Then the straps, which I had to strap around and inside the car, vibrated wildly causing damage to the paint as well. Because of all this I immediately bought some Thule bars for much jeep afterwards. When they are secured correctly to the door frames they can hold much more than the two kayaks and you would only need them on one car. Also, spend the extra $100 to buy some J-stands that will hold two kayaks. It's worth the hassel."
