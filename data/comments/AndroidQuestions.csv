AndroidQuestions,3e4hdl,Avengerr,4,Tue Jul 21 21:58:18 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 5 is a great phone despite its age and it is still widely used by the Android fans. It is still sufficiently fast for day to day usage and, in my opinion, it is the best looking Nexus up to date. The bad thing about it is its camera. I'm by no means an expert but I know its in the low-end category. I, myself am looking for an upgrade to a newer Nexus phone and I think that the best thing to do right now is to wait for the next generation Nexus 5 coming out Q4 this year as it should be super fast and affordable. Also, none of the problems you have described should be an issue with the Nexus 5. Its internal memory is vast."

AndroidQuestions,3e4hdl,viperfan7,3,Wed Jul 22 00:06:40 2015 UTC,Battery life is atrocious. I get like 2-2.5 hrs screen on time. Stay close to a wall or get an external battery. Other than that I have very few complaints.
AndroidQuestions,3e4hdl,bit2much,2,Tue Jul 21 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, I was in that situation like a year ago with a Wildfire S. Let me tell you first off that the Nexus 5 will solve ALL of those problems. No more fucking around with installing apps at all. It's a dream.  The issues I have pertain to specific google apps. For example, I'm in Canada and some street names are in French, others in English, and Google Maps just uses one language setting for speech output (Which is not even what you set it up as in Settings>Text to speech output, it's the System wide language that is used - absolutely stupid). Another example is Google Keyboard, typing quickly on it sometimes has it ""freeze up"" but still record all touch inputs, and then it jerks forward and writes down all you pressed at once. Pretty weird.    But overall it's damn great, high and above that shitty memory management before no doubt. I'd recommend it if it wasn't for the rumors that new Nexus phone(s) are coming out in a couple of months.    I guess what it comes down to is how fed up you are with it, if you need a change right now the Nexus 5 is not a bad choice at all.  Other cheap mentions: 1+1, Asus Zenfone 2. Check them out."
AndroidQuestions,3e4hdl,Mistywing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"I love my Nexus 5 even 2 years after buying it. People complain about the camera, but honestly I find it takes better photos than many newer flagship phones.  My biggest grievances are the battery life (I'm lucky to get 2-3 hours of SoT), and my GPS accuracy is very fucking erratic; my phone will randomly decide it doesn't know where I am 3 or 4 times while navigating to somewhere."

AndroidQuestions,3e4hdl,austinrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"You could always opt to install a custom rom, then flash a gapps file with less included apps if you're worried about storage. Case manufacturers also make cases for the Nexus 5 that give an additional battery as well as a microSD card slot. You could also use an OTG cable and connect a flash drive for added removable storage. The device has amazing specs for its value, but in this day and age, you're better off getting a Oneplus One or any other budget device, might i suggest taking a look at this?  The N5 also gets a lot of software suppport from custom ROMS and google themselves because it's a nexus device. Or you could wait until the Nexus 5 2015 or nexus 6 2015 phones come out. LG is making the N5 2015 and Huawei is making the N6 2015."

AndroidQuestions,3e475i,zires,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"straight from their FAQ page:  ""To use our network, you will need an unlocked GSM phone that supports one or more of the following frequencies:  1700/2100 MHz (3G / 4G or LTE depending on location) 1900 MHz (2G or 3G / 4G depending on location) 850 MHz (2G) For the best experience, you should get a phone that supports the 1700/2100 MHz frequency. This will ensure that you get the fastest possible data speeds on our nationwide network.  If your phone supports 1900 MHz, then you can get 3G/4G data speeds in some parts of the country, but it will not be nationwide.  If you only need voice, text, and our slowest data speed, then you can use a device that supports 850MHz but none of the other frequencies listed above.  Most US phones are sold as tri-band or quad-band phones that got one or more of the frequencies above.""  So make sure your phone supports these frequencies and it will work. You can Google the bands/frequencies a phone supports pretty easily."

Had every s device from the first one and never wanted to stray, but I was so unimpressed with the s6 that I jumped ship.   For the g4, I love the size. I have huge hands so it fits my usage well. The camera (both front and back) are amazing, it's fast, the display is gorgeous, and the sd slot was a must for me.  My only gripe is the battery life. Its terrible. I got the phone on launch day so I got the free second battery with charging cradle, and thank god I did. On a day with normal to heavy usage, taking it off the charger at 8am, I need the second battery by 3 or 4 at best (that's fully dead). I'm sure there's some apps I can turn off to help this, but I like the way it runs out of the box, so I deal with it.  All that said, yes 100% to the g4."

AndroidQuestions,3e3bvy,Gooflactus,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:35 2015 UTC,Yea but it usually requires a Nandroid backup which requires a custom recovery. There are apps that can backup the apps and their data without root but you will still start with a blank device. Even then you will have to set it up somewhat while a Nandroid would be a full exact restore.
AndroidQuestions,3e3bvy,DarkStarrFOFF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"If you have it enabled, your settings should automatically be backed up to Google anyway. Contacts should be saved on your account too if you chose to do that.  Message and call logs, as well as a bunch of app data, can be backed up using Helium, on the Play Store. It is free and does not require a rooted device. (Backups are stored in the /carbon folder on the internal storage or SD card, not sure which but shouldn't be hard to find.)  Photos can be backed up to Google if you enable it. You should be able to copy the rest of your data to your computer via USB.  When I factory reset (for unlocking the bootloader) my Nexus 5, everything was backed up and restored when I logged into Google.  Absolute final option would be a Nandroid backup, but this requires an unlocked bootloader and root, AND a custom recovery, which will void your warranty... So don't do it."
