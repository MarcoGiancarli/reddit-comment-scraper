They look so much like they couldn't be more honest in their love, boundless in their affection, or confident in their care... they look at you like you're their only thing in the world.  They're lying though.  You're NOTHING.  You're a miserable POINTLESS waste of flesh and space.  Your dog feels sorry for you.  Your dog hates you and wishes that you'd die so that they could be free of the burden of having to look at you every day.  Your dog loves you more than anybody else ever can or will, and they still LOATHE you. That, that absolute, foul-smelling, pitch black, blood-stained loathing is the BEST emotion that anybody has about you.  Because you are a horrible monster. A freak. And you know it. And so does everybody else.  So you climb a building just to show them what an angry, foul, horrific freak that you are. You smash all the cars and people that you meet on your way there and you grab some horribly beautiful bottle-blond on your way to the top, punching and pissing in windows on your way up. And, at the top, you wave her around in one hand, smashing biplanes with the other and giving the finger to the camera with both, and finally, before the nuclear strike is called in against you, you eat that pathetic fucking woman alive. You will never forget her screams as your massive teeth rend her flesh... NEVER!!  And in the crater that is left in the wake of the bomb... you feel the life draining out of you... and standing just at the edge of your field of view... you see it... it's the last thing that you'll ever see...  You see THIS. And you realize, that it was always, always, ALWAYS laughing at you, and waiting for just this moment.

They gave her up to the animal shelter in this condition, and it was decided amputation was the way to go for the best quality of life for her.   She can't actually seem to swim, but she enjoys wading around and sticking her snout under the water as long as she can touch the bottom with the other three legs still :)"

It came back as dogs that he absolutely could not be;I can't remember what but it was breeds that he had no similarities to in either personality or appearance.  Australian shepherd (or any shepherd breed) wasn't even mentioned. It was absolutely a waste of money.   Vets can help guess but it's just that--a guess. Edit: grammar"
