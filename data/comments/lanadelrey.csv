lanadelrey,3dwwmw,ValentynaLoves,4,Mon Jul 20 05:19:39 2015 UTC,"We can pretty much guarantee that's not the case, because the Lana Del Ray album exists. She may be releasing so fast because she wants to get out of her contract with Interscope to found an imprint label or something, but I doubt she'd stop releasing records entirely."
lanadelrey,3dwwmw,theamericunt,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:29 2015 UTC,Good point.
lanadelrey,3dwwmw,gambinoindustries,2,Mon Jul 20 05:59:38 2015 UTC,I think she loves her fans. Also she writes about herself and her experiences. If she gave songs to others they would altar the sound of the song and be lyrically playing a part. That's not what lana wants. I think the only thing that would ever change is less touring and just writing songs. She does love her fans so much though I don't think she'll stop anytime soon.
lanadelrey,3dwwmw,graveyardgirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think she enjoys singing and writing songs for herself too much, so I don't see her stopping that completely. I don't think she enjoys fame and promoting and all of that though. I agree with the previous poster that she might want to start her own label to have more freedom."
lanadelrey,3dtfey,thearcticfire,2,Sun Jul 19 07:39:46 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I don't think it was ever released. If it was, it would've been on the Gatsby orchestral score album. Someone else asks about it in the comments here and it looks like nobody knows where to find it."

lanadelrey,3drxwt,graveyardgirl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"That's not a good option if you want high quality files. Generally, Youtube audio is capped at 128 KBPS for download, which is well below the 256 KBPS of an iTunes+ file or the 320 KBPS of a good MP3.

lanadelrey,3dlmay,ValentynaLoves,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:28 2015 UTC,Can you imagine writing a song and playing it for 6 years before the world finally heard it? I imagine this song means a lot to her.
lanadelrey,3dlmay,Utrolig,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like it means a lot to her as well. I can't confirm or decisively make this sort of claim, but it definitely sounds like the meaning is more 'real'. (Another song like it in the sense I'm talking about, Pawn Shop Blues)  That is, all artists draw out a certain extent of their life and put it into their work. Where Lana Del Rey is the wonderful character of Elizabeth Grant, and those songs appropriately so, Yayo seems to draw more from the Elizabeth Grant part of her life and less the character she would complete and evolve later (though obviously all her work derives in some capacity from her life). Yayo along with a lot of other songs from the appropriately titled AKA, I believe, demonstrates this sort of transition. If any of that makes sense."

lanadelrey,3dgumv,signalsphere,17,Thu Jul 16 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's growing on me. The weird thing with Lana is that songs that strike me as too slight or slow or whatever on first listen (e.g. the ""Big Eyes"" soundtrack stuff) often rapidly accumulate in power. I used to only really listen to the first half of BTD, but now am enamored with the second half. I've grown to adore ""Is This Happiness?"", whereas I used to pass it over in favor of the bolder songs on U/V. The thing I love about Lana, which rarely happens with other artists, is how her songs always feel like they're revealing themselves in new ways each time I listen.   I do still kinda feel like Honeymoon a little disjointed, and I wish that drum section would go on/build to something more as well, but I'm withholding judgement for now. Usually the rule with pop music seems to be that things I love on the first listen quickly lose their sheen. I kind of had a loose theory that ""Flipside"", which is quite drawn out and minimalistic and slow and noirish, might be a bridge to the sound in this album; I feel that there are similarities between ""Honeymoon"" and ""Flipside"" (as well as the ""Big Eyes"" s/t songs ..). They all feel somehow grand and emptied out in the same way.   EDIT: I thought about this a little more and I think that ""Flipside"" is as much of a bridge lyrically as sonically. She seems to have abandoned straight storytelling, which was even present on Ultraviolence (""he used to call me D etc."") in favor of something more stark and pared back .. it's feels like oblique imagery strung together, which evokes her usual themes, scenes, characters etc., but seems to abstract them in a way that feels a little unsettling. Then again, I could be talking out of my *ss here, but hopefully some of that makes sense."

I don't care if you're talking out of your ass, always makes me happy to see comments here that have this type of depth :)   Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again   Hah, of course you could, Lana."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Utrolig,7,Sat Jul 18 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike Honeymoon, but one thing I've learned with Lana is that if you like her, then you can never say that you don't really like one of her new things so quickly. Everyone I know who likes Lana, myself included, have songs that grew on us even though we didn't like them very much at the start. Give it some time :D  But I did expect Honeymoon to be a lot faster and less UV-like. Perhaps this was the first choice for the single from the album precisely because it wasn't so different. It might have been too much of a shock if it were. She also said there was some ""muddy trap energy"" in one of the other songs on the album, so with that as evidence, I am expecting not only more diversity in the album but also some ""fast"" songs in that diversity."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Utrolig,3,Thu Jul 16 04:17:43 2015 UTC,"I've given this song about 10 listens since it came out, and I really only feel deep emotion during the end. The rest of the song is an airy rendition of a 70s love ballad, which isn't a bad thing, I just wasn't expecting that. I thought maybe the snippets she posted were possibly acapellas, but apparently not."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Alexxandros,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"Eh I'd say, musically, its got more of a ""Golden Age"" hollywood feel to it. I love the song."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Alexxandros,2,Fri Jul 17 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"With ""Ultraviolence"" I initially didn't care for the back half of the album. Now it's my favorite and I listen to it way more than it's super strong start. Some of my favorite songs are the songs that took me longest to appreciate."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,marinafanatic,3,Fri Jul 17 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here man. I like the song, nowhere near bad AT ALL. But I'm not a big fan of it. The violins or whatever at the beginning sounded so good, if that was in more of the song it would've been better. She hyped us up so much but it just didn't turn out as good as the hype had expected it too. I'm just hoping this album isn't like Ulraviolence for me, because the singles for Ultra were good but when the album released I bought deluxe and hated every single song. It took me till January of this year to actually enjoy most of them, and this is coming from someone who's loved Lana since 2011. MTWBT is still the first single and James Franco confirmed the album is still being released in September so it must be coming soon. LIB sounded really good and I can't wait to hear the full thing. I'm hoping we get some more fast paced tracks, like DMB or DP."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,LikelyWhisper99,5,Thu Jul 16 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"I understand why you feel that way. That's how I felt with Ultraviolence at first, until I heard her singing the songs live, and then I had a new appreciation for it. I've loved Honeymoon since I first heard it, and here's why: It's cinematic. The music sounds like a film score, and I'm sure her experience doing Young and Beautiful as well as her other songs featured in movies has helped with that. It reminded me almost of an old movie. And that made her vocals seem even more powerful in it. I know you don't enjoy it now, but I promise if you give it time, it will grow on you. She said that it would be more like Born to Die that Ultraviolence, and I'm sure the record probably will, but the song Honeymoon seems, to me, more like something we would have heard on Paradise. Think about it with that in mind, and maybe you'll get a new appreciation for it. If you don't, that's fine. You aren't forced to like every Lana song."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,BeautifulKiller,3,Thu Jul 16 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I know that it won't be my favorite track. I know that it's a good song for a lower mood or when I'm in the mood for very calm songs, but mostly I'll listen it when I'm going to listen the whole Honeymoon album in one sitting. (or maybe I fall in love sometime in the future, who knows)  I'm not stoked, but I'm not disappointed either. I'll see what comes next for the album. 'Life is Beautiful' sounds awesome in the Age of Adaline trailer. I hope it will made the final cut for the album."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,mag_cue,3,Thu Jul 16 07:31:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's alright, I was just hoping for a more upbeat, faster-paced song because that's more my style."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,galacticmew,3,Thu Jul 16 14:46:45 2015 UTC,"I love it, but I can understand why some people don't. I think it works beautifully as an opening track and makes me very excited for her new album. It took me a few listens then it started getting stuck in my head and I've been listening to it a lot these past couple days. I've always been a fan of her slower, moodier songs though. I love her upbeat, catchier songs too but songs like this one are what made me actually start seriously listening to her and love her as an artist. It's like an emotional experience rather than a pop song."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Ureth_RA,3,Thu Jul 16 20:08:15 2015 UTC,I'm sure there's others. People had the same feeling when UV was released
lanadelrey,3dgumv,Suckitnerdz,5,Fri Jul 17 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, this release is purely for hype/buzz, which is probably why it's not available on iTunes.   I personally enjoy the song and love that it feels very Lana, but I also desire some more melodic and uptempo tracks as well - songs that we can sing along to and a chorus that will really stick in our heads. I personally hope Honeymoon will echo the feel of the Paradise EP. It had the best mix of some more uptempo pieces with a balance of the slower tracks. That EP is perfect from beginning to end.   I can see the disappointment that the title track of the new album is not as commercial as some had hoped, but Born To Die was produced to get Lana into the mainstream. Listen to the demos of all the songs that made it onto BTD and they sound a lot like Paradise and UV. Emile Haynie took some of those songs and overproduced them to the point that they're something else entirely. Some of the tracks were great yes, but some were nonsense. I believe Lana doesn't really like the hiphop beats and production of BTD and that was a tool from her record label to get her well-known. She quickly transitioned her style to Paradise and then UV (her record label was not happy with the Ultraviolence tracks and even delayed her release until other producers said the album was good).   Now that she has achieved some success she can do more of what she wants. She now has the perfect balance of an indie artist on a mainstream label.   Be patient. The album will be great.   Edit: I realize Hanynie also did Paradise, but I definitely think Lana was able to tone down the hiphop beats once BTD had gotten her a lot of attention."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,odspot,4,Thu Jul 16 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"While I'd love to give Lana the benefit of the doubt re: the hip-hop presence in BTD, a lot of her leaked unreleased stuff has a hip-hop influence (e.g. ""Ghetto Baby"" etc.)."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,tadlocks,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:41 2015 UTC,"Lana releases music that is so different you can't help but pause when you listen to a new song and think ""wait...do I like this?"". Lana, for even the most die hard fans, takes time to settle into your mind and appreciate her music. Even if the song sucks, it doesn't, because it's Lana and she's a true artist. WE all have our favorite songs by her and this one isn't one of my favs SO FAR but you need to take time to let it mellow into your mind and just let rest there as pure art."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,xprplninja,2,Thu Jul 16 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"I really like it, but it kind of makes me depressed with how haunting it sounds."

lanadelrey,3dgumv,theamericunt,2,Thu Jul 16 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"She's not confirmed to have worked with Emile Haynie at all for this record, so don't hold your breath."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,theamericunt,2,Thu Jul 16 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's not the new single, so let's just get that straight first; it's a hype track/promo single, which is probably supposed to be a tone-setting device for the rest of the work. The first single is likely coming within the next few weeks, along with the Honeymoon video and the video for the single.  As for the actual single, that's likely to be a track titled Music To Watch Boys To. With a title like that, it'd be downright disappointing if she put out something that didn't have a bit of a beat to it.  And to your complaint about title tracks...Ultraviolence's title track was probably the second worst song on the album. Not sure why you're putting so much stock in title tracks being the best of an album."
lanadelrey,3dgumv,zueymoth,3,Thu Jul 16 06:19:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say Ultraviolence was one of the stronger tracks on Ultraviolence. and the reason for all the emphasis on title tracks is because many artists (but not all) release a title track to kind of set the tone for the rest of the album. In essence, it is the album. I think Born to Die and Ultraviolence all did that on their respective albums. I'm getting a Bel Air-y vibe on this track, which is unfortunate, as it's one of my least favorite Lana songs.   However, I do agree about Music To Watch Boys To. If that song doesn't have at least drums, then we're in for a very slow, atmospheric album. Which I'm not saying is a bad thing, just unexpected."
lanadelrey,3dflqy,basicbiatch,7,Wed Jul 15 21:56:46 2015 UTC,Except that this is definitely made by a computer and not a real orchestra. The video is fake. The musicians do not even play the music on the same melody etc.
lanadelrey,3dflqy,lylateller,5,Thu Jul 16 07:19:54 2015 UTC,"Besides, it's really fucking weird that a professional group of musicians would be playing a song in public that was just released two days ago."

lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Utrolig,3,Wed Jul 15 02:30:22 2015 UTC,This is absolutely beautiful. Had chills the whole song.
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,coaster521,4,Wed Jul 15 06:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is going to be her best album yet (at least for me). With born to die, paradise, and uv, a lot of the songs come with melancholy and they make you feel melancholy a little, some songs more than others. This song has that too, except it feels uplifting really, like a movie with a resolution that's a true work of art that you can appreciate that makes you content despite all the sad stuff. I think it will be have a different effect on all of us and a good album for summer!   The song itself is just too good. It's so simple and lana has never sounded so good. It's so captivating despite being stripped down. I love how it sounds like born to die but sounds nothing like it at the same time. I really think lana is just getting better and better."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,gambinoindustries,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like UV was her best, and will stay that way."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,greengrassonthetv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:45 2015 UTC,I love uv. But I really think honeymoon will be great. Can't wait for life is beautiful too
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,gambinoindustries,4,Tue Jul 14 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that this album is not associated at all with the previous ones, however I see it as a ""happy"" version of ultraviolance in the sense that and less melancholy and dark"
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Chosen_by_God,3,Fri Jul 17 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is probably her most poetic song yet. I love it."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,wyldcrater,13,Fri Jul 17 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"after only one listen, I'm not really convinced. it seems... languid and unfocused, like it's trying to be too many things at once but can't seem to figure out what it is. there's no real sense of pacing; it just shifts between 15-second phrases seemingly at random.  then again I didn't like ultraviolence's title track immediately, so we'll see."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,eternalexodus,3,Tue Jul 14 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"Read it like a poem, she tells a very dark story in such a graphic form. It is a great song, probably not her best, but it is good."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,wyldcrater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"This is very much Haynie's style if you recall from the collab on ""Wait for Life"". His songs always seem tohave multiple phases."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,ValentynaLoves,2,Tue Jul 14 22:15:17 2015 UTC,This isn't a Haynie song. Rick Nowels produced it.
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,theamericunt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"well, according to his wiki page, his lana collabs are mostly from born to die, and are mostly straightforward, typically structured pop songs. even off to the races, which is as feverish a hodgepodge of sexual tension and longing as you'll find, follows a general verse-prechorus-chorus-verse-prechorus-chorus-bridge-chorus structure. honeymoon doesn't resemble that at all."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,eternalexodus,2,Wed Jul 15 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"It does, it's a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge and modified chorus/outtro. But the contrast between the parts is way more stark (especially the bridge, adding both percussion and trumpet). I wonder if his contributions to BTD were better suited because there was a lot more to the production team? Or maybe this is genuinely the direction they wanted and not the work of one man. Who knows! It's really got me anticipating the rest."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,ValentynaLoves,2,Wed Jul 15 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"I feel BTD drew a lot more inspiration from hip-hop and more 21st-century forms of music, while paradise segued into ultraviolence being a very-inspired retro album. BTD's production is much slicker, glossier, and more electronic than ultraviolence, which feels more organic and torch-y overall.  at any rate, I love that the two eras are so distinct, and I'm interested to see how honeymoon will shape up as more songs are released. I'm just not blown away by this first track, but again, I wasn't sold on ultraviolence immediately either."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,eternalexodus,6,Wed Jul 15 02:06:05 2015 UTC,Amazing as always.
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,impracticable,3,Wed Jul 15 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard any of the teasers so this is my first hearing. It's lovely. Sounds like a great mix of the Paradise and Ultraviolence sounds, which I personally prefer more than the BTD sound now (in terms of tempo and production)"
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Chasing_Uberlin,6,Wed Jul 15 11:54:33 2015 UTC,"Finally! A lot more stripped down than ultra violence, bar the chorus.. I love the simplicity of her voice in the track, and while the backing instrumental is a glorious orchestra, it doesn't distract the listener from the beauty of Lana's voice. (She does struggle sometimes over an orchestra - see ""Young and Beautiful"") The lyrics are very similar to the ultraviolence era, dark but hopeful.  The last chorus is simply stunning, those final pitches and ultra stripped version of the chorus is incredible.  Guys, This is album is gonna rock :)"
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,moneypocket,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yes! I love the minimal feel of it. Stripped down UV is a good way to put it. The sound of the leaked Black Beauty was what I absolutely loved, much more than the album version. I definitely wouldn't mind an album with a larger focus on just her voice."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Utrolig,5,Tue Jul 14 17:25:18 2015 UTC,I've not kept up with the gossip surrounding this album but this has now got me all kinds of excited

lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Difluoride,4,Tue Jul 14 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"I think there'll be a video, just because this was posted on her personal account and not on VEVO."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,graveyardgirl,6,Tue Jul 14 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"I think she was fed up with waiting and just released the audio alone, with the video soon to follow."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,theamericunt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:18 2015 UTC,Amazing.
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,Dalekz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"I hope the rest of the songs on this album stay in this direction. An enticing poem with a dreamy orchestra. Honeymoon is definitely alive and breathing, and I can tell after this piece that this is going to be a very different, but intense era for her and the fans."
lanadelrey,3d9f2j,christianstonem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:18 2015 UTC,Love this song WAY more than I thought I would based off of the insta posts. So minimalist and beautiful.

lanadelrey,3daw64,etf219,3,Tue Jul 14 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"On 'Honeymoon' Lana doesn't really push her style forward, but nor does she need to when the emotional thrills and spills are as cinematic and sublime as they are here. Album three can't come soon enough.   I couldn't agree more. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
lanadelrey,3da23e,Argentous,9,Tue Jul 14 17:52:33 2015 UTC,14 tracks in total I'm dead.  What exactly is muddy trap energy though?
lanadelrey,3da23e,basicbiatch,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:02 2015 UTC,I guess we'll find out!  And I'm still hoping that she releases some exclusive/regional tracks in addition to the 14. I always love those quite a bit.
lanadelrey,3da23e,Utrolig,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to hear that one. Even if I'm not sure what it is exactly. I do like trap and I love Lana.  My personal guess: an almost fast song with a kind of heavy bass or bass emphasis and a focus on the beat. Too different to call it trap, but trap-inspired aggressiveness, hence energy. Both trap and Lana can have a dark and grimy kind of atmosphere, so a fusion seems weird at first, but could be done well, preserving the best of both. Might be the closest thing to Off to the Races she's made."
lanadelrey,3da23e,ValentynaLoves,7,Thu Jul 16 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"I want to point out that Lana says Honeymoon is the first track on the album. Some people I've noticed seem underwhelmed by this single (maybe not on this sub but in general) and I think that this is on purpose, that this intro track is more of a mood-setter. It'll be interesting to hear the entire album as one cohesive piece."
lanadelrey,3da23e,Difluoride,3,Tue Jul 14 23:56:54 2015 UTC,She has a trappy song?!   So it seems this album is just whatever she wants an not staying with one genre like ultraviolence.    I might die if she has poppy trap songs. Perhaps this is what she was doing with Mark Ronson?
lanadelrey,3da23e,impracticable,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:33:19 2015 UTC,i'm not convinced at this point what she means when she says 'muddy trap'

lanadelrey,3cviyx,Utrolig,5,Sun Jul 12 05:28:36 2015 UTC,Ultraviolence is best. Iconic soul or life imitates art maybe?
lanadelrey,3cviyx,GrimGrinningGhost1,4,Sat Jul 11 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"Second that. I think Ultraviolence is best too. Reasons:   It is definitely Lana, but not overtly Lana. People who like Lana will instantly know it's Lana, but it's still a cool word for people who have no idea. A lot of other ""Lana phrases"" are also only Lana in context. Things like ""life imitates art"" or ""trust no one"" or ""paradise"" are only ""Lana"" if you put it in that context. Standalone, those phrases are from other things first and foremost, and Lana after the fact. [quick edit: I say this still knowing that it's a phrase originally from  A Clockwork Orange.] It also doesn't sound very pretentious."
