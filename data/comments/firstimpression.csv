Maybe it's learned just by being in a society with gender roles where masculine = aggressive and feminine = nuturing. You also look strong, dedicated, and very loyal. The smile definitely makes you look friendlier and kinder :)  Their was a study where they had pictures of guys side by side and they say ""pick the guy who looks the most racist/smart/aggressive/etc"". Guys with broader jaws and stronger brows (i.e. guys with higher testosterone) were significantly more likely to be picked out as more racist, and more agressive. People in our society just seem to associate high testosterone looks with stuff like that.... Guys with longer hair and guys with glasses were significantly less likely to be picked out as agressive.

firstimpression,3dkow3,ptera_tinsel,3,Fri Jul 17 04:16:20 2015 UTC,Not terribly kind looking but not unkind either. You make friends easily and you enjoy the outdoors.  You come from a happy stable family.  Girls find you charming but you can't seem to keep their interest for more than a couple months.  Your favorite beer is Heineken.
firstimpression,3dkow3,yoyototoro,3,Fri Jul 17 02:07:01 2015 UTC,I suspect you only look kind when smiling or caught off guard in a relaxed situation. As a default you might seem a little stone faced or intimidating but your smile lightens up your face.   I'm not surprised to hear you're a big softy though. :)
firstimpression,3dkow3,niecy_lindsay,3,Fri Jul 17 09:45:56 2015 UTC,"I have been known to be a little intimidating to people who don't know who I am, mainly because I happen to have a really deep voice. But they tend to get over it pretty fast haha"

Would we see more people smiling to strangers on the sidewalk or in the grocery store? Being kind is the one thing I strive to do every day, and it's not easy because of my historically judgmental attitude and my quick temper. Good on you, OP. Mister Rogers would be proud of you for who you are. I have a personal bias (I'm trying to overcome) that leads me to assume muscular/masculine guys are dicks because of the abuse I suffered in junior high, but I can see in your eyes that you're a good guy."

I am going to say that you are 19-20 and someone who takes pride in their appearance but not in a vain way. Mostly one of those things where you have always just been a healthy person and so you go to the gym, eat healthy, but when you have a cheat day you cheat big.  You are friendly to people, but because you tend to be the type who has goals and sticks to them you are sometimes intimidating to others even though you've never understood why.  You love Disney movies, frozen yogurt, and wearing sweats and a hoodie even though you also love and look amazing when you dress up.   You have a high sex drive and love showing off your body in the buff, but thanks to the infinite number of creeps not only online but in real life, you're hesitant to who you show it to.   Your music taste is mostly pop-rock, but you can enjoy the classic rock as well and even a few dance songs.  Your family was pretty middle-class, you didn't struggle with much in life but you definitely haven't lived a perfect life either.  You're at a point in your life where you are looking for a breath of fresh air and new opportunities and are excited for what the future brings.  You look like you are from Northern Europe, have the face of someone who chose to major in health or bio-medicine (of course you could've jumped on the bioengineering train as well that's what a lot of people in the US are gravitating toward)  You're not a huge party girl by any means, but when you let loose you let loose pretty hard."

People love to be around you but sometimes they need a break because you don't seem to have an 'off button'.  You don't realize how attractive you are so you're very down to earth. Because you are secretly insecure you compensate by putting on a charming devil may care attitude.  All in all a very cool happy person.

Or maybe you don't do starbucks.. you like the local coffee joint because it makes you feel trendy to dis starbucks.  You smoke something... either pot or cigarettes.. I'm leaning towards pot because cigarettes are gross and you don't do gross.  You do cutesy-rocker who is kind of dingy.

I've been to the US a few times, and I probably overtipped most of the time. I'd leave a $20 tip on a $60 bill because I didn't want to go through the calculation of it all, but my american friends kept insisting I was overtipping.

And if people are truly ignorant about tipping then they don't deserve to travel.

This picture tells a story of calmness, like this person has been through so much, but has endured.  I think that is the biggest thing I see; someone who endures.  This person is pensive....full of cares and worries.  I think she is someone who cares for others, though the responsibility may not have been her choice, she calmly puts aside her own wishes and dreams for others.  She's a beautiful person...so beautiful, but I feel like she's someone who is not 'seen' if that makes any sense.  Someone who is forgotten maybe?  I don't know, this picture makes me feel a bit melancholy.   Edit :  I'd really love some feedback on this one, if you're able.  I really feel like there's a story here...and I'd love to hear it.

You love animals and have been around them all your life.  You like sci-fi and anime and would love to cosplay.. if you don't already.  You play MMORPG games and have a wicked sense of humor.  You love pancakes for dinner and good old fashion southern cooking..jumbalay or craw fish fry (I don't remember what they're called).  Did I already say you love animals?

I live in Gainesville (student at UF) and my parents are in fact together, although their marriage is total shit imo.  You listen to techno and only drink mixed drinks.  I almost exclusively listen to emo/pop punk rock. I could get into something like techno though. I should expand my music tastes. I do only drink mixed drinks, or I take shots. I hate beer; I never see myself getting into beer. When I drink, I drink to get drunk lol.  Your pet peeves are cats and messy hair. You secretly love Kanye West and Nicki Minaj.  I'm a cat fanatic! I loathe small dogs. They're so yappy and they just seem kinda dumb haha. Messy hair is a huge pet peeve of mine. Gotta look sharp!

You are 27 and single but you have had a number of deep relationships and a couple of spiritual connections resulting in a plural relationships or at least very profound connections.  You are a photographer or something artsy and surround yourself with friends who aren't toxic and look at the beauty of life.

Sometimes I tell myself that I'm engaging with the type of thinking that the rest of the world says ""gtfo"" to, and making the world a better place by arguing with it, but really, I think I might just be insecure. It seems like it, if I try to be honest with myself, at least. I value honesty quite a lot. I've come to believe that it's a skill, not a decision, and I try to hold myself to that even if I have to admit that I was wrong, but it could be another one of those ""the world needs people to be like this"", things.  I have that stack of books.. And you're right, never really wanted a Kindle.  I'm a slob, though.. I suppose the things I care about are in a particular way, but dishes are something I do only when I don't have any more bowls to drink out of.

You treat the employees under you with respect and a tough ""love policy"" in hopes they might take you on as a role model and learn from your own success.

Thank you for getting drunk and sharing; absolutely the best fun to be had....here we go! :  You're so keen to try anything and everything.  There is a great urge/need/fire within you to fill a void; you don't like to spend too much time figuring it all out; just need to keep DOING.  You are kind, loyal, sweet and gentle.  You're mostly placid, but should never be thought of as docile...you'll fire up if needs be: that surprises people who think you're so damn mellow.  You're not good at being alone.  All the thoughts etc lead you to feeling a bit nervous and jittery: you bite your nails and I reckon you'd be one to chow down on a souvlaki or drink a beer out of anxiousness rather than need on occasion. You need to be doing something so you don't go too deep into your thoughts.  You're a feeler of deep feels, and you are prone to melancholy.  You're very good natured.  Very giving...but sometimes you give too much of yourself and feel a bit exhausted by it all.  You'd be quite happy floating around the world doing whatever, but you need someone or something to come back to.  A home base and a sense of belonging to tether you or ground you so you don't disappear off the planet and end up in a kibbutz with no one remembering your original name.   There's someone in your life who loves you so damn much, and who will forgive you just about anything. I keep on thinking whoever she is, she gives the best hugs."

Later a mate would say to you 'Mate, she was totally into you' and you'd shake your head because you missed the cues...and you'd say 'Whadufuk'. (Username ref FTW!!)  Other than that: You don't get out much...you're not much of an outdoorsy person.  Not the most physical guy, though I could see you on a bike.  Not a runner or a gym rat, that's for sure.   You over think things.  You're a ponderer I think, pulling conversations apart and wondering what people meant, a jumper to conclusions...and a bit anxious.

firstimpression,3adnrg,MBA_IN_WUMBOLOGY,2,Mon Jun 22 23:04:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! So I have 4 mascaras that I use, Urban Decay Subversion(lash primer), Urban Decay Perversion, They're real by benefit, Volume 1 second mascara by Bourjois. When I don't want my lashes to be super thick, more subtle but still getting the length I use the first 3 I listed (subversion, perversion, they're real) I've found that the lash primer really helps lengthen my lashes and helps get the second coat of perversion to extend my lashes even more. I normally do around 2-3 coats of the perversion mascara, but it really depends on the day and how subtle I want my look to be. Then using the benifits mascara really helps separates the lashes if they clump together.   Now when I want more of a pow in the eyes, I use the Bourjois mascara, just adding on to the steps above. This mascara gives it more thickness I'd like to say, more depth. I've learned with this mascara a little goes a long way, so be careful on how much you apply as it can clump your lashes. Although if my lashes do clump I normally go back with my benifits mascara and it helps even it out again.   In the first picture (purple backround) I am wearing false lashes, I have no idea what brand they are. I'm pretty sure I got them from just a regular drug store, I do know they were around 7 dollars. When applying falsies I've made sure all my makeup is done, apart from my lashes.   First I use my benifit mascara just to give my real lashes some shape and help blend into the falsies, since it is the whole point you don't want people to notice! Never in my life have I have used white lash glue to put on lashes, I swear by black lash glue, It's honestly amazing. I use the Duo eyelash adhesive in ""Dark-tone"", I really love this glue just because once its dried it turns into a rubber like material, so when you want to reuse your lashes you can just peel the glue off from last time, it's super easy. Not only that but when it dries, it blends in with your eyeliner and there's no awkward random white parts. When putting the lashes on the less glue the better, just because it looks more natural and its easier to take your lashes off after.   Once they're on I go back with the They're real by benifits and go super easy on the bourjois mascara, I simply add more mascara on after just so my real lashes and fake lashes are blended in together and the fake lashes being coated in a little mascara makes it appear that they're real. I hope this helped, and if there is anything else you want to know just ask! I love make up and I love giving advice on it. If you do end up getting the mascaras let me know how you like them!"

High school was an awkward time for you, as you felt you didn't fit in exactly. As a 'late bloomer', you're totally investing in the things that interest you at the moment(e.g: comic-con, etc), and enjoy them unapologetically.  You love technology and art equally, so your career goals can fall anywhere between technology and visual arts (engineering, photography, graphic design, film), although I suspect you haven't found quite where you fit in careeer-wise.  On the personal life front, you are a little shy, sometimes socially awkward. Those less than stellar formative years left you lacking in the social skills department, so you struggle sometimes with getting to know new people, specially if their interests fall outside of your own. Once you do warm to people though, you can be quite fun/funny. You had a crappy-ish romantic life as a teen, but as you've grown into who you are and got comfortable with yourself, you've also gained enough confidence, and some sexual experience.

It's in the sadness in your eyes, and the way you look like you are hating having to take this picture. Your insecurity bleeds through this photo. You don't look like an idiot however. I believe you are very young, and are currently going through your ""metamorphosis"" phase - you don't look anymore like the little kid you used to be, but you have not quite grown into your 'adult' look. This has caused you to feel very insecure about yourself, and you are probably experiencing some body dysmorphia as a result. Add that to the hormone flunctuations, and the fact that you feel you have no luck with the opposite sex (or whatever sex you are attracted to, I ain't judging), your confidence is down the shitter. Good news is that you are going to grow into a very handsome young man.  Bad news is that looks is only part of the equation - for you to be happy, and confident, you also have to work on the other aspects of yourself.  Also, are you a skater, or into any type of sports? Not the typical jock, but I would wager the lonely type who is introverted, but wishes to desperately change that.  Hey, keep that chin up, you got good genetics, you just need to work on what's keeping you from feeling comfortable in your own skin, and I don't mean physically. You need to figure out what's holding you back from accepting you and loving yourself."
firstimpression,39tifm,Lalizin,2,Tue Jun 16 23:46:57 2015 UTC,Wow that was beautifully written and almost 100% spot on. I am not a skater nor really into any sport only motorsports. Do you study psychology by any chance ?

firstimpression,39tifm,Lalizin,2,Wed Jun 17 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"Bruises on your face consistent with scraping your face against a surface while in motion. Not sure whether it happened during a motorsports event, but the fact that you were comfortable enough to take a photo that shows the bruising suggests that this is a normal occurance for you, or at least something that doesn't bother you profoundly- in other words, while irritating, there's no big drama attached to it - if it had been a one time occurrence or an assault you would have  likely waited until it had healed to take a photo.  I thought of skating because it's more popular than motorsports, but you don't seem like the traditional sports guy, so I figured something alternative that allows you to blow some steam, but is not a team sport activity."

firstimpression,37zul0,Bandit_Queen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:31:37 2015 UTC,How long is it before you get bored? I usually last about two years. Then I feel bad about not wanting to be in the relationship so I stay longer. Which just makes it worse on me. It also makes it really hard to break up with someone because they just don't understand why I want to leave all of a sudden. And I really really hate hurting people so I put up with being miserable way longer then I should.
firstimpression,37zul0,Vorocano,0,Mon Jun 1 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"I find that both relatable and admirable. I think too many people jump into relationships out of desperation, whether it's to avoid loneliness or just be validated in some way, but I see that as a sign of weakness. I imagine you're pretty inundated with guys trying to get with you, though, which probably reinforces your feelings of boredom since you probably aren't really being challenged."

You do friendly like a peaty whiskey that everyone wants to have but are secretly scared to drink too much of. Friendly like a long hill climb at the tail end of a long bicycle ride through the countryside. Like a plasma welding torch, a barely contained sun. Like the final straightaway at the end of the big race, a pair lightning fast cars screaming to the finish line, risking life, love, all, to get to that checkered flag, knowing that for one to win all others must lose.  You don't have friends. You can't. Everyone you know either recoils from you like a hand from a live wire, or falls in love with you forever... or wants to."

You grew up more religious than you are now but still consider yourself spiritual. You have long term relationships -- not super into the casual thing. From the Midwest. Probably one of the most fashion forward and hip people in your town of 50-100 k people. Listen to the shins and Clal your hands say yeah.  You became  pretty later in life. Like around 20. So even though you know you're attractive it means a lot to hear it. Also you are attractive. You live within a a car drive distance to a bigger city. My guess is you can be in Chicago or maybe Indianapolis for a day trip. You worked at a steakhouse as a hostess at some point. When you sing karaoke it's always Tom Petty or the Spice girls. You're funny. But in a dry way that many people don't get. Studied theatre but only as a side project. Like took an elective class sophomore year. I think you like dogs but mostly 40-50 pound shaggy dogs. You like to go to flea markets but oddly enough for vintage toys.  When you cut your hair that short the older people in your family were nice about it but said things like ""you had such pretty hair"" is a sort of passive aggressive way. Currently you work in retail but just until you figure some thing out. You drive a Honda Civic. It's not new but not old either.  So yeah. This is your life story I made up for you. But really if I saw you on the street the first thing I would think is ""what a bright, warm smile and pretty eyes. """

firstimpression,379k11,folkrav,2,Mon May 25 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"It looks like your drinking something from star bucks so I'm guessing your not apposed to paying highly for something you like. Your also sitting outside so you enjoy being outside to some extent. Your T-shirt tells be you like electronic music purely from the design being similar to a bands logo I know of, far fetched? A little. Your facial hair tells me that your still family young early 20? You posted this 2hs ago that would be 1:33am for me so unless your like me I'm guessing your from America if not England. Nothing else I can devise, how far am I?"
firstimpression,379k11,lilraz08,2,Tue May 26 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"True for the paying for stuff I like. Those hibiscus refreshers in summer... Damn. I like outside, indeed. My field of study doesn't make me go outside that much, but I do enjoy getting outside and enjoy the weather. Not a purely ""electronic"" band, but really not that far. That picture actually was taken like 2-3 years ago, so I was 21-22 at the time. Good eye! Facial hair has grown since, but still rocking that same goatie."

firstimpression,37a3ex,Aristobutts,2,Tue May 26 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"You're one handsome motherfucker.  No homo.  I think you might be a last year student in Accounting or something... And you have a shoe rack which is pretty bad ass. I would say you are an easy-going person with not too many friends, rather a few who are very close to you.  You probably get along very well with your family, but you like keeping your emotions for yourself.  That's all. Probs all wrong, but whatever, it's fun."
firstimpression,37a3ex,foodiesgonnafood,2,Tue May 26 12:57:51 2015 UTC,Holy shit! That's so close. Honestly the only thing you got wrong was my year and major. That's amazing!!

firstimpression,37c6rx,capefear56,5,Tue May 26 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"You are...  probably not the guy in the picture.   But in case you are: You don't really like guns, or at least are not very used to using them. The way the AK-47 (or some derivative) is slung across your shoulder, ignoring the attached strap, combined with what seems to be a casual and jovial demeanour suggests that while you may be passionate about whatever cause has led to you wield a firearm, you are not so passionate about actually fighting.   I think you're a keen cook and love to prep and grill meat, and you strike me as someone who'd be very keen to converse with people over a few coffees. You are very protective of your family, although you feel that some of them don't understand you. You like football, especially FC Barcelona."

I think you have nice hair so Imma say you care about your appearance. I also think you look easy to approach and friendly, so you probably have people come to you more often than you go to them."
firstimpression,3780ci,lioneyexp,2,Mon May 25 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"I think you look nervous taking this photo, maybe it was meant for this sub. I think you are a generally nice guy. You would take crap from people, but not for too long. Maybe it is just me, but you look like a tall guy, but might have been bullied when you were in high school. You don't look too old, so that may not have been too long ago, so you might be 19-22.  You want to continue your studies incollege, but have no idea what you want to do. You don't really try to look or dress nice for some reason, but if you did, you'd be more confident. Maybe its cause you are a big dude. Tall dude's can dress nice if they know how.  You have this look in your eyes that kinda say, ""I don't give a fuck"", but you do. Last thing, you're not good with computers."
firstimpression,376cp4,I_CAN_MAKE_BAGELS,5,Mon May 25 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"You look like a great time to hang out with, probably full of love, care free, very easy to get along with, well maintained. Very patient seems like. I'd say you're probably mid 20's.   Who's that guy kissing your cheek?"
firstimpression,376cp4,CJC_Swizzy,2,Mon May 25 09:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hahaaha. I just realized the title is misleading. The dude is my actual best-friend, and he's with my dog in the picture.  She's all those things though. :p"
