And based on the landscape, I would have to presume it's in the western part of the park, possibly somewhere around Norris or up towards Mammoth Hot Springs.  The eastern part is a little more mountainous, and the southern part more forest.   Actually, with the snow cover and lack of mountains in the background, it could easily be some of the prairie land out in the Lamar Valley to the northeast. That has a lot of the cliche 'American West' type scenery, rolling prairies edged by big bluffs and craggy mountains."

In Tasmania there are ski fields in the north, near Launceston. Tasmania is very mountainous and all the mountains get snow during winter. The capital, Hobart has mount Wellington looming over it and it has snow on the top for most of winter. 2 days ago on the first day of winter we had snow to the 400 meter level. It snows in the city at sea level about once ever 2 or 3 years, but it doesn't settle.  It snows in south eastern Queensland on very rare occasions, like once in a decade ""cold snaps"""

winterporn,2znivn,motrvatd,10,Fri Mar 20 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"I'm Canadian and have lived in the Yukon, PEI, BC and Alberta, and I've definitely witnessed storms with 40+cm of snow while it was in the -25C area."
winterporn,2znivn,PatG87,7,Fri Mar 20 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Read what I posted above! It is an expression which more refers to the lack of humidity associated with low temperatures. Its not a pissing contest, and if it was... I can't one-up living in the Yukon!"
winterporn,2znivn,fernguts,2,Fri Mar 20 03:48:14 2015 UTC,"The title is still incorrect though.   -20 is never ""too cold for snow"", in fact the colder air gets, the more likely it is to snow.   What you meant to say is ""too dry for snow at this temperature"".  However, if you were to chill that same air down further, guess what, it would snow!"
winterporn,2znivn,alfonzo_squeeze,3,Fri Mar 20 11:08:28 2015 UTC,"What you meant to say is ""too dry for snow at this temperature"".    Isn't the corollary to that ""too cold for snow at this humidity level""? Continuing to push the argument after OP has already conceded that he's not technically correct is just arguing for the sake of arguing."
winterporn,2znivn,pchc_lx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"I've already explained that it is just an expression, and what it alludes to (and how it is factually incorrect), twice in these comments! :P Also give the above link a read! I'm not an expert at these sorts of processes, but it kind of points towards colder temperatures having less moisture capacity!"
winterporn,2znivn,EducatedHippy,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Canada my whole life too! I've heard the term (often) it whenever it is sub -10! Maybe because where I am the temperature doesn't drop that low often, and the majority of the snowfall is between 0 to -5... anywhere lower than that we don't get much snow! As stated several times now, it is entirely to do with the low humidity our region has during low temperatures!   It's an expression you should probably stop using then, because it's never correct, and can actually be quite misleading. For the record, I've lived in Canada my entire life, and I've never heard anybody say ""it's too cold for snow"".   Nice anecdotal evidence though!"

winterporn,2znivn,RaccoNooB,-1,Fri Mar 20 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"That's not because it's too cold, but because its too dry.

That's not because it's too cold, but because its too dry  Experts say only at absolute zero would snow become impossible.    Did you read the article, or are you just trolling?"
winterporn,2znivn,TrynnaFindaBalance,-1,Fri Mar 20 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"You skipped the line ""When temperatures are that low, the air's capacity for water vapor becomes very small.""   We all know that cold air can hold less humidity, so wouldn't cooling it more make it snow?   I legit see where you are coming from, but less capacity doesn't mean it dumps more snow more often, but rather the opposite.   The article is also about why people use the expression ""too cold for snow,"" which is why I redirected you to it instead of being confused by my title!"
winterporn,2znivn,couchpoop,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"True, you won't see clouds forming over your head on a cold day. But you can still have rain/snow clouds blown by the wind into your area from somewhere else.  If it's raining or snowing, the clouds almost always come from somewhere else. Clouds don't form over your head and then immediately rain/snow on you. That would be some very weird temperature or atmosphere shifts.   They form somewhere else, where it's humid enough to form clouds. Then they get blown by the wind to you, and then they rain/snow. They precipitate because it's too cold to stay as vapor."
winterporn,2znivn,brezhnervous,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:37:57 2015 UTC,"Not really. Usually, it will get gradualy colder where I live, and as it drops below zero it'll start to snow. We'll get a couple of meters or so and eventually it's down to like -30 or -40 and it'll just stop snowing all together.  However if the temperature drops very quickly, there's no time for the snow to come and you're left with OP's picture."

Yeah, the snowscape in rural areas is pretty, but at some point it's just white.  There's no charm to it.  Christmas time is the same cheap decorations (that stay up most of the year), whole neighborhoods aren't really decorated and there's nothing to draw the feeling of festivity to the community. We never had the Christmas 'village'attractions or anything to really foster the winter/seasonal spirit. You may have had a church Christmas pageant or something, otherwise it was a pretty solitary holiday and time of year."

winterporn,2wvv8b,cpu5555,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:46:00 2015 UTC,"What is a graduated ND filter? And I'm super amateur, I took this with my cellphone"
winterporn,2wvv8b,cpu5555,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:57:16 2015 UTC,"A ND filter reduces the amount of light that goes through on all wavelengths. A graduated ND filter is designed to reduce the amount of light that goes through at a specific region. This helps prevent washed out skies.  If you can't use a graduated ND filter, then you should shoot the same scene at a different time of day. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. So if you shot this in the afternoon, you need to shoot the same scene in the morning or vice versa. This will keep the sun outside of the scene to prevent a washed out sky.  The time of day is more important because it affects lighting and color. You can take good pictures of this scene without filters. You just need to find the right time to do so."
winterporn,2wvv8b,cpu5555,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:27:10 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I googled it... this would work well for my dslr. As for this photo, I took it in the morning and with my cellphone, lol I think if I was using one of my actual cameras the glare would be reduced significantly"
winterporn,2wvv8b,cpu5555,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, good lighting is more important. You should capture this same scene in the afternoon or evening. If a washed out sky is still an issue, then you should try a graduated ND filter."

The village itself has an unique architecture, and is a UNESCO world heritage site.   We slept at someones home, which appearantly wasn't too uncommon. People rent out parts of their home and make food for you. The bath in that village is also to recommend."

Highly recommend it if you ever go.  One of the most striking memories I have ever had is because of that hotel. We drove from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon in a day, and arrived around 9pm at night. This was in late October, so it was quite dark when we arrived. We walked around some of the trails, sitting and enjoying the night sky. The next morning I woke up, poured a cup of coffee, and walked out to a bench we were sitting on the night before. Then just stared, because my brain truly couldn't comprehend what it was seeing. It blew me away that it was all right there in front of me less than 8 hours before, but I had no clue."
winterporn,2rml6i,TheSumOfAllSteers,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Stopped at Indian Garden during my Summer visit. It's definitely a doozy for a first visit. Unfortunately, the grand canyon was the first stop in a week long road trip that ended up as a bit of a hiking tour. It was killer. I'd really like to attempt a trip to the river on my next trip (with appropriate equipment! That's very important), and eventually I'd like to attempt a rim-to-rim hike.  My group got there during a storm at night, so we didn't see much of it until the next morning. It's definitely an amazing thing. The size of it fucks with your depth perception and makes it look like a big portrait."
winterporn,2rml6i,Flat_corp,1 point,Thu Jan 8 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yah I felt incredibly accomplished after hiking the whole thing. I just kept stopping and staring every couple hundred feet. It was easily one of the high points of my life. The only feeling that came close was a few weeks later. I live in Buffalo, and during the storm where we got 7 feet of snow dumped on us I live in an area that was right in the thick of it. I hiked a trail 2 miles to the local tops for some booze. Hiking there and back was more difficult than the canyon. I felt like a god when I got home safely, mainly because I was actually worried for my safety. I stupidly thought I could hike 2 miles in 4 foot deep snow, with 10 feet visibility, alone, with no problem. I won't make that mistake again, I very easily could have died. I'm not in the best shape, but I'm not in bad shape either, but if I was even 10% less fit I don't know if I would have lived."
winterporn,2rml6i,TheSumOfAllSteers,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:53:24 2015 UTC,"I had felt really accomplished after hiking my portion of Bright Angel, then I met some guy who had just finished a North to South trip. Every few hundred feet in, we'd look back with a sort of ""we're going to have to go all the way back up..."" dread, but it was absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, it began to storm on us during the ascent. Getting out of the canyon was such a liberating thing. We immediately went back to our campsite and just drank.  The canyon was actually the first stop on a road trip which took us up through SLC. That said, despite how amazing the Grand Canyon was, the best part was a mountain pass on the 89 (near the 1000s). The storm that hit us in the canyon decided to follow us up through Utah. Southern California has been in a nasty drought, so rain is something I hadn't properly experienced in a long while. During my stretch of the drive, the rain picked up pretty bad. Winds were pushing my care every way and the rain was coming in at a heavy angle, striking the broadside of the car (shit was sideways!). I was traveling 40 miles per hour for about 20 minutes until the rain finally let up to a reasonable level. I legitimately feared for our lives. It ended just as we came over two large hills into a valley with a river following the highway. Everything was green, the river was raging, and light pierced the clouds at just the right spots (then Bon Iver came up on the playlist). I never expected my favorite part of a 2000 mile roadtrip to happen in the car, especially following the canyon hike.  I've never really experienced a proper snow hike? Are there any huge differences? My only assumption is that the snow itself demands a bit more effort to walk."
winterporn,2rml6i,Flat_corp,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:05:40 2015 UTC,"An incredible amount of effort. It's basically like swimming through sand. My legs were so shot after hiking it that when I got home I couldn't walk for an entire day afterwards. The snow coming down was unlike anything I had ever seen before. It took me 3 hours to hike 2 miles there and 2 miles back. It was actually terrifying. I'll post some videos from the storm. This was Tuesday, technically the first DAY of the storm. We got another 3 1/2 feet after what you see in the video. It snowed with whiteout intensity for FOUR entire days. It really was wild. In the videos it doesn't look like it is coming down too hard, imagine what your watching coming down at least double. Also when I say ""car"" what I mean is my Hyundai Santa Fe... so not a small car by any means.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/326krxqunsf9bq7/IMG_3968.MOV?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7anwko4e1y7fv9/IMG_3969.MOV?dl=0"

winterporn,2rjwlq,randompersons90,2,Tue Jan 6 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"I had a conversation with a UW professor whose area of specialty was the regrowth of the Mt. St. Helens blast zone, and one of the things he said was a big surprise to the biologists that studied the area from 1980-Present was the importance of ""micro-sites"".   He told me that a tiny crack or sheltered area that could provide a seed even the smallest protection from the harshness of the barren area around it was a huge factor in the successful growth and reintroduction of plants there - it looks like you found both a rock and a can that were successful micro-sites some years ago! Very interesting."

As we got near, we saw to our horror that they were bathing in a wide hole cut in the ice, then they'd go in a small house nearby and they'd emerge from there steaming, only to throw themselves in the freezing water again.

winterporn,2qbl8b,DrubieDaGuru,2,Thu Dec 25 05:22:23 2014 UTC,"Haha I went to highschool in Fairbanks... (moved there from a much smaller town in Alaska, Kasilof for those in the know) It was... ok... um... I guess if you're studying climate change, petroleum engineering, or natural resources management it's probably a great school. Or if you're into skiing and wanna do it in weather that's so cold you have to wear a mask over your entire face.  There's definitely cool stuff about Fairbanks. Makes me kinda sad to see someone dismiss a place in Alaska as ""oh it's shitty."" The international ice carving championships are there, they make a huge ice park and you can walk around it and see the sculptures. Chena Hot Springs, which has in ice hotel, and is an olympic swimming pool-sized natural hot spring, is only 45 minutes away by car. There's a cool coffee shop near the university that has open mic nights. You get to see northern lights allll the time in winter.   And dont' forget the equal and opposite reaction of the light summer. It's really beautiful and amazing and perfect for camping. Yeah it's cold as fuck in the winter but in the summer you can go hiking all the time and the scenery is more beautiful and breathtaking in real life than you get from photos. In the summer there is an amazing farmer's market community, the market is fun. Think of all the blueberries and salmon you will get to eat for cheap :)  If you have major problems with depression avoid it because the Seasonal Affective Disorder will get you. I think if you're on antidepressants you would be ok but you'd have to actively manage it with psychotherapy and light therapy (special lamps).  Fairbanks isn't a city so much as a small town masquerading as a city because it's bigger than the villages in Alaska. You know it's not anything like the other cities in the lower 48, there's not a club scene or anything like that.  But if you have the opportunity to go live there for a couple years, and then come back down ot the lower 48 if you miss it, you should definitely go.  When I was in college I wanted to spend a year in India on a study abroad, and I was really scared about applying. Then I realized, 10 years from now, when I look back, will the difference between 3 years and 4 years of my college be better than the difference between 0 and 1 years in India? So for you, would the difference between 0 and 2-3 years in Alaska compare to the difference of spending 2-3 years away from wherever you're from?  I outgrew it and left leave Alaska when I was 20 and since then I've lived in Seattle and San Francisco and I like these places as my permanent home but Alaska is REALLY cool and I'm so glad I got to spend my formative years there. It's definitely the kind of place that will make you grow as a person, just getting used ot it will expand your personality."

winterporn,2oxsie,Nova_Jake,3,Thu Dec 11 14:41:55 2014 UTC,"It was one of the first ""meta-castles"". Yeah I just made that word up,  let me explain: it was build as a palace for an eccentric king of Bavaria, and he wanted it to look like a real life fairy tale scene, of the kind that had taken root after castles had sort of become a thing of the past. This was the mid 1800s, so real military forts had long since become low, sturdy structures that could resist cannon fire. Tall castles where kings and queens lived in towers behinds keeps, those were long gone and had become part of the cultural memories of Europe, romanticized by contemporary literature about the high middle ages.  King Ludwig wanted to live in a castle like that. So it was designed with all aesthetic elements of an old school palace (tall towers with turrets, an imposing gatehouse, courtyard, keep and so on), exaggerated for effect, and built in a highly impractical but beautiful location with relatively modern technology."

For a city that's in an area where it could snow it certainly is not prepared for it. There was a huge storm in 2006 that knocked out power to parts of the city for 2 weeks or more.   I was living in Omak at the time and had been in Seattle the day the storm started. I drove for the first time in snow (I'm also a Native Southern Californian) over Snoqualamie pass and was required to put on chains but didn't know how. My then boyfriend (now husband) couldn't help because he's disabled. Thank goodness for friendly semi drivers!

winterporn,2nig32,instasquid,5,Thu Nov 27 04:11:45 2014 UTC,"It is my hometown, and really, downtown is all about the gimmick. It kinda sucks growing up there because nothing is directed towards locals. But if you really want to have a good time come in the summer. River floating, camping, hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking, tons of great fun to be had if you are an outdoorsy type and it gets you outside the small town's city limits for most of it."

winterporn,2ni8n9,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,3,Wed Nov 26 22:25:54 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  It was a winter with not so much snow.  My classmate knocked on my door in the middle of the night on a rare night it snowed and we went just enough outside to enjoy it.  :)  Kyoto's an amazing city, the most interesting city I've lived in or visited.  It was fun to be able to hop on the bike and go visit any number of beautiful places nearby.  In a lot of ways it's what I think a city should be: a nice mix of old and new, with a mix of tranquility and a city's pace.  Not many places where you can see parades and events that have taken place annually for over a millennia (!).  It really made me appreciate their culture.  It gave me a perspective and showed me how a city could be alive and vibrant.  So much different than where I returned to work in Silicon Valley.  Of course there's good and bad things about everything, and by the end of my stay there were plenty of annoying things about Kyoto I didn't miss much.  As a foreigner, your options for working there are pretty limited.  I think the ideal arrangement would be working remotely and living in Kyoto.  That would be a nice place to raise a family I think.  :)  Thanks for the suggest!  I'll cross-post it."

Caption from the photographer:    As the weather got worse in the evening, I hesitated to use the camera before. Before i spotted one interesting situation, with pedestrians walking against car lights, on a zebra crossing. The snow had become chaotic as sharp cold wind became annoying. Cars were barely advancing, the light was difficult, the woman with umbrella was standing there petrified. I pulled out the camera and took the picture, handheld, marking the first snow of the year."

winterporn,2kvox3,onlysame1,4,Fri Oct 31 12:56:51 2014 UTC,"I have some constructive criticism, if you don't mind: First of all, the bench is slightly out of focus, I noticed that right away. In addition, I think it would be more welcoming if you framed the bench more towards the right side of the screen... I could picture myself sitting on that bench on a brisk winter morning enjoying the park for a few moments, but the way you have it crowded towards the left side it seems like there wouldn't be much room :P Lastly where it cuts off the base of the bench seems abrupt. If you could get just a bit more of the base of the bench in the shot, make sure it's completely in focus (a small aperture will help) and move the bench to the right third instead of the left third of the frame, that would improve this shot considerably imo. It could be hard to find another morning with just the right amount of snowfall, though."

winterporn,2joy83,HydroV2,11,Sun Oct 19 15:29:48 2014 UTC,"Thank you! With the right gear and skill sets you can paddle in almost any conditions. When its super cold (have been out in -20's) I wear a base layer of polypropylene long underwear, wet-suit, warm splash pants, kayak skirt dry top, 5mm neoprene gloves, hat, and a bandanna around my face to cut wind chill. I bring a spare change of cloths and a towel in a dry bag in one of the hatches. If I flip I can do an  eskimo roll to immedietly right myself and the dry top and skirt would keep me mostly dry. I also know the rivers I'm paddling in and know where I can get out to easily get help if need be. I keep my phone in a lifeproof case which keeps it dry so I have that for emergencies. As well as a whistle attached to my PFD.   edit: also carry a multi-tool, lighter, and small first aid kit (for longer trips) and an extra paddle."

winterporn,2injuf,onlysame1,4,Wed Oct 8 12:20:36 2014 UTC,Do you know where this is?
winterporn,2injuf,sexysoccerchick12,3,Wed Oct 8 17:20:00 2014 UTC,"It's definitely in the Cascade Range in Washington State. If it's truly sunset, this picture is taken looking north from south of Mount Rainier. Probably somewhere near the WA / OR border"
winterporn,2injuf,sexysoccerchick12,2,Wed Oct 8 21:55:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I thought it looked like the Cascades!"
winterporn,2injuf,thrillhou5,3,Thu Oct 9 00:27:44 2014 UTC,"Crap, lift is closed"

winterporn,2ig0xs,Nevlach,4,Mon Oct 6 13:17:42 2014 UTC,How common is snow in Scotland?
winterporn,2ig0xs,Yearlaren,2,Mon Oct 6 16:37:45 2014 UTC,"Depends where you are. In the mountains every year - it's already started snowing on the peaks. Generally in the valleys in the Highlands you can also guarantee it. In the lowlands and around the coast there is usually snow every year but it will melt at times. Snow in most of Britain away from the coast will happen every year, in fact this last winter was the first time in decades that it did not snow in most of Britain."
winterporn,2ig0xs,Ackenacre,3,Mon Oct 6 18:50:15 2014 UTC,Is that a bridge or an arch? ...or none? ...IS THIS REAL LIFE?
winterporn,2ig0xs,Gitanes,3,Mon Oct 6 18:40:02 2014 UTC,It's a bridge :)
winterporn,2ig0xs,Gitanes,3,Mon Oct 6 19:02:16 2014 UTC,Thank you so much!!! I might be able to sleep tonight.
winterporn,2ig0xs,GamerHaste,2,Mon Oct 6 19:08:45 2014 UTC,Such a relaxing picture. Awesome.
winterporn,2ig0xs,just2curiousBF,2,Mon Oct 6 18:56:03 2014 UTC,"shameless promotion for /r/scotlandporn, a sub that needs more love!"
winterporn,2ig0xs,Raerf,2,Tue Oct 7 02:26:45 2014 UTC,The bridge is near Carrbridge and was built in 1717.

winterporn,2ig0xs,ireadwithnolights,1 point,Tue Oct 7 11:18:30 2014 UTC,Can't wait for the snow instead of this pishy rain!
winterporn,2ig0xs,trivialcheese,-4,Tue Oct 7 18:50:04 2014 UTC,It would look better as a free country.
winterporn,2ig0xs,ireadwithnolights,5,Mon Oct 6 15:24:37 2014 UTC,"Just out of interest, where are you from?"
winterporn,2ig0xs,trivialcheese,-5,Mon Oct 6 16:51:47 2014 UTC,"Dallas, Texas."
winterporn,2ig0xs,ireadwithnolights,4,Mon Oct 6 17:01:59 2014 UTC,"So, outside of watching Braveheart, why do you think they should be independent?"
winterporn,2ig0xs,trivialcheese,-3,Mon Oct 6 18:50:53 2014 UTC,"2/3 of European oil, being recognizing as their own civil nation and being able to identify as a people that are not part pf a conglomerate. Why don't you want them to be free?"
winterporn,2ibba4,CronosDage,12,Sat Oct 4 23:02:36 2014 UTC,That looks Badass.
winterporn,2ibba4,davidjohnmeyer,4,Sun Oct 5 04:18:44 2014 UTC,This has got to be the most Canadian picture I have ever seen
winterporn,2ibba4,DMTMH,2,Sun Oct 5 18:52:07 2014 UTC,That looks freezing. Too freezing to actually be able to do anything?
winterporn,2i6x1n,JDMcomlent,1 point,Fri Oct 3 14:48:23 2014 UTC,"But but , How??"
winterporn,2i6x1n,hell911,2,Sat Oct 4 06:21:44 2014 UTC,"Dew collected on a leaf, froze, and then someone pulled it off for a photo. My guess, anyway."
winterporn,2i6x1n,fyrenwater,1 point,Sat Oct 4 08:48:42 2014 UTC,same as ice storm?
winterporn,2i6x1n,hell911,1 point,Sat Oct 4 16:30:38 2014 UTC,I live in California. I have no idea what kinds of ice storms there are nor how they differ.
winterporn,2i6x1n,fyrenwater,1 point,Sat Oct 4 17:38:51 2014 UTC,"oh. just search for toronto ice storm 2013, or new york ice storm in youtube or google (for images)"
winterporn,2i6x1n,hell911,1 point,Sat Oct 4 18:13:44 2014 UTC,"toronto ice storm 2013   http://i.imgur.com/XN9zIlk.gif  But yeah, the leaf in the OP seems too clear to have been from a storm. And judging by the wet pavement, and lack of snow or ice patches (as well as the ungloved hand), it may have been freezing dew or rain.  But I'm no expert. Maybe the path got salted. Maybe the hand owner is used to the cold. Maybe it was aliens!"

winterporn,2i30kt,tikki_rox,0,Thu Oct 2 21:49:34 2014 UTC,Eastern Canada?
winterporn,2hzg1u,onlysame1,2,Wed Oct 1 12:23:26 2014 UTC,Why is everything here low res? Like that's a really common trend in this sub.

winterporn,2hzg1u,Siiimo,1 point,Thu Oct 2 02:21:27 2014 UTC,This is a really old photo. I can see an old Bell phonebooth. It's somewhere in Canada.
winterporn,2hvsvz,onlysame1,7,Tue Sep 30 12:20:13 2014 UTC,"Nice photo, but does it really classify as a cabin?"
winterporn,2hvsvz,FortCollinsEnt,6,Tue Sep 30 14:26:49 2014 UTC,"No, it's a chalet."
winterporn,2hvsvz,pinesap,2,Tue Sep 30 15:08:38 2014 UTC,Location?
winterporn,2hvsvz,Gingerbreadmancan,1 point,Tue Sep 30 14:11:25 2014 UTC,Apparently Ontario.

winterporn,2hsdkx,mightymushroom45,9,Mon Sep 29 17:45:33 2014 UTC,I'm having trouble finding a sense of scale in this picture.
winterporn,2hsdkx,Strayl1ght,3,Tue Sep 30 07:17:52 2014 UTC,"I agree. It looks like a picture of a cloud taken from an airplane, I don't understand how it's a street lamp at all. If only there were a banana for scale."
winterporn,2hsdkx,LRGinCharge,4,Tue Sep 30 18:23:11 2014 UTC,I can't help but think of The Last Airbender. Looks just like what Aang was trapped in. Great picture.
winterporn,2hsdkx,flowerling,4,Mon Sep 29 17:39:41 2014 UTC,Looks like a distant explosion..maybe volcano.
winterporn,2hsdkx,bobdolebobdole,3,Mon Sep 29 17:57:02 2014 UTC,If you squint it looks like an old version of bowser.
winterporn,2hsdkx,MJoubes,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:22:21 2014 UTC,What is the building in the background? It kind of looks like the turrets from the Hoth scene in Star Wars.
