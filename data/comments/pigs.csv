pigs,3bw6me,Tiredandcranky21,3,Thu Jul 2 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"I've said it before on this issue, it's not going to change until the sponsors make it change. It doesn't matter how many random petitions they get from how many people all over the world it is money that speaks. Call the organizers and the sponsors. Make sure you let them know that your money won't be spent in places and on products that support this kind of behavior. That is when change will happen.   Also PETA slaughters animals for no reason and claims to have saved them. They have picked up dogs from people's yards (dogs that were loved household companions) and killed them. PETA's message, in this case comes from a good place, but most of their agenda is extremist and abhorrent. They are no longer animal advocates, they are political extremists trying to stay relevant and continue making money.They spend less than 1% of their multi million dollars on donations they receive to actually help animals."
pigs,3bw6me,goblinish,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:29:03 2015 UTC,Actually someone offered to subsidize an alternative in Whitley County and they turned down the money  Here you go https://www.change.org/p/whitley-county-4h-fair-please-cancel-all-future-pig-wrestling-events
pigs,3bw6me,goblinish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they turn down the money? They are getting sponsorship money, attendance money, and entrance fees without making a change. Making the change means standing down on their opinions and that's not goign to happen until real pressure happens, like I said. Sponsors pulling from the even completely, people not going, and participants goign elsewhere.   If the sponsors are pressured into pulling support for the event, they won't have the funds to create an event that is worth while to attend. Without attendants there is no reason for participants to be there. It's a domino effect that starts by pressuring sponsors into not supporting events that put an animal's welfare in danger.   It has to be more than just ""hey we'll replace the event"". There is no real monetary pressure that way. They aren't losing anything by not caving to people they don't see as important."

pigs,3bosvc,wec,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"they drink a lot of water when eating dry foods (we feed ours mini-pig kibble 3x day, and small veggie snacks in between). He drinks huge amounts when eating the dry food, but rarely otherwise. Our two best techniques for extra water are:   use very watered down fruit juice to make ice cube popsicles with 1 small piece of fruit inside. They like to chew ice   have him stand in the hose stream of water; doesn't like to have water sprayed at him, but will take little sips from the hose (and they like to pee in streams of moving water, so good trick to stimulate a fast pee if you need)    Please don't feed them Starburst though - that shit's not even good for humans! Fruit is best (and we brush our pigs teeth, which they will tolerate if you are careful - a pig can take a finger if he wants....)"
pigs,3bosvc,Jud_Turner,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"I timed him peeing once, and was astounded... he peed for more than 2:30! Would never have believed it if I hadn't seen him do this (he was 1.5 years old, is now almost 3 and does not pee this long anymore - more regulated...)"

We have a pretty stringent routine that you can set a clock by."
pigs,3b931u,hank_hiIl,4,Fri Jun 26 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"I feel horrible for this pig, because it certainly isn't his fault. It is, however, the fault of the owners. When you decide to ignore local laws regarding pets you run the risk of losing them either to the city, or worse because you can't find a vet who can legally care for your pet. This is completely irresponsible ownership by the owners.  I am all for legalizing pigs in more areas and allowing them to be classified as pets, not just livestock, however the way to go about that is not disregarding the rules before tackling the issue appropriately."
pigs,3b931u,goblinish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:51:47 2015 UTC,What is the way to go about it in your opinion?
pigs,3b931u,morbidhyena,3,Sat Jun 27 08:09:46 2015 UTC,"Usually finding out what the restriction are in your area to begin with is a good start, then going through appropriate channels to change those restrictions. That will take different methods in different situations. If it is a town or city ordinance it could just be a matter of showing up at the correct town hall type meeting with information supporting you cause. Or it could be gathering your information and getting enough supporters to your cause to get your local laws changed.  Both require legwork, dutiful research and reasonable arguments that can sway those you need to change the restrictions.  It is absolutely possible to happen, but isn't an over night thing. However, part of responsible pet ownership is that you first check that you can keep your new pet before bringing them home."
pigs,3b931u,goblinish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"The thing about changing laws is it is easier to change them if you are an unfair victim of the law with a wave of public support than it is if you are just a geek reading up about a law that could theoretically harm you if you decided to break it.  It's always better to say you're sorry than to ask permission. Asking permission legitimizes the law and makes it super easy for a bureaucrat to just say no. Saying ""sorry, but now you should change the law cause I'm not getting rid of the pig I love"" in front of the cameras shifts the advantage to you."
pigs,3b931u,TrotBot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:37:57 2015 UTC,And then the police come and give you the option of going to jail or surrendering your animal. Getting a permit for your animal is more reasonable if you can't change the law. I'm sorry but it simply is not responsible to have an animal where you can't legally have one. An animal should not be the victim of someone protesting a law.
pigs,3b931u,goblinish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying this is the only way the law changes. If you want to make the argument they should have looked into the law and not bought a pig, fine, but don't pretend that would have been a path to changing the law."
pigs,3b931u,TrotBot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is a path to changing laws and restrictions. I am goign through the process of getting a pig as a service animal and am doing it legally through my local council and government. Pigs are classified as livestock where I am, but I am in the process of getting an exemption for that.  My exemption will then pave the way for pet pigs to be considered legally in my area."
pigs,3b931u,goblinish,0,Sat Jun 27 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"Service animals are a whole other question. You have your sob story. Someone who doesn't need a service animal would only have a sob story if they get the animal first and then there's the ""heartbreak"" of it being taken away.  For most people the gray bureaucrat does not care and does not budge."
pigs,3b931u,TrotBot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"Again that is the owners choice. The laws absolutely CAN be changed without breaking them and lashing out. Doing it that way just makes the animals collateral damage and I'm sorry but that is irresponsible and awful to use an animal that way. I don't use a ""sob story"" I use facts in my arguments and discussions to change the state of the situation.  You are not required to ever have an animal. they benefit us and are great companions, yes, but by having a pet you have a responsibility to offer it care, housing, and vetenary attention. If the animal is illegal in your area, or evensimply against th erules of your housing, you are not able to reasonably provide for the animal. It is the animal that pays the price when it is taken away and often destroyed because it's owners wanted to disregard rules that they thought didn't apply to them. It is selfish and ridiculous. You don't have to break the law to change it, and if you do decide to go that route you need to be ready and able to face the ramifications of being caught."
pigs,3b931u,goblinish,0,Sat Jun 27 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"There is no evidence that these people knew in advance. But what I'm getting at is that you have a naive trust in the political system which flies in the face of all the facts. Bureaucrats love telling people what to do for absolutely no reason at all. There is no justification for believing that they can be rationally reasoned with.  A passionate appeal based on sympathy for your need of a service animal, or based on widespread public sympathy with a pet family threatened with being broken up, those are things that can override the dickishness of politicians.  But never forget who these people really are at heart."
pigs,3b931u,TrotBot,4,Sat Jun 27 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Most places probably don't allow pigs in residential zones because they are considered livestock. While I'd love to have a pet pig it's probably a good thing to not encourage this kind of pet ownership. Too many people are taken by scammers already with tales of ""mini"" pigs.   I've looked into mini pigs before. They don't exist. The only way you get a small pig is by finding a breeder that has bread pigs for size for generations. Expect to pay thousands for one."

I tend to comment as an exaggeration of what's out there because I don't think people should be getting the idea that it's something you can just go and do like adopting a dog. The right approach is what you have there (finding a breeder, visiting the farm, etc.)  You're lucky you have decent costs there. Everytime I've looked in canada it's usually around $1250 before shipping and other costs."
pigs,3b931u,Tramd,2,Sat Jun 27 20:09:12 2015 UTC,Size is very much an issue for people who buy a piglet expecting it to stay that size. Then it gets big and fat and they don't want it any more. That's how they end up as rescues.   The main issue to ownership though is that they're livestock. Can't have those in residential zones.

There's a lot of info on the web about this, but basically: - they are all the same general breed, but the breeders make up names like Juliana and Royal Dandy and claim they will stay small. They don't - pigs don't get full-sized until they are 3 years old, but can breed at 1, so the breeder can show you a baby pig's parents, and say ""see how small they are at full-size"" - there's a huge problem with people abandoning pigs for growing to full size because they aren't cute anymore (they are, just not small-cute anymore) Please don't get one unless you are prepared to house a 200 pound pig for it's lifespan of 14-20 years. They are great pets, but only if you are prepared."

I have met adult, full grown pigs who are smaller, but never under 50 pounds. You need to read research, talk to breeders, talk to people who own pigs and are willing to be honest.

pigs,39y5w5,dannymac1784,6,Mon Jun 15 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on the age - that guy looks to be a bit older, but he's a great looking little pig.  We have only had one pig so I can't speak with any more authority then that: but after 2.5 years with our little guy here's what I can suggest.  On the up side: He's really hands off and self maintaining. He pee'ed in the house one time when he was still a baby. But, after a stern 'NO!' and an escorted trip out to the backyard he immediately understood, and has never repeated the deed again. We now keep a bell on the back door and he knows to ring it when he wants to go. He also only really goes to the bathroom once per day - and on cold or rainy days he might just choose to skip it altogether.  He lives to be on a regular schedule:    1/2 cup of pellets at 7 AM every morning (sometimes he does enjoy sleeping in on this one.)  Half a bag of salad at 2 PM. A few treats (about 8 pieces - we use shredded mini-wheat cereal - low calorie/salt/sugar high fiber) at about 4:30.  A busy ball with a 1/4 cup of pellets at 7 PM.  Dinner at 8 with another 1/2 cup of pellets.    After that he usually takes about 30 minutes to hit the sack - which he does on his own.  Rinse and repeat every day - and your all set. Yours is probably flexible enough to let you set whatever schedule you like - we picked the one we use just because it worked for us.  He's affectionate, loves playing with people, very smart and totally mugs it up for guests. He can also deal with down time really well - if you don't want him in your face, he's more than happy to hop on his bed and relax.  Things to watch out for:  Show them affection, and play with them liberally, but do not let them get away with anything or give them any hint that they can bully you. Unless you keep them in check they will start biting, or breaking things (see below).   They are really strong - and although they are only about the size of a medium dog they are dense. If they step on your bare foot and put weight on it you will know it. Once our little guy wondered into one of our bathrooms, and got wedged in between the toilet and a wall - at that point he panicked and fought with the situation until he knocked the commode out of the bolts that attach it to the floor. So yeah...  That brings me to doors:  The little guy is smart, really smart, and he loves to find anything in the house that he can manipulate. Doors and door-stops are a huge source of entertainment for him. That said, on more then a few occasions he has locked himself in the laundry room, or a bathroom. When this happens he can be calm for a bit, but pretty soon he will get stressed and all hell will break loose - if left in there long enough he could destroy the door to break out. We have learned to keep any door in the house that locks him out of the main living area closed - especially doors that leave him in small / enclosed spaces.  Things that I have learned:   Every winter he grows out a big coat of bristly fur which drops over the course of a week or two in the spring time.  He makes every noise from low grunts to high pitched peeps. (Which is hilarious!) He loves interaction and especially enjoys it when you get down to his level for a little bit of play time. Looking at the day-to-day of living with him, he really only requires the maintenance of a cat, but brings the personality and affection that you would normally only get from a dog. Over the years he's gotten nothing but more mellow and loving - and easier to handle. It just took him some time to figure out his place in the world. Find a good vet and boarding location if you want to go on vacation. We are still not comfortable leaving him alone in the house with a pet sitter - he needs more attention then that. The occasional treat is good - every few months we will treat him to an oven cooked Yam - at which point he goes nuts.   He's been a very smart, and moody pet, who we can't imagine not having around. He is also super-affectionate, and easy to train - if he has a problem letting you get near his face, teach him that if he lets you grab his cheeks and give him a kiss on the snout, then he will get a treat and he will follow you around asking for kisses all day long.  Just stick with him/her and you won't regret it! Good luck and feel free to post any more questions you have back here."

pigs,39y5w5,Merek919,2,Mon Jun 15 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"My vet recommended this to me and I highly recommend it since.    http://www.mazuri.com/mazuriminipigelder25lb-5z92.aspx  always use elder pig pellets for a pet pig.    The youth pellets are designed for ""plumping"" a yound pig up and aren't appropriate for a healthy pet  pig and ""active adult"" is PC for a breeding pig.    Elder pellets are balanced and lower calorie (pigs love to eat for the sake of eating) and will help you keep from having a ""blimp"" pig for a pet.  At least, that's how it was explained to me.  It has done very well for our pet, is delivered online and default shipping is reasonably quick (about four days for us on a main shipping hub, it comes very quickly) and cheap (a few bucks) .  It's really handy since I haven't found a specialty food shop that caters to piggies in our area."

pigs,3545zq,goltoof,6,Wed May 6 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"Kune Kune pigs have a reputation for being docile and friendly. They're also on the small side but can be bigger depending on various factors. Vietnamese potbellies are small as well but a bit stubborn.   Since your area has some shade even pink ones would be okay. Usually the lighter pigs need sunscreen when they go out or they get sunburned! :(  An ideal space for a pig is probably half an acre or even more. A space three times the size of your average suburban backyard is a good minimum and even then a pig can get very restless. They are curious animals who love to explore. This includes your house.   Pigs are much smarter than dogs and cats and potty training them is definitely possible!  The books I've read on keeping pigs as pets usually recommend special made pig feed for the majority of a pig's diet, but pigs can eat most other things. They do eat a lot though. :)  This book has a lot of useful basic information. My only problem is that it can be a bit UK centric. The section on breeds is great!"
pigs,3545zq,SkyMuffin,3,Thu May 7 01:10:39 2015 UTC,"Pigs aren't inherently ""athletic."" I have a Kune and a potbelly and neither are particularly interested in going on walks. I tried with the Kune when she was little and basically had to drag her the whole way (she wanted to stop and smell/eat every step). My potbelly was older when i got her and won't even consider a harness. If you're looking for something to get excited to see you when you get home, cuddle up in your lap, and go on long walks with you, you might consider a dog."
pigs,3545zq,care99bare,1 point,Thu May 7 19:37:34 2015 UTC,I have a Juliana pig named Lilikoi Liliuokalani Victoria (pics can be googled by her name) who is highly athletic. She keeps up on 4 mile mountain hikes. House trained and likes to cuddle when she sleeps but not otherwise particularly physically affectionate.  Projected to weigh 60 pounds when fully grown. Now about 30 pounds at 6 months.
pigs,3545zq,American_Pig,1 point,Sat May 9 06:20:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, the designer Juliana strikes again...  The smallest pigs bred are the Göttinger, a laboratory pig. The minimum weight achieved in healthy pigs was about 77lbs at 2yo (with most around 90lbs on a restricted diet), and all pigs need 5-6 years to finish growing. Don't look at the weight, look at the measurements. A small pig is 3.5ft long and about 18in tall, even if it does not look it, its ideal weight is 100-300lbs. Give 15% protein diets in those growing years, and then you can have a pig on the thin side (70-100lbs) if healthfully possible."
pigs,3545zq,HeelsDownEyesUp,1 point,Wed May 27 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"Things to know:  Lifespan. Pigs normally live 10-15 years, many over 20.  NEUTER and SPAY that sucker!! They can be very aggressive and irritable if not. Do it when they are still small, around 40lbs.  It is SUPER easy to keep a pig if you have about... 20x20ft of grassy, untouched yard space. As they grow, they need a bit of a boost for protein. Piglets need at least 15% protein in their diets to support healthy growth, if you do not have grass, things can get a bit tricky to provide enough roughage for them. Again, super easy to have if you've a decent grass place available. Kunes naturally graze more than the other breeds. It's the healthiest way to keep them, and if the grass grows well you won't have to feed much to adults.  Beware ""restricted metabolism"" formulas if you go for pig feed. It may result in a smaller pig by about 30lbs and 1-5inch all around, but produce serious health issues later.  Pigs are dense. The ideal weight is in the 100-300lb range, and the pig may look big or not. Potbellies (any non-meat pig besides the Kune Kune) will have the smallest skeletons, and the most fat to muscle. They have large bellies and usually straight backs. Plump guys. The middle ground is the Kune, which evenly distributes fat and muscle on a bit of a longer skeleton. My advice, go for the Kune Kunes, and ignore any teacup/Juliana/Micro breeder, or anyone breeding pet pigs under 5yo.  Taller/leaner Kunes can swim, potbellies and stouter ones cannot. I would really worry about the pool... they tend to stay out of deep water.  Cleaning is easy. Pigs usually pick a corner to poop in, and that's that. You can stick a litter box there or scoop it and trash it like a dog's."
pigs,3545zq,HeelsDownEyesUp,0,Wed May 27 05:32:14 2015 UTC,"I can't answer the breed question. Mine was black with a white diamond on his forehead and he was great.   Poo, He had a cage he slept in at night (protection from coyotes). I shoveled shit out of it into the woods. During the day he would free-roam.   Size is entirely up to how much you feed him. They have a limitless appetite so you must control the intake. If you have grass, nuts or berries they graze on this naturally so you will have to watch this and adjust servings.   Get a large harness to get your pig accustomed to walks.   Also, a mud hole works as well as a pool, but a pool is better for the yard. Get one of those kiddie pools."
pigs,3545zq,B32DB08170,6,Thu May 7 05:22:14 2015 UTC,Just want to be sure you mean size as in weight. Pigs are mammals and like people they have a size they will reach in adulthood determined genetically and you don't want to try to starve/malnourish then to try to keep them from growing.
pigs,3545zq,hysilvinia,1 point,Thu May 7 11:51:05 2015 UTC,"Coffee and cigarettes, however, has been shown to stunt growth."
pigs,3545zq,Chapstick_Man,7,Thu May 7 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"Please be careful saying this line   Size is entirely up to how much you feed him. They have a limitless appetite so you must control the intake. If you have grass, nuts or berries they graze on this naturally so you will have to watch this and adjust servings.    A pig will grow based on it's genetic predisposition. Yes limiting food intake can stunt their growth, but it can also cause serious health problems. Please don't advocate starving pigs to maintain a small size. All pig diets should be discussed with your vet to determine the appropriate weight and food portions for your pig. There is as much danger in underfeeding your pig as there is in over feeding them.   Saying size is only related to how much you feed them is how many breeders of so called ""tea cup"" pigs are staying in business.  Instead of suggesting that their pig was genetically meant to be larger when someone complains about their pet's size they use the argument that the owner did not limit the food enough to prevent growth. It is a disgusting practice that leads to underfed malnourished pigs for the sake of keeping them small."
pigs,3545zq,goblinish,2,Thu May 7 15:11:45 2015 UTC,I meant more along the lines of them being able to eat and pack on fat with little to no limits. I overfed mine if anything. He was 300 lbs at his largest
pigs,3545zq,B32DB08170,2,Thu May 7 20:40:21 2015 UTC,I was hoping that was what you meant. It's just a phrase to be very careful about. Unfortunately there are people who tilt think it is fine to starve a pig to keep it small and a comment like yours without being explained could be taken as agreeing to that practise. Every one understands starving an animal is bad until comes to pigs unfortunately. Then maintaining a small size becomes more important than the animal's health.
pigs,350ja7,eminlalaland,8,Wed May 6 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"Contact your breeder immediately.  How old?    Check out the page Just Mini Pigs on Facebook.  Even if it's not mini there should be someone to help you.  Be prepared to answer loads of questions.    State the age, breeder, area you're in, and what issues you're having.    Not eating for 24 hours is deadly and if formula must be offered you may have received him too young."
pigs,350ja7,snakeoil-huckster,3,Wed May 6 02:41:24 2015 UTC,That's what I'm scared of that we got him too young. He isn't acting sick and he is active but just not eating. Thanks for the help
pigs,350ja7,snakeoil-huckster,3,Wed May 6 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"Seriously, hit that group up.  It's the only pig page I subscribed to.  There are a few vets and tons of breeders that will help you out the best they can.  In the meantime, try soaking the pellets on water.  If you have anything sweet smelling such as berries/melon/baby food put it on top to try and entice.    No food for 24 hours can be fatal.  Loss of appetite is one of the first signs of illness in a pig.  Also, they should not be separated from their mom's until at LEAST 6 weeks.  8 weeks is the most common age solid breeders release them at.    Hope he pulls through okay and get him to the vet immediately."

pigs,34llc8,Dituni,7,Sat May 2 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"Animals prefer spending as little energy as possible to get the highest nutritional value possible. That is why even top predators tend to prefer finding young, sick, or injured members of prey species over having to actually hunt an adult healthy animal. Pigs are the same way. yes pigs can eat meat, however unless the pig is wild, very territorial, has been exposed to human meat specifically, and is very very hungry there is no reason to worry. Pigs are more omnivorous and can get their nutrition by foraging for plants and bugs that come up with the food so there is no reason for them to chase down and hunt a person.  The chances of a wild, territorial (that part is normal) pig or boar that has been fed human meant (now we are getting into the unlikely part of the equation) that is seriously hungry and doesn't know how to survive by foraging is not just minute but ridiculously minute to the point of being virtually impossible.   There was a point where pig farmers could make a little extra cash by disposing of dead bodies, but in the last 100 years I would be willing to place money on the fact that those pigs are long gone."

As the other poster said, they can breed before they are fully grown (1 year), so the parents may be 40 pounds in fact, but may also not yet but fully mature (3 years). Our pig is 2.5 years and 100 pounds (and was 40 pounds at 1+ year, 10 pounds at 3 months). Not a problem if you know this is a certainty - they are great pets!"

If you have those to start you will be ok. Other things you will need to look in to is having a vet that will be able to provide care for your pig, hoof trimming (do it yourself or have someone else do it), and of course a camera to take hundreds of pictures and videos of the new baby."

pigs,33j0dl,ApeOver,11,Wed Apr 22 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"Pigs are fairly easy to house train. The hard part comes into pig proofing your house. Going to the bathroom outside is easy especially when compared to, ""don't chew on the walls"" ""don't tear up the carpet"" ""don't open every cabinet and fridge looking for food"" ""Hey goofball stop hogging the couch"" Pigs are incredibly smart. They need a lot of attention and enrichment.  If they don't have their mental needs met going to the bathroom outside could be the least of your worries. However, if you have the time and energy to give them they are AWESOME pets that can surprise you every day with their intelligence and affection."
pigs,33j0dl,goblinish,2,Thu Apr 23 04:19:29 2015 UTC,How would I take care of their mental needs outside of fetch?
pigs,33j0dl,goblinish,4,Thu Apr 23 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"There are lots of ways to keep an animal mentally stimulated. Training and teaching tricks is a great way to keep them busy and bond with them. Puzzles and toys that they have to work for food are also a great source of stimulation. They also need somewhere to root around either in your yard or a special box filled with dirt, small round rocks, and a few treats like veggies they can dig up.   When training a pig consistency is key. They are very intelligent, if they think you might waiver on a rule or request they will try periodically to test your resolve. Once you give in you're fighting a losing battle as they can be stubborn once they figure out how to get what they want. The good news is they are highly food motivated. You can get a pig to do just about anything a dog can, and then some, simply by being consistent and offered food rewards.  Fetch is a fun game, but they aren't quite as instinctively obsessed with it as a cat or dog would be chasing a ball. Pigs aren't natural hunters so while they will have fun it's not going to satiate their instincts like it does for a cat or dog. Hunters love fetch because it gives them something to quite literally hunt down which is why it is a pretty universal game for dog owners (and cat owners to a point). Pigs will have a blast chasing a ball around and can definitely be taught to play fetch, but for them it is more about simple play, which is great, but you still need to address instincts like digging and such."

pigs,331vgn,NavalNaval,9,Sat Apr 18 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Well first off what do you mean by an ""appropriate sized pig?"". There are a lot of breeders out there that claim to have teeny tiny ""micro pigs"" or ""teacup pigs"". They are attempting to convince you that if you buy one of their super special pigs it will never get bigger than a chihuahua. That's just a blatant lie. So many rescues and shelters are filled with pigs that owners had to get rid of once they cleared 100+ pounds thinking they were getting a tiny pig. Please don't fall into that trap  Pigs continue to grow for 3 years. It is common practice for breeders like that to breed their pigs too young (they can start breeding at about 1 year) so the parents look like they are super small full grown pigs to convince people that is the biggest the babies will get.   My advice would be to check out some local rescue groups and see if you can't meet some of the pigs they have available. That way you can see first hand what you are getting into. They are fantastic animals and a great joy to be around. With the right enrichment and activities you don't need a ton of space for a pig, but you will have to keep them very occupied as they are incredibly smart so will get bored (and destructive) if not given enough stimulation.   Keep in mind the pig you get as a pet is unlikely to get as large as a full grown farm pig. Those pigs are fed special diets to make them grow fast and huge, but don't be surprised with a pet pig that clears 100 pounds."
pigs,331vgn,goblinish,3,Sun Apr 19 02:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yes the above poster is 100% correct. Even ""mini"" pig get to a good size. My razorback pot belly is 175 pounds. And one a side note two pieces of advice I'll give you is to do endless research, because that are a higher upkeep pet than others pets. They need a lot of love and can be have territorial, both of their area and of you. My father in law had a pot belly named Rooter that claimed my mother in law and would not let him near her. My second thing is this, people are always going to ask if you are going to eat it. Not matter how many times you tell them that he/she is a pet. You just have to deal with it, sadly people just don't understand pig love. But if you do get one, and train it correctly. They are just wonderful, honestly if I had the time/money/space I would have 100. Mini pig rock!"
pigs,331vgn,Masurai1987,2,Mon Apr 20 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are small, hobby farmers who raises two or three pigs per year for meat.  We have taken in three pairs of pot belly pigs over the past 18 months from people who bought them because they were super cute as piglets but turned into very large pigs.  The first pair were over 350 lbs each and had been put into a stall in a horse barn and never let out again.  The second were smaller but still over 200 lbs and came from a public barn (like a petting zoo but a barn near the city.)  This spring we took in a pair that were over 300 lbs each because the person who owned them had to sell their farm and couldn't take them with them.  Pot belly pigs, like all pigs, are large animals which have been bred for meat.  They are smart, friendly, absolutely lovely animals but they are livestock.  If you are going to get pigs I recommend that you go into it with your eyes WIDE open.  Pigs are farm animals.  You can keep them as pets and they are great animals but they will get big, or very big.  You need to have an end of life plan.  We love our pigs and take very good care of them but we are farmers.  In addition to the pot bellies we have had Large Blacks, Herefords, Berkshires, and York-Tams.  Our Large Blacks finished over 400 lbs each."

If you scratch there, do they flake off or are they more stuck?  My first guess would be dry skin, in all honesty.  Pigs aren't particularly prone to a majority of parasites found on dogs and cats, mostly mites and things that bother us, like mosquitos and biting flies. If it was mites the skin would be irritated and the hair would probably be thinner in that area.  It could be lice/eggs, but they don't really seem large enough or spread out enough."

pigs,314gz4,Dezzylou142,5,Wed Apr 1 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"If you have your heart set on a kune kune from a breeder here is a list of registered breeders (there are 5 listed in Oregon). I've never contacted them so I have no idea the quality, price, or services of any of the breeders on the list.   Please also consider adoption here is a start to finding a pig for your companion that desperately needs a loving home. SO many people get pigs thinking they will be miniature (Not accusing you of this to be clear) and abandon or drop their pigs off at a local humane society that is ill-equiped to handle a pig. The only thing these pigs have done wrong is grow bigger than their owners thought they would be.   As for zoning you will want to check you state, as well as your city (or township or County) for any legal issues you may encounter. Even if an animal is legal in the state some places it depends on where you are even within a city for whether or not you can have a pig. Many areas still consider even pet pigs as livestock so check, double check, and triple check all of your local government sources.    While you are doing that you will want to find a vet that is able to treat your pig. Please have a vet's number and location handy prior to bringing home your pet.  From a breeder or a shelter take the pig to the vet for a wellness check. This will help establish a baseline for further observations of your new pet (keeping track of weight gain, growth, and any particular irregularities your particular pig may have) as well as give you peace of mind your pig is healthy as it settles into your life. Remember not all pet vets will see (even pet) pigs and not all farm vets are willing to treat pet pigs (though that is slightly more rare than the first)  either so make sure you do your homework and contact the office to make sure."

pigs,30k838,LooksAtClouds,3,Sat Mar 28 02:18:48 2015 UTC,Have it registered as a emotional support animal or service animal.
pigs,30k838,NinjaNymph,4,Sat Mar 28 05:48:18 2015 UTC,There is likely no help that can be given. If it's anything like here pigs are deemed agricultural animals and you cannot house them in residential zoning. You're looking at finding someone to help facilitate changing the  law. I wonder if even trying to have the animal declared a service animal would work because it's considered agriculture.
pigs,30k838,Tramd,1 point,Sat Mar 28 07:22:00 2015 UTC,"By definition under the American Disabilities Act, a service animal can only be a dog or a miniature horse (only as guide animals for the blind)"

At this point, Üter has his ears on full alert and as soon as I open the door he takes off to the barn making his soft ""Norff Norff"" (""I'm happy to see you!"") grunts, and by the time I catch up he and his mom are standing side by side just bein' affectionate pigs."

pigs,2zrgso,MikeyDeez,2,Sat Mar 21 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. Our older pig (who died a couple of years ago at age 22) absolutely freaked out over: white tennis shoes, anything that smelled like chlorine swimming pool, and the other pig if we had bathed her.  She hid from white tennis shoes, grunted at chlorine, and attacked other pig.    I think it's totally about the scents your pig is perceiving and how he makes sense of them (no pun intended - ok, maybe just a little one). Is he OK if your girlfriend wears the pants? Or have you laundered the pants recently with a new detergent? Or did your girlfriend wear them around a dog/cat and now your pig is smelling the dog/cat?"
pigs,2zrgso,LooksAtClouds,2,Sat Mar 21 04:16:48 2015 UTC,"That's our question! We're going to wash them and have her wear them, and see if me wearing them clean has the same effect. He's been naturally stand off-ish around her, gradually warming up since she moved in but it would be funny if her pants have been exacerbating things.  My girlfriend does have a little cat that moved in as well, but he and the cat are already buddies."
pigs,2zrgso,LooksAtClouds,3,Sat Mar 21 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"Update here later & let us know what the answer was.  Also, we never quite figured out why our pig did not like white tennis shoes walking past her. Perhaps it looks like a flash of white tusks?  She also completely, completely went crazy once when we took our motorhome to Ohio and woke up to a light snowfall on the ground. She couldn't figure out the ground being white. We had to carry her (oof) outside & clear off a spot for her to use as a bathroom.  Just writing all this about her makes me miss her so much. She was a smart and companionable animal."

pigs,2zi0ok,skydiving25,4,Wed Mar 18 19:16:43 2015 UTC,"My pig is indoors with outside play time daily.  During the winter she would only go out to potty and would come right back in.  We have an attached garage that is her playroom.  Her toys toys and root box are in there so that's where she spends a lot of her time.  She was challenging when we first got her.  She was slightly distructive (some wall damage) and we quickly baby proofed everything. She caught on to litter training pretty fast and took cues from the dogs on when to go outside.  Her curiosity knows no bounds.  She gets into anything that is locked shut and throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way.  Right now she is trying to get into a locked cabinet in the bathroom.  Why?  Because she can't have whatever is in there.    She's extremely intelligent, and dare I say, pig headed.  She's like having a cross between a dog and a toddler.  She's cranky if she doesn't get her afternoon nap and goes to bed earlier if she's been running around all day.  She loves to snuggle and demands attention.   If she is not being catered to she let's you know (her screaming fits are legendary).  But nothing is better than when she curls up next to you and falls asleep or when she plops over when she sees her fork (seriously, Google forking a pig).  We have a little over an acre and she uses all of it.  Not saying you have to have a huge yard, but they should have a designated area they can dig and run around in.   The hardest parts of owning a pig is finding a reputable breeder and vet that can care for them.  Supplies are easily found at feed stores or online.  Heck, I wasted hundreds of dollars buying toys and supplies she never touched.  Her favorite things are an old sleeping bag to nest in and empty peanut butter jars she has to unscrew to get her treats.  They are awesome creatures with distinct attitudes.   She loves to show off, but is still shy.  She'll do anything for a piece of cheese but refuses to eat a banana.    Check out Ross Mill Farm online to see if a pig is right for you and your family.    Also, there is no such thing as a teacup or micro pig.  Expect a mini pot/Julian to get around 60 - 70 pounds when they stop growing (when they're around 3 years old).  Standard pots can get up to 150 - 250 ponds.  Unless you have a farm there is no reason for a common hog, whoae weight can push over 1000 pounds.  Do your research and think long and hard.  It's a huge commitment,  but totally worth it.  Edit:  I expanded the weight descriptions of breeds.  I took OPs question to ask about mini pot or Julian because of their size compared to others."
pigs,2zi0ok,snakeoil-huckster,2,Thu Mar 19 14:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, nailed it. Except for the weight thing. 60-70 lbs sounds underfed.  Most difficult time I have with my pig is finding a pet sitter when I leave town."

pigs,2zi0ok,ZeldaThePiglet,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"And they can get north of 60-70 pounds too - up to 150. You cannot know how big they will get without seeing both parents full grown. A big old 400 pound farm hog and a 80-pound potbelly are about the same size at birth. Go to a reputable breeder, do your homework. Do NOT buy from the ""Best little pigs in Texas"" Lady."

pigs,2zi0ok,snakeoil-huckster,2,Fri Mar 20 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"It's very easy.  I'll focus on pots for this example.  Pigs are sexually mature at a very young age, around three months.  The pigs weigh around 10 - 15 pounds at this age. Poor breeders and money grabbers will breed these babies and then show you the mom and say ""look, she's only 15 pounds.  She's the mom, see how tiny!""  But what people don't realize is the mom is a baby herself.    This cycle repeats and repeats because new owners don't always do the research they should.  These breeders prey on people who are buying out of impulse and have a case of Awethatscute."

pigs,2xqi9g,goblinish,4,Wed Mar 4 14:02:03 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you will love him regardless. A lot of people get what they think will be a micro pig and then abandon them when they get too large. Your pet may very well be larger than 40 pounds especially with a proper diet. Please make sure you do regular check ups at a vet and discuss nutritional needs for your animal with them. A lot of breeders (even licensed ones) will tell their new buyers to only feed a very small amount of food to their pets to ensure the animal stays within a specific weight range. This leads to not just small animals, but health problems as well (just as any method of growth stunting will). I'm glad Sammy has a good permanent home with someone willing to do the research and put in the time to ensure a healthy happy pig. He is very cute and I totally want to kiss his perfect little snout."
pigs,2xqi9g,gingerjuice,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"His snout is so perfectly kissable! Have no fear, Sammy has regular vet appointments and I make sure that he eats properly and exercises regularly. I need to ensure that the little snout is around to kiss for as long as possible :)"

If you don't want to eat pork, that's fine, but it's a little strange to throw this in people's face. Food chain, yo."

pigs,2xcyuf,Geolover420,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:14:54 2015 UTC,Yup and that's how the south reacted to getting rid of slavery. What get rid of our slaves? is that not a bit odd? It is there fate after all. God wills it.
pigs,2xcyuf,UrufuX,0,Tue Mar 3 03:40:58 2015 UTC,Are you seriously comparing slavery to eating pork...?
pigs,2xcyuf,Alexxandria,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:15:44 2015 UTC,Are you seriously saying it's that dissimilar? The same exact excuses are/were made in favor of continuing the cruelty in both cases. Look up the excuses made by the south in favor of keeping slavery going and tell me they can't be applied to the way we keep animals now. To be clear eating meat is not in itself bad the way in witch we get it and the massive amounts we eat in this age is the problem. Most people who eat meat have never killed an animal and never will that is just wrong. Essentially the next step that is equivalent to freeing the slaves is to shut down the massive factory farms and eating significantly less meat that is fairly hunted or raised in small groups with kindness and compassion before being killed and if you are going to eat meat you should have to kill that animal yourself. Humans have perverted the hell out of the circle of life.
pigs,2xcyuf,UrufuX,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"While you make a good point about factory farms, you seemed to have missed the point of my original comment. Then made yourself look like an idiot by comparing eating pork/having pigs as pets to slavery."
pigs,2xcyuf,Alexxandria,2,Tue Mar 3 21:27:45 2015 UTC,I don't see how I missed the point of your original post in fact if anything you miss the point of my reply to that post. My reply was directed at the part about it being strange to throw it in your face. If no one had said anything about slavery then it would still be a problem today if no one says anything about how we treat our livestock things won't change and will only get worse. To be honest this girl could have really thrown it in your face by showing images of were your pork comes from but she didn't. The way that this girl is trying to change perception is light fun and peacefuly effective. And for the record I have never said keeping pet pigs is bad in fact I am going to adopt one as soon as I have a job that will allow me to care for one (meaning no more 60-80 hour weeks) and a house that is zoned to allow pet pigs.

When you ""encourage"" your pig to go out the door, he will instinctively head for the cover provided by the lean-to. Give him a peanut for going into the lean-to (but NOT for going to the bathroom).

Then I made her area bigger and made sure she still used the litter box. I did this using a little puppy exercise pen.  I would suggest putting your piggy back into a smaller area until he gets in the habit of using the litter box.   Also, carpets are common potty accident spots. Be sure to clean messes thoroughly!!!   Also, also, my piggy did decide one day to move her pottying spot to a different corner of the room. It was risky, but I just placed the litter box in that corner and we haven't had any issues yet!  My inside piggy will be two in a few months! Everyday is an adventure.

pigs,2v1jlb,Jud_Turner,2,Sun Feb 8 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"indeed. I've timed my pig (2 years old) and he can pee for 2:30+. No joke. He drinks at least a gallon of water when eating kibble at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  when he was younger (3-9 months) there were some peeing problems (peeing in his indoor pen, and not in his designated litter box) but not since then - THE KEY was to shrink his pen when he peed inappropriately. At one point, it was only a bed and a litter box, and as he was better behaved, he regained his territory). He hasn't used his indoor litter box in a year, and can hold his pee for a very long time in order to go outside. Also has a bell to ring in his cage to let us know if he needs to go out (taught him this by ringing it before we put him out, and putting it where  he could hit it, and anytime he did, put him out. He learned very quickly what it was for.)"

pigs,2ui154,ZeldaThePiglet,3,Mon Feb 2 08:56:31 2015 UTC,"Adorable pig! He looks like he leads a fun life (or she?). If you don't mind me asking, would you recommend a pig as a pet? There are a lot of variables I'm unfamiliar with.    How big will Zelda be when grown? How often are baths given? Is there ""pig food""? Sleeping habits?   I wouldn't want to consider owning a pig until I learned more, as I would want to be a good of an caretaker as possible."
pigs,2ui154,Sparkeys,5,Mon Feb 2 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Since she hasn't replied yet I thought I'd answer your questions.   Mini pots and Julians average between 60 to 80 pounds full grown.  They will be approximately 32 inches long and around 16-18 inches tall.  They grow until they are 3 years old.  Because they are able to breed at an extremely young age breeders can say that the parents are only 20 pounds because they are. They just don't mention that they are only 4 months old.  Baths are given as needed if at all.  My girl is 8 months old and has never had a true bath.  I do wipe her down with baby wipes as needed.  Pig food is readily availble.  There are several brands on the market and you can easily have it delivered to your house if you don't have a supply store nearby.  Fresh veggies and some fruits are given also.    They should sleep about 60% of the time.  My girl sleeps through the night and takes a nap if the afternoon.   If she doesn't get her nap in she is a total crank.  Pigs make amazing pets, but they come with their own requirements.   They are extremely intelligent and can become bored easily.  This can lead to destruction (my girl chewed on drywall and peeled wallpaper off).  You need to have the space to let them play.  A secure outdoor space is needed because they need to play outside daily as weather allows.  They are super easy to potty train.  My girl prefers to go outside and has litter pans in the house just in case. If you want more I found visit rossmillfarms.com.  They are an excellent source of information.   Honestly,  the hardest part about having a pig is finding a reputable breeder and vet. After that you get to spoil them to pieces.  I say she's like a cross between a dog and a 3 year old toddler.

pigs,2uj5cn,BudGreen_Cali,4,Mon Feb 2 16:53:56 2015 UTC,I'm certainly no vet but my first guess would be a tumor.  They are very common in older unspayed female pigs.  I've seen many photos of huge tumors after the operation.  A skilled pig surgeon can have wonderful results although it is a major surgery because of all the blood vessels that feed the tumor.
pigs,2uj5cn,Weird_With_A_Beard,3,Tue Feb 3 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"Two possibilities. One is her liver is shutting down. That causes fluid build up in the abdomen and also a loss of the ability to clot blood, hence the bleeding. More likely I suspect is a reproductive system tumor with spread throughout the abdomen. Sadly, neither of these scenarios gives much chance for a recovery. Good luck."
pigs,2uj5cn,American_Pig,4,Tue Feb 3 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"She is on liver pills.  The vet seemed to think if it's her liver, the abdomen swelling should go down within a month.  I would guess that the pills (Denamarin) would maybe make the liver work better?  I didn't think livers could be fixed?"
pigs,2uj5cn,morbidhyena,2,Tue Feb 3 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry I can't really help you on the issue itself, but are you sure your vet has enough experience with pigs? How come he was unable to get a blood sample for example? What reasons did he give why she wouldn't make it through surgery? Is there another vet who you could contact who might know more about treating pigs?"

pigs,2ud8a7,morbidhyena,3,Sun Feb 1 09:23:44 2015 UTC,Thanks!  We're doing well here.  I did lose my eldest in October at 18 years 1 month of age.  He was wagging his tail during breakfast and passed on his own in the afternoon.  I called a cremation service that came right out and picked him up.  It was a good passing and I'm glad he was home and got to choose his own time.  I'd put my camera down about 5 months ago and finally picked it up again yesterday.
pigs,2ud8a7,morbidhyena,2,Sun Feb 1 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"Aw, sorry to hear that.. but that is an amazing age for a pig, right? And I'm sure he's had the best possible life in your care. May he rest in peace."
pigs,2ud8a7,morbidhyena,3,Sun Feb 1 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"Several months earlier I'd thought it was time for me to make the decision but he let me know it wasn't time yet.  I'm so happy that he was able to pass at home at the time of his choosing.  He passed on the weekend while I was here.  The animal cremation people were amazingly respectful.  They carefully laid out a blanket, covered him, folded it and tucked him in.  They returned his remains a few days later with just as much respect.  He was old and his arthritis was a problem for him.  I'm sad that my best friend has moved on, but I'm happy he was able to choose the time and place.  He'll always be with me.

Does she go after the camera because she expects food because you feed her with things from your hand often? Intelligent curious beasts they are.   Fuck, I really want a pet pig, and there's a sanctuary across the country that is a multi-generation pig sanctuary that have been bred for their size. Damn zoning laws preventing me from adopting one."

Hesperopithecus meant ""ape of the western world,"" and it was heralded as the first higher primate of North America. Haroldcookii was given as the species name in reference to the original discoverer of the tooth, Harold Cook. It was originally described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1922, on the basis of a tooth that rancher and geologist Harold Cook found in Nebraska in 1917. The discovery was made around ten years after the finding of Piltdown Man, another possible human ancestor that turned out to be a hoax.

pigs,2spdk4,LePoisson,2,Sat Jan 17 18:45:45 2015 UTC,Why doesn't the breeder just get someone she's friends with to adopt the pig?
pigs,2spdk4,LePoisson,3,Sat Jan 17 15:51:28 2015 UTC,She has.  There are multiple families that have said they would take him in but the humane society originally told her they were putting him on a 30 day quarantine then sending him to some pig rescue center.  The guy who adopted him is also now trying to get him back to give to the breeder but they told him he is now at the pig rescue center but we haven't been able to get a hold of them.  So she has been getting the run around from them.  She has gotten a lawyer involved.  The police.  The secretary of ag for missouri.  Yet still the humane society won't budge.  This has all happened in the last 4 or 5 days.
pigs,2spdk4,LePoisson,-1,Sat Jan 17 16:49:30 2015 UTC,All this over a pig.  I mean goddamn it's a pig...we eat them for breakfast!  That's crazy.  Is there some legal precedent for this behavior?  I think someone at the shelter or pig rescue place must want it.
pigs,2spdk4,nprovein,2,Sat Jan 17 17:59:52 2015 UTC,Wow...  Edit:  sorry this just kind of upset me.  I feel like you don't have any pets.  To most people with Pets they consider them family.  Legally no.  There is a contract but the humane society won't honor because it's not between her and the humane society.  Understandable.  But they have completely cut her off from any information because of their beliefs of all breeders are bad.  No idea if someone from the humane society or the rescue place want him.  If that's the case then so be it.  Let us know.  The breeder just wants him in a loving place.  Not at the humane society or a rescue place that just cages them up.  This is not good for pet pigs.
pigs,2spdk4,nprovein,2,Sat Jan 17 18:02:30 2015 UTC,Just for the record I didn't mean that the actions undertaken to regain the pig were absurd.  I meant that the humane society isn't just giving the pig to someone offering to adopt is crazy.   Also I've had and have plenty of pets.   I just feel like there is alterior motive at play on the part of the humane society.  But maybe they're just bound by state laws and regulations too.

pigs,2qubc6,Ediferious,2,Tue Dec 30 19:28:32 2014 UTC,"Second the vet check.  They should be able to determine age by size and teeth once a breed (or mix) is determined.     If he came from an undesirable situation there is a high chance he hasn't received the best care and that can reflect in his size.  If you have a record from their vet, call them.  They may have better knowledge on the breed."

pigs,2qubc6,nybornwad,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:13:40 2014 UTC,So you don't think he is a pot belly of some kind? At 2 years old and not much larger than my French bulldog?
pigs,2qubc6,Vinnicio,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:34:25 2014 UTC,"Probably a little, it would be a lot easier to tell if he wasn't laying down."
pigs,2qubc6,goblinish,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:51:28 2014 UTC,"I think I can answer or at least point you in the right direction with a few of your questions. We recently where in the exact same situation and ended up with a 2 year old mini pig off craigslist. So I have done weeks of research and joined every pig group and forum out there. Still not an expert though!  1) He is a Julian pig. Probably not pure breed, but at least mostly. Probably mixed with pot belly. Julians have that body shape, color and spotting. A lot of the mini pigs out there are mix breeds though. Usually fundamentally Julian and Pot Belly. If he was mayjorily pot belly he would be black and white or black with a different body structure (shorter, more scrunched nose, rounder).  2) I can help a little with age but, like others have suggested the vet is a great helper. We took our piggy to the vet and they examined his teeth and said that his final set of adult teeth where coming, and that usually happens around 2 years of age. So they estimated him at that age aswell.  Here are a few other ways to estimate age.   A) Tail hair length. Pigs over the age of 1.5 - 2 years old have tail hair that grows about double the length of their tail.  B) Mohawk length. Altered adult pigs, especially males do not grow substantial Mohawks until they are around 2 years old. . C) Whisker length. The older they are the longer their whiskers are. They do not normally grow noticeable whiskers until they are over a year old.  I suppose some of this varies from pig to pig, and I think these features are more prominent in pot bellies than julians, but they are good ball parks.  From the research I have done, my best guess is your piggy is at least 1 year old and under 2.5 years old. My guess would be about 1.5 years old because he seems to be missing some of the features that a 2 year old has. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he was actually 2 years old though.  3) I am sure you know this by now, but be prepared for potentially a larger pig than he is now. Mini pigs slow down a lot around 2 years old but the continue to grow in weight and length until 3-5 years old. Or if they lied about age and he is younger he could still get a lot bigger all around.   Good luck!!"

pigs,2ozfys,svartorn,6,Fri Dec 12 18:23:32 2014 UTC,"The only way you can maintain that size is through starvation.  Mini pigs range from 60 - 80 pounds when full size, which is around 3 years old.  Average length is 32 inches and height around 14 - 18 inches.    The myth of the teapot pig is easy to sell.  They can start breeding at a very young age and bad breeders take advantage of it.  A 4 month old pig might only be 10 pounds and have a litter.  They advertise that litter and say ""look how small the mom is!""  Guess what, it's no where near full size.    I made a huge mistake with my first pig and didn't vet the breeder well.  The pig (pearl) was very sick and had to be medicated the entire time I had her.  She died shortly after 4 months old.  I researched my next breeder heavily and stayed in contact while we waited for the litter to come of age.  We were able to meet the parents and the rest of her litter.    For some reason Esther Louise won the genetic lottery.  She just turned 6 months and weighs almost 40 pounds, she already 26 inches long and 14 inches tall.  The next largest in her litter is 15 pounds.  She is completely healthy and has a good body shape.   Proper diet is easy to achieve.  Feed a fortified pig diet and fresh veggies (and some fruit).  They should be able to graze and play outside daily otherwise they become destructive.    They make fantastic pets, but if your focused on size get a cat or small dog.  And for the love of all that's good in the world, research your breeder!"

I moved my piglet to a setup like this after about a week in her own bedroom.  She started peenig wherever she was if the litter box wasn't right next to her when the urge hit.  In the smaller space, the whole floor was now ""her space."" and she only used the litter box.    After a meal, I'd leave her in there for a bit until she went, then reward her with a treat and praise while (or immediately after) she peed.  If she peed when she was out of this room, I'd give a firm ""No"" and put her back in there for about an hour.  After a while, I set up an area in the living room about the same size and when she got used to that I increased the size a few feet every week or so, still rewarding her when I catch action in the box.  From reading, negative reinforcement doesn't do much, but the positive seems to work well.  She's not yet trusted with the run of the house, but she is getting better at going back to the box when she's out.  edit:  forgot to mention that I haven't had my pigs very long, so this is anecdotal, not expert advice."

People honestly believe that these pigs will stay chihuahua size, but this is just not the case!  I am also incredibly envious that you have a pet pig."
pigs,2ms797,DiyoGi,1 point,Thu Nov 20 10:30:38 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree with the title and the video is unfortunately not that informative.   A lot has to do with a misconception that micro = Chihuahua size, when in actuality, a micro in comparison to a normal sized pig, is pretty small.   Portion control plays a huge role in how big pigs grow up to be, as well as the type of food you feed them. Most pig feed is designed to fatten up the pig for slaughter and consequently, if the owner is misinformed, will overfeed the pig resulting in the hogs that you see in the video.   There is specific feed that is made to keep them relatively small while providing proper nutrition along with good exercise which would result in a normal sized ""micro"" pig.   Source: I'm an owner of a ""mini"" pig going on 2 years,  which is about the age most pigs stop growing. She's about the size of an average basset hound =)"

Here's another link from Mississippi state with similar information Link.    Going from those, and a few other sites I looked at, seems like them chowing down on small animals isn't completely out of the question.  Your piggy's behaviour is probably just an instinctual thing, like my small dog chasing geckos.  If they're well fed and well loved I don't think it's of too much concern.  :)"

pigs,2hpf40,dazare,3,Sun Sep 28 16:13:48 2014 UTC,"here is a site that will answer some basic questions. Here are some answers that are relevant to your question.   How big are potbellied pigs?   PPB’s can range between 80 and 160 pounds, with the average pig weighing around 120 pounds. Miniature pigs continue to grow until they reach maturity at 3 to 5 years of age. Comparatively, farm pigs can weigh 600 to 1000 pounds.  Is there such thing as a Teacup or Micro-mini Potbelly Pig?  Though breeders and pet shops might claim they have micro-mini pigs, far too frequently, such pigs have stunted growth due to under-feeding and poor nutrition. Rarely do we see a pig that remains under 50 pounds at maturity unless it has health problems that are often a result of inbreeding. Starving a pig to keep it small is no different than starving a human child to keep it small. It’s cruel and it doesn’t work.  Can the size of the parents determine the ultimate size of the offspring?  To some degree, yes, but there are no 100% guarantees. Babies born to small pigs often grow up to be larger than their parents. When looking at the parents for sizing, make certain the parents are at least 3-5 years of age and that their growth has not been stunted from malnutrition or inbreeding"
pigs,2hpf40,goblinish,6,Sun Sep 28 16:58:06 2014 UTC,"Great points. If you're interested in getting a pig, but you might not love it/lose interest once it gets too big, a pig probably isn't for you. You're basically rolling the dice, especially because a lot of people only have the option of craigslist or whatever. I guess I ""lucked"" out because I found my pig on craigslist and she's staying relatively small/medium. If you're in love with the idea of having a pet pig, you should love it regardless of it's size.  Also: It's basically the equivalent of having a human baby. Lots of work/responsibility."
pigs,2hpf40,getoutofthepool,6,Sun Sep 28 20:20:49 2014 UTC,"Also apparently OP is 14. Pigs can live 15 or 20 years barring any health issues. At 14 you have no idea what your plans will be for the next 15 years. If you go to college who will take care of the pig? Will your parents be willing to care for a potentially destructive, active, needy, temperamental toddler type animal during those years? Will you be able to take it with you? Are pigs legal as pets in your area? Are you going to have enough time with school and other activities to care for the pig and give it the attention it needs to thrive? Who will pay for vet bills and food?  I'm all for kids (that aren't super young) getting pets, but it is the parents' responsibility to ensure the healthy and well being of the animal. Are your parents going to be willing to do that?  Pigs are smarter than dogs and need more attention. they can be destructive and temperamental when not given enough attention and care (sometimes even when those needs are met). They are fantastic animals and great pets if you are able to take care of them. otherwise too many end up in rescue centers looking for a new home."
pigs,2hpf40,goblinish,2,Mon Sep 29 00:21:12 2014 UTC,Definitely. I got my piggy a year ago as a 22 year old college student with a part time job. If it weren't for my awesome girlfriend who's able to take care of the pig while I'm at school/work I would be screwed.

Marlee will be four years old in October and is 60 pounds. She is litterbox trained, goes on daily walks, and even sleeps with me. She is loved by many neighbors in my complex as well as neighbors in my neighborhood. She has been in the KC Star. She is my best friend and the light of my life. While walking her on a daily walk animal control (who was in the area for a stray dog) stopped me simply because she is a pig. He said I had to get a license that I was unaware of and I agreed. The next day I attempted to get a license but was verbally attacked by a woman in animal control saying she is illegal. She turned me in to an investigator. I have informed them I am going to fight this law. You see, they changed the law in the 90's to allow pet pigs but then changed it back. It was my mistake of misreading the ordinance. She is technically considered ""livestock"" which I am not allowed to keep within 200 feet of my house. Please, please, please help me get this law amended and clarified what livestock really is, and that minipigs/potbelly pigs are PETS. I need Marlee as much as she needs me and I assure you this is for a very good cause. Getting this law amended will help there to be less abandoned pigs in shelters, the city can earn money by licensing pigs and this very grey area issue can be put to rest. Thank you in advance!""  If you live in KC or know anybody that lives here please help us spread the word about how amazing pet pigs are and prevent things like this from happening in the future!"

pigs,2g1ozk,Proxxshot,6,Thu Sep 11 01:04:11 2014 UTC,"No, it is to classify certain breeds of pigs(potbelly/mini) as pets. Currently since they are considered livestock they have to be housed at least 200 feet away from your home or else they will be forcefully removed and you will be fined.  Certain breeds of pig are certainly livestock, they are too large for standard living within a big city. But the smaller breeds are more manageable and are wonderful companions.  Sorry for the confusion!"

pigs,2fi7hg,snakeoil-huckster,4,Fri Sep 5 00:11:34 2014 UTC,"Pig discipline starts with reward withdrawal, not negative reinforcement (including spray bottles). Direct punishment is not effective. Naturally, start with feeding time, when she anticipates food the most.  Set strict rules for her. If any of the rules are broken, strongly say no and walk out of the room. My rules are:  1) No contact. At all. This works to break the nudging behaviour. 2) No swipes or lunges. 3) No attempts to knock the food bowl out of my hand when I place it. Furthermore, any approach she makes as I lower the food bowl results in me raising it up.   As an addendum, if you have taught her any tricks, make her perform one before meal time. If she breaks a rule, walk out of the room, and when she catches up to you, make her do a trick but do not reward her with food. Just walk back to the kitchen.   In parallel, you must give her an outlet for energy. Rooting boxes work well but are noisy. Treat balls will probably work better. I put peanuts in 2 liter bottles, screw on the cap real tight, and she opens it in minutes. Do this before meal time.  Is she spayed?"
pigs,2fi7hg,analog10,2,Fri Sep 5 03:02:57 2014 UTC,"Yes she is spayed.  I think a portion of the problem is that she has so many options.  She has a ton of toys (including a root box) and several areas to play.  I have given her the garage to play in also (connected to the house and I leave the door open so she runs in and out).  Today she ate through the garage car door and I caught her mouthing at the wall in the house.    I give her large bottles with food pellets in it.  I haven't tried to put the lid on.  I'll stop using the spray bottle and use your tricks.  I'm worried that if I ignore her she'll become more destructive, but I won't know until I try.  What's your feeding schedule and do your pigs nap?  She goes all day, nonstop and will only nap if I lay with her."
pigs,2fi7hg,analog10,2,Fri Sep 5 03:17:44 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you have a very high energy pig. I don't think she's eating through the garage door or damaging the wall because she really wants to.

She got her booster shots last week and she weighs 21 pounds.  I talked to her breeder and she has some of her litter mates still that range between 5-10 pounds.  She's not overweight,  she's just a hoss.  I need to measure her, but I'm guessing she's at least 20 inches from cheat to butt and at least 12"" tall.  She has a root box that she gets one of her meals in daily, the bottles with pellets/cheerios, tons of interactive toys and a giant toy box.  Crazy thing is, tonight when I was on the floor with her, she climbed on my chest and fell asleep on me.  She has never done that before."

Ross Mill is rather expensive and I noticed A LOT of powder.  She also gets coconut oil in her food three times a week, a vitamin E capsule once a week, and a children's gummy vitamin once a week.

pigs,2f4lbv,anti_crastinator,1 point,Mon Sep 1 00:34:37 2014 UTC,a little research online shows that $2000(editted as earlier I missed a 0 and had it read as 200) isn't a horrible price to pay. It really depends on what you want to pay for your pig. There are many breeders across the country that will ship a pig to you so you aren't limited to just getting one from a breeder right near you. Get an idea of what breeders are offering pigs you like and for how much.   Also keep in mind while the price might be expensive it will be care costs that are more than the initial purchase price.
pigs,2f4lbv,goblinish,1 point,Mon Sep 1 13:16:52 2014 UTC,$200 is a very fair price if they are legit like you say but the breeder is asking 10x that!
pigs,2f4lbv,Borax,0,Mon Sep 1 17:43:37 2014 UTC,"i missed a 0 I did mean 2000. it seems to be about the price others are going for from other breeders as well. Some you might find for less, but double check the health of their pigs and what you get for that lower price before jumping on a deal."
pigs,2f4lbv,goblinish,1 point,Mon Sep 1 17:45:38 2014 UTC,"$2000 is very expensive and I hope it's a typo.  I can see paying up to $1000 if it is already vaccinated and altered, as well as having a solid health guarantee for at least a year, and have unusual markings.  If it's the price for a pig, and only the pig, I wouldn't pay more than 600."

They do have a 2 year old barrow that's $350.  Looks like they are selling off a lot of their breeding kunes and were asking for $7500 for 5 adults, one of which is pregnant.   Unfortunately, I had a negative experience with that breeder.  Because of it, I wouldn't recommend them, but I found their prices to be middle of the road.  They are beautiful pigs and have the cutest faces."

Weight will be the least of your issues though. Your pig will challenge you for the alpha spot. Are you prepared to deal with that? Are you going to confine him to a little crate for 8 hrs of the day or will someone be around to supervise him?

I've heard the story about ""mini pigs"" being inbred or starved to fool buyers, but have never seen a verified source for this, only internet and forum posts that seem to share the same thing every time. I have, however, read in Lyall Watson's The Whole Hog and Linda McDonald-Brown's Choosing and Keeping Pigs that people have indeed sold baby pigs as teacup pigs, when in fact they were just average (read: large) sized pigs. This was apparently a big thing a few decades ago when it was a fad.   McDonald-Brown does talk about how there used to be two minipig pedigree registries in the United States, but they are now defunct. The book is about ten years old, though, so it is a bit dated and doesn't have anything about the Juliana pedigree and whether or not it's legitimate."
pigs,2f2e10,robertwmac,0,Mon Sep 1 18:39:22 2014 UTC,"They don't exist, and if someone is trying to sell you one, they are scamming you. The smallest is a Vietnamese pot belly. The pigs that stay small, are relatively small because they are inbred so much that their organs expand but their skeleton doesn't essentially. They end up living short, painful lives because of this. If you can't support a full size pot belly, just get a small dog."
pigs,2f2e10,CalvinballAllstar,2,Sun Aug 31 15:41:20 2014 UTC,"Where did you get all this information? Julianas are smaller, they're leaner and have longer snouts and they don't have the jowly necks and big bellies like the pot bellies. And they live anywhere from 15-25 years. They're very smart, mine was easy to litter train, can sit and spin around for a treat, and comes when you call her name. She doesn't shed and is very clean."

Maybe he just isn't ready for big foods yet.   The rooting was a problem for me for about the first year, I'd say. Mortimer is 3 now, and he will root the bed, but he doesn't root me anymore. Try giving KB a pillow to root, that's what I did.   Good luck! They're a handful, but I can't imagine my life without my pig. Also, there's a pretty large community of pig owners on Instagram.

pigs,2bt93k,colonelskibobjones,2,Sun Jul 27 14:00:02 2014 UTC,"Our piggy is almost 3 years old - we picked him up at 6 weeks.  When we were still using a litter box, he peed on the floor only once. My wife soaked it up with some paper towels then she put the towels into his box. From that moment onward he understood that's where he should be doing his business.  As /u/robosmrf mentioned, you will want to cut one side down for an entry so he doesn't have to scrape his belly when climbing in and out.  On the food - have you tried experimenting with veggies as treats between normal meal time? Whenever we bring a new veggie home (yesterday was green onions) I'll take a little bit and casually toss it on the floor near him. He's never been one to turn down any type of food, so he'll usually give it a sniff then munch it down. (So far his favorite has been dandelion greens).  The one food that he's still refuses to eat to this day has been mushrooms (go figure). When we drop a small one on the floor, he just rolls it around with his snout and treats like a toy."
pigs,2bt93k,analog10,1 point,Sun Jul 27 12:33:56 2014 UTC,"Your pig is so cute!!!  Mine will be 5 years old in December.  For the litter box, I cut it down in the center so she could step in and put duct tape all around the edges so it wouldn't cut my piggy up.  My pig didn't like broccoli or anything when she was young but now enjoys pretty much everything, except mushrooms. LOL   I fed her 1/4 of a cup 2 times a day and started giving her treats when she used the litter box when she was younger.  Now she eats 1 cup twice a day and some treats throughout.  I noticed when she was younger she liked her litter box hiding in the corner, she pooped outside of it once, so I put it in the box and she understood where to go.  Enjoy the snuggles."

pigs,2azsir,Weird_With_A_Beard,2,Thu Jul 17 22:05:32 2014 UTC,I was walking through the shop at work today (sweating in Florida) and spotted these 3 taking advantage of the shade.  I walked quietly to the back of the shop to capture their laziness without waking them.  A couple hours later I almost felt bad as I woke them up for the ride home.
pigs,2azu7e,thewheelhouse,2,Thu Jul 17 22:22:13 2014 UTC,"Hank probably won't get full bladder control for another 2 months. Eventually he will have an iron bladder (pigs can hold it for quite a long time). As for litter box training, eventually he will be too big for a litter box. So it's better to train him to go outside on a set schedule from the beginning.  Right now, his home territory is the room in which he was originally confined. When he learns to go outside, the whole house will be his territory and he will not want to mess it.  Also clean the urine spots with Urine Be Gone."
pigs,2azu7e,analog10,1 point,Fri Jul 18 04:13:14 2014 UTC,"Okay awesome, thanks! I'll try to pick up some Urine Be Gone later today. I'm glad to know it's because he's young and that it'll get better pretty soon!"
pigs,2azu7e,qualityburger,2,Fri Jul 18 14:08:12 2014 UTC,"We had this same problem for the first few months with our little guy.  We had the litter box in the kitchen (where his bed was too) and he learned to use it well.  But as soon as we let him roam around the rest of the house (only while we were home) he would go on the carpet.  We scooted him out the door every time this happened.  After some repetition, that finally worked and he actually stopped using his litter box altogether (that was at about 6-8 months of age).  He only does his business outside now even when he is in the house during the day.  So I think, as analog10 said, it is part repetitious training that outside is the place to go (if you can catch him in the act) and just getting to the age where they have better control of their bladder."

pigs,299yx3,Weird_With_A_Beard,3,Fri Jun 27 22:03:15 2014 UTC,At the end of the workday on Monday June 16th I saw that Mokey had a severe limp in her right rear leg.  In the morning I called my Vet's office but he was out on house calls all day.  He returned my call on Wednesday morning and said to give her Rimadyl and limit her exercise for several days and he scheduled an appointment for the following Monday.  She didn't improve so he did x-rays after using isoflurane gas to sedate her.  He didn't see anything in the x-rays so he sent them to another radiologist who also found no cracks or breaks.  So it appears to be a soft tissue injury of unknown cause.  He switched her from Rimadyl to Phenylbutazone and said to continue to limit her exercise.  She's had to stay home for almost 2 weeks now as several of my others go to work with me.  My next option is to take her to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.  I'm first opting to give her a little time to see if there's any more improvement.  She gets around well but doesn't want to put any weight on the leg as she is standing.  I'm relieved to know that nothing is broken and am hoping that she just did something that requires rest (and not surgery).
pigs,299yx3,qualityburger,2,Fri Jun 27 22:06:48 2014 UTC,"This is probably a long shot, but our pet piggy came in one day limping and trying to stay off one of his legs, which we were thinking was an injury, turned out there was just a little pebble lodged in between his hoof that he didn't like putting weight on.  We took it out and he was good to go.  Certainly something to check!"
pigs,299yx3,Afartinthebasket,3,Sat Jun 28 15:27:23 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion.  She's been thoroughly checked on her pads and between her toes.  No splinters or foreign objects.  I've squeezed up and down her leg and hips with no serious flinching.  The vet did notice that her injured leg is warmer than the others.  While she was under anesthesia he manipulated both rear legs and found a bit more ""looseness"" in the injured one.  She can run during feeding time but lifts her leg when she stops.  I fear that she will end up going to the large animal vet at the Veterinary College and they certainly aren't inexpensive.  Her recent vet visit cost $646 for the exam and x-rays.  She's worth it though :o)"

(My other dogs have high prey drives, so they are never aloud around the pig/cats)   She uses a liter box with large pine shavings, but this is what I trained her to do.  Some pigs can be potty trained to go outside like a dog would.   I would get in touch with a rescue, they have a lot of info that would help you match a pig to your lifestyle.  I think there is a large rescue called Ross Mill Farm, they are on Facebook. They adopt pigs out.   Honestly, my piggy is my best buddy, but they rant like puppies.  You really have to earn their trust and bond with them. It's easy to do when you have a baby piglet, but harder to do when they are adults.  BUT piggies LOVE treats and belly rubs, so as long as you don't mind spoiling them, any age pig should work."

pigs,28wjv9,CalvinballAllstar,1 point,Mon Jun 23 20:55:17 2014 UTC,"Just so you know, most ""rescue pigs"" you come across are likely rescue pigs because it got much bigger than the owner thought. Lots of people sell regular baby piglets and market them as mini's that later grow into 150-200 lbs within a year or two. There really isn't a specific ""miniature pig"" or ""teacup pig"" breed. Some breeds stay smaller than others. I have a year old Juliana that weighs about 15 lbs. Judging by her parents she'll likely be about 25 lbs full grown but we'll see in a few years. And she was no rescue, the purebred smaller pigs typically cost thousands. Not to knock your plan here, they are super great pets, very clean and very smart, loyal and affectionate. Just thought you should realize, the likeliness of finding a small house pig as a rescue is not very high."

My pig, on multiple occasions has eaten my phone charger cable while I was on the phone, clearly understanding the two were somehow connected.   With that being said, I couldn't imagine my life without my pig. He is cuddly and sweet (to me, he's very territorial about his home to other people) and sleeps in bed with me every night. Good luck!

pigs,28wjv9,goblinish,2,Tue Jun 24 12:19:38 2014 UTC,"First thing you need to do is look up if you can have a pig in your state. Not all states, and even some municipalities within a state, won't allow pet pigs. I don't really know when this was last updated but this might be a jumping off point for you to see.  You will also need to find a vet that will  be able to treat your new pet.  Keep in mind they can live 20 years so you're looking at a long term commitment. It's great you want to rescue a pig, that's what i""m going to be doing as well. You'll want to do a ton of research before you jump into though to make sure a pig is right for you. Here is another site that might help get you started with that."
pigs,28wjv9,analog10,1 point,Mon Jun 23 21:24:15 2014 UTC,"Thank you :) I live around a ton of farms that have pigs, so I didn't give it much thought but I will look into it :) I don't see my state on that list, but I will research further.  thank you very much!"
pigs,28wjv9,ChriThePun,2,Mon Jun 23 22:16:17 2014 UTC,"The problem is some areas see pigs as only livestock, not potential pets. So any place you aren't allowed to either have a pig as a pet or a farm animal in the neighborhood you could be running into problems. Most of the farms with pigs likely have FDA certificates that show they are legally able to have and care for the animals."
pigs,28wjv9,whatism8,1 point,Mon Jun 23 22:18:42 2014 UTC,"I see, my town and state is very laid back about stuff like that (as long as the animal is being taken care of properly) so I don't see it being much of an issue, but it's definitely something I will look into :)"
pigs,28wjv9,whatism8,2,Mon Jun 23 22:20:36 2014 UTC,"I would think that most people won't ever have an issue with someone coming in and complaining they are in violation of some ordinance about having a pig. That being said if anything were to happen with your pig it's better to know ahead of time if you are in the clear or not. Also if it is illegal to have a pig as a pet where you are you will have a hard time finding a vet that will be willing to see and treat your pig. As a pet they have different needs than a farm pig.  Where I am I have to register the pig I get, much like any other animal a cat or dog, and keep it up to date on vaccines and such. I already know what vet I'm going to use and I have a back up emergency clinic, just in case something happens after hours."
pigs,28wjv9,spicyshrimpbit,1 point,Mon Jun 23 22:25:45 2014 UTC,"definitely :) I wouldn't get one if it were illegal, and I'll be sure to find a vet long before I even start looking to adopt :)"

pigs,2859zj,Toddcraft,6,Sat Jun 14 18:19:42 2014 UTC,"The secret weapon is goat milk. Feed him pure goat milk first. Then mix it in his with pig feed. Over time, replace the goat milk with water (avoid giving him dry feed).  For pooping, give him a corner with some privacy (put up some ornamental grass, bushes or anything for cover). Cover is important because he feels vulnerable when he poops. That will probably become his spot. As long as you take him out on a regular schedule he shouldn't need a litter box. Keep the corner clean or he will not want to use the spot anymore."
pigs,2859zj,analog10,2,Mon Jun 16 04:31:41 2014 UTC,"I don't really have a ton of experience with pigs, though have been doing tons of research. Others may be able to help with specifics, but my experience in rescuing animals might help with a few basics.  As far as getting him to eat. Is he eating at all when you offer him food? DO you know what he had been eating. Maybe try a few types of veggies to see if you can find something he can't resist and put that in with the food you are offering if he needs more encouragement to eat. Also try feeding him often so he knows that new food is coming soon.  As for the litter box. You should be fine letting him poop anywhere unless you want to litter train him to be indoors. Then you might want to limit the space he can roam until he is more accustomed to using it and isn't leaving surprises elsewhere for him. If you aren't planning on him being an indoor pig or being litter box trained let him go where he wants. From what I understand they usually find a spot they are happiest to use and will go back to it just about every time. Make sure you keep it picked up when you can though to encourage that tidy behavior. As for more information about rehabbing pigs maybe send an email to some of the pet pig rescues out there for some advice as well.  Great job taking in the poor little guy. Keep in mind he is probably frightened and anxious not knowing where he is or who you are. Maybe in the tent throw an old tshirt in so he gets more comfortable bonding with you. Any idea how old he is? Weighing only 13 pounds is tiny tiny. also post pics!! love seeing the precious snouts."
pigs,2859zj,goblinish,2,Sat Jun 14 20:03:31 2014 UTC,"Make sure to have a proper pig feed.  When my girl was fussy I would mix in baby food to entice her.  You can also use apple juice or cranberry juice (not the cocktail).  Add a variety of veggies and some fruits.  If he has free reign of the yard, watch his belly for signs of bloating.  They get grass belly for grazing too much.  I would suggest an enclosure so you can monitor his eating and pooping.    Check out Ross Mill Farms website.  They are full of information.  Also, if you use facebook, check out the pig pages such as Mini Pig Education or Pot Belly Pig Lovers.  Everyone is very helpful.  Best wishes to you!"

pigs,27tdnx,svartorn,2,Tue Jun 10 22:51:41 2014 UTC,"Every time I hear about someone feeding their dog/cat a vegetarian diet I get so sad... They are meant to have meat in their diet, just look at those teeth!  Edit: Words"
pigs,27tdnx,Peanut_Larry,2,Wed Jun 11 02:00:56 2014 UTC,"Dogs are omnivores like humans, but they naturally have a bigger percentage of meat in their diets than us. From what I've read over the years, it's indeed possible to feed a dog a healthy vegetarian diet, when paying attention to provide all the (micro)nutrients. It always depends on whether the caregiver has done their research, really. This is the nutrient profile for dogs, as you can see, almost all of these nutrients can also be found in plants. Exceptions are vitamin B12 (and vitamin D to an extent), which can be supplemented in the same way as vegans do it.  With cats, vegetarian nutrition is much harder and might be impossible for many of them, since they eat almost nothing but meat naturally."
pigs,27tdnx,morbidhyena,0,Wed Jun 11 05:40:31 2014 UTC,"the militant veganism of the dads   bullshit.   they feed dogs a vegan diet because dogs can be vegan and their dogs are in good health. also they have cats who are not on vegan diet. of course you didn't mention that, it is much easier to be jerk who gives random ""militant vegan"" etiquette."

It's hard to let our animal buddies go.   Maybe it might help to make a donation to a Pig Sanctuary in his memory? Then he could ""live on"" to do other piggies good.  Is it possible your Hudson could have gotten into something that poisoned him? Rat poison, peach pits or other fruit pits, old lead-painted boards? Pigs are curious animals and can be very sneaky about food they've found.  They also don't last long at all once they begin refusing food. Any pig that starts getting more than usually picky should go to the vet. (They CAN be picky. Our first pig liked celery, our current pig regards it with deep suspicion.)"
pigs,24ir1m,theslugmaster,1 point,Sat May 3 01:44:14 2014 UTC,"Thank you. I'm not sure what my wife decided to do since they contacted her, and we've both kind of been in hysterics. Not at all. He spent a lot of time inside with us, and when he was outside it was on our patio where I'd constantly go out there to clean it up. Or when we'd walk him on his harness. Yeah, that's why we took him to the vet when we did, it terrified us. He was always picky about certain foods, so much so that we called him a diva. But he would always at least try something once. When he turned his head to everything, we knew something wasn't right. That  lead to us honestly kicking ourselves for not getting him there sooner, but he wasn't showing signs of any sort until we noticed he was kind of lethargic and wasn't eating. I mean, we took him there immediately. But according to the vet, there was nothing that could've been done,  and there's nothing we could have done to better the situation. His kidneys were failing, and his liver was following right after it. When we got him there he thought it could have been a tooth infection, or something related. But we knew it wasn't that because he wasn't in  pain, and he was eating not even 24 hours before. Not to mention we brushed his teeth with safe toothpaste, and inspected his body (along with teeth) very frequently."

So many people don't and then dump the pig when it's not exactly what they expected.    4 of my 7 house pigs are spotted.  3 were reddish with black spots.  2 lost their red as they grew and my newest little one is losing his red.  They've turned to a beautiful ""dirty blond"" color with black spots.  Only 1 was white with black spots when I got him.  Although you will hear the term Juliana a lot, it's not actually a breed.  It's more of a name made up by breeders that don't want to call what they sell ""Potbelly Pigs"".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pig_breeds  http://www.thepigsite.com/info/swinebreeds.php  http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/swine  Before you get a pig you need to accept that it will probably reach a healthy weight in the 150 pound range, which is much smaller in size than a large dog.  The breeders will try to convince you that they have invented a special mini version.  It hasn't yet happened in the almost 18 years I've been active in the pet pig world.  All pigs are mini when they are young.  Here's a shot of my newest pig.  You can see he still has some red coloring on his rump.  It's hard to imagine that he will gain 140 pounds or so over the coming years, but he will.  He gets his second bath today so I can work some more on his ears.  He's still timid and is scared of people.  He takes treats from my hand and we are taking it very slowly so that he can learn to trust me."
pigs,22wzef,Weird_With_A_Beard,2,Sun Apr 13 13:00:14 2014 UTC,"yes thank you! Your pig is very pretty, I said Juliana because there was a bunch of information ranging different breeds of pigs from pot bellys, julianas, to kunekune, and it seems the julianas have the longer snouts and leaner bodies with less of a ""pot belly"" which is what I'm looking for, the really, plump ones with rolls all showed to be pot bellies, but I am a novice here so I could easily be wrong. Yours looks learn and a great shape; pretty close to what I'm looking for. I couldnt find any standard pot bellies in this piglet color that I found, close to this link:  http://img.classistatic.com/crop/150x100/i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjQ=/z/-BUAAMXQVT9SsqXL/$_19.JPG  Kinda like this red/brown with small speckled brown spots.   If its just a type of Potbelly then thats great, I just really like the look of the long snout and leaner body when they are full grown.

pigs,22jvwr,ecpigman,3,Tue Apr 8 21:37:42 2014 UTC,"I don't have a pig yet but have you tried any other training with him?  When I'm working with a dog that is skittish around a leash i use a lot of slow positive conditioning. It's a great use for clicker training if you are familiar with it. Leave the harness and leash out and anytime they look at it give positive feedback with a click, praise or treat.   Next step to encourage them to investigate it more closely is to put a couple of small treats in the middle of the harness on the floor so they put their nose in the loop without it moving. After they are comfortable with it on the floor hold it in our hand and offer treats close to it so they see it hanging free. Again the key is tons of positive feedback.   My next step is to hang the harness on my arm and offer a treat from the same hand. Every time they take the treat nicely slide the harness closer to your hand. Step by step you'll find yourself offering treats or clicks with their nose almost under the strap of the harness. If you can have them comfortable with that then hold the harness in one hand a treat in the other just behind it so they have to push their nose into the harness to get the treat. farther and farther until you have the loop over their head and are using a treat to keep their head still while you rest the loop on their neck. Only for a moment to start. Tons of praise again if they let you do that and take it off with out panicking. Each time you are able to let the harness rest on their neck give them all the praise you can muster so they associate it with positive attention. once they are comfortable with that clipping it is the next step following the same progression moving slowly and tons of positive attention.  Eventually your pet will see the harness as a fun thing they get to wear and play with you. spend some time not walking just playing with the harness on so they aren't seeing it as a job or a chore. When you attach a leash and are asking them to walk with you start by taking a step forward and rewarding them when they come to you at your side. once you're able to take a few steps this way you'll be walking smoothly in no time.   I hope that helps :)"

He's very shy and a couple of my others are explaining to him that he's at the very bottom of the herd.  Some of them though just sniff him as something new and interesting.  Today he gets a bath, he slept in a crate in the living room last night.  My house is setup with many narrow escape paths and the bigger pigs don't get in trouble for chasing him.  They are herd animals and quickly learn how to get along and who to respect.  Pigture added:  Here he is meeting my 11 year old female who was out in the yard when I brought him in the gate."
pigs,22cd2u,deegan258,2,Sun Apr 6 13:43:34 2014 UTC,Dude that's wonderful. Best of luck.
pigs,22cd2u,jacqnasty,2,Sun Apr 6 16:11:15 2014 UTC,very happy there are good people like you. I've had troubles with my two girls but I couldn't ever imagine giving up on them.
pigs,22cd2u,jacqnasty,7,Sun Apr 6 20:17:39 2014 UTC,"I've got to admit that last Sunday morning I sort of snapped.  My 2 year old high energy pig was driving me crazy.  She's started getting up about 3-4 am and tearing the house apart.  Last Sunday at 4 am I caught her with her back feet on the couch to reach papers on a high shelf above it (she did get and shred the papers).  I'd had enough and posted to a pig rescue list I'm active on that I was going to have to rehome her.  Several Sanctuaries volunteered right away to take her because they've followed her story for 2 years.  I immediately felt guilty for even thinking of letting her go.  The next day a Florida Sanctuary that had her parents offered to take her if I'd take little Bentley who was getting his neuter the next day.  I thanked them profusely, explained that I was racked with guilt, depressed that I had even mentioned giving up on her and that I would give their offer serious thought.  I knew after talking to them that Mokey was staying with me and that I would redo my house to make it livable for both of us.  I called them back and said I was keeping her but that I wanted to come down and meet her parents.  Mokey stayed home and I took a crate with me.  I figured that because they were so cool to offer to take Mokey that I was going to pick up Bentley to make room for them to save another pig.  So far he's brave with my pigs but scared of me.  He's found a hidden spot in the yard for himself and grunts his little grunts as I walk by but moves away if I get near.  This afternoon I was able to call him with little grunts and offer him some more pellets.  I was able to lay on the ground and stroke his cheek with my finger as he ate.  I got up and left before he finished.  I'll go slow.  TLDR; I was thinking of dumping a pig and ended up getting another instead."
pigs,22cd2u,LooksAtClouds,2,Sun Apr 6 20:56:41 2014 UTC,Haha Monkey sounds like my Sadie!!! And yes those are the insides of her bean bag that she ripped to shreds. She wakes us up at 5am every morning screaming.
pigs,22cd2u,LooksAtClouds,2,Mon Apr 7 03:04:01 2014 UTC,"LOL, ya just gotta love 'em."
pigs,22cd2u,Debra_S,2,Mon Apr 7 09:47:55 2014 UTC,"WeirdWAB- When our older pig started doing that, we started giving her a snack right before bedtime so we could sleep through the night. We had a new baby at the time and I swear I ALMOST breastfed the pig one night by mistake, we were so tired. So, started giving the snack and kept it up a couple of years. Then gradually made the snack smaller and earlier, until we quit giving it entirely. Hope this helps, and wish I could visit your pig family."
pigs,22cd2u,Debra_S,1 point,Sat May 3 01:56:51 2014 UTC,"Thank you, that's a good suggestion.  I changed my attitude and habits and things are much better here.  I also have been handing out some night time treats but will increase them because it makes sense that food in their bellies will help them sleep longer."
pigs,22cd2u,goblinish,1 point,Sat May 3 14:24:18 2014 UTC,"Borrowed the idea from ""tanking up"" the human baby before we went to bed. We just tanked up the pig ""baby"" too."
pigs,22cd2u,goblinish,4,Sat May 3 19:24:12 2014 UTC,You are a wonderful person. I wish I was your neighbor.
pigs,22cd2u,goblinish,10,Sun Apr 6 14:09:09 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I just went out to get him for his bath and the other 6 were laying around relaxing with Bentley nowhere in sight.  I finally spotted him in the yard behind me running along my fence.  I used a ladder to cross the fence and he was too fast for me.  I don't know those neighbors well at all and felt very strange being in their backyard.  I came back over the fence and drove around the block and knocked on their door to ask for help.  The son led me into the backyard and was my pig blocker as I tried to coral the little guy.    Finally I caught him in some bushes and was able to pick him up.  I was going to carry him to the van and drive him home but he started screaming and I thought it best to put him over the fence.  The neighbors were surprised that I wouldn't put him down as he screamed and waited for him to quiet down.  I explained that I can't let him learn to scream to get what he wants.  I came home and blocked the small hole in the corner that he had squeezed through.  He is so much smaller than all my other pigs that I forgot to do a fresh scan of my fence line.  I can add fence sealing to today's list of chores."
pigs,22cd2u,goblinish,4,Sun Apr 6 14:51:03 2014 UTC,"The part about waiting until the tantrum is over is so much like training dogs and parenting children! I don't have a pig so I am learning from this forum (and get to see cute pictures).  It is good that your neighbors saw that you are a knowledgeable caregiver to your pigs, it might help ward off any future complaints or concerns.  Good luck with your fence maintenance."
pigs,22cd2u,LunarEgo,3,Sun Apr 6 15:33:21 2014 UTC,I just wanted to say that your willingness to take in these discarded pigs is wonderful. I've finally convinced my fiance that we should adopt a pig or two and will be looking at local shelters as soon as we move to our new home next year. I'm so glad the adorable little guy has a great home with so many friends and won't be thrown away again. :)
pigs,22cd2u,fruitinspace,3,Sun Apr 6 20:22:36 2014 UTC,Let me know when you're ready for a pig and I'll try to find the nearest pig sanctuary to you.
pigs,22cd2u,pigsaspets,1 point,Sun Apr 6 20:57:59 2014 UTC,Thanks I already have found 2 sanctuary rescue groups within a reasonable driving distance. I even found a local breeder that does some rescue work as well. I can't wait until we have our new home and can bring home a special snouted friend
pigs,22cd2u,piggyplace,2,Mon Apr 7 20:41:22 2014 UTC,Please stay away from breeders.  All the sanctuaries are overloaded with wonderful pigs needing homes and the breeders keep producing more and more for profit as the sanctuaries have to refuse to take in any more.  I'm all about rescue and have no love for people that breed.  I don't mean to get on my soapbox but breeders are a very sore subject with me.
pigs,22bz0a,getoutofthepool,2,Sun Apr 6 08:07:37 2014 UTC,How old is she?  Is she spayed?  How long have you had her?  Any other people or animals in the house?
pigs,22bz0a,Weird_With_A_Beard,1 point,Sun Apr 6 13:46:10 2014 UTC,she's about a year old. She is spayed. We've had her for about 6 months. It's just me and my girlfriend in the house.
pigs,22bz0a,Weird_With_A_Beard,1 point,Sun Apr 6 19:18:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I've never had to deal with this so I'm not sure of the proper approach.  My first pig was perfect and went everywhere with me.  His first Monday morning he went to work with me and continued for about 15 years (now he stays home).  After that each pig joined the (indoor/outdoor) herd and learned the rules fast from the others.  I've been lucky with a loud ""NO"" and then ignoring the pig has usually worked with me, but then I can turn to another pig to pet and praise as the ignored one watches.  I'm the only human in the house so maybe someone from a multi-person house can offer some better advise.  I'd guess that since I have multiple pigs in the house they each have someone to occupy them when I'm gone so they don't miss me as much.  Frequently people will suggest getting a second pig since they are herd animals.  My first pig was an only pig for 7 years and adjusted well to a second pig."
pigs,22bz0a,Weird_With_A_Beard,1 point,Sun Apr 6 19:39:31 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the help. I really appreciate it. My girlfriend has suggested getting Penny a friend, but we're scared that another animal would be way too much work as we barely have enough time for Penny by herself. Also, don't pigs kind of hate each other? We keep reading that pigs like to be an only child and they'll fight a lot when living together."
