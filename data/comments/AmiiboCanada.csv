AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,PoopOnMyBum,5,Tue Jul 21 23:05:07 2015 UTC,WTF AMAZON?!?!?!?!?!?! they better put up palutena this friday....
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Akagami1,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:31 2015 UTC,I didn't get a notice. man.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Dineshan016,2,Wed Jul 22 01:53:43 2015 UTC,What the hell I missed her?! I thought it went online on the 24th?
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Narukokun,3,Wed Jul 22 04:14:13 2015 UTC,No notice either. Where are you and what time did you order at?
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,GreenMallard,2,Tue Jul 21 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm in Thunder Bay, Ontario and I ordered it about 11:55pm on the night it went up for a little while."
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,GreenMallard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:50 2015 UTC,Just curious. I am in Toronto and my delivery is July 31.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,ShaunSXXX,0,Tue Jul 21 23:19:18 2015 UTC,Do you have prime? I'm in TO aswell and I'm getting it on friday.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,GreenMallard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"No, I was going to sign up for Prime to order on the 24th haha and when it went up obviously I did not have time to sign up."
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,ShaunSXXX,0,Tue Jul 21 23:29:54 2015 UTC,lol. That's prob why you're getting it later. Just curious.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,The_Beebat,0,Tue Jul 21 23:30:48 2015 UTC,If you sign up now you can change the shipping speed for free
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Amiibro88,2,Wed Jul 22 01:39:18 2015 UTC,I know it wasn't the intention of the OP but this definitely feels like salt in the wounds lol.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,lordof42,2,Wed Jul 22 00:51:06 2015 UTC,I didnt get the email :C
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,alicia2468,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Err if you remember, what was the shipping speed you had it on?  I am a Prime member too, but for some reason it's not Prime Express, only 2 day shipping so it got me all confused if there even is a difference or not lol"
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,alicia2468,0,Wed Jul 22 02:36:11 2015 UTC,2 day shipping.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,lordpizzapop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:32 2015 UTC,ok thanks. I don't think I will ever understand Amazon lol
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Blu167,0,Wed Jul 22 02:54:48 2015 UTC,Sucks that not everyone will be getting them Friday though :(

AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,PaperRok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:11:52 2015 UTC,Nothing here with free shipping. But I'm patient :p
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,HKalks,0,Tue Jul 21 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it has a lot to do with your distance from the distribution centre. Even though mine is being sent with Prime, it probably won't leave until Thursday. They can get it here overnight, even though it's supposed to be two-day.  EDIT: Downvotes, seriously? Who's the anonymous salty whiner?"
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,somenorn,0,Tue Jul 21 23:40:04 2015 UTC,Two day for preorders just means you get it on release day. It's not two day shipping when they start shipping other people's orders.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Charak-V,0,Wed Jul 22 02:07:37 2015 UTC,whaaaaaaaaaa!  i hope they start shipping tonight. no notice on my order yet.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,zekev3,0,Tue Jul 21 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"Nothing yet, they probably shipped early so it arrives on its release date.      Not yet shipped Delivery estimate: Friday, July 24, 2015 by 8:00pm"

AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Midnight-Runner,0,Tue Jul 21 23:13:22 2015 UTC,Mine hasn't shipped yet. Weird.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,GreenMallard,0,Tue Jul 21 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"not yet, also have prime"
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,coreygrandy,0,Tue Jul 21 23:18:40 2015 UTC,That could be why. Maybe Amazon Prime puts you at the front of the line.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Helixium,0,Tue Jul 21 23:21:23 2015 UTC,Indeed.  I ordered a bunch of games during the E3 discount and Prime Shipping indicated a guaranteed release day arrival. Probably the case for anything one might pre-order.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Shmeediddy,0,Tue Jul 21 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"I have Prime and mine hasn't shipped yet, but that's fine, it'll probably be soon enough."

AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,runikepisteme,0,Tue Jul 21 23:52:37 2015 UTC,Mine hasn't been shipped yet but I did do 2 day shipping so it should be here by Friday like they said
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Helixium,0,Tue Jul 21 23:54:52 2015 UTC,Mine shipped expected delivery is Friday afternoon :)  I live in PEI
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,Narukokun,-2,Wed Jul 22 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, some salty child blew a tiny blood vessel with all these happy people who secured a Palutena and went on a downvoting rampage :P"
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,dash6,2,Tue Jul 21 23:52:55 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with being upset when we were promised that we would be notified and that she would go online at a specific time and then that doesn't happen. I actually didn't have to worry about getting amiibo for once and then this happened. Anyone who can't be at their computers for 24/7 has a right to be upset.
AmiiboCanada,3e4qdm,cmurph666,-2,Wed Jul 22 04:33:31 2015 UTC,Mine hasnt shipped yet. But i have a distribution centre less than 15 min from my house

AmiiboCanada,3e5fmm,GoGoPowerPlay,0,Wed Jul 22 02:35:07 2015 UTC,It isn't very hard to find toon link
AmiiboCanada,3e5fmm,Octopus58,5,Wed Jul 22 02:48:26 2015 UTC,In stores it is in some places.  I can't find it anywhere near me in store.

AmiiboCanada,3e5fmm,GoGoPowerPlay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:01:33 2015 UTC,Really? I seen him at EB and Walmart like a couple of days ago. Was thinking of buying him for a custom
AmiiboCanada,3e5fmm,Octopus58,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:07:06 2015 UTC,Then I say go for it! What custom were you thinking of doing?

AmiiboCanada,3e5tjr,T3rr4nc387,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:03:17 2015 UTC,Mine hasn't but I'm not sure if my card was charged for it. I recently had someone return a payment I sent to them via Paypal and that doesn't even show up on my card. So maybe it should've shipped? Idk. Same is going with Dr.Mario and Amazon.de right now. It keeps trying to charge my card but it can't because there isn't enough on it even though I bought it when the card did have enough. I think I would've gotten it by now if it wasn't for this.

For a Visa gift card, you'd have to see if the conversion for the Bowser Jr to Canadian plus the shipping from France would even be within $25.

AmiiboCanada,3e5r1o,RPGAdjective,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:09:11 2015 UTC,Palutena. As Amazon.ca gift cards only work on Amazon Canada. I checked my gift card funds on the french site and it's 0.00.  Also you can check your estimated total amount for Palutena by putting the regular Super Mario amiibo in your cart and editing your cart.
AmiiboCanada,3e5r1o,Cody645,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:03:36 2015 UTC,Get Palutena. I have a feeling that Bowser Jr. could be found in stores with no problem.
AmiiboCanada,3e5r1o,Tridon64,-1,Wed Jul 22 05:42:00 2015 UTC,Found in one store.
AmiiboCanada,3e5r1o,oooooooooomg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:35:09 2015 UTC,I'm almost 100% sure since Bowser Jr. is a mario character he won't be rare (don't quote me on that though)

Honestly though, it worked, I got him in pristine condition.   His mask is meant to be a bit dirty looking in random spots to add a rough, weathered look to him as if he just fought.  Not sure if you mean like on top of his head though"
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,Helixium,0,Wed Jul 22 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why they didn't leave it at my door, when the dude brought them from the back I was like wtf, I did only order two right?  I meant on the horn things above his face basically."
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,GreenMallard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:06:20 2015 UTC,It's supposed to look like brushed metal if you're reffering to his mask?  What does Target have to do with it though?  Confused by this.

You're one of the lucky ones though - almost all my Best Buy stuff comes horrible even in the big boxes.   Have you gotten other trashed stuff from them or is it usually good?  By the way, do you have the box number?  MD01 etc.  It's on the side."
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,JustMoth,0,Wed Jul 22 04:24:15 2015 UTC,Every online amiibo order I've gotten has been near perfect. No issues at all.
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,GreenMallard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:26:34 2015 UTC,You are lucky. What about the number of the side of the box? I am just curious what they are packing in. They stuff three of mine clearly in a box for 2 and five in a box for 3 or so much packing paper they crush the bubble.
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,GreenMallard,0,Wed Jul 22 04:28:16 2015 UTC,MD06
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,GreenMallard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yup!  Just got my Meta Knight in the same huge box too. Wallmart mastered efficient packing with 4 amiibos fitting perfectly in a little box, while BB seems to be going overboard on room. I guess stores have taken then hint that amiibo collectors can get a little vocal about damaged packaging."
AmiiboCanada,3e5p8k,GreenMallard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:21:23 2015 UTC,What box number was it?  It's an MD(Number) on the side.

Just bought a second charizard to paint him yellow, and even without the mods of the actual model, it is very hard to paint without getting things messy.

Ill give a few examples   On ebay, I saw some spray paints of gold or silver colors over common characters for like 60 USD. I saw model edits of characters also for around 60 USD The one time I saw a charizard like that it cost 100 USD"

AmiiboCanada,3e3uno,StimulatorCam,3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:20 2015 UTC,$25 isn't necessarily unreasonable. If you buy online at retail and have to pay for shipping (typically $4-$8 depending on retailer) you're usually at around $22 minimum after tax anyways.
AmiiboCanada,3e3uno,socialcocoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:08 2015 UTC,true.. why sell it though? it's pac-man; he's pretty common. Most people can just go to their local walmart and buy him

When shit was going down and orders were getting cancelled, a lot of people ordered the whole wave from different retailers. The ideal would be to sell them for exactly $22 bucks or whatever, but 25 is reasonable for the trouble or whatever. I do understand that the whole thing contributed to the shortage, but most people that have complete collections did have backups and it's silly to pretend otherwise, right?"

AmiiboCanada,3e3uno,Akagami1,3,Tue Jul 21 19:28:41 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, that's not too bad; say you lived in a country where the sales tax was 60%, plus the shipping to your country was $14, plus there was an import fee of $5, plus there was a 30% ($4.80) surcharge on specifically amiibo in that country; you would actually be saving 62 cents on that deal!"

AmiiboCanada,3e247g,Bendilin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:39 2015 UTC,My primary purpose for hunting was just to get the figs for use in SSB but the chase definitely gets into your blood. At first I was only going after a few key characters for games which I had but as I continued to score rares my collection got closer and closer to a full set until only commons were left out.   That's when the OCD kicked in. ;)

AmiiboCanada,3e247g,hilariousness123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:05 2015 UTC,"Because it is so hard to find basically any amiibo, I don't think you really can separate the journey and destination. We all have stories to tell about how we got each amiibo. It's just the nature of the situation we find ourselves in.  Anyone who says they're not in it for the rush associated with the hunt, is not being completely honest. In a perfect world (with ample stock of everything) this community would have zero reason to exist. If we were able to collect them at our own pace, lots of us wouldn't have nearly as large of a collection as we do now.  Therefore if I had to choose one, it would be the journey. Without the hunt associated with each amiibo I own, two-thirds of them wouldn't mean as much to me as they do right now."

AmiiboCanada,3dzil0,LightningStarSC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"Officially depends on their edge card level (can be 48 hours to a week).  I've also had my local store tell me they give their frequent customers extra time (this was long ago before amiibo were even announced and I was hunting for a circle pad pro) since they know they're going to come and get it anyway.  This is unofficial/not policy.  I don't know if you'll have much of a case since you can't prove when stock arrived/the edge card level of the person who is still waiting for their preorder.  There's also the possibility they still had 20 preorders and got 10 figures in, so even if Person 1 doesn't pick it up it would move to person 11, 12, 13 and so on until someone gets it or they move through their list."

The amiibo's are not region locked so I doubt there would be any issues with those. As for the accessory id say it lean toward being region free aswell.

AmiiboCanada,3dzxxs,amiibo3_141592653589,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"That being said, I think it might be Mewtwo as his amiibo was on display at SDCC and he was coming out ""this holiday"" with Falco. Falco's CPSIA was just released a short while ago and Mewtwo was going to be released with him, so maybe ""this holiday"" is not specific because its referring to a different holiday that's coming sooner?

It's going to be hard for a bit, but you never know if a restock is around the corner. This last one wasn't expected at first, so if demand spikes again there may be more made. Keep an eye out at your local stores for spontaneous restocks, this reddit for online restocks and info, and if you want to go full in, there's page monitors or importing. So far all mine were MSRP, so it is possible. If you see Rares in store, you can always trade extras on amiiboswap for ones you want, but dont be a scalper. That's all I believe, and good luck!"
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,pandoraspeaks,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"You will not be able to. You just missed a ton of restocks on the rare sand unicorns. Alternatively, all the amiibos that have been release thus far will work out to around 800 dollars at MSRP. So think long and hard before you get into this craziness."
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,skotua,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:07 2015 UTC,Rare sand unicorns? I want me some of those ones!

AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,skotua,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:02 2015 UTC,Run. Don't open your wallet.  Run far and run fast.
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,DonmeccaYYZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you can't. You can be diligent and find most of them, especially commons and uncommons for MSRP, but there are some that you just won't, unless you find a re-stock.  Some of the Smash amiibo you'll have to import at a higher cost (such as Greninja, Lucario, Meta Knight, as far as I can tell), and some you'll just need to scope out re-stocks and flickers on websites, as well as go in to stores, often."
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Smillzer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I probably should have joined in the amiibo hype much earlier. Are there any websites where I can import those amiibo for a fairly decent price?
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Smillzer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"People generally look at Tenso, AmiAmi, and European amazon sites. I've bought from amazon.fr, and have been looking at purchasing from amazon.de and amazon.it depending on the amiibo."
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Jerk_Colander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:41 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll make sure to bookmark and monitor these sites
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,DariusQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:25 2015 UTC,Without spending much MSRP you will need a TON of luck of being in the right place in the right 30 second-5 minute window.
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,AmiiiiboGirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:09 2015 UTC,This exact thing just happened to me. Well sort of. My local EB was supposed to get a reshipment of Ness but it never arrived. They're also sold out of Shulk. I'm now dead on the inside.
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,DariusQ,0,Mon Jul 20 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"Uh, you can't? Even at MSRP collecting the SSB Amiibos alone are a ridiculous amount of money because there are so many of them (53 and counting). Getting them isn't impossible anymore but you're going to be spending a bundle either way."
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Helixium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:09 2015 UTC,ok good to know. But can you answer my question about what the best and most efficient way to collect amiibo is?
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Helixium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm also a new collector! I started collecting amiibos about 2-3 weeks ago and I have been luckily able to get quite a few with the help of this reddit community and monitoring bestbuy.ca/wal-mart.ca. Actually, this community is really helpful!  Since starting 2-3 weeks ago i have already got 18 amiibos. 4 of which are for a buddy of mine. the rest are opened and on display with the exception of 4 that I am not sure about yet. I also wanted to collect all of them at first but realized that it would be really expensive so i've opted to collect the characters I really like. My advice is to never pay over MSRP and to check this reddit and other websites daily. It is definitely possible to collect all of them since there has been restocks happening periodically. Hope that helps! :) TLDR; Even though you are a new collector, you can still manage to get all of them if you monitor this reddit and other sites. Never pay over MSRP"
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:30 2015 UTC,Online is probably best. Keep an eye on these forums for when Walmart/Amazon/TRU have restocks of Amiibos and be ready to order quickly. For rarer/exclusive figs I'd suggest importing from Japan from places like Amiami or Tenso. Cost of importing has gone down considerably so you'll only be spending a little more over MSRP.
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,Jerk_Colander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:39 2015 UTC,Yeah so I've been told. It's definitely some good advice and I'm definitely going to pay attention to these sites.
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,30hanman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"You will be spending, quite literally, hundreds of dollars no matter how diligent you are unfortunately lol. Take 56 characters at $18.07 each, you get $1,011. Now add in those Yarn Yoshi and you're close to breaking $1,100. This is assuming you get every single one at MSRP.  I would budget yourself and only get the characters you like at this point if you don't want to spend a ton of money. I know the thrill of amiibo when you get your first few, and you want to get them all, but your wallet won't be thrilled one bit.  It all depends on your financial situation and what your sensitivity is to discretionary spending on figurines. I just advise to not act impulsively on these things because you WILL end up regretting it if you're not well off financially."
AmiiboCanada,3dyfmh,ShaunSXXX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:18 2015 UTC,Thats what I am currently planning. i just really want a ness amiibo as he is one of my mains and i can't find a yoshi one anywhere.

Yoshi is a bit hard to find lately but hopefully they will have a restock of him at some point, but check Kijiji because people may be selling him for an okay price since he's still not considered thaat rare."

I've seen a complete amiibo set for sale a couple of months back, complete wave 1 through 3, for 300$. They where all opened, but honestly that's how they should be displayed (so many people keep them unopened in the box, IMO the value of amiibo's won't be going up that much in the near future : especially if they re-release more, and I'm sure they will). Of course, this listing was sold within the hour, so you have to check (obsessively) frequently.  Best of luck"

AmiiboCanada,3dxrse,Tallyburger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"That may depend on what kind of shipping method you chose. I used EMS before, and needed to sign for the package through Canada Post. It arrived quickly, but still used local services instead of UPS or Fedex or any of those kinds of delivery services. I'm unsure if methods that are cheaper than EMS require signatures or not, but that could very well determine whether they leave it at your door or not.  I suppose it also depends on your neighborhood as well. For myself, we're getting community boxes soon, but in the meantime, they still deliver to our doors by default. Starting in August, Canada Post will deliver to the boxes first, then our door if necessary."
AmiiboCanada,3dxrse,TheAx-Man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:30:10 2015 UTC,"I did pick EMS, since it really was the best deal for the price / time. So alright, I'll make sure that someone is ready for the door later this week then. Thank you :)    My neighbourhood has had the boxes for as long as I can remember.

AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Tridon64,4,Mon Jul 20 02:45:12 2015 UTC,I would make people post either their collection (if it looks organized like a real collector would or if its just scattered across the floor) or ask them to send a pic of a level 50 with them in the picture.
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,ultrasuperman1001,5,Mon Jul 20 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'll play devils advocate and disagree with the bending option because whether or not someone is an OOB or NIB collector should not be the issue. I personally have both an OOB and NIB because I see the appeal of both. You limit the possibility by at least 50% of giving an amiibo to an honest collector. In truth, the bending way does avoid scalpers but for those NIB who actually are not scalpers and might need the amiibo, that isn't a fair option. Like another poster said, play it by ear. If you have a good feeling about them, good. If you end up seeing an ad on your local kijiji or on this reddit with your amiibo at a hiked up price, that's life. The important thing is you had good intentions."

AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,lordpizzapop,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:30 2015 UTC,"For an OOB collector, the other suggestions are great. For an in box, that's a bit more difficult. Maybe ask casually which others are in their collection, or just hunting stories. Scalpers are more for money and value rather than finally getting their main, or completing their collection. Play it by ear. If they only seem interested without wanting to chat about collecting (because lets be honest, its pretty much all collectors want to talk about xD), they may just be looking to turn a profit.

I get why a lot of people wouldn't want to this though. I plan to use it in smash and their appropriate games :)

AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Rastor-M,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info and a lot of helpful advise here. Just want to give these amiibo a good and loving home ;)
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,luemasify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:32 2015 UTC,If you're ever in a store and see somebody buying a common chances are they aren't a scalper. Unless they're a really dumb one.
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Rastor-M,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:29 2015 UTC,So you're saying it would be safe to sell it to them as they would not likely be a scalper for that reason?
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,luemasify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:39:57 2015 UTC,Ya. Although chances of just so happening to see somebody buy a common amiibo is pretty unlikely unless it's a launch day or you work in a retail store that sell's amiibo.
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Rastor-M,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"If you really want it to go to a kid, I'd have to agree with others here and say to bend the box (most kids shouldn't care anyways if they're going to open it). Alternatively, you could also get a permanent marker and cover the barcode of the back so it looks like a solid black box. Or maybe write something cheeky on the bottom of the box? This way the box is undamaged but I imagine it would be soiled enough to deter scalpers. On the other hand it would also deter NIB collectors but hey if you're a NIB collector, tough luck. /u/Tridon64 is trying to do the community a favour and servicing that population of collectors doesn't (to me) seem to be worth the risk of having it end up in the hands of a scalper. Also kudos for what you're trying to do"
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:43 2015 UTC,I sold an extra Marth to a kid once. He showed up with his dad. The kid was very excited that it was a NA box. Some kids care even though they won't scalp it
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,McHaro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:44 2015 UTC,Well it'll still be NA NIB amiibo it'll just have a crease it in making it deter scalpers and probably NIB collectors too. But if it's a kid receiving it - assuming they're like most kids and will open the box to actually play with the toy - then a crease in the cardboard shouldn't be an issue once it's opened and possibly discarded
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,Rastor-M,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:44 2015 UTC,And if you went into a store and they did that after scanning your amiibo? I just don't think it's right. It makes no difference to me since I'm not buying it anyways but I don't like the idea of it. That's just me though
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,toronto_ag12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"Why are you comparing a retail location that is impartial to who purchases their product and OP who IS partial to whom purchases what they're selling? There's a fundamental difference between buying a brand new one from a store and buying one from someone who's bought it, and wants to get it off their hands with the intent of it going to a collector or kid and not a scalper. This user is trying to do the community a favour and you don't like the idea of bending the cardboard to deter certain buyers? That's fine we're all entitled to our opinions but you can't get always get everything you want the way you want it (I know you're not interested in OP's particular amiibo but it's the principle I'm talking about). OP is trying to go out of their own way to help some people out and OP's options are either to slightly damage the box and resell to someone, return it to the store undamaged, or resell it undamaged to someone but the last two options run the risk of it ending up in the hands of scalpers - it's that simple. Either that or OP can just pretend it's damaged in the ad when it really isn't so scalpers won't be attracted to his/her ad"
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,JustMoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:12 2015 UTC,"I went into an EB games and asked about Shulk. They asked me if I was ok with a used one out of the box. I said yes, and they gave me a perfect condition one in a box. They were trying to avoid scalpers getting them. Therefore, I ask you.... would you have been ok with a store that actually does care about scalpers getting the amiibos damaging your product?"
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,bubblesrocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:33 2015 UTC,Sell them as open box.

AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,lordpizzapop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't get why'd you damage it... why not just say in the ad that the box is damaged? Then when you show up, sell them one that isn't damaged. They'll be happy and a scalper won't buy one they think is damaged"
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,cfs3corsair,0,Mon Jul 20 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"lmao you people are ridiculous, you honestly would bend the cardboard to potentially ruin the amiibo for NIB collector..this thread is slowly going to shit with all these assholes shaming people who have doubles of ""unicorns"" or accusing people of scalping"
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,AwesomeMunchies,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, was going to say basically the same thing but a couple people already beat me to it.  Slight variation then. Damage the box (like fold the card board in half), since no one would pay scalper prices for a damaged box, and OoB collectors would still have the fun of opening the box themselves."
AmiiboCanada,3dwgvt,PikaJaune,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you should just make a slight bend on the corner of the box, because opening the amiibo is one of the greatest parts"

And same I just couldn't afford upholding two collections at such a caliber so I had to make a decision. Funko or amiibo? amiibo won.

Toys R Us seems to have a much better selection, including the 6"" figures. My Toys R Us used to have a horrible selection, and then one day they basically decided to start stocking everything. They also seem to update their inventory more frequently. Sadly though, I have yet to see a Samus myself. They're supposed to be releasing another version of Samus in the future, though."

I really want to get those 3 consoles mentioned before in their boxes, but man, it's eating up my wallet. I also have almost every heavy hitter game for the Nintendo 64, except for Mario Party 3 and Banjo-Tooie. I've yet to come across a gold cart of Ocarina of Time for a good price. I remember saying I wouldn't get into amiibos because they were going to be incredibly hectic, but look at me now. After the unicorn restocks, I'm back up to par!

AmiiboCanada,3duuxq,DemyxTheCax,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:51 2015 UTC,"Palutena is Amazon exclusive, preorders went up but there should more available when she is released (24th of this month). Dark pit is the 31st available online at best buy and Walmart, online only it seems like."
AmiiboCanada,3duuxq,Hold_the_pickles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:52 2015 UTC,"Amazon slipped up and released palutena on Friday night, but there will be more. Dark pit sounds like mostly online and not exclusive"
AmiiboCanada,3duuxq,yycamiibo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:06 2015 UTC,Dark Pit isn't exclusive and the only places that have it in store on July 31st is EBGames and TRU.  Amazon put up Palutena pre orders a few days ago without warning after telling us that there would be a warning on July 22nd about when she'd go live. She is supposed to release July 24th as an online only amiibo. It is unknown when or if Amazon will put up more.
AmiiboCanada,3duuxq,The_Beebat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:51 2015 UTC,Do you have proof that TRU and EB are in store?
AmiiboCanada,3duuxq,TheWebbler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:42 2015 UTC,TRU always sell amiibo in store and a few online. No news for ebgames i'm still trying to get Dark Pit ID.

AmiiboCanada,3du2jf,cluckis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:39 2015 UTC,Never used tenso myself but from what I understand the packing is extremely good.
AmiiboCanada,3du2jf,hilariousness123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"They package great, if you get damaged goods, it's most likely because Tenso received them damaged."
AmiiboCanada,3du2jf,Blackened15,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:12:44 2015 UTC,It's good packaging. I've never received anything damaged or creased.
AmiiboCanada,3du2jf,The_Beebat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:10 2015 UTC,Their packaging is top tier. Your stuff will arrive fine and yeah as it's been said already if you get anything damaged it wasn't them.
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,GhettoSnail,5,Mon Jul 20 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"""Also, we have a lot more stock than we've had of any other amiibo yet. I know we'll end up selling out, but I think it'll be closer to the Splatoon 3-pack or Charizard or something rather than Lucina/Robin in terms of how long they're available (~15 mins after available). If you show up on time, you should be able to get one.""   -Amazon Josh  Personally hope this is true for Canada too, not too sure."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,ekevinn,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, but a lot of us missed that random unannounced time frame sadly."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,Blu167,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:52 2015 UTC,Also no limit per customer. Scalpers rejoiced.
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,ElfmanLV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:14:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to cry from laughter if Amazon sold all their stock this past Friday on .CA and has nothing left for the actual release date.  And that most .CA collectors who missed out because scalpers bought Palutena in bulk end up going to .COM as well and buy out their stock along with the US minimizing that ""prediction"" from AmazonJosh to more like 5 minutes. Two countries buying from one pool of stock simultaneously."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,TLKv3,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:52 2015 UTC,I hope you're dead wrong.
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,Cody645,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe perfect in box because it is the first online only and it is amazon shipping, but the US should be getting a decent amount and the preorders lasted for 40-50 minutes"
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,hilariousness123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. Amazon said that they were doubling/tripling production after the first few waves. But that being said, Palutena hasn't gotten off to a great start. Simply because of the high demand for her especially, I think she will go rare/unicorn after 2-3 months regardless"
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,cfs3corsair,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"The fact that there are only two in this wave would mean that instead of production time being split among 5-6 amiibos. It's only 2. Which should mean there will be ALOT more than a typical release. Not to mention palutena was up for at least an hour or more when she was up. Likely with more on the way. And with her being Amazon exclusive means that ALL the stock will be in one place and we don't have to check 20 places.   I say, no worries, pretty sure that everyone that wants one will have one and there will be a fair sized window to do so."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,UltimaGrant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"I think what might also come into play here is that maybe not every average amiibo collector will even know that Palutena is an Amazon exclusive because it's a bit obscure and online only. They may be the kind of collectors who just line up on release day normally to get their amiibo.   I say this because I noticed quite a few people who lined up with for Greninja had no idea Jiggly puff was a Walmart exclusive even (thought it was a USA exclusive lol) and they seemed like amiibo fanatics, but don't seem to keep tabs on all information online about amiibo. I told them and they were like crap, and rushed over to the Walmart next door afterwards lol."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,Helixium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:46 2015 UTC,"I figure they would have about as many as TRU canada had of Greninja (50-100 per store multiplied by 80+ stores), but since it will be in all one place everyone will have an equal shot at getting them. They will sell out in a few hours, but not before a large majority of amiibo fans get theirs, and driving competition down for any future restocks.   Unless they let you buy more than one. Then scalpers will buy hundreds at once and destroy any chance of normal people getting them."
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,JustMoth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:40 2015 UTC,Doubt it. Reprints are a happening thing now. I suspect this will be followed up with a couple waves of releases if demand is there. Just look at how Ness quickly restocked to meet demand.
AmiiboCanada,3dw6aa,CoryBoehm,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"I sure hope not, after the idiocy of amazon actions on friday night though, maybe."

Not really sure the exact day though. Also 5b has already gone up for pre-order so I'm not sure if there will be another chance to get them or not. Im new to importing so I don't know if amazon japan saves some for release day or just put's them all up in one go during pre-orders.

AmiiboCanada,3dsitx,coolestguyintheroom,4,Sun Jul 19 01:07:37 2015 UTC,"So, I kept missing the metaknight restock, so I wrote up a quick tampermonkey/greasemonkey script to monitor the pages for me. I got a metaknight using it, so I can vouch for it working (http://i.imgur.com/UWJCfnC.png)! It should work on all bestbuy.ca amiibo pages. To use it, you need Tampermonkey on Chrome. Then you need to install this script, and open the page. Test it out on an amiibo that's already in stock after you install. If you need help using it, I'm here!  Basically, this script will check to see if the add to cart button on the amiibo page is disabled. If it's not, it'll play a little sound. The script will also refresh the page every 15 seconds, and run again. Now you can just wait for the ding, then go!   I also used the compare bug on bestbuy to add metaknight to the cart before he was available.   Edit: Added photo for proof"

The Billy bookcase from IKEA is 75cm wide and these are around 37cm each, so they fit perfectly and can hold 18 amiibo with no problems.

And Smash 4 isn't Melee, man; a lot of characters are viable, otherwise Top 8 wouldn't have had 7 different ones (ultimately 8 if you count the final where Diddy was used). ZeRo could honestly have won this with his Falcon or Sheik (be thankful it wasn't a ditto Sheik final at least) but who can blame him for playing it safe in Smash 4's first EVO final? Also, calling him a whiner is really a moot statement when you consider how hard he's fought for and helped the Smash 4 community in the past 10 months. One look at his YouTube channel and you can tell he's an advocate for all styles of play."

I got Junior, Both Nintendo themed ones. and the old school Pokemon one with Ash on the front and whatnot.   Only complaint, I know someone who's too good at the game and almost always stalls 1 game for 2-4 hours at a time.   For example, he doesn't trade properties unless it makes him get the better deal EVEN WHEN all the properties are bought out... which eventually gets my other friends to fall for his dumb trades, Cause they are BORED of waiting for the game to move on.

Amazon.ca sold out of Palutena without notifying a single human being, despite having the option to be notified by email, yet still managed to sell out.  I am so glad this shit storm of a trainwreck experience is over soon. I'm going to assume a similar shafting will occur for Dark Pit.

Just talked to a CSR whom said they messed up and now have no stock for the release date and they cannot cancel orders. Hopefully he is full of shit but I honestly wouldn't doubt it since Amazon Josh said Charizard amounts of stock and we all know how much they got of him.  Also, perfect timing for me to be actually too sick to check on this place for a couple hours."

AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,ianisteal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:30:15 2015 UTC,They don't need to do anything and sitting here bitching won't do anything. What makes you think that all of their stock went online? It didn't stay up long enough for this to be all of their stock. Just wait and be patient.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Rastor-M,2,Sat Jul 18 13:34:00 2015 UTC,What made me think that was all their stock? Because apparently loads people ordered more than one due to spamming the checkout button when site was lagging and .ca didn't have the once per person/account policy.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,ianisteal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm personally not bitching I'm just stating my opinion and so is ianisteal. Besides I don't have any reason to; my cousin got me one and himself one.

You are wrong though, this is bitching with a sense of entitlement ""They need to cancel all palutena orders""  This translates to, I want them to cancel all their orders so that I can get one.  Stating an opinion would be ""This sucks. I would've liked to get one."""
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Rastor-M,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest I guess I can see where you're coming from, but Amazon specifically stated they wanted it to be fair and equal ground, but putting them for preorder at 12 in the morning isn't fair and putting them without warning isn't fair. Though I still see your point, just because they messed up they don't need to cancel all orders."

Amazon also lists it on their site and the Nintendo amiibo site here clearly says that Dark Pit is exclusive at Best Buy in the US. Whereas Palutena says US & Canada exclusively at Amazon. These are pretty strong indicators Dark Pit is not an exclusive in Canada."

AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,AmiiboManTO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:02:24 2015 UTC,People need to realize that they will have a lot.  Nintendo is sending every last Palutena made for Canada straight to Amazon. This isn't being split up by 5 major retailers and people have the opportunity to order from 5 different places and be safe in getting them that way.  You order one from Amazon and for the most part thats the end of it.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Brothanigus3232,2,Sat Jul 18 04:18:17 2015 UTC,"ugh. Have you not been amiibo ""hunting"" for the past 3 months?"

AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,ShadowzI,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:32 2015 UTC,Yes I just checked and chatted with several user and csr... there is no limit... that's not right
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:46:03 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Was able to order 12 before I was convinced system is bad. Cancelled all but 2 that me and a buddy need.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Doshy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:08 2015 UTC,Wasn't it announced it'd be one per customer before though? I'm sure they'll get it sorted.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"I assume so. I figured I'd try to get the second one for my buddy and when that worked I thought well this doesn't seem right, so I tried to see what the system would allow. Have since cancelled all but the 2 I needed because that's an expensive order o.o"
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Forrester777,2,Sat Jul 18 03:50:23 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'd caution ordering 2 is they do tend to (eventually) enforce the one per person/household thing.  Some people have had BOTH of their orders cancelled (as recent as the last unicorn re-stock) for ordering more than one. Amazon wouldn't even let them keep one.  Not saying that will happen to you, but I only order 1 and don't touch it, just to be on the safe side."
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"Oh good to know, thanks for the save Forrester. I'll tell my friend to get one himself, I'm not risking my own lol."

AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Hm, Amazon rep just said I'm fine. Guess they're not limiting this one?"
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,GreenMallard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:59 2015 UTC,So did you end up cancelling it?  I ordered one for a friend who doesn't have a Credit Card since it let me but don't want them to cancel both.
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"I kept 2, one for a friend and one for me. Amazon rep said I was fine and will be emailed to adjust if something changes."
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,GreenMallard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:30:41 2015 UTC,Did you call or e-mail them?
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Forrester777,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"When they update their website later they'll change it and reserve the right to limit them to 1. It wouldn't make sense to limit every amiibo figure, but not Palutena. That's just my thinking, anyway."
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,TheXantar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"Though since it's an exclusive to them, their stock must be insane. So maybe they're less concerned? Dunno. Hard to guess :/"
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,Doshy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:22:57 2015 UTC,Yeah that sure is strange but nobody expected this to go live right now anyways so it's probably safe to say it's not all the way it should be yet.

AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,NastyPl0t,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:05:57 2015 UTC,"The difference with that situation was people were forcing their way  through the system. Amazon themselves put up the preorders for realzies in this case, it wasn't a glitch. I don't see them canceling."
AmiiboCanada,3dp6v8,ianisteal,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:27:44 2015 UTC,"The case here is they fully announced a set date in which she will go up.

Be fair ffs, some of us didn't even have the chance to purchase her... and in order to be fair, they should cancel all palutena orders placed before July 24 (since that's when they said it will go up, not 6 days prior...) -.-"

No big deal, but then later on this sub, there was a post saying they were selling a few of them.

We are known by name pretty well with most of the employees there. I go in during the shulk restock and ask if I can grab 2 for my buddy and I. At first he said no. But then I told him who he was  and he immediately recognized me as a acual collector and was nice enough to let me have 2 instead of struggling to find another one.

A pharmacist wouldn't sell you rubbing alcohol if he/she thought you were going to drink it,c or a whole case of cold medicine (you are probably going to cook meth with it).

Pharmacy is different. There are actual laws in place for the SAFETY and WELL-BEING of individuals and the Pharmacist has the power to refuse the sale. That being said, there's a bunch of pharmacy's you can go to and buy cases of that stuff. Either way, you can't compare Pharmacy with Amiibos.   The only instances where I can understand an EB employee refusing a sale would be if there's a 1 per customer limit, or if the item is a pre-order item. Other than that, I see no legislative law in place giving them the right to refuse sale."

AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,shinx457,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"this is why I suggested Amazon to cancel all Pauletina orders (again, similar to what bestbuy did due to people abusing checkout glitch) and for some odd reason, i'm being downvoted like mad.

AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,ianisteal,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:51 2015 UTC,"Don't fret it. It's just people who most likely got one because of the glitch who don't want to let go of an amiibo. I don't understand why people are not ok with things being fair but it's basically how this big world runs round. First Toys r us releasing greninja early now this.

If Amazon didn't announce a specific date as to when it's available, no one would bitch because That's how these amiibo stock works. If Amazon still have sufficient stock left to sell on 24th, they don't need to do anything, but if let say they already sold 30-50% of their stock...they need to do something."

AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,zekev3,0,Sat Jul 18 06:06:35 2015 UTC,"Since there are no orders placed through site or system manipulation, they're not going to cancel the orders already placed. That's clear and I agree with you on that point. There will be additional stock between now and the 24th and their customer service seem to be sticking with the statement that is listed on the product page (which I referenced earlier). It's very unlikely that they changed their minds when it's listed in plain sight and this is just an error related to them adding the items to their system.  I don't cry or whine about this. Missing order windows is par for the course when you're trying to get these collectibles."
AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,UnderworldSoup,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:12 2015 UTC,She stopped selling about 5 minutes ago and we already have at least 1 person who's aware and upset.  Amazon has no idea what they've just done.

AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,NoMoreExclusives,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:36:23 2015 UTC,I doubt that was all the Palutenas available. I would like to think that an exclusive to amazon would have more than that measly stock available. Look how plentiful Greninja was to TRU stores.
AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,Forrester777,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:50 2015 UTC,"There will, without a doubt, be plenty more available."

AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,Blu167,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:10:58 2015 UTC,I hope they do before they ship. They sorta had things going right when they imposed a one per person during the restock but this is just Ri Ri.
AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,NoMoreExclusives,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:15:31 2015 UTC,I think they will and I think that there will definitely have more stock.
AmiiboCanada,3dpft3,Blu167,2,Sat Jul 18 09:39:01 2015 UTC,"Man the amount of hate they will get if this was all their stock. I know I'm one who'll send them a tweet with my opinion on things. I have little faith in Amazon.ca having more stock since so many sold tonight (I mean just look at the stats for the palutena thread) and with there being no limit today is just yikes. I talked to two different people through the live chat who both finally said ""sorry"" and that it was their entire stock and that they ""sold out early"". I'll admit I'm salty about it but I still have Amazon US. It's just extremely not cool what they did and they should know better and if it was an honest glitch they should treat it that way and cancel orders but I don't expect them to since they probably see it just as early sales that don't hurt anything and don't even come close to realizing the harm they are causing some people. This stresses people out big time when they are told something and then another happens and it will turn people off of using Amazon.ca.  Sorry for the long post I just needed to rant a little /rant ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  I wonder if that lenny bot will find this post since reddit is cracking down on spam and all."

They flickered a lot but only had about 10 minutes where you were able to get them. I think amazon will cancel multiple orders, and limit it to 1 or 2 per household.  On the topic of it being not cool, I totally agree. You shouldn't tell the people you're not doing preorders then put them up a couple days later. ESPECIALLY with no limit!!

I'm not mad at people who were able to get them and I feel that's why people may be down voting others who say they should be cancelled. I'm just disappointed in Amazon really. We need an ambassador from Amazon Canada, I should really contact them about that. I would do it for free just as long as they kept me updated so I could keep you all updated. You know I'll look into that."

AmiiboCanada,3dpf59,Shmeediddy,2,Sat Jul 18 04:28:50 2015 UTC,Lesson here:  Amazon.ca and Amazon.com clearly don't release their shit at the same time. That post about the pre-orders going up next week was bs.
AmiiboCanada,3dpf59,zyltis,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:22 2015 UTC,it was amazon.com making that post. amazon.ca if you haven't noticed is a completely different entity (which is why we got unicorns restocked and amazon.com did not).
AmiiboCanada,3dpf59,iLLNiSS,-7,Sat Jul 18 05:37:14 2015 UTC,They need to cancel all palutena orders placed today...like how bestbuy did for wave 4 glitch orders
AmiiboCanada,3dpf59,ianisteal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a glitch, it went live. with bestbuy it was people exploiting certain parts of the website. The people who pre-ordered today all ordered it directly from the palutena sale page, how it's ment to be. and the fact that it was flickering means that amazon was continually restocking and entering in new units as they were being bought.  try to to condemn others because you're mad about not getting one when they did."
AmiiboCanada,3dpf59,UltimaGrant,0,Sat Jul 18 05:37:24 2015 UTC,"i am extremely pissed/mad at the moment. The fact that some of us didn't even get a chance to purchase her is bullshit.

This would lead anyone to believe that it would have gone up on July 24th. On top of that, Palutena wasn't one per customer but yet every other amiibo is."

AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,AnswerThrowaway2015,5,Sat Jul 18 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"If you feel that Amazon made a huge mistake, then feel free to return your preorder.  There are two issues:  The first issue is that they should be held accountable on flat-out lying to their customers.  The second issue is that they are actually dumb enough to post up a large chunk of their stock."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,AmiiboGyroto,-4,Sat Jul 18 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"They may not necessarily be lying on all accounts. It's true that they lied by having preorders, but they may also release them as stated before."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ObscurionPaul,5,Sat Jul 18 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"I get you, but you even admitted to having gotten a preorder, so you can sit back and be calm about it, because now it doesn't matter to you.  Screaming and whining is childish, yeah, but I haven't seen a whole lot of meltdowns here over this. It's mostly people being frustrated at the constant bullshit we ALL have to go through at one time or another for these things we all really like. You get a handful of ""I quit"" posts or whatever, but mostly I've just seen people reaching a point where they genuinely are losing interest in dealing with this shit. That bums me out, because this shouldn't be something we all sweat and stress about. It shouldn't be something that makes us angry and frustrated. You can't blame people for getting upset, because here's yet another reason we all needed to be on guard at stupid hours and it's ridiculous.   Those of us who, god forbid, weren't hanging around a computer or our phone last night missed out. Will we get another chance? I'm going to say 100% for sure we will, but with Amiibo there's always a doubt. The majority of us have been screwed by retailer incompetence before, we'll all probably get screwed again, which is why so many people overreact or have a doubt in their mind when it comes to this stuff.  I understand you probably mean well, but it's a shitty situation however you slice it and just because you feel like it's ""not that bad"" doesn't really give you the right to tell people how to feel."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ianisteal,0,Sat Jul 18 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Actually thinking about it, maybe the anger derives from a deeper problem. Amazons practically giving us the middle finger and saying ""we don't give a **** about you, we make all the money anyways"" and that they're being driven by capitalism. And the fact that they can't do anything about it allowing Amazon to be a bunch of capitalist pigs."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ianisteal,0,Sat Jul 18 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Good post. I think what made matters worse was the fact that Amazon also announced a set date as to when it will go live. Wave 4 was crazy, but at least the retailers exclusive went live on the day retailer said it would..."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ianisteal,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:29 2015 UTC,Well to be fair no ones really given a reason to be mad. Sure they missed on a preorder at 12 at night. Most likely won't affect the actual sales as previously explained. The only way it'll affect them is that there'll be less stock on that day. The same amount of less stock as there'll be less people trying to get it on that day.
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ianisteal,4,Sat Jul 18 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Amazon.ca isn't reinforcing the one per account/person rule (Amazon CS is the source). People have already gotten more than one, they will now get a chance to order more for trade bait/scalp."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,ianisteal,0,Sat Jul 18 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Then again, I've seen posts saying that Amazon has reinforced the 1/account rule in the past completely canceling orders that were over one of a certain amiibo (which is bs as well, why not just cancel the extras) so they might solve that problem. Best to just hope Amazon patches up this problem"
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,UltimateClones,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"But hey, if people want to be mad for no good reason that's their problem."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,AnswerThrowaway2015,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"You said in your own post you snag one, if you were to miss it too, would you have said the same? I like your initial intension, but people do have a legitimate reason to be mad at Amazon. After all they did say 24th (still on their site) and not one person received their bullcrap email alert."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,inferno84,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Well, let's assume that this preorder doesn't affect what they're originally said, they only lied on the account of having no preorders. Let's also assume they'll fix the problem of people ordering more than one ( which Amazon also lied about not having) then all the people still get their email alerts, the information, time window, and all that Amazon originally said all the same. You could argue there'll be less stock, but there'll also be less people trying to order her on the day of release, and Amazon can still fix the problem of people ordering more than one."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,Cosmos_Man,2,Sat Jul 18 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"But we're just assuming...fact is, as of now people did manage to order more than one and there will probably be people who will order extras. Hopefully we hear more from Amazon soon..."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,inferno84,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why I say, instead of complaining when We haven't gotten to the date Amazon stated they'd release palutena or send out emails; wait for those days and if you don't get your email or your palutena orders then go ahead and complain"

In my opinion this could be the hardest to find/rarest Amiibo yet considering it will never hit a physical store and the fact that Amazon is known for midnight releases. It will be out of reach for the people who actually have to work or do something with their lives besides F5ing for these figures."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,AnswerThrowaway2015,3,Sat Jul 18 16:35:34 2015 UTC,that's why I liked the dates since it gives people a chance to plan but putting them up a week before defeats that

AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,Drift-AE86,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think everyone who got a Palutena from Amazon last night just hit F5 and do nothing else.

AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,doctorofstyle,2,Sat Jul 18 16:46:43 2015 UTC,It says right on her page regarding the 22nd emails and 24th release.
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,doctorofstyle,2,Sat Jul 18 17:51:19 2015 UTC,I'm sure there will be more stock on the 24th or even before.
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,somenorn,2,Sat Jul 18 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting how your post telling people to chill out, has actually made people angrier. Sometimes you just have to ignore them.  As much as I want to feel bad for them, their whining is actually getting out of hand now. The are much worse things to get riled up over than a toy. What's done is done and you get ready for round 2. Maybe you won't get one by the 24th, but you'll get one eventually."
AmiiboCanada,3dqw49,iCarbunk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:28:52 2015 UTC,But Josh said Palutena should be up for a good 15 minutes. USA is huge compared to Canada. USA 15 minutes must be like 5 minutes Canadian. We're doomed!

AmiiboCanada,3dpc81,AmiiboManTO,0,Sat Jul 18 04:20:45 2015 UTC,Wanna know why all those points don't matter? Amazon.com and Amazon.ca are separate entities and don't play by the same rules.

Did you pay using PayPal because I did and I got my refund for the Villager and Little Mac. I also am never ever going to purchase anything off of YesAsia again
AmiiboCanada,3dp63u,luemasify,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:37:28 2015 UTC,I used Paypal. Last time they cancelled my order I had to wait for the whole order to be completed before I got my refund. It took another week on top of the order finishing. (That whole order got cancelled as well)

AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, yeah. I don't reckon there will be any issues with your order. I didn't want to use EMS at all because I did research on SAL and EMS and have heard horror stories about EMS shipped orders, so I just opted to do SAL Registered because I wanted my order to be treated a bit better since it was coming from overseas.   I find it amusing that an order can come from overseas and be in impeccable conditions, but comes from a warehouse literally 45 minutes from me and comes with bends, rips, and scratches."
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,Xenrei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"I've literally never had a problem with an EMS order. This is just the same kind of crap as with Amazon. It's a numbers game. Just because you had a good experience with SAL doesn't mean everyone has good experiences with SAL. Case in point every EMS order I've had has gotten to me fine, my last order shipped via SAL the box looked like it went through a war zone.  Shit happens. Likewise shit happens when you run a massive organization like Amazon and have to hire hundreds if not thousands of people to work in your warehouse. There's bound to be a few of them that hate their jobs and don't give a shit about your package.   People are far more likely to complain about shit when it goes wrong. The people with pleasant experiences aren't coming on Reddit to post a thread about how their package got here with no issue."
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,Yellow-Tangerine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:08 2015 UTC,SAL Registered is definitely worth the extra cost. It gives you a tracking number and insurance in case your package is lost/damaged. If your order hasn't been paid for yet you can edit the shipping method from your account.
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,Xenrei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:07 2015 UTC,Sadly i have already paid and it has been shipped so I am just crossing my fingers everything is ok because i have not used amiami before but i am a little relived that many people can vouch for it
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,PikaJaune,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"Well like /u/ichemical said, there shouldn't be any issues. It's still the same shipping method as SAL-Reg. The tracking number and insurance might give you better peace of mind on your next order, is all. For me, I feel more comfortable if I can check the status of my shipment and it's insured just in case."

AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"Registered is simply insurance for the package's contents. Once it ships from AmiAmi, it's all up to the courier/shipping companies to make sure it arrives in good order.    I always use Registered since it's only a few dollars more but that's just because I've had poor luck with mail getting lost or damaged (i.e. not just teeny dents in the box or petty nonsense like that but actually destroyed beyond use). I'll use EMS for top-priority, special, or limited edition type of items."
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,smog-097,0,Fri Jul 17 21:16:59 2015 UTC,When you order unregistered mail with any provider it's a gamble. You saved a few bucks and the tradeoff was no insurance and no tracking number. In the future always spend the extra few bucks for registered.
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,MalarkeyTFC,0,Fri Jul 17 19:43:20 2015 UTC,But you pay with paypal.
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,smog-097,0,Fri Jul 17 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"So? The reason people are buying shit from JAPAN is that they want it. The vast majority of the stuff on AmiAmi sells through incredibly quickly as well. 2-3 weeks for your item to get there by the time you realize it was lost, congrats you got your refund, now where the hell are you going to buy it now?  Regardless of whether or not you pay with paypal it's 100% worth the extra 3 bucks or so it ends up being on average for registered over unregistered."
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,MalarkeyTFC,0,Sat Jul 18 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"I've only had one thing I bought on ebay coming from China not show up.  Some $1 batteries.  I have bought hundreds of items over the years from the UK, Japan, China and the US ... Aliexpress, ebay, etc.  They have always made it.  So an extra $3 or $4 adds up over time, unless you assume 1 in every 4 amiibos coming from amiami is going to get ""lost""' you are actually losing money.  ... Your registered package is just as likely to get lost as unregistered.  So your comment that the item is sold out everywhere else still applies regardless.  If it gives you the warm fuzies, knock youself out.  No need to iRage over the fact that paypal covers your shipment anyways.  My last sal unregistered amiibo from amiami was 10 days... My registered package from play asia was 30."
AmiiboCanada,3dnor7,aceSakirfice,0,Sat Jul 18 18:50:14 2015 UTC,irage? Are you serious? You think that was rage? Did you actually comprehend what it was I wrote?  There's a reason that online retailers like AmiAmi and HLJ don't even let you ship unregistered when you're shipping anything even remotely valuable. It's really that simple.

AmiiboCanada,3doyqc,AwesomeMunchies,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Not usually. For them its easier to stock them online as they sell and don't have to ship them off to each store, never mind they only get like 20 or so stock."
AmiiboCanada,3doyqc,zekev3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:50:56 2015 UTC,They get drop shipments direct from Nintendo  Any one considered to be uncommon they get 2-4 per shipment but commons like Mario peach and pikachu they get weekly on their regular inventory trucks Thursday mornings at 6 am

AmiiboCanada,3dovxx,Helixium,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Be patient another week or two. Both will be readily available like all the rest recently. Wait another two months, all will be easily available. Market approaching saturation now, and then there will be no more fun in the hunt, and scalpers and others will be unloading for cheap. You can already tell as nothing sells on Kijiji anymore.  I wish Nintendo didn't start flooding market, but they not stupid and going to leave money on the table"
AmiiboCanada,3dovxx,yycamiibo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they started flooding the market, in fact, I'm pretty sure that's what every amiibo-fanatic (except for scalpers) has been asking for since this craze began.  However, now that the flooding seems to be approaching, some people seem to be regretting it because they actually secretly liked the ""rarity"" aspect and the hunting; either without consciously knowing it about themselves, or they knew they did and ignored it."

AmiiboCanada,3dmpb5,SCostello,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:19 2015 UTC,I can tell you that PEI doesnt have any Shulks nor does Halifax . But I could be wrong and things could have changed since yesterday afternoon .
AmiiboCanada,3dmpb5,runikepisteme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:24:24 2015 UTC,I've called every EB in Halifax and visited two... they haven't gotten any Ness.. they got a few shulk

AmiiboCanada,3dmpb5,pandoraspeaks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"I was just at EB Games on Young Street (Halifax) a couple of hours ago, and they had plenty of Shulk's laying around.  I wouldn't blame you if you didn't trust a random on the internet, as I didn't believe it myself when I walked in there and found a fair amount of Shulk's. But give them a call if you're a bit skeptical nonetheless!  Edit: The woman working there told me he was becoming more common. On a first impression I'm a bit skeptical, but it's at least reassuring to know they probably have quite a lot of Shulk amiibo to go around as of now; around here at least."
AmiiboCanada,3dnh7u,Sivadreamer,2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Well, my payment was just reversed, so they returned the $72 I paid. On the other hand, I already received the order, so... free stuff I guess?"
AmiiboCanada,3dnh7u,PsychoDuck,2,Fri Jul 17 18:29:41 2015 UTC,same thing for me they recharged it hours after i received it dont worry its not free

I know they've bounced back from those few that were like midget 1/8 figures, though.  For those of you who have no idea, an entry model Hot Toys figure starts in the neighbourhood of $220 CAD, and that's if you buy it directly from a local store in Hong Kong. If you go online, basic price is about $220 US."

AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,JewJulie,2,Fri Jul 17 12:25:23 2015 UTC,Cheaper than Canadian Retail. (by a bit or margin depending on how many your order). Shipping and Conversation rates just work out that way.   Packaging is pristine. 50X better than domestic packages here and it's coming from Japan.
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,amuubo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"I've never had a package be damaged when shipped to me by amazon but yet last months order from AmiAmi came completely destroyed essentially. Thankfully none of the action figures I bought were damaged but one of my PAK boxes (which are works of art in their own right) is completely undisplayable.   It's not their fault, it's just the nature of shipping. I'm not saying this to bash them or say people shouldn't order from them. I'm simply trying to illustrate that shit will happen when shipping goods. Conversely a company as large as Amazon is bound to have some jackasses working for them that just don't give a fuck about how they place your 15.99 toy into the box.   It's a numbers game. No matter the retailer they will eventually have an issue with a package getting damaged regardless of how well shipped they are or an employee doing a half-assed job putting something into the box. Personally I haven't noticed much of a difference between either Amazon or AmiAmi when it comes to their packaging, both use decent boxes and liberal amounts of packing paper. The only retailer I've seen so far that really goes out of its way to package their stuff incredibly well is HLJ, the boxes they use are unreal, it's just a shame AmiAmi is so much cheaper it's worth the risk of damage to the box of my figure. Conversely the only retailer I've seen that consistently does a god awful job of packing their shipments is best buy."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"Cheaper than Canadian Retail. (by a bit or margin depending on how many your order). Shipping and Conversation rates just work out that way.   Just to expound on that, for the cheapest and insured shipping option, it's only if 3 or more now. Buying even two now costs more than Canadian retail because our CAD is tanking.    Edit: Well, was I using a bit of a hyperbole when I said tanking? Probably - but a decline is still a decline. The point is that it's now 3 or more to break even or for it to be less."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,RunningChemistry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. The CAD is tanking relative to the AMERICAN dollar. The Japanese Yen isn't exactly doing gangbusters in its own right. Over the past month 1 CAD has gone from 100.5 yen to 95 yen, that's hardly tanking. Over the past year the CAD to yen rate isn't even the lowest it's been right now, back in february it dipped to about 92. So the CAD is actually performing BETTER right now against the yen than it was earlier this year.   http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=CAD&to=JPY&view=1M  The Canadian dollar isn't even doing that badly when compared to countries other than the USA. The issue here is the USA is performing so incredibly well (to be honest at unsustainable levels) that it's causing serious problems for our purchasing power when the majority of companies are US based (even though they manufacture their goods outside the US). The Americans are holding the world economy on its back right now, shit will come crashing down soon enough, these growth rates are almost entirely due to the record low oil prices (which are in turn due to fracking).   Anyways this is extremely simplified and the issues are way more complex but I just wanted to illustrate that the CAD is not tanking when compared to countries like Japan."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,MalarkeyTFC,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"This is all pretty much true lol, damn USD. Whatever, in theory this should be good for Canadian exporters at least I guess; unless they all also raise their prices to international buyers in-tangent with the decreasing dollar."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,Helixium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"One benefit for me personally is that I don't have to setup and use a Tenso account like you do with Amazon Japan, even though I know it's a good service from the numerous experiences I see on here. Just makes it easier for me."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,Helixium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"amiami is typically your best option if what you want is available.  Three or four amiibos from them is $17.50 each with registered sal, which is cheaper than off the shelf in Canada.  The downside is that they are slow as fuck; expect three-four weeks minimum.  Also they add and remove listings quite arbitrarily and when they remove a listing it's canned off your watch list. Sometimes when they add listings they don't appear under the regular amiibo search, either. (Wario is currently up but you can't find him unless you know where he is.)"
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,Uiraya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"What is the best shipping option? Would it be cheaper to buy say, mario and peach, here, than there? Taking shipping into account."
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,Uiraya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:47 2015 UTC,If you can find any original wave guys who are still priced at $14 (plus tax) then you should buy them here. Anything at $16 (which is $18 after tax) you might as well import them.
AmiiboCanada,3dm93s,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"There are basically 2 choices for shipping EMS and Registered SAL. Think of EMS like your standard express shipping, it takes 3-5 days to get here (it's seriously mind blowingly fast lol). Registered SAL is the cheapest method that still includes tracking and insurance, this one takes 2-3 weeks.   Sometimes depending on the size/weight of your item it's actually somehow cheaper to ship it EMS than Registered SAL... still haven't figured that one out yet though."

AmiiboCanada,3dlvly,RunningChemistry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:18:25 2015 UTC,Their ToS and FAQ says no cancelling. Customer testimonials have said that cancelling is really painful if not downright impossible for international orders. The only sure way is that you pretty much just don't pay when they invoice you but that's a good way to get blacklisted from shopping with them again.

AmiiboCanada,3dkrvo,allofthisforamiibo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"I think it could be a little longer. Someone mentioned they may hold off on Wave 4 restocks (Less Jiggly and Ness) until closer to the holiday season when they do a decent restock.  I would expect to see Greninja pop up over the summer. For Robin and Lucina, I'd say by the Holidays for sure, maybe Mid-late August at the earliest?  Again, these are all just guests and speculations based off no facts (just several sources here) so please, take it with a grain of salt."

AmiiboCanada,3dl8o2,hilariousness123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"He asked which one was more rare/valuable, falcon is not an exclusive and has gotten restocked on almost all of the online retailers, ness on the other hand, is an exclusive and has also gotten a VERY limited restock in which most of that restock was used to fill preorders.  So it would be better for him to trade for ness instead of falcon."

I can understand having the characters on top on the boxes, but I don't love how they intrude on the other character boxes. Plus the main logo covers major details on some characters. Sheik's face is completely covered.   Maybe try cropping each character in their box, and shrinking the logo a bit. Either way, the overall design is very nice!"

Personally I kinda liked how the figures jump out of the box, as if they were ""larger than life"", but that's just a personal thing.

AmiiboCanada,3dk22u,ZeekMeister92,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:43 2015 UTC,I will gladly pay someone extra if they could pick one up for me and hold it until September. This is a move of desperation. I'm out of town until then.

AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,Mayoo614,6,Thu Jul 16 16:36:24 2015 UTC,I imagine after the smash wave is done a lot of people will stop collecting. which might cause problems for nintendo.  i can see nintendo make a large amount of whatever amiibo series will come after smash bros (assuming it will have just as much demand) only for no one to buy into it.
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,Baron_Von_Lucas,3,Thu Jul 16 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think there will still be shortages of certain amiibo. Specifically with the Animal Crossing series - not all of them, mind you."
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,snodnarb,2,Thu Jul 16 16:56:49 2015 UTC,I feel like Isabelle will be the most common one
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,TheMotherBrothers,2,Thu Jul 16 17:12:36 2015 UTC,You are 100% correct over the next year the will see a massive decline in sales because people only care about smash generally speaking. This is when one year from now roughly they will remember the only franchise that can save their amiibo.......POKEMON.....then you will be in for a treat....:(

AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,dragn99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:15 2015 UTC,That's why they release other series in between. To keep us buying Amiibo while still waiting for the end of smash series. 2016 for DLC caracters.
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,sedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:30 2015 UTC,Hasn't been a problem for Funko yet with their Pop! figures and they have significantly more of them coming out than Nintendo has Amiibo. They also tend to sell for about the same amount depending on where you go to buy them ranging from 10.50-15.99.
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,MalarkeyTFC,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:21 2015 UTC,I intend to stop. However saying I won't buy another amiibo is wishful thinking.....
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,doctorofstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the same thing, especially with most, if not all Canadian retailers not doing pre-orders anymore. Even if I could go lineup outside stores on launch day to get the ones I want, I have zero interest in doing so."

AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,snodnarb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:22 2015 UTC,My favorite have been people that fully admit to buying characters they just don't like or even better buying Amiibo for games they don't own (cough splatoon cough). No kidding you're going to burn out/think they're too expensive...   I think a lot of the people that went in with the intent to only collect the characters/series they like in the end will end up valueing their collection a lot more and resenting it less. Hell I love Splatoon as a game but I don't have any real connection to the chracters and as such skipped on their Amiibo.
AmiiboCanada,3dirr7,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:41 2015 UTC,I forgot about splatoon. I skipped that series as well.

AmiiboCanada,3di2a0,IcedKappaccino,2,Thu Jul 16 14:11:32 2015 UTC,They are most likely in transit. Employees generally do not know what they're getting until they actually open the boxes.

AmiiboCanada,3dkadn,PikaJaune,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"In my experience, this usually means there's at least 1 (Probably just 1) somewhere in the store, whether being held for a pre-order or held for someone else. Or it could just be a mistake/glitch."
AmiiboCanada,3dkadn,Forrester777,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:51 2015 UTC,It takes a long time to refresh; Vancouver sold out yet is still green.
AmiiboCanada,3dkadn,SamTheTechGamer,2,Thu Jul 16 23:24:06 2015 UTC,"Check in the morning, I find that's when it's first updated. After that it stays pretty much the same all day."
AmiiboCanada,3dkadn,pandoraspeaks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, because EB store sales data apparently is not sent out to the main office until end of each day, the tracker information will only update after that data is sent across, so it will stay the same all day regardless of what the store does or does not sell."
AmiiboCanada,3dkadn,jpwong,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:29 2015 UTC,It only updates once every 24 hours. Usually sometime in the morning before stores open.

Square One had a green marker, but the manager told me the stock there was to fulfill pre-orders that didn't go through. I told him about the website issue, as it would be considered misleading if left unattended. Hopefully, the website will be updated, but your best bet is to call ahead to a specific location nearby."

AmiiboCanada,3djczh,killmore,0,Thu Jul 16 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"If it shows up as green or yellow it means it's either in stock or it's still in transit coming to that location, sometimes employees won't know about it until it's shipped.

AmiiboCanada,3dk3th,Brawler678,4,Thu Jul 16 22:27:37 2015 UTC,I'm leaving him in unicorn because he was still nearly impossible to get the first time around. Remember I try to base our rarity chart on a combination of overall availability and current.
AmiiboCanada,3dk3th,lordpizzapop,3,Thu Jul 16 22:31:52 2015 UTC,People always do this when we get a restock. They jump to conclusions. Shulk will be just as hard to find a month from now as he was a month ago
AmiiboCanada,3dk3th,Forrester777,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:28 2015 UTC,Definitely not uncommon. By Monday you won't be able to find him in store. By August there will only be exorbitant priced ones on kijiji again.
AmiiboCanada,3dk3th,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:34 2015 UTC,As far as I'm concerned all the exclusives will forever be on the higher end of rare if not unicorn. Don't expect the momentary influx to last.

AmiiboCanada,3die6a,AtlasGamer,2,Thu Jul 16 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm still missing Rosalina and Ike.  Full collection is NA.  All smash amiibos and the splatoon trio are out of box, but their boxes are as damageless as I could manage and tucked away safely.  All SMB amiibos are in box, perfect condition.  I have a couple of extras with the intent to trade for what I'm missing.  Should I complete the collection without needing to trade, I may get one of my extras custom painted to represent the alt color I use in-game, and then I'll sell the rest for retail to friends, and if none of my friends want them, then I'll release them to the public for retail.    At the end of the day though, my bottom line is not paying more than retail and not scalping what I don't need.  I mean I'm willing to pay like a little extra as a finders fee/convenience, but no chance I'm jumping on anything $30+ or more.  Maybe I'm being optimistic but I'm pretty confident that as long as I'm patient, I'll get a full collection through my own perseverance.  So far so good considering I'm just missing two."
AmiiboCanada,3die6a,MogKnightAzure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:44 2015 UTC,Nice to see someone opening their amiibo. I do the same as you and keep the boxes. Why did you not open the SMB ones?
AmiiboCanada,3die6a,GreenMallard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Don't really plan on using them for any games.  Plus its gonna take enough shelf space for me just to host the full smash cast.  I don't even plan on using most of the smash cast either but I've unboxed them because my only goal is to arrange them as they appear in game.  When I heard about amiibo and saw the first smash bros ones I knew right away that this was their true purpose.  To think that since melee the characters in this universe are just trophies brought to life, and once you've beaten it with everyone you have this awesome collection to look at in-game... but now nearly 15 years later I can make that collection a physical reality...  I can't wait!   My ultimate goal is to arrange the full smash cast as they appear when you beat classic in smash bros with Mario after having already beaten it with the rest of the cast.  Thats the arrangement I want to complete."

AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,smog-097,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:04:01 2015 UTC,What's Fulfilled by Amazon?
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,Real_Deal_Ritzer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Fulfilled by Amazon means that the seller has sent the items to Amazon and Amazon is in charge of shipping it. If you make one order of all amiibo Fulfilled by Amazon then they are all going to be shipped together, by Amazon."
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,Tallyburger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, Tenso will combine the orders for you once they arrive if you want them to, but its something like $3.00 per, and then an additional $2.00 because they are combining. But I'm uncertain on the max orders you can combine. Amazon wouldn't combine them, maybe unless they are being fulfilled by them though, since it means they actually have the items in their warehouse."
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,Tallyburger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:41:57 2015 UTC,Ok. And that combining charge is added on to the shipping cost?
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,Tallyburger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yup! I haven't had to do that yet myself, but if you look around on Tenso it talks about it. Also, Fulfilled by Amazon means that the seller gave Amazon their items to ship / sell directly from their warehouse, so the actual seller doesn't mail it, Amazon does. It gaurentees Amazon has it in stock too."
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,RunningChemistry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:57 2015 UTC,And how would I go about using this Fulfilled by Amazon thing
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,FushigiNeko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"If you look at the list of all the sellers available, those that qualify will say Fulfilled by Amazon."
AmiiboCanada,3dibgi,guleedy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"If the sellers aren't part of the Fulfilled by Amazon program and shipped at the same time, they're going to be shipped individually. Although, even if they're part of the program, there's a small chance that they'll be separate if one warehouse doesn't have all the stock - a pal had this happen to her order.    On an aside, our CAD value is so poor right now that unless you get at least 4 from Amazon, you'll be paying more than CAD retail (MSRP + tax) using SAL Registered - disappointing for those who just want to get a few. Even AmiAmi is now more than CAD retail if you order less than three."

AmiiboCanada,3dhwag,Tallyburger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:07 2015 UTC,Which is why I cancelled my two 5b on UK and placed it on JP the other day when they went up. I save $20 CND doing it this way. Decided I could wait the extra couple weeks (and now I have time to get some money again!)
AmiiboCanada,3dhwag,StimulatorCam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:40:23 2015 UTC,Of course if we weren't all so impatient we'd just wait for the NA release and save $35... ;)
AmiiboCanada,3dhwag,Tallyburger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"haha, not quite that much! For the 2 I'm getting, it's $25. And then $15 for shipping... $40 total. Which would be maybe $4 more then if I were to buy them here with their NA release. I pay an extra $4 overall, but I get it months in advance, delivered to my door, and don't have to worry about going camping like during W4 xD"

AmiiboCanada,3dhwag,StimulatorCam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"...the title of this post is specifically about 'Amazon UK'... Yes I know you cancelled yours and bought from JP, but if you were to buy all three at NA cost it would be ~$56, and we who bought all 3 from UK paid ~$90, so it's about $35 difference like I said."
AmiiboCanada,3dhwag,Tallyburger,0,Thu Jul 16 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"Like I said, you commented on my post, which was not about the UK.

No need to be stupid about it though."

AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,Lyonsbayne,10,Thu Jul 16 11:21:31 2015 UTC,msrp tier list:  Old ones are $13.99  New ones are $15.99
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,hilariousness123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:54:50 2015 UTC,=P~~~
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,CrumplePants,2,Thu Jul 16 12:31:15 2015 UTC,For what reason?
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,2,Thu Jul 16 13:42:14 2015 UTC,No it should stay as it is. If more complexed amiibo start selling for more then scalpers are gonna jump on it. There is gonna be a tier that classifies amiibo and kids/parents aren't gonna buy the expensive ones. It's gonna be a new reason to up the prices for future ones and the most expensive ones are gonna be more sought after by collector even more as it is now. It's a bad marketing. They are gonna sell less for the cheap ones and production isn't gonna follow for the high ones.
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Am I correct in saying that your view is that all amiibos should be priced the same, not due to differences in quality, but due to concerns of opening possibilities of being financially exploited as an collector? That is a well thought out argument also.  Do price tiers benefit scalpers and retailers more then collectors? Or the flip side, would discounted amiibos alternatives be incentive for new collectors, kids, casual  collectors, or even impulse buys? If Luigi was a few dollars cheaper then Robin, would that be incentive to buy Luigi or would Luigi be avoided because it's MRSP value(ignoring real world value) is less?"
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,smog-097,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of 'what if' involved and we can't know for sure the outcome of such changes in prices. Mostly because of quantity/demand. Sure if they produce a LOT of high price amiibo there is less scalpers to be making money. We would be buying them for collection/use sake and not having to have it because it's so limited. I remember buying the limited edition of Borderland on ps4 I think it was 2000 in the world and the price was 500$. A reseller bought it from me only to flip it. He's still trying to sell it at cost. People don't want to pay high prices when they can get a regular version for msrp. Sure you get a Clap-Trap bot but is it really it's true value ? No. The production cost is way less. Like the other comment I saw, it's what maybe 0.10 cents more to produce ?"
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this is meant to be a hypothetical discussion. No one here is on the Nintendo board of directors. We can freely (and hopefully maturely. We all know how quickly things can turn negative in here) discuss those 'what ifs'."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"I do find it interesting, taking a look at say Ganondorf and comparing him to Jigglypuff.  One wouldn't think they'd be the same price .. but whatever."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,PaperRok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"Or instead of a price difference should there be more effort with Jigglypuff? A more interesting pose, more games support, accessories (for example, Kirby, should he come with different hats?)"
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,PaperRok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I like the idea of Accessories. Hats, maybe weapons. You see all those custom Amiibo people make. But if they decide to go there it would not be Amiibos anymore. More like action figures with NFC chips. Then the prices would go up to 40$. Like a Play Art figure with accessories (but those are way more than 40$ and are way more bigger)."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"Within reason of course. But valid point also, it's a slippery slope. When do you say enough is enough."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,PaperRok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"I collect Amiibo simply because it's Nintendo, I knew before-hand that there would be the smash roster and i calculated that with msrp prices I would be able to afford the collection. Now this was set in stone from the beggining (canadian msrp price up was unexpected but still not a problem). Now imagine it's the same roster but there is different prices, different sizes. It's just out of hand to keep track and have a collection that is Same Size, Same Price. You know how Skylanders have various figures, various token or whatever they call those (power disc?), various color swap (convention exclusives). It's impossible to keep track to go 100%."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,sedkiller,2,Thu Jul 16 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"From the consumer standpoint, I think the question is more about: ""if there were pricing tiers, how does that benefit me?""  For instance let's say that Villagers (less detail) were only $10 while Marth (more detail) were $15. If the stock scenario played out like it has (scarcity), then people would not see the point in having to pay a premium for ""high detail"" characters. Either way, they cannot get their hands on one. However if for instance the $15 characters were more abundant (basically like commons) because of the higher price tag, I don't think anyone would be complaining. That's a reasonable extra price, to guarantee you getting one.  So essentially: if the reason for the current scarcity/rarity issue is the cost of production for each character, then pricing tears would be somewhat justified. Nintendo can start producing all character at an even rate. At least the ""rares"" can sit on the shelves for a while before being auctioned off. If pricing tiers were introduced with it having zero effect on supply, then Nintendo shot itself in the foot. All this strategy accomplishes is exposing Nintendo as a greedy company (even though we already knew that) and builds further ill will in its customer base."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,PaperRok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:54 2015 UTC,A very good point. Would pricing be a bigger icontrol on availablity then quailty
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,The-shoemaker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, the best amiibo sales trajectory I have seen is Samus'. She was abundant as anything up until about January/February. Then she became rarer and rarer.  If Nintendo could replicate those same results with every amiibo, then sales will never really tail off. I maintain that for every one of us willing to put up with hunting, there were at least 5-7 people who gave up immediately. Unless you're a diehard Mario fan it's slim pickings at any retailer. For all of us the collection started with one (either a main or favourite character). When even one amiibo is unobtainable how can you get hooked?  If reasonable pricing tiers can aid in getting more stock into stores, then I'm all for it. This is the only way scalpers will back off from the product."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,ultrasuperman1001,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"For those 10$ ones you would be inclined to open them and use them. But for the ones that cost more, you would be like: oh that cost me a lot, it has a lot of details, it's collectable, I won't open it and enjoy it's full use."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,Ninjaofshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"I think there's a misunderstanding between what you meant and what I meant. My comment was based upon the current forms of the amiibo. When I say ""more detailed"" and ""less detailed"" I'm talking about the amount of detail put into their current forms. I do not mean it in the sense of a ""Marth"" (less detailed) and ""Marth HD"" (more detailed).  Now to answer your question, my answer is not really. It depends on how you collect. I'm for the higher prices as long as it means more stock actually heads to the stores.  Personally I would gladly open a more expensive (insert detailed amiibo here) if I was an OOB collector and wanted to enjoy its in-game functionality. Same goes for if I was collecting them NIB. It all depends on how you intend to use the figure. I would rather see the money go directly to Nintendo's pocket, than some scalper."
AmiiboCanada,3dhrwv,Baron_Von_Lucas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"I follow you. I didn't make any distinction between hd or not. Simply put, currently I would be more open (no pun intended) to open a Kirby then say a Shulk. Simply because of current value. I mean Mario is a no brainer open box, you can go to the store and get one more. Shulk (for now) is more detailled yes but it's so scarse that if in the future you want to complete your NIB collection you can't take that 'risk'."

AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,calvinabc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:12:49 2015 UTC,I want that so bad!
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Doshy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"Fellow Calgary amiibro here, nice find. I may have to get that ganondorf if I can find it before someone else nabs it."
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,calvinabc,2,Thu Jul 16 02:13:42 2015 UTC,I've seen 6 inch Ganons at Crossiron TRU and Sunridge TRU if that's what you're looking for. $19.99
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Forrester777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:38 2015 UTC,I saw this in Toys R Us a couple weeks ago. Was gonna buy it but passed. It's sweet man!
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Forrester777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in Calgary and have been looking for the metroid! Did you find this in the TRU or EB?  Edit: Ah, I see that you've found it in Macleod TRU. Might be too far from me to warrant the drive (Located in NW). Do you remember how many they had at TRU?  Anybody know anywhere else in Calgary I could buy the Metroid?"
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,lordpizzapop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:22 2015 UTC,I have no idea what that is.
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:08:47 2015 UTC,Metroid!
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Forrester777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, Metroid! That's why I didn't recognize it. I've never played a Metroid game in my entire life.."
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,lordpizzapop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:37:26 2015 UTC,You should totally play Super Metroid and Metroid Prime.
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,smog-097,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:58:08 2015 UTC,I second this.
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Lyonsbayne,0,Thu Jul 16 01:33:46 2015 UTC,"I actually have Metroid (1987) and Metroid Fusion (GBA?) both on my 3DS. Are either of those any good? Never tried them, haha."
AmiiboCanada,3dg2dl,Forrester777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:12:52 2015 UTC,Original is tough because of the grinding (probably easier on 3DS because you can save state). Fusion is really good too. I just mentioned the other 2 because those are my 2 favourites of the series.
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,Personiv,2,Thu Jul 16 01:19:53 2015 UTC,I find they have no pattern. Like most sites it's usually completely random. (Other than Indigo's love for the middle of the night)
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,Forrester777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:54:12 2015 UTC,yeah it seems walmarts website restocks their amiibos between 4-5 am MT. On Tuesday/Thursday's/Friday's I noticed bestbuys website  will restock on amibos in waves first wave at 3:00pm MT and the second wave on the same day at 4:00pm MtT each wave has different amiibos.
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,Mcloller12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:55:11 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this too. I get notifications around 7am EST that Fox, Marth, Little Mac, Captain Falcon, Villager, and Pit are in stock. Sometimes not all, but often. I already got them though so I don't need them."
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,amiibo3_141592653589,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:20:41 2015 UTC,YUP! Right when I wake up & check r/AmiiboCanada :P
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,qazthecrazy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:31:29 2015 UTC,I wonder why they cancelled amiibo for some and then continually restock the ones that were cancelled.
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,Android1989,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:45 2015 UTC,Hey Jim is that it?  Probably...  Ok goodnight!  Then they find out the missed like two boxes and put them up! XD
AmiiboCanada,3dgb70,Granitetheglitche,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:10:40 2015 UTC,"Well, no restock this morning. Poo bear."

AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,TheMotherBrothers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:32:58 2015 UTC,Oh yea? Damn.
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,lordpizzapop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Now I only need Kirby, Toon Link, Sheik, and Samus for my friend out of the uncommons."
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,lordpizzapop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:17 2015 UTC,1 left! @6:35PM EST
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Forrester777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Snagged one
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Snakeman119,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:30 2015 UTC,No problem just doing my part
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,JewJulie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:28 2015 UTC,Sold out !
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,amiibro818,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:38:41 2015 UTC,Did Donkey Kong actually just sell out? Haha I thought I'd never see that happen!
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Mcloller12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"Managed to snag up Kirby, DK, and Toon link on the bestbuy website, all 3 of them went up at 4 pm"
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,lordpizzapop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I never noticed, I need the other 2 now, hopefully a few more go up soon."
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Aryll07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:51:30 2015 UTC,Thanks OP! Got one! Picked up a Silver Mario as well. I missed out on Gold Mario and MetaKnight earlier. I'm happy with these guys too since I needed 'em!
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Akagami1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:43:40 2015 UTC,wtf is with bestbuy and its random restocks of random amiibo? Couldve used a DK lol
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Zephusa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:47:55 2015 UTC,OH MY GOD.  I was giving my friend his Amiibo and we started chatting ;-;  It's the last one I need and I missed it!
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,skitchdc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:04 2015 UTC,thought last one you needed was zelda
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,Zephusa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:26:17 2015 UTC,It was but then when we actually did a thorough look over of our collection we were missing Zelda AND Dk :(  We got Zelda but DK is no where in sight
AmiiboCanada,3dfqdl,hashtagmydaywear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:42 2015 UTC,Donkey Kong is in stock at Amiami still if people don't mind Boxes. I had no idea he was that rare though.
AmiiboCanada,3dg05t,mrps4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:55 2015 UTC,Your order should have shipped yesterday or today. Log into your account and check your order status. It should show as shipped.
AmiiboCanada,3dg05t,Forrester777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"Odds lean toward yes however I dont know how Walmart backorder works, you should contact customer services."
AmiiboCanada,3dg05t,Thorgalkun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"I think once they cancel / back order you lose your order. I had a Marth, Wiifit, and Villager order and only got Marth delivered. Best to call them."
AmiiboCanada,3dg05t,twitchSKETCH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:04:35 2015 UTC,Just called them the guy told me that they are being processed so I guess I will be getting them.
AmiiboCanada,3dg05t,JohnnyBsmash,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:16:16 2015 UTC,I wft and villager shipped later than the rest.  Check your account
AmiiboCanada,3dfye9,Akagami1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:33:56 2015 UTC,Your best bet is to check AmiAmi around 4amEST   It seems like about the time they put amiibo up.
AmiiboCanada,3dfye9,Departures101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"lol ive been staying up all night for the past week, I really hope they put him up, theres no eb games near my house"
AmiiboCanada,3dfye9,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:39 2015 UTC,I usually just keep my eyes open for anything posted by Charak-V
AmiiboCanada,3dfye9,Charak-V,2,Thu Jul 16 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"heh, thought I would miss out if they had did it tonight cause I had a date, lots of pings so it's possible for something from 1-3am pst"
AmiiboCanada,3dfye9,Lyonsbayne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:30:55 2015 UTC,I jus keep a tab open and stay up all night lol
