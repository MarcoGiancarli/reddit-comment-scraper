canes,3cx3wj,canesfan81,4,Sat Jul 11 15:34:20 2015 UTC,I think we need to trade a defenseman or two maybe. Obviously not Hanifin or Fluery or Murphy or Faulk. Maybe Murphy.
canes,3cx3wj,canesfan81,3,Sat Jul 11 19:58:40 2015 UTC,I am least excited about Murphy. I don't think he has the most upside but I think he could get a great trade return. Faulk Flurry and Hanifin seem to be all amazing!
canes,3cx3wj,Volan1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:35 2015 UTC,I don't think his trade return is too high right now. I think he's pretty solid if he can put on the muscle he has the mental ability to be a great player. I mean ideally i'd trade Liles for any kind of winger with some size and grit and just go young as hell on defense this year.
canes,3cx3wj,Digital_Geist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:00:22 2015 UTC,Oh yea I'm not saying right now. Now we should take time to develop all the young talent and establish them. I think when we are in win mode (hopefully in two years?) that of all of the guys I am least excited about but I see him being good enough to trade at a good value. I think we keep them all for now.

Still a decent selection of the lesser known prospects (Shugg, Pogge, Woods) jerseys.   Good amount of goalie gear left when I left, same with skates, and pants.   Good tape (the Canadian kind) for a dollar a roll. Really had me regretting carrying 10 pounds of it on my carry on from my trip to Canada.   Still lots of skates.

Aho looks like Peter's prototypical player.  Fast and hard working.  Reminded me a bit of Tlusty actually.  I thought he looked alright.

canes,3cfaqp,iv1000falcon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:52:45 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  Almost the exact same deal as last year.  Didn't do anything spectacular but gives him a chance once again to try and become an NHL regular.  I still hope that next year will be his one....
canes,3cfaqp,iv1000falcon,2,Tue Jul 7 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"With Semin gone and us not bringing in a replacement top six player, I think the door has never been wider for him to try and grab a 2nd/3rd line role. If hes going to be in the nhl full time those are the only places Peters will think to keep him based on his skill set"
canes,3cfaqp,goochnorris,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:32 2015 UTC,"Its totally his chance.  First round draft pick should be hungry for a 2nd line spot at 25 years old.  Especially with the opening, he knows this is his year to prove it, which like I said I really hope he does.  I am interested to really see how they form the lines to start the year."
canes,3cfaqp,iv1000falcon,4,Tue Jul 7 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"How many years are we going to keep asking ""is this the year boychuk sticks in the NHL?"" Dude's a bust"
canes,3cfaqp,BarkMingo,3,Tue Jul 7 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"If he is a bust at the NHL level then we really aren't paying him much and its a good depth signing.  Fact is we are short on wingers right now and he had enough skill to be taken 14th overall.  If he gets put on a line (not the 4th line, hes not a grinder) with some skilled players and he clicks, he could be the guy to step up and fill the gap we have at right wing.  If not, it costs us $250,000 which is what we would pay a lot of dept guys anyway.  Dude is not too old, only 25 I think.  He could have a big year and earn his way onto the second line possibly.  We need some top 6 forwards.  Might as well give him a cheap chance to earn it."
canes,3cfaqp,iv1000falcon,4,Tue Jul 7 17:48:15 2015 UTC,this gets said about him EVERY offseason though
canes,3cfaqp,XdshortX,2,Tue Jul 7 22:48:46 2015 UTC,"Not the part about having actually wing opportunities.  Last year he started the season with 15 games on a regular third line shift and had 5 points and was +3 in those 15 games. That's a solid start for a third liner. That would translate to like a 25 point season if he kept that regular shift.   It was when injured players came back that he was getting moved around, not getting regular shifts that he got only 1 point in like 15 games. Hard to expect much when you aren't sure when or who you are playing with. And before this year coaches like Muller put him on the fourth line where I don't think a player like him won't succeed.  So this year the difference I am seeing is an opening at wing that he could stay in and get in a groove rather than just being a piece to plug in for injury. That's where his chance is different for success."
canes,3cfaqp,iv1000falcon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"Terry makes the most of fourth line opportunities, and fewer minutes than his play style would usually benefit from. Boychuck skates when he gets big ice time, and doesn't when he's playing where he actually fits in on our roster. Either way, I don't want to see him crack our roster. He's too small and we need size"
canes,3cfaqp,XdshortX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"Terry I like but I don't think he ever had much potential to make it past the 3rd line.  Zach had that potential.  I said ""had"" cuz I agree he probably wont crack our roster but I really hope he does. He was part of the flawed system that struggled to develop offensive talent.  At this point taking a chance on a guy probably wont be what keeps us from winning a cup.  If he does finally succeed it could be huge for our recruiting potential to demonstrate that our new staff can develop going forward.  If not, then he is still a body to fill in our roster holes.  Yea size would be nice but bottom line is we have holes at O and he is still a young guy that can fill it and has potential. Not a ton of offensive weapons we have to choose from."

canes,3cc849,BabyCheezits,5,Mon Jul 6 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"I think this is true, but I'd file that one under the coaching staff/system part.  It's a real shame that this happens sometimes with Russian players.  For me the American game could use more flair and less grinding.  Reminds me of this Igor Larionov article:    ""I remember Datsyuk made a couple turnovers in a game when he first came to Detroit at age 23. Players on the team like Brett Hull, Brendan Shanahan, Steve Yzerman and myself had to tell him, “Pavel, just keep doing what you’re doing.” Thankfully, Scotty Bowman had the wisdom to see his potential. If he was on a different team with a different coach who did not appreciate that kind of unique skill, Datsyuk might have been out of the league. He would be playing in the KHL tonight.   In Russia right now, there are four or five Datsyuks playing in the KHL who never got their chance. Sergei Mozyakin led the KHL in scoring last season and was in the scoring race for most of his 20s. But he’s 33 now and nobody in America has ever heard of him. Why? Most North American coaches don’t have the patience for his style of play.    I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talk about how fast the game is now and how sophisticated the systems have become. Watching the game, does it really seem much faster? Does it really seem more advanced? We had a saying in the Soviet days that I wish more coaches and scouts would adopt today: It’s not how fast you skate, it’s how fast you think.""    Obviously the problems with Semin and the Canes go well beyond that, but it's a big part of what makes the whole thing so sad and frustrating for me.  When that Staal/Semin/Tlusty line was clicking that first lockout season it was so damn fun to watch."
canes,3cc849,CurbYourNewUrbanism,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, there are some factors that Alex Semin can't be blamed for, but the bigger fact is that he didn't really play well unless he was slotted with Eric Staal or Jeff Skinner.   Injuries to himself and linemates played a key part in the fall of Semin as well. The knee injury to Eric Staal in May 2013, which took a while for him to get back from. Then in the summer of 2014, Eric Staal got that UBI from his workout regimen, then in December 2014 he got hit in a foot by a Justin Faulk shot, and played with a broken foot the rest of the season.  Semin himself came into the 2014-2015 season with the un-healed and apparently un-rehabbed wrist injury. Which I blame him as well as whoever cleared him to play for us, and whoever decided not to put him in IR till it was really healed. He also should have done a conditioning stint in Charlotte to make sure."
canes,3cc849,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"Datsyuk and Semin are not comparable, if I was to compare him to another Russian I think I might say Radulov. There is no denying that either of them has a significant amount of talent, the problem is the work ethic and apathy that both players have. Both of these players showed a serious lack of caring about even trying to learn the system the coach wanted to employ, and they both seemed to often appear apathetic and lazy for long stretches."
canes,3cc849,s1apshot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I did notice that Semin played the game ""horizontally"" if you want to quote Tripp, which isn't a bad thing if everyone is on the same page with it, but last season they were not. Semin would be going side-to-side while everyone else was going up-and-down. Under Peters, our system evolved into the opposite of how Semin played, and it was just a bad fit."

I think there's something behind closed doors That caused this. If it was just a lack of production i feel they would have sat him down for longer to heal and wouldn't have let him go like they did. Whether it was poor chemistry with the team, or a toxic attitude, or just didn't buy into the system, there was more to it than ""he was hurt and didn't produce this year""."

canes,3c2ayh,ImAnAfricanCanuck,11,Sat Jul 4 02:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'll answer these one at a time.   Yes, we are definitely rebuilding. The issue has been that we have a lot of money tied up in a few players who weren't performing nearly as well as they've needed to. We're just now starting to try and cut the fat. IMO Francis has done a good job so far. He's held players more accountable, has tried to free up money for signing players that actually stand a chance of panning out, and made a good choice in the draft this year (Hanifin). Karmanos is definitely kind of a moron. He's not the worst owner in the world, but he gives off the impression that he's out of touch with the fans and doesn't have a ton of ideas as to how to turn the franchise around. He's pretty reviled in the state of Connecticut for moving their team to North Carolina. But he does care about the team - just not the best hockey sense. The core of our team has talent but they've all had issues of some sort. Eric Staal is frequently accused of taking shifts off/not giving 100%, Jeff Skinner is a very good forward but always seems to be hurt, Cam Ward is good when he's on his game but is also very inconsistent, etc. We need to continue bringing in more new bodies and find a way to put it all together. I will say our defense looks like it will be much better than it has been recently, with both FA signings (Wisniewski) and younger guys (Faulk, Murphy, Fleury, Hanifin). I really like what Francis has done so far, and we're starting to form a good young corps in our back six. I think in five years we can be a consistent playoff team, but I'm not getting my hopes up too much; we've never only once made the postseason two years in a row. Keep an eye on Hanifin and Fleury in the defense this year."

canes,3c2ayh,NASNQV,2,Sat Jul 4 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Whats the owner like   Personal feelings aside, he tends to say/do things that are kind of inappropriate (like the other day regarding JR).    (he seems like a bit of a moron from the outside)   See this vine from last year. Look at the date. yeah...he's a little out of touch  Also, there's this. Maybe my favorite. Backstory - so close to the end of the 13-14 season he went on about patience. People were annoyed. At the final home game (which the canes lost miserably) the arena sound engineer played Patience by Guns n Roses while the crowd was leaving their seats. (The sound guy was then fired and replaced by a guy who tends to play a lot of dubstep)"
canes,3c2ayh,Lor-Zod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:37:21 2015 UTC,They had changes in all the in game entertainment.  They brought in a new guy to manage all of it. Section 328 interviewed him and he said that they now have a live Dj in the arena to play music. Thats why there is more dubstep now.

canes,3c2z2i,XdshortX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, I mean Belesky did put up similar numbers in the regular season although they were slightly better in less games, his plus minus was better as well. The thing is Belesky also scored 8 goals in the playoffs which Matthias didn't do. I think Matthias would be good to go at around 2-2.5 or so rather than that 3.8 that Belesky got.  I'd pull the trigger in that range if available personally."

canes,3c2z2i,Jiggaboozer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:57:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see it anywhere. It has him listed in the best 15 left article printed yesterday. Chris Stewart could be decent but I don't see him signing with us after his brother was treated badly by our team, even if it was different management/coach.  I think he could put up decent numbers with us, he hasn't been getting good minutes the last couple of seasons. With us he'd probably be able to play top 6. How about Devin Setoguchi? I mean he's put up some good numbers in the past...doesn't seem to be particularly sought after for some reason though...so should come cheap. Should be happy to come considering he'll probably get playing time with us."

canes,3bvv0h,slouch,-3,Thu Jul 2 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Chicago has just as much money tied up in their star players. No one talks about Chicago mortgaging their future to win a cup because no one gives a shit if you win a cup. The Penguins had drafted poorly and traded top picks under Ray Shero, our previous GM. What was the best trade Ray Shero made for the Penguins? Neal Niskanen? Hossa Dupuis? Are either of those better than Rutherford's Hornqvist Spaling or Kessel Erixon Biggs? We're thrilled with Rutherford."
canes,3bvv0h,slouch,9,Thu Jul 2 17:28:53 2015 UTC,Chicago still has their 1st round picks...
canes,3bvv0h,s1apshot,-3,Thu Jul 2 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"...because they already have a championship team. The Penguins had their first round picks in 2009, 2010 and 2011, too. This is like saying the Kessel trade was a bad idea because Chicago wasn't interested."
canes,3bvv0h,slouch,6,Thu Jul 2 18:08:05 2015 UTC,You do realize that Chicago has maintained the championship level team for 5 years while maintaining their picks and prospects
canes,3bvv0h,s1apshot,-5,Thu Jul 2 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. What's your point, here? It seems to be that trading picks is mortgaging your future. I guess no one cares about scouting or signing young players to contracts that will keep them in the AHL. The gambling at the draft makes way more exciting headlines than all these signings over the last 24 hours http://penguins.nhl.com/club/newsindex.htm"
canes,3bvv0h,slouch,2,Thu Jul 2 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Chicago also has significant depth in their organization which can fill out their roster. Along with still having draft picks they are also extremely good at developing them, which makes that organization extremely effective.     What the penguins have done is traded away the picks that would land them top level players, most often for a rental player who leaves on the offseason. Not only that but they have traded away their top prospects as well, in terms of top prospect all the pens have are Pouliot and Maata. Given the time required to develope prospects you are looking at a serious issue in about 4 years when in your system you have nothing but 4th line forwards ready to advance to the nhl."
canes,3bvv0h,slouch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"You're conveniently forgetting Tristan Jarry & Bryan Dumoulin. Again, if we're champions before this fourth year you talk about, no one talks about the possible down years they are focusing on now. The conversation would become about how 40% of your cap in a handful of players is the new blueprint to a winning team. To think that you can win a cup without taking risks is silly. If the Penguins aren't in a position to take risks to win now, you'll just talk about how they wasted Crosby and Malkin five years from now."

People definitely criticize them. You're not a martyr.  Trades aren't the only mark of a gm. Drafting and asset management are too. When was the last time you had a first round pick. At some point that well will dry up and you'll be left with career AHLers and marginal players that you have to call up."

canes,3bvv0h,whywecanthavenicethi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. Our favorite teams are in very different places. The Penguins need to win a cup now before our star power fades, and I don't have any problem with a top heavy roster that looks similar to Chicago's."

canes,3bvv0h,mattfki5g,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"He's only signed one really bad contract since he's been in Pittsburgh so far and that is Fleury, and it's not that terrible even. I don't think the Kessel trade is bad at all. I do think that the Letang contract they inherited may now be the worst contract in the league though. Honestly, I think we may have had our eye on Kessel(rumors were there right) and Karmanos is mad because they got him. We'll see how this works out for them though. Top lines are going to be amazing bottom lines are going to be terrible, or will the young kids step it up and make it work?"

canes,3brrz9,inSTAALed,6,Wed Jul 1 18:49:32 2015 UTC,You sound like a bitter fan. Seems fairly different to me. I don't recall having a problem of having so much depth at the bottom 6 that it was hard to determine who was on the 3rd line and which were on the 4th. A nice problem to have.
canes,3brrz9,CraniumFornication,3,Wed Jul 1 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"I am not so much worried about our bottom six... its the top 6 that give me some nightmares. E.Staal - J.Staal - Lindholm Skinner - Nash??? - Rask???    Or you move Jordan down and then what for our first line? E.Staal - ????? - Lindholm Skinner - J. Staal - Rask???      I think Lindy can be a 1st liner (maybe not yet but he can be pushed there). Rask was -14 last year, and Jordan, Skinner lines didn't seem to click. Right now it looks kind of scary. Lots of young guys will have to step up their game tremendously..."
canes,3brrz9,Digital_Geist,3,Wed Jul 1 19:34:32 2015 UTC,For top 6 I'm still a fan of this lineup:  Skinner??? - E.Staal - Lindholm  ??? - J.Staal - Rask???  Oh my gosh we are in trouble scoring wise. We have to bring another winger in.  edit: formatting
canes,3brrz9,Lsh3ll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:48 2015 UTC,I think Nestrasil can be a top 6.
canes,3brrz9,whywecanthavenicethi,2,Thu Jul 2 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"To me he seems like a more defensively responsible Rask. His +- was 2 and Rask was -14, but I dont put a ton of weight on that. He did score 18 points in 41 games with us last year but his shooting percentage was 10.5 He would be a good third line guy at around 1/2 point per game, and could slip up to 2nd line, but hes going to be out-skilled most nights I think on 2nd and definitely 1st."
canes,3brrz9,Digital_Geist,2,Thu Jul 2 14:16:35 2015 UTC,our forward lines will be horrendous this year. half those guys are AHL players and the other half will be overslotted on line 2 and 3

canes,3brtm1,Hurricane_Viking,3,Wed Jul 1 17:47:24 2015 UTC,He played in the NCAA and now that we have Hanifin he is the 4th rated D prospect in our system over Pesce and Mckeown
canes,3brtm1,NicCage420,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Was a relatively unknown prospect most of his life. I want to say he was a 4th or 5th rounder. Watched him with the USHL's Chicago Steel for three seasons. Upside is a 2nd pairing guy, maybe a top pairing on a bad team."
canes,3brwof,KeBron11,5,Wed Jul 1 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think he is on the trade block but he would have to bring in a substantial return, it would really be a player swap in to guys with a lot if potential who have played in the NHL but need a change in scenery"
canes,3brwof,s1apshot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"at this point, unless we are getting 2 top 6 wingers in return, I doubt he's traded. at this point we are missing 1 top 6 winger. why would we trade another top 6 winger?"
canes,3brwof,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:21:53 2015 UTC,I think he is the wrong kind of guy to look at as far as building up in an arms race.  I do believe that the team is shopping him around but it would probably be part of a two sided trade as /u/s1apshot said.  There was speculation earlier of moving him around the draft but they didn't trade him then for picks or prospects which would have been the time to try to make that happen.  Seems like they wanna get a real return in the form of another proven player.  He has been criticized for not having chemistry with some of our top forwards so the team is probably looking for a team with a player in a similar position to give two players the chance to work in a different system.  Edit: Just the feeling I have gotten thus far but I've been wrong before.  Just sharing my opinion.
canes,3brwof,iv1000falcon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Im expecting it to be a player trade. Probably one for one, possibly a mid-round pick to even it out a bit. Im not sure who is going to give up a decent player for him now though.  I think since it didnt happen at the draft we will have to wait closer till the trade deadline to see him get moved."

I just get this gut feeling we should just let him ride out this year, its not like he could get worse than last year, and possibly trade him at the deadline to someone that needs some scoring if he isn't up to a $7 mil value by then. Who are we going to get for the 4.7 million left from his buyout in the ufa market to replace him?"

I don't think so, so why not get on with the future. We don't spend near the cap usually so I don't see the 2 mil hurting us that much."
canes,3bn82p,iv1000falcon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"Cup, NO. ------Playoffs, very possibly. I mean seriously, with staals doing 20-30 goals and 20-30 assists easy, lindy getting 20-30 goals, skinner getting 30+ goals again, rask doing a little better at maybe 15-20, Gerbe not being snake bitten, and assuming Semin could get back to 20 goals With some of the young blood getting some consistency thats a good bit of firepower.  Defense is imporiving and we should hopefully see some improvement in goal as well....  To say if they were all performing we wouldn't be quite formidable is silly.    I dunno maybe I just liked the guy and had too much hope he would pull himself up."

canes,3bn82p,s1apshot,2,Tue Jun 30 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the question was with ""everyone producing"", and those numbers aren't reaches for any of the players, just getting back to before last year.    Like I said, I think I'm just sad he didn't work out here, and worried hes going to score the inevitable hat trick on us the first game against us with a new team (assuming he signs in the NHL)."

I just think its too big a price to keep him and hope.  And as far as sad, I think its bittersweet.  I was excited the first time I heard he was coming to Carolina but its been too many years of mediocrity and he as really shown how lazy he can be.  I would rather spend the extra 4mil we have now on a player that could give the same excitement as when we first got Semin and take this as an opportunity to show the young boys that poor work ethic isn't acceptable."

It's not like PK is going to ok the green light to spend the money we're saving on actual talent, and if he does, it's just going to be Semin part 2. Seriously, guys like Matt Beleskey are looking at making fucking 5 million dollars a year on a long term contract. Yes, Semin's contract was an albatross but people are celebrating like they're going to be spending the 4 million plus dollars we're saving themselves. PK is either going to pocket it or we're going to overpay for another contract we'll be regretting in a year or two again."
canes,3bn82p,ispoiler,6,Tue Jun 30 16:31:54 2015 UTC,Francis has been GM for a season and is already making big moves we probably never would have seen under JR. You can't just assume the usual until it happens and Francis has shown we aren't business as usual this season in my opinion.
canes,3bn82p,s1apshot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"We're going to be paying Semin 2.33 million dollars for 6 more years. Francis did the easy thing with him. At least JR got out of some of the albatrosses of his own doing by trading them away (Kaberle and Ruutu come to mind). It's still too early to give Francis credit. If we're actually icing a competitive team next year without Semin, then maybe people can start to act like he's god. But it's way premature to do act like Francis has accomplished anything. He has done all the easy moves so far (trading a UFA-to-be Sekera for a 1st, drafting Hanifin when he fell into our lap, buying out Semin).  Obviously some people don't want to hear that though."
canes,3bn82p,ispoiler,4,Tue Jun 30 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"No way we are cup contenders next year with the moves Francis made, but we wouldn't have been even if Semin was producing. You can't judge this offseason by how we finish next year.  If we moved him this year, we lose our first or retain half his salary. Retaining half his salary would be a bigger cap hit over the next three years than buying him out, plus we'd have another contract on top of that if it's for anyone decent. We rarely even spend close to the cap so is 2 mil really that big of a deal? I don't think so."

canes,3bn82p,Strongbad536,3,Tue Jun 30 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"I think were lookin for RW , right?  So, PA PARENTEAU, MONTREAL CANADIENS, 32 Previous cap charge: $4 million    DREW STAFFORD, WINNIPEG JETS, 29 Previous cap charge: $4 million    JOEL WARD, WASHINGTON CAPITALS, 34 Previous cap charge: $3 million    JUSTIN WILLIAMS, LOS ANGELES KINGS, 33 Previous cap charge: $3.65 million    JIRI TLUSTY, WINNIPEG JETS,27 Previous cap charge: $2.95 million    Those are the ones listed right now.   How would everyone feel about Lusty back again for 2 mil or so AND maybe Williams for 3ish? Almost all the cap hit would be eaten by our getting rid of Semin. EDIT: just realized how crappy the free agent market is this summer.... even these guys are going to get paid well... damn it."
canes,3bn82p,sprgrss,2,Tue Jun 30 17:48:06 2015 UTC,Yeah thats the problem. There arent many free agents out there. I can see us going for Tlusty again. Maybe Williams for a short term deal
canes,3bn82p,venduss,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Tlusty has hip problems and is slow as hell. I'd rather not have him back honestly.

canes,3borgp,s1apshot,5,Tue Jun 30 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"Guys, we can afford him now"
canes,3borgp,ccarico,2,Tue Jun 30 22:39:35 2015 UTC,But is the need there?
canes,3borgp,ccarico,2,Tue Jun 30 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Hell yes there is, You telling me you're comfortable with Hainsey, Liles, and Jordan on the left side? I'm not going to put Hanifin in that group until we see him at training camp even though he'll probably beat out Jordan"
canes,3borgp,ccarico,2,Tue Jun 30 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, is the need so great that we should pull him in instead of a new forward?"
canes,3borgp,Jughead1788,2,Tue Jun 30 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"I would say yes because even with Hanifin we would probably have Hainsey paired with Faulk on the top pair against other teams top players. Hainsey shouldn't be a top pairing guy, period.   Looking at the next pair tie either Hanifin or Liles with Wiz. You want a rookie paired with Wiz having to learn how to not only play at the NHL level but also learn to cover for your offensive partners pinches? I'd like to see him with a more stable partner personally. Or you would have Liles and Wiz which would inevitably become battle of the bad pinches.    Now the third pair is also kind of scary because you would have Liles or Jordan with Murphy. Murphy also needs a stabilizing defensive partner which Liles is not. Jordan fits the role of a third pair guy but he wouldn't be my first choice for putting with murphy.    Now Put Sekera on top with Faulk and we know we have a tandem that has seen time as a top pair and can perform well. This would allow us to put Hainsey with Murphy to cover for him(Because as of now I think Murphy would still need it more) or put him with Wiz in the case of Hanifin not making the team. Then you are free to match the third pair as you wish with any of Jordan, Liles, and Murphy. I don't know about you but that sounds a lot better to me."
canes,3borgp,Jughead1788,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"As uncomfortable with the defense as I am, I am MUCH more uncomfortable with the forwards. 27th (?) in goals for is bad, we might have good luck with Hanifin coming in and fitting in immediately, but I don't see us having anything coming in/up that will make a difference to score any more goals."
canes,3borgp,Jughead1788,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:05:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on that, which is why I want the best defense we can put together. This years UFA crop isnt the kind to give us a player who will fix that problem"

canes,3borgp,Volan1,2,Wed Jul 1 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think Fleury has the better chance, McKeown needs time to develop more. I think McKeown is one of those sit an wait a few years for a the good payoff, where as Fleury might be a bit faster to make the jump."

canes,3borgp,untouchedURL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:26:39 2015 UTC,Based on Fleurys last junior season I think he might still need a year or two to be ready.
canes,3bry4e,ccarico,7,Wed Jul 1 17:42:48 2015 UTC,he is still consistently trading away 1st round picks tho
canes,3bry4e,BarkMingo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"And now that team has the potential to be in contract hell.  Sure it's pretty common to have a lot of cap tied up in a few players, but he's doing to same thing he did with us. That team is going to be great for a while but as those guys age all these good picks they gave up to get them is going to hurt their depth in the future. Granted the top talent there is probably better than what we ever had here but it's definitely traditional JR with his win now attitude and no regard for the future."
canes,3bry4e,mattfki5g,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:05:17 2015 UTC,"yeah and he knows he's only there for another year or two, future be damned...which is good for us"
canes,3bry4e,BarkMingo,3,Thu Jul 2 14:49:46 2015 UTC,I'm fine with this. We would've given up a ton for Kessel.
canes,3bry4e,notleonardodicaprio,-5,Wed Jul 1 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"No, thanks. Kessel is a selfish headcase. And now Pittsburgh has something like $30m tied up in 5 players. All while giving away their best offensive prospect, and another first round pick. Not to mention he basically gave away Despres last season.  Right now their D consists of Letang, Maata, Scuderi and Pouliot. They have barely any grit at all, and their bottom 6 is weak at best.   Their depth is weak, their D is not great and they have nothing for the future.   I have faith in GMRF and Peters. They are building this thing the right way without mortgaging our future."
canes,3bry4e,TheLordTrolldemort,7,Wed Jul 1 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"I love Ronnie Franchise as well, but I don't think it's fair to call Kessel a ""selfish headcase"""
canes,3bry4e,Wcw2508,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a headcase, I'll give you that. But all accounts are he is a pretty stubborn and selfish player. But who knows, that could have been caused from the environment in Toronto as well.   I still think they gave up too much while ignoring their needs on D and bottom 6."
canes,3bry4e,TheLordTrolldemort,5,Wed Jul 1 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with not liking the Pens situation, but what you said about Kessel isn't true."
canes,3bry4e,Jiggaboozer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Read my other comment :). I'll agree that he isn't a headcase. But he has at times been absolutely selfish and stubborn. Again, like I said, his perceived attitude could have been a result of being in Toronto though. I know I'd probably be a Grade-A asshole if I were in the situation he was in.   I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but all I've read and heard about him indicates he can be exceptionally difficult to coach and play with. No denying the talent though, that's for sure. He is gonna put up some serious numbers whether it be next to Crosby or Malkin."
canes,3bry4e,TheLordTrolldemort,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"Most of the stuff that said he was uncoachable came straight out of the Toronto media, which blows up every situation if things aren't going well. He isn't an outspoken guy and he handled this entire situation well, while being treated horribly by Toronto. Only complaint would maybe be the effort the entire team lacked, including Kessel, but other than that there aren't any glaring character issues with the guy. I would have loved to have him on our team, he is a 100% game changing player."
canes,3bry4e,Jiggaboozer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Won't argue that, at all. He is a hell of a player. Still not quite sure I would have wanted him here. Until he proves everything the media in Toronto said is wrong, I'm still on the fence about his attitude.   Of course, I could very well be apologizing and eating crow this time next year, but only time will tell ;)."
canes,3bry4e,TheLordTrolldemort,5,Wed Jul 1 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Kessel is a selfish headcase.   lol what?   They have barely any grit at all   I will give you that, that is a JR signature right there  I think Phil can score 50-60 as Sid's winger, this is a good deal short-term, and JR knows he's only there short-term and doesn't really care about the penguins future, and I'm ok with that"
canes,3bry4e,BarkMingo,-2,Wed Jul 1 19:15:21 2015 UTC,Kessel isn't that great either.

Also just b/c we didn't get somebody on Day ONE of the trade free agency doesn't mean the sky is falling, Chicken Little."

canes,3brzb0,BarkMingo,2,Thu Jul 2 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"Things definitely feel different today watching other teams make large moves. I dont know if I feel quite apocalyptic like you sound, but I do not feel warm and fuzzy inside, we haven't improved as much as I would like. Wiz is cool, lack is really cool, but other than those, I dont see any improvements.     Because we are lacking in every department (def/off/goal), we dont have the assets to trade for anything good."
canes,3brzb0,Digital_Geist,6,Wed Jul 1 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I'd rather us not get caught up in the craziness that is the first day of free agency. Our team will be better next year based solely on the increased health of our top 6 forwards. Lindholm has another year under his belt. Lack is a starting caliber, get you to the playoffs, style goalie. Wiz is a way better and more productive Tim Gleason (with offensive upside). We got a lot better already this off season. We're a young team. Why blow that up to make a splash? The Panthers haven't done that and after a few bumps they're a regular playoff team. We're getting there. The team isn't moving. We're making smart moves that make us more competitive without bloating our cap. Would you really want to say a Matt Belesky for over 5mil a year? I wouldn't."
canes,3brzb0,Chilldyl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"Belesky for 5 mil, no. Sekera for 5.5 I would say yes. He played top pairing here quite effectively, that's not a bad contract. I do agree that we will do better than last year, but by how much? Perhaps shoring up the defense (some) will allow our offense to flourish, but the matter of the fact is we dont have a lot of scoring skill. Eric,Skinner, Lindholm are our only skilled (scoring) guys. Seems like most of our other players are interchangeable with most good teams 3rd/4th liners. PS: I left J Staal off the list of skill because his biggest attribute is not his scoring prowess."
canes,3brzb0,Digital_Geist,3,Wed Jul 1 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I would hesitate to give Sekera 5.5 mil for 6 years, especially with the D core we have waiting. I know, that is no guarantee. We have players coming up in a year or two max that would make that term a waste. Could we use more scoring? Definitely. Our Bottom 6 is pretty solid. Rask showed well at the International Level this year. I would say a top 6 RW would be great but this isn't the year to find a good one in Free Agency. I think we're a Wild Card team right now, if healthy and not snake bit. I doubt Lindholm, Skinner, or Eric would be 3rd or 4th liners. I doubt Jordan would be a 3rd liner (probably more of a 2nd defensive C on a good team). Our issue is we're young. Rask, on a good team is probably a 3/4 c, I'll give you that. Our 3rd/4th lines are pretty good. And I think if we can get a RW then we'll be even better but I'd rather not over spend for one this off season and damage our future. But yea, top 6 wing is an issue. Sorry, a little spaced and ranting. I'm writing this around work.   Do I think we're world beaters? No. But I do think there is cause for optimism. Maybe we bump Skinner or Lindholm up to the first line with the Staals and sign a middling 2/3 liner to play with Rask and whichever of Skinner/Lindholm isn't on the first. Pretty much anyone is better than Semin was up there at this point."

We are a team that could use some physicality to get us going a lot of nights and this could be an opportunity for two teams to fairly try to work different players into the lineup and see if they can gel better than the current system.
canes,3bk039,Jiggaboozer,2,Tue Jun 30 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"I could accept that. We would get a more defensively responsible player with scoring touch and they could get a scorer. I feel like Tarasenko is a similar player though, so they might not be that interested."
canes,3bk039,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:01:08 2015 UTC,I would agree but it seems the reason they aren't thrilled is Oshie hasn't been scoring other than in shootouts and they seem to want more of a pure scorer. I love our direction with such a bolstered D and I think Oshie would fit well. We also had so many 1 goal games (wins and losses) that having a shootout tool would be a nice addition. Not the reason I would want him but we could use the help there as a nice bonus...
canes,3bk039,pacefalmd,2,Tue Jun 30 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"Meh. I don't think there is much that Oshie offers that Skinner doesn't. I know Oshie is a shootout beast but Skinner on his game can be good in the shootout. During ""real"" game play I don't that Oshie is a big step up or step down from Skinner."
canes,3bk039,XdshortX,2,Tue Jun 30 15:15:08 2015 UTC,"That's kinda one of the reasons I think it would be a fair trade.  It seems Skinner doesn't gel well with some of the forwards like Staals.  If we could get a relativity equal player and not have to worry about concussions, it may be worth it.  Give us a chance to try someone else in the lineup and hopefully work with some of the forwards we have and probably wont move.  Better compatibility and maybe provide a spark that our offense could use.  It could be a nice way for GMRF to show he is trying to improve the offense."
canes,3bk039,notleonardodicaprio,2,Tue Jun 30 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"I just feel like it's a sidegrade between the two, with Oshie having a bit higher of a floor and lower of a ceiling. I'd rather ride Skinner and hope he can come out of this concussion stuff better off."
canes,3bk039,XdshortX,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"No. Older players aren't what we need. We aren't a playoff team, so taking on guys in their prime is a huge mistake."
canes,3bisb5,PantsinmyPants1211,3,Mon Jun 29 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I think something along the lines of this to start the season with what we have right now:    E. Staal - J. Staal - Semin    Skinner - Rask - Lindholm    Gerbe/Terry - Nash/Ryan - Nestrasil     Malone - McClement - Terry/Gerbe    Hainsey - Faulk    Liles/Hanifin (potentially) - Wisniewski   Liles/Jordan - Murphy    I'm still not comfortable with our LD potential and I think Semin will drop to the third line fairly quickly. I thinking a few prospects like Carrick, Biega, and Mcginn will push the guys at camp but not make the team. Also god knows what will happen with Boychuk, if we even resign him."
canes,3bisb5,s1apshot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"I like this defense: Hainsey-Faulk, Hanifin-Wisniewski, Liles-Murphy with Jordan at the 7th. I'd like to see more of Fleury if he's ready too.  Here's to hoping Semin can have a major bounce back season, because that first line absolutely must produce for us to have a good season. If they don't, we're in for more mediocrity."
canes,3bisb5,s1apshot,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"The problem I see is that Hainsey is at best the 4th of a top four d pairing on good teams, and the idea of Liles and Murphy scares the shit out of me..."
canes,3bisb5,XdshortX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"It could be, if Hanifin is flourishing in the NHL, that he is paired with Faulk on the top line. From what I've seen, he's extremely confident defending against highly skilled players in his own end. We'd then we drop Hainsey down with Murphy and pair Liles and Wisniewski."
canes,3bisb5,s1apshot,2,Mon Jun 29 16:59:38 2015 UTC,E Staal  J Staal  Semin  Gerbe  Rask  Lindholm  Skinner  Nash  Nestrasil  Malone  McClement  Terry  ????  Faulk  Hainsey  Wiz  Liles  Murphy
canes,3bisb5,s1apshot,2,Mon Jun 29 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"Skinner on the 3rd and Gerbe with Rask and Lindy? I hope Skinns continues to find Chemistry with Lindholm, who already has a bit with Rask, and forms a solid second line in Skinner-Rask-Lindholm. Gerbe Nash and Nesty would make a pretty good third too."
canes,3bisb5,pacefalmd,3,Mon Jun 29 16:35:25 2015 UTC,Don't forget we have Ryan signed and Nash is still an RFA. I think at least to start the season Ryan and Nash will compete for that spot. But yeah I doubt Gerbe plays Rasks wing over Skinner at the outset of the season
canes,3bisb5,XdshortX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"Right. Ryan will be an interesting wild card for the season. Have we not re-signed Nash yet? I think he's important to keep, but we have too many centers, so you're right, it'll probably be a battle to see who plays the 3-4 C spots."
canes,3bisb5,XdshortX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"It'll be a battle for the 3C, 4C is 100% McClement"
canes,3bisb5,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:30:20 2015 UTC,"We didn't qualify Nash, so he's going to walk. Perhaps the market won't be there for him and we re-sign him, but i doubt it."
canes,3bjv20,armadachamp,11,Mon Jun 29 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"So as far as Hanifin goes, all signs point to him starting in the NHL next year. I'm not sure if he will be on the 2nd or 3rd pair but he will see time in the NHL for sure. Its not like Murphy who needed a few years to get to the NHL. A lot of people had him going 3rd behind 2 ""generational talents."" He's going to be really fucking good and we got him with the 5th pick.    As for the trades, Wisneiwski was number 3 in PP goals by defensmen last year. He will be able to run a PP unit with Faulk on the other. He isn't as good as Sekera overall, but he is solid and will fill out our D-corps while Hanifin/Fluery/McKowen get to be good NHL players. Lack has the ability to take over the starting spot from Cam. Everyone thought he would be the start in Vancouver after they dealt Luongo, but when the signed Miller he was a backup again. If Lack plays well this year and challenges for the starting job then Cam will have to take a bigger paycut if we don't sign him to an extension this summer, or he will be moved.      The reason all this is exciting is because GMRF is addressing needs in a way that isn't screwing us for the future. The two picks we sent for Lack were a 3rd round and 7th round. There is like a 20% chance that those 2 picks will land 1 NHL player.* We now have 2 NHL players, a good defensman and possible future starting goalie for what is essentially a larger cap hit(whatever we are no where near the cap anyway) and 2 picks that probably wouldn't pan out anyway.     *NHL player is someone who plays 100+ games. From here I took the third round number and 7th round number and averaged. Probably not right, so correct me if I'm wrong."
canes,3bjv20,Hurricane_Viking,7,Mon Jun 29 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"Let's go point by point, because I had the same mentality last season going into it and I'm actually pretty optimistic.   It seems like we swapped a capable goalie and two draft picks for a different capable goalie and a 31-year-old defenseman with a big contract who might've been cut anyway   Dobby had a good 2013-14, but he was anything but capable last year. Of the 37 goalies that played over 1500 minutes last year, he was 36th in sv%. Ward was 34th. Lack didn't fare tooo much better, but he's on the upswing of his career. I don't get that same sense from Dobby.  Wisnewski is a decent defenseman, I'd reckon like a Hainsey with a bit more offensive upside. I'm actually excited to see him paired with one of our more stay at home defensemen, especially if Hanifin can play this year. He'd be a great mentor for him, and he's by all accounts a good teammate. That and we save 2 million next year on his contract vs cap hit. That's not what everyone wants to hear, but them's the brakes with PK.   We also drafted a defenseman who we probably won't be able to develop effectively, like our previous picks other than Faulk.   Hanifin is one of the better defensive prospects of the past 5 years, and by far the best one we've drafted in our franchise. I hear you on our inability to develop talent, but I feel like a lot of that falls on Jeff Daniels, who is no longer coaching our AHL team (I've been calling for him to go for years now). I get the pessimism, but this is a new regime.  Here's what we have to be happy about. We, as a team, shot about 3% below our average, and there's a common belief around the league that shooting % is pretty static, so hopefully there will be a strong upswing as we regress to the mean. We were the 5th best team in shot suppression last year. That's up 19 places from Muller's last year. Bill Peters is the real fucking deal. His hammer hands will lead us to the future. Our PK finished top 5 as well, and our power play in the top 10 iirc. His system works, we just need better goaltending and average shooting. We've got more to be excited about this coming year than the past probably 5 years, imo."
canes,3bjv20,pacefalmd,2,Mon Jun 29 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"This. All of this. I have not been this excited about the Canes in awhile. I promise folks, Peters and Francis know what they're doing. Don't sleep on Lindholm either, this kid has stud written all over him and could really boost our scoring."
canes,3bgf9w,Johnny_Mo88,8,Mon Jun 29 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"I figure Ward will start game 1, and Lack will play into the starters role by Christmas"
canes,3bgf9w,goochnorris,4,Mon Jun 29 10:05:00 2015 UTC,Im really excited for him to get an opportunity to be a starter in this league. Cant wait to follow the canes again.  Lets just hope the staals and skinner can stay healthy.
canes,3bgf9w,ImAnAfricanCanuck,6,Mon Jun 29 05:08:11 2015 UTC,He's probably not going to start over Ward but poor Cam stays hurt so he will probably end up getting to. He seems like a super great guy and I'm excited to have him on the team
canes,3bgf9w,APPaholic47,2,Mon Jun 29 09:35:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty excited to see him take the ice as well. If Skinner does get shipped out the Staal brothers stay healthy will be huge for us.
canes,3bd6h0,s1apshot,6,Sun Jun 28 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"He's a 6'4"", clear 1st line center. Those players don't grow on trees. He's year in and year out our leading scorer. Look at what he did during the lockout shortened season when he had a motivated Semin on his line. Their line lead the league in points til the whole team took a nosedive. He's still a top center in the league if you give him competent linemates. I expect him to sign for around 7 per, which I would gladly pay."
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,3,Sun Jun 28 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, which is why I'm fine with us dealing away Skinner. He's got no chemistry with Staal. Staal needs good linemates to perform at his best."
canes,3bd6h0,notleonardodicaprio,2,Sun Jun 28 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Unless we get a really good return, I don't want to deal Skinner. We'd be selling him super low, and I'd rather take the risk that he can come back from his concussions and reclaim that rookie form. Besides, he seemed to have pretty good chemistry with Lindholm."
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,2,Sun Jun 28 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"If we can get a top forward that can play alongside Staal, then I'd be ok with dealing Skinner. But yeah, anything less wouldn't be worth it."
canes,3bd6h0,notleonardodicaprio,2,Sun Jun 28 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be fine with that trade. I just don't think we'd get close to that."
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"Top centers in the league don't need people to perform. They make those around them better. Anytime you have to say ""this guys is elite, but..."" He's not."
canes,3bd6h0,XdshortX,2,Mon Jun 29 08:26:11 2015 UTC,Luckily I never said he was elite
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:16:46 2015 UTC,Same sentiment applies.
canes,3bd6h0,XdshortX,2,Mon Jun 29 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Who do you propose we replace him with that can come close to filling his shoes? Rask has second line potential at best, and I don't see lindholm developing into a 1st line center either.   I'll never understand the hate people have for Estaalo the player. Criticize the captain all you want, I have to. All he's done as a player is lead the team in scoring almost every year he's been here. Him (and his brother) are top 15 in corsi for % relative to their team in the fucking league. Unless your name is Crosby, if you have shitty linemates, you're going to struggle. And I don't see Sid walking through the door to the PNC."
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Build through the draft, but you don't get that by keeping declining players to do well enough to keep out of the league's basement. You move him for a package of players and picks to add depth to the roster, and prospects to our organization. You're not getting 1 for 1 production immediately, but we're not a playoff team anyway, so what's the point in that?  Advanced stats are well and good, but watch the games, and tell me that Eric is a top center on most other teams in the league. The only teams that he would be considered a top center for are the teams in our exact position, and even they have players that make others better in some way (ie Girgensons and Kessel). He consistently doesn't start well, is lackadaisical defensively, and turns it on when people start to question why the fuck we should be paying him 9 million dollars, if anything at all. By then it's too late in the year to matter so all it ends up doing is fucking our draft position.   He used to be a player you could expect those things from, but he's not any more and we need to move on."
canes,3bd6h0,XdshortX,2,Mon Jun 29 17:04:31 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but you lost all credibility when you compared Eric to Girgenson
canes,3bd6h0,XdshortX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Did I compare? No. I said Zegmus makes those around him better. He competes for pucks, makes smart plays, and his work ethic rubs off on who he plays with."
canes,3bd6h0,tluck81,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:56:02 2015 UTC,If you'd rather have Girgensons over Staal you need to get your head checked.    Not to mention that Girgensons does not have that effect on people.

canes,3bd6h0,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"It's like I want him back. I really do, but not for long. Eric has been going down hill for the past couple of years now. Now a heavy slope mind you, but a slight slope. So I say, fuck it. Sign him back, but not a long contract. Just long enough to squeeze his last good years out."
canes,3bd6h0,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:22:04 2015 UTC,Injuries tend to do that. Especially one that wasn't his fault.
canes,3bd6h0,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully between Eric and Cam signing new contracts we can save 4-5M/year. With that savings we can hopefully find a real good top 6 winger. If we can do that after this year and get our young D guys another year to develop we would be sitting in a real good spot.
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:37 2015 UTC,I think we should be able to knock Eric down to the 7-7.5 range and Ward down to the 4.5 area which is atleast worth a 2 line player for sure
canes,3bd6h0,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:22:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pay Ward more than 3 personally.
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:28:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking we would end up with 6.5-7 for Staal and 3-3.5 for Ward. I was thinking 3-4 years for both but now I'm second guessing the length.
canes,3bd6h0,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"I was trying to stay on the high side for a more realistic look, if Ward plays like he did this past season going to UFA will get him atleast 4 mil"
canes,3bdcz1,LeafsFacebookFan,7,Sun Jun 28 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"I think we could put up a fight for the wild card. I think we're going to end up a lot like CBJ did this past season, a middle of the pack team that just doesn't quite have the ability to push into the wild card, but you never know. On the Skinner trade, I don't think I'd trade him for that it doesn't feel like a deal that benefits us frankly."
canes,3bdcz1,AwHellNaw24,2,Sun Jun 28 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, if everything goes well we could be in the race for a wild card spot at the end of the year. As for trading Skinner, I think we hang on to him until someone gives us what we want. We don't NEED to move him, I think its just something that RF is looking at doing. No need to jump into anything."
canes,3bdcz1,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon Jun 29 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Skinner shouldn't be moved for the sake of trading him."
canes,3bdcz1,AwHellNaw24,15,Mon Jun 29 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"We're not contenders. We're a middling team that will pick between 7-10 next year.   Skinner should be moved just because he's shying away from the game that made him stand out the more hits he takes. He doesn't work the boards, he doesn't go to the front of the net any more, and he could never play defense. Not to mention the foot speed isn't there either, and he just doesn't have chemistry with anybody on our roster. He can't play with Eric because they don't mesh and that'd give Peters a stroke from lack of defense, Jordan is too defensive minded, it's too much to ask of Rask as a rookie/second year player, and the rest are only bottom 6 options. Sell high on him, and get pieces to play the kind of game Peters wants."
canes,3bdcz1,XdshortX,5,Sun Jun 28 07:38:16 2015 UTC,"Sell high? If we trade him now, we are trading him at his absolute lowest value since he broke into the league lol"
canes,3bdcz1,inSTAALed,5,Sun Jun 28 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Depending on how well our D prospects have progressed I could see us being a contender for a wild card spot. In a few years time our D could definitely be championship good between faulk, mckeown, hanifin, mcginn, wiz, murphy, etc we have a great young core there for the future. Cam and Lack could turn out to be  a solid goaltending duo, but we really lack offense. Unless RF can work some serious magic (wouldn't surprise me based on his actions so far) AND those prospects really pan out way earlier than anyone expected you can look forward to a much better season, but still probably end up in the 10-14 pick area next year.  But don't despair! I know as canes fans our motto has been ""NEXT YEAR!"" but with the new coaching and management a real change has taken place in the attitude and culture in Raleigh NC, and we'll continue to see improvement, and that 10-14 pick will be important for our road ahead.  As far as a skinner trade,  I love the kessel run but I really doubt Toronto would be willing to trade one ""under-performing"" forward for another with injury issues. Skinner can be a serious asset when he's on his game, but he apparently just doesn't mesh with the rest of the team or the system, hopefully we can get something decent in return for him, and he can be the weapon we all know he's capable of being, but I just don't see us pulling Kessel with Skinner as the main draw."
canes,3bdcz1,pyromaster55,8,Sun Jun 28 12:19:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I am concerned I don't want to see Skinner unless he is packaged for Kessel. I can't think of anyone else who we could get in return that offers the pure goal scoring ability Skinner brings to the table. As for being a cup contender I would say it is near impossible, but I could see us contending for a playoff spot at a lower seed. I think our coaching is good and we have brought in the talent necessary to win. I would love to see Hanifin and Faulk together, and it's been a long time since we had a defense to be proud of."
canes,3bdcz1,Jiggaboozer,2,Sun Jun 28 07:28:57 2015 UTC,"I would say we aren't quite there yet. Could we make the playoffs? Absolutely. Could we make it to the conference or cup finals? Doubtful.  I think the team going into next season (pending any major shakeups between now and the start of the season) is going to be pretty formidable. We made three excellent pickups with Hanifin from the draft, and Lack and Wiz from the two trades.  Ironically, the past few years, we've always made worry about out defense. Going into this year, I'm hoping our offense can pick up the pace now. We need to see some good offense generated from the Staals, Semin, and Skinner."
canes,3bdcz1,NotAMythOrLegend,2,Sun Jun 28 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on goaltending. We were a very competitive team last year after the new year. We finished with a top 3 PK and a top 10 powerplay, were in the top half of the league in possession. Our goaltending was our achilles heel last year. If we can get above average goaltending, I think we end the season in a wild card spot."
canes,3bdcz1,pacefalmd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"I think our goaltending was average last year. If you look at our schedule from December last year we lost a bunch of 1-2, 1-3(w/ empty net) games. We aren't going to win many games only scoring 1 goal a game. Ward put up average numbers, and Dobby's was only slightly below him. Our offense was the achilles heel last year, we were 27th in Goals/game. We were 18th in GA/game."
canes,3bdcz1,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon Jun 29 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"The only reason we weren't further down in GA/game is because we were very good at shot suppression (5th in the league). Ward is 49th in sv% for all goalies that played at least 480 minutes, and Dobby was 57%. That's not average, that's straight ass. Offense was obviously a problem too, but that had more to do with our shooting % than anything. We were shooting around 4.5% in February last year, almost 3 standard deviations below. Both need an upgrade, but I bet a regression to the mean with regards to shooting % helps our offense more than anything."
canes,3bdcz1,pacefalmd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Once I actually looked at some of our teams stats(2nd lowest in shots against, 19th in GA, 26th in team Save%) I've come to a decision..."
canes,3bdcz1,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"And this is the brightest spot for me. We jumped from 24th in the league in 13-14 in shots against per 60 to fucking 5th. Our defense is lightyears ahead of what it was under Muller. We're going to miss Sekera, but with Hanafin/Fleury coming up and another year in Peters system, if we can just get average goaltending, we'll become hopefully a top 7ish defensive team in the league."
canes,3bdcz1,pacefalmd,3,Mon Jun 29 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"No, we will probably be a bottom 5 team. We are returning essentially the same team as last year that finished in the bottom 5. We have improved the future slightly through this draft, but nothing that will have a big impact on next season. Wiz will be fine but he's no better than Sekera, and we weren't anything with Sekera anyway. Hanifin should be great but who knows what he will be like next year, if he even plays.   The team is still riddled with bad contracts for underperforming players. Eric, Semen, Ward, and Skinner are still on the books for a lot of money and will all surely have a underwhelming season. Terry is currently slotted in as a first line winger...  The team needs a couple of more years to be competitive. But the future is looking fine. On defense we should be set in a few years. By that time Rask and Lindholm will be developed, Eric will be on a manageable contract, Semen will be gone, Ward will be gone, and we should have some money to invest.  So long post short, bottom 5 team again.   As for trading Skinner, I would certainly jump on a trade for Kessel. Unfortunately I have no idea why Toronto would bite on that and who we would package with Skinner."
canes,3bdcz1,Hurricane043,5,Sun Jun 28 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"So long post short, bottom 5 team again.   I don't think we were playing like a bottom 5 team at the end of the season anyways. If you're forced to start Riley Nash as your 1C for several games in October, you're gonna have a bad time. Our game improved so much once J Staal came back. I'm very excited to see how we come out the gate if we're all healthy. I'm not expecting playoffs, but I see us like near the wildcard at least."
canes,3bdcz1,Volan1,3,Sun Jun 28 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, though.  For a team to be a contender, it can't take them 60 games to get competitive.  And one player being out (yes, i know Jordan wasn't the only one) shouldn't drop you to the bottom of the league if you have the depth to be a contender, which the Canes did not.    One positive is that Peters looks like he fixed the work ethic issues but core skills are still an issue, e.g. they need to figure out their passing game in October and not March and you can't lose the majority of your physical battles and expect hockey in late April.    I think this still puts the Canes as a team that will be just out of a wild card spot, but if they are healthy early on (a big if, I know) there should at least be decent hockey in the first half of the season."
canes,3bdcz1,NancyGracesTesticles,5,Sun Jun 28 17:57:11 2015 UTC,"That isn't fair. Eric was injured before the season and missed a bunch early on in the season plus wasn't exactly in the best shape of his life because of his injury. Jordan went down int he preseason and missed half the year. Jeff was injured/concussed in the beginning of the season and we don't really know what he tried to play through. Then we had Alex Semin who was coming back from wrist surgery over the summer and never really did anything all season and really just isn't part of Peter's system.   With as many problems we had at the beginning of the season. There was no climbing out of it, but by the end of it they were doing really well. They were ranked #1 in the PK in the league at the trade deadline before we sold off everyone. Also it was the first year of a new system that the team seemed to settle into.   So, no I don't think they are a bottom 5 team. I think they'll be a bubble team trying to push for the wildcard. Though we'll see what happens with free agency."
canes,3bdcz1,CraniumFornication,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"I expected us to start slow because of the new coach and the new system, shit like that takes time to get adjusted to, but then add in eric's injury, Jordan's injury, Skinner's, Semin being fucking useless (probably due to injury) dude we just got boned for the first half of the season, you really can't take that as an accurate representation of how this team will perform night in and night out.  I'm calling us a bubble team, just barely missing the playoffs this year, and a solid contender next year with a solid blue line and some decent moves by RF to improve the offensive situation.  But we're still a long way from Oct, and who knows what crazy tricks RF has up his sleeve to get us in a competitive position."

canes,3bb7ka,1952119211,2,Sat Jun 27 22:01:11 2015 UTC,As another nucks fan there is one more  strength that lack posses:  Attitude.  He's a goalie that doesn't get raddled on or off the ice. He posses a frank aloofness when speaking with the media that disarms interviewers and fans alike. He doesn't let a cheap play or a shitty goal get in his head and his overall personality is really positive with a huge derpy grin.   Why is Florida collecting out goalies dammit. FML.

canes,3bcud2,RuuTyutin,5,Sun Jun 28 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"I think we should add someone who can play wing on the 2/3 line. If Skinner/Semin can actually play like top 6 forwards then our top 6 is pretty set with them, Staals, Lindholm, Rask. If Skinner or Semin(or both) still suck then we will need a second line winger pretty bad.    I think Ward would be a good fit. Im sure he would be a guy that Peters likes. He can move up and down the lineup and be productive."

canes,3b93b7,pacefalmd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"All the draft publications I read last year had him nowhere near the 4th round, and to say he is about as good as Jordan, a guy who played a quarter of last season in the NHL and was a very good AHL d-man, is ludicrous, IMO. His stats are also below average across the board, even Levi (who is a NHL longshot himself) outproduced Wesley in junior. Even Rissanen finally played a few games in the NHL this year. Wesley will have to improve a ton to even get a sniff of the NHL like Jordan and Rissanen did.  I just don't think he's that good. I feel very strongly that he probably wouldn't have been drafted at all by us if his dad wasn't Glen Wesley, and there's a decent chance he might have not been drafted at all without NHL pedigree."

I think it's possible but it'd be a pretty big gamble to get rid of Ward right now after his first decent season in a while after Khudobin regressed a little under the larger load. Granted Khudobin had no scoring support in most of his games.  For what we'd have to give up to get a halfway decent goalie, which there are only a couple of on the market right now, I'm not sure we can take the hit to our depth at other positions. Hopefully it's a pretty cheap and short term deal for both of those players and I think that's the best we can do unless Francis works some magic."
canes,3b4w1e,s1apshot,2,Fri Jun 26 13:37:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I think moving Dobby is a good option considering he is a very good backup who can play as a starter when needed. He is also in the last year of his deal at a much smaller cap hit so we could probably trade him for a second or third round pick by the trade deadline.
canes,3b4w1e,sprgrss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:59:39 2015 UTC,Given the cost it will take to re-sign ward?  Absolutely.
canes,3b4w1e,mattfki5g,2,Fri Jun 26 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"We really have no idea what kind of contract Ward will be offered. Like I said, hopefully it's cheap and short term. If he's asking for the same money he's getting now I agree we should move him, but I don't think you can just let Cam walk at this point and rely solely on Khudobin, especially when we still have no proven back up for Khudobin if Cam is gone. I think we'd be better off working towards bettering our other positions than having to worry about a goalie as well, especially for the price the Lehner just went for.   I just think hoping Khudobin is ready to be #1 is a huge gamble at this point."
canes,3b4w1e,sprgrss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Paying more than 2 million a year for a goalie should not happen.  Ward will earn more than 2 million.
canes,3b4w1e,mattfki5g,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:01:03 2015 UTC,Khudobin is making more than 2 million right now. No telling what Cam would get paid but if you think he will get paid less than Khudobin anywhere else then I don't know what to tell you. Goalies aren't cheap.   Lehner is making about the same as Khudobin and Buffalo gave up a first rounder to get him. Who backs up Khudobin all season and what happens if Khudobin is a flop as a starter?  Not trying to be condescending but all you've said is that we should move Ward but haven't mentioned what we should do after that.
canes,3b4w1e,sprgrss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:07:52 2015 UTC,There are lots of options the Canes can go with.  The economics of goalies is such that a team is better off paying less for a goalie and spending that money on defenseman and forwards then it is on goalies.  A middling goalie that can be got on the cheap is better overall for a team's winning percentage than a good goalie that isn't cheap.
canes,3b4w1e,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:27:34 2015 UTC,so who is gonna be our main goalie? Khudobin has shown with his regression this past season that it's not him...

I'm not a big on what I've seen of his leadership qualities, but I'm sure there is a lot that we don't see.  All that being said, not having someone with Cole's stop-start speed to open up ice for him definitely hurts him. God putting him with Kessel or Ovi...I can only imagine."

On the other hand, he's one bad hit away from calling it a career and that would hurt more than anything.  At the end of the day, Hockey is a business like every other and you want the best talent.

canes,3azqv0,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Well considering it'd be practically impossible to move Semin without getting destroyed in the trade it makes perfect sense why we would move Skinner and not Semin.  No one is gong to argue that if we could get good value from Semin that we should move him. But his contract, his perceived lack of work ethic and commitment, and his monumental fall off this year basically mean it'd be a salary dump and nothing more. Making that decision is a lot harder than trading a young potential star on a decent contract and huge upside potential for pieces better suited on our team. You can't argue that Skinner has been in decline since his injuries and just looks out of place in Peters' system last season.  I don't think you can really blame the current management if we move Skinner and not Semin. The Semin contract is all on JR and the sole reason we are basically stuck with him hoping for something more."
canes,3azqv0,mattfki5g,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:26:27 2015 UTC,I dunno moving skinner over semin to me seems like moving a 3rd arm over removing a cancerous tumor. You really don't want to keep that cancerous tumor. But you really don't want to give somebody else that 3rd arm.
canes,3azqv0,thebl4ckd0g,2,Fri Jun 26 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"Basically the only way Semin gets moved if it's with the 5th overall. I personally don't think it's worth losing the 5th just to dump salary. Even if we get a decent older player back I think we are to the point where we need to be thinking younger. I agree Semin is problem right now, but he is a skilled player when he wants to be and COULD turn it around. Skinner could too but the injury situation is a scary one. I think Skinner is a good player, don't get me wrong, I just don't think it's as simple as 'move Semin instead'. Skinner is one of the few players that could realistically get us a pretty decent return."

We had to get somebody for Eric to shine, and now we're stuck with Semin. Skinner has players to feed off, he just doesn't work with them.

Despite his concussion history, I believe Skinner would have a breakout year once he gets finally paired on a good line with people who are good to complement him (i mean come on, look at our history of trying to pair Eric Staal unsuccessfully with people over the past 5 years - that Semin/Staal/Tlustly line seems like a fluke now)."

Leaving us with Hanfin (not a bad take considering some say he should be 3rd).  But I pose the question if Marner/Strome is still there, do you think it is easier to fill in top 6 forward scoring talent, or top 4 defense talent in the free market?"
canes,3aqqpp,Digital_Geist,3,Mon Jun 22 20:55:04 2015 UTC,"Top 6 forward would be cheaper and, for us, easier. Look at what some of the top 4 dmen got last year, and what Marc Staal and similar players are asking for now.    That being said with McKowen and Fleury coming up I think we have more defensive depth in prospects than forwards. So taking a top end forward is more filling our ""needs"". At the end of the day, we are in the easiest position out of Arz/Tor. They have to make a choice out of the three, while we just get whats left. If they take Strome/Marner and one is a bust in a few years, they look like the idiot and we laugh while Faulk and Hanifin are shutting everyone down on our top pair."

canes,3aqqpp,Wcw2508,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:24:18 2015 UTC,Marner has the least amount of risk of the three and he would be my choice if he was available.   I am super excited about Hanifin though if he falls to us. Strome seems to have the highest risk of the three.
canes,3aqqpp,notleonardodicaprio,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"He also said here that if Hanifin falls to 5th, he'd be a huge steal for us. Honestly, it's such a deep draft that I'm happy with Strome, Hanifin, or Marner. Hell, I'd be fine with Provorov too."
canes,3aqqpp,XdshortX,2,Tue Jun 23 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm gonna be happy with whoever we get. I just commented above, I think we are in a easy spot. 95% of people expect Marner/Hanfin/Strome at 3/4/5 we just get to take whose left. If whoever Arz/Tor takes is a bust, they look like the idiot for not taking the right guy, if we bust then at least everyone agrees it was the right pick at the time."
canes,3aqqpp,XdshortX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:25:30 2015 UTC,Be careful what you say. I'm sure people said they'd be happy no matter who we picked before we drafted Boychuck too.

canes,3aqqpp,BarkMingo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"Its the top question when I posted this.    The big discussion as of late is which one of Marner/Hanfin/Strome is left at 5 for us. It sounds like Arizona is leaning towards Strome. Leaving Tor/us with Marner/Hanifin. Toronto fans seem to want Marner from the thread, but maybe they want the blue liner to take over for Phaneuf?"
canes,3apzy8,APPaholic47,8,Mon Jun 22 15:52:40 2015 UTC,Brock McGinn for sure. Such a hard working gritty player. I'd really like to see Sergey Tolchinsky get a shot though. He'd be so much fun to watch with Skinner and Lindholm.
canes,3apzy8,CanesHockey89,3,Mon Jun 22 19:24:25 2015 UTC,McGuinn is the kind of player we have been lacking too

canes,3aokhs,mattfki5g,9,Mon Jun 22 06:38:48 2015 UTC,Its dead because this isn't happening. Carolina needs young talent ready to play and the top 6-8 players in this draft could all be playing big minutes in the NHL next season. The thought that Carolina would trade the #5 pick just to dump salary is ludicrous. If they got some huge return then maybe.

canes,3af3no,Skizzered,3,Fri Jun 19 19:01:51 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Eric is the reason Lindholm and Skinner are playing at the level that they're at right now. He's definitely important in a rebuild.

Justin Faulk, emerging d-man that is underrated, all-star/Olympian . Elias Lindholm, versatile forward that has an uncapped future. You most likely already know about the Staals and Skinner.

canes,3a0f02,thebl4ckd0g,2,Tue Jun 16 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"Well being a Caps fan you are already familiar with disappointment. So step 1 is complete. Step 2 would be learning how to enjoy the games despite losing. BBQ nachos, beer, tailgating help with that. Also lots of crying. Step 3 would be getting hype about the draft, Marner/Hanfin/Strome will all be playing a big part of our team over the next few years. If we draft Crouse, get your pitchforks ready. Step 4, Always remember the golden year, 2006. Cary is basically ""New Pittsburgh"" so fuck the Pens. Buffalo fans are a bunch of chodes, so fuck them too. Other Northeast teams will take over our arena too, which is a shame but most of them aren't dicks, so when we stop sucking it will probably stop happening as much."

As far as hockey goes, we don't really care who you're a fan of, so long as you're respectful. There's a reason Philly games are somewhat empty (their fans are dicks).

Last year some of the people from hfboards met up at Backyard Bistro instead - it was pretty slow in there so it was nice to be able to converse with people without screaming and they put on the draft on the big projectors for us. Might be cool if we can coordinate something like that again.

canes,39yqad,Hirgwath,3,Tue Jun 16 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"Plus his guaranteed money is more than his AHL salary would be so I think they are assuming he will play some in the NHL. He seems like a playmaker, which this team desperately needs (albeit probably no better then a 3rd liner maybe a fringe nhler) but he may be able to help with Semin or Skinners scoring."
canes,39yqad,s1apshot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:07:15 2015 UTC,Agreed
canes,39yqad,Tazyrelliex,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"He has said he had multiple offers from different NHL teams, and he didn't pick Hurricanes because of the money. So he's most likely been promised to play for you in the NHL. The guy is probably better than you'd expect as well. The guy was a hero in ÖHK and was awarded the best player in SHL, which isn't really crap. He is however used to the bigger ice. He managed to make everyone around him play better in ÖHK. Not saying he's going to take top spot, because I definitely do not believe that. But he will most likely be getting the chance to prove himself as perhaps a 3rd liner."

canes,39x5f3,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon Jun 15 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think Marner or Strome would give a nice kick to the offense and my personal preference is Strome so we can have a logical heir to our 1c who may even allow us to mover Eric to the wing full time"
canes,39x5f3,boffosan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:01:30 2015 UTC,"I think we will see Eric stay at the wing, at least through the beginning of the season.

What he really means: ""Not big enough, not our guy""  Marner is definitely the offensive player I want to see fall the most, but if Ari/Tor takes him then that increases chance that Hanifin falls to us."
canes,39x5f3,Volan1,2,Mon Jun 15 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"I really don't get the ""He's not big enough"" argument. Patrick Kane is about his same size. Crosby is only 1-2 inches taller, Seguin is just 2-3 inches bigger. He isn't Gerbe sized. Imagine if Skinner could play defense and make better passes. As long as he doesn't try the same move over and over again(COUGH SKINNER COUGH) then he won't be trucked every time he gets the puck."
canes,39x5f3,XdshortX,2,Mon Jun 15 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that discounting him on his size is silly. But, the thing about Gerbe is that he's strong as hell. He's 6 inches shorter than Marner but 20 pounds heavier. Marner will no doubt pack on muscle as he gets older."
canes,39x5f3,XdshortX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly the player I would like to get the most is Strome, I think he would essentially become the heir apparent to our 1c or would atleast allow us to go to Eric on the wing full time (maybe even his wing)"

IMHO I think we need to either draft or trade for a power forward, a defenseman to compliment Murphy in the future or trade for an established defenseman to fill gap left by Sekara.  Thoughts?"
canes,39v9bi,ispoiler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"Here is what I think we need:    1) Skilled playmaking forward.   2) Top pair Dman.   3) Power forward.     4) Scoring forward prospects  I agree we need a good compliment to Murphy but I think adding scoring forward prospects to the pool takes a bit of a lead because we have a SERIOUS lack of prospects that project to be 2nd line or higher.     Regarding the #5 overall I think unless we get at top 10 pick and a seriously valuable forward prospect we have to stay with our pick. Passing on any of Strome/Marner/Hanefin would be plain stupid if we can't get Provorov or Crouse and I don't see either of them making it past pick 8.   Also in terms of the future on defense don't forget we have Haydn Fleury, Trevor Carrick, Brett Pesce, Jacob Slavin, and Roland McKeown in the system"
canes,39v9bi,s1apshot,2,Thu Jun 18 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Avs are offering us Freddie Hamilton or Mat Clark for one of our 4th round picks.
canes,39v9bi,ispoiler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely no on mat clark. Hamilton I'm not sure about, he adds depth but he projects to be a 3rd/4th line Center which we don't need. See if they are willing to trade us Rendulic for one of the 4ths. He's similar in potential to Hamilton but a RW which we have no depth at"
canes,39v9bi,s1apshot,2,Thu Jun 18 20:15:21 2015 UTC,Honestly. I dont think either prospect will make us better in the long run. Looking down in Charlotte.. we have both of those guys in that age bracket so it would just be reloading on the same guy.

canes,39hv3v,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:25:19 2015 UTC,Part of the problem has been our failure to develop many prospects that did go to the minors
canes,39hv3v,s1apshot,2,Fri Jun 12 19:15:08 2015 UTC,I think part of that is NHL level coaching. Maurice would stick any player that got called up on the 4th line and play them 4 mins a game. When Terry had his chances this year with Rask/Nash/Gerbe on the 3rd or 2nd(at the beginning of the season) he looked much more comfortable than Dalpe/Boychuk ever did on the 4th line.
canes,39gkhe,Digital_Geist,3,Thu Jun 11 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"trading Eric Staal would be a horrible move at this point. Trading them both and you think the team was bad last season? I swear some people really want this team to get sold and move out of our state. Despite what Gary Bettman says, it'll happen if fans don't care more.  Also you can't expect either Staal to be gauged on their performance last year, as they were both injured or playing injured for a good chunk of the season."

Without him, Jordan is not going to play as well at all, and if they're both traded, I'm very afraid that we won't get nearly the return for our captain and alternate that we should."
canes,39gkhe,PantsinmyPants1211,2,Thu Jun 11 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"Without him, Jordan is not going to play as well at all   then explain how his best years were in Pittsburgh, when he wasn't playing with his brother  I think we have to either sign him to a reasonable extension before this season, or trade him, because losing him for nothing would be a nightmare"
canes,39gkhe,BarkMingo,4,Thu Jun 11 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"I think there are a number of reasons why he's had his best seasons so far in Pitt:   Pittsburgh was a much more cohesive and better team than Carolina, arguably, for almost all the years Jordan was there. He was a skilled third line center who was big, and could score. That line was extremely hot between 2008 and 2011, and they all gelled very well. Since he's been in Carolina there has been a lot of changes and moving around of lines to try and get something that sticks. On the third line, he wasn't matched against the best defensive pairings, because the first two lines were centered by Malkin and Crosby. Playing for the Canes, he's at least the #2 Center, if not on the first line with Eric, so he's going to be smothered. He's played 3 seasons with the Canes, and only one of those was a full season (and had a major injury before the other shortened season), whereas he played 8 in Pittsburgh, on the same line effectively, and was very consistent.   For his only full season, on a much worse team than the 2008-2012 Penguins (Consistent playoff team, and recent Stanley Cup Champs) he has put up almost comparable numbers to his best years in Pittsburgh. Him and Eric just started to get more chemistry together at the end of this year when they were put together. He also came to Carolina to play with Eric.

canes,380yyj,A-Bear,2,Mon Jun 1 01:28:07 2015 UTC,"We have the players for a playoff team. Given, a lower seeded playoff team, and (in my opinion) definitely not a Cup team, but we could make the playoffs. Our problem is that every year, something happens that prevents us from being good. Jordan's injury, Ward's injury x2, Semin not producing the way we all know he can, etc etc. Skinner didn't have a great season last year either. With the new management and Bill Peters, I think we could get something going, but I'm not very optimistic.   However, at the end of last season when everyone was healthy, we were winning games and playing like an actual team (minus Semin). If we can have an entire season of that, I'd be fucking thrilled.   Also, don't forget the 5th pick in the draft. The draft is really deep this year, and we can get a great player. Obviously not on the same level as McEichel, but he'd still be a significant contributor (hopefully; you never really know with prospects).  Our future is completely up in the air. We could be at the bottom of the league for the next five years, or we could make the playoffs next year. It all depends on the mindset of the players and how much effort they put into their game. Cam played fantastic last year, and if he keeps that up with a healthy team, I can see us being dangerous. But at the same time, I see where everyone in that thread is coming from. We've got a few prospects, a #5 draft pick, and a few top players (Staal, Staal, Skinner, Faulk). Nothing very intimidating and, as I said, could lead us to the bottom of the league very easily. It all depends on a whole lot of things."
canes,380yyj,notleonardodicaprio,2,Mon Jun 1 03:37:09 2015 UTC,"At the very least Ronny Franchise has been making changes in the right direction. Remember how at the beginning of the season we supposedly had ""the right pieces"" for a playoff team? Well that obviously didn't pan out and we dished Tlusty and Sekera for pretty solid deals. That's something JR would have never done, just look at the sweetheart deals he gave Gleason and Jokinen at the end of lackluster seasons. Also even after just one mediocre season I have faith in Bill Peters to whip the team into shape when the whole 1st line doesn't get injured in the preseason."

canes,380yyj,ccarico,2,Mon Jun 1 15:17:35 2015 UTC,It IS hard to name teams in a worse position. Many teams below us 3-5 years ago have taken at least some sort of upswing.
canes,380yyj,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"you also have to remember 2 things: who our owner is, and who our former GM was. this Franchise is being rebuilt from the top down. though the actual team, when healthy, was pretty good (remove a few bits and pieces of course). I also think between Cam Ward's play and Khudobin's not so great play, Cam made Ron Francis eat his words about Cam not being a part of the future of the franchise."
canes,380yyj,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Yes and no. We aren't a deep team. This was obvious at the beginning of the year when Nash/Rask were our top 2 centers. After the Sekera trade we had 2 top 4 Defensmen in Faulk/Hainsey. Part of that problem is that we don't do bad enough each season to draft well. We have very few top 5 picks in the last 5-10 years compared to teams around us in the standings. The other part of the problem is player development. Boychuck, Terry, Dalpe, Jordan, Murphy, Bellemore, Rissanen are all guys who probably should be contributing at the NHL level to some extent and now they are just getting their chances, for the ones still here.  The 2 years under Mueller were bad. The team was not organized and he was trying to be a players coach, and it back fired. Bad. Rutherford was also playing the ""playoffs now"" game, instead of the ""playoffs in 2-3 years for 2-3 years in a row"" game. He would buy instead of sell and it took its toll on the prospect pool(See paragraph 1).    However, We are starting to fix issues. Francis seems to have a clear vision for this team and is working towards it. He wants to build through the draft and develop players and make the playoffs consistently, not a 1 and done run like in 2009. We have some shitty contracts(See Alex Semin), but I like to think we are in the same boat as the Carolina Panthers, just 1-2 years behind them. We can slowly get these bad contracts off the books and replace them with reasonable ones. We have some guys who we need to clear cap space for so they can get paid(See Justin Faulk).    We have a coach who is here to win, has the power to bench people when necessary, and is very clear and detailed about what he wants from his players. We have guys to build a team around, JStaal is here long term, Faulk is here for a few years, Lindholm has been improving, Rask looked real good this past year for a rookie. Hopefully Marner/Hanifin/Strome(in that order, IMO) can come in and make a big impact for us. We have a lot of picks in what should be a very deep draft and the broadcasters mentioned how often Francis has been out scouting players. I think that is a great sign."
canes,380yyj,UnrelatedComa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"but I like to think we are in the same boat as the Carolina Panthers, just 1-2 years behind them.   Funny typo but also a really inaccurate assessment. The Panthers got to draft what seems to be the best defenseman since Lidstrom, they took advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity of destroying Vancouver to get Luongo back - a situation in and of itself that was a perfect storm of circumstances involving the Canucks scapegoating one of the best tenders in the league, him being previously on the team and wanting to return, and eventually what can only be looked at as a demanded trade at his request after a snub. They also took Willie Mitchell after LA let him go not realizing how much they were going to miss him and he's playing great hockey in his late 30s and is an incredible mentor influence on that prodigal D-man already mentioned. Throw in grabbing legendary Jagr to mentor the high draft picks Barkov and Bjugstad? The situation is not a parallel at all."

canes,37rc2x,SpoinkaDoink,4,Fri May 29 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion, Skinner has turned into a sniper. It's no suprise to me given his history of goal scoring that this what he's become, but the thing about snipers is that unless you pair them with a good playmaker they get smothered and don't have a chance to score. Like I've said before since we let Whitney go we haven't had a truly gifted playmaker on this team, and unless we get one we won't see the true value of skinner. I would hate to see him go but honestly the longer we go without having a good set up guy, the more we lose in keeping skinner which has me thinking it wouldn't be bad to trade him for a good partner for Faulk."
canes,37rc2x,s1apshot,3,Sat May 30 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"The bad thing is that Semin can be a good playmaker, but God knows that's not going to happen enough. I wouldn't mind trading Skinner if we can get a good return."

The cat is out of the bag with Skinner, play the body and he won't be effective. Its a shame really, but that is just the way it is. He has become really one dimensional and that is just not what Francis/Peters want. He does tend to put butts in seats though, so I see the reason for holding on to him."

This is why playing with Eric Cole his first year and then playing with Ruutu and Jokinen worked after. Ruutu was around to lay the hits while Skinner and Jokinen worked to score.  We don't have that anymore. Or at least, Peters didn't see fit to form that kind of line."

They would always say ""anyone but the Canes."" It's pretty hilarious.   I do hope the Sabres, or any Buffalo sports team, wins something someday so that they can move the fuck on from 2006.  *edit to add that I married a woman from Buffalo and Canes fans are also really fucking salty assholes at PNC.

On their podcast from last week, they brought up that the guy(Strome) playing behind the ""generational talent""(McDavid) are valued high in the draft, then don't live up to the hype in the NHL."

canes,36aodn,Hurricane_Viking,3,Mon May 18 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"That's true, but to play devil's advocate: It was only for a few weeks, and its still the OHL. There have been plenty of guys that were ranked like Strome, weren't playing behind the next superstar for the whole season, and still didn't work out in the NHL. Though the same can be said for Marner or Hanifin."
canes,36aodn,ScruffsMcGuff,1 point,Mon May 18 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"From the looks of things Arizona fans say the buzz is that they're guaranteed picking Strome.  I'd say the Leafs are 100% taking Marner if he's on the table.  The guy running the Leafs draft is Hunter, who drafted Marner into the OHL and has been his biggest supporter since he came into juniors.  I think Carolina end up with Hanifin at 5th, which is a pretty damned good player to get with a 5th overall.  The top end of this years draft is just stupid deep."
canes,36aodn,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Marner's stock has only been rising since the end of the season. At this point, I expect Arizona to take Marner. The leafs are now the wild card, picking between Hanifin and Strome. You don't get the chance to draft a franchise Dman at 4 very often(if ever), so I'm expecting them to take Hanifin. I think we end up with Strome, when everything is said and done. Im just hoping that he can come straight to the NHL."

canes,36bady,alexfig88,7,Sun May 17 23:54:22 2015 UTC,"Staal has an NMC so he controls the situation. Ron Francis did mention in his end of season press conference that Eric seems genuinely invested in bringing the Canes back to the playoffs.   But at the end of the day, he has an 8.25m cap hit. I don't see the Canes wanting to pay that come 2016-2017. So I'd say it pretty much comes down to how the contract extension talks play out. If they can get an extension at a lower number, great. If not, I imagine Ronnie would rather trade him now when his trade value is highest.  If I were a betting man, I'd wager that Staal extends sometime this summer somewhere in the 6-7m range."
canes,36bady,apexbbq,3,Mon May 18 02:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think he resigns too (at a discounted price). I don't think Rutherford would have ever traded him, but if the numbers don't line up and the right deal comes around, I believe Ronnie would entertain the idea"
canes,36bady,NullCipher,3,Mon May 18 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"There was a Semin + #5 for Kessel + Kadri + 2nd rounder, but that was made up non-sense. As for trading Staal, it may happen. I don't see anything happening until the draft. If it doesn't happen at the draft then maybe at the trade deadline. If I had to bet, we won't trade him and resign him at the end of next season."
canes,36bady,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon May 18 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"That seems like a lot to give up from Toronto's end to take on such a bad contract and a number 5 pick, considering Schneider netted a #9 in a weaker draft. Interesting though"

canes,36bady,mattfki5g,-5,Mon May 18 13:05:30 2015 UTC,It does if they're the focal point of your team still. The whole point of a rebuild is to change the core.

canes,36bady,XdshortX,2,Mon May 18 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he wouldn't be part of the core. I'm saying that he isn't THE core. You can have a full rebuild and keep a couple of your solid veteran guys (Who are about to be under new contracts that we have no idea what the cost will be) while still making your core younger overall. It's actually the perfect time to try and keep Eric around if he will help us out in the contract negotiations.   If you can't see the change in culture this team went through in just one season under Francis and Peters then yea, I would agree we should probably let Eric walk. But this team played entirely differently last season vs. the 5 before regardless of the standings. This is one of our most important seasons in a long time as far as roster changes, and even in saying that I think it would be extremely hard to go full rebuild with the terrible contracts JR left us with. So what do we do? Sell players for pennies because no one wants their contracts, or make some cap space with a cheaper short term contract from a reliable 50+ point producer?  I agree if we take on Eric for another long term, overpriced contract it's a bad look for the franchise. But even if we trade him for some good pieces I don't think we have the negotiating power to get other bad contracts off the books to go full rebuild without getting demolished in the trades. It's not a simple, 'get rid of Eric and his contract and this whole mess goes away' scenario."

canes,35fhdq,XdshortX,11,Sun May 10 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"We have 2 first rounders next year. Phil Kessel is a superstar and he would play amazing. Kadri? I mean sign me up he is a young player. I don't see anything wrong trading for 2 first liners and giving up a ""3rd liner"" (Semin) and our draft pick. I mean these two players would put peoples butts in the seats in Raleigh."
canes,35fhdq,Big_Titles,-1,Sun May 10 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"There's not top end talent in next year's draft. You have Matthews as a clear standout, but he is on the same level as the picks that will go between 7-15_this year. No more huge contracts need to be brought in, and we most certainly don't need to have years without a first round pick.   Nobody the Leafs are willing to move appeals to me mostly because, if they were as good as what you'd pay for them, they wouldn't be moving in the first place. Also, taking on Kadri is fucking stupid. The guy with the drug problem, who doesn't show up to scheduled team events. Nope."
canes,35fhdq,XdshortX,-4,Sun May 10 05:45:24 2015 UTC,"And Kadri is not a first liner. The only success he has had came from Kessel and JVR putting up points and drawing the better defensive pairing. Then, he still played behind Grabo, and had a guy like Lupul on his line. He's a product of sheltered minutes and a team's depth."
canes,35fhdq,XdshortX,2,Sun May 10 05:48:09 2015 UTC,Well next year isn't that deep sure. Kadri is a good player alone. And it doesn't matter how good you are in Toronto if you dont win. Kessel is gone because they don't know what they want.
canes,35fhdq,Big_Titles,1 point,Sun May 10 11:06:52 2015 UTC,"Kadri barely played with Kessel or JVR lol. Statically speaking he was our best forward and defiantly is 1st line quality but every metric. He played with a rotating cast of wingers, mainly Clarkson (lol) and sometimes Lupul when he wasn't injured. And was usually matched up against the toughest competition.   Personally I wouldn't like this trade at all. And don't see t happening."
canes,35fhdq,davesuperstar,4,Fri May 15 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"So you wouldn't trade a streaky, wildly overpaid possession winger and a #5 draft pick for a decent 2C, an elite scoring winger, and a 3rd rounder. People over value draft picks like crazy. This trade would be so much in our favor it's not even fucking funny."
canes,35fhdq,pacefalmd,2,Sun May 10 21:28:30 2015 UTC,Ya. No way the leafs would make this trade lol
canes,35fhdq,davesuperstar,-3,Fri May 15 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"No. Talent isn't everything, and neither player has shown themselves committed to the game or the teams they've been a part of."
canes,35fhdq,XdshortX,2,Sun May 10 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"They don't seem any less committed than Semin, and they actually put up points on a team that's just as bad as ours. I don't see this trade happening, but Kessel would probably love to get out of the media shitstorm that is Toronto and just be able to play the game with the lower pressure here. Sure that's just speculation but you hear it all the time about Toronto.   It's hard to say what I'd prefer. You'd be giving up a possible young stud in a number 5 pick, but you'd be getting instant point production (ideally) from two different sources and dumping a bad contract. Phil's contract isn't much better but at least he's producing right now. Semin could turn it around but that's a big chance to take if this offer is really on the table. I'm glad I wouldn't have to make that decision."
canes,35fhdq,mattfki5g,-1,Mon May 11 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think Semin is committed, he's just a head case. That said, I want him bought out, because we are in contract hell. I prefer making your picks and building your foundation through the draft. Add complementary pieces through trades.   Plus, it will show us how confident Francis is in our scouts, and himself, if he steps up and makes a pick. We'll also get a glimpse of what he values more, size or skill (if Marner is the one who falls to 5)."
canes,35fhdq,XdshortX,2,Mon May 11 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"The contract situation will hopefully get better after next year with the Staal and Ward deals expiring, assuming Francis doesn't give them bad contracts again if they stay. I lean more towards the picks and prospects as well but this deal would be too sweet to just not consider. Regardless of what happens I don't see Karmanos approving a buyout of that magnitude ever. We are stuck with Semin unless it's through a trade, I would think.   I really don't think we will get a good idea of what our future will look like until the trade deadline and next off season. That's when some really big pieces are up and we will definitely see what Francis wants to do with this team."
canes,35fhdq,mattfki5g,2,Mon May 11 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly this organization and our fans have been talking about the future for too long now. I think it's about time we worried about the present. The likelyhood of this deal going down is slim to none I'm sure, but it's time to fix the present. Having this ""build for the future"" mentality is what's keep us out of the playoffs for going on a decade. Let's face it the facts, this team is a joke. It's time for a proven talent now. The time of banking on could be's and maybes is through."
canes,35fhdq,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Sun May 10 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"The reason we've sucked dick for so long, is because we keep saying we're a piece or two away every year.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

canes,34wyia,Volan1,6,Tue May 5 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think we need to do anything other than let him develop the way he has been. If we match him up with a veteran on D, he's going to learn a lot and become an excellent player. His hockey IQ matches his potential to become a major star in the next 3-5 years."
canes,34wyia,hawkesdt,3,Tue May 5 06:34:59 2015 UTC,I think the biggest thing at this point is to find a solid #1/2 Dman to play with Faulk.  He is developing well but I'd like to put a veteran Dman with him to give him that extra bit of confidence.
canes,34wyia,rx7raven,2,Tue May 5 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"Faulk had the best season for a D-man in recent Canes history. He has the potential to be one of the top 3 D-men ever to play here. He's still young(23) and has shown a good skill set to grow off of. He plays in all situations, and if we could get another 1/2 D-man to pair him with then it would huge for him. In the future if Faulk doesn't have to carry our Defense on his back then I'm really excited to see what he could do."

canes,34wyia,thebl4ckd0g,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"Justin Faulk had a good season. I am one of the biggest critiques when it comes to him. He showed me can put up points like a top pairing D man should be able to do. Does he play as good defensively as other top pairing D men? No. I know we don't have a stacked team by any means. I remember someone who didn't body check (like Faulk) or didn't play so good sometimes defensively (like Faulk) and made some mistakes. He could put up points like Faulk but, was heavily shit on by Hurricanes fans. His name was Joni Pitkanen. Why does Faulk get the love while Pitkanen was hated? Anyways I went off track here with my rant but, Faulk is a good player on a not so great team. He will be great in the future once we get him a good defensive partner (please Marc Staal)."
canes,34wyia,Big_Titles,2,Tue May 5 18:56:46 2015 UTC,I would take Marc Staal if he is willing to take a big pay cut to play here. If he wants 5-6M/yr then its just going to be to expensive.

canes,34wyia,s1apshot,1 point,Wed May 6 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"Very true. I think we get ~1M off the books this upcoming season from dropping retained salaries, Ward/Staal should be signed at a lower price if they come back after next year.

canes,34wyia,ispoiler,1 point,Wed May 6 13:11:46 2015 UTC,So lazy that he broke his heel racing back to make sure a call was icing in a regular season game. Your bar is quite high sir.
canes,34wyia,daxem2k,1 point,Mon May 18 22:00:32 2015 UTC,99% of the time he was a lazy shit. The ironic thing is... dude got hurt that 1% of play where he had shown some hustle.
canes,34wyia,ispoiler,3,Mon May 18 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Faulk is much more responsible defensively, and he doesn't take the stupid penalties Joni took. Faulk also competes much harder.   I'd actually give Joni the edge in offensive IQ. Justin just shoots, which Joni never did."
canes,34wyia,XdshortX,1 point,Wed May 6 01:16:45 2015 UTC,I would say that Joni had better vision too go along with offensive IQ. He made some great seam passes to Jussi when he was here. I don't see those types of passes from Faulk.
canes,34wyia,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed May 6 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that as well. To me, Joni is more comparable to Murphy, if (and a huge if) Murphy can develop a little more defensively."
canes,34wyia,XdshortX,2,Wed May 6 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people underestimate how good Joni was, in general. He was playing a ton of minutes every night.

I know he tore it up this year, but the NHL is a whole different game. You're not getting hit by 17/18 year olds, you're getting hit by guys like Chara and Byfuglien.   This is made worse by how physically big the Ducks/Kings are in our division."
canes,34aeed,XdshortX,3,Wed Apr 29 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"I would be fine with Hani but honestly I want Marner, But we're almost positive the team is going to completely fuck up and draft Crouse."
canes,34aeed,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Looking at him, Crouse certainly seems like he has potential. You would be trading Marner's speed/skill for Crouse's significantly larger size. Stats I read had him at 6'4"" 212lbs. Considering he is 17 I bet he will be 220-230lbs when he is 21/22. He is going to be a big guy, probably similar to our Martin Hanzel, although hopefully without all the injuries."
canes,34aeed,Hurricane_Viking,2,Wed Apr 29 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"Crouse isn't a bad pick, but you just can not take him with the skill that would be available in the player left from Hanifin, Strome, and Marner."
canes,34aeed,BORT_licenceplate27,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think that we will end up with Marner. Strome would be my 1st pick out of the 3. Hanifin would just make our young D/D-prospects that much better(Faulk, Fluery, Murphy, Jordan)."
canes,34aeed,s1apshot,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"Many Yotes fans feel the same way. We want a large center, but if we draft Hanifin at least our D core will get better. We already have a world class offensive Dman in Oliver Ekman-Larsson and are very deficient in forwards though so Strome would be ideal."
canes,34aeed,davesuperstar,2,Wed Apr 29 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, Faulk is similar for us. He may be a year or 2 behind OEL but is on track to be at that level. Some of our young D have showed promise this year but we will see what their ceiling is. I think Strome could learn a lot from the Staals on how to play the right style for his size. I just watched a Marner highlight reel and he looks like Skinner 2.0."

canes,34418e,Johnny_Mo88,6,Tue Apr 28 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"I think he was great and we definitely need to re-sign him, especially because I think he'll be pretty cheap.  I think he played well for us.  From what I saw he always put in effort, never making lazy plays.  He also does things that our other guys don't always do like getting gritty along the boards and staying in front of the net.  Even though he played all forward positions during the season, I think he'll mainly stay as a right wing since I feel like we are somewhat lacking in that area.  On the plus side, if there are injuries in the lineup, I think he did a decent job at the other positions that he can play whichever as needed.  I think he'll stay a depth player for us, but I don't mean that in a bad way."
canes,34418e,Anviski,2,Tue Apr 28 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"I loved his play this season. He is great along the boards. He plays bigger than he is, which is nice to see from someone on our team. He gets to the dirty areas which will be key for the team going forward. I don't remember him making really bad plays. He can make some nice passes, and doesn't have a bad shot either.    He will be a big part of the bottom 6 for us. I think him along with Gerbe would make a good pair of wings for the 3rd line. I think he might be able to help on the PK some too. I don't think he saw much PK time this year, but maybe he can develop that.  Nesty/Gerbe/Dwyer/Malone are not a bad group of bottom 6 wingers for us going forward.    As far as his ceiling, I think he will be a 2nd line guy on his best days. Its not crazy high but he has the work ethic and other skills that will make him a good depth player for us. He's definitely valuable to the team and I want him back next year."
canes,34418e,Hurricane_Viking,2,Tue Apr 28 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"He was good. He does things in the dirty areas this team needs; however, if we sign him thinking he's going to be effective in the top 6, it's going to be a bust. I wouldn't sign him for more than a million a year though."
canes,34418e,XdshortX,2,Tue Apr 28 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"He was a pleasant surprise, glad we got him, probably our best waiver pick up in recent times (besides Boychuk ofc). Ceiling? I don't think it's that high, but at the same time he provides us much needed depth. While his ceiling might not be top line, he needs to be re-signed."
canes,33z6yx,SpoinkaDoink,9,Mon Apr 27 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"Victor Rask is probably going to be a 3C for his career. But don't hold it against him. He's going to be very effective in that role for a long time.  As for the rest of the team, you can never have too much prospect depth. Thankfully, this year we have lots of decent draft picks with which to grab a couple of good NHLers. Drafting at #5, we could get our hands on one of Mitch Marner, Dylan Strome or Noah Hannifin, any of whom (but especially Hannifin would be greatly appreciated on our team.   As for our current players, it's reliant on a lack of injuries. Skinner needs to stop getting concussed, and the Staals need to stay healthy for the year before we're competitive. As for Semin, well... He has to want to play. Lindholm on the other hand, looks bonafide. He will likely end up as our 2C if we decide to keep the Staals together on a line.  Here's the thing though. Even though our future looks bright, it has to be brighter than most of the Metropolitan division before it really makes much of a difference. Unfortunately, the Rangers, Caps, Islanders, Penguins and Blue Jackets all have far better teams than we do right now. Sad to say, but I think we're maybe 3 or 4 years away from being in playoff contention."
canes,33z6yx,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with basically everything you said. I think Rask will see most of his time at 3C, which is fine. I think he could play 2C and be productive if we have an injury. If we get Marner or Strome at the draft(I think it will be Marner, although I like Strome's size) and they make the NHL team as a rookie, we will have Nash, Rask, Strome/Marner to fill in the 2C/3C roles. It will some competition for the ice time and we now know Peters will give it to who deserves it.      I think Lindholm should spend some time on the Staals wing. If Semin can't bounce back and play there Lindholm would be my next choice, I like Lindholm at wing though.    As far as being a playoff team, I think we could only be 2 years away. If you look at how we played with JStaal back and before we traded Sekera, we were a much better team. We lost a lot of 1(or 1+empty net) goal games in December(and the rest of the season). A little more offensive production and the young D-men taking a step up and we could be a bubble team next year."
canes,33z6yx,Hurricane_Viking,3,Tue Apr 28 15:16:30 2015 UTC,"He seems to be a late bloomer, so who knows where his ceiling is. I think he was drafted way too high, and that set his expectations unfairly high. I see his production staying about where he was at this year."
canes,33z6yx,XdshortX,6,Tue Apr 28 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"I really like Rask, I could see him as our 2C next year. Staal Staal and another winger Gerbe/Semin, then Skinner Rask Lindholm as our second line, and have Nash center the 3rd.   I expect the 'Canes to take Marner with the 5th pick, and from what I hear, despite his size (similar to Patrick Kane at 18) he's not far from NHL ready. So we could also throw him on the 3C if he's ready for the NHL.   Going forward? I'd trade Skinner now. I like him, and he's probably our best goal scorer right now, but he's too vulnerable. He has missed time during each of the last 3 seasons due to concussions. I think he could easily fetch a 1st + good prospect. I just think there's a solid chance he's not playing at 30, so it's safer to cash in on him. I'm not bashing him, he has great talent, and he has matured, but too risky."
canes,33z6yx,Volan1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:21:05 2015 UTC,I don't see Rask as anything more than a great 3c. His max potential might be 2c. He's smart and willing to put work in on both ends. I love Rask but he's not a 1c.

canes,33inge,Anviski,3,Wed Apr 22 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"I would personally really like to see Nesty and Terry re-signed, I thought they did well.  I'm glad Nesty goes to the net.  I'm not sure what I think the Canes should do about the defense.  They have 4 contracts extending into next year: Faulk, Hainsey, Liles, and Murphy.  I thought Hainsey did a pretty good job for us, but I don't think he is top pairing material.  Do you guys think the Canes should work on and re-sign some of the younger guys like Jordan or look for a top pairing free agent?"
canes,33inge,xiolyph,3,Wed Apr 22 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"We don't have the cap maneuverability (or the ability to spend to the cap for that matter) to sign a big name free agent. I would expect a similar off season to that of last year - small deals for relatively unknown players and resigning our own expiring contracts.  Top pairing guys rarely hit the market to begin with. I'd expect if we get a top pairing guy to go with Faulk in the next couple of years it's going to be through the draft. Hanifin (if he drops to us) or hitting a home run like we did with Faulk in the 2nd round.   Lack of cap abilities to give these guys what they want + not a top choice market = develop through the draft team. Of course, nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to the draft, so that has its own problems. If I'm Francis, improving our scouting/drafting is still one of my top priorities tho. More 2010 draft (Skinner, Faulk) and less 2008 draft (Boychuk, Dalpe).  Nestrasil needs to be resigned and I suppose Terry. Idk who our other RFAs/UFAs are.  I think that at best this roster is a bubble team next year. I can't think of any realistic ways to improve it, though, with Karmanos existing and being tied back by various contracts. I'd like to see Eric and Cam resigned for hopefully hometown discounts next year and that's as far as I go lol"
canes,33inge,triplesek,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it would be a long shot getting the caliber defenseman needed for the first pairing in free agency.  We really lucked out with Sekera.  Any free agents you think the Canes should look out for in the offseason?  And I agree, while I'd love to see us make the playoffs next year, with the current contracts not much can be changed in the team makeup.  I too see us being a bubble team."
canes,33inge,Hurricane_Viking,2,Thu Apr 23 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"Francis knows he's got a lot of toxic contracts and I'm willing to bet hes going to trade them off while retaining a percentage.  So if we could trade Semin and retain half his contract (for example), that would free up some money to pursue elsewhere."
canes,33inge,invisibleninja7,2,Thu Apr 23 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"EStaal Ward and Semin are really the only bad contracts we have. Skinner may be in that group soon if he doesn't turn it around. Semin isn't getting traded no matter how much we want it to happen. There is no reason for us to retain half of his salary just to get a late round pick. EStaal I could see getting moved at the deadline as a rental with us retaining some salary, but not during the offseason. Ward played well last year so his trade value went up, I still think that we will wait out his contract(move him at the deadline) and then sign him to something more team friendly next year."
canes,33inge,teke1800,2,Thu Apr 23 16:31:31 2015 UTC,I don't see us ever moving E Staal. He's the face of the team and even casual barely fairweather-fans know this. With how long he's lived here I think the best case scenario is he takes a sweetheart hometown deal after his current contract runs up.

canes,33inge,Hurricane_Viking,2,Thu Apr 23 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"Here is a quick list of RFA/UFAs for people wondering: RFAs: Riley Nash, Andrej Nestrasil, Michal Jordan, Rasmus Rissanen AHL RFAs: Boychuk, Sutter, Shugg, Levi, Schmitz, Staal    UFAs: Patrick Dwyer, Chris Terry, Brett Bellemore, Jack Hillen AHL UFAs: MacIntyre, Holmstrom, Nesmisz    Taken from nhlnumbers.com"
canes,33inge,invisibleninja7,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think we give decent offers to all the RFAs. I think Nash played well until his concussion. Nestrasil is good along the boards and can fill in anywhere in the bottom 6. Jordan/Rissanen can be part of our youth movement on the blue line. They both seemed to hold their own. I would like to see Terry get another year in the NHL, he had his moments but more consistency would be nice.  Dwyer is great for the 4th line/PK and has a lot of speed. I would like to see him stay around, but wouldn't be devastated if he left.     One of the guys at Section_328 had the idea of sending an offer sheet to Dougie Hamilton(RFA) of Boston for ~$5mil/year(i think). Boston is gonna have cap issues so I like the idea of trying to get Hamilton from them, I just don't know if we can afford it. If we got him for that price we would have to send a 1st and 3rd back since he's a RFA. With LA's 1st next year we could make it happen.    For the draft, obviously McDavid/Eichel are going 1/2. I think Hanifin will still go 3. I think we will get Strome/Marner depending on who the leafs take. I would like to see us get Strome, just because he has a bit more size at 6'3''. He could learn a lot from the Staals on how to use that size in the NHL."
canes,33inge,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"I've got to agree with all the re-signings except for Rissanen, he didn't seem to have enough upside to me.

canes,33inge,SpoinkaDoink,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:58:04 2015 UTC,"Jordan has over 200 AHL games played as well. I think Rissanen would be a Bellemore replacement, and maybe a 2nd pair Dman in case of injuries. I think he has more upside than Bellemore which is why I want to see him stay around."

canes,33inge,Volan1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:52:02 2015 UTC,If we keep Rissanen up then he can take the spot of Bellemore. They play similar styles and I think Rissanen can skate better.

Let them bitch. Reminds me of the Buffalo trolls who bitched and moaned for years about how they were down four defensemen during the ECF and that they ""really"" won. You know what? After how their fans acted during that series, I have less than zero sympathy for them. And no matter what, the Cup will always say CAROLINA HURRICANES 2005-06 on it. No one can take that from us."

I feel like most of the people who scream BRING BACK THE WHALE in 'Canes-related threads are random trolls (not necessarily from Hartford) who just hate the fact that there are NHL teams in the South.  No disrespect to the Whalers or their fans but there are some pretty compelling reasons as to why that team left CT. Karmanos being a subpar owner is only part of the story.

I can't answer this, because the salary cap will go up and I have no idea what a good deal will be then. Anyways, we draft at 5th overall, we could get someone who puts up Kessel numbers for considerably less money.   Could anyone imagine Semin in Toronto though?

I don't know if I would give this up or not, strictly hypothetical. We would have to trade some first rounders, this years and our and LAs next year.

When your top goal scorer has 23 goals and your ""top gun"" scores less goals than several rookies on the team, you aren't going to the playoffs.

canes,32i22n,pacefalmd,19,Mon Apr 13 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it a change of scenery that Alex Semin needed when he came to Carolina?  Also, I can't think of many NHL teams where he would have received less criticism from the media and fans for his performance this season.  He is an extremely talented hockey player and he gets paid like one.  Only he doesn't produce like one anymore.  The Hurricanes don't owe it to Semin to send him to a new team.  Alex Semin is an adult and a professional.  If his confidence is shaken, he needs to find a way to get it back.  The Hurricanes shouldn't have to move heaven and earth, or write a big check, just because Semin isn't feeling too good about himself these days."
canes,32i22n,KidVicious13,5,Tue Apr 14 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he's saying the Canes are the problem, but I'm not sure I agree. When we first got Semin, he played great. I don't know if this a slump or if he really doesn't care since he's getting paid like $7 million. He's a hell of a player when he wants to be, and if he steps his game back up, I can see us making the playoffs next season."
canes,32i22n,notleonardodicaprio,2,Tue Apr 14 00:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think it just sounds like he is saying the team is the problem because he english isn't very good. Also the reason why he barely does any interviews during the season. When he said that defense was a problem I think he meant as a team, not just the defensmen. And I'm sure he wasn't calling out Eric/Jordan/Skinner. He just mentioned that the 4 of them need to score more next season."
canes,32i22n,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah and I agree. I like Peters and the new management, but we've only been with them for one season. We have most of the pieces for a good team, we just need to figure out how to put it all together."
canes,32i22n,notleonardodicaprio,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't get the vibe that he was blaming the Canes for his play.  I think he pointed out that others also had bad years, too.  While his year was far worse and hopefully he understands that, but Eric/Skinner both need to show up more on the score sheet too."
canes,32i22n,venduss,3,Tue Apr 14 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"I should've clarified, I thought the author was blaming the Canes, not Semin."
canes,32i22n,notleonardodicaprio,3,Tue Apr 14 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"From listening to the interview its obvious the guy has 0 confidence. I think part of that comes from October where he was the most skilled guy on the ice for most of the month, and the team didn't do anything. It was his time to shine with the Staals and Skinner being out and it just didn't happen. Depending on how his wrist healed last offseason it could have been part of the slow start.  He seems to like the coaches and players around him. It has to be hard for a veteran player like Semin to see himself get benched as soon as we have enough healthy forwards to play. Hopefully he is coming back sooner this summer to get some extra time in with the Staals and maybe some other guys on the team to build more chemistry inside Peters system. Hopefully he can bounce back next year."
canes,32i22n,Hurricane_Viking,2,Tue Apr 14 03:10:15 2015 UTC,Cam Ward went through this last season.  As far as I can tell there are three outcomes:  1) Semin continues to play below his salary and we are stuck with him  2) Semin is able to get his game together and we once again have a much needed goal scorer  3) Semin is able to get his game together and we trade him for not much of anything due to his history of inconsistency  I am hoping for option 2 because its the only one of the three that helps the Hurricanes organization.    I like that he seems to be taking responsibility for his poor play and that he genuinely seems depressed that he had 6 goals.  Its much better than him being content with his stats.
canes,32i22n,venduss,2,Tue Apr 14 02:57:30 2015 UTC,He sounds totally defeated
canes,32i22n,Volan1,2,Tue Apr 14 07:25:45 2015 UTC,"His interview sounded bad, but at the same time he also doesn't speak very good English so it's kind of hard to hold that against him. He also sounded like his wrist problem took him a while to recover and you could see it out there. When would the old Semin shy away from a shot as many times as he did this year? It was also apparent when he did shoot; it didn't seem to have the same power that it used to. Maybe it's because I've always liked him as a player but something was just off. Not to mention that our leading point scorer had 54 points or somewhere around there. It's not like we were piling up goals and only Semin wasn't scoring. Even Skinner only had 31 points this year and nobody is calling for him to be traded. I guess we won't know until next year but I thought he looked like a different player in the last quarter of the season."

canes,3280tn,zellthemedic,3,Sat Apr 11 11:51:43 2015 UTC,"If you don't already have tickets, I recommend section 328.   Parking is $15, cash only. Which leads to my next thought-  Across the street from the PNC arena is a bar called Backyard Bistro. The food is great. If you eat there, you can stay parked for free. Otherwise you can event park there for $10.   Beer is $10/20oz or 6.50/12oz. There's lots of local options.   Feel free to wear your Preds jersey. We're friendly folks."

canes,3280tn,reuruddy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"Don't be jealous of us, we have to play Chicago.   But hey. You guys weren't bad yesterday. The first period suuuuucked but the second and third were much better. Lots of good chances and Ward seemed to improve a bit. It's just unfortunate that they pulled him with so much time left in the 3rd.   Also, fuck the Red Wings."
canes,326wd7,BarkMingo,2,Sat Apr 11 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"I saw the first fight, seemed like a normal battle-that-boiled-over hockey fight, who the hell cares if it was some overrrated wash-up vs. a rookie, it was a hockey play....didn't see the 2nd fight other than the clip here, but it looks like Vinny just tries to jump him for revenge...I'm sorry but who is actually doing the disrespecting here? Retire already Vinny, you peaked 11 years ago, and now you're just a salty wash-up who got his ass concussed by a kid.  /rant"

canes,324768,s1apshot,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:57:21 2015 UTC,Who do you have in mind at ~16th overall?
canes,324768,coldfrontin,2,Wed Apr 15 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"I would have also loved to have the pick this year. I mean what if we get extremely lucky and LA has a really down year next year and we possibly could get a top 10 pick. I mean I doubt that'll happen but, that's what I'll tell myself anyways."
canes,324768,Big_Titles,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"I guess it does have the potential to give us a higher pick next year, but as you said it's unlikely they will regress that much.  From everything I've heard though this is one of the deepest drafts in a while so it sucks we aren't picking up the extra first this year."
canes,324768,s1apshot,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:15:55 2015 UTC,On the bright side it will spread our draft picks a bit so wee don't have a huge cluster of prospects coming in/ going out at the same time

I'm glad the pick is next year. If we are making a run for the playoffs next season we have a good bargining chip for trade deadline"
canes,324768,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"This draft is supposed to be the deepest draft since 03. That entire 1st round was pretty ridiculous.  Which, if true, we may have missed out on getting 2 future all-stars.    The only way this works out well for us now is if LA misses the playoffs next year. The changes to the draft lottery mean that if both us and them miss the playoffs we will have 2 chances at getting in the top 3 picks."

canes,324768,XdshortX,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"Pick needs to be traded. They're going to rest and retool. If we're keeping, essentially, a second round pick for next year, that sends a terrible message."
canes,324768,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:40:28 2015 UTC,"Now the only thing to do is to root for them to miss the playoffs again next year, so we will have 2 chances in the lottery for the top 3 picks. I know there isn't McEichel talent next year, but theoretically we could end up 1 and 2 next year(if we also don't make the playoffs). TINFOIL HAT MODE ENGAGED"
canes,324768,coldfrontin,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:04:07 2015 UTC,we will have 2 chances in the lottery for the top 3 picks.   This is huge. I forgot about that change for next year. Watch us make the playoffs and lose in 4 to miss out on both of those chances.
canes,324768,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"right, since LA missed this year I would put the odds at them making it next year at 50/50 though. I think the odds we make it are closer to 25/75."
canes,322nrz,pacefalmd,7,Fri Apr 10 02:13:48 2015 UTC,So your telling me there's a chance?
canes,322nrz,ohnofreethought,4,Fri Apr 10 06:57:19 2015 UTC,"Besides us winning the lottery, the best case scenario in my mind is Arizona winning the lottery. If Toronto or Buffalo wins then we play McDavid more often, and I don't want to see Edmonton win the lottery because they've just had too many chances with #1 overall recently."
canes,322nrz,Volan1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:21:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm definitely pulling for Arizona. Buffalo and Edmonton put in no effort at all and i just don't like Toronto.
canes,322nrz,Dinker31,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"So if we get 5th overall, who should we take. I assume the draft goes: 1) McJesus 2)Eichel-uficus 3)Hanfin-alin 4)Strome-alome 5)?????? Edit: Fuck you formatting"
canes,322nrz,Digital_Geist,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:27:49 2015 UTC,We're probably choosing between Marner and Strome.
canes,322nrz,Jonathan-Crane,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately we will also not get LA's first round pick, this year anyway."
canes,322nrz,Anviski,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'm happy about this. At best we could get the #14 pick, but LA excels at playoff hockey."
canes,322nrz,Volan1,3,Fri Apr 10 09:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's still a another pick in a first round of a pretty deep draft.  I would have rather had it this year than next."
canes,320hvh,bboydfresh,2,Thu Apr 9 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Hard to speculate with only 1 year of RF draft history as GM. I'd say Strome would be likely, RF has mentioned trying to get bigger, but not at the expense of skill. Could be wrong though. Our prospect pool is shallow, and any of Strome/Marner/Hanifin would be a huge benefit."
canes,320hvh,vlad843223,2,Thu Apr 9 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"GMRF has said he wants us to get bigger, and personally I'm a big fan of taking BPA regardless of position. Lindholm and EStaal have already been playing the wing for most of this year. IF we don't get McDavid, then pick Strome then I think we could have JStaal, Strome, Nash, Rask and McClement as our centers."
canes,320hvh,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:08:34 2015 UTC,If those 3 are gone I'd take Strome
canes,320hvh,s1apshot,-3,Thu Apr 9 19:13:27 2015 UTC,I don't think Marner is going to get picked until late in the first. His skill level is impressive but I have serious doubts about his ability to ever be big enough.
canes,320hvh,canesfan81,9,Thu Apr 9 18:10:22 2015 UTC,You're wrong
canes,320hvh,Trailkeep,-5,Fri Apr 10 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"So you think at 160lbs he's going to be big enough? Doesn't really matter where he gets picked I don't want him, We already have enough Jeff Skinners on our team."
canes,320hvh,canesfan81,3,Fri Apr 10 00:12:39 2015 UTC,You've literally never watched him play have you? You do know drafting someone at 160lbs isn't uncommon? He's 17.
canes,320hvh,lmHuge,0,Fri Apr 10 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"Johnny Gadreau is pretty awesome and all he went 4th round...Only person that small taken in the 1st round last year is Pastrnak. Don't be so caught up in some OHL stats, LaRose put up 66 goals one year in the OHL."
canes,320hvh,canesfan81,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"Clearly you are unaware of what Marner is capable of. For your information, I don't just look at stat lines.  Also, Gadreau is 5'9"", Pastrnak is 5'10"". 5'11"" is not that small in the NHL anymore, Crosby and Giroux for example are 5'11""."
canes,320hvh,lmHuge,-1,Fri Apr 10 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"Pastrnak is listed at 6' and a late 1st. Gadreau is a late 4th round pick. Crosby was a 195 or so when he was drafted if I recall. Giroux was a late 1st round pick. I think Marner could be great, I just think he's too small for us, and has a good chance of being a bust because he's so small. Oh yea and he's been playing on a line with the 12th pick in the 2013 draft all season which has padded his stats significantly. Let the Yotes take him they already have his other two linemates."
canes,320hvh,canesfan81,2,Fri Apr 10 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"Marner essentially carries his line, he's not along for the ride by any means.  He's also been playing as a center away from the Domi/Dvorak line in the playoffs and has 16P (9G 7A) in 7GP so far. I watch the Knights play, I'm ensuring you right now he will not be a late pick. I'm so sure that I'm willing to wager it."
canes,320hvh,lmHuge,0,Fri Apr 10 03:04:25 2015 UTC,You think the Yotes will pick him up #2? He plays with two of their guys already? Do you think he's that good?
canes,320hvh,canesfan81,2,Fri Apr 10 06:31:14 2015 UTC,"No, not #2 good. Top 5 good. The early first round can be broken down into tiers.   Tier 1 (Pick 1-2): McDavid & Eichle. Generational talents that are leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the draft class.  Tier 1.5 (Pick 3): Hanifin. Dubbed the next Doughty by many. Has very little holes in his game, has the ability to be a franchise D. Slightly ahead of Strome and Marner in my books, could still drop in around the top 5 but I can't see Edmonton passing him if he's on the board and they pick at 3.  Tier 2 (Pick 4-5): Strome & Marner. Either would be first overalls in the last few drafts.   Tier 3 (Pick 6-15): Provorov, Barzal, Rantenen, Werenski, Zacha, etc. These guys are still very good, proving how deep the draft is. Any could be a top 5 maybe even top 3 in recent past drafts."

canes,31nsnw,rx7raven,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:11:27 2015 UTC,The big impact was the flexibility it allowed with the lines and the ability to not force really young players into shutting down other top lines

canes,31nsnw,RedwoodTaters,2,Tue Apr 7 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"McDavid will fix our offense and carry us to the playoffs. removes tinfoil hat    I think we will be a bubble team. If JStaal was healthy all season I think we would have won in October, and some of the 1 goal games in december. An extra 4 or 5 wins, which makes us look not awful. Hopefully we stay top 5 in the draft which should net 1 NHL ready player(from what I've heard). That will help the offesnse, if we can find a Dman to play with Fualk on the top pair and the young guys progress some we will be ok there. Ward and Dobby played well enough this season for the most part, so if they can keep that up and get some offensive support their stats will look better. At the same time, that is a lot of ""ifs"" to be a bubble team."

Let them use up their junior eligibility and if they can make the transition then, great. If not, AHL. Both of them would get eaten alive at their current level and rushing prospects (especially defensemen!) is not going to help our terrible prospect pool."
canes,31nsnw,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, between Murphy/Jordan/Rissanen/Biega we have enough young d-men to fill in the bottom pair or bottom 3. I would love to have Faulk/someody, Hainsey/Liles, then Murphy/Jordan/Rissanen fight it out for the 3rd pair. I don't remember what Hillen's contract situation is but he would be with Murphy/Jordan/Rissanen on the 3rd pair/healthy extra."
canes,31nsnw,s1apshot,2,Tue Apr 7 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is a healthy team would have a chance at a wildcard spot, if they stay healthy and all player close to their potential then we have a great chance to make the playoffs in even a divisional spot. The problem this year was a serious lack of top 2 line player depth(high scoring forwards) exposed by injuries and a large portion of the roster underperforming. To make the playoffs I think we would need Eric to pass 60 points and have Skinner and at least one other player at least close to 30 goals."
canes,31nsnw,maxman1313,2,Wed Apr 8 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"A healthy Jordan Staal has been a massive benefit to this team. If he stays relatively healthy and we keep improving D, I think we have a really solid shot."

canes,31nsnw,triplesek,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the damage done by JR is going to hurt for a very very long time.  Semin was a terrible signing.  No matter what team, he always ends up being a disappointment.  E Staal and Wards contracts, while close to ending, are still extremely painful.  Skinner's concussions have ruined his career.  You can see it in his play.  That's another money dump.  I don't think I've seen the Hurricanes in a more dire situation than this.  .......BUT.......  I think we can get a wild card spot :).  I like Bill Peters.  I think our coaching staff is an incredible upside.  I think they will find ways to squeeze every ounce of talent out of our players.  Considering the circumstances (injuries, new coach, semin being dead, skinner being dead, etc), I think we had a solid season."
canes,31nsnw,XdshortX,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"No. We still don't have depth, and our hands are tied financially. And, honestly, I'd prefer we didn't in hopes we finally let Eric Staal go. Getting him and Semin off our books will be the best things that can happen to us."
canes,31nsnw,mattfki5g,5,Tue Apr 7 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't take Eric at a discount? He's said he wants to stay, and if that's true I would think he'd take a discount to stay with his brother. I think he would be great to keep around and mentor the younger group that is obviously being built by Francis with all the draft picks we are accumulating.   I agree I wouldn't re-sign him at his current price but I don't think any other team would either. A short, moderately priced contract and I would take him back in a heartbeat. He still is our top point producer year in and year out (Not saying much on the Canes but still). I'd be glad to move Semin also though, but don't see it happening ever."
canes,31nsnw,XdshortX,-5,Tue Apr 7 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"No, he's a lazy player who deflects blame when it's convenient for him.   None of the guys called him out on his lack of effort in the first half of the season, but once he finally found some semblance of his game he's made comments to the effect of 'not everyone was pushing hard enough'. That's not leadership, especially if he doesn't cop to when he is underperforming.   Smartest thing to do for us would be to get out from under the ridiculous contracts (Staals, Semin, Skinner), get as much return as possible, and build with hard working guys around Faulk and what little talented youth we have."
canes,31nsnw,mattfki5g,5,Tue Apr 7 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"All I've heard from anyone inside the organization is that Eric is a good leader but this gets brought up when anyone on here has a criticism of Eric. You can't judge his leadership when you aren't in the locker room.  'Not everyone was pushing hard enough' is something I've heard many times from any player after games and I don't really see how you can assume he wasn't including himself in that as well.  Look, I get that people think Eric is a lazy player who doesn't care and is a bad leader. I hear it all the time. But lazy players don't regularly get 60 points a year on a bad team. I'm not saying he has to be the face of the team for the rest of his career, and I'm not saying we need to re-sign him to a 'ridiculous' contract. I'm just saying we are a better team with him if we can get him for cheap when he's going to be a UFA anyway.   I agree we have plenty of ridiculous contracts but that's a problem that's going to take years to address. If we can clear up cap space, keep a 60 point producer and bring in some younger talent with the new money why wouldn't you want that? We may get what, 1 or 2 more prospects if we trade him outright in his contract season vs signing him at a deal, none at all if we let him walk completely. Those prospects could be a bust anyway. If it's a short and cheap contract it's the definition of low risk-high reward."
canes,31nsnw,PantsinmyPants1211,3,Tue Apr 7 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know why anyone thinks trading away any combination of Semin, the Staals, or Skinner is remotely a good idea. Everyone and their mom thinks we need to trade, trade, trade. Let's examine this a little bit more.  The 2014-2015 Numbers E. Staal: $8,250,000 (74GP 23G 30A -13) J. Staal: $6,000,000 (43GP 5G 17A -7) Semin: $7,000,000 (54GP 6G 13A -10) Skinner: $5,750,00 (74GP 18G 13A -13)  Right off the bat you can see that not one of those players had a good season, and honestly, just about everyone of them is well behind their season average. Besides maybe Eric Staal, we're not going to get anywhere near what we would want/need in return for these guys. Semin is effectively worth less than a bag of pucks at his price point, Skinner is small and concussion prone, and the Staals (most likely) come in a package, or would be more willing to move as a package.   Say we lose them all and get ok/decently good players in return except Semin for whom we get nothing. Who is your first line? Gerbe, Rask, and Lindholm? Gerbe, Nash, Lindholm? Second line? Malone, Nesty, Terry? Maybe sprinkle in 2 solid forwards into the top 2 lines and add a good defenseman to the D lines in the trades. Who are our 3rd and 4th lines? McClement, Dwyer, and AHL talent for the rest?  If you think that team can have any more of a good chance at the regular season than the one we have now, you're crazy. If you think that is a good team to build from for the next 5-10 years, you're also a bit crazy. Almost no veteran presence on a young team, with potential, but very few proven 1-2 line players.  Good luck with that one."
canes,31nsnw,venduss,0,Tue Apr 7 20:12:07 2015 UTC,I think you're forgetting we have Chad LaRose in the AHL.  We could bring him back for a spot on the top line clearly.  Hopefully its obvious but this whole comment is sarcastic.
canes,31nsnw,PantsinmyPants1211,2,Wed Apr 8 02:53:53 2015 UTC,He's the veteran player we need!
canes,31nsnw,Hurricane_Viking,2,Wed Apr 8 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"So we don't have depth, but you want to let the guy who has lead the team in scoring in 7 of the last 10 seasons go? That will only highlight the fact that we don't have depth. Should he get another contract like he has now, not at all. But we can give him a few years at 6.5 million and be saving money. Semin however, has 0 trade value with his contract and its not worth spending the money to buy him out. We just have to eat his contract for the next few years and continue to curse JR."
canes,31d6i9,CulinaryNerd09,4,Fri Apr 3 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the tickets from Stubhub, and I assume that it's perfectly safe to do so, from what I'm reading. Is Seatgeek any better?   I have used stubhub without any issues, I am not familiar with Seatgeek though.   Also, do you need to get separate parking passes or is that something we do when we get there?   Parking is paid with cash only at the lot unless you get a parking pass ahead of time.    How much am I looking to spend to get a beer?   Regarding Beer... I think your best bet would be to get a cooler and fill it up with what you want, put it in the trunk and tailgate when you get here (you can tailgate from 3 hours prior to the game time). This way you won't waste as much money in the arena. Beers are 10+ a shot depending on what your poison is.    Also, any places you recommend for dinner?   There is very little in terms of dinner near the arena, there is one sports bar (which is alright) and a wendy's. If you want something nice and are making a day of it anyways there are a multitude of places to eat in the raleigh/durham area if you had something in mind I could point you in the right direction.    I'm really excited to go to a hockey game (my first NHL game!) and I just want to make sure everything is in order before we get there! Thanks for your help!

canes,31d6i9,TheMikeB,3,Sat Apr 4 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"Beer is $10 for a 20 oz cup or $6.50 for 12 oz.   PNC has more local and craft beer options than any other team in the NHL. Any 1st level seat gets you into the Foothills pub deck.   Big Boss, Aviator, and Carolina Brewing are all well represented.   Section 328 is the most fun place to sit."
canes,31acvm,dmb247,3,Fri Apr 3 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"Park early in the gravel lot. As long as your set doesn't completely block off the lane, you won't have any trouble. Honestly, I doubt there will be enough people to where you have much of a problem anyway. Most Canes I've been too people just park and go in, so worst case you'd have to pack it up a little early and just drink by the car or go on in."
canes,31acvm,Thatsafunny,3,Fri Apr 3 11:42:32 2015 UTC,"With attendance this season- you may not even have trouble in the main parking lot.   What I've seen work really well for larger setups is to park at the back row of a section in main parking. Then set up in the grass. That way you'll have plenty of space, be close to the action and not a jerk for taking up an extra spot.   It sounds like your rig will fit right in. Honestly, I only recommend getting there two hours before the game for tailgating. Usually there will be a small handful of larger tailgating setups two hours before hand. You can hang out, make new friends and possibly find yourself in a cornhole match."
canes,31acvm,Librewian,2,Fri Apr 3 12:54:36 2015 UTC,This tree line  is a good spot with some porta johns nearby. Given this year's attendance there should be plenty of space for a couple dozen tents/grills/tables. Your biggest problem is gonna be that you're surrounded by fans from the opposite team (unless you're not a Canes fan).
canes,31acvm,coldfrontin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:26:16 2015 UTC,That looks like a great spot actually. Will I be able to just drive on in there? I know in the past at PNC there have been attendants directing traffic into particular lots
canes,31acvm,coldfrontin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's $10 in that lot? I used drive in from Trinity rd but you might be able to get there from the Edwards Mill side. I moved across the street a couple years ago so I haven't had to worry about parking for a long time.   Honestly, 3 hours early I would expect a pretty vacant lot and free reign. My Sabres-fan friend used to show up like 4 hours early and just park there for free before the attendants showed up."
canes,31acvm,boffosan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:23:56 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this rec! I went down Trinity and turned here. I didn't follow the signs for parking as I already had the route planned out thanks to you.   http://bit.ly/1F4rf34  It was $15.

canes,31acvm,unintentional_jerk,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:51:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone is mentioning that with attendance this season you should be fine. Just remember that attendance varies wildly based on our opponent. I expect our last 2 home games to be some of the most packed games of the year. You should be ok, but it might not be as open as people are expecting, for the following reasons:  1) The weather has gotten nice lately  2) The games are Saturdays  3) The promotions staff is doing a lot, including the south plaza party  4) The games are against large market opponents that have a big fanbase in the area  .  That said, I hope you have a blast."
canes,31acvm,chkltcow,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that since the game is early on a Saturday that it might be less crowded.

Or has Semin's contract really put us in the hole that much all we can afford is minors?"
canes,312ija,Jiggaboozer,2,Wed Apr 1 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"We are building a young team. That's how all the good teams in the league have done it. Also, Semins contract is bad, but it is mainly the term that is bad. Not saying he deserved 7 mil after the shortened season, but he had a very strong year and I think he could do it again if he would start shooting like he used to instead of a throwing a prayer of a no look pass across the ice. I also think he has looked pretty good playing with Skinner and gives him at least one good chance a game."
canes,312ija,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"This is happening for a lot of teams around the league right now. As the NCAA and CHL leagues finish their seasons, older players who are not eligible next year will sign a contract with the NHL team that drafted them. If they had signed when they were drafted they lose the ability to play in juniors/NCAA. We may still never see some of these guys in the NHL, but it allows them to get some time in the AHL at the end of this season if they can play at that level.    Edit: JK they don't lose eligibility."

Being a 2013 draft pick, Hurricanes fans are still learning about Pesce, but I think most of the fanbase will know about him this time last year. He played a pretty big role on a good New Hampshire Wildcats team last year and he was only a freshman. In Rissanen's profile, I mentioned how advanced he was compared to some of the team's other defense prospects and the same can be said about Pesce. He is the same age as a lot of USHL and EJHL players and was a top-four defenseman on an NCAA club that was one game away from the Frozen Four last year. That alone is impressive enough, but what else about Pesce's game stands out?  Judging from scouting reports and the videos I've watched, Pesce's a fundamentally sound player and his strong hockey sense is what made his a solid shutdown defenseman last year. He skates well and can close gaps on opposing forwards well because of that. He's also uses his stick well to break up passes and plays the body when needed. The main things scouts have noted about him is that he always knows where to be on the ice and he plays the game like a veteran, despite him being only 18. Above all, that is what sets him apart from some other defensemen in Carolina's system and why he could turn into a very good NHL player somewhere down the line.  Pesce still has a bit of work to do before fans can get overly excited about his future. It's worth remembering that he was only a freshman in college last year and it could be at least a few more years until he's in the AHL. Not rushing him is probably for the best because as good as he was last year, it's been noted that he has a few things he can improve on. His offense being the first thing on most scouts lists. Pesce is a mobile defenseman, but he had only one goal and six points in 38 games last year. Not producing offensively isn't the end of the world if you're a shutdown defenseman, especially if you can make good passes out of your own zone, but it never hurts to add another dimension to your game. He's also pretty skinny for someone with a 6'3"" frame, although that can change as he gets older and stronger.  Since Pesce's career is still in its beginning stages, tracking his progress is a little difficult. The fact that he played a big role on an NCAA team in his freshman year says a lot about where he is now, but the next three years are going to be just as important. Will Pesce continue to evolve as a player and take on a bigger role next year? Will he be more effective offensively than he was this year or continue to be just a stay-at-home defenseman? At this point, you really can't say because he's still young and has room to grow as a player, but the future is bright for him."
canes,30ip3s,ispoiler,2,Fri Mar 27 18:41:06 2015 UTC,I like it.  He's a big kid that will cycle the puck and brings a defensively sound physical game.  If he develops he could be a solid pairing for Murphy

canes,30ijqz,xiolyph,2,Fri Mar 27 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say I had a great time at PNC on Thursday.  Y'all are cool people, and that was a great win over the Pens.  I don't understand why you guys want Sutter back over Staalsy, but whatevs.   Let's go Canes!"
canes,30ijqz,dugpa,4,Sat Mar 28 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"Only delusional people want Sutter back instead of Jordan. If he wants to come here on a cheaper deal sure, but not in exchange for Jordan. Glad to hear you had fun, though. I had a blast."
canes,30ijqz,dugpa,2,Sat Mar 28 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was baffled why Canes fans where saying they'd love sutter back.  They seemed to blame Rutherford for that being a ""bad trade"" as much as the Semin deal, which I get.  They where equally baffled by me being down on Adams' contract, so I guess it goes both ways."
canes,30ijqz,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:31:45 2015 UTC,I think you were talking to some casual fans or something. Can't see why you'd hate the Jordan trade. The only variable right now in determining if the Canes don't win is Pouliot IMO.
canes,30ijqz,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:33:35 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with the trade, just not the HUGE contract. Maybe its because the whole team sucks offensively this year but he is scoring under .5 pts/game, which just isn't good enough. I would take Sutter back, just not for Jordan. Nash though...."
canes,30ijqz,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"I thought he's played fine when paired with Eric but I don't delve too much into stats so you may be right. I suppose you have to factor in recovery from injury into that as well. Doesn't he get paid 6 mil per? It's not that bad with the way contracts seem to be trending. Not great by any means, but not awful.   Far and away a superior player to Sutter, especially when you consider Sutter is getting paid 3.3 million. At this point I'd almost rather Nash if we can keep him to a reasonable price."
canes,30ijqz,invisibleninja7,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sure that recovery time has a part of it. Also by the time he got back we were so far down in the standings that playoffs weren't gonna happen.

Maybe if he can get a partner like Methot from the Sens that will cover the back end, he could pinch more and get more involved with the offense."

Alex Semin has 1 less year on his contract than he did at the beginning of the season. Also, even since the trade deadline where we traded away Sekera(#2 defesneman) and some other people who did things, we haven't sucked as much as everyone thought. Which has caused us to leap frog Toronto in the McEichel sweepstakes.    Faulk is having a big year for us and is about to set the franchise record for pts and goals in 1 season by a defensman. The Staals have had an underwhelming year, Jordan did miss the first half of the season though. Jeff Skinner is still not playing defense, and is still streaky at scoring. Lindholm I think has played well for the most part, not a strong season but I think with the new coaching staff he will continue to grow. Victor Rask has had a great rookie year. He was playing 2C minutes to start the season due to injuries when he was penciled in at 1C in the AHL during preseason. Its a shame he didn't get to go be a rookie in the All star game. Cam Ward is back to playing like a #1 which is nice. Dobby has been a bit shaky at times, but with no offensive support his W/L record is worse than it should be. Nestrasil/Gerbe/McClement/Dwyer/Malone are all guys who work their ass off game in game out, and make the PK one of the best in the league. Also we have some defensmen hurt. Hillen was traded for at the deadline and got in a few games before a concussion. Rissanen was called up from the AHL and played well, then busted his knee. Murphy, Jordan, Bellemore, and Biega are all D-men that played in the AHL and were slated to be there all season, minus call-ups.     Coach Bill ""Hammerhands"" Peters is turning this team around. He is making players accountable and sending people to the press box based on GAS(Give a shit). Semin and Liles(11 MILLION DOLLARS IN CAP SPACE! 11 FUCKING MILLION!) have seen the press box multiple times through out the year. Ron Francis in his first year as GM has made good moves overall. Jim Rutherford (old GM has moved on to pit, where he can try to sign Joe Corvo again) stuck us with some bad contracts(Semin and Ward mostly) that has limited what Francis can do. Also Peter Karmanos, owner, is bat shit crazy.    Also check out /r/canesfanfics, you will see it pop up in GDTs in /r/hockey from time to time. Was there a thread in /r/hockey for the draft? I can't seem to find it."

JR handed out a lot of a very cushy contracts for players that didn't want to play, see Semin. We've been pretty down on our asses since 2009, but they've found their mojo after the new year of 2015. I would never set the expectation that this team would be top 10 in the league, but in the #10-15 range would be great.    What's the general opinion of Ron Francis and the coaches?   So far, we love them. Bill Peters (Head coach) is whipping what was a very lazy team into gear, Ron Francis (GM) is making some very smart trades, and Brind'Amour (A. Coach) has made one of the best special teams in the league. Top 10 for both powerplay and pk. The future looks good.   What's the story been on the current season? Are we talented but underperforming? Injuries? Just completely lost?   We took a lot of bad injuries in the preseason (J. Staal broke his leg) and in the first month. We didn't win a single game in October. Part of that is injuries, part of it is a new coach and front office. The team looked lazy and listless in 2014. Jordan Staal came back at the beginning of 2015, and we look like a different team. He and Eric have definitely found their groove, and the team is working. We look good out there most nights, it's just working on having a team that can play all 60 minutes, not just 40. But conditioning take time, and we'll get there.   On a side note, we seem to have a love/hate relationship with Cam Ward. When he's playing great, we love him. This season he really stepped his game up and I couldn't be happier with his performance. Khudobin has settled in and is still a fantastic backup. Overall, this team has the materials to be awesome, but we just keep struggling to find the back of the net. We have lost so many games this season by a single goal, it's maddening."

To answer your question about the Checkers, Carrick leads the D corps there in points, but is a -20 and isn't exactly lighting it up. (Biega is a -21. Lowe is a -11.)

canes,2yrram,veirossang,8,Thu Mar 12 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"Buy your tickets closer to game day. StubHub is usually fine. The 'Canes aren't very good this year so tix should be cheap and plentiful. The official ticket specials suck compared to what they used to have, but tickets often go on StubHub for below face value. Sightlines are good from most of the arena, unless you're sitting way down low. Note that in the corners of the upper deck, glass partitions and handrails can get in the way a little bit if you're sitting in the lower portion of the section. But really, there aren't many bad seats. IMO the best seats are along the upper portions of the lower deck. Parking is $15, which is a ripoff compared to what it used to be. Hurricanes fans tailgate. Bring food and drinks if you're so inclined. If you just want a free spot to leave your car, some fans park across Edwards Mill Road at an office park that connects to the main parking lot. Our mascot is Stormy. He is a pig. This is because we have hog farms in eastern NC. Lots of them. And of course we're famous for barbecue, which in NC is pit-roasted pulled pork, not whatever mess they eat in Kansas City or Texas or whatever other godforsaken place. Now you know why we have a pig mascot. Every time I go to a 'Canes game, some clueless dingus asks what a pig has to do with hockey. Don't be that guy. We have lots of transplants from up north. When certain teams are in town, a lot of opposing fans will be there, Philly being one of those teams. Despite Philly's reputation, I've never really had bad experiences with visiting Flyers fans. There's a kiosk (maybe more than one, I can't remember) called ""Sinfully Sinnamon"" that cells cinnamon buns. Get one. Seriously. Even if you don't usually get stadium food. 'Canes fans are usually pretty well-behaved. The only time we've really had issues with opposing fans was during the mid-late 2000s with Buffalo fans, and only because they kept showing up at the arena in droves and making complete asses of themselves. We have one of the most family-friendly environments in the NHL. The crazy blond guy you see on the scoreboard after we score a goal is Ric Flair, a very famous pro wrestler from Charlotte. This is assuming we'll actually score a goal, which may or may not happen. People yell ""red"" during the national anthem, as in ""the rockets' red glare."" It's a tradition 'Canes fans adopted from NC State, whose primary color is also red. Prepare to be underwhelmed by the atmosphere. PNCA has a reputation of being loud and lively, but several consecutive seasons of lackluster hockey and missing the playoffs (along with rising costs) have led to a drop in attendance this year. It's a real shame, because we really blow the roof off that place whenever we make the postseason. Drive to Durham either before or after the game and eat at Cosmic Cantina. They advertise ""the best Mexican food on the planet"" and it's probably true."

I thought it was pretty interesting.  That said, if you're going to BBQ at the game, the BBQ nachos are the winner.   Drive to Durham either before or after the game and eat at Cosmic Cantina.

Nope.  That was never a pig farm.  It was owned by NCSU (could you imagine a pig farm in that part of town?  It would be pretty hard to ignore the stench right next to Carter-Finley stadium)    An early sponsor of the Canes in '97 was a hog farming interest from down east.  One of the conditions of sponsorship what that a pig would be represented in some way on the team.  They settled on a pig for the mascot."

Obviously I'd be ecstatic for McDavid or Eichel, but we don't have a shot either unless we win the draft lottery. No more trading away high picks as win now type moves. We did that for J. Staal and he is one of our best players, but the trade hasn't exactly made us a great team either. Ironically trading for him is indirectly why we're not competing for McDavid or Eichel now; we would be an absolute lock for one of them without him. But we have to keep the rebuild going, and we need all of our draft picks to do so, especially the ones in the first few rounds."
canes,2xydso,buffaloha,5,Wed Mar 4 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"I say, do everything possible to get in the top two this year. Those kids are franchise makers.

canes,2xydso,XdshortX,3,Wed Mar 4 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"It'd have to be something like 3-4 first round picks (this years and next 2-3 years), Faulk, Skinner/Lindholm and possibly even more. Think Eric Lindros or Herschel Walker type of trade. I doubt anyone would want the Staals as the main roster pieces given their age/ridiculous salaries. And I'm not even sure if the other pieces I mentioned would get it done either."
canes,2xydso,buffaloha,2,Wed Mar 4 23:13:24 2015 UTC,"No player coming in the next two drafts has the ability of McDavid or Eichel. I'd give up both firsts this year, another next and skinner for either."

canes,2xydso,unintentional_jerk,2,Thu Mar 5 02:26:47 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised if we didn't just use all our picks. The talent in our farm system is one of the worst in the league, and this draft is supposed to be the deepest in years. RF has stated his desire to build through the draft.  Don't forget that RF was the driving force being the drafting of both Skinner and Faulk - by far our best 2 draft picks in recent years."
canes,2xydso,Hurricane_Viking,2,Thu Mar 5 14:51:04 2015 UTC,Personally I think that we should just use all 11 in the draft. Get 11 players for them. I think we have 6 in the top 100 which should turn out well seeing how this is expected to be the deepest draft in 10 years. I wouldn't be surprised to see us move up in the draft by sending 1 or 2 of the later round picks off in some sort of deal. If we don't move up in the draft we might just use them to get a prospect thats a little farther along in his development. Either way its nice to have options like that.
canes,2xydso,APPaholic47,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:01:05 2015 UTC,This is the most sensible and likely. I'd love to trade up as you stated. If we could have like 4 of the top 40 prospects the likelihood of finding at least a couple of good NHLers could change the direction of this team

His value right now is a lot higher than usual. He played good last night and apparently ranks first for us and 14th in the league in face-off percentage (55.3%). Has he ever been worth as much as he is right now? Will he be again?   In any case, Ron has said they won't be very busy tomorrow, so I'm guessing they've made all the important moves.

canes,2xkcsa,AwHellNaw24,6,Sun Mar 1 15:29:29 2015 UTC,It's a good sign for us.  McClement has been a huge part of the PKs success this year and has brought together a 4th line that can contribute from time to time.

He allows about 1 and a quarter shots per 2 minute per pk, if he were on the ice the entire two minutes. I didn't realize this until I went looking at it. Kinda nuts.

canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:48:50 2015 UTC,2 and 3 are good points.  1 is debatable at best and he is an asset to young D.  I agreed on other comments that it was definately worth the trade.  No doubt.  But I would like him to stay around a few years either as another 1 year signing (we dont have to give him too much) or as part of the organization as a leader that has been a big part of this teams defense over that last decade.
canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,3,Sat Feb 28 19:06:32 2015 UTC,Then provide me useful statistics that detail why Gleason is a good defensman.  Hero chart  Goals for % On ice: 35% Goals for % Off ice: 45%  Shots for % On ice: 49.9% Shots for % Off ice: 52.8%  This is all while playing sheltered minutes against poor competition.
canes,2xh649,Hurricane_Viking,3,Sat Feb 28 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"He is a big part of the league leading PK and that isn't going to show in his ""fancy"" stats. He doesn't produce offense, but he is good in the defensive zone. As much as I love Gleason, and his willingness to drop the mits, I still think this is a good trade and depending on how Hillen plays I think we could see Tim back next season. Good trade by GMRF."
canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,5,Sat Feb 28 20:13:22 2015 UTC,The goals and shots for % takes both offense and defense into account. We're better off with him on the bench than on the ice.
canes,2xh649,Librewian,2,Sat Feb 28 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"My guess is that this was a move to build more into the Hurricanes future.    Gleason played well last night.  He puts his heart into every game.  But he rarely scores anymore.  And at the end of the game, the goals are what wins games.    He was going to be an unrestricted free agent, and while he was not making 7mil a season, the way the Canes have been positioning themselves, they have clearly been freeing up cap space this season.    It's highly likely that due to his age, prior injuries and possible salary demands, we would not have resigned Gleason after April. This way, the team at least gets something for the hole he leaves and not the nothing we would have by May.    Draft picks are cheap.  Some late rounders become big stars.  The team might end up signing someone at league minimum this summer who goes on to score more goals, which again, wins games."
canes,2xh649,notleonardodicaprio,5,Sat Feb 28 17:40:30 2015 UTC,he rarely scores anymore   He's a defenseman...
canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he is a D and at the end of the game, he is measured not in goals scored.  He is a leader and being at the game last night, our defensive play got the crowd (those of us from CAR) more excited than anything else.  Our team is rebuilding and I think that he is one of the ones that could lead the back half of our team in the right direction.  We have some good young forwrds that have plenty of mentors.  The Staals and Semin and even Brind'amour or Francis can help those guys.  This draft class will likey be where we focus on a solid defense. (our +/- is abysmal and looking at the top teams, a solid D is what can really make the difference of being an ok and being an good team).  I agree that he is old and that we at least get something from him but maybe we could use him after this off-season again for Faulk or other yound D prospects/picks."
canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,3,Sat Feb 28 18:25:26 2015 UTC,"Faulk is our leading points-getter and is a defenseman, so it's a bit misleading to say that defensemen aren't measured in some part by goals. We've got decent defense prospects in our system. If anything, we need centers and forwards. There's not a single winger in our system that I expect to stick in the NHL. Plus/minus is a terrible stat for measuring really anything."
canes,2xh649,ghjm,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"points =/= goals.  And yes is it is one metric by which they are judged by but definitely not key.  I would much rather see few defensive goals if our better D players don't have a -9 instead of -18 for +/-.  That is a much more valuable statistic for D and no matter how many goals Faulk or Gleason were to score, it would be irrelevant if they can't keep their rating closer to even.  And I would highly disagree with the winger assessment.  Skinner, Nash and Lindholm I think are all NHL caliber young players that all not just stay around but become good play-makers.  I know they are not all wingers but I think they are all good forwards to build around."
canes,2xh649,pacefalmd,4,Sat Feb 28 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Skinner, Nash, and Lindholm are also not prospects, so it's completely irrelevant to my statement.   Again, plus minus is pretty much a useless stat. Here's a better on for you. When Gleason is off the ice, we score 45% of the goals, the other team scores 55%. When Gleason is on the ice, we score 35% of the goals, the other team scores 65%. We're way better off without him, and getting a 4th rounder back for him is amazing."

canes,2xeoe4,s1apshot,2,Sat Feb 28 03:17:49 2015 UTC,50% is max I believe.   From there you take max that you can from the contract and trade for a player that is a rental with about $3.5 mil or less for the remainder of their contract. It then opens up us an ass load of room compared to where we are now.

canes,2x8vh9,agentdcf,6,Thu Feb 26 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I thought I'd come over from the Kings board with some information on your new prospect. This story comes from a fairly well-connected blogger who wrote a series of good posts on the Kings top prospects a month or two ago. I wanted to pass it along as it's the most recent substantial report of his development progress I know of, and thought you all would be interested to get to know your new player. You might also search the rest of that site for McKeown, I'm sure there are more reports there going to back to when we first acquired him. (Plus, this guy is a pretty good independent blogger, and I think it's fair to drive some traffic for his site to help him out.)  Also, don't miss the link embedded in this article to another piece by the same writer (here).  It looks like you guys are happy with the Sekera trade overall, and I'm glad to see that. I think it was a good deal for both teams. Those are solid assets you got for him, and he gives us a much better chance at continuing our run. He's an expensive rental, but that price is understandable at the moment; if we can re-sign him (no guarantees, obviously), then it becomes a great deal for us.    All the best going forward."
canes,2x8vh9,Chilldyl,2,Thu Feb 26 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I suppose I can pull for y'all on the west coast this playoff run, you guys have three former Canes now."

canes,2x8vh9,s1apshot,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly really excited for his potential, with him Murphy, Faulk, and Fleury we have a really good set of D prospects. Forward prospects need a lot of help."

canes,2x8dn2,BarkMingo,3,Thu Feb 26 17:43:58 2015 UTC,Faulk. He's still a youngster but its time for him to step up. He just became the defensive leader of this team for years to come.
canes,2x8dn2,z_lubes,8,Thu Feb 26 22:09:42 2015 UTC,Faulk would be my first choice.  Semin is a possibility.  Might make him step up.
canes,2x8dn2,garnerh42,6,Thu Feb 26 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Semin's an interesting choice. I think he had an A for one preseason game last year. Considering how the team has been trading the assistant captains, it might lead to a move.   Hainsey shared the letter earlier in the season, which makes me think they'll go for him."
canes,2x8dn2,venduss,3,Thu Feb 26 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Semin.  We should be trying anything to get him back to his game full time.  And this would be a small price for a potentially big reward.  I don't know about Faulk.  He has the ability to lead on the ice but I don't get the vibe he is ready to be a leader off the ice.  I could be wrong and this isn't anything against him.  Honestly Skinner hasn't played great this season but his post game interviews have been a highlight.  He is realistic and you can tell he wants to win.  If he can turn that into motivation for the rest of the team then maybe it should be him.  (I won't be at any Skinner fan club meetings, so this was only after trying to be really objective about it)."
canes,2x8dn2,elephino1,5,Thu Feb 26 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah.  In Peter's system of accountability (tm) giving a $7m bench warmer an A would be a slap in the face to the youngins that are working their asses off."
canes,2x8dn2,Volan1,5,Thu Feb 26 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"Justin Faulk. He's the face of our defense for years to come.  I'm surprised people are even considering Semin, have you all forgotten how bad he's been this year? Showing up the last couple of games doesn't excuse that. Plus, alternate captains need to be able to speak with the refs coherently, semin would probably misinterpret a lot."
canes,2x8dn2,venduss,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"I hear you about Semin and agree with the communication thing and its a valid concern.  But if this has a possibility of turning him back into point per game territory its worth it.  Otherwise we are stuck with a 7 million seat in the press box.  And while his start to the season was awful, so were a lot of others.  However it seems that Peters has had it out for him a little in that he has been letting Skinner who has similar stats (per game).  Not trying to turn this into a Semin vs Skinner as its not acceptable for either to play this way.  Both have issues on defense, turnovers, and scoring.  Sure it could be that attitude is the difference in why Skinner plays and Semin sits.  Skinner vs Semin"

We have two big power fowards who would dominate in that league, a young all-star dman in Faulk, and a skater like Skinner would do circles around those teams. Hell, Ward and Khudobin would have great seasons in Charlotte. It's true we are screwed with some shitty contracts that are already and going to hold us back.

canes,2x5huh,Hero_of_Brandon,5,Wed Feb 25 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"Tlusty wasn't doing much but this doesn't really seem like that great of a return to me.  Edit: Just remembered he's a UFA next season, so that makes it a little better that we got a little bit if we were going to let him walk anyway."
canes,2x5huh,mattfki5g,4,Wed Feb 25 20:45:01 2015 UTC,That's it? Winnipeg is going to be too high in the standings even if they don't make the playoffs for a 5th or 6th round pick to be worth much.
canes,2x5huh,RedwoodTaters,5,Wed Feb 25 20:52:57 2015 UTC,Slutty :( I'll miss him.
canes,2x5huh,Dinker31,3,Wed Feb 25 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"meh, was hoping for a 2nd rounder but this is what I should have expected, no surprise here  edit: I really only had hoped for that because I was wearing rose-colored glasses, but if you put fandom and personal attachment aside, Tlusty had been underwhelming since the lockout season, was very streaky, has no playoff experience, and doesn't add much physicality to the game...a non-physical, streaky secondary scorer isn't all that sought-after in a rental player, I think Francis did just fine here"

canes,2x5huh,boffosan,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:17:43 2015 UTC,I just see this as picks/cap relief. Tlusty was a UFA and there was no guarantee he would be back. Hoping we lock up Nestrasil for a decent term.
canes,2x5huh,ArchPC,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"I literally looked to see if it was posted then clicked submit then it said it was already posted haha.   Moving on, I love this trade. He's not worth the money and is too inconsistent. He makes his living off of defenders paying attention to the Staals, Skinner or whoever else and he reaps the benefits. He's been a project for too long. Like the guy a lot but we need to create space for wingers of the future who bring more to the team, have upside, and can create on their own. Good luck to him in Winnipeg."
canes,2x5huh,APPaholic47,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty bad return for what Winnik got, but his comments with Chip make me think there's a really good chance he'll just turn around and sign right back here in the offseason. If we can afford him."
canes,2x5huh,xiolyph,0,Wed Feb 25 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Could have and should have gotten more. We were fleeced. Hell, Winnik got a 2nd, 4th, and Sill from the pens."
canes,2x5huh,_cam_,2,Wed Feb 25 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"but Winnik hits and can play a great 4th line role, and has also played in 5 playoff series in his career when Tlusty has 0 postseason games...Winnik is a more valuable rental player, people need to calm down and realize this...in an offseason trade, you bet Tlusty would fetch more in return than Winnik, but as a UFA rental for the playoffs? Winnik is more valuable"
canes,2x5huh,BarkMingo,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, Winnik drew 2 picks and a player. We got 2 lower picks and no player. Then again we know how good of a GM JR is...."
canes,2x5huh,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Lots of Pens fans actually consider losing Sill as a positive.  In addition to what /u/BarkMingo already mentioned, Toronto also kept salary in the Winnik trade.  For a guy who may be gone in 1/4 of a season, we got a decent, but not great, return."
canes,2x5huh,phopandafan,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:14:18 2015 UTC,Toronto also retained half his salary
canes,2x5huh,goochnorris,0,Thu Feb 26 12:14:45 2015 UTC,Kill it with fire.
canes,2x5huh,XdshortX,-2,Wed Feb 25 21:50:18 2015 UTC,I can't wait until the day comes where the Canes are making trades to push for a Cup rather than because of a lost season. Sadly that day will never come as long as Eric Staal is captain. Not saying he's the main reason but it's proven that ever since he took over the C from Rod we've yet to get to the postseason.
canes,2x5huh,iJacobes,-8,Thu Feb 26 00:05:32 2015 UTC,Basically traded nothing for nothing. The picks likely won't be worth much and Tlusty has been next to useless. I guess it frees up some cap space for us to not take advantage of.
canes,2x65z2,APPaholic47,3,Wed Feb 25 23:35:16 2015 UTC,Crazy return for a futur FA. Good job.
canes,2x4o3r,Zuro,3,Wed Feb 25 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"""You all""  But seriously, it probably won't be cancelled. Very unlikely"
canes,2x4o3r,z_lubes,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"First, welcome. The PNC arena is very accepting of fans of the other team. It seemed like half the bowl was Flyers fans last night. Be sure to get a NC beer while you're here. We have the most craft beer options of any team.   At this point, I'd be surprised if the game is canceled or delayed. Raleigh is trying to prep roads today, and the major highways you will be on will be the first to get cleared.   Also, they're likely to close the third level again. If you have upper bowl seats, you may be offered lower level seating. That's what the team did last night."
canes,2x4o3r,Librewian,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:35:41 2015 UTC,I hope that you find us Caps fans to be better than Flyers fans (never had anything good to say about Philly sports fans).  I'll definitely have to check out some of the craft beer options. I'm assuming the prices are just as expensive as the Verizon Center? (One draft beer is over $10).  And thanks for the quick reply. I'll have to keep an eye on the weather.
canes,2x4o3r,Librewian,2,Wed Feb 25 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"It's 20 ounces of draft beer for $10. Tax included. Also, the arena pays bartenders next to nothing, as they call it a tipped position, but they still cannot put out a tip jar. So please tip on boozahol purchases."

That said, you may encounter bad roads between here and there, but as of 9:00pm on Thursday, Raleigh is fine.   Parking at PNC is $15 cash. So, be wary of sticker shock."

How many players/coaches have had multiple stints with the Canes or came from the Plymouth Whalers?  I just hope this doesn't mean that Jordan wants out of Carolina like some people are suggesting.  It wouldn't look good to free agents that Jordan isn't interested in playing for the Canes, even with his brother on the team."

If you aren't going to commit to a younger core you have to keep both Staals to stay competitive. If we move JStaal without robbing the Penguins then I'm not going to like it.

canes,2wdn20,KidVicious13,5,Thu Feb 19 04:13:11 2015 UTC,I don't think he is going anywhere.  A $7 million dollar healthy scratch is not something anyone is going to trade for and the Hurricanes don't really have the money to buy him out.  My hope was that he would pull a Kovalchuk and leave for the KHL.  But with the Russian economy the way it is I doubt he will get any enticing offers.

And I believe that is the limit. So even if we can trade him I'm not sure we can retain any of his salary, so then finding someone to trade him to is gonna be impossible. Id rather not buy him out, because then you have literally dead money instead of healthy scratch money.

That logo is sweet and the song was fantastic but guess what.... They were awful, and they obviously didn't get enough support to stay. The Canes have been to the ECF 3 times, the SCF twice and won it once. How many times did the Whalers do that?  The Canes have their own heritage and history to celebrate. I'm sick of being on r/hockey and 90% of the time the Canes are mentioned someone has a ""bring back the whale"" or ""can't wait for Hartford to get them back"" comment. Grrrrr OK rant over."

Sure it's completely possible, but the average Reddit user is not in that age group. Plus I'm going to take it there and say I think it's a little bit of salt. I feel like a lot of northerners think we don't deserve a hockey team, because we don't love it like he do. I agree on the heritage part too, the Whalers didn't do shit but have nice jerseys. I'm truthfully not even a big fan of the logo. Jesus it feels good to get this off my chest."
canes,2vjty0,Johnny_Mo88,6,Thu Feb 12 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"Beyond the canes being more successful, at the end of this season the team will have been the Carolina Hurricanes the same amount of time they have been the Hartford Whalers in the NHL.   Every time I see a ""What jersey do you wish your team still wore"" thread and post I like our older jerseys better than the new ones I get tons of comments like ""Hur, you mean the whalers jerseys.""  No, fuck you, I mean the old Canes jersey with the warning flag stripe.   No one ever harps on how the Dallas stars used to be the Minnesota North stars, or the current Winnipeg team used to be the Atl Thrashers, or the Calgary Flames used to be the Atl Flames, or how the Coyotes used to be the old jets, or the Colorado Avalanche used to be the old Quebec Nordiques. Yet every goddamn time I say something about the old canes I get downvoted and reminded that they were once the Hartford whalers, who apparently were a fucking powerhouse team in the NHL, a league favorite, who were ripped away from a massive, loving, and supporting fan base who did everything in their power to retain their dear whalers. And how the Carolina Hurricanes are a cruel joke played on all true NHL fans because they aren't the beloved Whalers, and no matter what they achieve, or how loyal their fan base is, they will never match up to the majesty of the old Hartford club, and all the Canes fans are trailer trash who don't understand the sport of hockey and only come to watch fights because we're all low class, beer swilling, stupid, rednecks.

canes,2vjty0,Mundog,3,Fri Feb 13 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe, MAYBE, for one night, but it will have absolutely no effect on attendance the rest of the season. Hell you could play it at every game and play it as much much as they did in Hartford, and it isn't going to make legions of fans come to watch a shitty team play hockey (It didn't in Hartford ).  You know what will? Investing in scouting and creating a depth of young talent this team can pull from for years to come (A la Detroit). Stop offering such ridiculous contracts to players who don't deserve it (thanks again JR). Letting some talent go in order to build for the future. It's not an overnight process, and its going to take years, but I think GMRF has that goal and is taking steps to achieve it.   If they can create a playoff caliber team then attendance will return. The real trick is creating a team that makes the post season year after year.   Also, FUN FACT! Did you know, the goal horn at PNC Arena is the very same one used in the Hartford Civic Center during the Whalers tenure? Isn't that enough nightly Whalers nostalgia for everyone?"

If we weren't paying out for Jordan, Eric, Semin, Skinner and Ward, that range would be reasonable.   Sekera is worth way more than Semin, especially this season, so it's easy to see his stance.

canes,2vhd2a,mattfki5g,6,Wed Feb 11 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, getting rid of Ward only creates more issues.  Khudobin hasn't been bad this year but he also hasn't been able to pull out the wins like he did last year.  Ward has been the better goalie and we don't exactly have someone ready to move to the NHL level to replace him.  I think we need to continue the Ward/Khudobin pairing for another year and decide what to do.  Trading Semin won't fix any issues, his value is too low and his salary to high.  Hopefully he can turn it around otherwise we are going to continue overpaying for his production."
canes,2vhd2a,venduss,2,Wed Feb 11 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"Khudobin also had some of the worst goal support in the NHL during his losses. Once the team turned it on offensively he won what, like 6 in a row? (That's a lot for us) I completely agree we should keep both while Cam is playing well though because as you stated there really is no one besides Khudobin ready to play at this level. And without a doubt Cam has been the better of the two, but I don't think by that much.   If, and that's a big if, we can get rid of Semin while retaining a minimum amount of his contract, I say do it no matter the return. We have too many bad contracts and his is by far the worst. Yea, it probably won't fix anything immediately just to dump him somewhere else for nothing, but it will help us in the off season and give us some breathing room on where to spend. If Semin wasn't here, Sekera would be locked up already. Even if we retained like 2m a year of Semins salary we could afford Sekera right now. I'd take that in a heartbeat. Waiting for Semin to turn it around has become his thing on multiple teams. I can't imagine the Hurricanes of all teams will inspire him to do so."
canes,2vhd2a,mattfki5g,2,Wed Feb 11 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that offensively the team wasn't there in front of Khudobin.  I don't blame the loses completely on him, it was just as much the team in front of him.  It is hard to win when your team is scoring 1 goal or less.    I want us to re-sign Sekera but I am not convinced that even without Semin's cap hit we should re-sign him.  He deserves to be rewarded with a fair salary however I also don't want to see the Hurricanes give out another inflated salary similar to Semin's.  If Sekera is indeed asking for 5.5+ per year I think that is a little much.  Hopefully this is all part of the salary negotiation game and we won't need to find out a new capable partner for Faulk, out of the mediocre pool of possibilities."

Doesn't look like Eric Staal or Cam Ward are willing to go anywhere, so whatever, let them play out their contract and sign them for a discount next year if they like Raleigh so much.   Sekara, would be great to re-up on him, but if he's demanding 6-million I would trade him. We can't risk signing him to a big contract for several years, could turn ugly like Ruutu or Gleason.   Tlusty, I'd keep him. He's not going to make or break our offense but he's a contributor.   Jeff Skinner, his trade value might be low, and he is really popular here, but I would trade him just as a precaution, no telling how long his career will be.

canes,2vgt4n,fireman910,2,Wed Feb 11 04:31:03 2015 UTC,My guess is that we could get something semi-decent out of the trade.  I'd hate to see him go.  He gives 110% every night.
canes,2vgt4n,canesfan81,3,Wed Feb 11 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. He fits the style Peters is implementing so well. One more year at a reasonable cap number and a solid shot at signing him again would make me very apprehensive about trading if I were in Francis' shoes. This year, at least."
canes,2vgt4n,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:49:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno I want options this offseason.  Maybe we can get Erik Cole for cheap, take a run at Justin Williams? Who knows? I'd like to bring up the young D-men we have in the OHL this year and give them a couple games here.  So yea we could trade some D-men too. I wouldn't mind getting dealing McClement, Dwyer, Nash, or Tlusty either."
canes,2vgt4n,canesfan81,3,Wed Feb 11 05:44:53 2015 UTC,Erik Cole for cheap   No. Erik Cole is old(36) and not producing much in Dallas. Its not worth signing him.
canes,2vgt4n,Hurricane_Viking,3,Wed Feb 11 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"Plus, he bashed our franchise last time he left."
canes,2vgt4n,canesfan81,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, for a to 1.75-2.5 million dollars a year he's a hell of a lot better third line player than Nathan Gerbe. Did you even look at his stats this year? 15 goals 11 assists +4, and he has a soft spot for Carolina."
canes,2vgt4n,fireman910,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that he could do that in Carolina at 37-38 years old next year? He is also making 4mil this year, you think he is gonna take a 50% pay cut to play here, when he left to get more money in Montreal? We need to get younger players who we can develop, not older players on their way out."
canes,2vgt4n,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes, he's 36 years old though so he probably won't have many other options.  Someone is going to want him, and he'll be productive next year, he'll probably sign for about 2.5 Million. I'd like that team to be us. As far as us need younger players, I agree but you don't pick up younger players to develop on the free agency market in this day and age they are tied to their draft team for practically forever and we don't have much in the way of promising young forwards."

canes,2vh2n5,ghjm,2,Thu Feb 12 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Dude. No. It makes no sense to give up on building a winning culture to double our chances at one draft pick for one player who may or may not be a game-changer, but who still can't succeed without that very same winning culture in place.  Our current players are capable of winning. If we keep improving like we have been, next year should be a lot better, with or without a draft pick."
canes,2vh2n5,venduss,3,Wed Feb 11 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  Winning cultures aren't built on ass ends of mediocre seasons; if they were we should already consider ourselves 'winners'.   Same shit, different season. Same core, different season."
canes,2vh2n5,ghjm,2,Wed Feb 11 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're both right.     I am hoping that Francis can take emotion out of it and trade some of the players that have seemed untouchable in the JR years.  The team needs a big shakeup, and maybe that's what you mean /u/ccarico.  I think this solves both problems you guys bring up which is better draft and also a different core."
canes,2vh2n5,Anviski,3,Wed Feb 11 03:28:23 2015 UTC,Have you been watching lately? It's not at all the same shit - they've actually been playing 60 minute games. That's some different shit right there.
canes,2vh2n5,elephino1,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  They play 60 minutes and if they end up being down early, they actually fight back.  This season has given us a better powerplay (not a top one but I feel like it could still improve), a phenomenal PK, a solid 4th line, and a good combo in the Staal brothers on the same line.  Also, not to mention, they are playing more physical again and we have some young guys on the team that I feel have a bright future."
canes,2vh2n5,Hurricane_Viking,0,Wed Feb 11 05:33:18 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  While it sucks that our chance to make the playoffs was over before the system was embraced in Carolina, we have the building blocks now of a young team that can win games.  No need to give that up now for a slightly better chance of a draft pick."
canes,2vh2n5,Dinker31,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:13:12 2015 UTC,"We really just need to out suck Arizona/CBJ. Edmonton/Buffalo are really bad, and we would have a hard time falling that low in the standings.  We really need to be in the top 3 picks. 11.5% are not great odds at 1st, but 45% chance at a top 3 pick is decent. McDavid/Eichel would obviously change our team, but if we get Hanifin then I wouldn't be disappointed.  If Fluery and Hanifin can be as good as Faulk(which isn't crazy to assume the can be) then we would have a solid core of Dmen to build around for a long time."

canes,2vh2n5,Supercactus,0,Thu Feb 12 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"This kind of talk kind of infuriates me. No true fan cheers for their team to lose. So, say we lose as many games as you want and what do we get? A single player. No single player can make that big of a difference - especially if a team is bad enough to lose enough games to end up in last place. It's about coaching, chemistry, and the collective talent of all players. Anyone that thinks one player can magically take us from last place to anything resembling a good team is fooling themselves and have never played a team sport."

canes,2uzib5,AwHellNaw24,2,Fri Feb 6 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"Well he is suggesting we sell anything that isn't bolted down.  Gerbe's contract is reasonable enough and his consistent play even without much scoring this season would make him attractive as a depth player.  So trading him may get us something (prospect/draft pick) in return.  I don't think his value would be high enough to make this worth it but I wouldn't be against it if a trade came around.  Also, you don't only trade guys when they are doing poorly.  Its also good to cash in when a player is successful, as the return will be better."
canes,2utuan,Caniac24,8,Thu Feb 5 02:40:21 2015 UTC,I really hope he does drop the hammer on Skinner.  Not sure what is going on with him but maybe sitting him for a bit will help to get him refocused.

He's not the same player. I don't know if he ever will be. He's still got so much potential and is so young but if we could get a ton back for him wouldn't it he worth it? I feel dirty even mentioning it but the more I think about it the more it kind if makes since a little.

canes,2utuan,Johnny_Mo88,5,Thu Feb 5 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Its a great move by Peters. Skinner hasn't been scoring, which is what he gets paid to do. Skinner also hasn't been doing other things to make up for his lack of scoring. He hasn't been doing great defensively, he hasn't been picking up assists. I've said it before, Skinner doesn't fit in with our team. He is very talented, but he doesn't seem to have chemistry with anyone. If we trade him, I'm sure people will be super angry, he is a fan favorite, but depending on what we get in return, it could help in the long term."
canes,2utuan,Hurricane_Viking,5,Thu Feb 5 17:08:49 2015 UTC,It really depends what we can get though. his value on the market has to be the lowest it's been since he's been in the league

From what I can tell Peters didn't want to change up the lineup that had been winning games.  The first game Nesty played after his conditioning stint, (because of his injury), was a 3-0 loss.  Because of the loss though, Peters decided to switch back to the lineup he was icing while Nesty was injured.  We've been winning and doing well since, so I think Peters has just wanted to stick with what was working and seeing how the chemistry is developing.  Nesty should be in tonight's game though."

Honestly, I think that team was far more talented and the numbers speak for themselves.  That team won 52 games in the regular season, had two 9-game winning streaks, and finished 2nd in the East.  There were four 30+ goal scorers and four players with a 70+ points total.  One of our goalies had a 38-win season and the other won the Conn Smythe.  If the current team was as talented as that one, we would be at least contending for a playoff spot and not dwelling in the bottom of the standings."

If you look at the Staal line now, they are a big presence, it's hard to beat those guys off the puck with their skill and size.  Coaching has been great, in my opinion.  Peters has kept the locker room positive which is incredibly hard to do when your losing an entire month of hockey games.  I think he can be better in some areas, such as figuring out what to do with Semin, but beyond that he has a great mind for hockey and I feel fortunate to have him."
canes,2ucdv7,mattfki5g,2,Sat Jan 31 22:26:51 2015 UTC,Definitely not a coaching issue with the current team

That was the deepest team (Recchi, Weight, Williams, Whitney, Stillman, etc) ever fielded by the Hurricanes and we had an really good unproven coach with amazing leadership.

canes,2ucdv7,orangejuicefan,2,Sun Feb 1 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Four guys on the team who finished with 70+ points. We had fucking Andrew Ladd on our fourth line. Defense wasn't that bad either.

Seriously though, I agree with what the article says. The tank is over. The amount of suck we would need to put on is nearly unreachable.   And I've been too afraid to say it, but I'm on board with the Jeff Skinner trade. I like the kid, but he's not as good as the hype for him is. His concussions are adding up and he's just physically weak. We need to cash him in before the rest of the league realizes it or else he's just gonna slowly drop down in the lineup until he's irrelevant and we find a rookie with as much point production for half the price"

I would like to know how much Semin would save us if he got sent to the minors. I am ok with trading Skinner. I think we could get a good return for him. On the right team, with the right linemates he could put up 30 in a season. We would need to get a younger player with some promise to replace him though."

What we need is the  #1 or #2 and unfortunately, just don't have enough value to get it. No team would want anything we have to offer in order to give up those draft picks. I'm not saying there isn't other talent in the top 10 but not game changers like McDavid and Eichel.   The scary part is we haven't really built through the draft, we haven't developed our prospects well, and we don't have the available value to trade for any big names. I'm not sure next season will be a different outcome.   EDIT: You might say, well we're playing well now with our current group, but there in lies the problem. Depth. One injury to a key player at the beginning of any season can put us out of contention."

canes,2u3or9,APPaholic47,3,Thu Jan 29 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"While I love this team, I can't help but think that we're in a tough spot.  We're in a cap hell situation with our large contracts to Ward, both Staals, Skinner, and Semin.  We don't really have too many pieces that we can deal that might draw a reasonable return (Faulk, Sekera, Tlusty, Khudobin) and the organization will do all in its power to prevent losing some of those guys.  However, due to the cap situation we're in, we don't really have the space to sign all of the guys who we want to.  I think we might lose Sekera and/or Tlusty at or before the deadline, as I don't think we have the space to resign one or both of them at the end of the season.  I don't see us being able to move any of our big contracts unless we can sucker someone into taking Semin's abomination of a contract or Ward.  I'm not 100% certain on how the cap works in the off season, but we may be able to shunt Semin to the minors to free up cap space (ala LA with Richards), but I don't think the organization can afford to do that.  Tl;dr: I don't really want to lose any of the pieces that may get a reasonable return, but I think we have to move someone in order to avoid losing them for nothing in the offseason due to not having cap space."
canes,2u3or9,phopandafan,2,Thu Jan 29 18:31:29 2015 UTC,I think Tllusty is the most expendable. He's do hot and cold and it seems most of his goals are the result of his linemates. I know Sekera deserves a raise and we could probably get a decent return for him but I think we have to keep him. Who would replace him? Ward has finally become Ward again and has actually stayed healthy.  I'm glad I don't have to make that decision.   I'm honestly kind of lost myself at what they should do. I just hope we don't screw ourselves out of a top pick only to finish 9-11
canes,2u3or9,Hurricane_Viking,2,Thu Jan 29 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard we are in talks to keep Sekera around, if we can get him an extension then obviously we are keeping him. I think if we trade him, and he goes into the offseason as a UFA we have a chance at resigning him. Tlusty I think we trade off and see what we can get for him. He can score goals and can play in the top 6 of a team with some good linemates and put up numbers.    I can't help but to think that Ward or Dobby will have offers coming in. Ward has a NMC so, its up to him if he stays or goes. There are a few teams out there that could use help in net and I think that either one can put up good numbers with a defense in front of them.    Semin is the most painful thing about our cap situation. No one will want to trade unless we keep a crazy amount of salary, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't get above the 3rd line under Peters, and thats only because our 4th line is clicking.    We saw Harry get moved earlier this season, so other than Sekera I don't see us moving another Dman. I guess Gleason/JML/Hainsey could go somewhere, but I'm not holding my breath. JML has the best chance at getting moved, and thats only to a team desperate for a PP QB.    Other than Sekera/Tlusty/JML/Goalie it would be a big trade, that nobody talks about until the week or two before the deadline.    TL;DR: Sekera is either resigned or a possible rental player, Tlusty goes. Maybe a goalie leaves, JML if someone is desperate. Fuck Semin's contract. Maybe a big move at the deadline."

Gleason plays the right side(off-side) a lot. Sekera mainly plays the left, if I'm not mistaken. Not GM but, obviously picks/prospects/young talent would be what we are looking for.

canes,2tkkj9,btownbomb,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:32:34 2015 UTC,I think that forward prospects would be ideal. If we can get a defensive prospect that would be ready to make the jump sooner rather than later wouldn't be a bad move.

Edit: ""There is a Connecticut Hockey Hall of Fame banner and, yes, that can find an appropriate spot commemorating the inductees. But what do you do with Ron Francis' No. 10, Kevin Dineen's No. 11 and Ulf Samuelsson's No. 5?  Those numbers were raised by Rangers/MSG management after the three had retired and the Whalers had moved to Carolina. Those numbers, in essence, were not retired. They were commemorated. If anybody deserves to be remembered in Hartford it's Francis.""  So some of those numbers aren't retired, but commemorated."

This idea that Connor McDavid is going to, by his mere presence, sell out PNC Arena every night - well, it's just nonsense. Maybe he'll develop into a franchise player over a period of years. But it's incredibly optimistic to say this is even a 50-50 shot right now. He could get concussed early in the season and never play the same again. I'm sorry, but that's how hockey works. A team is bigger than any one player.  So in the calculus of trying to do better next year, allowing the team to collapse - which would destroy any notion of work ethic or winning attitude or player chemistry or etc etc - would be far worse than losing a chance at an 18-year-old prospect, no matter how good the scouting report.  I think Bill Peters' turnaround of this team has been nothing short of miraculous. Imagine if Peters somehow figures out what makes Semin tick, and gets him playing the way he's supposed to. Seriously - think about how Eric Staal looked in the Toronto game. Our L10 is 3 points out of first in the division. Imagine if Peters could get all our pieces playing like that.  Then think about Buffalo+McDavid. Really? You'd pick that over what we've already got? Why?"

Sucking in order to get a 20% chance at sucking less next year...?  McEichel is not the only way to stave off mediocrity. It's not like the Penguins are the only team with championship opportunities each year. (In fact, we have the same number of Stanley Cups as Pittsburgh since Crosby was drafted.)

canes,2sb729,bmoorewiz,6,Wed Jan 14 03:01:18 2015 UTC,I think this shows the confidence that the players have in Francis & Peters more than anything else. I think he's seen the team turn around since the beginning of the year. Eric knows that Francis is going to make the right moves this offseason If we can get one of the top 2 picks then we can get out of the vicious cycle of mediocrity. Eric sees that and wants to be a part of it.

canes,2scfty,APPaholic47,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:56:04 2015 UTC,I imagine Francis will try to re-sign him before the trade deadline.  If that cannot be done I think the right move is to trade him rather than risk getting nothing for him in free agency.

I would say decide what you want to pay first then look for tickets in that range.  The seats I like the least are the club level (200s) but it may just be that I sat in the corner and there was a little bit of one of the corners of the ice that was hard to see.  I would recommend front row seats though, so that when the Penguins lose I can see the sad look on your face.  (sorry the penguins bring out the worst in me)."

canes,2rzkgx,SpoinkaDoink,4,Sat Jan 10 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"Here's my biggest problem with Semin. He has the talent, but he doesn't make the smart plays. I just watched him make two pretty stupid plays. One a pass from down low across the ice to the point when there were 3 people in that path, it got intercepted and the blues came into our zone. Another taking a shot from almost the goal line to a squared up goalie, missed and when you miss from there it wraps around and ends up in our zone again.  It's just stuff like that that keeps him from being a great player every night. You never know if one of his mistakes will lead to a game changing moment. And he just makes so many bad ones. Not to mention he has a hard time matching the speed of his linemates"
canes,2rzkgx,Gibson19,3,Sun Jan 11 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"Lets all be honest here, Semin was signed because he is an elite PLAYMAKER.  He hasn't been given the best opportunities.  If Cam and Skinner get chances to play through ruts, Semin should get that chance too.  Healthy scratching him and not giving him ice time isn't going to make him play better.  He needs time to get out of his rut, hell we started Cam Ward for months when he would give up 4 goals a game.  Just my opinion, I miss the old Semin."

canes,2rt5rz,cgwhite44,2,Fri Jan 9 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"According to the Times’ Stephen Whyno, Pitkanen broke his calcaneus in eight places, a similar injury to the one ex-Washington forward Pat Peake suffered in 1996 — one that all but ended his career.   A single bone broke eight times. Eight times. It's in a joint too."
canes,2rt5rz,Jazzy_Josh,2,Fri Jan 9 03:33:19 2015 UTC,The heel bone is very fragile and does not break like normal bones. If I remember correctly it usually shatters almost and Joni's was broken in 8 spots I believe. I know 2 seasons ago one of the coaches met with him after he should of been ready and he was still limping. I broke my lower thumb bone in two and had 3 pins to fix it. I can't imagine how many pins/screws/other metal were in his heal to fit 8 pieces back together.
canes,2rt5rz,landopope,2,Fri Jan 9 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"very fragile   It's actually quite strong and large. It's just that when a force is great enough to actually break the calcaneus, the force is so massive that it fucks the bone to pieces. Many pieces means there is a lot of surface area along all of the breaks, so it takes a much longer amount of time to heal, not to mention the shifting that occurs which further delays the process.  Ah, the benefits of becoming a biped from a quadruped by having a rear wrist bone swell into a large, retarded shape! Thanks, natural selection."
canes,2rt5rz,ProjectMeat,2,Fri Jan 9 06:53:05 2015 UTC,I probably shouldn't have used the word fragile but meant when it breaks it REALLY breaks. Thanks for clearing that up.

canes,2rrulw,fireman910,2,Fri Jan 9 01:51:15 2015 UTC,It seems to be pretty common. I know that Daniels(Checkers head coach) tries to run a system similar to what Peters runs with the Canes so that it is easier for the call ups to adjust. Jordan and Boychuk have both played with a lot of the guys in Charlotte so it should be pretty easy for them to adjust back to that level.

canes,2rtvkt,Sk1nnyLov3,2,Fri Jan 9 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"Bad is good right now. This team needs a new direction after 5 years of middle of the pack finishes. New GM and new coach and I'm already seeing a shift in the right direction. The work effort has gone up but the skill is still not there. The new system is generating shots but we can't finish because we aren't strong enough to get to the front of the net nor skilled enough for spectacular goals. After we are out of the bad contracts from JR's time I expect this team will look much different. Peters has been great about pulling up the young guys and putting them in a position to succeed. To me this is much better than trying to sign people in free agency to fill holes. There are too many holes to fill for that strategy. This means our depth is not going to be on par with the rest of the league but it's what the team needs. We need to get younger, get out of bad contracts, and look for the future.   There are plenty of reasons why we are bad, and we are going to be bad for a little longer if we want to see anything more than mediocrity for the foreseeable future."

canes,2rtvkt,mattfki5g,3,Fri Jan 9 19:20:57 2015 UTC,Well they fired GMJR so we will see a new draft strategy and they brought in a coach that puts the call ups in positions where they will do well rather than just to plug a hole for an injury. Not to mention most of the call ups have been given legitimate playing time when they performed well. I see a drastic difference in how our young guys are performing this year over the last couple of years.  Edit: I guess technically JR quit and was not fired.

canes,2rntxk,orangejuicefan,0,Wed Jan 7 23:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that has more to do with him playing single digit minutes a night with complete garbage offensive players like McClement and Dwyer. He is always put in situations where it's next to impossible to succeed, yet when he doesn't people seem to scratch their heads wondering why when it's clear as day. He had maybe one or two games in the top 6, and even then it was with invisible garbage like Eric Staal and Jiri Tlusty, who sleepwalk their way through games until spring. He never got any real chance here, throughout all of his years. Which is hilarious, considering an offensive blackhole like Rask is basically handed great minutes and PP time, although he has never really looked any better than most of our other call ups. This organization plays favorites, and we'll continue to argue about why we suck for the next several years until we bring in an outside presence from another organization instead of cycling through all the incompetent people who ""trained"" under JR."

canes,2rntxk,canesfan81,-1,Wed Jan 7 22:48:01 2015 UTC,His stats from last season are irrelevant as well but just so you know he scored a couple goals during the last week to make them look a lot better. Dwyer is not an NHL player and this team has been terrible ever since we've had him on the roster. I want Dwyer gone. That's my opinion and that is not going to change. I'd much much rather have LaRose up in that spot even.
canes,2rntxk,Big_Titles,2,Wed Jan 7 22:56:22 2015 UTC,I wanna buy my horse the blinders you are wearing. Dwyer is talented and is an NHL caliber player.
canes,2rntxk,Vontech615,3,Wed Jan 7 23:02:32 2015 UTC,Lines 1-4 throughout the NHL play some version of dump and chase at some point. Dwyer is one of the players on our team on a short list that can actually dump it in and out chase the defenders. He's exactly what you need in a 4th line/special teams type of player.
canes,2rntxk,Hurricane_Viking,2,Wed Jan 7 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"Good thing advance stats are relevant to 4th liners. The 4th line isn't going to be putting many shots on net most nights so his Corsi won't reflect much. He is also one of our best penalty killers. Other than Gerbe, he is probably the fastest guy on the team. Riley Nash hasn't been playing 1st/2nd line minutes like he was at the beginning of the season. If you thought that Nash was going to play all season like he was at the beginning of the year you are crazier than I thought."

canes,2rntxk,electronope,0,Fri Jan 9 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Dwyer sucks, and he would easily be replaceable by several players in the minors. No wonder our garbage management keep around as many mediocre players as possible: our fans fall in love with any player who looks like he ""tries hard"" on the ice, no matter how untalented that player may be. If you really think a player like Dwyer isn't easily replaceable, I really question what you know about hockey. Every team has at least 2-3 Dwyers on their team or waiting to be called up in the minors. It's clearly obvious you only watch Canes games."
canes,2rntxk,Big_Titles,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Bro, you don't watch hockey or know roles. There aren't many people like Dwyer out there with his speed and defensive skill set. I mean he is a 4th liner and on the 1st PK unit. He plays great and hard. I mean at least I know and understand the sport and what people are meant to do. Dwyer is a speedy board playing monster. Please keep sitting there you armchair GM and running your mouth."
canes,2rntxk,APPaholic47,0,Fri Jan 9 01:50:44 2015 UTC,Don't argue with him. Look through his comment history....
canes,2rntxk,Big_Titles,1 point,Fri Jan 9 02:36:54 2015 UTC,And?
canes,2rntxk,APPaholic47,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:23:18 2015 UTC,I try not to be like this but he's an idiot when it comes to the Canes. I have learned to ignore him. He's perpetually pessimistic about everything no matter what it is
canes,2rntxk,Big_Titles,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks bro. Yeah I noticed that but, I didn't know if you were on board with his shit lol."
canes,2rntxk,orangejuicefan,3,Fri Jan 9 04:52:38 2015 UTC,I like Malone. He knows exactly what he's supposed to do and he does it pretty well. Not to mention he can actually fight which is always nice.
canes,2rntxk,canesfan81,0,Wed Jan 7 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yea, but he's not skilled enough. McClement can fill that role. I'm not sure if Nestrasil will fight but he's big enough so he could as well."
canes,2rntxk,orangejuicefan,2,Wed Jan 7 22:54:05 2015 UTC,Which is why he's on our fourth line..
canes,2rntxk,Hurricane_Viking,2,Wed Jan 7 23:23:26 2015 UTC,You don't want Nesty fighting. You want him on the 3rd line with Nash and Gerbe. Those three should be used to shut down some of the other teams top lines. And if they can each score 15-20 goals a season then thats just a bonus.

canes,2rlar2,Johnny_Mo88,6,Wed Jan 7 03:40:41 2015 UTC,Is it that they're greedy or that they realize we can't a complete a pass to save our fucking lives.

canes,2rlar2,LordZanzabar,3,Wed Jan 7 22:35:42 2015 UTC,Have you seen them pass? Most of the passes are off target. About half of the on-target passes are mishandled. So there ends up being a small chance that a pass will result in the target player having control of the puck. They do need to pass more. In practice. A LOT more. Preferably while both players are moving.

canes,2rbzil,chadmb2003,2,Sun Jan 4 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"He was watching a game from the 200s level.  There were 2 other older men in suits with him.  I was in 222 and he was in 221 suite I think.  After the game he goes ""Hey do you want a puck?"" And he just gave it ti me."
