malelivingspace,3e09k3,r3ttt,10,Mon Jul 20 23:30:30 2015 UTC,My first thought is that your armchair is kind of... oddly central in the living room. Almost like you don't have room for it. If you usually sit there to watch TV then your TV is too far away from your sofa. I'd bring the TV all the way forward and push it over a little into that nook on the right so it's not quite all the way into the corner. Then take out the side tables either side of the sofa and push that further over to the door and you've probably got enough space to put that chair and foot rest on the other side.  And then the space the TV stand was taking up could be filled with some tall storage like a bookcase as that's your work/office area.
malelivingspace,3e09k3,live_wire_,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with you about the chair.

It's so easy for the one room to get cluttered with too much furniture, but will always look like a magazine with just a few, interesting/expensive objects. In addition to the tv and bed, maybe just keep it to a desk, office chair, bureau and plants. Maybe a couch and coffee table, but that's pushing it."

malelivingspace,3e0ypv,FluoCantus,4,Tue Jul 21 11:10:19 2015 UTC,Since your floor is in a grid pattern you should get a comforter that's a grid as well or a solid color. The polkadots clash against the floor and make the room look too busy.  I also feel like your TV is one small floor shake away from slipping off of that table. Are you sure that's secure? Can you find some way to make sure it doesn't fall off the table?

malelivingspace,3e0ypv,woahmanwhereami,2,Tue Jul 21 11:12:13 2015 UTC,The grey bath rug? That would be good. There are a lot of colors you could go with just so long as they don't blend in with the rest of the brown of your room. Since you have a lot of earth tones going on I'd look at going with another one of those or a pastel.

I see what might be a light switch but I don't see an overhead light so i'll assume the switch is something else.  I'd put another lamp in the room to brighten it up more and even out the lighting.  In the corner beside the TV would be good.    Additionally, it looks like you have two closets so depending on how often you use all that closet space, i'd get a reading chair and put it in front of the closet beside the TV and put a reading light beside it.  That will only work if you don't need to access that closet regularly.  As other have mentioned, definitely get a rug for all that floor space.  That's a big space so make it a focal point."

I also cannot mount my TV on the wall,  so I have built a stand out of a piece of live edge I had kicking around. I am not too keen on changing the main dresser, bed or television stand as I built them all by hand and am quite happy with them. Where I am really looking for suggestions is for things such as decor and art or anyway to improve the look of the place without huge drastic changes such as painting. Looking to make the place a little more lively, as I have a lot of open floor in the middle and some blank walls. One thing I am looking for is a way to decorate the wall space above the bed. I am open to any suggestions/hate/ criticism you may have, so please, be honest!"
malelivingspace,3e0ypv,Krakaka1095,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Ever heard of an accent color? If you want to keep it cheap and only change or add decor, I'd recommend:  Start with replacing those curtains that look like burlap and find a new bed quilt that doesn't mirror the other four colors in your room. Keep the quilt style simple, as the parquet on your floor is already quite patterned. Anything colorblock would probably work.  Above your bed, put something with a little depth and color. You can be most liberal with color here. Something cheap from a local art gallery would do the trick. If you can, make sure it's of an organic nature, as you currently don't have anything but straight lines and harsh edges in visible in your space. If you can find anything besides a nature scene, it would really liven the place up and take you a step further from a spartan hunting lodge. Just my two cents, as I don't know what phase of your life you're in, but try to find something framed that isn't a dorm room-style poster.  Put something on either side of your TV, any sort of odd or end that you're proud of, isn't made out of wood, or you have a story about. Color is your friend here, too. Maybe some sort of ceramic dish to throw things like change, keys, or receipts in when you walk in.   I have a lot of respect for the homemade furniture, but it's actually getting washed out by your wooden flooring. To emphasize just how clean and natural your hand-made pieces are, I would say find a colored, but muted, area or throw rug to put smack-dab in the middle of your space. This will make it cozier, quieter when you walk around, and increase the visibility of your excellent furniture.   Finally, you should consider relocating your laundry bag to a different corner of the room. Maybe craigslist around for some floor-standing speakers with a cheap amplifier to put on either side of your TV stand. In my experience, putting furniture flush with the corners of the room makes a space feel busy. It's a weird thing to bring up, but I would also recommend angling your TV screen just a little bit towards the door, so your towering 50"" isn't planar and uninviting to someone walking in.   A few hours on craigslist and a trip or two to Target, and you're going to have a sylvan, but cultured, space that will show off your carpentry for less than $150."

malelivingspace,3dza9o,unicorn_tacos,4,Mon Jul 20 19:12:22 2015 UTC,The drawers behind the closet are actually in the closet. I couldn't figure out where to put them without them taking up space or looking awkward.   You could put the drawers where the mirror is under the window and put a smaller mirror on the closet doors. I don't think that would break up the flow or look odd. It would also free up space in your closet. I personally like to hang all my shirts but that's me. Just a thought but it might not be a necessary fix.

I mean both the furniture and the walls. Furniture is almost all ikea stuff, and I can paint/stain it to whatever I want. Walls will be painted, since they're currently a sickening green.

Here's the floorplan and some ideas I had: http://imgur.com/a/VDTUe  In the first one (picture #2), the viewing angle from the couch is pretty bad, but I'm worried that the second one would end up making the place feel way too tight.  Open to any suggestions on furniture as well, thanks!"
malelivingspace,3dr7ur,beige4ever,3,Sat Jul 18 18:03:27 2015 UTC,You positively need to fit the desk in the living room? Just making sure because it seems like a tight fit with other living room furniture.

That brick wall will look nice with some pictures and a large indoor plant ;) definitely pic #2. get rid of the carpet.  Kitchen is great (is that two microwaves?), but the single lightbulb is a little sad... can it get an upgrade?  Try using the ceiling height for more storage, f.ex. shelfs above doors, herbs rack, that would be great!"

Theyre much better than the stock LCD/Plasma speakers and dont require much change to add to a set up.  But, they really dont sound that great compared to regular speakers and if you have a room/setup like this, you can absolutely wire it for a real 5.1 system (or whatever).  Idk, I like good quality sound but I think sound bars are fine for home theatre. If you want to listen to music, upgrade."

With fitted wardrobes you can make use of all the space floor to ceiling and those odd spaces.  I also got a good deal from the wardrobe fitters as i helped him out with his website :P"

All the furniture is blending in with the carpet and making it look depressing and monotone.   Agreed with /u/diegofuego, a small coffee table would help take your eyes off the coaches too and give the room some life. (throw in candles or books or whatever you guys put on these tables). Throw in a rug under the Coffee Table to define the room a bit more.   Positioning of the two love seats are sort of throwing me off, not sure what it is about it. Would you be better off making an L shape? It makes your dining corner so hidden. The walls look pretty bland. Your artwork looks like you took from an old 90's dentist office, get rid of them if you can. You should probably grab a huge 24x36 poster (Movies/Bands/Maps) or 2 and frame them (cost like $15-20 bucks at target) and hang them up. (MAKE SURE THEY ARE LEVELED).  That random shelf is probably used to hang hats/keys but you're probably better off getting a standing coat rack next to you door. Also, that random chair under that one painting, probably remove that and get a house plant, even put a small table with some picture frames or a plant on it."

If you put the Love seat or sofa in the middle of the room facing the wall, you'll put the walkway from the door behind the sofa instead of in front of the TV. Enhance this TV space with a rug - nothing too bright.   Also realize that this apartment will be very difficult to make look good. It's an econobox, so don't expect too some top-notch catalog ready flat - just get it to where it doesn't look like one heap of beige, I spose."
malelivingspace,3dh4en,live_wire_,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"You have two sofas, that's one too many. Get a single bigger sofa that seats everyone or keep one of these and get some chairs. That would also help your dining table not be so hidden away in the corner.  You really need more colour. Right now everything in the room is light wood, brown or beige. If you own this place you should start with painting/papering the walls and go from there. Else you could just use some more brightly coloured furniture. Bright green sofa anyone? (ok, maybe not that but you get the idea)  Again if you own it, you really should take up that carpet. It looks like there's tiling going from the doorway to the kitchen, much better to have floor tiles in a room than some uninteresting brown carpet."
malelivingspace,3dh4en,HugzMonster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:57:41 2015 UTC,The red floor mat and tiny shelf on the TV side wall look out of place (though I'm not sure if you can remove the shelf if it's considered a permanent fixture of the apartment).  A rug for the floor would be a nice addition.

This may be a bit unconventional - because your bed will be in front of your closet - but it will give you plenty of space in the opposite corner for your desk/stuff area. I would then place a dresser at the bottom of the right wall.  Assuming you don't need to regularly pull anything heavy out of the bottom of your closet, you will still have full access to its contents by reaching over your bed, or with your left knee on the bed."

malelivingspace,3dfhg3,coco_dollar,2,Thu Jul 16 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this comment because it's absolutely critical.  My parents bought a ""leather"" sofa from a once reputable dealer and within a year, it began to flake and peel.  There are many grades of leather, the lowest of which are more ""leather"" than anything else.  Leather sofas are expensive because it takes several full cow hides to make one, plus the time to process, cut, and stitch the hides.  There's no such thing as a $500 leather sofa.  That said, I haven't heard anything bad about West Elms's leather, so it's probably fine, but it's certainly better to check.  Remember, ""bonded"" and ""genuine"" leathers are the lowest grade of leather.  You'll want full grain or top grain leather if you want your investment to last.  The website says it's top grain, but double check.  It can be ""made with top grain leather"" and still contain 99% genuine leather."
malelivingspace,3dfhg3,hexy_bits,3,Thu Jul 16 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"Looks nice but I'm not a fan of leather. If you are then yeah it's cool. In warmer weather if you're hot you will stick to them and get sweaty, and it's a nightmare IMO. So be prepared to have a throw blanket on it to be a barrier.  Look up the company and what type of leather it is, lower end ""leather"" will easily tear and flake. Which LOOKS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  But to be honest it looks generic as hell. You can find a similiar type sofa for a fraction of the price at discount stores and craigslist  The armrest look uncomfortable.  I'm sorry if I'm rude, I'm pretty buzzed and a college student (pretty picky with what I choose)   But I'd say find a colored sofa that fits your living room scheme"

malelivingspace,3dfhg3,doublesecretprobatio,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:30 2015 UTC,there's nothing wrong with a plain/generic sofa.  basic brown leather furniture is very versatile. it's the dark blue suit of furniture; you can make it work with just about anything and it never goes out of style.
malelivingspace,3dfhg3,inoureyes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:16:04 2015 UTC,"I was seriously considering buying this when I was moving a few months back. I was also looking at the Dekalb and Hamilton models, also from West Elm, also in leather. If you have a store nearby, you should totally visit and just sit on it. The store near me only had the fabric version, but was one of the top sofas for comfort from West Elm, in my opinion. Also check to see if there's a West Elm outlet near you as they offer some great deals on catalog return items.  I eventually went with the Dekalb which comes in the premium aniline leather. It has a more velvety feel than traditional leather sofas, which tend to feel more plastic-smooth, and I can really recommend it if you choose to go that route."

malelivingspace,3df89k,smalls631,3,Wed Jul 15 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"OK. So it's very hard to judge how much space you have with no measurements... Also, I am drunk so take this advice with salt.  BUT HERE'S MY ADVICE.   You want to maximize space. So...  If your dresser can't fit in your closet, then try to sell it and get some shelving spots on the sides and back of your closet. (SCOUR CRAIGSLIST). Hell I'd do that anyway. That way you have a 3 wall open shelf space, where you can not only put your clothes, but general items you don't have to have out. And they don't have to be nail in the wall shelves, I got my 5 shelf stand (that fits perfectly in my closet) for 9 bucks on CL. It's a dark espresso color that blends into my dark blue closet color.  In pic 2, you have the window nearly on the ground, but in pic 4 it's higher up on the wall. wat?   Either way that's your life source, don't block that with anything. I'm all about natural light.  You can turn that chimney brick from a nuisance into a focal point. Looks like the designers wanted the focal point to be the center of the room.  Have a wall mounted something (poster, etc.) on each size that ""point"" to the chimney brick.  Little air circulation is hell, get a A/C if you even consider the possibility, if it's stuffy no one's going to want to go in there.   The color yellow might promote the warmth of the room. If it's already on the verge of being too temperature warm, I'd consider painting if not neutralized the yellow to ""cooler"" colors (dark blues, browns, greent, etc. you can do your research). If you can't paint it you can promote other colors with your furniture (bedding, poster, whatevz).   Here's some photos I looked up that might help you   See how the greens and reds ""balance"" the yellow?   Or howdarker colorsbring balance?    bedding (comforter, blankets, pillows, etc.)  artwork (posters, friend's art, anything on walls.)  lamps (great for ""relaxing"" environments)."

I got stuck with the ""loft"" bedroom on the top floor of our apartment/house. It has its own bathroom which is nice, but has an narrow layout. There is also a small part of the wall where the chimney pops out a couple inches...  I have a full size bed, small TV, dressers and a bookcase that I am bringing. There is also a large but narrow closet without doors. I may be able to fit a dresser in there. There are two small ceiling lights and little natural light as the only window is very small and almost on the floor.   Also the walls right now are painted a bright yellow color.
