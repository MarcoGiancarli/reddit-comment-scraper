I really want to believe that roof scoop is functional. Like actual air diverted into the engine space.  Edit: Just clicked the bobforstner link. Yup, it's a Cayman. Looks like most of the work has gone into replacing every panel from the door back and the engine (hopefully). 231 MPH top speed though? really? I'd like to see dyno charts."

I'd stay away, it's really not worth that much anyways. You can pick up a good running one that's been maintained cheaply and save a lot of time/irritation. Possibly even money.  And an early boxster is a far from an investment Porsche as I can think of this side of a Cayenne."

That car has an engine that is known to have problems with the IMS bearing, especially with cars that have not been driven a lot.  If you do decide to buy it, plan to upgrade the IMS bearing with I'm guessing would cost a few grand.  In any case, you should definitely have a PMI inspection done by a Porsche dealer or independent Porsche mechanic.  If it's that old and has been driven that little, who knows what else is wrong with it."

A co-worker of mine inherited a black one from his grandfather. That 944 hasn't been driven since at least 2006. It's rusted like the car has been sitting in a pool of water.

Porsche,3e002b,Tissue285,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:28 2015 UTC,South Beach is largely because of drugs. Central Florida would be north east retirees most likely. Also a lot of income inequality with large corporations headquartered in downtown Orlando. There are a lot of rich people and a lot of poor people  Ninja edit: these are just my rambling thoughts so take it with a grain of salt

Porsche,3dz28w,stealthboy,6,Mon Jul 20 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, and the 991.1 may be a real collector if they do move to all turbo engines. I imagine GT3 could stay NA in the future but might be a good time to get a Carrera S or GTS with a stick."
Porsche,3dz28w,ProjectVroom,3,Mon Jul 20 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"Everybody always thinks the ""current car"" is better until the next generation comes out.

And people generally consider the 997.2 to be the better looking car."
Porsche,3dz28w,JacksterTO,5,Mon Jul 20 23:19:10 2015 UTC,I'm definitely more of a fan of the 997.1.  I think they messed up the taillights.  The angled bit gets me. http://i.imgur.com/AVODr7J.jpg

Porsche,3dz28w,Hoffmeisterfan,5,Mon Jul 20 23:32:06 2015 UTC,I think each of the rear light lenses are covered with camo.  They want to hide the new 3D effect light as seen in the new Macan.  http://i.imgur.com/ldtYEOD.jpg

Honestly.  I can't understand why every other company on the planet can lobby governments for the laws they want passed, yet auto manufacturers can't even slow down the oppressive government regulations affecting their products.  Give the turbos to the hippies and the fools that think the average Porsche owner gives a shit about fuel efficiency.  I want a normally aspirated engine."
Porsche,3dz28w,moneyshift,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"Well turbos will make more power than an NA engine will. Also, owners do care about fuel efficiency. You're telling me you would not mind driving a block and then having to refuel?"
Porsche,3dz28w,Porsche_Curves,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"Who cares about more power?  Like anyone can realistically use half the power these cars have on the street (legally) as it is.  Plus, while Porsche is probably the least offensive in this regard, the answer to performance (and economy, ironically) is weight reduction -- not turbos.  This is one of the many reasons why BMWs don't do it for me anymore.  They're all 4000 lb porkers that use turbos to create the horsepower they need to match performance numbers they could otherwise meet with normally aspirated engines if their engineers could even spell ""weight reduction"".  Spare me the exaggerations about fuel economy.  There's nothing wrong with the fuel economy or emissions numbers of any engine produced in the last 30 years.  The catalytic converter, oxygen sensors and computer-controlled closed loop mixture and timing control took care of that in the mid 80's.  The problem is liberals trying to turn the internal combustion engine into an electric motor.  I have nothing against electrics / hybrids or those that wish to drive them, but I don't want one in my garage."

The 993 is definitely still up there, because it's recognized as the ""last of an era"".  I think the next ""last of an era"" might be the current 991 since you can still get manual and N/A engine.  I personally see the 993 as the culmination of all that was the previous 911 history.  It's air-cooled, it's still small, yet it had been refined.  I see the 991 as the culmination of what started with the 996 and into the 997, so it also seems like the ultimate refinement.  I fear the 991.2 (or 992) will start another iteration of eventual refinement (no doubt ending in hybrid electric engines and PDK only)."
Porsche,3dvalm,stealthboy,2,Sun Jul 19 23:05:01 2015 UTC,"I was in the market recently but went a different route, but I kept a close eye on the market for a while....  The 996TT, i think, has bottomed out except for a few super high mileage cars. They really seem to hover around the 38-42k USD mark for good condition cars, right there in the middle of the bell curve. I would expect that number to begin to shift upwards slightly as the cars begin getting to the point that regular maintenance has to be done.  I've seen several people mention the C4S as being even more desirable than the TT, but I don't know if I buy that. They do still command a premium though.  Having looked at the base model, I'm still not convinced that they have bottomed out yet. Since they did make so many of them, I think there are going to always be some poorly maintained examples bringing the price of quality cars down below where they possibly should be.  But of course, that really is just a WAG."
Porsche,3dvalm,huntsvillian,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:19 2015 UTC,996 has a stigma with the IMS and the headlights. The base interior is also rather weak for a Porsche whereas the 993 still has that classic feel to it. 996/986 have no value to non-ethusiasts as well.

Great condition, ran strong and still took it on 700 mile road trips monthly. I had it listed for over 10 months before someone was willing to pay over 14K for it.   It was a lot of fun to drive when I could actually open it up. But without phone integration, modern electronics and more comfortable seats, etc, it just wasn't the daily driver for me any longer. I had a 986 S too. That was fun, but a similar situation.  I'm not so sure the price will really go up. For used 911s, everyone is about the 993s and maybe the PDK 997s. I can't see the 996 gaining in value."
Porsche,3dvalm,996_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"A 996 Turbo is currently the best possible investment you can make in a Porsche right now. Forget the Carerras, and the GT3s - get a nice X50 Turbo model - and drive it.  These cars are going to go through the roof in 5 years time.  It's possible the Carerras will see a rebound too - but nothing like what the Turbo is going to do.  In NZ right now, the only model of Turbo which can be found for less than $140K is the 996 Turbo - and they're down to $55K. That is insanely cheap for what is basically 2/3rds of a 959 in a better body shell.  So what are you waiting for - start looking right now! I am selling my race car (which I have made a tidy profit on) and buying a Black-on-Black 996 TT with the X50 power upgrade, in manual. I do not care about the mileage - only the maintainence records."

It is not an investment by any stretch of the imagination as it is going to cost far, far, FAR more in maintenance over the next 20 years than it is going to return on appreciation. Not saying it isn't a great car for the price, it's a great ""bang for your buck"" car. But not a financial investment."

Porsche,3dsgtb,JettaGLi16v,3,Sun Jul 19 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"I've found that I am constantly polishing or waxing the car to keep those tiny surface scratches in the clear coat from showing.   You should upgrade your washing process if you find you're constantly getting surface scratches like that.  Do you use two buckets?  Do you use microfiber wash mitts?  How do you dry the car?  Do you ever wipe the car with a dry towel on a dry surface?  (hint:  don't do that.)  I consider rock chips a normal part of a car.  It means you drive it.  Porsches are meant to be driven!    As for the black color, yes, it shows dirt better than other colors.  It's certainly a job you signed up for when you chose black.    And in the end, remember this quote: ""Our cars are meant to be driven. Not polished."" -Ferry Porsche"
Porsche,3dsgtb,stealthboy,3,Sun Jul 19 11:22:07 2015 UTC,"I guess I can't have both, a spotless car and a daily driver. I definitely bought it to drive and have put 10k miles on it since January. I do use the 2 bucket process and a microfiber wash mitt. It's not swirl marks from washing, just tiny little scratches everywhere when something brushed across it (the kind you have to see in just the right light). At least I managed to train my wife to shut the door using the door handle instead of putting a giant palm print on the door :-)"
Porsche,3dsgtb,Shivatron,3,Sun Jul 19 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this drives me crazy as well.  I'm never buying a black car again.  That said:   How you wash is important.  You're using a two-bucket method which is a good start.  I'll also assume you're using a high quality mitt and a soap with good lubricity.  You've made sure that the car is rinsed before you begin washing and that you're using the absolute lightest pressure possible with the mitt.  You also have good ""mitt discipline"" (ie. you're not washing your wheels/tires/wheelwells with the mitt and then touching the paint). Drying.  Air drying with, say, a Metro Blaster is best -- but you need to be careful to ""follow"" the air with a microfiber or you'll get water spots.  Also, never touch the car with a dry towel; make sure you spray quick detailer on any towels that are going to touch the car.  Do not apply pressure while drying.  Do not ""swipe"" the car while drying.  Pat the car gently and ""blot"" the water off.  Towels should be soft -- old microfiber gets crunchy with age, especially if you run them through the dryer. LSPs.  Your choice of wax/sealant can greatly affect the appearance of swirls/holograms/&c.  I've found traditional carnauba waxes to be very unforgiving in that if you rub them the wrong way, especially when warm, you can leave a swirl mark.  Modern polymer sealants (especially semi-permanent coatings like CQuartz/Opti-coat) are much more durable and don't seem to mar as easily.  Dust.  The car is going to get dusty from driving it.  The most important thing is to NEVER touch the dust.  A California Car Duster might as well be called a California Car Scratcher.  Do you use a car cover?  If so, NEVER cover a car that is even slightly dusty (ie. a car that has not just been washed).  Live with the dust until you can wash it.  Chips.  I personally think that the best advice here is to get a clear bra.  Products like Xpel Ultimate will also heal minor scratches/swirls on their own. Scratches/swirls.  If you follow all of the above advice, the car should really not scratch or swirl, unless someone rubs up against it.  If the whole car looks swirled on a regular basis, it's most likely you're introducing the swirls while drying.  I can't emphasize enough how careful you need to be while drying if you want to avoid swirls. If none of the above works for you, then /u/comet997 has the best alternate advice: learn to live with it.  Personally, it's hard for me to do this -- I enjoy looking at a clean car.  But if you're one of the people who can ignore it, more power to you.   Hope this helps."
Porsche,3dsgtb,Shivatron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Also, not specifically related to black P-cars, but since I'm on a roll:   Drying, part II.  If you're anal like me, you will notice that like a toddler, the car tends to drool after drying.  You'll see trails of water running down the car from all the nooks and crannies -- the mirror housing, the headlights, the bumper turn indicators, the taillights, the hood crest, the door handles, and on GT3s, the wing.  I blow these out with an air dryer before drying the car.  I also tie little ""pigtails"" out of microfiber around the base of the mirrors since it seems impossible to get all of the water out of those. Drying, part III.  Maybe the most maddening thing is having a perfectly clean car and then rolling it 3 feet and having all of the rusty water flow out of the vents in the brake rotors and coat the freshly-cleaned wheels.  Hit the brake rotors with an air dryer and you can eliminate most (but probably not all) of this.  Or just buy PCCBs."

You can see the carbon weave through the paint on the Fezza, and all the green joining goop the panels are connected with. There is NOTHING in that car which does not need to be there.  The 959, in comparison, is a big, fat pig, loaded down with all sorts of stuff you don't need to go fast, and which actually slows you down.  And if you really like the 959, then go out and buy a super cheap 996 Turbo, because that's 2/3rds of a 959, with a stronger body shell. It's the supercar bargain of the century!"

There's a good chance that they'll mess it up because they don't work on cars like ours very often. I would either schedule something with your local dealership or an independent mechanic who specializes in Porsches.   While you can certainly do the oil change yourself, it doesn't sound like you particularly want to. But it is definitely an option if you want to get your hands dirty."
Porsche,3dmp50,Rawrr_dinosaurs,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:20 2015 UTC,This is probably the best advice. You can usually find an independent shop that works on German cars and will be more than competent. The dealer is a sure bet but will probably cost you $80 more then getting it done at an independent shop. I personally change my own but in the end it comes down to what you are comfortable with and what your wallet can tolerate.

Porsche,3dmp50,MyPasswordIsNotTacos,7,Sat Jul 18 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Do it yourself! I'm sure you can find a video on YouTube to tell you exactly how to do it for your specific model and engine, but the process is pretty universal:   Take off the oil cap. Do this first so you know you still need to add oil.  get the car up on jack stands,   drain old oil,   remove old filter (making sure the old gasket comes off with it!) , and make sure the area the gasket comes into contact with on the engine is clean. If it isn't, wipe the dirt outwards with a cloth. (You don't want dirt in your new oil, do you?)   wipe some oil on the new filter's gasket, (old oil or new oil, it doesn't really matter, you just want some on there)  put on the new filter ( tighten it about half a turn past snug)  put the plug back in the drain hole and tighten it (don't superman it, but don't just leave it in there finger tight either.)  (You may need a new crush washer for your plug, depends on your model)   Add  the right amount of oil specified in your car's manual. (Make sure you get the right weight and specification for your car! I'd recommend Mobil 1 full synthetic, since it meets all non-diesel standards that I'm aware of, and Mobil makes a filter specifically for that oil's long life. You can use synthetic in a car that doesn't require it, but God help you if you go the other way. That said, I can't imagine any Porsche being OK with conventional oil)  replace the oil cap as soon as you're done putting the oil in, not only to make sure you don't forget, but to show that oil has been added so you don't double-oil. (Bad things happen!) double check under the car that both the filter and plug are on and tight.  Start the car. Wait to make sure the check oil/oil pressure light goes off. Look under the car and make sure it's not leaking oil everywhere. It would be obvious. Gushing. If it is, shut it off and fix the problem (usually the old filter gasket not coming off. I told you to check that!)  Turn off the car, grab the dipstick, wipe it off, stick it all the way back down the hole, and take it back out again. Check that your oil is in the safe area. (There could be two notches, or two dots, sometimes a cross hatched area. It should be in that area. Some say ""safe"" on them.) if it shows low, you didn't add enough or it's leaking out somewhere. Make sure it's not leaking and add a little bit more at a time until it's in the middle of the safe zone. If there's too much oil, you may have to drain some out. As long as you put the amount the manual says to in, you shouldn't have a problem. Make sure you read the right entry for your engine! (Some modern cars like BMWs have electronic oil level sensors and no physical dipstick. Check your manual if you can't find it.)  Now you can get the car off your jack stands, and take a shower. First timers usually get a little greasy. Hint from an oil shop veteran: dawn dish soap takes that crap right off.  Now that you're all clean, go for a drive! Or have a beer.  Doing your own work is astoundingly cheaper. My corvette costs $120 per oil change at the shop I used to work at... Never even bothered to get a quote from the dealership. But I can do it myself in half an hour and for less than $50. The hardest part of the whole job is messing with the jack and stands.  Doing your own maintenance is also very rewarding, and you'll have more of a sense of the health of your car. You can look around while you're under there and make sure everything's in good condition, spot leaks before they cause trouble, and get a sense of all the engineering that went into the machine. You'll start to understand not just what the car is doing, but which part does it, how, and why it does it that way. It honestly can make you a better driver to know that stuff."

Porsche,3dmp50,CrowbarOfEmbriage,2,Fri Jul 17 21:58:40 2015 UTC,This is my go to for when I'm not entirely sure of working on something. The vast majority of DIY car people can be paid in either booze or food. Everybody wins. If you don't know anyone that's really into working on cars themselves local PCA or SCCA groups will likely have someone willing to help you out.
Porsche,3dmp50,MyPasswordIsNotTacos,2,Sat Jul 18 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"A couple of vehicle specific corrections to this in case this guy takes the instructions to heart and tries this:   remove old filter (making sure the old gasket comes off with it!)   The Boxster (and all modern Porsches) has a cartridge style oil filter, so the o-ring will come off with the oil filter housing. It's underneath the car, behind bank 2, it fucking sucks to get to, and it's messy, especially with hot oil.   wipe some oil on the new filter's gasket, (old oil or new oil, it doesn't really matter, you just want some on there)   Replace the sealing o-ring   put on the new filter ( tighten it about half a turn past snug)   Don't do this, it will break the housing. The torque spec for the housing is 25 N·m (19 lb·ft)   put the plug back in the drain hole and tighten it (don't superman it, but don't just leave it in there finger tight either.)   Replace the crush washer. The torque spec for the drain plug is 50 N·m (37 lb·ft)   Add the right amount of oil specified in your car's manual.   I always start with 8 liters, then top it up from there. I think the manual specifies what oils are approved, look for Porsche A40 spec on the oil you buy. 0W-40 is standard, but 5W-40 and 5W-50 are also acceptable   Turn off the car, grab the dipstick ...  (Some modern cars like BMWs have electronic oil level sensors and no physical dipstick. Check your manual if you can't find it.)   That's the case for this car. The oil level can be checked via the instrument cluster after it reaches operating temperature, somewhere around 180° F or 80° C. Key on engine off, wait one minute and the oil level should display. It may be a bit finicky but it works most of the time. The difference between min and max is something around 1.7L, so each of the 4 segments is like 0.425 L."
Porsche,3dmp50,DayDreamingDriver,2,Sat Jul 18 07:39:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I knew I would be off on at least one or two things.  But don't let this dissuade you, OP! The steps are the same, the method for the filter change is just slightly different.   The crush washer you'll have to buy from the auto parts store, but the o-ring should come in the box with the filter. Sometimes they come with 3 or 4 sizes. Which one to use will be obvious. (Also check the old filter body itself to make sure that a second one isn't used on there, but I don't know many cars that use a second o-ring.)  You can use a toothpick to get the old ring off, or run your fingers around the circumference of the rim so you kind of pinch it."
Porsche,3dmp50,IAMAgentlemanrly,2,Sat Jul 18 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think you can do it. If you have at the least, jack stands to get underneath. If not then I'd go to a shop for that."

Porsche,3dmp50,WarriorsComeOut2Play,0,Fri Jul 17 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"The 944 has hydraulic valve lifters that work best with thick 20w-50 oil.  Synthetic 20w-50 is $10 a quart pretty hard to find.  If you have never used that oil weight in your car, try it for your next oil change and you should notice a substantial power increase of about 10% over 30 or 40 weight oil.  Oil weight makes a big difference with Porsches of this era."

Porsche,3disgj,phamtq,3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why do Porsche dealers stereotypically treat people like shit when they come to look? We did and were approached by a salesman but told hime we weren't planning to buy for another 1-3 years after we pay off our other cars. The only words he said to us were ""Oh, well we don't take old cars as trade-ins"" (we were in my '97 M3). I get not wanting to waste time on people who will never buy one, but the local dealership lost all future business from us which kind of sucks for them, since we're very fortunate to have careers at a young age which allows us to justify buying premium cars. It's an enthusiast brand! Maybe the local dealer is so used to their customers being 60 years old and wearing either golf clothing or a suit. It was the dude at the front desk who was nice enough to ""warn"" us to never buy a car there by assuming we were a waste of time.   Also that is a hell of a view :D My view at home today is the underside of my M3 :P"

Porsche,3disgj,e30eric,7,Thu Jul 16 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"That's probably very dealer dependent - the Porsche dealer that I bought my Cayman S from was very friendly and accommodating, despite me not being in the standard Porsche demographic (I was 23 at the time). It's part of the reason I ended up buying the car. By comparison the Subaru dealers (for the WRX/STi and BRZ) treated me like shit, generally didn't trust that I was genuinely interested in the cars, and wouldn't let me test drive anything."
Porsche,3disgj,vicelordjohn,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:09 2015 UTC,That's funny you say that.  I currently have a 2015 Scion frs. I was planning on a brz/maybe a sti. When to the Subaru dealership has the worst experience of any dealership I've ever had.  Left and bought a frs that day.
Porsche,3disgj,e30eric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:57 2015 UTC,That's what we were looking at (981 Cayman S). I got the same sort of attitude once at the local BMW dealership while walking to the parts counter through the showroom during renovations -- so I probably unfairly assumed most high end dealerships have their nose up in the air.   The dealership we bought my wife's Mini from was friendly but completely inept -- ironically the absolute easiest and smoothest buying experience was the '15 Tacoma. They even gave us beer...

The second time I visited a dealership was to get keys programmed for my 996. They were more than accommodating for my waiting time. Coffee, breakfast (egg bacon cheese on croissant), and juice.

Porsche,3disgj,e30eric,2,Thu Jul 16 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but it's enough of a reason to not buy from them. I'm patient and already have a fun car to hold me over if I have to wait to find the right car :)"

I can't comment on the 991s, but as a 2010 997 owner, sometimes it feels a bit heavy. Just the way the steering wheel and gas pedal are.. the Cayman felt snappier. Or maybe it's the grass is greener kind of feeling"
Porsche,3dl80s,Abominati0n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:12 2015 UTC,"A Cayman GTS is going to be way out of my budget with the options I want. I can get a new fairly loaded 2014 Cayman S (minus 10 hp, not a big deal) and save close to $12k off, or get a 2015 Cayman GTS and pay $77k with the options I want. I could wait until the fall/winter or early next year and save on a left over 2015 when 2016s start coming in. Plus, no sunroof in the Cayman, which is kinda an important option to me. Thats why I am opting towards a 991. Hoping a Boxster GTS near me gets a big discount and then add that to the list."
Porsche,3dl80s,Abominati0n,2,Fri Jul 17 13:11:58 2015 UTC,cool then. good luck on whatever you get and hope you enjoy it
Porsche,3dl80s,dutch86,3,Fri Jul 17 14:45:34 2015 UTC,"2 would be my choice, though I really hate black exteriors.  I would get a vinyl wrap to an interesting color like sapphire blue or midnight purple.  Keep in mind though that the Cayman S is not the best daily driver.  It is a loud car inside, more of a weekend car, while the 911 is much quieter on the inside for some reason, much more comfortable for commuting and long trips.  Theres also an even older 997 Turbo that you can definitely find for this price."
Porsche,3dl80s,mikab007,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"Re: the turbo, I like where your head is at. Plus depreciation will be minimal. The car would be a second car/summer car. I have a 2014 Fusion Titanium AWD that is my daily driver."
Porsche,3dl80s,Lev88,2,Fri Jul 17 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely go turbo then, it will be much more of an investment, way less depreciation and it'll be more fun too.  They tend to be very reliable too."
Porsche,3dl80s,Philys411,3,Sat Jul 18 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"If the sunroof is an important option to you, have you looked at either a targa or a convertible?   To answer your original question, of those options, I'd go #3, but if you can find an S version of the same car, that would be even better."
Porsche,3dl80s,Denyborg,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would love a 2012 997 C4S Targa. There is one near me but its macadamia/tan. A lowsy color combo to me. If number 3 were an S, I don't think I'd be posting. I'd just buy it. The only thing is, there are ZERO 991 Carrera S 7 speed manuals in the whole country in the low-mid $70k range. They are all $80k+. Don't get why theres so many PDKs in my price range, considering PDK is like a $3k option. Maybe the purists agree that a manual is much more apprealing than the ""but it shifts faster..."" PDK..."

It is, after all, 2/3rds of a 959, in a body shell far superior to the 959.  Yes, they made quite a lot of them, but that just means there's a huge glut of them right now. You wait - in 5 years time, these cars are going to double, and triple in value.  And in the meantime, you have an awesome daily driver.  If you buy a Porsche and don't drive it, you are an idiot.  Worthwhile noting, that only Americans care about low mileage cars. The rest of the world understands that high mileage is a good sign, if it comes with all the right maintenance records.  A well maintained 100K car is far superior to a 10K car."

Porsche,3dh2cp,borisf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"I have the multifunction steering wheel and it's a godsend for a car that you commute a lot in. You can do pretty much everything from the wheel. That said, the paddles are nicer than the MF buttons when you are doing some sporty driving. Porsche has since rectified this and the next generation cars appear to come with a MF wheel with paddles.  PASM = wish I had it. My dad has a 981 Boxster S on 20's with PASM, I have a 981 Cayman on 19's without PASM. His car rides better than mine. I've heard a lot of folks say that PASM feels stiffer than non-PASM; I'd disagree. Get a car with PASM if you can, although if you're just commuting 8 miles, it's not a must-have.  Options are always hit and miss with Porsche cars, because you'll have what you feel you need, and then there's cars that are actually on the market. Since so many Porsches are custom ordered, it's hard to find one with exactly what you want. When you do find one that is a close match, JUMP ON IT.  Also, CPO cars > used cars. A used Porsche with a PPI can be a great car, but you'll have more peace of mind with a CPO. Not a huge issue though. These are quite reliable cars, but they are expensive to fix if something does go south."

Porsche,3dh2cp,ShinShinGogetsuko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback!  I hear you on repair costs. I'm hoping to get by that by getting a relatively new car (2013+) with low miles to take advantage of the remaining factory warranty. I'm hoping that doing an independent PPI will help weed out cars that have been abused.  Not completely against CPO but I'm on the fence as to whether any fixes during additional warranty time will pencil out to be more than the premium of the CPO upfront.
Porsche,3dh2cp,vicelordjohn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"I bought cpo because cpo. PASM is killer, sport chrono is a MUST especially on a pdk car (I wouldn't even consider one without it), and I've driven paddles and no paddles, IMO the sport steering wheel is another must. I don't have steering wheel controls on my 991 and never wished I did... I have them on my vw and always forget and use the stereo controls on the dash. Also, drive and entry is killer.

The amount of fun of 1 Singer is greater than 1 911 Turbo but the accumulated fun from the 4 911 Turbos is greater than the 1 Singer.

Porsche,3d7s9b,kertong,6,Tue Jul 14 04:29:10 2015 UTC,"Some background / thoughts and questions:   Found this one-owner C4S with 65k miles.  Service records and books, bone stock and unmolested, no accidents etc, for $35.9k.  Jumped on it after test driving it thoroughly.    Had a couple nicks on the front and rear bumpers, but for an 11 year old car I'd say it is consistent with age if not better. Wow!  I had a '99 c2 cab about 7 years ago and this is a totally different beast.  Body feels stiffer (c4s doesn't creak going up my driveway surprisingly, whereas the c2 cab did, and even a 2015 corvette stingray creaked and popped quite a bit). Compared to the c2 cab, and always having been in a RWD car, I had concerns of steering feel being numbed, and the car feeling heavier and slower due to the extra AWD equipment.  I was totally wrong - the steering feels meatier / heavier but is just as lively, and the only time I notice the extra weight is in the front - which actually helps the front feel more planted (doesn't wander/bob the way the c2 did).  Almost gives the car a mid-engined feel which may be a con for somebody who loves the rear-engined speedboat sensation of the c2. while we're on the topic of AWD/RWD - driving home in the C4S today, there was a reasonably tight sweeper where I rolled onto the gas a little bit pre-apex.  I could've sworn I felt the front wheels grab, plant, and pull the front of the car through the turn as the whole body rotated.  Never felt something like this before - must be the AWD?  or is it all in my head (placebo)? No PSE :( any exhaust you guys could recommend? What's the best way to get bluetooth streaming audio in?  No navigation on this car. My brakes squeal like CRAZY!  So loud I can hear it with the windows up and music on.  Just a high pitched squeal when lightly braking to stop only - seems to go away for a bit after a few hard 60mph-10mph stops, but comes back soon after.  Seems worse when cold. Shifter effort is high!  Wondering if the previous owner had a short shifter in there - shifts are sharp, notchy, firm, and short.  Don't remember the c2 cab's shifter being this positive and click-y, takes a bit of effort to get out of gear and push it into gear as well.  Not hugely so, but enough to make me wonder. Overall - fantastic car.  For $36k, imo, it is an amazing bargain!!  I know about the IMS/RMS issues, and when getting a new clutch down the line (still on the original), will be having the LN engineering IMS bearing put in place."

Porsche,3d7s9b,s2jcpete,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can answer the streaming audio as I just dealt with it on my 04 996 a few months ago.  Long story short, the Bose fiber MOST ring is a complete pain and you can't just change out the head on that sucker, at least not without replacing the amp in the frunk and running some new wires.  I was quoted in the thousands, though it included new speakers.  I however decided to skip all of that and go for the simplest solution I could find.  I was concerned about using a FM modulator but it plugs straight into the antenna and I have yet to have any bleed through, and is easy as hell to install.  They have a bluetooth one as well, which I tried first but hated how long it took to pair up and just became a hassle when going to the store or something.  If you have any questions about finding a switched 12v line (the stereo does not use a switched line) let me know!"
Porsche,3d7s9b,zeporscheguy,3,Tue Jul 14 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Just chiming in to say I had an XJ8 with the same radio setup and this came recommended to me as the best solution as well.

Yeah, heard about the pains the fiber optic BOSE units can cause. :(  That iSimple kit looks perfect though, I'd go the bluetooth route myself.  How was installation, were ou able to do it yourself?  When you say it too a long time to pair up, was it due to just long bluetooth auto-connect times, or do you actually have to use an app or manually intervene to get it to pair and connect?"
Porsche,3d7s9b,Alcohawk_H60,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe it was my phone, it just seemed to be a bit finicky so I swapped it for the line in.  No native app needed to do the pairing.  I did the install myself and it is pretty easy, perhaps an hour or so.  You will need:   Keys to remove the stereo Metra Antenna Adapter Any kind of a multi-meter to figure out which line is 12v   Pulling the stereo out was a pain, they keys are kind of awkward but they do work you just gotta keep at it.  Its like trying to thread a needle that you can't really see, at least thats how it was with my stereo.  Once the stereo was out, I unplugged everything, pulled out the cubby hole below it.. it literally just yanks out. I then hit eject on each of the cd holder trays, and if you grab all 4 at once and pull towards you it pops out as well.  There is a switched power supply in that area below the stereo, none of the wiring to the stereo has a switched 12v line. For me mine was a 4 hole molex plug that wasn't plugged into anything so I spliced in there."

Cost $500 plus another $250 installed. Regarding IMS, keep the RPMs over 2500 but likely, you won't have an issue. Don't slog along at 45mph in 6th gear. Keep them RPMs up.

Porsche,3d7b03,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:42:41 2015 UTC,That would be a wing. The spoiler is below the wing.

Porsche,3d7b03,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:25 2015 UTC,It would be a wing. It has an underside that is fed from the front.
Porsche,3d7b03,fashoom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:49 2015 UTC,"The 991 Turbo owners' manual also calls it a spoiler, and suggests that its job is reducing lift / improving stability (not producing downforce).

Porsche,3d9ldi,911ducktail,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. So I should remove the housing and drill the holes on the back?

Most helpful is describing the car as a ""grown-up Miata"". It helps those of us who still have to conceive the experience in our imaginations. The coolest thing is that you found an alternative expression for TL;DR. Yeah, I know, that is not related to the car."
Porsche,3d70k6,helmet_newton,3,Tue Jul 14 09:46:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I've gotten to the point where I just assume people know what I'm talking about with the tires. But yeah, I really liked ""grownup Miata"".  Most people have driven a Miata by now, I'd think... so there's a good frame of reference.   Nice little roadster, fun to drive, easily tossable.... but more power, more grip, a top that you don't have to get out or dislocate a shoulder trying to reach back to grab, and a suspension that's compliant enough that you can drive it down a crappy SC/GA highway without ending up with your back feeling like you just fell down a mountain.... and I could NEVER do that in my Miata.  Can barely do it in my FRS."
Porsche,3d70k6,schultzM,2,Tue Jul 14 10:21:13 2015 UTC,Could you please elaborate on two things: (1) body roll: Did you say the Boxster allowed a little roll? (2) FRS: You have a Scion FRS; right? Is that not a fun car? Thanks.
Porsche,3d70k6,helmet_newton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"1) The Boxster rolls like a dinghy caught in a thunderstorm :)  Soft suspension, lots of travel.... but they make it handle well.  It seems like it's a lot better suited for open track than AutoX.  In a slalom where it's transitioning back and forth, the roll is really pronounced.  But in a sweeper, like what you'd encounter on a normal road course, it just takes a set and goes.  2) Yeah I have a Scion FRS.  It's a very fun car.  But even my fairly stock one (front swaybar and TRD springs) feels bumpy driving around town compared to the Boxster (see #1).  As far as usable powerband, the FRS and Boxster are both rated at 200hp, but the Boxster has way more usable torque without the giant dip in the torque curve.  Then again, my FRS gets 30+mpg usually, so I can be happy with that :D"
Porsche,3d70k6,schultzM,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"I started the summer looking for a Miata.  I wanted a Mazdaspeed turbo, or one that could warrant the investment of a supercharger.  I found that I just couldn't fit into one happily.  So, I bought a 944.  Now, I, too, am hooked.  Saving aggressively for a Cayman S (need 24 months to build $30K).  I really don't want a Boxster from the aesthetics and Camry-like handling perspectives.  I know the new ones are far nicer.  I guess that I just prefer coupes.  I'd rather a 911 coupe than a cabrio, as well.  I am very interested in the FR-S/BRZ platform.  They are very close to a 944 in so many ways.  But, if I am going to spend $25K, I'd rather have a Cayman, i think."

Next time Kia guy gives you shit, ask him how much the Kia costs, then tell him how much your Porsche costs and see jaws drop.   Also learn the difference between cheap and inexpensive. Your Porsche is a fine, inexpensive car, my first car bought new was a Dodge Neon, it was a cheaply built piece of shit. Fun? Sure, but it was a piece of shit.

Porsche,3d2a70,2thDKer,3,Sun Jul 12 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"I believe the 997 Sport Chrono was required for the Sport mode as well as Sport Plus for PDKs which would imply some engine response changes even on a manual and the switch to harder rev limiter.  You'll also get Sport mode PASM on PASM equipped cars and PSM adjustments to allow for more slip angle and the PSM Standby mode which turns it off entirely until you kick in ABS on both front wheels.   Something to consider, you can apply the Sport Chrono software after the fact on 997s, there was an official software package produced.  You just don't get the clock.  The clock can also be a cause for consternation at some track days as their insurance frequently doesn't permit timing.

Porsche,3d25fw,NeedsMoreTorque,3,Sun Jul 12 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"For me maintenance cost have been minimum, oil change and routine items. All else covered by the dealer. They do cover pretty much everything. I drive the car every day and have no regrets. Would buy it again. Lots of fun with the PDK and the top down. Your best option to get a higher than normal discount is to find a demo car. The drawback is that you do not choose the configuration but you could get a car that has taken a significant hit below MSRP. A build to order car may get a low single digit discount. Tires are 300/400 each so the 2K estimate is about right. I would also get an extended Porsche warranty if you are planning to put lots of miles on it. The two or three service visits were related to electronics gremlins and were around 1,500 to 2,000 each but was all covered by warranty (mostly labor). The last one was related to the auto start/stop and after a week of trial and error Porsche agree to a battery replacement and that was the magic fix. The overall advice is do not drive the car without a warranty if you are concerned with maintenance cost and do take it to the Porsche dealer."

Porsche,3d25fw,mikab007,2,Mon Jul 13 13:04:34 2015 UTC,"Here's to (hopefully) becoming one of us!   So far none yet, I've only had mine for 2 months. But here's what you can expect. These are rough number so treat them accordingly. 10,000mi/1yr - Oil and filter (~$250-300).  20,000mi/2yrs - Brake fluid, air filters (~$500-600). 40,000mi/4yrs - Spark plugs, serpentine belt (depending on which manual you read, I've seen conflicting answers) (Possibly over $1k). 120,000mi/12yrs - PDK gear fluid and clutch fluid (?? - No clue). I've always done the maintenance on my own vehicles and this will be no exception. If you have the space, tools and knowledge it'll save you a load of money.  $300 oil change?  Thanks but no. I've already done one at 3k miles to send the oil from break-in off for testing at Blackstone and it wasn't too bad. Not expecting too much hassle on the plugs, belts or much else. Also helps knowing who to schmooze with to get service manual pages. If you take one piece of advice from me in this post, do not get the infotainment package unless you reeeeeally want navigation. With it you get nav, satellite/hd radio, Bose audio and a 40gb hard drive to store music. The problem is, it's four grand!! I couldn't justify that when I A.) can use google maps on my phone for free, and B.) all my music is on spotify. You can also get the Bose audio as a standalone for $720 which is what I did instead. Now you do lose bluetooth music streaming with not having the PCM, but for $40 I bought a bluetooth receiver that goes in my glove box and works just as well.  Again, unless you really like in car nav, huge waste of money in my opinion. Another option to avoid in my book is the 389-way power seats. I went with the standard 2-way electric and they're fantastic.  They're lighter, probably more reliable in the long run, and again, don't cost, about four grand!!  Nixing those two basically equates to ceramic brakes. Or every other performance option with cash to spare. Choice seemed clear to me. As for the frilly options, ventilated seats rock, and in the GTS the black brushed aluminum interior is sexy. I bought new and got 5% off of MSRP without even negotiating through the European delivery option (which is free btw). Unfortunately some major unexpected changes happened with work and even though I cancelled going to Germany, my good guy salesman still gave me the discount (THANK YOU GRAND RAPIDS PORSCHE!)   I know I was a bit long winded but I hope this helps. I seriously could not be any happier with how things turned out and I think if you decide to go with a Cayman - new or used - you will not be disappointed"

Porsche,3d25fw,dodecahlicious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's an annoyance, I'll admit it, not having native bluetooth streaming from the head unit (I think it's a scam, even without PCM you still can make calls via bluetooth, so it's not like the receiver isn't there... adjusts tin-foil hat), but it's not an annoyance I want to spend 4k to fix. And in all honesty the bluetooth receiver works fine, I went with this and this and it looks clean installed. Like it's not even there.  Good luck with your search!

But I also don't mind waiting a bit longer for more to hit the used market and the price to drop a bit further.

Porsche,3cugi9,FunkyJunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:55:20 2015 UTC,Wow I wouldn't believe this is possible. The inside door jam is bright guards red but the outside is orange fade. I wonder if I can get the red back. Seems impossible even with this write up.
Porsche,3cugi9,mellena,2,Sat Jul 11 08:05:46 2015 UTC,"its just labor and staying at it.  Trust me, you can bring it back.  Porsche paint is amazing paint.  Its single stage.  Just work the area.  Take your time.  And you will be amazed."
Porsche,3cugi9,DogTesticals,2,Sat Jul 11 08:25:33 2015 UTC,Very cool I just got my first porsche too!
Porsche,3cugi9,Andthentherewasgod,2,Sat Jul 11 04:50:44 2015 UTC,"1985.5. Timing belt done within the past year and a half with only a hundred or so miles on it. Ignition wires all replaced. Engine idles a tad rough but once going it's smooth and clutch and trans are smooth as heck. Air doesn't work and fan seems to only blow warm air. The only mod that I would prob like to reverse if I can is a relay less fuel pump switch that was put in. Key goes in, flick the fuel pump on then start. was told this was done because a fuel pump relay switch was to hard to locate 😐. For the $ I'm not complaining one bit!"
Porsche,3ct10d,CouchPotatoFamine,15,Fri Jul 10 15:16:20 2015 UTC,Seeing the silver one that far over the curb makes me cry.

Porsche,3ct10d,mrwoolery,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:50:54 2015 UTC,Ugh first thing I noticed. The closest curb has remnants of a previous grinder. Working at a car dealer you'd be surprised at how many people do this. Lots of Corvettes with screwed up fascias.

Porsche,3ct10d,tobythesandwich,2,Fri Jul 10 16:21:23 2015 UTC,I thought he was talking about that black Porsche to the right of the Red Toyota pickup.  (ps: I am kidding.)
Porsche,3ct10d,deformo,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:34 2015 UTC,I do love the 993.  But the hood line not being flush with the front fender line drives me crazy. Why did they do that!!!
Porsche,3ct10d,Mythrilfan,2,Fri Jul 10 16:11:38 2015 UTC,the hood line not being flush with the front fender line   I don't think I understand what you mean. Care to explain a bit more?
Porsche,3ct10d,Crack-Midget,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:05:04 2015 UTC,DAM........ I have a silver 983 and now you've fucked it. I will never love it like I loved before reading this.   You're right.
Porsche,3ct10d,deformo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:31:59 2015 UTC,The front edge of the hood line. It stops a few inches short of the edge of the fenders. The line under the headlights.
Porsche,3ct10d,Mythrilfan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"What, these parts? Yes, the 964 had a straight bumper line, but that feature has been taken over by every 911 front end since. (Only the 996 facelift dropped it, but still hinted at the feature.)  Besides, the 911 is usually seen as ""classically pretty"" because it is a classic in itself. Other that, it does not follow classical proportions, especially at the front. So...  (No offense intended!)"
Porsche,3ct10d,deformo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:09:20 2015 UTC,Yes it is classically beautiful. That is why I own one. The 993 and the 996 (and quite frankly no incarnation since) do not look as pretty as the models that precede them. The shape of the fender was changed as well as having the hood-line stop short or drop below the fender-line as in the picture you posted. No offense taken. This is all matter of opinion.
Porsche,3ct10d,Kingcrowing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:59:01 2015 UTC,I never really noticed this until now. I'll never be able to unsee it!
Porsche,3ct10d,jtl914,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:25 2015 UTC,Agreed! I still think it's one of the best looking Porsche's ever but that has always bugged me.
Porsche,3cvh1j,Tyre-slayer,6,Sat Jul 11 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"Very few body mods are as well done as original Porsche. There are a few good kits out there, but for every good one you have umpteen bad. I love how the lines lay on my 4S, but I might get a widebody kit one day. Of course, engine mods come first."
Porsche,3cvh1j,Jooceyjooce,2,Sat Jul 11 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. Engine mods to me are always first. And you're right, for every one good kit there are several bad. But it's the love that goes into the car, for me anyway, that makes it alright. What some might see as a travesty to Porsches might be someone else's baby, you know?"
Porsche,3cvh1j,Jooceyjooce,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:18:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I really like the mods that Japanese guy does to Porsches, but other people on here hate them. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
Porsche,3cvh1j,musicisfree91,3,Sat Jul 11 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Just my personal opinion, I think RWB's and Gemballa are ugly. It's the tack on look of the wide body. The stigma I think comes from the fact that he's Japanese, and the aesthetic that goes with it. I'm by no means a purist, I love what Magnus Walker does with his 911's. If I had the money I'd have a Singer modified 911. Which is a complete transformation of a 964, too bad it costs more that a new Ferrari F12!"
Porsche,3cvh1j,Ilubalu,2,Sat Jul 11 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"This looks like a good intro. to the issue. Like Magnus, you gotta use these machines for your own pleasure and purposes. Forget about what others think you should do. It's your car! Besides, it's just a thing, and you are a human being. It must serve you; not the other way around! Having said that, it's my opinion that add-ons like huge spoilers and side panels do seem to mess up a thing of beauty, but hey, don't mind me; I get a lift from seeing people enjoy themselves. It's up to me to make the car in my garage satisfy me in the manner of my choosing. It's not up to me to judge what's in your garage."
Porsche,3cvh1j,musicisfree91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:00:50 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Porsche,3cvh1j,musicisfree91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Honestly I'd like to see more of the blue one with the ducktail. The wide body doesn't look tack on, from the one picture I like it."
Porsche,3cvh1j,Grogg2000,2,Sat Jul 11 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"On my 996 I have a few rules to my self   motor = free to do what i want, no one gonna look at it, for the moment i cant afford though :) body = slight changes as xeon and led conversion of lights.  No plastic kits etc, a repaint could be accepted to get away from the chipping on the hood. But no colour change. Other plastic kits should be kept away, Porsche is better than me on design."
Porsche,3cvh1j,MacNugget,2,Sun Jul 12 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think:  Is your Porsche some special snowflake rare model made out of pure unobtanium?  Don't do it.  No matter what.  Keep that 550 Spyder as close to showroom stock as you can.  Don't fuck with a '73 RS.  Just don't.  Mint condition 993 turbo?  Think long and hard before you mangle it.  Is the mod functional?  Does it actually work?  It's acceptable.  Aero is great if you need it.  It's stupid if you don't or if it's just making the car slower.  Better shocks are great if you were trying to solve some specific shortcoming in the original suspension.  If you just got them because they were expensive and custom, it's stupid.  Porsche engineers were faced with design constraints you might not have.  There are certainly changes you might consider which would improve the car for your needs. Can you make the car accelerate faster, turn sharper, stop shorter, or be safer?  Definitely.  All of these changes are on the table for you.  The best approach is to wait until you can identify a specific attribute of the car you hope to improve.  Then add or remove parts until that thing is improved.  You don't need new shocks until you're unhappy with the old ones.  You don't need more power until you're limited by the current output.  Cause comes first, then effect.  Is it purely cosmetic?   Do you like how it looks?  It's acceptable.  There's no accounting for taste.  Do what thrills you.  As much as it pains me to say, that even includes TechArt kit and those atrocious Gemballa abominations.  It's your car."

Porsche,3cvmab,pvera,3,Sat Jul 11 04:05:01 2015 UTC,Daily Driver = 991  Weekend Driver = 981 GTS  I've driven a manual Audi for several years now and I want PDK/DSG so much!
Porsche,3cvmab,Mr_You,3,Sat Jul 11 06:13:07 2015 UTC,"Hehe, just one or the other. Not both : )"
Porsche,3cvmab,Mr_You,2,Sat Jul 11 11:22:09 2015 UTC,"My point was it depends on what you're going to use it for.  If you want a daily driver go for the 991, if you want a weekend driver then go for the 981.  After much thought, I've concluded I would probably be most satisfied (in my ideal dream world) with a Macan daily driver and a Boxster as a weekend driver.  Adding a 911 to the stable would just be a bonus.  I like the Cayman GTS a lot and if I could only pick one, that might be what I would choose AFTER testing driving both of them a few times."
Porsche,3cvmab,KR0N0SXx,3,Sat Jul 11 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"The head says Cayman, the heart says 911..."
Porsche,3cvmab,j_arena,2,Sat Jul 11 16:59:31 2015 UTC,Cayman GTS because the 6 speed is so much better than the 7 speed in the 991.

Porsche,3cvmab,Grogg2000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:00:02 2015 UTC,True for most cars in the current lineup. Even for the less sporting cars.
Porsche,3cvmab,vicelordjohn,2,Sun Jul 12 01:04:04 2015 UTC,1000% the GTS.  Drive them both- there is no comparison.

Porsche,3cvmab,j_arena,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:59:45 2015 UTC,"Many of us go through this dilemma . I went certified C2S because it had a lot of the options I wanted and it was more car. I'm also one of those ""appearance"" guys so there was some value in having the 911 even though I know a Cayman is the better performing chassis."

Porsche,3cspzb,casuallylatedan,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:39 2015 UTC,The narration at the start is cheesy but the raw audio for this car makes up for it.

Porsche,3cv6fz,Jooceyjooce,3,Sat Jul 11 01:13:46 2015 UTC,Happens on my 996TT as well. I suspect it's perfectly normal...

Porsche,3cv6fz,Tyre-slayer,2,Sat Jul 11 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's completely normal. It's to cool the engine at a steady pace, especially if you have a Turbo to prevent damage to the turbos staying too hot for too long."
Porsche,3cv6fz,casuallylatedan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"My Cayman at least warns in the manual that the fans can and may come on any time the battery is connected, especially after turning off on a hot day. Stands to reason the 996 has the same behavior."

Plus they were in the generation between Stone Age technology and decent technology, which is found in the 997.1. Besides price, I see no reason to get a 996, unless you really want a turbo, in which case that's probably your best bet. 993 turbos are stupid expensive right now.

Porsche,3cju0s,foreignwhipsandDMT,11,Thu Jul 9 04:58:08 2015 UTC,Gorgeous car.. And I'm not trying to be negative but I've always wondered why people choose to have silver cars as I've always found them very plain looking. So what about silver do you like?
Porsche,3cju0s,pvera,14,Wed Jul 8 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"Silver is the international racing color for Germany, it is actually a premium color for the 911."
Porsche,3cju0s,SweetNPowerChicken,4,Wed Jul 8 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, guess it's just a personal preference thing. It's just hard to ignore how incredible I think that car would look in a dark metallic grey or a nice shiny white... Perfection"
Porsche,3cju0s,foreignwhipsandDMT,4,Wed Jul 8 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite 911 combo is white paint and red leather. And the agate gray with red leather on the 991 looks incredible.  So yes, if I hit the lotto I'll be ordering my Singer 911 on a white paint and red interior scheme, and my 991 on agate grey and red leather.   Boxsters on the other hand I like silver because I got lucky enough to see the test mules of the mk1 model being tested on public roads around Zuffenhausen when I was stationed in Germany in the mid 90s."
Porsche,3cju0s,Nicholasss,8,Wed Jul 8 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"I 100% know what you mean,  I would never buy any other car in Silver (they look like a rental car to me). But the Porsche it just looks right. Fell in love as soon as I saw it."
Porsche,3cju0s,RoderickGunnar,4,Wed Jul 8 15:40:38 2015 UTC,I find that cars with wider fenders and predominant body lines looks extremely aggressive in silver for whatever reason. Nice car man! 996 C4S in silver is still my goal in the next few years.
Porsche,3cju0s,elenril,3,Wed Jul 8 23:14:40 2015 UTC,I will say that it pulls it off as good as any car can.
Porsche,3cju0s,SasukeGear,3,Wed Jul 8 15:43:50 2015 UTC,I didn't like silver cars until I bought my first Porsche in silver. It had red interior so it certainly wasn't plain but it was really nice how well it blended in with other cars and I could go a month without washing it and it would look cleaner than a black car would two hours after being washed. Both huge pluses considering I daily drove it. I'll probably go yellow on the next one but I loved having silver and would do it again.
Porsche,3cju0s,avioneta,2,Thu Jul 9 02:45:22 2015 UTC,"I half agree with you, but I owned a silver car and that color hid dust and dirt so well. Mind you I went from a black car that was impossible to keep clean to silver. So my judgement may be slightly jaded."
Porsche,3cju0s,stealthboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of silver cars either. I think angular cars look better in strong colors like black, white, dark blue, and grey, and more rounded cars look good in bright colors like yellow and red. My current favorite from Porsche is the sapphire blue. I've seen a boxster around in that color and it's awesome."
Porsche,3cju0s,stealthboy,3,Wed Jul 8 21:41:26 2015 UTC,Congratulations ! I hope it keeps you happy for a long time.  Just a Question. Why didn't you go for the S or GTS models?
Porsche,3cju0s,fkaradsheh,7,Wed Jul 8 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"For me it came down to a few things;   I took the S model and 4S out for a test drive, both of those cars were 18K and 31K more than the C2. Personally it did not feel like the extra 50HP made that big of a difference, I could feel it under 30MPH (more torque on low end) but when we opened it up on the interstate I got the same happiness in the non-S as the S & 4S.   So I just did not find it worth the added cost at this time. The 4S I drove did have the Performance Exhaust Option and I loved that. My 911 is going to go back to the dealer in a few weeks to have that option added.   As for the GTS, all they had on the lot was one fully loaded red GTS priced at 148K. Just was not in scope at the time lol"
Porsche,3cju0s,bigchallah,3,Wed Jul 8 15:44:29 2015 UTC,My 911 is going to go back to the dealer in a few weeks to have that option added.   This is a very good decision. By far the most satisfying part of owning my 997 is the PSE
Porsche,3cju0s,Rexus5,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"I was going to do the Shark Works system as its cheaper, but I know I loved the exhaust of the PSE and having on/off button is great."
Porsche,3cju0s,camabron,2,Wed Jul 8 17:26:34 2015 UTC,I'm also thinking of adding PSE.  May I ask how much the dealer quoted you for that?
Porsche,3cju0s,stealthboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:35 2015 UTC,For the parts and labor I was quoted $3000.00
Porsche,3cju0s,mwfraczek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:02:35 2015 UTC,That's pretty good.  I've heard $3500.  I know it costs more to add it to our 3.4 versus the 3.8.

Porsche,3cju0s,camabron,2,Thu Jul 9 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Personally I think PDK is way more fun than a manual in the 991 platform. Also if you drive the 7 speed in this series you will quickly see that it as an afterthought vs how perfectly the PDK works. Just was the right choice for me.   It was hard for me to choose, coming out of a manual 3LT Stingray I love the feeling of shifting however this time it was the right choice."

Porsche,3clyq4,helloWTF,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:15 2015 UTC,Let's face it.  Any mod that covers up those fugly stock 996 headlights is an automatic improvement.
Porsche,3clyq4,M0b1u5,2,Thu Jul 9 06:53:56 2015 UTC,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I actually think the 996 is a very good looking car with the '98 Carerra having an amazingly simple and elegant design. It harks directly back to the simplicity and elegance of the original 1965 cars.  Here's a prediction for you: unmolested 996s are going to start appreciating sharply in 2018, and the Turbos will go through the roof.  I'm shopping for an X50 Turbo from '04 right now. I want a black on black example, with a manual gearbox. That car is 2/3rds of a 959, in a bodyshell a lot stiffer than a 959. At a price which is frankly, stupidly low."
Porsche,3clyq4,helloWTF,0,Thu Jul 9 07:06:43 2015 UTC,"Disagree on the base 996, agree with you on the 996 Turbo appreciation.  The 996 lines lack the elegant curves of the traditional 911 shape.  Some call it slab-sided.  There's a reason these are so cheap in the marketplace -- they're cheaply made, mass-produced appliances.  Twenty years after their inception, they're still not as loved as the other 911 iterations.  The Turbos are good value for the money but the price tag doesn't overcome the esthetic deficiencies which many find difficult to overlook."

Porsche,3cfqx8,helmet_newton,3,Wed Jul 8 14:10:36 2015 UTC,"What?  The 944 was far more reliable then Japanese performance cars of the era, just go to your local craigslist and notice how few of its competitors are even still running, let alone in half decent condition.  The MKII Celica Supra, RX-7 and Mitsubishi starion are extremely rare to find and have far more issues than the 944.  The only semi-reliable competitors the 944 ever had from Japan came later in the 944's production cycle, the MR2 and the 240sx, but both were far less powerful cars which means they should inherently be more reliable... but they aren't, they don't last nearly as long on a track as the 944."
Porsche,3cfqx8,Abominati0n,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"All true and noted points.  I was thinking more like a 2014 performance coupe rocking a timeless body style like the 944.    No, I don't want an 80s Japanese car, either.  If you have to rock a 1986 sports car, a 944 is a nice drive.  Much more solid build quality than Asian competitors.

I think the main difficulty with keep those on the road is their low value, and difficulty finding a competent mechanic. Nobody wants to put a $2000 paint job on a $2000 car, but your car is going to need paint if it's from 85."
Porsche,3cfqx8,ifitdontfit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"Chiming in here on an old post.  Sorry. Japanese sports coupes were more reliable than the 944s when comparing apples to apples.  You see more ragged out because it's a combination of them selling more due to lower costs and the market practically falling out for them in the 90s. With the exception of the Rotary engine in the FC RX7, all other Japanese sports coupes used very reliable engines. Even the large displacement 4's from Mitsubishi were practically bulletproof and the downfall was over boosting"

I live in the mountains and ski a lot (so i put on snow tires) and never have I felt un-easy. The only time I lost the back end was when I wanted to. Turbo lag is still a bit of an issue but only really so when putting your foot down in the wrong gear. The twin scroll turbo spools low enough in the power band to minimize lag.  TLDR: I love my WRX and never regretted buying it.

IMHO it's just irresponsible parenting to give their highschooler a $200k toy, let alone a 560HP one that can kill him.  It's shitty parenting in many respects - safety, fiscal responsibility, and just plain old raising your kid to understand and appreciate the value of a dollar. I'm doing well financially, but when I have a kid that age, I'm buying him the shittiest, uncoolest car I can find that is also safe and reliable, and I'll probably make them pay off the cost to me with a loan as well. I think it's good opportunity to learn a bit about how the real world works. Handing them a car that's worth 4x the national median household income is a missed opportunity, to put it lightly."

Porsche,3c8gtt,PcardoMontalbon,3,Sun Jul 5 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"My thoughts. Who'd get a new Turbo S and be like 'It's a piece of shit, where's my Camry?'"
Porsche,3c8gtt,bitloo,2,Mon Jul 6 08:02:54 2015 UTC,"You're very fortunate; that's beautiful.    Mine (ha!) will be white too. In fact, I'll even go for the red interior and gloss black shiny bits as they look so good with white!    Out of interest how long is it between signing your name on the order form and getting the car?    Edit: Yellow calipers??"
Porsche,3c8gtt,Handsomeme,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The white was easily the best color, they also had one in silver and one in blue, both were nice but you can't go wrong with white. The yellow calipers are Porsche's carbon ceramic brakes, they come stock with the Turbo S. Its one of the differences between the S and the Turbo. We were at the dealership for about 2-3 hours before we drove off the lot with it if thats what you're asking"
Porsche,3c8gtt,Clancypantz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. I thought you had ordered it specially to get that configuration.    I still wouldn't have yellow calipers though ;)"
Porsche,3c8gtt,vicelordjohn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"I'd want red calipers if anything to match the interior :D They stop on a dime though, last night I slammed the brakes at 65 and got a headache, all the blood rushed right into my face"
Porsche,3c7umk,timuncle,26,Sun Jul 5 18:41:02 2015 UTC,Porsches are meant to be enjoyed. Love seeing 911s with surfboards or a ski box up top.
Porsche,3c7umk,whitecompass,3,Sun Jul 5 19:32:19 2015 UTC,I wonder if this changes the aerodynamics and cornering ability at all?
Porsche,3c7umk,Sherlock--Holmes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"Probably, but I'm sure PDCC would help a lot."
Porsche,3c7umk,airblizzard,4,Mon Jul 6 16:21:24 2015 UTC,I love seeing stuff like that. I know that a lot of people gave Nick Murray grief when he put the rack on his; IMO it just makes the car look cooler.
Porsche,3c7umk,imalwaysthinking,2,Mon Jul 6 01:04:02 2015 UTC,Love the back end of that car. Just love it. Great angle.
Porsche,3c8803,iamthenewone,2,Sun Jul 5 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"I saw a black one...black wheels, black tinted windows and tail lights...white is still better."
Porsche,3c8803,K3R3G3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:55:47 2015 UTC,I've got to say Porsche did a great job with the 991. I reckon the GT3 is one of the best looking 911's there is.
