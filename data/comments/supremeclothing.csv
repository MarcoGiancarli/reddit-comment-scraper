supremeclothing,3e0syo,Funbox711,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:39 2015 UTC,Missed the sarcasm tag man! Haha
supremeclothing,3e0syo,cheggiephoto,6,Tue Jul 21 02:32:26 2015 UTC,your organization for this picture irrationally irritates me.
supremeclothing,3e0syo,glombz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:44 2015 UTC,Haha. I was pulling them out to rearrange them in my closet and just said fuck it and took a picture. I am definitely not an artist and am a shitty picture taker.
supremeclothing,3e0syo,bootynuggets,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:38 2015 UTC,Photographer is the word you're looking for...
supremeclothing,3e0syo,bootynuggets,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:58 2015 UTC,Did you see how shitty this pic is? I'm unworthy of that word. Haha.

supremeclothing,3e0syo,footlesszak,0,Tue Jul 21 02:51:57 2015 UTC,is that one of those altoids portable chargers?
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Toolspaper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:48 2015 UTC,Nope. Regular ass altoids. That's just a cable cradle thing for my phone charger. Wait...is there actually a portable altoids charger? I kind of want one now.
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Toolspaper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:16 2015 UTC,U can diy a potable charger with an altoids can for about $10.. Google kt
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Toolspaper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:32 2015 UTC,"Couple missing, but this is basically all of it. Notably the mint S Logo I gave to my girlfriend...which I somewhat regret. I've sold a lot throughout the years but this started in about '07. First camp ever was one of those long bill camps with purple, black, and white panels. It was dope, but I sold it a while ago. Enjoy and if you have any questions on what something is just lemme know (though none of it is crazy heat)."
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Tucci_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:22:21 2015 UTC,Are hoes worth $150 resale S Logos?
supremeclothing,3e0syo,yung_lean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"Ummm....yes? Haha. The mint and black are the only ones I have bought on resale, but not for 150. The others are from the webstore thanks to multiple cards, addresses, and a patient girlfriend."

supremeclothing,3e0syo,whisperingmoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:43 2015 UTC,Where'd you get that paranoia?
supremeclothing,3e0syo,illferrell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"I have two. Bought one with the matching wallet off of Strictly a long ass time ago, and one off of grailed last month."
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Hahahahahahai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:54 2015 UTC,Oh shit the one from grailed was mine. Would you mind posting pics of the wallet?
supremeclothing,3e0syo,Hahahahahahai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:49 2015 UTC,Ha nice! Thanks for the hat dude =)  I don't have the wallet anymore unfortunately. Solepremecon of all people actually has one and posted it recently. Let me see if I can find it.
