kristenbell,39o8ik,CelebRpDude,8,Sat Jun 13 04:40:06 2015 UTC,I wish that they had their own show together. She is normally very good on talk shows but on Ferguson's show they were always so great together.

kristenbell,38n69d,BMOCROC,2,Fri Jun 5 16:15:31 2015 UTC,Like a perfect gift all ready to be unwrapped.

kristenbell,37r04a,joecb91,21,Fri May 29 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   What the fuck are they supposed to comment on?  ""Hey, people are using your car pool service.""  -""Ok."""
kristenbell,37r04a,derpaherpa,4,Fri May 29 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Uber's lack of comment, her use of the #ubercarpool hashtag, and @uber make it seem mighty likely."
kristenbell,37r04a,Herak,3,Fri May 29 18:49:41 2015 UTC,Yeah. I might be a social recluse but if I'm carpooling with Kristen Bell I'm going to at least mention I loved Veronica Mars.
kristenbell,37r04a,Beingabummer,3,Fri May 29 20:25:53 2015 UTC,That would be the best uber ride ever. I wonder if some of these celebrities realize how much we'd love to chat with them on a cab ride or at a bar or whatnot
kristenbell,37r04a,foxsable,4,Sat May 30 06:41:58 2015 UTC,"I would like to think that if that was me, we could have a nice conversation about how much I loved watching Veroncia Mars.  But I'd likely just turn into a squeeing fanboy with no clue what to say as I revert back into an awkward middle schooler."
